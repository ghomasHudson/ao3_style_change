He explained it to Harry one night, when they were both a few drinks in. “It’s not that I see anything in these straight men I flirt with,” he said, “but it’s fun to see their reaction and to just… be myself. I’ve known I was like this since, oh, I don’t know, when I had ballroom dance lessons and all I wanted to do was be dipped and wooed off my feet!” He drained his glass of Firewhiskey, and summoned the bottle with a lazy wave of his wand. Topping off his glass, he offered and poured another two fingers into Harry’s glass as well. “Flirting with Ron is fun because sometimes he’ll play back. Especially when we’re in front of new recruits.” He giggled. “It’s so funny to watch their faces, when they’ve already heard that he’s engaged to Hermione. They think I’m his secret gay work lover!”
“I… I don’t think I”m ready for that just yet,” he whispered faintly, “First time, you know?” Alyce threw her head back and laughed.
“Ready to go?” He asked, breaking the silence at last. Draco stiffened, then relaxed as he turned and faced Harry, an eyebrow raised.
He gazed up at his old school rival, who was currently swaying in a very sensual way while mouthing the words, “We can get a little crazy, just for fun, just for fun…” and tried very hard not to shatter his glass. Malfoy was at the Muggle club. Malfoy was Friday night’s entertainment. Malfoy was looking absolutely delicious in his way too tight leather pants and fishnet top…
Harry did as he was told and followed Draco, sitting down in front of the warm tart. Handing Draco a fork, he dug in immediately, his eyes falling closed as the warm, gooey treat hit his tongue. He chewed happily for a moment before swallowing and meeting Draco’s amused gaze. “This is the best treacle tart I’ve ever had!” He proclaimed, taking another bite before frowning. “And I’m not sure if I can be around them, not just yet. You saw how Hermione likes to pick at me, and Ron I think is still sore that Ginny and I didn’t work out.” Draco took his own bite of the tart - it wasn’t perfect, he’d have to work on the recipe, but he wasn’t about to tell Harry that - and shrugged his shoulders.
Surprisingly, the rest of the week went by smoothly, and before Draco knew it, it was Saturday, June 5th. His 24th birthday. Luna let it slip during “Mix-In Time” on Thursday that they were all planning a surprise party for him, but she also knew that he disliked surprises. Draco was extremely grateful, as he was still not used to having people - friends, he reminded himself - actually care about his birthday. He originally planned on having a nice night at home, possibly creating a new recipe for Sunday, but he admitted to himself that he was pleased that his friends actually wanted to celebrate with him.
Draco loved dancing at The Castle, and enjoyed the attention he received. But of course, Potter had to come along and ruin it...
“Erm… Snowball?” Harry winced as the ferret nipped his finger. “I don’t know, Hermione. I just got him. I’m sure I’ll come up with a name at some point.”
Harry’s brain was short circuiting. He almost dropped his drink. He almost ran away.
“How’re his stats looking?” Ron knelt in front of his hearth and looked down at Harry. “Still greens and yellows?”
“Unspeakable Malfoy disappeared shortly after a break in the love potion case.” Robards sat down and idly straightened the paperwork on his desk. “It was no coincidence; we found evidence at the scene that Malfoy was directly involved. The fact that he’s been missing in action since then makes it clear that he’s feeling guilty. I leave it up to you fine gentlemen to find him and bring him in.” Harry, Ron, and Neville looked at each other. It was rare that they were to go after a singular person, let alone a Ministry employee…
The mixer was on, filled to the brim with batter, and Harry was bustling about, grabbing different ingredients from different places for the mix-ins. “Plain, apple, chocolate chip, blueberry, and ham with cheese.” He rattled off, not looking at Draco. “I’m sorry for being late, but I can get this done fast.”
“Haven’t been intimate, my arse.” Harry heard Ron say, followed by another slap from Hermione. With a wave to his best friends, he went to collect the discharge papers and headed back to Draco’s room.
“Harry.” Draco cut him off. “You are what I want, and I have no interest in anyone else. I didn’t have an interest in anyone before you reappeared in my life. You have nothing to worry about.”
“Well you’re in luck!” He held up the jar triumphantly. “I just made custard the other day.” Setting the jar on the counter to loosen up, he beckoned Harry into the living room where he sat on the couch, putting his feet up on the coffee table and motioning for Harry to sit down as well.
Steeling himself, he approached the bar and made eye contact with the bartender, who smiled at him in acknowledgement before finishing with her current customers. She leaned towards him and shouted near his ear, “Hey darlin’, haven’t seen you here before! What’ll you be having tonight?”
I could have gotten a gun or two, I suppose, but that just seemed so… impersonal.
because he was here through it all, encouraging me to finish, and just generally being the best person ever. Thank you for everything!! <3
I could only handle being an Auror for so long. Everywhere was corrupt. My partners were corrupt. Ron was corrupt; though who could blame him? He lost so much in the war.
“Luna grows it outside.” Draco confirmed. “And one thing you can taste?”
,” he ground himself into Potter, brushing their twin erections together, “that I excite you. So the question becomes…” He brought his hands up, fingertips teasing Potter’s sensitive skin, and tangled his fingers through the thick curls at the base of his neck. He smiled playfully, and allowed his lips to gently caress Potter’s. “Are you coming back next Friday?”
“I may be able to take a short leave of absence, and be your personal caretaker until we get everything figured out.” Harry acted as though he couldn’t see or hear Draco’s plight. “I’m sure Healer Douglas wouldn’t mind. I never take time away anyways.”
“I don’t know, I’m not a healer like you. Something about recognizing your surroundings, or some shite.”
“I was just wondering if you’d like to go out sometime?” Ethan batted his eyelashes and leaned against the front counter. “I know the cafe closes early, so maybe we could just…?” He was interrupted by the front door opening, bell jangling wildly as a windswept Harry Potter burst through. He must have been in a hurry; he had forgotten his Glamour.
“…and while I understand that tea is a perfectly lovely breakfast item, you would think that some people would have the common decency to wait until all parties are awake to begin the brew…!” Draco paused in the doorway, hair disheveled, glaring at Ron and Harry.
“I told you I had a mind healer. I was diagnosed with a bunch of things after the war; the most prevalent thing was anxiety attacks. My healer taught me the five-senses trick, and while it’s hard to do to oneself in the midst of an attack, it’s easier when you have a second person talking you through it.” He patted Harry’s knee. “I could tell you were coming back to me after you told me what you could hear, but it’s important to go all the way down to one. The taste ends up grounding you the most because you have to think a little harder.” Harry nodded slowly and got up from the bed.
“You’ve always had a savior complex, Potter,” Blaise spat. “Taking in the strays, giving them a warm and loving home… I bet when Draco came to you, you nearly came in your pants when you realized he could stay with you.”
What the hell was Malfoy playing at?
He covered his scar, he dimmed his eyes to a deep chocolate brown, and showed up to the club on Friday just on the cusp of 9pm.
“Blueberry, plain, ham and cheese, raisin, pumpkin.” Pointing at the different lumps, he began delegating kitchen duties. “Neville, the blueberries are in the cooler underneath the counter. Hermione, the ham and cheese is already cut up and ready to mix in, next to the blueberries. Ron,” he chucked the raisins at the red head, who caught them easily, “and Luna, you know where the pumpkin and spices are.” He contented himself with kneading the plain dough, knowing he could get it done and cut quickly so that he could finish up the cleaning.
“Are you guys finally going to start that family you’ve been talking about?” Harry asked mildly, knowing that it had been a sore subject for a while. Ron was all about having kids, but Hermione had always been on the fence.
“How’s everyone doing tonight?” Malfoy called, and the crowd went crazy. Another finger to his lips, another silence fell. “Well, that sounds good. As you can see,” he gestured upwards, “No cage! What’s up with that?” His face pulled into a regretful pout, and Harry wanted to bite his lip…
It was Draco’s turn to cough on his liquor. “Potter… you aren’t… you never said… you are...?”
“Me too.” Nodding, Harry looked at the ceiling and took a few deep breaths, before meeting Draco’s eyes and grinning. “So? What do I call you? My boyfriend? My partner?”
This chapter is very conversation-heavy with a bit of background and a bunch of arguing xD Had to know there would be some sort of showdown!
“Pansy,” Harry corrected, “Pansy is his wife.”
“If he gets better,” Ron muttered, earning him a smack on the arm from Hermione and a glare from Harry.
He raised his wand to blast through the door - and I was on him in an instant. I pushed him down and back, my knee digging into his sternum, my hands at his throat. He choked, and couldn’t keep his charm up. It dropped -
… and he was happy.
He should have run away.
He was going to have a talk with Ginny.
Light footsteps behind Draco alerted him to Harry’s approach. “Hey,” Harry’s voice was barely above a whisper. “I’m so sorry. I really didn’t mean to cause any sort of issue between you and them…” Draco turned to face Harry, noting his reddening face. “It’s just… it’s been a long time, and with Ginny and I breaking up, I haven’t really left my house to see them, and I try not to impose on anyone…” Draco had heard enough. He held up a hand to silence Harry, waiting until the man looked up at him.
After bringing Ginny over a few times, Luna began to branch off and bring others with her - Neville was the second guest, and he had clapped Draco on the back as though they were old friends and swore up and down that he had never had as good of an American muffin as Draco’s lemon poppy seed. He had left with a basket full of the muffins and a few jars of raspberry jam for his gran, and Draco felt lighter than he had in years. He may not be able to call these people friends, but they definitely weren’t enemies any longer.
“Earl grey, splash of milk, three sugars.” Harry smiled at Draco’s quick order. At least he still remembered his preferred drink. That was a good sign; he hadn’t lost all of his memories after all.
“You just read that on your chart,” Harry tried to tug it away from him, “You don’t know what your name is.”
Harry felt his heart clench. “We’re… friends, Draco. We've been friends for years. We've lived together for two years. You trust me to be your Healer, and you brew me potions for my patients. We get along really well. It’s up to you what you want to do.”
“No buts!” Ginny cut him off. “You said you were going to use a Glamour for next time. What were you thinking? Blond? Red hair?” She smirked as Harry scrubbed a hand through his black tresses.
“Did anyone you saw on Friday look like
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s how they found themselves sitting at a corner table at the new breakfast spot in Hogsmeade, aptly named The Ecstatic Croissant. Draco ordered two freshly squeezed orange juices, wondering idly if a full breakfast was something the Lovegood Cafe should consider getting into.
“Au contraire, Potter,” Draco was smug, “I work a terribly boring nine to five, and while your schedule may be hectic during the training days, I know that you’ll probably end up working four days, twelve hour shifts, with three days off a week. Does that sound correct?”
“Zabini Manor!” He snarled, throwing the Floo powder into the flames and stepping in. Harry watched, horrified, as Draco was swept away.
“What’s your favorite?” Draco handed the last spoon to Harry and rinsed his hands before moving towards the refrigerator.
“What are you thinking about?” He asked, running a finger through the condensation on his glass.
“I guess that’s fine.” Harry sighed. “I still have a lot of work to do, mind you. Don’t expect miracles.”
Ginny had to have known, hadn’t she? He shook his head. She came here a lot, knew about goth night, knew about Fridays… was she having him on? Was she trying to make him go insane? Just because they had broken up, just because he had admitted that his school-boy nemesis may have been something less nemesis and more obsession… he groaned and downed the rest of his drink, hoping it would cloud his mind enough to stop it from racing.
“One shot?” Harry asked quietly, not wanting to interrupt. Ethan looked up at his words, and his mouth fell open.
to feel Potter’s warm lips against his.
“So it is the guy in the back.”
“You?” It was more of a question, but Draco smiled.
Draco geared up for his set, excited for the crowd. He spoke idly with Alyce, revealing he was planning on leading with the song Flesh since that seemed to be a unanimous favorite. She agreed with him wholeheartedly, and suggested using the Cage. Draco didn’t mind the Cage; it wasn’t his favorite but it did allow the people watching a lovely view of his toned arse.
Rolling his eyes, Blaise stood and stretched. “I’m heading to the canteen. I’m due for some lunch, and I need to firecall Pansy and let her know that there’s no update to his condition. I’ll be back in about an hour or so. Will Healer Potter be in?”
I want to super shout out my bestie
“No, he doesn’t remember that we’re dating.” Harry’s face flushed bright red. “But that’s no matter.” He waved a hand in what he hoped was an offhand manner. “We were only dating for a month. Not that big of a deal.”
“Is that a wand in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” He cringed inwardly at the pickup line, but it had the effect he wanted - Potter froze and began to stammer. Draco turned around and placed his thigh back between Potter’s legs, drinking in the deep brown eyes, almost absent thanks to his blown-out pupils. How he wished Potter hadn't Glamoured them! Yes, this was the right choice, but it was so difficult not to give into his sexual desire. “This is a Muggle club, James. What are you doing here?” Draco held his breath. Would he admit that he was actually Harry Potter? Would he run off?
“I’m sorry.” Ethan ran a hand through his hair, which didn’t look as styled as it had every other time he had visited. “I was out of line on Saturday, and I know it.” He grimaced. “I told my mum and she said if I didn’t get my ‘skinny white ass’,” he raised his fingers into air quotes, “back here to apologize right away, I’d get my arse whooped. And even without that,” he hurried to say, casting a glance at Harry before meeting Draco’s eyes again, “I know I said things I didn’t mean. You don’t owe me anything, not an explanation, or even a coffee if I was a paying customer. Though…” he stared at the espresso machine wistfully, “Your hazelnut macchiatos are the best I’ve ever had.”
Hermione glanced at the permanent Tempus charm affixed to the wall. “His shift starts in 10 minutes. I’m sure he’s in the break room if you wanted to wait for him…”
I usually hate doing things the Muggle way, thanks to how I was raised - but this was different. I prepared myself. I have a whole kit, now.
After setting his wand on the coffee table in the living room, Draco flipped on the kitchen light and turned his oven on before beginning to take things out of his cupboards - golden syrup, a large tin pan, and the bread Luna had baked him a few days ago - that would suffice. He sliced the bread with a serrated knife and lined them up on the pan, tossing it into the oven without waiting for it to heat up all the way. It just needed some residual heat to get the moisture out, after all, he wasn’t going for anything more than a light toast. A pie crust he had made the previous weekend was hiding in his refrigerator and he grabbed that, as well as a lemon.
“Hey Draco, I’m so sorry I’m late,” he panted, vaulting over the counter and hurriedly placing his wand in the receptacle, “I was trying to fix up the old stove in the kitchen, and it ended up spewing flames at me… Kreacher got it under control, but...” his voice grew muffled as he made his way into the kitchen. “Everything set out for me? Anything I need to know?”
“It definitely was one of the turning points of our friendship.” Draco smirked, allowing himself to banter. “You’d have never come around if it wasn’t for Luna and my scones.” He ducked as Hermione attempted to box his ears and hurried to stand next to Harry, who was still off to the side, staring into his cup. Draco didn’t know why, but he felt the overwhelming need to protect the quiet man. Nudging him with his elbow and waiting until he looked up, Draco cocked an eyebrow and held his cup up in a toast. Harry clinked his glass and took a deep pull from the fancy straw. Someone cleared their throat, and they both looked up and at Neville’s flushed face.
“Do you want to dance, James?” He purred into his ear. Harry swallowed.
“Like I told you before, we’ve lived together for years.” Harry thrust the discharge papers at Draco. “You see me every day. We eat meals together. You hardly see Blaise, even before your accident.”
Because there would be a next time.
“James. I’m James.” Draco kept his laughter to himself. “It’s nice to meet you.” So Potter was going to keep up the pretense that he WASN’T Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, hanging out at a club. That was fine. Draco enjoyed the hunt.
So why was Potter standing right by the stage, staring up at Draco as though he was the most interesting thing on the planet?
“Don’t you see,” Blaise leaned forward, a mad glint in his eyes, “You could completely recreate him. Draco Malfoy, from the ground up. He could be your perfect, pliant boytoy if you only let yourself be selfish for one damn second.”
There was a whole bar, he could go to any part of it.
He turned back to Malfoy, who was pulling him through the throngs of people towards the center of the dancefloor. Once he was satisfied, he whirled to face Harry with a coy smile. “Come on.” His mouth brushed against Harry’s ear and the quiet words when straight to his groin. Willing his body not to respond too much, Harry strained to hear the music over his wildly thumping heart and tentatively began to move. Malfoy slotted his thigh in between Harry’s legs and pulled him close, one hand at the small of his back, the other coming up to run through his own long hair. “Feel the music,” he murmured, directing Harry’s movements.
“Huh.” Draco crossed his arms. “I can tell you did the decorating.”
?” Hermione asked incredulously, staring at the brilliant white ferret perched haughtily on Harry’s shoulder.
“Wench!” He spat fondly, rolling his eyes. “Well, I suppose we’ll just see, won’t we?” Alyce chuckled with a nod, and turned to serve someone who had just come up to the bar.
“It can take time, but you have people who support you, and you can do what you see fit. I could help you find a Mind Healer if you wanted, like Luna did for me. Or I can just sit here and listen to you and be your friend.” The timer sounded from the kitchen, and Draco stood up, motioning Harry to follow him.
Looking from Draco’s hand on his arm, to Harry’s slightly blushing face, and back to Draco, the pieces all seemed to click at once in Ethan’s brain. “Bloody hell,” he breathed, “No wonder you’re unavailable! If I had Harry Potter, I’d never let him go either!”
Maybe....
“Oh yeah, this is much better than the outside.” Draco sniffed, looking around. “We really live here?”
“So…” he fiddled with his drink, “Harry. What brings you out?” The kitchen went silent, except for Luna’s absent humming. Harry shakily set his drink down on the counter and looked miserable.
“It’s always... been you.”
“No wands in the kitchen,” Harry recited immediately, giving him a small smile. “I remember from the cafe. Something about how the magic affects the baking chemistry, or something?” Draco inclined his head. “I mean… they weren’t wrong? And maybe they deserve some sort of explanation, but…”
He had taken himself out of his pants before his brain caught up with his thoughts, and with a few rough strokes and a twist of his wrist at the tip, he came with a groan, dirtying the floor in front of him. His head fell back against the door with a sharp crack, and he willed his breathing to slow down. This was only a minor setback. He and Draco had been intimate like that before, and Harry’s body was simply responding to the stimuli it was receiving. He had not willingly tried to molest Draco.
“You liked it and are going back in two days.” Damn it, she heard. “Don’t think for a minute that I don’t know you, Harry James Potter. You know why we broke up.” Harry cringed. He hated talking about it and absolutely refused to bring it up.
“I’m not trying to… look, you have amnesia, it usually makes sense to you!” Harry tried not to get worked up. It wouldn’t help either of them.
calling you that!”
“Nothing he could say would change my opinion of you.” Harry assured. “We were roommates long before we started dating. I know you.” He gave Draco a half smile. “I’d like to think I do, anyway. I’m not worried about your past or what you did or didn’t do.”
“Lovegood Cafe and Arabica.” He should have known she already had a name in mind. Luna may come off as eccentric, but when she had an idea and voiced it, she almost always had all of the schematics in mind. “We’d open it in Diagon Alley, of course. Just a small shop. We could have a garden out back for the fruit and you could make the jams and jellies and scones and muffins and…” Draco held out his hands to stop her outflux of ideas.
“Do you know your name?” Harry asked suddenly, dread coursing through him.
She made eye contact with Draco and winked.
The music quieted, and everyone turned to the stage. Lights went down, and there he was, climbing the stairs in the shadows, getting situated right in the middle of the stage.
“Oddly enough, that makes sense.” Draco watched as Harry flitted around the kitchen. He could feel Draco’s eyes boring into him, but he chose to ignore it as he seared the lamb shanks before putting them into the oven.
“Well, there you have it, then. You’re more than welcome to come around the others, too. Like I’ve said many times, my home is a safe space. I can control what happens here, and I make sure that everyone is comfortable. I have no issues asking people to leave if needed.” The treacle tart had cooled enough, so Draco cut a slice and set it on a plate with a healthy dollop of custard. He cut himself a thinner slice and picked up both plates, motioning for Harry to follow him to the living room again. “Grab two forks, will you?”
I should have known.
Draco really hoped he would have dropped the question by then. “You asked me when I got off work, but I am, unfortunately, unavailable. Now, if I could just grab your order…?”
“I don’t believe I asked for your opinion!” Draco was glaring at him again, but Harry was used to it. He stared back calmly, waiting for the moment when Draco would back down. He blinked, realizing his glare was doing nothing, and flushed slightly, turning back to the paperwork.
“Of course, darlin’. He is a bit… intimidating.” She passed Harry a smaller version of the posters that were hanging up around the club. “Here, in case you need reminding.” With a wink, she turned away, leaving Harry to stare into the eyes of Draco Malfoy - Dragon, this club’s star go-go dancer.
That fucking Friday…
“How often do you make treacle tart?” The oven beeped, and Draco quickly put an oven mitt on, grabbed the crust and dumped the beans back into their tin, and replaced the crust, this time setting the timer for ten minutes.
Draco stopped to consider this. There was the rush of adrenaline, the fear of failing, the constant talking to people… “I’m overwhelmed,” he admitted, letting himself lean back against the counter and rubbing his face. “It was a good day, don’t get me wrong… but I’m wondering if I’ll be able to do this consistently.”
know who I am,” Harry grumbled, “But I’d prefer it if the rest of Hogsmeade didn’t.”
He was dead. I was well on my way to being dead.
“Blaise isn’t my roommate and friend, and besides, I hate it.” He shuddered. “I hate anything that brings me back to the war and Voldemort.”
“Pepper, I demand you answer me!” Draco was getting flustered. Harry knew he hated being ignored, but he hadn’t done it on purpose.
To his surprise, Ron nodded along with his words. “It would probably be good for both of you,” he mused, “I’ve noticed that he’s not on the top of his game when he’s spent an extended period at the Manor. And you’re lonely, but you won’t admit it.” Ron grinned at him as Harry glared over his shoulder. “He has changed, for the better. He’s still Malfoy, but he’s more Draco now.”
Harry stayed in the back all day, but he was more than efficient. In fact, when Draco was close to running out of chocolate chip scones, Harry was able to whip up a batch of batter and bake two dozen before the last one was sold, ensuring that there were plenty for the rest of the day. He worked hard, and was able to stay hidden from prying eyes. Some of Draco’s regulars asked who was back there running the show, but Draco fielded the questions with practiced poise, easily steering the conversations back to safer topics.
Now, I couldn’t very well leave the body on the Manor grounds, could I?
“You’re right as always, ‘Mione.” He attempted to run his fingers through his hair, but was thwarted by the claustrophobic fireplace. “Have you heard anything from Ron about what may have happened to Draco?”
“I know what you’re going to say, but once we open up a shop in Hogsmeade, there’s nothing stopping us from asking Hagrid if he wants to raise a new animal, is there?” She grabbed a bag of cups and tore it open, counting out an even number of smalls, mediums, and larges. “You haven’t done anything up front, were you aware? Or were you planning on making today a surprise ‘bring your own cup’ day?”
“Relax, James,” he soothed, “You’re so stiff. Feel the music. Dance
Harry considered this, before a slow smile spread across his face. “I can get behind that idea. Plus,” he leaned forward and brushed his lips against Draco’s again. “It means I get to spend more time with you.” Draco flushed, then laughed as a salmon colored shirt landed on Harry’s head.
“Well yes, it was tasty, but that’s not the only reason we stay around.” Hermione looked earnestly at Draco. “You know that, right?”
“Not for lack of trying, either,” Neville had jumped in, “I’ve asked him to join us at The Leaky Cauldron, or even come up to Hogwarts to watch the kids play Quidditch but it’s always excuse after excuse.”
Maybe he would try to mind his own business, for once in his life.
Maybe… dance with Malfoy.
I’d have died that night if it wasn’t for Draco and my ‘Powerful Magical Core’.
Draco rolled his eyes. “That may be true, but even so, I see no tea. Get to it.”
It was a Thursday night, after a twelve hour shift running the Spell Damage Ward, when Ron and Draco had crashed through his floo, arm in arm, laughing at something or another. Harry was startled from his doze on the couch when they stumbled out.
Can I have that trademarked? I’ve read it often enough in the papers.
They don’t know it’s me, of course.
He shook his head and glanced at the wall clock - 2:03pm. With a sigh, he turned the sign from Open to Closed, and locked the door before following Luna and Harry into the kitchen. Luna was sitting up on the counter, swinging her feet merrily as she chatted at Harry about the garden she was growing in the back. Harry listened intently, breaking apart the blueberry scone into pieces and eating them carefully as he nodded at appropriate points. Draco grabbed a small container of clotted cream and a jar of fresh made strawberry jam and placed them in front of Harry with a knife and a nod before beginning his cleaning ritual. He felt the green eyes following him around the kitchen but paid them no heed - he had to get things cleaned up before going home.
The door slammed behind him, and he sank to his knees on the floor of his own bedroom, breathing hard. The guilt was crushing. It could have been so much worse, though, he reasoned wildly, his cock still heavy and throbbing between his legs. He could have fully lost control and brought himself and Draco to completion, and wouldn’t that have been shit, because he was tasked with keeping Draco safe and healthy, not sexually assaulting him because of a stupid morning erection…
Potter
“Got it. Okay then. Well.” He took a deep breath. “About the emergency contact thing…”
“But when you came into the cafe, you were you,” Draco protested weakly, “I knew exactly who you were.” Harry gave him a wry smile.
“Bro code!” Ron sputtered, and Draco scoffed at the muggle term; he had heard it a lot at the college classes. “But she’s still my sister, Hermione…”
I woke up three days later, in Draco Malfoy’s bed, surrounded by pillows. Draco was asleep in an armchair next to me. I pressed down on my leg and felt the bandages there, but the pain was merely a dull ache. He must have healed me.
“Of course I’m waking up, you bloody pillock,” Draco’s voice sounded weak with disuse, “I’ve been asleep for ages, I have … things to do.” His voice faltered as he groaned and tried to sit up. Harry quickly waved his wand and shifted the bed into an inclined position.
Harry knew it was too soon, though he knew what he felt for Draco was nothing short of love. He wasn’t keen on ruining their new relationship by saying it too soon, so he kept it to himself. Draco seemed to be the same way, not wanting to take their physical relationship too quickly. “I want to court you first,” he had said, his hands curling into Harry’s hair as he brushed small kisses over the full expanse of his face. “I want to do this one thing right.”
“Nonsense!” Malfoy threw back the last of his water and tugged Harry towards the dance floor. “Everyone can dance. You just have to feel the rhythm.” Harry looked helpless back at Alyce, who put a cover over his not yet finished drink before giving him a thumbs up.
Zacharias Smith, one of my old Auror partners.
“You’re still nursing that crush aren’t you?” Hermione sounded amused. “Well, Ginny is single so feel free. Harry hasn’t dated anyone since they broke up, and the…. What’s it called, Ron? That brother thing you told me about?”
“He’ll be with me the whole time!” Harry rushed to interrupt. “I don’t trust him alone at Grimmauld since I just got him. I don’t know what he could tear up or get into. There could be some unknown dark object that he could get his little ferret-y claws into…”
“Hullo, Malfoy,” he said quietly, causing Draco to lean forward to hear him better, “Luna has been talking up the shop so I figured I’d stop by.” His eyes fell to the button on Draco’s apron and his eyes widened slightly. “And of course, it’s your birthday too…” he trailed off, looking uneasy, but luckily, they were both saved by a squeal.
I protect those who need it the most.
“I don’t know!” Harry got up, shoving his chair away from the table with an ear-splitting screech. “You didn’t tell him either, and he asked if it was… someone specific, and you just kept being vague, so I thought… I thought…” He was breathing heavily by now, and Draco could tell that he was moments away from having a full-blown panic attack.
“It already smells so good,” Harry moaned, his face resting on his hands, looking longingly at the oven. “You let Neville in your kitchen?”
“She’s just looking out for you.” Harry chuckled, the sound startling Draco. “She’s always been like that. Always like that when I see her, too. I don’t mind staying,” he added, “I don’t have to come to your party, but I have nothing else to do this afternoon so staying here isn’t a big deal.” He unscrewed the lid of the strawberry jam and slathered a bit on his scone. Draco stared before turning away and wiping down another counter, his mind whirling. Who is this Harry Potter? The Potter he remembered wouldn’t be so worried about being welcome anywhere; he’d be right by the other two thirds of the Golden Trio. What had happened after the war that caused Potter to be… not Potter?
A finger to his lips, and the crowd quieted down enough for him to speak - it wasn’t like he could use a Sonorous in a Muggle club. “How’s everyone doing tonight?” He called, and as he thought, the crowd went insane. Another finger to his lips, and the crowd grew quiet again, allowing him to continue. “Well, that sounds good. As you can see,” he gestured upwards, “No cage! What’s up with that?” He pulled on his most picturesque pout, and noticed Potter shiver out of the corner of his eye.
“I did, yeah…” Harry’s eyes roamed the walls and bakery case, a disappointed look crossing his face. “No more scones?”
?” She indicated her outfit, which was a myriad of neon colors. Harry pressed his lips together and shook his head slightly. “That’s your answer, then. They redecorate for different nights, Harry. I don’t go to goth nights. I only suggested it because you thought that this,” she gave a little twirl, “was too
“Not exactly. But we’ve not…” Harry trailed off, and it was Draco’s turn to blush.
The hazelnut macchiato Harry finally handed to Ethan was steaming hot, and, according to Ethan, “Just as good as the ones Draco makes!” Harry smiled, bowing his head in thanks before retreating into the back room.
“Good enough for you to never let me go?” Harry challenged, his eyes sparkling.
“Quite right.” Draco raised an eyebrow, and the table went silent. He flipped the hand he had on Harry’s leg over and intertwined their fingers. “The only thing that matters is that Harry and I are together, and… happy.” He let the word consume him, and warm him from the inside. If he truly allowed himself the chance to think about things — and usually, more often than not, thinking too hard about what was going on caused him to spiral and have panic attacks — he
Draco had amnesia.
This song was a little faster than the first song Harry saw Malfoy dancing to, but it was no less erotic. Malfoy was wearing a tight pair of pants patterned with skeleton legs, and they made his already long legs look that much longer. He had foregone his fishnet top and was simply wearing a leather vest, the front open and showing off his pale torso… there were no scars there, Harry noticed, his shock evident. Maybe he was also wearing a Glamour? There was no way that Sectumsempra didn’t scar him; there was so much blood…
“Why would I want to tame him?”
The words had hardly escaped my mouth before I passed out, and I knew that this time, it wouldn’t be a choice. I wouldn’t be at King’s Cross Station with a kindly Albus Dumbledore waiting for me with a smile. I was gone, gone, gone…
Draco could feel his throat tighten. “Do you agree?” He asked, turning off the water and shaking his hands off. “Do you think this could actually work?”
Harry desperately wanted to go up behind him and hold him. Draco looked so small and fragile in that moment - not only because of the weight loss he experienced during his coma, but also because the look on his face was desolate.
The front door chimed and Draco called, “Be with you in a moment!” He glanced at the clock - it was five minutes until close. Not many people would come in this late; everyone knew they usually ran out of their pastries by this time, if not sooner.
“The bed.” His voice was barely more than a whisper, but Draco nodded encouragingly. “The glass of water. The window. Your weird plant.” Closing his eyes, he shook his head again. “I don’t want to.”
“Alright?” Ron exclaimed, clapping Draco on the shoulder and waving his wand to enchant the broom to begin sweeping the floors, “How was it today?”
Suddenly, a single flood light flared to life and focused solely on Malfoy. With a toss of his head, he threw his long platinum hair over his shoulder and offered a quirky smile to the crowd, causing an uproar. Male and female patrons alike were screaming for him, jumping up and down, ready to watch the show. He looked around the crowd, eyes lighting on Harry for a split second, before turning back to the front. With a finger to his lips, he managed to quiet the crowd enough to begin speaking.
Draco sniffled and finally raised his eyes to meet Harry’s. “Are you mad at me?” He asked, rubbing a hand across his eyes.
“This is a Muggle club, James. What are you doing here?” Malfoy’s cool grey eyes caught Harry’s Glamoured brown and kept the eye contact.
“Nothing besides… snogging, and a bit of touching.” Harry laughed. “Nothing further than that.”
“POISON!” A voice bellowed from behind Harry, making him jump. “Poison, where in the name of Merlin have you wandered off to? You’ve abandoned me, you absolute cretin, and I demand compensation in the form of supper!”
When they had been called into Head Auror Robards office earlier that week, Harry was sure it would have something to do with the illegal love potion ring that had been buzzing around the Ministry rumor mill. What he didn’t expect was being greeted with a blown up headshot of none other than Draco Malfoy, scowling at him.
“Luna…” Draco said warningly, but was met with a warm laugh and the strong scent of lavender as she came through the door.
Thanks for sticking by me, and I really hope you enjoy the rest of (this part of) the Harry / Draco meeting!
“Should he be sleeping?” Hermione appeared, holding a glass of wine. “I read somewhere that it wasn’t good for coma patients to sleep after being under for so long.”
“Not now, Hermione,” he muttered, averting his eyes from her scrutinizing gaze. “It’s Malfoy’s birthday. We can talk later.” Draco watched the exchange, more questions beginning to swirl in his head. Besides breaking up with Ginny, what had happened between the Golden Trio to cause such palpable tension?
With one last glance back at Malfoy, who was blowing kisses into the crowd, Harry journeyed back to the bar. Alyce gave him a knowing look, swapping out his empty glass for a full one.
“This has to do with young Master Black, does it?” He asked, not unkindly, and Harry nodded.
Draco cleared his throat. “She… you don’t have to stay if you don’t want to, Potter,” he sighed, “I’m honestly very good at time management, she just…”
Pulling his wand from his arm holster, Draco set it on the nightstand and shot a scathing look at Harry. “Don’t call me that.”
He made sure to brush against Potter’s arm as he completed his normal ritual of asking Alyce for a water using sign language. This time, it wasn’t just because his voice was hoarse from his performance; oh no. This was its own special performance - something he was putting on specifically for Potter.
And now, here he was, on a bright Sunday afternoon, with Luna in his garden, eating scones and discussing opening a damn cafe. “Do you even know how to run a cafe, Luna?” He asked carefully, crumbling the last of his scone into the grass for the birds.
They were interrupted by the door banging open, and Blaise sauntered into the room. “Heard my man was up and about. How’s it going, Draco?” Harry noticed Draco shrink back, a look of confusion on his face.
“Blaise called you that,” Draco absently pulled at a loose thread on Harry’s duvet.
I stood and swayed, but whatever he did to heal me seemed to have taken. I was a bit light-headed, but it wasn’t unbearable. I took several slow, shuffling steps towards where I remembered the ensuite being, before the blackness started creeping into my vision again. I reached a hand out to steady myself on the bedpost, but found Draco’s arm around my waist before I could grip anything.
Turning his attention to the front of the store, he quickly set the regular and decaffeinated coffee to brew with an absent flick of his wand before returning it to the receptacle and meandering back into the kitchen. He turned on the Sony radio he had found in a muggle shop, listening idly to the radio host talk about sports scores before throwing a song out. He knew most of the songs; they were muggle, but they played so often on this channel, it was easy to discern what he was listening to.
With a sudden surge of courage, Harry tapped Malfoy on the shoulder. Waiting until he turned to face him, Harry brought his index and middle fingers up to ear and tapped twice with a quizzical look on his face. Malfoy gave him a half smile, shook his head, and leaned in to speak into Harry’s ear.
As though he could sense that I was awake, his eyes shot open and those cinereous eyes found mine. I knew the next question he would ask, before the words even left his lips.
“I think the last time he came to The Burrow was sometime in February,” Ron mused, “He came and ate, and then he and Ginny had yet another row and he left.” The feeling in Draco’s stomach soured further. It was the first of June… Harry hadn’t been to the Weasleys’ house for four months?
He was so caught up in trying to remember what SOCKS stood for that he almost ran into Holly when she stopped outside of a large sliding glass door. “Master Blaise is through here, sir.” She gestured. “I’ll be taking my leave now. Have a lovely visit.” With a curtsey, Holly turned and began walking away, her tray held high.
“Back in a flash, princess.” Blaise winked at him and left the room for the second time that day. Draco turned to look at Harry, his face pale.
Cheers rang out, and as Harry looked up at the person in the cage, he realized that the figure was most definitely male. He had his back to the audience and was swaying his hips in time with the music, his hands behind him and gripping the cage bars. He tossed his head and the long, cascading white-blonde hair moved with him, accentuating the movements of his hips. Bending his knees, he dipped into a squat and bounced for a moment before bringing himself back up, arching his back and twisting to face the audience.
He didn’t want Malfoy knowing he was there.
This was Potter.
“I know your surname starts with a P, has two syllables, and that’s what I call you.” Draco glared daggers at Harry. “Are you even qualified to heal me? Where are your credentials?”
Yes, this is basically the exact same chapter as 1, only from Draco's POV and with his thoughts on the whole thing. You have to have both sides!
Harry couldn’t argue with that. They had spent countless hours in his room, even before they started dating. It just ended up being a comfortable area for them to relax, have tea, and discuss their days.
Robards chuckled. “Oh, I’ve heard plenty about the schoolboy drama. It’s one of the reasons I chose you three. Do you have any further questions?” The three men shook their heads - it did seem rather straightforward - and Robards stood again, motioning to the door. “Then you are dismissed. Actually…” he paused, eyeing them speculatively. “There is one last thing. I suppose since I have you all looking for him, it’s rather pertinent than you know. Draco Malfoy is an Animagus.”
“I certainly hope so.” Hermione finished her coffee and stood. “Giving himself his own autonomy was one of the major turning points in his life. He changed for the better. We can only hope it’ll come back.
Seven days. He could do this and not obsess.
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione said gently, “it’ll be done by the end of your shift.”
Oh, who was he kidding - he still had those fantasies to this day.
Harry shook himself out of his thoughts and took a gulp of his drink, eyes training back to Malfoy. He moved with a sophisticated grace, never off beat, always either smiling or singing along with the songs that played. It was enthralling, and all too soon, Harry realized the set was ending. Had he really been staring at Malfoy for a full hour?
Probably.
Wait, what?
“If you’re sure,” Harry shrugged. “It’s always an option.”
Yet again I have to give thanks to my amazing best friend
Ethan was not so easily put off. “Okay, not today. I got you. The cafe is closed tomorrow, though. Would you want to meet up then?”
“He remembers me,” Harry said stubbornly, “and he wants to come home with me, to our house.”
“I want them off my medical documents.” Draco said, and Harry noticed his clenched fists. “Any Healer forms, anything from the Ministry. I don’t want him to be my emergency contact anymore. I don’t want him to even be a memory on the pages.” Draco threw the blanket off and stood suddenly, beginning to pace.
As he approached the front door, I was waiting in the bushes.
This was entirely different.
“Yeah well,” he huffed, “You make it hard not to.” He felt Harry place a gentle kiss on the back of his neck.
“If we can’t figure something out during my sabbatical, then fine. You can talk to them.” Harry sighed. “But not before then! I have three months. I have to figure something out.”
Ron cleared his throat loudly as Neville eep-ed and hid his face in his hands. “Right then, that’s quite enough of… sometimes you may want to… I mean, look at the company we’re in, and in
“And may you come up with even more tasty treats for us to eat!” Ron narrowly avoided Hermione’s slap. “Come on, ‘Mione, you know it’s true! You can’t forget the cake he made me for my birthday.”
For the first time in as long as he could remember, brunch was not served at Draco’s flat. During their discussion the night before, both Harry and Draco agreed that telling their friends should happen in a public place; that way, if there were any negative emotions, the negative energy wouldn’t taint Draco’s flat.
“You’ve done nothing wrong.” He said firmly, “They shouldn’t have been pressuring you to answer questions, and they know it. My mind healer was always very outspoken about limits and pushing past where someone is comfortable. Luna has been good about not pushing me, but Ron and Hermione especially were not good at accepting my personal limits. We’ve come to a certain understanding now, but since you’re their best friend, I’m sure that they feel like they shouldn’t have to tiptoe around you. Neville, I really don’t think that he meant anything by his question; he probably didn’t even think before he spoke. I’m sure you know how he is.” That got a smile from Harry, finally. “Bottom line is, my home is a safe space and they all know that. They pushed too far, and I sent them out because of that. You are not to blame for that. My flat has very specific rules, just like my kitchen.”
“Potion?” Harry offered weakly, pointing to the remaining vial on the table. Draco stalked over to it and downed it in one go, throwing himself into the chair opposite of Ron.
“Whatever he did in the past, with you or anyone else, is just that -
Draco thought about that. The blueberry lemon scones had grown quite a cult following, and they had sold out before the end of the day every day this week. He planned on making them a staple on the menu, though he hadn’t told Harry that yet. He wouldn’t technically need to know about the espresso machine malfunctioning, but...
“But we’re… exclusive?” Harry seemed to struggle with the word. “I don’t have to think about you going off with that coffee guy?”
“Add lemon curd to the blueberry ones,” Draco offered, “The ones you made last week sold the best out of all the scones we had.”
Kreacher nearly dropped the treacle tart he was placing on the trivet. “Master Draco! It has been so long, sir, since Kreacher has seen you. Oh yes, the last time was years ago, when Master Harry told Kreacher, he told Kreacher to follow you, yes, to see what you were up to! Such a clever master you were, Master Draco, Kreacher is honored to have you in the residence of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black…”
“What’s that mean?” Ron blurted, his eyes glued on the red bubble.
Easy for someone like me to untangle, if I was able to use my magic.
“We really haven’t done anything.” He could feel his face reddening, and he gave Draco’s hand a gentle, reassuring squeeze.
I huffed out a laugh and watched him leave the room before easing my head down onto the pillows. I had almost fucked this up. I had almost died…
“Nope.” Draco popped the ‘p’. “Now, if you’re not going to order…”
It was, for all intents and purposes, a muggle murder.
“So,” Draco wiped his mouth and pushed his plate away. “We’ve lived together for… two years, did you say?”
Yet again, this would not have been possible without the hardcore encouragement from the best person,
They decided to go with a mixture of burgundy and vermilion for the walls, another idea of Luna’s, because she liked the energy that the reds gave off. Draco didn’t mind, though he was a little less enthusiastic about the uniforms they had decided on. He already expressed that he wouldn’t mind whatever colors Luna chose, but when she showed up to his flat with an armful of brilliant purple fabric, exclaiming that purple would be the perfect color for Draco to wear for his apron, he was hesitant until she showed him the sandy-colored shirt that would go underneath it. Finding he liked the combination, he tugged the shirt over his head and tied the apron around his middle, and modeled for a delighted Luna.
“Oh him? He’s a newbie! Seemed super interested in you.” A coy smile crossed her face as Draco nearly choked on his water. Was Potter here as an Auror? Was this some kind of sting operation?
“No, Draco is sleeping and I don’t want him to wake up and not be able to find me.” Harry sighed and adjusted his position. Floo talk wasn’t the most comfortable, but it was the easiest at the moment.
“Asparagus, I think,” Harry said, somewhat to himself, “And I know I have the mint jelly somewhere around here…”
Malfoy must have noticed it too (of course he had, he just stopped moving like an
He hooked a hand behind my elbow when I turned off the water, not waiting for me to dry my hands. Maybe he also noticed how pale my face was getting. I certainly did when I glanced into the mirror.
“I’m not sure, he hasn’t been awake in weeks.” Ron shook his head and looked at the pale form of Draco, laying still in the small hospital bed. He may not be best friends with the pointy git, but he was the best Curse Breaker they had at the Ministry, and he had been out of commission for the last month. As the Head Auror, Ron worked closely with Draco and had even consulted with him specifically on certain cases.
“Yes, but… why?”
Harry walked past him, trying to ignore his brain, which was screaming at him to pull Draco into a tight embrace and make him feel better. Once he reached the kitchen, he opened the refrigerator and peered inside. “What are you hungry for?”
“You’re trusting me to clean out your expensive espresso machine?” Harry chewed on his bottom lip. “What if I mess it up?”
Oh Merlin.
“Three things you can hear?”
“Thought we’d be seeing you a lot sooner,” Ron said cheerfully as he came into view. “You want to come through?”
Harry wanted nothing more than to pull Draco into a tight hug, stroke his hair, and not let go until the tears stopped. He knew better, though. Draco was volatile at best, and when he didn’t remember their relationship or even what Harry’s name was, any form of unwanted touching would be playing with fire. “We’re important to each other,” he finally settled on, “We’re best mates. We live together. We tell each other everything. It’ll come back to you.” Harry promised, and he knew he wouldn’t stop until he had fixed Draco’s amnesia. “Everything will come back to you. I promise.”
There was no way Malfoy would come up right next to him, right?
It's been a while, but here we go with another chapter! We're almost at the end :) I hope you enjoy this one!
“Well, I hate it.” Draco turned his back to Harry. “Makes me feel like you think I think I’m better than you.” He paused, considering his words. “Did that make sense? I believe so.”
But my hands…
Suddenly it clicked, and Harry was even more confused.
Thanks for reading so far! I'm having a lot of fun, and the relationship is beginning to bloom. Yay for friend things! xD
who you were. If she could tell, then who else is going to call you out?” The ferret yawned, and stared at Harry, the disdain palpable. “Well, I’m glad you’re fine with this.” Harry slammed the front door and strode through the foyer and into the sitting room, throwing himself onto the old, floral printed couch he had inherited from Sirius.
Maybe he would find Potter after his set and demand to know why he was there.
“She said that when I saw her on Tuesday too.” Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck, and Draco imagined his face had turned beet red. “Said something about us being good for each other.”
“We don’t want to lead people on, Harry. Falling in love with one person when they’re actually another… that’s not good, for either of you. If you want Malfoy, then be yourself.” She pulled him into a hug and broke away, wiping under her eyes carefully. “I can’t cry now, it took me ages to get this on. Get out of my house, Harry Potter, I have a rave to finish getting ready for.” She turned back to the mirror and Harry realized that he was being dismissed.
Apparating leaves a trace, too, so I picked up Smith’s body and carried it a mile or so and threw him off a bridge.
He enjoyed the goth nights to no end at The Castle - a night away from magic, the Manor, anything that could possibly tie him to the wizarding world.
Harry watched as Hermione walked away, and as soon as she disappeared with the telltale crack of apparition, he turned his full attention to the animal around his neck. “Could you be any more obvious, arsehole?” He hissed. “Maybe try acting like a damn ferret instead of His Royal Highness, King of Gits.” The ferret blinked it’s grey eyes and surveyed Harry coolly, as though to say, ‘
“And why can’t you?” Hermione countered. “Your patient is there, unsupervised, and you need to ensure his safety. I believe that overrides any etiquette that you feel you may be breaking.”
for you.”
happy. His and Luna’s cafe was quaint but popular, he had friends, he had
“You’ve been going by Draco Black for years,” Ron said quietly, “When your father died, you renounced the Malfoy name. It was kind of a big deal.”
“Do you want anything specific for dinner tonight?” Draco decided to finally break the silence. He watched as Harry’s shoulders hunched, his hand gripping the rag he was using to clean until his knuckles grew white. Something was definitely wrong.
Ethan’s face fell. “There’s no way you’ll change your mind?”
“It doesn’t
So let them see me coming out of the bar, out of my home, going for a walk in the park. What will they say? ‘Saviour Stops to Smell Silver Sage’ - headline news, let me tell you.
“So…” Harry stopped picking at the cushion and turned his head to face Draco. “…adjusted. You were just as bad off as I was during the war.”
Harry didn’t need to be in the room with Draco while he was finishing the paperwork. With a quiet excuse, he slipped out of the door and went to find Head Healer Douglas, his boss. As usual, Healer Douglas was in his office, pouring over an enormous stack of paperwork.
“Yes, I’m sure.” Harry could hear his voice waver. “That’s not the kind of relationship we have.”
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on his, and decided to take action. Cocking his head, he held a hand out, grinning. “I’m Dragon, but you knew that.” Potter took the hand automatically, but took a moment before responding.
Harry felt his brain derail and ceased all movement.
“I found it behind all the big ones,” Harry hurried to fill the silence that had fallen, “And… and it says it’s treacle syrup, so…”
Ginny liked to brag that she was the reason the cafe had so much success at opening. She had been bringing leftover muffins and scones to her team practices for so long, the entirety of the Holyhead Harpies - including the reserve players - had shown up on opening day to show their support and get their fill of scones and muffins. Draco was slightly intimidated, but dutifully made coffee after coffee and warmed up all the pastries as they were ordered so that by the time they closed at 2pm on that first day, everything was sold out and the day had passed by in a blur.
I shut out my friends. Ron and Hermione got married and wanted to start a family - I wasn’t about to stop them, and they truly deserve all the happiness in the world after what they went through.
“‘Mione?” He called, looking around the empty room. Usually around this time in the morning she’d be curled up on the couch with a book, but there was no sign of her.
“Is that a wand in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” Malfoy’s voice brought him crashing down out of his thoughts.
“I bring him your blueberry scones on Mondays,” interjects Luna, “He thinks they’re delicious. The last time I invited him to your flat, he said he didn’t think he was welcome and then spent the rest of our visit staring into the fire. I’m sure he just saw some fire salamanders and was trying to figure out how to capture them, so I left him to it.”
“You never were a Death Eater, Malfoy.” Since when did Potter talk so quietly? It was absolutely infuriating.
Something in Draco’s chest clenched, and he turned on the faucet and slowly ran his hands under the water, still listening carefully to the other’s conversation.
“We look… cozy.” Draco replaced the photo and looked over his shoulder at Harry. Harry hoped that his face wasn’t too flushed.
He allowed Potter to stumble over his words for a moment, sipping his water and watching the dance floor. Should he invite Potter out to dance, only to take him home at the end of the night? Or should he keep him wanting more…
“Since when do you talk like that, for one?” Draco chuckled, also standing. “And two, you’re going nowhere. Go splash some water on your face and meet me in the kitchen. It’s only,” a quick Tempus charm, “2am. Go on, now.” He made a shoo-ing motion with his hand. “To the loo with you. I’ll be out there.” And he turned and left the room, leaving Harry to follow his instructions.
So that was it. Harry was uncomfortable being paid. It had nothing to do with spending extra time with Draco after all. He strode over and wrapped his arms around Harry, giving him a quick peck on the lips. “We’d have to pay you if you were here for longer than 8 hours in the week. But!” He held up a finger to silence Harry as he opened his mouth. “Instead of giving
“Nothing you do or think is foolish.” Harry said, “And I want to know.”
Draco was alone in his room by the time Harry returned, but the telltale signs of a Blaise Tantrum were there - the cup of tea Draco had requested was on the table by his bed, and there was a large splatter on the wall where it appeared someone had thrown their coffee.
Horrified, Harry met Draco’s sleepy grey eyes staring back at him, pupils blown wide.  “I knew it,” he whispered, moving his hips in a circle against Harry’s clothed cock and moaning. “I knew we were more than just roommates.”
“Get on with it, then.” Draco made a shooing motion with his hand as he laid back on Harry’s bed.
At that time, I only had my rubber gloves.
“Get away from him, Blaise,” he gritted out, “Get away from him, or so help me, I’ll…”
“I’m not an invalid, Popcorn. I can understand English just fine.” Harry stared at him. Not only had he not seen the patented Malfoy Sneer in years, but had Draco just called him…
(See the end of the chapter for
“We can change that immediately.” Harry interrupted. “I have the paperwork down in my office. Who do you want to change it to?”
At something Alyce said, Potter looked around wildly, looking just like a caged animal.
“Morning, sunshine,” he said brightly, laughing as Draco glowered at him. “Sleep well?”
He may as well have cast a full body-bind curse on Harry with how still he went. Malfoy pulled his hands away and blew him a kiss as he made his way through the writhing figures on the dancefloor, leaving Harry alone and stunned.
I also need to give a huge thank you to
“You were the one who was here on Saturday too,” he said, his voice infused with awe, “You’re Harry Potter!”
“Ready to go?” Draco washed his hands one last time and faced Harry, one eyebrow raised. Harry nodded quietly, following Draco out of the kitchen and grabbing his wand from the receptacle.
“At least once a week,” Neville responded, gesturing to himself, Ron, and Hermione. “We stop by Friday nights before we go to the Leaky. He’s always invited, but like Ron said, excuses out the arse.”
“That’s…” Harry paused, thinking of how to word what he wanted to say. “I guess I can understand that. But ever since you renounced the Malfoy name,” he grinned, “You’ve been unapologetically out and gay. You flirt with Ron, with me, with your other colleagues at work…” Harry found himself laughing; the absurdity of explaining Draco’s actions to Draco himself was hilarious. “You are gay, and proud of being gay. Nothing wrong with that.”
Now, Draco was relatively well-adapted, out of his father’s shadow, living his life the way he pleased. He was still a snarky arsehole, but he was in no way a predator.
“Y-yes, I think so. Yes.” Looking up at Draco, he smiled and Draco returned the look, spreading his arms to the side.
“Whatever. Go before his set and dance. Stay after and dance. Make some
“I’m more than willing.” And suddenly, his lips were on Harry’s again, his arms around his waist, pulling him flush against his body. For a bit, the only sound in the kitchen was the sound of their kisses, punctuated by soft sighs of pleasure.
“Well, mainly I’m friends with Luna and she forced the others to be around me enough that they started sticking around,” Draco responded conversationally, “And I can be an arse if I really want to, Potter.”
The front door of Number 12 Grimmauld Place unlocked at Harry’s touch. Draco tried not to let on, but was always impressed at the way Harry handled wandless magic. As he trailed behind Harry, he glanced around at the old Black residence. It felt almost cheerful; the light from the midafternoon sun was streaming through several open windows and the house smelled faintly of lemon and treacle tart.
“My name? It’s Holly, sir. Thank you for asking.” She continued walking at a brisk pace for an elf, and Harry struggled to remain silent.
“Out for his own personal gain.” Harry said dryly, wrinkling his nose.
Being lost in the music, it seemed sudden that the last few notes of his final song were playing. He swept himself into a low bow and blew a few kisses to the crowd,and watched as Potter made his way to Alyce’s bar - exactly where Draco wanted him to be.
Draco looked at him as though he had grown another head. “You, obviously, Pistachio. Do try to keep up.”
“It’ll take me about thirty to get things in order here, so don’t worry, Luna. I’ll also walk home just to give you a little more time, how’s that sound?”
Draco waved a hand. “Flower bitch. Whatever. He told me that we’ve been friends since childhood, and that I was throwing it all away for ‘The Golden Boy’.” Draco curled his fingers in the air, placing Harry’s title in air quotes. “The thing is, Peacock, I don’t remember Blaise at all, but I remember
After Neville came Hermione and Ron - they were married, after all - and while it was awkward at first, by the end of the afternoon they were both talking and laughing with Luna and Neville, while Draco baked pastry after pastry for their taste testing pleasure. They had unanimously decided that Draco’s blueberry scones with his homemade clotted cream and strawberry jam was the food of the ancient witches and wizards, and Draco had flushed with satisfaction at the praise. He wasn’t used to it, especially after everything, and he soaked it up like a sunflower soaking up the sun’s rays. It made him feel happy, content; and he looked forward to Sundays even more, to spend time with these people who could potentially become his friends.
“I left it in the bedroom,” Harry responded, giving Draco a sly smile. “I remembered, don’t worry.” With a nod, Draco unscrewed the top of the amber-colored syrup and poured a measure into the pan before turning the heat on low. “You don’t measure things out? With like, spoons or cups?”
This was quickly becoming too good to be true, but he was going to push it for all it was worth.
“A ferret.” Harry and Ron were struck mute, and Robards grinned at their stunned silence. “Dismissed, gentlemen. Good luck.”
An appraising look swept Harry from top to bottom as Draco looked him over. “Pity.” He stood, dropping his napkin onto the table. “Are you quite sure? You look rather flustered.”
kitchen to do with what he liked. He had full creative control over everything, and that thought filled him with pride.
As he was bleeding out, he sent a Wingardium Leviosa at my knife and dropped it right onto my leg. The blade embedded itself into my femur, and nicked my femoral artery.
“My best interest, or your own?” Draco spat, his teacup shaking in his hand. “I, for one, would have loved to know that I’m in a relationship with the person who’s taking care of me, whether or not you felt like I was privileged enough to know.”
Turning back to the counters, Draco quickly wiped them down and sanitized them. He really didn’t have half an hour’s worth of work to do, but he could stretch out the walk home if he tried. Humming along to the pop song playing on the radio, he made quick work of turning off the ovens and organizing his baking trays. Harry quietly finished his scone and replaced the clotted cream and jam in the refrigerator.
Harry cleared his throat. “Er, not exactly. Our dynamic is usually more like, you figure out the flavors, and I cook the food. You’ve got a more ‘refined palate’ and I have more experience with fire.”
“His body is normal and he doesn’t appear to be in any pain, thankfully. It’s just his memory that’s affected.”
“Draco?” He watched Draco pull on the oven mitts and remove the treacle tart from the oven, setting it down on a trivet.
“Yes we were.” Draco argued. “You stayed by my side and made sure I was okay. Two months.” He readjusted himself and intertwined his fingers with Harry’s. “What all have we… done?” He carefully averted his eyes, and Harry understood the implication.
I disagreed.
Draco brought his things over that very evening, and they began to figure out a routine that worked for the both of them. Draco was high maintenance and prissy, needing things to be in their place, and Harry was more of a ‘let things fall where they land.’ It caused several arguments, but nothing they couldn’t handle. In the end, Harry was allowed a few items that had a free pass to lay around the house as long as they were picked up in an appropriate amount of time, and Draco was allowed to re-organize anything that wasn’t in its proper place.
“That happens when you’ve lived together for two years.” He turned and began trudging up the stairs. “Let’s go, I’ll show you to your room.”
“Do control your temper.” Blaise sounded bored. “Some of these artifacts are priceless. I’m merely stating that you are throwing away a perfectly reasonable opportunity…”
“Not particularly.” Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry stiffen slightly before carrying the drawer full of espresso grounds into the back room. “Now, I know that it’s small, but there is a “No Soliciting” sign on our front door.” Draco crossed his arms. “If you’re not here for a coffee, I’m going to need to ask you to leave.”
Traitor.
Harry wanted to let go.
He managed to get through the wards. I could feel him; he was under a Disillusionment charm, a strong one.
In which the cafe opens, scones are made, and secrets are told.
At the top of the hour, as discussed, the lights went down and Draco made his way to the center of the stage. He raised his left hand in a flat palm and brought his right hand, which was in the thumb’s up position, down across the palm - a sign the gaffer knew to mean “begin”. The flood light flared to life, illuminating Draco and casting the rest of the stage into darkness. He tossed his hair over his shoulder and threw on his best smile. Instantly, the patrons were laser-focused on him, cheering and jumping, pumping their fists, a slow chant of DRAGON-DRAGON-DRAGON filling the hall. His eyes lit upon Potter for a second and noticed him watching with a drink in his hand. Potter was right in the front row; he had to be less than five feet away.
Harry swallowed his mouthful of lamb and nodded again. “Yup. Two years.”
He appeared in the sitting room of Grimmauld place, his magic still crackling around him. It startled Draco, who was sitting curled up on the couch with a cup of tea in his shaking hand.
“I heard what you said to that customer.” The words burst from Harry’s mouth. “About… about not dating anyone but being interested in someone. I figured you’d want to go and be with… that person.”
Thanks again for reading <3
“Can I help you?” He asked stiffly, crossing his arms. He gave Ethan what he hoped was a disinterested look, but that didn’t appear to deter him in the least.
The crowd booed, as he knew they would, and after what he considered an appropriate amount of complaint, he knelt into a crouch and crossed his wrists across his raised knee. “Not to worry, not to worry. I still have something fun planned for you all. Who wants to see a show?!” As expected the crowd roared its approval, and he rose to his feet and spun around, showing himself off and spreading his arms out wide. “Let’s get this party started!” At the agreed-upon phrase, the stage flooded with lights and Draco was off.
“Boys have needs, don’t they, oh chosen one?” He gestured to Draco, who was still sitting on the couch, face blank. “You could always join us on the couch. You are dating him, after all.”
“Draco came to us before he came to you,” Blaise countered, “Before you swept him off his feet, before he and the Weasel became such close friends.” He turned and stalked over to a liquor cart, pouring himself a few fingers of a dark amber liquor. “He could have been head of his department by now if it wasn’t for his ill-advised friendship with Ronald Weasley.”
The seething rage that I usually kept buried began to surface the longer I stayed around the Manor.
That was all it took. Harry may have been dead on his feet, but he always did have a thing for saving people. “Move in here,” he blurted out, “with me, I mean. You can see I have more than enough room. This room can be yours. You can do whatever you want to it, and the rest of the house within reason.” Rubbing his eyes, his mouth split open in a jaw-cracking yawn. “This is the ancestral Black home. You’re Draco Black now. Sirius may have left it to me, but it’s just as much yours as it is mine.”
“What are you, my Mind Healer?”
The first time I saw Draco in person after the trials and after several murders, I should have died.
He cooked the remainder of the dinner in silence. Draco offered no further assistance, and Harry understood. It must be uncomfortable to not know who your roommate is, who any of your friends are, but remember trivial pieces of useless information, such as where the jelly was stored.
Once they had navigated to the center of the dance floor, Draco forced his thigh in between Potter’s legs and pulled him in close; one hand gripping his back, and the other tangled in his own hair. Draco was extremely confident in his body, and that translated to the dance floor, no matter if he was doing a solo set on stage or dancing with a partner. Potter was stiff, but with a few pushes and prods, he began to move. “Feel the music,” Draco instructed, his hand tightening on Potter’s back.
That seemed entirely too good to be true.
“Very well.” Pushing in his chair, Draco turned to leave the room. “I’ll be in my room, then. Please don’t disturb me, for I have quite a lot of thinking to do. Thank you for cooking the food I marinated.” And with that, Draco disappeared up the stairs.
“He’s all yours, now!” Ron mouthed to Harry, grinning as he began to shovel food into his mouth.
“That’ll be down in HR soon enough. Go home, Healer Potter,” Healer Douglas urged, “You’re dismissed for the rest of today and for the next three months. Go home and rest, and fix up that handsome young man of yours.” He winked and returned to his paperwork, leaving Harry to mutter his thanks before he slipped out of the door.
“Are you sure that’s the best idea?” Hermione asked, her hands encircling the hot mug of coffee in front of her. Harry hadn’t exactly lied to Draco; he looked in on his other two patients before locating Ron and Hermione to let them know what was going on. They were currently sitting at a secluded table in the hospital’s canteen, each of them nursing a coffee.
Having a part of Voldemort’s soul embedded into you for years will have that effect.
“I don’t…” Draco started, then snapped his eyes to Harry’s. “Weasley. The one who’s tall with red hair.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “What’s it’s name?” She asked, looking at the ferret suspiciously. The ferret gazed back at Hermione, not breaking eye contact.
I’ve always been good at following the path less traveled, if I do say so myself.
He awoke with a start, his neck feeling stiff. He sat up and rolled his shoulders, looking around his dark flat with sleep-filled eyes. He couldn’t have been asleep for that long, but something had woken him up.
“Is he keeping himself under?” He asked, looking interestedly at Hermione. “Is that why no one can wake him up?”
Ron and Hermione had their arms around each other’s shoulders and were looking at the photographer with wide smiles. Harry had his arm draped over Draco’s shoulder, and was laughing as Draco said something into his ear.
I am so terribly sorry it's been so long without an update! And to end on a 'cliffhanger'... I planned on that, I won't lie, but we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. Potter in the next chapter!
Who’d suspect the Saviour, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Ministry’s Golden Boy, Harry Potter?
You all liked it so much, this silly oneshot idea has now turned into a full fic. Hope you like chapter two!
“Do I even
I watched the Manor for weeks after the trial, watching as person after person tried to get through the wards and ‘take out’ what they considered to be a big, scary Death Eater.
to be kidding me, Malfoy,” he groaned, “I am
It was always Potter.
“What happened?” Draco began to ask, but Harry held up a hand to silence him.
“I’m a new generation elf, sir. The older generation may have had a different speech pattern than myself and my generation, but I assure we’re just as devoted to our wizard families.”
“You’ll what?” Blaise challenged, standing in one swift movement. “You’ll lie to him, keep more things from him? When were you going to tell him?”
“Give me my chart,” he demanded, “let me see what it says.” Harry handed it over, watching as Draco’s eyes flew along the paperwork. His brow furrowed, and his lips moved silently as he read the words, ‘cursed,’ ‘unknown reaction,’ ‘stabilized but unconscious.’
Harry gritted his teeth. “Don’t call me that.”
Draco started making his way to the bar and Potter disappeared so suddenly that he would have assumed he Apparated if they weren’t in a Muggle club. “Where’d your friend go?” He hollered to Alyce over the music, taking the offered water bottle with a grateful smile.
“Really,” he sputtered, “What kind of… interested?” A million scenarios ran through his head. Someone had given the Auror’s a tip that Draco was here, selling Dark items to Muggles. Imperio’d the club owner to become a dancer. Started some weird, underground orgy…
Flashing the ID he had created (he didn’t think the club would take too kindly to his Auror badge as ID, though the thought had entertained him), he was granted access and was instantly overwhelmed by heat. To his right was a little alcove with a small bar and an outside area; Ginny had told him that was the calmer area. He was more interested in the staircase to his left, which promised the larger dance floor and live DJ.
“I’m not quite there yet,” he confessed, “But… I’m definitely well on my way.” Releasing Draco, he turned and made his way back to the kitchen. “I already have most everything cleaned up,” he called over his shoulder, “If you just want to double check my work?”
“Sorry, I didn’t catch your name…?” He said, falling in step just behind the elf.
Big, scary Death Eater my arse.
In fact, it was while I was staking out the Manor that everything became crystal clear to me - about the Ministry's corruption, and about how I was still simply a pawn to them.
“We haven’t been intimate yet,” he spluttered, “We’ve made out and touched over clothes, but that’s it. We were taking it slow.”
“Tastes just right.” Harry didn’t break eye contact with Draco right away, and Draco could feel himself reacting to the tension between them. He leaned forward and gently brushed his lips with Harry’s, but as he did so, the oven timer went off.
He arrived at the Castle early, scoping out the crowd. It didn’t seem different than any other Friday, and he thought he saw Potter speaking with Alyce at her main bar. He stealthily walked around the perimeter of the club, and almost laughed aloud. It was definitely Potter, but he had to be wearing a partial Glamour. His hair was recognizable, even with the Glamoured eyes and the non-existent scar. Draco narrowed his eyes, watching as he spoke with Alyce easily, acting as though they were old friends.
,’ he thought, ‘
Or he could be a coward and stare at Potter’s back as he talked and laughed with Alyce.
He should have known better than to go.
Draco decided on a standard stage set for the following Friday. The Cage was fun, but if Potter was going to be in the crowd again, he wanted to give him something to remember. The black skinny jeans with skeleton bones down the legs accentuated his assets nicely, and paired with his favorite leather vest, he knew that it would be a show-stopping look for anyone watching.
“Yes,” Hermione admitted, “But not right away. I just wanted to check some things about timing, and nutrients, and…”
Merry Christmas to those who celebrate, and Happy Holidays to the rest! I know it's been MONTHS since I've updated; life has kicked my butt lately but I am BACK. This entire story has been plotted and I know exactly where it's going, so hopefully I'll be able to get chapters out on a better schedule.
Harry looked away, embarrassment coursing through him. Of course Ron and Hermione knew how he was and how he acted; they had been friends since they were eleven. He hadn’t expected Ron to call him out on it though.
Draco thought for a moment. The apology did sound sincere, and other than the flirting and the mishap on Saturday, Ethan was nothing but a polite customer. He signaled to Harry to begin making a macchiato, and gave Ethan a small smile. “I accept your apology. And I appreciate you coming back here; normally, even if someone comes to the conclusion that they are in the wrong, they don’t have the bollocks to own up to it. I think that says something about a person.”
“Of course I’m sure.” He waved a hand, dismissing Harry. “Now, go get my discharge papers, Pirate. I’m signing myself out.”
“I’m asking you on a date, you dullard!” Ethan’s face grew red. “I’ve been flirting with you every time I’ve seen you, I thought you had noticed.”
“Why haven’t you lot invited Potter to the flat on Sundays?” He began carefully, noticing the flush that crept up all three of their faces. “You don’t seem to have a problem with me, so I don’t expect he would either, after all this time.” The silence in the air was stifling. Maybe it wasn’t the best idea for Draco to confront them like this. He was about to turn away when Luna appeared suddenly, and just like that, the tension was broken. She had that effect on people.
Quiet voices were shushing each other, and Draco could hear the faint jostling of bodies. He stepped into his brightly lit kitchen and was immediately greeted with a shout of “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” Luna, Ron, Hermione, and Neville stood there, beaming at him, holding a large cake in the shape of a dragon. Luna must have told them that Harry was with him, because none of them looked surprised to see him. Draco smiled and took the cake from Luna, watching as the cake-dragon puffed out a smoke plume.
Friday.
“Actually, we did have some news on that.” Hermione flourished her wand and a piece of parchment came soaring into her outstretched hand. “This just arrived from Ron a few minutes before you popped in.” She held it up for Harry to read, and he skimmed it, noting that Ron had seemingly found the cursed object that went off when Draco opened the room at Crabbe's residence, and that it was contained and safe at the Ministry.
This was going to be fun.
Harry looked through the glass doors into the room Holly led him to, and was momentarily stunned. This room was a good three times bigger than the anti-room Harry Flooed into, and it was a veritable forest of different plants and ancient artifacts. There was a fireplace across the room, crackling merrily, and in front of it, on a couch angled away from the door, sat Draco and Blaise. It appeared as though they were talking; Harry could see their lips moving but either the glass was too thick for their voices to carry, or they were speaking quietly.
“That’s five. What are four things you can touch?” Harry gripped the blanket in his hand.
The day I killed a man.
“I’m here.” Harry strode into the room, his lime green Healer’s robes billowing behind him. Hair pulled into a topknot at the back of his head, a few stray strands fell into his eyes as he gazed down at the figure on the bed. “I have an alarm set to go off when he’s waking up, and it appears that now is the time.” He cast a silent diagnostic charm and watched as the bubbles of color morphed around Draco’s body, providing him with a color-coded look into what was going on. Mostly greens and yellows around his body and limbs, which wasn’t terrible, but the red that surrounded his head was worrisome.
Well, wasn’t that interesting.
“W-wand?” He stammered, attempting to take a step back from Malfoy. Malfoy just turned around and placed his thigh back between Harry’s legs.
Anyone want to guess what SOCKS stands for? It took me forever to come up with it and I'm pretty proud xD
“So what should I do?” Harry asked helplessly, “ I can’t just Floo over unannounced…”
Taking a final deep breath, he walked over to the staircase and slowly ascended the stairs to Draco’s room. The door was slightly ajar, but the lights weren’t on. Harry didn’t want to wake Draco if he fell asleep, but he knew that he should explain himself. He tapped lightly on the door and eased it open. Draco was sitting in the middle of his bed, the blanket pulled tight under his chin. His cheeks were damp, and his eyes were cast downwards, solidly refusing to make eye contact with Harry. Draco was still so vulnerable, and it made Harry’s stomach turn. He sat on the edge of Draco’s bed, close enough to reach out and touch Draco, but made no move to do so.
“I knew that’s why you came back!” She giggled, pushing on his shoulder gently. “You couldn’t take your eyes off of him last time… not that I blame you. He’s good at what he does.” Harry blushed, hoping that the darkness of the club covered his flaming cheeks. “He doesn’t drink, really. But he always comes over to me after his set is over. Why don’t you wait over here afterwards and ask him yourself?” She winked and bustled away to serve another customer, leaving Harry to make his way to the stage. He noticed the cage wasn’t up; maybe Malfoy wasn’t performing tonight. Maybe he’d get lucky and be able to enjoy himself without oogling Malfoy.
Humming to himself, he set about organizing the scones on his baking pans and placing them into the oven before retreating back to the dining room. He took down the chairs, wiped down the tables, and set each one with a little vase containing a single sunflower, right in the center - Luna said that the sunflowers brightened the room, and Draco agreed. He also knew he could do this part with magic, but he found he enjoyed the physical labor.
With all of their talking about past classmates and their own lives, there was one person who was extremely absent from their musings - the one and only Savior of the wizarding world, Harry Potter. Draco realized relatively early on that no one really spoke of Potter, only in extremely brief spurts and only when talking about the past. He had asked Luna about it once, and she had just shrugged with a sad look in her eye. “Keeps to himself, mostly,” she said, “He was supposed to be an Auror, you know… never showed up on the first day of training.” Questions burned in Draco’s mind at that, but he didn’t want to ask these new people who he still didn’t quite consider his friends. He didn’t want to pry, and he didn’t want to seem overly eager. If he wanted anyone to be his friend, still, after all these years, it was Potter - but he definitely felt that ship had sailed. True, Potter had spoken at his and his parent’s trials, and had saved his mother and himself a hefty Azkaban sentence, but that was really the last time he saw Potter. He was basically a ghost, a memory.
Shaking his head, Draco sighed and deepened the kiss. “I still want to figure that out on my own.” He said as he pulled away. “But this…” He kissed Harry again. “This is okay for now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know how Crookshanks will be with him…” Hermione said, looking hesitant.
“Froooooozen in time without your touch, without your looooove….” Draco sang as he pulled the last trays of scones out of the oven, “Only youuuu are the life among the de-” He started as he saw a blonde head whirl past him, then smiled. It must be 6:33am, since that’s when Luna insisted on arriving every day. “Luna!” He called, “Stock the front cabinets for me?”
“Friend things.” Draco repeated, amused. “Sounds good, Harry.” Finishing the last of his own tart, he stood and grabbed Harry’s plate and went to put the dishes in the sink.
It’s a calling, I suppose you could call it, if you had to put a name to it.
Honestly, it was only supposed to be a few times.
Yes, this was already going according to plan.
He had forgiven Potter, of course. Having spoken at his trials, providing his memories for the Wizingamot to pardon Draco and his mother from a more intense sentence, and even giving his wand back with a wry smile after his house arrest had ended - Potter had done more than enough to deserve his forgiveness. That didn’t mean they were friends and met up for tea every week though; oh no. It only meant that when they saw each other in public that they were civil and exchanged a nod and possibly a few words in greeting. They weren’t tripping over themselves to chat.
Merlin, but he couldn’t wait until next Friday.
He knew that in his core, knew it down in the deepest recesses of his mind.
about what’s going on with him?”
“It’s your birthday, Draco!” She said happily, “And after work today, we’re going to have a nice party and drinks and you don’t have to do anything!” With that, she turned and flounced back through the kitchen and to the garden, no doubt to urge the fruits to grow big and strong for some kind of jelly. Shaking his head, Draco turned back to the display case and slid the basket of blueberry scones in. He had some ideas for different flavors he should probably jot down before he forgot…
The music began to ebb away and a loud voice startled Harry out of his thoughts. “Helloooo, freaks and geeks, are you ready for tonight’s entertainment?!” There was an ear-splitting scream as the dancing bodies stilled and turned their attention to the stage. A ladder descended from the cage and the lights went down. Harry could see the shadow of a lithe figure climbing the ladder, though the lights were so dim he wasn’t able to discern much about the person. They appeared relatively androgenous, and they were definitely skinny and had long hair down to their mid-back. Could be any gender, Harry mused, watching them as they got settled in the cage and with a nod to the MC, the ladder was removed and the lights began to rise again as a relatively slow song came over the speakers.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he said to his knees, “I didn’t think I’d…”
“You’re...” He heard Harry gasp, “you’re…” Draco tucked his wand into the waistband of his trousers and held up his hands to show he was unarmed.
“Why don’t I come by the cafe on Saturdays right before your end of shift?” Harry blurted out, “and then we can walk back to your flat and do… friend things and then you could walk me home at night?” Draco considered this, and began to smile. Having something to look forward to after work on Saturdays would be good, and Harry could possibly help him in the cafe’s kitchen before they went back to his flat.
“As his overprotective watch dog you mean!” Blaise scoffed. “Our dear Draco used to be quite the adventurous one, back when he was trying to please daddy but still be himself on the side.”
At least this was familiar; Draco was frequently this demanding, even on his good days. “Right away, princess.” Harry said, and dodged as a pillow was thrown at his face. “What the hell, Draco?!”
“You’d better not be shitting in my house!” Harry yelled after him, covering his face with his hands. What had he gotten himself into? When he saw the stark white ferret slinking along a wall in Knockturn Alley, he knew, without a doubt, that it was Malfoy. Not that he had ever seen Malfoy’s Animagus form, but it was some innate Malfoy-Radar that Harry was equipped with. He had always known when Malfoy was around at Hogwarts, and apparently, that Malfoy-Radar extended way past his school years.
“Yeah mate, can you handle him coming home with you? He doesn’t remember anything, it sounds like.” Ron blew on his steaming cup before taking a tentative sip. “Tastes like mud. That’s how you know it’s good.” He sighed.
Harry leapt out of bed, his cock obscenely tenting his baggy pajamas. “W-we’re… I… sorry!” He stammered, fighting the dizziness he felt. He centered himself and bolted for his own room, not missing the look of hurt that stole across Draco’s face.
“Could we… could we plan something? Weekly?” Harry seemed reluctant and took another bite of his pastry. “Like how the others have Sunday? Maybe, if you had time, I could…” he trailed off, and Draco nodded slowly, pulling himself out of his baking mindset. Harry deserved to have his full attention.
After waving the last of the customers off, Luna locked the door and whirled to face Draco, positivity nearly radiating off of her. “I told you!” She said triumphantly, “I told you this was a good idea!” Draco shook his head and smiled, motioning her towards the kitchen. A knock and a shout at the door made them both turn, and Luna unlocked the door to let their friends in. Ginny had to go to practice, but Neville, Ron, and Hermione had all arrived to assist with the clean-up of their first day.
Thanks for reading! I know it's been a bit since the last chapter, but I love hearing your thoughts and comments <3
“Fancy having a drink tonight?” Ron thumped him on the back and presented him with a bottle of Ogden’s Fire Whiskey. “It is your birthday after all!” Draco took the proffered bottle and set it down next to the cake.
As Harry pushed open the door at the top of the stairs, he made a mental note to thank Ron and Hermione for everything they did for him. Draco hadn’t been sleeping in his room since they started dating, and Harry knew it would have been as dusty as the rest of the house. It appeared that they had run a scouring charm across all surfaces, and even made up Draco’s bed with the vibrant purple silk sheets he favored.
Harry took a step back, momentarily stunned. He looked from Blaise’s triumphant face to Draco, and immediately deflated. Draco looked so small, standing by the couch with his arms wrapped tightly around his middle. It wasn’t fair that he had to witness this, not when he had amnesia and didn’t understand half of what they were saying.
I couldn’t let that happen.
Sleep didn’t come to him that night, but at least he had the next few days off to think about things. He had already decided that Draco needed to live with him, and wouldn’t take no for an answer.
“Two things you can smell?”
After several moments, he felt Potter begin to move with him. Letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, Draco leaned more heavily into Potter and enjoyed the warmth of their combined bodies. Feeling Potter’s head on his shoulder was a surprise, but even more surprising was the feeling of Potter’s nose rubbing against his hair. Draco felt his breath catch in his throat, and hoped that Potter hadn’t noticed.
He had removed the now toasted bread from the oven and was flattening the shortbread dough into a pie tin when Harry padded out of his bedroom, looking flushed but none the worse for wear.
“Oh no,” Ethan hurried to set down his cup, looking at Draco earnestly, “I’d never… I mean, it’s so exciting, you know, to finally see Harry Potter after all these years but… he’s usually in the back, and I just happened to come at a time when he wasn’t.” He shrugged. “As far as I’m concerned, your new coworker made me a super tasty drink and now, I’ll get out of your hair… until Saturday. See you then, Draco. Bye, Harry!” Raising his voice to make sure Harry heard him, Ethan flashed another smile before turning and heading out the door.
Yeah, he’d probably go over to the more empty part… that would make sense.
“I’m here,” Draco said cautiously, “and you’re here, in my flat. You’re in my bed, you had a bit too much to drink and I let you rest here.” He took a step towards Harry, and watched as his eyes grew more wild.
Ah, there he was. The unruly mop of hair that was so pointedly Potter was heading towards Alyce’s bar.
Can’t let it get stale, you know? Have to keep The Prophet and it’s reporters on their toes.
“I will neither confirm nor deny those allegations, as it is absolutely none of your business.” Draco bristled, hoping Harry hadn’t overheard. “Now, one last time. Do you want a coffee, or not?”
He should have known this was going to be a terrible idea.
“He’s right,” Luna spoke up, hopping down from the counter, “Harry’s got so many wrackspurts around his head, it’s no wonder he can’t think clearly enough to answer questions. Do you want me to take you home, Harry?” She reached out to him, but he shied away from her touch, bringing him closer to Draco than he had been before. Thoughtfully, she drew her hand back and tilted her head to one side. “No, you’re right. You should stay here and we should go. Draco, we can come back tomorrow, if it’s okay?” Nodding to herself, she herded the rest of the group towards the front door. Hermione managed to break away and stood in front of Harry, arms crossed.
“Of course he does, Ron, remember that time you forgot to put your wand away at his flat and the Soufflé he was making started sparking and ended up as a puddle instead of rising?” Hermione to the rescue, Draco thought, as he lugged the large mixer bowl to the counter and divided the dough into five relatively even blobs on the floured surface. Ron had the decency to look slightly ashamed as he turned to wash his hands with everyone.
