Draco was close enough to touch, close enough to share air. Was Draco going to kiss him? Harry was going to burn up from all this wanting if he didn’t.
Harry paused in his slicing to give Draco a skeptical look.  “You were lucky I had that knife in my sleeve, Malfoy.”
“And the wine,” Harry smiled.  He reached for Draco’s arm and Draco took it, clasping his hand over Harry’s forearm.  Harry did the same.  They Apparated, landing messily in the grass in the Wiltshire countryside, the tips of the little village just visible beyond the edge of trees.
Draco never slept at Harry’s house, slipping out the door too soon, his Apparition crack too loud.  The flat always felt empty afterwards, the shower never got the right temperature.  He always found himself searching for Draco’s scent in the sheets, but it never lingered, as though Draco hadn’t been there at all.
“I’m saying it because it’s true.” Harry looked over his shoulder, nodding at the great wide history painting of Arthur and Merlin at his side, the original Muggle and Magical bonded pair. “Why not bring together all of wizarding history in one place? I never had that history. I mean, I never could have come to a place like this even if it existed, but...”
Draco looked up at Harry’s silence, taking in his wrinkled brow. “I didn’t suggest New York,” he said, “you did.”
It was a Muggle painting, unmoving, a landscape with rolling green hills and a vast blue river drifting away into the horizon, perfectly placid. There were massive columns and the remains of what might have been a temple crumbling under hungry greenery as it devoured the mark of civilization, leaving only nature, wild and free.
in those days, as though the average person really cared how the savior’s grades fared. Draco kept his head down, taking on a job in the back of an old antiques shop at the corner of Horizont Alley and Knockturn, right on the edge between polite society and the lingering shadows of the latter alley.
A bouquet of garnet carnations in hand, they stepped inside the gate of the tiny cemetery.  Malfoy Manor stood in the distance, looming and large and empty.  Malfoy cemetery was fenced in with white marble around the edges, lines of decorated headstones placed, the oldest in the front.
Harry tried to lose himself in the massive portrait of Hogwarts, resonant with shifting paint, so realistic it looked like a photograph. He tried to stare into it, to make out the shapes of people moving across the grass outside, or to imagine himself posed atop the Astronomy Tower, but his eye was drawn to an wrong slash in the paint, pink where it ought to be a deep red. From that wrong splotch of paint to the chipped corner of the frame, it was only one quick glance to the side gallery with the Mirror inside.
They’re heeled over, going full tilt, Harry’s hands raised, pushing wind into the sail, Draco’s magic curled around the rudder. They’re going to have to turn about soon, the rocks are fast approaching, but for now they’re riding hard.
It was nothing, and it was everything, and it was enough to throw their careful equilibrium out of balance.
In the water, Draco went under and didn’t resurface for a long moment. Harry held his breath. Maybe the ghost was gone, back into the depths where it belonged.
And then there were curses flying in every direction, and Draco could barely tell what was up and what was down and what was the sound of a curse smashing through cement and what was the sound of the subway train screeching to arrival. There was only one constant through it: Harry’s sturdy, warm back against his. Harry’s disguise that day had been taller than his, feminine and broad, with long black braids and a resting expression of fierceness. Harry shot a curse right over Draco’s head, missing his forehead by a hair.
“I hear you loud and clear,” Draco interrupted as he shoved a foot into his trousers with such force he nearly tore a seam.
“Runaway teens,” answered Harry. “What to do when your thirteen-year-old son disappears from the Hogwarts Express on his way to school for the year.”
“Ron Weasley,” he said out loud, carefully, quietly, watching her jaw for the most slight of movements. Something twitched in her lip, just the barest hint, and Draco narrowed his eyes, raising his hand in warning. She did not move, palms upward towards him, waiting. “That’s not it, is it?” Draco mused, slightly glad. He wouldn’t have been surprised if Harry had sent Ron his way, but the Auror — or former Auror, if he really had joined their side — would be a dangerous and Gryffindorish addition to their little team.
“Think about it.” Draco jumped up from his spot behind the helm, setting his cup on the vacated spot. He strode across the deck, till he stood just before Harry, and gestured out to the open expanse of blue. “This is all you’ve seen for months — maybe even a year. You’re exhausted, but you can’t quit because you’re on a contract. Getting sick could kill you, but—”
Draco was swimming near the bow of the boat, just a foot or so under the waterline. Harry swam closer. Draco seemed to smile and beckon him forward. Harry’s lungs burned. He swam closer. Draco moved further. If he had his wand, he could cast a Bubblehead Charm and make it further, but Draco seemed to be managing just fine. He swam closer, straining against the water. Draco was so close, but Harry couldn’t reach him.
“We’ll rethink it,” Harry said, ever the optimist. “We sorted out the whole,” he waved between their heads, “Legilimency thing in the first place, we’ll sort this too.”
that meant someone else had landed. Draco took the smallest of steps out of the alley, just enough to see around the bend. It was Harry, slightly battered and windblown, but he was alive. Draco thought he might cry as he rushed to him, running gentle hands over his shoulders, checking for any worse injuries hidden beneath his robes.
Before he can go, a Healer in headache-inducing green robes walks into the room, clipboard in hand. She starts talking about a bitter, ancient curse and a healing spell lost from a centuries-old Swiss library.
Draco unbuckled his shoulder holster with his Muggle pistol, and the knife strapped into a wristguard over the Mark on his left arm.  Harry slid the belt out of his trousers, tossing a switchblade onto the slowly growing pile.
There were moments when he wondered if it would be wiser to carry his wand anyway and just never use it. The unknown risk might be safer than the danger of not carrying it at all. But he had grown used to it, in the many months since he had held it holstered regularly. He did things as Muggles did, made his coffee, took the tube. He was more patient now, he thought. Things took more time without magic, but maybe that was alright.
,” he said, and slid into one of the booths, feeling rather like the adrenaline rush had begun to melt his brain. He traced over the letters carved into the table, decades and decades of words and names and drawings sketched into the wood and marked over like a mottled surface of history. He sipped the coffee, replaying the scene in his head.
The spell was broken, so Harry wasn’t supposed to feel distance like nausea anymore. Across Creevey Hall, Draco danced arm-in-arm with a handsome Veelan delegate and Harry thought he might be heartsick again. But Draco met his eyes, one flash of nervous grey, and Harry knew he wasn’t aching alone.
He wasn’t quite fast enough. Four Aurors in that awful black and maroon garb, skintight and modern, not like wizard’s robes in the least, tumbled out of the fire and into the room, wands drawn. Harry was moving too, in the opposite direction, across the room and over to the little side table. He was still in the habit of going for his wand, then.
Once, back on land, late at night or early in the morning, when they were both still panting and raw and unwilling to stop touching, Draco had told Harry how he liked Harry’s stubble.
Not-Draco moved even closer, crowding Harry back against the washbasin in a horrific mimicry of moments before. Harry’s stomach turned at the smell of seaweed and raw fish overwhelming him, filling all his senses.
Sweat cooling on his skin, shirt still open, Draco looked so fucking young, like he was begging for someone to notice how stuck he was and get him out of the dark before he got lost in it.
with something like ‘Deputy Head Auror Speaks Out: Ministry Corruption’ and felt, for the first time in months, the tremor of hope like a budding spark in his chest, relit and excited. “We could coordinate something, set up a series of pamphlet drops, maybe even something organized—” He cut himself off, looking up at Charlie with a smile that hit down to his toes. He couldn’t wait to talk it all through with Harry.
Harry, face clear and obvious, no sign of a glamour or a potion at work. Draco took a moment, taking it in, re-memorizing the arch of Harry’s hairline (was it receding already? or was that but a trick of the light? How many subtle changes had Draco missed in these years underground?). He took in the shadowy bruise high on Harry’s cheekbone, the way it seemed to highlight the handsome blush even more, giving his jaw that perfect cut. He was
Draco moved to mirror Harry’s position, shifting until they were back at eye level, sharing space and pillows, not enough room and too much all at once.
Draco looked so much taller like this, stretching high and handsome over him, his white shirt billowing at the sleeves.
Super Suds Laundromat was perhaps the last place that Draco wanted to be on a Thursday afternoon, but there he was, glaring down the smiling sudsy logo, a bag of half-washed laundry over his shoulder.  He should have known it would be an unlucky afternoon.
The room was silent for a moment too long. Harry peeked over his shoulder to find a flash of blond hair — Draco was turning too. Was Draco watching Harry? Harry snapped forward. He could be respectful. They never fucked at work.
, but all he could think of was the way Draco’s body rolled with the deck of the ship, fluid and easy.
“But you do.”He’s already got the Time-Turner out and slung around both their necks, muttering about a seventeenth-century shipwreck —
“Obliviate,” she’ll cast, and that’s when peace will come. The memories will feel like fingerprints on glass in his mind until they finish the whole process and wipe him clean.
Desire potent, Harry did the same. He reached for Malfoy’s hand. Like his reflection, he kissed each fingertip in turn and then met Malfoy’s eyes.
He takes one of Ron’s pallid hands between his two and rubs the freckles on his knuckles like that’s going to help.
One might think, Hallows in hand, Harry’s first instinct would be to cull the Wizarding War’s dead. Instead, the Master of Death gardened: peonies, hyacinths, florid gardenias abound. Of course, the best bulbs could be found at Malfoy’s Greenhouse, and perhaps that was the real reason for Grimmauld’s new blooms.
So early in the morning, the museum was deserted. Even the special exhibition galleries were quiet but for the soft murmur of snide whispers from the few portraits hung among the walls. But Harry didn’t bother with the other galleries this time. After all, he wasn’t there to provide headlines, or to rectify his inability to remember any other object on view.
Turning back to the fire pit, Draco cast an Incendio and Harry yanked his hand back in just enough time for the flames to start lapping at the sticks, swirling inside until it was lit and crackling happily.  Harry gave him a dark look as he got back to his feet and tossed another two branches into the flames.  It was warm, though, and the flickers of orange with the sunset burning off the last bit of daylight gave Harry a bright halo.
Harry settled against the mast, where he could see in all directions. The waves were cool and quiet, purple-black and dancing with the reflections of the stars above.
Nineteen years after their explosive breakup, Draco arrived, the youngest Master Potioneer in a century and the first-ever Malfoy divorcée.
The sun was hot, but Draco was cool beside him. “It must be,” Draco said. “Stay back. It must be trying to seduce you into the water.”
Draco stared at him for a little too long. He cleared his throat. “We had a small boat for weekend holidays. Only in the summer, and only with Elves to manage the heavy lifting. It’s inevitable that we got caught in a storm, even with decent planning.”
“Do it,” Harry whispered, and Draco looked at him. “Make the anger stop.  Please, Draco.” Harry stared at the carpet.
“That depends. Will you hold this” — Malfoy gestured between them and Harry tasted the thick desire — “against me?”
Harry Potter, owner of said red pants, swanned into the laundrette with a small army of Hogwarts students, dressed in an odd approximation of Muggle clothes.  Each had a small satchel overflowing with black robes and a bright tub of laundry soap in hand. The students all looked about fifteen, bright hair and a little too frenzied, and Draco felt a new headache setting in.
“Come over,” Harry said into the green flames. Draco’s back was to the fireplace, his long hair loose the way he only wore it when alone. “Please, Draco.”
“I was a bit…” Draco paused, running a finger over the twinge in his wrist where it still ached, “tied up.” He pressed his hands around the coffee mug, a light blue shade with white inside, staring at the swirl of black coffee like it was some sort of dark potion.
“Most people prefer to keep them,” she’ll remind him, and he’ll roll his eyes. “You might change your mind.”
Instead, he sat across the table, watching Draco’s careful hands as he read over the reference materials one more time, as he stirred the mug of tea with a wandless finger, as he put obvious space between himself and Harry.
“We can change things,” Weasley was saying. It was a refrain that Draco had heard again and again from the type of person who wanted to stay exactly where they were in the quiet life they already had. “Look at what ‘Mione’s already done.”
Draco slipped an insouciant finger through the handle of the second mug, slinging it off the table with calibrated force. He appeared uncaring, though not a single drop spilled on the pristine antique carpet. “Unspeakable Potter,” huffed Draco, the title sitting wrong in his mouth as he sank into the wide leather chair.
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco grumbled, and reached for his wrist without thinking, tugging him out of the little room and into the hall.
“Love undiminished by adversity,” Draco answered. He let his glamour charms fade, shrinking until he was his normal height and his head, blond once again for the first time in many months - could rest neatly against Harry’s shoulder. They fit just right like that.
They didn’t cry, but they didn’t need to. It was alright to be quiet, to watch the flowers rustle in the wind, and to feel Draco at his shoulder, so long as they were together.
“It’s a smart cover story, certainly,” Draco nodded, wondering if he could get Harry out and warn the others before Harry Apparated back to Auror headquarters and sent a team their way. Perhaps there was already a team on their way.
They’d been onboard for a few hours, far enough out that the coast was a blurry smudge in the distance. The boat was a different world, like they’d stepped out of all their responsibilities.
It should have been wrong. No one dances with a former enemy in the tiny gallery of the Tate. And yet, Harry’s hand settled in Malfoy’s and he couldn’t take it back. Malfoy’s hand fell to his waist, just as the Mirror-Draco’s hand did. Harry heard the music more clearly now, an unfamiliar waltzing tune, and moved with it.
Time, like rolling storms across a great wood, had worn age into Draco’s hands. His fingers, which had once delicately gripped a wand’s hilt, were grey and bent and too weak for more than holding Harry’s hand. But that was alright: their memory garden needed no magic, just stories retold.
“But that’s it, isn’t it?” Weasley asked. “You’ve ruined it all. We could have kept fighting, Harry. We were supposed to be brothers.” And that was it. The break in Weasley’s voice. “You’re supposed to be my brother.”
He settled down beside Harry, back against the mast, but that didn’t make him feel any less big. All of Harry’s attention was on the curve of his arm where it pressed against Harry’s, on his thigh so close he thought he could feel Draco’s heartbeat through their trousers.
Draco ran, darting out of the little alley and up the street before any of them could blink. He was much faster on foot now, his morning jog had done him well, and they were drawn to Harry. He heard the one called Avery shout, but it was too late.
). I pour fresh water from my wand, fragrant with the soap, clear and bloodless. “You’re a good man. You can rest now. You can rest.”
“My mother. We—” he started, and hesitated. They didn’t talk about personal things, like mothers and childhood memories. They didn’t make love like that. “Well. It doesn’t matter, I’m sure you don’t care to know.”
In the ring, they pulled no punches, spitting bitter spells across the arena. In the baths after, soapy water sluicing over sore skin, Draco stripped away his armor and sank into the suds.
They didn’t need to fuck. They could have, hands pressed against the floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the sitting room, or in the too-wide shower or in the bed with a thousand pillows.  But there was something more intoxicating about following Draco from room to room, listening to his lilting voice describe the furniture and the art and the knick-knacks and the miscellany of his life.
“Don’t read into it.” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was blushing faintly. He’d been keyed into Harry’s wards for almost a year. “You went in after me. It could have been an illusion.”
Harry shoved the last bit of green muck over the side of the boat, watching it slosh into the water with a decisive gurgle. He leaned over the edge and watched it sink into the stirring waves.
“This feels right,” Harry muttered, rolling his hips against Draco’s as they cut through the air. Draco’s hands were tight, body molded to Harry’s back. The thick leather saddle beneath their legs warmed under the friction of flying.
The room could have fit another small handful of tourists, but no one was beside him. The noise of the crowd in the main gallery felt deadened, even though there was no door to this alcove. Perhaps it was the weight of the Mirror soaking up the hubbub of the world outside.
“It’s not about this particular painting,” said Draco, voice hard and quiet in the little gallery. They were in the Wizarding Wing of the British Museum, tucked away before a massive frame. In it, Muggles and Magicals alike were milling about, a flurry of movement in the oil paint, chatting with each other and living in harmony. Animals wandered through the scene, led by proper bridles and shining silvery wand work alike. “It
“Sure, let’s question my intelligence too.” Draco didn’t bother to button his expensive shirt, plucking his oxfords off the floor with a disdainful sniff. “Ta for another nice shag, Potter.” He waggled his fingers and let the bedroom door slam a little too hard behind him.
Harry can’t leave after hearing that, so he stays and listens and worries and wonders if there’s any trace of Merlin himself left to protect them in their magic.
They walked down the small unpaved path among ancient stones, the carvings barely still visible in the aged markers.  Further back, the stones were even more ornate, great sculptures in marble and bronze looming up, casting shadows on the ancestors of the past.
“You’re a good man,” Harry turned to face Weasley full-on. There was pain in his eyes, the pain of a certain cruel heartbreak to leave an orphaned child as an orphaned man too. “Please don’t forget that, Ron,” he said, and his voice broke on the name.
“Is it coffee you’re fighting about now?” you ask innocently. You’re well aware they’ve fought through every imaginable subject over the past three hours.
Draco couldn’t help but watch as he bent down to gather a handful of sticks, enjoying the clean line of his tight jeans.  “Potter,” he said, finally, pressing fingers to his lips to contain a laugh, “Is that a knife strapped to your thigh, or are you just happy to see me?”
in, have I? You bring a wanted criminal to my flat, and look. I’m going against orders every bloody second I don’t turn him in.” Draco knew the risk, coming here, had taken it on for Harry, but it felt horrible right out in the open like that. It could all go south at any second.
Over the lid of the glass jar, eyes cast in inhuman orange, Draco was finally satisfied. The alchemical container was perfectly calibrated to hold fiendfyre. It would sit on their parlor shelf: a reminder and a threat. The unhappy fyre sparked dangerously, prodding at the lid, searching for a weakness.
Draco hesitated, his hand hovering. His breath danced across Harry’s cheek: a dare. Harry took Draco’s wrist. Brought his open palm close again, against his jaw.
It’s raining outside the St. Mungo’s room, awful and unrelenting, and it’s been raining since Harry came home to drag Draco out of their bed and to Ron’s side, and Ron’s not waking up.
“Excuse me,” Harry said, and walked straight past Draco and into the shop behind him. The very coffee shop that no Auror had set foot inside without very, very good reason. The very coffee shop that Harry would have had to be brought to, by someone who trusted him and who was in the know. Draco walked until he found a bench and sat until his coffee was long cold and his head was still spinning.
He decided to trust Ron, and Charlie, and Harry, and let his little circle grow just one ring larger. It was terrifying, every new person that he decided to trust. It was one more person that could turn against him, that could know his heart and twist it cruelly if they so wished. Draco let his fingers drift over the closure to the magical bag.
The next time, Draco was smoking a cigarette outside one of the only gay bars in wizarding London the second time he saw Harry, and what awful luck was that. He was wearing a glamour, one of his default ones, a little taller and a little broader in the shoulder, with darker hair and an off-center nose. Glamours were never quite as strong as Polyjuice, but it could do for a bit of a disguise. They were easy to dissolve and quick to apply.
He said that it was about Jill, that Hermione had gotten her released without severe sentencing after a protest had gone spectacularly badly. But Jill was safe. And Hermione was powerful. And they were safe too, tucked away until they could come back louder than ever before.
“Watch me,” Draco said, standing barefoot in the snarled grass. Perhaps there could be a distraction, a bit of hope. They were long without their wands and had grown used to the Muggle way of doing things.
“There we are.” The touch of Draco’s wand disappeared, leaving only his hands. Burning, overstimulated, and panting with desire, Harry let his chin fall forward.
It was the last bit of softness for a while. They kissed for what felt like days but was only moments, Harry’s stubble scraping over Draco’s chin, Harry’s hands mapping over every expanse of his skin. And then the fire roared with bright green flames and Draco was faster than Harry, launching over the back of the couch, across the room to where his bag was.
“I have one more thing for you,” Charlie said, “‘fore you head off to wherever you’ll go next.” He pulled out a small piece of parchment and passed it over to Draco. It was folded in the shape of a too-familiar little paper crane and Draco laughed, really laughed, with his whole chest, and ran a thumb over the crease of the wing, precisely where Harry’s hands had put this fold. “There’s a rendezvous on there, or so Harry said. Probably give him one more day under Fleur’s
He dove into the crowd, into a spectacularly tight throng of people, and stuck his elbows out, mumbling a poorly accented
“It’s nice to see you,” Harry finally said, and his voice felt tight, like it’d gone dull with disuse, except Harry talked plenty, just not to Draco.
“Much,” answered Harry, “much, much better.”  He pushed Draco down so they were kneeling by the fire, the heat of it and the heat of Harry’s gaze enough to keep him warm despite the winds.  “I like you without all the armor.”
“You’re staring again,” Harry teased.  He bent down to pick up the bag, slinging it over his shoulder. Draco elbowed him when he stood back up.
Harry hadn’t stayed in the room with the bigger bed since Draco left, so it was dusty and musty and smelled like nine months of stillness.
. Potter, sir, then! I didn’t mean anything by it of course, of course. You’ll always be an Auror in my mind. The savior of our Wizarding World still at it!” The man seemed to vibrate with energy, eyes only for Harry and not at all for Draco.
as he went. The Italians moved out of his way but didn’t reform quickly enough; the woman was right at his feet. He shoved through, only feeling mildly apologetic as he knocked an older man backwards in his haste. His daughter, or so Draco assumed, caught him and launched into an angry rant in Draco’s direction.
Harry stepped even closer, glancing just once at Draco before he raised his wand, making himself a bigger target. The one Harry had called Selwyn turned too, and Draco saw his opportunity.
He liked to run a hand against his jaw when they were sitting together in the Archives offices, just to see if Draco noticed. They didn’t fuck at work, but Harry could tease.
Though Harry was quite strong, this portrait emphasized his shoulders, making him appear even more powerful, more intimidating. Tucked behind a thin pair of wireframe glasses, Harry’s eyes were a vibrant green, the precise shade of an
Harry stared stupidly at the peeling white paint on the back of the door, wishing desperately he could go back to being crowded up against it with a hand blissfully tugging his hair and holding him in position. He hadn’t meant to say it, not till he was really sure. It’s just that his recent discovery of the phrase had sent him searching every corner of his life for the chance to say those three words.
Star Prophet reporter Draco Malfoy learned the old tricks and submitted his Animagus paperwork. No one noticed the tiny mouse curled in Harry’s pocket at all the Ministry affairs, nor dared to suspect him of leaking secrets. He didn’t need to leak them. Draco published every slimy lie they told.
Late in the night, after the moon had crossed the sky, Harry slipped down the steps and prodded Draco from his uncomfortable position napping on the table. Draco blinked at him irritably, made a fresh pot of tea, and went up to take the second watch.
There was no hot water left in the kettle on the hob, and the washbasin in the corner had little appeal. His skin crawled in a way that
Breathless, they stumbled into the clearing by the safehouse near Warminster, still clutching onto each other from the shoddy Apparition jump.  The little shack was no more than a shed, driftwood walls clinging together with hope and some rotted nails, no sign of insulation from the blustering winds, and their tent was far preferable. There were supplies inside, a first aid kit and rations for emergencies, and the shed marked the site’s wardstone.  It could shelter the clearing from any who might try to follow them.
There was the cracking noise of illegal portkeys landing. Somewhere, distantly in the museum, an alarm went off, quietly blaring with a sound like the color red. Draco and Harry turned, catching the rueful smiles of Ronald and Charlie, and Shayla (a little worse for the wear) and Jill. Draco could not remember the last time he had been in a familiar crowd. He relished the feeling of a familiar shoulder near his, the small smile exchanged between Harry and Weasley, and deep and powerful the sense that maybe, just maybe, they were not entirely alone in this.
exhibition opened, he told himself it was only the latter. The public face of the Wizarding World ought to be involved in cultural happenings. It wasn’t the reflection of the Mirror glinting on the front cover of the
“I come by it naturally,” said Harry, detangling himself from Draco’s arm and turning towards the little pile of wood, tucked up under a bright blue tarp.
Harry stomped up the ladder. It was earlier than he’d expected. The sky was thick with low, flat clouds in every direction, painted red-orange by the rising sun.
“You left me behind,” Harry said, finally, when the flowers stopped moving and the meander stopped twisting, and Draco sipped at his tea and watched him with cautious eyes. “I needed you, and you left me.”
and knew their borrowed time had run out. “We’ll do a chain of them,” he said quickly, “hold onto me. I’ll go, then you, and back. At least—” another
Draco allowed himself a bit of preening at the praise, pressing his hands behind him and smiling indulgently at Harry as he walked back across the clearing. “Of course,” he said, “there’s nothing to say they can’t track us
“Alright,” Harry answered.  “It’s been a while since we said hello.  We can stop into a shop in town and grab a bouquet on the way.  Carnations, do you think?”
Harry stepped out of his trousers.  Underneath, instead of pants, he wore a thigh holster with a battered silver fixed blade strapped on.  “Seven,” he said, tugging it off with a practiced motion, till he was bare and vulnerable and without a single thing left to defend or cover himself.  He knelt down by the fire, staring through the flames at Draco as Draco hesitated over his trouser button, distracted.
“Of course not.” Draco sat forward in the armchair, scuffed shoes on the faded carpet. He pulled an old wallet out of his dark robes and opened it, sliding a tattered note out of his pocket.
“Stephen King?” asked Harry, peeking at the cover of the book. Draco rolled his eyes and turned the page. Harry put his finger in the spread of the book. “He’s your introduction to Muggle reading?”
Draco slid even closer to Harry, until they were pressed together from the top of his shoulder down to the tip of his fingers. He stretched his toes out so that the fire would keep them warm.
“We’ve got hope here,” Draco nodded toward the heavy doors into the meeting room. “Some mediocre tea, but a good bit of hope. Sometimes I think that’s all we have,” he added, somewhere between grim and encouraging.
“I’m grateful, Mrs. Malfoy,” said Harry finally.  “If I hadn’t had to save your son’s reckless self from his ridiculous quest for vengeance, well.”  He squeezed Draco’s hand, running his thumb over his knuckles.  “We’d both be alone, wouldn’t we?”
Three days after finishing at Oxford Law, Draco waltzed into Potter’s Pots on Diagon Alley and asked — no, told — Harry the time of their first date. Six years later, the Oversight Council adopted Draco’s Wizengamot overhaul plans, so Harry left his ceramics wheel and finally returned to politics.
Harry had worked enough cases with Draco to know when he was building a to-do list. He knew better than to interrupt.
“It’s the lucky one,” Draco answered, “but you’re meant to leave it to last.” He kept his tone even, carefully, watching Harry to see what he would do next. Superstitious as he was, it would do no good to send an Auror, even if he was only in training, into a spat. He could only pray his glamour would not waver.
First, I burned the Manor, and the stench of the Dark Lord. I broke my wand. I destroyed my robes, my notes. It took six years and four specialists, but I got rid of the mark. Last of all, I watched my mask burn and left my name behind too.
"Totally revolutionized my thinking," she added, quieter. She glanced up at him, wide brown eyes too quick to make proper eye contact and Draco hesitated.
“I suppose,” Draco hummed.  It was pretty chilly, especially standing up and away from the flames.  He squatted down close, putting his hands over the fire as it crackled happily.
“I have,” answered Draco. “I’ve been practicing.” He was preening, looking more like the hawk than himself, shoulders all fluffed up in the way that he did when Harry praised him.
“The air’s different out here.” A question more than a statement. Had Draco moved closer? The distance between them felt tangible.
Draco fingered the lid of one of the Polyjuice bottles and something shifted in him and he slid them carefully into his own bag, letting them clink into the deep recesses of the magical container.
“—know what you did,” Harry’s voice echoes from a memory that veers too loud against the side of my head. Distantly, I feel my hands flash in the water, but I’m too lost in his mind to register more than the touch of his hand over mine before I’m tumbling into the memory, into his mind. I’d throw myself to his mercy again and again and again.
“Bum a cigarette?” the man asked, voice husky and low and Draco swallowed, offering the pack. Draco glanced back at the man by the entrance to the alley, but he had moved out of sight.
Draco saw Harry by accident half a dozen times after the war had ended. Those after that were usually on purpose, but the first six were unplanned.
“I wasn’t just reading it willy-nilly,” Potter snaps, and he looks genuinely hurt. “I was investigating Malfoy. He’s under watch for Possession of Dark Artifacts.”
“I don’t—” Draco started, and Harry immediately stepped back. “I’m sorry,” he said quickly, unsure of how to put the right words together. There were a thousand reasons to say no. He was not wearing his own face, and surely if Harry knew, he would not be looking at Draco like he was something worth desiring. Harry was an Auror, good-hearted or not, he was an
Theo glanced over, hungry brown eyes mapping the line of Draco’s back. He was dancing with someone, a tall young man with curly brown hair, clearly more interested in Theo than Theo was in him.
It was another day, exhausting as ever, and Harry had missed yet another rendezvous - his second in a week. This time, Draco had waited for nearly a full day, watching the agreed landing spot. Harry didn’t show, so Draco left. He landed near Naples, amid a noisy music festival, violins singing on the air. He danced through the crowd, his body moving along with the joyful Neopolitans, undulating here and shifting carefully there so as not to draw any attention to himself.
went back on land, and told everyone about it. He was released from service, compensated for his time, and probably interviewed in the newspaper. Naturally, fellow sailors saw this, or heard about it from others.”
“I didn’t know we had an appointment,” Harry called back. He stepped inside, slipping his wand from its wrist holster, into his palm. He walked along the hall, shoulder against the peeling wallpaper. The door swung shut behind him. His shadow stretched unnaturally before him.
“We got another pair this weekend,” Harry said under his breath as Draco stood back up.  “You should have seen Draco.  You'd be proud of him, he was brutal.  Well, they were brutal first,”  Harry nudged him and Draco leaned into the touch.
Draco rolled his eyes and kissed him. He tasted like the joint and the cool night air, so Harry stopped thinking about terrible headlines and savoured every second instead.
The beauty of his skin on display was undiminished as Harry reached for the abandoned weapons and various holsters to begin the day.  If anything, he was more handsome as he bound a stake to his calf and slid into the shoulder holster, checking over the Muggle pistol before he slotted it into place in the leather,  He was gentle grace and deadly violence and Draco’s, all at once.
“Well, that answers my first question.” Malfoy scribbled on his clipboard with a long hawk-feather quill.
“They know who we are,” Draco said, eyes forward. “My face is papered all across Diagon.” His recent tussle with the triad of Ministry pigs had only served to up their attention on him, and he had transitioned from “vaguely on a watchlist” to “wanted ads at every turn.”
Harry’s hands landed on the doorknob; it turned under his touch before he could do it himself. His feet moved, dragging him inside.
There will be parts of this memory that can stay: the feeling of Ginny finally, finally touching his arm and laughing with him like they were friends again, the way that Ron looked in the firelight, orange from head to toe and happy, and the brush of Charlie’s hand as he passed over a beer, like Harry could be one of them, like he was allowed to call them family.
Something pulled at his chest. Water everywhere. He couldn’t breathe. Water, so much water he didn’t feel wet anymore, just lost, sinking, spinning.
“Some folks say we should be celebrating it,” said Harry. His eyes flicked from the painting to Draco, and back when he realized that Draco was looking at him, unabashedly.
Harry scrubbed water out of his eyes, shivering at the cold. Draco was soaked thoroughly, clothes hanging loose from his bony frame.
“Potter overstates,” Draco scoffed.  “He was the real star.  One of them had me by the neck, fangs at the ready and he swooped in.”  He slipped his hand into Harry’s.  “Reckless saviour complex, and all that.  A true addition to our family.”
"Yep. The one all about how, like, the Wizarding War wasn't a blood war, but about anti-Muggle sentiments, all that." She shrugged, tapping her bitten fingernails against the door to the laundry machine.
“Are you done being angry?” Draco asked, finally, into the heavy quiet of the room. He rolled his sleeves up, tucking his wand back into the holster at his wrist. Familiar tattoos traced over the planes of both his forearms, and Harry did not stare.
Draco shrugged, too casual. "I should.” He stared at Harry like Harry was his research subject; Draco never missed a single detail.
“You’ve changed it,” Draco murmured, looking over the freshly turned earth, the sprigs of green and bright red scattered haphazardly around the base of the bench. Behind, a towering trellis overflowed with a river of mahogany-orange flowers. “You added that,” he nodded to the splash of vibrant color over the trellis, “The nasturtium.”
It didn’t matter, anyway. There wasn’t anything for Harry to fight. There wasn’t anything for Draco to lie about. It was just them, two young men stealing time under a thick duvet. Draco’s toes curled against Harry’s shin. Harry pet his hair, pressing gentle fingers in the soft spot at the base of Draco’s neck.
He expected to learn how to save lives in ways no Auror nor teenager could ever know. But there was more to it than defensive magic and violent attacking spells. There was also the feeling of Draco at his shoulder, of Theo at his back, a perfect, seamless team. A new triad.
When he could stop staring, Draco did the same.  Seven for Harry. Eight for Draco.  It was impossible not to take every precaution when it came to caring for Harry’s safety.  He slid into a well-worn pair of jeans and an unobtrusive shirt that would disguise the lines of the holsters.  Harry did the same.
Draco didn’t want to leave the train when we arrived at King Cross. He was afraid to face his father. He had written to his mother about what had happened in the last weeks of school and he hadn’t heard back from her and that scared him. It’s not normal for his mother to not write back. I told him that everything would be okay, that I would still love him even if he would go to Durmstrang. That we could write letters if that would happen and that we would find a way to see each other. What I didn’t tell him, was that I dread it just as much as him if we would not be at the same school anymore and that I’m scared of losing him over all this. Letting go of his hand before we stepped off the train was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, not knowing when I’ll be able to hold it again. But I need to believe we will be okay. I need us to be.
“Well, they still look delicious, don’t they?” Andromeda reaches for the plate and holds it in front of Teddy.
“No, sir. Dobby knows how. You need to take the Gillyweed.” He pushes some kind of herb into Harry’s hand. “Now hurry. You need to get young master Malfoy back.”
Draco and I sat on the stone steps for the rest of the afternoon in silence. And during dinner, Blaise gave us suspicious looks. We told him what I was going to do when we were back in our dormitory. None of us talked much, we were all thinking about what I was about to do. We moved to the common room when Nott, Crabbe and Goyle came in to go to bed. I had hidden the cloak and the flute Hagrid had given me for Christmas in my schoolbag. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. Nobody paid any attention to us since I was still the boy that made us lose the house cup.
So we asked Hagrid about the night he won Norbert and found out that the stranger wouldn’t take off his cloak, so Hagrid had no idea who it had been. But that was not the worsted of it, Hagrid had told the stranger about Fluffy to prove that he could handle a dragon and by doing so he had given away how to get past Fluffy. You just have to play it a little music to make it sleep.
The sex thing seemed to be important. The man from the Ministry said something about sealing the bond. That when we became one in flesh our shared soul was healed, linking us together for the rest of our lives.
“So without further delay, I will grant him a place in our ranks,” the Dark Lord says. He steps up next to Draco and holds out his hand.
Harry laughs and Malfoy rolls his eyes. ‘I don’t know,’ Harry writes. ‘Maybe it’s because they have similar meanings.’
It makes sense when Hermione says it like that. The newspaper is about fourth year and Malfoy lying to the press to make Harry look back. The badge for the inquisition squad. All things Harry rather forgets.
Quirrell continued his little speech and said it had all been a waste of time from Snape because he was going to kill me that night. He snapped his fingers and ropes sprang out of thin air wrapping themselves tightly around me.
“We’ll have to adjust our plan,” Harry says. “Check the map more often, and stuff like that. Maybe place some detecting charms inside the castle, just to be sure.” His jaw is set and he makes strong eye contact with Neville. “But catching Pettigrew isn’t stupid,” he says. “You’re the Chosen One. I’m sure that means you are supposed to go after him. Just as you were the one who had to protect the stone, and be the one to save Ginny from Tom Riddle’s memory.”
I know Draco isn’t feeling all that great. The Bogart thing freaked him out, he hates that everyone now knows what his biggest fear is. Also, it turns out that his father has filed a complaint against Hagrid with the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. All because of the silly accident during his lesson. Draco is fine, he was released from the hospital wing after only an hour and his arm is fine. You can’t even see where Buckbeak hit him. I told Miss Davis this, said that I was worried about him. But she just wants to talk about me, and how I’m dealing with lessons and stuff. I’m not sure why I still need to go there, I’m good. I’m happy and I don’t want to hurt myself anymore. Okay, I’m a bit sad that I lost my very first Quidditch match, but I’m fine. I really am and it would be so much more productive when I can use my free period to do some homework. It will make more free time I can spend with Draco on a sofa or bed, snuggling him. It’s something we do a lot when were alone. It’s the best past time in the world. I think I’ll go and snuggle a little just now.
I wish that could have been the end of our little trip, blessed out and in the arms of the man I love. But the night turned into a small nightmare. Sirius woke us up in the middle of the night and told us to get a jacket and to get outside. When we got outside we could see people running away into the woods. Something was moving across the field towards us, emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Draco muttered the word Death Eaters and when I looked closer I could see that the something were people wearing masks and pointing their wands into the air. High above them, floating along in midair, were four struggling figures that were being contorted into grotesque shapes. Sirius told us to hide in the woods, that he was going to help Moony, Tonks and Mr Tonks who already had set off towards the group of Death Eaters.
“No,” James says in a steady voice. “If he’s who makes you happy, I don’t care. He could have come from Mars and I would still welcome him in my home.”
Harry places his hand against the glass. “I miss you,” he whispers. It’s what he wants to tell Draco. “It hurts seeing you with Greengrass. Please talk to me again when we get back from Easter break.”
“Sweetheart, Hermione says a shower might help. She likes to take long hot showers when she struggles with menstruation pains. So if you want we can see if it helps.”
For a second the sky is lit up by the flash of thunder. Harry loses sight of the Snitch as he spots the creatures all around him. Did Harry fly out off the grounds that they are here? Harry has no idea. He can’t see where he is. The sky around him is dark again. Harry isn’t even sure which way is up or down. He turns and takes a guess. He needs to get out of here before the Dementors go after him. He doesn’t want a repeat of what happened on the train. He doesn’t want to feel that lost again. But he’s alone. And nobody will stop them. He will break his parents’ hearts when he comes back home without his soul.
“No, I don’t,” Neville says. His hands sign along with his words out of habit. “But that doesn’t change the fact that the little rat escaped Azkaban. The place is supposed to be the best we have, and still, Pettigrew got out.”
“He never saw it coming,” the Dark Lord comments. “Brilliant. And not a single spell was fired. So clever.”
When James looks back at Harry, he knows he needs to say it. Not for his dad, or anyone else, but for himself. He knows this is him and that it’s never going to change. It’s time to stop hiding it and pretending he might one day fall for a girl.
Harry makes it his mission to get to know Malfoy better. He asks him for help with his potion homework one day when they are both in the library. It is the start of sweet smiles and trips to the library to do their homework together. Ron calls Harry a traitor for falling for a Slytherin. Both Harry knows it’s just banter and that Ron doesn’t mean anything by it. Harry has forgotten all about the crazy vampire legend. One day Draco leans in close and places his soft cold lips on Harry. Harry’s heart skips a beat and he can’t stop smiling for days. They join each other for breakfast or dinner, breaking the hostilities between their houses. Nott ignores them all, but Hermione finds a friend in Pansy and Dean and Blaise share painting techniques like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
“I need to talk to him,” Harry says. He doesn’t look up when he says it. He knows everyone around him knows who he means.
They walk on in silence for some time. Harry wonders what Snape could say to Malfoy to get him to go to all his classes. Malfoy hasn’t been all that happy with Snape of late. Not since Snape started to sign in class.
“You need to forget about him,” Neville says. “You’re too young to drop out of school and start a professional Quidditch career.”
Harry follows him and sits down at the table in front of Malfoy. He takes out the note he scribbled last night. Well, the fourth or fifth one he wrote. They all sounded so lame. So, Harry has gone for simple in the end. Just the words: ‘We’d like to help. You can copy Hermione’s notes.’ No elaborate explanations about how Harry understands because his uncle is deaf. Because the truth is, Harry doesn’t understand. He doesn’t get why Malfoy’s situation isn’t known with the teachers. Or how he got by the last two years at school. And how does Malfoy even communicate with his parents? It’s all so confusing. The only thing Harry does know is that he can’t stop thinking about it and that he needs to act. He needs to do something.
“Then why are you leaving me alone? What other reason is there to let me go if it’s not because you hate me?” Draco shivers. He’s thought it a million times and saying it out loud makes it even more real. Harry must hate him. There is no other way this can end.
The first glass of wine they took after it happened didn’t taste as nice as it should have. Tears and broken words accompanied it. Just like the first time they got naked, and Draco buried himself deep into Harry. It had been sweet and painful. And Harry feels helpless. He doesn’t know how to comfort Draco, or even himself. Something is missing with everything they do.
“Fine, I’ll do it alone then,” Harry says. He puts down his half-eaten sandwich, stands up and gives Hermione a begging face. She always wants to stand up for others. Harry doesn’t get why she isn’t already forcing the school to start teaching BSL or something. Only Hermione just shakes her head and doesn’t come to the rescue.
“Nothing, Harry,” Neville says. “But Hermione does have a point. We don’t know Malfoy. And Remus promised he would help. We can let him deal with it. We’ve got enough on our plate as it is.”
Harry watches as Draco’s cheeks turn red as he ducks in time for the retaliation. His hair flows around his face and he seems to enjoy himself. There is a twinkle in his eyes as he throws another snowball at Ron. Harry smiles and tries to ignore the aching to move and take Draco in his arms and kiss his pink lips. He glances away from them and sees that Neville doesn’t pay their friends any attention. He stares at the Shrieking Shack as if it holds all the answers.
Most surprised is Harry about Iris. She doesn’t say a thing about Harry’s crush, or about the fact that he told her that he’s gay. She just said she didn’t care and that was it. But she did take Draco apart one morning to teach him signs that are related to personal hygiene. When Harry asked her about it, she declared that someone had to teach him. That if that was up to Harry, Draco would never know how to communicate about his hair struggles. And it would be a shame if his beautiful golden hair would suffer because of Harry’s lack of interest in taking care of his own. Harry wanted to be offended, but he agreed with how beautiful Draco’s hair is and that it would be a shame if Draco wouldn’t learn how to communicate about it.
With care, Harry turns Neville around. His eyes are closed and his face looks pale. Harry bends over his head and looks for any sign of life. A soft wind comes from Neville’s nose. He’s breathing. Harry drops his head on Neville’s chest for a second. “Thank Merlin,” he says. Neville is alive. Hurt and unconscious, but alive. James and Lily aren’t going to kill Harry. They’ll still be mad as hell when they hear what happened, but at least they won’t be able to blame Harry for losing Neville.
But on the train, he was fast asleep and that was good enough for us. Draco pushed me on the other seat and knelt on my lap before his lip found mine. We kissed for a long time. It’s like the world disappears around us when his lips are on mine. It’s the best feeling in the world. We didn’t notice the train slowing down or stopping at all. When we met up with the others again they told us how they fell over each other when the train suddenly stopped and how scared the ladies were when the lights went out. We only noticed that something was wrong when Professor Lupin asked who was there. I opened my eyes and noticed it was all dark around us. Draco wondered out loud if we had been snugging all the way to Hogwarts. Professor Lupin snickered and told him we hadn’t arrived but had made a sudden stop along the way. Draco hid his face in the crook of my neck and I petted his hair. I’m sure his face was just as red as mine, being caught by a teacher snugging is not something you want to do.
Charlie opens the door when they reach it. Teddy asks about the dragons in Romania and throws his jacket and scarf towards Harry so he can follow Charlie into the living room to hear the story of how Charlie has gotten his latest scar. The friendly noise of people flows into the hallway from the living room. Harry shakes his head with a smile on his face while he places Teddy’s jacket on the pile of coats already in the hallway.
We had to get up so early to take the Port-key. It was just for me and Draco, all the others could apparate but they said it would be more fun if we would all go together as a group. Tonks regretted that decision in the morning, complained that it was too early, that her head hadn’t recovered yet and Remus jokes she should have drunk less. It sounded like he, Sirius and Tonks had a little party last night when we were already in bed.
“Dudley goes to Smeltings Academy, he’s the top of his year. He takes after his father, he does. Caveat Smeltonia.” Vernon lets out an egotistical chuckle, the kind of chuckle someone makes when they’re very, very proud of himself. It makes Harry’s blood run cold.
Harry’s face went pink at the idea, but he agreed nonetheless. He could smell that Draco needed that bath more than Harry needed to avoid seeing Draco’s half-naked body and he knew to put aside his modesty like this and asking for help was a challenge for Draco so he wouldn’t do it if he didn’t have to.
“Sorry about the yelling earlier, I'm not sure if either of you heard-” Draco started before rudely being cut off by a far too eager James.
Harry finished his tea before clearing the table, collecting everyone’s plates before making his way to the sink to wash them.  Draco thought this was strange because he got up and followed Harry, watching him clean.
Ron finally was able to open his last present form Lucius,  after gently peeling off the wrapping paper what was revealed was a small green box. Everything about it made him feel as if it was precious so he treated it as such, ever so slowly taking the lid off and placing it aside. Inside the box revealed to be a necklace with a large snake pendant on it, Ron had never held something so
Ron placed his forks down ever so gently, taking a deep breath and straightening the napkin that sat on his lap while contemplating his next words. "Well, I actually wasn't put into Gryffindor.." Before Ron could even finish his sentence his mother cut him off, taking her napkin and hitting him across the face with it. "Don't make jokes like that, Ronald! "  Fred cut her off, a stupid smile on his face. "Ma... he isn't jokin, you know. He's-"
It’s a few hours later and they’ve just arrived at Diagon Alley. The rush of Hogwarts students bustling about flicks a switch in his mind and brings him back to reality. He and Draco will be going back to Hogwarts in a matter of days, he’ll see Hermione, Ron, Hagrid and Dumbledore again and things will go back to normal again- but how could they?
" The last thing Ron wanted was to be placed in Gryffindor, he was imagining himself throwing the hat across the room and turning it into a slug, only to step on the slug- "Slytherin!"
5 minutes later Harry decided the tub was full enough so he fetched Draco, helping him up once again, guiding him to the bathroom. “ Can you get into the tub by yourself?”
Draco steps out of the room,  hands behind his back, observing the pictures along the hall. Most of them are of significant times in Harry’s life, newspaper articles back from when he was a seeker for the Appleby Arrows. Draco remembers seeing Harry in person, he played so well and looked so graceful while doing it...
“ Do we have a deal?” Albus smiled charmingly, holding his hand out once again to Petunia rather than Vernon who, surprisingly to Harry, actually took it. “ Is there anything else we should know?”
Not only had his bed duplicated but so had his wardrobe, and now there were two of them. He looked through the one on Draco’s side of the room out of pure curiosity and found it full of clothes that were exactly to Draco’s taste. He then a-lined it to his wardrobe so see if anything had changed and that was also the case; it was full of new clothes, a purse full of muggle money, a book and a small letter.
“I slept in.”  Draco walks over and stands beside Harry, and now they’re both looking at one another in the reflection of the mirror that hung on Harry’s wardrobe door.
When Harry stands again he turns and his eyes lock with Draco’s who’d been watching him the whole time. Confused, Harry raises an eyebrow but his expression quickly changes when Draco walks towards him, pressing him against the wall beside the door. Harry’s voice hitches as he scans Draco’s face for any sign of emotion, trying to work out what he’s thinking and feeling but he can’t- a part of him feels like Draco is going to hex the daylights out of him,  or… or… His thoughts are lost in Draco’s cold, silver eyes for a moment, chills running down his spine. Draco looks like he’s about to say something but instead drops onto his knees, Harry’s eyes follow.
They pulled away before the kiss got too heated, Harry being the first to speak “ Wanna watch  Telly?”
Without questioning the other Harry lies down next to him, facing him with a shy smile on his face. To think only two weeks ago Harry would have preferred to kill Draco than snuggle with him was bizarre looking back now, and Harry wouldn’t have it any other way.
Harry showered fast, as usual, washing his body head to toe, spending most of this time on his hair. Towards the middle of the previous school year, Harry had brought up his hair with Hermione, noticing that she’d arrived at Hogwarts that year with a head full of consistent curly hair. She taught him
Without saying a word Draco suddenly stands and speeds towards the play area, opening the door and letting himself in. Before Harry can even react he hurdles himself up into the slide and disappears. Huh.
Harry’s spiralling thoughts were cut off when Draco pulled Harry along by his sleeve, almost causing Harry to fall over.
Ron opened his present, the softer one first, inside was also a scarf, this one being a Slytherin green silk, plan and fashionable, it really did have Draco written all over it. What Ron had learnt throughout his time with Draco was that he really, really cared about his appearance and it was kind of annoying. Draco took an hour to get ready each morning, having to wash his face with a cocktail of different potions and then comb his hair five times until it sat just how he wanted it to and it really annoyed Ron.
The rest of the day went on without any issues, after lunch they decided to head home and quickly after that Draco went to sleep once more. Harry spent the time struggling to finish his homework, constantly being distracted by Draco who spoke in his sleep. Seamus speaks in his sleep but what he says is usually inaudible, or its only an embarrassing confession towards his friend dean. In Draco’s case, however, his speaking was panicked, talking of terrible things that Harry can’t understand.
His attention is drawn away from his homework when he hears an unfamiliar noise outside, sounding like there were multiple standing in the front garden. Grabbing his wand from his bedside table and tucking his books under his bed he slowly makes his way out of his room, following the hushed voices. He walks down the stairs and to the front door, now finally being close enough to hear that there were, in fact, multiple people outside, exactly how many Harry wasn’t sure. He sat on the doorstep, ear to the door, wand in hand, listening.
this chapter is a bit of a mess, sorry about that! its just a little bit of character building. the next few chapters will take place yearly,  things will start moving at a faster pace. make sure to leave your feedback, it means a lot and will motivate me to continue writing.
Harry paused to think about it, he’d never paid attention in History of Magic but he’d certainly heard the name Grindelwald brought up many times. “Oh.”
“True love, right? It conquers all or something, yeah?” Harry says clueless to Draco’s attitude, Draco simply rolls his eyes at the others' comment and continues the conversation.
The pair left the room, walking back downstairs in complete silence leaving Harry to fetch the Dursleys. Waking them up wasn’t an easy task, he’d almost had a lamp thrown at him but thankfully Harry mentioned Dumbledore being in the house before Vernon had the chance.
“-Both Harry and Draco have had their underage magic ban lifted, they can protect themselves however they deem necessary.” Shacklebolt had joined in the conversation while Harry wasn’t paying attention and was now glaring down Vernon as he spoke leading  Harry to decide right then and there that he likes Shacklebolt quite a lot.
“Okay.” Harry got up, running a hand through his curly hair and a-lining it to the front door. Once there he bends over to slide on his shoes, black and white, absolutely tattered and far too big. They were bought for Dudley over two years ago but Dudley decided he hated them instantly, it was one of the best days of his life.
“You think too little of yourself, Draco. You’re so confident and you can command a room with ease, you’re powerful and everyone knows it. You might think that people fear you because of your father, or because of the dark lord, or I don’t know, because of your godfather but that’s not true. You hold yourself in such a glamourous, effortless sort of way, you seem unaffected by the weight that I know is on your shoulders. I wish I could be like you, be so powerful and dominant, a leader. I’m not a leader. “
Harry bolted downstairs, wand in hand without a second thought. He almost tripped as he turned a corner on the staircase but continued regardless. Arriving in the living room, Harry paused, grip on his wand loosening as he heard a commotion in the kitchen. Nothing out of the ordinary at all.
Sirius laughed, sinking into the red and gold chair he sat on, hands on his stomach. “He confided in me- I told him to make the first move. Argumentative he was but
with someone after they’ve told you their parents used to read them stories about you when they were a baby. I tried the muggle scene too but it’s just too wild for me. I’m… Old. “
Draco waves his wand over Harry’s shoes, murmuring a few spells Harry hasn’t heard of before. Harry’s shoes slowly start to fix themselves, shrinking to fit his feet, the holes and tears resewing themselves and the colour seeping back to them. By the time Draco was done they looked better than they had when they were new.
Drawn forward by something like magnetism, Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s, no idea how to form the right words, no idea how to express the same feeling without sounding like an utter fool. Harry moved with him until their noses brushed against each other. Draco let his nose press against Harry’s, the tip of it rolling over the arch of Harry’s nose. And they were kissing, so gently, as if either of them might break. Draco thought that he might just break apart.
“Then I'm not joking. Your grandfather is the creator behind sleekezy’s hair potion, that's where your family’s money comes from. Sheesh. “ Draco rolled his eyes, crossing his legs, taking a bite from his jam sandwich.
The wizarding world is generally rather accepting to queer men in the same way they are to muggle-borns, but purebloods despise them. You can’t continue your bloodline if you can’t have kids and all that. My Uncle, Sirius Black, was disowned because he was caught with one of his friends when he was sixteen, my mother talks about it often. “
There sat in the centre of the room was no one other than Draco Malfoy. He looked awful, bleeding from his temple and nose,  dark bruises covering every piece of skin that was visible to Harry, eyes sunken in and black. On closer inspection Harry noticed that Draco was also extremely dirty, hair curly and matted, fingernails black with grime, robes tattered- Harry, for the first time in his life, felt very, very bad for Draco Malfoy.
Harry retaliates, kissing Draco again, almost knocking the other off his feet their lips collide. This kiss was just as romantic as the one prior but lasted a lot longer. and only ended when Draco pulled away for air.
Draco was now facing Harry, a smug look on his face. “Harry Potter, the boy who lived, best friend of Albus Dumbledore- entirely unaware of the man’s sociopathic ex-lover. You’ve got to be joking.”
It was now  Christmas, Ron was home for the first time in four months. Was he happy about it? Yes, he was so happy. He missed his mother, father and younger sister a lot along with the comfort of his private bedroom and waking up to the sound of a rooster each morning, something he had previously hated.
Harry scanned Draco’s face for a reaction, expecting him to be mad or even thrown into a state of misery but that simply wasn’t the case. Draco’s mouth curled into a large, cheerful smile and he even laughed a bit. A wave of relief rushed over Harry’s body and he went back to eating.
He’s surprised to see Draco’s still in their room, fully dressed, fixing his cuffs in the mirror all while eyeing himself. To be fair, if Harry looked like Draco he’s sure he’d spend days looking at himself in the mirror too.
All in all, it was addictive and the fact he spent the whole time with Harry basically in his lap only made it better. Harry was lying sprawled across the couch, his legs in Draco’s lap, hugging onto a cushion as if it were a stuffed bear. Draco spent the time with his hands on Harry’s legs, gently running his finger up and down Harry’s left leg, occasionally letting that same finger ride dangerously far up Harry’s inner thigh.
Harry moves to stand in front of Draco, eyes still on their hands, his face crimson red and eyes bright. When he finally gathers the courage to look up he’s taken aback as he feels something he hasn’t felt before; a pair of two, soft lips pressing against his.
Ron looked up from his dinner plate, noticing that Crabbe was just about to take the last chicken drumstick with his grubby hands. There was no way he was going to let that chubby prat take the last, beautiful, juicy piece of chicken. Ron quickly reached over, stabbing  Crabbe in the hand with his fork before taking the last piece of chicken and placing it on his plate. The rest of the table looked at him with fear and Ron loved every single moment of it.
Hermione bursts into a laugh, another faint but rowdy laugh come from the background- Definitely Ron.
Draco cups Harry’s face between his hands, a small smile on his lips. “She sounds like a Slytherin if I've ever heard one.”
good. The caramel? Stunning.” Draco’s face had light up at the very first bite of their Sunday and has continued to stay that way the whole time. Seeing Draco like this only reminds Harry that he is very much in love with Draco, his heart fluttering at the other’s smiles. Draco Malfoy is
“This place looks horrendous,” Draco murmured, stopping in place to get a better look. “It reminds me of Durmstrang, but far more insignificant.”  Harry laughed at the insignificant comment, nodding in agreement. He’d never seen Durmstrang, but he knew Stonewall was certainly nowhere near as important as the great Scandinavian Durmstrang institute.
Now, twenty years older and a whole lot wiser he understands. Draco was the son of one of Voldemort’s favourite side pieces and an accomplice in the murder of Albus Dumbledore but none of that could ever change Harry’s opinion of the blonde man stood beside him- Draco Malfoy is NOT a bad person.
“ It’s too dangerous for him there, he needs to go somewhere you-know-who won’t be able to find him.”
Harry sat down on the couch opposite Draco,  his eyes plastered on him. There were now tears in Draco’s eyes and he hadn’t looked up, not even once.
“Oh.” Harry held his hand up towards the table, mumbling. “ Accio wand.” His wand flew into his hand and he held it over the pile of plates and cups in the sink, mumbling again. “ Scourgify.” Harry felt stupid, he’d forgotten about magic in front of Draco of all people.
They stand in Harry’s living room, a cosy, warm place- or in Draco’s opinion, a cluttered nightmare.  The room in itself was large, but it’s walls are covered in paintings and bookshelves, every corner containing a green plant or ‘vintage’ lamp.
“Potter…” Draco croaked, his voice sounding raspy and worn out as if he’d been screaming for days straight. Harry turned back around, knowing that his excitement would have to wait as, despite how little he wanted to, he had to take care of Draco’s wounds. “Could you run me a bath? Please?”
He escorted the other up the flight of stairs and to his bedroom in complete silence, the air around them thick and awkward. Harry knew exactly what he wants to say, he wants to ask Draco what the hell happened to him but he’s not an idiot. Professor Dumbledore avoided the subject, likely because it was uncomfortable for Draco to talk about.
Harry’s mind goes to all sorts of places as Draco drops to his knees. What is he doing? He looks so good down there… Harry fidgets with the bottom of his jumper, pulling it down over his bottom and front as soon as he realizes what Draco is doing. Fixing his shoes.
Harry, without thinking, began to speak. The words ran out of his mouth as if someone had opened the faucet on his heart and let all of his feelings finally flow free.
They walk side by side for what feels like hours, first to the park Harry would hang out at frequently when he was younger- Until Dudley decided to harass Harry enough that he didn’t want to anymore, then they walked past Stonewall High, the secondary school Harry would have gone to if it weren’t for Hogwarts.
Draco looks a lot better now, he thought. Hair still curled but clean, skin gleaming asides from the bruises, cuts, scars and gashes. It’s in may ways impressive that Draco looks as good as he does being so wounded, but then again Draco always looks good. That's no surprise.
Did he run off to hide and apparate away?  Why wouldn’t he have told Harry where he was going? Harry’s mind became clouded with thoughts, conspiracies of Draco’s evil grand plans and what horrible things he could be doing at this very moment.
It got better. After lunch, Draco demanded they go for a walk in a park just outside of Diagon Alley and Harry agreed. They walked for a while just as close as before but when they finally were out of sight Draco took Harry’s hand in his.
No longer hungry he vanished his sandwich into oblivion and laid down on his side, facing away from Draco, wishing the other would shut off the lights but too unmotivated to even bother asking. It wasn’t long until he fell asleep, exhausted from the traumatic events of the night and nervous about the upcoming day.
They’re just walking by Florean Fortescue’s, the ice cream parlour Harry had spent a large portion of the summer prior eating at. “This place is really good, I came here every day when I was staying in the leaky cauldron.”
“Your aunt? The one that’s currently ill? Pfft.” Draco laughs before continuing to question Harry. “ Why did the Ministry cover you like that? It seems rather unorthodox.”
“ The boy’s been through so much, I don’t think this is the right place for him.” A male voice said, sounding concerned for whoever he was speaking of. “ No, Kingsley. If he were anywhere else he’d be in danger, this is the safest place for him. “ Sounded a different voice, this time female.
These thoughts don’t stop as they sit down in their compartment. Ron and Hermione are both excitedly talking to one another about something called the Tri-Wizard tournament but Harry isn’t listening, he’s mourning.
The pair stand at once and Harry guides Draco through the house, they pass a small staircase and head down a hallway covered with even more pictures, these far less pretty than the ones on the walls in the living room. Draco takes a particularly long time scanning a certain muggle portrait, in it a fat little man, round in shape and pink in the face and seemingly his wife- a tall, thin woman, reminding Draco of a stick. Between them sits a fat little boy, cheeks rosy like his father, brunette like his mother. He seems unhappy. Who on earth could they be?
Before Draco has time to ask Harry he’s already gone, sweeping into a room on their left. The room is large, only containing a bed in its centre, a small fireplace, a single bedside table, a wardrobe in the corner and a….  A mirror on the
“H- Potter, I need help getting out. Please. ”  Harry stood, grabbing his wand from the drawer he kept it in and stepped into the bathroom, taken aback by the steam.
Finally, he reached his office and woke a sleeping Sirius up to tell him the news. “Sirius, hey, you won’t believe what happened. It’s extraordinary, honestly. Out of this world type stuff. “
As the main pile of presents grew smaller and his personal pile of presents grew larger they revealed eight presents wrapped in a shiny,  almost iridescent, green paper. Ron had never seen presents that were wrapped so perfectly in such a beautiful paper, he quickly picked up one of the smaller parcels up to read the name on the tag, he assumed they were for  him  because of  their Slytherin aesthetic  but a large part of him couldn't believe that anyone would go to this effort for him and couldn't think of anyone who cared about him enough to get him a present.
Draco and Harry are friends now, true friends. They’ve slept in the same bed and accidentally shared underwear more times than Harry would like to admit.  Will Draco simply go back to hanging out with his foul Slytherin army? Will he continue to bully Harry and his friends as he did before? Or will he instead befriend Hermione and Ron? How will they react to their new friendship?
i wrote this fanfiction originally back in February of 2017, i've come back to it now and have re-written the first chapter. i don't have any promises that i'll finish it this time but my writing has gotten better and the concept is just too good for me to leave. your feedback means a lot to me, i need critiques on my writing and suggestions for the plot to continue this. if you've re-read it a year later, thank you for sticking around!
“This is Draco Malfoy, a friend of Harry’s. He urgently needs a place to stay just until  Hogwarts reopens and this house is the only place safe enough, we know you’re both lovely people-”
Draco nods, arms folded over his chest, a small smile creeping over his face. There’s something very cute about how flustered Harry gets, especially in the situation they’re in. Draco places a hand on Harry’s shoulder and gives it a little squeeze before walking past him, swooping around the corner and sliding into his room.
Four short months had passed since Ron was placed into the Slytherin house and a lot had changed. Apparently, befriending Draco Malfoy gained you a lot of respect in the world of the Slytherins, he could do anything he wanted in front of Slytherin teachers and in their classes, the other Slytherin students wouldn't dare to bother him too. He still spoke to Harry and Hermione but didn't want to ruin his Slytherin reputation since according to a few older students, Slytherins were to never associate with Gryffindors... Draco refused to speak to Harry and whenever he did it was only to blurt out a bitter comment, but he'd always stare at Harry when  Harry wasn't looking, Ron really felt that without this feud Harry and Draco could be friends.
Harry seems to catch Draco staring at the porn-mirror and clears his throat to grab his attention. “ It was there when I bought the place, I've just never been bothered to take it down. Sorry.” He turns again,  going back to violently fixing the sheets on the bed.
After spending far too long deciding Draco ordered for the pair of them, just the normal burger meals with sides of fries and soda. When the cashier asked for money Draco held out his hand to Harry who handed over more than enough without a question.
“Let smeltonia beware?” Draco asked, an eyebrow raised. Harry knew that look well, it’s the kind of look Draco gives someone when he finds them to be stupid but doesn’t want to show it for whatever reason, he’d seen it given to many teachers in the past. Besides Snape, of course.
Albus crept up on Harry and placed a hand on his shoulder, leaning down to whisper into Harry’s ear. “ You need to take care of him, Harry. He did something very, very brave and for it, he’s been through a lot. “
Percy, George and Fred all got scarves of their own, Molly had received a gorgeous little ring with a small diamond on it and Arthur had been given a pair of leather driving gloves that he clearly was happy about. No one in the family had a complaint or a question has to why they were being given gifts from the Malfoys, or at least not for now.
“ Well, shit Hermione. The kids just floo’d to Ginny’s house with Scorpius- how is she going to  look after all of them on her own?” As if a switch is flicked in Harry’s mind he begins to panic, pacing around the room.
Harry nods his head as Draco speaks, running a hand through his head of wild hair, thinking of how perhaps Draco was meant to be a Gryffindor all along- he’s certainly brave enough. “Well, you’re right about that.” Harry exhales through his nose in a half-hearted, embarrassed laugh before continuing. “Your turn.
Draco didn’t come back. It was time to board the train and Draco is nowhere to be seen. Following both Hermione and Ron, being pushed by the crowd Harry tries his best to see if he can spot Draco in the distance- he can’t.
Ron was silent for the whole car ride, frustrated with how cramped he was being seated in between George and Fred he zoned out of the conversation to just think and eventually nap. By the time they were back at the house Ron was fully rested and ready to face whatever backlash he'd receive thanks to his house but it wasn't brought up. He walked inside, greeted by a hug from his mother that almost broke several bones, treated with a pre-Christmas gift and then informed of all the Weasley drama he had missed out on while away at Hogwarts.
Grocery shopping was strange, to say the least, neither he or Draco had done such a thing before so they were lost. Between explaining how muggle checkouts work and the way Draco grabs Harry’s wrist to gain his attention, Harry was very distracted. The shopping trip was a fail, in the end, they only ended up purchasing a bunch of candy and a whole, raw chicken. Neither of them knew how to cook.
“Yes, father wanted me to transfer by the end of the third year. We went there in person, he spoke to the headmaster who wouldn’t allow me to enrol because we lived too far away, and because of our reputation. “  Harry didn’t know how to reply to that without offending the other, but he didn’t have to because Draco continued. “ Did you know Gellert Grindelwald went to Durmstrang?”
He stops when he feels his attacker slide his glasses back onto his face, yelling out a fast “ I got you!” Harry’s eyes adjust to see a giant,  cocky smile on a pale, angular, but breathtakingly flawless face. Draco.
Harry left Draco to bathe by himself, sitting down on his bed. He was planning to continue doing his homework but it seems extremely unimportant compared to everything else that had happened tonight, so instead, he searched his now expanded room.
Dragging his eyes away from the scene he remembers that he’s holding his wand, Vernon must have been watching Harry because he seemed to notice at the very same time. “What did I tell you, boy? Keep that thing locked up! There will be no filthy magic nonsense used in my household, I don’t care if your friend is here. .”
“Gellert Grindelwald? One of the most powerful dark wizards ever, second only to Voldemort? Leader of the Wizarding Revolution? He wanted to enslave muggle-kind?”
The two enchanted plates slowly lower themselves in front of Harry with two perfectly made jam sandwiches placed on top of them. He takes the plates and walks for the stairs, climbing up them, eager to see how Draco was now that his wounds were healed.
Draco looks up from his book, Harry only now notices that the other’s hair was neater than before but still very, very wavy. He likes Draco’s wavy hair, it looks very charming- certainly better than he does with his hair straight.
Harry wraps his arm around Draco and with one clean movement lifts him off of the toilet seat and guides him to the bath. Getting him into it is a challenge on its own, Harry wasn’t exactly fond of grabbing onto Draco’s thighs and individually lifting both legs into the bath, it made him blush- it was beneficial, though, because Harry discovered that Draco’s left was broken in multiple places. He’d have to fix it.
Harry sat in his bedroom at  4 Privet Drive, up later than he’d like to be, revising homework while there wasn’t anyone awake to catch him. He’d been doing the same thing for years now,  sleeping during the day ( as much as they allowed him to ) only to stay up all night and study. There are two weeks until the school year starts, and the thought of going back to Hogwarts despite how dangerous it maybe is the only thing that’s keeping him going. That and the fact it seems like the future of the wizarding world is in his hands, but he’ll choose not to think about that either right now.
He’s finally reached the end of the hall and eye’s the set of stairs again, only now realizing that here’s two of them. One is leading upwards and the other down… He’s tempted to adventure further when Harry stops him.
“Mhm. Yeah. “ Harry rolls his eyes, eyes peering up at an old clock that sits on the wall beside a portrait of Harry’s grandfather, Fleamont Potter. “It’s late, let me show you where the guest room is so you can settle down.”
They all kinda look the same, Ron thought. They're all pale, lanky, dead looking. Zabini was the only one who didn't act or look that way, dark skin and a decent personality. He probably has some good in his background, probably less inbred too.
Harry excused himself and stepped into the bathroom, kneeling to turn on the tap of the claw-footed tub. He searched the cabinets and found some soap which he squirts into the bath before dropping a few drops of ‘rose essential oil’ into the warm water as well. Harry hadn’t ever had a bath so he wasn’t exactly sure what he was supposed to do.
Draco didn’t like the subject change and Harry knew it, he could feel Draco’s eyes burning into the side of his face as they walked towards the restaurant. Then, rather suddenly to Harry who’d thought the other had gone back to ignoring him,  Draco asked what fast food is which led to Harry explaining what it is, which was hard considering he’d never had to do it before. It’s one of those things everyone seems to understand.
, Harry thought as he shovelled the last scoop of partially burnt pie in his mouth. He figured it’d be better to keep it that way, he has an awful feeling in his stomach that Draco wouldn’t appreciate being spied on like that. Not that Harry did it on purpose, of course.
“Yes, I've healed myself a lot- Ever since Lockhart vanished the bones in my arm. “ Harry smiled at the memory, looking back at it now it was hilarious. Gilderoy Lockhart, famous author and adventurer couldn’t manage a simple healing spell. Of course, Harry knows now he wasn’t an adventurer at all.
The rest of the week was odd, to say the least. Draco slowly came out of his shell and went back to bullying Harry, but now it’s far more innocent. Harry, despite everything he’s come to believe about Draco, can’t deny his feelings, he’s fallen for him and hard at that. Harry hasn’t ever been in love, he knows that now because this feeling is intense, horrible and lovely at the very same time. He’s read books and watched movies all about love, but nothing compares to the real thing.
They continue to walk, Harry isn’t paying attention to where they’re going, in a state of pure, careless bliss. His eyes wander between the side of Draco’s face and their joined hands.
"Move. " Draco demanded, Gregory standing behind him, repeating what  Draco had already said "Yeah move, Weasel. " Ron just laughed, shaking his head, finding the pair to be nothing but stupid. What made those two idiots think he'd move just because they said so? That's kind of sad, if anything. It must be rough, growing up so privileged that you actually think people are going to do whatever you say?
Both Draco and Harry stand there, absolutely shocked, the pretty cup of tea in Draco’s hand almost slipping out of his grip.
Harry looks back to Draco and watches him stir, his face screwing up in his sleep, rolling over.  Harry wondered what Draco could be dreaming about for him to visibly react that way but quickly became distracted by the idea of having a shower, which he did.
Harry was sure Petunia was only acting this way to impress Albus, not wanting to show her true colours to a group of wizards and witches who’d be able to hex her on sight. He rolled his eyes and glanced back at Draco who, unbeknownst to him, had been glancing at him as well. They both quickly looked away from one another, paying attention once again to the conversation at hand.
“Yes! Well, er, not exactly. We didn’t… you know… But he kissed me and asked his wife for a divorce. “ Harry spoke of the last part with a tone of embarrassment in his voice but continued. “I think he likes me, you know.”
Ron's dad stood up, pushing the table across the room, throwing his hands over his head with shock. His mother covered her mouth and looked at her son with shock and hidden fear, Ginny didn't really understand what that meant and was just confused as to why her parents responded like that to what Ron had said, Percy was shaking his head and the twins were mocking the situation, just as expected.
They continue to eat for a small while, no one speaking, the Dursley’s eyes locked onto the television, Draco’s eyes staring at nothing and Harry’s staring at Draco. It seems peaceful, but that doesn’t last for long.
Draco was now sitting there mostly healed, only bruised and scarred. Harry can’t help but think of how attractive Draco looks, the last cut on Draco’s lip that Harry may have intentionally declined to heal making him look very, very kissable. Harry felt blood rush to his groin and became aware of the fact he’d been staring at Draco for awfully too long and stood up, pulling down the front of his sweater.
Ron was waiting impatiently for Harry's turn, wanting to know what house the legendary wizard would be placed into. He was sure he'd be placed into Gryffindor, every member of his family had been - although he really didn't want to be. Ron never saw himself as a Gryffindor, he wasn't brave nor cunning. The only Gryffindor trait he had was being short-tempered but honestly, anyone with 6 siblings would be short-tempered.
“You assume the word of me, Potter. I’m merely playing. “ Draco rolls his eyes and smirks. Harry can feel the warmth of Draco’s exhale on his lips, the heat radiating off of Draco’s skin. Harry had always assumed Draco would be cold to the touch, a stupid assumption to make about any living being but Draco’s ghostly pale skin made a younger Harry think of a corpse. He now only sees an angel, full of life.
They sit there for a while in silence before Draco leans down to whisper in Harry’s ear. “ Sorry for not coming back to you on the platform, Harry. I had… Well, I'll talk to you about it when we’re alone. “
They ate in relative silence, sitting in a booth by the children’s play area. Draco has been staring at the rainbow play equipment the whole time and Harry can’t understand why surely he’s seen one before? And played in it? Harry has few happy memories, one of them is climbing up to the very top of the jungle gym, knowing very well Dudley couldn’t squeeze his bulgy body through the tunnels to get to him. It was fun.
Harry pushes the bedroom door open with his foot, his hands already occupied with helping Draco stand. The door swung open to reveal that the room had doubled in size, a bed on each wall, one adorned with Gryffindor red sheets and the other with Slytherin green. Harry quickly carried Draco inside and helped him down on the bed that obviously would belong to Draco, peering past it to see a door that stood at the end of the bed. Upon opening it he found a bathroom that certainly wasn’t there before. Inside was a sink, toilet, shower and tub… Harry was sure he was dreaming.
Silence fell over the room once more, this silence is deafening. Percy snapped out of his lovesick trance and turned a paler shade than he already was, the twins did nothing but smirk, crossing their arms over their chest and leaning back into their chairs, as if they were in sync they both spoke "Yeah, Ron. How has Gryffindor been treating you?"
Draco didn’t know what a Telly is but worked it out pretty quickly. Some sort of muggle machine, sort of like a painting or photograph but it talks.  There were different ‘channels’ some of which displayed the news, others short multipart films called shows and ‘reality tv’ which exploited muggle England's worst kind of people for entertainment.
Harry reaches the top of the slide and before his eyes can even focus to see whether anyone in there with him he’s pushed back, pinned against the wall of the tiny little box he found himself in. His glasses fly off his face and he goes into panic mode,  grabbing the collar of whoever’s got a hold of him, trying to push them away.
After a while, Ron's dad, Arthur, decided to break the silence "So, Ron, how has Gryffindor been treating you? McGonagall not too hard on you?"
“I’m quite good friends with the trolley witch- she lets me buy candy beforehand so I don’t miss out on my favourites. I thought I'd put that privilege to good use.”
“I’m not seeing anyone. I tried to get back into the clubbing scene, I met a few people but nothing worked out. It’s hard to…” Harry pauses for a moment, neck and cheeks turning crimson. “
Harry realizes how stupid his question sounded and holds a hand to his forehead before continuing. “But why? Since when? How-  What-”
Harry’s heart aches when he thinks of the day Draco was locked away- He and a large group of Hogwarts students all protested Draco’s sentence, seemingly everyone agreed that Draco wasn’t a bad person but a poor boy raised by bad people but the Ministry declined.
Harry turns and unlocks the front door, holding it open for Draco and then follows behind him, out the door.
Harry feels his thoughts getting the best of him, he hasn’t responded to Draco and time is going by faster than he’d like it to be. It’s hard, thinking when you’re looking into the eyes of something you’ve unconsciously desired for so long, especially when that something is leaning closer and closer, and you think he’s about to kiss you. Draco Malfoy is about to kiss me.
“Why?” Harry burst out, eyes widening at the tone of his voice, he corrects himself. “ I-i mean, I'm not mad but confused. Why did you kiss me?”
“You really can be stupid, Potter. “ Draco adds, rather randomly in Harry’s opinion as he’d already finished Scourgify-ing all of the dishes and was about to sit back down. Nevertheless, Draco changes the subject before Harry can rebuttal.  “What are we going to do today?”
Harry placed the note back down in his drawer, picking up the book McGonagall had left. ‘ Glinda’s Guide to Healing Magic.’ Harry chuckled to himself, he knew everything he needed to know from this book thanks to Hermione who’d referenced it far too many times for his liking. He placed it down and sat back down on his bed, waiting for Draco to call.
In no time his door swung open and there stood Albus Dumbledore looking as grand as always, behind him another man, African in appearance adorned with what Harry only assumed to be traditional African robes. They weren’t like anything he’d seen but gorgeous, he’s almost envious that he can’t wear something of the sort.
“Howler, right? Some Ravenclaw girl got one last year, it was horrendous. I felt bad for her. Embarrassing as all hell, I dunno what it said, couldn’t make it out through the walls but  I'm sorry you had to go through that, Mr Malfoy.”
Harry takes a moment to process this, as there’s a lot to process. Dumbledore is gay? He had a sex life? Sirius is also gay?
“And for you, of course.” Draco sits next to Harry, almost on top of him and hands him a heart-shaped lollipop, watermelon flavoured rather than strawberry- Harry’s preference.
The news breaks, Harry finally draws his attention away from Draco to watch. “Another sickening gang attack last night in East London. According to police the 22-year-old victim, Cameron Smith was walking home from his girlfriend’s flat at 3 am when he was jumped by three men, all of which’s faces were covered.”
Aunt Petunia had fallen very ill and they were leaving for the next month to be with her, the note stressing that Harry shouldn’t try to contact them. Harry knew better than to think the Dursley's would ever leave him at home alone on any occasion, it was something to do with the fact Harry is now allowed to use magic.
There’s one reason why, though, and it’s not because Harry stopped being attracted to the other. It’s because he had a fear someone would find out he’s not only attracted to men but the man he desires the most is one of the most hated people amongst all of his friends, besides Voldemort. He’s also evil himself,  there’s no doubt about it amongst the minds of most so what does that say about Harry, the boy who lived? Being attracted to someone who is so evil?
Ron had decided that if he were to be a Slytherin he'd be the best damn Slytherin there ever was. He wanted to achieve greatness, many higher roles in society belonged to Slytherins, families who intimidated others like the Malfoys or Zabinis.
Harry looked away as Draco began looking undressed but couldn’t for long as Draco needed help getting his robes off over his head. He pulls off the robes gently and then crouches down to help with Draco’s shoe, singular because he’s only wearing one.
Harry has himself a long, steaming hot shower, taking the time to think about things. A surprisingly big argument point between him and Ginny was his showers- too long, too steamy and according to her, their bathroom was going to rot because of the constant moisture.
Harry blinked, a wave of realization hit him. That’s why Draco had kissed him so suddenly, Sirius must have convinced him too. “Oh. Huh. So you’re
Harry looks up from his parchment, placing it aside along with his self-inking quill. He can’t help but notice how good Draco looks in his new suit, all black and perfectly tailored to compliment his behind. Harry appreciates that a lot. “Yes?”
Slowly, the sound of running water fades away and is replaced by echoed silence only broken the sound of metal chains being rattled and what Harry assumed to be iron bars being tapped. The darkness was replaced by ghostly, distorted visions of Voldemort standing over him, laughing his horrendous, villain laugh. Harry felt cold, alone, unloved.
Harry regrets the last comment instantly, tensing up, expecting a negative reaction out of Draco. He was wrong.
“Are you sure you know how to do this?”  Draco asked, his attitude finding itself again which was a relief to Harry. Harry knelt by the bath, knees wet as he landed in a puddle of water that must have spilt out.
They’d been alone for over a week after their little argument the Dursley’s fled the house to go on a very urgent vacation, both Draco and Malfoy only finding out about this through a little note stuck on the fridge.
Harry, caught in the moment, a burst of confidence radiating out of him draws his wand on Vernon and spits back, now standing. “I’m allowed to use my magic on you now. I will. I’ll turn you into a pig.”
Draco walks off, leaving Harry with his trolley, stacked high with trunks of his belongings, Hedwig sitting on top in his cage looking as proud as ever. He pushes his heavy trolley closer to the train, looking to have his things loaded aboard when his eyes land on a certain lanky boy, adorned with a mop of fiery red hair.
Harry nods, leaning into Draco’s touch, a smile on his face. He feels as if nothing can worry him when Draco is by his side.
He rolls over and his eyes land on a sleeping Draco, handsome as ever. Constantly acknowledging Draco’s good looks like this can’t be good for him, he thinks.  He stopped thinking that way by the second year, around the time he assumed Draco was the heir of Slytherin and hasn’t since.
“I really thought you’d have a house-elf, Potter. You used to make friends with them all the time, you even freed dobby. I always liked him. “ Draco lifted himself onto the table, sitting on it looking all casual and sexy, driving Harry insane.
They finished their meals one after the other, James ran off to his room and left the pair of them to clean up, which was a simple task- only a wave of a wand.
Harry feels Draco’s arms wrap around him and he does the same back. They hold each other like this for a long time, in silence.
Harry has a long, peaceful bath, taking his time to wash every part of his body carefully because he simply feels like it.  It’s only when his fingers start to wrinkle does he decide to get out, getting dressed and exiting the bathroom in only a towel.
“Yeah, well, you have to open them otherwise they burst into a ball of flames. You can’t stay at home if you don’t have one. “ Draco simply shrugged and went back to eating. He’d rather have Harry and James assume he received a Howler rather than an argument with his wife- soon to be ex-wife, that is.
“ You should be fine to walk down, I'll just uh- go get you something to eat. There are clothes in the wardrobe for you. “ Harry scattered out of there, exiting the room and walking back downstairs to find that it was empty. Everyone had left and Harry assumed Vernin and Petunia had gone back to bed, which he was very grateful for.
“Immigrants, African ones I bet. I don’t know why they let such uncivilized folk come here and ruin our country on our dime. Leave them to rot, I say.” Vernon rants and Harry shudders. Harry is so distracted by Vernon's blatant racism that he forgets Draco is here, sitting right next to him for a moment. That changes when he turns to see Draco sitting there with a repulsed look on his face.
Harry stood there, stunned, eyes wide, unresponsive. He couldn’t even think, it’s as if he had been petrified.
Harry glanced up at the menu, arms crossed over his chest. Harry hadn’t ever been able to order anything besides a kids meal his whole life and now that he had the opportunity to order something that might fill him, he hadn’t a clue what to pick.
Harry slowly lowers himself back down into a different seat, this time sitting across from Draco. They sit in silence for some time, Harry thinking of ways he could heroically save the Malfoy Manor, Draco, on the other hand, wishing he was anywhere else besides Harry Potter’s living room.
He pushes the bedroom door open with his bottom before spinning around to face the room, his eyes landing on Draco who was sat on his bed, reading one of Harry’s muggle books. The Dursley’s spent a lot of money on books for Dudley in hopes he’d read them rather than watching television all the time, to no avail. That was good news to Harry because at the very least he’d be able to sneak books from the bookshelf in the living room and give them a read.
"They're from the Malfoys, This one is for you. " He handed her the present and she quickly opened it, the present being a gorgeous silky scarf in a deep purple.  "It's beautiful... "
Something Ron didn't miss was his mothers cooking. Unseasoned, beef too dry and mash too soggy, as a lover of all foods his mother did disappoint but he was grateful for the fact she at least tried. They were all seated and began to eat, Percy only picking at his food,  love-sick thanks to his new giiiiirrrlllfriend,  the twins faking illness to get out of eating whilst Ron put up with it, being the determined and hungry boy he was.
He had already figured it was either Draco’s parents or  Voldemort- or both, that much was obvious. But why? Was Draco not a death eater?  His family had been serving the Dark Lord for years, he can’t understand what Draco could have done to be tortured like this.
The kids had only just left via the floo to visit their mum, taking Scorpius, Draco’s son, with them stating Draco knew to pick Scorpius up from Ginny’s. That isn’t the case.  Harry and Draco only had just realized they’d been swindled when that chilling announcement aired on Harry’s ‘mechanical muggle painting’ causing them both to pause mid-conversation.
“When did you stay at the leaky cauldron?” Draco asks as they continue to  walk side by side, close enough that their hands touched
them.  Harry will never be fond of the Ministry but for a period of at least three years Harry despised them, he spent days wishing he never thought so hard to save the wizarding world only for them to turn their back on Draco in the way they did. Maybe they deserved what they had coming for them.
When Harry heard Draco’s door finally shut he crept out of his room, tip-toeing past Draco’s bedroom door and down the stairs to the basement. He was almost caught by James who’d left his room to visit the bathroom, Harry had to duck down and hide in the stairwell. It was all very scary.
After Harry and Ginny’s divorce, Harry moved to the country, craving an entirely different lifestyle to the one he had in the heart of London. He’d say it’d be better for the kids who stay with him most days, but in reality, Harry just craved the peace and quiet of the countryside.
Harry frowned, putting his aside. Harry knew very little of his family and nothing of his grandparents, he would have liked to know his grandfather was the creator of the only potion that’d deal with his horrible hair.
“Ginny will be fine, Luna is staying with her too. Remember Teddy and Luna? She was amazing with him. “
“Potter? Do you remember when we first met?” Harry doesn’t have to even think of the memory as it’s never left him, always at the front of his mind as if it only happened yesterday. “Madam Malkin’s. I was getting my robes and you introduced yourself, I thought you were a snob.”
When we got back to the Slytherin common room that evening everyone was nervous. Marcus kept walking up and down the room muttering to himself. Derrick and Bole were polishing their beater bats and Adrian and Miles kept going over the tactics we all agreed on for the match. I just sat down next to Draco on a sofa. I didn’t want to talk because every time I opened my mouth I felt like making a run for the toilets.
“It’s my house, I’ll fuck my wife wherever I want,” Ron says. He pulls his trousers back up, and Draco shakes his head.
Harry shakes his head. “The greenhouses are too light. And how would he get there during the day? No, we need to figure out which student never makes it to Herbology to find out who the vampire is.”
Draco looks at his arm. The mark faded over the years to just some red lines on his pale skin. Draco remembers when Voldemort burned it into his skin, how it flared black before turning red. Aunt Bella had given Draco some pain potions before the act, said it would make things easier. It had still been painful but bearable. It was the start of the slide down. The potions had helped then. Helped him sleep, helped him forget, helped him to stop feeling anything at all.
Not long after that, Draco’s father and mother arrived. They took places just behind me and Draco. Draco hugged his mother shortly and said a formal hello to his father. I also greeted them, in the hope that one day they would consider me worthy enough for their son. At that moment I understood why Draco was trying so hard when it came to Sirius. I know Draco kind of hates his father at the moment, but he’s still his father and I want him to like me. Not that Sirius was any help with that. He and Lucius greeted each other with a look of dismay. Draco’s mother made a little more effort and said it was nice to see Sirius again. She did the same with Mr Tonks and she introduced herself to Tonks, saying it was good to finally meet her. Tonks just nodded and turned back around in her seat, not interested in her aunt at all. She later told Draco she’s glad he’s not as narrow-minded as his parents. I know Draco struggled with this, he really loves his mother and I agree with him, she’s lovely. She really helped me last year when I had run away from the Dursleys.
Hermione signs. “Ron, stop it. He’s right. We had to agree with this. If I’d told them I didn’t want to do it, they would have found another person to take my place. Nobody forced us.”
When I had calmed down a little, Draco took me to Honeydukes and helped me get back into the cellar. He said he couldn’t come with me that way, that Filch was counting as the students came back into the castle, but that he would meet me in our dormitory. I can’t really remember walking back or going down to the dungeons. But once I was there I took out the photo album Hagrid had given to me and started turning the pages, searching. And then I found it, a picture of your wedding day. You were both in it, and another man. If I hadn’t known it was the same person, I would never have guessed it was Black. He looked so different than he does now. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. It was one of the men that had also been in the picture in Professor Lupin’s office.
“Harry, I love it that you have an interest in something other than Quidditch,” Hermione says. She leans forwards over her crossed arms on the table. “Truly, you won’t believe how excited this makes me. But do you think you can just decide what is best for someone you barely know?”
We have our first match at the end of next month, and Draco is training really hard to become the best seeker they have. Adrian teases him every time Draco gets worried. Hermione says it’s fun to watch. She and Daphne come watch us train most evenings. They do their homework together while we fly. Only Derrick and Bole don’t like it, they’re afraid she will tell the Gryffindors about our tactics. Miles told them to shut up, that Hermione was cool and that she would never betray her best friends like that. And I agree with him.
“That his father acts as if he isn’t deaf,” Harry says. “He’s supposed to be the one to help him the most. And the only thing he does is make it worse.” A tear escapes Harry’s eye and he hurries to wipe it away before Remus will notice.
Sirius gave me the sex talk. It was awkward, he stumbled over his words and I just wanted the ground below me to open up and swallow me whole. He said you would have given me the talk too if you were still alive dad, and Sirius wanted to make sure I was safe and protected. He asked me if Draco and I had already done anything more than kiss and I didn’t know what to say. He took my silence as a yes and said he knows forbidding me to do anything while Draco is here is useless, that he was young once too. So instead he thought me how to cast a strong silencing charm and gave me a book that explains spells that can help when penetrating each other.
Around four all my friends arrived. It was nice to have Hermione, Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Luna come over to my home during the summer. We had a lot of fun. Mrs Tonks had put 14 candles on my cake, which was delicious. We hung out in the garden and everyone told me about their own summer adventures. Blaise had been to some tropical island, Greg and Daphne had met up several times during break and Hermione explained how she helped out her parents with their work. Luna was fascinated by the way muggles take care of their teeth.
I’ve been thinking about it, touching Draco, seeing him without his clothes. Ever since Christmas. And during our Valentines date, I found out he thought about it too. We had a lovely picnic beside the lake. Draco had managed to get an order in for picnic food from Hogsmeade. It was lovely. After we finished the food we took a walk around the lake until we ended up at the Quidditch changing rooms. Draco pushed me inside and we started snugging. And before I knew it Draco was pushing my sweater over my head and stroking his hands all over my bare torso. Well, I’m sure you don’t want to read all the details. It ended with Draco’s shirt on the ground too and his hand down my trousers, wrapped around me. Fuck, that felt good, to have his hands on me. I repaid him the favour after the match against Ravenclaw and I can say it’s just as hot as having his hands on me.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley,” Hermione states as she stands up. “You fought with Harry on the day of the task because of his crush? Are you insane?”
Ginny plods back to the sofa and pulls her legs under her butt. “Well, be quick. I’m meeting Luna in a bit to go on a hunt for Nargles.”
‘No. I don’t mind,’ Draco writes. ‘The world has always been silent. Sounds will only be distracting.’
“You think he’s?” Neville asks from the side. Harry nods. Malfoy has to be. Harry doesn’t know why he never noticed before. There is a completely different reason why Malfoy never speaks. It’s not because the boy is a pure-blood git who thinks he’s better than everyone. He probably doesn’t have a clue what others have said and just doesn’t know what to answer. If Harry is right, Malfoy can’t hear a single sound around him.
When I got downstairs Draco just finished our breakfast. I think Sirius was impressed that Draco knows how to cook and I could see he was trying really hard to be civil with Draco. Draco is really polite towards Sirius and all that crazy pure blood etiquette is showing when he’s around Sirius. I don’t think it really helps, that it just pisses off Sirius even more. But I love how Draco tries to impress my Godfather and proof he’s a decent person.
Ron has also been writing letters to Neville, who had a great summer with his grandmother. I asked Ron what had happened to Neville’s parents, but Ron didn’t know. Neville had been practising his flying and was now capable to stay on the broom without freaking out. I’m glad to hear that he is doing better and hope he will also improve on his other subjects this coming year.
“It was an accident,” Draco says. He closes his eyes and sees it all happen again. “We both spotted the snitch at the same time. We raced to get there first. But the weather was bad, and we couldn’t stop in time. His broom broke and I reached out to grab him. I almost fell off my broom doing it. I tried to hold on, but my fingers started to slip off my broom. And then he let go of my arm. He fell to make sure I wouldn’t fall with him.” Fresh tears stain Draco’s cheeks. Even awake he can’t keep the sight of Harry plummeting to his death out of his mind.
Their lips meet each other again. The kiss stays soft this time around. Just their lips connecting. But it means more than the first kiss. This is a promise, a commitment to stick together.
Hogwarts is the same as always. Other students greet Harry as he walks to the Gryffindor table and sits down with his friends. He looks over at the Slytherin table and spots Malfoy at the very end. Harry can only see his platinum blond hair as his back is turned to Harry. Some older students sit around Malfoy. They don’t pay Malfoy any attention. Harry wonders if this bothers Malfoy. It would bother Harry, to be ignored by everyone around him. If only Harry could see Malfoy’s face, then he could see if Malfoy is upset or not. He probably is, isn’t he? How could he not be?
Under the bright sprig of green, Harry kissed him breathless, panting into him, bodies plastered together, hearts pounding in the same rhythm.
, Janelle was saying — and something, somehow compelled him forward. He walked boldly across the room to Harry and stopped at his side, facing the rest of the room, shoulder to shoulder with Harry. They were almost the same height, Draco noticed. Harry was a bit taller, but not enough that Draco had to strain to look right at him.
Harry flicked one of the knives from his wrist holster, flipping it in his hands with a devilish grin.  Draco rolled his eyes.
There was enough food for a week, so they planned to return on the seventh day whether they’d banished the ghost or not.
It was in the corner of Flourish and Blotts that he nearly walked straight into Harry Potter for the first time in nearly three years. Harry had nearly caught him shrinking down the compendium of socialist wizarding theory. If he had been a second slower, Harry might have noticed the twitch of his hand as he slid it carefully into his robes’ inner pocket. Maybe Harry
Harry plastered himself against the mast, burning from head to toe from everything but the sun. Draco had been so close. He’d been so close. But they were working. Close quarters or not, they were working, and the boat and the sea and the salt wind couldn’t change their rules.
"I’ve got it,” Draco shouts, or Harry really fucking hopes that’s what he’s shouting, because he’s brandishing something gold and if it’s not the talisman they came for, they’re both going to die.
I have to lean forward and kiss him against his throat so I can feel his heartbeat under my lips. He’s alive, he’s alive. Let him rest.
Draco stared at him across the room as he leaned over the machine, walking a pair of goggling teenagers through the many buttons. He was patient and kind with them, animated even in describing the minutiae of doing Muggle laundry. Harry chose that moment to look up and catch Draco's eye and Draco cringed, shoving the trousers into the machine and wishing he could dive in too.
“Finite Incantatem,” Draco said, and the disguise fell away. He raised his chin to the flurry of reporters gathered, crowding too-close.
"We were discussing your choice to assign my article on day one of your class," Draco said, inclining his head towards Harry with a challenge. "Four months ago," he added, but didn't say:
Marena Morganthau, the Minister for Magic, reclines in her chair, mauve fingernails tapping on the desk. She smiles at first, and realizes he’s not who he’s supposed to be. It’s too late. The memory moves like a photograph, twitching forward wrongly, ruined by the frenetic frazzle of Harry’s magic.
Draco moved in shadow, polyjuiced as Harry. He killed the last unwitting, cozy neo-Death Eater with a single dangerous spell. Draco dove through the window as the alarm bells rang, calling the murderer’s name: Harry Potter. The Prophet would still call Harry a hero, and he didn’t have to fight.
And when his other self leaned down to kiss Draco Malfoy, he knew intimately what those lips tasted like, could perfectly visualize the way their lips would move together.
Sometimes, Draco went home with Theo. Or Blaise.  Harry used to leave with Ginny once in a while, but not anymore.  He told himself it was only because she usually ended up with Pansy, too gone in each other’s eyes to spare a glance for him.  But Harry didn’t come to the club unless Draco was going to be there.
“Heard you dropped out of the Force,” Draco said snidely, hoping to be on with his day. “Couldn’t manage the wizard-Muggle border watch anymore?”
The Death Eater Surveillance List was an open secret. Special Service Aurors were assigned a name and sent into the field. Cloaked in invisibility, Auror Potter watched Subject #283’s every motion. It was only in the dim Elysium Club, bodies moving, bass pounding, that he realized Draco was watching back.
He went to the Ministry and completed the requisite Death Eater Registry paperwork, watching the worker’s gazes as their lips curled in disdain at him. He took it all in stride. For two long years, he went from the Ministry’s probation offices to the shop to the tiny shitty flat in London. There was no money after the Manor and the estates were seized. Lucius had fled to who-knows-where, and Narcissa was with her sister somewhere in the city, and the Ministry was increasingly restrictive on his work and spending.
The Lumos burned bright yellow, hovering over the tiny wooden table. They didn’t speak, but they didn’t need to. Harry’s eyes had adjusted to the dim flicker of light across Draco’s sharp cheekbones and silver reading glasses. Outside, the sea was patient. The boat shifted almost imperceptibly, like breathing. Harry almost wished it were storming, if only to have something else to attend to.
They’d gone home from the club together a dozen times.  Harry had been inside him half as many, had fucked Draco until they were both gasping for air, drowning in each other, skin and bodies hot and slick and too much.
Harry said something, almost certainly reasserting Draco’s innocence, and “—Undesirable number one—” and then something else that Draco couldn’t quite hear, and then there was just silence for long enough that Draco considered pressing down the door to make sure they hadn’t just hexed each other right there.
His feet, unbidden, brought him to the desk. There was a young man sitting with his hands on the keyboard of an old Muggle computer, thick keys and a massive monitor. It was his James, but it wasn’t him. It wore his face, his eyes.
, like we’d both forgotten about Vincent Crabbe and the war and all the bridges we burned between us.”
The first bad raid ended with Harry clutching Draco’s shoulders, begging him to stay alive. The second was in reverse: Harry, bloody on the floor, an exploded curse. They handed in a dual resignation after the third. What’s the point of heroics if you won’t live to tell the tale?
"Is Elena talking your ear off?" Harry smiled, leaning against one of the machines in a flattering pose that left no sense of his long legs to the imagination. "I swear, she's going to be the next
Draco lit a fragrant candle and Harry cast to clean the sheets. Their movements were familiar, a remembered pattern back and forth across the room. Harry stepped over to Draco, unbuttoned that high collar and exposed his neck. Draco slid his hands under Harry’s shirt, tugged it over his head, scraping his nails along Harry’s already-overheated skin as he did.
His eyes grew dry as he watched himself go to work at a job he clearly loved, laughing and chatting with coworkers. He couldn’t hear what anyone was saying, but he could almost make it out, as though listening from a great distance. It seemed this other Harry was some sort of social worker, chatting with gangly teenagers and parents. It didn’t matter what he was doing, this Harry glowed with a passion and a clear love for his work.
Was it his imagination running wild? Was the unreality of the Mirror becoming stronger? He moved with Malfoy just as Mirror-Harry moved, unable to stop flipping between the Draco in the Mirror and the Malfoy in his arms — or were they the same man? Was the touch under his fingertips, warm and firm and confident, all in his head, all in his sight?
They’d lived one thousand lives as lovers, as family, as friends. They’ll end this one as mates again, one thousand one.
She’ll make a note on her clipboard like they don’t see each other every day anyway. Her notes will list out the seven years they’ve already finished, their corresponding memories in vials on her shelf.
It was Harry who got distracted. A young Muggle girl stumbled and cocked her head, noticing the two remaining men in black. Harry, a saviour till the bitter end, dove to protect her, pushing her back into the crowd. Draco was almost too late. His spell, strong even then, was nearly not fast enough.
“Oh, pity, I’m just talking a walk,” Harry answered, stepping closer, his wand obvious in his hand. “That’s still allowed, isn’t it?”
“Incredible,” Harry said, getting to his feet. He was quite a bit taller than Draco in this form, especially as Draco’s body was shorter and wider than his true body. Draco looked up at him, flushed slightly pink, and let the fire dissipate. “You’re incredible,” Harry echoed, and pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead.
They were ambushed by not less than six wizards the second he landed in the crowded subway, all dressed in the typical Ministry black, all with their faces covered. That was when they still pretended that they were a secret police. That was when being one of Them was something to hide, not a point of pride. Draco and Harry had stood back to back, hands raised, watching as the six circled inward and the busy station didn’t seem to notice.
They curled under the blankets. It was less lonely like that, where they could share body heat and touch and oxygen.
Draco slipped through the hatch, landing on his feet in the cabin. Harry touched his cheek with two fingers and winced at the flash of red.
“I know that,” Draco answered, picking at the fray in his jumper. It was a small thread and he really ought not pull it. He tugged at it anyway.
“How can you be my heart’s deepest desire?” Harry begged, but asking it out loud didn’t stop the feeling in his chest like magic bubbling up.
James Potter returned from the dead without warning or clothes. The residents of Godric’s Hollow went erratic, shouting loudly enough to drag Draco of bed to press up against the Cottage’s frosted window. There, by the rosebush, was the spitting image of his husband ten years younger and entirely naked.
The rain steals the words in his throat but Draco Apparates up to his side anyway and he does have it, and then they’re flying through time, the little gold Time-Turner around both their necks and all is going to be alright.
"It's a good article," Harry nodded, though he went pink at the crests of his cheekbones. Draco's mouth felt suddenly dry.
"Holding up?" Harry whispered as he pushed the latest text on Animagus transformation through the charmed bars.
Harry looked at him from his seat at the base of a wide oak tree, also barefoot, long dark hair flicking in the wind. This wiry body suited him, all long limbs and a strikingly handsome face with wide eyes and a perfect cupid’s bow. Harry sipped at the Polyjuice flask he wore at his hip now, all attention on Draco.
Then Draco’s hand was over his and Harry realized he’d begun to crush the parchment. Draco was gentle. He ghosted light fingers over the back of Harry’s knuckles and Harry felt only that instead of the pain in his chest. It was no magic, no Illusion, but Harry was drawn to the touch, ached for it.
“I did see you,” Harry admitted. He shut his eyes to fight the compulsion to look back at the Mirror. “I think your Mirror must be broken. Who restored it? They must have cursed it, it’s not safe to have it on view like this.”
“That’s what Harry says,” Charlie murmured, scruffing a hand through his hair. “And if he’s right, and Ron really is on board, well.”
Harry sighed, pressing both hands against his forehead, and scrubbing them through his long hair. A bit of cement rubble fell out, tumbling between them. They both burst into laughter. It ripped out of Draco’s chest, a bubble of painful emotion that had been building there since they had run from the motel and he
