Draco clamped his eyes shut and nodded, trying to believe him. When he tried to loosen the vice grip of his arms, Harry squeezed tighter.
"I'm fine," Harry said, picking up his fork and cutting into the quiche. "But just to be totally clear. You're flirting with me, right? This isn't like, some strange Slytherin social ritual that I don't understand?"
"It's the shirt, isn't it?" Malfoy asks. Harry turns around to find Malfoy looking down appraisingly at himself. "You can't keep your hands off me in this shirt."
"Do you want our first time kissing to be in front of all our children as we try to convince them that we fell in love?"
Teddy grins, all gums, and Harry tickles his cheek. Teddy chomps Harry's finger, which makes Harry laugh. "If you bite like that when you get teeth, you'll be quite the menace."
Draco shrugs and sits on Harry's bed. "I think only Weasley and Finnigan." Harry sits next to him and flops onto his back. "Are you going to tell me what triggered it? Was it just seeing Weasley? You knew she'd be here, right?"
Malfoy looks up, his face falling into a scowl when he recognises Harry. "Potter? Why are you here?"
Draco grinned. "But who can say if it is a position or not? We will merely be discussing our personal lives."
"Alright look," Harry says, "it's fairly simple: you step onto one step and then stand still and it brings you up." At the terrified look on Malfoy's face, Harry continues, "Are you going to be able—"
, for goodness' sake! He was the type of person who talked about things when they came up, because he knew how shitty things got when you didn't.
Scorpius was a magical historian. He taught classes sometimes, but more often wrote articles and books. Albus and Harry had been trying to convince him to write some history books meant for popular audiences.
Draco pressed his lips to Harry's neck, which was doing something to Harry's insides. "Was that innuendo, Potter? It was awful." His teeth grazed Harry's ear.
They somehow spend over £100 on ingredients for dinner. Harry pays with his credit card; Draco finds a £50 note in his bag and stuffs it into Harry's back pocket.
Potter snorts. "Yeah, you're right, Malfoy. My almost taking a knife for Dobby is exactly the same as you telling your creepy aunt that you
He made his way through the Floo, up the lifts, and into the Auror offices before his day went south.
“It’s just,” she said, “imagination is so fleeting. It’s not like you can rely on it. And after you’ve been dealing with Prophecies and fate and horrifying realities for the last few years—it’s not like you had a lot of time to sit around
. The problem was, Harry wasn't interested in Neville, or anyone else like him, and the people he found attractive and wanted to date were never the ones who could maybe actually fit into his life. Fit into his
Harry cast a Location spell to find which drawer his joggers were in, then walked over to the illuminated drawer. Generally, he slept without pants, but it seemed going a bit too far to drop pants with Draco in the room, and it would be awkward to walk into the loo just to change into his pyjama bottoms. Pants it was, he thought, tugging the joggers on.
"I know," Harry says, and he's grateful for Ron's support, he really is. But he still needs to get out of here.
Draco yelped as Aster attempted to latch through his shirt. "This is linen, little miss!" He guided her head away and stuck his finger in her mouth for her to chomp. "Can you get the bottle ready?"
As Draco's heart rate slowed, he realised with horror that he'd been waxing poetic (mentally, not aloud, thank Merlin) about testicles. Testicles, of all things! He was so gone.
Malfoy stopped laughing and leaned closer. "Would you like me to stomp on your face? Is that what you mean?"
Harry laughed, not bothered by this statement in the least. He walked behind Draco with his empty glass, thinking he might get some of that fancy mineral water Draco kept in the wine cooler. "Guilty as charged. No, more than guilty—I'm proud of that."
“I know,” Draco says. “I—you must realise I found you fit before we got together, seeing as I found you fit when we did.”
It's not that Harry wasn't expecting to know anyone here—he figured there'd be people from Hogwarts. He knew none of his closest friends were coming, but he expected to see plenty of people he knew by sight or by name. He expected to see, like, Terry Boot, or Stephen Cornfoot, or that girl from Ravenclaw whose name he always forgets. But
Their small talk continued against the background prattle of various officials. Albus waved his wand to mute Head of Muggle-Worthy Excuses and turned to ask Draco a question about wizarding history. Albus was a tutor for magical children who were too young for Hogwarts, and he was forever lamenting the way that pure-blood parents insisted on teaching pure-blood history. Albus, of course, had never particularly learned pure-blood history, and leaned heavily on his historian husband when a family insisted on "rigor in magigenealogy." But Draco and Astoria hadn't drilled Scorpius in what Draco referred to as "the traditional manner," so Albus sometimes came to Draco with his more obscure magigenealogy tutoring questions.
could never forget. He remembered the officers at his Wizengamot trial when he was fifteen years old—standing at the ready, should they need to drag Harry away. He remembered Pius Thicknesse, when Head of DMLE, under Imperius Curse, doing Voldemort's bidding, no one questioning him because of his position. He remembered when Yaxley was the Head of the DMLE.
Draco sighed in a resigned way. "It's alright, Potter. We all deal with stress in our own way, I suppose. Some of us deal with it like a giggling child."
Panting and red-cheeked, Harry turns to Hermione. "I need a break! I'm going to go get another drink. You coming?"
Albus's phone dinged. "Matty wants to know if we want to come over. Apparently his dad is getting trollied on Kilkennys."
Even with the charm in place, he could hear James arguing with Teddy about what Christmas film to watch, and Albus and Scorpius telling Draco to stop dropping baby name hints, and Nico gamely singing along (loudly—the man was, he told Harry, a classically trained tenor) with Lily's a capella version of "Last Christmas" (which had to be the worst Christmas song to sing with a current lover).
because of the press. Even if you got laid that day, which for the record I don't think you did, it was definitely outweighed by the weeks of misery that followed." He paused, glaring at Harry, as if daring him to challenge his version of events. "And it's the same for me. You and I are completely screwed in the dating department. We may as well throw in the towel and embrace a marriage of convenience."
"You're right. I'm a centrist, anyway. We wouldn't want to send the wrong message." Draco waved his wand and a crystal dove appeared. He cocked his head to the side, considering it.
Maybe the problem wasn't the wedding at all. Maybe the problem was that he and Draco had never really discussed their
Draco counted out six dried eyebright flowers and placed them in a mortar. He used his wand to Levitate ten dried lacewing flies out of a jar, adding them to the mortar and charming the pestle. Once a fine powder, he poured the contents into the cauldron.
The waiter arrived back at their table. Harry smiled and ordered the crustless quiche and a mocha with whipped cream.
"We can't wait for the WCLU!" Scorpius looked wounded at the thought. "That could be months or years."
Malfoy's smile faded as he leaned back on his hands. "You said a few weeks ago that you can't believe that I can really be better." He paused. "I will never be perfect. Maybe I'll never be good enough to satisfy your Gryffindor morality. But I am already
Harry snorts. Malfoy's right, obviously, and isn't that just the cherry on top of the shit sundae of his life. He doesn't know why he can't stop himself from keeping on talking. It's like the alcohol has put him in oversharing mode. With
"That's the texture from the chia," Malfoy said, raising a hand to to rub his forehead. "Green chia kombucha."
would surely get it on film. Moreover, they might get kicked out of Azure Cup, and what would Harry do then?
Draco cracked his eyes open. "I suppose you'll tell me it's not a relationship, if there's not love. That sounds very on-brand for you. But then I have a follow-up: what's 'love'? No, really—try to define it. If we have combined our households, spend time together, jointly engage in family activities, work together on important issues, eat together, et cetera, what about that isn't
Harry manages to stop spluttering, but his face remains bright red. “Digital as in—with an electric, er, device?”
The others sounded a cacophony of congratulations—James Summoned a bottle of champagne and popped it.
"Oh, morning Harry," Hermione says, looking over her shoulder as her arms punch the air. "When do you—"
James pushed his chair away from the table with a scrape. “Yes. That sounds good. I haven’t slept all night.”
"I know. I told her we would do a traditional marriage vow in private, at some other time. Alright?"
“The new dress code in the Code of Conduct has been revoked, and new changes to the code will be considered in committee.”
Harry laughed, both aloud and in emoji, then pocketed his phone and looked up. The entire personnel of the DMLE lobby was staring at him. After a long moment, Belinda, the administrative head, pressed her wand to an intercom on her desk and said, "Rodney, can you call in the DMLE PR crisis team? I think we may have need of them today." She withdrew her wand, then tapped it again. "Lara, I need you to assist Jorgen today….Whatever he wants….You'll see."
"No, they're fine," Harry said, then frowned. "I think. We can check later, when we're done talking."
Floo call. 5:15am. In the bedroom Floo, which only their children had access to, and which they never used because they worried about accidentally…. Which could only mean—
Harry dropped his head dramatically into his hand, looking away from the chaos of his progeny. He heard Draco laugh, then froze when Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder, rubbing it back and forth like a lover would do to provide comfort. To provide somewhat
Harry nods. "You'll be okay?" he asks her. He feels like he's doing something rebellious and wonders how badly Hermione is judging him right now for
Harry swatted him away. "Calm down. It's going to be fine. We're just putting on a little show, we can do that. I'm playing Harry Potter, helplessly in love with a blond Slytherin despite all his better instincts."
"The problem is that this is a feminist issue and I don't want to make it seem like I care only about cis women."
Draco met his eye. "Because I'm not worried about the paper, or the public, or even really about the election. But our children? I…I fucking forgot to factor in who
She nodded. She had kids who'd grown and moved out—she understood. "How are you feeling? About moving in together? It's a big step, and it's been a long time since you lived with anyone."
So in all due fashion, Moody performed that too. Many of the girls shrieked, even some of the boys. Both Pansy and Blaise clung to his arms as Draco stared at the dead spider.
"Oh, speaking of shopping, I got you something from Dervish and Banges," he rifled through one of the bags full of bottles and cosmetics. He pulled out a small pink plastic tube and handed it to Luna. "You were wanting to dye your hair, but your hair is already such a lovely blonde that I didn't want to risk anything with the unpredictable muggle stuff. So I got you a wizard one, with a twist. Gives it a bit more off an affect." He shrugged.
Maybe he could try and order a cat? As far as he knew, Aunt Bella was okay with animals. He only needed to send the Grimmauld owl Booky off to order a cat, and set a third area to pick it up. But he wasn’t really allowed out, and Aunt Bella was probably too busy to help...
“Ugh. I did NOT expect that kiss to be that bad!” Pansy said out loud, much to everyone who was watching’s hilarity as they laughed. Draco nodded in agreement.
"Shut it Via!" He hissed at her, feeling a pink grow on his cheeks to his ears. Then she licked his hand. "Geurrg! Via, you're disgusting!" He shrieked, lifting his now saliva covered hand with antipathy. Potter watched this whole scene play out with confusion, as Weasley once again looked one bad knock knock joke away from bursting out laughing. Then Weasley's face went serious.
“Sounds awesome. The only help I really need is on the fang bite on my neck and giving my face a dead look.” Octavia explained. Martha smirked.
"So I asked Professor Snape about your progress in Slytherin, and do you know what he said?" Draco clenched his fists tighter. "He said that you weren't in his house. That you were in RAVENCLAW." His father's voice boomed. This entire time the Howler hadn't howled as much as it talked to him. Dracos suspected this was going to stop very soon. "DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE TO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US DRACO?! IT MEANS A LINEAGE THAT HAS LASTED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS, SINCE HOGWARTS FIRST BEGAN, IS BROKEN! BECAUSE OF YOUR REPULSIVE LOVE OF BOOKS. I ALWAYS KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED YOUR BLATHERING ABOUT BOOKS WHEN IT BEGAN! I WAS TOO LENIENT WITH YOU! I SHOULD HAVE BEAT IT OUT OF YOU WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE!" The calm was gone. The control was gone. Everything was gone. Draco could practically feel the books slamming onto his head. "BUT NOW YOU'VE DISHONOURED YOUR FAMILY, HAVE DISSAPOINTED YOUR ANCESTORS AND HAVE DISOBEYED ME! YOU HAVE EVEN DISHONOURED SALAZAR SLYTHERIN HIMSELF! THE MAFLOY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN SLYTHERIN, THEY HAVE BEEN CUNNING, THEY HAVE BEEN AMBITIOUS, THEY HAVE BEEN SHREWD, ACHIEVMENT ORIENTED AND ESPECIALLY STRONG LEADERS! AND NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NONE OF THOSE THINGS!" Draco's eyes welled up. He was nothing, he'd done everything wrong, he was a failure, he was a Ravenclaw, he wasn't a Malfoy, he was nothing-
“You don’t deserve to speak of Aunt Bella that way! Blood traitor.” He hissed. “And if you’re quite done with talking about me as if I’m not right here, maybe you can go through this lovely introduction again with the weird perverts on the stairs.” He pointed behind the two idiots to a large gathering of gingers, all watching them with interest and confusion.
The kid looked at him with horror. Sirius shrugged. “Just one item, but it can’t be a weapon. I’m not a monster.” The kid continued to stare at him.
It was then that Draco noticed a tapping on his right shoulder. He turned around to see the first Ravenclaw boy, Terry, sitting by his side. At the sudden eye contact Terry smiled at him and put two thumbs up, and Draco couldn't help but feel endeared. Draco breathed in deeply and gave Terry two shaky thumbs up in return. At this, his grin grew wider. An applause from a sorting Draco didn't pay attention to rang out and Draco watched as Terry dropped his thumbs up to cover his ears. Draco, still not handling the noise great either, copied Terry. Terry smiled and him wordlessly and focused his gaze onto the sorting.
"Oh, here's one!" He opened up the door and began piling in his luggage. Harry started of with his owl, which Draco just had to comment on. "She's a beautiful owl."
"Really? Best day ever!" Michael yelled excitedly. "I love Potions! My dad got me the Child's Potions Lab when I was younger, and I have a subscription to Draughts and Elixirs Weekly!"
"Double Potions." Anthony answered him, packing away the charms book he used to practice Wingardium Leviosa.
"NO HE WASN'T! He wasn't...he wasn't flirting with me! He was being annoying. An annoying git. He wouldn't stop talking to me and kept trying to reccomend food when I was already eating something. He tried to ask about the rides we'd been on and he wouldn't leave us alone!"
"In a concise way, yeah pretty much. I'm not very good at knowing about romance and stuff like that." I shrugged. "But it's be kind of nice to date someone who's your foil yet compliments you at the same time, you know? A whole Yin and Yang type of deal."
She missed the old gang a lot however. Martha was so popular with so many girls who all already knew about girly things and being social and being fun and being half blood and all that, so Octavia felt distant. And Danny was a bit boring sometimes. He always seemed to tuck in on himself, and wasn’t up for very riveting conversation.
“Where’s Theo?” He asked casually. Or at least tried to. To Draco, it was pretty obvious how much Blaise really did care where Theo was. It made Draco’s insides squirm over what he would say next.
"Mother, could you get us both some ice cream while I get my robes fitted over there at Madam Malkin's please?" He pointed to the robe shop so she wouldn't get lost. He handed her a small pouch full of sickles and galleons.
“Gah!” Both Potter and him shrieked in unison. Draco jumped up and Potter dropped him, landing him on his arse.
"Is that Malfoy and a mini Malfoy?" Weasley's voice broke through from behind the two siblings. He turned around to come face to face with the golden trio. He scowled and crossed his arms. Octavia looked quite angry, passing her book and satchel over to Draco and rolling up her sleeves.
"That's it! Hey Potter, From Second year to Fifth year, Draco had a crush o-" Her weasling was interrupted by a flying blonde tackling her to the floor. She was pushed down with a loud shriek, her arms desperately trying to get her attacker off of her. It was then that I could finally see Malfoy's new hair.
“I thought you were at least twenty or something,” Draco smiled slightly, “or that you just looked young for your age,” his smile dropped. “How did you perform such strong wandless magic? What kind of training does she have you under?” He neared the shield slightly and Draco leaned away a bit.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter! The next one will be posted a week from now, so look out for that. If you enjoyed then please leave a kudo and comments are just so dang appreciated they make my day! Feel free to ask any questions and I may add some art to the next chapter.
Weellll....that was quick update. I just find this fic so easy to right for at the moment, so I'm going to keep doing that until I found normal writing inspiration, is that okay? This chapter's a little bit shorter, but my chapter minimum will be set at 5000 words. I hope you enjoy the chapter!
The sorting ceremony commenced, and although they were so few in numbers, there was quite a bid of indecisiveness between houses. They were pretty evenly split between the them, though I noticed any first years who got put in Slytherin got very little applause, and even some booing from other houses, but was quickly shushed by McGonagall. I couldn't help but feel bad for them. One girl, Amy Gates, who was put into Slytherin started crying and saying that she didn't want to be evil, and had to be coaxed to the table by a Slytherin Prefect.
"Oh I sure hope that you are, you incompetent brat. Now, I believe it's about time you paid for your insolence!" At that moment the door opened. Narcissa was in the doorway, looking on at the scene in front of her. Lucius hastily lowered his cane and smiled fakely at her.
“Then keep your fat mouths shut!” Said Potter, before dragging the other two away. Draco scowled after him.
Blaise went onto his knees and leaned over towards Draco to whisper in his ear as well. His breath tickled. Draco giggled.
. Then he looked at Viktor, really looked at the way the other boy gazed a Granger. And it all clicked into place.
I saw him posed over a shelf of what looked like self care and cosmetic bottles and tools, a resigned yet analytical expression taking over his fake features. He began picking some items out, some which I recognised like a hairbrush and comb set, Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, a nail file, and a small bottle of Ursula's Facial Care. These were followed by more bottles which had weird and name based brands, such as April and May's Caring Conditioner; made for ragged locks and split ends! Cheryl Sheelar's Sherbert Scented Shampoo, Basil's Basic Bodywash and three different moisturizers, in the colours red yellow and blue. He tossed me some make up brushes and a couple of sets of eyeshadow thingymajigs and whatnot. I honestly never have a clue when it comes to anything at all makeup based.  He also picked out a curling iron and a bottle of expensive perfume.
“Mr Zabini, that really isn’t necessary.” McGonagall told him hesitantly, while Draco heard Weasley guffaw.
“Well that’s another day’s problem, I could definitely do with some dinner. KREACHER!” She shrieked and the elf popped up next to them.
After he was done with twin french braids, he tied the ends with light blue ribbon. It made her look like a little girl, like more of a sister than a mother, and lately he supposed she was. He kissed her cheek goodbye and left her to her own devices, leaving the room.
“That was really something!” He said. “You guys should duet on stage!” Draco exchanges a look with Pansy and she shushes him before he can answer.
His mind bled with the warnings Aunt Bella had given him about the outside world, about the disgusting nature of muggles, about how you cant trust anyone apart from his Auntie, and that Grimmauld was the only safe place from his awful traitorous parents.
“Of course I’m not going to tell anyone.” Pansy huffed. “I love you too much you idiot. I just think it’s a shame.” She sighed against him and wiped away a remaining tear. “We would make so much sense.”
"To the left is the girls' dormitories, and to the right is the boys'. I wouldn't mix them up if I were you." She said, gesturing to either side. "There is a spiral staircase going up to the first years dorms. The older you get, the closer to the ground you get. You are all at the very top, so you get all of those wonderful stairs." She clasped her hands together while grinning as everyone groaned in pain. "There are three different rooms between you all, each with 4 beds. You can sort all of that out between yourselves, as long as you're sleeping a bed, I don't care where. Okay, you eight girls, come with me, I'll lead you up. Boys, just carry on going upwards, and at the top there'll be four doors and all of your luggage. Please don't fall down the stairs. Come on then, girls!" She led them up the left staircase. The remaining 7 boys went up the right one.
“I’m keeping on top of Greg, Vince and Pansy’s workloads, plus my own with all the subjects I’m taking. I’m also tutoring Octi to the best of her ability, planning quidditch strategies for next year, organising a Halloween party just for us Slytherins, and I’m pretending to date Pansy! I’m tired Blaise, like all the time. I guess I just figured I don’t have the time to piss of Potter.”
Octavia was then tapped on the shoulder. She turned around and was faced with an ever cheerful Martha Robinson.
“Hello gorgeous and handsome, how are you tonight?” Pansy came over to them dressed in a black mini skirt, a low cut black top, fishnet tights, black heels and a pair of black cat ears.
Still, to show support, he caught her eye and gave her a big thumbs up, and saw Neville mirror his motion from behind. Neville stood to attention as soon as Professor McGonagall called out, "Longbottom, Neville!"
“Come on, you big baby, stop crying! We need to get Draco back to normal, he’s having one of his ‘moments’.” She dragged him through the halls, struggling somewhat at the weight difference.
Something feels off about this train ride, but not in the usual 'oh right I'm an Eighth year with Seventh years and there's a distinct lack of First years' off feeling, but something that's different from the norm of train rides. We haven't been disturbed in our carriage, which is change I guess...I got it! Malfoy hasn't passed by out carriage to offer some entertaining bigotry or Slytherin's are awesome themed remark! It's a constant I didn't realize I missed but now I can't stop thinking about it. I wonder if Malfoy is even on the train? Is he coming back for Eighth year? Are any Slytherin's coming back? I spoke for him at his trial and saw that he was excused of all charges, but I would understand if he isn't. Draco Malfoy's always been an odd constant for the Hogwarts life, whether it be his biting insults and remarks, his actually challenging opposition in Quidditch, or his 'Evil' schemes, which turned out to actually be evil in Sixth year, he has always been around.
“You could wear a wig, and that’s about how much I care. I am done with transfiguring your costume.”
“What a banshee you would make Parkinson, so much like your mothe-“ he was cut off by a righteous slap to the face by the women herself.
“It’s a simple question. I wasn’t aware I was within the presence of someone so dim they are unable to listen to something so simple.” Draco rebutted.
As if sensing eyes on her, she turned round to face Draco. He smiled at her but she only scowled at him and turned back around.
He walked over from where he'd spent the last half an hour in the bathroom with a plastic wrap over his head which I assumed contained another kind of hair dye, and lay down on his bed, wordlessly turning the lights off. The stars above his bed glowed softly, the light ebbing around the room comfortingly.
He jumped into actions and shoved his lift down his shirt, pulled out his wand, and put his body in a ready duelling stance.
"Don't worry, I'll be sure to be the most embarrassing and soppy girlfriend ever!" She told him, batting her eyelashes. He smirked.
And it did feel like kissing his cousin. But with his family history, he didn’t think that was a good enough excuse.
"Hush now, your most attractive friend is telling a story. Anyway, our darling Drakey has decided to make the hilarious mistake to curlify his hair again."
Yoooooo I’m so so sorry for the wait! School has started up again and I’m lowkey drowning in work, but I’m cool. I’m fine. I’m totally handling it. This chapter is more Draco centred than Octavia centred, but don’t worry, the next chapter will have more of this little been. On with the show!
“Promiscuous boy,” she tilted her hips, “you already know. That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?” She let it ring out, allowing the common room yell out a bit.
It is cubbently 3 in da mornin becos YOLOOOO. I hate meself too dont worry I apologese. Yoooo I am writin the nex chapter of Double Trouble I am soooo sorry it has been a tuff month for me. Enjoy!
Draco was running around frantically, spelling up paper cut outs and decorations to every corner, wall, and in between. Pansy was leisurely setting up a snacks table, but she harshly batted away Blaise’s hand as he reached for something.
"You'd need more than my help to look "Fabulous" Potter. Our goals for today are focused more on you not looking hideous. Starting with, pick out a shirt, and I shall judge accordingly." He bossed me about with enough of an ego to power the Hogwarts Express. Still, I listened to the git and began searching through the shirt racks.
“You’re the greatest ever Drakey-kins.” She pat his hair. He let her. “Did we kiss last night or was that a dream?” She asked and he grimaced.
So to his feelings, he squashes them down, gently mind you, and puts them safely in a drawer. They’re to be forgotten and kept a secret but regardless he keeps them safe.
“Makes sense. Hey Potter, do you mind getting me a refill?” He shoved his cup unceremoniously into Potter’s hand. Potter looked grateful for a small excuse to leave.
“Don’t worry, the feeling’s mutual.” Pansy’s voice called from the doorway. “You’re lucky we have potions first lesson or you boys would be fucked. Now grab your textbooks and shit and let’s go. There’s only so much Snape is willing to be patient for.”
“Serious talk.” Draco finishes. “You rouse each other up. I’m sure if you give him a bit of time and apologise it’ll be fine.” Draco squeezes her shoulder.
Since the party, Blaise had been constantly talking about him and Pansy’s kiss and how funny it was to get Draco drunk and singing. Then Pansy would rebuttal with a cruel comment about Theo, and they’d get caught in a screaming match, with Draco stuck between them, trying to ignore them both in favour of his book. That was the common room ticked off.
"How...how did you know all of that?" I asked him, slightly weirded out and at the same time getting a lot of Hermione vibes.
"Waiting is driving me round the twist," Harry said, stepping inside. "I brought cake. Oh. I forgot about the whole…keto thing."
It had been so long since Harry had been close to someone like this, and he was surprised by how much he'd missed it.
"Excuse me!" Harry said, in disbelief that Draco was saying any of this when they had never hooked up—not once, at the Ministry or otherwise. "I'm not a prude! But shut your mouth about it in front of my kids!"
for the engagement party, but you surely didn't do anything that falls under the heading of 'hosting'."
Harry sighs. "She went to St Mungo's and got an abortion while I was testifying at the Wizengamot. We didn't even talk about it. She just went and did it."
James, unconcerned, waved a hand. "I have plenty of money." He held up a hand, cutting off Harry's interjection. "And don't worry, I still give ten percent to charity every year. You successfully hammered your ethical standards into me. I know I'm very privileged. I know. But still, I was a Quidditch star. I make so much money
Malfoy rolls his eyes like Harry is really stupid. "She got me in, too. I think she tried to help everyone in our year. What, did you think she only helped you? You have such a saviour complex."
Malfoy's head turned, his silvery eyes looking straight at Harry for a moment before turning forward again. "I know. I'm depressed, too, remember? It's hard not to take things personally, though. With us."
reach out and soothe. It wouldn't give too much away, anymore. In fact, he needed to. They'd promised each other to be honest. Honesty, right now, was reaching out to brush Harry's hair away from his forehead; it was threading fingers through unruly locks.
Draco's eyes scanned Harry. "Yes, I agree with you, it won't be easy. We're just going to act the part. Close your eyes and pretend I'm…whomever it is you fancy." He paused and cocked his head with interest. "Whom
Harry raised an eyebrow, realising a moment too late that Malfoy was almost definitely doing the same thing from where he was seated on Harry’s right.
"Real is harder," Draco agreed. "No more good behaviour from you with me. I want to see you at your absolute arseiest. I know it's in there, despite the kind Saviour veneer."
"I don't know," I whisper. "About using it for separate spells. I'm not sure. It might not work, and we won't get a second chance."
Harry snorts so hard it makes ripples in his tea. "Oh yeah? It'll be excellent dating for me, with all the news coverage and everything. And I am so fucked up these days. Pretty sure despite being called
"By us bringing up all the shit that people could say, we controlled the message. Their entire commentary was to say they support our relationship. That will be the framing that every person will be presented with."
Malfoy seemed amused at Harry's reaction. He started to whistle with the air of a person who thought he was making a very good joke.
Salazar the cat walked past, glancing uninterestedly at Harry's head in the flames before she wandered off.
Draco pushed himself backward, off the bed and onto his knees. "I'm going to suck you off now," he interrupted, his frank words at odds with his dramatic hyperbole of moments ago. "Unless you have any objections."
"Waiting for the other shoe to drop," Harry said, shrugging. "Is it on the Prophet app? I turned my phone off."
Harry nods, and as soon as he does, Malfoy grabs his wrist and Apparates. Harry's eyes don't have time to adjust to Malfoy's bedroom—he has no idea where they are, the Manor? The room seems small— but Malfoy's hands are on his face and they're kissing again.
Harry looked up at Wilhelm in disbelief. "Do I look like I want to listen to Rump become MoM? Didn't I refuse to attend in person?"
Draco was not new to parenting. He wasn’t even new to parenting a Potter. (Albus had once told Harry he had a team of parents: Ginny, Harry, all his aunts and uncles, Draco.) But he was new to parenting
"I am telling you: this isn't your fault. We're playing this ridiculous game of politics—every action has downsides. Even if this did happen because Persephone is head of DMLE now—which we can't know—that doesn't mean that the benefits of your quitting don't outweigh it. You can't beat yourself up every time something bad happens. That way lies misery."
I use a Severing Charm to cut off a few pieces of Wormtail's clothes so I can Expand them into rat attire. The last thing the world needs is a rat inexpertly Transfigured to look like Harry Potter—
Harry, though he agrees in principle, finds it difficult to match his son's fervor, and at this point tends to look for someone with whom to share a Knowing Look.
Harry takes a deep breath. "I keep dreaming about my parents, and about Remus and Sirius, who were like surrogate parents. And the dreams are nightmares, and they keep like, blowing up in flames or being snatched away, and it's so fucking cruel. I have
"Take my word for it—where the entail is concerned, it's better to go along with it. If you ever come into possession of a bunch of their money, you can always donate it."
"You know what belonging looks like, Harry?" Draco rants. "Duck Hunt in the middle of the night, and a ridiculous best friend who will stop studying to learn a Backstreet Boys dance. Stop acting so entitled, for fuck's sake."
"Every time you manage to have fun, you start doubting yourself, feeling guilty. I get it; I feel the same way. But that's different than being unwanted. You're not unwanted. The Weasleys love you, any fool can see that. And Hermione is your family, and I want you. That's just the tip of the iceberg, too. I'd wager that Andromeda and Teddy love you already. And that's not even counting any of the Gryffindor brigade."
The question opened the floodgates. Draco sat back, staring in awe at their assembled progeny as they all started speaking at once, volumes rising as they tried to speak over each other. Draco noticed absentmindedly that Wilhelm, still clutched in Aster's fist, was in on the action, raising his hand and shouting something into the noise.
Harry reached across the table for Draco's hand and squeezed. "No, it doesn't make you a snob. It just shows you're so privileged as to be clueless. It's kinda cute."
A roar erupted as the reporters caught sight of Harry. They screamed his name and he blinked against dozens of flashes.
Nine pairs of eyes widened. Draco was too upset to worry about the fact that many of the assembled group had never once seen him angry, had never once witnessed Draco's sharp indignation, the way he knew how to make his words cut like ice. He would've worried about that at any other time, but not now.
"Malfoy!" Harry cried, throwing one hand in the air, which he immediately realised was probably more dramatic than he should be aiming for. He brought his arm down abruptly.
Hermione pinched her nose. "Harry. Honestly. I'm pretty sure he is merely one of these people who thinks their very specific coffee order, like 'double latte extra foam', is somehow a meaningful part of their identity, and the fact that a barista knows this part of them as their 'usual' gives them a thrill of belonging."
Harry grasped Draco's hand and hoisted himself up. He and Draco were standing very close, hands clasped. He wasn't going to fuck up by hesitating again, so he leaned in and pressed a kiss to Draco's lips. "Thank you."
“Oh sweet Merlin.” Harry clamped his hands over his ears, but then pressed on, “Did she negotiate using orgasms?”
Latching onto the idiom, Harry snapped, "Wouldn't take much to scare you where Hippogriffs are concerned."
"We play Quidditch still, despite Draco's old man knee," Harry blurted. It had started a few years ago, at James's insistence, every time they got together with Scorpius and Draco. Harry loved playing Quidditch with his kids—and James could out-fly him any day of the week, but it wasn't the same as going up against Draco. Trying to get the Quaffle from James always felt a little bit like Harry was teaching James on his safety-broom and pretending to let him win. Trying to get the Quaffle from Draco felt like he was back at Hogwarts with stands full of students cheering and screaming.
"So you don't…have sex anymore?" Harry asked, wincing at this entire conversation and, indeed, at his entire life.
to sack you," Hermione said, her face considering. "He hasn't wanted to before now, because there'd be an uproar and you haven't done anything to justify it in the public eye. But if you did that, he'd have to."
When they had said their goodbyes and gone, Harry hugged Draco from behind and pressed a kiss to his neck. (Draco wouldn't admit to a living or departed soul the extreme tenderness he felt in response.) "Good thing you're here to distract me when she goes home. I think I would've been a bit of a mess about it if I were still living alone."
For a long moment, Draco was silent, and Harry worried he'd made a grave miscalculation with regard to Draco's banter threshold.
"You know what really gets my goat?" Draco continued, gesturing wildly. "The idea that the spells taught at Hogwarts are somehow not 'foreign.' Last I checked, Latin originated in what is now Italy. Nearly every spell taught there is 'foreign.' I don't see them teaching spells using Old English incantations. When they want to levitate an object, I don't see them saying
"And when I was living here?" James asked, fingers tapping on his knee. "Because I can't decide if I was blind or if maybe you were, because you were so,
do that if they were pretentious wankers, which they weren't, but Harry appreciated the company, cigars or no cigars.
At that very moment, Nico operatically jumped octaves, sending Lily into a fit of giggles. Harry skeptically raised his eyebrow at Draco.
Draco loosed a loud sigh, which made Harry grin. "No. I meant, you peeled with a charm and then chopped with the knife. Why don't you simply chop with a charm?"
“Huh,” Draco said speculatively after a stretch of silence. “Turns out flamingoes are boring. More boring still than peacocks, and I thought they were dull.”
"Moreover, Potter," Malfoy continued, his face shimmering with amusement and elation at having the upper hand, "Did you not know that Azure Cup is a worker-owned co-op?"
Harry carries the forks in and gives Draco what he intends to be a stern look. "It's one o'clock in the morning. You want to play Duck Hunt?"
It was mesmerising, watching the Muggles skating up and down, stopping at the top on the edge. Harry wondered what that edge was called.
Draco looked miffed as Harry wandered to the closet to dress. A few minutes later, Harry turned, holding his hands out. "Is this good? Do I look like Concerned Father Harry?"
"Right," Harry said. "Wouldn't want to get the timing wrong as we look back on the long list of your childhood misdeeds." He finished with the carrots and grabbed an onion and his wand, Vanishing the onion peel, then swapped wand for knife and sliced off the root end. "So it's really bad, then. That Rump is passing laws about what Hogwarts can teach."
"Not the point, Harry," he drawled, and tossed an arm over his eyes. "And incidentally, threats of sexual violence aren't the done thing anymore."
"Better get a move on, lads," Wilhelm's voice shouted from Harry's pocket, causing Harry to jump about a foot. "Auror Diggle's map just told me that there's a crowd forming outside the DMLE offices."
Draco frowned as Cornfoot walked out of the hologram and someone Harry didn't recognise walked in. "Why on earth haven't you asked me for help?"
"You're right." Draco dragged a hand through his hair, then looked away from his work. He stood, reaching for the baby. "My turn."
Ron grinned. “That I had a treehouse with wards strong enough to keep out all siblings. And inside it, a magical sandbox—we couldn’t afford one, ‘course—with all the cool little sand broom toys that would fly around the sand castles and stuff. And I’d have money for new clothes and become Head Boy, and a star Quidditch player. You know, the usual.”
"No!" Harry laughs. "I noticed your flat was kind of bare. And you said that you felt like you didn't belong here, but you
“Well of course not, but the institution can go fuck itself,” Draco said with a mouthful of foam, spitting into the sink and rinsing his mouth. “I meant if it was about proper selection of a lifelong romantic partner.”
Potter doesn't deny it, but he pushes himself up and kneels, feeling around on the ground with his hands.
His new vantage point gave him a better view of Harry, who had thrown his head back, mouth open, eyes closed, lips curled up in an echo of joy. Transfixed on Harry's face, Draco rose and sunk back down. Harry's eyelids fluttered, he exhaled shakily.
to ignore you. And then the next thing I knew, I was neck deep in Charms theory, bewitching badges. I could never just…let it be. And that was before the war and all that entailed."
One of the witches looked up. "Thanks!" she said, then waved her wand to add the letters to the squares.
Malfoy heaves a dramatic sigh. "Well, there go my plans for the evening. How can I stay entertained without a Harry panic spiral?"
"Investigation Brigade? I don't know. Whatever it was called. I thought I was signing up for a spot of school-sanctioned bullying, not to be a Death Eater. That came later. False advertising, it was."
“I asked Penelope that,” Malfoy said. “If we should have a list of things to think or talk about or something. She said ‘you won’t need it.’”
The chain is between us, and Potter wraps a hand around it. "Do you think we can both use the magic for our own spells at the same time? Otherwise we need to Apparate together, to the same place. I don't want to force you to come with me. Coming with me is a really bad idea. And we have no wands, so limited options on the other end."
Harry’s head snapped up. Draco stood in front of him, arms crossed. Was this meant to be his opening? His chance to make a move?
Harry gasped, laughing again, as his head hit something hard. "Ow," he laughed, between kisses, reaching up to hold his head. "I whacked a knob."
Draco squeezed Harry's shoulder. "Harry is the best card in our hand. We want to make sure we play it strategically. Thoughts?"
There was Ron saying to Albus, "You lot need to realise that we're old. We will pay for this tomorrow. We can't let you keep giving us more whiskey!" He was speaking
Preparing to Apparate the next morning, Harry was exhausted. They’d stayed at the pub far too late, planning. Well, Hermione and Draco planned. Ron and Harry drank. He’d taken a Sobriety Potion before bed to avoid hangover.
Harry felt an urge to defend Draco, but, not wanting to screw this up, he ran it through his mind first—is that what he would do if he were in love with Draco? Seemed likely. "Look, I know it's hard to believe," Harry said, concentrating his attention on Albus and Scorpius, who surely had the most reason to be upset about this. "And we're sorry if this causes any of you grief or worry. But it's really our concern, not yours."
It’d been ages since Harry had tried to come up with a weekend activity. Not since his kids became teenagers who didn’t want to hang with their dad on the weekend. When his kids were little, he’d taken them all sorts of places, both magical and Muggle, on the weekends. They had a membership at a Muggle science museum and the Diagon Alley
He went to class, and sat in the common room smiling at Seamus and Neville's reenactment of a mishap from the greenhouse, and ate some food, and let Ginny experiment with hair charms on him. But he felt numb—more numb than he had in awhile, and the feeling of going backwards on the fucked-up scale was worse than being fucked-up in the first place.
"It's going to be harder now, this thing with us." Harry rubbed his palm down Draco's arm. "Because real is harder."
"I—I don't want—you should have one part of your life where you don't feel that way, and I—I asked you to get married to save the world. I asked
Harry's face splits into a wide grin. Draco is almost never this inarticulate. "Did you just say 'et cetera' while asking me to define the relationship?"
was the reason Harry'd had to quit the recreational Quidditch league. Albus had gone through a phase where he was so clingy that Ginny couldn't handle all three kids on her own while Harry was out for practice one night per week. They'd tried to make it work for awhile, but everyone was so exhausted that they'd eventually given up. And after quitting, Harry had fallen asleep in Albus's bed almost every day for a
Before Harry could respond, Teddy burst out laughing. When all eyes in the room turned to him, he started laughing harder. "I'm sorry—it's just—oh, Merlin." He pushed his curly turquoise hair out of his eyes. "It's just—I suddenly get it. You two. Together."
"You know what?" Harry said, finding that he had negative fucks to give about this. "Fine. You can give me as much money as you want, any time."
"Relax," Harry said, pointing his wand at his shirt and watching it tuck neatly into his trousers. "I'm not sure I'm ready, but I'm not
Draco opened the door. "Hello. Come to celebrate our star-crossed love?" He didn't smile, but it looked like it was a near thing.
Harry stared for a moment too long. "Ah, right. Because, that's what bodies do. Kissing, arousal, what not. It's…biology."
“Harry, you’ve been absolutely perfect, the best boyfriend someone like me could ask for, and I mean that.”
Despite knowing that Draco had likely spent hours in the kitchen preparing dinner, Harry had admitted that all he really wanted to do was fall asleep, safe and secure in the knowledge that he’d have Draco beside him all night long and have Draco to wake up next to in the morning. Draco had agreed, excusing himself to return to the kitchen and clean up while Harry bathed.
Much like the start of their relationship, the start of their journey into the bedroom had also been slow.
Harry was silent. This wasn’t what he had expected, but he owed it to Draco to consider his own thoughts and feelings before responding. They’d meant it when they said they were going to have clear, constant communication, and Harry knew whatever he said next would be vital to whether or not he and Draco could have a future together.
LEE: Well, that wraps up a rather surprising episode of “Cool as Dice.” This is Lee Jordan coming to you live over the Wizarding Wireless Network. Stay tuned after these words from our sponsors for the next episode of “You and Your Nuts,” a Wixcast full of gardening advice featuring Professor Neville Longbottom, and remember to join Harry next week as he leads Darko into his first dungeon!
HARRY: Well, a character - Darko, in our case - can’t run and be quiet or stealthy at the same time, even if he is a rogue. Darko can walk and be stealthy, though, if you’d like to do that.
On their anniversary, Draco had surprised Harry with a weekend holiday to Malta, where the Malfoy family had a vacation home. They spent time sightseeing and lounging around on the beach, though Harry had been somewhat disappointed that Draco was nearly religious about his use of Sun-Safe Skin Charms and didn’t seem able to tan.
Granger shrugged. “Does the source really matter? Data is data, and frankly, they have more respondents than Ministry-funded polls.”
HARRY: All right. (laughs) There wasn’t any danger of discovery up here, but you make it to the hatch.
HARRY: Roll for strength then—you’ll use the 20-sided die again—it’s a pretty rusty hatch door and looks like it hasn’t been opened in a while.
“I did some searching after the War, out in the Muggle world. I realized while I was at Hogwarts that most people seemed to really enjoy talking about sex and dreaming about having sex and, well, eventually having sex. And I, I just
“Now, Harry, I know you had your differences in school, but that was literally a second-year-in-Hogwarts ago! Besides, you’re mates now because of Hermione, aren’t you?”
Harry gazed off towards a potted plant, biting his lip, until Draco brushed a hand against his cheek and redirected him back to Draco’s eyes.
"Yeah, their brand has really gone downhill since Potter joined. Well, since Voldemort went there I guess, but I blame Potter for most of the Hogwarts drama."
After I'd dried my hair sufficiently enough, I picked up a blue hairbrush. How do I...? No, no, I knew how to do this. I'd watched enough people do it. You just kind of put the bristles through your hair? Yeah. And then it turns smooth.
The second and last film they watched was called ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’. Even though it had Christmas in the title, it was very Halloween-ish, with the main character being called the Pumpkin King. The movie was was very odd. It didn’t include real people who looked like they were trapped in the box, they looked like drawings. Jack, ever so informative, told her that this was called ‘animation’, and the way they did it for this movie was that they made tiny models of the characters, and then moved them ever so slightly, took a picture, moved them again, took a picture, until it looked like they were moving on their own. Octavia supposed the muggles had to handle not being able to spell things in their own silly little ways.
"I've been homebrewing. In my castle, so, castle-brewed. And I want to sell them, but Uncle Bill said I can't sell food without being registered as a business and I can't do that without a business plan, hence…"
This was a slight shock layered on top of what was already always a frenzy. He knew he had mere seconds before chaos descended.
"No, and he said to tell you that it's not urgent and that you shouldn't worry. I believe his exact words were, 'Tell my dad not to get his wand in a knot.'" Jorgen smiled.
Over Hermione's head, Draco caught Pansy's eye. She was talking quietly with Ron, and when she caught Draco's eye, she winked. Ron, for his part, looked, at the least, resigned—but possibly, understanding.
"It's not a threat of sexual violence!" Harry said, almost choking in his attempt to defend himself. Draco let his head fall towards him with a supremely unimpressed look. Harry sighed. "Yeah, okay, fine, it is. Sorry."
Harry bursts out laughing and shoves Draco's shoulder. "You are insufferable. And don't say that. I'm nothing like my upbringing."
"Tell me, Potter," Rump began, "in Magical Britain, are law enforcement or Ministry officials above the law?"
"Please. I would like to hear your thoughts. If you're incapable of providing them, I can call Hermione—"
"Scorpius and Albus just Flooed—they're on their way over to listen to the Vow with 'us.' They assume we're listening together." Harry stared for a beat too long and Draco snapped his fingers. "So get your arse over here."
He frowned. What did he even want to say? "Shouldn't I be feeling better by now? I'm feeling worse than I was before, in some ways."
" By the end, Harry's voice had unintentionally risen in volume, and some of the people nearby seemed to be staring.
Hermione extracted a hair tie from her pocket and pulled back her hair, a sure sign that she meant business.
"Because it would be embarrassing for them to have to lock up a bunch of well-known, upstanding citizens," Scorpius added, coming to sit on the arm of the sofa on Albus's other side.
this. Magical Britain needs this. Do you know how much joy you could bring to people, distracting them from their sorrow over Rump?"
Harry's heard her say that dozens of times over the years, to various brothers who've pissed her off. To Ron after he told Molly she was dating Dean. To Fred after he turned her favourite jumper into a rat and couldn't change it back. To Percy, after the war.
Harry turns and looks at him. "She didn't do anything! But yeah, she is, isn't she?" He grins. "I love her."
"Albus realised he was gay because of Dad's old NSYNC Christmas CD," James said easily, then started singing along. "
"It's important to fancy each other," Harry said, continuing to talk as if he were an expert in this strange topic, "because it keeps you young. It's hard to feel old if you're all jelly knees and fluttery stomach about someone."
Harry looked around, as if Hermione were going to appear, sober, to save him, but he could only see bad influences, and the harm was done now, anyway, wasn't it? They drank the whiskey.
She left the room quietly, without drama, and Harry threw himself face first onto the bed, burying his head in his pillow.
We have magic, but it can't leave the bounds of his cellar. We have a pile of shit. We have a corpse.
There was dancing, and shouting, and screaming along to a Weird Sisters super-medley, and Teddy and James performing Bohemian Rhapsody, and Ron shouting every single lyric to Mr. Brightside. Harry never let go of Draco, because he needed the anchor of another person who understood the truth of what was happening here. As if Harry himself had a grasp on the truth of what was happening here.
"So we'd like to invite our guests of honour to centre stage!" Scorpius waved his wand, conjuring two identical thrones.
Harry’s eyes dropped to Draco’s lip. He wanted to test it. He wanted to lean in and kiss Draco, swipe his tongue over that lip. He might taste of pineapple or papaya.
“That may be true,” Harry said, because he remembered how desperate he was. “But you’re still a wanker.”
?! Malfoy doesn't need to work; he has like, family coffers and investitures. Is that the word? What's Malfoy doing here?
Five minutes later, Draco had finished his explanation of the uses of the different items. Albus loaded the baby gear into the Floo-ready fire and hollered, "The Snake Pit!" The flames whooshed, and the stuff disappeared.
"But I didn't want marriage with a lover or partner. It just—there's so much tied up in it. So many expectations. So many ideas about what children owe their families and what spouses owe each other. Like the weight of my ancestors' judgment would be weighing down on me, every portrait from the Manor, somehow exerting influence or judgment on my actions. I don't want to be a
"She will not stop crying! We have the milk perfect—you know we took a class in that, just like Potions, no big deal—but she won't drink it. Is she going to hate us forever because we only have useless man nipples? We're trying to do the swaddle charm they showed us at St Mungo's, but it is not working at all; her arms keep popping out the top! And the nappy!" He paused, inhaling. "We've been home for like, what, twelve hours? And I'm convinced there's faeces on every surface of our flat. Why did they let us take her home? She isn't even
By the time Albus and Scorpius returned, Harry had all his papers restored to their proper sizes and organised into piles on the conjured desk. Albus put a plate of shortbread fingers—Harry's favourite—next to him.
Lorraine greeted him at the door and snapped her fingers to relieve him of his cloak, gloves, shoes, and bag. They chatted for a minute before Draco made his way into the house.
Harry pulls himself together and Apparates home, landing in the sitting room. Hermione's standing in the kitchen holding a mug of tea. (Not one of the fancy cups Aunt Peggy brought, Harry notices, one they bought from a market that's covered in a scene from Winnie the Pooh.) She looks nervous for him, like she's been waiting.
The duel resolving in the opposite direction? I start to feel nauseated before I even properly imagine it.
Harry dropped to his left knee, still rubbing his right. "Okay Al, listen, first things first. If a baby doesn't stop crying when you've tried milk and nappy and whatever else, strip them naked and make sure there's nothing going on that you couldn't see—like a hair wrapped around their finger or something." Harry had once been traumatised by a photo of a "hair tourniquet"; it haunted him, which had the benefit of meaning he would never forget.
Draco flopped onto the sofa. "What even is a 'relationship'?" he asked, raising his hands to trace air quotes.
“I said I like you and you didn’t respond, just came back with some tangential thing and left me sitting here wondering if you like me back.” Harry kicked his shoes to the side. “Which is ridiculous, because I am not twelve.”
Tea. They should have tea. He wished he'd brought his wand. He rose, filling the kettle from the tap.
Harry considers interpreting this as an insult, but Malfoy doesn't look like he's harbouring any rude thoughts about Hermione. He looks like he is trying to figure out how to keep away from the conga.
Draco reached out a hand and placed it on Harry's cheek. "It's not your fault, you insufferable Gryffindor." His thumb rubbed back and forth over Harry's cheekbone.
Watching Hermione's face as she takes in Malfoy's response, Harry relaxes; he wants to cheer. Once he's convinced Malfoy is passing Hermione's test, he realises he's not sure what Malfoy's talking about. "Wait," Harry says, "what's personal fiction?"
Before he could answer, a purple envelope appeared in the middle of the air, zooming straight for Harry.
Draco leaned forward to kiss this ridiculous man, but Harry turned his face to the side at the last second.
"I can spell the sugar out of it, and transfigure the wheat into almond. It leaves it a bit…dry, but it's fine."
He'd known that Rump would attack him, and therefore that he'd attack the DMLE, but this was so soon and so…indiscriminate. The entire department.
you! You can’t make someone meditate,” Harry says. “I just don’t understand how you can just accept that you’re going to hiccough for the rest of your life. You’re a wizard! Surely there’s a solution!”
"Your mother was fifty-one when Scorpius was born," Astoria retorted, her mouth curling up in amusement.
Malfoy promptly inhales his drink and splutters all over the bar, spraying liquid in a wide radius. "Have I
“Until the next time we meet, this is what I want you to do,” Penelope said, her tone gentle. “Go visit Madam Pomfrey sometime today. I will let her know you're starting a course of Serotonin Potions. If you find yourself having depressive thoughts—such as thinking that this school year is a waste of time, or thinking that the new Ministry is going to be, what did you call it? A bureaucratic, corrupt nightmare?—try to pause—”
"I'd really like to," Harry whispered. For a long second, Harry thought Draco was going to step away.
"Harry," Draco says, and his voice has lost all its usual irreverence. "Trust me when I say, and I would know, you do not make people feel unwanted. You give everyone a chance. You give people chances who don't even begin to deserve them."
Harry keeps sneaking glances at Malfoy, remembering that first night when they were at the club. The atmosphere is similar in some ways—music, lots of people—but that's where the similarities end. They're not drunk, and they're not hiding, and they've spent the last few weeks figuring out how to be
Draco leaned closer, over his quiche. "Looks like we're starting to plant the seeds right now. Good. All I'm saying is, yes, it might be difficult to pretend to be in love, especially at first when everyone expects us to be all lovey-dovey. But don't pretend that we're not both excellent catches. No one is making out poorly in this arrangement, and you can't convince me otherwise."
It wasn’t that Harry wasn’t getting along with Malfoy—Harry’d just kind of ignored him, like Harry ignored most everyone else. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He always had half an eye on Malfoy, if they were in the same space. Old habits.
? He's a stickler for rules and doesn't love Rump. If we asked him to clarify these points, he'd probably raise it through the ranks."
"Of course it's not the same." Hermione's hair sparkles with magic. "We all had different things to deal with last year. But you cannot
Harry laughed. "Seriously, though, I know what you're saying. But if being together would make us happy now, explain to me how the 'right thing' is to be apart, when that's the thing that would make us both unhappy?"
"That wasn't the baby," Harry whispers. "For me, it wasn't the baby. We never really clicked again, after the war. For me, anyway."
After all the kids had left, Harry flopped into an armchair, exhausted from the pressure of getting that right. "Now we need to tell Ginny and Astoria. And you need to tell your parents, I guess."
"I wanted—I wanted to get to grow up!" His voice gets louder, agitated. "I wanted to have sex! I wanted to be in love with someone like my parents were!"
A bloke wearing a Nirvana shirt arrived; he shouted hullos to his mates, threw down his board, and dropped into what Harry was pretty sure he'd heard the skaters refer to as the "bowl."
Harry turned, and the mediwitch caught sight of his face and turned bright red. "Ah, yes. Of course. I'm so sorry, Mr Potter! Er, anyway, I just wanted to update you. She's five centimetres dilated."
"Excuse me," Harry said to the wizard who was bringing up the rear of the queue. "Are you waiting for the Azure Cup?"
He has a vision of Ginny, the way she looked at the beginning of the battle, how happy she was to see Harry. And how, after, he let himself use her as a way to feel normal despite feeling dead inside, how easy it had been to let the momentum carry them along. But then, a baby—the man on the TV stares at Harry (
Both? As in the exhaustive list of everyone in this workshop consisted of two people, Harry and Malfoy?
Harry glanced at Draco, and the fear and worry coursing through Draco were reflected back in Harry's eyes. They walked into the bizarre atmosphere of the room and sat on the sofa opposite their children. Albus made to take Aster from Harry, but Harry held her closer and flashed a look in his eyes like
"You know that I don't care if I get the Malfoy family…money, or whatever. In fact, I'd kind of rather
Malfoy sighed, and somehow his eyes flashed with hurt but his mouth retained the shape of amusement. “Penelope would say you’re suffering from unhelpful thinking. What were the logical errors she taught us? All or nothing thinking. Jumping to conclusions. You should come up with an alternative thought.”
"Usually no one asks me if my wrist is going to get sore unless it was one of my dormmates making a vulgar joke about self-love," Draco says, trying not to smile. "I couldn't understand why you were suddenly talking about that."
"Dad." Scorpius clenched his fingers on the arm of the sofa. "You can't just…if you two break up, Albus and I will still be married. You two will still be
"There's fucking rats in here. I thought you were supposed to be all posh, or whatever." He's sitting on the floor, his back against the stone wall, leaning his arms on his bent knees. His hair is stringy—not the unattractive-attractive way Potter's hair should be, but like he hasn't bathed in months. He meets my eye. At least the swelling in his face has mostly cleared. "I thought rich people would be able to keep out vermin."
Draco stiffened, then turned, outraged, hand on his hip. "Is that a criticism, Mr Floormat Father?" A long pause, then Draco snorted. "Honestly, that sounds a bit like 'Fleamont Potter'. I think we know where you got it from, now. Being a pushover is in your blood."
"I grew up with my aunt and uncle. They locked me under the stairs. They told me every day how much they wished I wasn't there. They literally said to me, every day, that they wished I didn't exist. I just—it's a big deal, to make the decision not to want another human."
"I mean," Ron said, "if I was going to be worried about his being a bad person, I'd probably focus on the Death Eater thing."
Harry sent his Patronus ahead to tell Bill and Fleur he would be right inside, then took a detour to Dobby's grave. It'd been awhile since he visited, so Harry brushed the sand off the rock that served as Dobby's grave marker. He sat down for a minute next to the grave, listening to the crash of the waves.
in his CD player, then flops onto his bed, feeling numb. The pillow smells vaguely of Draco, which sort of pisses him off.
Harry wanted nothing less than to continue emptying his house; he wanted to collapse onto the floor. Harry hadn't moved since he and Ginny had split, and that was almost twenty years ago. He'd thought his house was nearly empty for the past 36 hours. Yesterday at lunchtime he'd told Lily that all he had left to move out was "the last few things."
Sadly, he also knew that Hermione and Draco would convince him, if they put their mind to it, and before he knew it, he’d be wearing stilettos to work.
“Huh?” Harry turned to her. He wasn’t used to Hermione complaining about assignments unless they were for Divination.
“How have you never been to the zoo?” Harry asked as they walk out the front door and into the chilly sunshine. “It’s like a ten-minute walk from your house. We can walk on the canal.”
Albus was turning away and cutting off the connection as he said, "Love you, too" and Scorpius called, "Bye, Dad Two!"
Harry pressed his lips together, determined not to talk to Malfoy anymore, if that’s what he wanted.
Scorpius and Draco stood looking down at Harry and Albus, on the floor covered in soot. In unison, they each held out a hand. It was like a scene out of some odd blond horror film.
"It doesn't mean we're not in it together," Hermione says, frowning. "It doesn't mean we're not, what did you say? Going it alone, together?"
"I've never fucked a grandfather before," Harry said, flopping back onto his elbows. "At least. I don't think I have."
"I think people will be focused on the fact that you're arguing for civil liberties. I don't think you need to make it any bigger than that. If you want, maybe Dennis can make some kind of public show of asking you, so it seems like you're responding to the call rather than eagerly jumping at the chance?"
The light changed, and they joined a group of people crossing the street, heading down to the path on the canal. “You’re—
Hope everyone is staying healthy. I'm hunkered down at home, still! Starting to think I might not know how to go back to the world when the pandemic eventually ends...
He shucked off his robes and shoes, put away his bag, and walked curiously into the kitchen. James stood, head back, mouth open; Lily faced him from across the room holding a tub of pretzel nuggets and wielding her wand. Nico, amused, lounged on the sofa watching, and Harry, surrounded by floating ingredients and autonomous knives, was cooking.
Harry reached out and grabbed Draco's hips, dragging him down, prompting Draco to keep his rhythm. "You can't honestly think that faking a marriage is entirely ethical. I mean, it's like, not
Draco's flat, in a Muggle building near RAMag, is nicer than Harry and Hermione's building, but not by much. Harry looks up at the building, wondering what Draco's parents would think about him living here. He wonders if they know about it.
Behind Potter, I see the humanised rat fall from two feet onto hands and knees, then drunkenly wobble-crawl into the wall.
Harry scowled. "You're mocking me! Or, no—" He cocked his head, like he was figuring Draco out. "You're trying to distract me, actually."
personality and tendencies—he wasn't talking about Harry Potter, the Saviour, or Harry Potter, father to James, Albus, and Lily, or Harry Potter, Head of the DMLE.
Hermione puts her tea down and strides over, arms out, and wraps him in a hug. "No one acts perfectly all the time. Especially if they have lots of trauma."
Draco hummed in agreement and Harry gave him a sympathetic look. Their kids didn't understand the way it felt to have fought a war against fascists and then live to see a new set of subtler fascists rise to power. Obviously Harry wouldn't prefer the death toll of another Voldemort, but at least back then it had been clear what they were up against (although plenty of people had ignored that too). This was more insidious.
"Haven't forgotten," Draco said, slanting a glance at Jorgen, whom Harry just accidentally let in on their political aspirations. Harry winced, but Draco didn't seem bothered. "Let's go."
"They're fine," Harry said, "but I don't want to do small talk, that's fucking boring. Tell me about sentient curses."
At the next “workshop” with Penelope, she sat looking at Harry's and Malfoy's parchments, both with full “negative automatic thoughts” columns and nothing else filled in.
They sat in complete silence—Harry kept looking at the door, wondering which of the rest of the eighth years would be wandering in to join their den of depression—until Penelope came in.
Normally, Harry would hate being the centre of attention, but in this case, he was happy to distract Albus and Scorpius so the poor woman's cervix could dilate in peace. He launched into the whole story—how Parvati and Lavender had chosen the clothes, the argument that Draco and Lavender had got into about the cut of the trousers, his concern about cultural appropriation, and the scene he'd caused in the Atrium that morning.
"I used to try to imagine it," Harry continued, "when my kids were little. What it would be like to be them—I don't know, to make a mistake and get reassured instead of hollered at. But I could never quite imagine it, you know? Like, I knew how to
“Sir,” Hermione said, and Harry couldn’t stop looking at the way her lips were surrounded by facial hair, “we are merely following the dress code as written. Not trying to make your life difficult.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "We're doing this to save Magical Britain, remember? Snog Harry Potter, save the world."
"It's to revitalise the economy." Draco leaned against the door, crossing one leg over the other. "To support small business."
"Give them to me," Harry said, holding out his hand, somehow not too concerned about the multitude of laws they might be breaking by taking these papers. "The building has charms to prevent civilians from leaving with classified information. Oh. Wait. I suppose that means I can't take them, either. Jorgen?"
"Yes," Draco said, seeming to remember that he wasn't here to talk about their sons. He took another sip of whiskey. "Let me say what I have to say without interruption. Can you manage that?"
"Seriously though, are you alright?" Draco asks. Their eyes meet, and Harry doesn't see any joking in those silver eyes. "Buying a bunch of admittedly lovely and thoughtful gifts doesn't do much to convince me that you're okay. Which was really what this was about. You realise that, right? I wasn't cross with you; I was worried."
"Harry," Draco says, grinning, eyes closed as Harry walks him backward into the bedroom. "I keep wanting to ask you something. When you saw me that night in the club, and we started snogging on the dancefloor with that Muggle girl, what did you think about me? I still can't believe we hooked up at a club."
I have no idea what he means, since he doesn't have a Dark Mark, and I'm too much of a coward to ask. I sit next to him. We're close enough to the magic chain and the impromptu screen that we'll be able to secrete ourselves behind it quickly.
plan." He stood, crossing his arms and pacing slightly. "Is that how you planned all your Auror…raids and whatever it is Aurors do? Just, eh, worse comes to worst, it'll be fine, jump on in?"
"So it makes sense you'd connect with someone who understands the horror of the war. I mean granted, slightly different experience of the horrors. But he's probably one of the only people in the world who doesn't need you to explain why the war was so awful."
“Not hungry,” Harry said, grabbing a pack of Bertie Botts from the pile of nicked junk food in the centre of the bed.
Ginny, out of Astoria's line of sight, bounced on her trainers a little, as if to emphasise how comfortable her feet were. Harry had to hide a smile.
"Well, not with guns, of course, but there's a Ministry-approved variant on Avada Kedavra that's meant for shooting game. My mother is particularly fond of shooting, as she enjoys roast pheasant."
"I was," Draco said, taking a sip of whiskey. "Hermione and I were talking all day. Give me one minute to figure out how to say this without freaking you out." He closed his eyes, almost like he was trying to do a micro-meditation.
“Because my dickbag job makes me get out of my beautiful bed and I’m a responsible, redeemed person who works hard, for some reason I’ve forgotten right now.”
The queue advanced, and Harry was suddenly able to see a flash of white-blond hair in front of the witch with the pointy hat. Of course, he thought. He couldn't possibly get a coffee without the inconvenience of running into Malfoy. At least his suspicions about Malfoy’s mysterious “usual” had faded somewhat.
Harry reaches into the bag and pulls out shrink-wrapped condoms and lube. "Because I really don't trust using charms for protection after all that. Bathroom or bedroom?"
Scorpius's eyes dropped to the place on Draco's hip where Harry had just put his hand. "You two alright?"
"George Chambliss," Draco said without pause, sticking out his hand. "Personal solicitor to Mr Potter."
"You two are serious about this?" Harry asks in bewilderment, as Hermione Levitates the coffee table to the side of the room.
Draco pulls away. "Can we be one hundred percent clear with each other, here, Potter, since we're apparently doing this whole honesty thing?"
"No way in hell." Malfoy leans on the wall next to Harry, in the spot Neville vacated. "But I'm not going to judge if you want to try it. It's very highly valued."
weaponise your ties to Harry to hurt him, just because you were hurt by our, our deception." Tears prickled at Draco's eyes and he pushed them away through sheer will. "You
Draco’s hair was a mess, sticking up in the back, and if Harry wasn’t mistaken, thinning a bit. He looked every bit like the grumpy, entitled Malfoy heir he’d been at thirteen, only old.
Harry spun around inside Draco's arms, bringing them face to face. "I didn't get to hear about your day. You have to tell me whether Janice said that thing about the coffee."
“Alright,” she said. “Well, at least we know I was right to pair you for this. Let’s try to work through some of these. Let’s try to identify what type of unhelpful thinking you’re engaging in.”
"But isn't that what you want?" she asks. "Someone who will treat you like Harry, rather than the Saviour or whatever they're calling you these days? Part of that is being willing to be called out on your shit,
For a split second, Harry panicked. Everyone was going to realise that they had no idea. Then Harry's drunken brain told him that it didn't matter anyway, because they were drunk, and if they disagreed, everyone would just laugh. Harry raised Draco's shoe.
never on patrol. I'm in charge of the people who would be making the arrests, not one of the feet on the ground, as it were. I don't know. What can the DMLE do? This isn't like the non-Western magic where we can overwhelm the Taboo, making it arguably impossible to enforce Rump's bigotry."
Harry leaned forward, something dangerous flashing in his eyes. Draco found himself leaning back. "Too fucking
it. I nod. "Unless he has some other scheme to use me to torture my parents. One that requires me alive."
Draco blinked, as if Harry were some kind of great mystery. "Does the devil have other kitchen tasks, or just peeling?"
Harry snorted. He would never get over his amusement at Draco talking seriously and with his posh accent to an infant, his equal partner in the conversation.
Draco tried to ignore his racing heart; he pursed his lips and went rummaging in a cabinet for the dried cherries, which hadn't responded to his Accio. Offerings of stuff! Was that the only way he showed affection to the kids? He knocked his elbow into the shelf.
Draco nodded, toothbrush bobbing. “Sometimes I think no one should be allowed to get married until they’re over forty.”
Harry smacks Draco's arm. "I can't believe that when we had sex the first time, you said, 'Thanks for the fuck, Potter' afterward."
"Er, no. Not quite. I just—afterward, I just feel a bit numb. Like, what does it matter if I can come up with these imaginings, if they're not going to happen? I just feel. Blah."
He opens his door, saying loudly for the benefit of any onlookers, "Yeah, I think that book you loaned me is right over here."
Luckily, she was a world-weary barista, and said no such thing. She looked like a struggling artist, Harry thought, with her tattoos and her artsy hair. He wondered at the difficulty of working such a low-wage job, and was overcome with a feeling of compassion.
Harry sighed, all of his righteous indignation deflating out of his body, taking his energy with it. He sat in one of the chairs in front of Malfoy's desk. "I'm an idiot."
"I used to get off with strangers all the time," Draco said suddenly, looking up. "Before Astoria. Like,
Turning back to the wardrobe, Draco sighed. “Jeans and a jumper? Tell me if I’m wrong. If I’ve learned one thing about Muggle life, it’s that jeans and a jumper will suffice for almost any occasion.”
Potter nods, and I'm struck again by how tired he looks. "I know." He fiddles with his trousers. They're really ugly. They have some kind of exterior pocket mounted near the outer knee, like a handbag is riding side-saddle on the trousers. "Do you have any idea how long it will be until he gets here?"
“Accomplice to murder, in that he provided safe passage for those known as Death Eaters into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Attempted murder, in that he willfully and with premeditation planned to kill Albus Dumbledore. Assault, in that he harmed both Ronald Weasley and Katie Bell in the course of his attempted murder.”
Harry started laughing—the nervous, unstoppable laugh of the drunk and hopeless. "Sorry. Er, we're so fucked."
"Wandless magic? You don't have some sort of special pure-blood connection to the house, enabling you to like, bend the house to your will or some shit?"
Draco bursts from the room and out of the wing, stopping in the corridor and waiting for Harry to catch up with him.
"I—" Harry said, "I didn't think to ask you. I don't usually ask anyone for help with work. Unless it's someone below me."
He wanted to skip the “workshop” with Penelope, but Hermione and Ron hustled him out of their room and into his daily routine. They knew once he started the routine, he'd finish it. The hard part was that first step—out of bed, out of their room—and sometimes he needed a push. Or not a push, exactly, but kind, ushering arms.
He's lying on her bed, listening to her retches, and wonders if he needs to go into the bathroom and, what? He can't really help, can he?
“Mister Potter,” she enthused, “welcome! Tell me why the public should care about the Ministry’s new dress code.”
Draco paused his cheese board preparations, turning to Harry with concern. "You didn't use any Charms on her, did you?" His tone came out unintentionally but abruptly harsh.
“Professor Malfoy,” Pomfrey says, glancing up from a medical record with Draco’s eleven-year-old face on the front. Draco doesn’t think it’s reasonable for her to use his school medical record now that he is an adult (and a professor, at that). It doesn’t seem right for her to flip past hippogriff-induced injuries and Potter-inflicted curses every time he pops in for a dose of Pepper-Up. She continues, “Are you quite sure you’re allergic to mugwort?”
being split in two, at the moment. I just hope they'll calm the fuck down when the baby is actually here. I don't want them helicoptering my grandfathering."
Draco reached an arm out and brought Lorraine and Harry into an impromptu huddle. “I need you to move all of Harry’s things from his room into my room. And his bathroom, too. James will be staying with us for a while, and we need him to think we were always staying in the same bedroom.”
He nods, his green eyes boring into my soul. "I know, too. That you couldn't kill Dumbledore. That the Dark Lord blackmailed you to do awful things. That you didn't identify me, earlier."
Draco's face took on a new determination. "I think the op-ed might be drafted by this weekend. Will you read over what I wrote about consent and see if it makes sense? Trying to argue with Rump's people is like trying to translate ancient runes for a bunch of monkeys throwing faeces at you."
Draco pulled his phone out, scrolled for a moment, and handed it to Harry. "The LabMag office got a copy. It will be announced tomorrow."
Harry laughed again. "Only a tiny bit." He took another sip of coffee, then put the cup down far out of Dominique's reach. He gently pried her mouth off his finger and tried to distract her with wiggling fingers, instead. "How is Malfoy, these days? Do you two get along okay?"
Harry smiled. “No.” Then he worried that Draco thought he was judging him for the stretching. “But I sustained a shoulder injury at work awhile back and I do rehab exercises to keep it from acting up.”
We sit in silence for so long it stops feeling awkward and starts feeling inevitable. I've just accepted that the only thing I'll be hearing is the hum of a malfunctioning charm when Potter finally speaks.
"Well, I think either guide would tell us we shouldn't have had sex right before starting a university programme together."
How dare they make Harry feel this way? How dare they take something brilliant that made Draco act like a jelly-kneed tween and turn it into something awful—without even knowing the whole story? How dare they think they had any right to weigh in on the way Harry and Draco had decided to conduct their lives? To use Harry's enviable, love-filled parenting against him? The anger bubbled up, and Draco felt like a teenager for the second time today and for a totally different reason—because it hadn't been since about 1995 or 1996 that he'd been unable to control a surge of anger.
A nauseating series of spells left a disturbed calm in their wake. "Ew," Harry moaned. "Get out of here, Ted. It's not cool for you to see us like this. I'm aspposed to be your parent figure. I changed your nappies."
Harry's skeptical heart thawed and suddenly all he could feel was happiness for his son's excitement. Why shouldn't he buy a home? He was plenty old enough—James was 32, nearly a decade older than Harry had been when James was born.
Harry let his head fall back. "I fancy sitting on my ass, watching Quidditch, and whining about how the world is going to shit."
Malfoy stands up unsteadily. "Well then I'll be certain to break your rules, because I always move with grace and dignity, and I always treat you like shit."
Harry tucked Wilhelm into the pocket of his churidar, thankful that these trousers were, at least, new, and Wilhelm wouldn't be commenting about lint or other pocket detritus.
Her voice was terse, but Harry smiled. They'd worked together when they were both active Aurors. He could see the concern behind her stern expression. He could also see her eagerness in the twinkle of her eyes.
Lee sat up straighter. "But when did you know you wanted to be in a relationship with him, that you were attracted to him on a personal level?"
"You invited me for dinner but you don't have any food?" Draco asks drolly, raising one teasing eyebrow.
"We discussed it that day at the café," Malfoy continues, well geared up for a rant now. "We both said we wouldn't have slept together if we'd known we were to be classmates. So I assumed, like any sane person would, that we were going to pretend it had never happened and get on with our lives. Which, you'll notice, we've both been doing very well."
The whole hall was quiet, staring at the hat. The hat twitched. Once. Then twice. It then opened a rip near the brim wide, like a mouth - and the hat began to sing:
“Miss Malfoy, what are you doing threatening a teacher?!” McGonagall’s voice sounded, but Draco couldn’t make anything out. He was too dizzy.
Draco felt a bit stupid that only then had it occurred to him that he hadn’t added a truce with Granger. And without one, she would no doubt be very reluctant to help.
Octavia looked to the side to see her father facing off with the father of that ginger family, the Weasleys. She then let her gaze travel to the famiy, which included the people she saw earlier that day. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. All three seemed to be staring at the siblings in varying levels on confusion, Potter looking especially weirded out.
He was about to tell them to get off of him before he spotted Weasley in the corner of his eye giving him a death glare. He smirked at the ginger, pretending to revel in the attention a bit.
"Oh please, you were practically popping a blood vessel with the effort. Face it, charms just isn't your thing."
“Greg and Vince ‘give’ me a headache. They want to see people put their names in the goblet, and they thought I’d care enough to join them far too early on the weekend.”
By this point it was about 10 o'clock, so we could hear some people discussing plans out in the hallway. We came out of the door as some sort of weird double act, both sporting messy black hair and hoodies, yet I still felt below the mark standing next to Malfoy, his stupid perfect posture and stupid unwrinkled clothes and stupid STUPID lack of eyebags.
What a bane of his existence she was, always getting grades just slightly higher than his, always being the slightest bit better pupil, always having teacher’s fawn over her more. He frowned.
SLYTHERIN!" It called out. She took off the hat happily and flounced off towards the Slytherin table. She could see and hear her brother cheering loudly for her, with a big gin on his face. He was using his hands to project louder as the whole friend group celebrated her sorting. she blushed happily at their support and sat down next to them as the rest of the first years were organised into their houses. She noticed the muggleborn boy Danny Keett, and one of the twins, Martha Robinson, were both sorted into Slytherin. Still, she sat next to the older years. That's where her brother was.
“I have just put my name in the goblet. Ready to be picked for tournament!” He said proudly, thumping his chest.
“Oh, see! Drako also remembers my name! You are not special Borislav!” The jock ruffled the shorter boy’s hair.
“He’s cute.” Martha whispered to Octavia and they had a giggle. Their giggling stopped as the carriage door opened to reveal the largest women Octavia had ever seen. She’d had to have been a half breed of some kind, there was no natural way for a wizard to grow that tall. She kind of reminded Octavia of Professor Hagrid.
“I think we’re being a bit impolite to Shelly.” Martha interrupts them, pointing to the mermaid. Octavia raised her eyebrow.
“I’m up, I’m up!” Potter protested, trying to get up before lying back down and hissing. “Fucking forehead. Did you have to yell?”
Draco turned around to see what he was looking at and came to face hundreds of posters plastered up on Bulgarian tents. The same surly face with heavy black eyebrows. Viktor Krum.
"Well...they never said not to bring dress robes if you're a first year...who knows? Maybe there was a mistake on your list and you do need them. Or maybe something will happen that'll mean you're in desperate need of this specific dress? You just never know...therefore..." He snatched the dress out of her hands and put it in the pile of his clothing. He ran over to the till and bought it before Octavia could stop him.
“Never call me that again. And why would I want to support you try to get in an older students pants? It’s disgusting!”
She was glad that Draco was getting a life away from her, one where he wasn’t constantly trying to meddle, but she needed Pansy and Blaise and Greg and Vince.
“They were okay. I had Transfiguration and then Herbology, it was so-so. I was pretty good at Transfiguration, my match stick was nearly a needle!” She told him happily. He smirked at her.
"Set up the fireplace then. Or make some tea. Or boooooottthhhh." I whined back, burrying myself into the squishy sofa cushions. He sighed tiredly and reluctantly got up and shot a lazy "Incendio" towards the fireplace which cast the logs alight, and trudged into the kitchen to hopefully make me some tea.
McGonagall took the hat off his head and pushed him towards a quiet Ravenclaw table. Some muggleborns and first years gave a confused applause as he sat down. It was then  that his panic broke loose from the drawer in his mind to his entire body.
She gagged and quickly began to walk away before she heard Blaise say something. Something that didn’t sound quite right.
I heard him changing into pajamas and the soft "Nox" that followed. I flipped over to lie on my back and looked up at the ceiling. The stars glowed a soft blue, filling the room with a light less harsher.
The man in the doorway had a large travelling cloak on, as well as a large staff he was leaning on. Every face in the room had turned to face the stranger. He walked forward towards Dumbledore. In the clearer lighting, you could make out his face. It was heavily scarred, nearly disfiguring, as a large chunk of nose was missing. But the man's eyes. One of them was normal, small and beady. The other was a vivid electric blue and was moving robotically, not blinking once, never ceasing it's frantic and paranoid movement.
Draco stayed for a minute longer to smooth out her long blonde tresses. They fell like a halo around her head. She really did look angelic. Her face was peaceful and carefree. Draco smiled at his good work and turned off the line before shutting the door behind him on the way out.
"There'll probably be a school dance or something. I hope it's an 'I'm Sorry For Traumatising You At School' ball. I know a lot of people who could use one of those." She giggled.
“It’s been alright so far, though I don’t usually wake up this early. My friends wanted to see who entered their name in the goblet of fire.” Draco said. Borislav fidgeted a bit at the mention of the goblet.
“Good book then?” Potter interrupted his reading. Draco looked back up again and nodded. “Because you haven’t turned the page in five minutes.” Draco tried to hold back his flush.
“Does anyone remember anything that happened last night? I blacked out after our card games.” Draco asked.
While Martha gossiped with some other girls about pairings she’d seen sneak off to the dorms together, Octavia decided to do some people watching.
Draco leaned forward on his knees and went next to Blaise’s ear to whisper it. His breath hovered over the shell and Draco noticed Blaise shiver.
He fiddled with his hands a bit, hugging his forearms slightly. She kept her eyes there making sure he didn’t begin his nervous tick of scratching his arm again.
“Better than calling them ‘the mermaid’” Martha pointed out. The other two nodded in agreement, facing Shelly once again.
"Don't waste your time on him, he definitely isn't worth it." He told her. She crossed her arms and pouted. Weasley looked very damn close to laughing now.
I realize now that I went completely over the line but I don't want to talk to her again for a while, and I'm happy staying away from all other Weasley's other than Ron and George. Ugh. Even in my head it feels wrong not to include Fred. I've tried putting on a brave face for everyone but I'm not as stable as everybody in the wizarding world thinks I am. I only hope that The Prophet doesn't catch word that their beloved Chosen One is actually tearing at the seams. I did all that I could in that one week in Grimmauld Place trying not to let the paper's catch word of me and Ginny's breakup. I can imagine the heading now:
"I'm pretty tired too, actually, so I think I'll be doing a Michael by going to sleep absurdly early." Anthony stretched his arms.
The week was also passed strangely because Octavia and Draco still hadn’t exchanged a word. Both were too stubborn to talk to or even apologise to one another.
After an hour of practice and a simplified explanation of the theory between wood and metal from Draco, nearly everyone had managed to turn their matchstick into what could properly resemble a needle. This was far more difficult than charms, and had everyone tired with the effort. The only one to not manage it was Michael, who'd accidentally melted his matchstick in a move that Draco didn't even want to dwell on. This magic relied far more on control and concentration for only one thing, something that Michael lacked in buckets.
"It's a stim." Terry began. "It's a thing I do that helps me centered. It makes me feel happier when I hear, touch, smell or feel something that overwhelms me a bit. Or I have a sensory overload. I really like, um, bird noises and woolly jumpers. They make me feel safe." He explained promptly while fiddling with his cloak buttons.
"Look, uh, Finnegan and um, Thomas, I'd uh, like to apologise for my stupid behaviour in the past and if I ever, uh, targeted you specifically to bully or force my st-stupid prejudices onto," Malfoy forces out, locking his gaze onto the floor.
But before anyone could take a single bite of the food in front of them, the great Hall's doors slammed open to reveal none other than...Draco Malfoy?
Harry cleared his throat and focused on the feather, his eyes darting to Draco nervously. "Wingardium Leviosa!" The feather moved slightly, but stayed still on the desk. Harry frowned deeply.
"Harry?" Through the crowd of muggles the messy haired boy from the shop pushed his large trolley through. A snowy white owl sat in a cage on top of it. It made Draco jealous. He had wanted his own owl but the manor already had plenty and his father said that he could use their's. He didn't get a pet either, not even one of the baby peacocks to look after for the year. And he'd just started reading about how to care for them.
“Well for one, he’s over on the dance floor basically grinding against Amanda Green!” Blaise exclaimed while pointing into the crowd. Draco could just about make out the forms of Nott and Green and frowned.
They made it to the open kitchen. It was the newest room in the mansion, per Narcissa's. She wanted somewhere to make cakes and teas for her tea parties. She insisted on doing it herself, but to Draco's memory, he recalled many times when she'd forget to bake the cake, or would just serve hot water with no tea. She would try. Every Sunday Draco had tea with his mother. It was the one time he could talk to her freely without his father trying to shoo her back to bed in one of her rooms. Draco knew it was bad, but he preferred his mother to his father. She was kinder to him. She didn't know what an awful son he was.
"Um, yes. He is." Draco said, experiencing second hand embarrassment that he probably acted exactly as this boy was.
The Malfoy siblings argue, Blaise and Martha get talking, and the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students come to Hogwarts.
"He hurt our friends!" Another slam on the table. Draco tried not to flinch with the familiar sound of a book slamming down, and dug his nails into his recovered arm.
“And I told you that’s bullshit. You hooked up at the Halloween party over a week ago and you’ve been hooking up ever since and you’re. Still. Not. Open?” She emphasised each word with a clap.
"S.P.E.W is an organistaion I started in Fourth year advocating for house elf rights. It stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare."
“I told you I was a drunk!” Blaise ruffled Draco’s already messy hair. His eyes focused slightly to the other boy in the trio.
The next step seemed to be that sound would suddenly erupt from the hall, causing chaos and pandemonium, but no. It seemed it was too late to have an effect, everyone was still quietly shaken.
These were looked down upon by many pureblood students, though they soon became interested as the siblings introduced more items they were sent. A pack of incredibly detailed and intricate tarot cards, fake blood, ‘magic tricks’ that
After class, him and the other Slytherins walked upside towards the hut at the edge of the forbidden forest, where Care of Magical Creatures would be held. As they got closer, he noticed that the Gryfindors were already there, surrounding ‘Professor’ Hagrid.
“What’s going on over here?” He asked, and tried to look authoritative. Greg and Vince backing him on either side definitely helped as the crowd parted for them.
“What an awful acronym. For the promotion of elfish welfare? Trust Granger to bother herself with something like that. They enjoy serving!”
The flames within the goblet turned a sudden red, with sparks flying from it thematically, keeping every person in the great hall on the edge of their seat. The very next moment, a charred piece of parchment flew out of the goblet and fluttered down. A gasp rang out across the hall.
At one point the character called Velma lost their glasses and cried “Jinkies! My glasses! I can’t see anything without my glasses!” While feeling around for them blindly on the floor. Draco snorted and elbowed Potter.
He explained what the champions would do when they were chosen, where they going, the goblet needed another minute
Terry shot right to the first bunkbed, putting his suitcases underneath the bottom one and jumping onto the top bed. Anthony copied Terry's movements and sat underneath Terry, taking in the room. Michael went to the other bottom bunk and began taking his shoes off, leaving Draco with the last top bunk. Draco slid one of his suitcases underneath the bed, hesitantly taking the other one onto the top bunk. Walking up the steps right into the bed was a foreign concept, as he'd never been on a bunkbed beforehand, never having anyone to share with.
“And mine too if it isn’t too much trouble.” As Draco handed Potter his cup he whispered for him to water down Blaise’s drink. Potter nodded understandingly and left with a joking salute.
One girl raised a large wooden board. “We were trying to see if he’d respond to this!” At a closer look, it had the alphabet on it, paired with a ‘no’ and a ‘yes’ at the top. It looked odd.
“I am doing wonderful my little student. We’ve gotten a lead on Potter, and we plan to trap him! He has been so fickle lately, trying to get at the Dark Lord’s horc-“ she glanced up at him. “The Dark Lord’s weaknesses. It has been difficult but we’ve finally got him! Isn’t it exciting!” She smiled madly and he tried to meet her grin.
He drove the motorcycle for a couple hundred metres before taking off. It had gotten very dark by this point, so it wasn’t as dangerous as beforehand. He still risked a couple glances towards the sidecar to check the kid hadn’t jumped or anything else crazy like that.
I stared up at the stars as a comfort and felt myself drifting away again, the soft blue light blurring as my eyes began to close shut once more to fall asleep.
They both started yelling at each other, Narcissa obviously winning the argument. Octavia tugged at Draco's sleeve.
After that kerfuffle was sorted, the game continued as normal. That it, until an Irish beater ended up breaking Krum's nose.
"Don't worry about him , he's just a big joke." Anthony answered for him, leading Terry to the bench above where Hermione sat by his held hand.
He exited the cart and closed the door behind him. He turned to Draco, and Draco noticed at close proximity that he was taller than Potter. He hid his smirk.
After flying for about an hour and a half he had reached Devon. After slight manoeuvring to make sure he was on track, he could spot a familiar quaint house in the middle of a field. The Burrow.
He looked at her confusedly and took a hand up to his eyes. At feeling the sore and red skin he grimaced.
Too much was happening. He hadn’t talked to Potter since the night on the Quidditch pitch but every time he sees him, he has to stop himself from saying something hilarious and witty about how terrible him, Weasley and the Mud-muggleborn looked. He has to bite his tongue and walk on past without comment. How awful is that? And every time he did so, pansy and Blaise gave his this look that made him want to gouge his eyes out. They were truly the worst.
He thought the kid would be too tired to resist now, so that he could actually be on his way out of this bloody nightmare house.
to...and you’d become an adult! You could drink! You could drive! Draco hardly knew what driving was, but it sounded incredibly dangerous and cool! And you graduated Hogwarts or Beauxbatons or Durmstrang and went to work for the Ministry of Magic! Of course, Draco would never do that, it went against the teachings of the Dark Lord, but the premise was there!
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry that Professor Moody thought you were going to curse me. And then turned you into a ferret. And then threw you around.” Draco rolled his eyes.
“If she’s going to have a club for the cause, she ought to at least have a better name. Something like...the Club Against Unfair Treatment of Elves. That’d be at least a little better than Spew.” Draco said.
“Well, I mean, yeah. I may hate him, but it was still a bad move he pulled, and he shouldn’t get away with it.” Octavia told her.
The air felt painful, like it’d had gone through whiplash. Octavia stood over the armchair awkwardly.
After her was Neville Longbottom, who performed a great many gymnastic feats that Draco knows for a fact he wouldn’t have been able to perform otherwise.
"That won't work either. Fudge might be gone, but that doesn't mean idiots don't still work at the Ministry. To make the change you're looking for, you'd have to change it from the inside. Work your way up from inside the Ministry, and take apart the house elf laws from there. That way, not only would your say need to be heard, but you could have control to change other Creature's lives for the better, such as half breeds and Werewolves, You'd need a respected investor to back up your changes, and to at least have a friendly acquaintance on the Wizengamot, or become a part of it." He paused. "I mean, that's the law abiding way.
He yawned quietly and let his head droop onto his shoulder. As his eyelids grew weak his head begin to lean sideways until it hit something soft. He closed his eyes and sighed.
“Eager though I know all of you will be able to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” Dumbledore continued, “the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an agreed restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age – that is to say, seventeen years or older – will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” – Dumbledore raised his voice slightly for several people had made noises of outrage at these words – “is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the Tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below Sixth and Seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion. I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.”
“A normal child?” Aunt Bella stopped. “A normal child!” She yelled. “Is there no end to your disrespect and privilege, after I tried so hard to train the Malfoy out of you, and you’re still like your disgusting mother! Poor little Cissy didn’t have everything, so she goes begging for more!” She roared her sister’s name and Draco flinched. “You’ve been getting those ideas again. From those fictional books in the library. You want to be a normal child,” she scoffed, “when you are scarcely a child. You will be a man soon, a brilliant one, all thanks to me.” She neared him. “I have given you everything, done everything right, and still you yearn for more? Ambition will do you nothing when you are serving under the Dark Lord, Draco.”
It would be far too loud to move the chair closer to the sofa where Sirius was resting, it would surely wake him up. Draco’s hands weren’t at a good angle to Accio the wand towards him either, and he doubted he could muster the strength to do more wandless magic anyway. What did he have at his disposal...
“We’re just asking the Baron some questions!” A little blonde third year piped up. Draco raised an eyebrow expertly.
He’d never had his face held like this before, being the sole attention for the one person he constantly bothered for such validation. And even though Potter was squinting slightly, Draco still knew the exact shade of Potter’s eyes.
“So that’s a mermaid?” Danny asked after a minute of the mermaid and the children staring at each other. “Mermaids are real? Okay then. That’s cool. That’s totally cool I’m totally fine. Totally. I am handling this so well.” His voice began to raise.
" - Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?  He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had noticed the first years. Draco looked up at him with a gasp.
Danny was back to gaping, this time at the female Durmstrang students. Octavia gave him another sharp elbow and a sharp look.
Potter snorted. “Old times. Can’t believe that’s past tense. Don’t you think it’s weird how we’ve stopped fighting so easily?”
She’d been hanging off his arm as he’d hexed the Mudblood, cackling at how their face had been reshaped. The mudblood had fired the first shot, and told Pansy her face looked like a pig. He told her she had the weight of one too.
His suit felt uncomfortable. Too stuffy. Stupid collar that was too high up. Stupid. He clumsily took off his jacket and tied it around his waist, not caring how it looked. Blaise’s eyes followed his movement.
"Since I was seven Mother wanted me to learn about the inner workings of the ministry so I'd know how to get the best jobs. Father taught me how to infiltrate the archives to rise to power quicker and/or change any laws for the Malfoy's benefit. He wasn't just a good politician, he also knew people who could make things happen." He shrugged again.
He looked to the gold encrusted grandfather clock in the hallway. It was 5 past 5. It wasn't the weekend so he didn't have to have dinner with his father, and homeschool wasn't on in the summer. He was free to do whatever he liked in his room.
Draco shrugged. "I'm more interested in being a spectator than anything. Don't have a great urge to be entered into a death tournament. Besides, what would you do if I was gone?" He pinched Octavia's cheek, causing her to scratch at him like a cat.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! A bit shorter but I needed to post soon. Sorry if any Americans are confused with the way I spell some things, it's because I'm British. AO3 doesn't see it that way unfortunately.
"And to think I spend so long to try and keep you away from horrid language, but it was all for nought..."
The days at Hogwarts had continued well, and Octavia had soon cemented herself as the best in the class at nearly every subject, the only downfall being constantly compared to her genius brother. But she had kind of terrible since her midday outburst at Draco, and her ignoring of him at dinner. She had her reasons, and she stood by them, but she was getting concerned. It was getting pretty late and no one knew where he was.
"Ow! Ow, ow, ow I feel like I'm on f-fire!" The girl sobbed out. "It hurts, it hurts a l-o-ot! Agh!" The girl's brown skin began turning a shade of awful red.
And Potter isn’t even attractive. Draco has no idea why so many teen girls flock to him. And Potter’s so awkward he doesn’t even notice, and breaks all the pretty girls’ hearts.
“Please don’t Auntie.” He begged quietly, wand tightening in his grasp so much it dug into the skin slightly. “Please don’t curse me-“ he was cut off by an harsh slap to the face. Aunt Bella was standing over him with a new crazy in her eyes.
Draco and Octavia locked eyes and exchanged worried looks before hugging their mother. Draco held Octavia's hand and dragged her towards the wood, keeping his gaze up and away from the burning tents and crying children.
"Can't you believe this Octavia? The Quidditch World Cup! And we get to witness it. Who are you rooting for? I'm definitely rooting for Ireland, their beaters and chasers are just too good to defeat, even with Viktor Krum on the Bulgaria team!" Draco gushed to the younger girl. The boy looked to be about fifteen, with the girl looking to be eleven. She looked quite uninterested in the conversation, having her head stuck in a book.
“Well...I mean... I have plenty of time for all of that, right now I want to focus on best first impressions to the professors!” He raised an eyebrow at her.
"Stop whining!" He massaged his nose in a disturbingly Lucius-like way. "Fine, we can take a look, then we leave. I've started to feel sick." He eyed the trio.
“Good thing we’re leaving.” Sirius decided the take a small risk. “Before Trixie comes back from wherever she is.” He paid close attention to the kid’s face. It only flickered slightly, but it was enough. Cousin Trixie was the kidnapper. At the very least that question was cleared up. “I will let you take one item with you before I put a sack over your head and knock you unconscious.”
"I'm sorry." Harry interrupted him. "I'm sorry I didn't stick up for you. I do know how hard it is when someone calls your parents terrible, or drunks. It just," he sighed, "Ron was so nice to me. And he talked to me for ages about who I was, and just wanted to be my friend, and when he insulted your parents, I didn't want to be on the other side of that again. And he seemed so nice, it came out of nowhere, and I didn't know how to react. And that stuff about supporting Voldemort got to my head and- I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not standing up for you sooner." He apologised to the surprised blonde.
He huffed into the night sky. The kid was barely a kid, and looked about twenty years old. Twenty years old and still stuck in that evil house. Sirius couldn’t imagine. He got the fuck out of there before the word go, as soon as James’ parents let him.
“Hello, uh, girls?” Granger greeted them with a small wave. Draco was about to add another comment before he was interrupted by a loud squeal.
“Hey Hermione, can we borrow your button presser? Malfoy has a plan to help.” Potter asked her jollily. Her sharp eyes flickered from her book to them, landing soundly on Draco. He tried not to squirm under her judgmental gaze.
He groggily opened one eye and made immediate eye contact with Octavia. He sighed and opened his other eye. And then he saw it. The thing he leaning on.
Draco smirked. “Well, now that you mention it… Sex is fine, but have you ever overthrown the Ministry of Magic?” Draco asked. “I’m sure that’s
“You need to understand, before I explain, that I have no intentions of breaking up with you any time soon, Harry,” Draco began. “I’d like to be with you for as long as I can, but I’ll understand if you don’t want me after this.” Draco took a deep breath. “It’s not you; you’ve done nothing wrong. It’s me, but it’s not a problem - it doesn’t need fixing.”
Draco sighed and looked at the sea landscape on the wall for a while before finally answering Harry.
Minister Shacklebolt sighed. “You heard me, Senior Auror Malfoy. Due to the recent polls showing increased distrust and apathy towards the Ministry by the younger generation, we want you to complete a WWN interview.”
HARRY: I see. Why don’t you roll for performance? Yes, that’s a 17, and you’ve got a modifier that’ll make it 19! Describe Darko's pole dance. In great detail, if you can.
Their relationship had begun after some hesitantly productive collaborations at the Ministry. Neither of them had moved easily into post-war Wizarding Britain’s society, but they’d found they made good partners at work. Harry was surprisingly good at determining the likely defensive manoeuvres undertaken by a threatened group or individual in real-world situations, though he was still abysmal at playing chess. Draco readily supplied inside knowledge of former Wizarding society and its intricacies. Together, they made a good team when they slowed down enough to consider one another respectfully.
“Senior Auror Malfoy,” Kingsley broke in. “You know what’s on the line here.” Kingsley glanced pointedly at the photo on the desk. Kingsley’s daughter waved happily back, glowing with happiness in her Hogwarts uniform, wand nowhere in sight because she was a Squib. A Squib who, until recently, had been banned from attending Hogwarts. She was a visible reminder of what progress stood to be lost.
