wanted the truth—not when it came to things like that. “You can’t just let it alone, can you? Or come to your own conclusions, at least? How do you
“A variety of koi. Imported from Japan, I believe. I don’t know, really, they’re at least thirty years old,” Draco said, “It really isn’t that nice, though. The fountain isn’t even working.”
Draco took a deep breath, “If this thing is stealing my face, if it’s intelligent, then it might intend to parasitize my life, somehow. Act as my doppelganger. I don’t know.”
“S’alright,” Harry said, gulping down water to clear his mouth—Draco wrinkled his nose in distaste—“I’m sort of… on-edge a lot. I keep feeling as though something really bad is going to happen every time I go out. I guess I’ve kind of been trained to expect the worst. But I get to help loads of people, and I love hanging out with Ron all the time, and I’m only on-duty three days a week, so it kind of balances out. Hermione thinks I should get a different job, but I’m planning on sticking it out for a couple more years, anyway. Just until things quiet down. After that… I dunno. I was thinking about taking correspondence courses so I can pass my NEWTs, and then applying to teach at Hogwarts. I don’t want to be an Auror forever.”
“Maybe she should worry,” Pansy said, unruffled by either Draco’s disapproval or his subsequent emotional outburst, taking a sip of her own tea, “This place looks like it’s starting to rot away. Maybe she would know what to do about it.”
“I mean, it is a sort of thought exercise, I guess,” Potter said, “But it’s what you need to cast the spell. Go on, Malfoy, stop gaping at me. Just think of something really good and strong you can hold onto. I think about how much I love Ron and Hermione, or how pleased I was when I found out I’d got into Hogwarts, or holding my godson for the first time and knowing that he’d have a loving family, and that he’d never have to be afraid of Voldemort.” Draco cringed and Harry sighed and added with surprising gentleness, “Just give it a try, alright? It’s not so hard.” Then he was quiet, leaving Draco alone with a monumental task. ‘Not so hard’ his arse.
“Whatever you want, honestly,” Harry said. And the warm look in his eyes was nothing short of an invitation. In a rush—before he could think better of it—Draco had half thrown off the blankets and rolled up, onto his knees, grabbing the back of Harry’s head to drag him into a fierce kiss. Harry’s hair was thick and soft in his hand, and in his eagerness, their teeth hit painfully. But Draco couldn’t let himself relent for a moment. Their lips moved together, and Draco tasted the warmth of Harry’s tongue against his own. Stress, embarrassment, and months of sexual frustration found some escape through the shuddering groan that Harry made against his mouth as Draco dragged his fingernails down the back of Harry’s neck. There was a deepening color on Harry’s tan cheeks, and a wildness in his eyes that Draco felt mirrored in the eager beating of his own heart.
“Of course I am. That wasn’t the point,” Draco said, holding the wand out to Harry, who wasn’t over-quick in taking it back, “It doesn’t make you feel vulnerable, not to have it with you? It doesn’t make your skin crawl?”
“I dunno,” Harry said, “The truth.”
Draco and Harry have a post-dinner chat, following which Draco suffers a bit of a spiral.
In short order, Mimsy returned to escort Draco (with Harry tagging along behind) to the smaller of the two dining rooms. The curtains here were dark enough that, even if they had been affected by whatever rot had set into the drapes of the other room, it wouldn’t have made much difference. Despite the two fires at either end of the hall, and the candles lit in the iron chandelier, the room was frigid and dark. Mimsy had set Draco’s place at he head of the table, complete with a napkin in a napkin ring, and silverware appropriate for a four course meal. There was a suggestion of a place at the side of the far end of the table—a single bowl and spoon. Draco almost laughed at the contrast between Mimsy’s delight and the look of quiet bewilderment on Harry’s face. “If you could just get a napkin, fork and cup for Auror Potter when you send in the food, I would appreciate it,” Draco said as he sat down in his own seat, “Thank you, Mimsy.”
“Of course, Auror Potter,” Draco said, with a primness of tone that made Weasley turn an incredible shade of puce, “What hospitality the Manor has, I extend to you. I appreciate your dedication.”
By the time Harry declared himself satisfied, Draco could reliably produce a spray of silver mist. It was translucent and had no hint of a body to it, but as Harry had said, it was something. It was more productive than he’d been in months, anyway: an evolution, as opposed to a devolution. The piano had stopped playing Léandrés’s works and was entertaining itself playing piano-only renditions of classic pieces of chamber music. Harry was sprawled in the chaise lounge, and Draco was in a good enough mood with him that he bit his tongue about the heels of Harry’s boots resting on the fine fabric. Mimsy would be happy enough to curse Potter while cleaning it later. Anyway, on the whole, the room looked better than it had in the last year. Draco might have walked downstairs to find his mother making Fever Balm in the kitchen, or his father’s old hunting dogs laying before the fire. He felt his age again. Younger, lighter.
“Well it’s just a bunch of random stuff I had around that I decided to put up…” he answered somewhat shyly.
Draco looks at him like he just said the most offensive thing.
? He’s the absolute best! Isn’t he your favorite?”
Deep breaths, in out, in out…
“And that’s Harry.”
Yeah, he does.
“Oh-“she tilts her head “-why?”
, Draco answers:
Ginny is about to protest when he just runs to his room to avoid her complaining.
Harry follows him to the kitchen when he’s done, and as he struggles to put the container back on its shelf, Harry apparently feels the need to comment.
I hope you all enjoy anyway :)
“My entire heart, nay my entire existence belongs to Chandler Bing,” Draco suddenly says.
“Cheeky. Luna has told me a lot about you.”
When Draco gets home, he pours himself a glass of water and considers dinner, but then he remembers that he ate a sandwich for breakfast and decides against it. He writes down everything he has consumed today, his therapist will be proud enough of the sandwich, it had pesto
“Why does he has to be my favorite just because he’s yours?”
“Yes of course, hold on a moment,” she says.
He takes a sip of his tea. 3 calories. He looks around at all the people, with different drinks, different faces, different lives, different stories, and-
“Are you assuming, because I’m gay, I’ll jump on any guy with a pretty face?”
It feels like an enternity, when really it’s just been 5 minutes, before he finally sees Draco’s angel-like face. He almost wants to hug him, but that would probably be considered coming on too strong, especially when Draco doesn’t even go to him immediately, but goes to chat with Luna.
Then there had been Harry. Sweet Harry with his big smile and big muscles, and Draco was a bit scared of him. Well, not Harry himself, he’s probably incapable of hurting anyone, no Draco’s afraid of falling for him, he’s good on his way there, but he can’t afford a relationship right now. He can’t get Harry mixed up in all his bullshit, he’s already got Pansy and Blaise too involved. Besides, he needs to focus on school, his education is too important and it took him too much to get here.
“Harry?”
“Draco,” Lunas dreamy voice intrudes his thoughts of violence, “when’s Pansy Coming?”
Nevermind, Ginny is a bitch.
Harry looked at the clock, 5 minutes till his shift ended. Today had been long, and exhausting, but he’s making it through with the though of seeing a particular blonde later. He’s already getting in too deep, and he knows it. He has seen him one time, and chatted with him over the phone twice, and it’s definitely not appropriate to already like him so much. Whatever, life is short right?
“No. No you’re not”
“Hello,” Draco answered quitly as he gestured for Harry to come inside, and Harry happily did exactly that.
“Hello!” Harry says a little too loudly.
“Um.”
The restaurant is a small Indian place, it’s been Harry’s favorite since he was a kid, and he recently got a job there, so he knows all their secrets. Harry, if he can say so himself, is a pretty good cook. He recently started trying out new and original recipes, and so far, he has been successful.
“Everyone gather at the sofa! We’re going to watch FRIENDS!” Ron yells out.
Harry looks back at him and asks to get his number. Disaster. Draco gets up to give it to him anyway. When he looks up at Harry, he sees that he’s almost a head shorter than the giant. Of course, his bad genes damn him every day.
“You know, you’re kinda tiny”
“Do you remember when I told you about my new girlfriend?” Luna asks him, out of the blue.
There’s fairy lights, tapestries, candles, crystals, pictures, plants and just a whole bunch of not-at-all-random stuff.
He’ll start with himself, the apartment is almost spotless, it’ll be fine. If Harry gets hungry they’ll figure something out, it’s highly unlikely that Harry will judge him anyway, he’s just so kind and considerate, and always so positive…
Fuck. Jesus motherfucking christ. Those forearms could probably crush his skull. He could probably bench press Dracos weight twice. Well he doesn’t know anything about bench pressing but… oh my fuck, he’s close now.
“I- what? Why?” Harry responds confusedly.
Draco is on his 3
“It’s called petite, bitch”, he answers as he flips his hair.
When he’s done, he takes his sketchbooks and pens out of his bag, and sits on the floor, his favourite drawing position. His back doesn’t agree.
Harry looks nervous, but lucky for him, a sweet voice interrupts, taking on a teasing warning tone.
When Harry groans, Blaise laughs and calls out: “Oy Draco! Come over here.”
“Hey”
“What do you mean
Luna places a sage green cup on the table and smiles lightly at him. “Here’s your Green tea Dray, enjoy. Ginny’s coming soon, she’s gonna sit here, and hopefully you’re gonna be nice,” she says, smiling, and then she turns around and walks away.
“Um.. Would you like some snacks?” Harry says, and Draco looks panicked for a second, before his face slides back into a pleasant smile.
“Don’t remind me,” Harry groans. She grins and throws a spoon at him.
Blaise starts laughing, and Draco looks like he’s trying to hold his back. Harry must have looked very embarrassed because Draco puts a small hand on his arm
“Yes.” Bold.
“And all I wanted was some peace,” is the first thing he says to her, and a self-satisfied smirk overcomes her face when she turns to look at him.
“Yeah mate, you kind of really are.” Harry has a hard time deciding if he likes this Blaise or not.
Draco scowls, jokingly
Oh god. Please don’t be-
Short little chapter with some Drarry interraction
“Well uh, do you want something to drink, maybe?”
“I just got home, let me at least change!”
Draco looks over at them and roll his eyes fondly. He says something to Luna and starts walking towards them, and Harry’s belly does weird flip flops.
He gets lost in his own little world, not thinking about calories, his body, boys, his parents, nothing but the pretty centaur and Lanas voice washing over him.
“What do you mean?” he asks awkwardly.
“So, tell me about benchpressing,” Draco says, because what else should he say at this exact moment
He brings the tea bags to Harry, so he can pick one out on his own.
“Tea’d be nice, if you have,” Harry said, permanent smile on his face. Draco nods and heads to kitchen where he puts the kettle on.
He opens the text, it reads:
While softly humming along, he suddenly hears a pling from his phone, signaling a notification.
“He’ll be here soon enough,” Luna’s dreamy voice fills his ear, and he panics for a second.
When he gives Harry his phone back, he’s still smiling at him, and the smile develops into a grin when he reads the contact.
“Kidding, what I really meant to ask is, how many times a day do you go to the gym?”
Draco rolls his eyes and tell them all goodbye before beginning his walk home.
“Oh, so two siblings in the same friend group? That’s must suck”
“Well yes, it’s how we all met, me, Ron and Hermione met at high school, and same with Ginny and Neville”
When he has buzzed Harry in, Draco awkwardly waits at the door. As soon as Harry steps out of the elevator though, his mouth develops into a huge smile and his eyes almost sparkle. His green, green eyes…
“Awesome! Ginny, we have to go, Ron is yelling at me through texts, I’m getting worried he’ll explode,” he smiles at Ginny, who’s gently pushing Luna off her lap to get off.
Fuck him
I just started school again and it's kinda stressfull, so the chapters are pretty short rn, sorry :/ But yeah, i haven't gotten much into Harrys emotions and stuff here, becuase 1. i feel it would be a bit rushed and 2. i haven't had the energy for so much build up and detail these days.
“Well, I’ll see you soon, Draco The Pretty One.”
“Oh okay um-“ Harry gets interrupted by a loud voice from the other end of the room.
“Okay, well, please be nice Draco”, she says, like she didn’t just deeply offend him.
Harry pulls out his dimples again, and gives (with his enormous, attractive hands) Draco his phone, so he can type in his number. He names his contact
“I really don’t think the fact that she has red hair is an important detail”
Hang out with multiple people. At someone’s place. That means snacks. People who will be weirded out if he doesn’t eat anything. Fuck. But he really wants to. Okay he will just… not eat tomorrow.
They continued to chat, and Draco figured out that perhaps Ginny isn’t all terrible. Actually, she’s pretty nice. Very red hair, but nice. She looks very gay too, purple button up with pineapples and brown slacks. Doc Martens too, of course. She smirks a lot, and her wit almost matches his own.
“Are you religious?” Harry asks, because he lacks social skills.
The sunlight shines right into Draco’s eyes as soon as he wakes up, his whole body hurts from exhaustion, but he really just craves coffee like business majors crave heterosexuality. No hate to business majors though. (Maybe a little bit).
“Stop salivating.”
“I- uh I mean.. Who?”
“Get to work Goldenboy, there’s a lot of food to make, we’re gonna be like… 9 people!”
No. nope, nuhu, stop right now. Dimples. Fucking dimples.
After naming him
“That’s a fair question, but no, I’m not” he says reassuringly.
He’ll make the centaur have elvish features. The realistic style has never been his preferred style, and his teacher knows and appreciates this, luckily.
Draco shrugs and simply says “she’s a cow.”
so that Harry won’t forget.
When they’re all gathered around the sofa, Draco leans into Harry and whisper,
When Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna have all arrived, Harry is anxiously waiting for Draco. He feels a hand on his shoulder, and turns to see who it is.
“Um.. No?”
“He usually arrives with Pansy and Blaise, Blaise likes to be fashionably late, it won’t be long though, I don’t think.” Luna smiles gently at him before she leaves.
Harry smiles sweetly at him, and a bit like he doesn’t believe him. He shouldn’t either.
Harry tries not to bristle at the remark. “They’re not
Harry tries to reply but he can’t. He wants to say something, wants to yell, cry, shove Malfoy back against that wall and start kissing—or hitting—him until everything else fades away. He swallows and forces himself to step back, putting much needed distance between himself and Draco. With a crack, Harry Apparates on the spot, lucky he doesn’t splinch himself.
“That’s why you proposed isn’t it?” Ginny’s voice raises and she shoves Harry none too gently. “You proposed because you got off with Malfoy. Oh my
Harry stares out of the window. “She’s fine. Brilliant, really. Off playing Quidditch with the Harpies. It’s great. I’m lucky.”
“In private, if both are over the age of twenty-one. Witches and wizards are considered old enough to consent to sex at sixteen. They can marry one another. There are no restrictions on public displays of affection between them, and even a public misdemeanour would rarely result in an Azkaban sentence. Surely you see how ridiculously unbalanced this is?”
of disgust, but he stays where he is.
“What did you expect me to do?” The anger returns, flashing through Harry like
“At Merlin’s Kitchen?”
“I’m sorry,” he says, sincerely. “I should never have left without speaking to you first. I got it all so wrong.”
of encouragement he lets Harry know when he does something just right. He pushes Harry back when he gets close and lets Harry bring him off with his hand, without once taking his eyes off him.
“I see.” Draco bites back a jagged moan as Harry presses up against him, the friction against his hardening cock maddening. He buries his face in Harry’s neck before murmuring into his ear. “Will you teach me how to fuck you?”
“Can’t you change the law?” Millie asks. “Remind them you saved the bleedin’ world and tell them to shove their stupid homophobic legislation up their arseholes.”
I didn’t ask if he liked you.
, Draco thought when the images of people in the wizarding world flickered before his mind in the dark, quieter moments.
“I’m not sure even magical tattoos are sentient, although anything is possible when it comes to you,” Draco replies.
“Maybe.” Harry leans in, his breath warm and boozy sweet against Draco’s ear. “If you keep coming, I might even splash out on a few bottles of fizz.”
“I don’t.” Harry cuts Draco off before he can finish his sentence. “I want you to get whatever you want to say off your chest and then you can piss off and let me go back to bed.”
“Why would they make those assumptions?” Harry keeps his voice calm despite the fact he’s itching to go and hex the anonymous men that have made Draco feel like he can’t tell them exactly what he needs and wants.
Harry squeezes Draco’s shoulder and from the broad smile on his face it appears he doesn’t seem to mind.
“Hmm.” Draco mouths an insolent line over Harry’s cock, holding the base and running his tongue over the crown. Harry blinks at him, his eyes dark with arousal. “Do you like the idea of fucking me, Harry?”
It might be difficult to keep up if your eyes are closed.
It’s nothing like Harry thought it would be, the sensations indescribable. He claws at the sheets as Draco fucks him harder still and the whimpers, groans and grunts that fall from his lips seem to spur Draco on. The pure act of feeling strips away the pain of remembering, the panic, loss and sense of becoming untethered that so consumed Harry over the last forty-eight hours. He’s been trying not to focus on how out of control everything is, but in this moment there’s a catharsis in letting go completely. He doesn’t need to be in control, not of this. He can focus solely on sensation and let everything slip away, as he gives himself over to pleasure.
“Is all your art like that?”
“Would you prefer to see what I’ve done with the bedroom?” Harry’s being a dick, but it’s no less than Draco deserves.
Harry nods. “We’re saying there was no authority to arrest you because you were in a Muggle park. The conviction should be completely quashed, and you’ll be released as soon as the papers are processed.”
Not noticing anything strange, Ginny nods. “Yes, that’s the one. Harry does the pub quiz with George and Lee, don’t you Harry?”
“If that’s what you want.” Harry might not relish the idea of making small talk with Lucius and Narcissa, but if that’s what it takes, he’s willing to give it a shot. “In Paris?”
Draco is unusually lost for words and he stumbles back against the nearest bookcase as Harry moves a little closer, an unmistakable question in his gaze.
“I’m glad you came,” Harry says, honestly. “I reckon I might have been a third wheel, otherwise.”
With a huff of aggravation, Draco gets back to work and studiously ignores Harry gently stroking his Bowtruckle until it’s practically purring.
“Fine,” Harry says. “I’ll be fine.” He’s surprised to find that despite the ache in his heart, he really means it.
“And what was that?” Harry frowns at Draco, noticing the shake in his hand as he runs it roughly through his hair. It falls in a soft, rumpled curl that makes Harry’s chest tight.
Draco rolls his eyes and lets out a long-suffering sigh that makes it clear Harry is being teased without any malice. “Apparently not.”
“What if somebody saw?” Harry’s voice shakes and he takes another long drink of the booze. It burns as it slides down his throat.
Harry climaxes, sticky and wet inside Draco’s body. He slips out and the emptiness makes Draco groan, his own cock still hard, untouched and desperate for some kind of friction. He begins to wank himself off before his hand is covered by Harry’s and
“I expected something fancier from you.” Harry presses his lips against Draco’s neck, brushing them lower with a ticklish, light touch. “Gilt, posh parchment…”
could save it.
Draco laughs. “A lick of paint might be the best place to start. I’ll think of some ideas.”
“It doesn’t apply to you,” Draco replies. His voice is heavy, his expression serious and as open as Harry’s ever seen him. “The law doesn’t apply to you.”
Harry slips off his robes before sitting, thankful he had time to put on nice jeans and a jumper underneath before he left the house.
“I’ve got a new flat and everything.” Harry waves his hand towards the back of the club. “Upstairs.”
“It’s complicated.” Harry shifts in place, his denim-clad thigh so close that the heat from his body makes Draco’s skin warm. “Isn’t it?”
“Yeah.” Harry shrugs. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
Annoyed with himself, Harry pushes those thoughts firmly to one side. No matter how confusing his conflicting rush of unexpected emotion might be, he’s not going down that road again. Draco Malfoy is nothing but trouble.
sign to
“No problem.” Harry looks back at his friends. “Hermione isn’t here tonight. She’s working late.”
“You do that.” Draco’s cool tone suggests that any opportunity for further conversation is over.
Harry lets out a hollow laugh, trying to buy himself time. He forces the panic down and tries to think as quickly as he can. He’s made a living out of being able to think on his feet and respond quickly to high-pressure situations but there’s something very different about this. Something that makes him feel seen—and judged—in all the wrong ways. The look on Robards face is one of thinly veiled disgust.
” as he moves from Draco’s lips to his jaw to his throat. “Does the noise bother you? I can turn up the soundproofing charms—”
“As if.” Harry snorts and has the decency to sound faintly embarrassed. “It’s just a bit of fun. You know I hate stuff like that.”
“How typical that your mind would go straight to pornography.” Draco gathers his excess soup on another piece of bread. “I suppose you won’t believe me if I tell you I like arthouse cinema?”
“Fuck off.” Draco sips his tea and a knowing smile curls at the corner of his mouth. “You remembered exactly how I like it.”
, the voices in his head whisper.
Have you always been this bad at flirting?
“Yes.
“Don’t look so glum, Potter. You’re putting me off my booze.” Draco rolls his eyes. “You’re not the first person from the DMLE who’s been in this position, and others seem to manage. Think of that Headmaster of yours, or the Thestrals.”
“Dear Merlin.” Kingsley squeezes Harry’s arm tightly. His voice lowers to almost a whisper. “I would never, ever think any less of you. I have nothing but the utmost respect for you as a man, a friend and a trusted colleague.”
. He doesn’t envy Harry that task and wonders, not for the first time, how Harry can live, sleep and work in a place with so many memories that scream through the castle walls. It would drive Draco mad.
Draco makes a disgruntled noise in the back of his throat. Admittedly the night in Muggle London wasn’t one of his finest moments. He breached several clauses of the Official Magical Secrets Act and threw up on his brogues.
Draco pulls a face, hoping to fuck it isn’t Weasley. He realises he still hasn’t got to the bottom of why Harry’s evening has been so awful and wonders if it’s anything to do with his wand. The reminder that they’re going to spend the weekend working together is both welcome and not. Draco is already buzzing with anticipation, eager to see Harry again in the flesh. However, the sinking realisation that the sooner he breaks all contact with Griffin or tells Harry the truth, the better. His Quick-Match Quill vibrates and bounds towards the open notebook.
It occurs to him as the sounds of Merlin’s Kitchen filter into the room why Harry asked if Draco was bothered by the noise. There’s something decadent about the way laughter and the buzz of conversation filters into the otherwise quiet room. The thump of the music vibrates through the floorboards and the walls but it’s not the loud, oppressive din of the club itself.
“Not a clue.” George stares at Harry. “Are you saying you’re—”
Life might not have been perfect, but it was stable. There were niggling questions, the ever-present sense of something unresolved, but he was able to sleep, function, get up in the morning, laugh and talk with friends and colleagues. He was content with his lot. He might have complained about the paperwork, the grind of administration, and joked about the boring task of organising his files, but he spent his years since the war working tirelessly to be part of the system. He’s good at his job. He’s Head Auror for fuck’s sake.
Draco holds up the decanter. “Another drink?”
“I will.” Hot tears prick at the back of Harry’s eyes as he imagines everything falling apart. He wonders how he looks to Kingsley, hot-cheeked and on the verge of tears.
“You can’t tell anyone.” Ginny’s face is flushed, tears running down her cheeks. She clutches Harry’s arm tight enough to bruise. “I know you think it’s awful—
“If I knew the answer to that, they wouldn’t be secrets,” Harry replies.
“Does the idea of going to Knockturn make you uncomfortable?” Draco’s expression is unreadable, his gaze steady.
“Anytime now, then.” Draco settles next to Harry and stretches out. “You know you could do something other than working with Weasley, if you wanted.”
“No more Ogden’s in the day.” Hermione points her wand at the curtains, drawing them to a close. “Be careful with that.”
“Mum, Dad don’t do this!” George is frantic and he grips Molly’s shoulder. “Don’t let him leave, he’s got nowhere else to go.”
“You’re welcome.” Draco puts his wine on the side and moves towards Harry. “I caught some of the things you said outside.”
“If we were downstairs, what would you be doing, I wonder?” Draco moves closer to Harry, who has also discarded his drink. “Would you be out there dancing with your friends, or talking to me in the shadows?”
“Yes. In a minute.” Draco moves his fingers down Harry’s stomach, drinking in the heat of his skin and the damp beads of sweat. He wants to taste every inch of Harry’s body and determines to do so before the weekend finishes. He circles his fingers around Harry’s cock and gives him a slow stroke. “Do you want a hand with this?”
“Thestral tail hair.” Draco holds up a hand when Harry begins to protest. “I know Ollivander doesn’t believe in anything other than Dragon heartstrings, unicorn hair or phoenix feathers, but I learned my craft from Gregorovitch’s daughter. It’s not unheard of to use Thestral tail hair in wands in other parts of the world.”
“Even then,” Draco replies.
“You’re welcome.” Harry glares at Draco. He’s so bloody infuriating, the ungrateful arsehole.
With a snarl, Draco switches their positions pinning Harry against the wall. “You think you’ve got it all worked out don’t you, Potter? I’m not the nice girlfriend you’ve had since you were seventeen. You couldn’t possibly imagine the things wizards like to do together.”
“Perhaps not.” Draco’s eyes flash in challenge. “I also came because I was hoping you might fuck me. But you already know that.”
“I don’t believe we’ve ever really talked about Astoria’s death.” Draco’s voice is quiet but calm.
“Not even Harry Potter,” Draco says.
“Give over.” Harry laughs through his tears, wrapping his arms around Hermione and pulling her close. Merlin, he’s missed her. He misses them all. Ron and Hermione, lively conversation at The Burrow and Molly’s roast potatoes. He misses the days when everything was so much less complicated. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he says, gruffly.
“Getting off with Malfoy seems as good a reason as any to take up a vice that could possibly kill you,” Millie replies.
“It’s what we both want.” Harry swallows, his stomach rolling. “Being without Ginny, it’s made me think about some things. I’ve…realised stuff.”
“But if it could help—” Ginny sniffles.
laws.”
“Oh.” Draco sips his coffee, wincing as it burns his throat. “I didn’t know Puffskeins could write letters.”
They drink sweet cocktails and the night stretches on, the light from the candles making the shadows dance alongside them.
“Accio
Harry laughs, the mood between them easing just a little. “I think I’m going to leave the Ministry be for the moment. George said I could work with him at the shop. Just until I work out what’s next.”
“I’m ready.” Harry turns on his front and wriggles his arse to emphasise exactly how ready he is. “How do you want me?”
“I rarely discuss it.” Kingsley flicks his wand, so the door closes with a soft
“We think there’s a loophole.” Harry changes the topic, pleased to be bringing good news at last. He hands Draco the notes he and Hermione put together and watches as he reads them carefully. “The Aurors shouldn’t be policing Muggle parks, the cruising spots, the Muggle gay bars. It’s not their jurisdiction, unless there’s magic involved. That’s for the Muggle police to deal with and if you get in any trouble with them, I can’t help you.”
“If you say so.” Hermione doesn’t sound convinced and the hot flush of shame returns, pricking at Harry’s skin.
“She’s doing the work of a full team single-handedly,” Harry agrees. “I had to ask her if she was using a Time-Turner again. It’ll be good to have a break.”
Just when Draco thinks it can’t get any better, Harry’s slick fingers tease and slide below his balls and between his buttocks. The combination of Harry sucking him down and cool fingertips in the places Draco aches to be touched is desperately good. He can tell from the way Harry strokes his fingers instead of breaching Draco that he’s being uncharacteristically careful, and it makes Draco impatient and snappish.
“It’s been alright, hasn’t it?” Harry nudges Draco’s shoulder.
“Fine. What makes you ask about him?”
, his brain whispers.
“That’s the one,” Harry says.
“Sorry about that.” Harry winces. “I’m trying to get them to back off Knockturn but it’s not working.”
“No shit.” Harry laughs and moves towards Draco again, running a hand down Draco’s arm. His voice dips into a low, warm cadence. “Was that why you stopped everything when it was just getting interesting?”
She ushers Harry inside where he’s wrapped in another hug, as Arthur claps him on the back.
refers to as Harry’s
“Yes,” Draco agrees. “It is.”
“You look good. Different.” Draco goes straight to the cupboards, as if he still has the right to treat Harry’s home as his own. He’s elegant, unruffled and quite at ease, despite having turned up uninvited. He pauses, giving Harry a half smile. “I like the beard.”
Kingsley stares at Harry, his expression grim. “If there is any truth to the rumours—any truth at all—it will ruin you professionally. You can’t be so inclined and remain an Auror. It’s a criminal offence and that can’t be overlooked, not even for you. Even if the law itself is desperately unfair, it is still the law.”
is exactly what he needs. Harry grins at the thought that his obvious interest in sex might be therapeutic. It’s extremely charitable of him, really. He stretches out on the bed as Draco drinks in the sight of him. Despite the uncertainty of what happens next, Harry’s not in the slightest bit worried. He wants it. He wants all of it. He strokes his cock quickly and meets Draco’s gaze.
“Hmm.” Draco makes a non-committal sound. “That’s a generous way of putting it.”
“He did?” Harry rubs his jaw and gives Dennis a sheepish smile. He used to hate being fawned all over and treated like a celebrity, but there’s a warmth in the way Dennis is so open and welcoming, a kindness in the way he talks that makes Harry’s heart ache for little Colin Creevey, the brother Dennis lost far too soon. “He was brilliant too, your brother. Dead good at photography.”
“You like witches.” Harry’s voice sounds faint and foreign to his own ears, as if his words might be caught on a gust of wind and chased away in a heartbeat. It’s more of a statement than a question; he already knows the answer. He wants to go back to the place before this conversation—before Thursday night—so everything can be normal again.
“Don’t move the place—” Draco cut himself off with a laugh. His advice had come too late. As fragrant curried carrot soup had appeared in his own bowl, a considerably less generous amount appeared in the spot where Harry’s bowl had been and splashed onto the table. The sleeve of Harry’s dress shirt was splattered, and Harry gave a small yelp of pain, snatching away his hand.
Harry shook his head and shrugged, “Honestly, I haven’t got a clue.” They sat in silence for several long minutes, until Draco could feel leaden exhaustion begin settling over his body. His hip and elbow were throbbing from where he’d cracked them against the wood floor, and his skin felt gritty with sweat.
“Yes,” Draco said, taking a few steps forward to singe a tendril of ivy that was climbing out of its bed, tickling the feet of the wizard, “Fiachra and Quirinus Malfoy. My great-great-great-great grandparents, or something. They were responsible for the last major renovation of Malfoy Manor and its grounds, though, of course, my other ancestors have done this and that to it since then. Their grandchildren commissioned these statues of them. They work in a defensive capacity, as well. I’m rather fond of the piece.”
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you Potter?” Draco hissed, eyes locked on Harry’s, who looked back, utterly without venom, tousle-haired and unshaved, “For me to just lay down and take whatever it is you shove at me.”
Draco gave her a cool look as the teapot floated off the tea tray Mimsy was carrying and poured each of them a cup of fragrant Darjeeling. A silver tower of dainty finger sandwiches and French pastries hovered to land at the center of the small table. He lifted the china cup to his lips and took a sip. The tea, at least, was as good as it had ever been. It smelled like a flower garden after a rain and tasted like a soft spring evening. “Hardly,” He said at last, but then a bit of helplessness slipped out without his permission, “I have no idea what’s the matter with it. Nothing I do seems to help. It’s only getting worse. I’d write to Mother about it, but I don’t want to worry her. She has more than enough to cope with already.”
It’s not that they harbour any ill will towards one another anymore, but they’re hardly friends. Even if the sharpness of past acrimony has softened, Harry still has the capacity to wind Draco up like nobody else can. To make matters a hundred times worse, he’s also handsome. His atrocious dress sense has improved over the years and in casual jeans and midnight blue jumper, with his shock of dark hair, distinctive green eyes and his firmly set jaw, Harry Potter is as depressingly attractive as anyone Draco has ever met. It’s a damned inconvenience.
“It’s politics.” Draco shrugs. “The Ministry has its flaws, you know that better than anyone.”
“I’ll speak to him.” Harry’s mind flickers to the sad box of his things in the living room. “I don’t want to think about that today. I don’t want to think about any of it.”
“Well if Hermione said.” Harry tries not to sound angry, but he isn’t sure he manages it. “How’s work?”
It’s typical of Draco to skulk around outside feeling sorry for himself without plucking up the courage to knock on the door. He had plenty of opportunity to talk to Harry properly earlier, but instead he stayed for barely an hour, leaving when he’d polished off the last of his expensive wine. In keeping with the rest of the evening he didn’t have much to say for himself, walking out of the door with a snide
“Do I?” Draco does, he supposes. He’s not close to Harry—Evaporates, Quick-Match and wilting wands aside—but he knows enough to understand that Harry isn’t the showy sort. “Wood’s coming back for the match.”
“We could go somewhere else if you like.” Draco puts his hands in his pockets and looks up at the round dome of St Paul’s that towers above them. The busy square is quiet, with only a handful of stragglers left in the various bars that all seem to be shutting up shop for the evening. “Although I do have an early meeting tomorrow.”
“No wonder this thing has its own room.” Harry takes in the huge screen, shaking his head. “Nobody has a telly this size.”
“He pretended to be very inconvenienced by it all but he wasn’t a bit convincing.” Ginny winks at Harry. “It evens out the numbers. Besides, he knows a bit more about the lay of the land in London and boys’ stuff. He could be helpful.”
“We’re off.” Ginny waves at Harry and winks. “Have fun
Harry stops in his tracks when he sees Draco. His relaxed expression shifts into something intense and hungry. “You found some joggers.”
Draco nods his agreement. He’s so dizzy with the night and the sounds of Merlin’s Kitchen slowly filter back into his consciousness. The powerful vibrancy of the magic all around them ebbs away until the room feels like any other.
“No, but I know my mother. I know her well enough that I’m glad for all our sakes you told her I was still alive.”
Of all the ill-advised ways to begin a dreary Thursday, an enthusiastic wank over Harry Potter’s most recent dick pics must be the most ill-advised of them all.
“Oh come
“I imagine not,” Harry mutters. He tries not to think too closely about the implication behind Draco’s suggestion that he
“You’ve got to be careful.” Harry speaks abruptly, the words spilling from his lips. “If they catch you again it might not be so easy to get you out of Azkaban.”
There’s a recklessness to Draco’s statement that makes his heart quicken and his palms clammy. He knows that Harry—Griffin—is blissfully unaware of Jean-Paul’s real identity, but telling the truth still makes Draco feel raw and exposed.
“As I thought,” Kingsley replies. His own voice is smooth and equally dispassionate. He holds his hand out for shaking and squeezes Harry’s hand firmly. “Constant vigilance, Harry.”
“I can’t listen to this.” Molly sobs again, clutching Arthur’s hand. “Arthur, please.”
. He swallows back his sudden nausea with a gulp of beer.
“It’s hardly the same.” Harry rolls his eyes. “Parkinson hates me. She doesn’t like you much either anymore.”
Draco stares at Harry, half wondering if he misheard. Harry
The first kiss is confident. He knows what he’s doing.
“Yes.” With a promise like that, Draco isn’t sure he’ll sleep at all. He can never nap in the middle of the day, and he’s surprised that Harry, with all his restless energy, is so able to crash out. Like everything else he does, it seems to be another sign of Harry’s easy way of being, sleep coming as naturally to him as flying Hippogriffs over the Forbidden Forest or going for an early morning swim in icy waters. As Harry snores softly beside him, Draco keeps his voice low as he reaches for his wand.
Harry’s spent so long trying to pretend to everyone—including himself—that he’s straight, the sudden, sharp pleasure and the desperate craving for
“I aim to please.” Harry still sounds far too amused for Draco’s liking and he’s tempted to give him a light swat for his cheek, but he suspects that spanking is something they should probably discuss beforehand. The last thing Draco needs is another conversation.
Harry swallows. He’s shit at filing things away properly. Hermione’s always on at him about that, but it’s just boring paperwork. The main thing about the Little Sutton case is that Harry arrested several witches and wizards who had evaded the Ministry for years. Witches and wizards who were using Unforgivables and trying to build a gruesome magical monster from parts of murdered Muggle bodies. Harry doesn’t give a fuck about paperwork when people like that are in Azkaban for good.
“Liar.” Harry yanks off his glasses and leaves them on the side. He moves towards Draco, crowding into his space until he’s backed against the kitchen counter. “You didn’t just come here for conversation.”
. “I love being back at Hogwarts.”
Perhaps we already know one another. You remind me of someone I knew at school.
“Actually, this isn’t French, it’s Italian—”
“What’s in Manchester?” Harry asks, curiously. He can’t imagine Draco anywhere other than the posh parts of Kensington or shooting pheasant on a sprawling country estate, surrounded by green belt.
“Can we stop talking for a while?” Draco asks. His lips curve into a smile and he brushes his fingers across the line of Harry’s jaw.
“You’re being ridiculous,” Draco huffs. “You’re in your thirties, you’d have known by now.”
“Kinky.” Harry grins and gives Draco a quick kiss, something they’re both still getting used to in public places. A reporter from the
“Yes.” Draco swallows back the desire that pulses through him at Harry’s proximity. He really does smell divine. “I’ll see you at the same time tomorrow, try not to—”
“Did they really fire you, Harry?” Dennis’s eyes are wide. If he does bear Harry any ill-will, he’s very good at hiding it. “We heard the rumours, but we never believed it. I told everyone what you did during the war. Col always said you were the best. ‘He’s
“Yeah.” Harry swallows around the lump in his throat. He slips his hand from Ginny’s and wraps her in his arms, nuzzling her head and breathing in the warm, comforting scent of her. “I’m scared for us too.”
“Wand jokes,” Draco comments. “How very droll. I expected more from you.”
“Why the fuck would I want to help?”
“Don’t be.” Draco waves a hand. “I don’t care about marriage. It’s not a priority of mine.”
Harry shakes his head. “No, not really. I know the circumstances, I know how close you were, but not much else.”
“I can’t do this alone,” Hermione continues. “Ron’s still in America, Kingsley’s getting ready for retirement, two of my team are on maternity leave and Bradley Dorkins is the worst hire anybody has ever made. Not to mention the amount of people that dodge the issue entirely, Minister Robards included. I have more than enough on my desk. This is just one piece of legislation that impacts one group of people. There are countless others. I’ll tell you about those too, when one of our other peers gets arrested.”
“Next time I’ll just avoid the Jägermeister.” Draco pointedly ignores Pansy muttering
“Would you let me?”
“If you like.” Harry doesn’t confirm or deny the rumours, his fingers working open Draco’s belt. “Or I can owe you.”
Harry makes his way to the bathroom and lets the hot water soothe away the memory of the previous day. Pulling on clean flannel pyjama bottoms and brushing his teeth leaves him fresher and less unsure of himself. He expects Draco to be downstairs, but he’s still in Harry’s bed, reading the
Harry puts the letter inside his copy of

—is interesting, funny and has the filthiest mouth and most delectable looking cock Draco’s ever encountered. It's got to the point where he even looks forward to the obnoxious vibrations of his Quick-Match Quill. Somewhere between the first dick pic and the last, Draco’s heart has become involved.
“Everything’s fine,” Harry lies. By tacit agreement, he and Ginny decided to let people believe they’re still together, for now. The upside is, Harry doesn’t have to deal with any well-meaning bystanders, flocking like vultures over the carcass of his ruined relationship. The downside is, he has to adopt a false cheer when he talks about conversations he never had, trips he never made. The last few weekends he’s been mooching around Grimmauld Place in his boxers, keeping the outside world—Draco and Ginny included—at bay. “I’m going to visit her next weekend.”
Oh yeah? What was he like?
“Yeah, right.” Harry laughs and he moves to stretch out on the bed, propping himself up on the pillows. He gives Draco a broad smile. “Come here, will you?”
“Why on earth would you do that?” Harry shakes his head with a laugh. “Don’t be soft. Go and enjoy the rest of the weekend. I promise not to start moping again. I’m fine.”
“No.” Harry laughs, brushing his lips to Draco’s neck before moving away again. “I can think of better things to look at during sex than Percy doing the Thestral Hop.”
Lee lets out a cheer and everyone laughs. Even Flint looks amused, his gaze sweeping over Harry. He shakes his head and nods at Draco.
“I have zero interest in rooting through piles of your underpants—” Draco glares at Harry, stopping mid-sentence. “Why did you clean your room?”
“Or Albus Dumbledore,” Harry replies. “Kingsley mentioned his job was at risk because people spread rumours about him.”
Harry stares at Hermione. “You can’t send people to Azkaban for
“I’m going away with Ginny and her friends,” Harry replies. He plasters a forced smile on his face. “I thought I might get off early so I can fly. I usually arrange a Portkey, but I fancy some fresh air and exercise.”
Harry trails off, sinking to his knee. Ginny’s mouth opens and her face gets even paler than it did when she thought Harry was bringing bad news about Ron, which isn’t a great sign. Ploughing on, Harry presents the box to her, flicking it open at the lid and giving her a questioning smile. The silence that stretches between them is the only thing more painfully awkward than the concrete beneath Harry’s knee and the weird way his back is squished against the seats on the row in front. Ginny opens and closes her mouth, her cheeks flushing hot red, the colour finally coming back into her face. She looks miserable. Really, really miserable.
“No.” Ginny speaks around a mouthful of scone. “But your lot enforce them. They’re stupid. Two of the Harpies are lesbians and one’s bisexual. That means she likes wizards
Draco rolls his eyes. “Look, I don’t want your pity. There’s never been anyone serious but that doesn’t mean I haven’t had a good time.”
, all toned arms and social ineptitude.
“I’ll wait until your own team arrest you for cruising in Knockturn. Now
Draco’s glad of the light when Harry is stretched out on his bed, naked and hard. The sight of him sends a wave of desire crashing over Draco. There’s something so unexpectedly stormy about having sex with Harry. The stop and start, the push and pull, the hot, heavy force of it all. It’s like being caught in a gathering wind and travelling further into the eye of the storm. There’s so much he wants to ask, but he also doesn’t want to talk at all. Harry’s right. Talking can wait. Right now, Draco just wants to sink into the moment, to feel and taste and touch.
“I bet you have.” With a grin, Harry leans in and gives Draco another kiss, slow and filthy. “You’re getting me hard,” he murmurs, pressing closer to Draco and breathing him in as he tries to steady himself. “Can we go to the shop before the after party?”
Right there in your office?
“For not putting you in prison?” Harry finishes his toast and puts his plate and mug down, turning on his side so he can see Draco properly. “You don’t have to thank me for that. I can’t believe Robards was allowed to even suggest a false charge against you. Perhaps things haven’t changed as much as I thought.”
“I’m right about a lot of things.” Draco keeps his eyes carefully trained on their surroundings. “Can we go home? I’m sick of not kissing you too. I’d blow you in the toilets if I thought we’d get away with it, but that Auror twink definitely has his eye on you.”
“Shut up, will you.” Exasperated, Harry removes his glasses and cleans them on his jumper. The sight of him without them makes Draco’s breath catch because there’s something so intimate about it. He remembers Griffin complaining about glasses getting in the way of things and another flush of heat warms his skin as his thoughts travel to other, unwelcome places. “I’d be a right idiot if I didn’t reinforce the need to keep this confidential. Not because you’re—well,
, not in the end. I didn’t want him to win,” Draco hisses. He glances around as if he’s worried someone will overhear him, and Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. In Azkaban with Death Eater sympathisers, Malfoy’s probably playing the political game and pretending he’s been arrested for trying to resurrect Voldemort or something.
“Sometimes. My name and family history made going out here far harder than anything else, at first. The Aurors were around a lot less then. The change in the law put these places on their radar, as you know.”
Harry tries to busy himself doing something, anything, as panic wells within him. Draco gives Harry a sharp look, an indecipherable emotion flickering across his face.
The combined pleasure makes Harry cry out as he twists and bucks on the bed, his whispers and pleas falling into the darkening room around them. Everything else melts away and it’s like they’re flying again, up in the sky where nothing can touch them. Harry pushes Draco back when he gets closer to the edge.
The party is in full swing and Harry makes a cheerful toast with Lee, watching Hermione and Ron dancing to one of their favourite American bands.
“Head Auror Potter, folks. Better get yourselves lined up for inspection.”
Draco swallows, wondering why Harry cares so damn much. It’s stupid and he hates it.
Draco drops back on the bed and waits for the shower to start. The words he would never say out loud to Harry spin around his mind and he closes his eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips.
“Can’t be much worse than someone proposing because they’re panicking about being gay,” Harry points out.
“N-no.” Harry makes an
. Harry tries to digest it all carefully, his head spinning as he takes in countless new words and phrases. It’s obvious Lee is passionate about
“Thanks,” he says, gruffly.
A lull in the queue at the bar allows Draco to get another drink and he finds a seat outside. The cool breeze of the evening is a great deal more pleasant than the sweaty dancefloor and the scent of sweet, sticky drinks covering the floor inside. The added benefit to being outside is the ability to observe Harry, now back with his friends instead of cosying up to Draco in shadowy corners of the club.
“You’re so brave telling them. I hate feeling like a coward.” Ginny twists her hands together miserably. “I’m not scared of many things. Why this?”
Draco seems to get it instinctively. He slides his arms beneath Harry’s legs, hitches them over his shoulders and adds more lubricant. With another sharp thrust Draco pushes inside Harry’s body and the air punches out of his lungs with a sharp cry.
. We’ve been so worried! Ginevra’s been so busy with her Harpies she keeps ignoring our calls, we thought something dreadful had happened to you. Ronald won’t tell us a thing, classified this and classified that and nobody can reach Hermione. Arthur was starting to suspect you might have been harmed in some way. Let me look at you.” Molly casts a critical eye over Harry, clearly looking for signs of horrible curses. “Far too skinny as always, but we can soon fix that.”
“I said I don’t want to hear about your sex life.” Harry shoves the papers towards Draco, sitting back in his seat and hoping he looks less flustered than he is. “You’ve got about ten million rooms in the Manor, Malfoy. Was it too simple to just fuck someone in one of those? Not risqué enough, I bet.”
“Excuse me?” Draco blinks at Harry, now on his feet and stretching in a way that shows off every inch of his body. “Sickle for what?”
with his glasses on. Two piping mugs of tea sit on either side of the bed and the delicious scent of freshly buttered toast makes Harry’s stomach rumble. He gets back under the duvet, which tingles with Draco’s magic. The comforting scent of cotton fresh from Cleaning Charms fills the room and Harry settles into bed with a contented sigh. Draco folds that morning’s
“Will you still be here after?” Harry realises he wants Draco to stay. He wants him more than anything.
“You’re staying over?” The house is warmer than ever, the heavy weight in Harry’s heart easing. “Malfoy, too?”
“But you are interested,” Draco replies. “The Ministry takes a personal interest in all kinds of private matters. Don’t you think it’s ironic that of all the opinions I’ve espoused, the Ministry finally manages to throw me in prison for having another man’s prick in my mouth?”
“Me too.” Harry’s reluctant for the night to end but he needs to brief the Aurors on a new case in the morning. It’s important he’s alert, not drowning himself in coffee. “I’m not close enough to walk. We’ll need to find somewhere quiet so we can Apparate.”
“Please don’t do this to him. It’s Harry. He’s got no other family but us, don’t be such bloody
“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t compare my wands to mouldy socks.” Draco huffs with annoyance, watching Harry cast his listless spells. “Alder can be stubborn. If you don’t want it, there’s a chance it won’t take to you much either.”
“It wasn’t brilliant.”
“Yes.” Harry gives Hermione a sheepish smile. “I’m sorry. Carry on.”
Draco unbuckles his belt and unbuttons his trousers, picking up the quill once more.
“I don’t know,” Draco replies. Harry has the sense he wants to say something else, but instead he gives the lapel of Harry’s jacket a light tug. “Wear this more often. I like it.”
“Don’t be offended.” Harry laughs quietly. “She does that when I’m on my own, too. Perhaps it’s a privacy thing.”
“Potter.” Draco’s voice is gruff, his hands dropping from Harry’s jacket. “Don’t do anything stupid.”
“I know.” Harry swallows thickly. “I understand. I wouldn’t want anybody to make any exceptions for me, you know that, Kingsley. I never have. I expect to be treated like anyone else.”
The memory of the moment comes flooding back to Draco and he groans at his own stupidity. He can remember licking his lips, deciding
“I was sorry to hear about that,” Harry says, quietly. “Ginny’s close to Daphne and I know she’s had a rough time. Hermione worked with Astoria and always spoke very highly of her.”
, Potter.” Draco turns and gives him a brittle smile. “You can hardly cope with the consequences of a simple kiss, let alone anything else. You’re not made for the saunas, the shadows. You’ll go on living the same nice, safe celibate life and enforce laws you disagree with, waiting patiently for Granger to change things.”
Harry doesn’t even have the energy to identify the voice. He just rips off his apron and grabs his bag out in the storage room. When he passes his co-workers, he throws them a lazy smile and a wave before he walks out the door.
cheese in it.
“Jesus fucking christ”, Draco sighs under his breath.
Draco tries to suppress a smile and looks down at his sketchbook, he’s currently trying to draw a centaur, but he can’t figure out what special touch to add, and he’s getting frustrated. Instead, he looks up at the brown walls, covered in pictures and paintings, some of them his own. With Luna owning the café, she pressures him into making them for her. No, she doesn’t, he makes them willingly, because he likes making her happy. Ew.
now the past impatience caused by the horrible weight of keeping secrets has eased. Although it seems like the issues with Lucius and Narcissa are mostly resolved, the fact Draco was so terrified of them finding out in the first place appears to be a direct result of his upbringing. It’s the kind of thing that would make anyone’s head messy, and Harry hadn’t realised the full extent of that until last night.
“If it’s not too nice for you, you could always kiss me, you prick.” Harry barely recognises his own voice, the words falling from his lips in a shudder of pleasure.
, because all coherent thought is chased from his brain when their lips meet.
“What are you up to, Harry?” He murmurs.
, and you let me do it anyway.”
Wank, probably. Don’t worry, I’ll lie back, close my eyes and pretend you’re talking about me.
is a terrifying affirmation that brings everything crashing into place. The realisation that he’s unequivocally interested in wizards comes as no real surprise at this point, but the ease with which he fell into the physical side of his explorations leaves Harry’s heart hammering in his chest. It felt so good, part of him wants to do it all over again and the rest of him wants to run away and never come back.
“Yeah, maybe.” Harry sighs and pushes a hand through his hair, watching his friends dancing together as the silence stretches between them. “They’re okay with it.”
“You’re so enlightened all of a sudden.” Draco’s tone is teasing and the glum mood in the room lightens. “It probably helps your girlfriend turned out to be a lesbian.”
Draco takes the pause in conversation to read Harry’s form carefully. He tries to keep his expression smooth when he discovers the precise details of the attack on Harry and the spell aimed directly at his wand. It comes as little surprise to him that the damage sustained to Harry’s wand occurred when he was an Auror. Making a wand wilt isn’t the kind of magic a student flinging ill-judged spells around could accidentally pull off. It would take advanced, deliberate magic. Unfortunately, it doesn’t bode well for any chance of successful repair if the spell has infiltrated the core.
“Blimey. I should have sex with you more often.”
“No!” Arthur stands abruptly, his lips tight. “This is preposterous. Molly, a word.”
Harry goes to the bathroom and cleans his teeth, splashing water on his heated face. When he gets back into the bedroom, Draco is under the duvet, blinking at the ceiling. Harry gets into bed, the quiet in the room both awkward and not. It seems weird cuddling up to Draco the way he would with Ginny, so he props himself up on his elbow and looks down at Draco, whose eyes are closed.
Draco shrugs. “Much like the art I purchased to piss off my father, it’s grown on me.”
“Good lord.” Draco stifles a yawn. “Thank fuck I’m still single and attractive, or at least I will be once the stench of Azkaban has been scrubbed from my skin.”
Looking around the outside space, Draco is curious about more than Harry’s unexpected proposition. He can’t imagine anyone living above this dark, noisy back alley with people puking at three in the morning and the crash of empty bottles being dumped into the bins before the sun comes up. Merlin’s Kitchen is just a gobstone’s throw away from Knockturn, which still retains its eerie qualities, despite the creep of new shops and eateries into the once off-limits space.
Harry can tell from the pink spots blooming in Draco’s cheeks and the way his hand tightens on his brandy glass that for some godforsaken reason Harry’s opinion matters to him. The question forces Harry to consider why things always get so weird around Draco. His discomfort has nothing to do with disgust. Curiosity, perhaps. The niggling desire to find out more, the fear that Draco can see through some of the lies Harry tells himself.
“I believe so.” Draco brushes his fingers through Harry’s hair, his voice hesitant. “Do you blame me for the letter? I assumed you would set fire to the thing. Perhaps I should have been clear about that, left a postscript.”
Harry is effectively cut off by Draco pushing two slick fingers inside him. The sensation is strange at first, but his body adjusts as Draco moves his fingers slowly in and out. His fingers press against a spot inside Harry that nearly makes him fall back onto the bed as he tries to hold himself up. It’s not that Harry isn’t capable of keeping in position, it’s just that everything Draco does makes his body ache with need. It becomes difficult to think clearly; his body perspires and pure, hot pleasure overwhelms him.
“I’ve been thinking a lot about your peculiar ways.” Draco moves closer to Harry, giving him a look that chases Harry’s breath from his lungs.
“You can’t and you
“Circe, Potter.” Draco’s cheeks turn even redder.
. It occurs to Harry that perhaps he can still make a difference after all, with or without the Ministry, by living his life and refusing to hide away.
“No pressure, then.” Harry grins. He reaches into Draco’s bedside drawer, knowing by now exactly where he keeps his lube. “How do you want it?”
“I can’t wait.” The enthusiasm in Ginny’s voice is clear, her excitement evident from her beaming smile. “I love Wales so much, Harry! You don’t get fresh air or flying space like this in London.”
“This one was obvious enough even for me, thanks.” Harry shifts behind Draco, the slap of his palm and bounce of the bed indicating he’s giving his cock a couple of quick strokes.
“Is that a euphemism?” Harry takes his wand from his holster and casts a line of snowflakes. They burst from the tip of the wand, then fall around them, leaving icy kisses against Draco’s face. “Working better than ever, thanks to you.”
“No, but somehow you always manage to bring out the best in me,” Draco replies, his voice layered with sarcasm.
“I’m not telling you how to do anything,” Kingsley says, quietly. “But I
“I love you too. We all do.” Hermione tucks the duvet around Harry and the sound of her pottering around the room soothes him. As he drifts to sleep he’s sure he can feel her fingers in his hair, her voice quiet and warm. “It’s going to be okay, Harry. I’ll make sure of it.”
“Not that differently anymore,” Harry replies. “Do you think I’m right about the timing?”
“Another time.” Draco can’t imagine Harry leaving all his popular friends to go off by himself to see the world. Draco hates travelling alone. It’s one of the reasons he persisted with London, edging his way slowly back into a society that at least tolerates him now. “You travelled alone?”
“Lift up. Hands and knees.” Draco slides his hand down Harry’s back when he’s in position and squeezes his backside, pressing a light kiss to the base of his spine. “Okay?”
“Okay. Have fun in the Brecon Beacons,” Harry adds. The light in the room dims and he finds himself speaking to a cold, empty fire.
“Did you and Astoria ever have a relationship?” Harry glances at a picture of Astoria on Draco’s desk. She’s laughing and holding her hand out as if she’s trying to grab the camera back from the person taking the photograph. It reminds him of a moment with Ginny, right at the start of their relationship, when Harry tried to take a photograph of her flying and nearly fell off his broom in the process. They laughed until their feet touched the ground and then kissed as the sun set, turning the clouds red, orange and purple. The memory of it makes his heart clench, a flicker of guilt making him question if his visit to Draco is as innocent as he wants to pretend.
“Don’t go out of your way.”
“What?”
true. Besides, I can think of a few ways we can burn off those calories, can’t you?” Potter said, voice low and dripping with filthy intent.
? “Why do
But then there was the
To Draco’s horror, there was even a blurry photograph of Potter with Draco himself – the two of them shouting in each other’s faces after a Quidditch match, while their respective teammates tried to drag them apart. The caption read: ‘Harry and his schoolboy ‘rival’, Death Eater Draco Malfoy. Sources tell us their relationship was always heated, but was there more to it than met the eye?’
Potter let go of his wrist but didn’t step away. His eyes seemed to bore into Draco, and it made him nervous.

“Before that. Didn’t he talk to you about it?”
“Look, it’s been a while, okay?” said Harry, mock-grumpily, reaching down to run his own hand over the front of Draco’s underwear, lazily tracing the outline of his cock.
Yes, this was the right one. This was definitely where he should start. Draco sat down, dipped his quill in the ink pot, and began scribbling. The words flowed like they never had before.
at the door, as well as a little charm which transformed the
Unfortunately, with it being a Sunday, and work being what it was these days, Draco had a whole batch of potions on the go downstairs which needed bottling and packing up, ready for the next morning’s post. He grudgingly explained this to Harry, expecting him to start gathering his clothes – perhaps, Draco thought, they might get in a quick goodbye shag, if he was lucky. What he
Back on the noisy platform, where every year as you wave and smile, you steal a sideways glance at Harry. Every year, you’re startled to find flecks of grey in that familiar black hair and deep lines scoring his once-smooth skin. Every year you watch the Weasley bitch fuss around the children, jealousy curled up in your throat, forcing spiteful words onto the tip of your tongue.
He’s clearly come up with some awfully Gryffindor reason why you’re better off apart. You’ll just have to figure it out and convince him otherwise. Trust me, darling, it’ll all work out soon enough.”
Twice so far, he’d gone over to his bathroom cabinet, opened it up, and stared at the little golden vials within. But
, and a familiar metallic whiff invaded Draco’s nostrils. An endless corridor stretched off to the left, with enormous doors all along it – the harsh white light of anti-magic barriers seeped from the cracks around them. Draco had a swooping feeling of revulsion as he realised where they were, stopping dead in place. Lee wobbled on her heels as he tugged her back.
“What? Much quicker that way.”
distorting their thoughts? Should he run? Should he break down, or beg?
There was no anger behind it – in fact, Harry seemed almost reluctantly amused. Draco turned, impatient to get a proper look at him. Greedy, he let his gaze wander over the face he’d seen only in the paper and in his dreams for half a year now – those familiar eyes squinting into the wind, stubble catching on the fibres of his scarf, jet-black hair curling gently out from under the garish cap.

The downturn in fortune at
Draco shook his head in disbelief. “That’s crazy.”
Draco stared at Neville, who was looking at him with raised eyebrows. He had clearly thought his plan through. Hearing someone profess so much faith in Draco’s abilities was making him a bit uncomfortable, but, at the same time, he felt strangely fond of the other man. “That’s very kind, Neville, but―”
As they assumed their starting positions, Kingsley waved his wand and four enormous black numbers,
The rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a low humming noise which echoed around them, a loud, uncomfortable buzzing in Draco’s ears. Harry pushed himself upright, hurrying over towards Draco, as the furry yellow fruit began to vibrate violently over his head. They watched for a few tense seconds until the tree shivered a sigh and settled back to rest.
Draco didn’t answer, didn’t move, didn’t blink.
Draco was surprised at just how much he enjoyed himself.
Potter wrinkled his nose. “Skele-Gro? Merlin, no wonder you’re drunk.”
Though in hindsight, Draco realised, he probably should have considered that having an eagle-eyed teenager around him every day while he tried to hide the fact that he was illegally brewing and consuming large quantities of
“So? What’s your plan? Going to cart him off to Janus Thickey?”
“Uh-huh. And he comes over regularly, or?”
The agent follows him, apparently undeterred by his quick exit, keeping up his patter about chains and mortgages all the way down the stairs. Harry stops just before the bottom – feeling wretched, his skin crawling – while he waits for the man to catch up. It’s probably rude to rush straight out into the street, after all.
They both watched, silently, as Hannah dashed back over the lawn, wobbling on tiptoes to avoid her heels getting stuck.
Lost for words, Harry could only gape at Malfoy, who suddenly seemed extremely interested in the goings on below. He couldn’t possibly
Something had gone wrong. Very, very wrong. He definitely needed help. He needed to call Lee upstairs. But if she saw him like this – shit. He couldn’t even imagine what he looked like. And how would he explain things, if he couldn’t talk? She’d take him to St Mungo’s, and then everyone would
, and he shuddered a little as he tried not to choke. After a long minute, she let him go, and they stared at each other. Pansy was wearing a Muggle pinstripe trousersuit with heels, and she’d grown her hair long, pinning it up at the back in a sleek bun. But otherwise, the last time he’d seen her might have been yesterday.
There were people around him, Draco could tell. The soft rustling of the bedsheets, the shadows falling over his face, the gentle but impersonal touches to his arms, his head, his chest. Their voices were familiar, too, reassuring, even though he couldn’t quite picture the faces they belonged to. His mouth was sticky-dry, devoid of even the slightest drop of moisture, and his head was still pounding. Where

about the size of it, Draco supposed.
“Just remember,” he began, “this is for charity. It’s not an Arrows vs Wasps end-of-season bunfight, and you’re not back at Hogwarts.” He paused, staring pointedly at Malfoy. “You’re all here representing the Ministry, and I will not tolerate any repeats of the gnome-tossing debacle of ’07, are we clear?”

can think of better places than the Leaky! What about that Italian place down the end of our road? They certainly seem popular, and I’m pretty sure most of their regulars manage to wash, so there’s that.” Draco folded his arms around himself.
“Malfoy, you should really consider speaking to Hermione. She’d love to come and talk to Lee. She’d think it’s great what you’re doing, hiring her.”
“Oh. Okay.”
“Of course I did,” Pansy snapped. “When I got to the Manor, well… I could tell straight away he was there. It gave me shivers, honestly: this awful, screechy laugh, echoing all through the house. When I finally found him, he was lying at the bottom of the stairs. God, he was in such a state. Black eye, legs all twisted up, bloody handprints all over the place. He kept trying to pull himself up and falling straight back down, cackling like a madman. Merlin knows how long he’d been at it. So yes, three weeks,

or the unexpected encounter with Potter. While he waited to sober up, he took a long, leisurely shower, not at all surprised when his mind wandered immediately to sparkling green eyes, firm biceps and a teasing voice asking him if he saw
The source of the noise was clearly visible now, having rounded the bend of the narrow country lane at some speed: a bright blue car – a Honda, Harry dredged up from somewhere – engine tuned to make it sound like a bloody Horntail, neon blue lighting up the road underneath, heavy bass blasting from all four windows. It was the same kind of car that had been parked behind the enormous-breasted woman on the poster that Dudley had blu-tacked up on his bedroom wall one day (
reason; something which Harry never let himself think about these days: from the very start, they’d kept their relationship – and then, by extension, the existence of their flat – private.

she’d looked at him witheringly, as though she’d caught him playing truant, so now he was running late. To make matters worse, he hadn’t had time to eat, and all the Cannons had on offer was Muggle-style food: burgers and hot dogs and chicken wings and other sticky and greasy things which Draco knew you were supposed to eat
Draco flicked his wand, circling it slowly around the outline of the bath. The tub began to quiver ominously, and Draco heard Harry’s intake of breath behind him. But he stayed focussed, watching, as his old bath creaked and moaned. Out of nowhere, a rough tearing sound echoed off the tiles as the entire tub pulled away from the wall, sides rippling for a moment more before it settled.
“Yes, well,” Draco mumbled, slightly irritated, “that was
Caught off-guard, his social graces very rusty, Draco couldn’t help letting his eyes linger over Potter’s body for just a second too long, until, caught by a gust of wind, the shop door slammed shut. Embarrassed, he looked up at Potter’s face, bracing himself for the other man’s displeasure. To his amazement, Potter smiled sheepishly, and tugged at the buttons on his top. “Sorry about the uniform, I’ve come from work. Neville said he was popping by to see and – er, sorry.” He stopped himself. “I should have―” He stepped forward and extended his hand. “Malfoy.”
“I could ask Hermione,” Weasley said, still not looking away from Draco, “If anyone’s heard about something like this, I bet it would be her.”
“Isn’t it a little early in the morning to fight me? We can just settle back down and relax for a bit.”
standing there while someone else used his wand.
“By being unhappy?”
Instead he only nodded, looked around the Manor’s dingy great room, then back at him and said, “I’m sorry, Draco.” Draco was stunned.
“Merlin’s bollocks! Ouch, that’s hot.”
“She’s credited you with my improved appetite,” Draco said as they started the climb up towards the bedrooms, rising into the close, cold dark, but the combination of Harry’s dragonhide trousers and the after-dinner drink were doing wonderful things to the direction of his attention. It was a shame the lamps didn’t cut through the dim as well as they used to, if only because it would have afforded him a better look. Even so, Draco could appreciate a work of art even in poor lighting. “What sort of physical training did they have you do?” He asked. Harry looked back over his shoulder and actually chuckled before shrugging.
, Draco’. He came too, then, vision going white, legs trembling, as he propped himself up against Harry’s back, moving gently through the aftershocks before pushing away and flopping heavily onto his back beside him, still breathing hard. Harry, face half-hidden by a pillow, was watching him. “Do you like cuddling afterwards, at all?” Harry said, and Draco took a beat, then nodded. It would be foolish to deny himself that much at this point. Giving Draco just enough time to shoot off a couple cleaning charms, Harry rolled onto his back and reached out to draw Draco in. Draco found a place to rest his head in the hollow of Harry’s shoulder, and he closed his eyes, body limp and relaxed from the exertion. Harry’s fingers traced patters on the small of his back, and Draco listened to the beating of his heart, and felt the rise and fall of Harry’s chest, and tried his best to neither question his luck nor invite too much rumination over the possible implications of their half an hour shag.
“Don’t tell me you turned them down,” Draco said in faux surprise.
“You alright? It’s not bleeding or anything, is it?”
“Of course,” Draco said, lingering for just a moment longer in bed to appreciate the beauty of Harry’s back and arse, and the strong, lean lines of his legs, “I’ll have Mimsy do your wash while you’re washing up. Then we can have breakfast.” And after that, with some luck, one of Potter’s friends might have found something useful over the course of the evening. This particular morning, despite the misery of the previous night, Draco dared to extend hope.
“Why would she want to carry tureens of soup around when she can just apport the soup over?” Draco pointed out, gazing down at the design in crème fraiche decorating his soup. It smelled lovely, and for the first time in a long time, he rather wanted to eat. Under Harry’s gaze, he took a spoonful. It was rich, hot and perfectly spiced. He sighed with something close to satisfaction as it settled warmly into his stomach. “Sorry to eat in front of you, Potter,” He said, looking up from his bowl, “But I have to take my meals when I can stand them. And I believe Mimsy is serving four courses. If she under-serves you, we can swap plates. I doubt I’ll be in the mood for too much.” Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco felt the intensity of those green eyes sharpen on him. Draco was very glad he had showered and dressed, but half an hour of work could not undo months of neglect. He knew he was paler than ever, that his eyes no longer looked quite right in his head—dull, shadowed, tired. He had lost weight that he couldn’t really afford to, and had been getting no exercise. He looked frail and sickly in ways that a fresh shave and clean hair could not disguise. Even Harry, unobservant as he was, must have noticed by now. He watched Harry press his lips together then relax them, rather enchanted by the way the color flushed in them.
“Holding your own wand implies you think you might have to use it,” Draco explained, “Warring clans or families. All that rot, before we handled disputes in court for the most part. Holding your partner’s wand is—well, it’s not chivalrous, exactly, but… Give me your wand.” Harry handed it over without hesitation, clearly nonplussed, apparently unconcerned. That was not at all the reaction Draco had been expecting. Draco gave it a quick flick in the air, feeling the magic of the wand—eager and unfamiliar, brash—in his hand, and looking back at Potter. When there was no change in his expression, Draco went so far as to send a burst of blue sparks gushing from it. But Harry was still just standing there, looking confused.
They made their way back down to the ground floor and into the Manor’s great hall. A tortoiseshell box of Floo Powder sat on the mantle, ready for just such an occasion, and Draco gestured at it. “Help yourself,” He said blandly, and Weasley gave him a look like he’d just called him a pejorative name. He probably didn’t enjoy being given permission to do something by Draco—probably wanted to prove he didn’t need it. Still, Weasley did step forward, pop open the lid of the box, and grab a fistful of powder.
Draco closed his eyes, torn between frustration and emotional exhaustion. Why would Potter ask for the truth? No one
“That’s a relief,” Harry said with a grin that made Draco’s chest ache to look at, “I thought maybe you still didn’t like me.” Draco couldn’t say anything to that. He let his eyes fall down towards the decaying leaf litter, soft beneath their feet, and continued down the sloping path that led into the edge of the forest that populated the valley.
“Why not? What’s wrong with it?”
“I’m a bit of a Boggart expert, I guess,” Harry said with a smile Draco didn’t find convincing, “Are you doing alright?” Out of nowhere, as though that was just the sort of question you could ask someone.
Empty.
“I wasn’t trying to insult you. I’m just saying, it seems like it upsets you so much, when it’s only being human,” Harry said, unabashed. Draco’s ears were smarting from the heat of his own blush. That much was true, maybe. Whatever standards for avoiding embarrassment others set up for themselves were worlds away from what Draco’s were.
“It was just an idea. Okay. Your mum loves you a whole lot. And you love her, right?” Draco had no idea where this was going.
"I dunno," Potter answered, "It feels like there's maybe something here."
“Right,” Harry said, sounding no more convinced than last time, “Right… It can’t be that bad, can it? Let’s just give it a go.”
The air had a hearty wetness to it—dirt and verdant life—and Draco breathed it in. The stagnant air of the house still felt stuck in his lungs. He cleared his throat, brushing out the cobwebs. Harry kept kicking at the leaves as they walked. His boots were looking dirtier by the second. No wonder Potter was almost always a mess: even if he started out in something fresh-pressed, clean and perfectly tailored, he couldn’t leave it be. Anything in proximity to Potter, he mussed. Draco shot a hard look at Harry’s boots and suppressed the urge to shoot a cleaning charm at them. Eventually they came to a pond tucked into a cleft of the valley, with a rocky shore and a slow brook feeding it. Algae grew green on the pebbles at the bottom of the pond, and the still places furthest from the brook’s mouth were choked with waterlilies. It certainly needed some looking-after. But the Silver-Leaf Willows at its bank still draped their trailing branches into the water, and great, pearly fish swam languorously in the depths. Potter looked… impressed. Which said more about him than the state of the water gardens, Draco was sure.
“Auror Potter is looking after Master Malfoy, as he promised. Good. Good night, Master Malfoy.” With another pop, she was gone. Draco’s hands fell to his knees as she left, unsure if he’d been handed a boon or a curse. It was true that he didn’t want to be alone tonight, and that sharing a bed with Harry would be the realization of a secret fantasy, but certainly, Draco had never wanted it to go like this. Harry, peering at him blearily without his glasses, just pulled the covers down, and patted the mattress beside him, and Draco crawled up the bed to join him under the blankets.
“I swear I’ll dismiss you from the—” He spoke louder, trying to drown out Harry, but Harry raised his voice, too.
“For whatever’s going on with your house. It’s got to be frustrating for you, is all.” That was not at all the reaction Draco was expecting.
They finished the set off-beat, and with the song starting to end, but Draco didn’t want to cut Potter a break just yet. He was having more fun than he’d expected to have, watching Harry butcher a dance. Draco let go of him, and Harry’s look of mild surprise broke into understanding as he let his hand drop from Draco’s back, “Oh right. The turn thing.”
“Left,” Draco said, slipping past Harry to walk down the hall, which stretched on past the edge of sight into the dark. The candles flickered fitfully in their sconces, as though they were being worried at by a breeze. But the air was still, heavy, and cold. In the timid, wavering light, the shadows moved in strange ways, and formed shapes that looked solid enough to give him a start. Draco looked back over his shoulder at Harry, who widened his eyes a little and smiled. Nothing. There was nothing. Draco came to the guest bedroom closest to his own room and opened the door for Harry. It was only slightly smaller than Draco’s own room, albeit with a less recently renovated ensuite. Mimsy had set a cheerful fire in the grate, and the room was much warmer than the hall. The bed was made up in jewel blue, the bedside harp was playing a drowsy melody, and Harry’s freshly pressed Auror jacket was hanging on the coat rack. The curtains were a bit charred at the edges, the ceiling and walls oddly yellowed, and the painting over the fireplace which usually depicted a still-life of fresh flowers and fruit had begun rotting, but it was as nice as could be expected—which was to say, woefully inadequate. Draco tightened his jaw, trying to hold onto the lovely warmth that had blossomed over dinner. But the harder he tried to hold onto it, the quicker it seemed to slip away. “Sorry it’s not nicer. But you will be more comfortable here than in the great room, at least,” Draco said. Harry flopped down at the foot of the bed and tugged off his boots.
“No,” He said dismally, “And if this is all my fault somehow, for being miserable, then why didn’t happen sooner? I’ve been miserable in the Manor since You-Know-Who started popping by for Sunday roasts.”
“Only for that—being pretty,” Draco said, “But that’s more than what can be said of a lot of things.”
“Look, Ron, Malfoy hasn’t mastered the Patronus charm yet, and I think this whole thing has something to do with him. Not that he’s causing it,” He clarified as Ron’s eyes widened, “But I think whatever it is is sort of… targeting him. It responds to his emotions. It picks up on his fears. I’m going to stay here to investigate and see if I can find out anymore. It’s the best way to investigate this case.”
Draco gave an inelegant snort, “Potter, the Manor hasn’t lost its guest rooms: you don’t have to kip on a sofa. You can take the room next to mine. It hasn’t been used in quite a while, but I’m sure you’ll find it agreeable enough.” That way, too, if something did try to kill him in the night, at least Harry wouldn’t be able to sleep through it peacefully.
"Well... Do you know the Patronus charm?" Harry said slowly, "That seemed to drive it off right away."
“Whoops. Sorry,” He said, and shifted his hand to the top of Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh… I’ll eat that in a moment,” He said, waving a hand. Harry set in gleefully on his own fool, and Draco watched with perverse delight as Harry licked custard off his spoon; grey eyes soft, face relaxed, “Tell me—how is the whole Auror thing treating you?”
. Draco was considering how ‘not bad’ things were going when Harry put his free hand boldly on his hip. His gaze jolted up to Harry’s, as though expecting that Potter was making an odd joke, but of course he wasn’t. Harry was looking at him with all the innocence in the world. “Wrong spot, Potter,” Draco said, and Harry frowned.
“And then we just…”
"I dunno, Harry," Weasley said, sounding dubious, "That's the sort of thing you'd hear about, isn't it? I hope it's not something new." Draco opened his eyes as Weasley and Potter, both looking a little greyer than they had a few moments ago, walked out of the sitting room. Weasley looked stunned: Potter, perplexed.
“No, it’s not that. It’s just… was Ron right?” He asked. Draco stared back blankly.

“You’re sorry?” He echoed, “Why? For what?”
“Brilliant,” Harry said, with every appearance of real cheer, “You’ll have to show me. I could get lost in this place.”
of Draco. That Draco wasn’t a threat. That sentiment was a world’s difference from trusting him. But Potter was saying it with a tone he might have used to announce the time. Leave it to Potter to be positively vexing in any situation—which wasn’t to say that he didn’t trust Harry. Potter was always true to form. Draco didn’t have to extend any faith to trust Potter—Potter was simply trustworthy. The same couldn’t be said of himself. He floundered in silence for a moment, feeling his heart coiling around his stomach, before sniffing and looking away.
“Oh, never mind,” Draco said, waving a hand, “I’ll just have them replaced.” Only, he never did. He never seemed to find the will or energy to take himself to Diagon Alley. These days, he rarely had the desire to leave his bedroom. Maybe it showed in his writing, because his mother’s letters had taken on tones of increasing concern.
Mimsy’s thinly veiled displeasure that Harry would be staying the night was balanced by her delight that Draco was asking for dinner. 	“It doesn’t have to be anything special,” he said, though her eyes were gleaming with discomforting brightness, “Soup and salad, or something. Don’t trouble yourself.”
He raised his wand.
“Fuck,” He muttered, pushing himself backwards to put some empty space between their bodies, feeling blood rise to his cheeks. Was it too much to hope that Harry hadn’t noticed? Harry’s chuckle told him that yes, in fact, it was. “Merlin and Morgana,” Draco said, and squeezed his eyes shut.
“Sorry?”
So Draco started playing. Once the piece, long as it was, had been second nature to him; he could have played it blindfolded, or while keeping up a conversation. Now, even playing it more slowly, enunciating the rhythm so that it would be easy to dance to, it took concentration. Still, the piano itself remained lovely as ever. The notes flowed rich and clear from its body and filled the room up with the light, sweet song. Once he’d begun, it came more easily, too. His fingers remembered most of the old movements, and within a minute, the piano was almost playing itself. And then a minute later it was playing itself, obeying his modifications to the written piece, and Draco removed his hands from the keys “There we are,” Draco said, smiling at the look of surprise on Harry’s face as he stood from the bench, “The piece is a long one, and there are three more of Léandrés’s works for it to continue on with if it finishes. That should be enough to give you a basic grounding, I hope. If we were being old-fashioned, we’d be using each other’s wands. If we were being utterly medieval, we’d be using our own wands—”
Harry and Draco enjoy dinner together.
“Cold and empty, like they do everyone else,” Draco said with as bland a tone as he could muster.
“I’m not afraid of Malfoy. I think he’s sorry. I think he learned better. We already talked about this ages ago.”
“Was it an unhappy marriage or something?” Potter asked, and Draco stared at him, perplexed.
“Do you like being sad and bitter, is that what it is?” Harry asked, holding Draco’s gaze like a bear trap with his own.
“I’m certain my father’s abuse didn’t help,” Draco said dully, remembering with no small amount of shame how happy he had been any time his father’s anger found Dobby as its target, instead of himself, “Honestly, I have no idea. They have feelings, of course. They can love, and they are quite clever; powerful enough to rival a witch or wizard in a duel. And they can be horribly taken advantage of. But I think what your friend Granger never grasped is that, while they are beings, house elves aren’t human. Not to say that they deserve abuse, or to excuse the way my father treated Dobby, but their motivations are their own. It doesn’t seem a good life to me, but Mimsy turned mutinous when I suggested she might not want to serve me. I offered her the Lestrange Estate as her home, and a monthly pension. She dissappareted and refused to speak to me the rest of the day. The next morning, she served me dead cockroaches in my porridge.”
At a quarter to five, just as Harry had predicted, a burst of flame bloomed in the great hall’s fireplace, and Weasley stepped out of it, no longer wearing his jacket, and looking distinctly worn out. His eyes slid over Draco, landed squarely on Harry, and stuck. “Been with Hermione in the stacks all day, Harry,” he said, dragging a hand down his stubbled cheek, “Not that I envied you, or anything, but it’s been bloody boring. Hermione’s enjoying herself, though. She thinks this is a really interesting case. Never heard of anything like it. We’ve just been poring over books and Hermione’s been making an index of sources we’ve checked.”
“What? No good?” Harry said, and he did it again, swinging his leg around in a mad attempt at grace, turning his palms out to ask for approval. Draco couldn’t help himself. Potter, for all his skill on a broom and dexterity in dueling, might as well have been a hippogriff trying to dance
Feeling warm and full, with the Armagnac tickling his fingertips and toes, Draco thanked Mimsy for the meal. Her attitude towards Harry was slightly but noticeably warmer after dinner. She went so far as to cast a sidelong look at him that communicated something other than scorn before beaming at Draco. “I is very glad you is eating well. You is eating better than you has all year. Mimsy has tidied the bedroom by Master Malfoy’s for Auror Potter,” She told him, “And if you is wanting anything else, you can be calling. Chamomile tea, or a bath, or a calming draught, or anything.”
‘I appreciate the offer, Mother,’ Draco had written back, ‘However, someone should remain in Wiltshire to keep an eye on the estate.’ The Manor did not seem to be benefitting much from his stewardship, however. A week or two after the affair with the curtains, a horrible miasma crept into the house. The air felt thick and fetid, smelling of dank earth and mold. It stole the gleam out of the polished wood floors and settled over the windows in a haze, refusing to let more than a few watery beams of sunlight past the glass. The furniture all became impossible to get truly comfortable on.
“Okay… Well, do you have a good imagination? Could you tell yourself you’re going to banish the thing in your house, and it’s going to feel fantastic? You’ll have your home back. You’ll feel safe and powerful. It’ll be brilliant.” Harry was talking like a particularly enthusiastic quidditch captain—one who believed in the power of positive thinking.
“Thank you, Mimsy,” Draco said, not failing to notice the tiny turn towards Harry that Mimsy had performed during the last sentence, “I’ll call you if I need you. And thank you again for an excellent dinner.” With a curtsey and a pop, Mimsy dissapparated--presumably back to her bedroom.
They walked a few dozen feet to the open space, and Draco turned to look at Harry, arching one pale eyebrow. He had no intention of showing Potter that he was curious about how he’d conducted his defense against the dark arts lessons. “Okay. We don’t have to bother with wands for a minute,” Potter said, back seeming a bit straighter, shoulders set with a confident firmness that Draco hadn’t noticed a moment ago. “It’s not like the incantation or the wand movement is tricky at all. The hard part is—I know there’s not a Dementor in your house, but you know how Dementors make you feel?” Draco nodded. As much as he’d given Harry hell for his reaction to the Dementors their third year, he hadn’t been immune then, any more than he’d been spared when they drew close to Voldemort, trailing him and his followers like perverse shadows. “How do they make you feel, then?”
“Hermione and Ron are on it, I’m sure of it,” Harry said, “There’s nothing much I can do unless it comes back, until we know what it is, I mean. Until then… Well, it left that room upstairs. I figure it’s as safe as any other room in the house.” As he had no clue where Harry was going with this, suspicion was the only rational response. He stared at Harry, appraising him.
He put a leg over Harry’s waist, reaching his free hand up under Harry’s shirt to feel muscle and a rasp of chest hair against his palm. “Get your shirt off,” he said, freeing his hands.
“I never could have imagined you taking cock so well,” he’d murmured, just able to catch the corner of Harry’s mouth tugging up into a smile, “But you’re taking mine marvelously. You torture me to no end, do you know that, Harry? Even good at this. And who had the audacity to put you in those dragonhide trousers? It’s not
“Why’s that?” Harry asked. He’d already drawn his wand, clearly in preparation to imitate the statues in the garden exactly.
“I’m sure Hogwarts would be happy to have you,” Draco mused, “And the students would be delighted.”
“Not quite.”
“That’s the weird thing. I was pretty sure that it was personalized to you. I mean, I recognized them—your parents. But they weren’t actually there. They weren’t physical, I mean. Impedimenta, Protego, Stupefy, shooting sparks. We might as well not have had wands at all—the spells didn’t do anything. The thing didn’t even seem angry. And then I cast the Patronus charm, and it all just went to smoke. It was weird. It was all I could think of to do. I guess it’s good it sort of worked, but I probably wouldn’t have even tried it if Ron hadn’t mentioned that something about the house seemed… off,” Harry said, lifting a hand to rub at his temple. Feeling a bit ill, Draco sank down to sit at the foot of the lounge, staring out at the night sky visible through the clean windows. “And then there’s what happened in here, just now. Things definitely changed when you got into a good mood. I wonder if what’s going on in the rest of the house is sort of connected to you, too. Have you ever heard of anything like that?”
“Positive,” Harry said, and he actually did sound it, giving Weasley another reassuring smile, “Look, just keep me updated, okay? It’s no good both of us staying here, but one of us should stick around in case it comes back again.” Weasley wouldn’t think it too great a loss if Draco was eaten up by some dark creature, Draco was sure, but he didn’t say as much. He only gave Draco one last glare, then nodded.
Please note changed rating. ;)
He threw the powder down, said, “Ronald Weasley for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” and was whisked away in a burst of green flames.
“Someone who wanted to please the public, I guess. Saw you looking,” Harry had shot back, “Ah, there. Just like that...” After that, he’d pinned Harry down on his stomach with a pillow under his hips to work him over for another seven minutes, watching Harry rut against it with razor-sharp delight. He delayed his own satisfaction for as long as possible, until Harry had grated out a sound of post-orgasmic overstimulation, put his face in the crook of his arm and groaned, “
Draco didn’t have friends he loved to conjure up in his mind. He had fair-weather friends who came and went as it benefited them, as he would expect them to: allies against common enemies, knots in a net of contacts. He loved his parents, but he couldn’t think about them now without anxiety and guilt, bitterness and uncertainty. They loved each other, but love was all they had. Affection had always been stilted, at best. Draco could think of a time he’d felt a gut-wrenching moment of relief—when neither he nor his parents had been sentenced to Azkaban at their trial—but he hadn’t felt safe or happy then. More like crying. Quidditch victories—not a one against Potter, even—felt hollow and petty now. He’d been expecting his Hogwarts letter for years when it came. There were no baby-holding revelations in his life. His first kiss, with Pansy, had left him feeling nothing but a crawling discomfort. All his best school memories centered around humiliating Harry, which was probably too cruel to be used to fuel this sort of magic. There had been holidays to the French Riviera or to ski in the Alps, or flying over the vast, wind-bitten tundra of the Russian steppe. But all of that had been expected, and only comfortable or nice or empty, physical bliss. A good fly would probably only do him as well as a thorough fucking, and he didn’t think either would cut it.
“I might be able to find someone to take you up on that,” Harry said with his familiar brand of firm, obnoxious confidence, “Come on, Ron.”
There was a long moment of still after Weasley disappeared from the fireplace. Draco stood, watching the green flames flicker and die, very aware of Harry standing a couple yards away, watching him. When he looked up to meet his gaze, Harry had a quizzical expression on his face, and a little furrow between his brows. “Do you want someone to explain the Floo Network to you?” Draco asked with a saccharine smile, taking refuge in the familiarity of the rivalry he’d one shared with Harry. Except this time, instead of making some sharp retort or glowering back at him, Potter only gave a snort of laughter and shook his head.
to help himself. Draco crowed with laughter as Harry coughed and dashed water from his eyes, then pointed at the fountain which had gentled into a cascade and declared, “Fixed it!” Only a second later, he clutched at his nose, “Damn, dropped my glasses.” Draco was nearly sobbing with mirth as Harry dunked himself back under the water to retrieve his glasses.
Weasley shot him a venomous look, eyes narrowed in suspicion, and Draco really felt the calm, sweet smile he gave in response. Potter ignored both. “Yeah, it’s no trouble,” And then, “Come on, Ron. It shouldn’t take more than a few hours. Someone should keep an eye open around here to see if anything else happens, anyway. Go ask around the office. I think someone should know something.”
“Since my parents left for France, I have found that my appetite has failed me. It was on shaky legs before they left, but it’s only been getting worse. I have stomachaches quite often.  But even more than that, no food appeals to me. I eat every day—whatever I can stand. But so much of the time it feels horrible in my mouth, or the taste grinds on my nerves, or I feel as though my stomach is already quite full of rocks. Mimsy is constantly trying to offer me things. Sometimes I can manage a proper meal. But half of the time, all I can get through is an apple, or bread and butter, or oatmeal, or broth. Desserts, sometimes. But I used to love sweets, Potter. Now, nothing appeals. This soup is rather lovely, though. So I’m not going to be polite and abstain for your sake,” Draco said, giving a thin smile that was returned by a heart-squeezing grin.
Harry raised his eyebrows and cocked his head towards Draco, “So then, you stay with Hermione, I’ll stay with Draco. It’s been alright so far. That okay with you, Malfoy?” Harry asked, and Draco took his first easy breath since leaving the music room.
“Oh yeah? Kreacher—the house elf who lives in Grimmauld Place with me—sent me maggots for Christmas the year after Sirius died. So, what did you do?”
.” Obediently, the music book opened to the correct page. “You won’t be getting my best performance,” Draco said, eyes fixed on the first stanza, “It’s been a while since I’ve practiced.”
“So? He knows what he did. He isn’t a complete sack of dragon bollocks one time and you just forget all the other stuff he did?”
“About.”
“The turn thing,” he said, and moved to begin his walk around the circle, only to see Harry perform a sort of lazy pirouette on the spot, holding his arms like a ballerina in first position. Draco stopped, choking out a laugh.
“I don’t know on what foundation you’ve built that trust, but let’s just say that most people are left feeling vulnerable when someone else is holding their wand. That used to be a valuable demonstration of... of trust, I suppose. But it’s too invasive for modern tastes. Now, except in the most formal of situations, dancers don’t have to trade wands. Sometimes married couples do. It’s intimate,” Draco said, and his eyes fell to the holly wand in his hand, still there, its magic tingling against his palm. Feeling his face grow a shade warmer, he held Harry’s wand out, and Harry took it, sliding it back into its dueling holster.
The third-floor sitting room had once been his favorite room in the house. He rarely visited it these days. But on a whim, wandering about the house in a night shirt, he drifted in. Considering the state of the rest of Malfoy Manor, it really didn’t look too bad. The walls were still spotless, painted a pretty shade of powder blue, framed with intricate crown molding. Huge windows overlooked the gardens and the forest beyond. The furniture was all Regency era: cream brocade with dark carved wood and gold fittings. The floors had dulled a little as they had in the rest of the house, but the antique grand piano, with its gold-leafed reliefs of flowers and greenery, and its sly wooden legs carved to look like a dragon’s feet, stood impressive as ever.
When Pansy returned from her eight-month sojourn in Milan, Draco entertained his first guest in just as long. School friends though they had been, Draco was not so casual that he’d let her see him at his worst. He wasn’t that far gone. So, he showered and put on a nice dove grey silk shirt and put a real effort into fixing up the rooms where he’d be entertaining her. But no matter how many cleaning charms he shot at the windows and floors, or how much of Mrs. Skower's Magical Mess Remover he scrubbed into the hearth, the downstairs sitting room remained resolutely gloomy. He managed to make the floor adopt a greasy sort of shine, and the sofa had stopped looking like one good bounce would do it in after the third mending charm, but he’d really had to try.
“Dobby’s still the only house elf that I get at all,” Harry said, “Do you think he acts the way he does because of how terrible your family was to him?”
“Mimsy, could Auror Potter and I each get a calming draught, please?” Draco asked the air, and ten seconds later, wearing a floral pillowcase as a nightgown and a deeply concerned expression, Mimsy appeared with a pop in the guest bedroom with a calming draught in either hand.
“Right,” Harry said, “D’you want to stay behind me or stay here?” He could barely breathe, and didn’t trust his legs to support him, much less move him in a straight line. And that was before even facing the thought of the wand-bearing wraith in his bedroom.
Malfoy Manor was wilting. It had started slowly. Draco had been walking through a corridor on the first floor without purpose or destination in mind when he’d noticed a curve in the arm of a wall sconce that he hadn’t seen there before. In fact, all the sconces in the hallway had it; a dejected slump. Just a lapse in his knowledge of the Manor, he thought. After all, it wasn’t as though taking careful note of the wall fixtures had been his top priority in recent years. Maybe an original had been damaged and couldn’t be repaired or replaced for whatever reason, so his parents had bought all new ones that happened to be a touch more dismal. That was all the thought he gave to it, at first. Then the doors had become uncooperative. They swelled in their frames, stuck and warped and scraped across the floor, hinges complaining. Draco had sent Mimsy, the house elf he’d inherited from the Lestrange Estate, after them with a jar of powdered Shushabye root. But, they only developed a new habit of slamming closed when he left them unlatched, or opening slowly to let in draughts. Then there were the curtains. Draco had meandered, barefoot and clinging to his housecoat, into the larger of the two formal dining rooms, only to see Mimsy daubing frantically at the curtains. They had shriveled. A dull brown discoloration had eaten into the rich gold brocade curtains, climbing nearly a third of the way up their length.
“Yeah,” Weasley said, without conviction, and with one last suspicious glance over his shoulder at Malfoy, he was gone again in another burst of green flame.
“They’re pretty,” Harry said, touching a fluttering blue-tinged leaf, “Are they useful for anything?”
“Well, Potter, I can tell you without question that if what attacked me wasn’t a Boggart, I haven’t a clue what it could be, and I’ve been studying the nature of dark creatures and magic since I was old enough to read. I don’t know what you saw in here, but what I saw surely would have been the form a Boggart would have taken for me. Regardless, I’m not surprised that even Granger didn’t manage to turn something up over the course of a few hours,” He said. Harry straightened up on the lounge, hands clasped together.
“Draco,” The voice was steady, but no more than a whisper. It sounded very familiar. “You awake?” Draco groaned, petulant, screwing his eyes tighter shut. Perhaps the voice would be quiet, and he could sleep a little longer. He resituated his hips again, pressing his body into the warmth. “Draco,” The voice said again, and at last, he opened his eyes. A cold, bright beam of sun lit the room from the windows, half-blinding him. Dazzled, he blinked against it, eyelids still heavy with sleep. When the shapes of the room resolved, Draco found himself face-to-face with Harry Potter. Maybe on some level, he had known that’s who he was sharing a bed with. Maybe that was why he had been so reluctant to relinquish sleep—because he did not want to let go of early morning comforts, and face the harsh realities of the day to come. An unnamed horror in his home, and the twisted emotions that took precedence over whatever it was his cock thought might happen.
“You can hear the beat, can’t you? Four beats to one movement, so it’s quite leisurely. Two beats for the actual movement, two for coming to rest, as a general rule. 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-and forward,” Draco took a slow, sweeping step that took him ninety degrees to the left, “Backwards,” Another long step, backwards, turning ninety degrees counter-clockwise, to face Harry, who’d adopted a look of intense concentration, “Forward, backwards.” Two more steps, two more turns, completed the circle, bringing Draco back to just where he’d been when he’d begun the first set. “Left,” A skimming step to the left, followed by a half revolution, “Turn, right, turn,” brought him neatly back to where he’d begun again.
Weasley puffed up like an angry cat, but Harry cut in before he got a chance to make a retort, "Don't worry, we're going to look into it. Do you have anywhere else you can stay?" For one moment, Draco imagined admitting to Pansy he was desperate enough to need to sleep on the couch in her studio apartment in Diagon Alley.
Draco broke the surface. He took a choked breath of air and threw up his arm to knock aside the wand before throwing himself bodily from the bed. His hip and elbow hit the ground hard, but Draco could barely feel it. Through the wall, a muffled shout told Draco that he had just startled Harry out of sleep. Dizzy with panic, Draco’s hands scrabbled at the wood as he rolled onto hands and knees. “Just sit still, weasel. I’ll take care of you,” said the creature behind him, and Draco stumbled over himself, hit the door, “Avada—” Draco threw the door open and lunged sideways out of view of the door into the pitch black of the hall. He was running, vision gone grey at the edges. He caught himself against the next door, his sweaty palm slipping against the polished brass doorknob.  After a precious second, the latch yielded, and Draco fell headlong into the room, gasping for breath, every muscle shaking. He lurched, hand flying to his hip, at a touch between his shoulders, but within a moment he recognized the source of the touch. Harry had wrapped an arm around Draco, and his wand was drawn and trained on the open doorway.
“Expecto Patronum,” Draco said. And pale, but glittering in the sunlight, mist spilled from his wand into a shimmering haze. Harry whooped and thumped Draco on the back, jarring him as the mist dissipated. “Well, it was
“There you are, then. They make their wishes known quite clearly. And if those wishes make no sense to us, then… Well, it’s not necessary to understand those wishes in order to respect them.” As a child, when he had been dedicated to discovering the origins of all magical creatures, house elves had always vexed his brain. They were most like the many sorts of higher Fey—three hundred years gone, by wizarding estimation, though if extinct or simply in some unreachable elsewhere no one could reliably conclude—in that there were many records of them simply appearing unannounced without offering any explanation as to their previous whereabouts, and declaring themselves bound to a house. To his knowledge, that had not happened since before the Global Wizarding War. But then, the number of magical households had been diminishing rather than increasing since before that time as well.  Coincidence or connection? Draco tugged at his lip, mind flitting to the nest of Common British Fairies that had taken up residence in the well down by the herb and highland rock gardens. Funny little creatures, always grooming themselves in any reflection they could find.
"Are there any other options?" He asked after a second.
“They’re not dueling, Potter,” He said, chortling, “They’re dancing. Haven’t you ever been to a proper ball?”
“I did, but there was a lot of steps. Forward and backwards and revolving and counting. And this bit was just at the beginning. Was it the waist? No—” He slid his hand to Draco’s back, and Draco gave him a small nod, putting his own hand on Potter’s shoulder. Through the dress shirt, he could feel Harry’s warmth, and a firm bulge of muscle. Merlin, he’d filled out nicely since becoming an Auror.
It wasn’t that Draco had always had a deep, exasperating thirst for Harry’s attention. It wasn’t that he’d been seethingly jealous of the members of Potter’s defensive magic classes fifth year. It wasn’t that Draco was now living in terror of whatever was haunting the halls of his own home, or that he sometimes was burning up for contact with the outside world and other times so sick to death at the thought of it that he shut all the curtains in his room and let himself slip into a blissful, forgetful nothing. It wasn’t even that Harry’s thighs looked delicious in those trousers and it had been months since Draco had gotten to leech on anyone. The comfortable reason for agreeing to Potter’s plan was that he was curious to see if a fountain of blood would erupt from Weasley’s ears if he got angrier. “I wouldn’t want to impose, of course,” He said silkily, “But if you could spare the time, I would appreciate the lesson.”
“Outside it’s always quiet. Inside, not so much.” Draco winks at Harry and leads the way. He pauses at the black painted door before pushing it open. “Welcome to The Wandering Thestral, Harry.”
“I don’t care where it is as long as there’s a decent bed,” Draco murmurs. He presses his leg against Harry’s under the table.
“Circe, the things I want to do to you.” Harry’s mouth is level with Draco’s prick, pulling him from his thoughts.
“I think we’re wanted.”
“I miss you too,” Harry replies. He really does. He misses Ron, he misses the casual ease of their friendship and Ron’s big, beaming smile through the fire. “There’s a lot I miss. It is what it is.”
“You know I have a
“Story of my life. I’m always out of time.” Draco gives Harry a strange smile. He extends a long, pale hand in Harry’s direction. “Until the next visit.”
“Shut up, Malfoy.” With a happy, shagged-out sigh, Harry rolls off Draco and collapses onto the bed. “Your timing, as always, is impeccable.”
. “As you would know, if you listened in the first place—”
“Is the shirtless part a requirement?” Harry grins at Draco.
“Glad you approve.” Harry runs his hand over the scruff on his chin, remembering how many times Draco suggested it would suit him. His stomach twists. “You’re back for good?”
“You’re not the only one.” Harry leans up for one more quick kiss. “There’s been no one else. Just lots of moping around and furniture shopping.”
“Shocking.” Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. “We could have used you on the pub quiz at the Leaky the other night. There were loads of stupid questions about potions and some weird old coins.”
“If you’re worried about security, confiscating wands would be a far better idea than searching us,” Draco says.
, yes.
“I’ll take that as a compliment.”
Draco pulls Harry closer, sliding his mouth over Harry’s cock. The darkness that surrounds them makes everything seem more illicit than before, their actions driven solely by touch, taste and smell. He mouths his way along the shaft of Harry’s cock and wonders if he chose Alder specifically for Harry because he liked the idea of two hot-headed forces coming together in an unexpected compliment to one another. He has no illusions that his own character is as strong as Harry’s, but it takes tenacity to change, to grit your teeth and look inwards, to the core, the heart of everything, and recognise that rotten things need to be removed. He supposes he likes the idea that two things that shouldn’t work together somehow just do.
“We’re not here to criticise his home, you tosspot.” The unfamiliar girl extends her hand to Harry, a broad grin on her face. The fact she called Malfoy a tosspot reminds Harry of Lee, and he’s instantly endeared. “I’m Millicent Bulstrode. I look a bit different to the last time you saw me, I bet. I prefer Millie, if it’s all the same to you.”
With a whistle, he leaves the shop and Draco is left staring after him, wondering not for the first time, how Potter
“It depends.” Harry strips off his clothes and shoots Draco a quick smile. “How differently?”
Harry waves goodbye and ends the call. Staring at the empty fire instead of feeling desperately alone, he’s reminded of the things he still has. The people he loves and the ones that love him too, whoever he is.
Draco walks over to the windows on the brick wall that faces out into the beer garden of Merlin’s Kitchen. He runs his fingers over the wrought-iron frames, the pulse of Harry’s now familiar magic making his skin warm.
“Don’t you start.” Harry turns, his mouth dry as his body responds to Draco’s proximity. “You don’t have to keep me entertained.”
The familiar scents of coffee, books and ink waft pleasantly around the cosy space and the chill of winter is kept at bay by the warmth of the oil lamps and the crackling fire. It doesn’t take long for Draco’s mood to lift as the niggling reminder of this morning’s unanswered note soon dissipates. The whole sorry
“Because I like chatting to you.” Harry gives Draco a strange look. “You did know it was me, didn’t you?”
men before, at least not in the way Harry means when he casually mentions versatility. He’s had sexual encounters but that particular sex act—in fact any sex act involving his arse—has so far eluded him, much to his disappointment. The last thing he wants is for Harry to think he’s intimidated (he isn’t) or to treat him with a care that will simply leave part of Draco’s heart trapped in this dark, cosy flat forever.
“Liar.” Draco smirks. “How’s your wife?”
“I’m—” Harry’s voice is heavy with want, his mouth forming unspoken vowels on Draco’s skin. “Shit, I—”
“Just keep your head down, for Merlin’s sake.” Draco’s lips press into a thin line. “You don’t have to fight every battle.”
“I know.” Draco moves from the window at last, sitting back on the sofa. He crosses his legs and stares at the fire, not looking at Harry. “But I didn’t want you to come to Paris—”
When he gets downstairs Harry is wrangling with his magical coffee machine and digging around in the cupboards. His hair is damp from the shower and Draco takes a moment to appreciate the lean lines of his body and the curve of his backside.
Draco narrows his eyes, a strange idea gnawing at him. It’s so bizarre—so completely unexpected—he almost dismisses it, but it’s been a very unexpected night.
under his breath. “You do know it was your team
“It’s what she deserved. I’d hoped we could have a party for friends outside of the Ministry, but there wasn’t time to organise anything. It happened in such a rush.”
“I wasn’t travelling for all of it. I spent time with a Mind Healer first. They were good, but the retreat I went to after wasn’t. I’m shit at yoga too if you’re interested.”
“Positive.” Harry finds the part of the grounds he wanted to take Draco to and casts a few warming and cushioning charms so they can stretch out on the ground. “This is the spot. You’ll see them flying when the sun starts to set.”
“Do I have something on my face?” Harry rubs his jaw, frowning.
“Whatever.” Draco waves a hand. “I’m closer with Dennis Creevey and Roger Davies now than Pansy, Blaise and Theodore. Daphne and I write to one another when we can, but she’s busy travelling the world. I have other friends of course, but it’s probably wise not to give away their secrets. Our mutual acquaintances probably wouldn’t thank me for sharing their names and inclinations with the Head Auror.”
. He pushes his thoughts to one side and glares at Draco. “You have no idea.”
“You’ve only been here for half an hour, what do you know?”
, Harry.”
“And this godforsaken hellhole happens to be where I live,” Harry points out. He sounds far too cheerful for a man who lives above the worst nightclub in the wizarding world.
“Your secret’s safe with me.” Draco waves a dismissive hand and turns back to look out of the large windows.
, contact, physical affection. I didn’t get much of that when I was a kid. It’s important to me.”
“I think you do. Perhaps not in precisely those terms, but you don’t want me to see you like this.” Draco leans back against the headboard and stares at the wall. “Go and have a shower, for fuck’s sake. You smell like old booze.”
“Because it did, at first.” Harry shrugs. “It took some time, but it really is brilliant for non-verbal magic. Once we reached an understanding, I’ve been able to cast non-verbal spells with it that I’ve been working on for ages.”
“I’ll do my best.” Harry glances at the bronze again, taking in the angular features of the model and the slicked back hair styled in a very familiar manner. His gaze lingers on the heavy bulge around the crotch area, his mouth getting dry. Surely even Malfoy isn’t that arrogant? “Is that
” The thought makes Harry’s prick twitch with appreciation. He takes his glasses off and looks at Draco, who gets soft and blurry at the edges. “I’m not saying I’m going to be into everything, but if there’s something you want it’s okay with me. It’s
Draco’s unusually quiet, snapping the waistband of Harry’s joggers to indicate he should take them off. Harry does so and moves off the wall, stretching out on the bed. He laces his fingers together behind his head and watches as Draco unbuttons his shirt and opens his belt buckle with a clink. Draco looks so good. Like Harry, he leaves his boxers on but they’re tight enough that Harry can see every curve and line of him, the thick bulge between his legs making Harry’s mouth dry. That bronze statue had nothing on Draco.
“Hermione?” Harry blinks, wondering if the Ogden’s was off. “How the hell did you get here?”
The lift pings and Harry is pushed out of the open doors of the telephone box. It’s like thrusting his head above water and with a gasp he gulps in the air. His heart races and he breathes in London. The cool breeze, the fumes from car exhausts and the faint scent of bins left out too long. He takes in another lungful of it, straightens himself out and begins his long walk back to Grimmauld Place.
“Do you have coffee?” Draco meets Harry’s amused gaze.
The tension that’s been building for weeks and months finally snaps, and Draco gives himself over completely to the warmth of Harry’s kiss. He falls back against the bookcase, the spines of the books digging into his back as Harry kisses him soundly. Harry is such a good kisser, it makes Draco’s head spin. His mouth is hot and searching, his hand cupping the back of Draco’s neck, urging him closer. With a low groan, Draco fists his hand into Harry’s jumper and deepens the kiss. He wants to show Harry that of all the things Draco has to be ashamed of, this isn’t one of them. Despite the heat that travels through his body and the hardness of Harry’s body against his own, Draco knows he can’t take this where he wants it to go without telling the truth. As much as he wants to keep kissing Harry and never stop, Draco pushes Harry back with a firm shove that nearly sends him toppling backwards.
“No idea.” Ginny swallows. “You’ve got to be careful, Harry. I’m in a little bubble here. Morgana and half the team are into other witches. It’s different for you. The Ministry, the Aurors. I can’t imagine they’d be sympathetic.”
“I get on his nerves and he gets on mine, but we’ve been friends for a while now.” Lee watches Draco at the bar with a frown on his face. “You find yourself in the weirdest groups in places like Knockturn. No one’s bothered about their houses or dwelling too much on the past. We’re on the same side in one thing, at least. Usually trying to work out if one of the new blokes is just an Auror in disguise.”
