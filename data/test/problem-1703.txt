“I just checked. There was one, but I sent him back up to Ravenclaw Tower. A first year, basically afraid of his own shadow.”
Harry can’t quite suppress a laugh. “Good question. Sometimes I swear she’s on a completely different level of consciousness or something. She saw me reading your letter and guessed that it was from you, and then also somehow guessed the nature of the letter.”
Draco leaves it open, momentarily distracted by the morning breeze coming through his room. He collapses into bed, reading the letter again. It does feel like Mari is overstepping a bit, and in other circumstances he might feel uncomfortable. But the timing of this particular act of comfort is well-placed and all he can feel is appreciation for her.
Harry looks back and forth between Ron and Hermione; Draco watches as they have a conversation with just their faces. He feels left out but it also makes him want to laugh. Harry widens his eyes at Ron, who looks at Hermione. She glances back and forth between Draco and Harry, then looks pointedly at Ron. He sighs and looks to Harry, who grins like a child asking a parent for a handful of Galleons. Draco waits patiently, brows raised in amusement.
“Are you serious? Half the people in that room only ended up getting it by luck. You were right on target every time.”
Draco collapses into his own desk. He’s even more frustrated to feel tears forming, stinging his eyes.
“For what, Draco? For being right?” As much as it pains him to admit it, Draco had been justified all along and Harry suddenly understands the depths of his frustration, of needing Harry to know the truth but knowing how he would react, of telling him anyway because it was the right thing to do.
There’s an excruciating crunch as the floor rises above his knee, shattering the joint there. Draco can’t help but cry out, tears streaming down his pale face. He can hardly see, the only light coming from the tip of his vacant wand.
He knocks on Mari’s door, holding his breath and sincerely hoping she’s in. As he contemplates how odd it is that he’s now so comfortable coming here, the door swings open.
Harry had also been chosen to play in the third game, which he lost to that Denise girl from Ravenclaw. Hey, you can’t win them all. She does make him nervous, though. He’s never seen such an aggressive and risk-taking Seeker. And that’s coming from
She scoffs. “No! But I know you two. You talk about…I don’t know, shallow boy things most of the time. Quidditch. Brooms. Chess.”
“Excuse me, do any of you know what’s going on with, er—” He gestures to the open door, wondering if he’s missed some kind of memo.
“Yes, of course,” he says. Draco can’t exactly tell what Potter’s tone indicates, aside from guilt. There’s something else, too.
“I have some conditions,” she says, interrupting him. “You and I are going to have a private conversation right after this, Harry.”
“But what if we aren’t able to Apparate exactly where we want to be? Since we’re both bypassing the wards on technicality, I wouldn’t trust that the rules stay the same.”
“I don’t understand,” Harry says and collapses into a chair. Ron and Hermione follow suit as McGonagall sweeps around her desk and takes her own seat.
“I’m trying to help.” There’s something close to desperation in his voice. “I thought we agreed that this stupid rivalry thing was old business.”
Leon hums, thinking. “I know there’s a boy named Pierre who’s a rather skilled Chaser, and my friend Bella is the best Beater I’ve ever seen.”
Draco chuckles in agreement, not taking his eyes off Potter as he approaches McGonagall and says something to her subtly. “I suppose he’s just accustomed to privilege,” he responds.
She gives him a soft smile and nods, turning her gaze back toward an animated Ron. Harry tries to focus in on the story, but finds his mind wandering again in the gleeful din.
Draco grabs him again and spins him around, an action that is unfortunately familiar with Harry. “There’s more. He was talking to his father. He’s in on it somehow, they have this whole scheme—”
“I feel different. Things have changed so much. It feels like I might finally be moving in a good direction.”
Lying on the floor in front of him are Ron and Hermione. They’re both dead. With the pools of blood expanding around their broken bodies, he knows immediately that life has left their bodies. Skin pale, eyes open. Empty.
It’s as if the castle had known where they were headed; the door is already sitting proud in the wall, unassuming but bursting with kinetic possibility.
. It’s just a good spell to know. Useful in dueling as well as in self defense, and I think a lot of people will be at least vaguely familiar with it.”
“I see you’ve caught up, Weasley. Yes, that’s correct. And if I’m lucky, I won’t see you until then.”
I think this chapter introduces sort of the final facet of the plot that needs to be folded in, which is very exciting. Not much left to reveal, just development and fluff and love :,) Enjoy!!
about it. But…there’s something about Harry that is unconditionally compassionate and caring, albeit maybe a bit blind and naive. Still, there’s such a pure quality to that. It makes Draco wonder where he would be now had he seen it earlier. If he hadn’t written the other boy off as haughty, pompous, privileged. If he hadn’t been so scathing in their meeting moments all those years ago…
Leon finally pulls on his shirt, then closes the gap between them. “Never,” he says, then kisses Harry. It’s chaste and it’s light and it says
They both leave their seats and Draco backs against the wall, straightening his legs as his mother leads the Minister of Magic from the parlour and out to the front door. He rolls his shoulders in an attempt to dislodge the overwhelming relief that’s settled in; but he doesn’t feel he
This earns him a smile. “Maybe I still do, a little bit. But I don’t think you meant what you were saying. You were scared and you just reached for the words that you knew would do damage.”
“I don’t!” Ron says defensively. “I’m just a bit miffed you chose to spend time with a stranger over your best friends.”
“No worries. Er, so, we were just wondering what exactly you’d like us to do at this point,” Harry says.
feel normal. Harry stands at the head of the room, watching students his age file into the room and situate themselves in the rows of desks that face him. It’s both a comfort and a nerve-chewer to see so many familiar faces, and a good amount of former DA members are present. Hermione’s words of advice echo in his mind:
don’t want people to know that we’re together yet. It’s just a kiss, it obviously won’t mean anything.”
A ripple of mumbling spreads through the room. Draco sinks into his seat. He’s never been able to summon his in full. Silver wisps are typically the best he can do.
“I’m glad you’re safe,” Harry says after a moment and pulls away. Draco is shocked to see that his eyes are glassy as well, and the emotion in him seems to double down at the sight.
Now that he’s able to get a good look at all the teams, he sees that they each have representation from every house
“Nothing conclusive, mind you,” she says and opens the large book she’s brought with her. “This is from the restricted section,” she explains as she flicks through.
, three times when it wouldn’t be.” There are some groans at that, as it’s a more difficult question. But he needs to send the message that even if it felt fun and exciting, this is still a class. What happens within these walls matters.
The remark smarts, it’s a sucker punch to his throat. “Do you really think I’m helping my dad tear Hogwarts apart? This is not about you and me, it’s so much bigger.
“It’s going to be okay,” he murmurs as Mari continues to merge with the castle, tears pouring down her face and along the vines. “Everything is going to be okay.” He says it because it has to be true, it
“Let’s try it again, then,” Harry says. The breathy quality to his voice makes Draco wonder if Harry feels it, too. Or maybe it’s all in his head.
“She’s right, though! It does feel...” she pauses for a second, chasing a pea around her plate with a fork. “It just feels correct that we’re here, is all.”
“These days it’s very much frowned upon, but only in the last century or so has that really changed, as far as I know,” Draco says. “Not exactly something I’m proud of. But I’m fairly certain there’s no inbreeding in the Malfoy line. I mean, look at me.” He waves a hand up and down his body, which earns him an overblown eye roll from Harry.
Draco remains very still, trying to even out his shaky breathing as he hears Potter sit down in a chair next to him. It’s only now that he realizes just how much pain he’s in. Every limb but his left arm seems to be shattered all the way down to the innermost joint. His ribs are probably all cracked. If he concentrates hard enough, he swears he can feel his torn muscles coming back together. He gags thinking about the amount of Skele-Gro he’ll have to choke down just to be able to walk again. If he’s able to walk again at all.
A silence then hangs between them, the space suddenly full of their shared thoughts. The room haunted by change. Faces flash past in Harry’s mind, their vacant eyes making his heart seize up. Images he can’t blink away, ones that are burned into the folds of his brain, ones that still cause him to wake up drenched in sweat, unable to breathe.
It didn’t take Lucius long; it had been only a few days after the Malfoys returned to their home and returned to some semblance of order that Draco had awaken to his mother’s cries from downstairs. He still hears them sometimes, bouncing throughout the halls of the Manor, chilling his blood. While the Minister had given Draco a full pardon due to his age (and likely, Draco thinks, because the Ministry remains unaware of the full extent of his previous involvement with the Death Eaters), Lucius must have realized that he wouldn’t be given quite the same treatment. Flight apparently was the best option. Bravery had always been more of a Gryffindor trait, anyway. Good riddance.
“Hello, Hermione,” he says as he approaches. He tries his best to look friendly but can’t tell how successful he is by her reaction.
can,” Hermione chimes in, trying to help diffuse the tension as she looks up from a textbook she’s already started to read.
is all Draco can think as he moves, dabbing at his eyes and trying to get the trembling of his body under control.
“Back to the matter at hand,” Molly says with a pointed look in Bill’s direction. “What exactly are you planning to do next, Harry?”
When Draco comes to he’s still screaming, tears carving lines down his face. He rushes to his feet and presses flush against the nearest wall, chest heaving, heart like a bubbled-over cauldron. When he’s fairly certain he’s not in any immediate danger, he takes stock of his surroundings.
And, Draco must admit, there’s a feeling that accompanies eating a meal you’ve made yourself that he’s been missing out on. Pride, maybe. Accomplishment.
. McGonagall catches Harry’s gaze from across the room and gestures for him to come. He doesn’t have time for this, he needs to get back to Leon, to figure out what they’re going to do. He pushes through the crowd and realizes that the worst case scenario is that they just don’t go, but for once, there’s no part of him that wants that.
He then yelps when a Bludger nearly takes his hand off. He looks below him and to the left and sees Bella glance at Leon and then up at him.
“Yeah, I suppose I have the right kind of spunk for it. Bit of a control freak, aren’t I?” She pauses. “You know…I really am glad that we can still be friends after everything. I get that the whole world sort of loves you and everything, but you mean a lot to me. I…I know you in ways they never will, and that’s special.”
It wasn’t happiness. Like Harry had told him, all of the lessons that taught Patronuses were summoned through joy were pointless. Draco hadn’t thought of a moment, he’d thought of a
OK PART 2 because I had to delete and reupload, but long story short life happened the last couple of months like life REALLY happened,,,,and between grad school, working on a novel, and doing all kinds of other writing things, I regrettably let this fall down my list of priorities. I'm hoping now that I'm back in the headspace of this story I'll be able to update more frequently! If that ends up not being the case, it will most definitely be done in the summer (but I'm really hoping I get to chip away at it before then lol)
“Why do you reckon the Beauxbatons lot are even here?” Ron asks as they wait for dessert, sitting back with his eyes mostly closed.
,” dousing the boy and extinguishing the flames completely. Oddly, his clothes are untouched, but his skin is red and blistered everywhere. Madam Pomfrey calls for someone to bring one of the cots into the room for him as McGonagall casts some lightweight drying charms.
“You were right,” she says. Her eggs must be fascinating, because she refuses to look up from her plate. Redness returns to her face.
“Of course it isn’t. I have it on good word from Minerva McGonagall that your son has had no contact with his father since he disappeared. But it will be another thing entirely to convince the Wizengamot. And I’m sure you understand the difficult position Draco has put us in with his disappearing act.”
He only briefly catches Leon’s expression of bewilderment and disappointment as he all but sprints away, across the grounds and back to where things make sense. He passes the lake, his mind hazy, yelling. He hears yelling, all he hears is yelling, and someone is yelling his name. He suddenly snaps back to his surroundings.
A collective sigh of relief rises from the assembly. Draco tries to let the news calm him, tries to rationalize that she’s going to be okay, but he watches Harry reach out and give Leon a touch on the elbow without even thinking, just offers a gesture of comfort and a supportive smile and
“Of course, this also means that the Quidditch Cup will not be a reality this year. However—” she says sharply before another riot can commence, “we will still have a tournament of sorts. Madam Hooch will be posting a notice regarding the details by the end of the week. What I can tell you now is that House teams will not form this year. Instead, each team will be required to have members from at least three of our Houses.”
So it’s a pride thing, then. It doesn’t surprise Draco. He’s always considered Harry to be a near perfect embodiment of Gryffindor ideals.
Hermione and Ron had accompanied him into town the day before to pick up groceries and a telephone for Draco, which had proven to be quite the fiasco to procure. Well, the phone itself hadn’t been too difficult to obtain, but setting it up in the Potters’ cottage had been. Unsure what would happen if he tried to side-along Hermione into the house with him, Harry was left to set it up himself. Obviously, there are no telephone wires in Godric’s Hollow, most if its residents being magical folk.
“Don’t be thick. You tried to curse my face off this morning. You know, I really do understand what you’re going through. With the
Hermione’s face immediately shifts from amused annoyance to deep concern. “Harry? Is something wrong?”
“In the initial panic, I think many things were somewhat blown out of proportion. As I said, there is no evidence in favor of Lucius Malfoy and nothing to suggest that Draco has had anything to do with his escaping the law for as long as he has. He will be spending the rest of his days in Azkaban regardless.”
“Of course, you’re wondering how it all started, aren’t you? It can only be a blessing left behind by the Dark Lord himself,” Rowan says and folds his hands. “We just happened to have Ariana in our possession, and Pamela, observant girl she is, noticed that you were becoming close with Leon. I’m sure you can imagine how things developed from there. A massive stroke of luck, it was. Just another sign that we were on the right path.”
. Without thinking, he reaches his hand out and touches Harry’s. There’s nobody around, just the castle walls and the paintings and the distant sound of dripping water. As soon as his skin makes contact, Harry recoils, squeezing his eyes shut.
“Draco Malfoy,” he replies, the rest of his senses finally coming back to him. “Are you also a student here?”
“Exactly,” Harry says; his eyelashes flutter and his lids slide shut. Draco tilts upward and plants a kiss on Harry’s forehead, lips brushing the bolt splayed across the smooth skin.
He’s about to launch into a frustrated rant, but a small silver cat darts around the corner and stops in front of him.
“She does have a habit of doing that,” Ginny says begrudgingly as she starts to gnaw at one of her fingernails.
“Ron,” Hermione says with a sigh as she takes the seat next to Harry, “you spend virtually no time in your room.”
Draco sits in silence while Slughorn rambles, surprised at just how uncomfortable the man is. Draco’s eyes flit around the room to portraits of a few iterations of the Slug Club, a few with faces burned clean off the pictures. Like weeding a garden. Remove the brambles, distract with beauty.
Leon pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket. “It says here my room is the second from the top. Is that a good one?”
“Like Quidditch. And Defense, even. I was wondering if maybe you would help me out with my Patronus.”
“It’s still so soon after the war, Hermione. The whole world is constantly looking into my life and tearing it apart for entertainment, and something like this is perfect material. Plus, I don’t know the kind of treatment gay people are given in the wizarding world. People will think differently of me. Even if they don’t think it’s bad, it’s just another thing that…others me.”
I would like to point out that I wrote this 13k chapter in one single, multi-hour sitting last night. I think I entered some kind of fugue state as the spirit of Drarry flowed through me, and it was really magical and reminded me so much of why I like writing. I hope things don't feel too rushed in this chapter, and if they do then at least they feel realistically so. It's supposed to be sort of fast moving and a bit of a rollercoaster but you know I'm so close to the writing that I'm never really sure if it's coming across the right way.
“You do sound crazy,” Draco says, “but I don’t disagree with you. Maybe we’ve both lost it.” He’s almost forgotten that they’re not alone, Harry’s eyes the only thing he can see, the only thing he wants to see from now on. “Let me talk to my mother,” he says and takes one of Harry’s hands. “Maybe I’ll go back and forth. I think that might be nice. Weekends at the Manor, the rest of my days with you lot.”
. The sparks when skin meets skin. The feeling that he’s actually in his body, that life is something to be lived, not just something
“I know,” he says, interrupting. “I know how concerning things seem, but really, I’m going to be alright, probably in just a day or so.”
“We were talking about Hogwarts,” Harry says, rescuing her. “About whether or not it would reopen this term.”
It’s a little outlandish, yes. After all, this is someone Draco’s age, someone who purports himself to be close to Harry, to
He stops outside his old room, knowing his friends are asleep inside, then continues upward, resisting the magnetic force that beckons him back to the way things used to be.
“Anytime,” Harry says, feeling a bit breathless. There’s just something about this guy that makes Harry feel off. Leon exits his room and he slumps back onto his bed, trying to control his heightened pulse. All he knows is that suddenly, this daunting decision doesn’t feel quite as difficult.
He nods, cutting a sausage in half and popping it into his mouth. “I was just thinking,” he murmurs back.
She gestures to Blaise, who’s to her right. He clears his throat. “Blaise Zabini, eighth year. Also a Chaser.”
Michael narrows his eyes. “Do you really think McGonagall—or any professor in their right mind—would allow the school to reopen if there were any real danger to us?”
The song stops and Harry watches couples all around them kiss, pull each other in. Others who are there with friends clap and cheer, urging the band to go back to something uptempo.
By the time you read this, I’ll be on my way back to Hogwarts. Back to you. I’ve had to stop myself from writing you three times a day while I was at home. Feels a bit like overkill. I’ll have a ton of work to catch up on when I get back, but maybe you can keep me company while I do it? If you’re not busy yourself. Or, we could just be busy together.
No, this is a hand he’ll learn to hold. One that someday might mold itself to his own. Perhaps they have a lot of hand holding to do before that happens, but that’s a task he’s willing to take on.
“Oh, well… We were planning to go to Diagon Alley and just walk around for a bit,” Hermione says, extracting Harry’s Invisibility Cloak from one of her pockets.
“Right, then. It was very nice to meet you, and I hope to see you again next Sunday,” Mari says, standing up from her chair and waving her wand. Draco also stands (with some difficulty) and gives her one last polite tilt of the head before making his way out the door and down the hall, his slender legs taking him somewhere else, anywhere else.
A breeze blows through the room, toying with Draco’s overgrown locks. He really does need to do something about it, but for now he attempts to tuck the stray hairs behind his ears.
He sighs in relief when the door to the kitchen bangs open, revealing a very grumpy looking Ron and a pleased Hermione. Both of them are dripping wet and carrying wet paper bags full of groceries. They’d also refused to let him help with their trip to the store, though he suspects that also had something to do with wanting to discuss what had happened that afternoon.
“Don’t give me that right now. That man is an abomination and a coward, and a real shit excuse for a father if I’ve ever seen one.”
It isn’t until he wakes up from his next bout of sleep that Draco wonders why he’s still at Hogwarts in the first place. If he had
“Well anyway, I’m sure we’ll be hearing soon either way,” Hermione finally concludes, her voice subduing Harry’s turmoil. He nods, relieved to be on the same page about the future.
Heavy sigh. “I know. But all of this has sort of made me realize that, for longer than I was willing to admit to myself, it wasn’t really about him.”
“Good. Looking forward to a very interesting season,” she says, giving him a little push toward the small group of Seekers.
It’s in this moment that things reconnect in Harry’s mind. Yes, he knows rationally that what he had seen was the work of a squadron of boggarts, but he hasn’t seen Hermione since before that chilling moment. Her arms, the tickle on Harry’s face from her curly hair, it’s a real and physical confirmation that she is very much alive and—
It feels a bad time to ask if her own responsibility in the matter has anything to do with that, so Harry keeps his mouth shut. He’s not as emotionally ignorant as he once was. He can see that Hermione is projecting, and even despite being in the middle of the monarch of all shitty days, he accepts the brunt of her anger. If only to make her feel better.
Leon nods, looking down. “It happened around the same time as the battle here at Hogwarts, only a day or so beforehand. A large group of Death Eaters came and just...they destroyed
“Having you here helps. Plus, if I know anything, it’s that Hermione Granger is probably devouring a stack of legal tomes at this very moment. If not for me, than for you.”
“Arse,” she grumbles as they enter one of the last compartments on the train. Draco’s heart drops again when he sees the remnants of the Slytherin house.
Harry takes a step toward him, trying to swallow down the frustration that’s rising in his stomach, burning like bile.
And he stops fighting. At least, that’s how it appears to the naked eye. Eyes blank, he rises, his wand pointed at Draco’s face. It shreds his heart to see that Draco is buying it, that he thinks Harry is about to take him down, but if this is going to work, everybody has to be convinced. The fear radiates off him—Harry doesn’t understand why he can feel it like it’s his own fear, rising inside him like a tide, like flowing magma, but he focuses on this fear, certain he’ll suburb to Rowan’s curse if he doesn’t.
hadn’t interfered much with his flying is another point of tension release. Although, working with Weasley for the whole term will certainly be a challenge. Sure, he’s changed his mind significantly regarding Harry Potter, but
Blaise hates being interrupted while reading. Instead, he crawls into bed and looks out the window, the last shards of late evening light starting to dissipate over the grounds beyond. Before he knows what’s happening, his eyes are closing.
Ron nods and stops in front of him. “Yes, we did,” he says. He’s slightly out of breath, and his tone is miffed.
Harry snorts. “Typically, no. But not really by choice. I think I just attract the abnormal wherever I go.”
“I appreciate that, but I could never ask that of you. I think it’s best if we let the professionals handle things this time around. I’ll be making an announcement tonight to ensure everybody that the recent dangers are being investigated and will hopefully be put to a stop soon. I’m informing you ahead of time not because I’m asking you to do something about it, but because I trust you both and felt you deserved to hear it personally. And especially you, Draco, after what you survived.”
“It’s not a real game, mate. You haven’t lost anything,” Harry says as Ron touches down again. “You blocked a lot of points.”
“Love is a powerful thing, Harry. I know this isn’t the first time I’ve mentioned to you just how powerful it is. A form of magic in its own right.”
. I made a series of very stupid, harmful mistakes, and you were on the receiving end of all of them. I was…so confused. Everything clicked all at once when you held my hand and the idea of such a big change terrified me. So I tried to ignore it, which meant ignoring you. I see now how wrong that was. And I don’t expect you to excuse my actions. Fuck, I don’t even expect you to forgive me now. But I’m here. Before you told me your news, I was actually going to apologize for everything, because I’ve never felt this way about a person before. It
Most importantly, I’m so glad you’re feeling better. I can’t even imagine the relief. I risk being a bit self centered when I ask: do you have any idea when you’ll be back? Not that I don’t want you and your family to have all the time you need, but I also miss seeing you. It’s not like we have a whole lot of missed time to make for or anything like that. And I think it bears repeating that I am
A silence passes between them. Potter refills the glass with the pitcher on the table, not speaking the whole time.
Mari nods. “I understand exactly where you’re coming from. I think everybody is capable, though. It's just a matter of getting over the initial hurdle.”
“Because I’m not,” Draco says, his voice shattering around the last word. “Maybe I am when it comes to these ridiculous claims from my father, but there’s so much from my past and it all sort of hit me at once. What if they decide to take a closer look at all of that, too?”
“Well, when you save the world, there’s a certain level of arrogance that might be expected. Maybe that you were a bit of a spotlight junkie. I also thought you would be…sort of larger than life and intimidating. But you’re just the opposite of
The Tuesday morning buzz in the Great Hall is excited now that the teams have officially been posted for all to see. From the bit of French he can understand (as a Pure-blood, knowing how to communicate with all kinds is seen as not just dignified, but necessary) the Beauxbatons students are particularly looking forward to it. He’s not confirmed whether their school has a league, but he decides he’ll ask that Pierre boy who’s been placed on his team.
Harry gasps for air and collapses onto his elbows. He vomits; Hermione lets out an agonized shriek beside him, then faints.
Which is. You know. It’s fine! Harry reminds himself again that they’re taking things slow, and he knows it will be all the better that they are.
Harry takes a step toward him. Suddenly Draco is hyperaware of his own body. His fingers fidget with his robe. His long hair, still messy from his lakeside snooze, falls in front of his face. His posture, typically pristine, is now relaxed and natural. He stands a few inches taller than Harry, who has taken another step closer. His eyes…they’re such a beautiful green, and the way they interact with Harry’s skin tone makes Draco’s mouth go dry. The way his eyes refuse to look away.
Harry looks at him for one second, and another, and then his face melts into something that all but shatters Draco’s heart.
It’s mental that he’s so twisted up about this. He’s seen shirtless men before: changing after Quidditch, in shared bedrooms for years, hell, he’s seen Ron practically naked. But this is different.
That thought runs on repeat through Harry’s head as the scene plays out, an enormous crater in the center of the Great Hall, widening, sending massive chunks of floor into the abyss, swallowing tables. Swallowing
I uncharted territory here. I don’t even know what I’m feeling quite yet, which makes it hard to decide what to say to you.
“Somebody will vouch for you, Draco. The connection is so outlandish I don’t even think people will want to associate with the claim.”
Draco shakes his head. “He knows that his secrecy has been compromised, so he’ll jump into a paranoid state and be more then careful going forward.”
Applause breaks the silence of the crowd as Denise steps forward, laughing in disbelief. Harry grins and claps for her. She’s certainly one to watch out for.
But he realizes at this moment that no matter what, as hard as he tries, he can’t deny this new, jarring reality. Harry Potter likes men.
“Well. That didn’t work,” he says and presses his back against the wall, sliding down the the floor.
, had seemed so hot and cold. Draco does suppose he’d given him the wrong impression and sounded ungrateful for his saving him, but in his defense the circumstances overall were absolutely bizarre. There’s something else, too, something Draco can’t place but also something he can’t shake. It feels something like a seed of a larger realization, but there are too many things going on in his head to really nourish it.
“I’m going to stop you right there, Draco,” Potter says. Draco squirms. It’s bizarre to hear Potter call him by his first name. “The past is…well, it’s the past, alright? I’m not saying that I can forget all of the things you’ve done, but I also have to admit that my opinion of you was always formed by a very black-and-white moral compass and a biased opinion of Slytherins as a whole. Now, I assume you had your reasons for everything you did. I do know a little bit about you, after all, I…happened to learn some things throughout the years. I don’t need to
“Oi, Neville!” Harry says as Neville approaches, handing over his work. “You said you had some questions, right?” he asks, hoping the look in his eyes will convince Neville to stick around.
Harry groans. She’s aware that things aren’t that simple, but she’s upset and in the mood to nitpick. If she really wanted to do damage, she could bring up his ex-Death Eater status. But she doesn’t.
Harry shakes his head. There’s a fluttering, trembling feeling growing in his chest, in his gut. “What’s if it’s…”
Behind them, the Great Hall is still gushing like a long dormant volcano. A few students are still scattered around, unconscious or otherwise unable to move, too scared to command their muscles to take them elsewhere.
“Oh, yeah. I think he’s a little scared about life after Hogwarts, so he’s really giving his all this year. For Quidditch, at least,” Harry says back to Leon, trying to make eye contact while he speaks (like a normal person) but failing. The sound of Ron and Ginny arguing about new Quidditch logistics seems distant as Leon puts down his basically untouched piece of toast. Harry can’t help but feel worried that he’s eaten so little, but decides to keep his mouth shut.
As Draco sits alone in his room, he tries to piece together everything he knows. He feels stupid, all things considered. He’d already almost lost his life to an insane occurrence, and now others have followed him in its wake.
“I don’t get what you want from me! I hardly fucking know you, alright? I don’t owe you a fucking thing!”
Propping himself up onto his elbows, Draco surveys the trio before him, backlit by a golden sunrise. “Harry was the one who flew into a black hole to save Ginny.
“Really, though,” Draco says, the energy in the room shifting slightly. “Have we gone absolutely mad? Is this really a good time to…I don’t know, start something like this?
“Oh. Well. There’s a sort of…situation,” Draco says. “They’re still investigating exactly what’s going on, but apparently some kind of ancient magic was set loose during the battle, and now it’s wreaking havoc. Something doesn’t want us to be here.”
He nods. “Yes. Well. I understand what you’re saying. Metaphorically, it makes sense. I’m not quite sure how to put it into practice, but changing the angle of approach might help.”
He continues to try to pull his legs upward, leaning against the wall next to him for support. Before he can react, the wall follows suit, living stone grasping his wrist. He gasps in pain as it rubs against the bones in his slim wrist, quickly grabbing his wand with his other hand before it’s consumed as well.
, for Merlin’s sake—and Harry exhales hot air through his nose. He takes Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth, tenderly, and gives a slight tug before joining their lips together again. Draco has never kissed
Her posture hasn’t changed, all of her limbs still crossed in front of her defensively, but her face goes through what can only be described as a journey of emotions; they range from shock to blind rage. “This is a
Harry is avoiding his eyes. Draco can tell. He’s one of three damn people left in the room, and Harry has taken interest in his hand. Draco looks down at his own, a scar carving a jagged path across his palm. His throat tightens. He wants to press it against Harry’s.
Mari shakes her head. “No. It’s not quite that simple. In some cases, words aren’t enough. They can be a good start, or a meaningful punctuation maybe. Really, I think what you need to do is show people you’ve changed. Let them see that the past is the past, and that you’re working on making amends and rebuilding yourself.”
“What if I just Apparate us to Malfoy Manor?” Harry asks quietly. Draco whirls; Harry is staring down at the floor thoughtfully, chin in his hands.
the worst thing that could happen? The entire Wizarding world would turn on him? It wouldn’t be the first time, and it’s also less likely now than ever. As hard as it is to accept it sometimes, the majority of the community loves him, reveres him, even. Not one person directly in his life is someone he could see being disapproving, and if they are, he’s not sure he wants them around anyway.
“We can fix this, Harry. If you trust Draco, if you know that he’s changed, there are ways we can convince the world. Good luck, and I hope we speak again soon.”
Mari emerges from the stone with an odd squelch and falls to her knees. McGonagall joins her there and holds her as she weeps. There are welts covering her in a layer where she had been sucked into the wall. Luckily Madam Pomfrey is also somehow there already, pushing through the few bystanders with a large bag in her hands.
He’s about to ask Blaise how his first week of classes was when there’s a commotion from out in the Hospital Wing. Someone is shrieking in pain, and there are a few other voices also shouting. He sits up straighter as the noise starts to get closer. Even Blaise looks up in concern.
She shakes her head. “Nobody else has come forward with any interest. We think that the community sees the subject as a bit irrelevant now that Voldemort is gone, but neither of us should be naive enough to believe that there aren’t any other dark wizards out there. As much as I would love things to be peaceful for a time, I would much rather prepare my students for every possibility.”
“I think your headmistress provided me with a single room. Which is good and bad, I think!” he says, laughing. “I do like my privacy, but I'm also used to living with other people and I worry that things will get lonely. What about your living quarters?”
“Supposedly there was some kind of holdup in the kitchen, but those house-elves know what they’re doing. We suspected it was...you know…the headmaster’s doing… Point is, you didn’t miss much.”
Draco almost chokes on a piece of dinner roll. Blaise gives him a lackluster pat on the back as Draco coughs the bread out of his system.
Anyway, if he does happen to be discovered skulking around, his plan is to claim that he’s on official Prefect business. Most people are instantly turned off by that, he’s already found.
you. I think Healing is a pivotal career for the community and not enough people are selfless enough to follow through. I just want you to really consider what it will take. And think about your real reasons for making that choice.”
Harry forces a smile, sighs through his nose, and takes a step back. He turns and disappears with a pop, leaving Draco alone in the Potters’ living room, his nerves still on fire from Harry’s body pressed against his, from the cold tile against the back of his neck.
. Harry would have to be an idiot to miss the giant flashing sign hanging in the air between them. So he takes note of it, then ignores it.
“Can I help with anything at all, Mrs. Weasley?” Harry asks from his spot at the table. She waves him off, shaking her head.
!” and nearly knocking over his glass, not for the first time this morning. Harry raises an annoyed eyebrow in question.
“I just…need it to feel right. There’s going to be a moment when it just makes sense, and I’ll be ready. Or maybe it’s a lot of smaller moments. Either way, I promise, I’m really trying to work towards that.”
him, oh gods does Harry like Leon, and every time he has this realization it feels like a wake-up slap and curtains being opened to let sunlight in, and he’s afraid.
“Harry? Are you almost done?” comes Leon’s voice from the doorway. “Oh, I’m sorry, am I interrupting something?”
It’s unlike Draco to be out of his room after hours. But Blaise was awake still, poring over a book as usual and humming to himself. He’d come dangerously close to hexing his roommate, but Draco decided he would rather take a walk and burn off some of his nervous energy.
Leon tilts his head. “I think I understand what you mean. So we would unpack your…reluctance first, then move on to what happened last week, and then see where that leads us?”
Leon says nothing, just smiles. Kisses Harry’s forehead. Shuffles backward. “I’m going to put my shirt on now.”
“Bloody hell, I’m sorry you had to see that. I reckon she’s been drinking on account of the welcome back feast and all.”
“Sorry about that, here you go,” he says awkwardly, holding the clothes at arm’s length. His hair is messier than usual and he seems rather breathless.
Draco chews at his lip. “No, it’s nothing quite like that, I don’t think.” She doesn’t say anything, so Draco sits forward a bit and makes a choice. “Okay, I’m just going to vaguely explain what’s going on and hear your thoughts on it.”
“I’m glad,” Harry says. “Well, shall we have a tour? You’ll be living here indefinitely, so you might as well get comfortable.”
He nods, his face going a little hot. Right. And he’s already back. “I’m sorry for just showing up like this, it’s not something I make a habit of.” Although recently, it feels more and more like his feet take him places before he can even think where he’s going.
She’s closer to the rear of the room, eyes squeezed shut in laughter. Luna sits serenely across from her.
what I mean, Harry. My mum and your best friends put this wonderful day together, and you’re standing there giving them a hard time.”
“All right,” Draco says, grateful for Harry’s optimism but not confident in the airtightness of his strategy. “So…I’m a Potter, now?”
He feels Hermione swat his shoulder. “Yes, you’ll see.” Ron laughs through his nose as they start forward, Harry listening to his own breathing and the sound of quiet footsteps on stone as they go. He’s desperately listening around him for clues, his heart pounding as they guide him. They make a few turns, the silence around them a bit disconcerting. Finally, they come to a stop.
“I’m proud of you,” she decides, “and I hope it continues to be helpful.” She ends with a nod, as if convincing herself that she’d said the right thing. He can’t help but smile again.
Warmth creeps up Harry’s body form the small of his back, trickling forward into his ribcage. It takes everything he has not to kiss Leon.
“Mine’s already gone,” Draco grumbles, but he takes Harry’s hand regardless. “Can you Disapparate from in here?”
As they leave, Ginny mutters to Luna, “Why am I the last fucking person to hear about anything in this goddamn place? I hate it here.”
Before he can even pick himself up off the floor Harry is standing in the doorway. His hair is ruffled, eyes wide, shoulders heaving. He steps into the bedroom and meets Draco as he rights himself, crushing the blond in a hug and releasing a sort of gasp. Draco grasps at the back of Harry’s cloak, eyes burning with tears.
and his future is infinite. And Ron and Hermione certainly have a certain privilege that stems from being by his side for all these years.
“Don’t be. I’ve learned how to ignore it right well by now. If anything, I feel bad that you’ve gotten roped into it this time.”
The headmistress clears her throat. “Now, onto something that is not quite as jubilant, I’m afraid.” The mood of the room shifts in an instant. Hermione’s brow furrows and she looks at Harry, who just shrugs. For now, it might be better if she didn’t know that Harry was already aware of the dangers in the castle.
asked.” Draco feels like he might actually perish when Harry smiles, a slightly crooked but pure smile that shows a flash of white teeth.
He shrugs. “Not really. I suppose I’ll try to apologize to Leon, if he’ll let me. And then regardless of what happens there, I’ll have to tell Ron at some point. Beyond that…I don’t know. But that’s true of a lot of things. I’ll figure it out eventually, I guess.”
keep me updated on any strange happenings from now until we’re sure nothing bad is going to come of this. If we don’t monitor potential symptoms, things could just get bad.”
“See you in a bit,” she says, then gestures for her Houses to follow and leads them out of the Great Hall. Draco catches Pansy’s eye as the Slytherins shuffle by, but he can’t quite decipher her expression. He raises his hand in a wave as Blaise wraps an arm around Pansy’s waist and they leave together.
Blaise clears his throat and Draco gasps, dropping his quill. He’d completely forgotten that he’d volunteered to stay for a while, he’s been so quiet.
“Don’t flatter yourself. You never did,” he says wearily, turning to leave but inhibited by two arms pressed to the wall on either side of his body.
thinking about it, actually. Beneath the veneer of hating Draco, reviling the blond’s last ditch effort to poison his happiness, there’s the reason for his doing so. And sometimes when Harry kisses Leon, instead of the soft lines and golden curves, all he can see is porcelain skin and silver angles; these are the moments he has to dig his fingernails into his palms, remember who’s really there with him, the boy who
He’s crying openly now, not making a sound but allowing the tears to collect in the corners of his eyes and drop onto the desk below him. “It just feels like too much to ever make up for. What if I’m too broken to fix at all?”
Another massive crunch behind them; Harry realizes he’s up to his ankles in bloody water, freezing cold and flowing down the corridor. It parts around Rowan and Pamela and comes back together as it passes. The smell is metallic, rotten, like something ancient bleeding out. Harry spares the quickest of glances over his shoulder and sees that liquid is oozing from between the cracks in stones, in gaps of rubble, not just red but pitch black, bubbling.
“You don’t have to thank me, really,” Harry says, starting to walk again. “I did what I had to do. Almost anyone would’ve done the same thing in my position.”
About halfway in, Draco realizes he still needs to change into his robes, so he gathers what he needs and leaves the compartment quietly. He’s only just exited when someone barrels into him, nearly knocking him over and sending the items in his hands flying.
Harry’s smile fades and he takes a deep breath as he props himself up on his elbow. He cranes his neck and looks over his shoulder. “Oh, good. Hermione’s awake, then?”
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that, and he’s afraid that Rowan might actually be right. He can’t fathom what kind of twisted opportunity lies beneath their feet, remnants left behind by Slytherin himself, no doubt. Was this day always going to come? Was it just a matter of time before their home was weaponized against them?
“I am truly sorry for everything I said. It was absolutely meant to hurt you, but I didn’t mean any of it.”
“How’d I do?” Hermione asks. Draco just continues to gawk in the mirror. “Thought so,” she says quietly.
“That I’ve had a boyfriend before you? Yes, that’s true, but that relationship didn’t last very long, and it didn’t feel the way this does. It’s the only other experience I have.”
She shrugs, an odd gesture coming from McGonagall. “We couldn’t have, but they don’t care about that.”
“I was just saying that I don’t give a rat’s arse about this tri-House Quidditch team rule. McGonagall will allow us to get the Gryffindor team back together if you’re the one who asks, right?”
“Jury’s still out,” Harry says with a little grin. That he’s able to find humor in the situation might once have driven Draco mad, but there’s something oddly comforting there. It’s humanizing, at the very least.
Draco talks. He talks, and he talks, and it’s the most he’s ever spoken with his mother. Harry occasionally chimes in to fill in little details or correct mistakes or misinterpretations, but for the most part, Draco speaks. He tells her about the last few months at Hogwarts, and he tells her about the budding friendship with Harry. He finally comes clean about his stay in the Hospital Wing during which she’d visited him—his brush with death and the resulting blood magic—which earns him a severe look; a brief detour is made during which Narcissa lectures both of them about how dangerous blood magic is. Once this is done and she’s forced some biscuits on both of them, Draco tells her about Leon Laurent (Harry seems particularly nervous during this bit and Draco feels about the same) and Rowan Dorsey’s plan to rebuild Hogwarts as a Slytherin-only institution, and he tells her again that when the Aurors came, he panicked and Disapparated and ended up at the Potters’ home in Godric’s Hollow. All the while, nothing of the romance between himself and Harry comes up, and Harry gives him some questioning looks along the way, but for the most part he allows Draco to take the lead.
He clears his throat, trying not to blush. “As a matter of fact, I’ve sort of been…seeing a therapist.”
“At least it’s clean,” she murmurs to herself as she finishes. She then returns to her own chair across from him.
important to me. But the truth is, he won’t remember any of what we shared, anything we went through together. And that does hurt, but…I don’t know. I’m so tired of losing people, Draco,” Harry says, a weight settling in on his shoulders, behind his eyes. Hermione reaches out and rubs circles on Harry’s back. “If this can somehow be a bridge that leads me to something even better, I don’t want to risk throwing that away. Leon showed me that I’m capable of being with someone in a way I didn’t even realize was possible, and I’ll never forget that. I’ll always be grateful, of course I will be. But maybe this is what was always meant to happen? Someone else cracked me open so I could…”
Luna gives him a sympathetic look. “She’s having a really hard time with this. I’m not sure if she’s going to come out of her room, honestly.”
Harry smiles and shrugs. Like he doesn’t even know what to do with the apology. “Whenever you’re ready,” he says.
Draco swallows the lump in his throat. “Yes, I suppose he does. He has a way of doing that, doesn’t he?”
Again, Draco finds himself fighting the urge to reach out and grab Harry’s face and make their lips meet the way he feels they’re supposed to. Thoughts like these have been slowly creeping out of the back of his mind, he realizes, since the night Harry saved him. Only now, they’ve nowhere left to go. They’ve hit the front of his skull and they’re trying to claw their way out.
Leon nods. “I just heard.” It sounds like all the breath has been suctioned out of him, leaving him wheezing.
He sighs. “Things went fine. Look, I’ll tell you about it later, alright? It’s been too long since you and I sat down and just hung out, mate to mate.”
Because in the middle of the hall is an enormous chasm, and something inside is dragging Hogwarts down into itself.
Harry blinks at her. “You’re forgiven.” Easy. Here he was, thinking her reaction had been fairly warranted.
Hermione hums, face scrunched in thought. “I hadn’t really considered it. I feel like whatever the reason, we should know already, right? On account of Fleur being part of the family now,” Hermione explains in response to Ron’s confused look.
The knob doesn’t budge at first, then there’s a sudden warmth in his hand and it swings open on its own, allowing him entry.
And as he says it, Harry realizes he has a point. This Autumn Ball is the biggest celebration of inter-school unity since the Triwizard Tournament, and this celebration is wholly free of the risk of death, too. Allegedly. Ron and Hermione will be there. Either that, or they won’t go on his behalf, and that will only make him feel worse.
Once everybody has their wand back, they go through two more rounds of disarming each other, some students feeling bold and attempting to catch their opponents’ wands. A few are successful, including Ginny and Luna, who are partnered up. Ron gets close but nearly pokes his eye out with Hermione’s wand, which bounces off his forehead.
There’s a voice in Harry’s ear, and it’s telling him that this little boy from Beauxbatons doesn’t know a damn thing about his life, doesn’t know what the fuck he’s been through. He tells that voice to shut up, because Leon will know in time.
“Harry,” Draco starts, but he swallows the words. It’s not worth another argument, not here or now. “I understand,” he says instead. His heart is being torn in half, pulled in opposite directions. Harry needs to know the truth, but Draco doesn’t want to fight with him again. Even if Harry would never want to be with him now, it kills Draco to know what Leon is doing under his nose.
“Hello everyone. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Madam Hooch. I’m in charge of all things Quidditch here at Hogwarts. For those of you who I
“No, it probably wouldn’t if you used those words,” she says. Her mouth is still a crooked smile and her eyes are sparkling. Draco can see the wheels turning in her head. She knows who it is. She must. Shit.
Draco is really not sure what he’s expecting to happen when he does this. Maybe by some miracle, his Patronus will take pity and make an appearance to help him convince Harry he isn’t weak. Useless.
Harry stares down at the courtyard, eyes drilling a hole in the stone. Ron and Hermione view him with caution. “It doesn’t matter,” Harry says, because he has no idea how to make them understand. Even when it was Leon it never really was. That’s something that’s become clear in retrospect. The way he feels about Draco—the way he’s really felt all along, if he retraces his steps—is different. It’s real.
Harry is shocked by his lack of care. “We can’t just run in wands ablaze. We have no idea what we might find, and if you’ll remember, I have a class to teach this afternoon. I don’t reckon it will do anything for the nerves of Hogwarts students if yet another Defense instructor bites it.”
She shakes her head and looks around the room. “Ron saw the both of them a few minutes ago, but they’ve disappeared.”
Draco makes his return to the Great Hall feeling proud of himself. His own feelings of absolute isolation are still not far into the past, and hearing Pansy struggle with the same nearly tore his heart out. To think that he was able to provide any help for her at all puts an added bounce in his step.
Harry does wait, just for a moment, then pries Draco’s fingers away from his red-stained skin and jogs through the water, sending droplets careening in every direction. He falls to his knees next to Leon, turns him over so he doesn’t breathe in any more liquid. Harry’s crying again and there’s a hand on his shoulder; Draco applies comforting pressure as his own tears contribute to the river of blood and ancient water issuing from the Great Hall.
He turns to Ron, trying to distract himself from these out-of-place bodily functions. “After McGonagall just preached to us about House unity you’re trying to turn their Head Boy against Slytherin?”
Please leave me a comment! Weigh in: do you think this chapter is overwritten? Do you even notice a difference? Am I just so close to my own writing that I have delusions of making big changes when really it's all sort of the same and this whole end note was pointless? I am curious to see what y'all think. Alright, I'm done talking now, I realize I've gone on far too long hehe :)
“Yes, and I think you do too, deep down. I still haven’t really come to terms with it, but that’s the truth. Everybody had a choice. Give in to the fear, or rise up against it. We gave in, Pansy. That’s on us when all is said and done. But what’s important is that it’s passed now. All we can do is make the next right choice, and then the next right choice after that, and so on.”
“Skele-Gro is a powerful potion, Mister Malfoy, but it isn’t a miracle overnight cure. It still needs time.”
The rest of the time passes in a silence surprisingly comfortable. In just a few more moments, Hermione is using her wand to blow-dry his hair and he immediately feels so much lighter. She was her wand in front of his face; the air shimmers and gathers into a mirror. Before he can ask her how she did that, Draco is mesmerized by his reflection. Not in a narcissistic way (mostly). He’s never had a haircut like this before; it’s elegant but fun, and he looks
“That’s fine!” He turns to Bella and says something in French. It’s a bit infuriating that Harry is immediately excluded from whatever passes between them, but he supposes it’s his own fault for never learning any other languages. “Bella and I are actually just going to turn around and have a walk around the grounds. Anything particularly interesting we should see?”
Draco is in the other bed, sound asleep but with a fretful look on his face. Every few seconds, he emits a sort of whine and moves around, but he remains asleep.
But wait. Who’s this? Another person has just come into Draco’s view, as if following after Harry as well.
Draco’s skin practically separates itself from his body when the headmistress calls out, “Excuse me, I have an update!” The crowd goes dead silent. “The student has been found. She is in need of medical attention but will be fine once she is tended to.” She stops, licks her lips. “No attacker was located, but we will continue looking for the time being. I apologize for disrupting your afternoon. I hope you’re still able to enjoy your time in Hogsmeade.”
Harry glances back and forth between Pamela and Leon. Draco had been accusing him of being in two places at once, and Harry had been too blind to see how that was possible, to remember he’s taken Polyjuice himself, that magic doesn’t always make sense.
McGonagall pauses; Harry can almost see a new weight settling in on her shoulder. “Nobody is, Harry.”
There’s a pause and Draco hears his mother blow her nose, somehow dignified even in this. “I still don’t understand how he managed it.”
The idea of classes starting is a comforting one. Through all of the strange disruptions, there’s still a structural familiarity to being at Hogwarts that provides some peace of mind. Of course, this term is sort of a grab bag of classes that may or may not end up being relevant for him. Potions, of course, will be the main event. Herbology tends to follow suit, as well as Charms and Transfiguration. Care of Magical Creatures...well, hopefully this will be the last time he'll have to take that. And then there's Defense Against the Dark Arts...
“For now, I think I should go, though. But I enjoyed that,” Harry says, his face almost stupidly innocent considering the ‘that’ in question.
Harry can understand why everything has been moved. It weighs on him the second he sets his eyes on the rubble. Hogwarts may look normal above the surface, but right beneath the students’ feet exists a graveyard.
He can see that Leon is staring him down. It’s like those beautiful, honey-gold eyes are boring into his skull, trying to get inside his head. Harry tries to ignore the sensation, but it’s really quite distracting. He ultimately refuses eye contact.
Harry grins. “Thanks a bunch, Neville,” he says, matching his volume so as not to distract anybody else. “It feels good to be back.”
“I can’t tell you,” Draco finally says, and the words stick like thorns in his esophagus, scratch his throat.
He waits for the familiar sneer, already preparing to roll his eyes in return, when a soft smile almost knocks him off his feet. He frowns, blinking and making sure he’s seeing things correctly, and then suddenly Malfoy is on the train, out of sight. Hermione gives him a weird look but he just shakes his head, silently telling her that there’s nothing to worry about.
“So?” Leon asks, looking around to see who’s still in the classroom. Harry notices a slight scowl when his eyes pass over Draco.
kind of signs of reciprocating (which Draco is not expecting but will be looking out for regardless), then it can go into action.
“I’ve…sort of been thinking about it a lot since it happened.” Harry finally looks up to see Leon’s face is as red as his own feels.
Harry sighs. “Eventually, I suppose it’s only right. But not yet. Once everything has blown over, then I’ll start thinking about how to go about doing that.”
He hasn’t told anyone yet, but Draco is fairly sure he’s been Apparating himself in his sleep to his favorite spot next to the lake. Yes, he’s well aware of the fact that one should be unable to Apparate himself
“Harry, why don’t you go with them? I’ll at least let you help by giving me some more room to work,” she says with a smile.
Draco’s whole body hitches when he sees a light coming from around the corner of the hallway in front of him. He manages to get out a hoarse “help,” but can’t say much else through the pain.
“He’s going to be fine,” Draco says, smiling gently. She bursts into tears again, this time out of relief, he assumes. Draco figures he owes it to her to sit down and explain the situation, so he does. He tries to play down his own involvement; even though Harry had told him he was brave, it really did just feel like the thing to do. Joetta disagrees with Draco on this, proclaiming him a hero and thanking him over and over for saving her brother.
“So I noticed,” Draco says. For some reason, Pansy’s reaction has had a sort of instant reversing effect on him. Maybe it’s because he’s tired of her attitude and simply wants to contradict her whenever possible, but he finds himself with the odd desire to
Draco stammers for a second. “Well, no, not entirely. You see, my friend is…male.” Again, her expression is unchanged. “And he’s wondering if Harry is even…gay,” Draco finishes, trying to get used to the way the word sounds in his mouth.
“Why?” she asks when she sees the look on his face. “Poppy Pomfrey and I had a discussion regarding your assistance during last week’s incident. She informed me that the choice you made—the one that saved that boy’s life—was
All different sizes, shapes, frames, the mirrors eat up every available inch of space, slotted together perfectly so that Harry is unable to see what lies underneath.
“So, what now?” Harry asks. His body tenses when he realizes they’re near the place Leon tried to hold his hand the first time. Then, he’d run away from the truth that Leon didn’t even realize he was offering. Now, he glances around, sees they’re alone, and makes the connection between their hands that he should’ve that first day.
“Step back, please,” she instructs. Draco practically jumps backward as she points her wand at the vines, which are still crawling slowly around Mari, tightening, as she sinks further and further into the stone. Draco can’t quite tell what McGonagall is muttering, but it sounds like a mixture of magic and words of comfort to Mari.
Harry finds Draco above the throng, knits his eyebrows together in a way that makes Draco’s heart flip, as if he’s asking if Draco is okay. Again, Draco looks at Leon, standing next to Harry, playing
Draco shakes his head and pulls Harry to his feet. “No. Absolutely not. This has become too complicated, so we’ll just turn around and regroup.”
Harry opens his mouth, then his shoulders slump. “I hadn’t thought of that. I’m sure they’re not focused on me at the moment, though. If they
“Fine,” Harry says with a shrug. “Anyway, she’s a really excellent Beater. And it’s good that we have her to be a language bridge for Eva, too. I didn’t realize until today that she isn’t fully fluent in English.”
Further along the line he sees more familiar faces. In his shellshocked state, not even their inexplicable presence is enough to shake him back to agency. He continues to shuffle forward as he looks at Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks. Colin Creevey. Other victims of a battle that has been waging in the very depths of his unconscious mind since the moment it ended.
Harry rolls his eyes but there’s no mistaking his crooked smile. “You’re a fucking git, you know that?”
They’re in the hospital wing, Draco’s one functioning limb around Potter’s shoulder, their hands still pressed together, radiating intense heat. Where he should feel everywhere else, there’s nothing. No jagged pain, no head splitting sensation. It’s all gone now.
“My Patronus essentially just confirmed the suspicions that people have about me. That I’m a snake. Of course I’m not alright. I thought I was, and I thought that I was handling the news about my father fine, and I thought people were already getting over it. But this…it’s just going to unearth all of those feelings again.”
Harry moves to rip his sheets off, but McGonagall brandishes her wand and holds them down, trapping his legs. “You’re upset. That is perfectly allowed. But you need to rest and take some time to process everything that’s gone on.”
“Wait!” he says, and there’s so much he wants to say but Hermione is still waiting for him. He settles for a simple, “Thank you,” to which McGonagall gives him a nod and a smile, then turns on her heel.
“I had to kill him and bring him back to life to get him to the Hospital Wing and out of the wall,” Harry adds, in case it’s still not clear enough.
Ginny continues to glower into the fire as Luna and Leon take their leave, as if her gaze could add fuel to it.
“I’m going down to Hagrid’s,” he says evenly. “I just need to bounce ideas off him.” He pauses. “We’ll have plenty of time to spend together,” he adds to placate his friends.
Draco has to remind himself that doing this was his own idea and Harry is just trying to help. “Yes, something has gone wrong. I’m clearly not meant to ever cast a Patronus.” His hair is still up in something of a bun; he hasn’t been able to replicate the style like Hermione had, but it keeps the locks out of his face. Now, the tie is hurting his scalp, so he drags it out of silky hair and places it on the nearest desk.
Draco exits the Hall, still wrapped up in his own musings of the situation he’d witnessed. It’s without conscious choice that he finds himself following after Leon, heading toward Gryffindor territory as opposed to the Ravenclaw Tower. Technically, he isn’t doing anything wrong. Students have free roam of the halls for another couple of hours, and it’s not like he would actually try to get into their common room. Despite all of this, he finds himself crouching slightly, walking quickly along the wall. He hears voices around the corner and straightens up, evening his pace and pretending to look at something on his nails.
“I wish,” Harry says, but even though he hasn’t had much experience, something about his body less unruly, more developed, and the movements come more naturally than he’d expected.
“Are you bloody serious?! I would think you of all people would disapprove of something so crazy!” she’s shouting at Blaise, who looks less than thrilled.
it means you care so much that you’re considering yourself a part of the potential consequences, which is quite honestly much more than I could ask for from you.”
Harry smiles, his heart fluttering strangely. “Well, thanks. I still haven’t made a decision, but I’m definitely considering it.”
He grins. “Right. I suppose I did sort of force people to start using the name. Or at least get used to it.”
“Everybody, please, remain calm.” The voice of the headmistress is a beacon cutting through crazed fog, and almost all of the nervous buzz dies down immediately. Harry is glad to see her there, but he has other things on his mind.
“Fine,” Draco says and stands. He thinks better on his feet. As he paces back and forth in the kitchen, he starts to formulate an oral strategy. “So we Apparate into Hogwarts, as close to the Room of Requirement if possible. Hopefully there won’t be anybody around since the school is closed until next autumn.”
The rest of practice goes well. Eerily well. In just a few minutes, the three Chasers are already playing well off each other and communicating, even despite the language barrier. Christie blocks an impressive percentage of shots on the goals, and the Beaters succeed in throwing the Chasers off their paths a few times each. For their first time flying as a team, Harry is impressed.
She returns a half smile, eyes flitting up to his from her book. “You’re just lucky I was here,” she says, not looking up, her smile betraying her indifferent tone.
Things take an exciting turn when Hermione lets out a shriek, causing Harry to drop half a piece of toast into a glass of orange juice. She jumps out of her chair and runs to the window, pointing at the sky.
Harry fights laughter as he holds a hand up, once again shocked at the instant silence. “So,” he says, slightly out of breath, “what we’re going to do is pair up and do some practicing on each other. No point in just sitting around talking about it, as Defense is learned best in action.”
“You look lovely, by the way,” he says as she sits. She does, really. Her dress is a deep purple and she’s left her hair down and loosely curled, the red popping against the fabric.
Before he can continue, Leon begins to retch, curls in on himself. Harry can’t tell if his eyes are deceiving him but it looks like his flesh is melting away, he’s shrinking, he’s—
Blaise’s eyebrows both jump upward but return to their resting position. Draco pauses and Blaise offers a sideways glance as a request for Draco to continue. He clears his throat and looks around, making sure nobody is actively eavesdropping. “The problem is, I’m not fully sure if he’s…you know…”
“Besides,” Hermione grumbles, “by the time I’d decided I was going to do it, you’d already gone off with that boy from Beauxbatons.”
Ron scowls as his mother turns around to finish up with some toast. “Harry, could you also tell her that my room needs new furniture? Maybe she’ll believe it coming from you.”
“Why are you doing this?” Draco says, unable to stop his voice from raising. A small crowd has formed around them, but all he can think about is Harry’s fingers clasped around his forearm.
He shrugs. “I think I’m just...processing. I’m not sure if I want that kind of responsibility just yet.”
“Long as they’ll let us,” Ron says. “Once we hit the Burrow, chaos is unavoidable. Might be good to give Ginny some time to rest, too, before Mum is losing her mind over having us back.”
and as much as Harry wants to take things slow and do things right, there’s a cute boy who’s leaning up against him who would rather be kissing him than listening to him etching pointless words into parchment.
. In class. It didn’t feel complete. I think you saw the snake’s head and panicked—which I totally get—but I’m wondering if there’s more to it than that.”
Harry stops. Draco opens his eyes—he doesn’t actually remember closing them—and frowns, following Harry’s gaze to his forearm. A wave of nausea rolls over him. Stark against milky skin, skull and snake, hanging upside down in the Potters’ kitchen. Draco feels a stab of something dark and turns his face away, gulping down a breath.
His face flushes completely when Harry grabs both of Draco’s arms and pins them to the wall above his head. The position makes him feel so exposed; Harry somehow manages to get even closer, slipping one leg between Draco’s, the other flush against the wall. Draco’s sleeves have fallen and Harry must realize that this is new, unkissed skin because he changes course, lips brushing up and down Draco’s arms. This doesn’t feel nearly as good as wanton breath against his neck, but there’s something surprisingly intimate about the way Harry takes his time, up the right arm, over to the left—
As always, please leave kudos, a comment, etc. if you're enjoying! It just makes a lil fic writer feel so good to see that people are taking time not just to read but to interact!! Without further ado, enjoy :) <3
Draco is about ready to collapse in his bed and never leave it. He starts toward Ravenclaw Tower when someone grabs his arm and pulls him into a dimly lit hallway, causing him to yelp in surprise.
The concoction of emotions that hits Harry is potent and complex. Leon’s friend would be one of his Beaters. Alright, fine. Blaise Zabini…Harry doesn’t know much about him, except that he lives with Draco and is a fairly skilled Chaser, if he remembers correctly. This Chris bloke is the one who’d played Beater in Harry’s first scrimmage, the one who had winked at him. Not a bad Beater. Definitely has the arms for it, Harry notices. And of course, having Ginny is definitely a relief. He isn’t
“No, you’re perfectly fine. I’m just a little mixed up about things so I think I’m just sensitive about discussing it.”
Something else potentially concerning Harry has noticed is how strange and mutable his moods have been in the past few days. After his first Defense class with the younger crowd on Thursday, he’d been expecting to feel incredible, as it went swimmingly. And overall, he does feel a lot more confident going into his second session with the older students. But every so often, a little stab of something cuts through the joy, the confidence. A twang of sadness. A dash of regret. And when they happen, he finds that they really sour his mood altogether. He’s worried that his friends have started to notice. The last thing he needs is to push them away right now.
“It seems that way,” Draco says with a nod. “I’m sorry if it feels like I’m trying to get down on you, but I don’t think you’ve been honest with yourself. It’s only natural to cling to what you know, but what we knew was
“It looks like the rain is letting up, but I don’t think it’ll be finished by dinner,” Hermione says brightly, placing the groceries on the counter next to the stove. Pots and dishes are already whizzing through the air, starting to prepare the food.
Harry stares at her, trying not to let his mouth fall open. He scrunches his eyes shut and opens them again, sure he hadn’t heard her correctly. “You’re interested in
Harry has to admit that she has a point. He groans, running his hands through his hair. Hermione is the wisest and most intuitive person he knows. If anybody can help him with this…dilemma, it’s her.
Ginny scoffs. “My choices are Blaise Zabini and that meathead Meagher, you don’t have anything to worry about.”
He trades places with Ginny against the back wall, looking down at Harry while everybody else frets over Hermione, who seems shaken but unharmed. Draco hears his name multiple times, feels eyes darting back and forth between Hermione and him, but he fixes his gaze on the window, on the deep turquoise of the night.
He sits for a moment, panting, hands trembling as he places the empty receptacle back in its place. It isn’t the first time he’s had a nightmare like it, but it hasn’t happened in some time, and never in such vivid detail.
. Draco gasps and throws down his fork; Harry startles and blinks at him, eyes wide. “Hold that thought. I just came up with an insane idea.”
Because Leon is marching down the other end of the corridor, his eyes boring into Harry’s. His glasses might melt from his face from the heat in the other boy’s eyes.
Draco allows his wand hand to fall to his side. “What does it matter? I can hardly get a fucking ball to show up, let alone an entire Patronus.”
“Ravenclaws and Slytherins will be fine with me,” Luna says. “I’ll bring Ginny with me, too. I don’t think she should be alone right now.”
She loosens up almost instantly, exhaling. “Thank you, darling.” She turns to leave, but turns back around with her hand on the door handle. “Draco? I love you,” she says, her eyes wet again.
Draco frowns. “Then how did I—?” and then it hits him and he feels the color drain from his cheeks. “You can’t be serious?”
“I went right after the feast finished,” she says with a shrug. “As soon as she said we didn’t have a Defense professor the idea popped into my head.”
somewhere, but he’d been instructed by the Ministry and—in his opinion, more importantly—Mr. Weasley, that it might be best for him to lie low for a while. As great as his thirst to escape is, nothing really takes precedence over his desire to avoid unnecessary and excessive praise.
He knows there’s so much to address. So much he’ll be missing out on. Their first Quidditch game was supposed to be this week, not that their team had much practice anyway. There was a Hogsmeade trip just over the horizon. Although, he supposes he could go to Hogsmeade anytime if he wanted to. Harry is, for all intents and purposes, a free man.
this morning? You’re not in any trouble with me, if that’s what you mean. Externally…well, I can’t say for sure. But let’s come back to that, shall we? There’s something else I would like to ask you first. About your future.”
She smiles slightly. “You’re welcome. It’s what I’m here for, after all. I hope I’ll be seeing you again at the end of the week?”
, he thinks, trying to give Ron a reassuring look. But he knows exactly what’s going through his best friend’s head. He’s either going to have to play against Harry, or, even worse, he’s been cut.
“I’m going to go grab us some seats inside,” Hermione says, then she plants a quick kiss on Ron’s cheek and she’s gone.
“Stop, you’ll make me cry!” Ron jokes, already making himself a second plate. Hermione kicks him under the table and he swears.
“I know,” she says, holding up a hand in an attempt to mollify him. “You have to understand that I’m on your side. I’m on Draco’s side as well. Not only is there no conceivable way he could have been communicating with and aiding his father throughout all of this, I’ve also seen change in him firsthand. I made him Prefect, for Merlin’s sake! And after hearing about more of his history and the reasons he was in his prior situation, I hardly want him to be put away for crimes he committed only after years of being groomed and emotionally abused. But I only have so much power. Regardless of why he did it, Draco resisted arrest
Well, what’s done is done. He wishes Harry hadn’t brought up the scar. Draco hates thinking about it, and part of him still hates Harry for whipping out a spell with unknown repercussions.
Potter holds up his hands to stop him, nodding. “You do. Let me explain.” He sighs, scratching the back of his neck. “To get what’s still unknown out of the way, it’s unclear to me what exactly happened with the castle. I don’t know how much you heard or what you’ve processed, but it does seem that McGonagall has an idea about what’s going on.”
His knees collide with bloody stone but no pain registers. His wand has rolled away into a sanguine lagoon, and his hands have contorted into trembling claws. He doesn’t know what to do with them.
, he’s going to have to start internalizing that better. The tension is brief to the point that he wonders if he’s imagined it.
Leon nods and joins Harry as they leave the pitch. “You did a really good job out there. I mean, I knew you would. I’ve already seen you teach, and this isn’t so different.”
It makes enough sense. After what Potter had done, Draco can see why he might be a last resort to fill the position. Still, the knowledge that he’ll be acting not only as Head Boy and Slytherin Prefect, but
“Oh. Right.” He’d forgotten the purpose of their meeting. It feels so much like just talking to a friend.
“I just don’t think it will be healthy for you to be alone in that giant house. I mean, you’ll have your mother, but—”
Honestly, he feels rather fit. Knowing there’s a boy just down the staircase waiting for him makes him smile, and he stands in front of the mirror for a moment soaking in the feeling, the glow. And then he feels dumb for smiling at himself like an idiot, so he makes one last valiant attempt at taming his hair, takes a deep breath, and exits the room.
Harry suddenly remembers that Leon had mentioned something about having a friend who’s a Beater. This must be her. Either her aim is bad, or it’s
“No, Draco. I’m serious. Not just the magic, although that was admittedly very impressive.” Draco smiles. That means something coming from her. “But you threw yourself in front of a swarm of Dementors, and you’d never cast a proper Patronus before. Not very Slytherin of you.”
When he looks up, Rowan and Pamela Dorsey are both facedown, crumpled versions of the people they had been seconds ago. Leon stands between them, shoulders heaving, Pamela’s wand dangling from his hand. His face is twisted, gruesome, like nothing Harry has ever seen before.
Leon steps back. “You will if you know what’s good for you.” The words are threatening, but Leon’s smile is approaching ear width so Harry can’t help but smile back.
He yawns, doing his best not to fall asleep right at the table. As he stretches, he notices Leon sitting at the Gryffindor table. He’s alone, oddly. Draco doesn’t know what to make of it, though it’s far from his business. Still, he’s sure
!” Harry responds before turning back to Hermione. “I’ll have you know, Ginny and I had a perfectly mature conversation about how we feel about each other over a month ago, and we agreed that there wasn’t really anything there anymore.”
So he does. He tells her about the walls coming to life and devouring Draco’s limbs, about the panic of the moment. Before him a whole chasm of panic. Thousand of ideas fluttering around above his head until a few pieces of information formed a haphazard bridge across the bottomless gap, a bridge that he barreled across with no hesitation. A slice to each palm, two matching scars, the mingling of feuding blood, a tight squeeze and a brief sensation of being too powerful for his own good. Quiet, then so much noise, all at once. Whirlwinds of questions and explanations. And, the oddest bit, no real consequences. Not yet.
“She’s right, Draco,” says McGonagall. Her voice is weary and her shoulders sag, but her eyes are still bright. “It was quite an impressive feat of magic. I’ve never seen a Patronus so large.”
That being said, I wanted to get this chapter out while I still had the time and mental energy for it. It's bit on the shorter side, I guess, but this is a huge push forward in the plot. I'm hoping it doesn't feel too rushed and that things are coming together. Admittedly, there are some plot points from earlier on that I've sort of neglected a bit in the grand scheme of things; this fic has so many moving parts and it's hard of keep track of them. Anyway, my point is I was very excited to write this chapter and even though I have mild concerns about how well the plot points are all converging, I'm still happy with how it turned out!
you rejected him, especially because you clearly have some kind of chemistry. Normally I would say you don’t necessarily owe someone an apology or explanation if you turn them down, but this is a bit different. You’ve really sort of left him hanging.”
The house seems to agree. He goes to grab the first picture and finds it stuck hard to mantle, but the same tingle of warmth then spreads through his hand and he finds he can pick it up normally. He lays his hands on the other frames, one by one, cradling them as he makes his way back outside.
didn’t have emotions, didn’t have a soul. We were all just pawns, entirely disposable. The sooner you pull yourself together, come to terms with your failures and corrupt loyalties, and honor the fact that you have something—
Harry notices that Leon’s stopped walking and is now standing a few yards back, his eyes brimming with tears.
Hi! Sorry it's been so long between updates! Explanation and also some meta commentary on this chapter in the end notes if you care to read about the writing process and my thoughts and things of that nature. And if not please feel free to leave a comment or kudos!! That always makes me feel real good :) <3
“The Weasleys have been through quite a bit, you know. Once your innocence is proven, I don’t see why they would have any objections.”
bad a person. He did save the wizarding world, after all,” he says, not sure where the words emerge from.
“Hey, I’m not going anywhere, okay? This is real,” he adds, sensing that Harry may be holding onto hurts from the way Leon was manipulated, from the way he was so suddenly wrenched away. Erased from Harry’s life altogether “All of it is
It’s with trepidation he eventually climbs the stairs, every inch of his body trembling. Even though there’s nothing here to fear anymore, the shadow of past events looms menacingly. He half expects his scar to start burning, a sensation he only remembers the ghost of. The familiar prickling never comes.
Blaise shushes him. “Will you keep your voice down? I don’t know, I’m just telling you what I’ve been hearing. But there’s no sense in spreading it around, is there?”
The article goes on to warn against approaching his father or trying to capture him, but instead suggests submitting a tip to the Auror Office. It goes into a further consideration of why the Ministry hadn’t revealed his absence sooner, as well as questions regarding what other Death Eaters or other criminals might be loose. It ends with another discussion of Narcissa’s and Draco’s complacence in all of it, but Draco is unable to read beyond the first few sentences of that paragraph.
Draco runs a hand through his messy hair and fights to pull in air. In his head he can already see how the press will spin this against him, knows all too well the almost impressive leaps in logic they’ll employ. Even though he’d been the one to stop the Dementor attack, they’ll somehow blame him for the attack in the first place, they’ll say it was a red herring.
“No, you’re free to go. Please just inform me as soon as you make your decision, whatever it may be. Oh! One more thing,” she says and Harry halts. “I do hope you’ll continue with Quidditch, even with the new structure.”
She’s right; his feet are planted, his shoulders squared, tensed. “Right, sorry,” he says, chuckling nervously and resuming the dance. He tries to shake the image out of his head, glances back at the table where Leon is stuck, looking around like a lost child next to a sullen Ginny who can’t be bothered to make the pairing look convincing.
“Hello, Gabrielle,” he says politely. She then turns to Ron and Hermione and greets both of them as well, slightly out of breath but clearly thrilled.
Harry nods and they creep down the middle of the corridor, flanked on either side by ravaged artwork.
Just for a second, Harry pulls away. “Well, I’m not likely to be found snogging a Grindylow, am I?” he says, and then their mouths are connected again. It’s warm and slick and not even the draft from the open window is enough to siphon the heat that’s building. Harry’s neck is beginning to hurt from their awkward positioning and Leon seems fed up as well; he gently pushes Harry away and sits up. They meet in the middle of the bed, both on their knees, and Leon pins Harry beneath him in a shockingly strong and swift movement.
Seconds pass, and minutes, and the distant sound of running water plays harmony to Harry’s shaking breaths and his whimpers that are indifferent to dignity. His throat is raw and his body feels dry,
“This is not about that,” he lies. He’s really digging himself in now, but the very last thing he needs is to get caught up in the scandal of that whole situation. And then he realizes how selfish that is, because if he’s right, Harry will inevitably be thrown in headfirst.
“Thank you,” Harry says and lifts his chin in an attempt to look dignified. Then, he sighs. “Are you sure you’ll be okay here? I’ll be back as soon as I can be with groceries and a phone.”
“Harry’s right. I’ve been feeling a bit restless myself lately. After all those years leading up to our seventh, we’re suddenly sort of just...stuck.”
“I’m just…I’m going to go,” Draco says. He breaks eye contact and scoops his bag off the floor. As he rushes out of the room, he tucks his wand away. He can’t look Harry in the eye.
Draco stops outside the door. He could wait right there and go right in once the class lets out. But the idea of being seen waiting to do anything involving Harry feels like a lot at the moment. Plus, he can’t seem
Ron grumbles something about ‘being just as confusing as a girl’ as he begrudgingly trots back over to the broom shed, returning with a tattered Quaffle.
Harry opens his mouth but decides it might be best just to stop talking. She’s right, of course. Not only is he not remotely interested in her anymore for obvious reasons, but he’d moved on even before discovering his sexuality.
Leon suddenly stands across the room and breaks him from his thoughts as Draco opts to watch him storm out of the Great Hall. It’s hard to tell from a distance, but it looks almost as if he’s...crying? Draco is unsure of how that might fit into any of the hypothetical narratives he’s constructed, so he decides it’s probably time to go to bed and quit being so nosy. He gives the younger boy next to him a polite nod and thanks him for helping him with the food during their meal. He’s nothing if not properly polite.
Harry watches as Leon makes his way up the staircase of the boys’ tower, still marveling at his surroundings. He then collapses into an armchair next to the dying fire, his mouth dry and his eyes heavy. He makes a futile attempt to sift through all of his emotions, but gives up as his eyes start to fight their open status and trudges up the stairs himself.
“Ginny, you are one of the people who knows most accurately what it’s really like to live a day in my shoes. Just imagine the circus Hogwarts would become if I showed up the the Autumn Ball with Leon.”
“All I’ve wanted to do this whole night is dance with you, Leon,” Harry says, wiping at his eyes under his glasses. “Because…” He takes a deep breath. “I think I’m really falling for you.”
good and she’d been demonstrating constraint. Perhaps it was a warning shot. He doesn’t really have time to analyze her play style, though, as there’s a flash of gold in his periphery.
Harry feels completely blindsided, unsure of what to do. He steps forward and places a tentative hand on Leon’s shoulder, slightly surprised when one of Leon’s rises to meet it.
as a Hogwarts Professor raises the temperature of Draco’s blood. Not by a lot, but enough that he’s huffing in annoyance by the time he deposits himself onto a bench at the Slytherin table, which is currently populated mostly by Beauxbatons students.
He nods, laughing in spite of himself. “Of course there is. You know there is. Sometimes I swear you know me better than I know myself.”
She blinks. “Bit of a change of topic, but, honestly, Harry? I think he’ll be absolutely fine with it. He respects you so much, and he’s your
“I bet,” Harry says, standing suddenly. “Um. So. I think I should get back to Hogwarts soon. Just, you know, make everybody aware that you’re alive and safe and all that.”
Harry chuckles. “I completely understand. You should’ve seen him a year or so ago. He wasn’t just a prat, he was an
His chest tightens instantly and he slashes his wand through the air, dissipating the snake before he can get a good look at it. Fuck. Fuck fuck
“So it can’t be all bad. Listen, I know I thought for a long time that being in Slytherin was the same as being evil. But I see now that it isn’t true.”
She snorts. “Draco, everything here is confidential. Just because we’ve changed topics to what might inspire some epic gossip does
Hermione clears her throat. “Ron does have a point, Harry. I mean, I understand that the chances of even
don’t need to know that it’s a personal choice. Nobody else has access to the requirements from the Ministry, so it would just be us.”
Harry cracks his knuckles, tiny pops ringing through the empty corridor. Hogwarts is ghostly, most of the students already packed up and shipped off. “Explain what’s going on, let him know that he’s safe for now, and…leave him there, I suppose? Doesn’t seem wise to pull him out of the one place he may be safe.”
“So you just want to add to the rumor mill, then?” Harry asks, smiling a little as he gathers all of the essays.
Harry quirks an eyebrow and smiles slightly, impressed. “That’s exactly it, really. You just sort of…”
Artemis trills at him and tilts her head. While she is quite intelligent, Draco chuckles at himself for speaking to her like she might actually understand. Regardless, she sits obediently on the windowsill. She’s waiting for him to open the letter, he realizes.
Someone runs out of the castle and up to the headmistress, then whispers something in her ear. It seems that relief washes over her.
“You think so?” It feels like the wind has been knocked out of him. He’d been feeling like he was losing his mind and seeing things that weren’t really there, but the prospect that maybe he’s been correct all along is a towering one.
Harry sighs through his nose. “Technically, yes. But you were the one who realized something was amiss, and I was too blinded by a juvenile crush to see it.”
For a second, he considers backing away, returning to his own bed, turning over, forgetting the whole thing.
Harry smiles, giving Leon’s shoulder an awkward but hopefully affirming pat before removing his hand.
Draco exhales, a breath of realization. “I hadn’t even thought of it like that. I mean, we wouldn’t have to tell her
“Well, then you should…Hold on,” she says as she sits forward. “Draco, does this have anything to do with the strange goings on in the castle?”
He expects her to blush, maybe stammer something out in response. Instead, she just grins and kisses him on the cheek.
Harry rolls his eyes but returns to his seat, suddenly famished. It almost brings tears to his eyes when McGonagall says “Let the feast begin!” and all of the platters fill with piles of steaming food. He makes himself a full plate and sits back for a second before digging in.
“I didn’t even know you could be an apprentice in the hospital wing. Aren’t you a fourth year? How are you senior apprentice?”
Draco hasn’t made an attempt to Apparate while awake. Not even just to the next room over when nobody was looking, or back to his own room after waking up here. For years, that rule was one that was so concrete and impossible to break, and now in the course of a week, he’s been involved in five situations that shatter the rule entirely.
There’s a singular moment of pause where the world freezes, save for wails of pain. Then Madam Pomfrey shakes her head, swears under her breath, and rips the cork out of the vial.
and subsequent cries of amusement or protest as wands fly through the air. Harry smirks when Hermione skillfully catches Ron’s wand, giving Harry a big grin. Ron huffs, holding out his hand to request his wand back.
. So they didn’t broadcast that she was missing, and in the madness it’s not like anybody kept good track of who else made it to the other side.”
came from his room.” The words hang in the air, conductors of cognitive dissonance. It’s…not possible. Draco knows what he saw, he
“To be frank, I think that’s more along the lines of what I thought this would be. I…” he pauses, but forces himself to continue. “I was raised in a pureblood family. Sharing our feelings was never really celebrated. Sometimes it was looked down upon. I’m just not sure it’s something I’m
Draco’s heart trips up a bit. She was trying to compliment Potter, and he completely brushed it off. Not exactly behavior of someone with an oversized ego.
“And Marcus and I—Marcus...is my friend—we somehow managed to capture another Death Eater. We had our wands up against his throat, and I can't believe I actually did that but... What else were we supposed to do? I tried to bargain with the first one, I told him, ‘You give me back my sister, and we’ll let your friend go.’ He just...he laughed, and he said that he didn’t care what happened to his friend. I couldn’t tell if he was bluffing or not, but I wasn’t in my right mind, so I…”
Harry smiles weakly and tries to swallow his heart back down into his chest. He wagers one more look in Leon’s direction and sees that he now looks concerned and somewhat sobered.
Though Draco knows it’s far more than just a stupid grudge, the logic still holds up. If he knows anything, he knows that his father is a goddamn coward. He won’t come anywhere near Hogwarts if it means he could be tracked in any way.
“I hope you feel…better. If not now, then soon. Because you deserve to be who you’re supposed to be, and you’ve had enough pain for a whole lifetime, I’d wager.”
“Mister Malfoy, if you will,” comes McGonagall’s voice again. He hurries to the back of the room where they’ve set up camp: a circle of chairs between two beds, in which Harry and Hermione lay, both asleep.
She nods. “Correct. As well as a few other locations that have been sorted out now. We recognized that closing off that entire section of the castle would be a sacrifice, but one we were willing to make if it went life at Hogwarts could continue as normally as possible. Which is why I issued a warning during our first night together not to enter areas that were specifically sealed off. I don’t say these things because I like making rules, I do it for your protection.”
Harry bites at his lip, because there isn’t much of a plan. First, he catches Bill up with all the information he’d given Molly, which is received with shocked nods and a low whistle when Harry reaches the end. “As of now, we’re waiting to hear how Kingsley is planning to proceed with this. Minerva wrote to him with minimal detail about the situation and assured him that Draco is innocent and somewhere safe, but there may be some issues due to his avoiding arrest and all. There are already Aurors out looking for him.”
Draco groans. “Don’t remind me. I was considering locking myself in here for the foreseeable future.”
Draco almost slices the inside of his throat on a jagged piece of bacon when Pansy tosses herself onto the bench across from him.
The trio leaves the table, supplying quick words of goodbye to their fellow Gryffindors. Hermione lays a hand on Harry’s upper arm as they walk. “Are you
“We’ll send word as soon as we hear anything, that I can promise. Myself and Minerva are working on a plan to defend Draco. She seems rather fired up about it, to be transparent. I think she feels partially responsible.”
his gaze, really; it was just by pure luck that their eyes had met across the station. Three years prior, there would’ve been a petty glaring tournament. And only one year ago…
had that was free of animosity, though he reckons it might just be because Potter had been so flustered. Draco wouldn’t blame him if he still hated him; after everything he’d done it actually felt a bit strange that Potter would be willing to talk to him at all.
“Listen to me,” Harry says gently and takes Draco’s face in his hands. “The Ministry has much more to worry about than jailing the kids of war criminals, whatever their past might hold. And in proving that you had nothing to do with your father’s disappearance, we’ll also be showing how much you’ve changed as a person, even in the short time since everything ended. I know it isn’t easy, but your father doesn’t have power over you anymore, Draco. The right people are in charge, and the law will protect you.”
Granted, he’s had years of being in the public eye and lots of practice ignoring the stares, the pointing fingers, the vapid whispering as people pass. But as he’d only
Harry blinks down at the passage, trying to comprehend the information. “I’m not sure I fully understand.”
“This kid must be bloody brilliant,” Ron whispers to Hermione, who lazily smacks him with her raised hand as she lowers it.
Harry scrunches his nose and looks at the doorway out to the courtyard. “I’m not sure, actually. I told him when and where to meet us, so he should be here any minute.”
about them. Although doing emotional exploration right before the start of his last ever Quidditch season might not be the best judgment and could potentially alter his performance, it feels inevitable.
“Alright, fine! But do we have an understanding? I’m not Professor Potter. I’m just Harry.” Nobody responds, so he squeezes his eyes shut and jumps in. “Anyway, today’s lesson is going to build on the one from last week. I did actually read all of your papers, by the way. Some very interesting ideas about the point of a Disarming Charm. A few were…a bit off, to say the least, but no matter. Valiant effort from all of you, and it seemed like you got the technique down well enough.”
“During the inspection…something was found. I don’t know what. Even as Headmistress of Hogwarts my clearance level is apparently not high enough,” she says, sniffing. “But the castle is old, and my theory is that there are some long forgotten threats that have been contained previously that were disturbed during the battle. Or things that were left here with the intention of being released eventually.”
“Saving the world is a pretty good precedent!” says an undetermined voice from the middle of the room. There’s a round of quiet laughter which Harry allows himself to partake in.
Channels of red pour into the castle’s maw, a current of air gently tugging Harry and Draco into the Great Hall. Harry swallows down a mouthful of bile and almost falls over when Draco jumps into action. There are several students pressed up against the walls, holding on to extinguished candles, their wailing hardly audible over the whining howl of the pit. Even if the vacuum wasn’t devouring everything in sight, the chasm has grown too big to go around.
Harry rolls his eyes, grabbing his broom. “I wasn’t lying to you, Ron. I just don’t see her that way anymore.”
, I mean—Ron and Hermione are going to be a huge part of it. They’re my family, Draco. I know this is a lot of vulnerability to ask from you, but better to start now, right?”
“Objective attractiveness aside, you’re one of the most genuine people I’ve ever met. Right away, you were so warm and welcoming to me, even despite our different backgrounds and the fact that we Beauxbatons lot have essentially invaded your castle.”
In her seat, Draco’s mother startles and draws her wand, then turns to him and immediately casts it aside. “Draco,” she cries, tears welling in her eyes.
“We reckoned we were safer on the property so no Muggles would see or hear us. Blimey, Harry, we were even calling your name for a good ten minutes at one point. There’s that big bloody hole in the side so we figured you might hear us.”
The Headmistress’ office is very simply done and almost cozy. A fire blazes jovially behind her as she prepares a tray of tea and biscuits (for which Draco’s stomach is grateful). The portraits of past headmasters gaze down at them. Draco feels a twang of guilt like a stab in his side when he locks eyes with Albus Dumbledore, who gives him a sad sort of smile and a nod before disappearing from his frame.
Luna’s joined the group in the meantime and, oddly enough, her and Ron have paired off while Hermione dances with her arms around Leon’s neck.
Leon chuckles and moves them to the side. “What do you say we go for a walk? It’s so nice out now that autumn is approaching.”
dragged her away, and now all I hear when I try to sleep is the sound of her crying and screaming for me to save her, and I just couldn’t
Harry stands in the courtyard, turning slow circles and smiling up at the sun. Somehow, even despite the horror of the last few days, the uncertainty that lies ahead, he finds it impossible not to grin, to drink in the golden beams.
“No buts! She’s just been through something traumatic, and her family should be showing up any minute now.”
The trio rounds the corner of the outer walk of the courtyard and he has nowhere to go, so he stays put and pretends to be studying something on one of his nails. Their raucous mirth ceases at the sight of him (something he’s accustomed to) and he looks up, trying to keep his face neutral.
Harry looks back toward the interior of the castle and sees Draco emerging, pallid, visibly shaken. His eyes meet Harry’s; he asks with his face,
The chamber is one he’s never seen, and the visual is immediately overwhelming. It’s a tall room, maybe three or four stories, and only about ten feet across. Perfectly circular, the cylinder stretches up, the entire space bathed in a strange, pinkish sort of light of unknown origin.
He doesn’t know what time it is, nor does he care. Draco lays with Harry until he finally does break from his sleep and grabs for his glasses on the stand next to the bed.
Harry draws his wand and gives a little sigh. “Not all magic is just brute force and willpower. Sometimes it has to come from somewhere more soft, more inviting. You have to coax it out, rather than keep punching a wall until you break through.”
“I think that’s a good way to approach it,” Hermione says. She pats his upper arm and pushes off the ground. “There’s some other information in here, if you ever want to look through. I was only kidding about keeping it from you.”
Draco sighs. “Maybe that’s true, but you’re forgetting the part where I broke every rule in the book to avoid aforementioned formality,” he says, scare quoting the last word with a bend of his fingers.
“So that’s it, huh? You’re just going to toss me to the side like that? I don’t understand what you’re so afraid of. I know you felt something too. I’m not some little boy, Harry. I know who I am. Do you know you?”
“You will also be protected in all of the proceedings. Your pardon for all of the cooperation during the aftermath of Voldemort—sorry, I know, you said…—in the aftermath of the Dark Lord’s defeat will be upheld. You have been invaluable to us, Narcissa. Had you not testified under the influence of Veritaserum, I still would have believed you.”
A ripple of murmuring shoots through the classroom. Harry sees a hand shoot up and points toward it, Ernie Macmillan’s voice cutting through the air. “Isn’t that what you used to defeat, well, you know…” he says, trailing off when he realizes all attention is on him.
Hermione shoots him a small frown but pulls the ribbon from the book’s binding between the pages to save her place as she closes it.
“So I wanted to start simple, with a little spell that I’ve used countless times in real life situations.
Harry bursts through the door, his hair a bit wild. “I came back as soon as I heard. Another one? Are you okay?”
“I know everybody hates me,” is what comes out. It’s not what he’d meant to say, though it’s not an entirely inaccurate reflection of his mindset.
Harry shakes his head. “You’re doing everything you can. There’s no obvious source, so fighting back against it is impossible at the moment.”
Harry is hit by a whole stew of emotions. He knows Ron’s intentions aren’t bad, and he also realizes that the news makes no sense to Ron. It still hurts to open himself up and be laughed at, though.
Luna shrugs, looking dreamy and uninvested. “I saw the way you were eyeing him. I don’t fully trust him, but I’m not sure yet. Only time will tell. Something just seems off.”
“Not just anybody would be as forgiving as you are,” he says, exasperated, throwing his hands to his sides. “Not everybody is. I know that for a fact. So would you just accept my bloody thanks so we can move on? I feel like I’m still two steps behind in whatever this is because you’ve already moved on, and I’m really just trying to catch up and do the same. So, just…please.”
” Draco is shocked to find his own hands shaking madly, like dead leaves hanging on to dried up branches.
It’s the answer he’d been expecting, and it still isn’t the one he wanted to hear. “That’s what I thought.”
Draco frowns. “What would I know that you don’t?” He assumes McGonagall has been keeping her staff up to date, but maybe some things have slipped through the cracks.
Draco remembers in this moment that Leon is the Head Boy for Beauxbatons. Damn it. Whatever plan they make to move forward, Leon is on the inside of it. Draco has to think of something quickly, some way to either get rid of Leon or postpone this emergency council.
He finds Ron and Hermione talking on a couch and slumps down across from them, releasing a frustrated huff.
best friend and might ask her to the ball. Plus, Luna and I represent inter-House unity, and you and Leon would be inter-school.”
She holds his gaze for a second. “Yes, I suppose it has to be something along those lines. Draco, are you sure you’re alright? Not just physically, but, you know…”
thinking, and not enough deciding? It’s hard to tell. Lately, it seems like emotions have been bubbling to the surface of his mind, threatening to spill over and stain his status quo. It isn’t until he’s leaving the room that things start to click. He bumps into another student and mutters a quick “sorry” before allowing her to pass by, and it’s this one word that makes his heart sink like a bezoar dropped down a well.
Draco briefly considers weaving his way through the sea of bodies and pulling Harry aside, trying to tell him what he saw. If there was more between them, one level deeper of trust, the words would land and something could be done. Right now, though, Draco’s truth will be lost behind moonstruck eyes and elbow touches. He turns and leaves.
make sure you regret it,” she says. The words are jagged. Like a set of knives held directly above his heart. He doesn’t doubt that she would let them fall. “Please, prove me wrong, Draco.”
Harry stares at her for a second, trying to think of some kind of rebuttal, but nothing comes to him. While extreme, he supposes her feelings are fair.
“When the Death Eaters broke into the school, my best friend and I hid right away. It just seemed like the thing to do initially, you know? Your instincts kick in and you fight or you flee. We almost managed to make it out of the school, but… I wasn’t sure where my sister was, I couldn’t find Ariana—” The name strikes something inside Harry. “...and I just couldn’t bring myself to leave not knowing... I asked whoever I could find if they had seen her, but everybody was so panicked that they weren’t really paying attention to what was going on around them or who they saw.”
Call it wishful thinking, but as Hermione gives him one last smile and leaves him alone in an empty corridor, Draco could swear that there’s encouragement in her eyes.
It all hits Harry at once and he struggles to stay on his feet. His head is light, buzzing, his vision pulsing dark around the edges with each sledgehammer heartbeat. It was never really Leon, was it? Maybe in moments, in glimpses, but his mind wasn’t his own.
“—but I’m tired of fighting, Draco. I really am. I’m just exhausted, and I can’t afford to spend any energy bickering and keeping up some stupid juvenile rivalry with you. Which means, yes, you sort of get a second chance. Don’t waste it,” he says curtly, standing.
know, welcome back.” She flashes a few smiles at familiar faces and tosses a quick wink in Harry’s direction. He grins back. “I’m sure you’ve already read the rules and guidelines when it comes to the forming of teams. I’ve been informed that they were a bit vague, so to clarify: each team will consist of players from
Harry seems to grasp around in the dark, trying to find the words, but before he can respond, Draco’s mother rushes by again with a plate full of biscuits. They’re Draco’s favorite, the kind with a dollop of jam in the center, and suddenly his mouth is watering and his eyes are tearing up.
have to apologize for? Harry was the one who initiated this in the first place. “I got a little carried away. It’s just. You know. We’re in your private bedroom where nobody will accidentally walk in on us, and I suppose that got me too excited.”
She gives him a blank look. Draco steps aside. Pamela pushes past him with a roll of her eyes and struts up to Madam Pomfrey, who barks, “You’re late.”
Leon nods in return, then reaches for Harry’s right hand, which lands on Leon’s chest. The hair there
I’ve had?” Ron asks. They’re sitting in the Gryffindor Common Room before dinner, work sitting in front of them, neglected.
That’s why he’s waiting in the courtyard for his friends. For Draco. Harry needs to be in motion, needs to push forward to whatever comes next. He’s spent his whole fucking life dwelling on the past, and he’s good and tired of that. There are conversations that need to happen, of course. People who have been left behind, who have forgotten, who can’t
“I’ll just be a couple more minutes,” Harry murmurs. Leon hums his acknowledgment, the vibration of it resonating in Harry’s body.
“I hope you’ve all had your fill to eat, as the feast is now coming to its conclusion,” comes McGonagall’s voice a short while later. “Again, I must say how appreciative I am that you’re all so willing to cooperate and be flexible as we continue to work things out. Now, I’ll ask that our Prefects direct their Houses to your respective dormitories. Slytherins, if you would please follow Ravenclaw House. Guests from Beauxbatons, you will stay here in the Great Hall while we separate you off into the three living quarters.”
Leon looks at him for a second. He’s crying now, too, his lip trembling. He almost betrays Harry completely, almost takes the plunge for both of them and closes the distance, Harry can see it in the way he’s rocking on his feet. The song reaches its final chorus and Leon lets out a single sob, rips his hat from atop golden hair, then shakes his head and runs off.
Harry finally looks up at him, at this embodiment of golden light on two legs, and for a brief moment all of the fear scatters.
Leon lifts his head from its position on Harry’s shoulder and turns to face him. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” he says, exaggerating the French in his accent.
“All I’m saying is that only people who’re Muggle-born would be naive enough to let themselves be sorted into Slytherin. And even then, the train ride is plenty of time for the other Houses to put ideas in their heads.”
“I…don’t know,” Harry says. Draco’s chest tightens. A strange mix of emotions is hitting him from nowhere and he can’t help but feel mortally conflicted, but he has no idea what about.
Draco turns toward the crowd; Luna follows him to the tide’s edge. He clears his throat. “We’ll be escorting you back to your dormitories, just to ensure that everybody arrives safely. Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs with me, Slytherins and Ravenclaws with Luna. All Beauxbatons students will join whichever House they’re staying with. Let’s do this calmly but quickly, and once you’re in your common rooms, please stay there for the rest of the night.” Draco looks to Luna, who gives him a slight smile and a nod.
She sighs. “Listen, Draco. This is a space free of pretense. It’s not my job to judge your past. I wasn’t there, for starters. I didn’t witness any of the stories I’ve heard—and I have heard things, just to be completely transparent. But I don’t know the whole story, I haven’t heard your version of events. I believe it’s highly likely that people
, and Harry doesn’t have the strength to break the thin thread between their pupils, stretching less and less as Leon nears.
Harry shrugs and sits down at the table. He reaches for the plate but Draco smacks his hand away. “I’ve only made enough for me.”
He looks at her and nods fiercely. “There’s one place I can think of. Do you know when that team of Aurors is arriving?”
Now, after a stretch of time without even thinking about his scar, Harry can say with conviction that it is, in fact, faded to a marginal degree, and he beams at the prospect that everything—even the worst thing, the darkest, most vile—will heal with time.
Harry considers inquiring about the story to change the subject, but hearing about that might be even more emotionally taxing. “Oh, Luna, I’m so sorry that you haven’t been included in things. With your being Head Girl and all. Though it was never really business, or anything like that.”
“Sure,” he says, grinning. “You know,” he continues as they start to walk, “I don’t know if anybody has ever been willing to listen to me like that.”
Draco shrugs. “All signs point to yes. We haven’t discussed it. It’s all rather confusing still. But I think I’d be delusional to deny what’s happening between them.”
“I’m so sorry,” he says; it comes out like a huff and a salty drop spills over his eyelid, down past his lips.
Another chapter? Madness!!! Notes at the end, as always :) Please leave a comment if you're enjoying!!!
This talk we’re going to have has me both nervous and excited. That’s how you make me feel overall. I’m not really good with words, even when I have the chance to sit down and think and write them out. I guess you’ve probably got that figured out by now. But I want to try to be better for you.
“It’s just been a weird time so far, coming back and all. Things will start to feel normal again soon, I bet.”
“I thank you all for your patience!” Madam Hooch calls as she steps back toward the group. Many are lounging in the grass, eagerly reliving every detail of each match. It’s late afternoon, a warm breeze caressing the Quidditch pitch as the sun starts its descent.
Luna sighs and looks back toward the stairs. “I’m not sure. I would be a rather bad friend if I left Ginny like this, but it wouldn’t be so fantastic of me to abandon you, either,” she says, her voice somewhere far off.
next year? What the hell are we supposed to do until then? Not that I don’t love spending time with you lot here,” he adds quickly when he sees Ron about to protest, “but we can’t just stay here and do nothing for the rest of our lives.”
“So. I’m sure you’re all wondering why I’ve gathered you here today,” Harry says in an attempt to break the tension that’s clogging the air.
“He won’t be in any trouble for the death of the Dorseys, no. I’ve already spoken to the Minister, and he agrees that—while tragic that Pamela got caught up in all of it—ultimately, it was an act of self preservation committed under extremely pressing circumstances.”
“Well, keep them to yourself,” Harry says, chipper, as he squeezes Draco’s hand and they fly through the darkness again.
“Draco, of course I haven’t,” Harry says. He brings his legs up onto the bed and tucks them under himself. Draco rotates to face him. “I don’t know how to explain how I feel about you, but when I’m with you, I feel like I’m experiencing emotions I never have before. Or, I don’t know, maybe they’re just really strong, or super clear. Emotion in its purest form, or something like that. But I’m
“What terms?” says Harry, finally speaking. He rises to his feet, anger cresting over him in a fiery vortex.
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Not possible. Team members have to span at least three Houses, and they haven’t specified whether or not that also includes Beauxbatons.”
Beside the fire, Harry makes a strange noise in the back of his throat. When Draco looks over, he sees that Harry’s fallen asleep, his cheek pressed against his shoulder.
Harry can’t stop the laugh that charges from his mouth, despite the importance of the situation, despite the fact that if he pisses her off, Ginny won’t be willing to help them in any capacity.
Harry feels his ears go hot. “Recently,” he admits. “I have him help me when I’m on night patrol.” Her look is amused, if a bit judgmental. “It covers more ground and makes me feel less alone!”
My MAIN point is, for any of my readers who are trans, I love you and I see you and I'm sorry Rowling is such a shitty excuse for a human because I know her works are so significant for a lot of people as a means of escape from harsh realities and such. But just know that this is a TERF-free zone (if you are a TERF and you're reading this kindly fuck off <3) and by continuing to write fic within the HP universe, I am in no way trying to support or condone any of the extremely harmful opinions of the original author.
Granger’s logic always did have an annoying tendency to be fairly bulletproof. Draco has a hard time forming a counter-argument; maybe some people already know it too well and therefore wouldn’t learn anything.
“Er…You’re right, actually.” Aside from being one of the only privy to the evil castle conspiracy, Harry’s status as Head Boy hasn’t changed much about how he exists within the walls of Hogwarts. “Luna, has McGonagall told you about…what’s going on?” He gestures vaguely around himself.
Draco clears his throat. “We still need to wait for first years to get sorted,” he says to her evenly.
Harry looks at him for a second, two, three, then shakes his head and sighs, disgusted, disappointed. “Let’s go.”
“I hope we all feel comfortable with disarming and shield charms now, as we’re going to transition into nonverbal casting. I do think things will get a little chaotic here, so you’ve been warned. We’ll start with the right side again, then do the left, and if you still haven’t got it then you each pair can go at their own pace. It’s best if you have the incantation in your head before you even attempt to cast. Let’s line up again, shall we?”
A sound like a trillion stones grinding sends a shockwave through the air, and the castle starts to shake again. Harry knows they should run but he can’t make his legs work. He gets as low to the ground as possible as it quakes, the water rippling. Then, it starts to pull, the second phase of a wave on the beach, sucking sand particles out into the depths. On his hands and knees Harry isn’t nearly submerged enough to be dragged across the floor as the water flows backward, but he still has to fight the reverse current, feet slipping as he almost falls again. Once he has his balance, he lunges out for prone bodies as they drift by, his shoulders and back straining from the effort.
He spends a lot of time thinking about things like that now. About what might have happened had it not been for the war. It doesn’t hurt quite as much as it used to, especially when he considers the way he feels on a regular basis. It’s like the trauma of it all plucked the thing out of his heart that was black and vile. It’s not completely gone, he can tell that much, but most of it is. That’s all he can really ask for.
Hermione is already back in her book; she opens it and lets the cover slam the table as she whips the ribbon out of its place. She provides a single noncommittal grunt and Harry stands across from her for one more tense moment before huffing and turning on his heel.
The return to the Burrow had been a mixture of pungent emotion. Joyful, disappointing, comforting. All of this mixed with Draco’s situation has had Harry on edge since their arrival.
Draco huffs and attempts to regain his composure. Blaise is actively conversing with him. Not typical, but certainly welcome. “We’re friends, right?” Draco asks.
Harry counts off and a symphony of incantations fill the room. Only two wands sail through the air, which either means the shield charms are good or the disarming charms are not. Harry chooses to believe the former having seen the progress made in the previous class.
“So, I’m thinking about asking someone to the Autumn Ball.” He watches Blaise’s face to survey his reaction as he continues. “This person is…male.”
“Of course I don’t fucking believe you. And you knew, too,” Harry says, stepping in and sticking his finger in Draco’s face. Draco has never seen him so enraged, so hurt; his jaw is set, clenched, face red. “You’re not an idiot. You knew that something was going on with me and Leon, right? So what did you expect? You would ask me to be your date and I would just drop him? And then your backup is to accuse him of trying to
“I always suspected that the rivalry between the two of you might blossom into something a bit different. Of course, I also thought it would happen a few years further down the line, but I still do like being proven right,” he says with a wink. “My point is, right now, the connection between the two of you is the only thing keeping Draco safe.”
Ron and Hermione exchange another glance—Harry’s already getting rather tired of that—but say nothing further on the topic.
The beanbag chair materializes beneath him as he slumps down into it. He scrubs both hands over his face, taking a deep breath in and then letting it all out in a vocal representation of his jumbled emotions.
“Is there a problem?” Harry asks after a moment has gone by and the blond has offered no explanation.
Because this could explain why he’s been so willing to rush into things. Draco’s had these feelings building up all along, and now that they’ve slept next to each other, now that their lips have touched, is it possible that all of this is just a conglomerate of Draco’s desire, bouncing off Harry, growing with each kiss, each touch?
“I’m gonna kick your arse at tryouts today, by the way,” Harry says, bumping Draco’s shoulder. He shocks himself a bit, not sure where the sudden appreciation for the other boy has come from. The sense of camaraderie.
to, at least. The plan was for Leon and Harry to have a private study date in Harry’s room and spend some time together even despite both of them having an inordinate amount of work.
Anyway, just wanted to offer a quick thank you to all my readers and the people who have been leaving comments. Believe it or not, a lot of what happens plot-wise is actually a result of taking inspiration from guesses about the plot. Call them self-fulfilling prophecies, lol. Nothing MAJOR, but a lot of the details get filled in based on what people want to see or think they see, so your comments are not only encouraging and lovely, but they literally have helped me develop this story further.
“I think even that’s already changed a lot since the war ended, though. Speaking as someone who’s been on the receiving end of some pretty nasty blood status rhetoric, I do genuinely think that people—yes, even Pure-bloods—are starting to come around and see that it makes absolutely no difference.”
There’s a knock out the door—it’s an annoying habit of Blaise’s, but Draco has also come to appreciate the respect it’s rooted in.
Draco shrugs. “Perhaps he wants to take a more casual approach to our final year.” Highly unlikely; Blaise simply isn’t fond of Slughorn and has been avoiding him.
In silence, the two climb the stairs, feeling not like themselves but in this breath like one self, a singular body, a singular mind, a singular moment of shared trauma that will go unspoken of until a singular decision has been reached.
Harry comes back to Ron when he nudges him in the ribs, then glances downward pointedly. In Ron’s outstretched hand is a flask. Harry chuckles but pushes it back towards him.
Harry steps forward and lays a hand on McGonagall’s shoulder. “What’s going on?” he asks, his voice heavy in his own mouth.
For reasons inexplicable, he had felt a surprising lack of bone-deep loathing upon seeing the messy head of dark hair across the platform. Though maybe the reasons are perfectly explicable. But as he shuffles into the throng of people buzzing with excitement, he finds he’d really rather think about other things. Besides, his arm is suddenly being abducted into the grip of another, startling him. He looks to his right and sees Pansy Parkinson looking at him, clearly amused at his brief fright.
His mother looks between them, exasperated, then jumps up rather suddenly. “If we’re going to have a long chat, we’re going to need tea. Tea?” she asks, gesturing between them.
“Professor, with all due respect,” Draco says, the plan falling together like tracks being laid out in front of a moving train, “I think it might be wise to give everyone some time to recover and reflect. We’re all exhausted and emotionally compromised after what just happened. What if we met tomorrow afternoon instead? It’s a Sunday, after all, so nobody should have any prior commitments.”
Anyway, I don't have a lot of places to share info like this which is why I'm dumping it at the end of a fanfic update lol. Fellow writing nerds will probably understand my excitement though.
Draco wants to smile, but he just nods in return and exhales deeply. Harry slumps into the chair Blaise had been in, still crying.
By some miracle, he manages to guide them around the pit, almost slamming the wall in the process but steering them toward the Entrance Hall. They crash through the enormous hole where the doors used to be and Harry manages to bring them down for a landing; his feet connect with solid ground and Ginny promptly passes out again. Draco is there, catches her and lays her gently on the floor.
As they prepare the beverages, Hermione leans into Harry. “I’ve found something really interesting that I think we should discuss.”
“Everything’s fine,” he lies. “I just want to get away from here for now.” He releases Leon, who in turn alters his step so he’s walking closer to Harry, their fingers brushing as they stride into a lovely afternoon.
“Good, good,” she says, distracted. “Seems like it might be about time for you to be on your way, then.” She looks behind her at the boy on the cot, who Draco notices is now either sleeping or unconscious. “Ah, right, figured it might be best to put him out for a little while. Full-body burns are no fun at all.”
“Say no more,” Mari says, opening the door further and gesturing for him to enter. He gives her a weak smile as he brushes by.
Draco huffs. “I hadn’t gotten that far myself. Pansy, if you’re willing to put everything behind us and try something new—something
Draco hadn’t told anyone what his plans were for this morning. First of all, is that anybody’s business anyway? But second of all, he can’t help but feel a deep-rooted sense of shame about going to talk to some wishy-washy therapist bloke about his damn feelings. The only reason he’s even standing outside a classroom in a typically unused wing of the third floor is because he’s sure McGonagall would find out if he didn’t show up. McGonagall is maybe the last woman Draco would want to cross these days.
And then he almost trips over his own robe when he sees Draco Malfoy standing next to one of the enchanted trees on the side of the stage. He looks bored—upset, even—and when Harry looks closer he sees that, next to his Prefect badge, Draco has one of the little shields that McGonagall handed out to the security task force. It makes enough sense, he supposes, Draco being Prefect and all. And it strikes Harry as unlikely that Draco would’ve asked anybody else, makes something in him leap and hit the ground hard on the way down.
Harry stops him with a kiss of his own, on the mouth this time. Leon tastes like peach and mint and summer nights sitting on a porch.
,” Hermione says with a cautious look in Draco’s direction. He understands. Sure, he’s jealous that Harry is, well,
The Minister of Magic has paid his mother a personal visit? On Draco’s account? “This day just keeps getting better,” he mutters as they make their way to the parlour where Draco is sure his mother is hosting the Minister.
Draco finds himself out on the grounds of Hogwarts, the early September sun warming the cool streaks where tears had been moments prior. Something strange had come over him in that room, something he can’t and doesn’t want to explain. He feels frustrated and trapped, still just
“What exactly happened?” Draco asks. Maybe it’s not his business, but that’s not going to stop him from asking. “With you and…”
gay and that you don’t like him that way. I’ve heard some gay men are rather good at figuring out when other men are gay, even if they’re not explicit about it.”
“Then we have Fabien Arquette from Beauxbatons as Keeper, Ritchie Coote—Gryffindor—and Michael Robertson—Hufflepuff—as Beaters, and that leaves Kim Lassiter—Ravenclaw—and Xander Matthews—Hufflepuff—and finally Eloise Tremblay, also from Beauxbatons, as the three Chasers. Give them a hand, everyone!”
Harry eyes Hermione suspiciously as she leaves the room, giving Ron one last warning to get dressed and come downstairs. He decides that this just must be a side effect of the new developments in their relationship and grabs a comb, heading to the bathroom to see if he can do anything about his hair. He wets the comb but finds that his hair is
Leon nods, finally looking up and smiling at Harry. “I’m sorry for eavesdropping,” he says. “I was going out to go for a walk, and then I heard you talking so I didn’t want to interrupt, but—”
Harry smiles. “No. You’re different. And it scared me that there was this voice telling me that, because…I don’t know, because I hated you for years?”
His office is rather cluttered, books and potion supplies strewn about. Slughorn waves a hand and a collection of empty (but dirty) bottles vacate the chair across from his desk, which Draco then takes. Slughorn squashes down into his own chair; the man actually looks relatively thin. Tired.
too short to really be tamed by it. It still sticks up in the back and he sighs, looking at himself in the mirror.
“Harry has a point,” Hermione says as she bites at the tines of her fork. “Magic is unpredictable. And normal isn’t really in Harry’s wheelhouse, or ours, by extension. Plus, with Beauxbatons being here, things haven’t been normal to being with. No offense,” she says.
“I’m not sure how long I’ll be chained here, but until we figure out what’s waiting for us on the other side, you can still visit. As long as you’re Apparating right inside the house, I don’t think there’s any way for anybody to find out.”
Deep breath. Another. He’s just witnessed something potentially threatening for Hogwarts as an institution. Nothing can be easy, can it?
Harry smiles at this and brushes a tear away. “I think you just said exactly the thing I needed to hear.”
Draco gasps, almost like he’s in pain, but when Harry raises his eyes there doesn’t seem to be any change. Draco is still in front of him, shaking with anger (or fear, Harry can’t tell), his jaw set and his eyes piercing. “You’re Rowan Dorsey.”
Harry rips his hand away. “Whatever,” he mutters. Ron, Hermione, and Leon are standing across the courtyard, pretending they’re not watching the scene. Harry sees through that in an instant and is aware again of his surroundings, the people who actually want to be around him. “Enjoy your afternoon,” he says, surprised that he can even sound so cavalier. “I’ll be in Hogsmeade if you change your mind.”
His stomach turns as he remembers his dream from the night prior, his feet planted, a wave of Fiendfyre nearly crashing over him. There’s no fire here, but instead a feeling that something is utterly incorrect—something is
His breath almost catches in his throat and he can feel desire building in his gut. “Leon,” he breathes. “We really do need to go.”
“I want to go inside,” he finally murmurs, still squinting slightly in the summer sunlight. He can see where his bedroom must have been by the gaping hole in the side of the cottage. He pushes the gate open, the hinges stiff. Probably, nobody has entered since Voldemort himself, all those years ago. There’s an ominous feeling hanging over him and he almost jumps as there’s a sudden movement from behind him. Ron had made to follow him, but Hermione held out her arm to stop him. She glares at Ron, then gives Harry an encouraging nod.
Harry licks his lips. His pulse thumps in his wrists, the underside of his jaw. “We’re sort of…together.”
“How am I supposed to do that when every damned person in this castle either avoids me entirely or takes every opportunity to let me know just how much they hate me?!” Draco looks at her, eyes blazing, breath catching in his throat when he sees disappointment on her face. He takes a deep breath, squeezing his eyes shut. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have yelled. I’m not mad at you, I’m just…”
Mari chuckles. “You’re still a teenager, Draco. I know you’ve seen enough hurt to last a lifetime, but the fact is there’s still so much for you to sort out. Have you had any relationships before?”
I am a few hours late, but technically it's a Thursday until I go to bed, so I'm more or less keeping my promise! Either way, two chapters in two weeks? Very unlike me!
Draco is in the Room of Hidden Things. He’s alone, and he’s running. Looking for something. He can’t quite picture what it is, but he knows that when he sees it everything will make sense, he’ll just
She laughs again and it helps to smooth over the frayed ends of his nerves. “Why don’t you have a seat? I’m more than happy to talk about whatever it is you need to discuss.”
“I know, I thought the same thing at first. But there were, you know, a lot of deaths during the battle, and it became too much of a bother to have to move them the old-fashioned way. So some of the professors managed some really dense magic in order to bypass the limits.”
Draco clears his throat, his cheeks burning. “Harry.” He turns back to McGonagall. “Thank you for everything,” he says as he stands up. “I’ll leave you two to your meeting.”
Harry sniffs. “Well, it worked just fine when I visited at the end of July. I’m under the impression I have to actively do something to lift the ward.”
Harry looks around and sees she’s correct. Blaise nods to Draco as they pass each other. Behind him, Bella Dumont is entering the pitch with Leon by her side.
I would just like to let you know that I’m smiling like an idiot writing this. I know what you mean about things seeming so bleak. It’s overdramatic, but there were so many days when I thought I wouldn’t smile again, and now I can’t stop.
“Oh, I don’t know. You kids always seem to have a better grasp of what’s actually going on at ground level.”
“Are you bloody serious? It’s humiliating! To have Draco goddamn Malfoy talk down to me and offer to share his captain position with me? It’s like some cosmic joke.”
He starts almost every morning by studying his scar. Not because he has any fondness toward it, but because he’s noticed that somehow, it’s started to fade ever so slightly. For the first month at the Burrow he’d been sure it was just a trick of the light, his eyes playing tricks on him, but then the curiosity had gotten the better of him. He’d held an older picture of himself up to the mirror, confirming that it has, in fact, softened just slightly. Not enough to really be noticeable to others, but after seventeen years of seeing it so pronounced, Harry marks a difference.
Harry shrugs. “I can figure something out. It’s possible it won’t even come up until after we’ve cleared your name.”
“Harry! Are you thick?” And there’s Weasley. He peers out across the water, seeing Potter pass the other two and turn around. He stumbles but stays on his feet as they approach. Weasley says something else, Draco can’t hear it this time, and Potter takes off again, causing them both to call his name once more before sprinting after him, back toward the castle.
“I’m so happy for you,” is all Harry can muster. What words are sufficient here? “You’re saying goodbye, I suppose.”
“Alright, you’ll have plenty of time later to ge to know one another. We have other teams to announce!”
Silence falls between them. Draco gets the sense that she’s perfectly comfortable existing in it, but for him it’s just a call back to the heavy silence of Malfoy Manor. It’s this weight that eventually drives him to speak.
So Draco explains. He tells her about the Aurors arriving, his panic, the need to escape. How he worried that his father’s accusations could dredge up even more of the past, that he hadn’t thought about the consequences in the moment. She nods along, her lips pressed into a worried line.
could all be fake and I haven’t even realized? It makes me feel sick. And after what happened with Leon, I don’t think I can do that again. And
A huge cheer erupts from the ground and the people on Denise’s team. Ron looks less than happy, as his team was pulling ahead in points and he had been doing a good job of defending.
Hermione looks up. He can tell she tries to keep her expression neutral, but it looks more like she’s caught a whiff of something unpleasant.
Harry glances around, initially unsure of his location. Everything’s blurry, his vision slowly sliding into focus. There’s another bed next to him; this space isn’t meant for two beds. It’s the same room Draco had stayed in after his first incident with the castle. Madam Pomfrey’s room, really. Harry sits up, heart still jack-rabbiting in his throat as he fumbles his glasses onto his damp face, almost jabbing out an eye in the process.
He sits up, relieved anyway to see that Leon has moved on and is making his way back to the castle as well.
Some emotion displays briefly on Leon’s face, but Harry doesn’t have enough time to decipher it. He sees Hermione give Leon’s arm a little squeeze and he relaxes, glancing quickly at Harry and joining Malfoy towards the back of the room.
,” he screams, over and over. Like a child, he tries to make himself heavy as possible as the Aurors drag him away. He’s vaguely aware of McGonagall crying in the doorway, ushering a stray Ravenclaw away from the scene.
And with that, Luna is gone. Harry exhales deeply, trying to force all of the jitters out his body through his nostrils. There, now someone knows. Nobody else has to be the very first to hear. Granted, Luna had made things rather easy for him. He’ll have to talk to Leon when he gets back about telling people.
“I never said otherwise,” Harry says carefully. “All I meant is that you asked me to tutor you on a specific spell, so it only makes sense that we would be using said spell.”
“I am,” he says. “I can’t lie to you. I shouldn’t. That’s not fair, not when you just…No, Draco, I’m so sorry. I’m gay. I am. But Leon and I are together, and he’s my actual date. I’m going with Luna so we don’t have to come out just yet, but…” He can’t even finish the sentence.
Draco’s eyes widen slightly, mostly because he hadn’t been expecting profanity (not that he’s a stranger to it); mostly, he’s impressed. And nervous. He clears his throat.
use,” Ron adds. “I’m with Hermione here, mate. It's a bit mental to imagine you as a teacher, but it sort of makes sense, too.”
Draco tries to turn and run. His feet are stuck to the floor somehow, and he can feel his muscles straining as he continues to pull and pull and pull, and it’s all he can do not to curse his own feet off his damn legs when he sees a wave of roaring fire explode from the tip of his father’s wand, flaming creatures with horns and teeth and hooves stampeding towards him, Vincent’s screams emanating from their maws. He still can’t move and the horde is approaching, everything around it obliterated by the heat. Draco scrambles for his wand, tries to mutter something—anything—that might protect him from the white-hot onslaught that is only moments from impact, but something is caught in his throat. He slams his eyes shut, bracing for impact as the heat becomes unbearable, the sound of his father’s demented laughter echoing through the flames.
it’s lower level concepts, so you won’t even need to do much prep. Harry, I think you might be overthinking this. You’re a skilled wizard. Didn’t you enjoy leading the DA? Didn’t it feel good knowing you were arming your peers with skills they could actually use?”
. I’m fully aware. I haven’t forgiven him for all of that, if that’s what you’re asking.” Somehow, this lie slips past her radar. Maybe it’s because he isn’t quite sure if it’s a lie himself. He keeps telling Draco that the past is the past, but Harry does have to wonder if some things won’t be forgiven. If they can’t be. Can you still build something on that? Can a friendship be constructed on a partially crumbled foundation?
“I know. Thank you, Harry. But I assured Madame Maxime that her and her students would be safe here, and now this? I’m sorry, you two. You shouldn’t have to see me like this.” She pauses, clutching a hand to her chest. “You may go now. I thank you for your patience.”
The other boy also laughs as he shakes his hand. “I know who you are already, of course! I’m Leon Laurent, it's a pleasure.”
“We’ve talked about this already. I don’t want to get into the past and all of that bullshit. If you think I have some kind of ulterior motive—”
Harry wonders if Draco can feel the pit of dread eating away at Harry’s stomach. On the one hand, so much has come into focus. It’s no surprise that their relationship has kindled so quickly, if this emotional connection really is the case. He thinks on Ron’s point, though, and considers his question. It’s certainly true that Harry had been mentally replacing Leon with Draco, which isn’t something he thinks would be a result of the blood magic link. After all, why would Draco be thinking about kissing himself? (Harry smiles to himself; only a year ago, he might have thought that to be not only possible but probable).
“Bit nervous about him, honestly. He’s the only second year to make it through. Hooch must see something in him, though.”
She nods, looking around. “She’s kept it very plain for a bedroom, but we’re right next to her office at the back of the wing. Now that you mention it, I do have to wonder why she’s isolated you.”
Still, he goes for one last try. “I have all kinds of scars from the war. You’ve just never noticed this one.”
Draco huffs, not impressed by his logic. Ravenclaws are supposed to be intelligent, he thought. “I suppose not,” he says through his teeth, turning away to head toward his room. He blocks out the annoyed muttering behind him as he goes, casting a final sideways glance at the open door and instinctively reaching out for his wand. Just to make sure it’s there.
“How was he able to enter your house when it’s protected by wards that even I would have trouble bypassing? I think you know. Think back to what happened on your eighteenth birthday.”
A suit of armor groans as he passes, startling him. He stops moving, just for a second, taking a deep breath.
Harry yanks his arms out of Draco’s grasp. Slowly, viciously, he says, “I don’t care what you have to say to me. What you’re accusing Leon of…He wouldn’t. You don’t know him, he
before, not on the mouth. There’s no gauge for comparison, but somehow he knows as Harry takes Draco’s top lip between his own two that nobody will ever kiss him like this. Even if the violence of their attraction eventually leads to implosion, as Harry kisses him, kisses him, and kisses him and kisses him, Draco knows it will have been worth it.
Harry is at a loss for words, so instead he just pulls her in for a hug. “I feel the same way about you. You’re…like a sister to me,” he says, feeling a bit odd about his choice of words in this context but embracing it anyway.
Leon takes a deep breath. “Well, there was a lot of chaos that night. So many people were separated from their friends, their loved ones... I thought I was doing the right thing at the time, and I think that means that it
Hogwarts,” Hermione says. “Just ‘purify’ it. Whatever that means. Slytherin supremacy and all that.”
So no. Right now, he just can’t—won’t—go there. He’ll finish his education and tie up his loose ends at Hogwarts. He’ll survive just on the love from his friends. That’s how it’s always been anyway, hasn’t it? Maybe someday, when his name is more of an echo, a fond memory, he can consider it.
Harry sighs. “Fine, I’ll talk to Madam Hooch next time I see her, and we’ll update the team during our next practice. Anything else?”
A few things happen at once. He sees that Draco is up at his level now, continuing his circles. He then looks down for a split second and sees that, in the stands, Leon is sitting down next to Hermione. She hugs him and points up at Harry, who quickly looks away, thrown.
“Must be the lake,” Draco mutters as he shakes his head. Right. Back in second year when Harry and Ron had snuck into the Slytherin Common Room, they’d seen that the room has windows that look directly into the murky green water.
“Heard about Ron, then?” Harry asks. It’s a dangerous game, testing her in this moment, but her lack of civil cooperation is grinding against his nerves. Sure enough, Ginny’s nostrils flare and she presses her lips together.
“As for your recon, I completely understand the rationale behind the desire to have that information going in. I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad idea, but I’m not sure if it’s a reliable plan. If you’re close enough to this person to consider asking them to be your date but you don’t know what their sexuality is, then it’s likely that they’re quite closeted if they
Pansy scoffs. “Why would you even say that? The six of us are here, aren’t we? They won’t just wipe Slytherin off the map.”
“It seems Hermione and I have very different ideas of ‘letting up,’” Ron grumbles, sitting down next to Harry. He yelps when his mother also smacks him.
“Can we just cut the passive-aggressive routine, Pansy? If you knew at all what my summer was like—”
“Of course I do. Events like the ones you’ve endured will inevitably bind people together. Besides, I’ve seen the way the two of you always poked each other between the ribs when you were younger. That kind of fixation is almost always undercut by something else. And after everything that happened with Leon…I don’t blame you, in any case.”
Draco nods. He remembers the odd sense of righteousness that had taken him over, had caused him to take Harry’s side over hers. It was the right thing to do. He’s even more sure of that now. He prepares himself to hear some bollocks excuse from her in an attempt to win him back.
For now, he needs a plan. That’s going to start with some clarification from someone close to Harry. Draco has a very small window of opportunity to get his foot in the door, but he doesn’t want to ask Harry unless he’s absolutely
She’s not really helping with her thinking out loud, if he’s honest. Just reminding him how fucked he is. The Fat Lady is asleep beside them, somehow snoozing despite the racket in the common room. McGonagall must have opened her manually to get inside.
“Oh, yes. Almost a week ago she called me into her office and laid out all of the details. It was right after that Beauxbatons student fell from the vanishing staircase. It’s all so horrible.”
“Not a very good one, I guess.” Draco rolls his eyes as he turns, and then almost bites off the tip of his tongue. He’s been rather focused on the emotional aspect of this connection, honestly. Not that he hasn’t noticed how attractive Harry is. Of course he has. At his core, he’s a hormonal teenager like any other. But seeing Harry without a shirt is like an awakening. He’s thin but solid, tanned skin stretched over the vague shapes of muscles. Something about it makes Draco sad; it’s like looking at a malnourished animal that’s been nursed back to health. He doesn’t know what gives it away, but Harry’s skin looks so fragile, clings so tight to him.
Draco reaches out and brushes the tears away. “I’m sorry,” he says. It’s all he can think to say. He always
Pansy returns eventually, looking more placid but still ruffled. She makes a point to sit as far away from Draco as she can when she enters the compartment. He simply quirks an eyebrow at her and chuckles through his nose, wondering how she can possibly be so childish. The ride is painfully quiet, save for the occasional frantic whispering between Joetta and David.
“I don’t doubt it,” Harry says with a big smile. He pats Ginny on the shoulder and turns, practically bounces back to the Gryffindor table.
Hot tea almost erupts from Draco’s nose. He coughs and excuses himself for a moment while he reigns in his stray bodily functions.
“Harry…” she says. This time her voice is lacking any sympathy or pity. Disgust and shock have roosted instead. “I never would have done any of that research with you if I’d known…”
Harry scoffs. “I said I would try to make sure, but you’ll just have to deal for one more week, I’m afraid. You know, he really isn’t
Everything goes silent, the kind of quiet that stretches out over the water after a storm. It stampedes Harry’s ears, so bleak, so hollow.
Draco sits up, too exhausted to even glare at Blaise. He hopes his eyes aren’t red from crying. He simply nods. “Yes, I knew he was on the run. He has been for months now. But what would you have done in my situation?”
“If everybody else could please step to the edge of the pitch. Watch your heads by the way, easier than sending you up into the stands, though. Alright, positions!”
“Ministry approval is already handled. Kingsley himself has already approved your involvement. I believe you and the Minister know each other fairly well?”
There’s another pang of emotion, of gratitude that his friends understand him enough to know that one of the most comforting things for him is the potential for closure. An opportunity to cut himself deep, right to his heart, finally a clean cut that might be able to heal. His eyes are fixed on the sign that had suddenly appeared, a sign he had read once before:
For a moment Draco thinks she means that, and then she steps in front of him and he can see she’s smiling. She combs his hair down in front of his face and tilts her head.
Draco smiles, his cheeks pink. Harry can’t tell if it’s from the late afternoon sun or…something else.
Voldemort’s. Draco was groomed to be evil, and the fact that he’s changed so much in such a short time speaks to the character at his core,” Harry says surely, trying not to become too passionate. “Did you know he was supposed to be the one who killed Albus Dumbledore? And he couldn’t bring himself to do it?”
Leon’s ears flush. Harry is grateful that he’s not alone in feeling flustered. “I’m happy you were able to come to terms with that. Because when you turned me down, I thought I was a complete idiot and that I scared you off. And now…”
McGonagall nods. “All right, that’s perfectly understandable.” She looks around at the students gathered around her, eyes flitting between Luna and Draco. “And the two of you have the same destination, so nobody will have to walk alone. I think that’s best. Let’s plan to reconvene in my office tomorrow after lunch. I’ll make some tea and we can discuss what you all think is best from a student perspective. Please give it some thought in the meantime. Goodnight to all of you.”
At the end of this row is his father. Lucius shakes his head, a smile on his face. Draco’s already pounding heart slams his ribcage, his pulse prominent in his neck. He tries to swallow down the fear, but his mouth is too dry and it feels like the room is heating up and Lucius is raising his wand, he’s
Harry turns, Hermione and Ron following directly behind him. “I’d rather not say. Plausible deniability and all that, just in case they do show up.”
“I recognize that many of you will not get a chance to play this term, but as I said earlier, there may be more opportunities down the line. I make no promises, of course, but there is always next year as well. For most of you,” she says solemnly.
“Good. Until then—” Harry says and steps toward Draco. He wraps an arm around Draco’s waist and the other cradles the back of his head. Harry tilts his head up and kisses him again.
She looks at him quizzically. “I ran into him after your class today and we got to talking about some things—”
“She’s right, mate,” Ron says and pats Harry on the back. “Even before Dorsey got a hold of him, he wanted to try to make things work.”
Harry blushes, so sure that it wasn’t going to come up. Still, something about Leon’s hesitance to breach the subject is oddly reassuring.
“And you taking his Defense class, surely that was a bluff, right? You haven’t actually gone through with it?”
He hits the library corridor and several heads turn when they see him careening around the corner. He hears a girl actually scream, but swallows down the feelings associated with that because he sees the back of Harry’s head as he goes to enter the library. Luckily, the commotion draws his attention, and when he sees how Draco is shooting down the hallway toward him, he furrows his brows and starts to walk toward Draco. They meet somewhere in the middle and Draco skids to a halt, his hands immediately on his knees as he huffs and puffs.
Kingsley laughs, a deep chuckle. “I daresay he is, yes. Overall, after the initial shock of this, it seems like Draco has everything working for him here. The chances of being punished for these made-up crimes are slim to none, I’d venture.”
Harry's throat tightens. “What are we doing here?” he asks quietly and takes a few steps forward, unable to look at his friends.
He goes for the door and against his better judgement, Draco swiftly follows and physically turns Harry around. He grabs both of his wrists and pleads, “Wait, please, you have to believe me—”
Their laughter is cut short by a disturbance from inside the castle. In the corridor that runs parallel to the courtyard, two Aurors sprint down the hallway, their robes unmistakable, closely followed by a very out of breath McGonagall. The trio exchanges nervous glances and, without another word, follow after.
Draco isn’t even able to run forward to yank the other girl out of harm’s way before she starts wailing, the cries making his blood freeze over. He wants to help, but the last thing he needs is to be found here, now. A quiet escape is in order, he thinks. He can regroup and figure out what to do next, maybe double back and pretend he’s coming to address the screaming.
Harry squeezes his hands into fists, lets them go with a sharp exhale from his nose. “You’re jerking me back and forth here. After our conversation last week you seemed upset, but like you were coming around. And now this? I don’t understand.”
“You see, it’s come to my attention that you already have some experience in teaching this particular subject.”
Harry nods, unable to fight the grin that’s made its way onto his face. The rest of the feast passes with the usual mirth and camaraderie, and a feeling of freedom that Harry wasn’t sure he’d feel again. They poke fun at Neville when he realizes he’s wearing two different kinds of shoes, Hermione rolls her eyes every time Ron attempts to speak with food in his mouth, and Harry manages to avoid eye contact with Ginny the whole evening.
The door closes and tears spring into Harry’s eyes. The last time he spoke to Dumbledore… But of course, his portrait won’t know about that.
“I’m going to talk to Slughorn before this blows up and I have to avoid showing my face for the next week.”
at the Burrow, even temporarily, is an insane thought. But Harry had seemed so hopeful, a child asking their parents if a friend can stay over. If it means spending more time with him, really giving it a shot…He supposes it will take some explaining to his mother, but with everything that’s changed, he can’t imagine she’ll be so opposed as to not let him go. Besides, he’s right on the verge of adulthood. Could she really stop him?
These are the things he considers as he hurries down corridors, his skin prickling all over from the nervous sweat that stubbornly refuses to quit. The biggest problem is his plan. Well, potential plan. It depends how things go, he’s decided. If Harry shows
And this gesture. This moment of contact. What does it mean? Already Draco is analyzing in his head, trying to figure if it’s a mere friendly grab of the shoulder or a way of requesting further contact. It could go either way, he decides. And that’s fine with him, for now. For now.
Harry nods, already wondering what the best method might be. The Ministry must be surveying her closely. Maybe Ron and Hermione will have ideas; Harry is sort of at the end of his intellectual rope.
Ginny avoids Harry’s eye as she drops off her piece of paper, instead focusing on the conversation she’s having with Luna. Harry sighs, not really sure how he’s feeling about
Molly beams at him from the stove. “Good morning, dear. Breakfast will be ready in just a few shakes. I know those house elves keep you fed at Hogwarts, but I wanted you lot to have a real home-cooked meal your first morning back,” she says, her back to Harry and her attention on the meal.
Draco twirls around and starts to pull on clothes, whatever is laying around. He doesn’t usually leave things strewn about, but the last few days have been taxing and tidying up has been low priority. Two different socks—one brown, one black—a pair of jeans, a gray sweater that’s fraying at the end of the right sleeve. He tries to drag a brush through his hair but it’s too tangled (probably the result of tossing and turning), so he gives up and makes for the door.
“I think I may have technically soiled your status as a Pureblood,” he says, the smile fleeing. Potter’s eyes are glued to the floor. “You know, because I had to have so much of our blood mix for the spell to work. I know in terms of bloodline in doesn’t make a difference, but I know there are some cases where something minor like that actually makes a difference…”
Harry picks at one of his nails as she speaks, his foot tapping. “What about you?” he whispers to Luna. “Are you still coming?”
The sentence has barely left Ron’s lips before there’s another crack, causing Harry and Ron to flinch again. Ginny smiles, looking up at George. “Yeah, Georgie, it’s my turn to make these two wet their pants every twenty minutes.”
There had been no destination in mind when he Apparated, so the fact that he’s made it anywhere with all of his extremities is something of a victory.
“You don’t have to start anywhere in particular,” she says quietly. “Healing isn’t linear. Nor is our experience of the world around us. Life is such a complicated thing and sitting around trying to understand all of it—and in order— would just be a waste of our time. We talk about what you feel is important, how it makes you feel and how it affects you, and then talk through and beyond it. I can’t promise I’ll always have the answers, or even that I’ll have them
He slides into a desk, secretly grateful she hasn’t conjured up the same squashy chairs from the other day.
SO. I've noticed that there has been some slight contention in my comments about things in this fic, like people actually acknowledging Draco's misdoings, or characters not caring enough about them. If I'm honest, I haven't read a lot of Drarry fic myself, believe it or not, so I was not aware of the expected dynamics, and even if I was it seems like people are really split on how Draco's character should be handled. I risk sounding a bit rude when I say: if you don't like how I'm writing Draco's arc post-war, maybe choose a different fic! While I appreciate some people reading along even despite disagreeing with the way I'm developing certain things, it seems like my inbox has been littered with negative comments about how other characters interact with Draco, and people are also arguing which is?? Not something I have ever experienced before on one of my fics lol. It's not a problem by any means, but I'm not trying to start any fan wars here!!
“It’s Ginny,” he says, thinking of Mrs. Weasley’s face, of Ron, of what their family has already been through. “We’re not having this argument. I’m getting her the fuck out of there.” Not two seconds later his broom hits his hand and he swings a leg over it. Before he can kick off, Draco grabs his arm.
There’s a knock at the door and Ginny enters before anybody answers. She glances between the three of them, looking confused.
McGonagall’s voice pulls Harry’s attention back and he doesn’t even have time to remember walking into Draco’s room to see him completely shirtless, isn’t willing to think about what effect that moment could have had on subsequent ones regarding other people.
It hurts. It feels like he’s ingested a poison to test it, and he knows the antidote is standing three feet from him but he can’t reach out and drink it. Before he can say anything else, Harry exhales sharply and whips around to return to his friends. Draco now sees that Ron and Hermione are with Leon, all of them looking shellshocked.
There’s a sudden buzz around the Hall as people rise and shake off food-induced drowsiness, led on only by the promise of warm beds and the chance to sleep in. Harry suddenly realizes that he might be expected to escort the Gryffindors, but relaxes when he sees two Gryffindor Prefects—William Ritter and Annabelle Kim, both sixth years—rounding up the first years and showing them the way.
“Professor, if this is about the Head Boy position, I just want to tell you that there’s nothing to worry about,” he says, anticipating the reason for his presence. “I know I seemed reluctant at first, but I really do appreciate the position and intend to uphold it to the best of my abilities.”
“I just wouldn’t even know where to start,” he says, and his heart skips a beat when his voice breaks.
. He made it so I didn’t have a choice, and I was never strong enough to fight him. He almost destroyed my whole life, Harry. My family is in shambles, and I have no idea who I am anymore because my worthless father was grooming me to take his place in whatever twisted world they were planning. None of the friends I had are back, and they weren’t real friends to begin with, and I’m just grasping for
“I’m glad you agree,” Draco says and shifts in his chair. He’s already regretting coming here, just slightly. If he weren’t so prideful, he probably would have gone to McGonagall herself, but he figured it would make more sense to come to his own Head of House first. Besides, he’s supposed to be meeting with her later. He doesn’t want to be a burden given the circumstances.
, Hermione! Why not blast me in the face with cold water instead? Better yet, just roll me right out of bed,” he grumbles.
The rest of the meeting passes with awkward gaps in speech and stilted small talk. Before he leaves, Slughorn reminds Draco to keep his head low and Draco once again confirms that he’s serious about Healing. Though terrified to walk the hallways now that the (false) news about his father has had time to spread, he has no choice but to brave the potential danger in order to return to his room. If Blaise is there, Draco might ask him to bring him some food. Showing face in the Great Hall is a death sentence right now.
Look at me prattling on about myself. Are you sure you want to do this with me? I’ve been told I’m the most self-centered git in the world, especially by people who don’t know the first thing about me. Think I might be starting to believe it.
carried the hurt and the fear. But never had it taken hold of him like this. And never with another to bear witness.
“I’m fine,” he finally says, and Harry relaxes. He nods and licks his lips. Runs a hand through his hair.
“So, for your writing assignment today, I’d like everybody to boil down those happy memories to their most basic components. I’m not asking you to give me personals details about your lives, here. What I want is for all of you to dig even deeper and analyze what about those memories makes you feel happy. What is happiness to you? If you start to think about the emotion on a different level, it will be much easier to bring it to the surface in the rare events that you need to do so.”
He grins and takes her right hand in his left, thankful they’d been taught to dance before the Yule Ball. Or, more accurately, that Hermione had helped him learn last year when they were on the run.

Pansy splutters for a second, her face growing red again. “I have no idea who you even are anymore,” she eventually says. She rises, still looking at Draco, then finally scoffs and leaves, muttering to herself.
