“Malfoy…”
“I’ve been reading. Researching. A lot of things. Not all for classes. Some things about…about my family. Asking questions. There are things I…I don’t understand.”
Dora cringed. The punch line would be terrible. It always was. Kingsley had many talents…but delivering great comedy wasn’t one of them.
As soon as he reaches the table, the woman by his side moves to the far edge and takes the seat to one side of Harry, while the rest of us take our seats now that Sir Dumbledore has taken his own. The hall is full of the sounds of clattering silverware as people make ready, and servers are emerging from the kitchens with platter after platter. His head is already turned to Harry while the food arrives, and I’m amazed by how clear his voice is, even if he sounds tired, the way the very old always do. He could have been an actor on stages with a voice like that, and been heard clearly in the back of any hall anywhere.
Where to begin? No point in doing the whole thing from scratch, so I'm just going to start with the curse. I didn't even know there was one until after it was gone. I just got captured and paid for it with pain. Bellatrix LeStrange could be a right bitch in her way. I wasn't that concerned over it because I'd been captured and tortured before. I've been through worse than she dealt out. All I really remember was a lot of pain. Lots of 'Crucio', 'Crucio', 'Crucio'. She might have been flat out insane, but she wasn't all that creative. Or at least I didn't think she was at the time.
Draco thundered back into being-ness, suddenly aware of a fleshly form after what had felt like an eternity of crackling through layers of reality. Even wrapped in heavily spelled grey robes, including a grey turban, thick gloves and boots, and even goggles that spared his eyes, the physical toll of such travel was daunting. He was flopped on wet grass under moonlight, gasping and retching, desperate to make his limbs move and half blind from agony and exhaustion.
Harry only said one word but he knew Ron would understand "Hermione."
Harry inwardly groaned. He was hoping that Snape would forget but that was wishful thinking.
McGonagall looked as if someone told her that Snape had put on a fake muggle clown costume for Halloween. She quickly snapped out of her surprise and said "Yes Mr Potter, go ahead."
Sweat trickled down Harry’s brow while he woke with a start in the early hours of the morning in Gryffindor tower. He was muttering incoherent words before he could fully grasp where he was, his nightmare still fresh in his mind. He looked around wearily and remembered that he was at Hogwarts in his dorm instead of back in his cupboard under the stairs.
Harry chuckled in amusement since that would probably be the closest sort of compliment he would get from the pureblood.
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry said quietly but his voice thick with emotion.
" Do any of you know what house you'll be in? I asked around on the train and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best, I heard that Dumbledore himself was one, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad." Ron rolled his eyes at that last statement.
Chapter 4: A snarky professor
"Ah, yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new—celebrity."
Draco smirked slightly and said, “They are the same plant and also known as aconite.”
H.J.P
“So, spill!” Millie demanded.
Unlike Ron, Harry wasn't very excited for the feast, since he still couldn't digest as much food as everyone without it coming back up. He was also a bit numb because Halloween brought back bad memories that he would rather forget.
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
“Where are you going, Drake? Don’t leave me and finish this by myself.” Pansy cried out.
Charms classroom
“Purr-lease. You stuck your head around the corner for a second. Anyone could spot that unnaturally blonde hair from a mile away.” Harry teased playfully.
“So I guess you will want details on what occurred on Halloween. Correct?” Harry asked, getting straight to the point.
“I hope we don't have a potion lesson today, my brothers told me that Snape can be a real git to us Gryffindors,” Ron stated before saying “Look at him now.”
Suddenly the castle melted from his view and was replaced by the parlour at the Dursley residence. Harry could feel the blood draining from his face as he realised what memory had engulfed his mind. Before him, he could see himself at the age of 7 beside a large Christmas tree with his cousin Dudley. He had gotten nothing but a pair of old socks whereas Dudley had a massive pile of gifts. His cousin was holding a wooden bat that he had just unwrapped and started to repeatedly hit his younger self with his new bat, while his uncle just watched with an evil grin as he quietly whimpered from the pain.
Harry was sitting with Ron, who was eager to stuff himself with sweets.
Draco eyed Harry warily and began slowly “I think you're doing the right thing by being cautious. You could be on to something but the question is what is his motive?”
A young boy with slicked-back blond hair was at Madam Malkin’s one day getting measured for robes when he started at Hogwarts in September, a magical school for wizards and witches alike. To say he was bored, would be an understatement. The boy was more excited to finally receive his own wand that he could use at Hogwarts than standing around in a robe shop. His thoughts were soon interrupted by the small clink of the bell on the opening door. He glanced over to find a small raven haired boy with tattered glasses that had seen better days. The raven haired boy shuffled over to the small stool next to the blond waiting for Madam Malkin to finish with himself.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wood’s face brightened when he fully understood what she said but asked doubtfully “This is not just some cruel joke to tell me to hurry up and choose a seeker is it?”
Onwards to the next chapter.
Harry and his friends swivelled round in their seats to face them. “You're braver now that you're back on the ground Malfoy.”
Soon the next morning came and Ron and Harry bid farewell to Hermione, with a promise to continue their research. Harry also gave a sneaky glance at Draco's way and gave him a quick smile and to Harry's delight, his friend smiled back with a small wink. So with that, Harry watched his two friends board the steam train and with Ron, they watched the train until it was all but a speck in the distance.
“Oh yes. Go complain to your daddy dearest. He’ll make all problems disappear in a click of his fingers for his baby.”
Harry slowly raised his hand in the air, he couldn't even remember the last time he raised it willing to answer or even ask a question. He was already having regrets but it was too late to back out now. This was his first step forward into achieving better marks. Participate more then improve his written theory. Either way, his guardians would not find out. He was not be stupid enough to go looking for punishment.
Harry scoffed mentally. They were the same plant. “I don't know.”
"A Nimbus two-thousand, sir and it's thanks to Malfoy here that I have it," Harry said, who was having a hard time not letting a smirk be shown on his face.
Madam Hooch bent over Neville, quickly accessing his injuries, ignoring how Neville’s broom slowly floated towards the forbidden forest and out of sight.
“If you want,” Harry said quietly and Draco did just that.
A smarter hat than me.
The Slytherin team were brutal to the Gryffindors but the Gryffindors fought back just as hard. Creating many fouls and penalties for each team's chasers. Draco spotted Harry and Higgs lazily circling the pitch for the snitch. Despite loving quidditch, he didn't want the game to go on and on since it was freezing in the chilly wind, so he hoped Higgs caught it reasonably soon. It was then when Harry and Higgs suddenly dived towards the snitch.
Quickly everyone scooped up their processions and left. Harry just wanted to roll his eyes at his classmates as he walked with Ron to the tower, they could be so daft sometimes.
"Yeah."
If both pairs knew they would definitely be blushing, it's a shame no one owned a camera.
Percy, Ron's older brother who loves to boss everyone around, immediately directed the house out of the hall. Harry could tell he loved every second of it.
But Neville, who had been nervous all morning, kicked off hard before the whistle blew. “Come back, boy.” Madam Hooch shouted but Neville continued to rise high into the sky. 12 feet—18 feet. Harry could see even from the ground even with his terrible vision that Neville’s face was turning as pale as a banshee. Before Hooch could fly up to help Neville, he swayed and slipped sideways off his broom. As Neville slammed onto the ground, a clean crack was heard.
After dinner had come and gone, Draco found himself by the Black Lake. It was a quiet evening despite it still being light, the surface of the lake gently rippled as the cool breeze came. It was the peacefulness that surrounded him that drove him out from the castle.
Harry was content with his detention. He found cleaning therapeutic and helped to distract him from troubling thoughts. Despite being treated like a slave and being to cook, clean and what not he still enjoyed it but he hated cleaning at the Dursleys because of how he was punished if there was one tiny mark left. He shuddered involuntarily and resumed scrubbing.
"I see," McGonagall said. "Well Miss Granger, you can't just go and disregard direct orders from your teachers. I expected better, from you especially. 5 points will be taken. If you don't require medical assistance, I recommend you head back to your common room where the rest of the house is finishing the feast."
Had Draco planned that or was that purely accidental?
“And?”
"Abott, Hannah."
Blaise eyed him curiously before walking towards the board, muttering under his breath as he observed his options.
“Look Draco, I know you had something important to tell me but I found out a few things I wanted to tell you first.”
“We’ll tell you and others when we get back to the common room,” Blaise said while putting food on his plate. Draco followed suit quickly but was worried that Harry might get expelled because of the flying incident and possibly getting caught after curfew. If it did happen, he knew that it would be all his fault and that didn't sit well with him.
“Oh just let the poor man finish,” Theo said, getting annoyed. All the girls laughed as Pansy threw hands up in the air and crossed them, sitting back with a scowl on her face.
“Will do.”
if you've a ready mind,
Harry's shoulders slumped in relief as he said "Good it's just you."
“I think you're right..”
Draco gulped worriedly. “You see my family are purebloods and my father thinks anyone that isn’t a pureblood is dirt on his shoe. Especially muggles and muggleborns. I don’t follow those values and neither does my mother but we have to pretend to so we satisfy my father. While at Hogwarts I wanted to start making my own friends, starting with you since you're a half-blood but your Harry Potter and the boy who lived.” Draco paused, worried that he might scare Harry even more after revealing this next piece of information but continued. “My father was a death eater and death eaters back in the first wizarding war were followers of the Dark Lord who killed your parents.” Draco finished.
And in the silence of his heart, while he feasted beside the people he loved most dearly, Draco offered his private thanks to a man who didn't exist and never would. Right or wrong, moral or immoral, he'd been given some heaven sent second chance at happiness, and he'd since lived a life so wondrous that he could scarcely accept that it was his own and not some illusory dream. However it had come to pass, Draco loved this life, the man by his side, the son they had raised, and the friends they had gathered about them through the years...with a passion that was unfeigned and undiluted after decades. All that the man in grey had asked of him and wished for him had come to pass, and if some shade of that tormented man existed, Draco hoped that it knew its actions weren't in vain.
Big Chicago part 20...by Samayel
With the approach of their NEWTS, both boys were under pressure to study their books more than their bodies, and it was getting difficult in the extreme just to meet at night.
Caramels, interestingly enough, aren’t all that bad for you, especially if they’re few in number. In this case, there are precisely four, but each one is a hand made masterpiece. These four little jewels of flavor cost approximately as much as a good pair of shoes. The smattering of sea salt across the top adds the final touch. When it melts in your mouth, sharp against the softness of the caramel, salty and sweet at the same time, it’s just pure heaven. Thank you, Harry. There’s a man who knows how to satisfy his lover…even from a distance!
Either way, I won’t be traipsing back through to take care of you, so at least take some care of yourself! Do try not to let the rest of the world in on the pathetic display I’ve been subjected to.
I want Harry. I want him so badly that I feel like I’ll die if I can’t have him for my own. It’s sickening, but it’s true. He’d know. He’s smart. He’ll figure it out. The chemical taste on my breath, or a stray fleck of white crystal on my nostril. Maybe he’d sense the sudden tension, or the nervous edge of my voice. He’d know…and he would be angry. The rules included no drugs in his house. I could do it here, now, and say it was just a hit with Pans for old times. I open the cap. The faint scent is as intoxicating as I remember. Chemical mind-spice to scour away the ugly edges of reality.
“Parseltongue.”
The Echoes Of Yesterday...by Samayel
Draco bit his tongue. It didn’t seem likely that he’d gain any ground by offering complaints. Prewett really didn’t seem like the type to back down without just cause, and Draco had agreed to any punishment Hogwarts mandated for him. He wasn’t prepared to look a coward after having been given a remarkable chance to set things right…no matter how daunting the task in front of him might be.
“This is complete bullshit, Fletcher! You’re telling me you’ve got nothing? Not one damn thing? Remember…you owe me, and I can drop a dime and see your ass fired in a heartbeat!”
Draco was smiling. “You really are. I missed you, Harry. Rather more than is entirely comfortable to admit.”
John Prewett might be helping Harry along the way, but perhaps with John’s advice to soothe his own tired and frayed nerves, Harry could bring the young man to open up a bit more. There had to be a way to make this work…and Harry meant to find it.
It isn’t the same, having at it this way, wishing for something more tangible, but it has to do, and it gets results quickly enough. The embarrassing part is that when I get a little sense back in my head, I realize that I’ve just come all over myself and I haven’t even got a towel handy. The bedspread is fucking thousand count Egyptian cotton for Christ’s sake! Only a heathen tramp would trail spunk all over it. I haul myself to the bathroom and clean myself up, then flop back onto the bed and collapse into a heap.
Harry puts the chair down beside the bed, and this Doctor Snape starts laying out things I recognize on the nightstand. Blood pressure, and glucose testers, vials, syringes, something like litmus papers for simple blood tests. A small, portable microscope and more.
On TV, bless their fucking hearts, every cop solved the case in forty eight minutes, fostering the cheery illusion that crime was always committed by mildly retarded or otherwise fatally flawed losers. There was always a smoking gun or a witness that came forward, or the criminal would crack under questioning and tell all, always in dramatic fashion. This kind of thing made it hard to convince people that actual police work involved endless interviews, mountains of paperwork, and weeks of sifting through seemingly inconsistent information. The public clamored for a fast answer and high profile dramatic arrests…but when those happened in real life, it usually meant that the arrest had been hurried to appease the masses, and the person charged would get off on a technicality, and that was assuming that they’d even hauled in the right suspect in the first place!
TBC!!!
He’d loved the feeling of warm skin so tight and close against his own, the soft puffs of Malfoy’s breath against the back of his neck, and the dizzying sensations that came from knowing that Draco’s cock was pulsing so hard that he could feel Draco’s heartbeat through it even against the cleft of his backside.
Draco took a deep breath and calmed himself. “For the record…I was drinking almost from the time I came home early from work. My house-elves can attest to that. Perhaps a little after five o’clock I Apparated to Harry’s apartment, with the intention of apologizing for my conduct at the Charitable Ball two weeks ago. An apology that was long overdue, by the way. Harry wasn’t in, and I fell asleep on the couch waiting for him. I woke up with a terrible hangover, and we were just having coffee and making peace. Then you knocked, and here we are.”
It was just impossible. He couldn't deal with this…not and quit drinking at the same time. Actually, not at any time! It was Draco's bloody son! It was uncomfortably like staring into the Mirror Of Erised, except that Harry saw both his dreams and his nightmares at the same time. The very notion of working closely with the heir of the Malfoy family was ludicrous. He'd have to tell Minerva something. Fifteen years of secrets, and they were quickly crashing down around his ears in a single day! Footsteps were coming his way, and it meant that Minerva was on her way back. Harry crushed his eyes shut and blurted out an apology.
Some parts we just can’t speak of here, and that’s good enough for me. A window into who Harry really is…that’s good enough for me…even if it’s a little cloudy. Harry is twenty four years old. The same age as me. Our birthdays are about a month apart. It’s strange, because he seems so much older. Maybe I do too. I guess it’s the things we’ve done…not the time we’ve had, that make the difference.
“Nothing personal. I’m a messenger…you’re just the message…but the fact that you‘re a piece of shit makes this a lot easier.”
The buzz of her cellphone interrupts us, and I’ve learned to dread cellphones buzzing here. She flips the thing open and answers hurriedly, suddenly as serious as a heart attack.
Snape’s hand feels like a vice on my wrist, makes my whole arm scream when he yanks it as we run. He really did it. He killed Dumbledore. He did the task I was set to, signed my death warrant, and now he’s carrying me along to my own funeral.
Harry could have walked away. That was what made it a tragedy. At every step along the way, he could have turned his back or forced Draco’s hand. There wasn’t one act he’d been forced into, it had all been of Harry’s choosing. Even the last of it, no matter how much it shamed him to admit it.
Ron looked up when the monotone answer began, expecting it to be some kind of sass. It took a few seconds before he realized that the syllabus was being recited, verbally…from memory, in its entirety.
It was surprising how liberating a moment like that could be. Harry spilled the worst of it, and things had slipped from his mouth that he hadn’t spoken of in almost two decades. Minerva took it all quite well. She was a good friend of many years, and she’d watched the quiet gentleman she knew so well grow from a nervous boy into a decent and capable man. It was a bit of a shock to her system, learning so suddenly that Harry was not only gay, but had remained celibate since the day Draco had left him, and that he’d carried the guilt of several murders with him since he’d quit the Auror service. For the most part, Harry reiterated his inability to cope with seeing the face of the new Lord Malfoy. The thought of seeing that face, lips curled in an arrogant smirk that echoed through decades, filled him with a terror and apprehension he couldn’t even begin to describe.
But Dreamless Sleep had its price.
The Echoes Of Yesterday....by Samayel
Some people come back here again and again. They need this place because they don’t fit in anywhere else. I have two months to go, but the question is where will I go in two months?
I can breathe a little better. Enough to sit up, but it helps if I lay my head against the bedpost. Peel off socks and slacks. Ditch the nice shirt. Ugh. There are tears and snot and a little puke near the collar. Not really ready for walking just yet.
It was three days of suddenly realizing that something you want is out of your grasp. Three days of restless sleep and constantly wondering if he'd show back up. I...I...Granger...I NEEDED him. I went through a lot of effort to make him mine, my plaything, my comfort, my pleasure...and I've never put that kind of effort forth for anything. I prized him above any wealth I've ever possessed, any thing or person I've ever known.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Harry sat bolt upright in the bath, unconsciously gasping in surprise.
“Draco. He loves you, too. At least he says he does. I suppose I believe it now. You ought to know…no matter what happens, Harry will remember everything as special just because it was with you. You don’t have to do all that.”
I have to hand it to him for those last weeks. I don't know where he found the energy to keep me that distracted. For a guy who doesn't work out to have that natural level of energy is just uncanny. I'm usually too arse-tired to do more than suck up caffeine in the morning. At least I've quit smoking...and the maddening thing is that was harder than skag to quit! At least the heroin was out of my system by the time St. Mungo's got done with me...but the cigarettes haunted my dreams for weeks!
“I only…”
“Okay.“ That’s about all I can handle saying at the moment. I don’t really want to touch off another crying jag, and I feel dangerously close to it still. The bath is only medium warm, meant to soothe rather than clean, and it looks and smells like he poured in sea salts and a few other things to scent the bath nicely. It does smell relaxing in here. Invigorating.
“You don’t owe me anything, it’s because of you I survived the battle, thank you.”
Harry’s mind drifted off to holding a certain blonde’s hand before he finally succumbed to sleep.
Olive handed a dossier to Kingsley and sat, shooting a friendly smile at the trio. Kingsley continued, “I really shouldn’t be doing this but..” he trailed off and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Felide, I’m going to send you to Azkaban on some ‘official business’ and I’m going to allow two of you to go with, obviously that will be you Hermione. we’ll say that you wanted to try your hand at this department again and Harry, I’ll send you, make up some story about the saviour interning or something at the DMLE. I’m sorry Ron, it will look too suspicious if I send you in too, everybody understand?”
Draco’s mind was racing, Potter was writing to him? And sending secret letters to him? And checking in on his mother? And telling him about his personal life? It felt as though they were almost old acquaintances and Draco almost… craved… that? No, that was absurd, the lack of other human connection and communication was definitely to blame for these peculiar feelings.
"HUFFLEPUFF."
On the outside, anyone could see that Harry was uncomfortable but on the inside, he was having a mini panic attack. He couldn't exactly just say that his uncle would beat him if he got good grades. Who knows what his reaction would be. No, Harry knew that it would be safer if he just lied but a good lie contains a grain of truth.
“But what has changed this year,” Daphne interjected.
Both Harry and Ron were relieved and moved to make their way out when a silky voice stopped them. "Not so fast boys. Might I remind you that you both have a detention to attend to."
Pansy had been grumbling for half an hour since Draco had forced her to come and study with him in the library. Draco continued to ignore her theatrics and concentrated on finishing his damn History of Magic essay.
Snape was quiet before replying. "Then go."
Harry was exhausted, not only from their Quidditch match earlier but also from his housemates. He was constantly getting clapped on the back because of their victory but Harry was not used to any positive kind of touch, so he was flinching left and right. He tried his hardest to move away but most people didn't even notice his distress and had continued to make him feel uneasy.
Your top hats sleek and tall,
Harry thought Ron's opinion was a bit biased considering his family, so he kept his mouth shut from remarking.
The small boy shifted under Draco’s gaze but soon shook his hand and said in a quiet voice “ Harry, my name is Harry.”
As the door swung open, they were presented with a tall, grey haired witch who wore emerald green robes. She had a stern look on her face as she introduced herself as Professor McGonagall the Deputy Headmistress and led them to a small chamber across from a door where it sounded like the rest of the school was. She gave a short speech about the sorting and the different houses before she left to enter the hall.
Soon everyone was finishing up and leaving the hall with their friends in tow. Draco got to his feet when he saw Harry leaving the hall. Draco strolled past his friends and weaved around many people before he was practically behind his friend.
“Um... Charms and Defence sound interesting. Transfiguration too but I also like the sound of flying but I’ve never been on a broom before.” Harry replied hesitantly.
Harry knew that he should tell a teacher instead of running to save Hermione from a troll that would be three times their size but he didn't trust adults. So he nodded reluctantly and the pair raced down a corridor to the nearest bathroom.
He grabbed his potion textbook and silently slipped out of the room. The fire in the common room was still roaring despite no one else being there so he settled on a plush maroon armchair close to the flames to read his textbook.
As the city turned into rolling hills and the sun began to set, both boys grabbed out their robes and turned around so they could give each other some privacy to get changed. As they sat down, Harry ran his fingers through his hair, brushing aside his fringe in the process. Draco froze, as his eyes landed on the lightning shaped scar that sat predominately on Harry’s forehead.
Hermione hung her head low, her bushy hair covering her face as she left. Harry felt bad since she wasn't used to being told off but was glad for her helping them out.
Before it could spot them, they slipped into a shadowy alcove. The troll was about 10 feet tall and was holding a wooden bat as he approached an open door, the girls' bathroom but it looked like only Harry realised that since Ron said "Why don't we just lock it in?"
“What so bad about what?” Theo asked, turning his attention to both Blaise and Draco.
As soon as Uncle Vernon pulled into the train station on the first of September, Harry quickly got his stuff and bolted out of sight before Vernon could stop him. Ever since Harry woke at 5 in the morning, he counted down the seconds until he could leave behind his Aunt and Uncle’s wrath for a year. A whole year! Although his excitement ran short when he realised there was no platform 9 and ¾.
Harry held up the book cover to show him then marked his place and set it aside.
The hall erupted into panic and screams. After the headmaster eventually silenced everyone with a few loud bangs out of his wand he spoke "Prefects will escort their house to the dormitories at once!"
“Remember, just walk straight at the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. Go on Ron, quickly now.” Said the mother.
“Why?” Pansy asked.
More and more people came for breakfast as 8 o'clock rolled around and Harry soon found himself sitting with Ron and Hermione. He pushed his food around on his plate while they talked about what classes they might have today.
A/N Hey there peeps! My two week break is coming up soon which means I'll have more time to write. Sorry for the wait but enjoy the chapter!
“Oh, just Malfoy being his jerk-like self as always. Making fun of how I almost fell off my broom.” He quickly made up.
“Never - in all my time at Hogwarts-” Professor McGonagall was lost for words from shock and her eyes flashed dangerously. “-how dare you - might have broken your neck -” Some of his fellow Gryffindors tried to tell McGonagall what happened but she just cut off their protests. “Potter, follow me, now.”
As the train began to slow, the boys had drifted onto other topics as they had already planned as much as they could for the moment. Draco then started to ask questions about Harry’s family but did file away in his head how Harry avoided revealing certain points about them and distracted him by asking questions, which was Draco’s weak spot, as he liked to show off his knowledge.
Ron looked around until he locked eyes on the old bat lying a few feet away. Then it came to him. He ran forward and grasped the bat with two hands. It was heavy but he managed to heave it up into the air regardless.
If anyone knew Professor Snape, they would know that he kept his promises but would he go too far before he could realise how different Harry was from his father in more ways than one.
“I can assure you this is not a joke.” She said. “He is a natural, was that the first time on a broom Potter?” Harry slowly nodded his head, he knew that first years couldn't play on their house team but she sounded like she was ignoring that. “He dived about 50 feet and caught that-” She pointed at the Remembrall in his hand. “-and didn't have a scratch on him. Even Charlie Weasley couldn't do that.”
And I can cap them all.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry said as he closed the door.
Everything was going good, well as good as it could be in a quidditch game when something strange started to occur on the pitch.
The Sorting Hat can't see,
Draco pretended to be insulted and said outrageously "Just me! I'm Draco Abraxas Malfoy, I thought you would be glad to see me."
McLaggen was one year above Harry but unlike the majority of their house, he loathed Harry. He had blond curly hair and walked around with his mates with a swagger, basically voicing he thought he was better than everyone else. Harry never really had any reason to interact with Mclaggen but he often heard McLaggen whispering snide comments about him to his friends. Harry wasn't sure why he disliked him but Harry couldn't care less since he didn't outright bully him like most of the Slytherins and his cousin. So Harry for the most part just ignored Mclaggen and his rude comments.
Harry blushed slightly and Ron stepped forwards towards Draco and said “Sod off Malfoy.”
As they left through the doors of the Great Hall, Harry piped up “I’m going to go for a walk. I’ll meet you back in the common room so we can complete that DADA essay.”
I’ve always used what I am…what I can offer…to get what I want. Even with you. I could taste freedom on you. Safety. Something better. I use sex for everything. For gain. For solace. To remember. To forget. I just thought…I thought you should know what isn’t in the files. You should know what I hate…about me. There aren’t that many reasons to believe me, Harry…but I won’t play you. I love you…like no one…and nothing else I‘ve ever known.”
Draco’s gaze was full of questions, and his brow wrinkled with concentration as he tried to puzzle out where Harry was going with this. Harry kept going, approaching the topic he knew was more taboo than any other.
Harry’s in the bathroom, and I can hear him pissing while he yawns. Not because we’ve been sleeping, but because I’ve been deliberately exhausting him. I’m just laying here, facedown, sticky and lazy, halfway to satiation and loving the soft burn that warms my backside. He’s come three times, always inside of me, and I had my turn in the bathroom awhile ago. My last few orgasms have all been of the internal variety, prostate stimulated until I’m screaming out for God, but I’m already in my god’s arms. I think I’m actually ready to come the traditional way again. Just the lazy thought of his mouth around my cock is enough to make me roll over and stroke myself the rest of the way to hardness, letting finders slip down to the slick place below, brushing softly against the sullen, bruised place that wait for his return. I feel high, giddy and delirious. So happy. In a minute he’ll be back, and we’ll…
“Alright. No standing on ceremony. Next time I’m in this part of the world, I’ll bring my real wardrobe, but I might as well warn you…by then…we might need another plane to haul it!”
“What about piss ignorant?”
Nice. Plush. Tasteful. Daddy probably wishes he had an office this classy. Old world class, not modern. Everything in here is antique, except for the computer, fax/modem, scanner, printer and other techno goodies. I can hear Bach playing somewhere. He must have a good sound system wired in here where it can’t be seen. I take a seat across the desk from the old man, and he just smiles while he reaches for a glass dish of candies, smiling like a kid when he holds the dish out to me, blue eyes still twinkling like before.
The Echoes Of Yesterday…by Samayel
Mmmm. God, I’m like an alley cat in heat when I get like this! He’s still breathing those soft, even breaths just behind my ear, blissfully asleep, and all I can think of is how good it feels to rub back against that heat and stiffness inside his boxers. I haven’t even moved his arm, my briefs are shoved down to just above my knees, and the sensation of his boxer-wrapped dick rubbing between the cheeks of my ass is unbearable. It isn’t enough! I mean, it’s supposed to be about Harry today, but I’m kinda having more of a ‘me-centric’ moment here.
When the last of his ‘children’ were watered and spoken to, (Neville believed in talking to his plants…not because they answered back or anything daft like that, but because studies had shown conclusively that they responded to pleasant stimuli, and it was worth the effort to him just to see them grow just a little stronger and healthier.) Neville washed his hands and made ready for the trip to work.
They were back in the halls and headed for the front entrance before Dora slowed her pace enough to speak calmly again. It was a good thing Kingsley had long legs and endless patience.
Economics really does bore me to death. My eyes are sagging before I get through a single chapter. The day ends as quietly as it began. I’m going to have to find more to occupy my time than this or I’ll go crazy. At least the perpetual fear I experienced in prison made time seem to blur. Here, without Harry, I feel the emptiness so acutely that I’m not sure I could cope with it without Maria and Therese. Tomorrow…definitely getting out tomorrow.
Draco wriggled pleasantly in Harry’s arms, then yawned and stretched.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Draco is dealing with Harry's absence poorly, and Harry isn't happy either, but Harry finds a way to get just a little closer to Draco. SIXTH IN THE HEAT! SERIES (now with new added Parseltongue!)
That jerk! Self-indulgent! Just because the last seven years have been complete shit and I wanted a pizza and a cocktail now and then? Argh! I could just spit! Then I remember that the boss is still talking.
Memories of Draco weren’t gone. Quite the contrary, they were with him all the time. When he woke, when he showered, while he dressed, and even while he ate what the elves brought for him. These were memories he had, and could continue, to live with. Something missing from him had come back after all these years. Resignation perhaps? There hadn’t been much to do lately but think of the past, and he’d thought of more than just Grimmauld Place these past few days.
“Tell it again. From the top. The whole story.” Kingsley’s voice was a soft rumble, calm in the face of the annoying little man they were questioning.
“Yeah, yeah. You guys and your lesbian fantasies. Let’s go. Maybe we won’t be the ones who break this wide open, but it won’t be because we didn’t try.”
There was nothing for it. Tonight, like every bloody night before it, he would dream of what he couldn’t see in the living world, and he would wake with tear stained cheeks to memories of what was gone. That was just the way of it, and even whiskey couldn’t really make that go away. Harry found his bed and closed his eyes once again, dread fluttering in his stomach. Perhaps he’d wake tired, or wake early, or wake sharply and full of the tangible sense of aloneness, but by God…he would wake sober.
I can’t help looking at him at breakfast. The look on my face must be like murder. I wish someone would just kill him now and make the potential problems go away. No one does. The fucker stares down the first person to even hint at giving him grief. Those fucking eyes! People know he’s serious, but quiet, with danger just beneath the surface, waiting to explode. The other guy backs down. A point for Green-Eyes, but that kind of shit just piques Flint’s interest. Eyes and attitude don’t scare Flint. Nothing does. He lives up to his name. He’s a rock, and nothing can scare a rock. It’ll really be between the two of them, and Flint always wins. Always. At least…he’d better. I don’t want this. I want to be somewhere else, but there’s nowhere else to go. That’s why they call it prison. I have to watch this insanity unfold. I hate him. If a look could kill, his ass would be dead and buried.
Those first days before Draco’s schooling began in earnest were quite pleasant. Harry only really saw Draco at breakfast, seated quietly at a table near the back of the room, and on two occasions in the library. When Monday came around, Harry would begin tutoring, and he was thankful for the time to build a suitable curriculum for his protégé.
Harry had abandoned Dreamless Sleep potions years ago. It was difficult to brew, as well as expensive, but that didn’t matter. There were side effects that kicked in after a couple of weeks. Those who craved peaceful rest quickly found themselves unable to cope with their routinely disturbed normal sleep, and abused the powerful potion to achieve slumber untroubled by harsh dreams and memories. The mind was never intended to go without dreams, and this quickly created problems.
“Very much so. I can’t say this will be easy, but I can say with a certain confidence that I think the Ministry is worried without good cause. He doesn’t really seem any more rash or hasty than other people his age, and the insolence and arrogance we were concerned over seem to be the result of intellectual isolation. I imagine it would be hard to fit in with other children with a mind like his. Shades of Hermione back in the day. I’m a little concerned with his poor control of his temperament and his sharp tongue, which I expect we’ll see again before the year is done, but other than that, I think he’ll be a remarkable student and a credit to whatever endeavor he chooses to undertake as an adult.”
Harry’s backside was liberally drenched in saliva, and Draco was keenly aware of his own burgeoning need for relief. He almost couldn’t believe what he’d just done, except that, as soon as he’d stopped, Harry had collapsed into a boneless and gasping heap, muttering praise beneath desperate breaths. When Harry finally opened his eyes, Draco was making use of his wand with a discreet Lubricus.
I’m so giddy. Almost high. His words feel that good to me. I’m so insecure…so pathetically in need of approval. Logically I know this, and I can look at myself with honesty and know this to be true, but I can’t change it easily. I still feel my heart skip a beat when he makes it clear that he cares and reminds me that I matter. Even when I’ve done something that may not have pleased him, he’s so patient and good and worried about me. Me!
“Then watch me. Or send others. I am who I am. I’ve done what I’ve done. The past is already written, but I’m not just some collection of things already done. I want so much…to leave all of that behind and be who I’ve always wanted. Everything where I come from is a filthy swamp of deceit and desperate scrambles for survival. Can you imagine what it’s like? To guard yourself constantly, to feign indifference when your heart is screaming out for something more, something decent and right? I’ve done terrible things just to make my way, and they shaped me into someone even I despise. If I prove myself to you, if I show who I am on the inside, show who I want to be, would there be a place beside you for me? Would I have a reason to…to even hope that someday I’d be worthy of you?”
First, he discovered that the taste and scent of Harry actually made him hungry for more. Then he found out that Harry, whose mouth had generally been busy before, was quite noisy when unoccupied. Last, it took very little work to make Harry come, which was something he was used to, but when his boyfriend did come, from this new position, it seemed like a great deal more fluid was involved than he had previously imagined. It took a fair amount of practice before he could time himself to swallow as it came, and didn’t wind up gasping for air as the excess ran down his chin.
Only the mildest parts of all this get mentioned at first, but after everyone is assembled, cheerily chatting about nearly everything but business, Harry nods to Dean. Dean places a rather plain metallic box on the counter and pushes its one button. The faintest whine is audible, as if a satellite is being tracked by a dish antenna somewhere near. A very soft buzz is coming from the box itself. Dean breaks the silence by addressing me directly, answering the question I refused to ask so that I wouldn’t seem as ignorant about this as I am.
"On your head be it. I...I can do it...when I start chanting...break the spells...you already know what to do when he comes to." She walked away breathing deeply, trying to focus her mind for the ritual. Despite all she'd ever thought of Draco Malfoy, against all odds, he was right and she knew it. "Hang him over the cross...that's where we found him when we broke in here back then."
He couldn’t remember falling asleep. It just happened at some point. A little too much tension had slid away, and without that nervous energy, he’d relaxed enough to drift into a light doze, colored by dreams of kisses and soft dark skin that felt like heaven next to his own.
Harry sensed the desperation, and raised his final shield, one learned only by Aurors, which was quite nearly impermeable. Draco’s spells deflected helplessly off of it, setting off a frenzy of black and horrible curses, all Dark or at least dangerous, but none Unforgivable for an adult wizard in a formal duel. Each shattered against Harry’s cone of golden light while Harry prepared his final attack in perfect calm.
"Son-of-a...never...trusted you...fuggin' bastard! Wha...what did you...do?" The green eyes suddenly snapped sharp and clear when Harry tried to make use of his wandless magic and realized that something blocked his abilities. In seconds the curse would take hold again when he sensed no longer concealed concern for his well-being...and Malfoy knew these were the last words Harry would ever consciously hear him say.
Fire and firemen have a special place in Chicago’s collective heart. The Great Chicago Fire put a huge hole in this city a long time ago, back when most of it was built of wood instead of steel, stone and glass, and because of that, the concept of firemen as models of heroism is embedded in this city’s soul. This place reflects a little of that. The walls have been painted with murals of flame, and the go-go boys dance on brass poles like the ones inside of fire stations. One boy is even dancing in a cage on top of a converted truck ladder. Old firefighter’s equipment is under glass or decorating behind the huge bar, and red strobe lights fire off regularly while sirens slash through the ambience. The drinks have catchy little names like ‘Old Sparky’ or ‘Where There’s Smoke…’, drink specials kick off when the sirens sound, the bartenders are wearing fire helmets and very little else, and the place is packed to capacity. A little kitschy, but perfect for what I want tonight.
Dora frowned mildly while she pulled the phone out and checked the incoming number. The name slipped from her mouth like growl before she could stop herself. “Luna…Kingsley…forgive me. I’ve gotta take this.”
Another day would go by, milling through endless possibilities, and if they were very fortunate, the majority could be dealt with by local authorities and a few phone calls. Occasionally he traveled about England with various partners, but unless something very serious was underway, his day would be spent here, and that was just how he liked it.
“I want you to fuck me. I want the best you’ve ever given, nothing less than that. And I want it NOW!” Harry bit down hard as he released Draco’s wrists and rolled in unison with Draco.
Harry leaned in close, and warm breath was on the shell of Draco’s ear. “Draco, I don’t want to shag you. I don’t want to bugger you, I don’t want to fuck you, I don’t want to do anything that you don’t want as well. What I do want, right now, is to get some small measure of privacy, and then I want to make love with you, to you, anyway that works. Do you get it? ‘Cause I do. It isn’t what we do…it’s why we do it. Maybe one of us won’t know exactly every last thing about how and what to do, but who bloody cares? As long as it’s you, I’m where I want to be. It’s right. It’s what I want. Don’t you?”
"Harry. I saw him in the mirror. Not as a professor…not as a friend. As a lover who desired me. That is what I saw."
“Thank you. This is good. I like this.” Draco’s breath puffed softly onto Harry’s neck, and Harry made himself perfectly at ease before he spoke.
“I said…I’m sorry.”
As Draco looked through the open door of the lonely cottage on the seaside, he could make out two standing forms and two prone ones. The two standing held wands in hand, and laughed cruelly. They were black clad and clearly in charge of the situation, while the blond man on the floor held the body of a woman next to him, weeping openly and slumped with an air of abject defeat.
Blaise fucking Zabini.
Harry stood stock still, his back to Malfoy, panicking over what to say. All he could manage was a strangled, “Thanks. It was cool. Good night,” before he slipped out of the room and back into the halls, inwardly screaming at himself for his own stupidity.
Draco responded, gray eyes still glazed and pupils dilated. When he pulled himself onto his knees, Harry could see the blonde’s unrestrained erection pulsing and weeping, jutting outward from Draco’s lap.
TBC!!!
Harry shrugged agreement as they walked the halls together. The Marauder’s Map was rarely used now, and then only when a student couldn’t be easily found or accounted for quickly. It was a fine fallback, and had prevented lost students from suffering undue trauma more than once over the two past decades. He hadn’t had to use it in almost two years, but it was a damned useful thing to have around in a pinch. He still had his old cloak and a few other useful tidbits at his disposal…just in case a situation arose…like the time one of Hagrid’s ‘pets’ had escaped and had to be lured from the lair it had made in one of the Ravenclaw lavatories before it could be captured and tranquilized.
Draco, true to form, insisted that he had been horribly wronged, and deserved compensation. In this case, compensation meant being the recipient of the first blow job either of them had ever participated in. Harry was actually sort of eager to try it out, but he didn't dare admit that when Malfoy clearly wanted him to do something. Giving in or appearing agreeable would only end in Draco being more smug than he already was...which strained credulity to say the least!
“Yeah, yeah. I really don’t care.” Draco’s eyes were drifting shut.
“Malfoy…do you…do you come up here much?”
How long will this job of Harry’s take? Will it just be one person? Other questions come to mind as well. Does he only kill gangsters? What about their families? Does he ever have to kill them too? Women…children? He’s a killer, and the professionals are paid to not ask questions. He has no choice about who the targets are. He’s like a gun…emotionless…distant from it all…a tool aimed in the direction of a target and fired when ready. Can a living weapon pick and choose the people it’s used against? I can’t imagine Harry killing women and kids. I can’t.
Draco, glancing away distractedly, muttered, “That’s not much of a threat.”
“You…you mean? You…really…? Me…for me?! I…I‘m sorry…”
And she’s gone, shoving the phone into her purse and hustling down the hall. I can hear her saying goodbye to Harry in the hall, and I just dread what’s coming next. Harry comes through the door in a hurry and pops the closet door open to grab a decent suit. I get my goodbye conversation over his shoulder while he fumbles with his clothes.
Luna Lovegood looked up from her book with a smile. “Heya, Harry. Good to see you again…ditch the robes and let’s chat.”
“Maybe…but make me forget it anyway. Please?”
"No! Nothing like that! We haven't done anything…except a bit of snogging here and there. The kids were about…ours and his…and you know we wouldn't do anything like that in front of them! You're okay with this? Really?"
He’s been sipping that drink deeply while we chat. He even looks a little muddled. It won’t be long before the drug overpowers him. Then I’m free to act.
“What do you do for fun?”
It sounds like a small thing. It's not. I was bequeathed a thing that people live and die praying for, without knowing what I'd receive. I looked almost like I do now, with, well, certain obvious differences. Harry...he didn't take it as well as I'd hoped. Actually...he was sort of justifiably furious about me taking the decision into my own hands and taking risks without heeding the warnings. My darling child...as much as I have tried to explain that we're just like anyone else...there is a truth I have sometimes avoided...and it's that we aren't. Harry and I are gay...and not just slightly gay, but very. What comes with that difference is that we like each other because we are male. For your father, sex with a woman was not one of his plans. To his credit...he loves me exactly as I am...exactly as I was, and he wasn't nursing some hidden desire for women while settling for me. It was comforting to know that...but, how can I say this? He was outraged that I'd transformed into something other than the me he'd always known.
I can give you my personal confidence that Draco wants nothing more than to be recognized for his abilities, but I can’t give you more than guesses at his motivations or goals. And that brings me to another question. With all due respect, since he does seem most comfortable discussing his thoughts with me…albeit just barely…I’m not entirely comfortable divulging his innermost thoughts or feelings to anyone…especially if they’re to be inscribed and shipped off to some Ministry office. Would it at least be acceptable to give you literal reports of his behavior, and just gloss over anything not relevant to his case?”
“Um…I…about that book. I still…I’d like to read it.”
One’s scruffy as hell. Hairy, both on the arms and with a five o’ clock shadow that’s seven hours early, but small and wiry. He might just get ignored completely. The ugly ones sometimes do, or if they don’t, it’s usually just a one time deal to establish dominance, and they never have to deal with it again.
“Sheesh. Sorry, Blaise.”
He'd been playing Seeker against Harry, each of them leading teams of youngsters against one another, laughing madly in the wind and chill of outdoors in late fall. Young Draco was as well wrapped against the weather as the rest of them, but the cap and heavy scarf wound around his face left only the eyes visible. Grey eyes, more the color of lead than his father's lighter cloud grey, slightly red rimmed from the cold and high emotions in mid game. At that moment he'd looked at his son's face and faltered, nearly falling from his broom in shock, only to recover momentarily and beg off, insisting that he was just a little winded and would step in for a brandy.
“There are too many things we don’t say. Tonight, I want to say them.” Draco tensed ever so slightly at the serious tone in Harry’s voice. He waited for Harry to continue, his own breath caught in his throat.
I knew it would come to that. He was going to ask it more directly than before. He never liked making a gesture without a certain style to it. The right time, the right words, the right ambience. He’s more polished now. Not just a high rent teenage dope pusher with a taste for good living. It’s funny. If I’d never met Harry…if I’d gotten out after seven years with nothing to my name and no future…or even if I’d just taken the two grand in that envelope and asked Ron to drop me off downtown…I’d probably say yes.
Can't say I felt sorry for him. Not entirely. More like surprised and disgusted and upset. I cleaned him and the place up as a kind of thank you, and figured I probably wouldn't get much out of him except a polite request to fuck off back to Grimmauld Place. The breakfast part wasn't entirely generosity. I was starved and just nipped down the street for some groceries so I could make my own meal while throwing something together for him. I'd spent the night either cleaning him up, or fixing the flat up properly, or dozing on his chair (after I spelled the fucking thing clean.) I hadn't planned for scenario that involved being there more than an hour or so.
He wasn’t disappointed. Draco finally paused in his ministrations and guided Harry to his knees on the edge of the baths. Draco was behind him, comfortable on the steps, on partly submerged in warm water. In seconds, a familiar and devilish tongue was performing while subtle hands caressed Harry oh so teasingly.
What a terrible life. Insert your own sarcastic smirk. I’m going to be busy for awhile.
Draco had looked a bit irritable about additional classes at first, but his expression shifted to one of naked interest when Firenze was mentioned.
The operating room is stark and clean, with a tiled floor that is absolutely seamless. Everything is white or metal, and there’s a clean sheet across the operating table. There are powerful lamps and portable monitors plugged into the wall, but none of them are on. No beeps or hisses or anything. Just clean and sterile emptiness. I get on the table and try to get into position properly, but I still feel horribly awkward. The wait feels unending. Nothing to do except think…and I do too much of that normally!
You can keep your bowlers black,
Before Draco could remark, Blaise stepped in and said “How about a wizard duel later Potter. In the trophy room at midnight. I'm Malfoy’s second, who's your second?”
They stood in silence for a while. Trying to piece the puzzle together, although it seemed there were many missing pieces to this certain puzzle. How far would they have to go to obtain it?
Ron, true to his word, did understand but looked rather uncomfortable. "I..fine. Let's go before someone or God forbid Percy finds out."
The troll howled in immense pain. It rocked from side to side, swinging his bat in every direction until he dropped it, causing one of the remaining sinks to crumble. Harry clung on for dear life and yelled at Ron "Do something!"
“Oh yeah him, I mean, yes I am”, Harry said nervously. “Why would your father get mad?”
Silence echoed his statement.
Where they are just and loyal,
As they entered his office, Snape quickly set him up with cleaning products to clean 8 filthy cauldrons. Before Harry started, he spotted Snape's bloody leg as he sat down to grade some papers.
Draco saw the disappointment in the other boy’s eyes and said “Harry, no need to look disappointed, I want to be your friend otherwise why would I be here.” Harry let a small smile appear on his face at that. Draco continued “If we can figure out a plan to deceive my father, then I’m in.”
His eyes landed on the Weasley twins clapping Harry on the back and departed leaving Harry alone. After a minute, making sure the twins were most definitely gone, Draco was about to head in when Harry’s voice stopped him mid-step. “Hello, Draco. I was wondering how long it would take for you to catch me alone.”
Harry laughed. Looking at Albus, then Draco, he did see the resemblance already. Albus’ eyes were just like Draco’s, except a light, almost pastel green, slit as well, the shape the same too. They would have to wait till he was a bit older to truly see. His ears were thinner than Harry’s, though that could’ve been because he was just born.
On his walk back, it was busy. The downside to living in the city. He didn’t care for it. His head began to throb as he walked in the station doors, most likely from all the paperwork, only to have pain shoot through his head when someone walked past him, bumping into his shoulder.
“Stupid Gryffindor.”
Suddenly being in Harry’s arms, held up against him by strong arms then his hot breath and rough lips against his sensitive neck, had heat flare through his body, suddenly dizzy, and he knew he was blushing.
His scars revealed he was a fighter and he was! But when it came to Draco he just...he was a fucking coward! He couldn’t tell him.
She didn’t answer his question, but he didn’t want to push. He twitched his tail and whined. He forgot about that.
Harry looked across Draco’s face for a sign. It was usually hard, it still was.
There was that petty bitch part of him that knew he’d get some sort of revenge on Harry for keeping it from him for 5 years.
Draco POV
He was only 11!
Harry pulled Draco’s wrist he was still holding and slowly, his own breath wavering, rubbed his cheek against the palm, causing Draco to jolt again.
He heard his Pop chuckle. “I bet if you moved him to your lap, you wouldn’t  be taking much space.”
Draco would’ve laughed if he didn’t feel wretched. What she saw in Harry was an illusion. Not real. Whatever heroic bastard she thought up, wasn’t the man he truly was.
Draco simply smiled softly, not having the energy to smirk or quip back.
Draco slowly moved in Harry’s grasp, the other not wanting to let go now that he had a hold.
He gasped. His body trembled and he began to cry.
His heart was hammering in his chest. He pried his eyes open, though it was hard with the wind surrounding him, making it hard to hear and see.
Harry swore his face was splitting with the force of his grin.
Being up high, not riding a broom or worrying about others seeing, was nice.
Albus was easily in Harry’s arms a moment later, the child inconsolable. “Where’s mom?” Harry tried staying calm, his voice rough, but not loud, his body shaking and magic thrumming wildly in his veins. Having Albus in his arms helped to ground him. No doubt, if it were before, Harry would be searching blindly.
Draco had to think. He’d never heard of a Claim causing fevers. He opened and closed his mouth, trying to ask. She waited.
“Comfortable?” Harry finished, seeing if that was what he was going to say. He swallowed thickly.
His eyes fluttered as he took deep breathes.
He didn’t expect Draco to nod. “I’m an only child but I do care for him in a familial way. He explained it’s something that happens in some books he’s read. It’s called “found family”. Anyway, Potter, who were you looking for?”
“Stop it, Potter.” Draco warned.
She looked at him confused but got up quickly and grasped his hand, as well as taking a small brightly colored candy out of her purse. “Sweets, they always help you make friends.”
“Y-yes, Sir.”
Draco stopped. “It’s not a Claim induced infatuation. I’ve loved Harry for years. It’s not just me being stubborn.”
Draco blushed and clawed down Harry’s chest, feeling the muscles quiver underneath. “Oh, please. It makes you feel stronger. Being able to lift me so easy. You couldn’t do it long though-Ah.”
“Naw, I wanna see this. I’ll show you.” She snickered.
‘Friends, he said. Did Draco Malfoy have friends?’ He thought back to who Draco Malfoy was. His gut clenched and he bent over the side, thinking he was going to heave again, but didn’t. The “medicine” might be wearing off.
Harry’s grip tightened as his heart clenched. He grit his teeth. Harry had to breath through his nose, taking deep breaths. Draco hadn’t used his first name since back then. “Why would it be easier?”
He tried focusing on inside then, since he couldn’t outside. He thought of memories. Ones with Pup though, his happiest ones, he had come to a realization, only brought a gut sickening guilt.
“Wooow. This is so cool! Now I can visit Rose.” Albus began looking for Floo powder. Draco hadn’t brought it in yet.
Harry got to the door first, opening it wide to reveal the children in a heap on the porch, panting. Hermione was right by him, grabbing her baby. Albus slowly got up, magic running along his body like electricity as he clutched a wand tight to his chest. Once he laid eyes on Harry, his lip wobbled and tears welled. “Da! Mom’s gone! Don’t-don’t know where he went!” He wouldn’t release the wand.
He lightly touched his claim bite. He sighed, a gentle, sad smile. A spark of a memory made him chuckle.
Neville looked awestruck. Draco gave a questioning glance.
Bellatrix cackled maniacally as Astoria and Scorpius held faces of horror, Scorpius screaming as best he could and Astoria refusing, begging.
Harry rose a brow. “What?” He quirked a lip, always liking when Albus got like this. His eyes would dilate ever slightly like Draco’s would.
Nor was it easier when they didn’t recognize you.
His voice held curiosity.
His ears stood to attention and his tail flicked. He looked over and smiled. “Fingers crossed. For both of us.” He crossed both hands, a gesture he’d seen Hermoine use.
He felt Draco flick his forehead, he winced at it. “Went easy. Really, Potter. If you’re going to lie, do it right.”
“So...” he went to try for a random topic when he felt the MP3 poke is thigh. He got an idea. He took it out and presented it to Draco with excitement, a grin on his face. This made Draco startle at his movement but then looked confused, his brow arched and lip puckered out slightly.
A surge of deja vú hit him. They’d said these words before.
When Draco saw them, Harry didn’t blame him for narrowing his eyes and standing.
Draco didn’t look at Harry. He took a deep breath and stood up. He looked to Albus, smiling small, hoping it didn’t look forced. “Well, I now have a lovely family picture to chase those away.” He grabbed Albus and began nuzzling his face and hugging him. “I’m sorry I worried you. I’m okay now. You saved Mom.”
Draco was still processing why he was in that state for that long. Maybe he should. The last doctor, not counting Madame Pomphrey, was the Malfoy doctor when he was 15. He didn’t want to go, but he probably should.
Draco could feel the coil of panic in his chest. ‘Happening?’ What could be happening?! He wasn’t sure how to respond.
As a topic of interest to the others came up, it got considerably louder. Draco was in no mood.
He rose a brow and sat straighter, putting one leg over the other. “True, but you said “not sure” which isn’t a “no”. Which either means you think I’ll take it as a “fuck off” or I’ll keep asking which you aren’t sure if you want or not, which means there’s no one either near or currently in your circle you can confide in. So...would you like to listen to music to calm a bit or chat with someone who might know what you’re feeling?” He had his cheek propped on his hand, the player in the other.
They greeted their kids and Harry got up to hug them as well. Draco stiffened in surprise though, when Harry dragged him over.
Draco made a surprised noise, before after a moment of Harry holding it, Draco made a desperate noise in the back of his throat, clutching his own hands against Harry’s and tried moving closer.
“Harry. I...I need time. Please. Heh, and you know I never say please. Please don’t hate me for this.”
“Let go and do it yourself.” Draco said, trying and failing to regain control over his voice.
Why did Harry have to say that, when Draco was the one being selfish?
He obviously wasn’t. He wiped at the tears that wouldn’t stop.
He could hear Harry walking over to where he guessed Draco was in the large pile. His voice was soothing, sweet.
Harry sighed. “No. I’m not. Draco wouldn’t leave Albus and Rose. Even if he did, he’d keep his wand. There’s nothing in Albus’ memories or any other magic signature lingering on it. I’m lost.”
He went to move to the side as Draco’s hand touched his bicep.
Harry smiled fondly. “You.”
Draco POV
‘Of course he did.’ Draco thought sarcastically.
Harry looked down to his belt as he felt Draco’s hands there, then his wand, Draco having put it there so he probably wouldn’t lose it. Harry reached and grabbed his wrist, causing Draco to jolt violently in surprise. Harry noted how thin and bony it was. If it were a physical fight, Harry would’ve worried more if he’d broken something in Draco. He didn’t think Draco was ever that thin.
A few hours later had Ron winning the final score and Harry buying them dessert, Ron’s favorite for him winning. It wasn’t quite nightfall when Hermione and Luna returned. Harry hoped she’d be staying awhile, he knew Draco wanted to thank her for the exotic meats.
‘Good bye, Pup. I tried, but I can’t wait for you anymore.’
Draco blushed but nodded. “Doctor said slowly but alive. She also doesn’t usually have patients in this soon, but, yeah. Oh, I met a bat today. I gave her my number in case she needed a fellow person to vent to.”
Harry chuckled. Draco glared. “You fucker, I should claw you on purpose for that stunt. Then when people ask and you say, “my mate clawed my rugged face off”, I’ll say, “bastard damn well deserved it”!”

He took apart the ear pieces and brought one close to Draco, who leaned away. “You put this part in your ear and this device plays music. I want to show you some.” He knew he sounded excited. He wanted to show Draco what he liked!
Professor Lupin just fixed him a grin. “Neville let me in and threatened Blaise who threatened the others. Didn’t realize how great it was having a person on the inside.” He chuckled.
It was the close calls that fueled Draco’s impulses.
Harry didn’t smile or scoff. “Draco, love. You’ve been in and out of that fever for almost a month. I had to give you painkillers just to make you sleep, remember?”
Sirius looked over and grinned widely. Very similar to Harry. “Ah! This must be Draco. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” He went over and held out his hand. Draco shook it.
Draco looked to Sirius with awe. No wonder, Harry was so loving despite his real parents being dead. No. Not his real parents. His birth parents.
But as time went on, specifically the current year, it turned to more...banter.
He knew in his birth parent’s time some purists began to eliminate his type. Some made it, but now they have to hide or disguise themselves. His birth parents were part of it, having been targeted, but that’s about all he knew.
Draco saw an opening where he could escape unharmed, but it was the opposite direction of Harry.
He walked over, bending down as Albus steadied his over night pack. Draco purred and kissed his cheeks over and over. Albus giggled before making grossed out noises.
Draco POV
Draco shook his head. “N-no.” He whimpered.
Draco felt like a spring. “You don’t.”
He sighed. Maybe he could direct her.
‘What is this guy made out of?!’
It was the same from his childhood.
With that, Draco left with a light pat and  Harry was already missing his hand on his back.
He wanted love.
Looking back, all he caught was a fluffy tail with markings and fingers dipped with long thick claws reaching to open the door. Harry got a chill.
“Good boy. Let’s see how your mate appreciates your work.” Tom growled against Draco’s ear, though he processed, Draco couldn’t move from where his knees buckled.
Harry felt a warmth blossom in his chest. “I don’t know. But what does that matter if that’s what you’re feeling? We never did decide what his last name would be.” He used his thumb to wipe away Draco’s tears, knowing he wouldn’t want anyone to see him like that.
Riddle petted him so gently, Draco waited for the blow. “You know, Draco. Predator’s have to learn that prey is anything. You’ve always been thin.”
The week after Lupin’s visit had Draco going through a few days of fever and pain. He didn’t know why, this time was a bit different. This time, the pain was worse and he saw the thin streams of magic that his father must’ve been talking about, that was leftover from Pup. The magic flickered. It was weak, but that was fine because Pup wasn’t there to renew his bite.
Draco frowned. “Harry?”
It stopped though, at Draco’s reaction. He covered his mouth with one hand, something seemed to click in his mind without his mother saying more, the other wrapping around his belly, his claws digging into the fabric. He began to hyperventilate and his ears pinned back. Harry grabbed his hand when he slowly got close enough, causing Draco to gasp and jolt. He looked at Harry’s eyes, Harry not liking the fear there.
His emotions began to swap around each other. Harry chuckled, for some reason finding this amusing.
Draco POV
Was he after Harry or himself?
He hadn’t Claimed Draco, despite his approval on his birthday months ago. He didn’t feel it would be fair to his beautiful mate.
Sirius’ eyes seemed to catch the magic along the room, it being agitated from the number of people in the area, something beginning to take shape. His face slowly fell more, a look of fear and horror on his face. “But He’s dead. Moony, He’s GONE. There was no trace of Him anywhere. We searched for months.” Sirius’ eyes began to panic and his breathing irregular.
She straightened her back again, catching she slouched. “We were talking about family.”
Harry remembered what he’d said because he remembered Draco hiking his shoulder to his jaw, defensive, a way to protect his neck from someone.
Draco seemed to think on it. He continued to caress and mess with Albus’ hair, ears, face, almost like he was resisting something more instinctual.
When he entered, Longbottom was there, tending to some of the greenery.
Harry side glanced her. “Yeah. He loved those things. There was usually only enough for Draco and he needed it more than me. What kind of livers did you use? Those were his favorite. You still send them, right? I know he gets them less than when he was pregnant.” He began to think. His mate did love them.
“What are you thinking?” Harry asked.
Who was Draco Malfoy?
‘So he wants to hear this? Is that what he’s saying?’ Harry was confused and the longer Ginny’s wand stayed on Draco’s throat, the more angry Harry became.
Astoria quirked her brow. “What are you looking for?”
Like he’d already done something wrong by him.
The candy fell out of his pocket as he was getting back into his normal clothes and though he hated sweets, he popped the round candy in his mouth as he left the hospital.
Draco looked over. He felt his heart clench. “Just...why do you guys accept me? I crossed out Harry’s mark. You don’t have to like me anymore.”
He saw Harry did look, his face scrunched in confusion. “Indents in your spine? When did...” he looked to the other, more confused by what he was seeing. “What’s this?”
Draco put his hand on Harry’s back to push himself into standing straight, when he wasn’t bent that far, but paused right next to Harry’s face.
‘Where was I...?’ He looked around, seeing he got himself lost. No, couldn’t be lost.
The light from the hallway obscured the man’s form, but his scarlet eyes glowed in the limited light there was.
Remus was biting a knuckle, his ears lowered. He looked…frightened. “Padfoot. Pad-Sirius Black, come here.” He hollered downstairs.
The ride there to the castle was long and all Draco could think, was he felt like he’d done something wrong.
His Pop was reading a book, sitting next to the seats Draco was laying out on. Harry felt a fondness bloom as he saw his Pop pull the thin blanket over Draco more. The feline having fallen asleep.
“Good, your fever is down. How’re you feeling?” Harry’s voice was a nice thing to hear after the fever fit.
“Neville, wait. Can...please don’t judge me, but...oh I can’t believe this...can you stay, like near the door or in the dorms? I...” he wasn’t sure how to finish it without sounding like a child.
‘A bat?’ He realized, along with the large ears atop her head, twitching. She pulled out a book, though it was obvious she wasn’t reading it.
Even through the pain and chill, he smiled. He sat quietly, on the side of one sink, in case a bout of nausea hit again. Myrtle spoke on and on and Draco let her.
‘Oh.’
Draco’s eyes were crinkled with amusement. “I’m not sure, can you, Potter?”
When the doctor came in, she switched on the light board and set up the first X-ray. His spinal one. He noticed there were indents in the back of his neck vertebrae along with what looked like nerves coming out. It sent a chill down his back.
Harry felt his nostrils flare, not liking that Draco was pushing him away. Not after Draco woke up with an injury and having a mental break. He stood, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. “It’s not about dignity, Draco. You know that. If that were the case, I’d-“ Harry stopped himself by covering his mouth, eyes averted. He took a deep breath. If he were to say what he hesitated to, Draco would take it the wrong way. “Why did you build Albus a floo chimney?” He decided to go to a different topic. One that hopefully wasn’t as tender. “Why didn’t you tell me about the nightmares? How does Albus know?” Harry had never been good when it came to his concern over Draco and their child. His Pop and Dad always laughed about it. He knew he should’ve been calmer, but something unpleasant nagged at him.
He let his mind wander and he knew he shouldn’t have left Harry there, even after he looked so worried. He just couldn’t bear if Harry saw him sick and disgusting. Or worry the Gryffindor more. He’d feel so embarrassed.
Draco sighed when he got to his bed. He paused though when he pulled back the covers and got wrapped in.
I personally think that you respect Professor Potter quite a bit. That’s very admirable of you, and he’s certainly done quite a few things worthy of respect. I still think that respecting his wishes for a little longer is a gesture of respect that he would appreciate. As for Professor Weasley, I wasn’t kidding you when I suggested a game of wizard chess. If you want his respect, beat him fair and square and you’ll have it. He has an unholy passion for it…and one thing you should know…do not underestimate him. You might find it a great deal more challenging than you expect. So how’s that for a start?”
Chapter 17: A Battle Of Wills And Skills
“Detective Kingsley here. What?! Where? We can be there in ten minutes. Thanks.”
That aside…meeting some cute girls would be nice. Just the thought was enough to make him smirk. That, and the I-pod he had tucked into his left ear was playing a little number by Shane MacGowan and The Popes. Seamus whispered along while his fingers rattled the keyboard furiously.
Draco was sliding his way inward, slow and certain, with little pauses that let Harry breath easy and steel himself for more. When the soft blond scruff of Draco’s pubic hair was snug and close against him, and soft, heavy balls were at rest against his bum, Harry sighed with relief, and let himself relax completely, experimenting with the much missed feel of Draco’s cock buried deep inside of him.
I know what kind of symbolic acts are normally required, but this will take more than that. This isn't a penny ante curse from a Diagon Alley witch...it won't be answered with just symbolism or substitutes. We'll have to be in the exact place the curse was set, and to counter the hate, the rage and pain that were used to fuel the original curse...it will take love. Not desire, not lust...unselfish, unfettered love. The kind where someone else's well being is more precious to you than your own. The only question is this: do you think you have it in you to bring that to the spell? It doesn't matter what you call it, but you cared enough to unravel this when no one else could...and enough to show up here and risk a hexing to get me involved. How far are you willing to go?"
I can believe in God, but not the way so many others do. They cite His influence behind every typhoon or tornado, every flood or famine, every disease and every drought. Even terrorism is the Lord’s punishment upon the faithless. Sinfulness, such as homosexuality, brings His wrath down upon the wicked and evil. Funny thing though. If you weigh the evidence from natural disasters, it would appear that God considers trailer parks to be the most egregious sin known to mankind, because he seems to be wiping those out in far greater numbers than gay bars or abortion clinics. Call me crazy, but I don’t believe in a God with lousy aim, and I don’t believe he’s as worried about the fine print as the religious leaders like to claim. I also can’t quite believe that he needs such extravagant donations. If God can’t manage his own money, I’m not sure we should be turning to him for advice.
"HARRY... shut it! That is an order! When I'm done explaining, you can ask questions, but right now you don't know what you're talking about. Just trust me love... please?"
Severus Snape may not have approved of their newly reborn relationship, but Draco claimed his desire for Harry’s company was central to his recovery, and he couldn’t do the ‘homework’ his therapist assigned without Harry present. Snape relented, but couldn’t help glowering when he entered the common room and found them in mid-snog on the couch. To his way of thinking, no one should get that much pleasure from any sort of ‘homework’.
Draco huffed in relative silence while Harry pulled the main course a little closer and took a tentative bite.
Harry cried out loudly when Draco gently nipped at the flesh just below Harry’s balls, and Draco suddenly realized that there was no need for silence on Harry’s part. At last they were in a place where they could not be overheard or interrupted. No pleasure would be denied them here. How fitting.
Draco bristled with outrage. “What…I…rrr! Never mind! What did I ever do to you!? Here’s the papers. Good night!”
It seems that my very own, dear, old Daddy has been up to his usual tricks, but this time he’s taking his cues from Mr. Riddle and the Enigma Corp. As a result, we’ve been here with our ears and eyes fixed on every snippet of news we can get, all to piece together an action plan that revolves around balking the Enigma Corp and frustrating Riddle enough to make him lose his temper and leave us a clue we can really work with. Call me invested in the process, but if Harry can do this one last job, he’ll be able to quit this and leave it all behind. A life with no more complications would be his and mine, and I’d endure a lot worse than excess hours at the office to achieve a goal like that!
Dead Russians at a construction site, dead Italians in a bar office, dead Chinese above and outside a restaurant. An illegal sports bookie hanged in his apartment. A gas leak that asphyxiated a supposedly retired mobster in his sleep. A Latin playboy/cartel rep stabbed in a bathroom with no trace of anyone nearby. Every criminal organization in the Chicago area is on the brink of open warfare with others, and every death is being watched closely now. They’re all attributed to and linked to the prison riot, hinting that it may have started with the inmate deaths weeks ago. They don’t know it’s all Harry, but they’ve called in the FBI.
Draco closed his eyes and felt the faint moisture of tears at the corners, hating the heat of his own face and the breaths that came hard while he struggled to maintain his self control. Crying accomplished nothing. It was the fallback of weaklings and cowards. ‘Mama’s boys’ wept, but Durmstrang graduates did not! Slow breathing and hardened thoughts pushed the tears back. What could not be cured must be endured. He would pack and go before they made it the worse for him by shaming him publicly as some final insult.
DISCLAIMER: Warning ! I make no claim to any property of J.K Rowling's, and am in no way profiting by this. I do offer her my sincerest thanks for allowing us this garden of the mind in which we play. Further Warning! This story...and likely any I ever write..are dominated by gay themes and characters. That's how it is, if this in any way makes you uncomfortable...do not read further.
“I’m not sorry….about…the…”
He’d never discussed it, but he knew that tidbit of information was important. Even if Draco acted blasé about things, there were underlying feelings at work that Draco would only share when he was ready.
Harry. Harry was on the other end of the couch. His head was tipped back against the cushion, and his feet were on the floor. Harry had slept sitting next to him…all night. Draco’s mouth was bone dry. His breath was an offense against nature. His head was pulsating with the deep, low thud of a bass drum, and his eyes were crusted and gummed with the residue of tears and sleep. This was not a dignified way for a man of more than thirty years to wake.
A few minutes later, Harry finally felt clean. He headed back to Draco’s room and was surprised to find Luna seated outside the room.
Harry studied the letter but his attention was quickly pulled from it when the owl nipped at him looking for treats. He made his way to the fireplace where a jar of owl treats sat. He threw one at the owl who deftly caught it and flew out the open window. With a sigh, Harry headed up the stairs to one of the spare rooms in order to prepare it for Draco.
“Go back to sleep dear,” Myrle said to him as she walked towards the door, “rather get some sleep, it won't help if you’re so tired you can’t be there for him.” She said as she closed the door behind her.
“Hermione.” Harry said, and his voice left no room for discussion. Hermione hurried over and gasped when she saw him.
“What is going on here?!” the head guard roared over the din.
Harry Potter and
“Master, Harry,” Kreacher began again with more attitude than was necessary, “I’ve come to return your letter.”
Meanwhile, in London, a Mr Harry Potter lay in a spare bedroom in Grimmauld Place, thinking over how he had grabbed and held Malfoy’s hand, a feeling of dread crept into his heart. He hadn’t asked for consent…
Harry shook his head, “I havent been caught, as far as I know, no one knows what I’ve done except Kreacher and now you two.”
It was just then that the fireplace roared to life and Hermione stuck her bushy haired head through it, “Harry, are you alright? Do you need me to come through?” Her worried voice sparked Harry into an upright position.
The year after Draco had come home from St Mungo’s was one filled with healing and growth. Draco had nightmares most nights and hated sleeping separately from Harry. To this day, he still had nightmares on days where his anxiety was intense. But together they had found their niche and realised that they never wanted to be apart. It was a tricky road to navigate, with Draco coming to terms with being gay and then coming out to his mother. And of course once the press got wind of their arrangement, it was like blood in the water.
Kingsley looked away, “Thats another problem the DMLE is facing, house arrest is our next solution but there are members of the ministry who are against putting him with his mother.”
“Can we see him?” Harry asked before she could turn away.
She waved her wand over Draco’s body and whispered an incantation, Draco and the bed glowed a calming green for a few seconds before Hermione pointed her wand at her clipboard and a series of words appeared on the blank sheet. She looked over the sheet and seemed to take a deep breath before turning to Harry.
“Okay so what’s the issue mate.” Ron asked. He was seated next to Hermione and hadn’t touched his food.
“You’re a lifesaver mate, feels like this house is going to kill me.” Harry smiled.
Hermione slapped his arm, “Oi, I will make you sleep on the couch.”
Harry’s breath got caught in his throat and all he could think was “again?”
Hand in hand, like it started.
Eventually, Draco woke up and once his eyes found Harry, he tried to force himself into a sitting position. But Harry guided him down and placed a few pillows behind his back to make him more comfortable. Draco opened his mouth to say something but the words seemed to die in his throat. Harry rushed forward and enveloped the blonde in a hug.
“He has multiple wounds, all of them from curse damage, I think there's at least 2 broken ribs and I can sense that one of the Unspeakables has been used on him. he needs to go to St Mungo’s.” Hermione announced grimly.
Harry had just stepped out of his floo when a tawny owl landed on his windowsill and pecked at the window, asking to be let in. With a sigh he walked over and allowed it in, the owl landed on the armrest of the nearest couch before holding out its leg where there was an attached letter.
Draco could not remember him, but the name had sounded familiar, it was possible Aunty Bella had spoken about him once or twice. Often his name was in a sentence with the words “blood traitor” and “mudblood friends”.
And honestly, he shouldn't be surprised by Granger’s interest and keen, albeit, annoying way of sticking her nose in everything, she did enough of that during their time at school. A pang of guilt rang through Draco at the thought of Weasley joining the other twin because… because… Draco stopped that train of thought. He knew the train of thought well, and he knew where it led him. He promised his mother and Pansy that he’d not fall into that pit, after they’d found him with slashes down his wrist after a particular bad thought.
Harry shook his head, “Haven’t done shopping in ages, there might be some Chinese takeout in the fridge and possibly cheese?”
“You’ll be okay in Azkaban, Hermione has gotten the Ministry to remove the dementors, she was very firm on that,” Draco nodded as Potter spoke, he’d heard the guards in the Ministry cells talking about it. “And once you get out, if you need a safe place to stay, or just someone to talk to, I live at number 12 Grimmauld Place, London.” Potter says with an open expression in his eyes, an expression Draco was taught not to show for fear of weakness.
Olive was tall, had bright brown eyes and short cropped brown hair with blonde highlights, on the collar of their cape was a small pin that read, ‘they/them’.
Harry Potter was not having luck, none at all. Hermione had provided him with a series of books and manuals of home decor and renovations and DIY, but none of it seemed to be working at all. He was currently trying to remove the ghastly green carpet from his living room but it seemed to be stuck down with industrial grade sticking charms. He had gone through nearly all the charms in the books and none of them seemed to be doing much.
“Well Hermione might, you know how she was when you wore that red jersey last week.” Draco countered. Hermione had been rushed to St Mungo's last night for early labour and had been patiently waiting for her first daughter to arrive. As the two godfathers, Draco and Harry were instructed to be there at a very specific time (3:27 pm) by a very emotional Hermione. And no one dared question.
Harry smiled and heard Hermione scoff behind him, “Of course, do you have a pen and paper?” Rosetta nodded and handed him a quill with a pink glittery feather and Harry signed the page and handed it back to her. She looked like she was about to pass out from glee.
