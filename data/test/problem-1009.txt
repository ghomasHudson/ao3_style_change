Next, he cast a thorough cleaning charm on himself to save time, brushed his hair, and opted for the sharpest all black robes he had. If he was going to get attacked at least he could look sharp while engaging in an epic duel with Malfoy.
It may have been minutes, or hours, later, when the two of them found themselves lying beside each other again. The awful feeling of finality was taking over Harry, limb by limb, making him want to cry and be numb at the same time. He tried to shake the sensation by appreciating the fact that Draco was still there with him, he had not yet gone.
Harry interrupted him, “I don’t have time for this,” he said matter-of-factly, if someone wanted out of this situation, it was him, “believe me,
The blond man was walking around the small garden, examining the small plants pushing out of their flowerbeds. The heat of the sun was collecting on his black turtleneck, and it made him absentmindedly roll up his sleeves, exposing the pale skin underneath. Harry gulped at the sight of the tall man with his sleeves rolled up, silver and gold hair being gently dishevelled by the wind. It was so out of place that Harry had to look away when Malfoy turned to him. He looked so incredibly good Harry had to focus on acting normal, to not stare.
“Er… I don’t know–“ what the fuck was he supposed to say? “Less pale, I guess, maybe he moved somewhere warm, I dunno…” Harry had to snap his mouth shut right this second. Something must have possessed him, he was sure. He received weird looks from both Ron and Hermione, and decided to quickly change the subject, that’s what casual people do, right?
, saying that I was lying about Voldemort being back? Or after that, when they put a bounty on my head? Or–“
It was Friday before Harry got an update about the memory potions case. He was doing the paperwork of the QQS arrest when Evergrey appeared in his office. Harry had already told him that the Malfoy family ring Narcissa had showed him a week ago did not resemble the ring in evidence in the slightest, and even though they had agreed that it most likely ruled Narcissa out of the picture, they could not definitively close that lead. Now Harry could tell from Patrick’s face that this was not just a check-in, but that he came with news.
“I’m not denying that!” Harry defended, and then continued, more softly, “I’m just into someone else right now.”
Harry shook his head in frustration, they should be going in already, not drawing more attention to themselves by standing in front of the entrance in fucking
“Good to know,” Harry nodded, “what’s that you were reading?” he gave a meaningful glance at the huge encyclopaedia lying on the desk.
The oven timer beeped and Hermione swung around to fetch the casserole, chicken and spinach with lots of cheese, Harry’s favourite, it smelled heavenly. “Right then, I’ll go put Rosie to bed, you lads can set the table.” Ron and Harry nodded and started getting things out of the cupboards.
Malfoy snorted. “Are you joking? That whole affair is a suicide.” Right after saying that he pulled a face. Admittedly, it probably wasn’t the best choice for words. Poor Cedric.
As for the ‘exciting part of the Ministry’, Ron was inferring to the Auror Office, of which Hermione never brought any news. After defeating Voldemort, Hermione had gone on to take her N.E.W.T.s and subsequently applied to study Magical Law. A few months before graduating she and Ron had found out that they were expecting Rose, and Hermione decided to halt job hunting right after graduation. Instead, she stayed home for half a year after little Rosie was born, after which Ron had insisted that he could cut down on his shifts at the shop in order for Hermione to be able to look for work.
“Grandfather of Dargan Ridgenorth, no doubt,” Harry nodded. It was hard for him to forget that he was no longer on the case, “very interesting.”
, Harry had thought upon recalling that James and Snape had also been at odds back in school. He wished that Malfoy wouldn’t treat his kids, or anyone for that matter, the way Snape had treated Harry.
“You’ll just have to lure someone in with your natural charisma, then,” Ginny winked, although she made a good point about how utterly horrific Harry was at trying to chat someone up. He was pretty sure he’d never even tried that before, just look at how bad he was at trying to perform small talk with Isabel and George earlier.
A furious red spread from Malfoy’s ears to his face and his expression tightened again to something heated. “I just like to look nice, that’s all,” he murmured through gritted teeth, his stare piercing.
Draco’s lips pursed as he fell back into the sofa with a tired huff. “I just… I wish I didn't have to feel so indebted to you all the time.”
“Right, ‘course not,” said Harry after a pause, not knowing how to react. Hopefully the self-writing quill managed to compose an appropriate response on the parchment because Harry sure wasn’t able to. He felt like an absolute git for assuming right away that Malfoy was up to something bad – he had been wrong about that before (although, he had also been right about that before).
Harry felt like he was going daft. He never wanted to leave this bed, leave Malfoy’s side. That was the main problem for Harry – he thought that his apartment would feel much less lonely if Draco was there, waiting for him, when he got home in the evening. He would love to settle down with someone, and right now, he couldn’t think of doing that with anyone else. He was well and truly gone for Malfoy. He wanted the man in his bed, in his house, in his life. It was mad, they had only been like this for a few days, and Harry was already planning everything out, even before the end of their week together. Maybe he should just give it some time, maybe things would work themselves out.
“And in the initial questioning you said that your reason for being at the pub was to meet someone? Who were you meeting?” Harry asked, already hating having to ask the question. It was protocol, but Harry really did not care to know what shady businesses Malfoy was conducting this time.
“Are you happy to leave?” Harry had to shake himself out of his thoughts again, and tried to feel out Malfoy’s mood. The man had been scowling the entire time they had been talking, and Harry couldn’t figure out why, so now he carefully tried seeing if it was because he was going away. He himself was feeling very empty, there was a sense of finality in the air that he despised. Harry wished that everything would go back to normal; that Malfoy had never appeared in his office, or that he wouldn’t have to leave. Even being in a never ending back and forth with the git was better than this, an unbearable atmosphere of simultaneous urgency and stagnation.
“Correspondence like this?” the man said amusedly, holding up Harry’s note, burnt from the edges. Then he took an interested look around the room, “Harry Potter’s bedroom, I must be in every girl’s wet dream from ten years ago,” he raised his eyebrows challengingly, with a smirk flickering in the corner of his mouth. Now he was just shamelessly eyeing Harry’s shirtless body; mind you, he had been to the gym earlier that evening.
Draco rolled his eyes, and was just about to deliver some retort, when he heard Harry trampling his way down the wooden stairs in the foyer and into the sitting room as well. Draco felt himself go a bit red, he still did whenever Harry looked especially good, and right now, he did, by Salazar. He was wearing a pale green jumper, neat and soft without being frizzy – Draco had picked it out for him last Christmas – that really brought out his eyes. His hair was still all over the place, as per usual, but over the years he had learnt a few spells that made it a little less so, and tonight it was almost orderly.
Malfoy snorted humourlessly, “Have I?” Harry was disappointed. What a non-answer, the git truly was the master of avoiding questions, not even looking at Harry as he replied.
“Signore Malfoy!” A short, plump man with grey curly hair and a black button down with a matching apron was making his way towards them. His face was red from the heat of the room, but he seemed cheerful to see Malfoy. “Back so soon? Ah, I see you bring a date, I like it, I like it,” the man was nodding eagerly, already motioning them to follow him. Harry couldn’t help noticing how Malfoy didn’t correct him about them being on a date.
It was quiet for a minute as Harry worked, determined not to engage Malfoy anymore. If he wanted to be a wanker, then so be it. It truly wasn’t Harry’s problem in the slightest, and whatever his heart thought he was feeling towards the git, well, it was clearly some kind of a blip. It would pass.
Harry wanted to ask Malfoy what was going on, but the man’s silvery stare made his heart race and his palms sweaty. It had been so much easier to be at odds with the git, always up in arms when they saw each other, Malfoy constantly infuriating him with one thing or another, and now Harry couldn't help thinking if it was all just setting the stage for something far more inevitable. He wanted to say something, anything, to know if it was all in his head, or if the past weeks of the man infiltrating Harry’s life had been a mere coincidence, and Harry’s loneliness had made him read too much into the whole affair.
. “Er… do you want to come inside? Aren’t you cold out here?” Harry tried his hardest in order to change the topic, and the perfect opportunity presented itself when he realized that his toes were freezing off.
Malfoy turned to look at him. Not evaluatively, not bashfully, but very… softly. He extended his arm to fondle Harry’s hair, and Harry kissed his wrist, and Draco kissed his forehead, and then his cheek, and then his mouth. Harry kissed him back, tangling his hand in his hair, caressing his cheek, everything he’d wanted to do for months. After a few kisses, they pulled apart, just staring at each other again. “So you fancy me then?” Harry repeated his question from three months ago, with a teasing look in his eyes, he couldn’t hold back a smirk.
Malfoy looked taken aback. Perhaps he had geared up to fight Harry for much longer than this. Now he let out a deep sigh. “Very well,” the man cleared his throat again and started to make his way to the door, but to Harry’s surprise, turned around just before leaving the room, “sorry for… bothering you.”
“It’s quite alright, you were just doing your job,” came her surprising answer to Harry’s astonishment, he had really thought that she would have been angry, or even agreed with Harry that he had been wrong. If Malfoy had gotten away with everything this easily when he was younger there was no question as to why he had grown up to be so spoiled. Nevertheless, Harry was very grateful for the tolerance he was faced with.
“Ugh, don’t talk about vomit please,” Hermione grumbled and sat up straighter in the chair. Her face changed from agony to a pained smile as she saw someone approaching from Harry’s right side, but he was not able to turn his head to see. Every movement felt too laborious at the moment.
Now Harry wished that he had paid more attention in Ancient Runes, but how the hell could he have anticipated that he would ever need such proficiency? “I don’t, but to me it looks like some kind of a formula. Perhaps it could be the recipe for the memory potion.” If that was it, it could definitely come in handy for the Ministry to have in store, just in case.
He had a dream about Malfoy sitting by his bed at St Mungo’s, waiting for him to wake up, but suddenly the dream changed and he was in his own bed, and Malfoy was still there. He was sitting in the same chair, staring at him, saying
Harry absolutely couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Is this really what Malfoy thought of him? What was Harry supposed to do? Get killed by Voldemort? He was pretty sure he didn’t think himself better than anyone else, in fact, he didn’t like himself very much. He was a shit friend at school, he was a shit boyfriend, he was shit at being close to anyone. Being an Auror was the first and only thing where he didn’t feel like an absolute failure all of the time. Now to hear that someone had gotten his entire character so catastrophically wrong… he didn’t know where to begin, so he didn’t. Malfoy was not worth his time.
“I’d laugh but I’m too full… I’d probably vomit,” Harry groaned, putting his teacup down at the small side table between them.
“What’s with all the questions, Potter?” Malfoy said suddenly, his voice harsh. He had turned in his chair to look at Harry challengingly.
When Draco just shrugged and turned back to stare at the ceiling, mumbling something that might have resembled a
“Because they didn’t accept muggle-borns,” Malfoy said very plainly, “but mother wanted to keep me closer to home,” he added after a short pause. Naturally: Harry had experienced Narcissa’s fierce motherly love himself in the Forbidden Forest all those years ago. It had saved his life.
The day they had gone to pick up Noah to bring him home, the way to the foster house had been very quiet and anxious, but as soon as they had brought him home, and he’d started playing peacefully with a toy Hippogriff Harry had bought for him, there had been a silent sigh of relief, and everything after that had gone smoother than any of them could have predicted. They had both been at home for a few weeks, getting to know their new son, and making sure he was settling in well.
Harry just nodded and was simultaneously frustrated and relieved that he couldn’t go along with them. He really wanted to be the person to catch Ridgenorth after he threw Harry out of the window, but at the same time he really didn’t want to be thrown out of a window again. Evergrey left his office and Harry thought of the case for a while, before forcing himself to return back to work. Theseus was giving him icy looks from his portrait, but didn’t say anything.
Now he finally had the chance to take off his cloak and hang it on the stand that was full of robes as it was. He had already broken some sweat having to stand there talking to everyone still wearing his outer cloak. Now Harry made his way over to Ron to say hi properly, they had just agreed to meet outside of the Burrow at seven sharp, but hadn’t really exchanged greetings further.
, Harry Potter and what he had become, Draco found himself still to be sitting there, at the booth, when one of the Aurors came to interview him, despite his many chances at Disapparating somewhere far, far away.
“I had to see you,” Harry replied firmly, not moving his gaze away. It was the truth, but more importantly, it was what the man had said to Harry when he came to see him that night.
“What’s the matter, Potter? Never seen the Dark Mark before?” Malfoy’s icy voice pierced the warm spring air, making Harry flinch. He had already forgotten about the whole thing, and hadn’t seen Malfoy’s forearm from that far away, but him being upset about the Dark Mark was a better alternative to what actually made him flustered, so he decided to go with that.
“I thought England was your home,” Harry said very quietly, he had pretty much given up on any plan that he had been devising to get Malfoy to… to do
blush!” Harry hissed at him, even though it was getting loud in the pub already. He definitely didn’t want the guy at the bar to ever realize they were talking about him.
“Now, Mr. Malfoy, sir, there are only a few places for you to sign, the seller has already done so, as you will find,” said the man, spreading the parchments on the table in front of Draco, “here is the deed to the house, detailing the features of the lot, as well as the few movables that come with it, you’re welcome to have a look once more…” he continued timidly and started uncorking the ink. Draco had already gone over the paperwork a thousand times, but made sure that Narcissa Malfoy was listed as the primary owner of the property, and him as the co-owner.
Isabel turned back to Harry, “Head Auror, can’t believe I didn’t know that, sorry, heh.” She looked a bit embarrassed even though Harry couldn’t figure out why.
, and when she fell asleep again, Harry gave her the tiniest kiss on her sleeping head, and sneaked out of her room as quietly as possible.
“Did we get him?” Harry slurred, he could barely get a word out, let alone breathe. Knife wound or not, Harry realized between drifting in and out that he was in a lot of pain.
“Honestly? I’m not sure if I could do it, too many memories,” Malfoy shook his head and shuffled his feet, Harry felt Malfoy’s boot accidentally touch his shin and quickly pull away, “blasted McGonagall though, offered me a job as the Potions Master at Hogwarts, apparently Slughorn is retiring after this school year.” Malfoy looked uneasy in the same way in which a murderer looks at pictures of his victims, Harry thought it was quite appropriate.
Now Harry was squirming slightly, standing next to his bed. He should have at least sent the note from his living room, for them to have this talk in his bedroom was much too intimate. “Well, yes, er–“ he decided to sit down on the bed as well, and Malfoy moved to give him space, or to get away from him. His pullover brought out how tan he was from the neck, and Harry had trouble shifting his gaze away from the sight.
When he arrived in his office, Evergrey was already there. “Any news on Dubois?” Harry asked tiredly even though he already knew the answer, barely 15 minutes had passed. Patrick seemed to guess his thoughts, “The day is still young, Blackburn and Twigs are getting on it now.”
“No, er, not all alone,” Harry looked back at Rose a tad uncomfortably, and lowered her back on the ground, “I was with a… friend.” Harry felt a red blush creeping on his ears, “Rose, meet Draco Malfoy.” Harry motioned towards the man, and Rose followed the movement with her curious eyes to look at Malfoy.
He nodded slowly. So Slughorn was retiring then, Harry was surprised that it had taken him this long, Horace wasn’t a young man when Harry and Dumbledore had gone and tried to convince him to return to Hogwarts as the Potions Master, and that was twelve years ago. Maybe it was good that he was finally re-entering his retirement days, good for the students, especially. Then Harry realized something. “That would make you the Head of Slytherin house, too, no?”
“It’s a tea room, one of few that are open this late,” Malfoy replied. Indeed, it was eleven o’clock at night, and only two other people were sitting on the other side of the room, sipping their tea and engaging in quiet conversation. “So have you decided what you’re going to be having?”
“Spectacular? I’m blushing,” Harry smiled wide, and leaned back on the towel, his elbows digging into the sand underneath. Malfoy gave him a sore glance from the corner of his eye, and punched Harry gently on the shoulder, that only made Harry laugh. In that moment, he couldn't remember one single of his worries.
“I know, I’m sorry,” Malfoy replied, and gave a bashful look in Harry’s direction, he seemed to regret his automatic aversion towards the Weasleys. It wasn’t his fault, Lucius must have brainwashed him with all kinds of rubbish since he was small. Harry noticed that they were both a tad out of breath from climbing the streets, fortunately they came to a level point, which led them through a well gardened park with streetlights and the sweet scent of flowers wafting through the air.
Malfoy quirked his eyebrow. “I suppose that’s fair. I have to admit I was a bit of a dickhead at school,” he lifted the scone to his mouth and took a bite, frowning like he was deep in thought.
“You’re right, it doesn’t make sense,” Rivers said, and then continued in a low voice, “but can you blame her for wanting to get her family back together?” Regrettably, Harry agreed with her. If one had a family, they couldn’t be blamed for wanting to get it together indeed.
Harry was holding the Triwizard Cup, which was glowing gently in his hand. He was standing at a graveyard, but there was thick fog everywhere, hindering Harry from seeing anything clearly. He was filled with a sense of urgency and panic, there was something he had to do, and it was important. There were shadows moving just beyond Harry’s line of vision, and he couldn’t make out what they were, he tried to yell but when he opened his mouth there was no sound. Harry looked down and saw that his pant legs were wet in shallow water, the graveyard had disappeared, and he was now standing in the Black Lake. The Triwizard Cup in his hand had turned into a ring with an M on it, but Harry couldn’t make out if it was the Malfoy or the Marigold family ring. He had trouble keeping his eyes open, as if there was a bright light shining from somewhere, and all around him he sensed that something was going on – he sensed people nearby, talking loudly, but Harry couldn’t make out what they were saying, as if they were speaking gibberish. Suddenly he heard the words again,
Their boots hit the vestibule mat with a thump. The light inside was blinding compared to the flickering streetlights of the park. Harry flicked his wand to dim them. A familiar warmth wrapped around him as he shook off his outer cloak and hung it on a stand next to his front door. His house was simple and cosy, and roomy, perhaps a bit too roomy for just him. Why had he thought he needed four bedrooms? The real-estate witch had been very keen on him having them though.
Malfoy raised his hands halfway, “I didn’t say anything,” he defended himself. They took a right turn on another steep street, the houses blocking the view of the sea.
“Something like that,” Harry nodded and dragged his eyes to meet Malfoy’s once again, if he looked away now it would incriminate him; he wasn’t sure what he was guilty of, but it was something he didn’t want the git to know.
Roughly six hours later Harry had managed to cram through four interviews, three witches and one wizard, who had been at the scene of the arrest. He had barely had time to have lunch between the third and the fourth interviewee, and was now feeling drained and sick of repeating the same questions over and over again. He had found some solid leads though, but they would have to wait until tomorrow, for there was still one interviewee left, and the clock was already past three.
he was so affected by the Dementors, but Harry couldn’t provide an explanation that would make sense. He barely understood it himself.
the only Healer in St Mungo’s, no matter how much you’d want it to be me spoon-feeding you pudding.” Malfoy crossed his arms on his chest with an arrogant smirk.
The corridor was quiet, only a few Aurors passing by from time to time, their footsteps quiet on the carpeted floor. Patrick started immediately, “The guy is impossible! He is dodging everything I throw at him, bloody cocky bastard,” he hissed, maybe to prevent Ridgenorth from hearing, or perhaps he didn’t want any other Auror to hear how miserably the pair was doing at a standard interrogation. They were supposed to be professionals for Merlin’s sakes.
After reluctantly making his way back up the stairs and taking a left again, Harry found himself standing on a small, round plaza. There was a modest fountain in the middle, the statue distantly resembling a phoenix, but looking at it quickly, it could have been any bird. The water from its beak was flowing peacefully, gently rippling in the pool at the bottom. On the other side of the square, the street continued into what seemed to be a forest of sorts, with tall green trees towering behind the houses surrounding Harry. He knew he was in the right place when he gave a glimpse at the buildings around him, they were all stores of sorts, stores whose names he couldn’t pronounce, and even if he could, wouldn’t know what they meant. One of them seemed to sell cauldrons, another was specialized in magical pets, one just looked like a regular corner store.
Malfoy shot Harry a sharp look, like he was trying to perform Legilimency on him. Harry was grateful that we was a passable Occlumens, although he didn’t exactly feel anyone rummaging through his mind. If it came to it, there was nothing really to find in his mind, not anymore. His life was as dull as anyone’s, if not more even. Harry felt some sort of comfort knowing that his boring old routines were very far from what his life had once been. Be that as it may, he wouldn’t appreciate Malfoy getting his hands on his feeling of nibbling loneliness and melancholy.
But the worst thing were the dementors. Harry had had the fortune of not meeting one in years, and here they were floating about in the dozens, if not hundreds. There was a strong shiver of cold and revolt going up Harry’s spine, as he suddenly remembered how it felt to have every good feeling you have wiped away, and the bad ones amplified. Harry tried thinking about Draco to restore at least a piece of joy in himself, but all he could think of were the problems they were inevitably going to face, and self-doubts about not being good enough for him.
When Hermione had finished her plate and had had a full glass of water to top it off, she once again used her napkin and let out a long sigh, leaning back in her chair. “I just feel so sad that you’ve had to struggle with this all by yourself, Harry,” she said, her voice sounding almost hopeless, “you could’ve come to me.” She was right, and Harry was now blaming himself for not doing so in the first place.
When they were laying on the bed, sweaty limbs intertwined, Malfoy told Harry he wanted to take the job at Hogwarts, but was too reluctant to return to the place to make up his mind. Apparently, McGonagall was still keeping the position open for him, even if it was the beginning of July already. He said he’d started to reconsider it after telling Harry about it in the pub all those months ago. Harry squeezed his hand, but didn’t say anything. He couldn’t force Malfoy into something he didn’t want to do.
“No, I’m sorry,” Malfoy’s response took Harry by surprise, ”I don’t know why I’m like this, I always push everyone away.” He looked positively pained in the face, and Harry felt a very strong wave of pity wash over him. He had another urge to put his hand on top of Malfoy’s, that was lying there on the table, but didn’t think it would be the right time.
They started climbing up the steps. “For my miserable love life, at least so I hear,” Harry muttered, suddenly put off by the conversation. He would much rather just stare at the scenery, and not say anything. Well, he wouldn’t mind snogging Malfoy right about now, and this seemed like a perfect spot for it. Maybe if he just went for it…
“Trust me, I know her,” Harry said confidently, “she’ll help us, I’ve never been more sure of anything.”
There was a silence, and then Malfoy shot up to his feet. “Maybe this was a mistake,” he said hastily, his eyes darting around him nervously.
There was another long pause, where Harry was trying to come up with ways to talk to Malfoy about what was happening, or not happening, between them. He couldn’t come up with an appropriate way to make such a drastic shift in tone. Harry knew how he felt, no matter how confused about it he was, but was scared to death to bring it up, he was not good in situations like these. He wished that such things could be solved with a duel or something else he was good at, like a round of Quidditch, without putting his integrity on the line.
“You couldn’t just have owled me?” Malfoy asked, incredulously, now leaning on to the counter, his arms crossed on his chest, eyes measuring Harry in a very uncomfortable way. Harry was still astounded by how different Draco looked, his golden hair casually swiped behind his ear, his neat stubble framing his face. Harry had a very sudden urge to just kiss him, for Malfoy to hold his waist and kiss him back gently. Just the two of them. But Harry was afraid that he’d turn away, say that he wasn’t okay with it, that it was inappropriate, that he was with someone else already.
“I wouldn’t miss it,” Harry shared a smile with her, but didn’t know how to continue. He didn’t want to reveal how much he had been looking forward to this. Fortunately, he didn’t have to, as George appeared to his mother’s side and squeezed her into a one-armed hug while talking to Harry.
“Great,” Harry replied, but he doubted that Hermione could hear him over the traffic and the general commotion that was going on all around them.
“What an astute observation on your part, Potter,” Malfoy said, but his voice was lacking its usual edge. The man was standing awkwardly in the middle of the hallway, a few steps away from Harry, seemingly trying to avoid sharing a look. Instead, he was staring at the rug that he was standing on.
Turns out he was right, and as soon as they had reached the floor, one of the doors to the apartments swung open and a witch with bright red hair emerged. Before any of them could react, she started throwing hexes at them. She matched the description Malfoy had given the day before: tall, long red hair, prominent nose, thin lips. Her curse hit Crooker, who fell down the stairs in a ball of robes before Harry had cast a reflexive Protego, and Twigs hit her back with Stupefy. The witch blocked the spell and cast a load of other curses which Harry and Twigs blocked with difficulty. “What a lovely reception, this must be out culprit,” Harry muttered when a curse flew by his ear and blew up the staircase to their left with a loud bang.
Malfoy spotted an abandoned Quaffle on the side of the field, and when nobody came to claim it, he swooped to pick it up, and throw it to Harry, who somehow managed to catch it, nearly falling off his broom in the process. They took turns with one of them being a Keeper and the other a Chaser, trying to score through the three massive hoops. Soon enough they found that they were quite terrible playing both positions, when Harry only managed to block two passes, most of Malfoy’s throws not being anywhere near the three hoops. Not much better could be said of Harry, who only scored once during the whole hour – who thought Malfoy would be such a nimble Keeper?
“Of course he is,” Malfoy snorted and turned to look at the garden again, not arrogantly, just, looking at it. Once again Harry found himself alone with Malfoy; it was always a back and forth with nothing for Harry to gain.
Harry turned to Draco so fast he almost had whiplash, “You have? Why didn’t you say anything to me?” After all,
Malfoy just nodded. “I wanted to write, but I thought it would be… well, silly. I didn’t know how you felt. When you showed up here, I just, I wanted... I wanted to…”
Once the pair kicked off from the ground, Harry was positively filled with giddiness, the very recognizable feeling one got when flying on a broom around a Quidditch pitch. He had remembered he loved flying, just not exactly how much. There was a tingle on the bottom of his stomach that swell up like a balloon, finally coming out of Harry’s mouth as an excited laugh. They flew around the goal posts and up the mountain, so fast that Harry’s hair was flat on his head. They circled around each other, flying towards the sea, then towards the fields, their legs almost touching the tree tops. Harry even tried a few loops closer to the ground. He never wanted to stop. After about an hour or two, the men were dripping with sweat, and they decided to land and have some water.
A silence fell over them both, as they sipped their teas in thought. “I’m happy for you, I mean, that all sounds incredible,” Harry said suddenly, and his words made Malfoy stop halfway into spreading jam on his scone. He gave a puzzled look towards Harry, but nodded, mumbling something that could have been a
Malfoy bent down to give Harry’s neck a very gentle kiss, while slowly moving back and forth, breathing heavily. His cock was now rubbing Harry’s prostate relentlessly, while he let out silent moans. It was too much. Harry had to reach his hand to give his own cock a few jerks, to relieve his aching erection. It was the only thing it took for him to come all over himself and the sheets with a hopeless groan. He felt the muscles in his arsehole tightening around Malfoy’s cock, and sure enough, the man came panting, half collapsing, half laying on top of Harry. They were both sweaty from the heat of the night. It was confirmed, Draco
The sun was already high, and it was burning Harry’s back as he walked the now steady street. As he was admiring the houses to his left, he caught a glimpse of the glimmering sea in between the buildings. He hadn’t realized how high he was on the mountain, and couldn’t resist the urge to cross the boulevard and walk in between the houses, just to get a better look of the stunning view that was now unfolding itself in front of him. Harry went down some steps he knew he would have to go up again, and stopped to stand on a platform, not able to take his eyes off the brightly flickering water. The coast curved on his left to form a bay filled with large yachts and ships, the beach shimmering with white sand and dotted with colourful sunshades. It was breathtaking, nothing like he’d ever seen before.
“Thank you for showing up anyway,” he continued, and was hoping he’d be able to finish his speech before anyone else talked over him, “I will go straight to the point. Today I want to put forth a proposition for a judge to reinstate Lucius Malfoy’s previous sentence of time served in prison, rather than an execution.” Harry’s hands were starting to sweat, and he tried to muster every bit of confidence he had to deliver his points. He would have to reap the majority’s vote in order to go forward, and right now it didn’t seem all too likely. The people in front of him didn’t look too happy to even be in this meeting, let alone question their original decision.
“Go ahead, Potter, amuse me,” Malfoy leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms on his chest. Now he turned to look at Harry, and his eyes monitored his face observantly. For some reason, Malfoy’s stare made Harry feel very in the spotlight, and he wasn’t sure he appreciated the sensation. He had had enough of that in his life, though he had to admit that for some twisted reason, he wanted to be seen by Malfoy.
Harry scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “Uhm, apparently you… you used to be quite… for fuck’s sake, I don’t know how to say it,” he grimaced and ran a hand through his hair, his eyes searching for something to look at, anything but Malfoy.
Ever since he had realized he liked men, there had been an itch at the back of his mind he hadn’t been able to scratch, because he couldn’t pinpoint what it was. Alas, to his utter horror, Harry had the most unpleasant inkling that the insufferable, ex-Death Eater turned good, Slytherin tosspot might be exactly the thing he was craving. Maybe he just wanted to explore an avenue, maybe it was an idea just for himself, a thought to be kept locked away forever. And ever.
for advice in the matters of the heart that concerned her own son? Clearly it was, but lately Harry had been feeling like he was drowning in a sea of his emotions, and that Narcissa was a life raft he desperately needed to get his head from under the water. Some of Malfoy’s dramatics had clearly rubbed off on Harry.
for Malfoy to be his… dance partner at this point, and anything else beyond that point. None of it was in Harry’s control, he had wanted to get rid of Malfoy from the start, but he would have never guessed the cost at which his wish would come true.
On Friday Harry was sitting in one of the armchairs in front of his office fireplace, leafing through the arrest report he was just about to file, when there was a knock on his door. For a second, Harry’s pulse sped up, even though he already knew it wasn’t going to be Malfoy, his knock was more demanding. He turned out to be right, when Evergrey appeared in the doorway.
Right now, Ron just sighed very deeply and leaned against the doorway, “Yeah, I suppose…” he was staring into the mid distance, perhaps at Hermione. Before he was going to start at the subject again, Harry decided to intervene with the actual thing he wanted to talk to Ron about.
They were both only wearing their pants, and Draco took Harry’s hand, much like all those months ago Harry had done to him, and all but leapt the steps upstairs. Harry followed him obediently, but once they had made it there, he made a motion to pull the man back towards him. In one swift motion, before Malfoy could even realize what had happened, he was already in Harry’s arms, being carried onto his bed. He was heavier than he looked, and he instinctively wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. “Merlin, Potter, no need to show off,” the man huffed once he had been put back down, but rolled over in the bed to give Harry space.
They anchored in a shaded place in a small fold that was on the side of the larger cove. Even though it was only ten minutes from the beach, it was almost completely silent, the solid rock blocking any sounds coming from the shore. Malfoy plopped down on the sofa and leaned back, propping his legs up on the table, and picking up one of the potions books he was always reading. Harry couldn’t understand how the man had the interest to read so many books that were essentially just about his work. Sure, Harry was interested in Defence Against the Dark Arts, and was working in the field, but he couldn’t remember reading two books about it ever since he left school. There were only so many spells you could use. Now Harry got frustrated, not having brought any pastimes, so he decided to go for a swim.
Harry’s eyes probably widened a little because Malfoy continued immediately, “What? You think the rest of us don’t have lives?” he then paused and where he had been sitting rigidly upright until now, leaned back in the booth, perhaps trying to calm himself, “It was rubbish anyway, the bloke was definitely oversold by Parkinson.”
Or was the problem just Harry? Did they have too much history for it to ever work? Was there something wrong with him? Was he too nice? Was he not composed enough? Were they just too different? Whatever the reason, Harry was rolling around in his bed, changing sides every few minutes to try and find a position where the weight of the world wasn’t about to crush him. He didn’t find one.
“I was never really into politics, despite my father’s best efforts,” Malfoy started slowly, reaching his arm towards his teacup and dropping two sugars in along with some cream. “But I liked Potions, back in school, and I was good at it. Severus–“ he cut himself off, swallowed hard and frowned, “he told me that St Mungo’s had a ward just for potion healing, I don’t know, I guess the idea grew on me. After the war, and the trials, and the house arrest, I was more willing to prove myself to
“Ah, your logic once again is impeccable, my dearest one,” Draco rolled his eyes sarcastically, “what is the point of eating since you have to do it again anyway? What is the point of ever dressing when you’re going to undress again in the evening? The answer to this, of course,” Draco continued before Harry could cut him off with some tenuous comment about how ‘it wasn’t the same thing’, “is that the time in the middle matters, my point being, Christmas won’t come unless you make it yourself.”
Harry felt himself redden on the face. “Er… well… he didn't jump up and down from glee, to be honest.” He didn’t know how else to put it, quoting Lucius verbatim about what he’d said about Harry’s ‘freakish ways’ didn’t seem like a good idea at the moment.
Harry supposed it must have been quite horrid to live through, but quite honestly, he had tried to think about Malfoy as little as possible these past years. And he had been successful at it, until now. He didn’t want to pity Malfoy, and he sure as shit knew that Malfoy wouldn’t want his pity, in fact, he would most likely curse Harry into oblivion if he ever so much as found out about this discussion.
When Harry walked out of the fireplace in his living room, he saw Draco shoot up from the sofa, body rigid as he took a hesitant step towards him. Harry thought that the man would have stayed with Narcissa, assuming she was a wreck, and was a tad surprised to find Malfoy now standing in the middle of his house. He took another sceptical step towards Harry, a more of a motion than an actual intention, his eyes scanning Harry apprehensively, like he was trying to decide where they stood now. Harry thought that this was not the time to start recalibrating their dynamic together, so he walked over to Draco and wrapped him in a huge hug. Apparently, that’s what the man had been waiting for, because he melted in Harry’s embrace, long arms enclosing around him, his head falling into Harry’s neck.
” Harry demanded, “What’s that supposed to mean?” The fucking audacity of Malfoy to once again show that he thought everything was about him. How was Harry toying with Malfoy? If anything, Malfoy was toying with Harry, making him doubt himself and his feelings, tripping over himself trying to make out what was happening to him.
“Where are we going?” Harry asked, now striding just behind Patrick. He thought that they would have simply Apparated to wherever they needed to be. He was excited to go catch that son of a bitch Ridgenorth, he had been on the loose for too long.
“Oh,” Malfoy replied simply, and eyed Harry with an expression that was uncomfortably knowing. Thankfully, he didn’t ask more about it, Harry didn’t really want to get into it at the moment. “So, get into any more near-death accidents lately?” Malfoy crossed his long legs, another detail Harry had noticed, and gave a very Malfoy-ish smirk.
in his head repeatedly. What could Harry do? He couldn’t show up at Malfoy’s door anymore, it was too late at night for him to pretend that he had something ordinary to talk to him about. After pacing around the room for a few circles, Harry had glanced at his desk and the quill holder sitting on top of it, and had had an idea. He had sat down at the desk and picked up a quill. People wrote about their feelings, didn’t they? That sounded like a much easier solution than going to see the git face to face.
Malfoy shrugged, all too nonchalantly for how deep red his face had gone. “If you want. I can always hex you after so you can tell everyone I lured you into a trap with my handsome looks,” he smirked, but seemed to be clinging onto the arms of the chair like he was about to fall off it.
They arrived at a side-alley of a busy street. A promenade. The sounds overwhelmed Harry for a second, after the silence of the house, even though his ears were a bit clogged from the Apparition. That didn’t usually happen, but he soon realized that it was most likely because of the difference in altitude between Malfoy’s place and the beach. The seagulls were now having a full concerto, taking daring plunges at people’s food. There were hundreds of people strolling the street by the beach front, all painted golden by the setting sun. Someone somewhere was playing the guitar and singing, but mostly the air was filled with people speaking Italian and laughing. It was one of those moments when one forgets all about their problems, for just a second.
want me to be here, but I’ve come to save your wretched life.” He fought the urge to shudder as a cold gust of wind whistled in the corners of the room, he felt as though his bones were freezing over.
“How foul, go on,” Malfoy had the audacity to say, but his smirk had vanished. Instead, he was furrowing his eyebrows, making him look almost concerned, as if he was capable of being concerned for Harry.
Just when Harry thought he’d go mad from seeing one more parchment asking for permission to release someone from custody, a memo floated onto his desk and unfolded itself. It was a permission slip from Evergrey to arrest Dargan Ridgenorth, and it already featured Kingsley’s signature. Before Harry could wonder what it meant, Patrick opened the door to Harry’s office with a bang, already wearing his Ministry cloak. “So? Are you coming or what?”
Once they got settled to a good hiding place behind some boxes in the back room, Harry glanced at the clock on the wall that was ticking loudly, fifteen minutes until Dargan was supposed to arrive. Harry decided to take this time with Patrick to tell him how well he thought he was leading the case. “I have to say Patrick, the way you’re handling this arrest, and the whole case… I think you’re doing a really good job of it,” Harry said in a low voice, constantly gripping his wand.
“Right… er, but everyone’s going to be happy, yeah? So what’s the problem?” Harry couldn’t see the connection. Everyone would surely be thrilled for them, just like they were the last time. Harry was in fact a little annoyed at how selfish Ron was being, he himself was dying to have such news to share. To be able to announce that he was going to be a dad, and in Ron’s case, a second time already.
“No don’t say that,” Ginny waved Harry’s comment away with her hand “you got me, right? And even if that door is definitely closed, you’re still a lovely person.” It was true that he had gotten Ginny, how had that happened again? They had talked a few times after which Harry had been obsessed with Ginny for ages, before she decided to grace Harry with her affections. She even made the first move by kissing him! For fuck’s sakes.
more specifically at the International Magical Office of Law, and after starting to work there two and a half years ago, she had already been promoted twice, without so much as a whisper from Harry’s end.
“They used to always be rough from flying, guess they smoothed back when I stopped,” he said. That was something already, flying, something they had in common.
,” Harry raised his voice again and gestured at the surroundings with his arms on the last word. He was mad and he was tired of Malfoy always playing the victim card, if anyone there was a victim it was Harry. Victim of his parents’ murder, victim of Voldemort, victim of the Malfoy family, and definitely the victim of Draco Malfoy right at this fucking moment.
Harry was wracking his brain trying to come up with a smooth way to tell Draco he very much wanted to kiss him, and maybe get into his pants, even if that came later?
“You’ve chosen the wrong man for that,” Malfoy replied simply, without a hint of daring in his eyes. No evidence that he ever even thought about being honest about the situation, about his feelings. It was the last night before he left for Merlin’s sakes, and Harry had already admitted to feeling the same way, what was the problem here? Besides…
After Draco had come to, Harry quickly cast a wandless cleaning charm, as he was frankly too lazy to get out of bed to get his wand.
“You haven’t seen anything yet, Malfoy,” Harry replied challengingly, and rolled over to pin the man’s hands above his head on the bed.
The man looked at a loss for words. His expression was still cross, but his mouth was searching for a retort that wasn’t coming. “I–“
To be honest, Harry didn’t remember much after that. He remembered landing on top of a car before falling onto the street. He remembered Evergrey running up to him, shocked at seeing the knife that was sticking out of his side. Harry tried mumbling that it had hit the notebook in his pocket, but was not sure if Patrick understood him.
That night Harry was sent off with a ton of leftovers and new ideas about how to deal with things in his life. Now he just needed courage to implement them. When Harry Apparated onto his street, he was a little disappointed to not see anyone waiting for him on his doorstep this time. Except now he didn’t attempt to repress that feeling, but tried to accept it for what it was.
“How’s Rosie’s flying? She still doing it?” Harry asked when Ron returned. He was fidgeting with the coaster in his hand while sipping on the new pint. He’d love to take her flying for real sometime, after her first year at Hogwarts, be fun uncle Harry. Was it a problem if one also wanted to be fun dad Harry? That was clearly a question to be dealt with at home while lying in bed alone in the dark.
The man was interrupted by Harry, who surged forward to kiss him. He really, truly never wanted to leave, and might as well take all of the opportunities he could get to kiss Malfoy. He tangled his fingers in the man’s hair, and pulled their faces even closer together, somehow ending up sitting in his lap. What had started as a quick snog had quickly developed into something more personal, something that enclosed the desperate passion the two didn’t want to end. Somehow Malfoy’s swimming trunks wound up on the floor with his espadrilles, Harry in between his legs, sucking him dry. He held on to the man’s trembling, tan thighs as he came, in the privacy of their cove. If every day could be like this.
Turned out, flying did do that, for a while. As soon as Harry kicked off the ground of the Quidditch field, all of his worries vanished once more. In his mind he was transported back to the Quidditch matches of his first years, nothing to lose, and everything to gain. His only worry being Slytherin winning over Gryffindor, and the endless gloating that would inevitably follow from Malfoy’s end. Except now, he was flying
“Thank you for recognizing my efforts, Hermione. You’re right, even if Harry here had any taste – which, of course, he doesn’t – I don’t think there’s anything that would get him to actually go through the effort of conjuring all this up.”
Harry nodded awkwardly. “Yes, I do, but I was only doing what was right.” Apparently he had to say it anyway, as always.
Harry cast an organizing charm on his parchments and they floated neatly in piles on every conceivable surface in his office. They were on the fireplace, on the two green lounge chairs and the side table, on his giant wooden desk and on the two brown wood and black leather chairs in front of his desk, on the window ledge and on top of his bookcase, some even had the audacity to settle on the red Indian rug when there was no more space left. The portrait of Theseus Scamander next to the fireplace, a previous Head Auror in the 1920s, was watching the parchments flying about, but didn’t say anything. Harry decided to not fight it and let the parchments sit where they were, he’d get to them later.
He then quickly returned to the safety of his side of the sizeable desk and made a hand gesture offering Malfoy to sit down. The chair without the parchment stack pulled out to indicate its availability. Harry took pleasure in seeing Malfoy’s eyes widen just a little seeing Harry perform magic without his wand. He was happy to gain an upper hand in their lifelong rivalry. In that vein, Harry conjured up the report, an empty scroll for notes, and a quill and some ink. Malfoy sat down, eyeing the room and the parchment stacks that were still sitting on the other chairs and tables.
At eleven, everyone was seated. There was an anxious ripple of conversation going over the room, as what seemed like the whole Ministry were squeezed into the round courtroom. The Wizengamot was not in session, leaving that section of the room currently empty, while all of the people wanting in were left trying to place themselves every which way into the seats that would allow them to follow the trial. Hermione was sitting next to Harry, but Ron had been busy with something Harry had not really paid attention to when Hermione had explained it. Draco and Narcissa were sitting at the other side of the room, both of them pale as ghosts, while the people around them were giving them unconcealed stares and murmuring something amongst each other. Draco was making nervous glances towards Harry, who tried to look encouraging.
“But why? What is this, Harry?” This question was much less unexpected and yet much more difficult to answer. Harry didn’t know what to say – he didn’t know what Malfoy was expecting him to say, he only knew what he felt, and he fully well realized the unlikeliness that his desires would ever come true. What did he want? A stable family life, kids, a house with a yard, a job that was less demanding. Before he had found it improbable, now, with Malfoy, it felt almost impossible. It felt like the two just weren’t meant to ever settle down with each other, they lived in different countries for Merlin’s sakes! And that wasn’t even near the discussions they would have to have about everything, Harry didn’t have the faintest clue of what the man even wanted from his future. Maybe that was a good place to start.
section, a name popped up, some guy named Rory Birch had previously been caught many times for selling all kinds of stolen junk. That had to be him, and even if it wasn’t, maybe he would know who else was in the business, and would be willing to get rid of some competition.
Draco’s cheeks were pink and damp as he was nodding slowly and lifting Harry’s hands to his lips to kiss them. Harry found that his own eyes were burning with tears too, and he didn't want to let go of Draco to wipe the first hot streak off his face. He gently pulled the blond man into his lap, and ran his hands up his sides to eventually tangle in his hair, looking straight into his grey eyes. Draco was a warm weight against him, soft skin making Harry want to kiss him all over.
Patrick just snorted, he was also holding his wand at the ready. “Don’t tempt me, Potter. I am just as fine working under a brilliant wizard like you.” The kinds words were surprising and, in Harry’s opinion, completely undeserved. He didn’t know what to say for a while, the seconds ticked away in the clock.
“Why? Because I’m a former Death Eater and an insufferable bastard?” Harry would’ve expected the man’s tone to be much more scathing, but he was surprisingly quite composed, like he was talking about the weather. Malfoy was still looking at the garden, away from Harry.
“Tempting, but I don’t think I will. Perhaps another time.” Malfoy said coldly and straightened his already immaculate robes. Then he politely nodded Harry goodbye and left his yard, striding over to the street. Before Disapparating, he turned around expecting Harry to have already gone inside, but was perhaps surprised to see him still standing there, staring back at him. They exchanged a look that only lasted a second, before Malfoy was away again with the usual crack.
“No, it’s quite alright,” Harry said as calmly as he could, trying to appease Narcissa, “I’m going to go straight to the point,” he didn’t want to keep the woman in suspense, “it has come to pass that I have been removed from the investigation that you’re currently involved in.” Harry saw that the obvious question was already on Narcissa’s lips, so he chose to go ahead and continue, “The Minister believes that there is a conflict of interest between me and this family, your family, due to my and Draco’s history of being schoolmates, and obviously because of the trials right after, and I think it unwise to disagree.” Harry tried his best to justify the decision, even though he himself was still fairly pissed off that he had been dismissed. Be that as it may, he knew that there was nothing he could do to fight the outcome, and now he had to stand behind it. Narcissa merely nodded slowly to show she understood and apparently didn’t have anything against it.
“What? No, ‘course not. You were good mate, but I meant more like… Ginny, and Fred and George,” Harry couldn’t help cringing internally when Fred’s name escaped his mouth. The whole Weasley family was very sensitive about his death and they rarely brought it up. Maybe it was their way of trying to move on, but Harry couldn’t help but wonder if that’s what Fred would have wanted for his family and his memory. Be that as it may, it was their business, not Harry’s.
“It’s not a barter system,” Hermione’s shrill voice made Harry’s arm hair stand up. She could be very frightening when she wished to be. It seemed that even when Ron couldn’t get over Malfoy’s horrendous past, Hermione was clearly able to at least see past them, for now. Harry sensed that there would be a long conversation to be had about the subject, later.
Malfoy looked at the motion attentively, Harry knew that Malfoy knew that he was nervous. “Right, so… you were there for… me?” the man caught on quickly, but seemed to cringe a bit saying it. That did seem to be the implication that Harry was trying to get across. Now the man also swiped his hair off of his face and changed the positioning of his legs to dangle the other one off the bed.
Harry just nodded, and while they were heading towards the Atrium, more Aurors joined their way. The lot turned some heads striding through the lobby of the Ministry in their Auror robes. Eventually there were about ten of them standing in front of the outgoing fireplaces. Harry saw Blackburn, Rivers, McGallon, Buckthorn, Twigs, Crooker, and a few others. They were all wearing their Ministry cloaks, expressions tense, and eyes vigilant. They were the best of the best, everyone proven themselves time and again – if they wouldn’t catch this bastard today, Harry would eat the memo granting this mission.
His one slip-up all those years ago had taught him to speak very clearly every time he travelled by Floo, not wishing to slide out of the fireplace in Borgin and Burkes again. He threw the powder onto his feet, and green flames swallowed him whole. The next second, he was already in another place, a familiar office with its bookcases and armchairs. It was absolutely, positively
Harry gave a defeated sigh. “I promised George to try his new ageing potion for the shop, only the effect didn’t wear off after thirty minutes as promised,” he muttered in annoyance. He wasn’t annoyed at George as such, more at himself for always agreeing to everything, and definitely at Malfoy for being a git about the whole affair.
never want to leave, and I’ve only been here for less than a day.” Harry took a large gulp of his water, only to remember that it was carbonated.
“I can’t believe I didn’t think about this earlier,” Harry huffed as he strode to pull some parchment and a self-writing quill from his book case drawer. The quill immediately started drafting up a note.
The first course was a dish called the arugula salad, which featured mushrooms and prosciutto as the main ingredients. Even when Harry felt his appetite completely gone, he found himself scooping up the first dish, probably not the way this food should be eaten. The pair only shared some positive remarks about the flavour, and otherwise concentrated on not thinking the obvious. Harry just wanted to spend the evening like any other night, not feeling like he was about to give something up very soon.
Along with it being utterly bewildering to find that his legs had not carried Harry as they should have, it was also the most inopportune moment for someone to enter the room. It wasn’t so much someone as it was his Healer, and it wasn’t so much his Healer as it was Draco sodding
“Right,” Harry wasn’t sure how to continue, “anyway, er, I had to bring Cedric’s body back, so I Accio’d the cup and it transported me back to school.” The marching band music was still echoing in his ears, suddenly permeated by the horrified scream of Fleur realizing the horrific fate of Cedric.
Harry gave out a deep sigh and leaned back in the chair. “I didn’t want to be admired, I just wanted to be normal,” he lifted the tea to his lips to comfort him, such a pathetic thing to be upset about, this wasn’t the time or the place, “besides,
As Scot sat down, Mrs Ackerman stepped forward, clutching a stack of documents in her arms. “That is correct, Your Honour.”
Now the man snorted and gave an amused side glance at Harry. “It was mayhem at first,” he shook his head to himself, “but Moretti showed me the ropes, despite our little language barrier, it’s fine now.” Malfoy went silent, it didn’t seem like he was going to continue, even though Harry could have listened to him talk for hours. Now Harry wondered if Malfoy knew Italian, and how absolutely lovely it would be if Harry ever happened to catch him taking with Moretti, or anyone, in the local language.
Narcissa nodded slowly. “I did, I know it’s not obvious to you, but I know you did,” she said quietly, and took another sip from her tea. Had Malfoy told her something? Had he talked about Harry to his mother, even now? What had he been saying? All of these questions and more needed answering in Harry’s head. So Malfoy, however fleetingly, had had feelings for Harry, and had apparently been noticeably more content when he had been able to bump heads with Harry again. Still, Harry felt uncertain.
Kingsley rolled his eyes, “Oh, piss off, before I change my mind,” he muttered and shook his head at Harry, before returning to the enormous stack of papers on his desk, quill in his hand. Whatever he was doing, it did not look like pleasant work, and Harry swore again that he’d never want Kingsley’s job. Too much paperwork, too much of it.
“He agreed,” Harry said immediately, not wanting to keep Draco in suspense for one second longer than necessary.
Harry wasn’t sure whether to go inside or not. “I’m sorry, can I help you?” he asked. Usually Malfoy went straight to the point after the first insult, one of his better qualities. However, he seemed unsure what to do now that Harry had turned up.
“You’re not indebted to me, Draco,” Harry said firmly, but his eyes were darting around the room, not wanting to settle on the blond man. Harry hated the very idea of him holding something over Draco, and he hated that either of them would feel that way.
“Twigs, help me get Patrick into the Emergency Department of St Mungo’s,” Harry said and went over to Evergrey. He swung the man’s arm over his shoulder and Twigs mirrored the motion. Harry undid the Anti-Disapparition Jinx, and in the next moment they were off to a swirl.
“Yes, Harry?” Patrick adopted a very honeyed tone, straightening himself and taking a glance at Ridgenorth, who clearly only now realized the gravity of his little outburst.
“I did,” the man said blatantly, but smirked at Harry, before turning his face away again. There was a long pause where Harry was just measuring Draco’s face with his eyes before he continued, “One could say that you were my general sore spot.” Before Harry dared to ask what it meant, Draco was already continuing, his brows frowned at the doorway, and he pulled his arms from under the sheets to lay on top of the covers, “One word about you would get me all riled up, but one word
But the git’s face turned from tight embarrassment to something more relaxed and he snorted. “Keep on dreaming, Potter.”
Then, “Merlin, Potter, you don’t have to be so nervous. If nothing else, it’s against my Hippogriffic Oath to off you on duty,” Malfoy huffed and shook his head, taking a step back and tugging the stethoscope off. Harry hadn’t realized that his heart had been racing, and was unpleasantly aware that it had little to do with being afraid that Malfoy would do something malicious to him. He felt his face heat up. “Well, at least there’s nothing wrong with the blood circulation to your face,” Malfoy added mortifyingly and marked something on the clipboard, before taking his wand out of his pocket. It wasn’t Malfoy’s wand. It was white and straight and plain.
“Yes please, red for both, and a bottle of sparkling water, please,” Malfoy said and flashed the man a polite smile. He returned the gesture and disappeared into the kitchen. Even though the man looked more like himself tonight, Harry couldn’t place his behaviour with anything he’d ever seen or experienced before. Malfoy was pleasant. People knew him, he was nice to others.
Harry swooped to take Malfoy’s hand, who gave him a very Malfoy-ish you’re-being-a-complete-tit look. “I hardly think this is going to–“ and then Harry Sidealonged him.
“What’s your favourite memory of Hogwarts?” Harry asked after a while. Maybe Draco could do with some good thoughts about the place, there must have been some nice ones, right? Even though Harry was afraid for his life half the time, Hogwarts had still given him the happiest memories of his life: the first Christmas morning at the school, when Molly Weasley had sent him a jumper, his first present Christmas present ever, Harry remembered being so absolutely flabbergasted and grateful at the gesture he could’ve cried. Another happy one was catching the snitch in his first ever Quidditch game, even though his broom had been bewitched by Quirrel. He had had his first kiss at the school, with Cho. Surely Malfoy would have had pleasant memories as well.
Harry’s pulse quickened again, his heart had an unpleasant habit of doing that nowadays whenever he heard the Malfoy name being mentioned. He cleared his throat, trying to steady his voice, which made him receive a weird look from Patrick, “Well… I think it’s safe to say that Narcissa, er, Malfoy was only at the wrong place at the wrong time, in my opinion we can rule her out as a suspect.”
Right, what was Harry going to do with two pairs of Extendable Ears and chocolates laced with love potion?
“Well, in that case, thanks,” Harry forced out the polite reply even with how unnatural it sounded. He moved his gaze to his arms, which he was now trying to move. They felt stiff and were aching still when he lifted them slowly from his sides onto his stomach and back. He wiggled his toes and shuffled his feet underneath the sheets. “So… what happened to me exactly?” he asked carefully, feeling foolish that he had to interview Malfoy of all people about his condition.
“Please, I’m my father’s son, and he knew everything, so naturally, I knew everything,” the blond man just waved Harry’s incredulous question away with his hand without opening his eyes. He ran his hand through his hair, and for a moment, he looked brilliant with his hair pulled back. Harry felt queasy.
Harry took an obedient sip of the fresh water in his hand, he hadn’t realized how parched his throat was. “What do you mean… finally awake?” he inquired, confused. How long had he been asleep? How long had he been in the hospital? What had really happened to him, and most importantly, was Ron okay? He was fairly sure it was Ron who he’d gone out on a mission with. And if Harry had ended up in the hospital, where was Ron? A quick shiver of panic spread from Harry’s spine to his limbs, and he propped himself up on the bed.
Rosie gave Harry a gentle hug before being carried away by Ron. They exchanged goodbyes and slid out of the door, Rose waving at Harry from Ron’s shoulder.
“I’m glad you asked,” he started, “I propose a vote, if the majority in this room think that Lucius Malfoy’s life should be spared for magical research, he will be presented in front of a judge for reconsideration of his verdict, if not, then… well, I stand defeated, but moreover, saddened that you have passed up on a fruitful research opportunity.” That there was all Harry, maybe he really
“My second summer in that room, before our second year, my uncle Vernon had bars installed onto my window so that I couldn’t leave,” Harry recounted, but left out how Dobby, the Malfoys’ house elf at the time, had Apparated into his room and essentially put in motion the series of events that had eventually caused the bars to appear in Harry’s window.
“Right, er, thanks,” Harry mumbled awkwardly once Malfoy had deemed him fit to be discharged. He felt the red of his chest rising on his face as he pulled the hospital robe back on at lightning speed.
Harry carefully walked over to the door through the dark hallway, he took a short huff of breath before cautiously opening the door. The light from his wand illuminated Draco’s white face. He looked pained, like he hadn’t slept at all, again neither had Harry. The man was white as a ghost and the unfavourable light of Lumos brought out the dark circles under his eyes. His gold and silver hair was wet from the rain, as was his travel robe. A suitcase was hovering slightly off the ground beside him. He had a determined look on his face, his grey eyes almost black, staring at Harry menacingly.
“Nonsense,” Malfoy interrupted him, waving his comment away, but not looking at Harry, “it’s been a while since I’ve had visitors,” he said, running his hand through his hair and leaning on his kitchen counter before making a careful glance in Harry’s way. He seemed… nervous, in a peculiar way. Harry didn't know his presence could have such an effect. “Er, there’s a guest room, facing the stairs, I assume you’ll at least stay the night?” Malfoy gestured to Harry’s right-hand side, where they had just appeared from downstairs.
Draco put his book away, and couldn’t help smiling at the sight of him: a little blond boy, five years old, standing in the middle of a heavily decorated sitting room, wearing dark green formal robes with gold embellishments. Maybe it was a bit much, but Draco thought he looked so handsome.
The sun was setting as Harry was strolling towards O’Malley’s, the muggle pub where him and Ron were supposed to meet. The weather was chilly but windless as he reached the establishment and walked inside. The place was still quite calm, but Harry imagined it would be packed a few hours from now. The ceiling was high and featured wood and iron chandeliers, styled after the middle ages, perhaps. The pub was roomy, and huge tables had been placed around the floor. Harry spotted Ron waving at him from one of the smaller tables near the window, and made his way over.
The store was dim, and for a moment, Harry couldn’t see anything, coming from the bright light of day. There were many smallish windows letting in daylight, illuminating the room. The store was modest in size, and it smelled like sage and something else Harry didn't necessarily care to place. The room was cool, apparently the thick stone walls kept the heat at bay, Harry was glad to get away from the heat. When his eyes got used to the dark, Harry could make out the shelves upon shelves of boxes and jars, all neatly arranged on the walls, with names and prices marked clearly. Facing the door, there was a small counter, and two doors, one of which was open.
the owner said, and his footsteps could be heard nearing the doorway. Once in the room, he stepped towards Patrick and Harry who had come out from behind the boxes. They motioned him to come hide in their place, and simultaneously started inching towards the doorway. They would have to act in seconds.
yesterday. So that’s why Malfoy was back in town, Harry had just assumed that he was back to his dubious ways. Malfoy seemed to have read Harry’s mind, because he started, “Just so you know, I’m not going to be wreaking havoc on your precious wizarding London, Potter, I am not back to my old manners, although, just how you graciously and extensively testified to the Wizengamot all those years ago, they weren’t
,” he scoffed. Lucius was sitting back straight, his cuffed wrists on his lap, chin raised, overall looking like he was trying to hold on to whatever dignity he had left, despite looking like a homeless person. Harry tried not to slouch, ignoring the cold digging into every inch of his body.
Malfoy was quiet for a moment, a little too long for Harry to not get nervous. He knew he couldn’t bear it if the man walked away now. Just when he thought Malfoy was going to shake his head and say something like
“You’ve said that before, now when has it ever been true?” Harry asked, “I’ll convince the board to rescind his conviction, turn it back to a prison sentence.”
The man was standing a bit to the side, holding the light from his wand over a stone tablet that was sticking out of the ground. “It’s a statue of Venus,” he said, voice suddenly quiet, he wasn’t looking back at Harry. He didn’t know why, who was Venus? Harry returned to look at the fountain, and raised his wand to illuminate the woman’s face: her hair was up, but a few strands were traveling down her neck and chest.
Now it was Harry’s time to cut him off: “You think I didn't want to be normal?” he protested forcefully, making Malfoy stare at him in a confused manner, “That’s all I’ve ever wanted to be, but nothing I ever got to be, it was always ‘Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived’, ‘Harry Potter the Triwizard Champion’, ‘Harry Potter the Saviour’, or ‘Harry Potter the Head Auror’,” Harry found himself going on a tangent longer than he’d expected. He was just so bloody sick and tired of Malfoy always thinking that Harry was just some git so full of himself that he was doing all of these insanely dangerous things in some desperate search for attention. Truthfully, Harry was okay with no attention at all for the rest of his life. He hated his sudden compulsive need to correct Malfoy’s opinion of him.
“Blimey Harry, er, good for you?” Patrick ran his hand through his hair and leaned back in his chair. He looked at Harry evaluatively, before nodding, “I think it’ll do you good,” he added. Harry hoped it would, too. It would do him good, or it could all go horribly wrong, but that he had to find out for himself. He tried to calm down, why was it so damn hard?
The silence was dragging on, and Harry felt a pressure to come out with what he had been asking all along, but had never received an answer. His heart was beating fast as he attempted to dry his palms off on his trousers. He drew a sharp breath, but at the last moment, he chickened out and out came something else entirely. “Er, do you want to go sit outside? It’s a beautiful day,” Harry finally understood Dobby’s habit of hitting his own head with a lamp, how was it that being with Malfoy made Harry act like a complete fool?
Now Ron was shifting from one foot to the other. “But, I suppose,” he continued stiffly, “you know, since he seems important to you, I can, er, try to get along with him, starting now,” Ron obviously tried to hold back from gritting his teeth, “even if he is a grade-A tosser.”
Finally, Harry had a small window of opportunity, and he wasn’t going to waste it. “I want you to save Lucius Malfoy, I don’t care what you do with him, stick him back to Azkaban for all I care, but don’t kill him,” he demanded steadily. If he could save the life of even one wretched Death Eater, he was going to do it. Frankly, Harry had never thought that he would be in a situation like this, pleading for the life of one of the most deplorable wizards alive, but here he was.
care about you,” he said, unsure why he was trying to convince the man, the most heinous person he had known besides Voldemort himself, to save himself, “against their better judgment I reckon,” he had to add, “Narcissa, she was a wreck when the Ministry announced their plans for the Death Eaters, and Draco… he’s affected, too, I know it.”
Judging on Malfoy’s face, however, he had indeed done so, and was now regretting it severely. “Well, since we’re all done here, excuse me while I go Obliviate myself, and I sincerely wish I never see you again,” the git mumbled and once again vanished through the curtain, ears flaming red, before giving Harry the chance to say that Draco, too, looked a lot better than he used to, and that he wasn’t so bad to begin with, either.
Harry had to admire how well Patrick was giving out orders, he was a natural. There were enough people to arrest Voldemort himself, and there was nowhere for Ridgenorth to run. Evergrey would make a fine Head Auror someday. “If you see a fireplace, seal it, there cannot be anywhere for this bastard to run, I will make sure he will not be able to Disapparate,” Patrick had gone serious as he gave a look around the room, “and make sure to be careful, we don’t know what this man is capable of. Let’s move.”
Harry thought about this for a moment. It was true that everyone back home knew the Malfoy name, and not in the good way. “You can choose to be you in England too you know,” he said, “I’m not trying to force you to come back but, you could clear your name, make it something else than your father did.” Harry wasn’t sure if it was wise to bring Lucius into the conversation, but Malfoy didn’t seem to flinch at the mention of his dad’s name.
he’s a muggle, if nothing else, I’d get prosecuted for fuck’s sakes,” Harry said in a low voice, better to not discuss magical business too loud in the place. There was the other point too, which was that Harry would never, ever, succumb to such lows as to give someone a love potion in order to get some affection. Although, if things continued in their current path, that was, dryly, he was afraid someday he’d change his mind. Also, what made Ron’s suggestion even more bizarre, was that he had been under a love potion himself, when he accidentally gorged on some chocolates laced with love potion from one Romilda Vane, targeted at Harry at the time.
Narcissa was giving a horribly evaluative look at Harry, like she was assessing whether he was boyfriend material or not, whether Draco would still care about him or not. She then leaned forward, and pulled a small woven basket from the lower level of the coffee table. Harry saw that it was full of letters, of which Narcissa now pulled out one. She handed it to Harry and gave him a look of ‘go on, open it’. The envelope had already been neatly opened with a paper knife, and now Harry pulled out a smooth letter of two pages. “The second paragraph,” Narcissa said simply, and was eyeing Harry attentively. Harry folded the letter open and directed his attention over the first paragraph, which seemed to be a description of his journey and arrival home, downwards on the paper. In incredibly meticulous penmanship, it said:
“Right, I think we have to get going, after all, it is a school night,” Ron adopted a surprisingly grown up tone, and ruffled Rose’s hair, making it even more impossibly outrageous than it already was, “we’re going to have that pint I missed soon, right?”
“Are you guys about to pass out too?” Ginny sat on the arm of Hermione’s chair and made an anguished sound. Her hair was flowing around her shoulders and contrasted the green shirt she was wearing. Both Harry and Hermione nodded, too exhausted to reply.
“She said the name in the note was Gregory Smith, we ran it through some searches but didn’t find any matches, seems like an alias.”
Hermione sighed and looked to be in search for words as they stepped into the empty elevator and requested the Atrium. “Busy, as am I, though today it’s been slow, we’re still waiting for a large batch of documents from MACUSA to be delivered so that we can get back to work.” MACUSA? Why was the lead defence attorney waiting for documents from the Magical Congress of the United States of America?
Harry straightened the flowerpot sitting on a side table next to the mirror. The kitchen and the living room of his house were painted golden by the morning sunrays. After the trials Harry didn’t want to burden the Weasleys by staying with them indefinitely, so he made the difficult decision to sell 12 Grimmauld Place. It had too many memories attached to it for Harry to ever be happy living there. With the money he purchased his current home, on the other side of London, in a peaceful neighbourhood. It was a two-storied terrace house with neighbours on both sides, but he had a back garden where Neville had helped him plant some low maintenance greens. The entrance hall was narrow, but Harry had managed to fit a closet and a neat little chair left of the door against the stairs. Charlie Weasley had sent him an exotic looking rug from Romania, which was now decorating the hardwood floor of the hallway. On the other side of the house were the living room and the kitchen with its little dining area with huge windows facing the garden, upstairs were Harry’s bedroom and a large bathroom.
Harry inspected the permission slips that had once again piled up on his desk, and sent them away one by one after scribbling his signature on them. There seemed to be more with every passing day. A few files had also found themselves on his desk for him to take a look at and provide his professional opinion on. Harry found it strange at least, since he had much less experience than some of the other Aurors asking him for his opinion. Be that as it may, Harry enjoyed thinking about something other than sodding Malfoy walking out on him, so he gladly inspected the binders on his desk. In the corner of his office, Theseus seemed to still be upset at Harry, and didn’t say as much as a ‘Good morning’ upon seeing him entering the office.
“Haven’t heard of that git in ages,” Ron was wolfing down the food on his plate, Harry placed a small forkful in his mouth, it was delicious as always. “What’s he doing in London?” Hermione gave Ron a gentle shove in the ribs, “You know it’s classified.”
“Signore Bianchi, you know I can’t resist your cooking,” Malfoy answered very warmly, like talking to a relative. They followed mister Bianchi to the back of the restaurant, where he somehow managed to come up with two chairs and a small table for the two. He fished a matchbox out of his pocket, and lit the small candle in the middle, all the while smiling at Malfoy very widely.
Six hours and a treacle tart later, they had a plan. Not a perfect plan, but a plan nonetheless. Harry was meant to go to the Ministry board meeting the next day to present his case and hope for the best. But for now, Harry and Draco said goodbyes to Hermione and Ron, of whom the latter had seemed to come around a little more in the span of the night to what they were actually doing. In fact, Ron had been the one to come up with their final idea. As the door closed behind them, leaving the pair to stand in the warm night air, Draco said, “Well, that went well, I was sure Weasley would have thrown at least one hex at me.”
He had reached the Atrium and seen Malfoy there, wearing black jeans with the same coat as before, hair gleaming brightly in the light and eyes darting nervously at the ministry workers making their way through the enormous space, even though they didn’t seem all that interested in him. He hadn’t seemed any calmer when Harry had appeared by his side, practically jumping upon hearing his name called. Once he’d noticed it was Harry, though, he soon regained his composure and settled at voicing a remark about Harry’s lateness.
Harry had barely finished the thought when there was a light but determined knock on his door, and Harry had a very brief but a very intense bout of nausea. Without fetching his wand from his robes, Harry made his office door open a few inches accompanied with his
“I don’t care what you prefer,” Harry snapped, “I just said I’ve come here to spare you, so shut up and listen to me,” the relentless presence of the Dementors made him even more irritable than he already would’ve been in the situation, “I’m here on behalf of the Ministry–“
Harry decided to ignore the obvious question, he didn’t want to seem too eager to know where Malfoy had been all these years, and instead went for the boring one. “So, you’ve been here before?”
Harry felt a smile spread across his face, but his hands were still trembling. He hoped Draco wouldn't notice. “Yeah, I’dlikethat,” he mumbled, simultaneously excited for and terrified of another date with the blond man who made his heart race like mad.
“That was what I came here to tell you, and Mr. Scamander’s statement here confirms our suspicions,” Patrick said and stood up from his chair, straightening his robes, “and another thing, Rivers got a hit on Dargan’s whereabouts, we’re moving in soon, I’ll let you know how it goes.”
Harry took Malfoy’s hand, like a little child wanting to show his friend something. But Draco didn’t let go, or comment on it. Right now, they were both feeling the same thing, a sense of unavoidability, and the realization that this might well be the last thing the two would ever share. Harry strode up the stairs with Malfoy following right in his footsteps, and led him to the bedroom whose door was open for them.
Malfoy took a deep breath like he was gearing up to something. “Because… you seemed different too,” he confessed, looking at his hands like they were the most interesting things in the world. He was turning one of his silver rings around his finger absentmindedly, “slightly less annoying… and maybe I happened to see you without a shirt on when they first wheeled you into the hospital,” he lifted his head to smirk at Harry nervously, “not bad”.
Harry’d have to investigate further, so he picked up the book and slid it into his robe’s inner pocket. He then walked over to the stove, and upon extending his hand to touch the kettle lying on top of it, realized it was still hot. Before he could so much as finish his thought, the first curse flew by his ear. Someone behind him blasted the cupboard beside the stove into pieces with Confringo.
Sexy? Harry wasn’t trying to be sexy, he just wanted to know the truth. Was Malfoy expecting Harry to be waiting for him, rose petals on his bed…
Now they came to a large square, filled with restaurants and lively people, sitting at tables, laughing and clinking their wine glasses. Harry loved how busy the city was even in the middle of the week, the people were there to have a good time with their friends after a long day at work. Harry wished he could forget about his job after he got home in the evening, wished he had friends to go to restaurants with on a Tuesday, wished it wasn’t just him and the gym from Monday to Friday. “Why not forever?” Malfoy’s question jostled Harry out of his thoughts.
Currently Harry and Ron were on their fourth round of drinks, and Harry was feeling quite intoxicated at that point, it was only 11pm, too. The blond guy was sitting with a group of people in one of the larger tables, and Harry couldn’t help noticing that he was stealing glances of the bloke. With every gulp of alcohol, he started to look more and more like Malfoy, and Harry didn’t know how or why. He had already established that he didn’t hate the man, and was quite honestly a little impressed by him, but… but
“And I think we both know I’m not going to talk about it,” came the simple answer, what an arrogant bastard Malfoy was. He was sprawled out in the chair in his usual manner, but seemed tense. The sunlight fell on his hair and his face, bringing out the slight tan that he had gathered back in Italy, it had faded during his time in Britain. The git’s face was sulking as always, and he didn’t even look in Harry’s direction.
and a green light flashed all around him. There was a splash, and when Harry looked down, it wasn’t Cedric lying dead at Harry’s feet, it was Malfoy.
After Narcissa’s teary performance, Harry thought, even Lucius had to believe that he had been missed, hell, even Draco had showed up to meet him, and he hadn’t visited Azkaban to see him in years, maybe ever. “It’s hard to return, I suppose,” Harry said, trying not to think of the little fact that he’d told Lucius about him and Draco when he visited him, “when you’ve been away for so long. He’ll come around.”
thought that Harry had made him livelier, had made him happier. A wave of chills washed over Harry, as he thought about being with Draco, thought about kissing him, touching him, smelling his hair, feeling his warmth, hearing his name spoken. It was something Harry yearned for, every minute of every day. Hermione had been right as always, he was love sick. He was sick and there was only one cure. In one swift motion, Harry was up from the sofa – he knew what he had to do.
Harry had thought that it wasn’t his place as Malfoy’s guest to just invade his bedroom: if he wanted him there, he could just ask. Harry would have been very pleased to say yes. But when the moment came, they were both just standing there, staring just past the other. Harry couldn't think of one thing to say that could imply that he would very much like to join Malfoy upstairs, and after a few seconds too many, he muttered something like
year already. I think we’ve both moved on,” Harry wanted to add that they had been good friends before they started dating too, but didn’t want to sound like he was trying to convince Ron too much. Because he wasn’t. He knew for certain that he didn’t want to get back together with Ginny, their problems wouldn’t have disappeared. He still loved her as a friend, but that’s what had driven them apart in the first place. In a sense Harry wanted to see Ginny again, know how she was, have a regular conversation, he just hoped it wouldn’t be awkward.
Harry could only breathe when Dargan’s shadow disappeared from the doorway as he moved towards the counter, behind which Crooker and McGallon were hunching.
On his way out, Harry threw on a long dark grey wool coat and took a last look in the mirror. He was perhaps a bit overdressed for the occasion, but he didn’t have the time to worry about it anymore. Harry walked out of the door and Disapparated from the street.
“How are you feeling?” Hermione placed a small green flowerpot with yellow daffodils on his side table, and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek as well, before sitting on the bed beside Harry’s feet, “we talked to a Healer outside and she told us that they mended your bones, what you did was really reckless Harry!” Hermione had to have been a nervous wreck, that’s when she usually couldn’t help but scold people right after making sure they were okay. Harry felt bad for putting her through that, Evergrey too. He would really have to start thinking about other people besides himself when it came to doing dangerous things.
Instead of looking happy, or hopeful, the man just looked away, seeming pained by the mention of Draco and Narcissa. “They don’t care about me,” his voice was suddenly hoarse, like it was stuck to his throat. Harry could’ve sworn Lucius was trembling, though that might have just been the cold.
At home, he collapsed onto the sofa. It felt as though every joint in his body was aching, his toes still frozen from the cold, shivering, and feeling like no happy feeling was ever going to cradle him again. The warmth of his living room was the first comforting thing he noticed, when his limbs started warming up again. Of course, he knew the dreary feelings wouldn't last forever, but he couldn’t help the wave of anxiety washing over him as he saw Draco emerge from the kitchen, feeling like the only things they would ever face were problems.
Once Harry had finished his Auror training, ready to start hunting down the lowlifes of London, they had put him and Ron on desk duty for the first year. Neville had already left to study Herbology – ‘more his speed’ according to him – and Ron had told Harry that if he was going to leave him to study some similar bollocks he would personally arrest him the day he got his clearance. They stuck through it together, and they suffered the desk duty, before finally being paired off with senior Aurors for some routine rounds.
is what I want,” Harry squeezed Draco’s hands gently but firmly, and couldn’t tear his eyes away from him, “you make me happy, you make me so
Magical Cooperation,” Hermione reminded him, adopting her familiar pedantic tone, “in this case, there are some American citizens being held in Britain that need legal help, and once we get the appropriate paperwork we can start doing what we do best.”
Harry apparated into Knockturn Alley along with Evergrey, Crooker, and Twigs. It was the early afternoon, but the place was deserted. After Voldemort was defeated and his supporters dispersed, many of the shops closed or were closed by the Ministry, and now Knockturn Alley was only a shadow of its infamous past. Still, some of the apartments in the run-down buildings were occupied, and Crooker had located Dubois to be in one of those apartments using a tracking spell.
Now Harry spoke, for the first time after quickly introducing himself and Patrick when they came in. Of course, Ridgenorth already knew who he was, but there was no telling what the memory potion had done to his mind. “We know that’s a lie, you and Dubois framed her, isn’t that right?” Harry strolled to take Patrick’s place in front of the interrogation table, while his partner retreated to where he had been standing and observing.
“Right, well, thanks for the tea, I will be going,” was the last thing Malfoy said to Harry. One last look was exchanged between the two men, past rivals, present acquaintances, future …? No one knew. There was a certain finality to it that made Harry feel very empty. Then, without so much as a goodbye, Malfoy disappeared through the front door, the faint crack of Disapparition echoing in from outside. Once again, Harry was alone, standing in his hallway, but for the first time, it felt like he had lost something.
Two hours later, Harry had had at least four mugs of tea (chamomile since Hermione always advertised its calming effects, though Harry couldn't say he felt them), had managed to tidy up his kitchen somewhat, and arranged his sock drawer by colour ranging from various dark shades to black and then to grey. Just when Harry had started to wonder what was taking Draco so long – perhaps Lucius had managed to hex his ears off somehow and he was now in St. Mungo’s getting them fixed – he heard the Floo go downstairs, and leapt down the steps to see Draco stumble out of the fireplace in Harry’s living room, and sink down on the sofa like he was never going to get up again.
He nodded. “They did, but that was two years later.” When he with Dumbledore’s Army infiltrated the Ministry and accidentally destroyed the Time Room, oh well, best not to dwell in the past.
The entire conversation was so backwards it made Harry’s head spin. Trying his best to keep his composure, Harry got up from the chair, knees nearly buckling when he straightened himself. “I think it’s best I was on my way, you know how it is with work and whatnot,” Harry found himself blabbering and backing away towards the hallway.
The last two days Harry had been preoccupied with what Narcissa had told him. That Malfoy had not only been obsessed with him in school, but that he might be again. What always came back around in Harry’s mind was Narcissa describing the way in which Malfoy had been fixated on everything Harry did. That it wasn’t only resentment and envy, but that it might have been something else as well. What else? There was one answer lurking in the back of Harry’s mind, but it was absurd, totally ridiculous an idea for Harry to even entertain. Sure, Malfoy was gay but even then, he and Harry had pretty much been mortal enemies back in the day. There was simply no way. Even Narcissa hadn’t had a clue about what it was, or maybe she just wasn’t telling Harry, but even so, he shouldn’t assume anything. In fact, why was he even thinking about it? He couldn’t pretend that he hated Malfoy anymore, but he certainly didn’t
, the git could’ve just lied and Harry would have been okay with it, it was definitely more peculiar to brush it off.
Harry measured the man’s face with his eyes, the darkness hindered him from seeing much, and he couldn’t conclude whether the git was taking the piss or not. “So, we’re just shagging?” Harry was annoyed to notice how pathetic he sounded. But they had been beating around the bush for too long, now he just wanted to put his cards on the table, though he was scared Malfoy would say yes, or avoid the question entirely.
After the trial, Harry had not heard of what happened to Draco, and was quite content with him being a dickhead somewhere else. Now, however, Harry was holding a piece of parchment with Draco’s testimony, and knowing that any moment now they would be in the same room once again made his intestines want to hop out of his body. Could he face him?
To call the view impressive was an understatement, and Harry could only produce a quick nod at the comment. He had something else to say than to talk about the view, although he did want to sit on the small balcony and just soak in the sun that seemed so prominent compared to that of Britain. “I’m sorry if it’s a bad time–“ Harry started, looking at Malfoy arranging some very plump tomatoes in one decorative fruit basket, and some juicy looking grapefruits in another. He was almost dumbfounded by how different Malfoy seemed here, he was wearing different clothes, he was calmer, just arranging his fruit in his little kitchen in Italy. It was sunny outside, birds were chirping, seagulls were screeching, it didn’t seem like anyone could have a care in the world here.
“And who has access to the storage, do you know?” Harry was trying to keep his tone professional and light, but was struggling.
Rosie gave a huge yawn and sat up sleepily in her bed, rubbing her eyes as she did so, huge hair just a puff of curls around her. When her eyes focused on Harry, she seemed to cheer up instantly, declaring her usual “Uncle Hawwyyy!” and immediately clinging to Harry’s left arm from where she was sitting. Harry gave her an awkward hug back, it was a weird position to give a hug, anyway.
how tired Harry was of hearing he was special, he just wanted to be normal. A normal wizard, go to school like any other, no one trying to murder you, having a normal job and a loving partner by his side. Just a normal life.
“Thanks mate, but it wouldn’t have happened without a special someone… I want you to meet her,” George turned around and motioned to a woman he was talking with earlier, who had just walked into the room. “Harry, this is Isabel, she helped with the expansion of WWW, and with a lot of other things, too,” George planted a gentle kiss on her head when she joined them and Harry couldn’t not envy the way he looked at her, “Isabel, love, this is Harry… Potter.”
Harry decided to play along. “What will you miss?” he inquired, and right about now wished that he had something to fiddle with, a counter or a wall to lean on, and not stand in the middle of the hallway like a bloody wanker. On the other hand, his conversational partner looked just about as uncomfortable as he was.
Then, Harry heard something. Water. Water splashing quietly. Like the statue in front of Malfoy’s shop. They turned a corner, and from behind a large bush was indeed revealed a fountain. It was of a life-size woman, holding a vase, out of which the water was pouring onto her feet. The marble of the statue was stained, and ivy had grown around the woman’s arm and the vase. The ground in front of the statue was stomped and worn as part of the path. Harry stepped forward to look, it was peculiar for an abandoned fountain to still be functional, and it felt as though the woman’s eyes were observing him. There were coins at the bottom of the shallow water pool, Harry could’ve sworn he saw a few knuts in the mix. “Who is this? Do you know?” he asked, and looked back at Malfoy.
Harry shrugged and untangled his arms to rest on his sides. “Time will tell, and by time I mean the Auror who will supervise the enforcement of your sentence. But, I presume they will make you swear an Unbreakable so that you won’t get up to anything.” Lucius opened his mouth to what would undoubtedly have been a sharp retort, but upon hearing Narcissa’s sniffles approaching in the corridor, apparently decided to hold his tongue. Harry saw him pull a face that could have been nausea or distaste, or both. “I’ll leave you three alone,” Harry said, and stepped out of the cell to face Narcissa and Draco.
,” Harry rolled his eyes, and felt the red spread from his ears to the rest of his face, “but… maybe in the future?”
“Ahh, sì, signore Malfoy,” an expression of recognition spread on the man’s face, “he is out now, will be back, eh, soon,” he smiled at Harry very politely. Harry gave a sigh of relief, maybe it would be alright after all, although he was dying of nervousness to see the man again. This was not some visit that he could cover up with saying that he was on Ministry business, or some other sort. Soon enough he would have to own up to the fact that he was here to see Malfoy, and him alone.
Narcissa must have heard it too, because she lifted an eyebrow at Harry, “It might have been a coincidence, it might not have been. Draco might have been shopping for me that day, but he certainly saw you, Harry Potter, go into a pub alone.” She didn’t elaborate further. Harry got a stomach ache. How did she know all of this? Also… Malfoy had followed Harry into the pub to talk to him? To try to… what, befriend him? Harry wanted to know what Malfoy wanted, but Merlin forbid he’d interview his damned mother about it. No, this was something he’d have to do face to face. Now he just had to find a way to talk to Malfoy alone without it being painfully obvious what he was doing.
Harry Potter. For all their Hogwarts career he’d known Potter to be lazy, shiftless, and disorganized. Now he was strutting about the place as arrogantly as Draco had heard his father to be, and even though he loathed Potter to begin with, this new put-together version irked his nerve even further. How much more annoying he had become, Draco had to hold back a cringe.
“I’m happy to go home,” Malfoy replied dryly, and didn’t seem like he was going to continue. At this point, Harry was holding on to his every word, soaking in the man’s presence like he could somehow store it. He didn’t want the moment to ever end, but at the same time, he wanted to already be done with the endless goodbyes the two had shared and start processing the matter alone.
“Thank Merlin, I’m safe for now,” Ron pretended to pat sweat from his forehead, “but also, ew. Not because of the gay thing, because of the Malfoy thing.”
Harry’s limbs felt numb and aching. It felt as if he had slept for a week without changing position once. But if he had been sleeping, why did he feel so bloody exhausted? It was like the bed was trying to slowly but surely swallow him. The bed! He was lying on a bed. But it wasn’t his bed, was it? No, the pillow was too soft, and Harry was quite certain there were more than one. His bed only had one flat pillow, which made his neck and shoulders sore. Come to think of it, his shoulders felt quite relaxed now, and the usual headache that slowly crept up the back of his neck was gone.
That was Harry’s cue to start undressing him. He pulled off his slacks with a degree more difficulty than Draco had done, and rubbed his erection through the soft fabric of his pants. Harry then pulled off the last of the clothes Draco was wearing, and he now had a completely naked Draco Malfoy sprawled on his bed. The dick in front of him was a shade of purple, pulsating and arching long. Harry bit his lip and tried to recall what Draco had just done to Harry himself, if he did that, he must have liked it, right?
“Maddocks, seriously? He’s not even that hot, I would’ve bet for Krum if anyone,” Harry frowned and propped himself up on the bed to lean on his elbows. Sure, Krum was a little awkward to be so popular, but he was more handsome than Alexei.
A few minutes later, Harry was standing in front of the holding cells at the Ministry, waiting for a portkey to appear, carrying two Aurors with Lucius in tow. At 9am sharp, Blackburn and Rivers turned up in front of Harry with a swirl, clutching Lucius firmly between them. All three of them looked more or less nauseous from the churning of the travel, and Harry felt sympathetic to their condition, but didn’t comment on it.
“And you believed that? Shit Harry, it’s Malfoy, he’s always up to something!” Ron called out, his mouth full and his fork pointing at Harry. Hermione looked like she wished she could have had wine, instead she took a long sip from her water, “It’s been ten years, people can change,” she said simply, and Ron gave the claim his most sarcastic snort.
Harry was shaking his leg anxiously. “Yeah, er, I’m not on the case, actually. It got redirected to one of our senior Aurors,” he admitted, and was painfully aware that he wasn’t coming off as the most authoritative Auror, at least not how he had wanted to be. “But don’t worry, you’re in good hands.”
Errands such as… reporting a crime? Harry decided to keep the comment to himself. Something deep inside him said that maybe it wasn’t so much them making Malfoy come here as him volunteering to do so, but it was a very small voice very deep within, sometimes also called wishful thinking.
After some minutes of heated whispering between Ackerman and Hermione, who had jumped up from her seat to descend down the steps and talk with her boss, the first person to testify was Penelope Jameson, who dutifully answered all of Ackerman’s questions, along with the questions from the judge.
But Malfoy was silent, just looking at Harry, not moving from where he was standing. He looked a bit ill, and Harry didn’t know what to do. Seconds were passing where they were just there, Harry expecting Malfoy to talk, yell at Harry, throw something, cry.
“I’m sorry,” came Ron’s blunt voice, he was looking between Draco and Harry like he was trying to solve a conspiracy directed towards him personally, “
“How?” Harry asked hopelessly, he was really not good with this stuff. He was truly astounded that he ever managed to convince Ginny to date him, somehow. It was more her just deciding that it was going to happen, after Harry had been pining after her for months. In conclusion, Harry was bad at dating, and he wished Malfoy had adopted the Ginny Weasley way of doing things.
“I see,” she said after a minute, “how did it happen?” Now Hermione turned her face to Harry once more, eyes inquisitive. She was taking it surprisingly well, and didn't seem to be completely put off by the idea.
“Fine,” Malfoy scowled, “I suppose you have a point. Didn’t think you’d still be so bitter about the pins though,”
that store had been in the Mulpepper family for nearly a millennium, Harry wasn’t aware that it was even operational anymore, although it was unlikely that the Ministry would have shut it down. After all, the shop merely sold ingredients to potions that themselves could be completely innocent, but nevertheless it was probably on the watch-list of the Ministry. “The shopkeeper owled the ministry today to report that a man he didn’t know had reserved an ingredient from him, a rare ingredient used in memory potions specifically, he thinks that it might be Ridgenorth. The man is coming to pick it up at 2pm.”
That night they exchanged presents, shared a hearty meal with too much wine and definitely too much dessert, laughed and watched as their children all played a game together that was an early Christmas present from Draco’s mother, and as their ways parted, past midnight, and Hermione was carrying Ben, who had been asleep for at least three hours by then, and as Harry closed the door behind them and turned to Draco, instead of wishing him merry Christmas, he said, “I think I want another one.” And, if Draco had been as slow on the uptake as Harry always was, he would have asked ‘another what?’. But it already dawned on him, and it was safe to say that it was the best Christmas present he’d ever had, until of course the next Christmas, when they actually got to bring home their daughter, Ava, whose hair was as black as the night sky.
The hearing was over before Harry could really process it. There was no prosecution, which reduced the time to less than half from the normal length of a trial. Judge Bones didn’t seem to have anything against the Department of Mysteries having their way, but looking severe while saying: “The court rules this case in favour of Lucius Malfoy, exonerated from the death penalty, and reducing his sentence to time served in Azkaban Prison, ten years, while sentencing him to life in Ministry confinement, details to be determined.” There was a bang of his wooden gavel on the sound block, and the next thing Harry could see was Narcissa bursting into tears, sobbing loudly while Draco was holding her awkwardly. They made eye contact, and Harry decided to give them a moment, sliding out of his seat, Hermione in tow, and into the outside corridor.
“You better show me then,” Draco smirked and reached to lick between Harry’s lips. It was so outrageously vile and enticing at the same time. Harry leapt to snog him, his heart fluttering, thinking he could never get enough.
“Yes, sure, let’s,” Harry nodded eagerly and grabbed his own outer robe. He couldn’t help thinking that the rarity of the occurrence held a hidden meaning: why had Hermione proposed this now? Of course, it could very well be a mere coincidence, and Harry preferred that option, so he decided to not think about the matter further.
“I know, it doesn’t make up for it, but just so you know,” Draco shrugged, his thumb rubbing circles in Harry’s calf, as he looked back at him bashfully. Was he… blushing? A scarlet colour started creeping up Harry’s neck, too. All that time, during the Yule Ball, during the Triwizard challenges, even when he was sneaking into the Room of Requirement to fix the Vanishing Cabinet, and especially when Harry caught him crying in the bathroom. When Draco threw that first hex at him, to drive away the person he was in love with from seeing him break down in private…
Now Malfoy sighed and also dropped his arms from his chest, he looked pained. “Personally, and I hate to say it, of all the unpleasant things you’ve made me feel… I don’t think I’ve ever been disappointed in you, Potter,” his tone was unidentifiable and he looked a tad ill. Harry’s jaw almost dropped to the floor, what would compel Malfoy to say such a thing? He had never been disappointed in Harry? That was a bunch of codswallop, as Hagrid would say.
It wasn’t hot in the house, but it was warmer than what Harry was used to, and he was already breaking a sweat from the hot air of the hair drying spell. Harry thought he looked… passable. He had done his hair very carefully, shaved closely, and now he was evaluating the result through a very clean mirror. Harry had even brought a toothbrush, which he had now hopefully placed next to a water glass already in the bathroom. Maybe he would stay for a while.
Just when he was about to modestly say that he worked at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, a voice came from the living room door, “He’s the Head Auror.” All three of them peered to see Ginny walking towards them, a playful smile on her face. She was still wearing a travel robe, and her red hair swirled behind her like fire. Apparently, she had just arrived.
Malfoy’s head jerked up from the paper he was scribbling on. His eyes scanned Harry from head to toe, like he was somehow trying to detect if he was lying or not. “Right, well, I don’t hate you either, believe it or not, so where does that leave us?”
“Merlin, Potter, if I didn’t know any better I’d think you’re always here just to see me,” Malfoy rolled his eyes, blushing only a little bit from his ears, “what is it this time?” The notorious clipboard was nowhere to be seen. Instead, Malfoy was sitting in a ghastly, worn office chair, his left elbow leaning on the desk and his right hand on his knee. The expression on his face was simultaneously tired and amused.
Harry was stuck between being awake and being asleep. Every time he thought he was awake, a deep slumber pulled him back under, and every time he thought he was falling asleep, he realized he was awake. Tossing and turning in his bed, he couldn’t find a good position to sleep in, and he was sweating when under the comforter, and shivering without it. A cold sweat was making him clammy as he struggled to fall asleep and wake up at the same time. The steady hum of rain outside infiltrated his uneven slumber.
“Now, we’re guests at Harry and Draco’s okay? So no funny business, I mean you especially, Hugo,” Hermione’s stern voice could be heard clearly from the doorway, and Draco considered their share of being the strict parent– the thing he had most in common with her than Harry or Ron – the lazy, lenient dads. Blast it all.
After a few seconds, the beard and the long hair started vanishing along with the bushy eyebrows, and Harry’s bones didn’t ache anymore. Malfoy handed Harry a small mirror to see his reflection. It looked ordinary: he was back to his twenty-five-year-old self. “Wonderful,” Malfoy cleared his throat, “all back to normal, or as normal as you ever were, anyway,” he didn’t even bother mumbling the last part, the bastard. “How are the joints?”
“No worries, I probably wouldn’t know who the Head Auror was if I wasn’t him,” Harry tried to chuckle again and this time it came out a tad more natural. Isabel gave him a grateful smile, before turning to Ginny, who came over to her to kiss her on both cheeks as a greeting, they had clearly met before. Ginny and George shared a quick hug.
Malfoy didn’t catch on to Harry’s joking tone, but instead flared, “Oh boo-hoo Potter, you’re really the victim here,” he again let his arms fall back on his sides and his hands balled into fists. He really looked like a child going to stomp his feet.
Four years ago, in the spring, when Draco was finishing up his first year as the Head of Slytherin house and as the Potions Master at Hogwarts, and Harry had first had the idea that he would like to train new Aurors, there had been an evening. An evening Draco had so carefully planned, and nervously prepared. He had made dinner at Harry’s old place – or something of the sort, he wasn’t really into cooking back then – and had lit a few dozen candles in the kitchen for when Harry got home. He had chilled the champagne, and dressed in his best robes, done his hair, and double, triple, quadruple checked that the ring box was in his pocket, before pacing around the house, waiting for Harry to arrive.
Seeing the git now did not calm Harry’s beating heart, why couldn’t he just be calm? Harry straightened himself up even though he was shorter than Malfoy anyway, and strode up the few steps to stand on the tiny platform in front of his door. “What are you doing here Malfoy?” Harry inquired with his most bored voice while fishing his pocket for his keys.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry nodded, though Malfoy could barely see it. Then there was nothing left to say, and they just sat there again, before lying down, still holding hands, staring at the ceiling. Eventually, and it was impossible to tell to whom of the two it happened first, they fell back asleep.
“Yes, please, if it’s not too much trouble,” Harry answered trying to sound as polite as he possibly could.
Harry had to internally shake himself and focus. Malfoy was on his doorstep, why? What could he possibly have to say that he absolutely had to wait for Harry? How long had he been there? Harry had been away for two hours. And
“Well it’s not too late, if you want to,” Ginny said and pulled her legs crossed into the chair, “I know some people.”
Once again they suffered through a long silence, filled with chirping birds and a car gassing away somewhere in the distance. At this point, Harry had nothing to say. He had now realized that the likelihood of him ever getting anywhere with Malfoy were extremely slim, the git had made that very clear, he just didn’t know why. It was like snapping out of a hypnotic state Harry had been in for the last few weeks; the truth was that Malfoy wasn’t interested in him and that was the bitter end of it. Harry didn't know what he had been thinking, and he immediately felt stupid – he and Malfoy had always been adversaries, and whatever made the man act like he had the past few weeks, Harry had clearly interpreted it wrong, and now wished he’d just shut up about the whole thing earlier. He hoped that the Ministry would finish their search of the Malfoys’ house sooner rather than later, and was relieved when Malfoy checked the time.
“Harry, don’t worry about it. You focus on healing, I’ll tell you if there are developments with the case.” Harry truly didn’t deserve to work with Evergrey, he was too nice, way too nice to get involved with Harry, who was a complete dick. Here he was, whining about work while lying in a hospital bed for something that was completely his fault.
“No, ‘course, just saying, maybe you could slip him the chocolates George sent you, eh?” Ron wiggled his eyebrows at Harry, who was very pained by the conversation.
“That does explain how you grew up to be so disgustingly impetuous,” he now spat out, but with less force than normally. Malfoy still looked pissed off, but in a milder way, the same way he had been constantly pissed off at Crabbe and Goyle back in the day. He was giving bashful looks to Harry’s direction.
“I do have one condition though,” Kingsley asserted and sat up straighter in his chair, “if you’re really on the mission to find out the truth, you have to call Narcissa Malfoy back to the Ministry and interview her again… with Veritaserum.”
That afternoon a pink-haired Healer in her fifties in green robes came to talk to Harry about what was going on with his treatment. Apparently, Malfoy had been quite accurate when it came to his injuries: cracked ribs, hips, and clavicle. Apparently there had been a real danger of him breaking his spine, but fortunately his back muscles had taken the hit by reflexively protecting the spinal cord. The woman was holding a clipboard with Harry’s information, and explained to him that even though all of his bones were intact now, it would take up to 20 hours for them to be completely back to normal. Harry had to spend the night, but would be released first thing in the morning. Until then, he would have to take a potion every four hours to keep the pain at bay, and try to stay put.
And when they stepped out of the restaurant into the freezing air, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and Apparated them both right back to where they had been standing a week before in Harry’s hallway. And before Harry could pretend to offer him tea, Draco was already kissing him against the front door, his hands traveling up and down Harry’s body, nibbling his ear, sucking his neck until Harry was moaning in his hair.
Harry chewed on his lip thoughtfully. “So, you went to Buckbeak to get your arse kicked?” he gave a small laugh. He remembered how fabulously unsorry he had felt when Buckbeak had kicked the living shit out of Malfoy’s arm with his hooves, and a sting of guilt came over him, if he had only known the situation… Although, the git had been incredibly insufferable about the whole affair for weeks, getting off from doing homework, really gathering up the pity from his housemates, almost getting Buckbeak executed, though that was mostly Lucius’s doing.
“Erm, it seems that your muggle sunblock wasn’t quite powerful enough this time,” Harry grimaced and walked over to the man, the towel hung only loosely around his waist, to avoid any painful friction on his reddened skin. The cool evening wind felt welcome, and immediately started drying Harry’s damp hair. He stopped next to Malfoy, and put his other hand on the cold iron railing. The view was even more graphic from up there: it felt as though Harry had stepped into the scenery, and was floating closer and closer to the sea.
“I guess that’s one way to put it,” Harry mumbled. A crude, vulgar way to put it, but a way nonetheless. Malfoy had always had a talent of delivering quips in the most insulting way one could possibly do it, inherited from his dad no doubt.
Patrick stayed near the door to monitor what was about to go down. Harry crossed his arms on his chest, and gave a convincing shake of his head, “Alright, Dargan, I must admit, I am quite envious… of how Dame Fortune has been on your side this whole time.” Harry really hoped this would work, he started to miss doing paperwork, he didn't even know that was possible.
Harry blinked, baffled. “How do you know I lived with my aunt and uncle?” How the fuck did Malfoy know everything? He was like the evil Hermione of the grapevine.
Draco fell down to lean on his elbows and snorted, “Figures, you always were a prude, Potter, a little too good for anyone.” He then seemed to blush at his words and turned his face to the side. After all,
After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry had joined the Auror training together with Ron and Neville. He had been full of determination to clear Britain of any supporters of Voldemort that might have still been lurking somewhere – an ambitious goal for any eighteen-year-old to have. Although the training had been everything he had hoped for, the work itself, as it turned out, was not. The three years he had been training with Ron were, in hindsight, probably the happiest years of his life, aside from the fact that he had broken up with Ginny a few months after he’d started training.
!” Theseus called out, “I remember them, notorious at their peak, infamous for brewing fraudulent potions and selling them. Sometimes with malignant side-effects, I remember a particularly horrid case where–“
“Yes, although I don’t know him that well, at all, really,” Hermione sat up straight in her chair and cleared her throat, “but it seems that he’s trying to get your attention, and the ball is now in your court.” The ball? What ball was she talking about? Did she mean that it was up to Harry to make the next move? Bollocks, he knew he would get horrible advice from Hermione, she was too sensible to ever suggest something as ineffective as ‘just let it go’.
“I’m good, better, the shop’s fine too, no doubt you heard about the planned addition of a brand new Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes in Hogsmeade, heh,” George nodded and chuckled. To be honest, Harry was surprised that they ever got around to do it, George had been quite lost after the Battle of Hogwarts, understandably, and WWW probably reminded him of Fred a lot. Whether that was a good or a bad thing, Harry didn’t know, but surely it wasn’t easy dealing with it all. Merlin knows it hadn’t been easy for him, either.
Malfoy was getting restless, he was shifting in his seat, looking like he would storm off at any moment. “You really are thick, aren’t you? Can’t you see? You weren’t just some fucking object I wanted from dear father, you were the first fucking person I was fucking in love with. And I couldn’t handle it,” his face had developed some red blotches, “of course I was a fucking prick about it, that’s the only thing I knew how to fucking do!”
“Isn’t that just your usual style?” Malfoy replied sarcastically, not looking Harry, but instead turning a small ceramic statue in his hands. Harry had gotten that from Ron and Hermione as a souvenir from their honeymoon. A bitter reminder, he wouldn’t mind if Malfoy would accidentally smash it.
Malfoy chewed on his lip thoughtfully. “You’re right, I don’t want to leave,” he started, “but it’s not because of some pizza and a view. True, those things are better than in England, but, it’s also the anonymity I have here. No one knows my past, they only know the person I choose to be now.” He sipped on his wine and looked at Harry from behind the rim of the glass.
“My favourite memory?” the man echoed, and chewed his lip in thought, staring at the ceiling. The two were more or less tangled up on the bed, their legs intertwined and their arms either under the other or somewhere in between. “Off the top of my head, probably when I got into the Quidditch team,” Draco replied after a moment, “and when Weasley got so fucked off about it that he tried to jinx me to vomit slugs, but then
Lucius didn't look back at him, he was staring at the wall opposite, and then at the table. He was quiet for a long while, and Harry’s eyes sought the window, behind which black, cloaked figures could be seen, floating far away in the rain clouds. There was a shudder that shook Harry once again, and he realized that Lucius hadn’t spoken in a few minutes. Harry couldn't believe he would pass up the opportunity, but there was little for him to do, so he just shrugged and turned to leave.
Harry just nodded, again, “Until tomorrow, then,” he said, confidently. He turned around and marched back into the fireplace. Now he just had to come up with a convincing reason, or preferably, reasons, for the Ministry board to not order an execution for one of the most notorious Death Eaters of his time, how hard could that be?
“Yes,” Harry confirmed, and as he said it, he realized that it was true. As much as he hated to admit it, he did like Malfoy. He liked him very much.
“Congratulations on the verdict,” Harry said simply, crossing his arms on his chest and leaning against the cell’s cold wall, not expecting to receive a response.
“I know,” Malfoy said simply, and didn’t continue. Harry blushed. They had reached the top of the stairs, and once they started making their way forward, something unexpected happened. Malfoy, very casually, slipped his little finger around Harry’s. It wasn’t like they were full on holding hands, but the small gesture made Harry’s heart almost hammer out of his chest. He didn’t want to make the moment go away, and he didn’t dare to say anything, not that there would’ve been much to talk about anyway. He just let his pinky hold onto Malfoy’s, now walking closer to him as to not give any reason for him to let go. They walked like that for a while.
“Well one good thing is that I got a pretty specific description of the witch Ivanov met at the pub, I’ll get you a copy and we can run it through the list of witches wanted, who knows, maybe we’ll get lucky,” Harry opened the door to his office, strode over to his desk, Accio’d Malfoy’s statement from the piles of parchments and cast a Doubling Charm before handing the other over to Evergrey.
Noah had been quiet at first, but during his first few months in his new home, he’d turned out to be quite the active boy, and for his first birthday at the Malfoy-Potter residence, Harry had gotten him a toy broomstick. They were both excited to see that Noah took to flying instantly, hovering and flying about only a few centimetres off the ground. Ever since then they had been quite the trio, dazzling old ladies at Diagon Alley, a former Death Eater turned good and the Chosen One, with their son between them. They had had to turn down dozens of interviews – ‘it’s just not the right time, we’re focusing on family at the moment’ had been the official statement both Harry and Draco were already sick and tired of repeating.
Now a short man entered the pub, and after performing a quick sour scan of the place, recognized Draco sitting at one of the booths and scurried over quickly. They shared an uncomfortable greeting. The man was in his fifties, wearing old but neat black robes and carrying a flat briefcase.
Just when he was done, their food got served. Even though Harry thought he had lost his appetite, the delicious smells made him take a bite of the mouth-watering dish. He didn't regret it. Hermione attacked hers immediately, though still preserving her table manners, something lost to Ron at times. For a moment, they were eating quietly, sounds of the restaurant filling Harry’s ears so that only halfway through he realized that neither of them had said a thing.
Harry was left by himself with the vague but unshakable feeling that something within him had fundamentally changed.
Harry always forgot that existed. He had wondered why it had felt like there was warmth radiating from Malfoy, but had assumed that he was so full of rage that it simply exuded out of him as heat. However, if Harry cast a heating charm now he would look quite stupid, so his toes would have to hold on for a little longer.
Malfoy turned to him, and raised his eyebrows amusedly upon seeing his red shoulders, Harry didn’t think there was anything funny in the situation, “Shit, does it hurt?” Draco asked, brushing Harry’s hot skin lightly. It stung.
Patrick nodded back at him and walked over to the other armchair and they both sat down. He was not wearing his work robes, and Harry assumed that he was on sick leave still, although he looked perfectly fine. Despite everything that had happened, Kingsley had still not let Harry back on the case, not that there would’ve been much to do currently anyway. ‘The conflict of interest is still there, Harry, just focus on filing the arrest report’, Kingsley had said, not even looking up from his paperwork.
“Ah, of course, that,” Harry nodded, feigning seriousness. Malfoy had had quite the reputation back then; rich, powerful father with connections both in the Ministry, and, rumour had it, to some dark wizards. No one could stand against Draco in fear of getting wiped from the face of the earth, except Harry, of course, who pretty much had nothing to lose anyway – the Dark Lord had already been on his back, what was one more of his followers? Harry remembered what it was like to be up in arms every time he crossed swords with Malfoy, wanting to hex his arse into next year.
They pulled apart. “How are you sweetie?” Harry asked, ruffling her already chaos of a hair, “Have you still gone flying with your dad?”
it was forbidden for students to be out that late.” Though he seemed to realize then that curfews had never stopped Harry before.
might not have been very accurate at times, so I hope your opinion of me is not based entirely on Rita Skeeter opinion pieces,” he tried to chuckle nonchalantly, but it came out a little awkward.
After processing the news about Lockhart’s fraudulent identity for a bit, Malfoy decided to not dwell on it any longer, and to move on to their next destination. It was on the very edge of the city, in a small park near the highway. One could hear the occasional cars gassing behind the thick trees. There was an iron statue in the middle of a round clearing, of a witch called Abriana Zaccaria, who had apparently led a small band of local magical folk to defend the small Italian city from invaders a long time ago. She was holding her fist up high, with her robes behind her, and her wand in a holster. If one would only look quickly, it was as if she was wearing a military cloak and a dagger on her waist. Muggles would certainly see it that way, maybe blame the oddities on the old ways of sculpting.
with stacks of parchment, some towers tall enough to hide behind. Harry could barely see any furniture from behind the mountains of paperwork now decorating Kingsley’s office.
“Well, first of all, you were lucky that Gunther Ivanovski didn’t remember your name when we interrogated him,” Harry started, “you were lucky that Narcissa Malfoy was released from Azkaban just in time for you to frame her with Dubois, then, when you managed to escape from that muggle neighbourhood, a stroke of luck again,” Harry listed, he knew he was pressing Ridgenorth’s buttons, “How fortunate that the Marigold had your back after all these years, isn’t it… Dargan?” Harry didn’t stop pacing so as to not give the man any more reason to be suspicious.
“I suppose you’re right,” the man nodded, and the terminality of that sentence made Harry’s heart race again, his palms turning sweaty, his stomach turning every which way, making him nauseous. Was this it? Was this when Malfoy would say ‘goodbye, Potter’ and piss off from his life forever? Just the thought of that sent panic rushing through Harry’s veins.
“Wait, hold on,” Harry demanded sternly, “you’re just going to piss off?” To be fair, that was what the bloody git did best. Any time things got mildly serious, he just fucked off to wherever. What a classy fucking move.
“And how did that work out for you?” he teased, wanting to keep the conversation light. He recalled Slytherin losing their first ever match against Gryffindor, with Harry and Draco pitted against each other. Harry wondered, if by getting his son on the team, Lucius had effectively removed all the fun Draco could’ve possibly had on the broom, and reformed it into pressure of succeeding. Or did he care at all? Did he care whether Draco was good or bad? Harry couldn't decide which was sadder.
The second course was a creamy yellow risotto, that was placed on the bottom of a very large plate. It was heavenly, and for a moment, Harry forgot why he didn’t feel like eating. He was sad when the dish was gone in a few forkfuls, and hoped that the waiters weren’t rolling their eyes at him for his boorish behaviour. “Do you know what?” he said suddenly, Malfoy still chewing on his rice but now directing his attention to Harry, “I’m not going to ruin my own night,” he declared, “I’m here, in a lovely restaurant, in Italy, with this incredible view, and this mouth-watering food, with the man I love, so cheers.” He clinked Malfoy’s wine glass with his own, and was halfway to bringing it to his lips, when he heard the man’s incredulous voice.
by Zamira Gulch, that Hermione had gotten him when he moved away from the Burrow. With the book in one hand and his wand in the other, Harry succeeded in performing a much needed deep-cleaning of the house.
Now Lucius’ eyes flickered to Harry sharply, and he looked like he was about to jump up from his chair the way he inched forward to lean on the table. “How do you know that?” he hissed, his eyes dark, and for a second he seemed back to his old self, “Have you gone near my family? I swear to Merlin and Salazar himself if you hurt them I’ll–“
Harry didn’t know how to respond, it had been awful. The Dementors, the cold, the constant wind and rain, the bleak corridors and rooms. “I’ll be glad to never be there again,” he said quietly, trying not to shudder to much at the memory.
They ate in silence, and only when Harry was helping to wash the dishes, did Malfoy speak at last, “So, er… have you been to Italy before?” He was drying off their plates with a blue and white tea cloth, and putting everything away.
Harry was getting pretty fucking tired of the same lament. “Oh, give it a rest Malfoy, if you loathe me so much why did you ask me here?”
“And what do you want to specialize in?” Harry asked before realizing that there was no way he could pretend this was still part of the questioning.
Harry was in the habit of taking the Floo Network to the Atrium of the Ministry instead of his private fireplace, because he didn’t want to seem too distant, and frankly favoured the muggle way of mingling and saying good mornings to one’s co-workers, instead of just going straight to sulking in his office. Now he was walking across the space doing just that, asking people how they were and making his way into level two of the Ministry, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
“No need to apologise, and no need to call me sir, you did the right thing contacting me. Now, what did Mrs Malfoy say?” Harry took off his outer robe and draped it over one of the two chairs in front of his desk. He accepted the piece of parchment Rivers was handing him and then plopped down on the green armchair in front of the unlit fireplace.
“I expect we didn’t catch him then,” Harry lifted his eyebrows while he asked the question, it was a stupid thing to ask, but he wanted to divert Patrick’s attention away from him. Being the target of other people’s protection and the source of their anxiety was not the person he wanted to return to being.
“No, thank you, this is a quick visit,” Harry waved his hand to accompany his words. A new worried look settled on Narcissa’s face as she sat down on the sofa, she had avoided Harry’s gaze before, but was now looking at his face, probably trying to evaluate the gravity of the situation. “Does Draco need to be here for this? He’s out, right now, he’s not coming back until later.” Another inexplicable wave of disappointment washed over Harry, but he firmly decided to ignore it. He was here on business.
“Harry, you just have to go for it,” Ginny rolled her eyes again, she if anyone knew how Harry literally never ‘went for it’ when it came to romantic relationships, “Merlin knows you can’t wait forever.” She was right, eventually Malfoy would return to Italy, and Harry would be left by himself again. But Harry felt crazy even thinking that
Late Friday afternoon, there was a knock on Harry’s door. An all too familiar one, sharp, demanding, it echoed throughout the house. Harry had just stepped out of the shower after going to the gym, and was now trying to frantically dry his hair with a large towel which he then discarded on the bathroom floor. He was frantically going through the havoc that was his bedroom in search for something to wear. In a hurry, he just threw on the sweatpants he realized were still too tight, and a plain white tee. Just when he all but rushed out of his bedroom and down the stairs, there was another bout of knocks on his door.
Just as he turned to leave, Harry surged to grab his hand. “Wait, Draco,” he said quickly, and saw Malfoy’s eyes widen at the sound of his given name. He was really quite stunning, come to think of it. Harry was standing at a weird crouching position, so he straightened himself to look him in the eye. “It’s fine,” he said in a steady voice, “listen, let’s go somewhere.”
“It’s good, fine,” Harry was holding the warm cup with both hands, “after the training they pretty much stuck us on desk duty, before letting us accompany more experienced Aurors. It’s only been a year since we’ve been able to respond to calls ourselves, well, you see how well it went,” he rolled his eyes more to himself than anyone.
“Mhm, thought so,” Draco said more to himself than to anyone else, his head still nestled in Harry’s neck. His hot breath tickled Harry’s skin in the best way possible. The Dark Mark was still smudged on his left forearm, and Harry reflexively obeyed his urge to kiss it, maybe to show the man that he didn’t care about his past. Malfoy quickly lifted his head back up to follow Harry’s motion with his eyes, but didn't say anything. Instead, he gave Harry another fierce kiss, as to acknowledge the gesture.
The question somehow surprised Harry while not surprising him at all. He knew it would come up eventually, but had somehow not expected it to be at that moment. “I do, I feel like it’s where I should be right now, not forever but, I think I can do some good out there,” he admitted. He did think that everything in his life had led up to him being the one to secure the lives of the magical folk of Britain. It might have been the guilt of being the cause of so much grief when he was younger that compelled him to want to somehow repay the people.
“The Boy Who Lived? The Saviour of the Wizarding and Muggle World as we know it?” Malfoy supplied helpfully. “I bet it must have been very hard for you to be admired by everyone,” his tone dripped with sarcasm.
Harry stood looking out of the window behind his desk, his back turned to the door. The Ministry was located underground, but the large window with its many panes was conjured to display London as it was seen from the tallest offices of the building they were under. Storm clouds were beginning to form in the skyline, and Harry wasn’t sure if it was displaying the current weather or his gloomy mood. He was holding the profile of the last wizard to be interviewed in his hand. He had also seen the man sitting at the bar, and had the most accurate description of the witch he had been talking with before the Aurors showed up. Now Harry had to find out whether he had seen something else of importance.
Patrick nodded and took the journal along with the note that Harry was handing him. “I’ll take this to the Department of Mysteries, maybe they can figure it out.”
Harry fell backwards into the water, letting it soak his hair completely. Another thing that he had always known but only now realized was how very salty the water was: even when he kept his mouth shut, he could still taste it in his mouth. The water was so clear he could see all of the rocks and shells on the seabed when he dove around in the shallow shore. Malfoy was amused at his clear wonderment of the experience. He waded over to Harry just to kiss his salty lips, grinning the whole time, gentle waves splashing on their legs. That’s when Harry knew. He knew something Draco knew, but he didn’t say anything.
“What is it?” he asked, sounding resigned. Harry imagined a decade being surrounded by Dementors would do that to a person. Hell, he was already drained after twenty minutes in this place.
Draco took a deep breath like he was trying to steady himself, which he probably was, judging on the very visible bulge in front of his jeans. Harry bit his lip at the sight. “When are you free next?” Draco asked quietly. There was a determined fire behind his eyes.
“I’m sure it is,” Rose replied, and lifted her chin. She then turned back to Harry, “I like him,” she said simply, and with that evaluation, she was off.
“Ah,” Malfoy replied simply, and stared at the pink and violet shades of the horizon now colouring the night sky. They were both quiet for a while. Harry was wondering whether Petunia’s presence ever protected him from Voldemort, or whether the fact that he had lived with the foul lot was for nothing. He wanted to believe it was for something, something other than getting a flimsy roof over his head, and food occasionally. He wanted to believe it was worth losing his childhood over. Well, not his whole childhood, he had good times once he got to Hogwarts, and met Ron, and Hermione.
The rest of his sick leave went by quickly, with Harry sleeping a lot and reading books that he had gotten as presents but discarded for years. He wrote back to Molly who had asked him how he was and invited him to her traditional Easter Sunday dinner in two weeks. The last day of his time off was uncharacteristically warm for a mid-March day, the temperature reaching almost twenty degrees Celsius, and Harry spent most of his day in the garden, reading and napping.
“I will,” Harry nodded firmly. As of yet, he didn't have any good reasons, but that bit would have to come later.
That night, Harry was lying awake in Malfoy’s bed. The man beside him was snoring lightly, but that wasn’t the thing keeping Harry up. He couldn’t sleep because of an awful, intrusive thought that had popped into his head. What were they doing? They were having fun, this week, sure. But what about next week? Malfoy couldn’t just not show up to work for the four weeks that Harry was scheduled to be off. Even if he would, Harry would eventually have to return to London, to his apartment that now seemed so bleak and lonely, to his work, to his normal life. A life without Malfoy, tan and snoring, next to him. Neither of them could just quit their jobs, change their life completely, could they?
“Thanks, Patrick, I think so too,” Harry nodded eagerly and found himself looking around the room. It was the same as always, infuriatingly neat, with messy stacks of parchment nowhere in sight. Evergrey’s bookcase wasn’t flowing with useless books and binders like Harry’s was, and his desk was organized as always, how irritating. “I just came to tell you something, before you hear it from Kingsley,” Harry said, and gave a meaningful look in Patrick’s direction, who was now looking very weary of Harry, “while I’m gone, you’re the acting Head Auror.”
Harry slowly opened his mouth to speak, but kept his eyes shut. “What a shit fever dream, I really wished my unconscious would get some new material already,” his voice sounded like it was coming from someone else’s mouth, it echoed inside his head and sounded completely strange.
Finally, on Wednesday, Harry was lazily leafing through the Ministry’s weekly internal newsletter and saw something. Usually the newsletter was utterly dull, so Harry was almost shocked to actually find something that could be related to his case. There, in the
Harry couldn’t stay put anymore, he stood up a little bit too quickly to be natural, “No no, you rest, I’ll do it.” The gesture earned a very suspicious look from Evergrey, who also stood up, slower, and walked to the other side of the chair, laying his hand on the back of it.
At the same time though, Harry felt a sting of nervousness somewhere deep inside his gut. It had been too long since he had been with anyone. Sure, him and Ginny had been together for nearly five years, although the first year they were too busy with everything else to even think about being intimate, and the last year they were basically broken up anyway. But there were still three good years in there. That was four years ago, Harry thought and felt embarrassed. But he wasn’t going to show it. He knew that this was what he wanted, and knowing that Draco wanted it too made him kiss him now, slower, deeper. Besides, Harry was pretty hard right now, and he didn’t want to let Draco leave him.
Now Malfoy pursed his lips, and sighed sharply. “Honestly, I don’t think you’d want to know that,” he faced Harry’s stare without a hint of disdain in his expression.
Now Kingsley stood up forcefully, dark blue robes shuffling around him, clearly provoked by Harry’s comment and his general tone undermining his authority, “I
Jameson, a round-faced woman in her thirties with dark curly hair, had only been the Head of her department for a few years, but was smart as a whip and a very capable researcher before joining the Ministry in the first place. Her academically directed interests made her the one person Harry knew he had the chance to persuade. Penelope looked around the room, like she was trying to find answers in the faces that were now turned to look at her instead of Harry. “Er, I guess… not much,” she admitted.
and countless other papers, and only when he had entered Auror training did people seem to lose their interest.
“I told you, I’ve never been disappointed in you,” Draco replied and kissed Harry again, it was fast and relentless, his hands traveling everywhere on Harry’s body. Harry didn’t want to think about anything else but Malfoy’s touch, his warmth… and his hard cock brushing against Harry’s, he let out a soft whimper. Draco gently pushed Harry towards his bed until he fell on it backwards, quickly shuffling to the middle. Malfoy followed suit and was hovering over Harry for a second before kissing him again.
After graduating from Auror training, top of his class mind you, Harry had worked for six years before being promoted as Head Auror about a year ago, when Isac Netherberry had retired. He felt honoured to be offered the position, and after some thought and a vigorous speech from Hermione about confidence and deserving things, Harry had accepted the chance he wanted to leap at in the first place.
. Did she mean that Malfoy was obsessed with him somehow? And if it was in the same way as in Hogwarts, should he be looking over his shoulder?
For the past three years, Harry’s life had consisted of going to work and going to the gym. He dreaded weekends when he was alone, and following Ron and Hermione’s family life from a distance made him feel quite lonely and empty in his own life. As for Ginny, their breakup had started a year before they had actually parted ways, which made it all the more gruesome when it actually happened. The main reason for separating had been that they were simply too close as friends, and they both had to admit that the romantic attraction was gone: intimacy felt weird and forced, and they ended up having a long conversation one night, after which Ginny left, eyes dry.
Finally, after months of looking, Harry had found a house, in the countryside, near a lovely Muggle village, in the middle of the fields and overlooking a large lake. But it was wildly out of their price range. Once they had gotten there, though, there were little arguments besides money that they could produce to
While Narcissa was putting the kettle on in the other room, Harry felt too queasy to sit still. He quickly got up to his feet, and, in the lack of something better to do, went over to the fireplace to take a closer look at the photos displayed. On the left, Malfoy was sitting at a table behind a birthday cake, with a huge number six candle on it. He was laughing at the camera, his smile missing some teeth, and his hair was whiter than Harry had ever seen it. His cheeks were round and rosy. The picture had been put in a simple golden frame, while the one on the right was in a more ornamental, black frame. In this picture, Malfoy looked about thirteen years old, he was standing side by side with Lucius, while Narcissa was sitting at the front. They were all wearing black, and none of them were smiling. It was a huge contrast with the little laughing Draco of the other picture, and Harry couldn’t help wondering why Narcissa had opted for these two pictures to be put up. As teenage Draco blinked up at Harry from the picture, Harry couldn’t help wondering if he had been happy at the time. It must have been around that period when he had really recognized that he had been gay, surely something deeply unsettling to realize to the only heir of the Malfoy family. Harry wondered how Lucius had taken it, or if he even knew.
“Theseus,” Harry interrupted him loudly, at which the man seemed annoyed, but stopped talking, “are you saying, that all this time that we’ve been looking for someone brewing counterfeit memory serum and selling it, you have had this information… and never thought to share it?” Harry was getting a tad frustrated himself, they could have closed this case weeks ago if Scamander just spoke up!
“When will you get to go home?” Hermione, to Harry’s great relief, changed the subject. She didn’t look half as happy about the gifts presented as Ron did, and had probably only let him bring them as a joke.
Earlier that day, they had managed to cook a proper meal, regaining some strength after the ghastly morning they’d had. At least Harry noticed that he wasn’t feeling half as desperate after he’d had something to eat. After, they look a long nap, waiting for 4pm to roll around. They were lying in Harry’s bed, his arm loosely thrown over Draco’s side as what had started as a comforting embrace and ended up a slack limb just drooping over him as they had fallen asleep.
The man sighed, and paused for a few seconds before talking, “Well, first of all, you’re going to have to spend the night, I’m sure the Healer that took care of you will be back later today to explain to you the specifics,” Harry was just about to interrupt him, when Patrick raised his hand signalling that he was not done, “second of all, the Minister ordered for you to take a full week off before returning to your duties, you will probably receive an owl before tomorrow, and before you interrupt me I’ll say this too, it may be that he’ll retire you from the case.”
“Well cheers,” Harry said and clinked his glass against Malfoy’s that was resting on the table, “I’ll drink to that, too.”
But first, he needed his wand. Harry stuck his arm out determinedly, and very firmly pronounced: “Accio!” The wand on the table started trembling but didn’t move one nudge towards him. Harry let out a sigh of frustration, usually he could have done this in his sleep. And he had, before. So, he reached his arm out again, towards his wand, and demanded: “Accio!” Nothing. Even the tremble had stopped now.
