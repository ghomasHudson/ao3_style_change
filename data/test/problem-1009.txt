Springing him out of the Dursley's early, attracting a new Potions Professor.  The extra lessons, the teaching him everything he knew about Voldemort.  He was preparing him for the final battle he'd have to face at some point, Harry had always known that.  But he was doing it now because he knew he only had this year.
“I can't imagine he would take that very well, to be honest.” Harry said, shifting to get to his feet, brushing off his backside after sitting in the dust.  “In my meetings with Dumbledore he's talked about how Tom had so many people surrounding him while he was in school, people that all seemed to consider them his friends...  But he doubted very much that Tom ever saw them as friends. Having someone loudly proclaiming to anyone who will listen that they're close to him and most trusted by him would likely rub him the wrong way.”
let me die but you didn't, and that counts for more than you let yourself acknowledge. So please,
By the time the young maid came back up for to bring them their mid-morning tea, Draco had to admit he found Harry's rendition of the medical journals a lot more interesting that he would have done if one of his old professors had been teaching him. He sat there in his straight-backed chair and steeped fingers and watched the young brunette man as he really got into the writing, and smiled to himself before he informed Draco of how a few of the discoveries had gotten muddled before printing, and some of the people got confused as to the positioning of some of the internal organs. As they sipped at their tea, Draco couldn't help but notice how truly entrancing the younger man was and he couldn't deny how intriguing Harry was becoming by the minute. He loathed admitting that his father had made an excellent choice in bringing Harry over to read to him.
The silence that had stretched out over the conservatory was suffocating as Harry had so casually referred to his breakdown. Draco waited for something catastrophic to happen but nothing did. Harry simply arose from the table and extended his hand towards the blonde man before him and smiled warmly. With all eyes upon him Draco had jutted out his chin, stood up gracefully and smoothed his own waistcoat down and walked along past Harry out of the conservatory and into the lush green gardens that he had stared at all afternoon. He had to admit that the gardens were beautifully, and it wasn't exactly as stifling as he'd thought it would be walking side-by-side with Harry almost like old times, only not so close. It had been a pleasant afternoon and much to everyone's surprise it was the small pebbles of warm summer afternoons that started to pave the way back to some sort of relationship with one another, regardless of what sort of relationship it would be.
Draco stared down at him as if he was confused by the proposal. Soon, however, his expression softened a little and his shoulders slumped in resignation before a dry little smile slid over his mouth. "I suppose if you think it would help me. I mean, you've been right so far haven't you?" he murmured.
Harry licked his lips but stayed silent. He didn't know if he wanted to tell Draco what he had been thinking about lately. For the last year, in fact. He wasn't sure he wanted to tell anybody about it, but he knew that people were starting to notice how 'off' he had been in the last couple of weeks. He pulled at a frayed thread on his hoodie -having skipped all his lessons of the day, choosing to do some meditation instead -before sighing and tearing his eyes away from the horizon for a moment.
Draco threw his head back and let out a strangled cry as Harry started to slowly move inside him, drawing up a rhythm that made him sweat out and clutch the bed sheets into a tangled mess until his knuckles were gleaming white. He panted erratically as he tried to cam his frantic heart but the adrenaline was rushing through him at such an alarming rate that he couldn't keep his moans from escaping and filling the air between them. Harry's grunts as he thrust inside him, deep and hot and tight, made his own erection ache as it bobbed on his stomach. He raised his legs until his toes were curled over the edge of the mattress and raised his hips in time to Harry's thrusting, and he cried out over and over until everything became lost in the translation of the heavy lust that gripped him. "Harry!" he gasped out through his strangled cries, as he pulled himself up to grip at Harry's sweating shoulders as he gripped Draco's legs and pounded into him.
Harry looked up at Draco with fearful eyes. He really did not want to be taken back to that hospital. The staff members were rude to him because of who Draco was. He shook his head of such thoughts. "N-no. I'm going to Blackpool, Hermione. That's my choice."
Within another five minutes the food had been dished out onto plates and shared evenly between himself and Harry.
He nodded along to the small talk that was brought up, sipped at his pumpkin juice and picked at his food, only managed to squeeze a couple of plump grapes down his throat, despite how raw it was. He was in such a daze of his own numbness, his mind completely blank, when a hand rested on his shoulder. His head snapped up, cracking his neck, and he winced as he squinted up through the blazing sun up at Severus' expressionless face, his onyx eyes shimmering weakly with concern. Harry closed his eyes shut and then raised his eyebrows in question. "It's time for you and Draco to have that little boat ride of yours. It will do you both some good, even if it is just a quiet ride around the lake."
"Oh, Harry..." Draco breathed, tilting the brunette's chin so that he could look into those sorrowful green eyes. "We are
"That you'll come back to me after the last task."
All he could do was watch as they strapped Harry's body to a transportable bed and cast several complex spells on his figure.
"Harry!" Draco barked though his mouth was smiling, "I'm asking you because I am sure. I just need to know whether or not you are sure," he paused for a moment before raising both eyebrows, "Well are you?"
Harry shrugged his shoulders, "I think I can manage a shower. You just open the window and ... relax," leaning over on the bed, Harry pressed a small kiss to Draco's mouth before smiling and retreating into the bathroom.
He didn't know when he had woken up or even when he shifted out of the bed, but when his mind dared to refocus he was sitting back in the wicker chair pulled right up to the head of the bed, curled his legs up to his chest and sat there breathing heavily against his fingertips as he watched Draco. He looked so beautiful lying on the pillow, his darkened blonde hair splayed out over the soft cotton pillow. His face looked a little sweaty from the heat, his golden lashes curling upward, and he looked a little weak where he hadn't really been eating too well.
These were the thoughts running through Draco's ruffled head as Hermione stepped through into his living room and was demanding to know why she had been woken up in the middle of the night by a frustrated nurse telling her that Harry had escaped the hospital. As soon as he left the confides of his bedroom however as soon as he encountered Hermione she rounded on him asking why he was not panicking on out already searching for Harry himself.
"There's always a reason to calm down, Harry," Draco assured in a controlled voice. He didn't loosen his grip on Harry as he shifted a little closer, his lower back aching from the position he was in. "Listen, if this is bothering you so much why haven't you spoken to anyone about it?"
Harry ducked his head out from under Draco's smooth palm, his mouth downcast. "Don't ... I'm ugly."
Their hands swung between them as Harry swung the red lead in random circles with small motions of his wrist. He whistled a light tune as they walked on wards through the sand. They had woken up fairly refreshed that morning, a good full English breakfast had them prepared for the day mapped out for them. After returning to the hotel with Seeker, they were to take a tram up to the Black Pool Tower and experience the circus and then go for some lunch.
Two lightly tanned arms wrapped around his waist. A firm weight pressed against his back and, at last, he felt the last of the dress melt off his shoulders. "Now, if Snape looked nearly as hot as you do, I doubt I'd be as bad at potions as I am."
He was not repulsed by Harry's appearance. The only thing it did was sadden him to unbearable levels.
Draco sneered and started hurling more spells at him; stinging hexes, the jelly leg curse, freezing him mid-shout, he even tried '
At that moment, Draco felt his heart surge with over-whelming delight and ache with the knowledge of how passionless he had grown on his frequent trips to the hospital. He pressed their lips together again, in a hungrier kiss, as he hugged Harry's weak body against his own. "I love you," he breathed through chaste kisses against Harry's mouth.
"Sure ... What?"
Draco could still remember that day that they'd walked along the Seine on the second summer of them living together and had visited his parents for a couple of weeks. It had rained heavily on a casual trip strolling through the Parisian streets and they'd had to use Draco's satchel as a cover for the both of them as they'd hurried to duck under a nearby tree for a poor excuse of shelter. It was one of the sweet little moments that he treasured throughout the rest of that summer, and he stole every chance he got to touch Harry. They'd had to be careful around the manor, although one time as they were eating in the dining hall, Harry had slipped his foot out of his shoe and stroked Draco in a few places he didn't think were at all appropriate to touch under a dinner table, especially when he spluttered his wine down his front and choked a couple of times into his napkin. His father had scowled at him and his mother and tutted with a shake of her head. Draco had glared at Harry across the table but the younger man had merely smirked over at him mischievously.
"DON'T!"  Harry shouted, twisting to the side with just enough time to get out of the way of Draco's hex.  He felt the prickling rush of air against his face as it passed, then he leapt forward to tackle the other boy.
"Little obvious, yeah.  Just a bit."
Breathless.
"Muscle pain."  Draco said after a few moments, realizing Harry was watching him, realizing clearly how obvious he'd been.
Harry, maddeningly, chuckled at him, which just made him more angry and he struggled harder against the magical bindings.
--------
"Granger will know."  Draco said in argument, already hoping Harry would argue back.
wrote to me and told me that under no circumstances were you to be at Malfoy Manor when your father was released."
Draco- I don't think I need your permission if I'm going to pay for it myself.
"So we go to Snape."  Draco said, pulling one hand back from around Harry, wiping off his cheeks.  "I don't think we should go to Dumbledore, I think we should go to Snape."
Harry had moved on to a different topic, and one that startled Draco and shook the fog in his head away.
"I know you went to Borgin & Burkes the same day we were in Diagon Alley.  And I know what you went in there for." Harry had been waiting since that day to be able to confide in Draco that he knew this, he was more than a little excited to finally be saying it.
"So does she know?  Or did you just let her think what she wanted about you and..." Harry trailed off, waving his hand a bit.
I hope you enjoy this chapter as well! See you soon!
Draco shifted a bit as a wiggle of something hopeful and promising curled in his belly.  Even more strongly than that tiny little sliver deep inside of him, this one felt like they were turning a corner.  Like they were opening a door to changing things entirely...
“Practically lunch.  Maybe I should teach you how to make a sandwich.”  Neville said, looking critically at the food he had spread across the counter.
“From a mile away with most people.  Like someone closing a book in slow motion, you have time to step away and out of their mind before they shut it.  But you just... One second I could see that the next I was jolted back here.”
--------
But all he had to do, they explained, was go and stay somewhere else for awhile.
"Or you can't leave..."
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
Hermione nodded her head, "Yes. You need to be under medical supervision, Harry, and running off to Blackpool will do nothing to help your condition."
"But WHY Harry?"
"Wha –what do you mean?" the blonde man hushed in a wet whisper.
The blonde's eyes flickered up and he pressed his lips into a thin line before answering. "Potter and I met up last night. He'd gotten some bad news."
As soon as he got into his shared hotel room with Ronald, Harry flopped down onto his bed as soon as he had hung up his dress robes and tie, making sure that they wouldn't crease before the following night and then collapsed in an exhausted heap on his bed. He would have fallen instantly asleep if it wasn't for Ronald flopping onto his own bed, still fully clothed, and his mouth hanging open to allow loud snores to fill the air.
It almost drained Harry to mirror his movements but he felt a little better as soon as he had his glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. Once they were back outside, and as they watched the door disappear back into the brickwork of the wall, and breathing a little easier, Harry turned to Draco and hesitated for a moment, wondering what to say if they should say anything at all.
Seeker had howled all night long.
"It took me ages to understand that I'd developed a sort of –infatuation with you. Although it may have been because you were the only one who seemed interested in taking care of me and making me feel better," he turned to look down at Harry who in turn was staring up at him, his soft green eyes wide open and intense. "You were the only one to give me hope, Harry. I couldn't thank you enough for that. I think I might even Lo-"
Draco shook his head with a heavy sigh, "I don't want you to sit around all night and think of an excuse." He peered up through his fringe, "I just want to spend some time with you. I haven't been sleeping well these past few months because of the late nights you've been pulling and I just want to spend time with you. I'm the
Draco froze.
Harry reached out and rested a hand on Draco's knee, smoothing his thumb over the strong, lean muscles under the cloth, "I do like taking care of you, even now. It's just –easier to do out of love and of my desperate need to not see you ill, than to feel I'm obliged to do so because I'm technically your physician." He smiled over at the blonde who had a vague smirk on his face, "I'm glad that Severus explained it all to you, though. I just know I would have mucked it up and make it sound like a personal insult to you."
"It is when I don't need or ask for it!"
He nodded he head, "I know. I'm just a little surprised that something like this is getting to you."
Upon entering his father's vast study of oak-panelled walls, dark oil paintings and thick embroidered curtains hanging over the windows, Draco drew in a sharp breath of the dusty musk that had followed his father around for the last few months. The air was almost stale in his mouth. It took his breath away, even more so than the numerous boxes stacked around the desk filled with documents and papers that had been dragged out of the attic. He settled himself down into the large leather chair behind the desk and ran his hands through his hair, trying to regain some semblance of energy in himself to tackle all the boxes. He pulled the closest one to him up onto the desk and set about rifling through its contents.
Once they arrived back at the hotel, Draco told Harry to wait in the lobby. Harry obeyed wearily as Draco walked to the very end of the hallway, made a U-turn and descended a flight of stairs to the bar in the basement. The bar was a simple, manly area designed by Cass himself. There was oak paneling along the bottom of the wall, a deep maroon colour on the walls, a Poole table at one end and a large plasma T.V. at the other end. To the left of the T.V. was a built-in bar where Cass was serving a muggle some beer. He found what he was looking for in the corner by the heater; Seeker.
He had spent the journey on his own, in his own little compartment which would have been a luxury in the past, but now it only left him feeling cold and wracked with nerves of what was to come. He had returned to Hogwarts, despite his parents' advice, in good faith that maybe there was some vague possibility that he would be able to eventually make something of himself in the future. That perhaps he hadn't screwed himself up entirely. He had kept himself updated with his private studies, reading in silence with silent tears pouring down his face as he read the Prophets articles about how lowly his family had become on the social ladder and the obituary of his godfather and -at times -dear friend, Severus Snape. That afternoon had been one of the hardest for him. He had cried for hours.
"Well they're not exactly being ignorant," Ginny stated mildly as she looked over at Harry for support. "I mean, he did do most of the things they're accusing him of."
Draco hesitated for a moment, the icy feeling in his stomach hardening and making his heart sink. Pansy looked over her shoulder and then exchanged a look with Blaise. The dark-skinned teen reached out and placed a hand on the blonde's shoulder, "Come on, Draco. It'll be fine." With another squeeze on his shoulder, they managed to ease Draco down into the dungeons for their Potions lesson.
"W-why?" Draco rasped awkwardly as he weak fingers fumbled with the knot.
"Have it your way then," he waved his arm in an arc and cocked his eyebrow, "Lead the way, scarhead."
He said nothing as he stood from the hard plastic chair and followed the nurse through a series of corridors with disinfectant-armed doors, with pin-codes, until they finally arrived at Harry's private room. It was the least Draco could have done for his lover. The nurse hovered for a few moments, adjusting the covers on Harry's bed, before leaving him to his own devices. The door clicked shut, and he exhaled with relief, his mind sobering up instantly at the look of his lover, placed like a delicate flower upon a bland hospital bed, sheets tucked in around him making him look like a mummy.
The man in the doorway tugged the hood from around his face with eyes that made the blonde's stomach knot, "Nice to see you too, dear husband."
"What's all this?" he purred.
' completely out of the blue, and even if his heart wasn't in it with hatred
Draco bowed his head. He had been thinking along the same lines but he couldn't deny just how nervous he was to make such a blatant attempt of 'inter-house-unity' in front of the entire school. He'd be the topic of idol gossip again, and that didn't sit too well with him. However, he couldn't deny that the raven-haired boy needed someone to talk to, as he glanced over at the Gryffindor table, and it was clear his friends weren't paying much attention to him to care. They probably thought he hadn't slept well the night before. As true as that was, Draco also knew that he still wanted to talk and get things off his chest.
He was bone tired and cold by the time he stepped off of the train, leather satchel in his hand, bumping against his knee, as he staggered awkwardly along the station, his legs feeling heavy and his head swimming through a fog as though he was disorientated and didn't know where he was going. Only, he did know. He could walk the familiar route blind-folded if he needed to. He pressed his eyes closed and drew in a long damp breath before exhaling and forcing himself to move out along the main road, keeping himself sheltered in the shadows of the buildings and shuffling his way along to the apothecary and the warm welcoming flat perched on top of it. As he drew nearer to the tall building looming up over him, he stopped on the opposite side of the street. His breathing was shaky, most likely a common cold creeping into his system. He was grateful he had a never ending supply of pepper-up in the storeroom. He ran a hand down his face and felt the energy ebb away. He didn't want to put on a brave but tired face as he went in to Draco. He didn't want to be anywhere near Brittany. He'd much prefer to return to Paris and work the nightshirt at the hospital just to avoid sleeping and the darkness pressing up through the lid of the box that he'd buried it in in the back of his mind.
"Draco you know it doesn't work like that," Harry sighed in an exasperated manner, "I can't just hand over an entire hospital to someone."
Draco shrugged, "why not? You're next course of treatment is not until Tuesday morning. I don't see what the harm would do. Besides -you look as though you could use some fresh air. You look paler than me," he reached over and smoothed his hand over Harry's bald head, the lack of feather-soft black hair made his stomach clench tightly.
"It was like I was floating. I think I died a little before going to the forest; I remember wondering through the hallways, drifting by classrooms like a ghost and seeing no one. No teachers, no death eaters ... I didn't see anything except the destruction. Everywhere was empty. Like every other living soul on the planet had vanished." He licked his lips and sighed, ducking his head forward and reveling in the warmth emanating from Draco's body. "Even the forest was empty. There were no centaurs or wolves or giants. It was completely empty, completely silent and everything was still. I felt like I was walking through a painting."
Draco sniffed and ran a hand down his tear stained cheeks, a choking sob brewing up in his chest again. "Does … Does this mean your my 'wife'?" he teased with a cheeky grin, earning a flick on his ear. They chuckled together for a moment before Harry slipped the ring off the chain and, taking Draco's left hand in his own, he slipped the ring on. Draco stared down at the band, his heart beating in his chest. He was transfixed on how beautiful something so simply could be. He looked up at Harry nervously and licked his lips, "Let me show you how much I love you, Harry," he breathed, leaning in for another soft kiss, his cool hands running up the length of the tanned naked thighs before him, his mouth pressing tenderly to Harry's and his thumbs brushing along the coarse hair between his legs.
,' Harry thought bitterly before dropping his gaze to his clenched fist on the arm of his wicker chair. He swallowed thickly and bit down on his tongue. "Do you mind if I think a little about it?" he rasped out. The idea of spending time with Draco both frightened him and made him nostalgic for the times where being with the blonde man was a task that surpassed everything else.
She shrugged again, "Well it's you and Potter. You'd be the talk of gossip, either way. So, yeah go for it. Why not?"
"Oh wow that is so sweet of him" Harry managed to breathe with a smile, "Oh Merlin I am so tired."
The drive back to London was nothing if peaceful; Harry was so bright and happy that it made every expense worth it. Draco did not care about the small dip in which his savings took. It was for Harry, and that was all that mattered. Seeker lazed about on the backseat cuddled up wit the numerous teddies they had won on their trip. Seeker was a good boy, he didn't chew teddies, he cuddled them, just like a toddler might.
Severus frowned a little and hummed low in his throat, "You should have come to me before when Dreamless Sleep would have benefited you. As it stands, taking it now would only be making your situation worse. I know depression isn't easy to deal with Harry but –"
Draco smiled, his eyes glancing up to the clock on the wall. It was still rather late in the evening but it would be even later by the time they got home. A squeaking noise caught his attention. He turned his head to see the miserable nurse glaring at him, clutching a wheelchair before her. He smirked and then turned to Harry, "Harry? The bitch has brought the wheelchair." Harry's mouth twitched into a ghost of a smile, "come on, we'll get you home."
"Well they were ignoring him when I was there. No tests were being run, nothing. No one even went in to check-up on him. He had not even been bathed for a good few days either judging by the state he was in!"
Draco nodded, trying not to let the tears shine too much in his eyes, "of course I did. Right after I took Seeker for a walk."
Draco twitched his lip at the indication to how much time Harry had spent in St. Mungo's over the past year. He bent down to ruffle Seeker's damp golden ears. "Alright, lets get this mongrel back to the hotel and rinse him down before we go out. I don't think many people will appreciate the smell of wet dog."
They stood in silence for a while, the crackling of the fire the only sound to be heard. Eventually Malfoy lowered his wand, his glare losing some of its intensity as he turned back to walk over by the fireplace and settled down near it. "Whatever," he muttered darkly as he dropped his head forward into his hands and sighed heavily.
"So that I can take care of your health; I have already arranged it with St. Evangelina's and it has been granted that you are to be placed on sabbatical until at you are certified to work again."
"How are you feeling?" Draco's toneless voice resounded in his ears as he continued to stroke the hair out of Harry's closed eyes.
"People's lives would be at stake and I wouldn't be able to relax properly knowing that I could have been the cause of that."
"Thank you for listening," Harry eventually mumbled as he directed his gaze up to the sky, for lack of anything else to say to the older boy.
Harry hummed before leaning to one side and drawing in deep breaths. He needed to psyche himself up a little more but he could feel the words burning inside him. "That night in the forest, after we gathered the dead and put them in the Great Hall, I went down to face him. Hermione knew what I was going to do and why. Ron might have known but I think he wanted to be in denial about it for as long as possible. You know what he's like."
Harry swallowed thickly and struggled to even breath out a soft "yes."
. Harry hesitated for a moment, at which point Draco had slumped back on his pillows, peering up through scrunched up eyelids. Finally, Harry sighed and disentangled himself from the wicker chair, dread filling every step. The two paces between the bed and the chair seemed to warp and lengthen to ten times the original size. He forced himself to put one foot in front of the other. In almost no time at all he was pressing his knees down into the mattress and turning around so that he felt the sleepy heat of Draco's chest and stomach pressing against his back. He curled his knees up and felt hot tears slide down his cheeks as he nestled his head in the crook of Draco's arm. He didn't sleep for the rest of the early hours of the morning, too afraid of what might happen. Instead he listened to the echoing throb of his 'husbands' heartbeat.
With those soft, hushed words Harry felt himself drift off into a heavy slumber.
"A little," Harry murmured. "There we are."
Hermione had been the one to help him charm the shirt after Ron had made the point about the fact that Harry couldn't be around the blonde all the time to protect him. That had given Harry an idea and after a week or so of searching in the library he had found a series of protective charms for garments that aurors would sometimes wear, and despite it taking another week to learn some of the basics, he was more than grateful to prepare a surprise Christmas get away for Ron and Hermione to Switzerland as repayment. He had kept the shirt for another two weeks for 'the right time'. He hoped that Draco was grateful. He had done his best to be discreet. He knew that humiliation was a stain that didn't wash off as easily as dirty dish-water.
Lucius paused for a moment and seemed to be contemplating the possibility. "Well if that is indeed the case then what would you suggest countering it?"
Harry's lower lip wobbled a little at the memories dancing in the flames of the fire before he wiped at his dampening lashes and cast a shy eye around the room, "To this day I'm still surprised we're back here again. I was sure Severus was going to sell this place to Slughorn."
Harry nodded with a smile, "sure there's fish-and-chips or fish-and-chips," he chuckled to himself as they passed a small smoothie stand on their corner. They walked over the huge road and stepped down onto the beach, the dry sand tickling their ankles as they walked. "I've missed the sun," Harry grinned as Seeker bounded around their legs, running ahead and sending sand clouds flying high. Draco laced their fingers together and smiled softly as they walked. The sun did feel good on his skin, but what he really wanted was a lovely shower. He felt so grubby from the long, sweaty car ride. Harry suddenly stopped and tugged Draco to a standstill beside him. Draco frowned down at him and was about to open his mouth to question the sudden halt when Harry tiptoed up and pressed his mouth against Draco's. It was a shy, tender kiss with all the familiarity and warmth of a life-long-love.
Harry gave a small airy laugh and stroked his fingers along Draco's arm, smoothing down the baby-fine blond hairs on the blond skin. He tilted his head to one side and smiled lazily as Draco's fringe tickled his forehead. He reached up to stroke a finger down Draco's nose and grimaced as his forearm came into contact with the drying trail of cum on his chest. "Goddamnit! I might as well go and clean up before we get into cuddling,"
The blonde breathed a smile and let his eyes drifted closed for a few moments, relishing in the after-glow of their love-making. They stayed that way for a while, cuddled together, their bodies kept warm by the fireplace as they lay curled in the armchair. At around eleven o'clock when the school clock chimed out over the grounds, they groaned in dismay and slowly disentangled themselves from one another and shuffled about, gathering their clothes off of the floor and pulling it on over their aching, wobbly muscles. As they left the room behind them, the door disappearing as they drifted hand-in-hand down the corridor, smiled grew on their mouths that, no matter how hard they tried, wouldn't go away. At the staircase, Draco turned to Harry, cupped his face in his hand and pressed their mouths together in a slow, exploring kiss that made the brunette's heart sing.
"Alright, well I'll be right back. I'm just going in to McDonald's. Do you want your usual order?" he asked as he frantically unfastened his seat-belt and made sure that he had enough muggle money in his wallet. Harry merely nodded his head once again, and shifted in his seat to get more comfortable. Draco did his best not to fret over Harry as he entered the florescent restaurant, his left hand often fingering his jean pocket to make sure that his wallet was still confined within. The line seemed to take forever as he shifted gradually closer to the counter to be served. As soon as he had ordered and paid, he quickly turned and departed from the building and towards the car.
Harry knew that as soon as the silent screamed in his ears he wouldn't be able to lift the pillow; if he didn't lift the pillow then it wouldn't be real and he wouldn't have to face the reality of those cold, dead grey eyes and the look of fear etched permanently into Draco's alabaster features. He wouldn't want to live with that image engraved into his mind, but every night when he fell asleep the image would spring up through the blackness and he'd sweat and thrash about trying to bat it away out of sight, even in his own mind. It was becoming harder and harder with every passing night and he couldn't even use dreamless sleep since not only had it proven ineffective, but also because Severus had taken all the phials out on the rare occasion he had left his bedchamber.
Once she had scuttled away, Harry smiled over at Draco and nudged his foot under the table, "you know how to make me feel a whole lot better, Draco," Draco smiled but said nothing, his hands clasped together upon the tabletop. Harry frowned weakly. "Draco?"
That was a challenge in itself.
Harry hummed is consent as he shuffled off of the edge of the bed and fiddled with his jeans, until they fell to his ankles. He stepped out of them and swiped his toasted pyjamas off of the radiator and hastily dressed into them, before crawling back over the bed and shuffling underneath the thick duvet cover. Draco watched as Harry hummed in delight at the cocoon of warmth in which he was now wrapped in. He wiggled around, looking like a huge caterpillar. Draco could not contain his laughter at how adorable his lover looked. "You all snuggly, are you?" he quipped as he stirred the hot chocolate into the milk and water.
Harry nodded his head with a small smile as he stepped onto the polished marble tiles and trailed after the maid to the drawing room. The décor was just as beautiful as the hotel where the functions were being held. The tapestries were intricately woven and vast as they hung on the walls and the paintings of the families predecessors were breath-taking, if a little dark in the wide, somewhat gloomy room. If it hadn't been for the sunlight then the place would look rather bleak and miserable. The young maid cleared her throat and the two blonde heads looked up towards the door. Harry felt his cheeks heat up a little. Lucius inclined his head and beckoned him forward, whereas Draco puffed his chest out a little bit. Harry advanced into the room and stood on ceremony beside Lucius and Draco's chair, not entirely sure of what to do with himself. Lucius stood up and then waved Harry down into his chair. "Do sit, Mister Potter, I have business to attend to elsewhere. I daresay you brought some material to read to my son, have you not?"
"Well you're here with me now, aren't you?" Draco asked softly with a lazy smile as he raked his hands through Harry's hair. "Although, I do think we need to be heading to bed now."
He didn't try to
Draco snickered lightly and rolled up into a sitting position as Harry rolled over to ease himself off of the bed. "Do you want a shower or are you going to run a bath?" he did not mind running the bath for Harry, the poor young man had most likely exerted himself to his maximum limit.
If anyone noticed just how withdrawn and tired both Harry and Draco looked the following morning, nobody made a show of commenting or even noticing it as they all settled down in the garden for a bright summer morning breakfast with Narcissa and Severus. Lucius had been called away earlier for a meeting with the French politicians of the wizarding community. Not that anyone minded too much. As shrewd as his mother could be, Narcissa knew when to bring up the heavy topics and as she had long since given up on getting her own son married off to a nice young heiress, not many of the other subjects should have made them tense up. However, it appeared that they had gotten to the stage in their tense relationship that
She inwardly groaned that she was partnered up with Granger of all people.
"Harry, love? Are you going to wake up for me?" Draco whispered softly, resting his chin on his folded hands, resting on top of Harry's blankets.
He would make Potter pay for this and this time, he was going to see it through.
"Not great," he admitted, "The classes are running together, homework is boring and mind-numbing and I'm dreading the exams because I know I could drool on them and still pass with flying colours."
Hermione huffed to herself, her hands planting themselves on her hips. "Well be quick and get dressed Harry, the sooner we take you back the better."
"That's such a cheap tactic, Draco, even for you." There was no malice in Harry's words, so that blonde didn't take it
Harry licked his lips, still stroking himself.
People often asked what two grown men would be doing, playing hide-and-seek. The truth was they had done it because the puppy was hyper and needed something to play. So Harry, in all his child-like innocence, had opted to play hide-and-seek with the puppy. An offer Draco had been unable to refuse. It had turned into a rather enjoyable afternoon; the puppy was a menace at the best of times. When Harry hid under the bed he had yelped when Seeker had grabbed his sock and pulled it free from his foot and galloped off down the hallway. When Draco had hidden in the coat closet the puppy had backed up and galloped to the door, hitting its head against it every time until Draco gave-up, scooped him off the floor and kissed the pups head, earning him a large, triumphant lick.
think you're doing?" he spat out as he glared up at the man standing against the apartment door before turning back around in the chair, the letter twisted tightly in his sweaty palm and quickly stuffed the others back into his leather satchel and kicked it underneath his chair with his foot and sighed.
," he stressed, "Would you do me the pleasure of going on a date with me his Saturday?"
The Central Pier was cramped with the same dart-games, however there were far too many for it to be 'fun' and it seemed more like a 'gamble'. But they did manage to have fun riding the huge Ferris Wheel down the very end. Harry had found it exciting as he could see for miles all around. Draco was far too comfortable with gripping the pole in the center of their pod that allowed the whole thing to spin and turn. It made him feel queasy as the breeze twisted them.
All the while, Draco continued to eat completely unaware that his friends were up to anything out of the ordinary. He was more focused on when Harry decided to leave the Great Hall and how long he should wait afterwards before he left too. He knew he was probably acting a little irrationally, but his heart was throbbing in his chest. He felt the words climbing up the back of his throat. He wanted to ask Harry now but could he really do it in front of all his Gryffindor friends? He didn't want to, but he also knew he wouldn't get much or a choice after that evening anyway. He leaned over to Pansy and nudged her arm, "Hey Pansy?"
"Don't be bitter," Severus snapped and watched as Harry twitched on the bed, his breathing easing into a normal rhythm. "All I am trying to point out is that a lot of your current problems could have been avoided if you had sought help. There's no weakness in asking for help, you know? Even I have asked for help on many occasions. Lucius often asks for my opinion on new deals he could make and how to go about some situations in politics, and even thought politics isn't my forte I manage to give him some insight."
He shouldn't have let it bother him, he really shouldn't especially not when he was dodging bolts of fire from an angry Hungarian Horntail. He couldn't get burned to death without giving as good as he got to Malfoy. That's when it clicked in his head. His firebolt! As soon as he landed on the broom relief rushed through him as he soared up into the air.
He had decided that night to cook dinner and to broach the subject to Harry. It had been nervous as Hell, questioning as to whether he was ready for this commitment or not, and on top of that, would he even be able to cope with a dog running riot all over the place? It had seemed like forever until Harry had come home that night. Just in time for dinner. He had been surprised to say the least to see a huge gourmet dinner spread out on the table in their small kitchen –but it was a gesture made with such love and precision that his heart had melted and he had smiled that smile. It had been worth it.
"Woke up to your screaming, didn't I?" he hissed, his eyes pouring venom out into the open air, "how DARE you talk to him like that? How fucking -dare you!" he advanced closer, making the nurse back up against the desk. From over the nurses' head Draco could see eyes turning to stare. "You have no right to be working here if you are not neutral to peoples backgrounds, you pathetic bitch!"
Draco cracked an eyelid open and grumbled. "Exhausted ... You sure know how to wear a man out, scarhead."
"Oh my God Draco!" Harry moaned out, "Ahh move! Please move!"
Harry chuckled against his ear. "I was thinking maybe this year we could make love ... without magic."
"Ah! You must be Mister Malfoy!" came a cheery Southern accent from the small flight of stairs to the front door. An Indian man with ash grey hair stood there in a black collared shirt and dark trousers. His shoes shined as he descended the stairs, hand out-stretched, "my name is Cass and I will be here to serve you, as will my wife Oli"
He wished desperately that he could bring that teasing light back to Harry's eyes, but he didn't know what he could do that wouldn't irritate the brunette man. He slid his hand across the table top and gently touched Harry's fingertips with his own, smiling weakly in the candlelight. It took a few light touches before Harry's own twitched in response, and leaned over a little so that they would link their fingertips together. It made Draco's chest ache painfully, so painfully it almost hurt him to breathe properly without the threat of tears, that this was the most willing Harry had been able to touch him in a fortnight. They hadn't made love, not properly, for just over a month. Whenever they did, Harry made sure that it was over with quickly and didn't seem 'all there' during, which really put Draco off from enjoying the experience. He wanted to be 'one' with Harry; mind, body and soul. All Harry was giving him at the moment was his body, and sometimes it was rarely even that. They used to wake up every morning a tangle of limbs splashed golden in the sunlight filtering in through the blinds, their hair messed up and their hips pressed into one another's so tightly that neither of them were willing to disentangle themselves from the sweet, sweaty mess of limbs. Now it was like there was a schism between them, growing larger by the day. They now almost always slept on opposite ends of the bed, but it wasn't for Draco's lack of trying. Sometimes he would pretend to sleep until Harry eventually fell unconscious, before he would shuffle his body over the warm sheets and curl up against the tanned man's body. He'd press his nose into Harry's neck, the hairs on the nape of his neck tickling his mouth, as he pulled the younger man back against him, cradling him through the night.
When it came to South Pier Draco was physically exhausted and Harry was starting to look a little grey around the gills, however the sickly man begged his lover to ride the log-flume with him. Draco hadn't the heart to argue with him. He allowed Harry to tug him weakly alongside him as they strolled down to the log-flumes. There was a small queue but this did not seem to irritate Harry like it did the blond man. However as soon as they were planted in the make-shift log and the metal chains cranked beneath them, Draco felt his heart skipping furiously in his chest. He tightened his hold of Harry as the sunlight danced on their faces. The sudden drop made his stomach lurch into his throat as water rained down on them from all sides. The only joy of the ride had been Harry's breathless laughter.
He clawed his hands through his hair and struggled to keep the rage inside of how unfair it all was and how he wished he could take all of it back. He wanted a way out -any way -but there was nothing! Nothing but the torment and the torture and the nightmares. He just wanted to sleep, to get away from everything, to have just one moment of peace from the world tormenting him.
"Seeker!" he called out, straightening his back muscles, "dinner time!"
The blonde man slipped his hand over Harry's and squeezed, "Oh, I know." He drew in a deep breath and flexed his shoulder muscles, "So are you going in tomorrow?" he asked quietly.
,' once again the words faded and a new little message reappeared. In the early morning light, Draco held his breath and waited for the next message to appear. '
Harry nodded and sat up along the mattress and stole a chaste kiss, "I'm sorry, I don't mean to spoil tonight," he wiped hastily as his eyes, "Let me go and light the fire. I don't want either of us getting a chill in the middle of the night." As he stood up and went to stoke the fire and tug a nightshirt on over his head, he tried to calm his racing mind. He didn't want to feel the guilt forever but how could he let it go? He couldn't just do it simply because that's what Draco wanted. As soon as the fire started to flicker in the grate he wiped at his eyes, drew in a few deep breaths and straightened up, his back muscles protesting a little. He swallowed thickly and then turned back around to trail back to the bed, when he stopped.
"I'm more than willing," Draco breathed out in his deepening, raw voice. Harry felt a shiver run down his spine and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up on end.
But the argument he'd had with his mother still rang in his ears...
Draco laughed at that, running a hand through his hair to push it back.  "Is it really bad?"
He shrugged, shaking his head a bit as he stared at them in return, almost daring them to comment.  “What?  I'm just being honest.  There's no point in speaking badly about him and underestimating the enemy.”
Draco hesitated for a moment.  Trying to remember clearly what was in the letter but it had been so many years he only had a vague recollection.  Part of him wanted to clamp his hand against the drawer and then once Harry left, move all of the letters somewhere else.
Harry lifted one shoulder in a small shrug, thinking that made sense.  He picked up the ring, trying it on a couple of fingers before sliding it onto his left pinky.  It fit there nicely and Borgin was right.  The ring was so thin it was hardly noticeable.  The sheen and draw that it had next to the other pieces of jewelry was gone.
“I will certainly consider it.”  Draco's non-compliant smirk returned as he looked over at Harry.  “Thank you for bringing my owl, Potter.  As loathe as I am to say anything nice to you, that was very kind and I appreciate it.”
“House rivalry doesn’t run in the family.” Draco said, almost apologetically, making Harry jerk his head around to look at him.
It was kind of sickening...
He moved one hand between them and Draco's breathing hitched painfully in his chest as he felt Harry's hand curl around his hard flesh.  Then he moaned a moment later as he felt his length pressed against Harry's, pinned together by both of the other boy's hands that immediately started stroking them.   It sent ripples of heat through him that made his toes curl.  Made both hands fist hard into Harry's dark hair, pulling at it as he licked into the other boy's mouth.
But that would mean leaving his mother here at the Manor alone with him.  And he didn't think he could do that.  No matter the coward he knew he was, he could not let his mother live here alone with his father.  Not when they had no idea what he would be like and what to expect.
Some people threatened him.
"You know what I mean."  Harry said, leaning forward a bit so he could whisper to the other boy, his words so low they barely made a sound.  "I know, Draco, I guessed when I saw you in Borgin and Burkes.  I've seen you favour your arm since the start of school.  I'm not going to run off and tell anyone, I would have done it already if I intended to."
something Draco needed there was a good chance the other boy would eventually figure that out and come back for it.
It's the last time they'll see each other before break....  They might as well make the most of it...
Tom put a hand on the back of Harry's neck, pushing his head down so swiftly and hard that Harry didn't have half a second to protest before he tumbled down into the memory.
"You need to write to your mother.  First step...  Write to your mother, I'll bring it to Dumbledore tomorrow.  We'll get it sent, we'll get her safe."
"Merlin...  You need heavier shoes, I didn't even hear you walking."
"I can't help you if you don't tell me what's going on."
Neville stayed quiet for a few moments, thinking, then scratched the side of his head as he turned his eyes towards Draco's face.  “What if we got you a way to communicate with him?  Letters.  Through Floo or Owl?  Would you consider writing to him then?”
As he reached for the drawer of his desk that the bang had come from, he hesitated.  The whole front of it was shuddering, like something was trying, unsuccessfully, to push it open from the inside which meant that whatever the noise had been, it wasn't anything Muggle.
Draco turned then, walking away with his head held up, chin raised imperiously as he made his way back towards the party.  Snape had some nerve... thinking he could be part of this.  Thinking he could take his glory, his success away from him.  And his mother...  He'd have words for HER over Christmas break.  She didn't need to----
Harry, thankfully, had prepared him for every possible Muggle contingency.
“What?”  Draco looked at Harry like he didn't believe him, sliding back onto one of the counter stools and reaching to pull his phone towards him.  “You're exaggerating.  They go up and down, that's all that anyone needs to know.”
Paul looked at him like he'd turned in a newt.  Like he'd grown two extra heads.
Harry approached the counter warily, keeping his wand pointed at Borgin as he looked at the tray of assorted bits and pieces and extremely ornate jewelry.  This was junk, he was sure.  All crammed together on a tray with no apparent regard to care for any of it.  He scoffed, nodding his head towards it.  "Really?"
A request for help...
Draco has seen it.  It's an episode he hated (and he's seen them all to date) because it sort of reminded him of his own life.
"A week from tomorrow."
“But it's busted, right?”  Ron said, trying to get back into the conversation, sitting up a bit and looking back and forth between Harry and Hermione on either side of him.  “So it doesn't matter, it's broken.”
“Don’t start what?”  Draco raised one eyebrow, the side of his mouth curving upwards as he looked at the other boy.
"Draco..."
Draco smiled, just watching the other man for a few moments before he spoke again.  "I can't be seen with you in public.  At least.. not right now."
"I have it started, it won't be too bad."  Draco said, but then hesitated, looking forward again, swinging his legs a little bit.  "But if you want to help we can meet at the library or something."
“It's.. brilliant...”  Draco said, closing his eyes immediately after he spoke, rubbing his fingers against the middle of his forehead when the words came out so utterly sarcastically even the bright Beaming Young Auror seemed to falter.
Draco shifted, getting to his feet.  He reached out and touched the door handle, then pulled his hand back again.  "Why?"
"And that, Harry, is why I truly believe you will win this war."
But he thought, again, as he had several times over the past few days, that maybe he should have just stayed home and taken his chances.
"Your father is being released from Azkaban."  Narcissa spoke the words in a completely different tone than the cold one she has been using.  Her eyes watching Draco carefully in a way they hadn't before.
Draco hadn't tried to talk to him again, but the half muttered comments that were disguised to LOOK like the Auror intended him not to hear, when actually he intended him to hear every word, continued.
And Harry kissing him...
“Brooms would be too slow, you could be followed.”  Draco added, sighing as he leaned back on his hands and looked at the cabinet.
Certainly that would mean Draco himself would have to explain why he didn't initiate any contact with Theodore, or with anyone, but he could tackle that topic when it actually came up.
Yawning, he dug a book out of his bag and leaned back against the stone arch as he opened it, thinking he'd read here until it got dark then decide what to do next.
Harry made a sharp noise, nearly dropping his books as he left Defence Against the Dark Arts.  Someone had seized the back of his robes and pulled, making him stumble back until he found himself in a doorway, staring at Draco in bewilderment for a few moments.  “What do---”
Merlin, it was jut one hit after another this morning, wasn't it.  Draco tried not to falter or squeeze his eyes shut or think too hard about what Neville was saying as he passed the mug to him.  He managed to nod, managed to look up to Neville's eyes.  “He did.  Why?”
"Lots.  You can get Chinese or pizza or curry or.. just about anything really.  It's a big business, people use it instead of cooking for themselves."
He didn't just automatically want to fall in with Voldemort.
Draco could feel that leaden sort of stillness start crawling up his legs, the fog edging at his brain, wanting to pull him in.  Just that, just hearing this was 'not good' from Harry, meaning it was even worse than what Narcissa had said about Lucius coming home.  That was enough to make him want to just turn inwards and disappear.
Harry- Good night, Ferret.
"How do you know who he is?"  Ron demanded, frowning himself when Harry shrugged.  Harry had taken to doing a lot of shrugging in the past few weeks.
But they'd had fun.  Merlin they had fun together...
"Finally we'll have someone decent to teach us Defence Against the Dark Arts."  Malfoy said while Crabbe and Goyle grunted their agreement.  "Not that Umbridge was bad, exactly but..."
“Why here?”  Harry asked when teenage Tom walked from the living room and into the kitchen.
Draco just shrugged, clearly he didn't have an answer.  It didn't really matter and both of them knew that.  What mattered was that they were there, together, face to face for the first time in months.
But the voice was enough.  And Draco stopped smiling immediately.
Idiot.
“Oh gods above..”  Draco said with a half laugh, rolling his eyes but with more good nature behind it.  “Now I don't want it.  Not if it's going to make YOU happy about me learning stuff.”
been like this before.  Certainly she's been careful about doing things 'proper' that are seen publicly, but this is..  This is absolutely NONE of her business.  And she has no RIGHT to speak to you that way...."
The warm places were making the cold retreat.  They were making his ribs relax, and he could gulp in anxious and needy breaths of air.
“I completely understand.  And I want Draco to understand the problem I feel Scorpius is facing which is why I don’t want to chance writing an owl to him and have him misunderstand the tone I’m speaking in.  Because he could read it completely differently than I intended, given our rather colourful past.”
Instead, he swallowed the lump in his throat, leaning forward with his elbows on his lap and his face still in his hands and he thought.  He tried to organize everything he was thinking and feeling and sort it appropriately.
-----------
Oh Merlin...  Draco had to work not to roll his eyes.  Because now he had to try and pretend to be extra grateful.  This was the
Harry was silent for a few moments.  Long enough that Draco started to feel uncertain about what was going on behind those dark eyes.  Then he closed the very small distance between them.  The hand in the side of Draco's robes moved, curling in the front of them up closer to his throat, then he pulled, forcing Draco's head down with a small noise of surprise.
It ignores a good deal of what the “Epilogue” led us to believe, though some parts I’m keeping because it adds to the story. If you love the Epilogue and everything it represents don’t read this. ;) )
He forgot the things he had to do this year for a little while when they passed notes in class.
"What?"  Harry asked, frowning at Draco who was looking directly at his hands.  "Oh you're so fancy...  Fine."
“I'm not.. partial one way or another.”  He ventured, looking back to the young man's face and immediately hating the way he saw a slightly curious expression pass over it.  He assumed that meant that he
Draco continued looking silently out the window until he heard plates being set down on the table, only then did he turn back to the world inside the restaurant, hoping that food would be enough distraction for Harry to leave him alone and stop asking questions.
“Don't start anything.” Ginny muttered in his ear before turning to hustle the children towards the train doors.  She misinterpreted the stare Harry was giving his old enemy as one of hate rather than one of fierce curiosity.
But once again he couldn't find what he was looking for.  And he wasn't so engrossed in the work that he could  figure it out any more plainly than before, working himself into an absolute lather before he hurled his book on the floor and swore rather profusely.
“What is it?”  Hermione asked, leaning forward in her chair worriedly.
"And you risked walking through the castle at night to share that with me?"
“He said the flat is brilliant!” The Young Beaming Auror said, seemingly mollified that Draco was, actually, happy about this.
“Professors do not generally meet with parents one on one during the school year.  Especially not when they are said professor’s former sworn enemy.”
Draco laughed, putting his face into his hands as he flushed.  “Oh Merlin don't even...  I don't want to admit to it.”
He sat down in the chair, gloating over his success and eager to go back to the Manor the next day to try it on something else and maybe start locating more important things.  But something was odd about the galleon he was holding.  He turned it over in his hands, peering closer at it to try and figure out what was wrong.
Forgetting breakfast, which had been his initial goal, he started pulling everything back out of the cupboards and the fridge, and began arranging it in groups of the counters.
Draco shook his head, pushing his hands further into his pockets.  "No.  But I don't really associate with that many people to be honest.  Not anymore."
A fresh wave of tears took the other boy and Draco turned on the floor away from Harry as his shoulders shook.  "No one can help.  Not even you."
Draco had been enraged when he'd heard Harry had gone to Dumbledore.  Harry had expected that, really.  He hadn't thought it would go over easily.  And when Harry had given him the letter Draco held it, looking so pale and stricken Harry was worried he might pass out.
“Give what back?”  Draco asked, tilting his head up to smile non-chalantly into Harry's face, picking up a cup from the coffee table next to him, taking a sip from the straw.
“What do you want.” Harry spit the words out in agitation.
“You know you do, and I know you do...” Draco’s smile turned dark, his voice low with Harry so close to him.  “But no one else believes it.  How many times have you told them I’m up to something this year alone? How many times have you said I was behind the necklace that cursed that Bell girl? And how many times have you truly been taken seriously?”
Hermione shifted to get to her feet, pacing in front of the fire as she thought.  It gave Harry a bit of space to try and calm himself down again.  He couldn't believe how easy this had been...  The night before, after he and Draco had parted ways, he had come back to the common room and sat sort of on the edges, shooting uncertain looks over towards Hermione and Ron.  When it got late he got up, made like he was going to walk over to them and then hesitated.  He looked at them plaintively, then looked down at his feet and turned and walked to the stairs to go up to the dorms as dejectedly as he could.
Draco slid off his stool with some effort, honestly wishing he could just go back to bed.  This was all so tedious.  Talking to Neville was work.  He knew the other man didn't mean to make it so difficult but that didn't really fix anything.
After that Neville taught him the toaster, which Draco had to admit was a VERY clever device.  All it did was make toast, it wasn't for anything else.  Which seemed superfluous to Draco, but also interesting.  Left to his own devices he likely would have toasted the entire loaf of bread just for the fun of it, but Neville stopped him after six slices and he moved on to buttering the toast instead.
It ignores a good deal of what the “Epilogue” led us to believe, though some parts I’m keeping because it adds to the story. If you love the Epilogue and everything it represents don’t read this. ;) )
"Don't you think that's strange, Harry?"  Hermione asked almost timidly.
Draco chuckled softly, turning his hand to touching his fingers against Harry's in return.  "Thank you."
Harry nodded, patting a hand against Draco's arm.  "That's good.  You feeling okay?"
Harry's steps faltered in a dark hallway, one hand moving to his forehead as his scar suddenly burned to life.
Harry got to his feet and joined him and they both started going room by room, poking into things that Harry had barely even looked at, let alone touched.  Harry offered Draco anything he wanted to take from the house since the things there were technically family things, but he didn't want anything.
Well that was... not expected...
“Harry..”  Hermione said tentatively, placing a hand on his arm. “We think you need a break.  You need to go somewhere and rest.  Properly rest.”
Chapter Summary - Harry is dreaming again...  Dreaming but not...  But this time he's rather delighted to find Draco with him.  It doesn't take them long to find their host for the evening.  A host with a few very important questions for them...
at him.
"It is the thing Draco should have wanted.  And what I would have offered him if he hadn't threatened me.  I assume you saw what happened while Mr Malfoy was in here, otherwise why would your bushy haired, tactless friend come in here... And now you, yourself."
He retreated to the couch, sinking down into the cushions and flopping himself back.  He closed his eyes, rubbing his hands over his face with a long low breath.
have a preference.
“Oh that was
As he sat there the fingers of his left hand twitched, and he felt the squirm of the skin on the inside of his left forearm.  He looked to make sure the hall was empty the he shoved his hand under the sleeve of his robe and rubbed at his arm, his stomach squirming for a whole other reason.
Chapter Summary - Told from Draco's POV-  Draco can scarcely believe that Harry has changed so much so quickly.  They're friends now, he can say that with almost certainty...  He doesn't understand it, but he really is enjoying it...
But he followed, going up the hall a ways behind Snape, slowing his steps as the older man did before stopping a few feet away from him.  "What is it?"  He dropped the pretence of being polite, not caring one bit if he was rude to Snape now that others couldn't see them.  Having Harry as an ally, working with him, having him as a confidante and friend had instilled some of Draco's swagger back into him.  Some of his confidence and his ego had been well repaired and he didn't give two figs what it was Snape wanted.
“Just a bit.  And no I won't tell you how.  We are still on very tentative ground here, you and I.  At present I know more about that then you do, but probably not for much longer.”  Tom sighed out a low breath, sitting back against the couch as he crossed his legs at the knee.  “What memory of Slughorn's did Dumbledore show you?”
"Hey.."
Oh MERLIN.
Draco raised his head to look at Harry, taking in his response for just a few moments, absorbing it, parsing it for any underlying issue, then shifted to throw his arms around Harry's shoulders.
"Just tell me why."
“Thank you.”  He muttered, getting up from his stool and walking to the living room.  He was oblivious to the odd look Harry gave him once his back was turned, but he wouldn't have particularly cared anyways.  “I don't think I need anything else from you.”
Draco held his breath, he hated himself for being so hopeful and thinking so much of something so simple.  But he couldn't help it.  This strange, tentative-but-growing friendship he and Harry had started meant way too much to him.  Logically he knew he should temper it and try not to pin so much on it.  But he WANTED it.  And Draco was decidedly terrible at denying himself anything he wanted.
“He was
"Perfect."  Harry said after what seemed like ages, but had only been a few seconds.  "I have Quidditch practice tonight, we could meet tomorrow?"
"Surprising, though.  And you're right I didn't.  But I was feeling so shit about the whole Goblet of Fire, two champions from Hogwarts situation that I didn't like knowing something Cedric didn't."
“Well..”  Draco said the one word hesitantly.  There was something he wanted to know but he had been hoping to ask Neville about it rather than Harry.
But this is what came from socializing with people.  He could only control himself, which is what he did for seven years, and he did a very good job of it.  As soon as other people were added into the mix, you never knew what was going to be said, what trouble they'd poke and prod into...
He didn't want to just
“Can I help you Professor McGonagall?” He asked, trying to separate himself from the boy he used to be and the teacher he was now.  Something distinctively difficult with McGonagall, he had to admit.
“Guess so.”  Harry said in return, smiling at the other boy who seemed to be joining him on his level, finally.  “What were you dreaming before you saw me.”
Harry trailed off when Draco couldn't help but turn his eyes to Harry, unable to keep the look of fear off his face, silently pleading with the other man to not say anything else.  About ANYthing.
And deliberately asking to be put on his protection team.
He hated himself for every word he said, but he knew it was for good cause.  He knew that across the hall Draco was sitting at Slytherin and probably watching him.
"I totally understand."
"Oh and then some.  How'd you know that?"
They filed out of the train and headed to the carriages, settling in for the ride up to the castle.  Harry was well and truly lost in thought by the time they slid out at the castle gates, not thinking much about the fact that suddenly there was a bottleneck of students until Hermione spoke in an urgent whisper.
"Maybe I don't want to be invited.  That sounds unpleasant."
It took them a good hour and a half before they left again.  Neville told him as they went in that he was going to talk to the sales person as though he was buying the phone for himself.  But that if Draco heard them ask any questions about the phone that that he actually understood that he could speak up and say what he wanted.
It wasn't until close to midnight when a flurry of wings came in through the window, and his lap was suddenly full of Owl that he startled awake.
So instead, he left.  At least if he left it was kind of like he was being ousted from the community and forced to go off alone.  It was sort of a repayment...  And it turned out to be quite easy to do, actually.  His parents were so preoccupied and utterly out of their heads they didn't even notice him walking around the Manor with a sack, putting into it anything that was valuable and not magickal.  Candlesticks, flatware, jewellery, gem stones, trinkets of gold and silver...
"How did you know about that??" Harry asked, looking at the other boy in surprise.
He took another step closer to Harry, straightening up so that his height put him above the other man, even if Harry did outweigh him and out muscle him by a fair bit.  “You seem to forget that I am an
--------
"I remember."  Draco said, trying to keep his voice neutral but he swallowed roughly, the very vivid memory surfacing in his mind again, his own flesh hidden under his hands twitching slightly at the recollection.
And he'd been perfectly fine.
“It should be easier now.”  Draco said, finally looking back up at Harry.  “Everything has changed.  We're friends now, we're on the same side.  It should be simple, that attraction.”
"Really? At the Gryffindor table?" Theo asked, looking between the two of them.
Draco summoned reached down and swiped the pajama bottoms off of the side of the bed, before bending completely under Harry's weight and opening the trousers between them. "Come on, you, one foot at a time," Harry smiled as he rested on Draco for support as he stepped into the soft bottoms. Once in them, Draco gently pinged the elasticized waist and smirked, "they fit nicely". Harry's eyes brightened a fraction as Draco eased him back down onto the mattress.
Harry mentally counted to ten before forcing the shirt into Draco's stomach where, thankfully, his hands automatically came up to grab it. He reached over and swiped up Draco's shirt from the sink, flapped it open and charmed it dry, before slipping it on over his chest, squirming a little in discomfort. "I'll give it back when I can," he stated before pulling his grey jumper back on over his head and quickly leaving the bathroom.
Draco smiled and shook Cass' hand. "Hello, my name is Draco and this is Harry -and our hyper little dog, Seeker"
Severus narrowed his eyes a fraction but inclined his head, "Yes, I want to know about everything. Anything that springs to mind that hasn't been happening recently. Also, I want you to tell me that last time you felt 'happy'. Even remotely happy, can you do that for me?" Draco nodded his head, feeling his entire body tense up when his godfather's cool, bottomless eyes turned on him. "I will be asking Harry to do the same. I don't expect him to be truthful on the matter if my suspicions are correct, but I would like both points of view to compare notes and determine how I can help the both of you. Sometimes you need a third person perspective on things, a fresh pair of eyes, to make sure that I understand all that I can and how I can help."
Draco glanced into the bag and accepted the hot-water bottles, his stomach flip-flopping as he did so. "Th-thank you Cass. I really appreciate it."
The following evening when they were all freshly shaven and dipped with a little scented oil behind the ears of a small aftershave derived from the 'love potion' to make one desirable to engage in a conversation. Apparently the evening prior Ronald and Dennis had not made great progressing in approaching people to discuss their new line of work and so Harry entered the ballroom that evening feeling a little on the energetic side, seeing as he was the only one who had been able to converse with someone let alone someone of such important as the heir to the Malfoy fortune. Harry had personally been praised by Snape beforehand.
"Because it's a shadow of what it used to be for you. It's nothing but a mass grave right now, and even you can't deny that," the blonde reasoned mildly.
Someone actually seemed to be looking out for him.
"You're really beautiful you know that, baby?" the blond man breathed as he stroked his thumb over Harry's knuckles. Harry smiled and turned his face to Draco's, their noses rubbing together.
"I promise."
"What was that for?" Draco asked softly, a smile on his mouth as he brushed his thumb against Harry's hollow cheeks.
Pursing his lips he pocketed the map inside his muggle hoodie and quickly squeezed his feet into his trainers before grabbing his wand and left the Tower.
Draco did his best to unclench his muscles and then hissed in pain as Harry's cold, slick finger swathed his insides with the cooling salve that would also heal any abrasions caused during the rough passionate sex.
Harry spread the pale legs even wider, pressing himself flat against Draco as he nipped a trail up his throat, revelling in the soft panting coming from his lover.
He trembled as something heavy, warm and dry fell around his shoulders and blared like a tartan mess in his line of vision. Hands hooked under his armpits and he was lifted away from the wooden planks, not realising that it was his body being moved, or his feet dragging roughly behind him. Wooden planks turned into grass in a flash. The floor beneath him faded and reappeared slower and slower as he blinked through heavy eyelids. He could feel the dark fog creeping into his waterlogged head again. Words and noises were muffled around him, as though his head was wrapped in bandages and distorted the sound. There was a steady drumming in his ears and humming through his chest, but he was pretty sure that it was a heart that didn't belong to him.
"I'm not expecting you to," the ex-healer insisted as he leaned back in his own chaise, "But even if you talk to him about the weather or the family of moths in your fathers study, you need to do this for him. Just this and nothing else."
"Absolutely not," were the words that made his anger boil within his veins as he had described Harry's want for a weekend away to the nurses. "He is beyond too weak for such taxing activities," she arched an eyebrow at him, "He has to remain in hospital."
He was sound asleep within minutes.
Draco smiled and then delicately removed the glasses from Harry's nose, wiping the fogged lenses on his jumper as he did so. He smoothed a hand over Harry's bald head, removing the cotton cap as he did so, before bending over the water to kiss his lover's forehead, "beautiful" he murmured before reaching for a flannel that was hanging on the side of the bath. He dipped the flannel into the warm water and then took Harry's bony, fragile arm in his hand, running the drenched flannel over the bruised skin. Draco's features creased into a frown as he ran his thumbs over the bruises where the needles had injected the chemotherapy toxins into his lover's already broken body -why had the bruised areas not healed yet?
Harry blinked in surprise but shook his head, "Er no I don't have any plans. What were you thinking of doing?"
"That was the best thing ever!" Harry grinned breathlessly as they collapsed into their bedroom, Seeker bounding inside and rolling all over the floor. Draco chuckled, his cheeks glowing as he locked the bedroom door and turned the key in the lock as always. They had just returned from taking the Blackpool Tower Dungeon tour -it was like London Dungeons only scarier! They had even had a surprise ride at the end and the pictures from the 'hanging experience' were hilarious! The previous day they had had a photo of them and Seeker photoshopped onto a sharks back framed, and also the new one from the Tower Dungeons that they had gotten that morning. They had returned to the hotel after a quick lunch.
"Well one could try reading him medical journals about certain parts of the body; recent medical discoveries in the wizarding community that have cured other parts of the body and new theories of medicines about to be conducted and things like that. Having knowledge is one of the keys for people to believe that they are capable of fighting whatever ails them."
him to come home." He jerked his head away and glared down into the fire as it crackled and hissed by his feet.
"Of course. You're so restrained most of the time. I love being able to get wound up and then this relaxed."
As he settled down at the Slytherin table he caught sight of Harry nodding his head, his lips pressed tightly together to try and suppress his smile.
"If I could, I would. There honestly is no real way though." Harry ducked his head, "I just don't want to get stuck in a dead end ministry job and be bored beyond recognition and then have an early mid-life crisis."
Outside of his studying and preparation which had taken most of his spare time, Severus had insisted that Harry stay away from Malfoy Manor until after his exams. Normally, Harry would have protested but after that long night he had spent in Draco's bed with Draco's hands on his hips and his mouth on his lips, he felt that perhaps staying away from Paris wouldn't be too much of a challenge. The festivities of his passing had gone on until late in the evening, a lot of people including his own father came along to congratulate him. By the time he staggered up the stairs, high on appraisal and some light wine, he was exhausted and really looking forward to sleeping at long last. It truly had been a long week between the exam and learning that he had passed.
"Of course Harry. I plan on spending as many years with you as possible. Till death do us part, remember?" he grinned down as he landed on top of the brunette, the mattress springs groaning underneath their combined weight.
Harry shook his head, ignoring the disappointment he felt. "No, that's fine. Just don't be too long otherwise all the carriages will go." Draco nodded and smiled before he went to disappear down the stairs that led to the dungeons. Harry felt his shoulders slump but told himself not to be stupid. He'd be back in a matter or minutes, so why was he worrying?
"We should go back down there for another weekend," Harry murmured to himself, as he adjusted himself on the pillows, the winces of pain making Draco's heart ache.
"Since when do you care about my skin, Potter?" he barked out, his voice hoarse from the screaming. Without waiting for a response Potter crossed the distance between them and tugged Draco's shirt out of his hands and threw it with a wet slap into the nearest sink. He then quickly tugged his own jumper over his head, unfastened the top two buttons of his soft, white shirt and pulled it over his head and held it out to Draco.
Severus sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Harry, you cannot leave it too much longer to make a decision. Your health and your life are hanging in the balance here."
"What if I don't want to live like that?" Harry countered, "The whole point of this battle was that so no one would have to live like that again if it could be avoided."
"You really are daft," Draco murmured after a few moments of silence.
He let out a soft sigh and turned to face the brunette as he whispered, "I swear Draco, you must be magical because I've fallen under your spell."
"So what's with the candles?" Draco asked as he lazily slid his belt out of his trousers.
The Piers had taken all afternoon, so that by the time they were returning to the hotel to change clothes, the sun was already setting.
Socks...
Aside from the day he left when he'd been in Diagon Alley, he hadn't ventured into public at all.  And his presence that day was watery in the memories of those who had seen him.  Muddled together with a dozen other things that they'd seen and heard that day, he could have easily been just some other blonde boy.
He also never thought he would have spent the past two weeks before the baking show started learning how to chop cherries.
Harry sighed, sliding both of his hands to rest flat between them on Draco's chest, leaning back against the wall as he looked up into the other boy's silver eyes.  "So... This is it, then?"
Just... accepted it.  Said he had nothing to apologize for but if he wanted it, he accepted his apology.
"Yeah.  But..  Thanks for inviting me out.  And listening."
I won't send it to you, and it's silly for me to say I won't send it to you when I'm the only one who's reading it anyways. I don't know why I said that. Or all of this.
“Quite powerful.  But you also have to have very strong and clear focus and purpose and you have to be able to sustain the energy that you're directing to fix the cabinet for quite a long time.  It's not easy to do, if your mind wanders for even a fraction of a second the spell won't work.”
“Good riddance, Malfoy.”  Harry said but couldn't help a genuine smile as he said it.
"Then...  Can I see that one?"
It always seemed to be that way with information and magic.  Either it was impossible to find and then fairly straight forward to do, or it was easy to find because it was nearly impossible to do.
"Was yours Voldemort?"  Draco asked Harry, moving towards the desk so he could open the drawers, checking for anything inside just for something to do.
"I don't really care." Harry said, shaking his head.
Harry started to ball one fist up as Ron asked him something so stupid, but he was spared having to temper his rage when Hermione thunked Ron on the top of his head with a textbook.
But now...  Standing here in this smelly, cramped and utterly ugly flat, he wondered if he had made a mistake.
Harry sighed, giving Draco a pained look at his response.  "I was afraid you'd say that.."
"Whatever can I help you with?"  He asked in an overly dramatic display of hospitality which included a bow and a gracious wave of his hand towards the entirety of the shop behind him.
“So turning on the stove.”  These words roused Draco from his thoughts, thankfully because this was what he needed to learn.  “The knobs there on the back control each of these, the burners.  You put your pan on the burner, then turn on the knob for it so it will heat up.  The more you turn the knob, the less heat gos to your pan or pot.  Don't just leave it up high and assume that means whatever you're cooking will cook faster, though.  Things tend to burn before they finish cooking like that..”
“I'm trying to think of what I can teach you.  Neville said that you took to the cooking lesson decently well so I probably cant expand on it.  He's a better cook than I am so I might undo whatever good he's taught you.  You have a phone you seem decently capable of using...”
“I haven't a clue what you just said, but whatever.”  Draco waved a hand at him, smiling but sighing out a low breath.  “Are you leaving now?”
"We do everything we can to find out just what it is Snape is going to do to take care of this.  But also try and come up with a back up plan."
I won't send it to you, and it's silly for me to say I won't send it to you when I'm the only one who's reading it anyways. I don't know why I said that. Or all of this.
"Hot."  Harry said quietly, reaching up and trailing the pads of two fingers along the sharp line of Draco's jaw.  "I thought the way you talked to him was deadly hot..."
Draco frowned, processing all this new information about both Harry and Dumbledore.  He'd spent most of his time sure Harry was always being kept in the loop.  Anything from concrete fact to rumours 'just in case' so he could always be alert and be prepared.  To know he wasn't....
'Should just let the lot of you take your chances.  Deserve death if it comes for you.' Was the worst.
"Why didn't you tell me?"  Draco eventually asked very quietly, his eyes on the fire in the grate rather than on his mother.
It turned out, luckily, it didn't.  He had the name of what he was making and he had the ingredients in front of him.  Somehow, no matter HOW simplified and pointless Harry had devised a pretend technical exercise, the ingredients all knew exactly what they were supposed to do.
Or would it have been nothing?  Teenage 'passion' tended to be as easily overblown as candles on a birthday cake.
"Oh shut up, Potter."
“Oh good, you're awake!”
Muggles wouldn't show him pictures of their dead friends and family and blame him for it...
"Terrified of him."  Draco said, shaking his head.  "Oh he provided well, he paved the way for anything I wanted.  But it all came at a price."
Draco shook his head slowly, smirking at the other boy.  Moving closer to him even as Harry tried to shove him again.  "Why'd you want to replicate it?"
"It's mad that you had no idea who you were before that.  I've always thought it was mad.  I can't imagine it.  Everyone in the Wizarding World knew you'd be getting to Hogwarts and everything even if no one was really sure where you were being raised.  Just 'with family'.  Then when the time comes and you're here and everything, everyone found out that you didn't have a fucking CLUE who you were and what you meant to the world."
“I beg your pardon.” He said icily to Harry, his eyes narrowing and his arms folding across his chest.  “But I did not
someone.  Nothing Draco had ever done deserved that.  And the longer Harry spent with him, the more he understood that the sneering pride Draco displayed was more like armour over a much more vulnerable and soft inner self.
“Tough lot, mate..”  Ron said, stretching his arms about his head.  “I don't know how you put up with the guy.”
"No I really am.  I mean..
September 1st, 19 Years After
“I have noticed that, yes.  And I am very grateful to you for that, Potter.”  Draco smiled as he spoke.  It was a small smile but it was quite genuine because he was, indeed, very grateful.
“Aurors will be stationed through the neighbourhood and the building at all times of day and night.”  Harry began, moving to the window to look outside, then paced back to the middle of the room.  “You are not to speak to any of them unless you think you are in trouble.  Like you think someone is following you, you think someone is watching you, or you're wounded in some way.”
Harry said the one word then slid out of the window sill, turning a bit with a smug smile on his face.  He rested both hands on Draco's knees, leaning in close to him to speak a little more quietly.  "I plan to go easy on you.."
“But why were you asking about that?”  Harry scooted his chair closer to the table, leaning across it to try and open the book Hermione had closed over her arm.
“This was all I needed.”  Draco said, flapping the note at Harry as he walked into the living room to locate the 'flat black rectangle that sort of looked like a picture frame with nothing in it'.  He patted the television in triumph, having seen it when he first arrived but had no idea what it was.
For now.
He'd wanted to make it without supports, thinking that would be top notch and impressive, but Harry told him there was no way a muggle cake that size could hold itself up naturally.  So he did what everyone else did and just.. fortified it a bit with magic.
“If you don't open the door, I'll break it down!”
An Owl...
Harry's brow furrowed as he looked at Draco curiously.  “Why would you—”
There was just a brief silence. Just long enough for Draco to realize it and look up again when Harry absolutely exploded.
He was quite sure he deserved it.  Quite sure that he SHOULD be followed by that voice, reminded of the bad things he had done.  But that never made it easy.
"Nothing is where the book says it's supposed to be!' Draco yelled, pointing first at the book and then out the window.
“I would have told whoever it was to get stuffed.”
Harry sent notes, funny ones.  In class or Owls after class when he was stuck in Gryffindor and Draco was in Slytherin.  They joked and ranted and had spent one evening sending increasingly lewd and foul drawings back and forth by Owl.
Harry looked at Tom's hands on his thighs, then back up to his face, his brow creasing slightly in confusion.  Confusion both at WHY the other boy was doing this and confusion about the pull in him towards whatever he was doing.
"Thank you."  He said, smiling warmly and genuinely at Draco.  "I know this is a very big gesture..."
Maybe this time when he woke he
Snape grit his teeth, his lips working slightly as though he was holding back biting remarks.  When he did speak, it was a carefully neutral measure.  "You're helping Draco Malfoy."
“Don't insinuate things like that about the Dark Lord.”  Draco said, pretending prim and properness, even lifting his chin and sticking his nose in the air.
She had never turned up unannounced at Malfoy Manor before.  It wasn't
"No one else you know has ties to the Muggle world?"
"I like to be original."  Draco corrected Paul, his chin lifting a bit.
Harry-  Alright.  Do you know what internet is?
“At the time, Gran and I figured the wand I bought was one of the last ones Ollivander sold before he was abducted.  I was so glad that I got there when I did...”
Draco couldn't help but smile.  Adult Neville continued to surprise him.  “Ask him then...  If you manage to talk his bull head around to this then I'll do it.”
He looked down again, fiddling with the chips left in his box, then looking out across the park.  "Most of it, was that I really wasn't the Draco Malfoy that she had known in school.  Or that Daphne had told her about.  We really didn't date, the marriage was sort of arranged in a lot of ways.  Families do that... The nasty pureblood ones, anyways.  She told me much later that the times we did spend together she figured I was just being very polite.  She expected when we got married I'd be the same person she assumed I was."
Harry spoke the words angrily to Draco who scowled at him as they walked across the grounds towards the forest.  It absolutely was NOT his fault.  He hadn't asked Harry to fire a jinx at him from across the room.  He didn't suggest the other boy aim wildly and instead of hitting him, hit the pile of Malevolent Bloom on Professor Slughorn's desk.  If HE had been the one jinxing Harry, he wouldn't have missed.  Wouldn't have hit the flowers that Slughorn himself had gathered just for class.  He would have hit HIM and then they wouldn't be out in the night to gather more of the blasted plant as detention.
“Apps... ”  Harry echoed the one word as he seemed to rather helplessly watch Draco as he moved around.
Draco couldn't breathe for a minute, and when he did it can in an embarrassingly obvious rush.  There was nothing leading in what Harry said, not really.  And yet....
Again something that was supposed to be a one shot and it's becoming more. ;)
"Oh totally charmed.  Hunted and wanted dead by everyone in your family, all the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself."  Harry smirked, then nudged Draco with his elbow.  "But yeah, I do know."
Harry laughed, leaning forward a bit as he watched Draco eat another one.  "I know.  It's the places that look the absolute WORST that have the best chips.  A place that looked like Honeydukes for chips like you were thinking would probably be all pretty and fun to see but wouldn't have anything that tasted this good."
“Stop picking and choosing memories to pry into!”  He said crossly, removing his hands from his eyes so he could glare up at the blonde boy.  Who was looking maddeningly smug standing in front of him.
“I never thought of that..”  Harry said, his heart soaring a bit.  He and Draco wouldn't have to completely stop seeing each other.  In fact, it would be better if Ron and Hermione saw them together a lot...
"Shut up, Potter."  Draco smiled as he said it though, nudging the other boy with his elbow.
He leaned over and opened the desk drawer that was full of the letters he'd written to Harry but never sent.  He raised his eyes to the other man's, tipping his head towards the drawer.  "These letters.  The one that got to you accidentally wasn't the first.  I've been writing you letters since just after the war."
Harry hesitated and Draco could read in his expression a desire to try and stop him from doing something so convenient instead of actually going out to do things, but he seemed to soften after a moment and nodded.  “You could learn more about Muggle food and stuff that way, I suppose.”
Really little things.  Like how he capitalized everything in what he said about Ron's parents, except the word 'muggle'.  Even if Harry had been purposely trying to spy on him and get close to him by acting differently, there is no way he would have caught that small detail, no way it would have occurred to him to not capitalize that word with such intended and insulting purpose.
“Only supposed to be standing guard outside.”  The Auror had spit out, half under his breath, when Draco attempted to make conversation with him.  “Shouldn't have to actually come in here and do anything.  Ridiculous.”
They moved together, rocking and grinding in harmony, somehow easily finding the best way to work, stealing kisses that got harder as time passed, the air of subtlety draining in the face of heat and need that overcame them both.  They arched and pulled and writhed and were as quiet as they possibly could be, though both wanted to be far louder.  The intensity, the desire, the heat that melted the frozen leaves right off their skin was enough to surge in a wave around them, seeming to create a barrier of their own much like the ones around Harry's camp.
With a sigh Draco got to his feet, brushing off his pyjama pants before he started making his way back down to the dungeons.
-------------------------------------------------------------
“This is a nice neighbourhood, really.”  Neville said, his hands in his pockets as they walked together.
Draco held his hand up when Harry tried to interrupt him, taking a step closer to the other man.  “I ask for money from my OWN account and I have to explain to you why I want it.  I ask about internet and you tell me we'll TALK about it.  I ask you to help me with apps on my phone and YOU decide that yes, it's okay for me to have these apps because I'll fucking LEARN something from them.”
A lot of rather steamy memories...
“I'm sorry to bother you.”  He said to the house, stopping short of the grand stairs that lead to the door.  “I'm not here to throw things at you, or gape at you or do anything nasty to you.  But I'm your legal owner now.”
His lungs constricted in on him like his ribs were curling around them and squeezing.
“It's not though.”  Harry said, nodding as he curled his fingers around Draco's.  “Everything has changed but the way it's changed... It hasn't made it easier.”
He smiled when Draco laughed, sliding his hand under the table where no one would see, giving Draco's thigh a warm squeeze before he got up and walked back across the Great Hall.
This was....
Draco exhaled, leaning back against the seat as he looked at Harry incredulously. "I'm guessing you passed the test."
He would have liked to smack that look off of him, but he needed to maintain a decent relationship with the one who had the electronics.
“Oh she did.  She just somehow thought maybe using my dad's wand would make me more like him.  It was silly...  She even admitted it was silly when we were getting me my own.  A lot changed after that fight at the Ministry... Between her and I.  Between myself and my friends, and myself and school...”
For every thought and memory of Theodore that came fully into his head, a hundred other fragments seemed to follow it.  Just tiny snippets of time that rose and fell in his mind's eye.  The way Theodore looked at him when he found out that he was attracted to guys.  The small smiles they shared.  The smirks.  The dark eyed looks.  The momentary whispers as one or the other passed each other in the hall or while sitting in class.
"But I want you to come here.  Astoria and Scorpius too if you want, or they can stay at their house.  I don't want you in Malfoy Manor when he's there."
“Something wrong?”  Harry ventured, leaning one arm against the counter and propping his head in his hand.  “You feeling okay?”
“Probably doesn't even touch them.”  Draco said with a shrug.  “Sorry, Longbottom...”
"You're bigger than I thought."
“Because of what it meant to you.  I know where you stand.  I know that even if your parents never really change what they believe, they’re being watched by you.”
"Lesser of all evils, I think."  Draco smirked, shifting a bit on the ledge, his thigh and Harry's pressed together.  "Have you finished that essay Snape wants for next class?"
“Where do you keep disappearing to!?”
He ran a hand through his hair and moved back to the kitchen, starting to go through his groups of things to pick out what belonged in the fridge to put away again.  But as he put them into the fridge he tried to keep them separated so he would still easily see which ones he didn't understand.  Once he knew more about the internet he figured he could look them up.  That seemed to be what 'google' meant.  You 'googled' things to learn more about them.
Surprisingly, Harry laughed at that, and once again Draco couldn't help but smile with him.  "Well it's true."
"So?"  Draco relaxed his hands in Harry's hair, letting them drop down but he kept his arms comfortably around the other boy's shoulders.
He had been out for over two hours.  Out in the world and with someone.  Someone that knew him.
Draco startled then, a faint flush coming to his incredibly pale cheeks.  "How do you...."
"Snape had nothing to do with it."
“They wanted to take it.  The Ministry, I mean.  For historical reasons.  But Kingsley backed me up when I said no.  I just held onto it.”
He wished they weren't.  He wished that it HAD just been just stress and a highly emotional time.  That would make this SO much easier.
A few minutes later, a small House Elf entered his study to clean.  While Dobby had belonged to Malfoy Manor and had been freed, Astoria had a House Elf of her own, and when they married that Elf came with her.
Harry stayed quiet for a few moments, listening to the clink of his friend's silverware against the plates as he thought.  Then, as casually as he could, he raised his head to look at Hermione.   "Maybe I'll buy it."
"I can't let you go.  Look, I'm in a bad spot here."  Harry sat down on the floor in front of Draco and turned a sheet of parchment so it was  in line with Draco's eyes.  "You say your mother can't stay there with Lucius alone.  But
"When you say 'we'.  When you say we'll find a way out of this.  You actually mean you're going to help me"
Harry tilted his head,  gesturing with his chin towards the Vanishing Cabinet half buried in the pile of stuff.  “You had a good idea in using that.  And honestly, I think that what we need more than anything else right now is a way to get out of Hogwarts to talk.”
"Merlin."  Harry said the one word with surprise and Draco felt him lean back against the bench heavily.  "You do a good job of that show.  I know I rarely see you, but you looked a happy together family at the train..."
"I know."  Harry said, nodding and smiling as he watched Draco take all this in. "But then right after that I get another message saying that I'm to attend a hearing to
"Motherly?"
Draco swallowed too fast, coughed on the chip he was trying to eat.  It took him a few moments and a couple wipes of his eyes before he could speak again, and he answered honestly.
“The Room of Requirement.”
It was a little worse for wear, having been handled so many times and so long ago, but Harry's name was still on it, it was still sealed and it still had... everything he'd always wanted to say to him within it.
Draco somehow doubted that.
What's an Unbreakable Vow?"  Harry asked curiously, half of him thinking Snape was out for glory with Voldemort, wanting to prove himself capable of anything for his Dark Lord.  And half of him thinking that he really did want to help Draco and that somehow his intentions were honourable.
So he returned to Gringotts to get the deed.  It took some persuading and some patience (he HAD, after all, broken into the vaults and released a dragon from it's depths...) but he was eventually allowed to his vault to retrieve the deed, and then he went back.
“Alright, so what first...”  Draco said with a sigh, running a hand through his hair as he looked wearily at the food on the counter.  “Bread, eggs, bacon and... chicken?”  He looked at Neville questioningly at the last one.
“If I have to actually walk up to an Auror while wounded and SAY that I'm wounded then I think you need better Aurors.”  Draco snapped the words at Harry, then smiled in nasty triumph when the Beaming Young Auror actually laughed at what he said.
Harry, who had sent him letters repeatedly over the past couple of weeks.  Worried about him and trying to seek him out.  Worried enough that he was ready to come to Malfoy Manor, a place he was sure the other man did NOT ever want to come back to, just to make sure he was okay.
“Was his influence that strong?” Draco’s tone wavered slightly, almost with a tinge of hope to it that made Harry furrow his brow.
“Potter.” He said, the first time Harry had heard his name in that tone in more years he was able to count. In a voice that used to be so sharp, but now had a smoothness and depth to it.
“Mm..”  Draco nodded his head, turning his eyes down as he thanked him, taking the box and leaving again quickly.
Oh.  Damn.
"Mm..."  Draco pressed his lips together, raising his eyebrows a bit as he tilted his head a bit further, an impish looking coming into his eyes.  "This is probably absolute sacrilege to ask but...  Was he attractive?"
"Just because something is 'nuts' doesn't mean it can't happen.  Did you mean it when you said we couldn't keep doing it?"
One group was for things he absolutely had no idea what they were.  Another was for things he could figure out but was not familiar with, and the last was for things he had seen on television. Once he had everything separated into piles, he sat down on one of the counter stools and started picking things up from the group of things he had no clue about.
"He really doesn't like you."  Draco said, offering the other boy a sympathetic smile.
"Kreacher..." Harry said, trailing off with a grunt as he hefted the portrait a little higher.  "I don't want to put your Mistress where you can't see her, but I don't want her interfering with the rest of the house.  Where can we put her down here for you?"
In spite of himself, Draco smirked a little bit.  "I don't have to mean it to say it.  And know that it is something that should be stopped."
“What on earth...”  He said, trying to affect a cool and calm tone, hoping that his voice only shook to his own ears.
"Harry!  Your ring!"
"Was that for me?"  Harry asked, gesturing to the parchment as he stepped further into the room.  "You were actually going to write back to me?  Why haven't you before... I was worried about you..."
“So.. What should we do about Slughorn's memory?”
"If you ever need anything."  Harry said, swallowing thickly and trying to keep a neutral and stoic expression on his face as he gently untangled his hands from Draco's.
"I'm fine.  This is just..  Very different."  Draco smiled at Harry, getting a little jolt every time he looked at him.  It was arresting to see him there.  Talking to him, interacting with him.  After so many years of animosity and then so many years of just not seeing each other or interacting at all.
"Hey."  Harry said, smiling back at him.  "You okay?"
“I thought I lost it.  How do you have it? How did you know it was mine?”“I took it from you.”  Draco said simply, his eyes turning a bit, drifting to things that only he could see, not saying anything more.
"Draco..."  Harry's voice was quieter and there was a soft thump against the door and then a slide and Draco knew Harry had just pressed his back against the door and slid down to sit on the stone front step.  "Please talk to me.  Please just tell me you're okay..."
This was shit, really.  This was nothing he had wanted.  This was worse than he could have imagined, and he really deeply and desperately wanted to just walk out the door and apparate as far away as he could.  Harry had given him his wand free and clear, he'd do fine...
It should have been a wonderful day, as it had been the one scheduled for his internet installation, and it had started off really well.  Started off very promising.  But then the Auror that was assigned to be present while the muggle person was there knocked on the door.  And it was the one that wouldn't meet his eyes when he had handed over his Gringott's withdrawal form.
Harry's arms curled around him, pulling him in and Draco circled his around Harry's shoulders, Pressing into him heavily as he kissed him, licking deep into his mouth, pulling at him to try and get closer.
Harry stopped speaking and stopped his broad strides forward once he got a look around the flat.
“Harry mentioned you had a panic attack when he was here.”  Neville said carefully, his eyes so heavy on him Draco could feel them like a physical touch.  “But I didn't think it was quite so..”
Never mind.  Never mind all of that.
He couldn't keep the bitter and dark note out of his voice and Harry's fingers flexed against his back.  He focused fully on the warmth of that hand on him, seeping through his clothes and into his skin.  Like an anchor keeping him there.
Not someone that Harry had been friends with, or would ever be friends with.  But he remembered shortly after the war while others had been interviewed about Dumbledore's Army, Zacharias had said he would have 'definitely turned up to fight' only he'd lost his coin and so didn't get the message that they were all meeting up.  He went on to claim it had probably been stolen by a Death Eater and Harry had rolled his eyes so hard it hurt.
He would be allowed inside.
"That's true..." Draco nodded, then got to his feet.  "Let's take another look through the house and see if there's anything else that needs my help."
“He's the same age as we are.”  Harry said, still grinning as he looked at Draco in a manner that made him VERY uncomfortable.
Somehow him saying that kindled something in Ron and Hermione.  They were suddenly wanting to discuss everything more, suddenly they wondered if they were wrong.  But Harry no longer thought the same.  He shut down every conversation on the matter, staunchly deciding that anything Draco was up to, if he was up to something, wasn't their business.
