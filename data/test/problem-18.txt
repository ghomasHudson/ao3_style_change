“Lucius let me think on this, please. I have never really had a family myself and raising a boy will be something new to me. Not only that, I would have to change the way I live, to accommodate a child.” Severus said, since he knew that his friend would not drop the subject until he said that he would think about. Lucius left it at that, knowing that if he pushed his friend too far that Severus would push back, and he wouldn’t get his way. So instead he just smirked at Severus, knowing that the seed he planted in his mind will grow into something that he could work with.
Severus looked on with disbelief. The Dark Lord killed the Potters, there is nothing to add to such a thing when everyone knows that is the truth.
The last thing Harry remember was the giant club swinging his and Hermione's way, before he flung himself at her. He had no idea if he made in time to push her out of the way, but he does remember the pain in his leg, then a crashing sound of the stalls giving away and covering them before passing out. He awoke with a start, ready to start the fight once again, but found himself in the white, sterile room of the infirmary. If that wasn't the strange part of being teleported, it was that his DADA Professor was standing over him, his hands out stretched looking like he was ready to strangle the young boy. The boy was already under enough stress from both the accident with the troll and now being in a new place that his mind snapped back to a time before he was rescued; his uncle standing over him, just like the professor, his purple face enraged and his hands tightening grip around the thin neck of his.
Draco looked at Harry’s face to see a slight blush on his cheeks from all the laughing and a soft smile just lingering, this was what they needed, and Draco was Happy he decided to take some time off work to spend time with his omega, they needed this. Draco bent down without warning and capture Harry’s lips he felt Harry stiffen at the suddenness of the kiss but soon relaxed into it. Draco just smirked and licked Harry’s lips which parted quickly for the Alpha’s tongue to enter it was a short battle before Harry just went boneless in Draco’s arm and muffled moan left the man. Draco let out a growl his hands drifted to Harry’s arse and quickly lifted him. Harry’s legs wrapped around Draco’s waist and moaned feeling his mate’s arousal. Draco’s attack on Harry’s mouth quickly ended and Harry could not stop the whine that came forward but was quickly changed the mewl as those talented lips found the mate mark. Harry titled his head to the side to allow Draco better access to the mark and felt his mate nip and sucking trying to renew the claim on the Omega.
“So far, we have had Hagrid with fluffy, Professor Sprout with the Devil Snare, Professor Flitwick must have set up the keys since he is a Head of House, that must have been Professor McGonagall’s chess set back there. Then you would have Quirrell with the troll. So, there’s left is our own Head of House. At least that is what I am thinking.” Harry said, listing it off in his head thinking about what they have faced.
“Harry can you look at me?” Draco asked the younger boy, very scared for him. It took a few moments before Harry’s green eyes met his grey eyes. “We need to go to Professor Snape’s chambers where he will give you a potion for tonight. Will that be okay?” Harry thought for a moment and nodded.
The Dark Lord said with a sigh, knowing that he could not be harsh on the boy if he still wanted his help.
Harry’s check were inflamed red in embarrassment; if only Levi was here, then maybe he would have a great witty come back. Sadly, Severus made Harry leave him back at his manor for the day, unsure of how people would react to such a large snake draped over such a tiny boy.
“T-The…” I couldn’t finish my sentence as another contraction hit, I took a hold of his hand as the pain now hit home.
The conversation was at a close when the door suddenly was thrown open and stepped in a girl with curly hair her robes on, and a boy behind her that was clearly upset about something.
Harry was frightened this was not the same professor that he knew; even the Dark Lord was not the same. There was something wrong here and Harry did not like it one bit. When he got the stone from the nasty mirror, which shattered once the stone was out, he hid it from the imposters, shying away from the man’s inquiry and slowly inching his way back up the stairs. He did not make it far before the man lunged at him. Harry held his arms above his head, his only reaction after all the years with the Dursleys. He heard a sizzling sound come from the skin contact and his wrist blistered from the heat, while Quirrell’s hand started to crumble. Without thinking Harry returned the man’s lunge, placing his hands upon the man’s face, even though his hands grew full of painful blisters, Harry just held the screaming man there and watched as he fell into a pile of ashes.
The boy gave the big snake a nod of his head scared of what to do; the snake began to leave, but as he did he told Harry a quick message,
Alright I think that is everything I needed to inform you guys on, but if you do have question or concerns about anything post down in the comments and I will try to get to them. If you are shy or would love a deep conversation about stuff send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com and I will try to answer when I possibly can :) on to the teaser!
Severus was out hunting down potion ingredients for Harry, after watching the boy all day he noticed that the boy had a hard time seeing things from his left side. He wanted the boy to have an easier life now that he was away from those muggles, and to do so was to erase all the damage they have done to the poor boy. So Severus thought that he would surprise the young boy with a healing potion, he wasn’t sure how bad the damage was and wouldn’t know till they were back at his manor, so Severus just bought all the ingredients he thought he would need.
“Now Petunia, that isn’t how you treat a guest, just go get the boy and we will be out of your hair until next summer.” The man’s voice snarled at his Aunt, if Harry wasn’t in a world of pain he would have laughed to see his Aunt spoken to that way.
After many discussions with Severus over the snake, as well as Severus asking the Headmaster, it seemed the snake would be allowed to join them at Hogwarts under the rule that he would stay in Severus’s living quarters when Harry was in class.
“Good now I wish you a good day and see you tomorrow at dinner.” Narcissa said with a smile before taking her leave, leaving the boy and man alone to figure things out themselves.
year.” 6…. Harry smiled up at Draco 5… 4… They lean in closer together 2… 1… Lips meet in and a spark of magic clicks into place for them, even after all the years of fighting and arguments, this was right.
Draco groggily opened his eyes at the sudden movement, unhappy at being woken up. This had to be one of the best sleeps he had gotten since the start of the war, but he too quickly acted and tried to jolt away. He fell asleep cuddling Harry bloody Potter! He too had a blush on his pale checks thinking of what happened that lead up to them here.

Anyways much love to all you lovely readers, and I will see you in the next chapter or in the Discord chat!
Enough with those thoughts, I shake my head trying to think on the bright side of things. Maybe if I am still well enough after this trip, Draco and I can go out to eat. Not that the food is bad here at the Manor, it would be a different type of surroundings and maybe even be counted as a… Date? I felt my face redden at the thought of going out on a date! It would be our first date, as… as a couple. Even though we are mates, we haven’t made it public just yet. And with me being… well me, there was bound to be a slip up and we would end up plastered on the front of the Daily Prophet. Maybe this date thing was not for us, I thought with a sigh.
“I-I would love that sir, I really would.” Harry finally managed to say, as he sniffled into the older man’s shirt.
I heard a chuckle from the direction of our bathroom door and saw my mate with a towel wrapped around his waist as he stepped out.
, Harry thought to himself a small smile twitching on his lips, the longer the red head just sat there, the more annoyed Severus got.

“Alright professor, I will,” Was the reply that he got. With a quick goodbye to the two younger wizards, Severus started on a plan to make sure that the crazy old headmaster would not ruin the first year of school for young Harry.
Professor Quirrell started to unwarp his turban very slowly, each passing second seemed to drag on forever. As the layers fell away from his head, the pain in Harry’s scar also intensified tenfold. Harry wasn’t sure if it was from the memories flying through his mind, or if it was contributed to something else entirely. It was ages before the last of the wrap fell away, leaving Quirrell and his hairless head looking at him, before the voice spoke again, “Turn around you fool!” The raspy voice yelled. The man turned around leaving Harry to gasp at the sight. There on the back of his Professor’s head was a grotesque face, the face seemed to be adjusting his eyes to the light. Harry had to bite back a scream, both from the horror before him as well as the pain that blossomed in his head. Tears where now steaming down the boy’s face, he was scared and in pain, he began to feel like he always did after his uncle beat him.
“I-I’m not ready yet sir, i-it’s too soon.” Harry mumbled the last part, back to chewing his raw bottom lip once again. Severus took his thumb and pulled his lip away from his teeth.
It was like any other Christmas for Harry, spent alone. Hermione left to go home to her parents for the break. Since they can’t come to the wizarding world, they left to go to Switzerland to ski. Ron went home to spend time with his parents since the war had left their family broken. It was going to be sad with the grieving of Fred passing, Harry felt like he would be intruding on something. That left him there at Hogwarts alone with about 10 other students from different houses. It was a very sad Christmas, being the first since the end of the war, but also the toughest with families grieving for the first holiday without loved ones, students wanting to stay with their families instead of at Hogwarts.
He stroked the door with his spider like fingers, and the door before them started to melt away, as if it had never existed. Hagrid got out the cart and stepped inside the ancient vault, which was holding only a small, brown, badly wrapped package. With that done they sat back down in the cart.
Draco removed his fingers from Harry’s mouth and went to remove the butt plug from his omega. “such as good boy, all ready for me Draco said as he lifted Harry on to his cock. Harry was to entrap in the mirror moaning eye half lidded as he watch himself sink onto Draco’s cock the alpha big cock disappearing deep into him. His already full womb almost felt like bursting Harry gave a whine. “so full already but I know you want more, don’t you omega.”
Harry said, not looking up from his cup, his mind still trained to the way he begged forgiveness from his Uncle.
“W-Well dear we will just get you two more from the zoo! How does that sound sweetie?” The boy’s mother said out of fear of her own son.
Harry thought to himself with a smile. He walked into the kitchen with the brown parcel in hand. There sat Severus, sipping on some tea as he looked over a pile of papers on the table.
“W-What was his name? The man who killed my parents?” Harry asked, looking dead set at Severus. “You do not have to tell me if you don’t want to. I just want a name to put with a person, so I can know.”
Hello lovelies and welcome to chapter 21! :D yay~ I really do not have much to say this week, and at the moment not a wake enough to think of anything. So lets thank my beta for the wonderful job of reading over my stupid mistakes, and get on with the chapter!
I glanced at my Dom, knowing he was uneasy with the thought of me hurting myself, but we needed to get this done. Without being prompted, I got both the dagger and goblet and took a seat on Draco’s lap knowing this is easier in dealing with the protectiveness he would have once I made the cut.
A hissy voice echoed around the room, as laughter rose up after it as the Potion Maker stoic face paled visibly
Lucius looked at his friend in concern, in all the time he had known Severus this has never happened, the man that sat before him looked lost and unsure if what he was doing was the right thing. Lucius couldn’t make any sort of promises but, knowing Narcissa, she would do anything for him as well.
I felt my lower lip tremble, my body upset that I didn’t please him. “I was just trying to figure out the potions that were given to me before I take them.” I answered, glancing up once in a while but never fully looking at him. “Want to know what I am taking in case you try to poison me.”
“Yes Aunt Petunia,” Harry said back, getting his glasses and sticking them on his nose, he heard the tail-tell sign of the lock being undone on his small cupboard door.
“I will check, give me a few moments, Lord Potter. If you would please have a seat, I will be back in a moment.” I nodded and Draco and I proceeded to the sitting area.
“Of course, I understand. I am just happy that you are willing to help them out, and I thank you for that,” I replied and bowed to show my thanks. I do not want to lose the trust of the goblin nation at this time. I felt Draco’s hand slip into mine and give a squeeze before I glanced back at the twins and Theo.
Hello Lovelies 3 :) sorry for the wait, was going to post last week, but then my beta and I had some technical difficulties when it came to emailing. But fear not we got it working (as you can tell xD) I do hope that you like this chapter :3
Did Harry regret what he did to his friends, yes very much, he knew that they were going to be very angry with him in until he found a way to make it up to them; but this is what he had to do. He entered another large chamber like the ones before it, and there in the center stood Quirrell and that stupid mirror.
To Harry this was a dream come true, he was going to get out of this house for a day, he would get to see the outside world beyond his cupboard. He tried to keep his grin hidden from the Dursley at the thought of at least one day of freedom. He just hoped that he did nothing wrong.
“I’m sorry Draco, but you guys weren’t going to get up without that,” Harry said, still laughing from this morning. Draco and the others, besides Theo, were still mad at Harry for what he had done and were giving him the cold shoulder. Of course, Harry knew what he might be facing when he did what he did, but did it anyways, so of course it didn’t hurt him that much. The twins were more than proud when their kitten told them of what he did this morning, and prouder because they never thought of doing that. Harry gave them permission to use his prank, then took his seat at the Slytherin table and even put a little bit of food upon his plate. Even though he had been living with Severus for the summer, it was still drilled into his head that he couldn’t eat unless explicitly told he could, but he was slowly getting better. Severus tried many times to get him to eat more, but the boy always shut down so he began hiding nutrition potions in his drink.
Harry felt rather embarrassed of what just happened before taking to hiding behind Severus, to escape the attention of the wondering eyes. All the eyes were in shock at the sight of a giant snake that seemed to have itself coiled around the young boy.
Severus had enough of the talking that was going between the man and boy and came to the boy’s rescue once again, picking him off the floor and placing both himself and the young wizard into a chair. He shot Lucius a look telling him to keep his mouth shut.
They moved off the white and black board, towards the passageway just beyond, following that down to yet another door. The three opened it to find seven different bottled potions before them and a piece of parchment between. Harry moved forward, in doing so black and purple flames sprung up around them closing them in. The students looked around the room, eyes widening in fear. Harry moved forward and picked up the parchment and began to read:
Please leave kudos and comments below <3 I live off of them; and they always put a smile on my face. If you are shy please send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com :) I don't bite I swear! <3 Well see you lovelies next week! (hopefully!)
Harry’s eyes shot up to the Dark Lord’s face, trying his hardest to keep his food down when his gaze was transfixed on the horror.
Harry took the wand, not sensing anything, “Well, give it a wave!” Ollivander exclaimed, so Harry did. The wave caused a shattering of a vase, Harry quickly set the wand on the counter, backing away quickly as if it had burned him. “Nope not that one!” Ollivander went back on his hunt for a wand.
“Lord Potter, may your vaults be filled and those that wrong you fall,” Griphook replied, “how may we help you today, Young Lord?”
Before Harry could say anything, his trunk was lifted onto the train, and two reds heads were pulling him onboard.
"Oh, where the child could had gone," Poppy mumbled. looking around her spick and span infirmary to see if she could spot the misplaced child. It was a small whimper that Severus heard that alerted him to the child. He ducked his head underneath the bed to see the small child curled up in a small ball, tears glistening down his face as he tried to fight back the whimpers that desperately wanted to escape his throat.
“No, we must thank you for bringing in Mr. Potter here, we have been trying to get ahold of him to take on his heirship and even his lordship since he came of age after the Triwizard tournament.”
Harry looked at his father knowing that he wished that this would not have to happen, “Yes, I think this would be the best chance we have until we can find a way to escape this war all together, unnoticed.”
Gemma quickly stood up taking her wand out, “I, Gemma Lee Farley, swear on my magic that I will do everything in my power to help Harry Potter on the quest that the Dark Lord has set in front of him. I also swear that I will not give out any information regarding what was spoken or will be spoken of without permission from the Dark Lord himself or Harry. So mote it be.”
Those dark thoughts surrounded Harry and it felt like he was suffocating under the weight of the world; the memories of the only family and all those names just circled around in his thoughts. Then he felt a sharp pain in his hand and saw tiny sharp teeth drawling blood with the crystal blue eyes looking at him with both fear and anger.
It was two weeks until Hogwarts let out for the year, when the Slytherin trio noticed someone missing from the head table. The headmaster had been called away during the day and was rumored that he would not be back until sometime tomorrow; this was their chance to go for the stone hidden within the castle. The trio cast gazes to each other, then up towards the Dark Lord who gave them an all-knowing smirk. Tonight was the night that they would take the Stone for the Dark Lord and prove their loyalty.
Alec seemed to pick up on Harry’s struggle, “If there is a question that is too tough you can skip it,” Harry was biting his lip once again and nodded.
“What if I did?” Severus asked, watching Harry’s face to see if this was what the boy really wanted. Harry’s green eyes where wide as possible and was a moment before he flung his arms around the other dark haired wizard, tears flowing down his face, “D-Do you mean that?” He asked, his voice husky with emotion.
Harry placed his hand upon the wall that Snape showed him the first time he came down here, and pushed on it lightly. It swung open with ease, revealing a cozy sitting room, with a fire roaring in the fire place and Levi lounging in front of it. Neit, who refused to be left behind, climbed out of Harry’s pocket, and made her way to giant snake and curled up in his coils and fell asleep right on top of him.
It was about 2:30 before the group of wizards arrived in front of Gringotts. Draco and his mother had left group to go do gift shopping for presents for Harry. Harry, Severus, and Lucius where met at once by an angry looking goblin who was standing right at the doors.
As always thanks goes to my beta and all the hard work they put into the chapter! <3 you are the best hun!
“U-Up” He said meekly, somehow managing to make the weak word, to his own surprise. The broom gave a little jolt up, but not fully leaping into his hand. Draco, beside him, gave a loud and clear “Up” and the broom flew into his hand. Harry swallowed hard the lump in his throat.
“Jealous.” They finished together, now each had an arm thrown over the blondes shoulder grinning from ear to ear. Draco’s face was now about as bright as their hair from the embarrassment.
The Goblin who stood before him was speechless to say in the least, being treated with such respect from a wizard. Lucius and Severus were also in a state of shock seeing the younger wizard bowing to the goblin asking forgiveness. Lucius’s mind was racing, he was afraid of what this might do to the business they had here, and what would happen to the Potter’s name for bowing ones head to the goblin race; but was quickly put to rest. He was also wondering where the young wizard got this idea from, did he read it from a book? Harry always seem to have his nose in a book, reading everything he could get his hands on.
Severus just wrapped his own arms around the shaking frame of the child smiling. “Alright Harry, alright. I’ll do everything I can to make sure this comes true.” Severus was grateful that he could help this child, not because it was Lily’s son, but because he has fallen for the green eye boy, and thought of him as his own son. It just took him awhile to realize this; but this was something he would not pass up.
They both began at the same time and then stopped; unsure what either was going to say, not looking directly at each other, just glancing at one another from the corner of their eye.
I hope that you guys enjoyed to the story, I only released on aspect of the question I asked last time, so I will let you guys continue to comment on who you want Nev's mate to be Theo or Blaise. Then what is Theo/Blaise creature? :) I can tell you now one is in the lead, but I do have a clear creature, almost all the creatures where tied.
Hello Lovelies! I am very sorry for taking a while to get this out! I would have gotten to it sooner, but never have time. I do have two piece of news for you guys,
“I would like to Sir,” Harry said quickly thinking up a lie, “But Professor Snape asked me to stop by his office to show that I have done my homework.” He really didn’t want to go with Professor, nor did he think his Dad would like that he would spend any extra time with him either. So with that the boy turned around and was ready to leave, when he felt a hand hold to his shoulder. Harry held back a violent flinch, when that happened, reminding himself that he was not at the Dursley’s, and that this was not his Uncle either.
Of course, he needed his body first, a body that would bring back the power he needed to fulfill his plans. The Stone was all he needed, the Stone would bring him back his body along with immortality, the one thing that has eluded him all these years. Yes, that is how he would get the boy, he knew the silly headmaster had set this whole thing up, even though he knew he had set it up he just could not give up the chance to gain immortality. So he had to come here, but along with that was the boys first year, so of course the old fool had set it up to test the boy, to see if he was a child of the Light. The Dark Lord smiled, a dark chuckle escaping his lips into the turban as his foolish host continued to pace. Yes, yes this was perfect! When the boy came down into the area where the stone was kept he would make a promise to the boy, he would offer the boy the world along aside him. Albus would be able to do nothing, since this was just a silly test for the boy, he would just sit back and watch as his boy wonder fail his test and join the Darkness by the Dark Lord’s side. Everything was perfect; the only thing that was not thought of was if the boy would truly join his side. That is the one thing the Dark Lord cannot think of, that will was up to the boy and what he wanted his life to be like.
“Why do you think Headmaster put those other teachers down here, such as Hagrid and Quirrell, and not any other teacher? Why not just stick with the Head of Houses?” Harry pondered this thought aloud. Both Gemma and Draco froze in step, causing Harry to run into them. That was a good question; of course, the old coot would do something like that.
The Dark Lord sunk in the chair, a wicked smile going across his face, first things first he needed the stone, and he was going to use the child to get it. Yes, this would be the child’s first task in serving him; but he would not make this child his servant, no this child would be close to his equal. His Potions Master was in some regards, an equal, but not quite since he took the mark, but this boy wouldn’t. He would teach the boy everything he knew of the Dark, and build him up from there. This task was simple enough, the fool of a headmaster set it up as task already for the boy, but he would use it as well to see which way the boy ran, would he go to him or the Light. It was all now a waiting game, one that was getting interesting by the second, and he had only time to wait and see the outcome.
Severus spent the week with Harry, teaching him more about potions, even going so far as letting Harry into his private lab and help cut ingredients. Severus even let Harry sleep with him after a nightmare, giving him some hot coco to calm him down, and staying awake with him until he fell asleep again; he had kept the nightmares away after that.
It was Halloween when this moment hit for Harry, that maybe Hermione was right. The day still hurts him and his friends always try to take his mind off the day. The large friend group got together at his and Hermione’s apartment for a movie night. The purebloods enjoyed the advancements that the muggles have done, and the ones that have been slowly integrating more into Muggle society enjoy the movies. They were enjoying Hocus Pocus at the purebloods screwed their noses at what Muggles thought their kind should look like and getting a good laugh. It was then that Harry realized that he and Draco had yet to start a “Fight” no name calling no bickering no nothing. It was a strange thought, the blonde was watching the movie pointing out just how wrong the muggles where, when his silver eyes caught him in the act of staring, instead of saying anything Draco raised an eyebrow at him and all Harry could do was blush…. He blushed! At the action before turning away acting like he was not just caught, in the corner of his eye Harry to this day swear Draco smirked at the action.
Instead, the goblin took a calming breath. “We will have that fixed up right away, Mr. Potter. Those who have been in charge of your accounts will be changed to either myself or to another goblin you can trust. And those who took funds that were either not used for your benefit, or that you had no knowledge of, or it was done by forage documents, will be punished for fraud. We will retrieve the monies and items, if any where removed.  While we continue this talk, a few other goblins will look into what was taken, and who has taken it, and those who have it will be severely punished, with the monies taken from their accounts. All this will be done today, and we will have those papers in your hand by the end of the day free of charge since this was a mistake on the bank’s account.”
“Don’t worry we will have him back in one piece,” George said with a mischievous grin, “Harry do you want to hold him for a bit?” Asking his little kitten, holding the tarantula out to him.
The girl nodded her head, “Of course, but it is nice to meet you. I have read everything I can about you and defeating You-Know-Who. Ohh where are my manners? My name is Hermione Granger.” The girl said smiling at Harry and Draco, “And this is Neville Longbottom, please if you do see a toad that doesn’t seem to have an owner, give it to Neville or myself. Thank you.” Before Harry or Draco could reply, Hermione and Neville turned and left their car.
“Mum, can we go to the owl emporium? I would like to get my own owl.” Draco said, looking up at his mum. Narcissa thought about it for a moment, but decided that Draco was old enough now that he could get his own owl.
who should have been treated as royalty, cowering behind the mean looking professor. He was obviously scared and confused, and the oldest Malfoy had only made it worse.
Well anyways welcome back lovelies! :) This chapter is one of the longest that I have typed so far, so I do hope that you like everything! I would like to thank my beta once again for reading through all my silly mistakes and putting their input in here as well! well enough from me on to the chapter!!
“Nope that should be everything, you may go, just inform us when dinner is ready.” Draco said waving her away before thrusting the robes at Harry. “You go change in the bathroom over there,” Draco said, pointing to the door leading to the bathroom as Milly disappeared with another crack.
Of course Harry was happy to finally get his own set of clothes that weren’t hand-me-down from his cousin Dudley. Narcissa left the boys and started to explore the shop seeing what the new trends were.
Notes: Hello lovelies and welcome to chapter 13! :( so I might not be able to post next week, I might be out of town I am not sure yet~ anyways
I hoped you liked the chapter! :D I live off of comments and kudos lovelies and would love if you left some for me; it makes me all soft and warm to read what you guys think of the story! If you are shy email me! :) demondog136@yahoo.com
Severus produced a golden key from one of his many hidden pockets, handing it to the goblin, trying to snarl when he felt the tight clamp of the greedy goblins hand around the key.
“Now we could make this happen, it’s either going to be you adopting him or us, since Narcissa has become very attached to the boy.” Lucius said with a chuckle. “But I think it should be you, since the boy knows you better than he knows me or Narcissa. He sees you as his savior. I know that I could have the ministry process the papers real quick, and we do not have to worry about young Harry going back to those people.”
“Why not just leave him here? The boy can get his work done while we are at the zoo?” His uncle said now staring at the young green-eye boy.
The story was one that neither Harry nor Severus where ready for, it was something that made no sense. If what the Dark Lord said that was true, then there had been a third party that was involved in this fight that no one knew about.
“Have a nice nap Harry?” Severus asked as the young wizard turned his head, his piercing green eyes burrowing into his own.
“My little elf there is no need to pout,” I felt my whole body start to blush, this time from embarrassment. Even my ears were red hot, “Alright let’s have a quick potion lesson, I guess. This one, I hope you know after all your trips to the hospital wing, is pain reliever,” Draco, Malfoy, said pointing to the red one in my hand, he then pointed to a light blue one, “this is a nutrients potion to help you put on some weight.” The last one was a slight greenish color, “This is a stomach sealer, or more commonly referred to as stomach soother, since you haven’t seen  food for what looks like the better part of the summer, this should help you keep the food down as well. I would take them all now or it wouldn’t be such a nice breakfast afterwards.” Draco smiled at me, I had to admit that I was out of my league when it came to potions, but for Draco he knows what he is talking about. I mean he calls Snape “Uncle Sev” as well as knowing when to throw ingredients into my cauldron to ruin them or even make them explode. I quickly took all three potions each with a shiver, even when I tried to taste it, it seemed to linger upon my tongue; followed up by all of the milk that sat on my tray to chase it down.
Another note: I am thinking of other stories that I can do for you guys, but I would like some help. :) I am looking for a co-author to help me out. It would the first piece I would ever write with another person, but I would really love to give it a chance! So if you want to give me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com :)
“It would also help if he would pronounce the spell right, then maybe he could be a proper wizard,” Harry replied, getting a laugh from the Slytherins around him. Ron shot the group a glare, that’s when Hermione stepped in to help her housemate.
The Dark Lord grinned wickedly at her from his dark corner. “Well done Gemma, and wisely worded as well. Now for you, ahh yes, you look so much like you father Draco.” Draco could not hold back the whimper that tore through his throat when he heard the Dark Lord speak his name; it sent shivers down his spine hearing his name hissed in such a manner.
I just smiled at the insecurity he was having about another touching me, “You have nothing to worry about, if what the books say is true. Even if Nev was another Dom, you would not feel as threatened by his presence as you would others, since he is my brother by blood.”
Harry found such comfort in those words, happy that even though he had lost most of his childhood, he knew he had the chance to build something new, something real.
Hello lovelies and welcome to Chapter 2 I am going to try to update on Friday's or Sunday's each week until I run out of chapters, I am hoping that I can type more but sadly I have so much invested to school that I haven't had time. Any way there is a kinda of new face in this chapter and I do hope you like the surprise :) I don't want to give away to much! Enjoy!
Before they got in the car to go to the zoo his uncle held on to him, “Alright Boy I want no funny business do you hear?” Harry nodded a lump of fear forming in his throat at the repulsion of being so close to the large man. Said man lean close to Harry to whisper his threat into his ear, “if not you will have be severely punished.” Harry only meekly nodded at the many ideas of what the man could mean, but one always circled back, he just hoped that was not the threat the man was talking of.
“Alexander, it is nice to see you again as well, I would let you go straight to see Harry, but I would like a moment of your time before then,” This had Alec on edge; something was going on and it wasn’t good,
“Time my lord, I need time.” Severus said, voice was soft and uncertain. The man’s very being was at question and he needed to look over everything possible. A soft sigh echoed the room, disappointment that his own spy couldn’t believe the man that never wronged him in anyway.
Vernon dragged Harry into the house by his hair yelling at him for the freakiness he showed at the Zoo of how he was to be punished. Harry all the while begging with Uncle to leave him be, that he didn’t mean to do. But made a mistake when he said the word
“I guess, come on lets head into my room,” Draco said opening his door, to reveal a large room, too big for a single person to live in, it even had its own connecting bathroom. Harry couldn’t help but to look at everything the blonde had in his room, he had a king size bed with a large canopy over it with silver drapes hanging off of it, a moving dragon painted on his wall that was currently asleep making smoke rings with his nose.
Harry looked at his professor in shock not many people knew that he was blind in his left eye, he thought that he hid it well enough.
Another note: I am thinking of other stories that I can do for you guys, but I would like some help. :) I am looking for a co-author (really would love to work with anyone I promise I do not bite!) to help me out. It would the first piece I would ever write with another person, but I would really love to give it a chance! So if you want to give me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com :)
“That’s fine I have something that you can barrow for tonight. I will have one of the house elves charm it to fit you since you are smaller than me.” Draco said setting his sights to his closet, looking through all his clothes for something he thought Harry would look good in.
The feeling was a new one, one that just kindling and starting, but since it was there, a wild fire was to follow shortly. All thanks to a mistletoe kiss.
They all carried on in quiet conversation during the meal, the scrape of utensils louder than words most times. Harry had lost count of how many different courses appeared in front of him, each one tasting amazing as the last. It seemed that Levi was having a good time as well, having a conversation with Harry, but also with Narcissa since she held great interest in the snake. All too soon it was time for Harry and Severus to take their leave, but not without a promise to the young blonde about going school shopping the next day.
They entered the owl emporium, and Harry was taken aback by the amount of owls and other species of animals that fit in one place. Draco and his mum walked around looking at the different animals that Draco could possibly want, while Harry stood in the door glancing around nothing catching his attention. That was until he heard a small muffled noise coming from a small cage. Taking a few steps into the store and following the sound Harry took a peek inside to see a small black kitten with bright blue eyes staring into his own green eyes. Harry smiled and cooed at the small cat, watching it slowly makes its way to the front of the cage mewing softly at Harry.
Severus sighed, “No, term ended about a day ago, but we brought you here as soon as we got you out of the chambers, claiming that you where ill. As for the rest, I guess we will start with Levi. After he left you, he went to Tom to tell him that everything was going according to plan, but when he arrived there was a slight problem. It seemed like our Headmaster noticed what was going on, and cornered Tom in his office, of course this led into a standoff between the two, some curses flew and Tom had to make a quick getaway. Since the Headmaster’s plan fell through, he had to conjure up a fake and have it take Tom’s place when you got to the mirror, hoping that you would come back to the light side if you saw the Dark Lord. So, when the fake turned to ash he set off a delay reaction to seem as if the Dark Lord left his body, and when it went through you left lots of magical residue, as well as some charms. Some included some sort of control charm, a leech charm to slowly drain your magic, and some others of that nature. This was in the hope that it would bring you to his side and under his control.” Severus finished, “We are still in the process taking the charms off of you, but it’s proving to be difficult. We were starting to get worried the longer you slept, in fear we missed something else, but it proves it was just you magic replenishing itself after the shock it received when all those spells hit you at once.”
Harry welcome the chance out of the house staying close yet as far as way as he could from the Dursley family, taking in all the sights a normal person gets to see when they were 6. Of course he appreciated it a lot more than the screaming kids and the noises adults, who were upset whenever an animal decided that they would no longer preform for the crowd and lay down.
“Harry, that is not enough for all of us to take to get through,” Draco said, eyeing the smaller potion bottle.
Harry and Draco where almost at the entrance to when Draco pulled on Harry’s sleeve, “Harry what was that about, back in Professor Snape’s quarters?”
Hello lovelies I am very sorry for taking so long! I was going to have it ready on time before I noticed a mistake in writing and had to discard the whole chapter. So it took an extra week to get everything fixed, but here it is the final chapter to part one of the boy and the snake series. I have no idea when part two will be coming out, I do hope to have time this up coming break to sit down and write the first ten chapters, so I do have a buffer when it comes to posting. I will also start up other projects such as those mentioned at the bottom of last chapter and again in this chapter. I want to give a moment to thank every single one of you for giving this a chance for giving this kudos and comments, it has really made writing this so much fun, and I am happy that you guys enjoyed this adventure. I also give lots of thanks and love to my beta for coming in and helping me out a lot with all the mistakes I've made as well as all the wired posting times I have had lately. I love you guys every much <3 and I do hope to see you guys again here in the near future!
12/28: alright I have updated the edited version so lets give a big thanks to my Beta for working to get this done! Thank you hun!
I sighed a tense sigh, not taking my eyes from the fireplace, “Yeah everything is fine, it’s… it’s just that wizard travel and me don’t get along so much,” I said with a blush crossing my face, it was something no one seemed to have much trouble with; yet the boy wonder could not land on his feet.
Severus was waiting now on Harry who had decided that it would be a good idea to pack everything at the last second. Severus sighed, knowing that they are pushing their time right now, and felt a little irritated at the fact that he would be late. Of course, at that moment Harry showed up trunk in hand, his Kitten in her cage sleeping. Harry had brought the little thing home and named it, Neit, it was the name of an Egyptian goddess, Harry explained to him, at least that’s what he had understood from the title, “The Huntress”. Harry thought that would fit his new little kitten just right. Levi, of course, first thought he was kidding about keeping the kitten, but slowly started to feel for the furball much to his irritation. Said snake was following behind Harry, and seemed to be scolding the young boy.
It was then Harry felt heat shift through his body almost suffocating, he felt slick starting to soak through his underwear and his skin became overly sensitive to touch. He knew as soon as Draco let out a string of slur that his eyes had the golden ring an indication that he had entered an unexpected heat. Harry Opened his eyes to whine at his Alpha as felt his Alpha trying to set the Omega down but gasp as he saw that Draco had entered rut, his beautiful silver eyes with a ring of red around them.
I nodded and I know everyone else did since we were all worried about Harry and the baby. We entered the room and saw Harry smiling at us sleepily.
“It was Albus Dumbledore.” The goblin replied as he looked at the distressed wizard, frowning deeply. As soon as he said that, Harry’s magic went wild, and Harry’s mind went blank. He was feeling every emotion at once and yet feeling nothing at all, it seemed like everything was sucked away. He was frightened of those people, he was mad that he was left, he was sad that he had lost his childhood to these people. He felt himself calming down, and then blackness.
“It’s Christmas?!” Harry exclaimed, his green eyes wide and glittering with excitement looking down at Draco who was now sitting on the floor rubbing his head.
“Well done, Lord Potter-Black, now let’s move on to the heir rings. Please start with the Peverell ring and work your way from there.”
Heyy guys I do hope that you liked the chapter! please leave comments and kudos below telling me what you thought of the chapter! If you are shy send me and email at demondog136@yahoo.com and I will reply as soon as I have free time. utill next week my loveies :*
Harry took a handful of the ash like powder from the pot Severus was holding, before taking a step into the fire place. Levi quickly wrapped himself around his young master so not to be left behind. “Malfoy Manor,” Harry said, before throwing the powder, his view of Severus was interrupted by the burst of bright emerald green flames, before he was pulled and twisted, then spat ungracefully into a new place.
Professor McGonagall turned her gaze to Hagrid, some first years releasing their breaths. “Thank you Hagrid I will take them from here.”
A dark chuckle echoed around the room, “Children there is nothing to be afraid of right now, I am not about to harm you. Please take a seat.” The soft eerier voice said, three seats appearing out of nowhere. Harry took his seat his back straight, but more relaxed than his friends; his friends looked like they had a rod taped to their backs, their face pure white with fear. “I think that Harry has already provided you all the information and you know why you are here. I must say that I am impressed, a lot of others would have run away at the door rather than face a Dark Lord for their friend. Do not worry young ones; I will not hurt you… No I will let you help little Harry, so that he will not fail his small mission. Harry, I am happy to see who you have chosen, their families where great allies to the Dark, you have chosen well. But first, before we move on any further, I must get vows from you two that anything that is said in this room will never be spoken to others. To ensure success for the Dark side; once that is done, I will put a block in your mind so that fool of a headmaster will never know what we have said. Any questions?” The Dark Lord asked, causing the young Slytherins to shake their heads. “Alright children I need a vow, I would ask for the Unbreakable, but for now a vow on your magic will work.”
The poll! I want to know who you would love to see Theo's mate to be :3 tell me down in the comments.
So again if you are intrested in helping me writes these email me, or if not then leave a number down in the comments in what you really want to read in the future. Hope to hear from you guys!
“A little information about the wizarding world Harry, blood of any wizard is powerful so do be careful in the future.” Severus whispered into Harry’s ear explain his actions.
“It might be,” Severus said, not going to go right out and say that it was, “but that is something you do not have to concern yourself with young one. Just keep to yourself and everything will be alright.” Harry finally looked up at Snape with his huge green eyes boring into him to see the truth. Severus did not want Harry to go looking for any sort of trouble what so ever.
“I guess, I mean I have seen it enough times that I know what it’s like. Anyways that’s not the reason I dragged you in here, you need better clothes than what you are wearing.” The boy said eyeing Harry’s choice of clothing carefully. The boy was wearing worn looking jeans, and a baggy T-shirt, and the blonde knew that his father was just tolerating what the boy was wearing.
Draco enjoyed the joyous laugh from his mate, even though it was at his own expense, he put forward a pouting face as if upset that his mate would just laugh at him instead of helping him out of this mess. Harry just laughed harder and with a flick of his wand had magic help out making the cookies as he went to go help Draco.
“Good,” she said opening his door with her nose held high, “Today you need to make breakfast in celebration of Dudley’s birthday, do you think you could do that without messing up today?”
The owner of the establishment had enough and walked over to the two families, and spoke directly to the Durley’s. “If you would kindly leave, before we call the police. We do not take well for threats thrown at our customers, nor threats thrown at children; and you sir have done both!”
Of course, Severus never gave up, spending hours in his potions lab to create concoctions that the boy may need, and spending the next two days ridding the small boy of all the wounds inflicted upon him. After that Severus sat next to boy, waiting for him to open those green eyes, which were so much like his mothers.
It was also taking its toll on the adults in the household. Wishing that they could do more for the young youth; but all they could do was hold the child close as he wailed and cried his tiny heart out. If it wasn’t that; it was the constant fear and skittishness he displayed during the day. So, it was a happy evening when the mind healer showed up. Hoping that he would have a solution to help with the nightmares that were plaguing the young wizard.
A few moments after Harry came in, Severus followed suit picking up a mug before taking a seat, grunting a greeting to everyone in the room before taking a sip of the black mug.
“So Draco, what house are you looking to get in?” Harry asked, staring out the window into the inky blackness. They were still on the train, but had since changed into their robes as they approached the Hogwarts stop.
“I-I’m sorry I don’t have much to wear, these are my only clothes.” Harry said looking at the ground wringing his T-shirt between his hands. He was very self-aware of the clothes that he was wearing compared to the Malfoy’s, but this was all that was ever given to him.
Draco blinked in surprise, not expecting something like this. He thought that Potter wanted nothing to do with a ex-death eater, a known supporter of the dark, and his long-time rival at school. He was unsure how to answer this. “I-I would like that very much… And you are not the only one that has something to be sorry for… I am sorry for everything I have done too, sorry for being a prick, I am sorry for fighting for the wrong side in the war…”
Draco gave a soft smile back, even after all Harry has gone through here he was smiling at him. “Its fine Harry, don’t worry about it. It’s just going to be us at Christmas, and then everyone will be joining us at New Years, and that is in a couple of weeks there is no fear. Now, I think I found the strange creature it is a Cerberus.” Draco said and flipped the book around for Harry to read, there in the book was a crude picture drawing in the book a description about the creature and the weaknesses that they had. The only strange thing that seemed to be common was the music made the creature sleep. It might have to do with the only Greek tales that Harry read about whenever he escaped the house or the books Dudley refuse to read.
It had been a quiet week for Harry the beatings where very few this week, he counted his blessings, and tried his best to keep out of his uncle and cousins way as much as possible doing everything he could. So when Harry was told to fetch the mail that night he did so without complaint, so when he started to riffle through the mail, as to separate of whose mail it was he was surprise to see his name upon an envelope. Of course a quick glance around the empty hall to make sure no one notice this he slipped the letter underneath his cupboard door, knowing that is his Uncle or Aunt saw this there would be a price to pay. He quickly made his way back into the kitchen handing the mail to his Aunt and Uncle, before taking his place once again in the corner, waiting for his “family” to finish their dinner so he could clean up (and possible swipe) their leftovers.
Draco frowned, but didn’t push his friend anymore, knowing if he tried it would cause negative results.
The Dark Lords words hit home, he had known that Severus betrayed his trust, but now he has the boy that he is worried about, and he will do nothing to risk the boy’s safety. Severus thought over everything for a moment before nodding, he will listen to what the Dark Lord says that happened; of course that doesn’t mean that he believes a word what was said, since after all he was the Dark Lord. “
The healer held up a hand to keep me from demanding answers, “There is no need to worry lad, as we said there was some complications, but everything is resolved.” With a smile the healer looked at everyone in the room, “Would you guys like to step back in the room, with a promise not to cause trouble, and see everyone?”
“First years, your chambers are over to there,” Gemma said pointing to two doors, “Boys on the left, girls on the right. Please note that the password changes every fortnight and will appear on the notice board, please check that before you leave because you could be waiting for a long time before some lets you in. Please wait for the Head of House to come down and say a few words.” Gemma said, sitting down on one of the leather sofas relaxing a little.
The next morning, when Harry woke, the first thing he was aware of was the arms around his person and the second was that he had his head tucked underneath someone’s chin. Harry slowly shifted and pulled back, and saw that he and Draco were sharing a bed, and seemed to be somewhere that wasn’t the dorms. The shifting of the smaller boy woke Draco, his grey opening to meet his own green. Harry’s face grew hot at the sight, he was embarrassed at sharing the bed, then suddenly the memories from last night flooded back and his mind shut down. Draco noticed the sudden change in his friend mood, he looked on with a distant look and his body went ridged.
So that is what she did, she took her wand out and with a swish and flick motion that they had practiced at the beginning of the class along with a proper pronunciation of the spell, she had the feather float upwards and stop about four feet above their heads.
I just nodded, ready to be yelled at for being stupid or something like that. I wonder who my guardian was since Sirius couldn’t manage my accounts while he was in prison… and now that he is dead…
It was going to be a very busy day for all of them, so Harry didn’t need to spend his morning in the luxurious bed. He softly padded across the white fluffy carpet to the ensuite bathroom, Draco meanwhile rolled over to the warm spot Harry left in the bed frowning at the loss. The shower was one of the many things Harry had come to love while at the Malfoy’s. It wasn’t like one you found in the muggle world, being a magical shower, it had a sensory type magic knowing how hot the person wanted their shower how soft or hard the water came down as well. Unlike having a shower head like the muggle’s would use in a shower, it rain down straight from the ceiling. The first time Harry had to take a shower in it, he freaked out unsure of how to use it or what was happening; but he had fallen in love with the shower very fast since it was one of the many things Harry didn’t get to use a lot while staying with his relatives.
Anyways this chapter is another lengthy chapter to make up for the long wait I think it's about 3k nothing like the previous chapter but still longer then what I usually post so I do hope you enjoy it!
“I-I was w-wondering, d-do you think my mum and dad would see me as weak?” Harry mumbled into Severus thick outer teaching cloak.
“Draco, G-Gemma, c-can I-I speak to you two? I-it’s kind of important.” Harry stuttered, once he was back in the common area. Upon seeing both of his friends in the corner of the room, looking very concerned.
“All we want is to have a nice little chat if you will, and this time is better than any to get this done.” Said the voice which seemed to echo about the room, but seemed to be coming from Quirrell but his lips weren’t moving. “Please have seat so that we can talk,
“Well I want to know if a spell exists, and if it is okay if I use it.” Harry explained innocently, before taking a seat and waiting for Gemma.
“This is Harry Potter, I have been charged to make sure that he gets all the supplies he needs for Hogwarts.”
I do hope that you lovelies liked the chapter! Please leave comments and kudos below I live off the support, and love to see what you have to say about the story ;) if I like your idea I might feature it in a chapter! if you are too shy to comment and you really have to tell me something send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com
“Shh Harry, look at me, it’s okay.” Draco’s soft voice was right by his ear, as the blonde hair boy pulled him into his lap, rocking him slowly back and forth. “It’s okay they aren’t upset, just concerned, shhh.” Harry just gripped the boy’s shirt tighter.
“Okay Harry, I can tell that you can’t talk about it more than that, but can you do something for me?” Harry just shrugged his shoulders at Alec, not wanting to promise something that he might not be able to do, “I want you to write your dreams, memories, down in a journal. This will be your journal you do not have to share with any one, but you can if you want to, also this journal does not strictly have to be a dream journal it can be used anytime you think you should write in it.” He pulled a black journal with a lock on it, and another dark blue journal with no lock, “Now as you can see I have another journal, I want you to try to write in this as well, but unlike the black one this one we will look at what you written in to see what is bothering you question you might have, in the next session. Now you do not have write in these at all, but I do encourage you to do so, it will help you in the long run if you do.” Alec said his blue eyes meeting his green ones.
The blood swirled around the parchment before erupting, words sprawled across the page in such elegant writing revealing all of the lines that Harry had access too.
Severus sighed, “Such a disappointment. Alright I will give you one more chance. What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?”
Young Hatching it is good to hear you again, I have been trying for many days to get into contact with you, but something seems to have stoped it
“Wizard chess,” Draco said in awe, looking at the large game in front of him. Draco was the best at the game beating almost everyone at it. This is what he was made for, let the games begin.
“I will try my best, but you might have to step in.” Severus said looking between other two adults. “There is only so much I can do, I know, Lucius, this might be hard for you-“ The blonde hair man only held his hand up to silence the other.
. Draco just looked at Harry and mouthed “Ravenclaw” as the girl just rambled on, Harry just snorted and shook his head.
Harry smiled up at Gemma, nodding. Gemma leaned down and whispered the spell into Harry’s ear, and a second later Harry was running off back to the dorms where un-expecting victims where. Theo just watched in amusement, and a reminder that he never want to be on the receiving end of Harry’s pranks. It was only a minute later before explosion sounds where going off in the dorm and Harry running out laughing. Some of the older years looked on, laughing at the younger years as they scrambled out of the dorm screaming.
“I’m sorry Harry, just out of everything you could have asked; this was a left field question. Well it was the stone we had received; we sent it back to the owners. They were so grateful that they offered an opportunity, letting me have anything, so I asked if it was possible for a body. Nick set to work, and had a type of potion ready in two days, he also said that Dumbledore is no longer access to his work or alchemist research and has lost privilege in that society. He is also in trouble with the papers since Nick has a lot of people looking into his work, and to have it stolen was not a good mark on the Headmaster’s record. Nick also wanted me to inform you if you ever need anything, he will take his time and help you with what you need.”
Hello Lovelies I hope you all had a good week! :D This chapter is one big fluff cute chapter! it is a shorter chapter then some, but I think we could have used a break from all the drama : and so our kitten has a moments rest. Anyways a big thanks goes to my beta as always <3 love them dearly for taking time to do this! with that we can move on too the story!
In other news today was my last day at college for this semester, I am sad to leave but happy for a summer break! So far I have nothing planed on summer break so I am hoping to keep the weekly chapter's going, but if I can't I will post ahead of time the reason.
Harry nodded his head, glancing over to Severus. He would pay good money to know what was going through that man’s head right now. Severus eyes narrowed at the other professor, he had his eye on the professor ever since he was hired. There seemed to be something off about him, and Severus did not like it one bit.
It was a great party, Harry hung out with the twins most of the night. Theo and Blaise had stopped by there table once or twice, before heading back to their parents side. Draco spent most of his time with his Father and Mother as well, since they were the host family. Harry was surprised to see Gemma there and briefly talked to her about the upcoming semester, and what he had to look forward to in classes; while the twins where asking her thoughts on how to not get caught. At one point before the clock stuck twelve, Severus came and hung out with them for a bit as well, enjoying the start of the new with his new son. All and all it was a great night for Harry, and his smile never left his face. This was the first year where he wasn’t counting down from inside his cupboard, and was celebrating it with friends and family. He was happy to celebrate with his family, and was looking forward to a relaxing year at Hogwarts.
If no one knew better they would say that the youth was being beaten. As for his caregivers, they were very concerned for both the youth’s emotional levels and health; seeing how the boy barely got an hours nights rest.
At the same time that Ron spoke, Professor Snape walked in and stalked his way to the front of the class room.
3. Severus adopts and raises Harry, as in he rescues Harry at an early age. Or that he is really Harry's father. 3 votes
Gemma swallowed a lump that had formed in her throat. “He already made it passed your riddle sir.” The girl yelped moving out of the man’s way when he took off in a run in the direction they just came through, Levi hissing slithering after the man. Sparing a glance at Draco, Gemma turned around and ran after the Professor not liking this one bit.
“Sev? C-can I know h-how everyone knows for sure that the D-dark L-lord killed my parents?” Harry asked the man, now relaxing a bit into the hug after the day he had. Severus tensed, why was the boy asking something like that? It was something the boy never asked about, at least not since Severus explained everything he could to the young boy.
With a nod, the goblin wrote it down in my files, letting it be known of the slight changes made to my accounts.
Harry’s nose screwed up as Lucius spoke, his eyes no longer haunted by the past, instead they were like a roaring fire. “Why are we allowed to place such people in the classification as creature? They are just as powerful as us. They have studied the likes of war longer than we ever have, and have magical abilities just like our own. So wouldn’t that make them an equal to us?” Harry retorted to Lucius, almost demanding the older wizard to prove him wrong. It was just for a second before Harry realized that he had spoken back to an adult. “I-I’m s-sorry s-sir.” Tears quickly came to his eyes, then he dropped to the floor, curling up into a small ball to protect himself from whatever beating was to come.
I do hope you liked the chapter, please leave comments and kudos they really help me with writing. If you are shy or just want to talk send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com
Draco just scoffed at Harry, his family might have been Grey, but they did swing more to the Dark. Gemma didn’t care to share much of her family, just saying that she would stick with Harry since he was her little brother in everything except blood. It was time to face the Dark Lord, hold his head high; he now had his own support with his friends and Severus behind him. He just hoped that this was the right choice in the war.
“Thank you, guys, so very much… there is one more thing that I have to tell you before we leave to talk to Professor Quirrell. This is something completely different than what we just talked about. I know that you two have been worried over my mental state since the first week back; trying to help me in sneak ways such as extra food or sleep.” Both of his friends blushed, thinking that they had hidden it well enough, since they are Slytherin’s, but they were worried for their friend when he looked on the verge of collapse.
They were making slow progress to the Potions Master’s living quarters when the cat showed up, and if Mrs. Norris was here, the caretaker was sure to follow. Of course, Harry and the old man had nothing against each other, but that didn’t mean that he would let him go easy. So, Harry slipped inside the first door he could when he heard the signs of footsteps and the gruff voice of the caretaker, “My sweets, did you hear a student?” The man asked the cat, who meowed back to the man before taking off on a chase, but away from Harry. Once the footsteps where gone, Harry let out a sigh of relief.
“Do you want me to go first and catch you, or do you already have Longbottom on the other side waiting?”
“No duh, Potter! Do you see a fucking door?!” Draco turned his venom eyes at Potter in rage. This was not how he wanted to spend his Christmas. Like, seriously, if he wanted to be locked in a room he would have gone home. But the icing on the cake was being trapped with Potter.
I do hope that you liked it! :) Please leave comments and Kudos down below telling me what you thought! also send me an email asking question or something at demondog136@yahoo.com I don't bite!
Harry’s eyes widened in fright. ‘No, no, they cannot find out that I am unclean!’ His breaths grew shorter, he started to scratch at his arms with his fingernails trying to get away from those thoughts, those memories.
I stood in front of Gringotts Bank, still very much in awe of the beautiful building as well as being a ball of nerves. I don’t want to get on the goblins’ bad side and get kicked out of the bank. I have no idea how to go about properly comporting myself in front of them like other pure-bloods and half-bloods that have accounts with them.
“Sev, I have a question.” Harry simply stated, Severus lifted his chin up a bit to indicate that the child should continue on, “I-I was wondering if you know anything about the Philosopher’s Stone? T-The Dark Lord has asked me to read up on it.”
Harry was the first one to wake up from their night of talking and drinking, his head was foggy and felt himself laying on someone. He slowly opened his eyes to see Draco sleeping beneath him an arm draped around his waist his hair wild and untamed by gel, it was a sight to see. Harry quickly tore himself away, a blush forming at the thought of Draco looking so sweet and handsome asleep.
“A couple of my friends need to get a possible cleansing, after an inheritance test. It seems their mate can feel them but it’s extremely muted, and for them they feel nothing.”
“Well would you look at that, the little lady has found someone.” A voice said, making Harry jump away from the small kitten. “Don’t you worry, lad I am happy that she has found someone, everyone passes her up, taking all her siblings and leaving this little girl all alone.” The man said looking at the boy. “Look I will sell her for 15 Galleons, how does that sound?” Harry thought about sending a glance at the young kitten that was looking at him with such promise and hopeful eyes that he couldn’t deny her. Harry nodded at the man and handed him 15 Galleons, while the man let the kitten out of the small cage. Harry spotted Draco and his Mum buying him an Eagle owl who held his chest all puffed out all proud like, Harry couldn’t help but smile at them. Now he only hoped Severus wouldn’t be too upset with his purchase.
My raptured attention was pulled away as I felt the draw to the rings. The magic flowing through the room with a warm breeze, I picked up both rings knowing that they accepted me and placed them on my left index finger. There was a glow as the two rings melted into each other forming one ring. It was now a silver ring with a gold inlay, the two stones staggered the ruby on top of the onyx stone.

“Then in order for the heir rings we have the Peverell, Gryffindor, Morgan Le Fay, then Merlin’s,” the goblin went on after I was done inspecting the Lordship rings. The Peverell ring was a large, emerald set in white gold, with bands weaving in and out of each other like snakes in a conglomerate. Gryffindor was just like the Potter ring, just a larger Ruby. The Le Fay ring was a sterling silver oval black onyx Celtic ring, almost reminding me of the Black’s ring, but just the Celtic symbols were different. Then Merlin’s was a sight to behold, the stone itself was something I have never seen before, it reminded me of looking at galaxy pictures back in Primary school, but more alive, as I could see the movement of the swirls in the ring. It was inlaid in a black band that was also an unknown material, I was just mesmerized and drawn to the ring.
His uncle stormed down the steps before yanking on the boy’s hair meeting him face to face, “YOU FREAK! WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY US!” His uncle spat into his face. He turned his gaze to the woman in the door looking at them, “You!” He said to the woman in the door, “I want you and Dudley to take a small walk to the park while I take this care of him…” Knowing that his wife didn’t like to witness nor hear the punishment of the freak. The women just nodded and went off to take her son to the park.
“What are those?” Harry asked, trying to hide behind Severus, trying to get out of straying eyes of these strange creatures.
Draco sighed indicating that I had won the argument this time, he place a hand on my lower back and helped me waddle my way into the living rooming, walking slow as I wasn’t able to move as fast as I use to. When we were almost into the living room I felt a strange pressure on the lower part of my body. I stopped in my tracks at the wired feeling making Draco look at me with concern, “are you alright love?” He asked wondering if he made a mistake about moving me.
“Of course Draco, I’m sorry I worried you.” Harry said apologetically, though he couldn’t stop smiling.
Heyy Lovelies I'm back and I have missed you all! I first want to thank everyone for the support and love during my little break and understanding that I needed to take it. <3 I am now back in college and this might be last year (not too sure yet because I am still have few hours short) so I will be trying to get back into writing when I can. With that being said I still have no update schedule since I am slowly writing when I have the time to write between classes and homework. My hope is to have maybe a bi-monthly update, but if not that continue on the trend of once a month at least. So please be a little patience as you guys have been with me for more than a year (this fic is over a year old!). To those who read TBTSTS I will try to get to updating that fic as well, when I have the chance so keep but that will happen at a later date. Well enough from me, I will get to the chapter I do want to say that  I am sorry with how short it is. I need to get back into practice of writing, I have had a loooong break lolz. I also need to give amandadubose88 a shout out for being the beta for this chapter <3 she is amazing for putting up with me over the summer and there the lack of communication I did. So thank you and love ya for being an amazing friend. With that being said we are sorry for mistakes that still slipped through, I haven't had time to go back and read through when I got it back from her, so please be nice and point them out and  I will try to go back and fix mistakes when possible.
I do hope that you liked it, please leave kudos and comments telling me what you think and how I can fix the story to better you reading enjoyment. If you are too shy to post on here email me~ demondog136@yahoo.com
“C’mon firs’ years follow me!” Hagrid said, as he turned to a muddy narrow path. The first years tried to keep up with him, slipping and stumbling down the path, Harry and Draco clung to each other to make sure that neither of them fell into the mud. It led them to a deep inky black lake, the stars reflecting on the water, and every once in a while a ripple was heard; boats lined the shore, waiting for students to step in
It was an hour after everything was said that Harry and his friends make it to where the Dark Lord would be. Harry was sure that he had made the right call. He was happy that his friends where going to help him through everything, even if that meant joining the “Dark” side with him. Right before they left Gemma’s room he had explained why he was going to give support to the “Dark” side, why he felt the way he did. He told them that if any point they wanted out, he would find them an out no questions ask; it was the least he could do for his friends, knowing what they are giving up for him.
I started to relax, I don’t think I was ready to meet one of the founders and the most powerful Dark Witch and Light Wizard known in time. He placed the inheritance paper in a tube-like thing and it was gone in a flash. Short seconds later, there were 6 ring boxes sitting on the goblins desk.
“So? She has to notice that no one likes her.” With that they moved out of the range of the two young snakes. Harry was concerned for his friend, but thought to give her some space, casting a glance at Draco, the just continued on with their day.
“Hey! Yeah step on through!” I called back, since I didn’t feel like struggling to get up from the chair. The floo flared green and out stepped a figure, she hasn’t changed that much since I have seen her, she still wore the strange necklaces, and cloths that seemed to always leave a strange impression, but at the same time fit her the best. Her eyes always seem to be string into the distance, never really focusing on anything, but at the same time was filled with unknown knowledge behind them.
Lucius just smiled at his old friend. “Of course Severus, he was a delight to have around, such a gentleman too.” Harry just blushed at the praise that was being passed over his head, not used to hearing such nice words about him.
Lets start off with I am sorry for the long breaks between my chapters and updates, I wish I could give you weekly chapters like I use to and have a schedule I could follow, but my life at this moment can not handle it. My college degree come first, my well being comes second, family comes third, then my free time for writing. This is also not my top priory to update and write, I wish it was I love this AU a lot, but what comes first is MNW and DSS and if I have more free time to write then bits and pieces of this one which hasn't happen sadly. I think the reason being is I am at a point in this writing I don't want to be at, I personally have not gone through something like this (I have no clue why I wrote something like this) so it makes it difficult to write, but I will try my best. So yeah I am sorry about the long periods of no updates even though it deserves some loving here.
!!!!WARNINGS!!! RAPE, RAPE OF A MINOR, TALK OF RAPE, CHILD ABUSE.... Please Please just skip this chapter if you are triggered by anything of this sorts <3
“Harry do you know who is here! It’s a Malfoy.” Nev said. I could smell now that he was a Dom, much like Draco, and was ready to defend me to the last breath for not only being a sub, but his almost younger brother sub.
Harry finished up softly, unsure if he was asking too much, afraid of being punished for stepping out of line. Even with all the help from the mind healer there are still moments where he was trapped in the past and his actions betrayed those moments.
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts right over there.” Hagrid said pointing out a huge castle sitting on top a mountain, as they grew closer to the shoreline.
Harry tenderly got of bed the butt plug currently in and slowly started to make his way to the bathroom to clean up and bit and maybe get some water, but paused when he saw his reflection in the mirror. His green eyes still with tinges of gold around them as the heat was slowly dimensioning, his hair wild from all the sex and cuddles that come being in heat but what caught his attention the most was his tender, but still full belly. His hand slowly wonder down to the bulging cum filled womb that was distended but not overly full. It was tender from how often it was filled, but the thought of what this is what he would look like carrying pups. His hand slowly cups underneath carefully as if scared, but the omega inside was so happy at the sight. He was filled with is Alpha cum inside and out and he will produce a pup with all this cum, such beautiful pups! Harry just smiled letting the omega in him enjoy this time.
Draco stood, even though his legs were trembling and they barely held him up, removing his wand with trembling fingers, the lump in his throat tightening as he felt the eyes, of what to seem to be the dead upon him. “I-I, Draconis Lucius Malfoy, swear upon my magic that I will do everything in my power to help Harry Potter on his quest, set before him by the Dark Lord. I swear that anything that I have been told regrading today, or in the foreseeable future, without permission from the Dark Lord or Harry himself. So mote it be.” The second he was done his body gave out, and he collapsed bonelessly into the chair. He felt like he walked the valley of Death with nothing with him for support.
With that, the goblin turned around and started walking at a fast pace, leaving the Malfoy family and I to follow behind him. We followed the goblin through a maze of long hallways with many doors. Some areas were decorated in fine gold and precious gems, others with weapons, one area was an open mining area and you could see a few goblins extracting gems straight out of the walls.
With that Alec left the young sleeping wizard to go talk to two very over protective father figures (even though Harry doesn’t see it).
“You protect that freak all you want, but in the end he will come back with me, since he is to live with us!”
Lee thought over this for a moment, but noticed that the twins had an idea and wasn’t going to stop one of their pranks. “Yeah of course mates, but I want him back in one piece!” Lee said firmly, looking at both of the twins.
Harry ran all the way back to the room that he shared with Sev, not even caring that he might be heard as long as he is far away from that mirror. Seeing his mum and dad was too much for Harry. The door to the room slammed shut behind Harry as he sank lower to the ground gasping for air, the edges of his vision tinted black; he wasn’t sure it was from the run, or an onset of a panic attack.
"Harry?" The boy let himself be peeled away from the cloak, to be face to face with the potion master. "Can you tell me your dream?" The boy shook his head, not wanting to talk about his old home life anymore, that was in the past, something he didn't want to remember.
It was long before the rest of the Slytherin’s began to rise for the day, some already dressed, others still in the nightgowns. Harry took that moment to go back to the first year’s dorm and get ready for the day. Most of the other first year boys where still asleep with the exception of Theo, who was digging through his trunk; the others consisted of Draco, Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe, the girls where Pansy Parkinson, Daphne Greengrass, and Millicent Bulstrode.
Now it was Halloween, and classes seemed to be a little easier allowing the younger years a break just in time for the celebrations. Charms class was interesting to say the least, they were learning the levitation spell, causing the objects to fly upwards to the ceiling. It seemed that this spell was giving everyone a little trouble. Harry had managed to get his feather a few centimeters off his desk before it started to wobble a bit and fell neatly back to the desk. Draco, of course, had already mastered the spell and was trying his best to show Harry how to do it. It was part way through class that they heard a conversation across the room where the Gryffindor’s sat. Ron Weasley was getting upset that he could not do the spell and shouted in frustration, “
It was after everyone was gone and He and Hermione where sitting on the couch after cleaning up the apartment enjoying a glass of wine. He reflected on the encounter and how he fucking blushed like a virgin. He brought a pillow to his face and screamed into it, “HERMIONE I HATE WHEN YOU ARE RIGHT?!” The witch in question just took a sip of her wine and smirked, took him long enough.

“TROLL!” Quirrell shouted until he got to the middle of the hall, staring dead at the head table. “Troll in the dungeon! I thought you ought to know.” Before falling to a dead faint, right then and there. The hall was quite for a few seconds as the news started to sink in before the whole room started to scream in terror. Draco was still in shock, troll in the dungeon and so many thoughts were going through his head. First was where was Harry, in all the commotion he had forgotten that Harry went in search for Hermione. Second was that their house was located in the dungeon, where were they supposed to go?
I do hope you enjoy the long awaited chapter 19 <3 I was going to wait but I was super excited and happy I wrote a new chapter
As always I do hope that you liked the chapter, please leave comments and Kudos below to let me know what you thought or send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com <3 till next chapter!!
“Malfoy, Draco!” Harry smiled at his friend as he proudly made his way to the hat. It wasn’t fully on his head before the hat shouted, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy smiled at Harry before taking a seat at his house table, shaking hands with a few of the older students as the welcomed him.
The goblin who had entered the room unnoticed when Lucius spoke about them just smiled at the younger wizard. The younger wizard was filled with surprises, he had such a great future ahead of him, and the goblin nation was right behind him 100%. It was time that he made his presence known to the group, by clearing his throat. He spoke once both older wizards eyes were on him, “Thank you for the wait, I am Ullrig, and I have been in charge of the Potter’s accounts since the last Lord Potter passed.”
After a couple more wands, Harry felt like giving up, there hasn’t been one that he liked. At this point Narcissa and Draco had retreated outside after paying for Draco’s wand, the kitten following them as well, as each wand produced a new catastrophic effect. Ollivander frown grew grave as he thought of a wand and went to retrieve it, of course he knew this was the one for boy, but it was curious.
“I-I have to do something for him Alec, he never deserved to go through that. Hell nobody should go through that. What can I do?” Severus whispered in defeat.
The Omega had obeyed his alpha commands and not touched himself but he had to get rid of his clothes they were too itchy for his skin he hastily presented himself for his alpha as he smelt the scent of cinnamon and a rick smokey heat grow closer to the door, he arched his back to give his alpha the best view of his arse and lowered his chest and gasp as his sensitive buds brushed against he fabric. He heard the door open a growl from behind. Harry turned his glasses green golden eyes to his still dressed Alpha and whined seeing all the layers between them. He needed his alpha in him hours ago, need his alpha to breed him to give him pups! The alpha gave another growl and with a flick of his wand he stood behind his omega naked. The omega gave a happy hum happy to see his alpha and cast his gaze lower eyeing Draco member. Draco was thick for an alpha even without the knot he was well embowed too, the omega wiggles his perk arse wanting to feel every inch of his alpha.
“Those are goblins Harry, be careful around them, and do not get on the wrong side of them, they can be a force to be reckoned with.” Severus explained, not pausing in step as they made their way to the back of the building where a goblin was free to help them. Just before they could step up in front of the teller, a Giant took their spot.
Severus thought to himself, watching how the cute little kitten slowly made its way to the much larger kitten eating snake and tries to pounce it, always at the last second does Levi move his tail way from the kitten. Severus takes a seat in his favorite chair near the fire watching the boy and his animals, giving into the small smile that finds its way to his face.
Maybe I shouldn't post this early in the morning, I almost posted to the wrong fic xD I almost posted to DSS and not here my bad. Anyways! Hello lovelies, I hope that all of you guys are doing good, I am sorry yet again for the long wait for the next chapter, I kinda of got stuck on this chapter for a bit at the same time RL is just made of tests and exams.

I would like to thank you all for commenting of the last chapter! so many votes came through, and it was just so fun to see all your ideas and what you would like to see, so thank you! Also a big thanks goes to amadadubose88 for reading over this chapter, over the weekend and taking time away from her own writing to do so. So thank you~~ anyways enough from me I'll let you get to the story.
Draco Malfoy, the only Slytherin left at Hogwarts. Of course it was by his choice, he didn’t want to go home. If he could call it that anymore; his father was just a shell of the man he was, he was under strict Auror watch, all family heirlooms where under ministry lock and key because they where afraid they were full of dark magic. Even their accounts had been frozen and their house elves gone. It was just a sad sight if one walked into Malfoy manor and Draco took every opportunity to leave that barren manor. His mother was lucky and had escaped everything, since Potter spoke on her behalf, and was now living it up in Greece, in one of her favourite town houses there. She told Draco she loved him then just straight up left, as if she no longer had a son. There was no letter, there was no nothing. So all he had left was a huge empty manor and a broken father, not much to go back to.
“Thank you Levi, Neit, I don’t know how I came to deserve you.” The young boy said, looking close to tears at what the snake said.
“Sorry Draco, I met some new friends,” Harry said casting a glance over at the red head twins, “they helped me when I was pushed to the ground, and was helping me out to find you.” Harry explained when Draco scowled at the thought of Harry having other friends them himself.
By dinner time Harry still hasn’t seen Hermione in any classes that they shared, nor did he see her at the Gryffindor’s table. Harry frowned, this was not like his friend at all, to miss classes, but on top of it all, dinner as well?
A whimpering noise followed by a hush hissing pulled Alec from his thoughts. He looked over to Harry to see the young snake stuck in a nightmare, or sadly a memory. Levi was hissing at the boy sounding concern and sad at the same time, if snakes could sound like that hissing. Alec leaned over to the bed from the chair he sat in and gently ran his fingers through the young boy’s hair, letting some of his magic drift through his fingers to calm the young wizard down.
Severus just smirked at his young charge, “Very good Mr. Potter, 20 points to Slytherin, for opening your book and reading before coming to my class.” Severus then turned to look at the rest of the class just staring at him, “Well, why aren’t you writing this all down?!” That got everyone’s attention and they scrambled to get their quills and parchment out and start taking notes.
Harry just nodded quickly to appease the snake, who slowly lowered itself back to the ground before slithering over to the frighten young wizard.
Harry looked at the letter in a state of disbelief, there was no way in the world that he, Harry Potter, was a wizard. There must have been a mistake somewhere, he was just Harry who was a slave to his family forced to live under the stairs.
Harry found the blood potions very interesting when he was reading about it at the manor. The blood adoption was very common for wizards so that lines would not die out, but pure blood children would still have a loving family. They were most commonly used in times of war or times of extreme illness. Soon the Ministry of Magic band such practice since it was a source of “Blood magic” and all the books that where made have been locked up or destroyed. There were still some copies that are hidden and forgotten in pure blood family’s library’s, some even sold in the black markets since the ministry still regulated of all the dark magic and blood magic books. The Lord of Malfoy manor had dug through all of the books in his private library searching for such a thing to help ensure that Severus and Harry would not be ripped a part when the stupid Hogwarts Headmaster found out what had happened. It had taken him a few weeks before he stumbled upon the books and written down everything that Severus needed to ensure success.
Look at what you voted both twins! It was crazy with how many of you wanted both twins! Also Drama to come! >:3 are you ready for it??
“Be still Omega,” Draco growled as Harry shifted and whined, Draco took a deep breath of Peppermint that was driving him insane at the scent and anger his inner Alpha as he sat his omega on the bed, “Need to clean up the mess outside make sure those cookies don’t burn down the house. Do not touch anything till I am back.” The Alpha growled, wanted his mate to cum by his own actions. The Omega whined too lost in the heat, and upset that his Alpha was leaving him at this time but knew he obey his Alpha orders.
It was Saturday that Harry found himself sitting in Severus’s quarters, which in itself was not unusual, but what was that Severus called him here. Harry had no idea of why he would be called here, he was doing well in all of his classes, and he had not missed anything, the only thing that was giving him trouble was those nightmares. So why was he called here? His question was answered when the Floo flared green and out stepped a man, he was carrying a note book and bag with him and he smiled at Harry. He was dressed in a muggle clothes, a black button up shirt and black slacks his hair was a dark brown that was slicked back, his eyes a dark blue color.
Harry didn’t respond to the answer that he was given, fearing that they would get tired with him and throw him away sooner or later. He slid from Severus’ lap and walked to his desk taking out his dream journal, writing everything he could remember from the dream that night. His hands shook as he got to certain parts, but he forced himself to continue to write.
“Alright Draco ready to go? We have to start packing if we are going to get on the train tomorrow.” With that the two boys left with more questions than answers, but it didn’t matter to them, all they thought about was the fun that they were going to have this Christmas.
Levi was tired, the trek through the Castle was a harsh one; trying to make sure he took the fastest possible way here from the towers. The door leading to the rooms swung open without as much as a hiss from him. Levi quickly made his way into Severus’s room making his way on to the bed laying his body right on the man’s chest. Levi gave a harsh loud hiss right in the man’s face his long fangs was the first thing the Potion Master saw in his drowsy state. He quickly sat up with wand in hand before Levi could make a move.
“Sir, I would really like that, but I would have no way to pay you back until, I got more money from the bank.” Harry said, wanting to get the potion, but at the same time feeling bad that his professor was going through all this trouble for him when he couldn’t give him anything.
Severus was in shock when he heard what Harry just asked. Why would he think that his parents would view him as weak? Could it be from his time with those muggles? He couldn’t wait until he got his hands on them!
Hermione just smiled at the praise while the red head just sneered and laid his head down upon his stack of books. Upset that he was showed up, by a girl no less.
“So why do you need this tarantula?” Harry asked the twins, lightly running his thumb down the spiders back.
Harry's first reaction to this was to recoil in on his self, and then to plea for his life. "I-I'm sorry Uncle I-I didn't mean to! Please d-don't hurt me!" The young boy called out his hands above his head, his whole body shivering in fear. The possessed man just stopped, The Dark Lord was very confused to see what laid before him; he had lived this before. Why would the Boy-Who-Lived be cowering in fear? Could he possibly know who he was? No, that wasn't possible! The boy had said "Uncle", one of the people he now lived with. The dark lord just shook his head clear, no it wasn't possible. He encouraged his human vessel to continue with the action he had started, but the boy was nowhere to be seen. Quirrell scowled, he had just taken his eyes off the boy for a second. How is it possible for the boy to move that quick without him noticing? It was when he took a step closer that he heard footsteps echoing on the stone floor, leaving him with enough time to slip back onto his own cot. In rushed Madame Pomfrey, in her night clothes still, hustling over to the boy's bed, and right behind her was Severus Snape, his trusted Potion maker.
“Master Potter, I’s be sorry if I woken you. Mipsy didn’t mean to!” The small elf said, twisting her hands into her pillow case uniform, “I’s was bout to wake you for breakfast, Master Potter! Mipsy will be getting that.” With a pop, she was out of my room, in a quest to bring me my breakfast. It was just a breath later that the small little elf was back with a tray loaded to the brim with breakfast. There was toast, eggs, potatoes, what seemed to look like a type of fish, tea, pumpkin juice, milk and some potions. I had no idea how I could eat everything upon this tray. Mipsy levitated the tray straight into my lap, “If Master Potter ever be needsing anything, just call for Mipsy and I’s will be there!” With a quick curtsy, Mipsy disappeared once again with a pop.
“Everything is fine, Harry you have done nothing wrong, but next time I would like a little warning of when you do come down, so I can be ready myself.” Severus said to calm the young dark haired wizard down, before he worked himself into a panic attack.
Severus looked up at Alec with his eyes glistening but no tears in sight. “When have you become the voice of reason?”
I hoped you liked the chapter! :D I live off of comments and kudos lovelies and would love if you left some for me; it makes me all soft and warm to read what you guys think of the story! If you are shy email me! :) and I would get back to you as soon as I can, demondog136@yahoo.com see you lovelies in two weeks!
I took one of his hands that automatically wrapped around my waist and pushed the goblet into it, so it would be easier for me to cut the palm of my hand. Once secured, I swiftly made a diagonal cut, letting the blood flow freely into the goblet; the knife was sharper than what I thought it would be and I might have cut a little too deeply, but all the same, the goblet was quickly filled.
Severus sighed, “yes that is still his fear, even after how many times I have told him over and over that he is not going anywhere that he is stuck with me until the end of time. I’m hoping that we can bring those monsters to justice here soon; but that will not be possible until Harry is mentally better and ready to face them.” Knowing that the court would want proof of everything, and that would include Harry’s memories of the events that took place during his time there at his “families” house.
“I can join you, and we can work together, and at the same time you can hang out with Levi.” Harry couldn’t say no, or it would cause suspicion on his part so he just nodded. He would have told him sooner or later, at least he wouldn’t have to keep his only friend in the dark.
“For the claiming of a Lordship, we will need just three drops of blood on each ring and then we place the ring on your left index finger. These rings will form together and create one ring, but can be separated as well. For your heir rings, we place them on your right ring finger and let magic decide if you are fit to be heir,” the goblin explained, setting the rings out on his desk.
“Harry, I need you to promise to never go looking for that mirror again, it is a dangerous thing, it is known as the Mirror of Erised, and it shows what a person’s heart desires. Witches and wizards alike have sat in front of the mirror and wasted away to nothing, please promise me that you will not go looking for it again.” When Harry nodded, Severus let out a sigh, “We will talk more in the morning after a good night’s rest.” Severus said after Harry let out a big yawn. Harry cheeks colored a little, for he was feeling a little childish, but he also felt safe right now, “C-can I sleep with you?” Harry asked. Severus could not help but smile at this his chest warming just a bit, “Of course little one.”
Severus had to hide the smile that tried to make its way to his face. “Well, two things really. One, I was wondering if you would like to restore eyesight to your left eye.”
“Draco, I have a confession to make.” Harry glanced at Draco who was looking at him with an eyebrow raised. “It’s thanks to Hermione that I’ve came to realize, the reason I always call you names or hex you or even fight with you… I want your attention I am still 11 years old unsure how to get attention from someone I am attracted to… That’s right you heard me I like you very much Draco.” Harry said with a rueful laugh knowing this might every well be a one-sided attraction.
Another note: I am thinking of other stories that I can do for you guys, but I would like some help. :) I am looking for a co-author to help me out. It would the first piece I would ever write with another person, but I would really love to give it a chance! So if you want to give me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com :)
I looked at the clock, “Alright, time to do this!” I said, breaking from Draco’s embrace, hearing him laughing. I got a handful of floo powder and stepped into the fireplace, “Longbottom Manor, Gillyweed,” making sure to say it loud and clear. I really need to ask Nev to change the password, that joke is over and done with by now. It was then I was whisked through the floo system in a dizzying spinning motion, and then spit out in a less than graceful manner. If it wasn’t for a strong pair of arms wrapping around me, I would have face planted into the granite floor. A laugh entered my ear as I was hauled to my feet in a more stable manner.
Harry just gave Draco a tired smile, almost looking like grimace, since he was unsure of how to act around the other wizard. He held out a hot chocolate to Draco in the hopes of building a bridge of truce, for the moment at least. Draco took the offered mug with a sigh, their fingers brushing against each others. Harry quickly retracted his hand as if the touch burned him, but really trying to cover up the long for contact. Draco’s own hand tingled from the brush, as if for the first time in his life he had been touched for real.
“Master Ragnok, I was wondering if I could take the trip down to vault 7, as requested in my inherence test.” The toothy grin came upon the Master Goblin’s face.
I took a deep breath in; I did not need Ragnok to talk me through what I needed to do to open the vault. As soon as I laid my eyes upon the vault, I knew how to get in. All that information flooded into my mind as I studied the runes. I walked slowly over to the large door, lifted my hand and pressed it into the dragon that was posed ready to strike. If the wrong person was to attempt what I was doing, the dragon would have sucked all the magic out of their body. For me, the magic flowed from my hand into the door, making the runes light up and glow. The most stunning part was the dragon’s eyes glowing a killing green before a groan was heard from the vault door, hissing as the ancient air escaped. The door was open after hundreds of years, but only wide enough for me to enter.

“Yes, I will forgive you only if you join my side. Think boy at what the light side has ever given to you! All they did was give you over to the muggles! And forgot about you! And it seems that the muggles where not the nicest people. The Light also kept you away from magic, they left you alone, ignorant, defenseless, and forgotten.” The Dark Lord crooned before letting a snarky laugh escape his lips.
Draco left, but not before giving Harry a last toe curing kiss that left his Omega in a dizzy spell. He stormed through the house, spelling the tree together quickly along with spelling the kitchen clean and putting the cookies Harry made under a stasis spell to preserve them. He quickly locked up the floo to make sure no unwanted visitors came through. He locked up the house and if any of their friends stopped would quickly put two and two together and make a hasty leave. With a quick look around to make sure the house was on lock down for the next couple of days and a quick pre-written letters to employers they have just incase sent Draco made haste back to his Omega his inner Alpha growling at how long it was taking. As Draco grew closer to the door the smell of Peppermint grew thicker and the undertone of the sweet scent of an Omega in heat. Gone the logical wizard and in place was the Alpha run by rut as he slammed the door open, he couldn’t help but smirk at the sight of his Omega naked and arse presented to him.
Severus finally drew the courage to look at the small boy that lay upon the big bed, and he remembered the moment he brought the boy in here. He had worried that the boy wouldn’t make it. He was already small and weak as it was, but with the infection setting into those festering wounds, it made it a lot harder to keep a good outlook for the boy.
“Y-You mean, that I would never have to go back to them?” Harry’s voice filled with hope, Severus nodded his lips twitching, “B-But who?”
“If you say so.” Still unsure if he believed me so I just rolled my eyes at him taking a seat in our window seat picking up a discarded book and leafing through it.
I couldn’t help but be sick at the thought of marrying Ginny, “First off, that is just gross, I never found females to be attractive at all. I am happy to express that I am gay, I’ve known this also since my fourth year. Also, I love the Weasley family, but they are too judgmental about everything, Ron and his mother especially. Out of the whole family, the only ones I have that tight a bond as I do with Nev would be the twins and Charlie. To both me and Nev, those three red heads are our unofficial brothers, if anything happens to them or to us, we will stand with them no matter what.” I gave him a sly smile, “We didn’t want anyone else figuring out what we did, since mail can be intercepted, also a certain headmaster would disapprove of what I did and he likes to read all the letters I receive and send most of the time, so we put that in as a joke.”
“I think she went to her dorm right quick, but should be back shortly. Why?” If Harry was going to do something, he was either going to be a part of it or be long gone.
Vernon reached over and gave the glass a tap, “Move!” When the snake still didn’t yield any movement, Dudley pounded out the glass himself, “MOVE!” and yet the snake did nothing. Giving up Dudley moved on to the next enclosure giving Harry once again alone time with the snake.
“I know, I want you guys to stay here and I will complete the mission. Go back and tell the Dark Lord that we are almost done, and then go find my Father.” Harry said, holding out the rounder bottle to them.
"Come here child, there is nothing to be scared of." Severus said softly to coax the small child from his hiding place underneath the bed, "There is no one here to hurt you, you do not have to be afraid."
“As you know, I think this is the first time I have ever seen you awake this early,” Severus smirked when Gemma lowed her eyes and blushed.
Harry froze at the sight of the large building that seemed to pop out of nowhere, he would have liked to just stand there and stare in awe, but Severus wasn’t going to have that. Instead he grabbed the young wizards arm and dragged him into the building, out of the boisterous street. When they entered the large building, Harry was shocked that the workers were short, old looking creatures with pointed ears and sharp teeth, all wearing similar grumpy expressions when dealing with wizards.
Love kudos and comments on your thoughts about what you thought of the chapter, of what you want to see next stuff like that so leave those below as well ~Gives best puppy dog eyes possible~ please?
“A-Alright Harry,” Draco said his checks red, but Harry wasn’t sure from what. “As you’ve already said my name you are welcome to keep using it…”
“I am sorry Sir, Neit didn’t want to get in her cage,” Harry said, looking at Severus, “So it is alright if Levi comes to Hogwarts?”
It was just a few doors down from his own, he carefully slipped the door open before making his way to the slumbering man’s bed. Severus looked much younger when he was asleep, all the worry and anxiety seemed to melt away from his face; making him peaceful in his sleep.
His Uncle had enough of this crazy talk to pushed Harry against his cupboard door, fumbling around with both his and Harry’s pants. “Listen here you little freak there is no such thing as Magic!” Without warning he thrusted into Harry, Harry yet out of strangle scream as he felt himself be violated in such a way, of course this wasn’t the first time, but his uncle didn’t do this very often.
In all the road to recovery was going to take a long time for Harry, all the work from first year was just the beginning this tiny set back was just that. They are all willing to put work into healing one another and magic will happen.
“You promise to tell me what happens?” He asked the twins. The twins nodded, and opened a car where they spied a certain blonde haired boy.
“I-I can’t Alec,” Harry hid his face in Alec’s shoulder, “I-I just can’t, I can’t face their disappointment in me…” Harry said the last part softly into Alec’s shoulder.
“I’m sorry Papa, Tom for waking you up.” The boy broke the silence, feeling a little foolish about his reaction to his dream. He knew he needed to write it down in the journal that Alec left him; but in this moment, he needed the comfort that could only be found in his Papa’s arms.
“Well don’t just stand there you two! Come in and make yourself at home!” Gemma said with a smile. Draco and Harry quickly moved into the room, taking a seat near the fire place; letting the fire take the edge off the coldness of the dungeons.
“That will be indeed nice, Ragnok, if you will have us. I had not realized how much time had passed. If during this lunch, the papers for the vaults and such activities of young Mr. Potter’s estates are ready, I would like to look those over.”
Hello Lovelies! hope you guys a a wonderful two weeks, :) this is coming to an end here very soon. I only have like 1 maybe two chapters left after this, hope you guys are prepared for it! But there is a part two, I have no idea when I will post it, it most likely would be posted here in the next couple of months depending on how much I can write during the next few weeks. Thank you to my beta for looking over this you are the best :)
“Huh?” Harry said out loud, looking down at the large hissing snake, then up to the older Slytherin. Draco was covering his mouth to keep from laughing. “Oh I am sorry Gemma I should have told you, this is Levi. He is my familiar and he will help us sneak around the school.”
“Hey Potter, instead of a tux do we need to look for a dress instead?” Draco said while the maids and grooms’ men got together for their fitting.
“You will be fine, little one, but this is something you need to do. I will be out here waiting for you. You have nothing to fear, no one will be coming down here and I have Ragnok to keep me company.” I looked up at his silver eyes, pleading that he would not send me in there alone. I did not want to part from my mate after all that had happened today, the last few weeks really, but I knew he was right. He gave me a smile and gave me a soft kiss on the cheek before slowly letting me go.
Harry started to doze off at this point, of course he had grown up with no money so all this is new to him and he was unsure of what he is supposed to do. Of course he was not left alone in this, he had the Malfoy family helping, as well as Severus who will teach him everything that he needed to learn to properly function in the wizarding world. He was just thankful for that, but what about the other muggle born students. It seemed that magic just didn’t pop up in muggle families it came from somewhere in their family lines. It would also be the reason why so many other “muggle-born” students came through each year, but would that mean that they also have family lines that where not known of? Why has no one thought of this, or if they have, not helped them integrate into the wizarding world? It would mean that less is lost in the wizarding world, but at the same time new things are being brought in at a controlling way; instead of the pure blood looking down their noses, and the muggle born feel like they have to prove themselves.
Harry paused for a moment, he would do it, but he could no longer keep this a secret from Draco. Draco was a smart kid, and was worrying about him to; of course, Harry told him not to but he did so anyways. Then there was Gemma who was also on his case, she had backed off a little after the mind healers visit, but was still very much a mother hen.
“Harry, Draco, here are yours, please do not be late to any class or there will be consequences.” Severus said, looking between the two, “Other than that, keep your grades up, and if you ever have any trouble ask your fellow house members, or even the teacher of the subjects for pointers.”
“HUFFLEPUFF!” The hat shouted suddenly, and roars from the table was deafening. Many names where called, and many going to different houses.
Hello lovelies I hope you had an amazing month~ I am truly sorry for how long you wait through these the updates, but at this time I can only hope to do monthly updates; but you in for an amazing treat! Today's chapter is one of the longest I've personally written, while most of my chapters range for 1,000-2,000 words this is chapter is 4,094! So I hope you really like this chapter, it was just a treat to write and it flowed so well for me. I want to give a special thanks to amandadubose88 for being the beta for this chapter! She is so lovely to take the time to read over my work. Also thank you to you lovely readers for sticking by even when updates are slow <3
I let out a small whine and felt myself be dragged closer to Draco’s body; I buried my nose into his shirt to soak his scent up.
The Twins only smiled at their brother not fazed what he said. “Of course Percy dear, we wouldn’t want to cause any trouble what so ever for our perfect prefect brother.” The tins said in unison, laughing all the while. Harry couldn’t help the smile at the two, seeing the way they were so carefree. Percy only nodded then left the car to the four mumbling about going to the prefect car.
Harry gave them a small smile. “I-I’m fine, b-but I know even if I say that you still worry about me. S-So you might have noticed things have changed recently, a-and I would like to talk to you guys…somewhere a little more private than this.” Harry paused for a moment to cast a look around the room. Every Slytherin, even though they were not looking, were listening in to what was being said.
Harry thought to himself. “I-I’m just g-going to go the bed.” With that Harry gave Severus a soft good night, as the man did the same thing before resting his head against the pillow that night. He knew that he needed the answers, but unsure who to go to anymore. The young boy was confusing Severus, and it worried him greatly because Harry has never acted like this before with him. There was something that was bothering the boy, but Severus could do nothing until the boy came to him and asked for his help.
“I will see what she can do and I will send an owl right over with her answer.” Lucius said before taking a pinch of powder and stepping back into the floo. “Have a goodnight Severus, and I will owl you shortly.” With that the blonde was gone in a blaze of green fire, leaving Severus alone once again with his thoughts.
“Yes Aunt Petunia,” Harry replied, as he shuffled his way out of the cupboard and into the small kitchen, he got the skillet and started to make the bacon and eggs for the breakfast. He really did try his best I making the breakfast, making sure to cook everything the way his uncle liked it, as so he wouldn’t have to be burnt again by the scolding grease of the bacon. He shuddered as the memory resurface, of how the boiling hot grease was poured over his head when he didn’t let the bacon cook long enough, of how still to this day he could hardly see out of his left eye.
The rest of the class was peaceful, Ron was sulking through the class upset that he was picked on during the time, and knowing that he wasn’t the only one that didn’t read from the textbook just yet. Draco and Harry only snickered at the sulking Gryffindor and went about talking the notes from class to ready themselves from when brewing sections of the course. The first potion that they were tasked in making was a potion to cure boils. They had just started to separate into their different groups, the two odd ball Gryffindors sat with the first year Slytherins, with few strange looks cast, but they just shrugged it off when Draco and Harry started to talk with them. Half way through the brewing, Snape was just scowling over everyone’s shoulders, a few comments here and there about what they were doing wrong. Harry’s and Draco’s potions where looking just right, so was Hermione’s and Pansy’s, who had partner up with her. Neville was having a harder time and had a darker smoke color then what it was supposed to be, but it was still a good potion.
“I am sorry to interrupt you guys, I was wondering if you have seen a toad, Neville has lost his.” The girl said pointing to the boy, Neville.
Hello Lovelies and welcome to chapter 9 ^^ you are in for a real treat this time, it is a really long chapter a little shy of 3,500 words. Also thank you for all the views! I am in shock over 2,000 views! I am sooo happy that you are liking the story! Thanks once again to my amazing Beta! I do hope you are starting to feel better! <3
Harry was more than happy that he didn’t get in trouble for that incident, nor had been in trouble showing up late for McGonagall’s class; he was even more elated when he got the spell on his first try, while the rest of his class was struggling to even get done. The only others that were able to complete the spell were Draco and Hermione. Transfiguration was one of his favorite classes, followed by Charms it was interesting to say the least, to Harry, Herbology was another class he would have liked, sadly it brought back too many painful memories for him. He was happy the Neville found a class that he was able to excel at, when he seemed to have trouble in about every other class. History of Magic would have been very interesting, if the class was not taught by a ghost who seemed to be able to put everybody to sleep in the first minutes of class. Harry and Draco quickly learned that it was easier to learn everything from the book, than what Binns was mumbling about in front of the class. The last class he was looking forward to every much was Potions, not only was it taught by Severus, but also it reminded him of cooking. Even though he had been forced to cook for his family back home, Harry truly loved to cook when he was given the chance, and he had begun to miss it.
“I do Harry, I would never kid about this.” All Harry could do was nod at the older wizard for a few moments.
It had been a week now since the first visit with Alec, Alec had been coming around daily for the most part to talk to Harry and work with the linger issues that the Dursley left the young boy. As well as taking the time with Severus and Tom in talking with them, be it the best way how to help Harry during memory lapses, to what potions they needed to help Harry sleep. Since it was apparent the nightmares where going to be stick around for awhile even with the mind healing therapy Alec was doing with Harry.
“‘Ello Professor Snape, I didn’t recognize ya, and ‘hose this?” Hagrid asked, looking down at Harry.
Harry didn’t know how long he was out, he didn’t know if it was day or night, or if he was even dead when he came to. All he felt was the pain in his arse along with the burns that littered his skin. Harry didn’t want to move, for he knew that he would be in agony if he did. Breathing was hard enough for Harry without the pull of puss filled blisters that where upon his back, he rolled over on to his stomach to take the pressure off his backside, before yelping in pain as he felt a few of the blisters pop at the motion. He could do nothing as he felt the puss seep from the blisters, nor the way his arse felt torn and bleeding. He held back the tears biting his lip in pain not wanting to earn another beating for being too loud.
It had been a hard few weeks since the accident, after his Uncle was done with him that night they locked him away in his cupboard for the rest of week, giving him little water and no food. Of course this gave him time to heal from the gift his uncle bestowed upon him that night; even after he was a loud to leave the confidence of his cupboard he still felt pain rip through his lower back at some point in the day; Harry just learned to accept what pain was upon him and work through it. Harry knew that his “family” has not forgiven him for what happened at the zoo so he tried as much as possible to stay out of their sights as not to be caught doing something wrong, or messing up on something; but it seemed the more he tried to do this, the more that he was punished for random doings. He has collected more scares, bruises, scraps/scratches, and possible broken bones the last couple weeks then he ever had in his life. Harry really did try to be on his best behavior, he didn’t go out in search of the beating because he enjoyed them; he just wished that he had someone who would accept him the way he was. But it seemed like that would never happen in his life time.
It was now New Year’s Eve, and everyone was getting ready for the party that the Malfoy’s throw every year in celebrations. Harry knew that some of their friends from school would show up, since their parents and the Malfoy’s where good friends, but there were some other people that Harry has never heard of. This would be the first party that Harry would even attend, and he was very nervous about it, he was worried that he would mess up so how; and that Severus nor the Malfoy’s would like him anymore. It was at this point two red heads poked their noses into Draco’s room.
“I guess we are going to be parting ways. I hope this gives the information you need and I hope everything goes smoothly.” I got a hug from the twins before they were led back to the private rooms to talk with an account manager.
“No sweetie, I do not want you to go anywhere that Freak has been.” She said to her son. Harry sat in the back yard the sun already high in the sky, there was no source of shading in the backyard for him to escape so he was forced to endure the summer’s full heat.
“Neit, do you hate me that much?” Harry asked the small kitten, “You bit me and the look in your eyes says you fear me little one.” Harry’s voice was rough as his small chest heaved in gasps of air. The little black furball removed her teeth from her master’s hand, sadness washed over her blue eyes. She began licking the wound she inflicted, feeling bad, but her human need it. She looked up into Harry’s green eyes and gave a small mew before rubbing her face into his hand trying to show that she loved him very much. Harry gave a tight lipped smile to the small creature. It was hard to stay mad at her, she was just trying to cheer him up the only way she could. Harry picked Neit up and place her in his lap, “Thank you girl, I love you too.” Harry said in a low voice, softly petting the black kitten.
I nodded at what was said before picking up the Heir ring and placing it on my right ring finger. I felt the magic of the ring meet my magic almost like a tidal wave washing over me as the two collided. At first, I was stuck in this cold wet feeling before it went away, and the ring glowed and was warmer to the touch.
Harry couldn’t help the sigh that slipped past his lips, he was already tired at the attention that he was getting, and couldn’t wait till it died down. “Yes, I am.” He said curtly, “But please do not make a big deal out of it, I am Harry, just Harry.”
“What happened?” Gemma asked at the same time as Draco, but stayed seated, just turning a bit in her seat to get a better look at the younger snake.
Draco and Harry made there was down to Snape’s private chambers, of course Harry knew exactly where he was going, but this was Draco’s first time seeing his Uncle’s chambers.
Draco sighed, Harry had been gone for a while now, off looking for Hermione. It wasn’t that he was jealous, it just concerned him that Harry was alone. Of course he knew that Harry could take care of himself, but he liked to keep an eye out for him when he could. The feast was just winding down, all the students had enough to eat and where now just talking to one another, before being dismissed for the night, when the two large doors that lead into the hall burst opened. In runs professor Quirrell his robes flying out behind him, and it was a huge surprise that his turban didn’t come flying off with all his crazy movements.
The rest of the sorting was done and the headmaster stood up, “Welcome! He started, “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!” He said a twinkle in his eyes, “Thank you!”
“I-I-I can’t,” Harry whined softly, his nose running from crying. “P-P-Please don’t make me! I-I-I’m sorry, b-but I don’t want to remember.”
“Is that fluttering?” Draco asked in confusion. His question was answered once they reached the end of the passage way. It opened into a large chamber, lit with lights all around them, wings where fluttering around them lazily.
The train came to stop on a platform and all the students filed out, the first years stopping every few steps staring in awe at everything, even at the most mundane things.
Harry sated at that statement settle, “Alpha when you’re not in me please put the plug in, I want to fill you even when you’re not in me, please please alpha.” The omega begged wanting to keep his alpha seeds in him as long as possible. The Alpha just grunted but did not give an answer.
The Dark Lord froze, his mind did not think that far ahead, if what the boy said was right? Then things could start now, but the down side was that his vessel was not going to last that much longer. “
“Well that girl is going to be put in Ravenclaw, that’s for sure,” Draco said and Harry nodded in agreement; their car descended back into quietness, but both boys felt comfortable with it.
“Yes, Severus would like to add him to his lines both the Prince and Snape lines,” Lucius said, taking charge once again, as the other man checks over the younger wizard, making sure that he is sleeping peacefully, and that there were no after affects from the use of accidental magic.
Draco noticed my stare, “Harry, do you want to try some?” he asked, already lifting his fork towards my mouth, holding out one of the stranger fruits that was white with black speckles. Without thinking, I took what was offered into my mouth. There was an explosion of juice and flavor, it had a strange sweetness, but yet tartness to it and I couldn’t help the small moan that left my lips at the sensation it left in my mouth. I’d never tasted such a flavor in my life, it was just mouthwatering.
It was now Friday and Harry had gotten through the week having only gotten lost just once. Lucky, Filch, the caretaker of the castle, and his cat Mrs. Norris, who was a beautiful creature with beautiful sandy coat and gleaming yellow eyes, though she could never replace his lovely Neit, helped him.
Hello lovelies I do hope all of you are doing good :) here is a short chapter and I do apologize about that, I haven't been able to find myself to be able to type like I did at the starts of this journey, but fear not I am not leaving it! I am going to take a break for a couple weeks to let myself relax some and type away a few chapters. I do hope that when I come back that I would have a finish product! I would love to hear from you guys during this time on inputs on what you would like to happen in the story or tell me if you hate how its going even so I know what I should change. As always thanks goes to my beta for taking time out of their busy schedule to look over everything! I do hope that you all have a good time and see you guys in a couple weeks!
“I-If I would be so bold, you aren’t as alone as you might think. If you ever need anything Potter I am here for you.”
“Hermione,” Harry called out, knowing that she was likely only one in here. “’Mione, come out please.” Hermione just sniffled in her cubicle, not moving an inch.
“S-Sir,” Harry called out, alerting Severus, who showed up shortly after Harry stumbled out of the floo. Harry came to the conclusion that he was never going to get use to traveling by floo. Severus turned and look at the boy.
“Thank you for helping us and may your gold ever flow.” Lord Malfoy said before opening the door to allow the other man, burdened with a child in his arms make his way. The goblin just watched and once they were out of his sight he got to work building a case against the Headmaster of Hogwarts; yes even though the Lords and Heir did not ask of such help, the goblin nation took it upon themselves to bring down the blackness that is plaguing the wizarding world.
“Good evening sir,” Harry said, after looking at everything that the room had to offer, his eyes downcast still afraid to look at people after all the years that he had spent with his “family”. A hiss from the corner of the room had Harry turning his head in time to see Levi slithering into the room.
The first news is after talking to my lovely beta, we are both very busy with school work and not have enough free time on our hands, we have decided to post chapters very other week instead of every week. We would have continued on, but it is unfair to you guys, when I promised every week and I am not able to do so, so from now on expect chapters every other week.
I have no clue of how much time has passed, I had been pacing in front of the fire place for what seemed forever, before a healer came out of room. What scared me was some blood upon their clothes.
“This is Diagon Alley, the place where you will find everything you need for school, plus a little more. Now keep up Harry, we are going to Gringotts to get your money, as well as to meet up with the Malfoys.” Severus said, diving straight into the crowd of people, as they parted to make room for the gloomy looking wizard and the young boy that followed right on his tail.
Harry stood there, gasping at the largest pile of money he has ever seen, of course it was the only pile of money he has ever seen. Harry took a step into the large vault before turning to the goblin.
The Dark Lord just laughed, “Yes, that is what the Light wants you to be believe. I was there, yes, but I wasn’t the one that killed your family, no they were already dead.”
“I did sir, but I came back early with permission, so I am here to finish the rest of the Holiday here at Hogwarts.” Harry said, thought it would be better not to mention Severus or anything of the nature to anyone just yet.
“I don’t know sir,” The boy said, finally finding his voice instead of sitting there like a fish out of water, mouth open and gasping for air.
“Good evening Harry, Draco. I did not expect to see you two here this night,” Severus said. Draco looked over the back of the couch wide eyed, as if he had his hand stuck in a cookie jar, Harry, on the other hand, went ridged for a second all the hissing sounds stopped before Harry took a deep breath and slowly released it. Harry turned around his bright green eyes, so much like Lily’s, haunted still of past experience turned to look up at Snape, before giving a small smile.
“So, what happened? I mean why is h-he here? Are we still at Hogwarts?” Harry stuttered a little, his eyes quickly moving to Tom and back. He knew he was being a little rude, but he wanted answers.
Severus quickly helped Harry off the floor before taking him to a dark alley way and removed his wand from his robes. He tapped on the bricks in a certain order that Harry quickly forgot as soon as the bricks began to rearrange themselves. They opened into a path way to the hustle and bustle of a boisterous alley. Severus smiled down at the young boy, who stared in shock of the many people in one place, yelling and laughing at one another, kids running around with strange candies, asking the parents if they could have this and that.
“Yes, I would love to go with you, but after that I must find Draco, he is supposed to help me out, or at least that is what I was told before coming here.”
“What is this place?” Harry asked, his words almost lost in the crowed alley, as the young wizard pressed himself to Severus’s side, anxious about the noise and the people.
Harry also hung out with Severus a bit as well, the older man explained parts in his books that he didn’t understand, and also introduced him a couple teachers that stopped by during the week, dropping off various paper work. The first one as Professor McGonagall, she was an older women, she had her hair tied back in a tight bun upon her head, she also seemed very stern to Harry, but yet she was very polite. She told him that she taught Transfiguration, and that his father and mother were very good in the subject when she taught them. The other teacher Professor Flitwick, he was, well, he was very excited to meet Harry and explained that he was the instructor for Charms, and that if he ever had any problems that he could ask help from him or his house, Ravenclaw.
“Yes, we have been trying to contact Mr. Potter since he came to the age of eleven and visited here, but all the mail that we have sent we never get a reply.” Ullrig explained to the group with a frown, “It is about his inheritance, there are some payments that have been authorized by his magical guardian, which is quite a bit of money. Also I think congratulations are involved for going through with adoption Heir Potter.” The goblin gave the child a toothy grin, “It is not every day that something like that happens in our world.”
“Draco, can you tell me more about Hogwarts?” Harry asked, wanting to know what it would be like, for he hasn’t been able to even fathom such a place. Draco did try to explain what Hogwarts looked like and even some of the different ghosts, but Harry wanted to know more about the place that he was going to spend a lot of time at.
Saying once again thank you for everything and I love you guys! I will see you on the next adventure
The Dark Lord said, Levi just nodded his head and began hissing the tell of one Harry Potter's life before everything. For even though the snake had only been with him a short span of months, the boy had told him everything, and things he didn't tell Levi saw through his dreams, or through his incoherent mumbling. It had broken Levi apart that he could not have found his hatchling sooner, but at least now he could help him. He could stay be his side when he needed him the most and make sure that nothing will happen to him again.
Sooooo two months have gone by <3 and I very sorry lovelies. Life just got in the way, I was studying for finals and once I was done with the finals I was traveling all around unable to write or post. With the start of the next semester I was finally able to sit down and write out chapter 9. I really own a ton of thanks to amandadubose88 for reading over my work, even when she is sick, and also in all the support she has shown. So thank you sweetie ^.^ <3.
“How may we help you today?” The goblin’s voice was deep and stretchy sounding, making Harry flinch in fear.
“Now Severus I would do anything for you. You are, after all, like family to us.” The woman said with a smile, before a frown came over her face. “Of course I will do anything for a child as well, and when you showed him to me, I wanted nothing more than to offer my help. I saw something that I know I shouldn’t have when I entered his mind, things that children never should go through, Severus. I want you to promise me that you will do everything in your power to keep him from going back to those muggles.” Severus only agreed with Narcissa, but he knew that Dumbledore had other plans.
Gemma smiled and laughed at the younger wizard, seeing his plan even though he did not specifically say what it was. “Of course Harry I know a spell, and I can say that if you do, I will not get you in trouble, but you might want to run as fast as possible for breakfast.”
Harry grinned a little. “I would be elated if my sight could be restored, I have dealt with this for a few years, unable to see…” Harry didn’t care to elaborate at how he had lost his eyesight, but Severus got the idea, “and if you would allow me to visit of course.”
“These are our most precious vaults and very well protected. We sometimes let those gifted in curse breaking try to take on these vaults, but not once has someone broken through. They have been sealed from anyone and everyone but those from their blood or magic line,” Ragnok explained as he just smiled adoringly at the vaults. “The first 4 are those of the founders; Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Gryffindor. Then you have Pendragon’s as 5, 6 is an unknown family whose line has been forgotten, even Gringotts, as we have lost records. Then there is 7, Lord Merlin requested this vault to be saved for him and Lady Morgana, and the next mage will be allowed entry and accepted into the vault. That is you, young Lord Potter.”
“ewww!” Three voice said in unison before giggling and running away. I chuckled pulling back from my mate and looking into his green gemstone eyes. Yes this was my world and I would not change it for anything.
Draco smirked, knowing that his friend was getting tired of all the attention, but he was wondering why Harry was getting tired of it. It if it was him he would enjoy every second of it, but then again he didn’t grow up being a ghost, as Harry descried it.
“You mean to tell me that you can somehow communicate with this serpent?” Severus asked, lifting his thin eyebrow. The boy just nodded, ready for insults or even blows to come at him hunching more inward, refusing to look at the dark man. Severus sighed, knowing that he would not get much more from the boy as he had retreated back into his shell for the time being. As much as he was surprised by the fact that Harry was a Parselmouth, he didn’t let it show in case it scared Harry.
“Come on guys, we do not have enough time!” Draco snapped, after he finally managed to get his snickering under control. Gemma and Harry both nodded before making their way out of their common room. Following Levi instructions, the trio missed the two professors and Filch, who were patrolling the hallways checking to make sure that there were not children out after curfew. Once they made it to the door in the third floor corridor, Levi slid off Harry and down to the floor.
“Come on in Severus, the boy is awake if you would like to speak with him.” The woman waved him on in. Severus took a small step into the room to see the young boy that he rescued sitting up and smiling up at him, his green eyes shining with life.
Both Harry and Hermione just continued ignore the stares and the rumors of everything they knew what was true and not true and so did their friends. The media grew tired of their silence and moved on to other news. Hermione had been finishing up her degree at University in studies of Law, when she ran into an old schoolmate. She was very secretive to Harry about it, wanting to get to know the person first, Harry of course respected her discission and gave her the time she needed. It was two months into the almost daily meet ups the Hermione introduced him to her Beau. To say that he was shock would have been an understatement, but he was just as supportive since it is her life. It was Blaise from Slytherin he was a player back in Hogwarts, so of course being the supportive Brother Harry was he gave him the shovel talk; and of course, being on to surviving the killing curse twice does have a nice effect in scaring off any others that tried to play with her heart. But Blaise was different he was smitten with her and complimented her bookworm tendency and got her out of the house when she needed to destress from University. It became quick just how much they needed each other and how sickly in love they where with one another.
“Fred! George! I missed you!” Harry said hugging both of them, Harry hadn’t been given a chance to talk to the twins before the Christmas break, besides them telling them about the beast in the third floor. Everyone was busy with exams, or, in the twins case, they were busy pranking everybody.
“Harry!” The Dark Lord yelped, getting up from his seat to check up on the youth that had spilled out on the floor. Harry scrambled backwards and away from the man, not wanting to be too close, just in case. The Dark lord stop moving, “Oh Harry, there is nothing to be afraid of. I promise I am not going to hurt you,” the man kneeled on the floor showing his hands to the frightened youth, showing that he did not have a wand on him. As if he needed one, but the younger didn’t need to know that just yet. Harry eyed the open hands apprehensively, his body still tensed ready for anything but slowly unfolded himself. “I will explain everything, but why don’t you get back into bed? Severus would have my head if I let you stay on the floor a moment longer.”
Draco thought eyes widen in terror now turning to Pansy, seeing the girl in shock like most of the student body.
To say that he was mad was a lie, he was more curious of why the younger wizard had done something so peculiar.
Harry woke with a scream, tears glistening in his eyes, no, no his uncle was a monster but not that type of monster. His hands find their way to his hair gripping tight at the raven locks, as sobs ripped through his tiny body. He was too caught in fright that he did not notice that his door was flung open and two figures approached his bed. He felt hands on him and reacted.
Harry let out a moan, his everything hurt, not as bad as a trashing from Uncle Vernon, but everything felt like it had been dragged into different directions. He opened his eyes to a blinding light, making him instantly regret even trying, he tried to move and hide his head into the pillow that was underneath his head; but he ended up a whimpering mess as the muscles pulled and tighten.
The man narrowed his eyebrows in confusion, unsure of what the snake had meant, of course the boy had been through a lot, he had taken away his body, he had destroyed all his work in one night, so why should he give this snake and the boy a chance? But something was bothering him, was it what the young boy said to him, was it the way he acted around Severus, or was it the snake before him giving him a chance to make do of all the wrongs he had done in his life?
Professor Flitwick gave her a big smile and clapped his tiny hands together, “Way to go Miss Granger! Look here class this is the proper way to do the spell! 10 points to Gryffindor!”

“Did you place this on my bed?” Harry asked, holding the package out to Severus. Severus just raised an eyebrow and shook his head, placing the cup down on to the table. “If it wasn’t you, then who was it?” Harry asked, titling his head to one side like a dog would when thinking.
I could feel Draco’s veela purr, since I was acknowledging that he was the Dom in our relationship and that I have trust that he will put my finances in the right places.
like you could fit a house in there big - but really, it wasn’t a surprise. These are the original vaults, and only the most ancient of houses could have one of these vaults. The cart slowly came to a stop at the end of the line, one I thought I would never see, with how big Gringotts is. I looked over at Draco and he too was in shock with the vaults.
I have really missed writing for this fic this is my baby and what started me on HP fic writing and leaving it has hurt me alot. But I am hoping you guys can forgive me in this long wait.
Severus knew he would have to talk to Tom about this knowing the other man was just as scared taking Harry away from the manor as he was. But at the same time this was needed for Harry in the healing process.
“I noticed when we were in Diagon Alley, you always seemed to jump when something unknown passed on that side.” Harry sighed, and nodded in acceptance of what Severus said. “And two, tell you to come by my rooms tonight, Levi grew restless when he did not see you last night.”
“Milly!” Draco yelled causing the other boy to jump at the sudden volume, for a moment he thought that Draco was crazy just shouting a random name, for no reason. Before a loud crack entered a room and a scrawny thing with pointed ears appeared before him. Harry couldn’t stop the gasp that escaped his lips at the sight of the thing,
“Why don’t we go down together, since Harry needs to get some money?” Hagrid only nodded, Severus quickly took the Giants place in front of the teller, and waited for the goblin to speak first, seeing that he was a little peeved as it was.
Harry couldn’t keep the smile off his face at the hope of being able to restore his sight in his left eye. “Yes sir, thank you very much.” The boy said, but made no move to collect the potion afraid that this was all just a joke and that his professor will say that he can’t have it and walk out. Snape held the vile out to the boy, noting how cautiously he took it, then led him to the study where he could lie down after taking it. The boy was more than jubilant at the hopes of having his eyesight back, but quickly settled down for the long tasking hour.
“Severus, as much as I agree with you on that, you can’t,” Alec said looking at the man. “If the ministry found out what you did to muggles they will take Harry away from you and Place you in Azkaban. Would you want that? To have Harry placed in a different home; one that could be just as bad, or worse one where Dumbledore is keeper?”
The girl sighed and was about to turn around, but was half way out when her eyes widened. “I-I am sorry to be rude, but are you by chance Harry Potter?”

The next day Vernon had left for the day to go to work, and Dudley had summer school for failing a few subjects at school. Harry had hidden the letter inside an old tin box that held pen and pencils the “barrowed” from Dudley’s school supplies along with a scraps of parchment he was able to get.
“Alright sirs, it seems that everything is good, please follow Griphook here and he will take you to the vault in question.”
“Alright boys, one more stop, time to get your wands!” Narcissa said as she led the boys through the ally to the wand makers shop. The shop at this time was deserted and the old wand maker was nowhere to be seen until the door rang.
Severus nervously tapped his foot, Narcissa arrived over two hours ago and promptly went to work on the boy; locking Severus out of the room. Two hours have slowly ticked by and there hasn’t been a single sound from the room, and he was growing worried. Just as he was about to fight his way into the room a very worn out Narcissa opened the door.
Levi hissed angrily, curling his body around Harry to protect him from the vile man before him. Yes, Levi could tell who he was, and was not comfortable with that man being so close to his hatchling,
Last, but not least, Merlin’s ring. I felt the power of the ring from here, I was almost afraid to place it on my finger. I swallowed my fear and reached out to the ring. I shivered as I felt the powerful magic run through my body. Just from that, I was wondering how in the world Merlin’s ring would accept me, I am nowhere near as powerful nor am I deserving of this ring. I slowly slipped the ring on my finger; my vision danced as the magic invaded my body. For a moment, I thought I was sucked into the ring as I saw the starry magic invade my vision. I felt as if I was one with magic, things I should not have known were now in my head. It was like I was seeing magic herself. Then as sudden as it started, it ended, leaving my body exhausted and at the same time, empowered. I blinked a couple of times to clear my vision and I saw the Malfoys looking at me with great concern, while the Goblin was standing up at his desk observing the happenings. At first, I was disappointed, thinking the ring denied me, but as I reached for it, the room lit up from the burst of galaxy colours and the ring grew warm and tightened itself around my finger.
Harry wandered around Hogwarts lost, this was not his first Christmas spent alone if anyone was truly honest. The Dursleys would soon forget about him in his cupboard for the day to spend time together. So he was used to the loneliness it brought, but with the cold harsh winter snow falling, it seemed ever worse this year.
I do want to give a big shout out to at amandadubose88 for taking the time to read through this, they have been amazing friend of mine through the summer. So give them a big thanks and support if you please! Alright enough from me go read this long chapter I have for you guys!
Professor McGonagall stepped forward when the hat stilled, holding a long rolled of parchment. “Now when I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted.” She said before unrolling the large scroll and started to call names, “Abbott, Hannah!”
“I think that sounds like a wonderful idea!” Fred said smiling, before turning to Harry, “Would you like to come Harry?” Ron did a double take at Harry, and was about to open his mouth, but Harry beat him in speaking first.
Petunia had also gotten up from her chair, but only to pull at her husband’s arm begging him to leave them be, and let them go back to their date night. She wanted to forget that freak had existed, and that he never stayed with them. But Vernon wouldn’t have it, this boy had ruined his life and the lives of his wife and son, and he had the audacity to show his face here! He was going to teach this freak a lesson, one he would never forget; and the fact that the boy had gone white just made him smile even more. He was reaching for Harry when he felt a jab into his neck; he looked down and saw a piece of wood poking him. He was now as scared as Harry at the thought of magic.
Draco looked at me in surprise. I just smiled, “yes, back in our fourth year, when everyone stood against me, Nev was right there through the tough times. He was a god sent to me and we started to bond, but not like a lover’s bond, this was a brotherly type of bond, and by the end of year, with his Gran’s permission that is, we became blood brothers by a ritual.” I smiled at the memory of the ritual and becoming Nev’s brother, “It was a real surprise to both Nev and I when his Gran gave her permission to us to do such a thing. We were both worried that she would disinherit Nev for accepting a Half-Blood into his family, but she expressed great happiness that he was doing this and welcomed me into the family. The next time I saw her, she even smiled at us and gave us a hug, she then said to Nev, ‘your father and mother would be proud,’ it was then that Nev lost it, and hugged her back. I think Gran finally saw that Nev was nothing like his mother and father.” I explained to Draco my fond memory of my second family.
“I will give it, but I need an answer soon, my little spy. Harry, I will give you time as well, but I have a quest when you do.” The Dark Lord said, his voice soft echoing the room, as if he knew that was going to happen, but held hope that it didn’t.
“Yes alpha so full, but need you need you please please give me a pup!” Harry begged. Draco slowly lifted Harry off his cock and immediately slammed back into him setting a hard-fast pace that the omega was not ready for, Harry watched himself in the mirror. As Draco’s big cock slid in and out of him he looked like the slut Draco called him his eyes glazed with lust he had droll slowly dribbling down his chin from his open whore mouth that produced such needy moans.
The book seemed to be almost full now. Harry was living off only about five pages now, and his current writing seemed like it was going to take the rest of it up with how fast he was writing.
“Well it seems that you aren’t completely useless boy,” his uncle said, as soon as he said that the kitchen door swung open. “Dudley son!” His uncle’s face changed one from a pinched up snarl to a smile at the sight of his son. Of course it hurt Harry to see this, he wished that he had someone to look at him like that, someone who was proud of him just like how his uncle was proud of his son.
“Gods and goddess I am your vessel, please bring a blessing upon me and my family for the next year. Allow us to prosper and live, allow our magic to grow and love.” As he spoke these words he had cut across his palm of his hand allowing blood to drip into the hissing fire below, as soon as he had finished speaking the fire glowed as brighter wisps of silver shot up to Senior Malfoy’s hand. The adults and Draco followed him then it was Harry’s turn he took the knife from Draco shifting his body towards the fire.
“Try this one Mr. Potter, it is an eleven inch holly with a Phoenix Feather as its core.” Harry took the wand a little afraid that this would reject him as well, but felt a happy warm feeling fly across him, wind picking up around the store then quickly settled down.
