Everything had changed. There was no way Draco could leave now.  His mother was in danger. There was no safety, there was no hiding. They could only put their heads down and pray they wouldn’t be noticed.
“You see, he said that Cornelius was expressing doubts as to whether messing with the school to this level was a good idea, and those punishments...well. But of course Father had to try and convince him that what you were doing was right. But even father thinks those punishments were a little...outdated.”
Narcissa sobbed against her cold son’s shoulder, while he did nothing at all.
Yet, whilst it would have increased his survival chances greatly if he discarded the incredibly heavy form of Goyle to run more freely, Draco could not abandon his friend to death. He lost sight of the others and whimpered as the flames appeared in front of him.
There it is! Follow me on insta @annareliser01 if you want to know the minute it officially goes up or check back in like maybe a month or something? Not sure how long till I'll begin to upload it, I like to have a good grip on the plot before I upload anything.
Because- I’ve done some fucked up things so I
Draco swallowed his rebuke and tried to push back his exhaustion.
Draco expected Harry to rise to it, to yell at him, to frown and stalk away- as he
Potter speak to him like that. He was a lot of things but
“Schools back soon,” he said, interrupting whatever shit what coming out of Pansy’s mouth. She looked shocked. “It’s almost September” he continued, “are you excited for next year?”
“Yeah- me too” Blaise’s reply was understanding and just as quiet.
“Eh, about 50/50?” Theo shrugged, his normal grin at home on his face as Draco continued to cough.
He had had to live in the moment- he hadn’t allowed himself to think about the past at all.
He had not planned for this.
“is there anything Blaise and I could do to help?”
“I can see the way you’re thinking- and it doesn't lead anywhere useful.”
working with someone else on his desk.
Additionally, he filled his days with the practice of occlumency, wordless magic and recently, shifting the Imperius curse. Snape helped him with all three, giving him meditations and potions to help open and close his mind. Draco seemed to fail again and again but Snape would remind him that the power Draco had over his own mind was formidable, especially for someone his age. Snape wasn't the type to lie about such things so Draco felt somewhat comforted.
Blaise looked at him for a moment, then gave in “So we are using you showing me around as an excuse to butter up Umbridge?”
Draco shook his head, in just as much shock as Blaise.
After some time, he determined that there was no
They made their way into the great hall, Draco’s belly grumbled, he hadn't been eating that much lately, but suddenly he had an appetite. They made his way over to the Slytherin table where Pansy immediately made space for him and shot Blaise a dirty look. Blaise was forced to sit a couple of seats down from him as there wasn’t room. Why the hell would Pansy act like that? Draco had thought she liked Blaise.
Then suddenly there was light and

Nobody looked at him as he edged closer.
Next one should be up in maybe 2 weeks. Still have assignments to do and then Im going away for a weekend.
“We don’t have to pretend anymore remember? My dad knows” Draco explained.
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he asked. He saw the laughs turn into looks of anger and apprehension, they all looked at Potter.
Draco smirked and began to draw an enchanted sketch of what he dubbed as ‘Pathetic Potter’ to throw at him. Draco turned around, smiling when Potter scowled at his glowing badge. He was about to throw the sketch when a small boy burst into the classroom, puffing like he had run a race.
He finally rounded the corner and entered the courtyard, breathing in the fresh breeze. He stood there for a second, until a Ravenclaw pushed past him, muttering about blocking the walkway.
“You and I both know that this- us talking to each other... it’s odd. This is as strange as-" Harry paused, thinking, "No, this is probably the strangest thing I've ever experienced in my life. Yet despite that- I'm still talking to you- because you made a choice today, and it was the right one. And because of it I owe you my life. I have to honour that.” Draco finally summoned the courage to look at Harry. “You gave me your wand when you could have so easily left-"
“Fuck off!” He called after them... knowing they were right.
Draco grunted, then flicked his wand at the cupboard, summoning more of the ingredients he had just gotten.
They made their way to Madame Malkins, and Draco smiled as the rows of brightly coloured fabric and clothes that filled the windows took him back to his childhood when he and his mother had often gone robe shopping together, it was one of the passions they had shared as he had grown.
He decided to continue on his way to the library, and gathered all the books he needed. But before leaving he paused. Perhaps his father had been spying on him through the occlumency, despite him not sleeping. Maybe it had something to do with him being drunk.
Crabbe snarled then backed away a bit. "Your dad always told us you were just using us," Draco frowned at the mention of his father. "We never believed ‘im... but when you were so quick to discard us after you killed Dumbledore...well. Your dad wasn't so happy when he didn't have an inside source anymore."
He felt himself cry out
Draco’s breath left him. He leaned against a wall of stone for support. His mind was falling.
“Stupify!” She blocked it easily.
It was only after the waitress had left that Draco’s Mother broke the strained pretence of politeness “Draco, you didn’t have to be so rude.”
“Shit... I couldn’t think that entire time.” Blaise, looking exhausted, exhaled and placed a hand on his temple. “It was like
He looked over towards the Quidditch grounds, and at the stands which rose above the morning fog to barely brush the beams of sunlight which barely made it through the mountains and cloud. He missed playing Quidditch. It was unfair that just because they wanted to host the stupid tournament that they should ban quidditch and make the rest of them suffer. Hopefully, the first task would be held in the Quidditch pitch, which would mean they might get it back soon, as the first task was just a couple of days away...
(See the end of the chapter for
It dropped a letter to Blaise. What?
Here's Blaise! Hope you don't mind the American exchange thing. I just think it gives more of an interesting backstory. Hope you enjoyed! Please leave a comment if you did, telling me what I could have done better ect. Hm maybe I shoudld get a beta reader?
He closed his eyes, focusing on the feeling of
“Harry, no!” The Mudblood grabbed Potter’s arm and attempting to push it down by his side.
It was a brightly coloured book that read “
Finally, at the hospital wards doors, Snape spoke. “Draco, you must never forget to do the meditations,
Shortly after the call to assemble at Hogwarts had gone out, she had gone to find Draco so they might escape in the chaos- only to find her son missing.
do you think
Let me know!
“Wh…” She didn’t even manage to finish the word.
Draco opened his eyes. He was on the floor- but this time he was not shocked. He pulled himself off the cold flagstones, his mind in a protective blank state, and grabbed Blaise’s hand to drag him from the room- ignoring the pounding in his head from the occlumency. His Father’s scream of pain filled the room as they ran from it and he could hear more screams as he ran through the hallways to his room.
Shaking his head, he turned back to his marks, which were good enough. He would be dropping Care of Magical Creatures, so there was no need to feel disappointed about that- but the neatly written E placed so innocently next to ‘Defense Against the Dark Arts’ annoyed the shit out of him. He blamed Umbridge, for her incredibly inadequate lessons the previous year.
Why the heck wouldnt Voldemort send his best witch to do the dirty work- and why wouldn't she come herself to prove herself or some bullshit- I understand its probably because he doesn't expect them to succeed and doesn't want to sacrifice her- but Draco had pretty good odds with this one when he fixed the cabinet... right? Anyway, I just like her being there and think its more to her character to take crazy risks like that.
“How do you-”
He lost his mind in the action.
“Oh, well-” She had gone even redder. She needed time to process the information he had just given her. He didn’t give her that time.
Draco had his usual breakfast, tea and newspaper delivered to his rooms, and was halfway through his fruit salad when his attention was caught by the headline “
Ever since the incident with his father last holidays, Snape had been keeping close tabs on Draco and had been teaching him occlumency. Whilst Draco wasn't a fan of Snape always wanting to know what he was doing and how he was feeling, he did appreciate the lessons.
“Because it gives you protection from death.” Pansy had whispered it. All eyes swung to her. “When someone is killed, it’s not their body that is taken from them, it’s their soul. But if you have a part of it stored away…”

back into his mind, there might be disastrous consequences.
He looked up to find both Crabbe and Goyle pointing their wands at Harry again.
Potter raised an eyebrow, then his lips tilted into a taunting smile “You wish” he said back.
Draco realised Theo was drunk.
He slowly made his way downstairs, flinching anytime he had to open a door using his wand and therefore his hand. He snuck into the potions room, quietly tinkling through the bottles until he found a tendon healing tonic.
Eventually, they reached the corridor that led to the room of hidden things and Draco felt his body grow tight as he relived the few memories that were left in his mind after the obscurial left- of walking to and from the room. Taking the Death Eaters through the castle. Running away afterwards. Of what he had done.
Also am I droning on a bit with the story? My biggest problem when I first started writing was everything would go wayyyy to fast, so i put in filler stuff to build the relationships and make it feel more real. But now Im worries Im getting clogged down in it :l
Been a bit. And the worlds gone to shit.
“Do you think we should try and escape the castle?”
He wondered where he was. Mother had told him that Lucius had never even come to the battle. He hadn’t spoken to his Father since the day Potter had escaped.
“Sorry- you’ve found wha-”
So this year they had begun to create the fake memories in his mind. He gave her flowers, chocolates and (brief) kisses to convince his father that his gayness wasn't real anymore, that it had been a mistake. The next time Father looked into his mind he would see these memories. Draco hoped they would be enough.
He had come to the realisation that there was no such thing as blood purity and cried for nights on end, hating himself and everything he had become. The anger he had felt had been overpowering, and more than once he had found himself screaming and breaking things.
He kept to himself, and barely noted as the second task passed. The only thing he could remember from that day was that Potter had played the idiotic hero, as per usual.
“-You thought to trick me?!” Lucious went on as if Draco were not there, “You
“What about your father?” Snape raised his eyebrow, sensing the lie.
Draco could not miss the meaning behind the cold words.
“What?” The word came out harsher than Draco had intended.
Hello! Please leave comments and suggestions! No seriously, please leave a comment to make me feel as if I'm doing something because someone wants to read it?... Maybe a kudos? I dont know what the fuck I'm doing man.

“Yeah, I meant your grumbling. C’mon, answer my question.”
Draco nodded “Um, yeah. It’s very good for you. Blaise taught me. It helps me sleep too, I’m exhausted at the end of the day.”
that I’m not good.” He saw Harry’s face and glanced away.
Blaise just smiled at her.
his father could have used occlumency. It simply wasn’t possible. The distance and the fact that Draco had not been dreaming, so he would not have been vulnerable to infiltration. His hangover the next day had confirmed that. What then?
Draco sighed, knowing he had not been eating as much as he needed. He rarely looked in the mirror, but when he had seen himself this morning he realised he looked far too skinny.  “Yeah, um, I’ll have some porridge”
“You know I cannot tell you, so stop asking.” Snape hesitated, grunted and then sighed, put his feather back into its holder, then stiffly twined his fingers on the desk in front of himself and straightened. Draco had just watched him go through a moral dilemma.
Pansy paled, then quickly as a billywig she scrambled to grab a blanket off one of the chairs and threw it over Draco. He hissed in pain as she sat on his feet which hadn't quite fit. She hit his leg to shut him up.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes, “Merlin, you are such a loser”
“Getting some-”
Exams came and went, and Draco, despite not quite remembering most of them, figured he had done well. He always did.
A voice whispered to him.
Draco heard himself curse. He quickly put his Pansy memories at the forefront of his mind, and then began to clear his mind of emotions. He began to gather strength for a counterattack. His father paused at the memory of them dancing at the Yule Ball, “
“What?” Draco asked, concerned.
had nearly scratched his arm off.

He had done them every day once he realised the obscurus was growing in his mind again.
She found the wand, and just as she was pulling it back from him she heard his response.
The rest of the week passed slowly, especially since all of his friends had gone home for the break to their families. Draco wished he could do the same, but he was far too frightened. Thoughts of his father’s and his mother’s opinion of him filled his mind, and his nightmares, he felt as if he woke up every day in a haze.
"And what is all this noise about?" said Snape in his wonderful drawl. Everybody froze.
going back in. It was a sick, poisonous thing and Draco somehow knew if he did not act quickly it would devour him. It would
"Potter has another hour of Potions to complete, He will come upstairs when this class is finished."
Draco hated himself for ever being so stupid. But he couldn't help it. Potter had everything. Potter was the fucking Chosen One, and was kind, and didn't have a father that he both hated and simultaneously wanted to please. He knew how kind the Weasleys were to him. And Potter could have any girl, or guy for that matter, that he wanted. Draco felt sick with want and jealousy. He pushed it down.
Draco sniffed, slowly drawing himself out of the haze. He couldn't see any way to make it better so for now...just for now- he would play along.
Draco felt a smirk come onto his face and seized the opportunity. This would help him let off steam. He took the permit he had gotten from Umbridge out of his pocket and signalled to Pansy, “Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straight away, I went to ask her first thing this morning.” He said loudly. Pansy began to snigger and then grinned.
But he had found the mention of meditations on 'confronting your fears and other darknesses' in one of the occlumency books. He figured they were worth a try.
“Professor Umbridge” he drawled “How are you?”
And just like that, the mood was ruined. Draco had no hope of bringing up the issue he really wanted- no- needed to talk about.
As he was watching them all, he almost missed the skinny body that slipped out of the hall, not dressed in a dressing gown as most of the students were, but a weird sweater and torn pants that were made of an odd blue looking material.
Draco gritted his teeth. She was implying they hadn’t been working hard.
They would all die. Just as Crabbe had.
her like that?” Blaise was looking at him like he were crazy.
“I’m not a child anymore, I can order for myself for fu- -Merlin's sake.” He was not stupid enough to swear in front of his mother. But slip of the tongue had not escaped her. Her eyes narrowed at the hint of the word.
I view this as a depth of character and an obstacle to be overcome. If you have any thoughts on this please don't hesitate to message me anonymously (or not) on Tumblr at satan-incarnated.
like an Obscurius. But- No. It
“You shouldn't be here” Draco was panicking slightly. Harry went back to inspecting the photos. Draco's eyes went down to his ass. Fuck.
After telling the others to go, as he had to ‘check something’, he spun sharply and pointed his wand at the fool.
"It's seemed like months since I've last seen you…"
He looked up as the owls swooped in with the packages, expecting nothing from his Mother as he had already received his weekly fake check-in letter. He frowned and stabbed at a sausage. Then an owl landed on his table.
“Mixing implements and knives are there-” he pointed at the cupboard, “- and the ingredients are where I just came from.” He glanced up at the chalkboard, seeing that it was blank. “It’s not on the board yet, but today we are making the Draught of-”
"Finite" he muttered, dropping to the floor.
The night had arrived and Draco was wearing his Yule Ball suit again. He sat at the piano, playing through the program, trying to ignore the company and words surrounding him. Pansy stepped up for her scheduled solo piece and Draco decided to get some water for them both. On the way, he unfortunately ran into his father, who looked rather intimidating in his black robes.
was that about?” Draco asked as he grabbed Blaise a seat.
"He might be a hated Death Eater, but he's still a Death Eater," Goyle continued his reasoning "he wouldn't turn down a chance to get Potter whether we were there or not because he'd still get all the credit." The words were spoken with some venom.
They were quiet as Harry waited for Draco to reply, then evidently realised he wasn’t going to get one as he abruptly started to speak, clearly out of awkwardness.. “Uhh- So now that we’ve established that I owe you, I know how I can pay you back…?” Draco’s head snapped up, the tone of Harry’s voice had changed again. It was
.  He felt the anger in his chest rising again. He threw the paper to the ground in a fit of rage.
After a few quick scans of the various texts to refresh himself, he relaxed his mind through breathing exercises and then dove in.
Let's all say it together...
That was his mistake.
His father continued on, unaware of the waves of hatred coming from Draco.
Love Love Love!
playing at! Put me down!
Still breathing heavily, Harry continued explaining, “Anyway, yeah, it’s like my brain was falling from the sky, and it pulled the parachute- ah... the things muggles use to stop them from falling- so they just glide slowly to ground… they use them to kinda just float above the world…”
“Draco, she’s a teacher. No- she’s a high inquisitor, what of you had gone too far and fucked it up for yourself and the rest of the us?”
Eventually, an abandoned classroom gave Goyle and himself shelter. They somewhat closed the half broken door and it took Draco some time before he realised it was his Ancient Runes classroom. Ironically it was almost unrecognisable in its ruin.
They were nearing the Prefects carriage so Draco plastered a sneer on his face, opening the sliding door, preparing for the face that had been haunting half of his dreams in the holidays and found-
“Doesn't mean I know how to make it.” Blaise had a stupidly kind smile on his face.
“Well, could you?”
“I- I never raped Luna. I never abused her- never.”
Draco knew that Snape was distracted and took the opportunity. He had made himself out to be weak but now revealed the strength he had been building when he slammed against Snape and forced him out.
Amycus Carrow isn't happy about this when Draco says he doesn't like to share, they duel. Draco wins. Alecto warns Draco that her brother will not forget this.
The version I imagine Draco (eventually) playing of "The Heart Asks Pleasure First" is similar to that of Valentina Lisitsa. Its one of my most favourite piano pieces to play. (Fun Fact! I'm a musician!)
The movie tried to rectify that in a now-deleted scene when Malfoy tosses Harry his wand, which you can see here if you didn't know about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEywLcF16t8
Yeah so, I think that this was a mistake of the canon. There's no way that Narcissa, who only gave a shit about herself and her son wouldn't have taken his wand when she was wandless.
Umbridge paused, eyes flicking to Blaise, seeing him for the first time again, as she considered them both.
Hello there! Thanks for reading. Summary of this chapter is as follows;
support.” He put on his most charming smile.
“What’s the plan then?” It came from Goyle, ever the follower, to dumb to see there was no plan. They didn’t know their enemies' movements. Draco was about to tell him as much when they heard the door of the common room open, followed by the soft mutterings of someone.
just ahead." Draco sneered as he settled into the lie. "Perhaps you're blind as well as stupid." Before Crabbe could attack he raised his mother's wand, pointing it at the boys chin.
Well hasn't this been a ride?
Everybody but Draco laughed and Potters head snapped up. Immediately his eyes looked to Draco, who wasn’t laughing while the others were. Draco knew Potter thought he had told a joke about him. Draco inwardly groaned before he realised that this is what he promised himself he would do. He
Draco had to check these letters, because, upon his father's incarceration, he was now the head of house.
Goyle had left to try and escape. He had tried to get Draco to come with him, but Draco had mutely refused. He did not want to leave the safety of this room.
“What?”
He wandered out, the ingredients whizzing by him to find their place on his table, which was now accompanied by… Blaise.
Blaise looked perplexed and at Draco’s deepening frown Blaise rushed to explain “Just that my Mom’s living at your house at the moment, and in the holidays I will be too-”
As if called by his thoughts, Crabbe and Goyle burst through the door behind him. He could tell it was them by the oafy laughs and the loudness of their steps.
Anyway. Im really proud of the first chapter from the next bit which will be the next (and last) chapter so enjoy! and Ill see you in the next one!
He had thought he had been frightened before- well now… he was petrified.
Draco’s eyes immediately drifted from boredom and were drawn to the most out of place thing in the room.
“Yes sir.” Theo and Draco answered in unison. They looked at each other and grinned.
He knew where his Mother was hidden- the empty charms classroom- and he was sure she would be safe. So he had a little time. He kicked his feet at some rubble that blocked his path, and the scattering of the rocks created loud echoes that bounced off the stone walls.
“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” Draco said, going along with it. “I know how to get in.”
“I don't know”
He felt Voldemort’s anticipation of the oncoming violence as he withdrew from Draco’s mind.
Still not believing it- she reached up his shirt, feeling how warm he still was. Which made sense as he had only just died... but it was
The Professors lip curled at Draco’s cursing, but he made no move to reprimand Draco. He nodded, then flicked his wand at the door, opening it.
“Yes miss,” said Pansy, then snorted as she struggled to control herself. “Nope, sorry, I'm-- done now.” then let out a high pitched sigh as she sat down. Draco followed her, shaking his head but grinning anyway. Weasley looked ready to kill.
Draco and Blaise had gotten closer over the holidays, as Blaise was also living in the Malfoy manor now, due to his mother’s involvement. He didn’t seem to mind the death eaters being in the house, but kept Draco company as he was the only one of the same age around. It only made Dracl feel more confused about how he felt about the American.
He realised that it was futile-
Then he was coughing and retching, his body having automatically assumed the all-fours position.
he was dreaming about dancing with and kissing. He arrived early into the little village, feeling incredibly conflicted and decided to get a butterbeer while he waited.
Draco had experienced the flight or fight sensation before, but he experienced it in a new way as the hopelessness of the situation overwhelmed him to. He was wandless, and running from a curse that made him feel completely insignificant. His feet pelted underneath him and Goyle’s dead weight made his back hurt.
Lucius rocked back in his chair. He smiled coldly at Draco. “Very good”
“Father,” Draco called, remembering, but discarding Blaise’s worry. His father paused and turned, looking annoyed.
Draco shook Blaise's arm off him, “I know her type. She’s going to be cruel to anybody below her, just to prove she can, and I’m not going to be treated like shit. She doesn't see us as people, she sees us as students to control.” He continued walking to the hall, and Blaise scrambled to keep up “However-- she will snivel up to anyone
Unfortunately, once again it might be a bit until my next upload as there is quite a bit I have to write. :(
They raced down the hill and through the gardens, and Draco managed to overtake Blaise when the American yelped and slipped on the ice, having strayed from the path in order to take a shortcut.
Potters face changed once again, this time turning red accompanied by the expression of seething anger. Draco smiled.
He let his head fall to the table, the thump muted by the book on the desk.
The third task had finally arrived. The quidditch stands were full of fans holding various coloured banners and cheering for their chosen champion, the sounds of which mixed together in a cacophony of ear piercing cries. Draco had placed a silencing charm around himself and been in relative peace, only to get hit by Pansy when she had realised after five minutes of talking to him that he couldn't hear her. He was no longer allowed to use the charm.
Fuck.
Man, I forgot how happy this once made me before I let it stress me out. Ima be taking my time and not trying to stick to any sort of schedule so hopefully, I won't abandon this anytime soon.
to act like a dick.
His attention was captured by Harry again as he began walking backwards and forwards beside a now empty wall- a process that would look rather odd if one didn’t know that the pacing was the key to entering the room of hidden things. But why Potter was going back in when he had just exited, Draco could not figure out...
“How is school going dear?”
it. He began to breathe as Blaise taught him,
“She was getting out of control.”
“Potter came in here to get it,” snarled Draco, completely desperate, “so that must mean-”
“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Draco’s arm with a bit more trouble this time. “But if I can, I will- the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s the diff- ”
“Do you know why I’m here?” Draco didn't know, he told him so. Both their voices sounded odd.
Thanks so much for the great feedback on the last chapter! Loved it, made my week. :)
It had almost been an hour.
Going a little faster in pace here, going from the end of Christmas all the way to the beginning of the next chapter which shall be the Easter holidays, so be mindful of that.
"Want one, Granger?" he said, holding one out "I've got loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want a Mudblood sliming it up." Granger paled and her eyes narrowed to match Potter’s.
The towering darkness still grew, slowly becoming twisting smoke and flashing red light- a storm in Draco’s mind. Made of nothing but power. “
Draco froze. He had been struggling to breathe before but now he just stopped. Did Potter know? How did he know? Draco's heart was going a million times an hour and he felt like he was going to be sick when Potter frowned at him, obviously confused by his silence “Oh you’re so disgusted by my Bi-ness that you can't even manage a response. Is that fear in your eyes I see? I was joking Malfoy- as if I'd even consider hooking up with someone as disgusting as you.”
Draco nodded, laughing on the inside. Of
Much love :)
Draco had always known. They were not good people.
Dark magic, rarely spoken of... but that’s what our families specialize in.”
Blaise was gone when he emerged, and a piece of paper was sitting where he had been.
“You see, I just received a letter from my
which came from Blaise. Crabbe and Goyle were silent. Draco, smothered under the blanket, struggled not to groan.
. “He’s a family friend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.”
The thought of Potter being in love made Draco feel sick- but not in the way he expected. Jealousy.
“Oh” Draco felt stupid for a second, and then angry.
- and screamed again, then quickly separated the parts of his mind, isolating the anger.
secret. All of these fucking families have fortunes stored away. So pick the price, I’m happy to be accommodating.” The growl of Fenrir Greyback drifted out of the room.
“Don’t be so petty” he snapped at them, enjoying it as their eyes widened. They were stupid, but they held too much confidential information for him to discard them.
“But it’s not normal!” Out of the corner of his eye, Draco noticed his mother put up a privacy charm around them at his outburst, it didn’t stop him. “No-one's father at school practices legilimency on them when they misbehave! All I did was yell at him
I have lost no right and I refuse to let you ignore me as you have the last week!
person he had interacted with in a positive way- had been untainted by the mess that was the rest of Draco’s life. And that had somehow meant something.
The next chapter will be back at the normal pace, it was just important to get through a bit of time because I don't want to bore any of you.
“Hello Harry” It felt odd to call him Harry, but Harry had just used Dracos given name so he did the same.
“They’re called Thestrals. I can see them too.”
“Feel better?”
Voldemort was trying to get into his head.
Herbology: O
Then, as if things could not get any worse, Draco heard Crabbe utter some truly stupid words.

*****
Crabbe and Goyle made their way over, cracking their knuckles and grinning. They were fairly confident they were going to get the beater positions. Millicent Bulstrode was a contester for one of the beater positions but Draco thought that she wouldn't have the chemistry that the two boys did.
The presence tried to break the walls down and Draco was struggling to fight it. He had never experienced anything like it.
“Do you want your wand back? I’m working out. Uh- Exercising. It keeps my head in order.” The words tumbled from his mouth in a feeble attempt to fill in the awkwardness in the air. He swiped at the sweat dripping down his forehead as he said it.
As he crawled over to the waking form of Goyle, some distant part of him registered the fact that he had succeeded at stopping Crabbe and Goyle from killing Potter.
Draco yelped as his world turned upside down when he got launched off the broom from the impact from hitting the wall beyond the door.
“He got into my dreams”
Three minutes passed in painful silence.
He shook himself. Why was he wishing for someone who thought he was worth no more than the dirt on the bottom of his shoe. Fuck him.
They walked back in complete silence, each caught up in his own thoughts and fears.
Draco shrugged at Blaise and followed him, not surprised that his father had sent someone in his stead.
As soon as they had ordered the food Draco slipped out of the back door with the excuse of going to the toilet.
“What horse?” Crabbe and Goyle asked, also frowning. Blaise looked at them as if they might be mad, a look that they were currently also giving to Draco. “There's a skeletal horse, that’s black, that is pulling the carriage-” Blasie looked around “
Draco nearly dropped his fork in response.
Instagram: Ill let you know when I've uploaded there :) annarelise01
Draco began to pack his books away, mentally calculating when he would have time to complete the essay when his thoughts were interrupted by the loud swearing of the passing Weasley, “He's so fucking ridiculous, how does he expect us to write even one roll of parchment on Dittany, let alone bloody two!”
whether or not Potter would be coming here and why he would. They also mentioned something about Ravenclaw tower, but I didn't catch all of it.
“Well. I’m glad I’m not fucking crazy then” said Blaise who brought up the rear and slammed the door.
As a growl rose in Draco’s throat, several things all happened at once. Draco felt his anger well up inside him- fuelled by something dark and deep inside him, it leapt at the chance to finally do something violent and so he too leapt at Crabbe, grabbing at his shirt, his hand curving into a fist, readying for a punch. However, before he could go through with it, his body instinctively dodged when he caught some movement out of the corner of his eye. Granger had shot a stunner at them. She would have gotten Crabbe, but Draco had pulled him along with him when he dodged. Habit had made him save his old friend. The presence in him throbbed in displeasure.
Everything did seem a little muted. Colour, smells, sounds- All of them, somehow…
Draco laughed as they took off, the air beneath them and the sky theirs to claim. It was a good afternoon, and they both forgot most of their worries.
In response, Draco gave a sly smile to both Flitwick and Nott. “Accio Quill!” he said, putting all of his mental energy into the spell. The quill he had chosen from Flitwick’s desk separated itself from about five others and zoomed into Draco’s waiting hand.
Also can someone help me with the tags... like there is no rape, but it might trigger something in someone so I'd like to tag properly but I don't know what to tag...
They slowed as they reached Draco’s room.
“Merry Christmas Draco,” Goyle handed him his present, which turned out to be a new set of quills. He got a broom polishing kit from Crabbe and a very nice jacket from Pansy.
And look where that got me. I’m just shoved down here instead.
“Fuck
and forcing you to be self-detrimental. Trust me.” Blaise's hand was still on his shoulder, and it began rubbing in small circles.
The newcomer Blaise, however, had a different idea.
He spent the next half hour half attempting to study ancient history, then got annoyed at his inability to focus and changed into his working out clothes.
you knew it was me.”
Draco scolded himself for thinking about Potter. Why did he
Draco snorted “Well, this time he beat my mother too- while I
Father had access to.
The idea stuck and he couldn’t stop thinking about it...
He had swallowed and assumed the role of the faithful death eater. Determined to somehow stop them without openly giving away his position. He gripped his mother's wand in his sweaty hand, and struggled to control the shaking.
Harry seemed to be checking that Draco was on, so Draco began screaming, his smoke burned throat protesting. “The door, get to the door, the door!”
It couldn’t be him. Not Blaise… Theo then.
Snape was looking at him with a strange mix of pity and respect in his eyes. It didn’t sit well with Draco. He decided that now was the time to leave. “I have to get to bed, you know, long day…” Snape nodded, the look not leaving his eyes, and turned back to his bookshelves. “Goodnight Draco.”
Much Love!
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?” Everyone else in the class looked towards them
His mind stopped functioning, and he sunk to the floor sobbing.
“You're shaking...are you okay?”
“Maybe,” he said quietly, “the stupid great oaf's got himself badly injured.”
He tried to enjoy the picture... After all-
It was an old spell, and Draco had never dared use it. It was far too hard to control. Far too dark.
She had joined the fray and desperately searched- still wandless- but had not once seen her son.
Narcissa looked sharply at the boys “Put those away. If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.” Potter’s eyes switched from Draco to his mother
Let me know in the comments or the socials I listed! :)
He had been dreading this day. All of his friends were going home for the holidays, and he would not be joining them. Because of his father.
“Tell me, Potter,” Snape had lowered his voice now that he had the class's attention, “Can you read?”
. And no-one else would think otherwise.
Being proud of bullying a squib wasn’t something Draco could relate to anymore.
Draco's stomach dropped. He had seen his father's mark but it had always been a faded red, and most certainly had never
“Draco, wake up! It's Christmas!”
“Yeah, I’ll be fine.”
“Oh.”
“Aunt Bellatrix.”
“To the Mudblood as per usual I suppose?” his father sneered at him.
A spell that looked like a full Body-bind narrowly missed a distracted Crabbe. Draco was not surprised to find that Weasley had shot it. Granger would not have missed.
“Draco” said Snape, not even looking his way, “Explain.”
The fiendfyre- curse the thing- seemed to let him drag himself and Goyle up to the tip of the mountain of junk, trapping him in the middle of a sea of flames. It was playing with him.
But now he did.
Sure enough, once again all the eyes from the surrounding crowd were on them, and Draco found his eyes were once again looking for Potter.
Potter shot a stunning spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Draco’s wand out of his hand- causing it to roll out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes.
He sat down at a table, wanting to know as much as he could as soon as he could. He found the section on blood connections and began.
(See the end of the chapter for
The dining room settled under a deathly quiet. Draco didn’t dare to breathe.
Potter, who had friends he could lean upon and talk to in these terrible times, who actually had something worth fighting for.
“Really?” Potter took a step forward- getting too close to Mother, and Draco felt the anger rise within him as his protective instincts took over.
Draco sneered at him, and watched as he walked away, his friends by his side.
Blaise nodded, looking a bit empty.
Maybe it was just Draco who was different.
Draco watched as Crabbe and Goyle's dissolusion charms had wore off, their forms coming back into focus in his eyes - a very odd process - and so he too revealed himself. The more Potter saw, the better his chance.
Draco stilled, his pleasant mood soured. “Yeah, My Father’s like that sometimes…” he paused, seeing an opportunity. “Has she mentioned my Mother?”
“No, I have to get back to the hospital wing, I don’t really want to face Pomfrey if she finds me gone in the morning.”
After the situation had calmed down, and both Goyle and the Mudblood had gone to see Pomfrey, Potter and Weasley had received detentions and Draco was pleased to see Potter sitting alone with a stormy expression on his face.
Draco, still needing fresh air and not wanting to go back into the confines of the pub agreed to it, so they began to walk towards Goblin's lookout. As they walked, Draco explained the history of the 1612 goblin’s rebellion and how the lookout had been used as a vantage point to spot the enemy by Wizardkind.
His Mother froze, and she looked at Draco with fear in her eyes.
Hello there readers! I highly recommend you read this before continuing onwards.
"You act like you're better than us all the time but you’re not, Draco!" Crabbe said as he straightened himself, "You won't get the glory of getting Potter all for yourself. So stop trying to fuck with us!" Crabbe took out his wand.
Draco felt the anger bubbling up, but didn’t care enough to try to control it.
Draco nodded. It made sense. But it didn’t make him feel any better.
Then he opened the door, and the loud scraping sound it made caused him to jump.
He turned away and went back to his mother, their only means of escape now in Harry Potter’s hands.
“How has your occlumency practice been going?” Snape didn’t look up from the parchment he was marking.
A pause. “I feared your father’s response” She refused to meet his eyes and stopped to inspect another flower. This one was delicate looking and white. As she bought it to her nose he noticed her hand was shaking. “You are not the only one he peers into the mind of. I- I am able to fight back but sometimes he catches me off guard...”
“The Draught of Peace,' said Potter. You could hear the hatred in his tone, being tightly restrained.
His sight and focus narrowed, the presence inside him was now a seething mass.
onto his skin.
He didn't know how long he sat there but at some point a house elf appeared and vanished what was left of the vase, telling Draco dinner would be served in an hour.
Draco cut off his feeble words and turned away, unable to look Harry in the eyes, “
His Mother had gathered him up, and he could feel it, but he could not focus on her calming presence. The world seemed to be closing in on Draco, its entire weight focused on him and his chest. He couldn’t breathe,
the carriages. Look!” At their confused looks Blaise desperately looked around, then pointed “They see them!” He was referring to two people standing, near a carriage, looking up, as if at a horse. Draco realised it was Potter and some blonde girl. The girl reached a hand out to the air, as if she were petting a horse, then smiled at Potter and climbed into their carriage.
“Draco?” Pansy’s hand was on his shoulder again.
“Oh.” she regained her composure. “I didn’t know you... exercised.”
Draco felt the weight, the constant words that whispered in his mind, and his sour mood- disappear. He sighed, smiling.
Everyone is being told to be alert, to "keep an eye out for any unusual activities." We don't know what that means as the other students aren't at all predictable at all these days. So nothing and everything is unusual.
They had waited for so long- the hour had stretched on for an eternity- but eventually, the Potter boy came. He had walked rather calmly into the clearing, peaceful in the face of death.
Draco sighed then looked away. Trying to distract himself from thoughts of his father- and peacocks-
“Was it a lucid dream?”
Setting a smirk on his face, he leaned over Harry, his breath catching at the closeness. He forgot what he was doing for a second.
“Sure” he smiled.
Snape only gave him his signature raised eyebrow before gesturing towards the door, “Come, I will escort you to your dormitory.”
They trudged towards Hogsmeade, they hands clasped together. They hadn’t held hands much at all due to being at school, so when the opportunity presented itself, they took it, despite the risk. Draco knew they needed each others strength for the oncoming hell that would be the Malfoy Manor. He had told Blaise about Bellatrix's crimes, and Blaise in return had remarked that perhaps she was crazier than his mother.
He was surprised the front page wasn't filled with the usual hate piece on Dumbledore or Potter, but he read on all the same- only to find himself uninterested by the waffling of the reporter, and so he turned the page.
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing again.
It was the dead of night. Draco paced the small confinement of his room. Thinking. Always thinking. He was getting tired of the way his brain never stopped. This week he had been particularly bad as the final plans had been laid in place to crumble the ministry. He was incredibly ashamed that his father was so involved.
“Hmm-” his Father interrupted him again “Is that who has been teaching you occlumency? Snape? He was always rather good at it.”
“Good evening Draco”
“You are my son. But you are also your father's… you cannot blame me for-”
Attached was a card that read “
Breakfast the next day was appropriately served under a dark and gloomy sky, and as Draco poured himself tea he noticed that the Golden Trio were sitting alone. All their fellow Gryffindors had spaced themselves away from them, a display of just how badly the Prophet had influenced everybody. To have the other houses hate you was bad, Draco could understand that. But everyone in Potter’s
And the final clue- Draco closed his eyes in pain. Blaise had been one of the two only witnesses to Draco’s words on the night he had gotten drunk.
He was glad when their plates floated over, as it gave them something to do other than sit in silence, with so much sitting between them.
Happy reading!
Sorry to interrupt, but we've just been told that they are
Distantly he heard the cries of the crowd as they saw Harry’s body. Draco looked at it too. And from this short distance, he could see what Harry’s friends could not.
“He was threatening to tell the whole wizarding world-” He breathed in a shaky breath “-th-that my mother and I are here.”
“Copied it with a duplication charm. Filch didn’t even try to stop me- he's too scared of me.” She turned and grinned at him. She sounded proud.
“Yes. You will only write to me if you believe she is hiding anything from the ministry.” Lucius looked at him with a calculating eye and then dismissed him by looking back down at his work. “That is all.”
“Oh, an' here comes another one!” Draco was interrupted by Hagrid, who was now pointing to the trees, beaming. Draco felt his stomach come towards his mouth, the panic rising before... Nothing emerged.
and had been amazed at how clear his head felt during and after. Blaise himself was next to Draco, and was trying out for a chaser position.
“The morning mail, sir”
Yeah, thanks for sticking around if you have, I'm kind of convincing myself that no one likes this fic anymore hahaha- because its gone on for too long with no romance.
“Better,” She smiled “Much better. Now that Bella is here- and you too! It’s wonderful to have you home.”
Bellatrix was not the kindest witch, but she knew all about the Dark Arts and therefore, knew how to defend herself.
Theo talked over Pansy “It wouldn’t be something of monetary value- he’s never cared about money. So it would be of magical value- and not something he wanted to show off- something he wanted to keep safe and hidden. Hidden enough that he felt the need to kill any person who might have known what was stolen.”
watch it.” She sneered. “You should respect your elders, otherwise my friend Draco and I might have to put you on detention!” She said, pointing to her badge. The hufflepuff paled, before running back to his friends. Draco sighed.
They hadn’t succeeded in staying hidden, but they had somehow stopped themselves from getting killed. Creatures and men alike chased them, cornered them, and got distracted or killed by other, more dangerous predators.
“Must mean?” Crabbe turned on Draco with the vicious look on his face again. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You and your dad are finished!”
“I meant it though-” Pansy said as they walked up the seemingly endless staircases “Do you think Potter is in love with both of his weird friends?”
- to fight back... To end him.” He looked up and found Theo and Blaise’s eyes, seeing in there the same hope Draco felt and the shared recall of a conversation they had had long ago… about hating the position they found themselves in. About being brothers in their struggle.
But Potter had gotten his Horcrux.
him. He fled to the small corner of his mind full of the good memories and better Draco, which had strong enough walls that Draco knew it would provide safety he needed and barred the entry with everything he had. Outside of himself, a strangled scream escaped his mouth.
Draco frowned, disgusted “Mother... why are we still with him?” The angry words came out before he could stop them. His mother inhaled the scent of another flower, her hand still shaking and little blue lights rose from it in response to her touch. He could sense another prepared answer coming.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have been distant the last couple of lessons we have had at the Manor.” It wasn’t a question. He had been distant ever since Voldemort had returned, since his life had been totally
Draco wordlessly incendioed the paper, unwilling to let anyone know about his issues.
Snape addressed the class, “Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”
If you didn't let me know.
“Sounds good, where do I sign up?” Blaise didn’t actually sound that enthusiastic.
“You were already on the right track with the punching, you just need something soft that won’t hurt you hands.” Draco felt Blaise’s cool hand touch his own. Draco flinched, his hands still hurt as the potion hadn’t yet fully healed him.
Weasley turned a bright red.
“A Horcrux is a thing, like a physical object that- with a lot of Dark powerful magic- you can store a fragment of your soul in. It’s-
Turning red and looking around to see if anyone had seen, Draco made eye contact with Blaise, who had a small smile on those stupid lips. He had seen it Draco smiled back, turned to Goyle, desperate to look anywhere else. "So Goyle, tell me about your summer?"
He father frowned. “That’s impossible. I have him sworn under oath. He would risk death if he betrayed any of our secrets.” His father left.
Draco stared as Dumbledore rushed off, Draco having been forgotten by him. Something wasn't right. He could now see that Harry was sobbing and Cedric was still...
“Ron!” Harry bellowed, and Draco heard a distant scream.
Draco felt stiff as Granger went a little red, yet continued to answer every question adeptly, and he continued to make fun of her, hating everything he was forcing himself to be.
Draco felt the curse hit. He cried out and dropped his wand to the floor as pain shot down his arm.
A knock came on Draco's door, wrenching him from his thoughts. He found himself laying in bed, the headache from his excessive occlumency practice killing him. He could not be bothered to speak. He flicked his wand in the general direction of the door and chanted ‘Alohomora’ in his mind. He smiled as the door opened.
He followed Potter as he joined the crowd which began sweeping them both up the stairs. He seemed a bit plumper then when Draco had last seen him. As if he had been eating enough.
“He’s dead,” said Weasley harshly. But Draco had already known that. He felt tears well up in his eyes and felt his body curl up and he began rocking back and forward. Something about the movement soothed him and stopped him from screaming.
Well, there was no time like the present. It was time to get this woman under control.
Draco nodded curtly and began to wander slowly around the store when Borgin disappeared into the back of the store.
He immediately went to Snape’s office.
Draco gazed at the photo of the shopfront, his mind taken back to the memory of when he had bought his wand there, beaming as his father had praised him for the hawthorn wand, which typically went to witches and wizards of proven talent.
” The minister was corrupted by his Father, and as his father had appointed this ugly looking bitch, there was no way she was remotely good.
not stop. He ran through the empty halls, his pounding footsteps echoing off the walls of the vast corridors, his shadow reaching out ahead. He prayed he would reach her in time. He couldn't breathe but he forced his legs to move, fear for his mother motivating him.
All of this is great for my next work, as it gives me so many things to work with (you bet Harry is going to develop one from PTSD and who better to help him than a dude who actually knows whats up? oooweee)
Cedric was dead.
still.
Hagrid turned around, looking pleased with himself. “Now... put yer hands up, who can see 'em?” he looked around as Potter and Longbottom stuck their hands up. Blaise cautiously raised his too. “Yeah ... yeah, I knew you'd be able ter, Harry,” Hagrid looked sincere 'An' you too, Neville, eh? An...” Hagrid trailed off, obviously not knowing Blaise’s name. Theo slowly raised his hand, an uncomfortable expression on his face.
Draco snorted “You lost the right to talk to me some time ago.”
” He grunted then flicked his wand at the door, his heart still recovering from the ordeal. As it waddled in, he instructed the house elf to tell his mother they would have to go out to buy school supplies, and visit Borgin and Burkes. It was time to see the cabinet.
Draco had found he always felt worse if he didn’t start his day with a run. While all the days in Malfoy Manor were terrible, the worst ones were spent cooped up in his room, when the weather was too bad to run. Unfortunately, Draco often forgot how good running was for him, as waking up early wasn’t exactly his strong suit. So, to counter this, Blaise had stopped waiting for him and had started coming in before he was awake to force him to go running. Something which Draco both loved and hated him for.
Feeling sick, he realised he needed fresh air. He hurried out, cursing the long walk from the dungeons to the doors leading to the courtyard, as his chest got tighter and tighter.
Draco nodded once again.
Draco smirked 'I seem to have touched a nerve,” He had indeed “Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I'll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line.” Potter nearly turned white.
She had a smile on her face, and it was one that Draco once again recognised. A very cruel smile.
His own paragraph was still sitting on the page, alone.
. Harry smelled good- a lingering smell of the grass from the quidditch pitch, with a hint of an older, muskier smell that was like...- he snapped himself out of it and seized the largest bowtruckle.
No, this is not the end of the story- however, this is the end of this part of it. I am going to start a new work for the rest of this story, (of which you shall get a one chapter preview) so new readers who are looking for the sweet shit Drarry stuff can go straight there.
“...Was it really that funny?” Draco asked, and despite himself, he couldn’t stop a smile coming to his face.
Draco was quite confused. “So to clarify… Muggles go up into the sky in big flying metal busses,” Harry nodded, already grinning, “and
She leaned in closer and whispered as softly as she could. “

Potter. You don’t understand- I won’t deny that I’ve undergone a… change in perspective.” He could feel Potter’s eyes boreing into the back of his head. “But I never put myself in danger- I never put myself at risk like Snape did. I always hid and acted from the sidelines... So don’t- don’t compare me to him, because he
Draco moved out of the way as his house began to leave the hall. He saw, out of the corner of his eye- the
Draco glanced up at the giant in front of him and saw that his eyes were closed as he silently sobbed.

She nodded, looking relieved, then raised a shaking hand to his cheek. Gentle, and for the first time in far too long, without fear. “My boy, My darling boy…”
“They are difficult to control! If anything goes wrong, Thickness shall be the one to blame and I could lose vital control in the ministry.”
“Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.”
Draco tried to think like Potter “...He’s weak. The Dark Lord is
“Who said anything about yelling?” Draco pulled his arm from Blaise’s hand and walked away, Breathing deeply a few times and putting his mind into the familiar calculating state.
Draco heard his father’s voice next  “As much as I usually disagree with Yaxley, I cannot help but see the potential disaster the giants could create. Why not wait until we have a better grip on the ministry to campaign for their support?”
“Then why are we still
The first whistle for the Hogwarts express echoed shrilly across the platform, meaning the students could board the train. Pansy grabbed Draco's hand and began dragging him towards the Hogwarts Express. Draco broke the contact, disliking the feeling of her sweaty hand in his. She looked back, confused.
I need you to… how do I put this? ...Get on her good side when you are at school. She’s not only smart but resourceful, and managed to consolidate a lot of power while at the Ministry. And while I still have control of her while she remains there, I cannot know how she will react when faced with the unattended power she shall have at Hogwarts. Therefore, you must get in her good graces and keep an eye on her for me.
Draco sighed and turned back.
Deciding that being above ground was doing nothing for him, Draco calmly gathered his things and walked out of the library. He had barely made it to a small alcove before the tears came out. They spilled down his face, he didn't understand why he was so affected. Suddenly, he got mad. How
Draco pulled himself from his bed, groggy, yet knowing exactly what he had to do. He groaned as he looked down at his left arm, which was in a sling- It was going to make getting changed difficult.
“A vanishing cabinet-” Came Borgin’s voice from behind him. “Rare things, but the ones that do exist were used extensively in the war...Unfortunately, I’ve never been able to locate the sister cabinet of-”
“What prefers the dark?” Draco said sharply to Crabbe and Goyle- the last time he had been in the forest it had not been a fun time. “What did he say prefers the dark, did you hear?”
handsome. He sported a rather angular face and a decent build, his skin was dark and he was exceptionally neat looking. Draco liked him immediately. The boy looked away from the window, and Draco was caught staring at the face which raised an eyebrow and grinned slyly.
against his father, forcing him out. They struggled for a moment and Draco searched for extra strength. He found the memory of his mother crying in his arms and gathered the anger.
Draco paused, “You don’t know?”
Underneath the rather disturbing sounding headline was a rather disturbing looking woman. Her hair was curled in tight ringlets around her rather bulbous head, her face was pinched into a patronising smile and her eyes came out cold through the paper. He picked up the prophet, raising his eyebrow at the ugly woman who couldn't see him doing it. Of course, the Prophet was utter shit these days so he didn't really believe it when it cited this new inquisitor was “
His gaze was drawn to Hagrid, the largest figure there. And in his arms…
After what ended up being a brief meeting with McGonagall addressing their privileges and responsibilities, they were dismissed and told to go onto patrol. Pansy said she couldn't be bothered and retreated to the cabin. Draco was happy to have a bit of time alone, when he heard the grating voices of Crabbe and Goyle. “Draco, wait up! We want to come with you” Unseen, Draco raised his eyes to the roof.
Pansy spoke up, “In their beds I assume, it is quite late- but Professor, wha-”
Draco’s point was proved as the pair proceeded to dance in the most awkward way he had ever seen. He suppressed a smile. Potter looked adorable-
He had watched as media outlets nationwide had discredited everything Potter and Dumbledore had said, and watched as the Minister for Magic went bat-shit crazy in his attempt to consolidate power.
Oh well.
“What?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Her eyes brightened, she had come up with an idea. “I would like you both to gather some of the other reputable members of your house for my own,
“Potter and the Weasley twins! They got a lifetime ban from playing quidditch! Serves them right after what they did to you!”
But then, as he surveyed the crowd, his cocky attitude was frozen as he locked eyes with the red eyes of the Dark Lord, who was lazing in a throne-like chair across the room and was looking directly at him. And like a rabbit in the presence of a snake, Draco was unable to move.
An hour later he was at the piano, escaping, when there was a knock at his door.
, attempted underage magic...
His past self had found that out that little secret when he had been assaulted...by-
Voldemort's red eyes looking him up and down, scrutinising him. He didn't dare make eye contact, only focusing on his walls. His Mother came and took his arm. Her nails bit into his skin- a small distraction. The final defence in his mind clicked into place as Voldemort tilted his head, considering.
An ethereal light swelled at the tip of his wand, and from it burst a large stag- it had been the animal that had startled Draco before- but now it just cantered gently up to him, it's light as beautiful as its wielder.
“Just cause I’m Bi, Parkinson, doesn't mean I have threesomes with-”
“Just admiring the way your so-called
He stepped outside and met his father’s cold glare. He took his arm.
for him… Draco shivered at the memory.
He blinked again, “...Yeah. Fine.” He shook his head to clear it. “Did you guys hear about the massacre at Gringotts? He went there not even twenty minutes ago,”
He slipped his mind into the asshole part of him that he had long ago shoved in the back of his mind. Bringing it out felt disgusting. In his head chanted;
“You may rise.” Draco did so on shaky legs, hoping nobody could see that it were as if he were under a jelly legs jinx.
“The Sister cabinet.”
be one, he had not been suppressing his magic at all.
Let me know what you think about pacing, character development and plot! I'm still new to this haha
Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the mountain of objects beside him and he immediately tried to retrieve it. Draco, on the other hand, focused on getting out of the way of Granger’s second well-aimed stunner.
“Fenrir Greyback,” he said in a low and barely audible tone “I’m here to pick you up for your father.” He looked to Blaise, his gaze becoming amused “And you must be the boyfriend. Heard
He was not sure what he would do once he reached her, but he did not stop to think of that.
He smiled and applied some gel to his hair. After raising an eyebrow at himself he decided he looked better than good. He looked
He opened his eyes, lifting his head of the table and saw the words printed on the index page.
“Oh, well okay then.” Draco shrugged then began measuring the moonstone powder.
Crabbe and Goyle.
To make up for it I put up an extra long one :)
They began to approach the counter, only to be stopped by a heavy hand which fell on Draco’s shoulder.
“Then try again!”
“First year Slytherins! This way Please!” Pansy’s voice caught the attention of the nervous looking children who quickly flocked towards them.
While Draco had been wishing that someone would hit him in the fucking face, this wasn’t who he had had in mind. He mentally rebuked himself- he should have known Longbottom would react that way. Draco knew what had happened to his parents.
Draco started walking again, this time at a more determined pace.
Snape had also noticed Potter and Weasley’s cauldron and had made his way over, a smile on his face.
“Hello Pansy,” he said, smiling and hugging her back before detangling himself. He blinked as he saw the rest of his friends who all looked happy to see him and grinned as Theo gave him the finger in greeting.
Snape sighed in relief. The hand on his shoulder patted him. “Well done. That would have been incredibly difficult. You did well.”
Draco yelped as a large glowing animal whooshed past him. He shot up, wiping at his face as a voice called out “Whose there?!” -causing Draco’s heart to stop.
It gave him a good sense of confidence, and was the only thing that made him feel the tiniest bit in control.
“Pleasure” Draco felt a tad embarrassed at having been caught staring. Blaise, seemingly unconcerned, smiled at him and Draco felt a smile of his own appear. Suddenly he realised he was looking at Blaise’s smile and therefore his lips. They looked soft. Draco cleared his throat.
It was almost as if she were pretending that nothing ever happened. Did she not want it to exist? He knew that she loved him, but did she love that part of him too? Or was she just ignoring it?
him “I am weak after so long away, however I find your resistance strong. You will be a useful servant.” The Dark Lord looked to his mother, and saw the way she clutched at his arm. Draco almost wanted to step in front of her to shield her from the red gaze. The red eyes returned to him, a small smile was upon Voldemorts face, and he commanded attention as he rose from his seat “You will serve me, you will devote yourself to me and you will submit to me. Otherwise, you and your mother will die.” Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
He returned the look “You know we are being watched. I think it’s suspicious if you walk into that store.” He offered as an explanation. His Mother scoffed, an affronted look on her face.
“Uneventful” was all he said, hoping that would get the message across. He looked back down.
Potter had been laughing, and Draco could see the smile fading from his stupid face as he made eye contact. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had laughed like that.
“Oh Darling you look practically edible!” The words, which accompanied a squeal of delight were from Pansy, who didn't look too bad herself. She wore a dark green velvet dress which clung to her body and had black lace twining around her above the chest and down the arms. Noticing Draco looking she gave a sly smile and turned her back to him. The dress had an incredibly low cut and was held together with thin metal chains. As he got closer he realised there wasana enchanted metal snake slithering along them. Around her arms sat a black and grey fur stole, ready to be worn should they step outside.
“It's going well, I'm finding it easier to bury memories now.”
He had trapped himself in his own mind.
“No. Nothing else.”
“Well...go on then!” Squeaked Flitwick. While Theo showed his mastery of Accio and Depulso to Flitwick by summoning and dismissing a pillow, Draco looked around for a more difficult object to summon.
Draco couldn't believe his ears, or his eyes, as seconds later Potter’s firebolt came racing towards him, as he stood in the entrance to the arena. His feet were planted squarely as he pointed his wand at the sky. As he skillfully mounted the broom and took off, Draco finally became aware of the crowd that was roaring beside him. The dragon shot flames at Potter and Draco clenched his fists as Potter narrowly avoided them.
“Is that all Sir?”
Hogwarts was under siege. His second home was being
the ones in the wrong Mum? We always thought others were below us, but what if we are the ones who aren't worth a thing?”
” Draco didn’t know what the fuck he was doing…. this wasn’t a good idea. If Snape told his father that Draco was questioning everything, that might somehow get to Voldemort and he and mother could be killed and then he might be tortured and then-
He decided to refuse to feel anything and instead began digging his nails into his palms, looking for a way out of his thoughts.
“Oh Draco,” she said as she swept him into a tight hug. For a moment Draco felt better, as the familiar smell of his mother’s favourite perfume surrounded him.
his father manipulated people, and used people. He
Now was Draco’s chance.
He would have to leave Goyle behind.
"What the fuck are you talking about?!" Draco rubbed at his chest where Crabbe had pinned him, it hurt. He took his own wand out.
Hope you liked this chapter. The next one will be up sometime in the next week as I'm starting work again so I'm going to be a bit busier.
Harry nodded and they sped up, catching up to the others.
Draco felt the anger well up inside him and screamed, watching as the paper burst into flames. He hated his life.
Voldemort began to speak,
Draco could not get Potter’s face out of his head as he attempted to sleep that night after Snape had returned and released them, giving Draco a look as he did so. Draco had kept his walls strong, especially after feeling of a light touch on them. Snape could not see what he had just done.
Much love!!
He sat down between her and Theo, and reached for an apple. That would be all he could stomach this morning.
Draco was mutely wondering if he had become a ghost, when he felt a hand grab him.
He resolved to practice his occlumency that night.
“At once sir” the house elf totted out of the room and quietly shut the door behind itself.
“Shall I show you?” Harry asked. Draco froze, unsure.
Lucius stood up, seemingly finished with his meal. Draco noticed the sneer on his father's face too late.
Much Love!
Despite the empty room, Draco noticed Blaise casting a privacy charm as he took a seat after greeting all of them. After the smiles faded Draco realised how tense they all looked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco.” his father sounded a bit impatient. Draco steeled himself and quickly set his walls, he stepped out into the hallway, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, he would not be caught unprepared.
Draco waited for his friends to finish packing up and they left to go to the library for their usual Monday afternoon study session- which usually ended up being gossip sessions.
“Un-lucky,” said Crabbe, who stood beside Draco cracking his knuckles, “I would have liked to have a go at the fat one,” he said, referencing Longbottom. Goyle nodded beside him.
"Go on then Potter, Moody's not here to look after you now... do it, if you've got the guts."
“Want to go for a walk?” Blaise asked as they left the shop.
“I’m so sorry” She was holding him and sobbing. They stayed there for a while- wrapped in each other's arms for the second time that day, sickened and shocked by what they had been through.
The only solace he found was with the piano, and the escape it offered from his mind. He lost himself in his practice, to the point where his fingers and wrists would ache after each session.
Transfiguration: O
He felt a low sort of amusement from Voldemort, and while he was distracted, Draco nervously brought the memory of the dream Voldemort had invaded forth, which Draco had very carefully edited.
“And then,” She closed her eyes, her face holding a pained expression at the memories she was reliving. “He joined them
Snape looked up from a book as Draco entered. Immediately his face changed from unimpressed to horrified as Draco pulled his hood off and he registered Draco’s state. Draco was covered in colourful bruises from the beating.
And she did not.
“Hold it, Potter.” Draco blurted out. Goyle paused, his element of surprise gone.
He felt fear.
fucking good.
One was his Hogwarts letter, which he had been expecting- and the other was one of the ministry envelopes, which he was familiar enough with due to his father’s position.
They stood there for awhile longer and Draco breathed deep, enjoying the moment.
Right as they had exited the room. They had rounded the corner and watched as Harry and the other two had come out of the room of hidden things. His timing could not have been worse.
Draco walked into the great hall, chin high and shoulders straight. He had been too obvious the day before. He was
“Mmm- Yes.” Harry barely managed to get the word out before he burst out laughing, and strangely enough, Draco found himself joining in, because he couldn’t help it either.
A house elf bought lunch in for them.
“My Lord.” He didn’t mean to let the fear show in his voice, but he was betrayed by the slight tremble it held.
Draco had been up high enough on his broom to know what the muggles were after. It was a freeing feeling.
“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” He snarled.
“Yes, Father did mention he knew you, he's very excited to see just what you can do with the school.” He gestured to Blaise who stood awkwardly beside him. “This is Blaise, an American exchange student, I’m just helping him out by showing him to all his classes.” He paused and smiled at Blaise, then gestured back to Umbridge “But this is also a great opportunity to introduce you to one of the more
Umbridge was still standing, and let out a little cough to attract Dumbledore's attention. “Heh, hem” Draco frowned, he needed to know about quidditch. It had been over a year since he had played.
They went back to if as soon as Draco had put the last bite in his mouth.
They had followed all the students up to the entrance to the new exit, and Draco told Crabbe and Goyle that Potter was "just up ahead" the whole time.
“Ron, Harry, please don’t go down to their level,” The Mudblood grabbed Weasley’s sleeve and dragged him away, leaving Potter to remain glaring at Pansy, before his green eyes slid to Draco.
His father would pay. Eventually.
Blaise looked a little surprised. “Yes, but she’s only allowed one letter per week... something about security measures.”
As he slowly descended the stairs, his head pounding, he was relieved to find a cup of tea waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. He smiled thankfully at Pansy as he took the warm drink from her hands.
“I’ve bought you down here for a reason,” Draco turned to his father, who was casting a silencing charm on the chamber. Draco froze, knowing the panic would be showing in his eyes.
face, his
“Draco I- I- No…” She crumbled and Draco saw the resistance go out in her eyes. She leant out to hold herself on a small rock wall, and whispered the words “I- I can't leave him Draco. He has full control of the finances... even my Black inheritance...He controls me, has control of all of my friends through bribing their husbands- Without him we have-- we have and are
they leave their minds open to legilimency and call him. It's how we communicate with his so effectively over large distances." Draco nodded- he knew what happened when Death Eaters touched their Dark Marks.
Flitwick squeaked in surprise “Ah! And you have mastered summing one object from a group of similar objects! Fantastic, Mr Malfoy, that will be a further twenty points to Slytherin!”
I was listening to the wireless the other day and heard this song. I fell in love with it.
He was answered with a grin as they continued to run. Once they got going, the run around the gardens was the most peaceful time of Draco’s day, and this day was no exception. The soft smell of pine filled the air and the soft glow of the morning light glistened on the frost. The only interruptions to the peace were Draco’s and Blaise’s footsteps and heavy breathing.
"So has yours," he said irritably, looking Crabbe square in the face- seeing angry, cruel eyes.
Goyle looked at him. "Uh, I already did on the train"
Draco noticed a potions cabinet with bottles in it which he recognised were labelled in Snape’s hand. Draco didn’t know the effects of any of them but assumed the worst.
“I’ve heard you’ve been coming second to a mudblood.” Straight off the bat.
They told him of their plan to hang back and try to capture Potter, something he had felt his stomach clench at. They were stupid, but they could now do dissolusion charms and Potter wasn't expecting an attack. Plus, sometimes stupidity could be dangerous.
Also thanks to Blaise, he had gotten quite good at controlling his breathing and could use the technique Blaise had taught him to help distance the angry and emotional part of his mind from the rest of it, which lessened the frequency of his fits.
Defence Against the Dark Arts: E
Mother looked down at her Menu, her chin barely moving and her lips pursed. “I will have the Tebo salad and Draco can have the roast-”
“Why did you do it then? If you're a coward- why did you help me? Why did you give this up?” Harry’s voice was too soft.
“The Umbridge woman, the one on the front page. I have a task that pertains to her.”
I live in Australia and go to university and I'm four weeks in and the work has been piling up :))))
Draco looked around, hoping to spot the male parts of the trio, as he was surprised Weasley hadn’t taken Granger. He saw how he looked at her-
He was happy at the sudden lenience of his father these holidays, who hadn’t let Draco off the manor grounds the previous year and had only allowed Draco to go to Diagon Alley if he was present. Draco suspected it was because now that Balsie and Mrs Zabini were watching, Father feared their judgment. Draco quickly wrote a letter, duplicated it twice and sent one each to Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle and Theo, asking if they would like to meet.
Draco is a bit self hatey because he failed to put his life on the line, but he is alive, and undiscovered.
His mother was crying in earnest now and Draco found he was too, but her shaky words had awoken a fear in him.
Draco felt his own begin to beat faster.
He numbly watched as Crabbe stood up, his face twisting into that cruel pleasure. “It’s the Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”
“You.” He said, recognising her. Then, before she could blink his wand was pointed at her and she was on her knees. She let out a small shriek despite herself. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”
He wondered briefly how Luna was, if she had reunited with her father yet- and that made him think of his own Father.
towards him. It took effort, but he managed to use reducto to shrink the massive darkness into a quaffle sized ball, which pulsated in and out of itself.
Draco’s eyes snapped to his father who calmly took a sip of wine and continued to eat while both Draco and his mother froze.
Luna Lovegood is bought in to be tortured in the Christmas holidays by the Carrow Twins. Knowing she is an unimportant prisoner who is only there to force her father to co-operate, (ie, no one will look into her mind and see Draco helping her) Draco pretends he wishes to take her to his rooms so he can get her out and save her.
Something in him was horrified, but something else much darker was egging him on. He recoiled once he realised what it was.
“Tawkins!” He couldn’t stop himself from yelling, but he did restrain himself from hugging the bird, knowing he might get his face scratched off if he did. Usually, it was the Mother's bird that sent the fake letter, so this might actually be a letter from her.
“Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?”
“He's been spying on me hasn’t he? Been reporting to my father?”
The small boy shrunk under Snape's glare. "Sir- sir, Mr. Bagman wants him," he stuttered "All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs..."
He boarded the train, and a long breath came out. He had made it through the hell that had been the holidays. He was safe, away from any attacks on his mind, away from the screaming that he heard in the middle of the night sometimes when he forgot to put up silencing charms. Away from the horrid strangers in his life and
Theo spoke up. “Actually my dad would kill
His father came over, Draco scrambled for his wand but also prepared himself for the hit to come. It was a magical backhand across his face.
And so Draco was currently making his way to Borgin and Burkes, but kept glanced over his shoulder, as he could have sworn he heard multiple pairs of footsteps following him-  he looked again… but found nothing. He dismissed it, knowing he was probably being overly paranoid. It was probably just the echoes of his own feet.
this is so stupid…” He exhaled and then moved to touch the ball with his wand. “You have to behave- okay?”
“She doesn't have money, she doesn't have a family name, she only has her own resources. I put myself in a position of power above her, and despite that conflicting with her because I’m a fifteen year old boy-” Draco paused, admiring his own abilities for a second, “She ultimately realized there was someone with power over her and her most automatic response is to submit.”
Then came the hissing of the Dark Lord himself, Draco blanched, not having known He was there “Do not question me so boldly Yaxley.” A silence filled with anticipatory fear followed his words. “The enemy has already sent someone to persuade the giants. I have heard whispers from certain agents that they have already sent the half-giant fool Hagrid and Madame Maxime from Beauxbatons to talk to them. We have to act now, and we have to act quickly… Yaxely, you will be in charge of this” Draco heard a strangled cough coming from who he assumed was Yaxely. He knew enough from studying the Giant Wars in History of Magic that the massive beasts were very difficult to work with, and had alarmingly short attention spans and quick tempers, and were harder to subdue than dragons. Yaxely was right to be afraid.
work.”

Draco held his breath, checking every part of his defences. After a time it stopped. He opened his eyes to see The Dark Lord’s red eyes staring at- no-
“I hope Goyles okay,” said Crabbe, forcing Draco to stop thinking about Potters ass and realise he hadn't thought about Goyle’s face at all.
“How much fucking firewhisky is in this?” Draco coughed “For fucks sake!” His throat burned.
A week later Draco tells Luna about her Father sighting Harry Potter, Luna asks Draco to help free her. He says he can't because he is scared for his Mother's and his own life and he believes there is no point in fighting a war you have already lost. Luna convinces him that it is because good people like him stand by and do nothing that the wrong side gets to win.
Draco climbed into bed, mentally exhausted after the long day and the meeting with Snape. He had needed something to distract and calm him, so the shower he had was so hot it had left his skin red and raw. The pain had felt surprisingly good. Afterwards, he had felt like he could breathe again. He stripped down to his undies to sleep, enjoying the feeling of the cool sheets against his still warm skin. He began the meditations that would shield his mind in sleep. He would never forget those again. Seconds after he closed his eyes he was asleep.
He threw back the potion, gagging as it slithered down his throat, and then shuddering as the disgusting sensation of slugs writing under his skin occurred everywhere.
She drew back and held his face, inspecting it. “It's good to have you home darling. Come, give your things to the elves… You must be tired, but- perhaps you would like to go for a walk in the gardens later?”
“Yes.”
She looked at him, a tired and hopeless look in her eyes, and he found he immediately wanted to hug her.
While Draco was not exactly happy to be spending so much time her, he was grateful for the knowledge he had gained and the practice he was getting. While he wouldn't have the substantial amount of time Potter and his friends had to train, he did have an incredible teacher.
They sat there, staring at each other, until Draco broke the silence.
. He knew if Voldemort had wanted to, he could have searched Draco's mind, but Draco had played the worthless child well and hadn’t been of any interest to the Dark Lord. He felt some of the desperate fear that he had felt leave him.
The class with Grubbly-Plank began, and immediately Draco spotted the bowtruckles the Professor had bought with her. They were little, green, stick looking things that… he reached back in his mind for the answer.
“You mentioned you couldn’t cast a Patronus?”
Diagon Alley was practically deserted. The normally packed street that was usually filled with the colours of various people and their things was now empty and exposed to the elements- the empty cobblestone seeming completely wrong. The street was far too quiet, as not only were the people gone, but many of the shops too. Boards filled the windows of too many shopfronts, and the most prevalent sound was that the footsteps of the few couples that hurried along the street, dodging the eyes and attention of anyone they came across. Draco and his mother quickly became one of these couples as they made their way to the various stores still selling the supplies he would need for school.
Why hadn't he seen the signs? Why had he let someone he hadn't known get so close to him? Someone that he
And Voldemort would join the battle.
They returned at sunset, their face’s windburnt and plastered with laughs and smiles.
Then, in answer to his cries, came his savior. Draco opened his eyes just in time to watch as Potter shot out, through the storm of fire and smoke, the seeker now seeking him. One hand clutched the broom in front of him, the other reached for Draco.
Hello! Sorry its been a while, I had a music festival I was attending and had no laptop, plus when I got back I realised there were some plot inconsistencies ect.
” he heard Theo whisper just before he heard the sound of a door opening, then footsteps climbing stairs, and then suddenly-
Draco leaned in, shutting his eyes, as hope surged in him and he dared to enjoy the moment. He was too hot, yet warm in a different way as he smelt the scent-
Much love!
Draco turned back, fuming. He was being treated like a
He was threatening her of course, and she knew it. But people could only get pushed so far. The words he had not said were clear in both their minds.
"Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes then add... two drops of syrup of hellebore." The tenseness had drained out of his voice, replaced by dismay. He had realized his mistake.
develop a crush on him- Images of Draco’s father flashed through his mind and he frowned.
” Someone was shaking his shoulder. It as Pansy. “Are you okay?” Some  distant part of him registered the deep concern on her face and slammed against it’s walls trying to reach out. Draco frowned and shoved back against it.
Draco grinned back in response, relieved. “Nope”
“What exactly would this
his father had always said
“Don’t go there Draco,” Blaise shook his head and began walking away, his legs powering him up the hill. Draco would have followed him but had to get to Ancient Runes. He sighed, knowing Blaise would never open up to him, as he could never open up to Blaise.
As he slipped the three-piece suit on he knew immediately that he looked good. A glance in the mirror confirmed this. The suit fit him perfectly. The jacket was based on the military style with a gothic twist. It's high collar contained beautiful embroidery which fell all down its front and was accented with hints of green and silver. Everything else was black. Just the way he liked it. It was magically enchanted to be warmer than it should have been, considering it wasn't the bulky dress robes that usually would have kept him warm in the winter air.
Sometime later, snow began to fall, and Draco felt himself come back. He withdrew from the safe little space of nothingness in his mind. With it came the quiet realisations of lies he had shoved away long ago.
He shook himself and turned to Pansy, trying to get Potter out of his head “We should finish the badges tonight.”
“I don’t hate myself for it” Draco mumbled from his knees. “I hate myself for other shit. It’s a relief to feel something other than the shit in my head.” He felt like a child, hiding his head from the world as if that could fix everything.
Long boi before some shorter fast-paced chapters- should be able to get the up every day or so.
He knocked sharply on the door, immediately a high pitched “Come in” sounded from within. He pushed the door open and sauntered in.
At Draco’s lack of reply and stony face, he raised an eyebrow.
Dreadful (D)
Draco felt the already sick feeling in his stomach sink into absolute nausea. He had thought that at worst Potter might get a few
Draco felt sick. His father left him as Draco recovered and struggled not to vomit. He sighed- he was home...yet it didn’t feel like it.
His fathers magic grabbed his arm, and dragged him back. “Don’t you dare walk away from me you little-” His father exhaled. “I don’t have time for this. Come.” His father released him and turned away and gestured to the door next to him- the basement.
Draco sighed and spoke slowly to her, “Mother, be reasonable, this is dangerous, and you being there is dangerous too. They don’t see me as a threat. They are keeping an eye on you, and if you get involved in any of this-”
He was about to knock on his boyfriend's door, planning to tell him and seek his advice, when a voice sounded behind him.
“Enter” He called and distractedly waved his wand at the door, opening it.
Draco shrugged, “I don’t know anything, I’m not the most popular of the Death Eaters right at this second,” he shrugged awkwardly, “All I know is that back in the Manor...it’s-
“What the fuck Draco?” Draco raised an eyebrow in response.
let me know what ya think.
Father bought another

to play his part.
Draco had tried to stay hidden as the battle raged on around him and Goyle.
“Yes, I can,”  said Potter, the tenseness in his voice was growing
She, like the rest of the death eaters, held her breath up until the moment Voldemort let out a strangled cry and collapsed shortly after killing Potter.
He walked over to the giant christmas tree which brushed the top of the dungeon roof, its spines dressed in silver baubles and angel hair. Enchanted snow steadily fell and dusted the tree, as well as the presents below it. Greenish blue light from the lake and the lamps on the ceiling put everything in the traditional Slytherin green tones whilst sunlight came from the enchanted windows set at the very top of the walls and made the tree sparkle. It was beautiful.
“...We should show them to him tomorrow when we have potions, Snape shouldn’t mind too much...” Draco's own voice echoed through his head in the strange way any speech did when one experienced legilimency. He felt Snape's amusement, and then heard his mentor's voice also echo through his mind “Yes, I thought that was rather amusing-”
ha imagine if I ended it on the last chapter.
“What are you up to now Draco?” Theo asked, exasperated.
Pansy agreed, and soon their conversation was all about the coming year. He felt the anger slowly subside, he breathed deeply, thankful he hadn’t exploded at her.
She took a step back from him, and he felt himself panic- he was pushing her further away! “Mother, you have to believe me,” He could hear the whine in his voice, “I never touched her- we became close friends-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And that’s- how I felt. As if I were floating about the world, because I couldn’t think…I wasn’t- well- here. I was watching it all play out and I wasn’t there. I killed him but I swear I wasn’t there,” he breathed in, the sadness had returned to him, Draco felt it dampening his chest too. "That’s why I came out here. To test if I could still cast a Patronus. I just- feel so distant and empty... I was worried, y'know?” Harry had a distant look in his eyes, he was still experiencing it.
“Oh, yeah.” Draco sat up and rubbed at his sleep filled eyes, his mood now ruined.
” Draco felt his face heat.
Trigger Warning- Graphic depictions of physical abuse in this chapter
His Father continued “Regardless, I did not come down here just to lecture you- There have been a few Death Eaters staying here recently but- there will be more. If all goes well in the next couple of weeks- well... I cannot tell you, but the Dark Lord is planning something, and I am to be involved.” His father looked uncomfortable “But if all does not go well, you shall be the head of house. Until I am able to return. I will leave no power to your mother, as she has become too unstable-”
Potter had probably gotten an O.
Draco woke to something tickling his cheek “Meugh”
“And I’m not gay, you fucking idiot!” Weasley cut Potter off, his face now a bright scarlet which matched his horrid hair.
Love, Anna.
Draco stepped back, alarmed by the face on the boy. Weasley and Potter grabbed Longbottom and held him back while he desperately tried to get at Draco.
- he felt he forehead crease. He stood there, watching the people swirl around him, the colours and sounds so bright, yet so…
But Draco was prepared. He had not spent all his time burying everything important and creating fake memories for nothing. He had known this might happen.
So almost all of the stuff in this chapter is freshly written- hence why it's taken me a bit to upload.
Draco felt nothing
Hermione Granger had indeed transformed and he had to admit, she looked pretty good. She wore a blue dress, which seemed to float as she moved and he hair didn't resemble a birds nest for once. She was holding the arm of a very well dressed Viktor Krum, who’s normal frowning expression had changed to one of slight attentiveness. Draco frowned. Victor looked good. He had a contender for best dressed.
Draco probably could have refused on the grounds of studying for his OWLs, but he knew he had studied more than enough and he wanted to see his Mother, he was worried what the presence of Bellatrix had done to her. Blaise had also decided to come to support Draco and to see his mother.
No matter how many times he told himself that he knew kissing boys was a bad idea, the thought kept nagging at him.
Those bloody disgusting bastards. He... He became a death eater and
“Draco…”
He dismissed his feelings- no matter how good they felt- and focused on the
And suddenly he couldn't pretend anymore, and he needed his Mother to love him again. Luna was no longer there to keep him sane, “Mother, I’m not the monster you think I am.”
Draco felt his heart sink. He missed the pride his father had once felt for him. He missed looking up to his father in adoration and not in fear. The happy family no longer existed. He felt tears welling in his eyes. What did his Mother mean by sending this? Did she want it back as Draco did? Or was she reminding him of his failures? Of his faults?
He pulled back in as the team begun some drills. Crabbe and Goyle were happy to get the beater positions and boosted Draco’s good mood as the afternoon progressed.
She nodded and then crawled over to the body, her dress getting ruined on the way. But she did not care- she was just glad for an excuse to get to the wand.
Mother.
Pansy had some dumb moments.
Short chapter I know, sorry. But I felt it had to split there. :(
(See the end of the chapter for
When the attack was finally called off she joined the rest of the Death Eaters in the forbidden forest and he had not been there. She had begun to sob. Holding back screams of horror.
Harry was visibly pulled back into the present, his eyes snapping to Draco, obviously confused. “I never said that they were.”
“Will the champions please make their way to the dance floor.” McGonagall’s magically amplified voice rose above everybody else's.
“Are you excited for Christmas?” Blaise asked, and Draco rolled his eyes,
Life, for once, was a little simpler and easier.
Crabbes face fell a little, and he hovered awkwardly at the end of the bed. “I just came to wake you, because we are all going to leave soon- Pansy told me to come wake you…”
You have read the journey of my first fanfiction, you have seen me begin to understand character development, understand teasing out the plot- seen the absolute clusterfuck that was me figuring it all out by myself. So thanks for sticking around- (I see all you bookmarker and subsriptions!)

Where was Potter? Granger was of course expected, but

She would find Draco before the attack began.
“Oh come on, you had to have done something, surely?”
Draco stared at him, incredulous. He had just thrown away Draco saying the Death Eater were torturers, and his angry tone when mentioning The Dark Lord- But-
Blase cleared his throat “Ah, well, we should jog back… it’ll- ahm- keep us warm.” They jogged back in silence.

“Has backed off since the Dark Lord returned.” This much at least, was true.
“Draco , are you okay? You've been really distant la-”
By the time he had finished his fists were bloody. About twelve dents were scattered around the wall. He picked up his wand with his hand delicately. His breaths were deep and shaky, but at least he felt as if he could breathe again. Now that his rage was over he could feel the pain. He cast some quick healing spells before repairing the wall. His fists still hurt, he knew the damage was deeper than surface injury and beyond simple healing spells. He went and ruffled through his potion store and growled when he realised he didn’t have what he needed. He would need to go into his Father’s stash.
It was a long minute before Pansy replied.
Yet, a small part of Draco was thankful because he was on the winning side. Voldemort had once been unstoppable and would have won the war if not for the freak accident of Harry Potter. He would surely not make the same mistake again.
Draco mind was racing. “
“Maybe you will if you don't shut up,” Harry muttered quietly.
All right, all right, I know it's been a while, especially on that cliff hanger.
Despite his father thinking he knew and saw everything-- yet he did not. Draco sent a silent thanks to Merlin and breathed a sigh of relief.
“There are house elves, use them. Stay where you are.” His father interrupted him with a frown.
“Yes. I’m fine Pansy... thanks.” He pushed her hand away, but upon seeing her hurt expression, a small crack appeared in the wall and he withheld the harsh words he had been about to say. He found himself squeezing her hand. She squeezed back, and he forced himself to continue holding it. After a minute or two Pansy reached across and drew him into a long hug. He stiffened but then slowly relaxed into it… something about it felt…
They reached the top of the stairs, and Draco strode forward at a fast pace. “Well, my father asked me to get in her good graces, so I need to visit her before class and butter her up… and I have to have a viable excuse to do so. I’m going to use you.”
Crabbe wheeled around and desperately shot another killing curse at Weasley, who dived out of the way. While they did that, Granger finally took out Goyle, with her third well-aimed stunner.
Cruelly, soon after that, the universe granted his wish. The sounds of battle stopped as a cold, clear voice pierced the air for the second time that night.
Theo made a face. “Oh here and there. I wasn’t going to come but
A hand clamped down on his shoulder, he whirled around to find--
Huffing, he stalked over to his shelf to get a book to calm himself, and noticed a change of decoration.
I know its not very nice that Draco still feels love for his father, however its quite common that victims of abuse, especially those that are victims of their parents, still feel attached.
Crabbe had raised his wand too, so Draco continued speaking. “That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” he pointed his Mother’s through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle, getting ready to cast a shield charm. But still he held his cover, hoping Granger and Weasley would come from wherever they had fucked off to so he wouldn't have to give himself away.
As usual, Draco’s stomach immediately began twisting up upon himself. His Mother had gotten up late to send the owl. He had been stupid not to do the same. His father probably had someone watching the house for owls... he should have seen it coming.
Pansy shrugged “Yeah but I meant before-”
Whilst continuing to pace and realised he wanted to go for a walk again, but it was dark and he wasn’t allowed out of the school. Additionally, he had begun to worry more about his mother. It had been two weeks and he hadn’t received a single letter from her. He had sent her his weekly letter, yet had received no reply. Had something happened to her? Was she okay? The thoughts had begun to dominate his head. He needed someway to release his energy. He hit his pillow but it was too soft and didn’t offer up enough resistance. He glanced around for something better.
Fenrir Greyback looked up, a sinister smile on his face.
No one would ever ‘grab’ Harry Potter. They loved him- he was their hero. Their saviour.
Blaise paused then a small smile crept onto his face “What if I promise not to tell anybody?” He was smiling in the most appealing way and Draco desperately wanted to open up.
He felt great.
His tournament training had obviously benefited him physically and in addition to that, his normally messy hair was slicked back from his face. Draco found himself thinking the messier hair suited him better. More...Potter-ish.
Narcissa remained quiet for a short time. Seemingly thinking about what she was about to say.
“Oh Draco, this will go perfectly with my dress tonight! Thank you darling!” she stepped up to him and they quickly kissed. Pansy looked at him with adoring eyes, they both had agreed this was good for the fake memories. He made sure to cement the memory in his mind so it would be the first his father would find. Everybody, including Crabbe and Goyle, thought he and Pansy were dating, so nobody batted an eye. They then proceeded to cuddle on the couch as Draco opened the pile of presents from his parents and other relatives.
are fat.”
this woman. Despite wearing copious amounts of pink, and using fluffy words, this woman was just as vile as any of the ‘guests’ in his home.
After Umbridge had sufficiently embarrassed and flustered Hagrid, they began the walk back towards the castle, and Draco couldn’t help himself “Who have you seen die?” Blaise looked at him coldly, while Theo gave him a side glance. Draco regretted asking the question immediately.
He frowned and continued the few metres to the dark corners of the alley which were home to Borgin and Bourkes.
Draco shrugged “I have no idea what you talking about…” He glanced at Blaise, who had gotten two more bites in and was now onto his third. “...But I think I’ve let him eat for long enough, don’t you think?”
“He’s coming!” whispered Pansy as they waited outside the potions classroom- and indeed he was. Once again, Potter was walking solemnly behind the Weasel and the Mudblood, his head hanging low and he shoulders slumped. What a pathetic sight.
Something had awoken in Draco.
I present to you, the Drarry we have all been waiting for.
“Umbridge even took away his broom!” Pansy beamed at him, clearly thinking Christmas had come early. Draco attempted a smile back, then pushed his food away, not able to maintain the pretence of eating anymore.
Theo barked out a laugh, then said, “If your going to use me as an excuse to not look at Blaise after that little
She continued her speech, saying things like “progress for progress's sake must be discouraged” and “pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited” which sounded a lot like the kinds of words that had been said by the death eaters at his home- They just sounded a little more refined than “purging of the muggles and mudbloods from our society”
“Wha-”
Blaise came out of his beautiful sun appreciating session launched into answering Draco’s question, his face lighting up at the memories he was obviously experiencing. This was worse. Draco now had an excuse to stare at his lips.
be controlled, especially not by something within himself. As he screamed, he tried to push the anger into the box it usually resided in, where it could be controlled. It would not go.
Draco smiled “Sometimes I wish I was one… I could just not give a shit about anything and just burn everything in my way.”
He frowned and shoved the feeling back down in his stomach where it had come from.
"Perhaps you could fuck us up with your wand," Crabbe smiled cruelly at him. "But maybe not with
“You think I would just forget the shame you have brought to this family?”
“Woah, Woah!” Cool hands wrapped around his wrists, stopping them and he looked up with crazed eyes to find Blaise holding them. He hadn’t noticed the boy come in due to his rage.
Draco turned, just like everybody else, to watch as the champions make their way through the crowd. But his eyes were drawn to one boy in particular. He watched as the now scared looking Potter was dragged by the one of the Patils to the floor where they stood stiff and still.
have the
“Yes, it faded," his tone dripped with sarcasm, "that's why it's still on my arm.”
Socials-
“Oh please-” Draco started.
A few minutes later Blaise stepped back from the mock dummy he had made from pillows and blankets, bound together with magic and levitating off the floor. He beckoned Draco over “Hit it.”
As Draco got ready for bed that night, he finally let in the thoughts that he had repressed all afternoon. He knew these feelings. He had felt them around Cassius two years ago when times were simpler. And his father had found the memory, and everything in his perfect life had gone to shit. Draco sighed, not knowing whether he should throw caution to the wind, or lock himself away from anything enjoyable.
fear at the prospect.
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly, and Draco clutched his wand tighter, the only thing stopping him was the knowledge of what would happen it
Underneath the tree, the massive pile of presents spread quite far, with narrow paths leading to the centre. Pureblood families tended to spoil their children, and as many had returned for the Yule ball, they would receive their gifts at Hogwarts.
He opened his eyes to stare directly at Fenrir who was staring at him hungrily.
After clearing a spot on the dirty ground, he sat down and upon doing so realised how exhausted he was. His whole body ached from burns, scrapes and a constant headache. Running for his life for the last hour or two had distracted him, but now the fatigue from such an extreme emotion threatened to overwhelm him. Despite some part of him knowing he should stay alert, he just wanted to lay down.
“You gave me your wand. That seemed pretty courageous...and useful.”
peacocks.
Back to the task at hand.
bitten him as a child when he was playing too close to one of the females as a child.
But, true to character, Father had forbidden that, as he had been incredibly angry and refused Draco any comforts. Draco secretly suspected that Father was afraid Mother would support him and that was why they had no contact. He hadn’t even allowed Mother to come to King’s Cross station to say goodbye.
young”
“Well-- Better... much better” Draco blushed, “I’ve been meaning to thank you for your advice...I’m finding it easier to control myself”
He tried to ignore the voice in his head.
“You think that’s snow?”
Draco- still putting up a facade as a monster as Ollivander is in the dungeon (He fears Ollivander may unwillingly betray him if Voldemort looks into his mind) he takes Luna to his rooms. She then proceeds to attack him until he convinces her that he is trying to help her.
As a thankyou, I've given quite a long chapter, but it comes at a price. I have nothing written in reserve. I know where I want the story to go, but up until this point I was editing and adding to stuff I had already written. This means its going to take me a bit longer to put out chapters from now on- sorry!
Potter had evidently tried to move, because instead of freezing on the rack, his frozen body tumbled down and hit the ground. Hard.
It didn’t matter-
When Draco made eye contact with the painting, Septimus made a face of disgust and exited his portrait.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Blaise began to pile food onto Draco’s plate. “You have to eat Draco, we talked about this.”
Potter stared out of the page at him. His eyes hollow and exhausted. Miserable.
He turned to the right page and began reading.
A while later he stopped, puffing and sweating.
After making sure he was okay and getting him some of his occlumency medicine, Pansy left to get them dinner from the house elves. Soon she had returned and was questioning him. He described what had happened, and she was shocked. “It only lasted for like, a second” she informed him, “You went up to him, he spoke to you and stood up, then you stepped back and fell to the floor. Then he told you to leave. That was all”
When they were nearly at the great hall, Blaise grabbed him and pulled him to the side of the corridor.
But then, after much frantic searching- she had not. And her panic had begun to rise.
had gotten.
“Of course not, Mr Malfoy, if you could provide evidence that it is the sister I would be more than happy to buy it off you for a considerable fee…”
“Get dressed,” said Blaise, smirking and throwing some shorts at his face.
Draco froze. For a second, his head struggled to catch up with what he already knew what his father was alluding to. Everything stopped, his stomach and chest began to riot.
“Come in,” Snape’s response came from behind the thick door and Draco shouldered it open. He looked around the office for the second time that day.
“No,” said Harry, more loudly, but his voice was void of emotion “I forgot the hellebore.”
“Draco...perhaps we should go get some robes fitted- like we used to...” His Mother looked around, sharing the same look of sorrow that Draco had in his eyes. He nodded- they both needed something to remind them of when times were better.
“You escape death…” Blaise trailed off, then whispered under his breath. “
. He’s vulnerable. Potter is probably coming back here to gather what people he can- maybe reassembling his... What did they call themselves?
depend on it.
Bright sunlight came through the windows, shining down and beautifully lighting one of the darkest witches in existence.
“Someone in my dream did.”
Draco heard some more weak protests from Pansy, and the heavy footsteps of Slughorn moving away from them.
Draco’s sneer deepened into a frown. He snatched the cup from her and drained it.
He sent Tawkins off and ten minutes later they were all stepping into the fireplace, and out into the Leaky Cauldron.
Draco stood up, turning away from Harry and pretending to be interested in a small patch of burnt grass, “You’ve forgotten yourself, Potter. I am not good- and you don’t think I am good.” Harry was silent behind him, “I don’t have the ability to just come out here and check if my head is screwed on with a Patronus because I
He gave his hand. His Father placed his wand onto Draco’s wrist “Do it!”
Draco had a smile of his own... He was actually enjoying this.
Harry went to respond, obviously with something smart- but then saw Draco smiling, “Um- ah… Yeah,” He ran his hand through his hair “I mean, no. But just- well everybody’s been treating me like a bloody god for the last hour… even Ginny- and I just came out here to get away from it and I find you here and then you treated me like you always have and I guess it’s just…” He finally paused for a breath. “Refreshing.” He glanced up at Draco, and his face went even redder before he looked away.
Soon the conversation moved to other things, Pansy complimenting his playing and expressing her joy at how well the night had gone up until his encounter. Draco thanked her and informed her he never wanted to be within a foot of the Dark Lord ever again. She laughed at that, but said he was lucky to have even spoken with the Dark Lord. She began to talk about the importance of this moment in time, how soon the muggles would soon be put in their rightful place and- Draco felt his mask slide up, he felt his head nodding and his lips smiling. He felt disgusted. He felt it rising in his chest again.
Well hi. Things are moving kinda fast now aren't they? We just finished fourth year. Please, please, leave a kudos or a comment if you liked it so far, and a comment about the things you didn't like and maybe I could have done better- or anything that confused you? Comments and Kudos's are so important for my moral, to know people want to keep reading motivates me to edit and upload some more.
I hope, despite the lack of quality in some parts, that you enjoyed!
“Mother,” Draco stared at her for a second, looking at her hollow face, and bloodshot eyes. He had the sudden urge to sweep her into a hug. So he did.
That's important... “ he trailed off, a picture of beauty and peace. Then, as the rest of the world faded away, Harry raised his wand. In a grand, yet still relatively quiet voice, he commanded- “
“Is anyone down here?” The fear in his voice betrayed him as they descended down the stairs.
It wasn’t until the end of the trip when they were taking their luggage down that Draco received solid proof that Potter was there and it hadn’t been his imagination.
He set his fingers on the keys and forced himself to be in the moment, for nothing to exist except him and the ivory keys in front of him. He took a breath, let his heart settle, and committed. He began to play, the notes and keys an extension of himself.
Draco cast his eye's down, “Yeah, I know exactly how you feel actually,” he spoke quietly, shocked that Harry was sharing all this- and shocked that he felt comfortable doing the same. Perhaps it was the post-battle shock. “It’s so strange- like I’m watching somebody else's hands when I move them. It happened a lot when I had to-” he stopped, realising he was about to say
, but I can assure you that the Dark Lord does too!
Astronomy: O
He growled and threw the paper across the room. He had to be better, and stronger- for his Mother and for himself.
“But really Draco...did you actually think-” Draco’s heart froze at his father’s tone, it was a cold and sarcastic one “-that you could fake a relationship with Pansy and I wouldn’t notice?”
His Mother’s whisper in his ear was so quiet it might not have happened. His hairs raised themselves off him, and he felt a shiver of thunder ripple across his skin. The odd sensation of blood returning to his face.
He could not stop it from occasionally rearing it’s head, speaking truths in loud whispers at the back of his mind, reminding him of his cruelty and hypocrisy.
Theo rolled his eyes “I bloody knew it, you literally never stop! It's amazing you have time to study.” Pansy just smiled sweetly, but there was a different, more mischievous kind of joy in her eyes.
“Sit down” said Blaise and Draco did as he was told. He drew his knees up to his chest and hid his head, hating this whole situation.
“Thank-you Father.”
“Draco you were just screaming, do not try to tell me that you're fine.”
Draco nodded, “Good evening.”
I’ve never seen Him so angry… We were in a meeting when He first got the news that Potter had robbed Gringotts.” Draco paused as he re-lived the memory. “I didn’t think it was possible but he got paler than normal. And before he got angry- well- he looked scared.”
Theo rolled his eyes and gave Draco a rude gesture.
“I used to pretend this was my dragon breath,” said Draco, sighing again and watching the swirl of cloudy breath rise into the air.
“I thought you were with Pansy now-” She paused then softened “-but regardless, I was shocked, but I have come to realise that I don’t
was with Blaise. Before his Father found out. His father in his dreams last night proved he was still weak.
They spent the next hour playing wizards chess before Draco left to prepare for the Ball.
“At least you’re not as uptight as your parents.” She swept out of the room, calling as she left “I will train you to be better than the mudblood, have no fear”
“I’ll decide that,” Draco growled, but then smiled. “Well, I’d better be off.” he paused then gestured to the Hand of Glory which he had also purchased, but as it could not be shrunk by magic and did
And strangely, that was enough for Draco. Someone was there with him- and
Draco nodded back at him, and climbed into the warm carriage, thankful to get out of the cold night air. He would research the Thestrals later.
Another heft chapter.
He grabbed it.
” Granger yelled her words this time. She had shot to her feet and had
"Been spying on me through you has he?" He almost wasn't surprised. His father had gotten to Blaise, so why couldn't he have gotten to Draco's best friends?
“I need you for something before class starts, so hurry up” He took another bite of his apple and then turned to Theo, who was frowning at him.
Draco couldn’t speak- his mouth opened and closed, but he swallowed again and then managed, “I was sick of the death, and the suffering. I just wanted it to be over.” He didn’t even think to lie.
“What’s Potter coming into Hogwarts for then?” Crabbe broke the silence. Thrusting them all back into considering their present and not Voldemorts.
Draco gives Luna the last of his liquid luck to put in some water before sending her back into the dungeons. She makes him have a sip of it himself.
The rest of his time was spent thinking. Not only did he have to confront everything he had ever been taught, but everything he had stupidly believed. He knew for a fact that muggle-borns could be brilliant, as seen by Hermione Granger. He knew that she was kind and he was cruel. He knew she was better than him. How could he have ever believed that he was better because of his blood?
and he invaded my mind... He invaded everything that was private to me! He found that stupid fucking kiss and tried to beat it out of me-
Draco suddenly didn't know what to think. He hated his father but such compliments had always been rare. Something had warmed inside him. He despised it.
His Mother stepped back from him, shocked at his tone. Draco tilted his head, finding that he did not care. She was being far too worrisome. Just like she had always been.
He hoped it had all been for something.
“Draco.” Her harsh words silenced him. “Buying sex from someone with food and a shower is still
Eventually, he got himself under control and wiped at his eyes.
He reprimanded his brain, cringing at the thought of the boy who the Prophet and other papers had now labelled as ‘the Chosen One’ after denouncing him for the entirety of the previous year.
But he did have to take the morning mail. He had tried to tell the house elves that it could go to his Mother, but they had insisted that his father had instructed that it go to him. Draco suspected it was to ensure he began to take on some responsibility.
be slightly beneficial if you did
“Yes I could make that happen, it will take some time, but it will happen.” She gave him one of the hideous smiles again. His Father had been right, this woman did have power. Too much of it.
“It is not an unbreakable vow, I am not stupid enough to do such things, but if you break your vow I will know.” Draco nodded. He needed to process all of this shit.
They made their way to Spintwitches Sporting Needs, the smell of leather and wood polish drifting pleasantly into their noses as a small snitch came and flew around their heads. The shop owner bustled over to them and upon request quickly showed them to the gloves section. He pointed out a couple and was obviously trying to sell the most expensive ones. Draco shrugged and bought a pair of Clabbert Leather and Dragonhide gloves ‘for both comfort and grip’ it was his father’s money, whom he hated, so why not waste it? It wasn’t like his father would find out.
“Tell anyone and there will be retribution.” Draco pulled his sleeve back down, covering the mark. “You know Fenrir Greyback?” Borgin’s eyes darted up to Draco.
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Mother, restraining him tightly with her steady hand upon his
her because that's how she’s clawed her way to the top.”
Draco's eyes snapped open to see Snape rocking back in his chair.
He almost followed the students into the room before he had felt an arm grab him and drag him to the side of the door.
Despite his fear, Draco stood tall in his own mind, knowing this time Voldemort was taking a specific interest and wouldn’t be tricked by the sight of a small cowering boy- he was hunting for evidence of foul play, and anything to do with Potter. Draco could feel his hunger through the connection legilimency created.
Bliase just nodded.
He felt that friendship evaporating into thin air as Crabbe growled.
saw Crabbe and Goyle push past him, following the sounds of voices- talked about finding a “Diadem.” He hurried to follow. They walked for some time, following a very similar path to the one Draco had once walked daily, until eventually the echoes stopped. Perhaps they had lost the trio?
did this mean? Draco was frozen in fear. Could it possibly mean that the Dark Lord was bac-
After giving Crabbe and Goyle their presents- massive boxes of their favourite chocolates and other treats, as well as some Zonko’s tricks, he walked over to Pansy.
Draco bit back the sarcastic, hateful words he wanted to say-
Draco shook his head, the thoughts which were in it were still too loud.
Nothing came.
Draco stopped, causing Blaise to almost trip in his rush to do the same.
After the sickening feeling of apparition, they arrived home and were greeted by their mothers. Bellatrix was nowhere in sight.
He screamed in defiance, he would
“I beg your pardon?” Snape was making him speak loud enough for the rest of the class to hear. Draco was beginning to feel uncomfortable.
On the way back to the hall, Draco took a different route. A meandering route that allowed him to think- He knew his past was about to catch up with him, he could not escape his actions during the war. He would be prosecuted. His Mother would be prosecuted... But he could put all that off for a little longer. He made his way to a small courtyard near the Transfiguration classroom. It had been heavily impacted by the battle; several of the doorways were collapsed in on themselves and fires had burnt most of the plants and grass.
Draco paused, “Oh.” He had gotten so used to using wordless that he had forgotten it was uncommon for wizards his age. “Yeah- I ah, taught myself.” He cleared his throat again. “Anyway- measure out 2 ounces of lavender oil, and 6 ounces of moonstone powder”
He hadn’t realised how sleep deprived his mother had looked the last time he had seen her. But looking upon her face now- and her eyes, which didn’t have permanent bags under them and had the spark of life in them he could see just how bad she had been. He smiled at her, glad to see her looking so well.
Draco shoved the hand off “Yes, and who are you? What the hell do you want?”
“Good plan,” said Harry sarcastically. Draco watched his eyes dart around. Looking for a way out. He began edging slowly backwards.
Within a minute his hands were bleeding but he didn’t care and kept going.
She was silent for a second, her lack of answer conveying that she was surprised he had taken this route. “Well.” was all she said, before stopping to bend a glowing yellow flower to her nose.
that he had received when growing up had been all about social manipulation. His Father had seen it as a necessary part of growing into a broadly skilled young man.
He sprinted, he feet feeling lighter then they had ever felt, and going faster than they had ever gone. His breaths came fast and burned his throat. He had one thought and one goal. He
, not you.”
Potter and Weasley took out their wands, looking like they would hex him. He welcomed it- anything would be better than watching Potter any longer- with the darkness raging inside of him. Perhaps the pain would focus his mind enough to trap it back in.
Still nothing.
As he desperately searched for anything that could help him-- it struck him like a bolt of lightning.
He sat down and picked up his tea, sipped it and sighing at the warmth of the drink and enjoying the quiet company.
“Sissy! Come here!” A call from Bellatrix brought him back to reality, and by the look of it, his mother too. She returned his smile then followed her sister from the room.
He had watched... and done nothing. He had mastered his ability to put on a face, to meet Pansy in Diagon Alley and pretend that he was okay with all of this, as she was.
“So we did” muttered Draco, frowning as the pile of food grew higher
. Did that mean quidditch? It couldn’t, quidditch was the first thing that had brought him real joy in over two months. He hadn’t been able to play the previous year at all so there was no fucking way he wasn’t going to be allowed to play again. His Father's words came back to him. “
“Do you want some food?” Blaise asked.
He looked over his shoulder again as he turned into Knockturn Alley.
It was only when Barty Crouch went missing that Draco’s attention was brought back to reality. Snape was incredibly agitated by the disappearance and this worried Draco.
“Just lost in thoughts is all…” He paused, trying to gathering courage, but failing “How have you been?”
“What can I get for you today?”
Then he thought of Pansy, Blaise and Theo, wondering if they were okay.
with anyone. Umbridge stood out stuck out her hand, Draco went to shake it and wasn't surprised by how clammy it was.
“Of course, Mr Malfoy. I’ll write the Slytherin team a permit right away.”
They walked back into the Slytherin carriage and upon entry Draco realised he wasnt in the mood for Pansy’s endless chatter, or Crabbe and Goyle's complaining, so as he sat down next to Theo, who was reading, he decided to copy the behaviour as reading would allow him to politely ignore everyone in the cabin for the rest of the trip. He opened his Ancient Rune’s textbook, which he had been reading for the purpose of getting ahead in study.
She ushered them in, seemingly excited by the possibility of work. As she bustled around, holding up various dark coloured fabrics to Draco and his mother, Draco felt something warm spreading in his chest-
Theo had remained quiet the entire time, but as he climbed into the carriages he gave the air in front on the carriage a strange look and spoke quietly.
Theo just rolled his eyes.
“I know-”
Draco and Luna's plans to get her out are rudely interrupted by the Golden Trio who are very silly and get themselves snatched.
Crabbe and Goyle had made their way back over, and targeted the Hufflepuff “Yeah, do you have a problem with us?” The cruel look was back in their eyes again.
“Pay attention” Draco flicked his wand at Blaise's cauldron, “Your flame was too high, you could have ruined it”
“Pansy, I won’t tell you again. I’m not going to keep you all from your family, who would kill me if they didn’t get to see you guys.
Snape nodded, “Very well, I shall escort you there.”
“Hey watch it!” A second year hufflepuff called out. Pansy grabbed Draco’s arm and dragged him over to the little girl who had yelled after Crabbe and Goyle. “
Quietly, she began to open up. “I once loved him you know, but that was long ago.” She smiled sadly and her eyes went distant “He was handsome and charming when I met him. Quite the catch. I was convinced I was the luckiest woman in the world. I... I was happy. But as time passed the facade he had maintained for my parents dropped. He became more distant... and then angry, I struggled to hold up my belief in him and the happiness. But I stayed because my family demanded it, and I feared the consequences of leaving him. My parents became very…
He shuffled over and sat at one of the desks, then noxxed his wand, it's light too bright now that he didn’t need it.
I really enjoyed writing the duel in this chapter, let me know how I went and what could have improved? Could you keep track of it, could I have been more detailed...ect? Its my first time in the story writing anything of this nature in such detail and its good practice for later in the story when Draco shall become a little more adept at duelling... as well as some other characters who ill write in the perspective of ;)
Later that night as he made his way to the library to find a book to get lost in, he heard raised voices echoing from the dining room.
Part of Draco’s
She looked up to find him staring directly at her. Red eyes, piercing into her mind. She resisted the urge to whimper.
“Draco!” It was the quiet whisper of his Mother. He looked at her white face, which was full of such joy- and then found he could not even summon any happiness to find her alive
Draco smiled at him, “What did you get me?”
“Well, my dear, You would help me keep an eye on the school: patrol the halls, give and take points. Enforce order. That sort of thing.”
at me when I first said hi, y’know? But I’m not sure, he might just be playing the game really well” With that, she directed him the cabin that Crabbe and Goyle had reserved for him and found the boy Pansy had been talking about.
“Well, it was lovely to make your acquaintance boys, but class is beginning now, so if you would please make your way to your seats.”
He searched for an answer in his head before slowly asking the question “Why... would you ever meet my Father?”
Pansy snickered and Blaise frowned at him. Draco hated himself.
“I don’t know” He kicked at the rubble again. He didn’t feel like making decisions.
Then, as if from the depths of his nightmares, an unfamiliar voice spoke, and it was one that sent fear through every inch of his body, “I don't want any more unexpected visitors, Lucius. Close off the network” Draco froze as his father said “At once my Lord”
He gulped it down, shuddering at the taste. In a few minutes the headache had faded to a dull throb and he was able to get up and drink an anti-tiredness potion to counter the headache potions side effect. As he looked in the mirror and saw the pronounced bags under his blood-shot eyes, and he knew this wasn't good for him. He turned away, not being able to stand the sight.
too late.” A lone tear fell from her eye and her voice began to waver and grow heavy. “I am so sorry Draco, I’m sorry I didn't do anything that night, I was too frightened- I- I froze, I thought he might stop after a hit or two like he usually does... If I could go back I would- I would guard you with my life.”
Pansy giggled. The necklace and earrings he had bought her sat on her neck and in her ears. They sparkled just like her eyes.
Blaise sat down and a bead of sweat broke from his forehead.
The waitress nodded and waved her wand, which caused the correct cutlery to appear on the table before them.
Later that evening, Draco forced himself to walk the last few steps to once again knock on Snape's door. While he did appreciate the occlumency lessons, that didn’t mean he looked forward to them.
didn’t like him and kept their space. He couldn’t imagine just how horrible Potter must have felt, Draco once again felt some pity and also a little guilt accompanied this time, for how he had always treated Potter.
Black spots appeared, his balance escaped him and he cried out and fell to the floor. He made eye contact with his Mother who was also on the floor across the room. Her neck was a deep red from the choking. He looked back to his father only to be grasped by the shirt and pulled up, His father used that grip to anchor Draco as he began hitting him.
That's it! Sorry, I didn't plan this scene until I wrote it so I didn't put it in the tags... my deepest apologies.
He searched the luggage rack above him, glad to he could do it easily as his head was in Pansy’s lap, but he could find no sign of Potter.
yesterday.” He lied, stopping her from dismissing him. He could actually see the words stop in her throat as she forced out the word- “Oh?”
He blinked as he finally figured it out. Crabbe and Goyle- and Merlin help her- even
He himself had been used as a spy for Umbridge.
“Relax Pansy.” He placed a reassuring hand on her arm “You are the most stunning one in the room...I think everyone’s just a bit shocked because Granger looks respectable for once. You always look beautiful, so you’re not getting the same reaction.” She smiled gratefully at him, seemingly placated.
Outstanding (O)
amongst friends. He felt a smile, a real smile, come onto his face. It was the first one since the night of the piano concert.
….and he had been controlling it for over two years. Now that he knew the threat it could pose, he would make sure to not let it out of it’s cage. He would keep his own emotions in check. He would use the breathing and exercise techniques Blaise had taught him.
“We should-”
“Let’s see how well Snape has trained you. I shall test you” Draco panicked to finish the last of his wall with the little warning he had.
“I’ll speak to my father about it. It’ll be fine.”
Mood lightened, he made his way into the potions stockroom and began gathering the required ingredients.
“I’m pretty sure the Weasel hates Potter at the moment,” said Theo, frowning and grabbing Crabbe before he stepped on to some steps which had started moving.
“...Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things…”
Draco's eyes snapped open, and he was hit by the headache and tiredness that was a result of his occlumency practice the night before. He had been working for a number of days on burying the incident with Potter in the library and what occurred after.
The rest of the school year passed slowly. Draco mainly kept to himself, always thinking, going in circles with himself as he tried to think of a way to get away from his father. They had no family that would accept them- and Andromeda could not be contacted due to the magical restraints put on his Mother. Narcissa had not seen her sister in decades, so even if she
McGonagall and Dumbledore walked onto the dancefloor and began dancing in an odd way. They didn't seem to really care that people were watching, they were just having a good time. Eventually, the song ended and the other dancers were allowed onto the floor. He took Pansy’s hand. “Are you ready?”
Snape sighed again before speaking “To be truthful with you, I don't know. But something is brewing.” He frowned seemingly finished with his ominous speech, “Come see me in my office tonight at the usual time, and I will review your progress.”
Yet Draco had never heard Goyle sound so smart.
Draco inwardly sighed and then tuned back into Goyles monotone account of the game- which actually sounded as if it had been good.
There stood Blaise, speaking similar words that Harry had spoken on Goblin’s Lookout.
Harry turned and retired to his seat, a hand coming up to support his head. He looked exhausted. “Yeah… My brain hasn’t caught up to all of it yet. I have so much to think about- so many people…” His voice wobbled slightly- he was fighting tears. “So many are dead.” He sniffed, and as he raised his face to the sky Draco saw that he hadn’t been able to keep the tears back. They fell down his face, cutting through the dirt that covered it. It was such a vulnerable moment that showcased just how tired Harry truly was- for he never would have cried in front of Draco in his right mind.
The next couple of weeks he avoided Potter, hating having to interact with him at all. He was doing well enough at avoiding Potter, just making snide remarks in the occasional classes they shared together.
“Don’t use words, you stupid boy!” A sharp shock jabbed Draco in the arm as she punished him for his mistake.
Draco let a smile creep onto his face. “Yes, I do expect he will react rather nicely, we should show them to him tomorrow when we have potions... Snape shouldn’t mind too much.”
Soon enough they reached the halfway point, which was the top of a hill which overlooked the property. Sitting down upon the old body of a fallen tree, with his breath coming out in a steamy puff of cloud, Blaise asked the usual question.
“Tell me,” said Draco,
The door dinged as some customers walked in.
That made him think of Goyle.
Much love!
“Come here boy” The Dark Lords voice carried across the crowded room, even though he hadn’t spoken loudly. Draco felt like pissing himself, and his heart began to beat rapidly. He started to build his walls. His practice over the last month had been intense, and it paid off. His walls were built quickly, and they were strong. By the time he crossed the room, they were up.
Draco rolled his eyes and got back to measuring, “The instructions will appear on the board once the Gryffindors get here…they always take their time. They don't like potions.”
Draco felt the understanding echoing out from Voldemort. “
Beside him, Pansy cackled. “
“Don’t you dare use foul language in my presence, Draco Malfoy.”
Eventually, Draco realised they needed medical attention, and he called for the house elves.
Hiding his shock behind a snicker, Draco settled himself back onto Pansy, considering.
“Yeah” Draco agreed, promising himself he would stop thinking about asses and think of a revenge plan for the Boy who Lived instead.
then?
Lucious was blasted back from his mother, and onto the floor.
As he said it, he shoved back at the wall of muscle, pleased to find Crabbe actually staggered back. His workouts were doing something then.
“I heard you were fucking crazy” He heard his mother's gasp behind him, but he was focused on the woman in front of him, whos amused smile had widened into a manic grin. She cackled, her hollowed out eyes suddenly lighting up with an intensity Draco could not have foreseen.
A quick but concentrated ‘accio’ in his mind bought the potion to his waiting hand, which was another small testimony to his hard work with wordless magic.
“Fuck off Crabbe” He pushed the brute away from him, but couldn't help a smile as Crabbe ran down the stairs looking giddy as a child. He forced himself to get up.
“What are you doing?!” Blaise held up his bleeding hands for inspection. “We have to get you to the hospital ward.” Concern filled his eyes.
this was weird.
Hope you enjoyed. I mean, that was pretty hefty stuff, maybe hard to enjoy?
“Draco, I saw you that night, I know you drank. And now you know the dangers of not meditating, so I assume you shan’t do it again. Your father can access your dreams because you have a blood connection, so you must always meditate before you sleep--” He sighed and stopped his lecture “But it does not matter now.” Snape squatted down “Did he get in? Did he see your memories?”
“Getting through” was her response. She untangled herself, “I’m so proud you made Prefect dear” The letter from Hogwarts had come two nights before. Draco had tossed it away, not caring. It had been expected.
Merlin be damned, and he could hug her if he liked.
“Well, there are other ways to make your head shut up. You’re not in control if you turn to something that is painful. That means the pain is controlling
Having returned from dinner, both Draco and Pansy were working on the badges. He hadn’t allowed Crabbe or Goyle near them since Crabbe had turned one bright pink and Goyle had somehow managed to blow one up. Theo sat in the corner studying, and had given up trying to convince them to do the same.
So, Draco waited for the battle to re-commence. He had his 17th birthday present on the floor next to him. It was a beautiful thing, made of gold- with intricate peacocks and their little jeweled tail feathers gracing the front. Inside, a little watch innocently counted down the time until the battle started again.
There was a sputtering sound- that would be Theo, a gasp- that would be Pansy and a soft “
He began to search Draco’s mind for memories of Blaise, and Draco stood in shock as he flicked through the memories of them running, talking and eating together and finally found the one Draco had made that day of Blaise holding his hand and dragging him through the crowd in Diagon Alley. He had not buried it yet.
Draco scoffed. “You needed it more than me.”
"No, don't give me that- you know you also saved my life at the Manor. So I still owe you. Who knows what would have happened if you had told them it was me immediately? Bellatrix wouldn’t have been there to fight with your father, everything might have been different- I
“Good Morning Draco,” His Mother looked a bit distant- she had been since Voldemort had come into the household. She didn’t even seem to find it odd that Draco was out of his rooms.
Plus it lets me see my audience and what yall want. Would love to talk to you guys!
"Please, sir, I'm supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.” Snapes unimpressed look was replaced by a very cold glare.
“Thanks, but I’m in control of what I’m doing” He turned away from Blaise, not liking the pity which had now joined the worry. Draco needed to make him leave.
“Draco,” Draco froze, his father had seen him, it was too late.
Harry had lunged to the side, managing to narrowly dodge the curse. Draco panicked and grabbed at Crabbe again- who was aiming his wand at Harry for a second time. “STOP!” Draco felt the command in his voice, hearing it echoing through the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive-”
He reached back into his past memories, inwardly sneering at all saw before finding that there was only one person he was aware of that owned an invisibility cloak. And was the only person who might be stupidly brave enough to spy on him.
But then, as the rest of the death eaters rushed towards their fallen leader, she began to make her way over to the body.
Draco felt his lip curl. The others in the carriage laughed.
“Just give me a second” Blaise said as he finished tied his tie. “You left so fast I didn’t have time to tell you to wait- while I grabbed my robes.” Blaise was smiling at him, but Draco didn’t smile back, he had to stop whatever
his brains.
The redhead scowled back at Draco, and Draco almost burst out laughing. Pansy had no such control, and her laughter filled the carriage.
Draco opened his eyes to his tear-soaked pillow, hating the day already.
Her heavily lidded eyes looked him over “Draco Malfoy.”
Draco turned around, he knew to go down on one knee and bow his head. His breath caught as his eyes found a massive snake, coiled around Voldemort's feet on the floor. He forced himself to concentrate, his walls were almost complete. “My Lord.” He made sure to sound respectful, to not let the quiver of fear into his voice.
I'm going to finish it anyway. And there will be romance. Someday. ahA.
“My mother,” said Draco, not moving his face at all. Harry laughed loudly, and Draco couldn’t stop his face from heating.
No, he didn't. That was just the alcohol talking. Draco turned to Pansy, “Its like they have sticks up their asses” Pansy giggled.
as if he were alive.
Uh whoops sorry, I've been camping and without internet for a week. But good news! My next chapter is also almost done so it'll be up tomorrow! Check back then :)
Theo spoke again, looking far too thoughtful. “So- It's kept in the hardest-to-get place in the world... was put in the Lestrange vault- an old vault, so it's even harder to steal than normal- Potter stole it, and He got angry- but more importantly- scared.”
“Yes, that’s where I was not ten minutes ago...Pansy, be a dear and wake the girls, I shall wake the boys.”
He stepped forward to inspect it, running his hands over the smooth mahogany wood, which was such a dark brown it looked black. He could feel the low buzz of magic emanating off it. This was the one.
The wind was racing through his hair and that in combination with the sun on his face set something free in him. Draco was grinning as he sped around the pitch. He increased his speed, pushing the broom to its limits as a laugh slipped from his mouth, he hadn’t realised how much he missed being on his broom.
The terrifying voice filled every corner of his mind, and Draco wanted to scream.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. They had been training hard over that last couple of days, preparing for his Defence Against the Dark Arts exam.
“Yeah,” said Blaise, “She said they’ve become good friends, and she’s managed to get close to her- apparently they have tea together most afternoons”
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as they got out of the shop Draco headed for a side alley, barely hearing his Mother’s footsteps behind him. He doubled over as they reached the safety of the darkness, and placed his hands over his head to try and stop the anger which was consuming him.
Draco could not believe he had been so unlucky.
Draco heard Crabbe’s squeak of delight as the Chosen One appeared in front of them, but the noise was covered by the sounds of the battle commencing.
“Do not speak of such things to me,” she harshly interrupted him, her expression having transformed from anger to horror, “-things that can be pulled from my mind. Already you are already suspected of helping them escape.”
He glanced over at Blaise who he had almost forgotten was there. He didn’t feel as if he could speak so he just nodded and left for a shower.
“What’s going to happen in the coming months?” Snape had been hinting at ‘something’ which was apparently going to occur ‘next year’ or ‘in the coming months’ for some time, but he never revealed what. Draco assumed it was something to do with the dark mark incident at the Quidditch world cup.
He closed his eyes to block out the smoke and yelled again, his scream weaker for he could not get a proper breath in. “HELP ME!”
Let's keep in mind he's been self-harming, and has cut himself off from his family and friends. Very vulnerable.
She turned and glared at him over her shoulder and it was then that Draco noticed that she was sporting a swollen eye- but Draco could barely appreciate it and hissed “Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school...Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.”
Draco, for the first time in his life, followed Crabbe and Goyle.
“Aha!” She said as she looked up from her desk, a pink quill scribbling furiously in front of her. “You must be Draco Malfoy! I would recognise those features and that hair anywhere! So wonderful to meet you. Your father is a friend of mine” Inwardly, Draco laughed. His Father wasn’t
“How do we get in?” Goyles voice came from seemingly nowhere.
to be alone.
Draco cleared his throat. “Uhm, I need  to borrow some bruise reducing-”
“Harry?” Draco froze as Weasley’s voice echoed from another stack. “Are you talking to someone?”
, little team. Let's call it… the Inquisitorial squad! How does that sound?” Draco was vaguely reminded of a hound attempting to smile by the look she gave him.
She barely held back her laugh, and let out a squeak instead as Theo scared her from behind. Theo had finally decided to make an appearance, and was dressed in badly fitting dress robes.
He didn’t try to fill the silence again in the time it took them to reach the common room. Just before they entered she stopped him. “Wait a second.”
“You bloody menace” As usual, Draco couldn’t help but grin back. “Where have you been all night then? All week? We’ve missed you” Around him, Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle nodded.
However, two days away from Christmas he was surprised by Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle when they returned early, citing that they had ‘gotten bored’ at home. That had been a good night, full of laughter and boardgames. Draco had been happy.
“Um, yeah- sure” Draco agreed, inwardly hating that he was being forced to confront the last person he wanted to see.
The darkness seeped through the cracks it had created, and he could not stop it. Letting it back in had been a bad idea.
“When creating the Dark Mark, The Dark Lord creates a fake, magical- kind of... blood connection, which means he can communicate to his followers-
His father slapped him. Shocking him into silence. “Quiet boy!”  It hurt, but Draco was more focused on the panic spreading through his entire body “Swear to me-” His father's eyes had suddenly become very still. “Swear to me- that you shall never do that again. That you shall
Draco snapped awake, having just been having a pleasant dream about a dragon chasing a boy on a broom with a black mess of hair on his head- to find Crabbe’s face far too close to his.
Draco looked around for any signs of the invisible horses, when the Patil twin screamed “I think I felt something, I think it’s near me!”
get sent to Azkaban. ” Narcissa’s anger vanished and the blood in her face seemed to follow it.
Draco was sipping his usual morning tea and was reading a book Bellatrix had instructed him to read, which was enchanted to look like a textbook when there was a small knock at his door.
survival. The Dark Lord did not look kindly upon those who showed tolerance or mercy.
“You,” she turned to Draco “Never cast a protego too early. It will simply allow me to fire a spell that cannot be blocked by a protego, as I just did- and it is a drain on your magic. I’m getting some water. We will go again after lunch.” She swept from the room.
The students were all incredibly stupid to believe the prophet, but it was just a tactic his father had engineered to alienate Potter and Dumbledore from their peers. Father had already orchestrated the removal of Dumbledore from Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards. Seeing Potter’s distressed and angry face, Draco allowed himself to feel some pity for the boy who lived.
“NO.”
Who had they seen die? Draco took a moment and guessed Theo might have seen his mother die, but Blaise? He began to see them both in a new light.
TRIGGER WARNING. IF YOU ARE TRIGGERED SEXUAL ASSAULT/RAPE PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS CHAPTER. THERE IS A SUMMARY BELOW.
Draco knew he had said it just to hurt him. Probably because he wanted to make Draco feel what he felt. Draco understood that, but it didn't stop Crabbe from getting what he wanted. Draco felt his chest constrict and his anger rise in reaction to the pain.
. But then he decided that Harry had been honest, so he would be honest too. “When I had to torture people.” He dared not look at Harry as memories of the screams began to invade the moment.
“Hello Draco.” Draco looked around. He was back at home. In the living room stood Harry Potter, he was inspecting some photos on the fireplace mantle.
Logically, he knew that help was not coming, but that did not stop him from screaming as loudly as he could. “HELP! HEEEELP!!”
“Accio Firebolt!”
He strode over to the Slytherin table, made eye contact with Pansy who was grinning at him and smiled slyly back.
He smiled.
“Mother” He embraced her, relaxing a small amount at the smell of her perfume. He pulled back
Draco glanced at him from the side of his eye, “Could I what?”
He stepped back as he realised why. He had momentarily forgotten in the midst of their silly conversation.
As they collapsed onto a grassy hill puffing and laughing, Draco suddenly became aware of Blaise’s body which was awfully close to his. As noticed that, Blaise’s knee bumped against his. He bumped it back. A second later their knees were resting against each other and the small contact sent electricity through Draco. He could focus on nothing but- he looked across at Blaise laying across from him, face tipped back with eyes closed to appreciate the sun that warmed his face, with lips that curled into a satisfied smile.
“But he’s there!” Draco heard Pansy’s shrill tones interrupt the moment. “Potter’s there! Someone grab him!” Draco raised his eyes to the roof in embarrassment.
His life
Draco levelled his wand at the beast. “What the fuck are you doing?!” Fenrir ignored him and looked back to Blaise.
of his cowadice, down to his fucking
“He's a good man” Draco said, perhaps a little coldly. He cleared his throat, attempting to sound a little friendlier. “Despite it all… and I know there's a lot... he's actually not a bad man.”
Draco was still smiling when he stepped through the fireplace into the living room- but it was wiped from his face upon seeing the sight that greeted him. Voldemort and his father stood in the living room.
“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, and looked to his mother for support who had just come out from behind a clothes rack “Madam, please!”
“We need to talk-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Once- and only once- some second years had tried to sit in their spot, only to be subjected to Pansy’s wrath. It had been an amusing sight, albeit, not for the second years. Draco glanced at her as she unpacked her bag, laughing at a joke Theo had made.
Sneaking closer, he made his way to the doorframe of the drawing room, which was more than close enough to hear the debates of the Death Eaters.
, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” How Draco would love to have Harry in a detention all by himself where he could-
Draco continued, struggling not to scream at her. “I know we are going to brew a Draught of Peace...Snape told me. Should be useful for tests huh?”
His Father loved them. He saw the blonde hair of the man as he walked among them, a small peace in his collapsed world.
“Uh Draco, you’ve got some...” Goyle pointed at the corner of his mouth. Draco swiped at his face, only to find a large glob of mashed potato.
“No, this is just a spur of the moment visit” he said. She narrowed her eyes are him, obviously not liking his lack of formality.
Potter looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow… look at that… he’s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!”
Itssss fifth year!
Draco trudged down towards Hogsmeade, considering his dream from the night before, with his suitcase levitating beside him. His chest felt light and warm from the memory, but simultaneously it left a very sickening feeling in his stomach. This was his
He set a sneer on his face as he pushed open the door of the shop, wrinkling his nose as the musky smell affronted it. He stopped for a moment to let his eyes adjust to the ever-present darkness of the store, and then walked in, his head held high and his back straight- just as his father had taught him.
Draco dragged his mind away from the thoughts- wandering where she was, if she was safe…
mission. I will have no one but myself responsible for its success.”
Theo frowned “Except your ghoul theory doesn't make sense because, as we love to remind her, she’s got muggles for parents?” His grinned as Pansy scowled and hit his shoulder “We’re just joking around, you mood killer”
He broke the contact first. Pansy sighed and with a note of concern said “Come on, we have to go on duty and patrol the train.”
“Fine, let’s talk about it over lunch shall we?” He asked, gesturing to the bright street next to them.
He took a shaky breath, summoning courage-- The words stuck in his mouth, defying him. He took another breath hoping this one would not fail him.
“Well that horse looks pretty fucking creepy,” said Blaise pointing to the air in front of the carriage. Draco looked, confused.
Objects were still crashing to the floor on the other side of the wall. Spurred into action, Potter finally came to his senses and pointed his wand at the wall of junk, “Finite!” Draco felt the pressure ease as the more powerful spoken spell steadied the wall. He let his own spell go, just in time to see Crabbe attempt the same spell again. “No!” he grabbed Crabbe’s arm, making the giant pause.“If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!”
Draco smiled, and with encouragement from Pansy walked over to the piano that sat in the corner of the room. Having your child learn an instrument was a common practice among the richer pureblood families, this meant over the years, an array of instruments had made their way into the Slytherin common room. When Draco was six years old his mother and father had chosen piano for him. What was once a chore imposed on him by his parents now bought him immense pleasure and was what he used to escape his thoughts. As he sat down and placed his fingers on the ivory keys he felt his mind slip into that relaxed place it always did. He did a quick warm up with a Hayden piece and then moved onto a Bach piece. His fingers flew across the keys and the notes rose into the air creating wonderful melody and harmony.
He knocked and waited for the muffled “Enter” to respond. It was a longer wait than usual. Merlin, his father was such a
he mused, glancing at Blaise,
“Draco Darling, you look happy,” his mother said as he walked through the door and towards her table.
He slammed through Snape's office door, knocking over a side table on his way to the fireplace. The crash barely made him flinch. He stopped only for a second-- to take a deep breath and shout “THE MALFOY MANOR!”
Draco relished the moment and then caught Potters attention, “Like them, Potter?” Potter’s eyes snapped to him and narrowed, malice and hatred within them. Draco smirked and continued “And this isn't all they do, look!" He put his wand on the badge, knowing its words were twisting into ‘Potter Stinks!’
“Are you okay Draco?” Startled, Draco looked up. He had momentarily forgotten Snape was there.
“No Mother,” he silenced her guilty words with a wave of his hand “I gave you nothing to suggest otherwise. I’m just sorry I didn’t tell you sooner”
And suddenly, it all became very clear to Draco. He realised he did not want to be a part of that world… and he was in a unique position to make sure it didn’t happen. Drawing upon the pain that had just been at his chest at the thought of Harry Potter being dead, he began to move.
, he reminded himself. It was disgusting, horrible, madness.
forgotten about.
“Oh?” Draco said- this was certainly not what he had expected.
Draco nodded once and heard a muttered curse come from Snape.
She inspires something in Draco.
.” she said in a sarcastic tone. Draco grinned at her, laughing when she poked her tongue out at him. It felt good to be amongst friends again.
