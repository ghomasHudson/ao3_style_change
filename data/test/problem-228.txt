“That’s rich, coming from you,” Draco said, snarling a little, “with the amount of things you accused me of doing you must have been keeping a
Draco sat easily on the Nimbus and scowled as Harry returned to level with him.
Ginny cackles again and accidentally knocks the decorative plant off the table.
Draco’s reply was predictably sardonic. “If I ever need to read the manual on rash decision making and favouritism, I’ll be sure to think of it.”
“Your feelings,” she replied, setting a charm to the dishes in the kitchen sink and flopping herself down in the opposite armchair, a knowing eyebrow raised.
She drew a long, haggard breath.
Two months before the auspicious Christmas Party, Harry had turned up on Ron and Hermione’s doorstep. He was completely bedraggled by rain, had just finished an awful day at work and was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Harry laughed and leant back against the counter. Draco appraised him, sitting on a pulled out chair opposite, his long legs stretched out. The silvery tendrils of the scars across his chest glowed against the pale, white flesh, drawing Harry’s gaze. Harry simultaneously hated those scars and loved them, too.
“Look, I know it’s
Luciana cocks an eyebrow, which makes her look rather severe. “What for?” she asks.
“I’m the last one,” Draco said, almost at a whisper. It was as if the tapestry had put him under some kind of enchantment. Harry glanced surreptitiously over his shoulder to make sure the sleep-inducing music box had definitely been thrown out during the Molly Weasley purge of 1995.
, he had never felt so complete. There were no words to explain how right he felt, how at home and how comfortable, and despite the fact that his heart viscerally hurt to think about how the depth of his attachment might not be wholly reciprocated, he was at peace with it. He was totally, hopelessly and irrevocably in love in a way that he had never considered possible.
“So your mother is with your father’s cousins in France,” he repeated, in an effort to stop himself staring in such a lovesick way. “Why?”
Harry tries to skirt around it, but what he really needs is a personal stylist. Someone who will help him find clothes that he actually cares about, and isn’t afraid to tell him that something makes him look like a cross between Dudley Dursley and a younger and more eccentric Albus Dumbledore.
is upset about Lucius’ passing, what about him?”
“Sensible idea, mate,” Ron replied, nodding his head as Hermione sunk her head into her hands.
“So you’re a business owner, not an Auror.”
the kebab wrapper.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “God, Potter, I can’t wait to see your take on conventional.”
Harry was about to jump in to start trying to wrench the curtain shut (a task which was never easy with one person), when Walburga’s screaming suddenly came to a halt.
Harry finishes levitating the dishes into their stacked position. "I was thinking about coming in tomorrow myself, actually. Maybe I can step in for him."
Hermione just glares, lips pursed into a thin line. “I don't like this obsession, Harry. You
Hermione puts her head in her hands and sighs.
Hermione narrows her eyes at Ron. “Are you Harry? Anyway, Harry
Harry stared, plainly confused. “What?”
Harry thinks. But he says nothing as Katie once again hands him the soy latte and sends him into the Philodendron lair.
Draco snorted. “Merlin, no. I despise going there.”
“Whatever, Potter,” Malfoy cuts him off dismissively. “But we’re going to use my method of transportation, so you’re going to have to get a bit cosy.”
"Didn't know you were a whiz at divination," Katie says drily, then adds somewhat dejectedly, "Martin says he cant come in tomorrow by the way. His little one is still sick."
It was messy and desperate and probably not the best kiss Harry had ever given but
“Great story, Potter,” Draco quipped, but Harry saw his eyes widen perceptively as number 12 revealed itself in front of his eyes.
“I don’t want to talk about it any more, Harry,” he said, giving him a look.
“Why do you have an aversion to listening, Potter?” Draco replied rolling his eyes, “my
Harry sees Malfoy check his watch. It’s a nice watch, Harry thinks, but it catches his attention mostly because it is a muggle watch. Malfoy using muggle things? The world really was going mad.
Malfoy looked terribly uncomfortable with this suggestion and for a moment, Harry wondered whether he was just going to apparate right off the rooftop into the oblivion. Harry dearly hoped not. He was at least somewhat aware that eating kebabs on a rooftop in the middle of winter was probably certifiably insane.
“I wouldn’t expect you to know what
to you. I’m drawn to your intelligence and your sarcastic quick wit. I like you even though you’re stuck up and a bloody snob about food and you can’t just sit quietly and eat a kebab on a rooftop like a normal person.”
The whoosh of the steam wand and the fragrant aroma of the Ethiopian Blend greets Harry as he pushes open the door of the cafe. The shop, hidden away from the remainder of Diagon Alley by virtue of it being situated behind the Apothecary, is one of his favourite spots on earth. Somewhere he can hide behind the ivy covered trellises, and become normal; a nobody.
“Do you need another drink?” Potter asked, flourishing a wine bottle, seemingly from thin air.
Well shit, Harry thought. His heart was racing so fast he had forgotten what he was looking for and why he was in this dingy shed listening to what he was sure would be the next wizarding war breaking out behind him.
“You met her before, in portrait form. Lovely lady, really welcoming,” Harry said, thankful the conversation had turned away from Death Eaters.
Draco raised an eyebrow and smirked.
“Does that scare you?” Harry asked.
Draco looked incredulously at him. “The
That was comfortable.
“Never mind,” Draco hissed, eyes closed, body close as something perceptibly firm pressed against Harry’s stray hand.
“Plain?” he asked incredulously.
Draco looked up and him and smiled, a little tense. “I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, of all people,” he said, “but being forced to co-habit with the Dark Lord changed the ambiance of things. It would be fair to say that it completely diminished the liveability of the place.”
“We’ll take this back to my place,” he starts (and Harry actually gulps), “and you can buy me a drink at the pub around the corner to thank me for saving you from a workplace relations nightmare. Then you can apparate back to your safe house and not have to worry about a dangerous, deranged criminal like me knowing your location.”
personal chef.
odd, and Harry worries that maybe his inebriation has inhibited his Auror-sense.
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco said quickly, looking away from the tapestry to face him. “You wouldn’t understand.”
Draco Malfoy strides into the cafe, hair windswept but otherwise looking inappropriately well put together despite the mild blizzard that is brewing outside. Harry bets Draco Malfoy has a social life. Rich people are always invited to events, Harry imagines, even if they accidentally become part of a failed, murderous plot for worldwide domination.
Harry frowned. “I thought you liked my hair,” he said defensively, “and besides, there’s no point berating me for it, it never does what it’s told, anyway.”
“Fuck,” he murmured into his palms, “I’m in love with Draco
Draco sighed and leaned back against the brickwork. “I know,” he said, grinning up at the sky.
Harry’s mouth opens and closes again hopelessly, and then he lets the expression slide off his face.
“Just because I don’t feel the need to drink myself into a stupor doesn’t mean I don’t know how to have fun, Potter,” he says, “although I wouldn’t expect you to have enough common sense to know that.”
Of course, it’s far too early to be anywhere close to Diagon Alley now, so Harry rummages through his draws and pulls out a pair of old, slightly damp smelling running shorts and a hoodie that is a nostalgic, hand-me-down from Dudley. He has no idea how he still owns it, but he definitely doesn’t mind getting it dirty and sweaty.
Hermione looked stricken, no doubt taken aback by the casual references to death even when it related to someone she wasn’t fond of.
To be fair, he had nothing to compare it to. Mostly because Draco Malfoy had never been able to summon enough fucks to give about another human being in a romantic sense. He was, in all reality, a selfish prat. Which meant that the kind of undeniable, irresistible obsession with following Potter’s every move made him so uncomfortable. It was like being hopelessly addicted to something and having no chance of rehabilitation. Harry Potter was just
himself in the face and wear his invisibility cloak for the remainder of the night.
“Or that,” Ron agrees ruefully. “Don’t tell me you got in early to get ahead on yours. You’re very...jittery today.”
Harry opens the memo.
having children. He teases Hermione a bit and asks how she is going to teach a child to read before they can speak but deep down he knows that really, she could have been his surrogate mother for all of the looking after him she’s done.
After the War, and upon the cessation of immediate threats to his life, Harry had been able to reflect on the fact that he was very much an introvert. Large events didn’t favour him. Unfortunately, the Heads of Office were expected to attend such Ministry events with enthusiasm, and although Harry socialised with people within his Department and maintained relatively normal friendships (he wasn’t sure Luna could ever be described as truly normal), he just wasn’t a
has come home. Finally, I can be at peace in the knowledge that-”
“Stop!” Ron exclaimed, his hands looked as if they were involuntarily reaching for his ears.
Harry groans internally.
Draco dropped his hand immediately and scowled. “I think you should go back to the part where you compliment me.”
Harry is confused as to why he would find such a thing offensive, but strangely he
“Not as quickly as you’ll be sinking Firewhisky shots with me,” she says prodding him.
Harry put the lid on the teapot and turned around, a smirk plastered on his face. “I didn’t know you thought I was intelligent?”
“Of course I want regulars invited!” Harry exclaims, a little shrilly. He needs to get a grip, he reminds himself quickly, or he will end up sounding like Aunt Petunia. “I just didn’t know-”
Harry spluttered on his tea. The idea that anyone could tell Draco Malfoy he looked
As he turns to leave Malfoy to his papers however, Malfoy calls out.
Harry takes a breath. He hopes it builds the suspense. “Draco Malfoy,” he says. To his credit, Ron looks intrigued.
At one point Ron grabs him and pulls him into a tight hug and tells Harry that he’s the best friend he’s ever had and Harry laughs and leans into it but really feels like he wants to cry because he’s a bit drunk and has been fretting about losing track of his best friends for years. They're all growing up and getting married and for
“Just enjoying your sunny disposition,” he said, running his hand through his hair.
“Can we do it again?” he asked, smirking.
“Hermione,” Ron begins. Harry thinks this direct approach is exceptionally brave with Hermione, who is clearly already in an irritable mood due to the great Angostura Bitters debate.
Harry’s great idea had come to him after a year managing multiple leaks at the Daily Prophet (both Malfoy and un-Malfoy related - the two categories were the only ones that mattered). He was both sick of the responsibility and enjoying his verbal spars with the feature reporter too much and felt as if the reigns needed to be bequeathed to someone more adept at dealing with journalists in a full time capacity.
His eyes fluttered open and he looked sideways at Harry with disdain. “Thank you for your kind understanding of my predicament, Potter.”
It isn’t until he is hugging Ron and Hermione goodbye and Hermione whispers to him that Katie might have had one too many espresso martinis that he comes down off his high and starts worrying about something. Most of the people in the cafe-turned-winter-wonderland have patted him roughly on the back or enveloped him in a hug or (in Ginny’s case) sloppily kissed him again and stumbled out the door into the winter night.
"Mad rush?" Harry enquires, stepping into the kitchen behind the main counter and flicking his wand at the remaining dishes in the large, commercial sink.
Malfoy smirks in that infuriating way that makes Harry want to punch him right in his smart mouth.
Harry sighs. “Truthfully, I don’t. I just have really good staff and an ability get by on very little sleep.”
Harry didn’t end up leaving the cottage until ten thirty and by the time he stepped out of the floo in the kitchen of his apartment he was ready to drag himself to bed. That was until a shadow moved ominously in the darkness and he almost jumped out of his own skin.
“My point is,” she says, regaining her composure, “that you have bigger things to worry about than someone from Hogwarts who happens to turn up in
“No, not really,” Malfoy replies.
The parallels were apparent. The soft, imperious voice. The straight-backed, aristocratic posture. The haughty (albeit furious) gaze. Those things were as much apparent in this Malfoy as the Malfoy that stood in Dumbledore’s office in 1993.
Harry had to admit he hadn’t even thought of that. “Even on the Manor grounds?” he asked.
“Better make it an espresso shot as well,” she laughs, “how many Firewhiskies did you have last night?”
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco squeaked incredulously, once he had regained his ability to breathe.
Harry shoved him lightly on the side to protestations. “Careful Potter, this suit is expensive!”
“Because I needed to,” Malfoy says, in a way that makes it clear he doesn’t want to explain any further.
from my presence?” he finished, nodding toward the plate balanced on her right hand.
Harry sits in the Gallardo and wonders why he hasn’t known these strange things about Malfoy before. That he drives a car and understands muggle pop culture references and knows where Harry’s staff live. It’s all very disconcerting.
“I’m not trying to hide you or anything,” he said bluntly. “I’m not, you know, embarrassed if people know we’re…”
It was Harry’s turn to raise an eyebrow in response. “And what does it for you, Draco?”
“Er, no thank you,” Harry said, as his left hand fiddled with the stem of his glass nervously.
more famous than you,” she replies, flipping the menu over and running her finger down the list of items. “I can’t decide. Can you just tell me what to order?”
Draco, to his credit, looked genuinely taken aback. Maybe he wasn’t being a complete prat, Harry thought. He just said, “Oh. Me either,” and looked a bit sheepish about it.
“You wish, Malfoy,” Harry mutters.
“Relax, Draco,” Harry snickered. “It’s been
Harry sighs. “Really? Ron said the same thing.”
Harry saw Draco flatten himself against the wall instantaneously as Walburga Black started her usual screeching, yellow eyes wide open in accusation, stout frame and black bonnet as unpleasant to the eye as her voice was to the ears.
Harry, predictably, is at a loss for words.
He knows he's too invested in her. She's just about to turn 18, only 7 years younger than him, but in a way he feels very protective of her. Katie doesn't really need protection, he knows that. She has older twin brothers that could flatten him in a minute. But there is an undeniable connection he feels with people who have lost family in the war. Selfishly, Harry is sort of glad there are now so many survivors who understand the pain of losing one's parents. It makes him feel less alone.
Malfoy snorts in a very undignified sort of way and doesn’t respond. Somehow, it makes Harry feel even more stupid.
Harry grinned, goading Draco on. “But you haven’t slept with me, Malfoy.”
Harry wouldn’t come to appreciate the intricacies and the differences in one Draco Malfoy until months later. By the time of the 2008 Christmas Party debacle, he swore he couldn’t see the similarities at all.
“You know, nothing about this,” Draco said, gesturing between them, “makes a lot of sense, either. Doesn’t mean I don’t like it.”
“Yes,” Draco replied slowly in way that suggested Harry was a bit thick, “but that has no bearing on the amount of children his aunts and uncles had.”
about his conversation with Malfoy. Upon reflection, it had been a very strange conversation. Harry had simultaneously felt guilty for making Malfoy feel unwelcome, and irritated that he was there. Wanting Malfoy to leave, but also wanting him to...stay?
“Is this offer conditional or did you actually manage to get permission from the Department to hire someone like me?” Malfoy smirked, although he looked slightly off-centre.

Malfoy snorted (in a quite un-
“You pay with sickles and knuts at St. Drogo,” Harry points out, as if it wasn’t obvious.
Draco shot him a look. Harry immediately registered it as one which said “ask me to do something with you, you git.”
“Honestly,” she says, narrowing her eyes, “sometimes I’m surprised you’re not a Slytherin.”
Draco frowned. “I’m not conceited.”
Draco stared at him. “This is becoming very convoluted,” he said. “I hope we’re not related.”
“What?!” he exclaims, feeling a bit defensive.
His stomach knots itself with the familiar feeling of anxiety. He can’t help it, he reasons. It is a universal truth that Harry Potter has an unquenchable complex for good deeds. It’s almost as if his overactive conscience can’t tell the difference between allowing someone to be mildly disappointed and allowing someone to commit violent murder. It’s all the same in that he has an insatiable
person.
. Removing his hand from Draco’s back, he traced his fingers lightly, quickly around the outside of his leg and then, laying his palm flat, up his inner thigh, coming to rest tauntingly close to the zipper.
Not that they wear their work robes to the pub but, as Harry has started to realise recently, their fashion sense is becoming more out of touch with London’s muggle youth.
“Impatient, too,” Draco murmured against Harry’s lips as the former’s fingers tangled themselves in his hair at the nape of his neck.
“Was the house your parent’s?” Draco asked, frowning at the contents of one of the pages at the centre of the book. Harry dearly hoped he had happened upon the section detailing the various Gryffindor victories against Slytherin in the Quidditch Cup.
It wasn’t in an aggressive or defensive tone at least, Harry thought, but this conversation was on a one-way track to disaster. He pulled out the box of battered Quidditch equipment hastily and continued his search for a suitable broom.
Malfoy simply waves his hand to the exposed table next to him and doesn't look up from the stack of parchment he's reading.
“Well, obviously,” he said, stammering a little, “but also I mean, what we’re doing when we’re not having sex.”
As it turns out, Harry doesn’t have much of a chance to make friends, anyway, because the very next week, The Bad Thing happens.
“Don’t be sensitive, Draco,” he said, grinning and placing his hand delicately on Draco’s knee instead, “I very much enjoy your obsession.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “There’s nothing wrong with them,

kind of stuff,” Harry started, “I mean aside from the one time I spontaneously told him that I was in love with him.”
Ginny’s lightning fast reflexes don’t miss a beat as she catches the silver object, but she stares at the flask for a second before reaching over and hitting him over the back of the head with it.
They lapse into a comfortable silence and Harry is lulled by the warmth of the heater and the powerful whirr of the cars’ engine as Malfoy carefully steers through the thinning traffic on Theobalds Road and Rosebery Avenue and out towards Stoke Newington. He glances at the clock, it’s almost one, and wonders how everyone managed to get so drunk so early. Everyone except Malfoy, it seems.
Ron fixes him with an exasperated look. "You're just about the only person I know who leaves work to go to work," he remarks.
“Not true,” Draco sniffed. “I’m a reformed Death Eater, after all.”
Harry thought about this for a minute. He knew very little of his own family tree and so couldn’t really relate to the breadth of people that seemed to occupy Malfoy’s. It was as confusing as the Weasley's, he thought. Maybe it was a pureblood thing.
At some point someone decides to save all of their eardrums and turns it down but not before Mrs Hodgkins who lives upstairs from the Apothecary decides to complain and turns up on their doorstep. Someone pulls her in and shoves a half-warm espresso martini in her hand and forty minutes later Harry sees her chatting animatedly to a pot plant.
“Thanks,” Harry said, frowning. He wasn’t sure if the comment was an observation or an insult, but he never really was quite sure with Draco. He was completely unperplexed that he had chosen to ignore the word
“On what?” Malfoy asks, leaning forward slightly.
Draco wrapped long fingers around his mug for warmth. “Well, these people tell me that I’m boring and
Harry gasped as Draco pressed a kiss deep into the soft skin next to his hip bone.
Harry turns to look at her. She avoids his eyes, steadfastly.
“Fuck,” he groaned as Draco pulled his lips away, lips looking as raw and ravaged as Harry’s felt.
“When you work it out, we’re here, Harry,” she mumbled into his neck.
Cursing Meldrid for her love of the Mauritian blend, Harry levitates the dirty dishes from table ten before heading to the storeroom to get more of the coffee beans.
It takes Harry all of five minutes to remember that he absolutely despises running.
“Dark artefacts, Harry?” Malfoy said quizzically, turning to appraise Harry. “Wouldn’t have picked you as the type.”
When they finally pulled apart, Draco’s eyes smouldered in the dark as he looked Harry up and down appraisingly.  “I’m here every Friday night, you twit.”
to make Draco Malfoy despise him, since he had recently discovered that he was insatiably attracted to the man.
He shakes that absurd thought from his head and looks up at Katie who is sniggering at him.
“Want to eat a kebab on a rooftop?” Harry asked.
Harry frowns at the accusation. “I’m not lying, Malfoy. I actually do own a coffee shop
He gets passed around from person to person, group to group, steadily getting more wasted and having more and more fun. At one point someone breaks into a random chorus of 'Happy Birthday' and everyone joins in and puts 'Harry' in the space where you’re supposed to say the birthday person’s name. Harry has half a mind to tell them it should be 'Jesus' instead because, although he isn’t a religious person, they’re either a solid five months too late or seven months too early.
He wonders what Malfoy does for a job. Fortunately, he doesn’t have to wonder long because being an Auror comes with a wide variety of perks, all of which are definitely to be used for the purposes of catching dark wizards and witches and not for keeping tabs on your teenage nemesis.
Harry actually stopped dead in the hallway at the sight of Malfoy’s office. It was a strange thing to do, since Draco could easily have been doing just about anything else that he usually did at work and just wasn’t, right at that moment, at his desk. But the routine was a crutch for Harry, he would later come to realise. Each movement in the dance was tangible evidence that his feelings were
Ron sighed. “Lucius Malfoy is dead, Harry.”
Katie laughs and throws the cloth back at him.
“You bloody cheated your way into the team in the first place, scarhead,” Draco exclaimed, as Harry’s face burst into a sly grin at the outrage he had clearly evoked. “First years had been banned from house teams for decades but I suppose I should have known an exception would be made for Harry Potter.”
“I brought them here specifically to impress you,” Harry replied sarcastically. “I thought, as a Slytherin, you would have appreciated it. You lot seem to generally enjoy the dark and gloomy.”
“Don’t look at me like that, Potter. I know what you’re thinking,” Draco smirked.
Harry looks at her incredulously.
“Must you always cause a scene?” Ginny asks, shoving him out the front door.
Harry Potter was so
it better than me,” Draco said, whirling around to face Harry mid-way up the stairs, “you’re just willing to do more idiotic things to catch it.”
. Harry thinks this is rather harsh. “But my theory was right, wasn’t it?” Harry points out.
“I would rather read ten issues of The Quibbler each morning.”
Malfoy puts his drink down on the table and flips the cardboard coaster through his long, pale fingers.
As he gets closer he can hear the hooded person softly speaking to Katie and her sleepy laughter emanating in reply. She’s quite clearly leaning into the other person, and there’s something about it that looks platonic and supportive and Harry can’t really say why he thinks that but it’s just the overall impression he gets.
He rolls his eyes but tells Levi he'll cover the front in her absence. Less than ten minutes later she's back with him, smelling strongly of chewing gum and some kind of perfume charm.
Hermione looked at Ron sympathetically. Ron looked at Harry with what looked horribly like pity.
“Thank God I have you to guide me through my own house, Draco,” Harry remarked, following his lead.
in the air, all sinewy muscle and sleek blond hair. It was almost a shame to beat him. Practically speaking through, Harry had always been a more skilful flier. Plus, the Nimbus was never going to be a serious match for the newest edition of the Firebolt.
“Well I’m not
It's a very Malfoy-esque move, simply waving people and not acknowledging their existence, Harry thinks. He places the soy down a little rougher than anticipated and lingers longer than is probably necessary.
Malfoy snorts.
Hermione lifted the broom out of Harry’s left hand and appraised it. “I don’t think I even know where this one came from,” she said, in a concerned way before passing it to Draco who flipped it over between his hands.
Everything he wrote felt contrived, stiff and inauthentic. It felt like something Narcissa herself would write, Harry mused, although she probably went the extra step and wrote it all in French. Or blood. Maybe Latin. Latin was as archaic and useless as writing could get and there was hardly anything purebloods liked more than archaic practices.

almost every inch of it on his own and the aching swell of need pooled itself in his abdomen.
“Oh Merlin no, Draco,” he groaned, whipping around to see Malfoy move the curtain over the foreboding portrait slightly ajar. Harry’s hands involuntarily clamped tight over his ears.
Harry thinks this greeting is far too familiar for someone who fraternised with the person that killed her father, but he says nothing.
He stops to catch his breath and sees the lights flicker on a sleek, black sports car to his right. He stares, incredulously at Malfoy who is motioning for him to hurry up.
Harry’s frustration had unfortunately reached a breaking point. He was tired and irritable and completely overwhelmed by his irrational feeling of guilt for firing Perkins, his persistent self doubt about his ability to run the Auror office and his utterly nonsensical and insatiable desire for his former nemesis-turned-colleague. He had an irrational desire to pick up a beater’s bat and bash some bludgers or fight someone or set fire to the stack of unauthorised Harry Potter biographies sitting in the window of Flourish and Blotts.
Harry’s stomach lurched at the sight of Ron, dressed in his Auror robes and about to step out of the door to do real, practical work. He missed that thrill. Having an office job had made him feel useless, even if the tactical aspect of Auror work was just as critical as having feet on the ground.
“I can still see a snitch better than you,” Harry countered, playing on a predictable sore spot.
“Yes, well I suppose politeness isn’t very
Harry desperately hopes Malfoy thinks he has just had a momentary lapse in concentration and was not just obsessing over his tongue on a
It had been more or less two months after the kebab-eating, cigarette-smoking, testosterone- fuelled kissing session when Draco Malfoy swooped into Harry’s office, (completely uninvited, of course) to enquire about Harry’s weekend. Harry hadn’t ever recalled imagining so many possibilities at once. His brain almost exploded in the sixty seconds he took to answer the relatively basic question.
“I’m asking you,” he replies, insistently.
She tosses it back to him and he catches it.
“You shouldn’t be,” Draco replied from beyond the garage door. ”To you, my father was nothing but was cruel and prejudiced.”
“Is that a backhanded way of saying I interest you?” Malfoy asks. It’s a very Slytherin thing to say, Harry thinks. A Gryffindor would never assume such an inference.
“You know, I’m not really supposed to say this while I’m on shift-” the waitress started, smiling wryly.
Ron finishes his reports well before Harry and leaves the latter despairingly flicking through his last eighty-odd pages. By the time he finishes it’s noon, and far too late for a nap. What he really needs is a coffee, and that thought carries him from his office, deep in the bowels of the Ministry, to the chilly streets of Diagon Alley.
“Somewhat,” Harry agreed tersely.
that made him sound.
Draco’s hand moved from his cheek and Harry almost whimpered at the loss of the touch, but the fingers simply grasped the front of Harry’s jacket and pulled him back towards the brick wall. Responding so as not to break the kiss, Harry pushed forward, knees finding either side of Draco’s so he was quite literally sitting on top of him as Draco moaned deliciously into his mouth.
“I inherited it this way,” Harry said, motioning for Draco to follow him. “Don’t mind the initial gloom by the way, the previous inhabitants were apparently very welcoming.”
“Actually, I created the position myself,” Harry said, idly picking up a paper weight from Malfoy’s desk. “I thought that someone who works within the shadowy ranks of the media machine is more likely to be capable of managing it.”
“Draco Malfoy, this is
Harry snorts, “don’t have a pity party Malfoy, you’re bloody lucky to have escaped Azkaban and besides, no one ever

Draco looked up, a slightly suspicious look on his face. “What do you mean,
“Seven-thirty,” he corrects quickly.
“I’m having another,” he declares. “You owe me double now.”
“Hopefully they’ll say I took an interest in you after I realised you were becoming more famous than me,” Harry smirks, tossing her a paper menu.
wholesome and proactive, and seeing him nervously sink flutes of sub-par sparkling wine, was somewhat disconcerting.
Draco sat up on his broom and pretended to consider it, crossing his arms. “I think you’re supposed to be nice to people you’re dating, Potter.”
With the jangle of the door swinging behind Katie, he slumps into one of the vacant cafe chairs and sighs heavily.
Ron’s eyes flickered briefly to the roof.
Draco cocked an eyebrow at Harry’s face, which must have reflected some element of the frustration he was feeling. His body felt electrified with the closeness and the soft, pitifully brief kiss that Draco brushed against his lips just wasn’t going to cut it. Harry’s hand snaked its hand around the waistband of Draco’s dark wash jeans and, finding the small of his back, pulled his body closer.

“Anyway,” said Ron, clearly trying to change the subject, “maybe Malfoy doesn’t want to talk about it yet.”
Draco coughed loudly. “Potter, I hardly think that’s the issue. What if people see
Draco arched an eyebrow and lit the cigarette. “We all have our vices.”
“Oh for Merlin’s sakes,” Harry exclaims, “it’s called coffee!”
“But galleons were never part of your plea deal,” Harry says, convinced he has seen the Malfoy file before and never remembering a monetary figure appearing in the records.
“Maybe I’ll just wait until he brings it up,” Harry thought out loud, accidentally.
Harry was prepared to deal with an irritated reporter when he stalked down the hall to find office number seven. He wasn’t prepared for Draco Malfoy.
It wasn’t as if Draco and Harry were
“Working,” Malfoy says, simply.
“Great. I need one on Draco…” Harry pauses, trying to think of Malfoy’s middle name. He tries to recall the tapestry at 12 Grimmauld Place but is coming up blank. Upon reflection, he doesn’t think he ever knew it, but he could have a pretty safe guess. A family like the Malfoys surely thought themselves highly enough to give their children their own name. “
,” he said, taking a bite out of his own kebab.
“I suppose so,” Harry agreed, face still in his hands. “But how many direct orders have we disobeyed in our lifetimes, Ron?”
“I hardly think I’ll be taking driving tips from someone who doesn’t know how to drive,” Malfoy replies, as he smoothly rounds the last corner of the parking garage, indicates and pulls out onto Gerrard Place.
Ginny sighs heavily. “If i can
Draco pulled up next to him, bumping him into an outlying tree. Harry pushing himself out of the branches, laughed and tucked the snitch away into his pocket.
“I don’t know, I haven’t had a chance to speak to him about it,” Harry said crossly, shrugging away from her touch.
“Stop thinking,” Draco breathed as they came up for air, his ashy hair sticking slightly to his forehead.
“Me,” Harry said, raising an eyebrow. “You didn’t think I came here for fun did you?”
She pulls a stool out from behind her and motions for him to come around the counter and sit in the poky corner next to the coffee machine. He stumbles a bit on his way around.
“Why?” Draco demanded impatiently. “What was she talking about? Why does she know Mother’s name?”
“If we can’t get to your bedroom right now Potter, this is going to happen on the floor, and then where will your spine be?”
“No need, Auror Potter,” Kingsley replied in his deep voice, swiftly rising from his seat opposite Ron and vanishing the chair. “I was just leaving.”
Draco laughed bitterly again. “Do you seriously think he could be buried here, Harry? The grave would be desecrated in seconds.”
“They’re not the only problems you’re going to develop,” he heard Draco mutter as he pressed himself against Harry and collected his lips again, hands pinning Harry’s hips to the wall.
But even Draco Malfoy couldn’t have predicted the offer that Harry had put on the table that morning, and there was something so satisfying about catching him completely off-guard.
"Your coffee," he says, feeling very awkward in his own shop.
“I only meant to ask what his take on the media release would be,” Hermione continued, trying to soothe him by placing a hand on his back.
It’s with this thought that he ends up rifling through his closet before six in the morning, trying to find appropriate attire for an event that is at least twelve hours away. He finds nothing. Usually, he muses, a combination of a well-worn sweater and the only pair of jeans he owns would do. He has put on a few kilograms since he bought them, he supposes, but the stress of working two jobs necessitates a lot of snacking, drinking, forgetting to cook dinner and having Italian takeaway five nights a week. In retrospect, he’s surprised he hasn’t yet turned into a lasagne.
Harry is still at a loss for words and can’t even form a comprehensible thought except that Malfoy
“Un-invite him?”
At that moment Levi turns on the coffee machine and promises everyone espresso martinis despite not knowing how to use it and Harry goes and saves the day because, despite what Katie might say, he knows how to use the coffee machine competently enough. Levi pours very generous vodka shots and charms the magical blender to shake itself violently with too much liquid in it until there’s literally espresso martinis for everyone who has crammed themselves into the establishment and then some.
“This and that,” Harry retorts.
“Malfoy,
“I’m not sleeping with Draco Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, a bit louder than expected. He really never envisaged he would have ever said that sentence out loud.
“At least pretend to consider it, won’t you?” Harry said, turning to walk out of the office.
“Why?” Potter asked as he uncorked the wine anyway and poured himself a generous glass.
“Believe it or not, Potter, but the cup is incredibly difficult to win when the Headmaster insists on awarding Gryffindor seven million house points for having a person with a scar on their forehead,” Draco retorted.
Draco looked as if Walburga’s voice had literally stolen his own. Harry was briefly convinced that instead of kissing Draco Malfoy that afternoon, he’d be performing mouth to mouth resuscitation.
“Luciana,” he calls into the near empty hallway. His grey-haired secretary whisks in, notepad and quill at the ready. Harry thinks she always looks like there’s an emergency of some kind. She frowns at him.
“Well, it is sort of like the Batmobile,” Harry says before he can stop the words coming out of his mouth. He chastises himself for forgetting that Malfoy is an entitled pureblood and didn’t grow up as a muggle, stealing Dudley’s barely-read Batman comics and playing computer games set in Gotham City when the Dursleys were out of the house.
Harry’s scoffed. “Of course you find your relatives attractive,” he said darkly.
Draco looked incredulously at him. “Who
in the soft, white bed and deliciously warm on top of him? Were his usually compliant post traumatic stress related tendencies really rearing their ugly head when he would otherwise be revelling in the fact that Draco-bloody-Malfoy’s tongue was doing unspeakable things in his mouth and his heart felt simultaneously so full and warm and like it might spontaneously burst out of his chest?
work at his cafe, doesn’t he?”
“Maybe you say “thank you?” Harry continued, ignoring the incredulity.
Harry regrets trying to look so casual. “Kingsley,” he says, straightening up as the tall man rounds the corner. “Ron and I were just discussing our reports.”
"And don't spend all of your weekend at that cafe again," she continues, "or you'll come back just as sleep deprived as you are now. I know its almost Christmas, but we have to get that lot back to Shacklebolt in just over a week." She points to the mountainous stack of reports in the middle of Harry's disorganised desk.
Harry just grinned. “I can’t believe you remember that.”
“I’m sure the people would love to have me out there,” he deadpans.
he missed flying, he thought as he lead the way towards the empty lot on the edge of the woods. Someone, probably a bunch of teenagers, had set up crude Quidditch hoops that were a fraction of the height of normal ones. Harry grasped the snitch that was in it’s small locked box in his pocket and released it, chucking the empty box at Draco’s head when he had turned back to look at the hoops.
Katie appraises him whilst simultaneously frothing the milk. “I’d rate your energy levels as two-out-of-ten. I took off one point because your hair is a mess.”
Shutting the cabinet door, Katie stands up and looks him in the eye. “Draco
"So it could," Malfoy says simply. Infuriatingly, Harry thinks.
She turns to face him. "Look. We all have our vices, right? Yours is working a million hours a week and mine is having a cigarette every now and again." Her face is friendly but her tone says
“Forget what?” Harry asked, leaning in closer. For what, Draco wasn’t sure but he felt slightly intoxicated by the closeness despite being totally sober.
“Typically, you don’t continue to attend work after you quit,” Harry points out.
“How disappointing that Slytherin couldn’t win a house cup during your tenure, Malfoy.”
It’s oddly refreshing really. Harry feels like maybe next time Malfoy comes into the cafe he won’t be rude-on-purpose to him, even if he does drink soy.
“The lazy and the impoverished,” Harry retorted, throwing the charred remains of the kebab wrapper at him.
“Surely, for two Aurors, there are bigger fish to fry than Draco Malfoy being in someone’s cafe!” Hermione exclaims.
Undercover Aurors and bureaucrats were tricky enough. Journalists, in Harry’s opinion, were a whole other breed of difficult.
“Something like that, yes.”
“Merlin, Harry,” he remarked, the soft, aristocratic sneer edging into his tone. “First you declare your undying love for me before we’ve even kissed, and now you’re asking me to move in with you?”
“What?” He says, hoping he sounds incredulous but actually sounds like he is choking on an every-flavour-bean.
Draco closed his eyes briefly, sighed and turned around to face him, leaning back on the basin. “You, me, a bathroom. This is feeling oddly familiar,” he quipped, although the delivery was a bit cracked and scratchy. He tried to smile but it looked more like a grimace, Harry thought.
“You can’t
“Potter, can you please focus on making sure she doesn’t get a neck injury, or worse?” Malfoy hisses and Harry notices that Katie’s head is wobbling precariously off the side of his shoulder. “I’d ask you to do a sobriety charm, but those things are hell, so the very least you can do is make sure we don’t accidentally kill her.”
“I think it looks worse than it is,” he said, mostly to reassure himself. He whispered a quick
“Oook,” Ginny says slowly, in a way that makes it clear she thinks he’s a little bit stupid.
At that moment Harry spied golden scrawl on a handle in the back of the shed, reached in and pulled out a Nimbus 2001. Despite the mild panic attack he was still recovering from, he managed to smile. This ought to be good.
“Touchy, touchy, Potter,” he said softly, voice velvety as he stepped closer to Harry, whose back was against the wall opposite the cupboard, and ran the back of his hand over Harry’s cheek.
Draco snorted derisively. “She was far smarter than you before you ever got on a broomstick, Potter,” he said. “I’ve never seen Hermione’s potion work literally crawl away from her, and that’s more than I can say for you.”
“For Godric’s sakes Harry,” Katie replies, squatting back down to
“Hey!” Harry protested hotly, feeling as if his loyalty had been unfairly brought into question. “You’re the one who keeps prattling on about how good-looking they are.”
She looked at the blini uncertainly, and then frowned at him. “I’ll come back with something more suitable.”
Harry smiled, a little bemused. “I don’t know. Something normal,” he said. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
The shop has only been closed for five minutes, but it appears there is only one staff member left. Harry knows instinctively who is on clean up.
“So you didn’t fancy a trip across the channel?” he asked Draco, keen to steer the conversation away from the war. He was sure it was only a matter of expression, but it still made him slightly uncomfortable the way Draco referred to Voldemort as “the Dark Lord.” To Harry, it implied some kind of unshakeable reverence.
part. His brain feels weirdly disconnected from his body which is strange because he stopped drinking at least an hour ago.
, Harry thought. Was he seriously thinking about Voldemort? When, at that moment, he had a gorgeous, blond
He is only 25 for crying out loud. Why does he feel so
“But I-” he stammers, looking for reassurance.
He turned to Malfoy and grinned.
“On a serious note, Potter,” Draco said, arching an eyebrow again, “do you not think it’s somewhat problematic that I’m a reformed blood purist and you are...well,
Draco’s eyes flitted around the dark (albeit clean) entrance hallway apprehensively as Harry cast a required warming spell and lit the lamps down the passageway. He was about to make an insidious comment about Draco’s lack of sarcastic remarks when he heard the rustle of a curtain over his shoulder.
Ron and Hermione were somewhat perplexed at Harry’s choice of new work colleague. To be fair, Harry didn’t really understand it himself.
By twelve noon, Harry had done everything
for a Malfoy, Harry thinks, and he has to admit he kind of likes it.
Just as he is about to drift off into despondency over the dire state of his social life, fate deals him another blow.
Malfoy grins again. Harry wonders when Draco Malfoy’s smile turned from the ugly, smarmy expression he remembers from Hogwarts and into something that vaguely resembles friendliness.
Harry scoffed, looking over at him. “You practically invented cheating, Malfoy. I vividly remember you holding onto my broom at one point. I suppose you must have gotten me mixed up with the snitch.”
“You put your house under Fidelius?” he asked, and Harry was satisfied to hear an inkling of admiration in his voice.
“What about ice cream and chocolate?” Harry asks, wondering if Malfoy is one of those lactose intolerant people who are secretly gluttons-for-punishment and like to put their intolerance to the test.
“Are you going to be smashing those down next week at our Christmas party too?” he asks, raising an eyebrow.
The morning rush has subsided by the time Harry walks in, and he’s even more pleased to see Meldrid is nowhere in sight. Blearily, he casts a pleading look at Katie from in front of the register.
Harry also wonders how his rubbish sleep is going to make him feel later tonight, when he’s hopefully seven glasses deep in elf-made wine. It’s with this thought that his stomach lurches a tiny bit and he wonders if he really has developed the ability to predict his own hangovers. Then he realises it’s because he’s remembered that Katie decided to invite his sworn-enemy to his Christmas party. One that’s annoyingly well dressed, and despite Harry’s hopes, could actually decide to show up.
“I’m never coming back here,” Harry mutters. “I quit.”
. He was also acutely aware that Mr Grange was trying to stall him, and Harry was having none of it.
Spurred on, Harry’s tongue brushed lightly against Draco’s as he deepened the kiss, touching, taking whatever he could from a moment in time that he had previously thought was downright impossible. It was so ridiculous and yet so fucking
Draco looked back at him. There was a small quirk of an eyebrow and Harry held out his hand which Draco took and allowed himself to be drawn back to the top of the bed.
Draco stared at him. “That’s terribly polite.”
The youngest child of Dirk Cresswell, Katie graduated from Hogwarts a year ago, but has been working on her summer and winter holidays ever since her sixth grade. Harry suspects her hard working attitude is probably a combination of wanting to support her single mother, and trying to push the after effect of the war far out of her mind. He admires that. He's been trying to do the same thing, too.
,” Draco murmured.
Harry balks. Of course he isn’t. Even Draco Malfoy’s disappointment would be too much for him. Then again, Harry can’t help but wonder if Draco Malfoy would even be disappointed at being uninvited to an event hosted by Harry Potter. Harry thinks he may actually be relieved. Besides that, he knows Malfoy is a selfish prat and probably feels no urgent sense of obligation. Harry’s heart lightens.
Harry laughed. The whole sight of a Malfoy on
Harry wasn’t completely sure of the events that precipitated the return to his bedroom, but he wasn’t complaining. The tea, along with any mention of Draco’s foreign second cousins, had  been well and truly forgotten as they had lost themselves again in the peaks and valleys of Harry’s sheets until they’d wound up so exhausted and sweaty that Draco insisted the he
Harry thought, grinning broadly.
“Harry,” she said softly, eyes beseeching.
He stopped and sank back onto the couch. Merlin be damned. There was no denying it, Harry was absolutely screwed.
the butt of the cigarette and waved away the ash with his wand.
“I don’t think she should side-along like this, Potter,” Malfoy says pointedly. “I can get her home.”
“Oh,” said Harry, “I didn’t really think about that.”
Draco sighed. “It makes me numb.”
“He must be very persuasive,” Hermione said, frowning slightly.
“It’s
“The Ministry doesn’t supply Firewhisky,” Harry deadpans, “just an endless supply of work.”
“You know, you can call me by my first name if you want to-”
“Believe it or not, your mild disappointment pales in comparison to the difficulty of forcing three Aurors into witness protection, Malfoy,” Harry retorted, waves of hot irritation washing over him. It was so
“What now?!” Harry cries, clutching the back of his head.
“Are you jealous?” Draco grinned from over the top of his mug.
“Spare me,” Draco spat, “if the Gryffindor team hadn’t been so pathetic, you never would have got that stupid broom from McGonagall and we all would have been the better for it.”
Harry balks. He has half a mind to tell Katie where to shove the coffee on her person and go and do the dirty work herself, but he also doesn't want to appear afraid of Malfoy. She catches him staring.
He is permanently perplexed as to why Ron insists on acting as if he had never known about the existence of coffee. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t had it before. They’d even managed to squeeze one in on the run from Death Eaters in London after Bill and Fleur's wedding. A few months ago, Hermione had forced him to try another cappuccino at Harry’s cafe, and even though Ron complained that it tasted of dirt and hippogriff’s piss (how Ron had any idea what hippogriff’s piss tasted like, Harry wasn’t sure), Harry had noticed that he finished the whole cup.
Potter breathed a sigh of relief as the long, dark hair and obscenely high heels walked away.
Ron’s face is incredulous. “Harry, mate,” he says, exasperation lacing itself into every word, “I know you have that complex and all, but when it comes to the Draco Malfoy’s of the world, can you at least
Harry reciprocated and, coaxing Draco’s lips apart, felt the hot slide of his tongue and honestly felt as if he might expire. With their fully clothed bodies pressed up against each other he could
Harry bristles. “What? You? The person who let her get in this state?”
Katie, his seventeen year old barista, darts around the shop floor, levitating stacks of coffee cups and side plates, whilst absentmindedly wiping the tables with a rag by hand. Although Harry likes all of his staff members, Katie Cresswell is by far his favourite. She is hard working and diligent, and always there to pull the extra shifts when necessary.
As it turned out, Draco Malfoy wasn’t thinking about cleaning at all.
Then someone manages to turn the music up to an indecent level for a rendition of 'I Kissed A Girl' which, despite being a muggle song has apparently become the ubiquitous anthem for 20-somethings all over Britain, including ones with wands. Harry tries to shout at Neville that he doesn’t dance and anyway, he’s pretty sure Neville has never even
Exhaling slowly he turned to face Malfoy, almost involuntarily taking one of his hands with his own.
“Yet!” He exclaimed. Then, reigning in his exasperation, he muttered under his breath, “by Salazar you’re a twat, Harry Potter.”
Harry holds the interoffice memo in his hand and mutters a quick
Harry frowned. “I never said that!”
He watches Malfoy walk a little further down Moscow Road before ducking into an alleyway and mercifully ending up in one piece on the front step of Grimmauld Place.
whimpered, refusing to let go. Draco’s lips, deliciously red and swollen, smirked as he grabbed Harry’s wrist again, this time less gently, and pulled away from the wall.
“Nothing,” Draco said simply, expectantly, as Harry’s consciousness suddenly registered that it needed to quickly change tact and think of something,
They sat in silence for a long moment. Harry wasn’t sure what else was left to be said.
“So how did he...you know?”
“It’s ok,” Draco sniffed, cutting over Harry’s attempt at addressing the delicate situation. His lips touched Harry’s briefly again as one hand encircled Harry’s left wrist.
Malfoy stubs the cigarette butt out against the public bin and flicks the butt in. It’s very
Harry could sense Draco was becoming more agitated by the second. He had a thought.
Draco Malfoy found his antithesis in the maze of colourful canapés, downing another self-refilling champagne flute. Later, it would strike Draco that this sight was slightly tragic. Harry Potter was the unneeded hero in the midst of a brilliantly rebuilt world.
give you liver cirrhosis,” said Draco, inhaling again on his cancer-stick.
“Oh,” said Draco, conversationally. He picked up a book from Harry’s bookshelf and flipped through the pages casually. His attempt at nonchalance was admirable, Harry thought, but it wasn’t entirely convincing. He evidently hadn’t looked at the cover, for starters. He found Draco enigmatic, but Harry was fairly certain that he wouldn’t be interested in a book entitled: “Good Godric: The History of Gryffindor House.”
Harry hasn’t the faintest what that means, but ten minutes after quickly charming the doors locked and walking at an impressively brisk pace through Diagon Alley, out of the Leaky Cauldron and onto the streets of Muggle London, he finds himself chasing Malfoy through a parking garage, who’s inexplicably now carrying Katie in his arms and still managing to walk faster than Harry has ever walked in his life.
Draco turned to face him, registering Harry’s tight lips and furrowed brow. The pale grey eyes flickered with concern and, without saying anything, Draco cupped Harry’s cheek in his hand and leant in to brush his lips softly over Harry’s forehead. Harry’s face relaxed instantaneously.
Harry laughed. The thought of an old wizarding family like the Malfoys or the Blacks
“Gold star,” Harry says. “Put it on your promotion application.”
Harry James Potter,” she growls, “what on earth could you need?”
Daringly, he winked at Draco. “Are you ready to see the rest of this place?”
Malfoy doesn't look up. Twat.
“I wasn’t sure what to write,” Harry replied, feeling a bit stupid. He shrugged at Ron and Ron shrugged back, making Harry feel that perhaps he wasn’t alone in not knowing what to say when someone you didn’t particularly like packed it in but you just happened to be in love with their offspring. Such a circumstance required a very bespoke condolence letter Harry thought, and he had no idea how to even start one.
“That doesn’t make sense, Potter,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. He picked out a piece of lamb and chewed on it thoughtfully. “This is truly awful.”
, Ron.”
who it is immediately. A surge of something which he’s fairly certain is irritation but might actually be something else he can’t quite place rushes through him and he freezes on the spot and just says, “Malfoy.”
“I’m not-” Harry tries again, fairly sure his eyebrows have disappeared into his hairline.
“One up who?” Comes a booming voice from around the corner of Ron’s office.
for Potter to be like this.
“You still haven’t learnt to play fairly, I see,” he remarked, looking around for the snitch as they turned in parallel to climb higher into the sky.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, long fingers enclosing themselves around the parchment. “If I consider it, will I be working with you? Or working
"Right," Harry agrees, hoping to Merlin that things don't get to the level of desperation where he has to squeeze himself and his reports into Ron's office to engage in an all-nighter of report reviewing. He and Ron have only been out of the Auror academy for three years, but unlike the field work where their war experience helped them outstrip their peers, their attention to administration continues to leave something to be desired.
“So who is my second cousin, then?” Draco asked. Harry reflected that it was odd he was effectively introducing Draco’s maternal family tree to him. He wondered whether Narcissa had ever bothered to mention any of her family other than
“You are incorrigible, Draco.”
Harry stares. She looks pointedly at him.
“Why?” Malfoy snaps back, “I have no interest in getting someone ridiculously drunk, unlike you who clearly can’t manage to impart some desire for
“Are you going to do it then?” she asks, shooting him a furtive look.
“Doesn’t bitters have alcohol in it?” Ron asks, and Harry kicks him under the table.
“I’m not-” he started again, slightly panicked, “you
“I just-” he started, as Draco groaned and intently pressed his lips on the sweet spot near Harry’s clavicle. Harry was well and truly shut up by this and moaned softly instead of finishing his sentence.
“But where is she?” Draco asked obliviously. “I had heard rumours of a second cousin, of course, but they were rumours of a baby werewolf. I thought they were just made up by the other Death Eaters to further muddy Mother and Father’s reputation.”
there was something there that had never been there before. A spark, ignited in the act of pressing himself even closer to Draco that quickly became an out-of-control, burning need. Something that was totally incomparable and incapable of explanation.
“I was going to make a working hard or hardly working joke,” he said, sounding slightly concerned as he surveyed what Harry imagined was something akin to a troll’s cave, “but it turns out its not as funny if you’re actually working.”
For some reason he has decided to do the seatbelt back up like Malfoy is going to drive
He takes the latte gingerly and holds it in his lap. The warmth of the milk through the glass shoots through him and immediately makes him feel comfortable and tired. The opposite of the desired effect, he thinks, but it also might have to do with the fact that he’s so comfortable sitting here, in his cafe, Katie chattering away as she takes orders and makes coffee for the dribs and drabs of people making it through the December chill.
Harry hadn’t known Draco in the capacity of his would-be boyfriend for long, but he had known him long enough to recognise that this was an apology. He wasn’t as well acquainted with the words, but that suited Harry fine. In response, Harry shuffled slightly closer along the couch to rest his head on Draco’s shoulder and continued tracing imaginary patterns over the slim fitted, dark coloured denim that covered Malfoy’s legs.
“You’re really thick sometimes Harry,” she laughs as she returns to brick tapping.
we are talking about,” he said, voice thick with faux concern.
“Harry!” she exclaimed. “He’s your boyfriend for Merlin’s sakes, you have to say something!”
“Thats kind of the point,” Malfoy deadpans, “one cannot live on knuts alone.”
. In a conceited sort of way.”
Harry swallowed a chunk of kebab. “You’re not eating it right,” Harry said, “you have to eat it as a whole, not pick it apart like a vulture.”
“He bequeathed his only possession to me,” Harry replied. “I think he just didn’t want to give it to anyone else, to be honest.”
The employment search, meanwhile, shows up nothing. Which, as Harry and Ron discuss over what feels like their hundredth report, means Malfoy has to be unemployed. This is at odds with what Malfoy told Harry last Saturday, so it makes the pair of them all the more suspicious.
"Well," he says slightly tersely, looking for a way to escape the situation which his curiosity has created, "I hope they're not as tedious as they look."
Draco rounded on him. “What the
“I think you’d be surprised,” Katie says, but adds nothing to her mysterious remark.
“I think that room at the far end used to house a Hippogriff,” Harry said, grinning. “I don’t recall you two taking a great liking to each other, but please, be my guest.”
Once he’s satisfied Harry isn’t actually at risk of chundering, he speeds right back up and continues his death defying idiocy right back across London into Bayswater where he takes a sharp left from Queensway and around a few more corners and rolls the Lamborghini into an underground carpark off a very expensive looking street.
for the entire morning?”
Despite the unfortunate circumstances, Harry couldn’t have ever recalled feeling so good on a Saturday morning. Here, with his arms around someone he never in a million years would have counted on
“You really are an idiot,” Draco said. Harry noticed his voice was light but the sad smile still lingered. Harry hated that look. He wanted to kiss it right off his face.
Harry eventually wanders into the kitchen, chats to Levi for a bit and gratefully accepts an egg on toast. He’s mindlessly rearranging the drawer of spare mugs when Katie ducks her head in and asks Levi if he would mind covering for her out the front for 10 minutes.
Draco sighed and looked away again. “She wants to have him buried there.”
Opening a muggle-inspired cafe in the heart of Wizarding England had been a risk, but the business venture, so far, had paid off. The wizarding world had once again returned to their curious infatuation with muggle artefacts, and the coffee he sources from various specialty shops in London is of good enough quality it can coax away even the most ardent butter beer and tea drinkers. The cafe is usually full, and with Christmas shoppers inundating Diagon Alley in December, the business is struggling to keep up with demand.
Unfortunately for Draco Malfoy, Potter was never at a
“You don’t know what it’s like,” Draco sighed, flopping his head back onto the backrest. Thin strands of blonde hair splayed out over the fabric. “Being tasked to produce an heir and being the way that I am…”
story, Potter,” Malfoy snapped, bitterly. “I should have expected the quintessential overachiever to swoop in at the last moment to remind me that I am unworthy.”
"At your desk…in a cafe?" Malfoy asks, sarcasm rich in his voice.
Honestly, the way his life had turned out he was lucky to even have made it to his late twenties, Harry reflected.
“Ron, don’t be immature,” Hermione chastised, evidently disappointed at the interruption to Harry’s monologue.
“And do you have any muggle money on you?” Malfoy asks, eyebrows raised.
Harry didn’t think he had felt so conflicted in his life. Here he was, basking in the afterglow of a thirty minute tryst which had left both of them extraordinarily satisfied, and yet the anxious knot of worry had wormed its way back into his stomach and settled there like a rock.
“Sorry, I forgot my badge,” he said, with what Harry knew to be a feigned nonchalance. “So wait, Harry’s not gay? I’m disappointed. I thought we knew him better than that, Hermione.”
Hermione looked as if she might have suffered an aneurism. “Can you not say it in a nicer way Ronald?” she asked shrilly and then hissed to Harry who had started smirking, “I’m sure
Harry scowls. “I’ll be sure to pass your comments on to the owner,” he says, pushing himself back up to walk away. He honestly isn’t sure why he is bothering with Malfoy, of all people. He must be seriously losing the plot.
If Harry had to think about where it all began he would have said Madam Malkins. But the practical answer is that it started in late 2005, with a fight (typical, really) in the offices of the Daily Prophet.
Ron gave Harry a worried once-over and disappeared up the staircase.
lineal descendant,” he said, gazing back at the tapestry.
Hermione shrugged. “I wouldn’t rule us out yet, Ron.”
“Did you do an employment search?” Ron asks Harry while Hermione is finishing her sentence. Harry nods, but tries to turn it into a shake when he sees Hermione’s incredulous face.
“Well, he’s very good at it,” Harry pointed out for the twentieth time. “Someone has finally convinced the Prophet to run stories about something other than the Ministry’s incompetence.”
Ron smirked. “Not yet, you’re not.”
Draco grinned sardonically  in the semi-darkness and collected Harry’s lips with his own for a brief second. “Potter, I’m an only child. I never learnt how.”
"Is there a difference?" She asks. "You can't have a social life if you're always at work."
Harry already knew this of course, but he didn’t bother to let Draco know that.
That thought made Harry feel a bit selfish. Draco’s father, however questionable his attitude toward Harry may have been, had just
“Yes,” Malfoy says, “I’m lactose intolerant.”
"No problems," she says, ducking down to grab her coat and boots from under the cafe bench. "Don't forget the password though, I don't fancy waiting out in the dark again because you forgot it and had to change it again."
“How has your week been, Harry?” she asks. Harry knows that question is Hermione-code for
“There’s no way someone as pretentious as you is allergic to caviar, Malfoy,” Potter said, observant to a fault as usual.
“Well, the Ministry’s Ethics Committee might be a bit difficult about it, but Hermione and I worked out that it’s fine because I’m not actually your superior and-”
“No wait,” he said, although it didn’t come out as convincing as he’d hoped.
Katie hits him over the head with a tea towel.
On Friday morning he stepped out of the elevators at Level 2, mind already wandering dangerously close to the black hole which was his infatuation with Draco Malfoy. They had established a solid routine of barely acknowledging each other at eight-thirty, trading insults at twelve, making unnecessary trips past each others’ office at four and finally, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, turning up at Harry’s apartment around six to have dinner in a pretence of civility before snogging each other senseless.
“Happy Saturday, Draco,” Katie pipes up from behind the coffee machine. “The usual?”
Harry smiled. “Tomorrow, then,” he said. “We’ll do something conventional. I’ll be extra nice.”
Harry licked his lips.
“Er, no,” Harry says, confused as to why Ron would think two of the wizarding world’s most wanted criminals would casually turn up to his muggle-inspired cafe.
Malfoy’s head whips around and he cocks an eyebrow at Harry as if to say “what’s your business?” Harry actually feels irritated at that point because he’s really quite sick of people lifting their eyebrows at him today and even though he’s surprised to see Malfoy, Malfoy clearly isn’t surprised to see him, which means Malfoy has been lurking out here in the dark all night and
looks like, you pretentious wanker,” he snarls.
Twenty minutes later he stands by the kettle, fresh pot of tea brewing and wondering how he ended up living a life that was so far removed from the millionaire-bachelor that people expect of him. He wonders if those people really know how many times he wakes up so early it feels like lunch time when the sun finally pokes its rays through the gaps in the thick, heavy curtains of Grimmauld place.
“Ouch!” Harry complained, ducking for cover. “If you want to dish it out, you need to be able to take it.”
“But he is stylish,” Ginny points out, rummaging around in her cloak pocket for her wand with one hand and shaking soot out of her braid with the other. “Besides, I know that not everyone who is gay is stylish. Case-in-point.”
“I’m not-” Harry stammered slightly, his chest feeling constricted.
Harry realises that he is being somewhat dramatic, but there is something about his former school rival that has had the ability to irritate him by mere presence. Malfoy isn't the sort of being that could just pass through one's life unnoticed. He was more of an an annoyingly consistent character who knew the best ways to prod and poke and infuriate Harry at every conceivable occasion. Somewhat like a mosquito, really. Except taller, more aristocratic and less likely to actually suck your blood, although that wasn't conclusively ruled out.
Its a very boring and lack lustre reply, Harry thinks. He's never had Malfoy's wit, after all. But he does have much better flying skills, and he doesn't have a Death Eater as a father, and that is something to be thankful for.
“Thank you, Katie,” he says, in a tone that Harry thinks is too
“That’s fine,” Harry answered, a little too quickly. He never had been particularly tactful in awkward situations. “I just came by to grab my broom, and wondered if we could borrow another?”
He elects to simply ignore the question and crouches down next to Malfoy’s left knee and Katie’s head which has slowly started to sink down the side of Malfoy’s arm.
“Never mind.”
The first thing that registers with Harry is that Malfoy has a very nice tongue. It's a strange thing to think about a person, but it
Harry wasn’t quite sure where the issue lay. So instead he just threw caution to the wind and made the best assumption he could have, given the circumstances.
carking it?” Ron asked, once he had recovered from his random asphyxiation.
“No he’s not, Ron,” she says, rolling her eyes.
It turns out Harry is very scared. Malfoy’s normal driving is like a fucking maniac and it seems with every risky lane change or corner Harry’s heart is about to leap right out of his mouth. He actually has to close his eyes for one part and Malfoy slows down and asks him if he’s going to be sick on the leather interior.
“Of course you would scrap
“Great!” Harry said, with too much enthusiasm. “Not great! I mean, thank you, Minister.”
of me, Potter?” Malfoy quips, still grinning.
“It appears I’m still the last
Harry felt somewhat hopeless at his response. “I just do, Draco.”
He hoists Katie up to standing, one arm over his shoulder and snakes an arm around her waist for support. Harry eyes him suspiciously, hot, prickly anger coursing inside him.
. Malfoy has no reason to dislike Harry. If anything, Malfoy should
Harry tries to think on his feet. It doesn’t go well. “I don’t have anything better to do,” he says.
Harry sighs. “Coffee, Ron.”
“Yes well, thank Merlin for that,” Harry laughed again.
It worked.
Harry tries to look casual as he knocks on Ron’s door on Monday morning. When he hears a muffled “one second,” he opens it wide anyway and leans on the doorframe.
Harry doesn’t give it a chance to cool before he downs it as if it really were Firewhisky. It’s slightly too hot and he winces as it burns his insides. “How do I look?” he asks, after he recovers from the mild heartburn.
Harry watches her with absolute incredulity as she pulls her wand out deftly. “What?” she says, looking up at Harry’s expression.
“Not like that you idiot,” Draco continued, feeling Harry’s tenseness, “I just mean that you’re not from a pureblood family. Ensuring the continuation of the genetic line isn’t your
Harry sighed, but smiled. He didn’t want to take the risk and he had a feeling that if he could keep the conversation light hearted, it might not be a total failure of a night.
“So your mother is with your French
“It was seven-thirty!” Harry protests. “Stop being so dramatic.”
"Surely you don't need to work, Malfoy," he says, with a slight undertone, "your family Gringotts vault could buy you anything in Wizarding England."
“How generous,” he says, as she hands him the espresso shot.
rooftop with the most unrefined, greasy and delicious kebab in London was something he thought he would never see.
the plant. “Why?”
Harry looked a little stunned. Draco thought this was strange because if he had to hazard a guess, he would have thought this wouldn’t have been an out of the ordinary experience for the hero of the wizarding world. A hundred people in that very room would have gladly licked Harry’s shiny, black shoes at that very moment.
“You’re going to regret saying all of this in the morning,” Draco said, almost sadly.
“Oh, the shagging part,” Harry said, smiling. “Don’t worry about that. I just couldn’t handle her liking you more than me.”
“You walk like it’s a bloody Olympic sport,” Harry complains, practically jogging.
Harry supposed he should have seen the change coming. After all, things never stayed simple in his world for long. Harry hadn’t even managed to have a normal childhood before he’d discovered he was famous for being an indestructible infant and then thrown down the gauntlet to fight in a war he hadn’t started.
“Potter?” Malfoy says, sounding slightly concerned.
“Stop picking on me!” Harry wailed, eyes darting back and forth between his best friends.
Harry was tempted to say something very lovesick, but somehow avoided total embarrassment. He swore sometimes his brain told his mouth to say something, and the words got lost on the way there and came out totally differently.
"No," Harry replies, somewhat intrigued. "Why?"
“You’re the one who insisted on inviting Draco Malfoy for Merlins’ sakes,” Harry hisses, looking furtively toward the back table to make sure it isn’t occupied by a blond demon. Thankfully, the table is empty.
?” Harry asks, noticing Katie’s expression. “The sub-par drink options and general shabbiness of the staff will be enough to drive him away.”
He groaned and put his face back into his hands.
was quite frankly a crime. He wondered whether Malfoy had forgotten to tell him that his second cousins were also vision impaired.
“Yes, and the overconsumption of alcohol will
him. In spite of himself, Harry wondered how much further he could push his luck.
Had Harry reflected on his internal monologue pertaining to Draco Malfoy’s appearance, he might have described the man as
“Oh come
“What about them?” Malfoy asks, scooping a bit of froth up on the teaspoon and licking it gently.
Merlin, he's tired. He rubs his eyes and blinks stupidly at Luciana for a couple of seconds.
"Er no, my other job," Harry replies.
Hermione said nothing, but pursed her lips slightly. Harry knew this tactic well. It was a ploy to keep him talking.
“But you do think I’m good looking, don’t you?”
,” he continued, spying Harry opening his mouth again in his peripherals, “of mentioning the time you thanked me for it in front of Flitwick.”
shop is suspicious! It’s a muggle cafe!”
Harry beamed. It was as close to a “yes” as he was going to get.
“Only because I was insanely jealous of your special treatment,” Draco said, glaring. “Don’t get any ideas.”
“Ron! Don’t be so insensitive!” Hermione exclaimed, looking apologetically at Harry.
“Ssstill gonna give-me-a-raise?” she slurs through thick lips and what Harry imagines will be a very dry mouth tomorrow.
, it’s not as if he doesn’t see his be-speckled mug on every street corner most days, but he supposes it’s one of those endlessly practical things that Hermione buys in bulk and gifts to everyone. He makes a mental note to ask Ginny.
“You’re hardly impartial, you prat,” Harry muttered.
Harry choked on his drink. “What?”
The next thing Harry registers is that his eyes have become involuntarily transfixed. He tries to tear them away, but he fails. He feels like his eyes are being pried open like in that odd muggle movie Hermione made him watch about criminals and clocks. The cafe feels a million miles away. He tries to swallow but his throat feels simultaneously as dry as the Sahara desert and like it has a bezoar stuck in there. He remembers that Malfoy has asked a question but he can’t recall what it is.
photographer snapping pictures of them while they look at new broomsticks, Harry is having a good time. He doesn't even mind when Ginny goads them on by kissing him on the cheek in full view of everyone and the shutter clicks ominously from behind him.
Of course, Harry had no idea the kind of money the Prophet was paying their reporters. But the Ministry had a certain
Draco gave him another scathing look. Harry laughed and decided to change tact.
,” Harry says darkly.
Harry sighed. “I know. Should we go back to verbal sparring?”
him. They twitched unhelpfully. Malfoy pulled his hands back.
"No," Harry says, and then thinks about it again. Would he like Draco Malfoy to leave? It is obviously uncomfortable having him there, but then again, Harry has always liked keeping tabs on Malfoy, and from here it would be easy to see what he was up to. A tiny part of Harry's brain also wonders how many people have asked Malfoy over the years to go away. The thought makes Harry feel slightly guilty.
“I can un-invite him,” Katie says softly, swiping a cleaning cloth from the bench and picking at it with her fingernails, “if you want.”
Much to Hermione’s protestations, Ron managed to wrangle both of them out of the Ministry without too much of a hassle. He had insisted that Harry come home with them for takeaway on the couch.
Except.
“Well you haven’t even asked what
Harry had to admit, it was his own fault that Draco Malfoy had ended up as his colleague.
The fight wasn’t really his fault, Harry reasoned. Even if it was, he was
Draco sighed and lifted Harry’s face up to face his own.
“I want to-” Harry started, searching for permission somewhere within Draco’s eyes. They were so bloody close he had half a mind just to do it, but he didn’t want to discount the fact that he may have misread every single signal he had interpreted on that rooftop.
“God, your hair is even more haphazard in the morning,” he remarked, smirking.
"What are you doing here?" he blurts out, immediately regrets the awkwardness of it, and then realises one cannot literally eat their own words.
“Not sure,” Harry said hurriedly, evidently not catching on to the fact that Ron’s question had been entirely rhetorical. “Listen, have you seen Draco today?”
“Fine,” he mutters. But he’s not fine. His world is spinning slightly and he feels very out of his depth.
“Have you been drinking that energising, dirt-water again?” she asks in an accusing tone.
that all Harry could do was hope to Merlin that it wouldn’t be the last time because he needed this as much as (well, maybe not breathing) but at the very least his broomstick and friendship and meaningful employment.
shower immediately. Harry had insisted on joining him and before they knew it they’d overstayed their welcome because the hot water had suddenly run out and they had to make a hasty retreat back to Harry’s bedroom, cursing the sub-par pipes and Harry’s inability to remember the spell that would rectify the problem.
He holds up a thick, blue and gold sweater from Molly emblazoned with the letter “H” and decides that perhaps it is time to invest in clothes that he actually purchases with his own galleons. As with the skincare and the vanity and the countless other miscellaneous items in his house, nothing seems to have been intentionally put here by him. Plus, he could use the time to do his usual last minute Christmas shopping. He makes a mental note not to buy Ron another set of dragon-hide gloves this year.
Harry snorted. He felt immature bickering with Draco about Hogwarts house rivalries, but he supposed it was a legitimate pursuit since the houses went back however many hundreds of years (he never had gotten around to reading “Hogwarts: A History,” much to Hermione’s disdain).
They sat in silence for a moment before Draco’s attention was brought back to the task at hand.
is linked to caring what a posh, judgemental, former Death Eater thinks of him. But then again, Harry is self-reflective enough to know that not liking someone and not caring what they think are two different matters entirely. Arguably, Harry has always cared
“Yes.”
“I didn’t force you to,” she protests, dropping her wand hand mid-spell and scrougifying the menus stacked under the sink instead of the countertop. “You wanted to!”
Harry grinned.
Harry was admittedly as shocked as Draco looked at this point. He had never imagined that Walburga would finally be happy with a visitor to the house, and the thought made him feel irrationally angry. To be fair, he hadn’t heard anyone express an ideal aligning with pureblood rhetoric in a while, so the words felt like a distant memory coming back to haunt him.
“I thought you said I had to buy them,” Harry protests.
She cocked her head slightly.
“I’m not sure what else to say,” Harry said, matter of factly. “What does one usually say after a profession of admiration?”
“Since a while,” she says, waving a hand dismissively but looking somewhat guilty.
The thing is, despite the inquisitive stares and the occasional autograph requests, it really isn’t that bad, Harry thinks. In fact, despite catching a
“It depends,” Harry says. He’s about to mention something about trying to murder a headmaster, poisoning one of his best friends and vanishing cabinets but he stops himself just in time.
He ran a thumb over Draco’s cheek. “I’m sorry. You’d need to get back to your mum-”
"Have a nice weekend Luciana," he says, attempting a smile. She looks back at him, one eyebrow raised.
Predictably, Draco took the bait. “Well you’re as blind as a fucking bat, Potter.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, throwing caution to the wind. “It makes absolutely zero sense. Don’t get me wrong, it would be much easier for me if I didn’t feel this way about someone who, until recently, I thought I had spent my whole life despising.”
“What insult have you got for me today?” Potter greeted him, smile slightly wonky.
Malfoy deposits Katie gently onto Harry’s lap and shuts the door.
“Kiss me, you idiot,” Harry breathed, desire coursing so strongly through him, he was finding it difficult to stay vertical. He swore his imagination was running away with him because it was hard to believe he was standing in 12 Grimmauld Place, bailed up against a wall, wanting to do absolutely filthy things to one Draco Malfoy.
Enjoying Draco’s newfound silence, Harry inclined his head and trailed a series of kisses up Malfoy’s neck, gently pushing aside the neck of the black long sleeve which covered Draco’s torso with his free hand.
Harry’s stomach flipped uncomfortably. “Andromeda was blasted off by Walburga, I think,” he said. “She married a muggleborn.”
Malfoy sniggered. “You can’t have been very successful at managing the media, Potter. Your strike rate with me is only about fifty percent.”
father that had just died so he really wasn’t in the position to make any sort of suggestion. Grief was a weirdly personal thing, in Harry’s view.
Harry honestly doesn’t know how to respond and just says “er, yeah i guess” like the idiot he is, and next thing he knows they’ve pulled up outside Katie’s flat and Malfoy is rummaging around in her bag, fishing out a key, picking her up off his lap and carrying her up into the house.
“I heard you the first time, you troll,” she says, matter-of-factly.
Hermione glares at both of them. Harry raises both of his hands in instant capitulation.
"Yes," Katie, all matter-of-fact and tapping the milk jug on the bench to diffuse the bubbles in the foam, "now be a good staff member and deliver this to him won't you?"
“Yeah, right, I should probably um-” Harry replies, a little flustered because he should have thought of that earlier but he actually quite likes sitting in the Gallardo and weirdly, talking to Malfoy.
, but he gets dragged into the throng anyway.
"Oh," Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he can detect a hint of disappointment in his voice. "Because the milk is lukewarm."
to make sure he passed the muggle certification standard and Harry has to quickly remind him that Harry really is an Auror and
A wave of irritation crashes over Harry and suddenly he doesn't give a damn about professionalism. He has to nip it in the bud, because the cafe simply can't afford Meldrid two-point-oh.
Harry had heard it was good practice to keep your friends close and your enemies closer and it was similarly good for the Ministry to keep someone as conniving and convincing as Draco Malfoy out of the media industry and under close watch. As an added bonus, Malfoy ended up being extremely good at managing the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s PR.
Harry couldn’t help it. The frown he was wearing a second previously broke out into a smile that felt as if it stretched from one side of his face all the way to the other.
Draco dropped the pillow and smirked. “Yes?”
Harry wasn’t quite sure what kind of physical contact was going to be okay in that moment, so he just shuffled slightly closer and rolled over onto his side to face Draco. Feeling blindly through the sheets, he tentatively found his hand and threaded their fingers together, running his thumb up and down Draco’s forefinger.
“Oh?” Harry asked, pouring the tea into two mugs and handing one to Draco. He crossed the room and dropped himself onto the chair opposite. “You don’t like your second cousins?”
Harry and Ron look at her with varying levels of outrage.
“You’re fired,” he says, flicking another cloth at her.
Harry swore he almost suffered a cardiac arrest (Hermione would later tell him that he was being overly dramatic).
Harry streaked into a dive and collected the small, black receptacle and tucked it back into his pocket. “Lost your touch?” he yelled over his shoulder.
Winking mischievously, she pats him on the shoulder and says, "just don't tell my mum, okay?"
“What happened last night?” Harry asked, now feeling a bit thick.
“Why didn’t you tell me you owned this coffee shop, Potter?” Malfoy asks in his infuriatingly relaxed drawl and Harry is quite put off by that question because in all honesty he isn’t quite sure why.
Harry has a slight crisis. He hasn’t even
“There’s a plural of sanity?” Harry asked, politely. Hermione, mouth still agape, was looking from Ron to the paper to Harry back to the paper.
"Sod off, Malfoy," Harry mutters and stalks back to the kitchen.
“RonandHermione’s,” Harry mumbled, almost incoherently. He moaned softly as Draco bit down lightly on the sensitive spot on his neck.
Despite his fatigue, Harry grins. He knows Ron is ecstatic about Hermione's pregnancy, but Harry has no doubt that Ron is not the most well equipped person to cope with any sudden, hormonal outburst.
“Yes, but he didn’t know it’s Harry’s cafe, Ron,” Hermione says slowly, as if Ron and Harry are struggling to comprehend simple logic. “And I can imagine Malfoy would like exotic things, and Harry’s cafe is somewhat...different.”
“Hello Draco,” she said, coolly.
you would have known this six hours ago.”
Malfoy snorts. “Well Potter, when a civilisation has been brought to the brink of destruction, the powers that be generally need an injection of funds.”
Malfoy narrows his eyes. “You do realise she’s an adult who is perfectly capable of making her own decisions.”
None of that means he isn’t strictly heterosexual, though. It just so happens that all of the people that he’s rejected over the years are women. Nothing more.
That was today’s task, once Malfoy had reached capacity with him (or the house, whichever was more abrasive) and decided to leave.
Inside the drawing room, he led Draco to the imposing, richly embroidered tapestry that covered the entire right wall. Releasing his hand, he stood back as Draco stared, transfixed at the thin, golden lines that connected the various names. He reached out carefully to trace the strand that connected
Katie, very fortunately in Harry’s opinion, chooses that moment to interrupt to tell Harry that she’s closing off the coffee machine. It used to be that Harry would tell her what time to shut off the machine and pack up. Now, he muses, she tells him what to do.
“She told me,” Malfoy deadpans. “I’m sure you’d like to hear about me stalking her, but it’s all very mundane.”
Draco batted it away.
. “I suppose he didn’t know it was my cafe,” Harry says, emerging from his internal argument.
“I’ll try to remember that for next time,” Harry replied, inching closer on his broom.
She laughs and shoves him in the side, then turns and sticks a cigarette in her mouth and saunters out to the side of the shop which has been turned into a makeshift smokers area. He wants to say something but doesn’t, as he watches her flop down on a bench next to a mysterious looking character in a hooded cloak who Harry can’t quite get a glimpse of.
An additional benefit was that he was in the midst of a seemingly futile attempt to make the house liveable. His rooftop flat, despite its obvious allure, had never really felt like home to Harry. 12 Grimmauld Place was more familiar, but Harry had steadfastly avoided trying to make it habitable due to both the painful memory of Sirius that permeated the place and the fact that he was yet to find a way to remove the family tapestry, Walburga’s portrait and the elf heads.
home too and suddenly the offending item is trapping him in a death grip. He has half a mind to
“Nah,” Harry says, smiling at the thought. “Malfoy is an arrogant git. He’ll have something much more important to do, I’m sure.”
“Draco Malfoy, man of the people,” Harry remarks.
Draco turned his head to face him. “No, you halfwit,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Don’t you think it’s somewhat problematic that I’m supposed to be copulating with a rich, pureblood witch, but instead I’m obsessed with the idea of sleeping with you?”
it off of himself but he’s fairly certain that Malfoy might actually try to murder him for ruining his car and then they’d have to duel in the middle of Stoke Newington and the Ministry would have to obliviate everyone in sight.
The Department Head was initially stunned at his suggestion. Harry conceded that requesting high level security clearance for a former Death Eater was pushing it, even for him. But then again, the benefit of being the Chosen One was that his judgment was rarely ever seriously questioned. After that, all he had to do was convince Malfoy that working for the Ministry was a more prestigious career than consistently trying to undermine it.
Draco scoffed. “Are you sure you are referring to yourself, Harry Potter? There’s only about seventy million witches and wizards globally who would profess their undying love for the saviour of the wizarding world.”
“I am?” Harry asks, wondering why his attempt at nonchalance is unsuccessful. He is leaning against a doorframe for Merlin’s sake. That’s the universal symbol for being supremely casual, isn’t it?
together, we hate each other, we’re not even
Hermione puts her hands to her temples and closes her eyes. “It’s an
“There’s a few hundred more in there, Hermione if you’d care to join us,” Harry said innocently.
“Unlikely,” he replies, “hangovers get worse as you get older, remember that.”
“So your life’s mission is to produce an heir?” Harry asked, reaching out to absentmindedly trace a pattern on Draco’s unblemished right forearm. Malfoy’s eyes closed as he twitched at Harry’s touch, but didn’t move.
and a
“No it isn’t,” says Malfoy bluntly. “Don’t be a prat, Potter.”
Then again, Draco was not the courageous one. He had a habit of sitting back and waiting for things to happen.
Malfoy looks at him for a split second and then bursts into peals of very un-Malfoyish laughter at what Harry can only imagine is the horrified look on his face. It’s sort of disarming the way that the usually haughty, aristocratic face is broken into an unguarded look of pleasure, even when it’s at his expense.
“It’s ok!” Harry insisted, “I’m not upset that he kicked the bucket.”
Harry bit his lip briefly. It was certainly something he had stewed about for weeks, months even. That he could even be on good terms with someone who, whether Harry liked it or not, had innocent blood on their hands. He hadn’t been planning on opening that Pandora’s box tonight, however. It just wasn’t that simple to explain.
“Seems reasonable,” Ginny replies, poking her head out from the underside of the table and placing the plant gingerly back on the table top.
Draco did a quick assessment of the situation. Potter’s suit looked relatively unscathed but his eyes were slightly glassy and cheeks flushed. On a scale of sober to needing immediate evacuation, Potter was sitting precariously on the fence between happy-go-lucky and unable to apparate. Of course, it was easy to make such assessments when Draco was stone-cold sober.
“Er,” Harry started, as his Kinglsey appraised him suspiciously. “I’ll just wait outside.”
peanut butter) and fire-calls Ginny at the completely reasonable hour of seven-thirty.
Katie cocks an eyebrow. "He comes in almost every Saturday," she replies, amusement flickering in her intonation. "Only, you wouldn't know that since you usually drop in at eleven and leave at twelve."
Of course, Draco never stayed long after that. He would floo back to the Manor and the charade would begin again the very next day. In a stunning turn of events, weekends had become Harry’s least favourite days of the week and he sulked around his house (and occasionally sulked around Ron and Hermione’s house) until Sunday night when he felt oddly buoyant at the thought of going back to work.
“Watch it, Potter!” he exclaimed as the missile missed him by centimetres, thudding to the ground.
“Harry,” Draco replied, lowering his lips still, “please shut up.”
He pushes himself up off the arm chair and is relieved when the furniture doesn't tip. Those extra kilograms Molly force feeds into him haven't done too much damage.
In the end, fearing that he may be more emotionally inept than Hermione had ever accused Ron of being, he dropped his quill back into the ink pot and gave in to the mountains of tedious paperwork that he was actually being paid to do. He did question, as he worked, why wizards hadn’t managed to harness the muggle technology of mobile phones. A lot quicker and a lot less formal than owl post.
to find out,” Malfoy says insolently and slams his pint glass back on the table, empty.
“You complete idiot, Harry, you’re going to catch a cold,” Hermione had chastised as she pulled him inside, out of the rain and blasted him with a drying charm.
for Malfoy. It’s not as if he doesn’t deserve it. “Maybe you just like to annoy me,” he says lamely.
"Sure," she says, shrugging her shoulders, "Only because i know the chances of that happening are roughly the same as me winning a billion galleons."
Draco let out a little sigh and reached a hand up to rub his face. “Your arm weighs a tonne, Potter.”
Harry thought of Narcissa, and a wave of guilt crashed over him again. Of course Draco should be with the family he had left. It was just that Harry had this inexplicable need to try and make it better. To try to help heal the wound and make Draco feel whole again.
“Are you okay?” Malfoy asks, a small smirk playing on his lips.
“Did he slither out of there once he realised?” Ron asks, eyes suspicious.
It wasn’t like they had never had kissed other people, or touched, or been touched by other people. Harry was the first to admit he didn’t exactly have a plethora of sexual partners or intimate experience but that was largely due to the fact that he had been engaged in outright warfare for a good portion of his teenage years.
“Get in Potter, we’re going to have to put her on your lap,” Malfoy instructs, and Harry is quite honestly too dumbstruck to do anything but comply.
“What, talking?” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow in the fashion Harry was so used to. “What a crime, someone alert the Ministry.”
Harry sat back up and looked at him quizzically. “You know that is truly awful for your health, right?”
Draco appeared to have undergone a personality transplant in those preceding minutes because he was, all of a sudden, very compliant. No sooner had Harry requested it but Draco’s mouth was on his, lips moving deliciously slowly as he explored Harry with his tongue.
“Oh. You’re still here,” he says upon seeing Harry.
She smirks, handing him the coffee mug balanced on a large saucer. The soy's nutty fragrance wafts up from the expertly poured latte art that stares at Harry as he accepts his fate.
“Talking comes later, Potter,” he heard Draco whisper as his lips trailed kisses further down Harry’s chest as his hands found Harry’s belt buckle and released it easily.
“You’re welcome,” he said, grinning facetiously, but didn’t remove his hand from Draco’s skin.
“I thought Malfoy’s didn’t beg,” Harry replied, but he leaned in anyway.
part?” Draco asked, incredulously.
In summary, he felt obscenely fragile.
From time to time, Harry Potter admitted to himself that there were perks to being the youngest Head of the Auror office in over a century. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Magic Christmas party of 2008 was not one of those times. As soon as he had shed himself of his cloak and stepped into the Ministry’s dedicated event space, he had realised that the night would inevitably be full of compliments regarding his recent appointment, to which he would unintentionally respond in such an awkward fashion that he wished he could
“Do you want to go flying?” Harry asked, to break the tension.
“Good night, Potter,” Malfoy says, and sticks out a hand.
a nice shade of pink, Harry thinks as Malfoy's tongue delicately darts along the silver utensil.
“So do you, you idiot.”
He has half a mind to tell him to leave. What would a former Death Eater want with an establishment like this? Harry half wishes in that moment the shop was as busy as it had been twenty minutes ago, then he feels as if he wouldn't have had the time to be simultaneously stunned and curious as to why Malfoy was currently sitting at table twenty-one and lazily flicking through a stack of papers larger than Harry's report pile at the Ministry.
“Why would you hex me?” Harry asks, pleased that he hasn’t been hexed but perplexed as to how Ron believes hexing anyone in the Auror office, possibly the safest place in all of Wizarding England, is necessary.
A small part of Harry glowed. Draco had evidently made a standing commitment to being here, even in circumstances where it would have been completely rational to fail to show up.
Harry snorts derisively in response. “Like I’m going to believe that you haven’t been plying her with drinks all night, Malfoy. Seems like something you’d do.”
Luciana gives him a reprising look and backs out of his cramped office. "Auror Potter," she says, curtly turning on her heel and striding down the corridor.
Perhaps it had been a mistake to bring Draco here, Harry thought. However, he reasoned, it was the perfect place for a rendezvous seeing as nearly no-one knew it existed.
“You’re the one threatening to fire your only barista on a weekend shift,” Katie points out. “That’s fairly dramatic when you don’t know how to use the coffee machine properly.”
“What?”
“Slimy git,” says Ron, who evidently hasn’t reviewed his choice of insults since Hogwarts. “What’s his business in a muggle cafe?”
for Godric’s sakes.
“Harry!” she said, at a loss for words, gesturing wildly to the mountain of paper covering his desk and floor.
“Are you finished?” Harry asks, narrowing his eyes, but he can feel the shadow of a smile on his lips anyway and bites into his bottom one to avoid it showing up on his face.
of all people, being in
"Noted," Harry says, waving her out the door.
“He’s definitely up to something, Harry,” Ron says, ignoring Hermione.
Hermione and Ron didn’t say anything. They just stared at him in a way that read
“If you insist, I can volunteer to write the weekly Harry Potter trivia questions,” Malfoy said, contemptuously. “I’m sure that’s what you consider to be legitimate reporting.”
“I’m not-” Harry started, then paused. He wasn’t sure if it really was the right time to say it because he wasn’t sure if they had really established what kind of arrangement they were carrying on here.
to think of wasted career opportunities before people’s safety.
Malfoy shrugged. “Objectively speaking. Please stop putting so much sugar in your tea it really is ghastly and all your teeth will fall out.”
cafe and if he doesn’t feel like dealing with Draco Malfoy on the one day of the year he intends to let his metaphorical hair down he shouldn’t have to.
“Filth! Scum-”
Draco nodded mutely, and that’s how they ended up disapparating to the wizarding village where Hermione and Ron’s cottage was and rapping on their door at midday.
“Interestingly, The Quibbler is reporting that Lucius died of a particularly vicious Nargle attack.”
After another five minutes had elapsed, Harry grew sick of thinking about death. So he picked himself up off the bed and went to look for Draco who was spending a suspiciously long time in the bathroom. He found the latter with his hands spread out over the basin, staring at his reflection in the mirror.
“No,” Harry replied, smirking as Draco’s frown deepened and he flipped to look at the cover of the book. Upon reading the title, he quickly thrust the book back onto the bookshelf as if it had spontaneously burst into flames.
Draco’s face twitched quizzically. Harry wondered if Draco was trying to envisage cleaning a house without a house elf. This, Harry thought, would have been a difficult task for someone who had probably never learned a household charm in their life, or so much as seen a cleaning product.
“You know I can’t say those things back to you,” Draco murmured. “I just can’t.”

“You did?” Ginny asks inquisitively from below the table as she
As it turned out, they did manage to make it to Harry’s bed, and Harry was saved from a certain herniated disc. He wasn’t particularly concerned with that fact, however as he allowed himself to be ravaged by Draco’s hands and his mouth. He felt like he was drowning in the most pleasurable way one could drown; lightheaded, unable to draw a proper breath and absolutely saturated with the presence of someone who made his body feel like it was floating. Like it wasn’t really attached to Harry’s head and it had a complete mind of it’s own.
Harry watched, stunned and transfixed, as Walburga’s ugly blanched face contorted into something which Harry presumed was supposed to be adoration. He had certainly never seen such an expression worn by the portrait, nor had he ever heard her be so benign.
to stop it from happening.
“No,” Draco said simply, as he reached his spare hand into his jacket pocket, “I just don’t want to forget.”
He replies quickly, scratching out his own interoffice memo.
Draco looked at him disdainfully. “You’ve drunk three quarters of that bottle since we’ve been up here,” he said. But he didn’t remove his hands from Harry’s.
“It’s not that strange, is it?” Malfoy asks. “You’re working.”
She rolled her eyes. “Come on, Harry. You know as well as I do that your
Harry raised his hands in mock surrender and leant back on the couch. Draco sighed and sat down beside him, resting the back of his head on the backrest and looking toward the ceiling.
“Anyway,” he says, swiftly changing the topic, “explain to me about these
“Since when do you smoke?” Harry asks as she pulls a thin packet out of her bag below the back counter.
Harry has half a mind to scurry away but Ron’s glare stops him.
Harry, who had admittedly been trying to distract himself with his long-neglected administrative work, cringed at the sight around him. It looked as if he had been playing exploding snap with his reports rather than reading them.
“Come on,” she replies, smirking, “everyone loves a reformed Death Eater.”
“I’m not sure, to be honest,” Draco replied after a minute. He still looked ridiculously shocked, an expression Harry was fairly sure Draco had never worn for this long. “I’ve never had it happen before. What do you say?”
"Look, I have to go home first and help Hermione make dinner," Ron says, roughly levitating and dropping various stacks of paper around his office, "but after that we should get a pint. We did that interview of one of the Kelley brothers' known contacts today, not to mention," Ron's voice drops to a whisper, "Hermione's dead scary at the moment. This baby's getting to her brain I think."
Harry couldn’t help it, the guilt had well and truly set in.
“You might be surprised,” Katie says optimistically.
“Hello Harry,” Hermione said as she answered the door, then noticed Draco lurking in the background, looking supremely uncomfortable.
justified in his reactions considering the situation at hand. At the time, he had been in the thick of organising a handful of unruly undercover Aurors to simultaneously build a case against a group of international Felix Felicis smugglers and the Welsh national quidditch team. The case, which had been two years in the making, was coming to a head with the 2006 Quidditch World Cup on the near horizon. Harry had already been managing the relationship with the International Quidditch Federation and its long list of stakeholders. The last thing Harry wanted was to suddenly be responsible for managing a leak to the Daily Prophet.
His skin looks unnaturally sallow and is adorned by dark purplish green under-eye circles which make him look like he’s been gently beaten up. What a sight, he thinks, as he grabs a bunch of muggle skincare products Hermione gave him the Christmas before and tries to work out which one goes before which and why all of the things in his house appear to have been gifted to him.
or stupid, or whatever you think it is,” Harry said, pausing to gauge a reaction. Draco’s face remained stoic. “But whether I like it or not, I’m
Harry groaned. He was finding this painfully difficult, and he had a sneaking suspicion Draco knew what he was getting at was just goading him into it, like usual.
“Somewhat messy how Aunt Bella killed him, wasn’t it?” Draco mused, completely oblivious to how such a statement might be painful for Harry to consider.
Draco Malfoy, astonishingly, did what he was told.
“You could have had all the free drinks you wanted at
“Ron told me about Perkins,” she said. Harry buried his face in his hands. The disobedience of a direct order meant immediate dismissal, they all knew that. But Harry felt sick to his stomach when he had delivered that news to Perkins. He’d never imagined when he joined the Aurors at the tender age of seventeen that he would be responsible for firing people.
Not that they needed to know, Harry thought. It wasn’t as if he and Draco ever sat down and talked about their feelings or their absurd attraction to each other or at what point they decided it was acceptable to secretly meet up to snog each other to death at work. It wasn’t as if Draco Malfoy was his boyfriend (although Harry was, by that point, hopelessly in love with him). Hell, Harry wasn’t even sure if he was gay. It didn’t really matter much to him anyway, because he definitely wasn’t seeing anyone else.
“Are you sure you’re not scared?” Malfoy says with a smirk, as he turns back to face the empty street and revs the engine.
“Hello,” Harry whispered, touching his lips to the back of Draco’s neck again.
“I’m cleaning up an old house,” said Harry, without really thinking. As soon as the words had left his mouth he had the stunning realisation of how acutely
“I don’t really want to think about it properly yet,” Draco said, flipping over to lie on his back, grey eyes staring at the ceiling.
“I’m not the one who needs to make reparations,” Harry mutters, scowling.
Draco scowled and went back to peering into the cupboard.
“I didn’t buy it,” he explained. “I acquired it under a Will.”
“Watch yourself,” says a familiar voice and Katie comes bounding over to them.
“What?!” she protests, daring them to disagree with her.
“That’s because he’s a slimy git,” Ron chuckled, grabbing his field bag from the table. “See you later, Harry.”
Harry stiffened.
“Oh that one doesn’t open-” Harry started, before being lost for words as Draco easily opened the door.
grass clippings and leather polish.”
"Malfoy drinks soy?" Harry says, eyebrows raised in surprise. He can't help it. His Auror training is going into overdrive and he's making a lot of assumptions about Draco Malfoy's personality right now. He doesn't necessarily need to, in hindsight, he has suffered from Malfoy's personality for years on end, however this piece of evidence doesn't fit the profile, Harry thinks.
Harry’s chest constricted slightly and he felt the warm rush of desire invigorate his limbs. He still wasn’t completely used to the unsettling mixture of anxiety and a burning hunger to push Draco (or Malfoy, whichever Harry felt like) up against his office bookcase and do things to him that definitely weren’t within the Ministry’s code of ethics for appropriate workplace conduct.
. Then Ginny comes up on the makeshift stage and kisses him on the cheek and announces to everyone that in fact, they’re getting engaged, and everyone laughs. Harry shouts everyone down and insists they’re not really getting engaged and Ginny stomps on his foot and tells him of course they’re not and everyone clearly knows that and he needs to remember how to recognise a joke. His eyes water a bit but it’s okay because everyone claps and tells him he’s a
Potter said nothing, and simply looked down at his drink with a stoic expression. Draco approximated that without intervention, Potter wouldn’t be doing anything worth watching tonight. Except, perhaps, falling over his own feet, which Draco would much rather have watched from a safe distance.
“Drop it, Potter,” Draco snapped. Harry recognised this as Draco effectively compartmentalising. Harry had learned that Draco Malfoy was remarkably good at shutting off things that he didn’t want to address, sort of like an internal version of occlumency.
“If they’re so gorgeous, why are you avoiding them?” he asked, trying to sound more blasé about the exchange.
“Good evening to you too, Potter,” Draco replied, nodding an eager, canapé-holding waitress onwards. It felt
“If that’s from Auror Weasley, tell him he needs to work on his aim,” she huffs, stalking out of his office.
“Teddy,” Harry said, proudly. “He’s not a werewolf, but he is my Godson.”
, Hermione,” he said at last, putting his mead down on the table. His left hand joined his right in attempting to tear out pieces of his hair.
Draco noticed that Harry had arranged his face with the usual polite, public facing façade.
“Do you need me to leave?” he hears Malfoy ask Katie. Harry wonders when Malfoy became considerate.
“Is it going to accost me again?” Malfoy asked, staring at the abnormally high ceilings with suspicion.
Potter shrugged. “I am terribly antisocial.”
Kebab beside him, he gestured for Malfoy to take a seat somewhere on the expanse of green plastic.
Harry momentarily lost his ability to think. He leant in, intoxicated by the closeness and touched his lips briefly against Draco’s, testing his luck.
“This snow is ghastly,” Malfoy says with disdain as he runs a hand roughly through his now-wet hair. “I’m going home.”
“Do what?” Harry asks, perplexed.
Harry grasps it, for what is the very first time in his life, and shakes.
tomorrow about Ginny and him and it’s all untrue of course, although he really does love Ginny just not like
Grabbing his Firebolt that sat on a rack below Ron’s matching one, he pulled out the two brooms and a small black box containing a snitch.
Levi just chuckles and goes about putting together the order by whizzing ingredients from various parts of the pokey kitchen. Harry catches the carrots and puts them down on the bench as he makes his way down to the back of the shop.
“Yes, but it’s courtesy to send condolences when someone passes away, Ronald,” Hermione said in a way that said
“Get used to it,” Harry replied. “I can’t imagine someone like you reverting to ethical journalism anytime soon.”
“Good night, Malfoy,” he responds, and actually smiles.
Malfoy looks up, appraising him. Harry thinks he can see a flicker of surprise in the pale grey eyes that meet his, but he second guesses himself because in an instant, its gone. The cool, collected gaze that meets his reverts back to its stoic indifference.
“Stop it!” Harry yelled as he jumped to his feet, briefly forgetting that his decibel level would probably wake up the sleeping two-year-old on the second floor.
It was far too much. “What?!” he exclaimed.
being related to any other wizarding family was laughable. Harry was fairly sure there was a Potter somewhere on the Black tapestry (though he had not recognised the name). He wasn’t about to let Draco know that though.
“Well it’s technically not a muggle cafe,” Harry winces.
Harry felt a bit guilty after that and resolved not to think about Lucius being in a telephone box.
Harry swallowed deeply. “I think I’m in love with you.”
“Surely you’re not upset about
“Draco,” he said, appearing to have recovered from shock momentarily. “Draco Malfoy.”
Harry pauses. “What do you mean?” he asks, genuinely confused.
Malfoy scowls. Harry feels a great sense of achievement.
“Do you think it wise to play with fire on a rooftop covered by grass?” Draco asked, eyeing Harry as he
As it turned out, it was not an uncommon occurrence to have to convince the Daily Prophet and its somewhat injudicious reporters to not blow their cover on an entire operation. Harry was on his way to learning that, despite the logical belief that wizarding criminals were their adversaries, the Daily Prophet was the true nemesis of all Aurors.
“Why did you learn to drive?” Harry asks, after fifteen minutes of silence.
To his great surprise, Draco seemed to agree.
"Hello?" Katie says, jabbing him in the side with her wand. "You dropped the Mauritian blend, for the fiftieth time."
“Hello Grang-Hermione,” he replied, tripping over his words.
“Suit yourself,” she says, going back to cleaning the countertop. “But you’ll have to speak to him next Saturday.”
“You were nothing but horrible to me, Draco,” Hermione said evenly, “but I’d still be sorry if you died.”
“Ron, that’s unhelpful,” Hermione chastised, as she bit her lip trying to contain her chagrin.
“Harry Potter, who is the real boss here?”
“Definitely not,” Harry grimaced. “He hated this house more than anyone.”
“What?” Harry asked, genuinely perplexed. “I don’t want either of our professional conduct to come into question and I certainly don’t fancy accusations of nepotism because, if you recall, I was the one that suggested you for that position.”
Harry scoffed. “Presumptuous, Draco. I don’t actually live here.”
“I can see it now,” she cackles as they haul their considerable amount of shopping bags into Harry’s cafe and find a table. “Bonding over Broomsticks - The Chosen One rekindles old Weasley flame.”
“I don’t drink,” Draco said simply, staring at his hands.
“Hermione wants that new cookbook and perfume set by Gwenog Jones,” Ginny says, pointing at a lurid green hardback on the shelf of Flourish and Blotts which is accompanied by an equally eye catching glass bottle.
“Do you need help with the seatbelt this time, Potter?” Malfoy asks as he cuts the engine and slides out of the car.
there.”
“Your Godfather was a Slytherin?” Draco asked as they reached the third floor landing.
“I didn’t say that,” he mumbles, but he was unquestionably thinking it.
“Okay, Harry,” she said, simply. Infuriatingly, Harry had thought.
“With what?” she responds, expectantly.
Draco was in the bathroom, avoiding any kind of post coital interaction. This wasn’t unusual, on the contrary it was to be expected. However, Harry sort of wished he would have made an exception for once. Although, he supposed, it wasn’t
“Nothing,” Ginny and Katie reply together. They smirk conspiratorially though and it’s deeply unsettling, Harry thinks.
Harry had meant to say something more enlightened about making more honourable choices and avoiding adverse consequences. But Draco Malfoy had an inexplicable knack for getting under his skin, and making his psyche revert back to fifteen-year-old, reckless Harry.
Draco narrowed his eyes and hit Harry over the head with a stray pillow.
“Potter?”
The uncomfortable thing was how Draco felt about Harry Potter, which was definitely not aligned with his usual proclivity for self preservation.
Usually, Harry wouldn’t bother. Hermione is usually right, if usually means in ninety-nine point nine-nine percent of cases.
“Spoken like a true addict, Harry,” she says, grinning. “I’ll make a latte for you if you get up off the bench and stop scaring off the customers.”
It got to the point where Draco Malfoy felt so hopeless about the entire situation he considered just changing it. Acting on instinct. Taking risks.
Someone, he
“Anyway,” she says, flicking through a now-pristine menu. Some of the black ink appears to have been scrougified off. “You’ll have more opportunities to make him feel welcome, I suppose.”
“He’s not Harry’s
Flicking it towards the door he pulls the first report over from the pile on his desk and stares, unseeing at it’s cover.
“Why do you care anyway, Potter,” he asked, nonchalantly. He
“I’m not-” Harry stuttered pathetically, “that is, we’re not-”
“Why would we fry fish?” Ron asks, very genuinely.
an Olympic sport,” Malfoy mutters and Harry hasn’t the foggiest how Malfoy even knows what the Olympics are, let alone what sports are represented, so he just shakes his head and feels relieved when Malfoy steers them into a dimly lit, grungy pub that’s somehow still open despite it being well past two.
“Well I won’t tell you, so you’re going to have to go through your precious
Ron found him again at quarter to six, buried in his work and with six broken quills piled up next to his right hand.
“I can’t believe you woke me up for this,” Ginny says crossly when she twirls out of the fireplace at the Leaky Cauldron two hours later. “If you needed fashion advice, you could have asked Neville.”
If were possible, he would have liked to hide away here with Draco forever in their little bubble of domestic bliss with a side of sarcastic bantering and mind-blowing blowjobs. But Draco also wanted to be distracted, and Harry was determined to deliver if not for the sole purpose of being able to weasel his way into spending more time with him.
. He doesn’t want Luciana to think he’s sleep deprived and has an alcohol problem.
Draco spied the Nimbus and raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t realise you wanted a full re-enactment, Harry. I would have worn more green.”
Harry had never seriously believed that years of smoking could actually make one cough up a lung. But he swore that Draco Malfoy almost did. It was the most uncivilised coughing fit Harry had ever seen. Harry thought it was deliciously unrefined.
"You smell nice," Harry says drily.
“How do you stand him?” he asks, incredulously. “He’s twenty times worse than Meldrid.”
Draco, predictably, rolled his eyes. “It’s
“Is now an appropriate time to suggest a tour of the bedrooms?”
“Yes please,” Draco said, his features rearranging themselves into a haughty expression as he lowered himself gracefully into the chair on the opposite side of the desk.
have to pay some kind of monetary penance, did you?”
“Yes but an Auror? Impossible, how do you have the time?” he asks.
“So we’ve suffered through an entire year of ranting, raving and general discussion about Draco Malfoy for absolutely no reason?” Ron asked as he picked up his badge which was suspiciously placed right next to where he had gotten his bag not five minutes earlier.
“This is
“Don’t be like that,” Malfoy says, a little too quickly. “I was only joking.”
?” Harry asked as the kettle boiled. He had cast a quick warming charm as neither of them had bothered to put the top half of their clothes back on. He swore the kitchen dipped into sub-zero temperatures, even in spring.
Draco forcefully smiled. He rarely ever smiled, and he envisioned the strained version of his least-favourite expression being hardly welcoming. Good. If he repulsed enough people with his display of clearly faked kindness, perhaps he could negate the people-attracting aura Potter seemed to exude.
“So?” Draco said impatiently.

hot that Harry almost completely forgot what he was asking or why he was asking it. His body ached with a powerful combination of an insatiable hunger and unbridled pleasure and he wanted to eat all his words back into his mouth so he could stop making an absolute fool out of himself.
He keeps smiling as he opens the door and walks inside and collapses into bed. He doesn’t have a single nightmare, either.
“I’ll still sack you,” Harry mutters darkly.
“No it’s okay. I don’t want to be weird or be
for us,” Malfoy sneered and for a moment, Harry was transported back to another time, another office with another Malfoy and a diary, a sock and a miserable house elf.

The next Saturday, at an obscenely early hour, Harry rifles through his clothes desperately trying to find something visually pleasing.
way, Harry thought). “Thanks to you Potter, I’m quite used to disappointment.”
Harry coughs. “Sorry, um, chocolate, yes.”
“Be careful,” said Hermione, sticking her head out of her back door to kiss her husband goodbye.
Ron rolled his eyes. Hermione just nodded her head in understanding.
"You know that's terrible for you, right?" He says.
“No, but smoking will
Ron is halfway through levitating the stack of reports back onto his desk from their previous position on the floor. He narrows his eyes at Harry. “You should learn to wait your turn, Harry. I might have accidentally hexed you.”
It was halfway through the couch dinner when Hermione finally addressed the elephant in the room. It was lucky she did, Harry reflected, because he and Ron were possibly the two least likely people on the planet to discuss their feelings.
As Walburga’s monologue continued, and Draco gazed on in utter confusion and horror, Harry sidled closer to the unflapped curtain surreptitiously. Draco’s eyes, wide and panicked, met his as Harry reached the edge of the portrait.
Harry nodded. He had been fortunate enough to co-habit with Voldemort’s mind for the first seventeen years of his life.
and had gone directly for the word that indicated wealth.
In fairness to runners, Harry is horribly unfit and hasn’t slept enough in years, but the aching in his knees and the shortness of his breath is more than apparent after three kilometres and it takes all of his willpower to make it back to Grimmauld place without stopping.
her himself. Weirdly, they got along quite well, Harry thought.
Harry ignores the question, gazing across at the pile of papers stacked up on the table next to Malfoy. "They look as welcoming as the stack I have on my desk at the moment," he says, then realises he's just told Malfoy he works in a cafe and isn't sure if the other man is going to be able to follow his somewhat disorganised thought process.
“What?”
"Potter, did you make this?" He flourishes his hand toward the soy latte sitting in the glass.
Potter?”
“I’ll show you,” he said, holding out his hand which Draco took, gingerly.
Draco put down his mug and cleared his throat, looking completely at a loss.
Harry, given how he interceded on his behalf at the Death Eater trials. Harry knows Slytherins aren’t the most grateful of people, but they know a thing or two about
“Have you actually ever tried hippogriff’s piss?” Harry asks, momentarily distracted.
(quickly skipping over Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange’s names, Harry noticed) and finally down to rest over
He envelops her in a side hug after a few glasses of Odgen’s Finest and promises her a substantial raise he can’t quite deliver on if he thinks about the financials of the business, but knows he will make it work regardless.
“It’s rude to keep me waiting, Potter,” Draco replied in the entitled way that Harry was so used to. Harry didn’t care in the slightest. His skin felt like it had developed its own electric current and quivered under every point of contact between them. His hand, almost of its own accord, reached up to thread itself through the pale blond strands of Draco’s hair.
Malfoy raises one, perfect blond eyebrow. “Other people don’t seem to find me annoying.” He says it so honestly in that disarming way which makes Harry feel guilty. “Prejudiced, maybe. But not annoying.”
Harry sighs. She's not wrong. He rests his head against the wall and shuffles himself into a more comfortable position on the hard stool.
To Harry’s relief, Malfoy attempted to smooth out a patch of grass and sat gingerly beside him, back leaning against the brick wall in the same fashion as Harry’s.
After ten minutes of warm, comforting shower and sombre early-morning reflection, he stares at himself through the Everclear Mirror that Hermione got him for Christmas a few years ago. He’s not sure why Hermione thinks this is something he particularly
“You were saying?” Harry asked quietly, kissing Draco’s earlobe.
Harry didn’t finish that sentence because one second he was nervously fiddling with a piece of synthetic grass and the next second a warm, soft hand was cupping his chin and his cheek and hot lips were pressed roughly against his and his brain seemed to completely disintegrate in his skull. His free hand somehow found the back of Draco’s fine, blonde hair and pulled him impossibly closer as their lips parted briefly and Harry tasted cigarettes and garlic, both of which should have been off putting but somehow drew him in like nothing had before.
in Draco Malfoy goes beyond a healthy respect for his work ethic.”
Surprisingly, the predictability of it did nothing to quell the fluttering, anxious excitement Harry felt every time he strode past Malfoy’s office in the morning. There would be a pause, an acknowledgement, and then he would continue on to his own office to begin grappling with the competing urge to spend all day fantasising about six o’clock and the requirement to actually
He immediately makes a mental note to kick himself in the face for such a ridiculous comment.
“Exactly how many houses do you own, Potter?” Draco asked. “Excuse my ignorance but you don’t seem the type to be a real estate mogul.”
Upon reflection, Draco wasn’t exactly sure what Potter was to him. He wasn’t his friend, or his enemy, or even just his colleague. Harry Potter was, all things considered, the one thing that had stayed consistent for Draco’s entire life. Whether it was insulting him or conspiring with him to eat kebabs on a rooftop, Harry Potter had never changed. He was still the slightly reckless, spontaneous and messy Harry Potter that had a certain disregard for his own safety and an untameable hero complex that Draco had always known.
“Harry-” Hermione started.
“What about the
“He’s just so...
into my memory, Potter.”
“You know I haven’t bothered reading the
Harry turned away from her and found Ron staring at him with a similar expression.
“Feel free to take one of the eight, currently unused bedrooms,” Harry said, gesturing to the bedroom door off the landing, unnerved by the smug smile blossoming over Draco’s features.
"I frothed it to about one hundred and twenty," Katie says, whooshing the foam wand again.
He trailed of because he honestly really wasn’t sure what they were doing.
“Don’t be thick, Harry,” Malfoy snorted, but his eyes closed in satisfaction from Harry’s gentle touch on his wrist.
Hermione gasped his hand and led him over to the couch. “Sit,” she commanded.
“Quite possibly,” Draco agreed, shutting the cupboard door. “It wouldn’t be abnormal for pureblood families to protect certain things in that way to prevent their estates from ever being sold to third parties.”
He certainly has no hard feelings towards her, but then again, maybe he doesn't have any feelings at all. There is a part of him that worries, inadvertently, that there is nothing left of him to feel. After seeing so many horrors of the war, he hasn't found it easy to slip back in to normal life. Certainly not in the way that his other school friends have. Not even Hermione, who Harry knows still has night terrors and carries a bottle of dittany everywhere with her.
“No, don’t do that,” he says, sighing as he lowers himself onto the familiar wooden stool. One of his knees cracks, ominously.
Malfoy.”
Harry didn’t have a response. He just looked incredulously between them.
“Hey,” he asked, spinning his broom around so they faced each other. “Would you say this is a date?”
He really needs a life. Or a relationship. Or both. Despite being surrounded constantly by people, Harry feels terribly lonely, he admits. Things with Ginny were never going to work out after the war. He wasn't sure what changed, but the young infatuation had dried up so quickly, like old flowers in vase, and the petals had all dropped off one by one until there was nothing but the shrivelled stem left.
. You have no idea how it wounds me,” he said, facetiously.
“Potter-” Malfoy started, but Harry cut him off.
since I had Malfoy hired to do that for me,” Harry said, an insidious feeling of panic now constricting itself tightly around his chest like a tendril of Devil’s Snare.
“If there’s anyone to thank for that, its you,” Harry pointed out. “If you’d never been such a bloody prat and stolen that Remembrall-”
“If you don’t freeze to death,” he smiles, patting her knee affectionately. “Let’s get you home.”
Malfoy smirks, but Harry senses a sadness behind it that sticks to him. It makes the atmosphere feel heavy and oppressive. He wonders whether Malfoy is lonely despite the charity balls and other rich-person social events he imagines a Malfoy must attend.
Ron sighed, “today, mate. I actually do have work tonight.”
“With what?” Harry asked, oblivious.
, Draco thought. A sign of a poor upbringing, as Mother would say. Draco knew that Potter was raised by muggles, but he didn’t know much more than that. He knew there were rumours that the boy-who-lived had experienced a less than pleasant childhood considering his infamy in the wizarding world, but it wasn’t something Draco had ever even considered raising with his coworker.
“Are you sure?” she countered. “Or I can find you something else you might feel like?”
“I’m not
“Marginally better than being marked as a baby to vanquish a powerful, dark wizard,” Harry quipped, eyes transfixed to Draco’s face.
Malfoy could at least show simple niceties to him. After all, there's a good chance that if Harry hadn't chosen to testify at the sentencing hearings, all three Malfoys could be spending their days in prison. In which case, Malfoy wouldn't be able to be annoyingly superior about his suspicious desk job, and file through his precious papers and sit in Harry's coffee shop just to ruin his day.
“Look, how about this,” Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he can’t quite remember them being so close before.
"So if I quit one of my jobs and get a social life you'll give it up?" he asks, teasing her to try and lighten the mood.
“We’ve got to stop doing this,” Harry grinned at Draco’s face, irritation evident and inches away from his own, “I’m going to develop spinal problems.”
“Okay,” Harry almost whispers, because for some reason he’s still stuck a bit on the
, Harry thought. It was a strangely conflicting concept, to be fair. Harry was irrefutably attracted to Malfoy, and definitely not only in the physical sense. But at the same time he was acutely aware that a public relationship between the Boy-Who-Lived and the only former Death Eater employed by the Ministry, was going to raise both a few eyebrows and some awkward questions.
Malfoy half smiles and says “okay,” in a cool and nonchalant way, and Harry feels like he’s drowning in his own awkwardness.
“Me either,” Harry said thoughtfully. “I mean, no one has ever told me that they love me before.”
When he makes it to the bench however, he stops dead. He almost forgets about the packets of beans in his hands. One actually drops to the floor.
Draco didn’t respond. Harry’s heart leapt at the thought. He also felt a bit dizzy, but that was probably the wine. Harry vowed never to underestimate the power of wine again.
“Are you coming tonight, Ginny?” Katie asks expectantly.
Fair point, Harry thinks. He has, in fact, been to both of his jobs today. “On what?” he asks.
. But Harry vehemently pushed those thoughts out of his mind as he swallowed half the flute at once and went to find some of his colleagues to talk to. Preferably ones that didn’t stir up uncomfortable feelings.
“Snuff it?” Ron said, helpfully. “Don’t know, mate. St Mungo’s hasn’t released any information yet. You know how those Healers are with patient confidentiality. He could have been sick for years and nobody would have known it.”
Harry had revelled in the spontaneity of it all. Over the course of his year-long mission to spoil the profit margins of the Daily Prophet, his favourite time of day had become the inevitable verbal battle with his favourite high-school nemesis.
“Maybe this house is mine,” Draco mused, looking slyly at Harry.
“Definitely,” Harry breathed into Draco’s shoulder, resting his forehead against the soft skin between neck and clavicle.
“And who was managing it before?” Draco Malfoy asked, leaning back in his chair.
Malfoy actually laughs for a good twenty-something seconds before turns back to face Harry and snickers.
Draco scowled, narrowing his eyes. “I’m reconsidering my assessment as we speak.”
In 2008, he was 28 years old. Pre-30. The perfect time to take risks, according to the advice column in the Prophet, at least. Although Draco supposed that the Prophet probably meant things like changing careers or starting a business or taking up quidditch professionally. Not telling your former enemy that you might not hate them anymore - or worse.
“Why?” Harry asked again, then reflected it may have been insensitive to ask such a question.
“I’m afraid that I’m terribly allergic to caviar,” Draco said, “would you mind removing
Ten minutes later, Harry pushes open the dark wooden door to Ron's office just in time to see the red-head shoving his stack of reports messily under his identical desk.
“You seem to enjoy it,” Harry replied smugly, much to Draco’s chagrin, “you do it all the time.”
"Do you mind if I get back to these then?" the cool voice replies, gesturing to the pile of papers next to him.
Katie rolls her eyes, "you do know the point of being the owner is that you can pay other people to do the dirty work for you?"
Draco looked stunned. Harry actually had no idea how he proceeded with that conversation. The wine must have helped, he guessed, because he didn’t feel the choking sort of anxiety he sometimes did around Malfoy.
Harry remembers that he threw Ron under the metaphorical bus this morning and feels as though he should back him up, even if he’s wrong. “I guess I should have mentioned that,” he says, and Ron does a minuscule nod of his head.
Somehow, he spent a solid two hours sitting in a bar, talking amicably with Draco Malfoy about things ranging from coffee beans to muggle movies and somehow, he feels like they never ran out of things to say.
When Malfoy says nothing but gives him a somewhat disbelieving look, Harry fumbles onward, "I've never seen you here before, thats all."
grass?”
Draco laughed a little bitterly. “Mother is in France right now, Potter and there’s no way in hell you’re making me go there.”
He wasn’t sure whether it was the anger of potentially having two years worth of work blown or the anxiety of having to manage three new candidates for witness protection which made him as highly strung as he was that afternoon. Whichever it was,  Harry’s fuse was exceptionally short by the time he had entered the offices of the Daily Prophet’s Sports Editor.
“Why would that matter?” Harry asked, perplexed.
It was lucky he never told Draco about the Marauders Map, Harry thought. He might have been somewhat put off to learn just how much time Harry had spent watching the D. Malfoy dot trail up and down the corridors.
that Harry knew Malfoy couldn’t resist. That is to say, Lucius Malfoy had worked at the Ministry for many years, and until recently, it had been a career opportunity completely out of reach to the prodigal son.
“He’s not scrawny; he’s over six foot,” Harry retorts, then immediately feels a bit weird. Why does he know things like that? He shouldn’t know things like that.
Harry flushed. He wasn’t sure why he felt so hot and prickly all of a sudden but there was something infuriating about being so in love with someone else and trying to lock it all up inside.
“Malfoy?” Ron looked slightly stricken. “Bloody hell, it’s a bit harsh to expect him to come to work today, isn’t it?”
Harry leaned against the doorframe. “If you look any harder, you might fall in,” he said softly.
, where he sleeps fitfully and wakes up every hour, terrified, hot and uncomfortable. Those nights where a tent in a snowy forest haunts him and he can viscerally hear Hermione screaming for mercy at the cruel, twisting hands of Bellatrix Lestrange.
Hermione poked her head around his office door and smothered a scream. Never mind Voldemort and a couple of Death Eaters, Harry thought, Hermione’s real worst nightmare was seeing paper being abused.
“Muggle-inspired cafe,” Harry mutters, but nonetheless goes along with Ron’s line of thinking.
I grovel for your forgiveness on how delayed this chapter has been. I started working on it earlier this year and then COVID happened and the whole world went absolutely crazy. I mean, it's still crazy, but it took me a while to work out that I had to prioritise my escapism. So here is the next chapter and I am eternally grateful for anyone who has bothered to continue reading. I swear it won't take me as long next time.
“Actually it was a century,” Harry replied, feeling very accomplished. Draco rarely lost his cool and this was, apparently, a sore point. “I suppose when you’ve got natural talent-”
. Was he actually watching Draco Malfoy lick a spoon right now? He really has lost his mind.
Harry laughed, reaching for Malfoy’s hand again. Malfoy scowled at him and pulled his hand away.
Draco sighed and grasped Harry’s hand in his own, lifting it away from his cheek. “It exhausts me to explain the intricacies of the Malfoy family tree. If we’re really going to do that, I need tea.”
Harry pretended to consider this for a second before leaning in himself. “I happen to know someone with an ugly scar on their forehead,” he said, “but they don’t like to share.”
Ginny doesn’t bother to notice Harry’s emotional turmoil, as she moves to tap the brick in the wall. “Wait,” he says, coming back to his senses and pulling two flasks from his cloak. He tosses one to her. “To avoid being harassed during the busiest shopping period of the year?”
There was a reason Ron was his best friend, Harry thought. If he had gone back to his apartment he would have forgotten to eat all together in his anxiety about how to deal with the Malfoy situation. Ron subconsciously knew when Harry needed to be reminded to eat, even if he didn’t want the backstory.
Draco had to admit, the garlic content of the kebab did make the dry meat taste much better than first expected. He chewed thoughtfully as he watched Harry devour his.
Harry seethes. He owns this cafe! He can sit wherever he bloody well likes! He doesn’t get a chance to retort, however, because Malfoy stalks away towards the back of the cafe to hide in what appears to be his favourite spot amongst the philodendrons. Philodendrons are highly toxic, Harry thinks. Maybe Malfoy will eat one by mistake.
“He’s keeping track of a former Death Eater,” Ron points out. “Perfectly legal.”
“I’m sure you do, Potter, but I’m going to have to insist that you take care of that horrid morning breath first.”
“What are you doing this weekend?” Harry asked compliantly, still distracted by the thought of being in a state of undress with Draco and how his skin would feel against Harry’s and the feeling of Draco’s mouth hot against Harry’s neck and lips and stomach and-
Harry glanced at the dreary facades of the various townhouses adorning the street. “Wait until you see the inside,” he muttered. It had taken a solid month to clean the interior to a respectable state, since he had sent Kreacher to work in the Hogwarts kitchens after the War.
Harry nodded. He was sort of glad because he had been trying to find the right words to say about Lucius ever since Draco had jumped out at him in the kitchen, and he was still at a loss.
He froze when he heard Hermione say, “I’m sorry to hear about your father, Draco,” and waited with bated breath for the response.
An uncomfortable feeling, like a heavy weight, settled itself in Harry’s stomach. Surely Draco would have told him if Lucius had been seriously ill. But then again, they hadn’t divulged much about their family history outside the Black family tree (not that Harry really had much to contribute). Still, it didn’t sit well.
They don’t even bother to revisit the reason that Malfoy lives in muggle London, only that he does and he owns a flashy sports car and works in finance. How that happens, Harry hasn’t a clue, but he swiftly puts his fingers in his ears when Malfoy starts talking about taking certain
“Sorry,” Harry grimaced, “I didn’t think you’d have to meet her today.”
Malfoy is lactose intolerant, he thinks.
“Prat.”
Draco sighed dramatically. “Probably not. Being ravenously attracted to you is a burden I loathe to carry.”
or whatever other improper iteration of a person I’m being at the moment-” he began as he pulled back to give Draco some breathing space.
This time, he hopes Malfoy really does sod off.
“You taste like garlic.”
“Definitely,” Ron agreed, although he didn’t sound convinced.
“Merlin, don’t remind me,” Draco replied, voice thick with sarcasm. “Don’t even
As it turned out, it did make a difference. Firstly, because Malfoy simply refused to take the job unless he reported directly to the Department Head, at which point, Harry had considered just withdrawing the offer. The Department held a certain belief that because Harry was taking a risk on a known offender, he should be responsible for managing his conduct.
Harry smirked at Draco’s irritated expression. “Maybe you were too distracted watching me to keep your eye on it?”
Draco smirked, his hand turning softly over to lift Harry’s chin with his thumb and forefinger. It was the only time that Harry really noticed the height difference between them. The single inch didn’t strike a huge contrast in day to day activities but when he was pressed up against a solid wall with Draco’s face centimetres from his, he noticed that the latter’s 5”10 frame did give him a slight advantage.
“Never mind,” he breathed, fingers wrapping around the small, square packet and pulling it out.
Draco frowned slightly and looked away. “I don’t know if I should,” he said softly.
Draco shook his head. “The Manor isn’t what it used to be. Mother is in the process of having it completely rebuilt.”
she could read his mind. There really wasn’t another witch or wizard in this building that Harry could feel entirely comfortable chatting mindlessly to over a questionable canapé.
“Stay,” Harry said again, from his position leaning against the headboard. He’d
Harry cocks an eyebrow at her. He highly doubts Malfoy wants to apologise to him, or discuss the goings on of the war at all. In fact, he would hazard a guess that Malfoy tries his hardest not to think of the war, unless it is scheming of ways to repair his image. Harry imagines Malfoy probably hosts a charity ball or two for that exact reason. Then again, he has another reason to talk to people now.
Katie lifts an eyebrow but says nothing.
He looks down at the brown, tea stains on his right lapel, which he thought had been rather conveniently hidden in the dark navy of the Ministry's robes. Now that he looks again, they are rather obvious. He sighs, and rubs absentmindedly on one of them with his left hand.
Whether Draco Malfoy wanted to admit it or not, Harry knew he wasn’t that same person. He was still an arrogant prat, but he wasn’t
“I forgot how much of a sore loser you are,” he said, impishly.
An hour and a half later and Harry was chewing on a corner of white toast, eyes transfixed on Draco Malfoy who was sitting on his couch, legs tucked up underneath him, mug of tea in one hand and horribly out of date edition of The Quibbler in the other. It was a weirdly, lovely sight, Harry thought. He hadn’t a clue how they had managed to end up here, but he wasn’t going to start complaining.
Draco shot him a sideways look. They fell silent for a moment.
ten years since Buckbeak lived here.”
“And I suppose you wanted to buy the most nondescript, inconspicuous car on the market,” Harry quips, free hand feeling the soft leather seat underneath him.
“And?”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Ron biting down hard on his lip to stop himself from laughing out loud. It was only once Kingsley had left, Harry realised he wasn’t quite sure how to broach the subject without seeming a little insane.
Harry’s curiosity piques with a tingle of anticipation running down his spine. He wants more answers, but he knows he is unlikely to get them from Katie. He has learned over their two years working together that it would be easier to escape Azkaban than get a secret out of her.
Harry thought about the various other cupboards and hangings which had resisted his demands. He wondered whether Draco would object to being used as an assistant in his quest for victory against the most noble house of Black.
He pauses, appraising his former classmate. There really isn't much thats changed about Malfoy at all. Perhaps his hairline has receded a minuscule amount, and his hands appear slightly thinner, but aside from that he's still slim, tall and angular.
“What, having sex?” Draco asked, a look of genuine confusion on his features.
Harry shoots her a look. As soon as they’re in the courtyard he counters, “just because Neville is
Harry pulls a face in her direction. "You're too bossy," he says, still looking over at the back of the blond head. Against his better judgment he asks, "what does he usually order?"
He leant forward slightly. The smell, the touch, the being so close to Draco Malfoy was as intoxicating as any alcohol Harry had consumed that night. His hands ached to reach across the gap between their faces and
“Certainly, Auror Potter,” she says, snapping back into work-mode.
“I’ll save you the heartache, Potter,” Draco replied. “It’s exquisite.”
Malfoy’s brow unfurrows and he cocks an eyebrow. “Have you been analysing my criminal record, Harry?”
“If you don’t want to be seen with me, we don’t have to go anywhere that people might-”
“What are you looking at me like that for?” Draco asked, squinting slightly as the sun poked its way though Harry’s blinds.
“Does he just?” Harry mutters, sounding impertinent but reminding himself that this is
“You have to tell me,” he says, taking a sip of his pint and looking up at Malfoy, “why you drive a car, have muggle money, live in Bayswater and know what the bloody
Draco’s hips bucked softly and Harry moaned involuntarily into his mouth.
Draco’s eyes, still determinedly looking downwards, crinkled slightly in the corners. “You left me to scheme for too long. You know I have a flair for theatrics.”
“What are you going to put on yours? Your name, I suppose,” Ron says darkly and Harry feels a twinge of guilt. He has a sudden urge to change the topic.
“Then how do you know?” Draco pressed.
Ginny groans and pushes her fringe out of her face sleepily. “Point is, the time has a number lower than ten at the start and it’s an off-season Saturday.”’
. Harry thought, but decided against it as Malfoy’s face stiffened and pale grey eyes grew dark.
“Do you live close to here?” He asks conversationally, trying desperately to distract Malfoy from the fact that he can’t work a simple seatbelt. Of course, Harry knows full well from his slightly unethical employment and location search that Malfoy lives in Bayswater and not Stoke Newington or the surrounds.
for scarheads with saviour complexes.”
“Honestly Potter, stop that,” Draco replied, smirking. “Some days, I’m Draco, some days I’m Malfoy. You’re giving me whiplash.”
“Perfume and cooking?” Harry asks doubtfully, picking up the copy and flipping it over to read the blurb.
“Boy,” she said, voice shaking with what Harry thought was wonder (having never heard Walburga Black speak so softly before). “Boy, what is your name?”
for his cafe.
“I want to-” Harry started, but Draco cut him off.
“Well I think he looks lonely,” Katie says.
Ron spluttered. On what, Harry wasn’t sure because he didn’t appear to be drinking anything.
, we don’t even talk
By two, Harry couldn’t take it anymore and he found himself barging into Ron’s office just as Kingsley Shacklebolt, the recently appointed Minister of Magic, was leaving.
Harry breathes heavily and wants to disappear into the coffee for a second, but then remembers that he has an investigation to attend to and makes his way over to the table in the far right hand corner.
"Not going to happen tonight, is it mate?" he grins, wiping his floppy fringe out of his face. "Look, I know if we get desperate we can just hole up in here and do them together, right?"
Malfoy, however, isn't taking advantage of what Harry perceives to be a fantastic people-watching location. Instead, he has is back to Harry and is deeply engrossed in something and so fails to see him coming, even when Harry is right over his back shoulder and wondering how he should approach the situation.
“It’s always a mess,” Harry frowns, patting the unruly hair on his crown down. “I can’t help it.”
“You know, it’s awfully rude to ignore me,” Draco sniffed, breaking Harry’s convoluted train of thought.
Harry snorted and lifted his arm off, shuffling backwards as Draco flipped over and propped himself up on an elbow to face him.
Harry, using the brooms additional speed and agility, ducked slightly below Draco to the left and snatched the golden orb from beneath his outstretched hand. Hearing Draco yell some select profanities from behind him, Harry laughed breathlessly as he manoeuvred the broom into a steep dive and pulled up on the outer edge of the trees.
, and here he was wishing that Draco would hurry up and take more of his clothes off.
“But he also owns it,” Ron grumbles, shooting a furtive glance at Harry.
Harry felt as though he was melting into a puddle against the wall. His legs felt like they were somewhat detached from his body and he was fairly sure having Draco pressed firmly up against him was the only thing preventing them from giving way all together.
“Are you
Without looking behind him, he flicks the dishes neatly toward the sink behind him. "Watch it, Boss," Levi laughs, ducking beneath the flying side plates. The young cook swiftly moves to the other side of the metallic work bench, grabbing two tubs of ingredients from the fridge behind him.
. Or, if he was, somehow Draco's eyes found him without being told to. At various points that very night, his eyes had unwillingly found themselves peeled off the wallpaper he was determined to stare at, and drifting over to Potter's location at the back of the room, hidden by the wall-to-wall, sparkly tinsel and being harassed by both important Ministry officials and pushy waiters.
"The work part or the social life part?" Harry asks, concerned.
“It’s not that bad,” Malfoy says, misreading Harry’s apparent exasperation.
“Do you know where I live too?!” Harry exclaims, whipping around in a much more terrified way than he intends to.
“Well, if you read the
Harry turned and leant on the doorframe momentarily and sighed. “Does it make a difference?”
“Stay with me,” Harry said, more as a statement than a question.
Draco didn’t say anything else but sighed deeply, closed his eyes and settled into the mattress.
“What?”
,” he began, “they just think they’re better than everyone else.”
Malfoy stares icily at him. “It makes it a bit hard to exist in wizarding England without galleons, you halfwit.”
Ron, thinking on his feet, cast a quick
“Mhm?”
Malfoy snorts. “Potter, you own St. Drogo.”
and that they were reciprocated.
Draco’s eyes flitted to Harry’s hand but he didn’t make an attempt to move away. “Can I retract that comment?” he asked, scowl still firmly in place.
“I need your help, Gin,” he says, beseechingly.
onto their guests.”
“Do you want to do something today?” he asked Draco vaguely.
“It was his own fault, Harry,” Ron said, appearing on the bottom step of the spiral staircase. “He knew that head office hadn’t authorised it and he did it anyway.”
To interrupt the awkwardness, he crosses over to the booth opposite the coffee table Malfoy is sitting at, and leans precariously on the arm of it, praying that he isn't too heavy and the whole thing topples over.
Harry sighed. This was infuriating. Fuck it.
It was as if Draco Malfoy was connected to Harry Potter by some kind of inexplicable gravitational pull. Like a satellite moon that couldn’t escape his own, self-destructive orbit.
Harry heard Ron laugh as he shut the back door behind him.
It shouldn’t have felt this good, he reasoned. They were
“Not on the day of the Christmas party Harry, that’s just cruel,” Ginny chides.
Draco cocked an eyebrow. “My second cousins are all part-Veela,” he said. “You’d positively wet yourself over them.”
“Put the seatbelt over both of you and for the love of God, please don’t do anything that will draw the attention of the good officers of the law or I will be sending the fine to you for payment,” he says, sliding into the drivers’ seat as the car purrs to life pleasantly.
He’s endured another one of
“Easy, mate,” Ron said as he raised his hands in a motion that indicated for him to
? Being an Auror really is ageing him prematurely, he thinks. Or maybe it’s being an entrepreneur? Probably both.
"You're late," she teases, cocking an eyebrow at him. Her hair is thrown up into a messy bun, which has a ridiculous number of fly-aways, and despite her dry sarcasm, it looks as though today has been a stressful one.
Harry wasn’t quite sure at what point he fell asleep. He felt like he was staring at Draco’s profile for an eternity, wondering what was going through his head and whether it would be too much too soon to move closer. It wasn’t until the morning, that he realised at some point their bodies had acted of their own accord, because he found himself waking up tucked up behind Draco’s body with his left hand draped over his waist.
? Come on, Harry.”
Harry struggles to sleep sometimes, especially when the house he lives in creaks like it actually is every bit of its four hundred years. 12 Grimmuld Place isn't exactly what Harry had envisaged living in for his adult life, however the draw of it proved too hard to resist. It harbours memories of his Godfather Harry never wants to give up, and Kreacher's attitude change ever since the war has greatly increased the liveability of the place.
“He’s being a menace today,” Ginny says fondly and stands up from the table to envelop Katie in a hug.
He settled on “Hi.”
you.”
“On a Saturday?” Harry asks, raising an eyebrow.
“Draco, shut up and pay attention.”
“Yes,” Harry said, the hard lump forming again in his throat as he thought of Sirius. “He is- was my Godfather.”
“Caviar blini?” a waitress asked, sidling up right on cue.
"Bit out of practice I'm afraid," Harry says ruefully, setting the cleaning charm on the dishes and hurrying to the storeroom to get two more bags of beans.
“So,” Malfoy said, switching tact, “Sirius left you this house in his Will?”
“He’s a menace every day,” Katie retorts with a grin.
Not a lie, strictly speaking. He had looked at the front covers of a few of them over the last three days they had been inhabiting his office. Point is, he has other loose ends to tie up, and the reports wouldn't become a priority until they were within 48 hours of their due date. The due date happens to be a week before the last working day of the year, upon which Harry will likely be stressing about things like Christmas presents and how to convince Molly Weasley he is, in fact, eating enough.
A somewhat surprising reply, Harry thinks. He wasn't expecting it, but then again he wasn't expecting to see Draco Malfoy in his shop either.
Every Friday except this Friday, it seemed, because Draco simply wasn’t there.
“I just,” he started, voice ragged and out of breath. “I just wanted to make sure you were okay and-”
“You look miserable, mate,” Ron added, astute as always.
Harry felt a rush of affection as the interlacing of their fingers ran shivers of excitement up his arm. He craved this closeness. Affection, even, which Harry reasoned he was unlikely to get most of the time from someone like Draco Malfoy.
are.”
“I wasn’t rude to him,” Harry protests. “He just gets on my nerves, that’s all.”
“You haven’t even sent a letter or something?” she asked, incredulously.
“You be careful too, Harry,” Hermione said, giving him a knowing look from the kitchen.
Draco looked at him expectantly. So Harry just said it.
You might be able to reform a blood purist and a Death Eater, Harry thought, but apparently a Malfoy didn’t change all of it’s spots.
“Hurry up Potter,” Malfoy growls as Harry struggles to keep up with the pace. Why Malfoy walks like he’s in a professional competition is baffling, Harry thinks. Normal people just don’t
Harry snorted and then quickly reflected that humour might be slightly inappropriate given the circumstances.
"You should too," his secretary barks again. "I think you should leave before any further damage is done to your robes."
kill you,” Harry argued, taking a sip of wine.
“Er, a potential lead,” Harry says, taken aback by the question. He wonders whether Luciana knows Malfoy in some capacity. Harry dearly hopes not.
