Harry realised where he was before he could put it into tangible thoughts. It took a long time, the length of the struggle to pry his gritty eyes open, before he could put a word to the hospital he was in.
Draco thought, but he couldn't find himself objecting to the fact. Harry was here, with him, had said "yes" and "please" as though he actually wanted to be, and that agreement somehow meant more to Draco than the job itself. In the face of second-guessing his inclination to take the job at all – the interview package offered by
Harry nearly snorted aloud, and only caught himself at the last moment. He frowned. Considered. Then nodded slowly. Draco had always been a prat. Always. He'd poked and pried at every opportunity – or at least Harry thought he had. When he really stretched him memory, however, a glimmer of truth attached itself to Draco's words.
But if she was at the studio… "Have you got business with Dimitri, Pansy?" Draco asked, for if she'd wanted to speak to Draco directly she would have Floo-messaged him. Or called by phone, as was becoming increasingly typical of her.
"That wasn't what she was referring to," Pansy said, her own eyebrow arching. "Are you two having secret exchanges now?"
A glaring Jackie could rival Medusa. Harry hadn't ever seen her turn anyone to stone, but he was sure she could manage it. That, or set her victims on fire.
"I thought about what you said," Harry began slowly, and Draco's quill froze. "About what you told me, and how you felt. I thought about it a lot, actually. Practically all of Christmas."
Harry barely heard him. With a brief glance to Jackie, he frowned at the Hogwarts students. "And that means…?"
Harry stared. He blinked. He glanced down at his book, to the page number, the page itself, then back up to Draco. "Are you telling me what to study?"
Harry waited for a beat or two, making a point of finishing the sentence he was writing before slowly raising his gaze to meet hers. She peered at him over her half-eaten sausage, munching in deliberately slow chews. "Jackie, they're bloody archaic and old-fashioned to boot. Who wears glasses anymore?
"Will you be alright to Apparate home by yourself?" Draco asked as they drew into the quiet seclusion of a building's shadow.
Pansy hummed through a sip of wine. "I agree. Personally, I would have preferred for the funding to be gifted directly to the
Apparently the Hogwarts students before him thought the same. He saw lips thin, saw the dark boy raise a shoulder slightly and the blond sniff as he lifted his nose as though scenting the air. The gesture was the same as that of the girl at his side; he was taller than Harry – which wasn't saying much as most people were – but it made him seem taller still.
His head was so heavy, so thick with grogginess, that Harry didn't know that he was awake at first. Everything felt a little surreal, as though he were wrapped in smothering, cloud-like blankets that were more warm and comforting than constrictive.
"As far as I'm concerned, I don't feel the need to address them directly. So, unless Draco wanted to try for a shoot…?" She nodded as Draco gave a nearly non-existent frown. "Right. So, we'll move onto school life with the second sitting. Not that most people don't know the gist of it, but your experience directly is what we're really looking for."
"Harry," he said lowly, gaze falling to the short span of pebbles between them. "I have to ask you."
Harry didn't reply, just as he didn't point out that they were actually on their fifth round. Extricating himself from Ginny's hold, he spared Ron a vaguely apologetic glance before ducking away from their table and leaving him to Ginny's assault. Their exclamations were quickly lost behind him as he made his way towards the bar.
Draco wasn't sure if that part had been a lie. He didn't know if it was lip-service on Harry's part or if he truly meant it. Draco knew that they had a less than polished past to put it in the mildest of terms, and even if he acknowledged that he'd been – and likely still was, as Pansy called it, 'a little bit obsessed' with Harry – he knew they hadn't been friends. He knew he'd even hated Harry a little.
"You do that," Jackie said, somehow making it seem a threat. She leant around Jill and tugged on Abel's shoulder where, as usual, he'd all but disappeared in plain sight. "I'd appreciate it if you'd not be assholes to Abel, because he's sensitive, and Jill, because she's an angel and doesn't deserve any shit."
Malfoy cleared his throat again. Dropping his gaze, he gathered his own books and rose to his feet. "Yes, well. "He threw a glance sideways, then over his shoulder. "Shall we use the back table, then? There's not really enough space for two to work at this bench."
Harry's feet took him through the aisles, past study nooks and crannies and beyond the designated senior study area. He barely thought about where he walked anymore, and in short order found himself in a back corner, a darkened corner, with little more than a table, a handful of chairs, and a flameless lamp glowing warm, orange light throughout.
"Hey," Harry said, meeting Draco for a kiss. He dropped into the chair at Draco's side. "Have you guys had lunch?"
"I must," his best friend said from behind him. "You made me look for you for a whole half of our lunch break."
And that was to say nothing of the shopkeeper Ollivander's words when he'd handed Harry the holly and phoenix feather wand. "Very curious," he'd murmured, "that you, young sir, would be the owner of that wand in particular. Curious indeed."
The curtains changed colours a dozen times, only settling when there were each such a mish-mash of different shades that it hurt the eyes if stared at for too long. The ceiling was splashed with a mural reminiscent of a remarkably realistic rainbow, and the floor directly beneath a glassy mirror of it. The rugs were fields of green and yellow, the tables seemingly polished to an array of rich teak, and the Ravenclaws seemed to have made it their express duty to colour every book cover in a different shade. It was almost as blinding to look at the bookshelves as it was the curtains.
Harry glanced up from his magazine, turning glancing over the back of the couch to where Ginny inspected the sparse collection of containers on the kitchen counter. "The one in the take-out box? It's Thai. I was going to have it for dinner but didn't feel like it when it got here."
Stirring, Harry drew breath and released it in a heavy, reluctant sigh. He blinked his eyes open, squinting blurrily into the dark depths of the library beyond their quiet niche, and just as reluctantly lifted his chin from Draco's shoulder.
Lips curled. Eyes drew sideways. It was always a little amusing, Harry thought, that they could shift so quickly, backpedalling so frantically, from jeering and poking for attention to shrinking in their seats and avoiding even making eye contact. Targets were far less amusing when they bit back.
"Not yourself, who historically blundered through every confrontation with the press and shied away from every camera you could?"
The greater part couldn't accept it. He couldn't. He didn't want to, because that would be to accept something far bigger and deeper than Harry had considered possible for himself. It would mean that somewhere along the way his concern for Draco had grown into something more. It meant that he cared for him as a friend but also as something beyond that. It meant that, far from the rivalry or even disregard they'd once shared, Draco had become someone important, and Harry hadn't even realised it until then, let alone told Draco about it.
"It would be, wouldn't it?" Jackie said. She flopped her book down into her lap, she turned towards their Hogwarts partners. "Would you two pull your weight a little? Fucking hell, you'd think there was only two of us in this group."
"You don't want to disrupt him when he's working," he'd said to their crew time and time again. He always wore that little smile, a smile typically in place of words as Draco had long ago discovered. "He'll bite your nose off if your ruin a shot for him."
Harry's stare flattened. Like a hawk glaring at its foe, he stared at Draco unwaveringly, and Draco couldn't look away. If anything, he felt almost spellbound, his breath catching in his throat, and might have even been tempted to retract his words had it persisted any longer for longer than a few seconds.
Draco's lips whitened as he pressed them together. He eyed Harry sidelong. "I don't think models are supposed to do everything you do."
Shaking his head, Harry leant a little more comfortably against Draco. The warmth that spread from the point of contact wasn't quite the same as the warmth from the Warming Charms throughout the room, but it staved off the chill. The otherwise unshakable chill, the one that had nothing to do with frost or icy draughts.
Dot was a short woman. Short, thin and spindly like a cricket, yet emanating ferocity. The lines upon her face demanded respect and recognition rather than skepticism for her age, and the grey touching her hair was more a regal crown than a symbol of deterioration. Dot was, in short, a force to be reckoned with, and every aspect of her, from her severe bun to the fitted suit she always wore, emphasised just that.
"I know," Draco said harshly. He gave a sharp shake of his head, lowering his gaze. "And neither do I, because I can't help feeling utterly stupid things, and you can't help that you don't."
Draco tipped his head against Harry's, and Harry felt the flutter of his breath against his temple. His arm slipped around Harry's back in much the same way that Harry held him in turn, though where Harry felt like he was clutching a lifeline, Draco's hold was gently firm.
It wasn't unexpected, that he was shunned. It wasn't unfamiliar to be glared at, to be sneered at, to be the subject of hissing and spitting as though surrounded by a particularly disgruntled horde of kneazles. Draco was used to it – or had become used to it in the years he'd been back in London. The war had passed and the post-war clean up all but swept under the rug, but memory still remained.
"So, to start off with, I'm thinking we'll divide the sequence into four section with four interviews and shoots each." Pansy wrote as she spoke yet kept her eyes upon Harry as though gauging his response. "They'll have to go for a couple of hours each, mind. You're aware we're going pretty in depth, aren't you?"
Harry hated that most of all. Anyone who could belittle Dot, could think less of her simply because she was a squib, wasn't worthy of any of their time. The derision towards squibs was an aspect of the Wizarding world that Harry had never and would never abide.
But he had an A-Level to obtain. A grade was a grade, regardless of how he acquired it. Necessity dictated at least some compliance, despite his confidence in avoiding Mrs. Joyce's gentle but firm nudging into partnership.
"Hold that thought for a second, Hermione," Harry interrupted. He spared her a glance, long enough to catch her with her mouth hanging open but momentarily paused, before ducking quickly into the crowd. Dodging around students, weaving through juniors and all but stepping over first years, he hastened towards the opposite stairwell, all but running as he neared the bottom step.
For once, both Harry and – more unusually - Jackie could only watch in silence. At Jacob and his friends, and at their own friends. Jacob's words always pissed Harry off, always sent Jackie into volatile sparks, but those words weren't unexpected. They weren't unusual, and it wasn't like he couldn't handle them. Harry gave as good as he got most days, often better than what he got, but this…
Draco was barely scraping the surface of wakefulness when a brush of warmth trailed across the back of his neck. Warmth, and then a touch of cold, more solid than the insubstantial touch of that preceding. Even before his mind fully registered what it was, what it could be, he found himself smiling.
The foyer was empty, as it so often was. Empty but for the wide desk with its familiar wheelie chair-bound receptionist seated behind it. Even as Harry stepped through the door, Draco muttering something about 'having a doorbell for a reason', she had her head bowed and hand whizzing across the open appointment diary, ticking and crossing and notating.
Her ears were muffled. Her heartbeat thundered. She knew she was babbling but barely heard her own words.
He'd stood up for him. Before him. In defence of him. What exactly was Draco supposed to do after that? He didn't know, but just as had begun from the first moment he'd seen Harry's picture, he knew that something else, some other change, had clicked over within him like the hand of a clock, steadily approaching its peak.
Sitting with – no, on – Malfoy was weird. Weird because Malfoy hadn't immediately protested, but also because it felt nice. Because Harry didn't like Malfoy. He really didn't hate him anymore, but that was different to liking. But it was… comfortable to sit on his knee, to curl up on his lap, to lean 'accidentally' against him when Malfoy leaned forwards and around him to reach for his glass of pumpkin juice.
Leaning over the tray before him, Draco agitated the distilled water within with gentle, deliberate nudges. The glare of the shadowed red light throughout the room, pooling in even the darkest corners, gave the water an uncanny resemblance to blood, but that similarity was one that Draco had long ago learnt to overlook. It was worth it to produce his photographs in such a primal, involved manner.
He couldn't help but smile, if a little bashfully. It was one thing to be noticed by people in England, both Wizarding and Muggle, but in Switzerland? Admittedly, Harry knew his share of models from abroad, from Helena Christensen to Jason Lewis, but then who didn't? To think that he might be known in such a way… He wasn't sure whether being recognised for modelling or for the war was better. Or worse, as it may be.
A week ago, the Hogwarts students had come to Potting Point High for the first time. A week ago, Jackie had all but dragged Harry towards the cluster of students his two barely-acquaintances Ron and Hermione had deemed necessary to warn them away from. Harry had barely thought about the meeting again for the rest of the week.
"After exams, maybe. With everyone being as stressed as they are, I can't imagine the atmosphere would be conducive to open-mindedness. Maybe directly in the aftermath, when the entirety of our grade is riding on a euphoric, liberated high."
Harry spared him a smile and a shake of his head. He knew the man recognised him just as he recognised him in return, and he wasn't particularly surprised to be asked. 'Drinking like a bird' didn't go unnoticed by most people. But Harry withheld for more than his dietary regime; Von always liked to remind him to hold back if he had any sense.
"Draco?" Harry asked, breaking into the deadened silence of Draco's stagnated mind. "What are you…?"
"Dammit, Pott – no, Harry. Gods dammit, Harry. Do you honestly think I'm the sort of person who lets just anyone take up fucking residence in my lap? Do you?"
Draco ground to a halt. It was so sudden, such a jerking stop, that Harry almost heard the screech of breaks. His head whipped towards Harry, and for a moment all Harry could see was his flushed cheeks. His eyes unexpectedly blown wide. His forehead contorted into what wasn't quite a frown but something else. It was such a vast difference to barely moments before that Harry didn't know what to make of it. He could only stare as Draco stared back at him, concerned and –
When Potting Point High School – named solely because, of only three high schools in the city, it was the first established and absolutely no other reason – drew into view, Harry stumbled to a stop. He saw his bus and its passengers unloading on the curb at the gates, saw the vaguely familiar faces of students he rode with every day chattering amongst themselves as they climbed the steps.
Regardless, Harry found himself a little eager for his afternoon classes. C&C was something of a bludge course that he took as much because his best friend took it too, but for the first time he felt a little excited. Potting Point was bloody boring most of the time; even just a little bit of novelty was nothing to turn his nose up at.
The waiter spared her a professional smile before handing over a steaming pie to Ron at his raised hand. "And the chips too, mate," he said. "Thanks."
Turning from his friends, Harry ducked towards the side of the building. Dodging through the crowd, he propped a shoulder against the wall, stuck a finger from his free hand into his ear, and hastily dialled.
"Oh, he doesn't know after all," Keith said with a chuckle that he might have intended to sound regretful but instead grated on Harry's nerves like a metal file.
Harry shook his head. The shock was to be expected, the disbelief as anticipated as his own, and he was almost relieved to see it from his friends. It was far better than the misery and regret of moments before.
"Oh." A moment of his own stupefied silence followed before Draco straightened, leaning back in his seat. "Well, there's always room for improvement."
"Me and Luna are going to head down to the quidditch pitch this afternoon," Ginny said as they climbed the stairs to the second floor. Detours often swept up and down stairwells, and Harry's feet directed him more than his head. "You're free to come too if you'd like."
Jackie, on the other hand, was striding ahead with her head held high, elbows protruded from where her hands were shoved in her pockets, and seeming to mark her passage with every step she took. Jackie was a loud person and seemed to thrive in similar loudness.
A glance across the room saw Jill and Abel's group where they sat with their Hogwarts partners. Ron and Hermione had been a good choice for them, Harry thought. Jill had said nothing but good things of them, and she'd mentioned more than once that, though perhaps a little excessively rigorously, Hermione was right on task with their workload. It was a good thing that Jill's kind-heartedness wasn't being taken advantage of by lumping additional work upon her plate. Even more so because she didn't take C&C in the first place.
Draco nodded again slowly, considering. "It's a shame, really," he murmured, resting his head back onto his hand. "Already being in Switzerland, it's a real shame that you couldn't go around and properly sightsee."
"Good enough." Ginny tapped on the phone's keys for a second before turning the screen towards him once more. The image was small, but Harry could make out the lines of the quidditch pitch she'd photographed. "What do you think?"
"Professor?" Remus said, raising an eyebrow. "I think afternoon tutoring hardly qualifies me for such a title. Or being a librarian, for that matter."
Harry was in his element. Before the camera, before the photographer, being directed and conducted and yet making those directions and conduct his own. It was almost easy. As the photographer made another shot, the director ordering another tip of his head, he did so, but Harry made it his and he knew…
a Muggle, and it has nothing to do with your social status, regardless of what you and your friend seem to think. Anyone who is not… not from Hogwarts is a Muggle."
Harry punched her shoulder lightly. "You're a fine one to talk. Can we revisit you getting your knickers in a knot just the other day over me and Draco?"
Trivialities that had never mattered before, but seemed so much more important when Harry sat with Draco. When he hauled himself from the dry parchment of textbooks and essays and turned to regard Draco sidelong where he worked with unrelenting studiousness, the small crease evident between his eyebrows, the line of his jaw held just a little tightly, his hand sweepingly fluidly as it crossed the page and left cursive handwriting in its wake.
Harry was much the same. Or at least he pretended to be. Wednesday afternoons with Draco happened to be quite enjoyable, despite the added studying component.
Except that he couldn't sink into it and forget it all. He couldn't forget Emmeline's words, either.
Harry frowned up at the multi-coloured curtains, still bright but magically faded to a slightly gentler hue than they'd been. He didn't know why he'd done that in Potions. He didn't know why Malfoy had let him either, but mostly he was concerned about what had made him do it at all. And why Malfoy of all people? He'd never done such a thing with his friends. He couldn't imagine sitting on Ron's knee, shuddered to think at what Ron would think and how he would react, and Hermione would more than likely enact her usual rigid awkwardness whenever they made any kind of intimate contact. She still never felt particularly comfortable when they hugged, even if Harry felt the urge to accept one from her more and more often in the past year. It was as though her arms simply didn't bend that way.
"I don't mind so much. Besides, if someone asks the same question, it's actually easier since I already know the answer."
"Now, now, Draco," Pansy said from behind him. "No need to be touchy. Give yourself at least a day on the job."
The castle was silent but for the hum of wind passing down the passages, the murmur and groans of the walls as they settled for the evening. Any trace of students that had passed through it earlier that evening had vanished, and the stone corridors were empty of anything but flickering torchlight, the cool glow of the moon streaming through the windows, and the occasional ghost drifting in thoughtful solitude.
"You've made a mess of my couch," Harry said with a frown, once more tucking his feet away from the mess. "If that stains…"
It was surprisingly unremarkable thenceforth, a breakfast much like any other. The only difference was that, without quite knowing how it happened, before he'd even finished his plate Harry found himself sitting almost completely in Malfoy's lap. 'How' seemed to be a bit of a confusing sequence of shifts and shuffles, but 'why' was a little less explainable. Why the hell Malfoy hadn't shoved him off with a huff, mostly. Why Harry didn't shove himself off, too.
Years later, and Draco was still caught. As soon as Potter turned his brief glance from Pansy onto him, Draco was captured.
Taking a slow glance about the room, Draco ran his gaze over every inch of space that breathed of Madame Clementine. She had a style that he'd seen many a time in the work attached to her name, and even if she wasn't the one directly behind the camera, nor the one who crafted the garments her models wore or the one who held the brush and applied the makeup, her presence pervaded nonetheless.
He knew that the room was closed. He knew that the door was locked. He knew that for most of the day Bellatrix idled outside of that door, more often than not muttering to herself and clanking around like a clumsy chef in a new kitchen.
Draco wrapped his fingers around Harry's hand, drawing it from his mouth. He planted another kiss on his fingers, and Harry's skin tingled even through the glove. "I would be honoured to teach you," Draco murmured. "I don't know how competently I'll be able to given that you don't have a wand but I will do my best. It shouldn't be too great a challenge; I am practically the best in my class, after all."
Plump little Mrs. Joyce bounced up onto the stage when McGonagall had said her piece. She beamed at her audience of students, particularly showering her own with open affection. Mrs. Joyce might be a bit of a disaster when it came to organisation skills, but she had a heart of gold.
"I just don't get it," Jackie muttered. The weight of her hand plucking mulishly on the front of Harry's shirt drew his attention back to her. Her head was bowed but he could still make out her frown through the darkness. "Potting Point is surely safer for you. You dad's the bloody regional police officer."
A lord. A prophecy. Harry had more time to think in the past days than he'd known what to do with. He didn't know much but he could make connections. This bloody lord, this bloody war, and the madwoman who had escaped punishment for what she'd done in that war and was now trying to – what?
He lurched forward and stepping in line of the wand before he knew what he was doing. Still unable to shake his fixed gaze, Harry's still clutched Draco's while his other rose before himself to ward off – what? Something. Anything. The reality that his dad was holding a wand, perhaps.
It didn't matter, wasn't related, but Harry couldn't help but hunch his shoulders slightly at the thoughts provoked. Bellatrix hadn't been found. Not yet. There were people on her tail, wizard police – aurors, as Sirius had corrected him – and they would find her. They
"How is that even possible?" Harry asked, frozen in step outside the fluorescent store that reeked of grease and salt.
Harry didn't bother fighting her this time. Nodding into Jill's shoulder, he accepted the suffocating hold of his two closest friends without complaint. There'd never been anything to complain about in the first place.
"You've got to be kidding me," Harry said, rolling his eyes as she dragged him to the opposite end of the hall. "You're completely ignoring everything that Ron and Hermione just said."
"Nothing's going to happen," Lily had said. From the set of her jaw, the little nod of her head, it seemed more for her own benefit than Harry's. "Nothing will happen to you, Harry."
"Could you just tell me what's going on?" Harry asked, picking up his pace and managing to fall into step beside Draco. He frowned at Draco's profile, the sharp, impassive lines of his expression and his gaze trained stoically forward. "I can't do a bloody thing about it if you don't explain it to me."
Now was different, and even more different because Harry wouldn't become an auror. Not anymore. He didn't think he could.
"It's certainly not a bad thing," Hermione told him, and she did so repeatedly. "There's nothing bad about maturing into being capable of managing your anger, Harry."
An aristocrat who apparently embodied everything her companions did. The pair of hulking boys, as blank-faced as frozen gargoyles, regarded Jackie with the intelligence of particularly uncommunicative gorillas. A dirty-haired boy stared her down with slightly narrowed eyes, while the dark boy at his side, tall and casually slouching against the wall, stared with open curiosity. The blond boy at the girl's side, similarly leaning with arms crossed, stared with eyes so hooded that Harry could have sworn he was halfway to falling asleep.
have a library on medieval torture, even if he'd been exposed to more gruesome pictures than he felt comfortable with admitting. But his words died in his mouth as he saw Pansy's eyebrows rise. She planted her chair beside Jackie's – or not quite beside, but closer than it usually was.
He looked almost short next to the bald man, but not in a diminutive way. He looked a little dressed-down, too, in simple jeans that seemed fit him like a second skin and a dark jacket with sleeves tugged down to his knuckles hands, but it didn't detract from him. Not in the least. If anything, it only seemed to enhance him.
Draco, arms dropping onto those of the chair with the kind of casual grace he seemed to innately possess, jerking his chin at the book resting in Harry's lap. "Chapter three, isn't it?" At Harry's nod, he shrugged. It nudged Harry slightly where he leant, but even that was commonplace and somehow comfortable these days. "I just skimmed it. You don't need to read anything but Cragstone's analogous description on page forty-nine. The rest is just unnecessarily flowery prose."
Harry nodded, and that was enough for Ipetsky. Offering a brief, communal farewell to the room in the form of a lazy wave, he sauntered out as though he owned the place. The static silence that arose in his absence was likely ominous only to Draco.
"Why, thank you," Pansy replied smoothly. "I've always considered myself of a sophisticated class above such trivial personas."
Draco frowned, lips thinning as he pressed them together. Harry was growing to recognise that expression as the "you clearly don't know what you're talking about, so don't undermine my belief system" look. Harry almost sighed at Draco's retreat into Stuffy Git. Jackie's parents were religious, but they certainly had nothing on the demanding enforcement of their beliefs as Draco appeared to. What were the odds that Draco would be so taken with magic? And clearly the supposedly 'real' magic, too, rather than the tricks and sleight of hand the Harry practiced.
Then Von was turning and striding down the hallway, weaving between workers with long steps and the fluidity of a fish darting through its school. Harry saw him turn into the distant door of Studio Eleven barely seconds later. With a small shake of his head, he turned back to his friends.
"Magic is real," Harry said. "Hogwarts teaches people that have the ability to do it how to use it properly. That's why I'm going. I didn't know, not for way too long, that I could but now I do so…"
"Well, it bloody well should," Pansy said. "Honestly, what do you have to do around here to get proper food."
There was a question beneath that question. Harry heard it, even if he couldn't quite make out the specific words. Even so, he felt it. Thought and felt that maybe he might have been able to discern what they were anyway.
"I can still feel my stomach muscles protesting," Draco grumbled. "And that's saying nothing of the fact that you still never have more than three drinks when we go out because of the calories."
He knew he had to, and not only because half a week within the safety of his flat had chewed through every tasteful piece of food he possessed. There were means of getting around that, services he could contact, but Draco had never favoured giving his address out to strangers, let alone inviting them to visit his very door. He didn't want just about anyone in his house, for that matter; it was his territory, and his alone.
"Just say it," Harry suggested, which earned him a glare that he easily shrugged off. "How bad can it be?"
The four Hogwarts students – because two of the original six had disappeared, leaving only Harry and Jackie's partners and the two gorilla boys – lined the wall just as they had the previous week. They stared at Harry and Jackie as they approached stared at them upon their approach as though they were nothing short of repulsive. Maybe they were to their eyes, Harry considered. Plenty of other people certainly seemed to think so.
Harry didn't know, and he hadn't asked Draco at the time. He wasn't about to then either as Draco led the way from the Apparition room through a door and down a short flight of stairs. Spilling out onto a sedate room cast in a post-lunch lethargy, it looked like any other pub with its smattering of diners prodding at their meals and sipping from mugs.
Harry eyed Draco sidelong, but no reply was forthcoming. Not for a long beat and several of Draco's slow, hooded blinks. Harry shifted on his perch, aware but strangely enough not minding all too much that he was so close to Draco – to his old rival Malfoy – that he could all but feel his body warmth in the already warm common room. Why it felt somehow less awkward with Draco than his friends, less of a problem, less of a taboo to touch and be close, Harry didn't know.
He didn't blame the Dursleys. Not anymore. He couldn't find it within himself to care for their part in his messy past, and any resentment he may have once felt had been overwhelmed by more. By worse. By what had followed and had nothing to do with the Dursleys at all. How could Harry explain any of that to Draco when it was, by and large, so complicated and inexplicable?
"We just established otherwise," Draco murmured, but so quietly that Harry was likely the only one to hear him.
Von was still all but gushing – much to Ginny's amusement, Hermione's visible exasperation, and Ron's ogling – when the elevator pinged to eject them onto their floor. Harry led the way out, Von at his side, and paused alongside the wall of the bustling corridor to gather his slowly, almost hesitantly following friends.
"I'll bring him back," she said feverishly. "I will. I'll find a way, my Lord. I'll bring you back, bring you back, you know I will. I'll find a way, I'll do it, me, your most faithful…"
If anything, he found such earliness a benefit these days. Harry had a workout routine he was to abide by, and on the instances that he was led astray from that routine he was called into the office to see Dot, or to meet his newest client. It served him well to have a modicum of wakefulness about him when Von latched him in his claws and sought to make a mess of whatever disaster sleep had made of Harry's appearance.
But they were back, and that meant there would be outcry. Good or bad – though most likely bad – it would have to be dealt with. Given that Harry had both faith in Dot and evidence that she and the rest of the few others who had known his whereabouts had remained silent on the matter, he would need to come out and explain himself.
His cheeks felt like they were on fire. He could still feel Draco's kiss upon his lips. It was wonderful, felt right, but it also somehow left him feeling like he was standing buck naked before his parents. There were some things that shouldn't be seen when a kid reached a certain age. It felt deeply personal in a way Harry hadn't experienced before.
A finger touched his cheek, and Harry twitched before tipping his head into the coolness of Draco's hand. Blinking his eyes open, he stared at the pale oval of Draco's face before raising his free hand and resting it over Draco's.
The sound of Draco's voice was felt through Harry's shoulder, just as his eating had been, and it was so quiet and polite that he almost didn't register he'd been spoken to. Hauling himself from the page, Harry glanced up at him.
"On you." The flicker rekindled in Harry's gut, stronger this time, with a mirror rising in his cheeks that coaxed a flush of warmth to the surface. "When I sat. On you." Another swallow. "Sorry."
Or what about a courtesy call? A little bit of prior warning would certainly have made sense. Classes hadn't even started yet.
"There," Dimitri said, voice once more thickened with approval. "I think I can work with this. Thank you for finding him, Pansy."
"I could think of a thing or two to do with it," Harry said, though purchasing a dove or any other kind of bird was about the least important thing that came to mind. Especially when Draco looped his own arm around Harry in return, draping it comfortably over his shoulders. He wasn't more than an inch or two taller than Harry, but it somehow fit perfectly.
"So it's not real magic?" he asked, rearing back slightly in his wobbly school chair with his voice pitching lowly.
Another shiver. It didn't feel nearly so discomforting this time, and though a twist feeling still coiled Harry's gut, the thoughts
But then… Well, he was a little weird, too. How could he judge Draco for his beliefs and way of life if he expected to be accepted himself?
"No," Harry said slowly, "just like this." With another flick of his wrist, he vanished the rose back to where it had come from.
Harry shook his head as he led the way from the library. His friends… 'Jack and Jill', his father had once quipped, grinning proudly at his own cleverness, but he couldn't be further from the truth. Far be it from being similar, or perhaps even romantically inclined, as the traditional rhyme suggested, Jackie and Jillian were opposites. Black and white, or 'good and evil' as Jackie claimed, they couldn't be more different.
Harry didn't move. He couldn't reach for it even as the dryness of his tongue demanded it of him, pleaded that he reach for the water. He couldn't look away from her, standing over him, her hands planted on her hips, and all but glaring.
If anything, it was that rather than Jackie's persistence that convinced. They would do a bloody presentation on magic. It would be the best damned presentation of the lot, too, and it would be entirely between him and Jackie. Draco and Pansy could sit there, eyeing them like they were demons who'd hauled themselves from the depths of hell, but Harry wouldn't budge.
"What?" Ron all but yelped as he jerked straight from leaning against the couch. A globule of what looked like beef landed on the couch just before Harry's toes, and he absently edged his feet away from it. "That's not –"
Dimitri's office was unchanged from how Draco had first seen it years before. One of the few photographers granted not only his own rooms but a suite adjacent to a studio for his own personal use, it breathed prestige and superiority in a way that Draco hadn't initially realised. Regardless, he let himself through the door with barely a knock and swept through the studio to the office itself, pausing only as he reached the doorway.
Which was why, at ten o'clock that evening, Draco found himself outside of a thumping club aglow with red and orange lights that somehow made it seem subdued rather than kitschy. It was why he had his camera slung over his shoulder yet hidden by a Disillusionment Charm, and why he nodded at the bouncer as he stepped past the absence of a line on a Monday night.
"I'm taking him away, James," she said, barely hearing him. "I'll take him away, use magic to hide us."
Grumbling to himself, Von wandered across the room to prop himself on the arm of the couch alongside Harry. "What time were you in this morning?" he asked.
Once, Draco would have seethed at being ignored in such a manner. Once, he would have scowled and demanded some kind of greeting, because it was polite, and because he wasn't the kind of person to be bloody-well overlooked. Much had changed since such demands even tickled the edges of Draco's consideration. If anything, he appreciated the disregard. Shoving his hands into his pockets, drawing his gaze out the yawning entrance of the Tesco and the echoing, equally yawning absence of shoppers beyond, he'd never wanted to be noticed less in his life.
Draco noticed Harry as soon as he stepped through the door. It felt like he had a radar for it. Or maybe that was how boyfriends just were? Harry wasn't sure, but he couldn't help picking up his pace as he crossed the room. Draco straightened in his seat, turning from the conversation he'd been having with Pansy.
There was no need for the tokenistic 'to study' anymore. A meeting at the library would more often than not lead to a wander around town, likely stopping off at the community gardens – a good spot to practice magic for the surplus of private and shaded corners, even in the chill of winter – then to grab a snack, have a tea, or have Harry call Lily to let her know he'd be out for dinner. Sometimes they visited the shopping centre. A couple of times the local arcade, which would never cease to be hilarious when Draco was involved. He was no less competitive than Harry was.
But Jill? How anyone could think that Jillian was worthy of bullying was a mystery to Harry. It had always been a mystery, even when they'd first become friends at twelve years old and she'd come out to him.
That was who Potter was, after all. Draco had resented him for that in the past, just as he had so many other things. But he watched Potter from his periphery and listened with half an ear to Picard's sharp words, and those other things rose to the fore. As he thought of the coming months and what they promised, Draco's fingers itched for his camera. He watched, thought, and wondered.
Draco's lips thinned. A muscle in his cheek twitched. He stared up at Harry, and though he didn't frown, Harry was given the impression that he was being scowled at nonetheless. A long pause hung between them, the silence thick, and Harry's skin was crawling before it was alleviated. He'd never been a particularly patient person.
Harry didn't need to ask, and certainly not aloud. Draco's lips tugged briefly to the side before he spoke, as much to Harry as to Dot. "It won't be a problem. Not to us. It's nothing we can't handle." He squeezed Harry's hand slightly, warmly, before adding a dry, "besides, I'm not so easily cowed as to not fight for what I want."
Jackie grunted. Harry knew she knew as well as he did himself that his commitment wasn't the only reason he continued with Physical Education. It was one of the few ways he could play sports after the football coach had quietly informed him that it might be in his best interest to quit the team after he'd come out.
He dove through the curtain in a snap. The hallway was dark, narrow, and spotted with more curtains like a forest of heavy cloth-trees. Hissing beneath his breath, the sound swallowed by the music thudding even through the heavy curtain behind him, Draco strode along the hallway and cursed what a stupid accommodation was provided. He hated it, hated it, hated –
"Well, when you nearly get blasted to pieces in your first round of a tournament, it sort of sets you up for failure."
It made it just a little easier to consider as a real possibility rather than a wistful passing thought.
"Hey, how do you know?" Harry asked with a chuckle. "The private school kids are sensible too, you know."
Harry couldn't help but be captured. Interest was a rarity not likely to be missed. He didn't recognise the uniforms, didn't know the woman who led her troupe of what had to be barely forty kids of about Harry's age, and that made it a curiosity. He couldn't have moved if he'd wanted to.
Lily came home immediately. Remus arrived. James railed, spoke louder and with more words than Harry could understand or comprehend, and Sirius' spitting input only seemed to add fuel to his raging fire. He'd swept around the living room like a whirlwind, tripping over PJ twice before he'd told Sirius to get the dog out of the room, and nearly struck the wall every time he walked past it.
It was almost a blessing when the guest teacher – or professor, as it were – climbed onto the stage to take over from Mr. Hastings. Professor McGonagall was as tall and straight-backed as Harry had seen her that morning, and she pinned the students of both schools beneath her stare firmly enough that the murmurs that had arisen in Mr. Hastings' speech died at once.
Draco had been to few enough clubs in his time, but he knew that much at least. He knew he didn't like them and he knew what to expect.
"… sure you recognise Draco Malfoy, too," Picard was saying, and only Draco's name spoken aloud managed to shake him back to himself. Not quite enough to turn from Potter, however. Definitely not when, quite unexpectedly, Potter smiled.
"Maybe not so impossibly," Pansy said with a sigh. She shook her head, turning and propping herself against the side of the table as though defeated. "It was always that way with you two, you know? If you didn't hate one another then you were bound to go in the complete opposite direction."
Harry had learnt. In barely five months, he'd learnt of a whole new world he hadn't known existed, let alone considered himself to be a part of. Interviewers like Gertrude were just one more player in the elaborate stage show.
"You know what I mean. It's nice. It feels good." She'd smiled a little self-deprecatingly, and Harry hadn't known why until she shrugged awkwardly and continued. "As you can probably tell, it's not exactly the most comfortable thing for me specifically, but for everyone else? Did you know that scientists suspect the effect of physical contact actually has significant beneficial physiological effects? I was reading this paper a few months ago…"
Harry tucking his jacket around himself a little tighter, folding it across himself with one hand as the other dug in his pocket for his gloves. It was particularly cold that day, unseasonably so, and Harry left only a thumb free as he extracted his phone out and dialled a number from memory.
"I know," Harry said, and likely he truly did. Draco knew he would have and could accept that he did, but in some ways, despite that even to simply look at him would give evidence that he was model material, it still struck Draco that he was a very different person to the boy he'd once known.
"Wait, what?" Sirius stuttered as though he hadn't just been assuming as much. "Seriously? You actually are?"
Maybe it was a little like how Harry felt. How, with Draco, it felt alright to sit with him, to sit on him, to simply absorb the warmth and comfort of contact from someone he no longer hated but couldn't claim he really liked all that much either. Maybe, just like it was for Harry, Draco could speak because there was nothing much between them anymore.
"Every job has its requirements, Draco," Harry said, sighing with what he would admit was a little bit dramatic. How many times had they had this conversation?
"So, that's Apparition," he murmured, taking a slow turn as he looked around the room. He kept his hold on Draco's hand the whole time. "Crazy to think that teleportation actually exists."
. Because Draco cared. He cared just as much if not more about what Harry wanted than his own desires, and that meant something so vast that Harry almost couldn't conceive it. He didn't know what he could possibly say in return.
"No, perhaps not. I've no doubt it will do your name a degree of good in the long run, if not so greatly in the near future."
"I wouldn't say that two instances equate to forming a habit," Draco said, the regal tilt of his chin rising slightly higher. He had a long neck. Harry hadn't realised he liked that until that moment. "But if you're referring to my staying behind while the rest of my classmates have left, then yes, I have done so.
But he didn't want to. Draco was all Harry needed right now. Yet, somehow, Draco still seemed to question that need. Just as he questioned Harry's commitment to taking it a step further.
James drew his wand from his pocket. It too shook as he held it over Harry, his voice wavering as he spoke an incantation and a scatter of white sparks drifted down over the top of him. For a moment, the fell, resting, peppering Harry's face like fairy dust. Then they flared blue.
"Maybe we could come again on the weekend?" Hermione suggested. "There's a sign on the counter that says they have a two-for-one special on Sunday morning."
His words garnered a smattering of glances, though more than a few turned away just as quickly. They were used to the picking and taunting of those particular meatheads when it came to Harry and his friends.
Considering it held barely eighty people in what could potentially seat over five hundred, the flurry of movement and flung conversations was disproportionately loud and erratic. It was almost a relief to step out onto the other side of the greater mass..
The crinkle of the map in Jill's hands as she repositioned it was almost overridden by that of Jackie riffling through her bag of jellybeans as she simultaneously made a show of twisting in her seat. Hanging awkwardly in the hammock of her seat belt, she peered down at the map as Jill studied it intently.
Except that Harry had saved Draco from fiendfyre. He'd stood for him in court. He'd given him his wand back, and he hadn't asked for anything in return. And, after that, when Draco had returned to London, he hadn't hated him. He hadn't even seemed to dislike him.
"Besides, Draco's with me," Harry said as his parents fidgeted with obvious reluctance in the doorway. "If anything happens, I'm sure he'll go and get you."
Not even Draco believed his own thoughts. He doubted he would have been particularly convincing to anyone if they asked how he felt about Harry's defensiveness. Draco could defend himself, had clawed his way into becoming a photographer in a hateful world, and he could stand on his own two feet. But he didn't think he could convincingly deny that Harry standing up for him – it really meant something. It meant something bigger than Draco knew what to make of.
"Or act so smart," Draco murmured nearly inaudibly. Harry glanced towards him, momentarily confused by what he meant, before Pansy recaptured his attention.
Now, he'd made his decision. He would have to suffer the consequences of living the life he'd chosen.
For the first time since he'd begun attending Hogwarts, Harry was reconsidering his enthusiasm for visiting the Burrow for Christmas that year. A foolish thought, but nonetheless real.
Even so, Harry had cringed. He wanted to tell his friends. He did. It was just that he couldn't. Not yet. Maybe soon – hopefully soon – but there was a big difference between being in a relationship with someone and having everyone know about it. Especially when something as complicated as the other giant-sized secret between him and Draco existed.
Draco didn't need him to explain what he was talking about. Not when, after the first day, he'd 'left' him something each time they parted. It was almost strange how quickly and easily they slipped into habits that felt like traditions.
Draco felt his eyebrows rise and almost raised his voice to speak – to rebuff what could have been a criticism, or to lessen the open honestly Harry displayed even a little – but Clementine was chuckling in a warm, rich voice. "Are you attempting to curry favour with me?" she asked.
Draco shook his head just as quickly as Harry had previously nodded. "No," he said, his voice a little hoarse. "No, I don't want you to – to stop."
Harry shrugged. "There's not a whole lot of space anywhere else." Sliding a leg over the bench, he spared a glance for Zabini at his other side. "Unless you object?"
If Dimitri kept speaking, Draco didn't hear him. He thought he might have done, but he didn't care. All of Draco's attention – his abruptly dumbfounded attention – had swung and become fixed upon the picture that Dimitri had grazed his fingers across moments before. That picture…
In the face of the letter and the truths it rightly accused him of, that memory, rising in his mind like a static image – not a moving one but a Muggle one – gave Draco a lifeline to cling onto. It had in each instance that vengeful, hateful thoughts had manifested in Draco's mind for the past week – about Ipetsky, about the hatred flung upon him for his photography, about the glares and scowls and muttered curses shot his way as he passed down a hallway at
The woman blinked. For a moment, she stared at Harry contemplatively. Then she nodded. "We are indeed. I take it you must be a sixth form student at this school?"
being considered the stain that smeared Harry Potter's good name for the notice it afforded. Draco recognised that, and he knew it reflected his own situation almost perfectly.
Jackie shrugged, not even bothering to deny it – until she abruptly jerked to a stop in step. Her smile faded into a frown as she stared ahead down the corridor, opened her mouth, closed it again, then asked, "Just what the bloody hell are they doing?"
With a start, Harry nearly fell off his chair. Unintentionally, that was; his unbalance was primarily due to the firm foot that Jackie planted on the edge of his seat and the forceful kick she thrust into it. With a lurch, Harry dropped his book and only just managed to keep himself upright as the chair rocked precariously.
"Can't you like both, then, hon?" Calliope asked. "Although, I don't know why you'd think it such a bad thing to just be one or the other. Why, I'll have you know that some of the greatest legends had male partners."
But incrementally, slowly, Harry's expression softened just a little. Something almost like a smile touched one corner of his lips and he nodded. "Sure, Draco. I'd like that."
Throughout it all, Draco stood almost silently at his side. He held Harry's hand in a warm clasp, their fingers linked, and Harry pretended that he didn't feel it tremble.
"It's lira, isn't it, Blaise," Pansy said, stepping in with heavy-lidded grace and confidence. Only the slight tightness around her eyes gave away that she knew how close Blaise's slip had been.
Dropping his chin onto Draco's shoulder, because he knew that Draco not so secretly liked the contact, he scooted into his side slightly. "Guess it's a good thing I'm not Muggle, then," he said.
But it didn't matter that he wouldn't actually be able to invite Ron along. Dot and Pansy both had spoken of inviting Harry's friends in for a shoot to include in the series, but he had little enough involvement in the decision at this point. Outside of the interview series, it wasn't worth the bother. Ron had about as little concern for fashion and modelling as Hermione, though he did partake of spending on what he termed 'nice clothes' with the money he'd never had before. At Harry's suggestion, however, he only wrinkled his nose and made a retching sound.
It wasn't looking to be a good day so far, and a part of Draco, the immature part of him that still clung to the entitled and admittedly spoilt child he'd once been, urged him to say to hell with it. To just go home. To leave the world for the day to sort itself out, because he couldn't face it. Draco knew he wouldn't, but the thought was unerringly tempting.
Or, perhaps the worst of the lot, "Were you talking to Weasley earlier? Why on earth would you interact with such a distasteful person? The lower rungs of society, as it were."
The words went unsaid, but Draco heard them nonetheless. Yu and Dawley didn't know Harry, didn't speak to him with more than a passing word here or there, and all but worshipped him when they did. They were as fiercely defensive of their Harry Potter as the rest of the world was.
"Our magic," Draco clarified, and Harry grinned. Ours. Like he really was a part of it, too. "Aren't you always the one arguing with me over theatrics and illusions being 'real' too?"
Harry wasn't quite like anyone's expectations. Not even Draco's. He was realising that only more and more the longer he spent in his company.
"Hm." Dimitri drew his gaze up and down Draco once more. From anyone else, Draco might have found such assessment disconcerting or even solicitous, but Dimitri was purely thoughtful. "You've got the look for it, certainly."
"If you're not comfortable with all of this, I can see if it's possible for you to give the shoot a miss," Harry said.
"You're not going to pass out or anything if I hug you, are you?" Jackie asked. "Damn, I always said you were a skinny runt to begin with, but seriously? Are you trying to prove me wrong?"
"I'll be back in a second," Harry said over his shoulder, though he doubted either Ron or Hermione heard him. Picking up his pace, he trotted the rest of the way down the hall, skirting past another cluster of younger students as they rose to their feet, and rounded the Little Head Table to where the professors were seated.
"That's impossible," Jackie echoed Jill's words, albeit far more objectionably than Jill had. "That's not – you can't just –"
Jackie smirked. "Damn hide of you, disappearing and all just to skive off school. And our goddamn presentation. You prat."
He cut himself of at a sharp knock on the door. Harry settled himself back into his seat as Von immediately skirted around him and made his way towards it, drawing his wand and wordlessly to unlock it. There was no need to ask who stood on the other side; Dot was the only one who hammered with such fiercely precise entitlement.
"Because it's not." Draco sliced across her words again. He was so still, so tense beneath Harry, that Harry felt the sudden urge to scoot away from him. The feeling hadn't struck him for a long time, and it felt somehow… hurtful. "Pansy, it's not."
"Just not enough to take the class herself," Jackie said. She still looked a little glassy-eyed but had managed to look away from Pansy for a few seconds to assess Blaise. "She's helping Abel out. He's hopeless without her."
Draco sniffed, and what would have once been a gesture of aloofness Harry now interpreted as being a touch of embarrassment. "Sadly, yes. Pureblood hierarchies. Don't ask me why it's a thing. It just is."
"Blimey," Ron said again as soon as they were shunted from the dressing rooms. "You do that every day, Harry? You actually – you mean you actually –?"
James' voice was choked, his own breath ragged, but Lily hardly heard him. She had the strength only to clutch Harry, to stare down at him with an unblinking plea speaking made truth of her words. "Just asleep." Her voice warbled. "It's alright, he's just asleep, he's just –"
"The painting." Malfoy gestured towards the side wall, to where Harry's periphery caught sight of Terpsichore sidling back into her frame. "She came and got me a couple of minutes ago."
Then she'd left, but the way she smiled was very telling. Harry didn't think there was much of a 'trial' truly involved. Not when it came to Draco.
, Von had said. Harry didn't think that 'better-ness' had anything to do with it. Harry was just… Harry.
had shifted multiple times throughout the brief period that Draco had been seated, but it chose that exact moment to fall into a lull. The stagnant silence seemed to echo with potential but also something a little more ominous. Draco loved Pansy and could tolerate few others as he could one of his oldest friends, but her offers were rarely made without a few hidden landmines buried out of sight.
"Oh, yeah, good thinking." Jackie turned on her heel, leading the way back to their friends. "I'm starving."
If it was a little more pronounced, a little more frequent, and just a little more aggressive of late…
"Not at all," Pansy replied with a benevolence Draco knew was a refined facade. "I had an opening in my day, and your office isn't so far out of my way."
And struggling to enfold himself into sleep that wouldn't come because thoughts of Draco, and himself, and of them together battered at him in a myriad of confusing, muddled images that had him even more hot and bothered, even more awake than he'd been before.
"Do you want me to take the charm off your scar?" Von said, standing before him and all but blocking out the glaring brightness of the vanity lights.
Harry shrugged. He spun his quill in his fingers, absently tapping the dry nib upon his barely-touched essay. He couldn't even remember what he'd been writing about. "It's just a question," he murmured.
Draco stood in casual wait, looking like a bloody Levi model in his jeans and thick jacket. Harry swallowed. It still rocked him that Draco -
"Yes, well." McGonagall's lips twitched again, and Harry was sure it wasn't in annoyance this time. "You can still think about it, Potter. The season isn't set to start just yet."
"I won't be long, though. I promise. Then we'll go… somewhere. I don't know where, but we'll get out of here. And I'll tell you everything I can."
"I wasn't –? Jackie, we practically always meet outside the library. Why the hell would you go to the locker rooms?"
The director didn't really care. Draco knew that. More than likely, the man was only being civil to Draco because Harry had made of show of raising a hand between Draco and a swinging fist. A hand that, despite being little enough protection, had effectively stayed the white-knuckled punch. If he was anything even vaguely reminiscent of Billy in his own adoration, the director wouldn't be so stupid as to act in an untoward fashion so quickly afterwards.
That condescension, as well as Pansy's now-expected curled lip, were in full thrall at that moment. Harry ignored the twinge that suggested he retreat from people who didn't want his company; that was for most people, not obligatory partners in classwork.
Harry laughed. The sound was stolen by a gust of chilling wind, and he hitched his shoulders against it as Draco tucked his own hands into his pockets and his chin into the collar of his coat. "It's bloody freezing out here," Harry said. "Should we head back to the rest of them and go inside?"
Pansy chuckled. She actually chuckled rather that raising her hackles indignantly. "Of course. But I also have the ability to sift through the bullshit and see the truth that lies beneath."
Draco could hate someone but still recognise they were gorgeous. He'd practiced just that habit for years. But what did it mean when that hatred was abruptly found to be… just a little less profound than it had been?
"Do you mind?" Draco said from behind Harry. Or beside him, Harry realised, as he took his own step forwards. "We were in the middle of a conversation that you rudely interrupted. You'll have to bother someone else, given you so clearly seek the attention of the little children you are."
"Oh, I doubt that. Ginny Weasley has been a basket case for years. You were just too blind to see it."
He didn't let the thought show, let alone slip through his lips. Maintaining his smile, Harry tipped his own head to mirror Gertrude's considering tilt. "What do you mean by that?"
Harry paused, shifting his attention to where she admittedly towered over him. It wasn't solely because of her unearthly shoes, either; she would have rivalled Madame Clementine in height. The girl – for she was only young and couldn't have been more than twenty years old – was stunningly beautiful in a way that had little to do with her makeup, though was certainly enhanced by it. The contouring on her cheeks, the heavy liner around her eyes, the rich curve of her similarly lined lips, all pieced together to build the face of someone that would stop shoppers if pinned to a billboard.
Harry allowed himself a small smile. How easily swayed they both were, that a simple decision could have them disregarding years of derisive address to speak with familiarity. Nothing but a hint of boredom touched Draco's words. It was almost as though they hadn't been rivals at all, and the thought, the difference, the change that was more apparent in that instance than Harry had considered it before, struck him then.
As the studio climbed in echoing volume, the crew falling from their precise attentiveness to the casualness of their lunch break, Harry was all but shaken by the eagerness of the girl that was still clutching his hand and speaking profusely in words that he couldn't understand. From the way she reached for his lapel to pluck at it, how she gestured to his hair with an appreciative hum, he supposed her opinion of him was influenced by his modelling history, but still. Disconcerting.
"I don't…" Harry sunk his teeth into his lip. Was it the same? What Ron had described, how he felt – could it be the same? Harry didn't know, but talking, even intermittently, and sharing space, and just being together… Was it the same?
was… well, it was young, up-and-coming, and largely grey when considering future expectations for the magazine itself, but it had more than made a name for itself. Swiftly, efficiently, and in an unexpected explosion of popularity. Draco had taken as much interest in it as any other magazine – which was to say that he'd brought half a dozen copies over the past six months and read each issue back-to-back – and they were clearly doing something right.
"Expressly instantaneously," James said, jabbing a finger at him with such obvious undertones that Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes. "I don't care if this is a Muggle hospital –"
"See if he can fix you up a little, too. I don't like to think of what he'll do when he sees your hair, Harry. Merlin help us all, he'll go on a rampage."
"They are," he said, raising the camera slightly for Harry to better see the screen. It wasn't typical protocol to show such glimpses to anyone but his closest correspondents on the floor for consultation and consideration. But Draco found he didn't really care. Not when it came to Harry.
Draco eyed at the bright yellow sign above the doorway. "There aren't any local to the town near Hogwarts."
"Alright, then," she said, scratching out a few words. "I figure today we'll just have a bit of a rundown of what we'll be doing, brainstorm the potential routes we want to take, and work from there. Yes?"
Draco, momentarily distracted by the mention of Hermione – who Harry had learned some time ago was a rival of sorts not only for being in a different school House but because she was the only person who challenged his academic status – hauled himself back to the moment. Surprisingly, after a moment of staring and blinking, he broke into a wide smile.
Voldemort. Death Eaters. Magical creatures that made dragons look tame, and a Wizarding world rife with hexes and curses flung with terrifying carelessness. All of it Harry had faced before and he hadn't backed down. Not once. He couldn't.
The distant murmur of voices beyond the door were all that interrupted the silence as Von worked – for work he did. Harry said in dutiful muteness as his face was wiped clean with cool cleansers and gentle scrubs that Von used as he claimed that 'the delicacy of a real human touch' would always be superior to magic in such cases. He didn't protest when Von proceeded to apply a thinner layer of make-up over immediately after, because there was a standard to uphold even outside of the studio, just as Harry maintained in his Von-appointed clothes. Harry rarely had the opportunity to do it himself; he was capable enough, but Von was better. Von knew it, too.
Harry didn't like fame. He never had. At school, it had been a begrudging necessity that no amount of derision could deflect. After the war, he'd accepted it because there was no escaping it, and because the desperate people that needed something to cling to in the grief and destruction that ensued turned to him. And after that, with his modelling… Harry would have been content to be a small face in the industry, but his name and pre-existing fame forbade such negligibility. He hadn't known that such disregard was what he'd sought all along until it was decidedly taken from him.
That pleasure, the longing and almost violent need, was glorious. But it was made all the more so for the fact that it was found with Harry, and that Harry wanted Draco. He
"Pansy kept me in touch with the world when I was overseas," Draco told Harry as the waiter left them with their orders dutifully jotted down. "She likely told me more than I was permitted to know, actually."
"That's not the quite the same thing as my liking," Draco murmured, though he still hadn't blinked away from his wide-eyed staring.
Something in Harry's chest squeezed. He swallowed thickly. When Jackie called again, followed by a similar demand from Blaise, he barely heard them. Standing beside Draco, meeting him eye to eye, it was as though any semblance of hesitancy had been stripped from him and torn to shreds.
Straightening, Harry raked a hand through his hair. Only to have it smacked away by the sharp slap of a hand.
A/N: So, I was going to wait a little longer to post this chapter, make it a regular with another week, but it feels too much like the second half of Chapter 10 for me to wait that long. So, have it a little early! Hope you enjoy.
It was a quick stop to pick up those they'd left behind, and it didn't take much convincing to conclude the best possible outcome for the evening would be an in-house restaurant before proceeding into the warm depths of their rooms.
"This is really good, Harry," Ginny said, swiping a finger into her bowl instead of her fork. She grinned as she stuck it in her mouth, a childlike mannerism that she'd have never been caught dead doing when she was actually a child. "Where did you get it from?"
. Harry wasn't sure if it was a good thing or not to consider himself about as practiced in the art of afflicting memory loss as Gilderoy Lockheart had once been. He certainly wouldn't ask of the morality of his actions from Hermione; memory spells were a sore spot for her.
Harry's silent laugh flicked him with another ribbon of warmth. "Funny," he murmured in reply. "I kind of like you too. Good to know we're on the same page."
Draco slowed in step, turning towards where Pansy strode towards him, her high shoes clacking on the marble floor of the largely empty foyer. Even after a whole day interviewing she appeared composed, freshly groomed as though she'd just stepped out of the bathroom after gussying up. Most likely she actually had, knowing Pansy as Draco did.
There was something about them. Something about the way the dancers danced too close, their bodies undulating against one another in a mimic of sex. How shoulders pressed against one another and stayed pressed, suggestive and demanding, and lips breathed whispers in ears, warm and enticing. That a stare across the club wasn't simply a stare but an invitation, that a hand brushing past was similarly inviting, and that, more often than not, the drinking and the headiness of the club itself incited passion that revelled in the ready escape of Apparition.
With a sharp glance sideways, Harry turned away from him. The discomforting roiling in his belly had tightened sickeningly, and he thought that if he stayed any longer he might very well empty the contents of his stomach at the Apparition point.
"You didn't tell me about your grandad's funeral literally a month ago until I specifically asked. I had to bloody well ask, Jackie."
Why, he didn't know. It was still a mystery. Why not his friends either was also unclear, though Harry supposed that he might be able to relate to that a little himself. He told Ron and Hermione just about everything, but there were still parts that he couldn't speak of. There were still fears he couldn't voice, regrets that he knew he shouldn't admit to, not to them, and revelations about himself that barely made sense to him but seemed to be becoming more and more pronounced in his stagnant world of disrupted priorities.
"What's his name?" Von asked from across the room as he pushed himself off the wall. His looming returned.
Draco swallowed thickly. He knew he was to blame for what had happened in the wat. He knew he'd done wrong. If he was to do his time again, he even knew that he'd do the same thing all again. What else was he supposed to do? It wasn't like he had a choice in the matter. It wasn't like he could step out of the situation whenever he pleased. It wasn't possible to simple shrug, decide he didn't like what the Dark Lord demanded of him, and say no.
They were the same. Harry hadn't truly been expecting anything from the Hogwarts students, even if it would have been nice, but no. They were all the same. If not with homophobia and the instinctive urge to ostracise and create a common enemy, people clearly found a reason to shun Harry and his friends.
Draco didn't much like to be ignored – at least not by Harry – but he could withstand it for a time. Especially when such a peaceful expression settled on Harry's face as he lost himself in his staring. He really did seem to have a taste for the view, which was far from unwarranted. For Draco, though…
He'd reached the tenth floor landing and paused to readjust the bag slung over his shoulder when his phone rang. Closing his eyes briefly –
"That's not how hybridisation works," Harry said, raising his eyebrows. "You can't cross a bird with a horse. Or a lion, for that matter."
"Yeah," Ginny said, shaking herself from her staring. "Besides, it'll be interesting to actually see you at work for once. The man behind the photograph and all that." She bumped his shoulder with her own, nervousness dissipating into her usual toothy grin. "My team will be so jealous."
He was tall. He loomed like a wraith. The drag of his sleeve hung long and loose. A pale hand reached, the rod of his wand extended and pointed directly towards Lily's child - her
Harry opened his mouth to deny her but fell silent with a resigned shrug. She was right. The last time Jackie had tried to 'help' Harry with their group project she'd nearly burnt their kitchen down. That had been three years ago.
Which wasn't as unusual in the industry Harry found himself as he considered it otherwise would be. Or should be. Everyone seemed to wear a mask of sorts – that for work, and that which was tucked sadly beneath.
With an incredulous scoff, Ron rocked back on his stool. The sound was all but lost beneath the surrounding din of the club; the dancefloor thundered with music and the shouts of conversation around the bar and tables rose to compensate. At nearly midnight, the crowds had thickened, and Harry was only more grateful for Hermione's sensibility that insisted they arrive before ten to leave at a 'decent' hour.
It was very possible that it could be a ward. An Anti-Apparition ward. Which meant that, outside of that ward, Harry would be able to Apparate away. He didn't know for sure if he could manage it, but he'd try. He'd kill himself trying. He had to because, wherever he was, it was isolated. It was hidden. Harry didn't believe that his family weren't looking for him, that Draco wouldn't be looking for him after he'd promised to come for him and then never showed. They were looking, Harry was certain – just as he knew that they weren't going to find him. They would have already if it were possible.
"Know?" Harry frowned. He turned to Draco, was met by his hard profile staring murder at Pansy, then back to Pansy herself. "What are you talking about?"
Ron called him a bore because he didn't like to make an event out of anything anymore. Because he didn't like the idea of getting into trouble, or putting a toe out of line, or starting an argument as he once had. There were consequences these days, and not just for Harry but for Dot, and for Von, and for any possible jobs they might both have laid on the table for him. He and Ron were still best mates, but it was a distance that had grown between them that Harry wasn't sure he could erase. He wasn't even sure he wanted to.
The minimal crew, the same that were in company at the interview the day before, stood around the edges of the room. Von, because despite only being a stylist in name, he was always permitted into the shoots, and a pair of
Harry shook his head slowly. He wanted to glance towards Calliope, to ask just what the hell was going on. He wanted to ask Clio if he was imagining things, or Melpomene if he was maybe only hearing what he wanted to be true. He wanted to ask Thalia if this was some kind of a sick joke, and that Malfoy's changes, his differences, the parts that Harry had noticed and had grown far too fond of in the past year, were hiding the real him from where they'd been lurking in wait to strike at the moment it would hurt the most.
Just as Draco's arousal was all too apparent. That in itself wasn't foreign; whether Draco had only allowed it of himself since Harry had verbally returned his feelings or for some other reason entirely, sitting in Draco's lap had the unfortunate – or perhaps fortunate – side effect of knowing just when his thoughts drifted. Harry didn't find it anywhere near as alarming as he had the first time he'd noticed, though it was a novel experience once more to have it so close. So direct. To feel his warmth and hardness as skin upon skin, and –
"Three dates. Our relationship is still young. You and Draco are practically an old married couple."
But Draco didn't retract his words. If anything, his jaw only tightened further. Harry's hands slipped into his lap, the remains of his lunch forgotten. "Holy shit," he said. "That's kind of intense."
With a deep breath, a sighed exhalation, Harry draped his arms across his knees. It was likely unintentional – or was it? – but with hair mussed, his cheeks still slightly flushed, and naked from the waist down, it was such a perfectly languid pose that it could have been choreographed. Could have been scripted. Could have very easily taken prime place before Draco's lens and not looked amiss in the slightest, despite the promiscuity it entailed.
Talk of the new school, though, of Hogwarts, got him to thinking. It had been a curiosity buzzing on the edges of Harry's awareness all day. Potting Point High really wasn't big, but he supposed it being the largest in the city gave it enough credentials to engage in an exchange program of sorts.
If anything, the Howlers had become expected. They'd become amusing, if in a rather dark way. Draco almost regretted that they burnt themselves to dust before he could make a copy of them to plaster in a collage upon his wall. It would have been funny.
"And you," Blaise said, attention jumping from Draco. "I've seen you in the class we share, actually. I mean, who wouldn't notice you?"
"I missed the bus this morning," Harry explained, choosing to overlook the correction that he actually quite enjoyed running, thank you very much.
Pansy blinked. Draco's brow furrowed further, and he seemed suddenly to be shaken from his staring stupor. "What?" he said, as drawlingly flat as Harry was coming to expect of him.
"Well, this wasn't exactly what I'd expected," he said, his words invoking a lull from the majority of the room, "but I can't say I'm completely surprised. You could've picked someone a little less damaging to my mental health, though, mate."
Harry met the eyes of each of his family in turn: Sirius, peering at him sidelong as he pretended to be distracted with PJ. Remus, with his open acceptance of whatever was to come. James, his slight frown resurfacing and fingers curled around the back of Lily's chair, and Lily, leaning forwards in her seat with her chin in her hand, her fingers curled along the scar marring her face. She ran feather-light fingers across the shiny ridges as she always did when pondering, and Harry knew even before she spoke that she would be the one to initiate the conversation.
"You've been going for four hours straight," Harry murmured, dropping his hand back to the table. His leg settled against Draco's, though, lightly and without demand. Draco adjusted his own immediately against him.
, he thought, tipping his chin to rest against the side of Harry's head. He closed his eyes, though he didn't think he could fall back to sleep even if he'd wanted to.
He hadn't noticed the bed, either. He hadn't noticed a lot of things, but most importantly was the bed. Hazy, exhausted, and hurting as he was, Harry's nerves immediately became bowstring tight. Freezing against the wall, he watched wide-eyed and shaking – scared, so scared – as the patched blankets of the bed were flipped aside, a thin, pale arm flung free.
"Did you have plans? Being a journalist seems to suit you so well, Pansy. You've got a knack for it, you know. I sure as hell wouldn't be able to do what you do."
"We should start a swear jar again," Harry heard his father say. "We'd be able to buy the year's Christmas presents with our takings, I'd wager."
Harry hadn't realised his hands were shaking until his cup nearly slipped from his fingers. Catching himself, he swallowed thickly, reached for the jug and filled it once more as he knew he probably shouldn't – he had a shoot tomorrow, he knew he wasn't good with alcohol, and he didn't even like it that much – but he did. Harry drained half of it in one mouthful as Draco continued before dragging his attention back towards him.
"Did you do something magical then?" Harry asked, as much to distract himself as out of real curiosity.
Staring at him, eyes narrowing, Draco's fingers curled around the back of his chair. Harry heard it squeak beneath the pressure. "You're defending Weasley?" he said, low and chilled. "Someone you barely know?"
Harry could only shake his head and share a faintly exasperated glance with Hermione. It was all just a little bit of fun, but Harry was sure he wasn't the only one to notice that Ginny only persisted with her suggestiveness pertaining to Draco in Ron's company. She was filling her role as the annoyingly little sister to a T.
"Muggles are non-magical people? You mean, you have a whole community of wizards and witches, and everyone else is…? So that's what you were calling me and Jackie before."
Harry saw Jill nodding and smiling at something that Hermione was saying. Hermione smiled a moment later, nodding enthusiastically herself before jotting something down in her notebook. They were doing their project on something related to mobile phones, Harry had been told. About how the simple devices had and potentially would change society. It was interesting, even if Harry didn't find it particularly suited to his own tastes.
Words died on Harry's tongue. He hadn't even known what he was going to say, but any sense of intelligibility fled from him before Draco's cool, composed façade. It had been a while since he'd worn that before Harry. It was never completely gone – never except for that brief conversation a week before – but it hadn't been entirely complete, either. Harry almost flinched to see it reimposed.
Draco hadn't been drawn. He couldn't be, not from the very aggressive glaring match he and Potter had been sharing across the classroom. "I can hate someone and still acknowledge they're good-looking, Pansy," he'd replied without hesitation, lip curling as he did so. "Even if he has stupid hair and dresses like a fashion disaster."
Harry could still remember, as one of the only vivid memories from the past few days, the moment he'd found Sirius. Or Sirius had found him, rather. He remembered the dog, which might have been a sniffer dog, PJ, or a figment of his imagination, and he remembered his uncle grabbing him as he crumpled to his knees. He remembered Draco, his Draco, appearing as if from nowhere seconds later, the reassurance of his presence, the relief of having two of his most important people within his reach.
It wasn't cold that morning, not in the least, but Draco felt himself chilled by the lingering effects of the letter. By the weight of the finality of the interviews, too, and even by the lonely emptiness of the concrete stairwell as he wound back and forth up the flights.
"You remind me of Ginny. She looked like she was having a stroke when I told her I'd never actually left England before going to school."
"Well? What did she say?" Harry glanced briefly up at Jackie's hair, the dark green intensified with what was evidently a renewed wash. "I can't help but notice you've got a pretty obvious trend with your hair-dyeing these days. It's been green for months. Is this an answer?"
Or it was from what Harry had seen. It was certainly trained more often that evening than he'd glimpsed prior to his and Draco's slipping away to Diagon Alley. There seemed to have been some sort of exchange between them, much in the way that something had apparently happened between Jackie and Pansy given that they were sitting beside one another, too. Much as –
"There's the lunchtime cabaret," Draco reminded him. "You said you called to make a booking for that, didn't you?"
"That's not what I'm talking about," Ron said. His eyebrows climbed his forehead, eyes widening pointedly. "What was that?"
Draco's frown in return, the way he tipped his chin slightly as if in defiance, swept Harry with a wash of guilt. "Sorry," he said at the same moment Draco spoke.
As Harry fought the urge to splutter a protest, Draco squeezed his hand again. His smile was enough to stifle Harry's embarrassment almost as soon as it arose. "Oh, I know. I couldn't be more grateful."
"I know." Harry reached for his Defence textbook. In the face of a struggling capacity for practical skills, he found himself turning towards the theoretical aspects of the subject more and more often. God help him, he'd need any extra boost he could get to pass his NEWTs at the rate he was going. "It's past lunchtime, though."
