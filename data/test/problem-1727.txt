He huffed and stared at the newspaper, daring the moving images of Quidditch players to antagonize him.  If they had any sympathy whatsoever, they’d have fellated their brooms in solidarity.
Malfoy’s disdain for the elegant table settings of the Manor was palpable in his Pensieve memories.  He’d probably prefer something less formal.  Something he could decorate himself.
Looming realization made Harry pull back from Falk’s memory.  There were so many memories of Malfoy with children. In several of them, he’d looked like Arthur at a Weasley family dinner.  At ease.  And content.
Draco planted a kiss on Harry’s chin.  “I.” He kissed Harry’s lips.  “Love.”  The tip of his nose.  “You.”
He shook his head, letting Magnus’s hand hover.  “I don’t want to see you together, Mag,” he whispered, voice breaking.  “I can’t.”
Harry watches over his shoulder as Draco’s fist works lube over his length. He tries to remember to breathe as the head of Draco’s cock presses into him. He hears a murmur from Draco, and a sweep of magic slips inside Harry, followed by his own silent gratitude and a long exhale.
Rubbing the skin of her shoulders against the coarse grain felt wonderful.  Her feet drew up, sloshing water up over her hips, then scraped their way back down along the gritty rock.  She felt a certain kinship with Crookshanks and thought about buying him a new brush.
She shrugged, hiding a smile.  “It’s been a while since he needed it.  Might as well clear up the space.”
“I didn’t, actually,” Hermione replied.  “All I know about him is that he thinks I want pictures of cats.  I didn’t even know if he had stayed after the war.”
Harry nodded and tried to not focus on the other man’s trousers pulled tight across his groin.  “The plan this week involves funneling a massive
alright. Hermione comes home and this bastard just happens to show up? No. Not buying that at all. What? Malfoy, the Delivery Boy? Hell of a coincidence.”
“Just spill it, Robards.  All of it.  On the table.”  He pinned Robards' gaze, green eyes hard.  “I may or may not end up at this desk, and if I walk into a trap, I’ll drag you through the mud till after I’m dead.”
“Gotcha. Old money. I wouldn’t know.” Jensen lays on his back and fans his hair out. “My family’s all farmers, ranchers, teachers, and cops.”
“Oh, I…”  He lifted up and stopped, gauging Harry’s intent.  Draco’s eyes widened in surprise.  “Oh, Potter, you wonderful sick fuck,” he chuckled.  “I fucking love you.”
With a deep sigh, he squared his shoulders and walked through the automatic doors.  A too-chipper woman at the desk greeted him.
to the smoldering box, and escaped out of the building as it hissed and steamed, scraps of charred paper flowing out onto the lobby floor.
Something traced up his thigh to his underwear.  His skin crawled at the sudden and impersonal touch. A wand.  The firm point slid under the tight fabric, and his pants Vanished.  His cock fell free and his breath hitched.
Her hands skimmed up the insides of her thighs as she stood, coming to rest near her navel.  Turning back to him, she whispered a wandless contraception charm.
His thumbs sweep under Harry’s eyes, wiping them dry.  Harry swallows down the almost-vomited wine and chips he’d gagged up, and looks away.  His hand drops from Draco’s thick length as he tries to catch his breath without drawing attention.
A grating buzz emitted from the building, and the lock clicked open. He took another deep breath and walked in.
“Thank you, everyone who remained,” Shacklebolt grumbled, “to see this through.  For civility’s sake, we’ll be moving forward rather informally.”
those, and he whipped around to tell the man, but hesitated when the man blew his nose in a brown napkin.
“Hm.  Tempting.  I don’t have any recent dirty dreams of you.  And telling you what I dreamed of doing to you in the library when we were fifteen seems… wrong.  Very wrong.  Hex-worthy.”  He grinned, hoping to distract her.
Emboldened, he left the door frame to crawl onto the foot of the bed, all freckles and cornflower blue eyes and warm skin.  She flipped the blanket off and let him hover over her bare legs, still on all fours.
They were heavenly enough to distract him from the new case files at the far end of the table. The ones with pictures of bodies in various states of decomposition, along with examiner records and a whole slew of known and possible identities.
“And look at me while you do it,” added Ron, who was shimmying out of those damnably tight jeans again.
He still hadn’t even looked at Harry, which was unexpected.  Most people, regardless of attraction, would fall all over themselves for a look at him in nothing but a pair of Auror-red boxer briefs.
Ron sucked his lower lip and looked at Harry, who raised his eyebrows and leaned back against the couch, arms across the back, an expectant smile spreading.
Draco shoves off from the wall and speed-walks toward a doorway before Harry realizes he’s even moved.
Harry very much wanted to hug Malfoy.  He looked scared and needed hugs.  Long hugs.  Malfoy would like long hugs even more with his shirt off.
Ron smeared a fifth damn spider across his desk with today’s Prophet.  Weird, but he was too tired to make sense of it.
Harry pulled a mocking face as they turned to walk back to the lifts.  He was going to owe her for months for helping clean up the mess Ron had made with that damned car.
Draco merely shrugs and wraps long fingers around his own thick length. “You are admirably motivated, but really, it’s fine.  I don’t mind finishing myself off.”
A blurry shape appears in the doorway, and he settles his glasses back in place. The MediWitch purses her lips and takes a steadying breath. “It seems Mr. Malfoy left.”
Hermione stood to address the room from the box, and Harry heard Ron’s breath hiss in from several rows away.  “Given that Mr. Malfoy has posed a bit of a flight risk only recently,” Hermione looked to Draco for acknowledgment of her joke, but he rolled his eyes instead, “perhaps closer supervision for a shorter period of time would be warranted?  It could free up DMLE staff in the near future, as well.”
Harry plucks the bottle from Draco’s grasp and sets it on the mantle. Draco’s fingers run through Harry’s hair, and he pauses to cradle Harry’s head in his hands. “I think I missed you, Potter.”
They’d gotten lunch and shared stories, and downright bonded, despite an age gap of several decades.  She listened to them discuss raising children, and grandchildren, and laundry.  They discussed laundry an awful lot, actually.  It had felt like being surrounded by a little team of supportive grandmothers.
Codger’s tone was as acidic as that lemon he’d keistered.  “Shall we begin, then?  I anticipate this will take much longer than we had planned.”
Her faculties returned slightly, and she lifted her head to look at him.  She met his eyes over the horizon of her poorly-chosen Christmas tree-printed panties.  He’d only made seven or eight jokes about boxes and unwrapping them.
Godric, he’d seen Malfoy like that more times than he could count.  Usually at the other end of a quivering wand.  Hot guilt laced through him remembering the scars across Malfoy’s abdomen.
That smooth voice tickles against Harry’s temple.  “Whatever daft thing you do on that pitch, stick the landing.  I’ll figure the rest out.”
Draco’s head popped out, and he tossed the come-stained shirt to hit the man in the gut. He didn’t hesitate in wadding it in his hands, wet streaks and all. His ring pressed into the stained hem of the shirt.
It could end up a competition between them, given how painfully hard he was, and how much his hips wanted to grind against the mattress while he kept her on the edge of coming.
Draco released the Kneazle and sat up, Hermione mirroring him.  “The cat already knew how to use it.  I taught him to swear.  And I suspect Auror Adams is hiding something.”
Draco chants it like a summoning, a benediction, until he's coming on the tile between his feet, and his clenching arse tips Harry over the edge.
It wasn’t a huge Quintaped, he didn’t think.  There weren’t many reference materials on them.  Maybe the size of a smallish goat?  But… bloody terrifying.  If a goat had five humanoid arms for legs and a body like a fur-covered crab and a tooth-filled leech maw.
Malfoy smiled at her little outburst. “Calm before the storm, then.”   His smile zapped away as he flinched at Crookshanks clawing up onto the back of the chair and settling on his shoulder.
Draco hummed a non-answer and walked to the front of the tent. A small scorch mark sat at the seam of the flaps, and he knew he’d burned it with a cigarette at some point. His eyes flitted over the tent. A worn corner from having used it to drag a wounded Auror to safety. A bright white spot on one of the wand decals from where he’d touched it up with White-Out on a whim. A hot pink bleach stain in a corner from a sanitizing spell gone amiss. Clues.
Standing at the foot of the bed, she yanked her jacket off and threw it in a corner. Her fingers grasped the hem of her shirt, but a low hum of warning from him stopped her.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Hermione had really wanted to just be able to ask these damned men for sex when she wanted sex, and that be it. Why was it so much more difficult here than in Perth?
Grey, in and of itself, was not a bad color.  But a grey sea that never surged, and a grey sky that never roiled could drive a man mad with unfulfilled anticipation.
“You know what I mean,” Draco said, and wondered if this was a conversation better whispered or in private.
He glanced back at Harry, whose chin was still on the table.  The man was studying him like a sculptor, and it was a little flattering, really.  Much better than the wide-eyed panic that had hopefully run its course.
And then Draco steps back to watch him, expectant but timid, as if he expects Harry to give chase. Draco’s bottom lip is caught between his teeth as he waits for Harry’s response, but nothing comes out but a stammered, “I- I-”
He started with a small rocking motion to his hips while he stroked, and groaned low and needy at the pressure on his prostate.  Such a small motion, but it made tension build so quickly already.
She shook her head, curls whispering over the t-shirt on her shoulders.  His t-shirt, he noted.  He wasn’t going to have any clothes left if his lovers kept stealing them.
She’d remember if she had saved it on her laptop.  There were plenty of hidden files on this computer, but no dick pics with a thumbs up.
Ron gestured around the flat.  His stupid flat they all hated.  His impersonal quarters even he had to admit he disliked.
Far more impressive was the fucking piano next to it. Why they thought he wanted a piano, he had absolutely no idea.
“I’m heading to his place here in a bit.  Want to tag along?” Ron offered, eager to get out of the bedroom.  “I think we’re gonna blow some shit up.  But not me.  We will not blow me up.  Again.”
“The fuck…” he mumbled, blinking.  His hips bucked up into the sensation as he found his glasses and shoved them onto his face.  A fall of blonde hair blocked his view, but sweet Circe’s slit, he didn’t need eyes to revel in Draco Malfoy swallowing his cock like he was made for it.  “
Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but found she really didn’t have a comeback for that.  Parkinson wasn’t her favorite person.  Not by a long shot.  But she never could fault her for her wit.
“Time to break into my flat and pitch a tent, apparently.” Draco’s teeth scraped sticky crumbs from his palm and shifted the remaining cake to his fingertips. “What do you want?”
“Nope,” Harry said with a pop. “You grew all your fucking skin back while we watched. I don’t know what the fuck you did while you were gone, but you learned to use a
“Not to name it after me, honey,” he says, as if he’s explaining right from left to me.  A tone reserved for senile grandparents and mid-tantrum toddlers.  “But we won’t know if it’s a boy or girl till July.”
“The whole story, Dray,” Harry said gently.  “From what the two of you have told me, the Malfoys showed up to Durmstrang in ’99, you met Falk, apparently went to a few unsavory parties together, and lived a life of domestic bliss with a lot of hot sex till Narcissa and the Ministry ruined it.”
Granger squints to read a description on some toy that looks like a splinched abacus.  Her ring hangs from an unfashionably thick gold chain for a woman's necklace, but then that whole practice is garish.  Women being expected to tote around a metallic stand-in for their hymens.  I've always thought that's why they're tight little rings, not wide, jangling bracelets.  Some kind of You-Break-It-You-Buy-It gold pre-pay system.
“When they were walking to the train and talking to each other, it was in their own language.”  He adjusted his glasses and examined his mobile again.  “Included a fair bit of Parseltongue, from what I could lipread.”
Tentatively, Falk’s fingertips settled discreetly on Harry’s lower back, and he fought to keep his face neutral.  Gods, it was the same hand with the black vines twining down it.  The memory of Malfoy’s hand holding his hand, lips on his skin, made him draw a shuddering deep breath.
“It… it’s on my mobile,” she said warily. “Hang on.” She opened the app and handed him the device, knowing damn well he had know idea how to use one, but would be adept at picking it up.
He pondered the implications as he climbed the stairs to the hatchery level.  A strange scent wafted down the stairwell, stronger the higher he got.  Not a bad smell, but not the usual hot metal and lizard stink.
Its yellow beak pecked idly at small rocks, and it regarded Draco with a beady black eye.  It gave a laughing cry to the sky, where others circled.
“Done and done,” Eric announces as he returns and kneels on the blanket. “I just got a whole lot more expensive to consult. And I got more Pocky sparklers. I might even share.”
She chortled at him for a treat; a bad habit she’d picked up from the Ministry owls.  He held out a piece of fish, but she wouldn’t take it, bobbing her demand.
“I’m done proofreading the citations.  If you add any more sources, email them to me this week, and I’ll format them myself and add them in.”  Hermione clipped the words out a little harshly, but didn’t regret it.  Her throat tightened, threatening to turn her voice into a feeble squeak.
The falcon could go unnoticed. Vaguely describing a human female with large brown feathers to the smaller bird, it took off in search of her. Idly, he wondered if the falcon would run himself into any windows. He could be a real wanker. A chuffed laugh awkwardly rattled his beak.
He fought the urge to wipe his cheek, blushing as tears gathered.  The tears broke free, tracing cooling lines down his cheeks.  He sniffled as his nose ran, and he scrubbed his face with both sleeves of the sweatshirt.  “That’s the bush, then?”
Of course he’d fucked this up.  Circe’s cantankerous cunt, this was bad.  Draco was going to flay him, Heal him, and flay him again.
You shoulda been an Auror, Ron,” Harry groaned, splayed out on his living room floor.  His jeans were singed through, his glasses were shattered, his futon was still smoking, and
Eric sighs, and Harry grips the edge of the seat next to his thighs. He could invite him back to Grimmauld Place for drinks. Or coffee. Or just cut to the chase and ask him to spend the night.
There was a muted scrape as Draco slid what sounded like a wooden box out from under the bed, then slid it back.
“Get some sleep, like the healers said, and it’ll start coming back. I’ll check on you in a couple days.”
An hour later, he still sat alone at the kitchen table, but he had a respectable bundle of ferns and Queen Anne’s Lace, which meant
“Hm?”  Harry cracked an eye open, not really focusing on Draco sitting on the patio next to him.  The sun beat down into his skin, into his blood, and flowed, heavy and hot to settle in his hips.
Stifling a small grin, he wondered what Eira would do to Potter.  Possibly regale him with the sexual exploits of his predecessor.
The crystal ball and Ron’s ring had shown him the same thing.  Magnus Falk, naked and tousled, asleep in a bed with a delicate cut between his fingers.  Rather specific.  Rather enough to panic about.
“C’mere.” Ron said, patting his shoulder.  Harry had already had a horrible day, and Ron felt guilty for ripping this wound open.
Throwing some hibiscus flowers into the hot water, he grabbed a few of the older books from a culture section of one of the bookshelves, and lay down.  She was certainly taking her sweet time walking in from the wards.
Pulling the cardboard open, she dug inside and frowned. This was entirely too many small pieces for a simple table. But no, the instructions listed all 48 pieces, and it did indeed seem there were that many.
“It’s the Ministry ward, Granger.”  She flicked her wand one more time and he shook his head.  Stubborn witch.
“Right.” He leans over his paperwork on his elbows before looking across the table at Harry, the length of redwood suspended between them. “So, back to your affairs of the monetary sort. Your default heir is Teddy, as you’ve no close non-Muggle blood relation.”
The man claps Eric on the shoulder and heads back to the kitchen. Their waitress, Mary, returns, and Harry orders tacos, which seem like a safe bet, and she assures him it is. She wags a finger at Eric. “I hope you know what you’re doing. He’s back there with the ingredients he uses for family.”
But this was bad in that he couldn’t hide it.  And that made Harry Potter question his own moral compass.
coming loudly with a death grip on the mantle while his parolee was stuck with his bare ass hanging out of a fireplace.
Harry scooted forward and slid the blanket up her legs to her thighs.  She gulped and tried to ignore his slow encroachment.
“Why did you subject the Head Auror office to your bland furniture?”  Blinking rapidly, he stifled both his gratitude and a myriad of questions.   “And
Hot, rough fingers wrapped around his wrist below the cuff and slid their joined hands under the table.  Potter scooted his chair closer as thick fingers laced themselves between Draco’s.
His hands gripped her hips, and urged her forward while Harry watched her approach like she was his next meal.  She stopped in front of him, and Ron’s hands found their way under her shirt, gently stroking her waist.  He trailed small kisses up and down her exposed neck, and her nipples were painfully hard.
Harry blinks at the dispersing flecks, not sure if he’s jealous or confused. Even when he’d been able to cast spells, he’d certainly never cast a wandless
“Weasley!” Draco waved, trying to get the dust-covered ginger’s attention as he laid out another line of charms strung together by silver wire.  The things Ron had pulled out of his bag, Draco had never seen before.
Tears dripped from his chin, his nose ran rivulets, and he couldn’t speak.  Fire crept down Draco’s throat, cutting him off.  Not that anyone around him was in a listening mood.
Draco draws a slow breath and tucks his knees up onto the couch. His cheek lays on the backrest, arms wrapped over his waist. His eyelids flutter again, struggling to stay open.
Draco rolled over to watch him sleep, reaching a hand out to brush black hair off his forehead.  Two weeks ago, Harry probably wouldn’t have slept through the touch.  This morning, he actually looked rather peaceful.  Temptingly so.  Especially with the knowledge that Harry Potter generally sported an erection from dawn to waking.
The curse ward doesn’t smell like dittany. It doesn’t smell like much at all, but it sounds like hell on Earth. Muffled screams and electric crackles almost distract him from the squeak of the MediWitch’s shoes as he follows her to Draco’s room.
He chuckled, tight-lipped, mouth full of his last muffin.  “No, I mean the actual date.  But good to know.”
“You really are a magnificent little cumslut,” Draco cooed, pressing the narrow end of the egg against her entrance.
The mattress dipped, and a hot mouth latched onto the head of his cock, earning a surprised little gasp.  Draco’s fingers pulled the skin tight down his length, and Hermione’s tongue worked over the sensitive, exposed flesh.  His hips thrust forward into her mouth, sliding Draco’s cock inside him.
“Pass.” Hermione rolled her eyes.  This was not looking promising.  Maybe her only options really were her childhood best friends or Muggles.  Not promising at all.
Dazed, he turns to find a disheveled Draco Malfoy watching him, head cocked as if he’s watching a bug in a jar. Under Draco’s arm are several leather-bound ledgers. Quills peek from the back pocket of his skin-tight jeans as he bends over to pick up the errant wand.
John had only said it once, and when Harry didn’t reply, he’d never bothered again. Three weeks later, he was on leave. The next Harry heard, he’d died.
She choked back a startled sob.  Her vision blurred as tears collected against her lashes. “Damn you, Ronald Weasley.”
“I’m not sure…”  Draco sighed and nipped at the inside of his bottom lip.  “I don’t know what we are, Harry.  We were inconveniences to each other, at best, and now… this.  And I don’t know what that makes us.”
Harry yelps again, but Draco doesn’t startle. Instead, his tail slowly grazes over Harry’s cock, silky strands running the length of it, then back again. A barely-there touch, but so utterly sensual that a shaky moan rattles Harry’s chest.
He ordered his relevant memories, not eager to share his solitude in the face of Magnus’ content marriage.
She winced in sympathy.  He probably spent all day restringing and tuning his new harp. “I might have created that spell when I was fifteen.”
Shaking his head, he pulled the door open.  No, he thought.  Anyone who wanted to buy a Basilisk was exactly the kind of person who shouldn’t own one.  These little bastards were too dangerous, no matter the profit.
Harry shrugged, setting the spoon in the bowl and grabbing his phone.  “You think everything needs sugar.”  He tilted the screen and tapped out a message.  “Hermione’s going to stop by with your forms, Percy.”
Draco’s entire head was submerged in a portable DMLE Pensieve.  It was his tenth dive, and the collar of his shirt was soaked with fluid.
“Sometimes,” he said.  He rested his chin on the dry edge of the fabric.  “It was never much of a secret in Pureblood circles.”
He had great reasons to avoid Legilimency.  The last person in his head had been Voldemort.  The first person in his head had been Voldemort.  Suffice to say, those and none of the experiences in between had been pleasant, even the few that hadn’t been intrusive or painful.
Harry laid his head on his folded arm and closed his eyes. Draco did the same, a handful of cake between their chests.
“Legendary, not a myth,” Harry retorted, letting the stupid grin spread across his face.  “I know several people who’ve seen it in person.”
She opened her mouth, but nothing came out.  Because, yes, that was exactly what she’d expected to find when she came back.  He took the opportunity to lay a chaste kiss on her lower lip.
It had been more than decent, though.  Decadent.  She shifted in her seat, the beginnings of arousal drawing her attention.
For lack of anything to do, he wandered behind Harry to pretend to read over his shoulder.  Harry’s hand left the paper to raise a spoonful of oatmeal, but he froze as his phone vibrated against the table.
Watching her with a carefully blank face, he wasn’t sure if that was an insult or a compliment.  Did she think he was likely to have his way with a decidedly uninterested but currently intoxicated Potter?
“Circe’s spleen, you were out cold,” he huffed, giving her a peck on the forehead.  “I’ve riffled through your brain thoroughly.  You need to send Potter a message before you go back to sleep.”
It stung a little.  Maybe more than a little, he thought.  It felt like she was trying to pick a fight to keep him at a distance.
She turned back to the counter in search of more crumbs to dust away.  His chewing slowed, and he wondered how much she knew.  About him, and Hermione, and Harry, and Draco, and the dreams, and the children.
“Oh, God,” Harry whispers, shoulders and arse leaning into Draco. Draco’s hips press against him as he stretches Harry open. “Oh,
She set the plate down on the bed next to him.  He sat up, cross-legged, and went straight for the truffle.
“Why on earth would they do that?  Seems like a bloody useful skill.”  Harry stood under the hot water, thinking.  He wondered if his father had known how to use it.
Every once in a while, a chill slid over his eyes while Draco’s were closed.  Those moments tended to be when he’d take water.  It was something.
Pulling up his pants, Malfoy grinned.  “Ten-thousand foot altitudes and one-hundred and fifty mile an hour dives.  Roughly.”
“Really?!” Harry abandons his seat at the idle lathe and follows Draco to the door. “What’s your Ani-”
“Fine,” she huffed with a dramatic eye roll.  “But that’s way too much.  I’m saving room for dinner.”  She sat up and leaned against a small mountain of white pillows, tucking her legs up and crossing them.
Maybe my own fucking fiance will show up to our wedding. And the worst part was that nobody was surprised when you didn’t.”
She and Pansy had made it seem like she should expect rejection from him, anyhow.  Pity.  He’d always been rather good-looking when he wasn’t talking.  And she wasn’t looking for conversation.
“It’s not the taste of the wood, right?” Harry asks, pressing the pedal and drawing the boy’s attention. “It’s the way your spit tastes when you suck it back out from between the wood fibres.”
tedious.  He’s hung my suit jacket before.  He’s put my sandals in that wardrobe before.  He’s sat like this, on the foot of the bed, and laid back while I stood, feet aching, next to a pile of my own bullshit again.
The mental cadence that wouldn’t translate to pen nor harp returned, new instrument in his hands.  Harry keened a high, desperate note through his nose as Draco’s hands slicked over the head of his cock and pressed his prostate in a steady, building rhythm.
Harry cleared his throat and let Draco rest an arm on his chest.  “You were right,” Harry murmured, bringing Draco’s fingers to his lips.  “They like me.  And I like them.”
The ICW had shipped the body to the Asklepieion of Kos for a thorough autopsy, while the Ministry had a hissy fit.  Harry had no idea what the Asklepieion of Kos was, but it was evidently some kind of hot shot international Healer’s guild.
Her phone chirped on the tile next to him as he folded his arms on the white leather of the little square footstool.  It looked like a very expensive marshmallow cube, and he considered biting it.  Just a little.
.  The gods-forsaken mobile purred like an out-of-tune drunken cat, clattering constantly against the table.  Like Granger’s Kneazle with a-
He looked entirely too comfortable, Malfoy thought.  Like he had a right to be in this bed.  And he could have been.  He could have brought Potter home from the Gala, he was all but certain.  Gods, he’d looked so fucking eager.  And he didn’t look disinterested now, but he knew better.  Potter was never actually interested.
McGonagall and Dumbledore had sent messages via Patronus.  Maybe she could do the same to reach Malfoy.  The possibility of solving an impossible problem excited her to no end.  Especially if it meant preserving her dignity by not going through Luna for an introduction.
Harry grinned, checked the time, and cleared off the table.  “Sounds good to me, but I know better than to fuck off on that couch again.”
Shacklebolt cleared his throat as he stood and began stuffing papers in a bag. “Might I remind him that being apprehended leaving the UK will still earn Mr. Malfoy an extended sentence in Azkaban?”
His eyes pop open to find Draco standing at his feet, mobile between his ear and shoulder and a blunt in one hand. He slips the mobile in his pocket, and Harry pulls his gaze away from Draco’s crotch. He’s wearing white jeans and the absolute ugliest shirt Harry has ever seen; the Union Jack made entirely of sequins.
Green eyes glittered happily above him from behind the sofa.  Potter’s fingers picked at the braided trim on the backrest as he waited for Draco to process the information.
A low growl vibrated through his teeth, and she clutched the sheets, daring not to move.  Gently, he released her flesh, the flat of his tongue running over where his teeth had been.
But she was more worried what Harry would think of her for trying to contact Malfoy.  Maybe he’d become a fine upstanding citizen.  Maybe he’d come out the other end of the war reformed.  Maybe he was still an absolute twat and Death Eater, to boot.
Harry straightens up and leans his back flat against the wall whilst Draco licks the crumbs from his lips. Despite his voraciousness, he looks even more fatigued than days ago in Harry’s workshop.
He was going to have to find more funny pictures of ginger cats to send to Hermione.  She’d never once responded.  Not in nine years.  There was an excellent chance he was sending cat memes to a total stranger, but who didn’t love cat memes?
“Ah, so you’ve brought your mate a catch, then?” she asked with a grin, picking up a piece of fish and offering it to him.
She growled softly and blew a raspberry in the crease of his groin. He squirmed and nudged her away as his gaze drifted up to Harry in the doorway. Green eyes watched the scene eagerly, but his posture was stiff, hesitant.
It was an occasion for conversation, but Draco didn't remember the last one he'd had, nor did he trust his blistered tongue to perform.
He sauntered toward the kitchen, and Draco watched him, a bit self-conscious.  “I didn’t get the impression it was a joke gift,” he said softly.
Draco studies Harry’s face for just a moment with an expression Harry can’t quite interpret, then looks to Erwin as he reaches for the ring.
“We absolutely care.” Harry leaves no room for doubt in his tone. “But we care because if you’re having sex here or elsewhere, we want you to be safe and careful. And because we know that if we don’t want you to be having sex, it’s not going to somehow keep it from happening if that’s what you decide to do. Denial won’t keep the two of you safe.”
“I used to bring Scorpius here in the summers,” Draco says, almost wistfully. “He would play on the playground, and we’d eat ice cream and ride the Eye. We were just people here, not Malfoys.”
“Do you think you can get this down?” Draco’s voice is close and Harry opens an eye to find him right there. Anti-nausea potions are, on the whole, disgusting in taste, and he’s not sure he can swallow it and make it stay put. “It’s not as vile as store-bought. I brewed it myself.”
His afternoon with Draco allowed him to put off this moment, but now he has no choice but to figure out who he is now— eleven years later with all three kids off to Hogwarts. That particular bit of self-discovery will have to wait until later, however, because what he is now is hungry.
“Matthew decided he had to come out to his parents because we started having sex. He knew for sure after that there was no way he’d ever be with anyone other than a man and wanted to be able to be himself, even at home.”
Draco kisses Harry lightly before rolling to his back. He gathers Harry against him and Harry willingly stretches out against him, head on Draco’s chest.
“Good. We’re on the same page.” Draco’s voice is barely above a whisper but his words make relief spread through Harry’s gut.
Harry notices that Blaise has eased himself away as the train is pulling in and he’s grateful for that bit of privacy. This will be nerve-wracking enough without an additional audience.
takes on an unexpected form sometimes. After all, Harry Potter engaged to Draco Malfoy, deeply in love and pregnant, was completely unthinkable a year ago.
“You don’t even want to know how much Dark Magic I saw before seventeen,” Harry spits, wondering exactly how much malevolent magic might come from having a piece of a megalomaniac’s soul in your body for sixteen years, “so unless you want the Prophet running a front-page story about how Harry Potter
“Of course, Father,” says Draco. He straightens his collar and walks toward the entrance, Potter a few reluctant steps behind him.
“Yeah. Batteries. Can’t picture that many wizards running to Tesco, you know? Does Zabini sell them, too?”
At night, Harry stays close. He is Draco’s personal guard, and with the door closed he is Draco’s lover. Sometimes, as he goes about his business during the day, Draco will think about their nights together and flush all over his body. He thinks about bare skin on bare skin, about Harry’s limbs tangling with his under the blankets and Harry’s mouth moving so slow and heated across his chest, down his belly and finally around his cock. Draco thinks about the quiet, too, and the feel of Harry sleeping beside him, his body between Draco and the door. Draco’s days are full of worry and care, but his nights are full of sweetness.
“Potter—“ Malfoy stopped, still studying something only he can see in Harry’s face. He blinked, and grabbed the half-empty bottle between them. “Potter, I’m ready to get out of this bar. Let’s take the rest of this whiskey somewhere else.”
, and it didn’t feel like a surprise. Not really. Wasn’t it inevitable? Wasn’t it the natural progression down a spectrum of which he and Malfoy were the poles?
“Come in!” Draco calls, and the door bursts open, their children spilling into the room. Lily gasps the instant she spots Regulus.
. Draco steps towards him, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. His grey eyes are clouded with concern. “You’ve gone dreadfully pale. Harry, what’s the matter?” He guides Harry to a nearby bench and they sit together. The cool temperature of the hard metal seeps through Harry’s jacket and jumper, helping to quell the heat rising inside him. He finally takes a heaving breath, but he still can’t look at Draco.
His breath finally stops coming in gasps and he reaches behind himself, wincing as he eases the dildo out of his arse.
“Literally anything,” Harry smirks back. “Sometimes it’s a little shocking what they’ll talk to me about, actually.”
“It’s not dangerous in and of itself, but if there’s no connection, the baby has to be removed by using a cutting charm through skin and muscle, then moving organs to access and remove the womb and the child. It's a much higher risk to both the carrying father and the baby. In the case of canal agenesis, we begin a regime of potions to help the body prepare for the trauma at the 20-week mark.”
“You’ve done a brilliant job with him, you know? Scorpius is a great kid. I’m glad Al’s had a friend like him.”
“Minerva, I’m afraid I need to take this one home. He needs to rest. He’s had it rather rough the last couple of months.”
“At what, exactly?” Harry settles closer to Draco’s chest and laces his fingers through Draco’s hand.
“We’ll have some contractors out to take a look once everything’s public with this one.” Harry rubs his stomach lightly.
Harry opens the door as Draco is climbing the front steps. Draco’s eyes widen just a fraction in surprise, but Harry smiles.
“I can only imagine. I really am sorry, Harry.” There’s absolute anguish on Draco’s face and in his voice. “I just thought the new department sounded like something you might find fulfilling based on what you said about protection against Dark Magic.”
“I know we talked through everything related to the bedroom the other night, but I have a couple of things I want to…revisit, I guess.”
“No, Harry. It’s not that at all. I just…Salazar, yes. I’d love nothing more.” He smiles wryly. “It’s just been a long time.”
“Harry. We’re having a son. You’re carrying our son. I would love you forever even if you’d never gotten pregnant, but I can’t even put into words what this little boy means to me. He’s
their benevolent core magic — until the antidote is administered.” Draco beams proudly. “It should allow the Curse-Breakers to counteract the malevolent magic with no damage to the core.”
“I’m so glad.” Harry is flooded with relief, knowing exactly what Al’s cryptic bit of communication means. They’ll talk about it more at home, of course. He passes them both to Draco, who wraps his arms around both boys.
“I don’t think we can wait until the Easter hols. Someone’s growing too fast.” Harry lays his hand on top of Draco’s. “I suppose we could ask Minerva to allow them home for a weekend.”
“Pack what you need to stay, Draco.” Harry wasn’t planning on having this conversation now, but he’s also not anxious about it. He knows what he wants. “I know we still have everything to work through with the kids, but I want you here. We can worry about the details and logistics after the kids know. But for now, I just…I want you to stay. Every night. For as long as you want to.”
Harry’s interest is piqued. He really did enjoy being an Auror and learning how to defend against and circumvent Dark Magic. “Go on.”
The younger three children join Harry and Draco in the living room, where Harry knows he must attempt to explain what’s happened with Matthew to three children who have never known there is something a child could do to “deserve” the rejection of their parents. This is, by far, one of the most challenging parenting moments he’s ever had.
“Oh really? Who are you making all these plans with instead of making some with me?” she asks teasingly. Acutely uncomfortable, Harry braces himself to tell her, kindly, that he’s not interested in making plans with her any time soon.
Draco lifts his head and looks at Harry askance. “Potter. We’re in bed, in only our pants. Why are you talking about your children?”
“You’re right. I’m not. The look on your face was totally worth it.” Harry runs his hand through Draco’s hair. “And I might be persuaded to give up the Snitch for a kiss.”
“Why don’t you go and get your things, love? We can settle our stuff in together. Do you want me to come with you?”
Harry laughs and leans heavily on Draco, who helps heave his burgeoning body to an upright position. “Very well. I’ll text her.”
“Astoria and I had an arranged marriage for the purpose of supplying me with an heir,” Malfoy states with a very matter-of-fact tone. “She had no desire to be a mother. She fulfilled her obligation and when Scorpius was six months old, she weaned him and signed away parental rights. She was given a substantial alimony payment upon our divorce and left the country shortly after.” Malfoy’s features soften slightly. “I believe she still lives in France.”
If he were to be honest, the only routines in his life were seeing Eira at the library and fishing. Granger had apparently kept, had shipped, and alphabetized her textbooks from 2005 by the last name of the lead author. Which meant she had the lead authors’ names memorized. Terrifying.
Draco’s hips pressed up against him, struggling to escape, then lingering in interest.  Harry’s snorts dissolved into kisses and soft nips as he let his weight sink Draco against the mattress.  Draco’s fingers skimmed through Harry’s hair, holding him close.
Draco wasn’t wrong, Harry thought.  The idea of Draco’s bare cock inside him tomorrow evening felt like something he kind of wanted, but mostly
He spins the potato around like a lumpy clock hand while Harry chops onions. Draco leans his elbows on the counter, sagging as he watches the knife. Harry slides the onions into the pan to sizzle with the potato, and when he turns around, Draco greets him with a jaw-unhinging yawn.
Draco’s fingers rested on the back of the futon, Harry’s hips temptingly between them, all but offering himself up to roving hands.  Harry’s breath shuddered in, and one of his hands drifted down to slide into Draco’s hair.  He sighed and leaned into the touch, letting his eyes drift shut.
The fox huffs and pulls his lips back to show his teeth, but his body leans into Harry’s hand as he strokes. Harry yawns and nuzzles into Draco’s scruff. His lips press against Draco’s fur, and he sighs, drawing in the smell of bitter cold snow and ice.
Hermione and Ron gaped, slowly turning to each other.  Harry leaned against the window frame, watching the winged silhouette disappear between buildings.
Harry nodded him over to the side of the group, out of earshot.  “I didn’t warn him before I Apparated.  I just grabbed him and popped out,” Harry lied.  “He’s not dressed, and probably terrified.  Tell him I’m sorry?”
He pulls his feet out from under Harry and surges forward to straddle Harry’s lap. His stocking-clad thighs spread over Harry’s legs, and he’s a pale, angular menace in the moonlight, but Harry’s hands slide up the fishnet, just like his eyes did, destined for the satin between Draco’s legs.
The pink returns to Draco’s cheeks, and his gaze is intent on the floor between them. “If,” Draco says slowly, “you wanted to get dinner. Or see a film. Or both?”
Harry Potter was proving to be more adventurous with his ass in the heat of the moment than he let on.  According to Hermione, he’d never invited her to explore it.
“I do,” Draco breathes. He relaxes down into his seat, and Harry sighs and settles in next to him as the lights go down. A forearm slides over Harry’s on the armrest, and fingers lace between his. Draco pulls their interlocked knuckles up to his lips, planting featherlight kisses along Harry’s fingers.
Maybe Draco told everyone he slept with that he loved them.  Maybe he’d said it so easily because he didn’t actually
My trousers are cold as I pull them on and the thin cotton sticks to the come running down my thighs.  His zipper echoes down the vacant hall.  The empty rucksack is crumpled in his fist, no attempt to hide it from the guards on his way out.  Why bother?  They can’t touch him.  Few in this world can.
rings over.  Harry and Draco had been so damned happy.  They were too good together to be apart, but Harry didn’t seem to quite grasp that, obtuse twit that he was.
are you doing?” Malfoy hissed.  “Don’t auction yourself off to these people.   You’ve seen what they are.”
“You have vices, at best,” Ron said conclusively.  “I’ve got like, one thing to take care of on the way out, then you wanna blow bedrock up at the Burrow?”
Either the fire was exceedingly hot, or he was on the verge of panicking.  Exhaling slowly, he picked up the tea.  What did she want from him?  An apology for what Narcissa had done?  An excuse?
He nodded again and closed his eyes briefly before she felt the familiar coldness skitter across an eye, and a messy wad of glowing white drifted into her mind’s vision.
Harry wondered if he should have brought more Aurors.  But for what?  He tried to remind himself why he was here as he took his glasses off and dried them on his rapidly dampening sweatshirt.  Streaky instead of wet. Not much of an improvement.
Her finger slid out and re-approached his entrance with a second one, slicking it along his crack.  They pressed against him, waiting for permission as he relaxed his muscles and accepted her welcome intrusion.
rose bush, he realized with a start.  The silver rose bush.  Liore’s bush.  He swallowed past a lump in his throat and opened the door and stepped out.
She rewound the memory to look at the children again.  The girl’s dark curls and sweeping brows reminded her of Harry.  And the boy’s hair looked like Ginny’s thick auburn locks.  The children between them didn’t have defined faces, or features.  Odd.  Very odd.
His gut sank at the shared realization.  He really didn’t want to leave.  But he really shouldn’t stay.
His shoulders relax back against the wall, and his hands slide through Draco’s hair. Draco chuckles, despite having a mouth full of dick, and grabs Harry’s wrists. He pins them against the wall, and Harry’s entire body runs hot at the sensation of being restrained.
His breath flutters in as his hold on me loosens.  Through unfocused eyes, I watch him lick my release off his fingers, and I suppress a loopy giggle.
Slowly, he rested his chin on her bare knee, and she melted.  Her hands found his hair and ran through it, relishing the thick silky texture. His head dipped to lay a chaste kiss on top of her thigh, his soft beard tickling her skin. Eyes drifting up to hers, quietly asking, calmly waiting, he grazed another kiss a few inches higher.
She’d suspected for a long time that he played dumb because he was thinking something through and didn’t want to be bothered.  It seemed she may have been correct.
A soft moan slipped from Draco’s lips, and his fingers slid in his mouth. He sucked them eagerly, and Harry’s cock throbbed in response.
Ron surveyed the now-visible trail leading up to a rock outcropping.  “How far do the wards extend?”
And “lost”? Dead? A fellow Auror missing in the line of duty? Or simply lost to him? Lost in some poetic sense? Misplaced him on the tube? Left him in an umbrella stand in an inn?
to hurtle forward and reassure Harry with his lips.  And then his hands.  And then the rest of his body.  And that’s why Harry had told him to keep a foot on the floor.  Bit embarrassing to be preemptively reined in by Potter, but he wasn’t wrong.
Medea’s mons, his dream had led him to a fucking crystal ball.  Or would be, once it was shined up, which Ron was already doing.  “I’m not sure.  But leave it in the wall.  I don’t think it’s supposed to come out.”
Draco turned away from the grimy cabinets and dusty sink. A bright red robe hung on the back of the door, and he huffed out an interested breath.
greeted her as she landed in the Wheal Elvan fireplace.  Eventually, she was going to ask Ron what it meant.  Probably toilet humor, knowing him.
“I didn’t come here for a bloody hand job,” Draco drawls as he tugs his jeans down to his knees and turns. “Fuck me.”
He wedges himself into a corner to watch the room whilst remaining visible. A Muggle tuxedo wasn’t necessarily the most comfortable option, but it has more pockets than formal robes. And, frankly, it makes his arse look fantastic. If he’s going to have his rear in the Prophet, it might as well look good. With any luck, the handful of reporters sifting through the room will be content with a picture of him and not press for an interview.
A rectangle of sunlight tumbled from a stack of manila folders onto the table, a corner of it beaming into a small orange jar. The jar glowed like a fire opal; a sugary sunset of color.
“Oh,” he murmured.  He stepped down next to her, arms running with goosebumps at the sudden chill.  “The stone would be beautiful covered in silver roses.”
Harry wiggled his feet into shoes, not bothering with socks.  Taking Draco along was a terrible idea.  Especially all shagged-out and loopy.  He’d end up either falling asleep or going at it with Hermione.
Touching down in a cluster of pines, he shifted, and was startled by an irritating jingle from an ice cream truck not far behind him. She appeared to be asleep, book in hand.
“Ah, that explains it,” Ron said with a nod.  “But this little Harpy slept too late to use her talented mouth for anything but a goodbye kiss.”
The waves rolled down through his cock as he came into her waiting, eager mouth.  He tried to muffle his moans in the leather, but Pansy pulled him up by his hair.
His hands pressed the damp soil down, hands around the base.  A thorn scraped across his tattooed pinkie, and he drew back to look at the bleeding scratch.
Draco squinted, trying to see through the fogged shower door into the hall. He could have shut the bathroom door and locked it. He should have. A shadow crept down the hall, and it was too late to lock the door.
“Granger,” he said with a sigh. “Every time I convince myself I like you for your tits and ass, you go and so something like that, and I just want to lick your brain till you come.”
Someday, he was going to have to ask Robards how to train owls.  Draco had sent Matilda with him, and he’d been able to train her to deliver messages.  Whether that was a fitting life for the magnificent bird remained his own internal struggle, but she seemed happy enough.
Harry’s cock and Draco seemed to have a similar routine.  Rise at dawn, wait for Harry to wake up, engage in
“Fuck, Harry!”  Her shout was muffled by the mattress, hips still moving in small circles, rubbing her clit against her fingers, each pass causing another wave, another tightening.  Her hips gradually slowed, and she pulled her hands up out of her knickers.
Maybe younger owls would have been a better idea, but he’d chosen experience over speed. And speed, this couple did not have. They had been circling the south end of Cardiff for over an hour.
Another sharp jab from Ron lands just below his deltoid, driving straight to the bone, and he gasps silently and resolves to leave soon.
Harry’s fingertips dig into the thick fur over the fox’s shoulders. Draco lays his ear down over Harry’s heart and draws a deep breath.
“Thank you,” she said, surprised by the apology. “And you were right. I… it was overkill. And unintentionally misleading. And I’m sorry.”
“I feel like I’m on a first date.”  Harry twisted his ring around his finger, as if it were new.  His whole body itched to run or fight or simply
Harry thought hard, distracted by the subtle stroking of Falk’s thumb.  “Just put it in as a caption and see what happens.  I don’t want it to be a reason anybody buys it.  Just a bonus.”
Awkwardly, he noticed her staring at him. “Uhm, lots of assembly involved in running the store. Old hat.”
And he knows it.  He knows I’ll be waiting: hard, ready, burned out from the inside before he even sees me.
.” Draco stood and offered her a hand up out of their wreckage. “But if you can read someone’s thoughts as well as give them your own, you can sort of… cultivate them.” He dropped her hand as she stood. “It can be done with exceptional skill and care, and it can be done with unprecedented ruthlessness.”
“I think you can’t have, like, any Muggle ancestors.  And it’s complicated as shit.  I remember Dad saying it was equivalent to learning a language, an instrument, and a dance, and performing all three in perfect synchrony.”
“Didn’t think you’d object.” The man reached down to cup himself while his eyes roved down Draco’s body.
Harry echoed his calming exhale.  He could do this.  “I want to fuck you, Dray,” he whispered, glancing up at Draco’s surprised expression.  “I mean, I want you to fuck me.  I mean, fuck.”
“The two of them have been discussing you for a rather long time, Mr. Malfoy,” she chirped back.  There was a faint sarcastic tilt to the way she said his name.
It takes him a moment to realize he isn’t actually in a small library, because Draco’s office walls are bookcases. The walls do not contain bookcases. They
He rocked forward, feeling the plug press deep behind the root of him, and wiggled slightly.  Gods, it would be good for coming, but was beyond annoying to sit with.
Maybe Ron or Harry would be interested, but she doubted it.  Even if they were interested, she wasn’t sure
Silence lingered, and Harry got the impression he was expected to contribute to this conversation.  “Ron planted an orchard at the Burrow that I guess does pretty well.”
Her shoulders wiggled happily at the mention of jam, and she rolled off the bed, leaving a trail of crumbs behind her.  Harry watched Draco watch her walk away, and echoed his content sigh.
you didn’t!  You said yourself you invented one, and you don’t even notice when a woman forgets it?!  Bloody likely.”
“It’s a bloody owl,” Ron said derisively.  It amused him that a Death Eater would be terrified of a bird with a note on it.
“No.”  Harry said definitively.  If Malfoy wasn’t going to touch him, then by Godric, he was going to do it himself.  Nearly the whole room was naked and in various states of open shenanigans.  Why should he have to hold himself to Malfoy’s standards?
“Nary a word.  You?”  Leaning down, he slid all but one book into the leather sling bag.  She shook her head.
“Harry’s apartment with the private Floo and the big bed and nobody home…”  Ron said, tugging a shirt on.
“Hermione said she bought two different kinds.” He tilted his chin and raised his head to nip at Draco’s lower lip. “And she’s bringing sheet music later.” His hands slid down Draco’s trousers, hands kneading his backside through the generous covering of skin-tight boxer briefs.
“Yeah, what?” Draco asked tentatively, studiously not wiping his sweaty palms on his trousers yet again.
“Granger,” he said more firmly, watching her eyelids flutter and her chest expand with a sigh. “You rang?”
“My house down.” Harry pats Draco’s back, two quick taps to get his attention. “My house that’s full of lumber. And very flammable chemicals.”
His directionless survivor’s guilt that had only recently faded?  His lingering sexual hesitancies?  His insecurities about having children?  His terror about himself as a father?
And if the damage was already done… no point in sleeping on top of that duvet tonight.  A soft hum fell from him as pale skin and deft fingers exploring his body consumed his imagination.
With a harrumph and toss of her hair, she slid from between him and the sink to walk casually back to the bed.  He watched her sashay intentionally and shook his head, smiling.
This was… different.  This felt… foundational.  Like they were finding new footing together.  Blasting down to bedrock.  Something that was a home, and a family, and maybe more.
Salazar’s fucking sphincter, to be approaching thirty years old, one of the most powerful public figures in wizarding Europe, to have
“They take after you quite a bit, you know. The youngest two,” he murmured as he slid her thighs up over his, lips inching toward her ear.
Draco blinked rapidly, adjusting to the light as the woman’s eyes flicked up and down his form.  A reserved, contralto voice raised goosebumps down his arms, despite the warming charm.
Lucius flinched and ran a hand down his face, and the men exchanged concerned looks as they each worried if conversation was going
Sometimes it was random jolts.  Sometimes it was a highly codified signal system of behavior modification.  It was a fun game of “See how we still own you.”  An entire language spoken in syllables of pain.
“We are . . ." Malfoy’s eyes follow the multi-colored lights traveling over the wall above the mirrors. “Celebrating.”
.  Talked to the point of near-breathlessness about his career plans.  DMLE plans.  Ministry plans.  Hell, plans that would ripple through the global magical community.
“Besides,” Draco says wryly, “you’ve already seen me naked.” A slick tongue trails up Harry’s thumb, and Draco nips at his fingertip. “Twice.”
Of all the dreams Draco had shared, that one was probably her favorite, but perhaps just because it was at Hogwarts.  Or perhaps because of Draco’s patient, firm handling of the situation.  Downright judicial.
“Well, which is it?  Yes or no?” Harry asked, rummaging through a drawer for Merlin knew what.  Definitely not a comb.
Harry blinked and took a deep, shaky breath as his hand milked the last few drops onto the garish red length in front of him.  Draco growled softly around his thumb, and he tightened his grip on the other man’s jaw.  It earned him an indignant huff.
Harry closes the chart with shaky hands and slides it back in the slot with a thunk. He sniffs and flips his glasses on top of his head to wipe his eyes. They burn more the harder he rubs them, but it's a distraction from the ache in his chest and the echoing burn on his arm.
His eyes slid shut, and Harry was grateful for the solitude as tears gathered against his lashes.  It was true.  He’d never been kissed like that.  Slowly.  Deliberately.  Tenderly.
Ron kicked a dead blasting cap toward the nearest… well, not a pit anymore.  The somewhat stately frame of Percy’s soon-to-be cottage.  Once the floorboards were in place, it would look more like a house.  A very nice house, if anyone asked him.  And they might.
Huh, Harry thought.  They would have only been, what, twenty years old at the time?  He’d still been an Auror trainee, and two of the biggest wizarding schools were having a bidding war over Draco Malfoy?  He was surprised he hadn’t heard a thing about it.
“You said that last time, Harry,” she said with a self-satisfied smirk as she used both hands to lay the hair of his lower abdomen smooth.
with him, and he’d told him to fuck off so many times.  And he’d otherwise liked Ernie.  Maybe really, really liked him.  Fuck.
The gum is entirely too hard to be considered chewing gum, but it might make for amazing bubblegum.  The flavor’s nothing to brag about.  Spearmint and something floral.
He rolled his eyes so hard his whole head rotated.  “Might turn my pubes red.  I may never recover from the shock.”
home.  They made a place feel like home. He hadn’t anything similar felt in nearly a decade.  Not since he had a common room and a prefect, but even then, it hadn’t been a true home.
Draco blinked up at the freshly-minted Head Auror, resplendent in gold and crimson.  A Christmas gift to all of wizardkind.
His tongue darted out to wet his lips, and he tasted the tangerine lip balm they’d practically forced on him. His vision swam behind his eyelids; a bright-dark amethyst and midnight fractal that muted when a wispy cloud dared to dampen the sun’s rays.
Soft moans from Hermione drifted down the entrance to the spring, and he grinned.  That didn’t sound like hair being braided.  Not yet, anyway.
“It’s…” Odbert’s voice faltered, and Ron suspected the man was crying.  “It’s so pure we’ve fought territorial wars over single Runespoor nesting sites.”
Harry snuffs his words out again, tugging Draco forward by his belt loops, pulling their bodies flush. Draco sighs as he eases into Harry. Draco’s hands grip the edge of the counter as he pins Harry against it, lips languid and bodies pressed tight.
“This is why I can’t have nice things,” Malfoy chided, looking down at the broken fragments.  “Ministry thugs show up and break everything.  They even set an intern on my dishes.  I’m honestly down to a single bowl now.”
Draco stirred, mumbling in his sleep, and Harry tucked an arm around his waist and settled in for a snooze.
“Gods, Harry,” he sighed.  “Fuck.  Just- I’m not proud of any of it.  Please, just-  Just keep that in mind?”  He swallowed thickly and looked up, slate eyes brimming with unshed tears.  “This is not a fairy tale,
Steam wafted from a mug at the near end of the dining table, and Harry wondered how he’d managed to make tea without hitting the tether.  Probably some well-done wandless
“Oh.  Right.  Yeah,”  Harry muttered.  “But we’ll have to Apparate in.  One of us doesn’t have wings.”
Draco’s face was still half-hidden in the sweatshirt, and Harry grinned.  He didn’t look like he was going to willingly breathe air that wasn’t Potter-scented for a while.
Harry smoothed out the creases in the pink paper with a thumbnail.  Was he supposed to let the Unspeakable know when they needed Malfoy back?
Harry turns to speak to Draco, but is met with the top of his head, not his face. His hair tickles Harry’s nose, and it smells like bitter-cold snow, as he leans closer. Several cameras snap this time, and he nudges Draco.
Harry stepped up to the shrouded cot and took a deep breath.  It wasn’t that he was squeamish around the dead.  Not really.  But he was certainly wary of Narcissa Malfoy, even after declared dead.
His body tensed, both in pleasure and in surprise, panting through his nose.  She was going to milk his climax from him with just that, he thought.  Not a dignified finish.
Harry palms the smooth skin, kneading the muscle. His thumbs fit in those dimples as he spreads Draco open. Dimples like runway lights; welcome home and happy travels.
The slick heat of her mouth slid down his length as she filled his ass.  He came with sudden groan, spilling into her mouth.
“The International Confederation of Wizards is in attendance and would like to be recorded as such,” she said with a nod to a woman with a press pass.
“I want to see!” Draco mewled, craning his neck.  A firm grip on the waistband of his pajama bottoms pulled him back.  Potter should just come through with him, he thought.
Potter’s entire torso was smeared in it.  The rest of him was coated in gray rock dust.  It turned his black hair ashen, and smeared his glasses.
He turned and looked back up, expecting some kind of rejection, but Draco simply hummed and nodded softly.  “I thought that, too.  I was sure I’d hex a student for chewing gum or something silly.”  His lips pulled under as he thought.  “It is disorienting,
One of her hands wandered down to cup him, the other supported her weight, she set her mouth on the head of his cock again.
He patted her on the ass and she rolled over.  A lazy, content smile graced her face, but her brows were knit in mock offense.  “You skipped a contraception charm on the word of a Death Eater,
“Nah,” Ron said, and he plunged his fingers into her knickers straight between her slick folds.  Waves of pleasure coursed through her, and a helpless moan escaped her throat.  She sagged in his arms, hips moving in time with the stroke of his fingers.
The man nodded, tight short jerks of his chin before suddenly finding the windows behind Draco very interesting.
Draco brings one long finger up to wipe his left eye clean. He takes his time, then scrapes pulverized potato from his right eye.
“Granger,” he huffed, “I haven’t been allowed off this fucking island in four years.  They admit one student a year.  That ship sailed while I was still in Azkaban.”
Instead, she swept the shreds into a pile, gingerly stepped in the middle of it, and nestled herself in with a wiggle.
“I’m an experienced wallower, I suppose.”  He sighed and laid his hand over hers.  “And you’ve spent too much time alone,
He smelled chocolate and slowly opened one eye. Her face was inches from his. He opened his mouth and accepted the damn truffle with a pout.  The urge to toss his head back and swallow it whole was quickly stifled as he bit down on the glossy confection.
Dinner was what his invitation had said, but he’d slept for a day and a half instead of preparing anything.  Rounding the corner, he sighed, seeing the baskets Weasley had brought in.  At least there was food.
The fans of the English teams wanted the Ministry to capitulate to the ICW’s demands, get the sanctions removed, and reunite the teams.  The fans of the new Scots-Irish League teams were rather alright with the new arrangement, and many of them had sided with the Malfoys today.
His head swam with visions of finding her dying on a rocky beach, mashed together with memories of her screaming, writhing, bloody on the Manor floor. He shook his head and looked for the owls. Their circling had become a descent spiral, and a shred of hope loosened the tightness in his throat.
Harry lifted his head and practically glared at him, finally gathering some semblance of true consciousness.  “
His balance was off, and he shifted his knees wider, but it didn’t help.  Maybe if he got up on his feet instead of his knees, he could-
He felt her knees settle between his feet as her fingers changed position, and he tilted his hips up.  Her fingers froze, and he cracked an eye to look at her.
Her eyes fluttered open, after far longer than he’d expected.  He shut his eyes, expecting her to sit up and either mock or berate him.  Would she call him a pervert or something just generally emasculating?
Draco unfolded the paper and scanned it with wide eyes.  Potter watched him read, glee writ across his face like a proper loon.
Draco’s words slid through the cracked door, lodged themselves uncomfortably in Harry’s throat, melted, trickled down, and pooled in his groin.
But would Harry wake up in this bed tomorrow morning?  How long would he stay once he didn’t need to?  How many hours until Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were free?  Free
“John Pitchlynn.  ICW.  American Mugwump,” he said, piercing black eyes analyzing Ron uncomfortably.  The man leaned forward to shake Ron’s hand, and at least had the good graces to not pull a face at his clammy palm.
“Just that.  Every time an owl is sent to him, from anywhere, it disappears.”  The man blinked up at her.  She had half a mind to ask him if
Draco flops down along Harry’s side, and his head nestles in on Harry’s shoulder. Harry isn’t sure where to put the arm that lays along Draco’s back, but ignoring it feels even more conspicuous. Draco murmurs something softly, but Harry can’t hear him.
With a pop, Falk Apparated right the fuck off the bench in a Muggle park in the middle of the day.  Harry supposed Falk could tell with fair certainty that no one had been looking.  But still.  Ballsy.
“Why did you come here, Hermione?” he said gently, but she could hear the annoyance under his concern.  “You were in bed between men who would have done anything for you.”
She divested him of his boxers and licked her lips as his cock slapped against his belly.  “I want to at least hear you come.  Then I really do have to leave.”
“Betrothals?  In school?  Why was I so out of the loop?”  She sat up, worked into a solid huff.  “And why the hell would you and Ernie not be the talk of the Great Hall?”
.  I think I’d make you watch me eat it very, very slowly.  And then make you listen to me have no less than… I think… three orgasms in your bed while you sit in this chair.  Unsatisfied.”
Malfoy dumped the contents of the glasses together and shoved the cup at Harry none too politely.  Harry took it grudgingly, eyeing the box and envelope.  It looked like a small bakery box.
Leaning in to kiss his chin, she let go of his cock to grab the headboard behind his shoulders.   His eyes opened as she rose up on her knees over his cock.
An accordion pile of folded t-shirts teases me, like two decks of cards shuffled together; inseparable.  Where do I start and he begins?  Where does he start, and is this where I end?  Outercourse oroborus.
Ron felt like he was giving a Wizard Studies lecture, if such a class had existed.  And now he wondered if maybe it should.  It would have made more sense than making Harry and Hermione take Muggle Studies.
Luna beckoned, trotting up the dusty trail.  He smiled at the greeting.  Of anyone, she’d seen his Animagus form more than anyone.
She shrugged and wiggled her fingers inside him distractingly.  “It was an accurate mental image you had,” she said conspiratorially.  “He does keep his glasses on.  But he tends to drop down to his elbows.  Better grip.  He’s a bit aggressive like that.”
Harry reaches for a small tin of resin and tries to ignore Draco’s lips nipping the skin along his neck. The resin is tacky as he dabs it on top of the knots, and he frowns at the sticky situation. A sprinkle of sawdust is enough to keep the knots from adhering themselves to anything, and Harry surveys his handiwork.
“No,” Falk stated, “it’s not my place.  But you can get in touch with me if need be about the logistics of it all.”  He paused, turning to descend back to the field.  “
The only splash of color was the utterly delectable sight of him reclined on the white bedspread, wearing nothing but those tiny orange shorts.  The curve of his cock was visible through the tight material, and she was dying to touch him.
The door closes softly as his last customer leaves. Whether or not the man’s new acacia and copper wire wand will work is a bit of a mystery. But then a pioneering magical electrician was accustomed to trial and error. Pioneers in wand manufacturing certainly are, he thinks, as he catches a whiff of chemicals from his project in the utility closet.
He frowned at her overly familiar use of his name.  Disinterested, he watched her work on him with some tiny spelled comb.  She was fairly attractive, really.  Bobbed blonde hair, clear blue eyes.  Pity she held all the appeal of Baba Yaga.
A white tail flicks above a cluster of squat succulents; their round, fleshy petals gleaming in the moonlight. Harry lowers himself to his knees and crawls, silent and grinning, to hide behind an enormous, glossy pot. His hair brushes against the lowest branch of the tree, and it tugs gently at the strands as they sift over the scale-like needles.
“Oh!  Ron!”  His mum came round the corner.  “Didn’t know you’d be home for lunch, love.  Sit down, I’ll fix you a plate.  Even if you do smell something awful.  Dark Farts again?”
A droplet gathered in his navel, tipped forward, and trailed down a fine, wispy line of blond hair.  Her eyes followed the single bead as it edged down, gathered, speed, and raced down the length of his cock.  The glistening drop beckoned her to catch it before it fell onto the sheets.
Liore was real.  She wasn’t one of Narcissa’s delusions or Lucius’ lies.  She’d been real.  Was real.
Draco’s lips quirk up on one side as he tucks the ledgers under his arm and takes a step toward the door. “Yes. And a rather fetching tail.”
But, as with any other privacy spells or charms, a simple Muffliato was not allowed.  No, no privacy permitted during “DMLE custody”.  All the intrusion of Azkaban, but none of the thrilling random acts of violence.  Not that he hadn’t been tempted to shove his Auror about a bit.
Ron laughed and clapped his hand on Harry’s thigh.  “Lovers play-fighting, Harry.  How the hell did you think they ended up in the wrong ties that morning?”
Draco scowled at the legs sticking out of his fireplace.  He took an over-confident gulp of coffee and his eyes fluttered shut in poised masochism as it burned all the way down to his collarbones.  With a pout on its way to a full snit, he collapsed his head onto his folded arms atop the table.
“Okay,” Draco murmured, and rolled onto his side, face buried against Molly as her hands ran through his hair.
.” He growled, cursing the damnable skirt, head falling back against the chair.  The skin of his chest ran hot, flush chasing up to his cheeks.
for something innocent.  That particular one was for messing up a song on a harp when he was fourteen.
Inside the basket, there were banal items one woman would send another if she didn’t know her well.   Scented lotion, a bundle of wilting daffodils, a bottle of Muggle hair oil, a pair of thick, knitted woolen socks, and on top… a half-eaten muffin.
Falk looked away, relaxing a touch as he did.  Sensing an opportunity, Harry pursued the change in topic.  Thus far, he only had Weasley opinions, which were heavily biased in his favor.
“They’re related?!” Harry barked, his voice echoing around the spring. Water sloshed as he made his way to the ladder to look up at Draco in astonishment. “That actually kind of makes sense.”
, but not before declaring that he intended to piss away an unholy amount of galleons on new boots and a sword.  And that the main actress was doing a good job of portraying an unsexy Granger.
He was a little disappointed in himself that he’d literally rather walk in on Malfoy fucking Hermione than simply be alone with the man, but… baby steps.
Harry takes a long breath and lets his fingers glide down the overlapping needles. “The branches are so much thinner than I imagined.”
Sighing impatiently, he caught a whiff of teakwood.  Harry looked up, expecting to see a tall black silhouette next to the table, but no one was there.  In fact, Malfoy was still across the room, now talking to a different Goblin.  The naked one appeared to be wandering off to join a group of other nude Goblins around the smelting fountain.
“And I quote, ‘Harry.  I’m assembling a personal army of the best wizard cocks in the UK, and I want you on the team.  Please submit application.’”
Ron did as told, wiping the knife on the rug, then burning it clean.  Nothing happened to his part of the rug, but flowers shifted, green tendrils crept out to form a new layer of the vine.
Maybe Wheezes would be selling pocket-sized crystal balls this year.  On chains, as necklaces.  A whole jewelry line?  Crystal ball betrothal jewelry would sell itself.  He ripped off a corner of blank sketchbook page and found a Muggle ink pen on the counter to jot the idea down.
Chortling and bobbing enthusiastically, she held out a leg.  Unsure of what she wanted, he offered a finger.  Surely she hadn’t learned to shake hands.  Her talons wrapped around his finger, but she made no move to let go or shift her weight from his arm.  She just watched him out of one eye, expectantly.
Preventatively, Harry cast a noise dampening spell and checked his office door was locked.  Just in case.
He bit his lip and tried to edge his hard cock away from the friction of her movements.  If she kept making sounds like that, he’d be the first one coming.
Falk’s tone was downright insolent, and Harry was starting to get angry.  Ron’s screed came rushing back to him.
Ron’s other deliveries were much less unnerving, he thought, running fingertips along the glossy table.  Simply-designed, sturdy, and enormous.  It was utterly perfect, and he sighed deeply.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Harry sighed.  Maybe the Goblins didn’t speak secret wizard tie language, either.  He went to work loosening the knot and slipped the tie over his head.
“That’s the last of them,” he said, straightening slowly.  “The ink and glazes are in the small box with instructions.”
Harry shook his head and frowned.  Wrong time and place to be thinking about Draco’s exes.  Not while he was setting up a rather risky gift all along Draco’s table.  Fuck.  Draco loved this table, and Harry was going to do
But if it’s a boy, I’ll teach him how to be a proper coward, so that he can say that the number of times he’s hit a woman is nothing compared to the number of times he's let a woman hit him.  His
A plume of hot air and dust shot over top the red velvet upholstery, and he shuddered.  It felt a little too like dragon breath.
“I don’t want to go back,” he whispered.  Knowing it was futile to argue with her, he put the lid back on the box with its three remaining truffles.  They might be more appetizing later.
“Huh,” he repeated, an improbable giddiness rising.  “I… I accept your offer.  I’ll blast out a hearth.  No, wait.  Send Ron over with the rug and a knife,
Harry wrapped a hand around his length and started pumping.  He was already leaking clear fluid onto the paper held in his other hand.  A groan escaped him as he watched Falk’s fingers disappear into Malfoy.
Godric’s gonads, he should probably either go back to bed or loudly clear his throat.  Either or.  His cock was apparently voting to stay and watch, but he had no intention of releasing it for the show.
“When the movie’s over.”  Harry stood and grabbed his jacket off the floor, checking for his keys.  “I’m going to see if I can buy a cooler down the block.”
“Did my parents do something in particular to warrant an all-female guard?” he asked, voice firm, but with an appropriate hint of groveling.
The glossy books slid out of the bags with a crinkle, and she handed them off. He drew silver reading glasses from his pocket as he shuffled through them, examining titles. Finding harp transcriptions had been a surprising pain in the rear, but maybe it was worth it.
She wished he’d have been that bold.  Merlin, she regretted slapping him.  If she’d have been forthright with her invitation, and they’d skipped straight to sex, they never would have had a blow-up in the park.
It was the storming fury that rose every time he remembered how many times he’d wanted to crawl back into a spider-infested cupboard and never come out.  And how much he
The pattern wouldn’t leave Draco alone.  It happened sometimes, like this.  A cadence that wouldn’t leave the cerebellum.  A subtle, specific momentum that sought release from his body.
The crumbling muffin burned like a comet against his hip.  He was desperate to be rid of it, and he would be soon enough.  He’d know those muffins anywhere.
Her hips settled against Draco’s and he slid his hands up to her waist, then her shoulder blades.  She was supposed to lay back, but the hard length inside her was immobilizing.  In a good way.  Her fingers snuck down to her clit, not surprised to find her slit wet already.
Silver glints next to the pillow, and I bend down and grab it.  He keeps a hold of my hips, still sheathed inside me.  It slips in as he slides out, and my body tightens around the cold intrusion.
A warm breath flowed through his hair as Harry nestled his face against it.  Harry sniffled, muted by Draco’s hair.  He wiped a cheek against the strands as his face turned.
Harry watched Malfoy’s nimble fingers flick the box open, and his own breath hissed in as Malfoy slid his hand in the box to cup something. Fuck, he wanted Malfoy’s hand to cup
He slid out, momentarily halting when the Kneazle opened one yellow eye to inspect him.  Harry and Hermione didn’t wake, and he watched them.  They were a formidable team.  An uncomfortable obsolescence bloomed in his chest as Hermione rolled to put her back to Harry, and he tightened the arm around her with a sigh.  Who was Draco Malfoy to bed the Head Auror and a Wizengamot councilwoman?
A deeply frustrated sigh flowed through her flared nostrils.  “It’s important for marks, but not to… the world.”  She flopped down next to him, nestling her head on his chest.  “I hate school, Harry.”
Fuck, he knew what he’d seen in that dream.  This was his husband.  His husband riding his cock, desperate for his come inside him.
Memories of the crisp new tent with bright white crossed wands burned in Draco’s mind. It felt inherently wrong to see those wands without the red cross.
Odbert passed him the forms and a quill.  With a scrawl and flourish on each, he signed it all away.  Good riddance.
The microwave dinged, and the man took the bundle out, peeled off several layers of plastic wrap, set the lump on a plate, and put it back in the microwave. Draco envied the lump. A slow death by microwave radiation was preferable to a public flaying.
Draco shrugged.  “Between Magnus and the Pensieve, you’ve practically licked the inside of my skull, Potter.  Shock me.”
Ron and Harry were lovely, but they weren’t family.  Maybe they could have worked on becoming friends again first if she hadn’t sent Harry that stupid message.  If
“What?  Oh!  Sorry,” he muttered sheepishly, not realizing how close to coming Draco had been.  Multiple times.  “I was just- Can I-  Uhm...” Harry trailed off, not sure how to ask him.
Jensen’s too-blue eyes sparkle with unshed tears as he approaches Harry’s desk, but Harry merely watches, numb and immobile.
“So, with the center as the overarching theme and the ring outside as the narrative,” he continued, “this reads
Frowning, he set the orb down and snuck both the sea salt truffles.  He popped one in his mouth whole and tucked it in his cheek.
Draco shrugged.  “Bit like falling in love with my own reflection, I suppose.  Exactly what I wanted.  Only what I wanted.”
“What do you think funded the research?” Draco shakes his head and avoids Harry’s gaze, then purses his lips and lets them slide free, plump and slick. “Might I invite you to spend the night?” He pats the rug in front of him.
Outrage erupted through her, and she heard a crack, felt her hand sting, and saw his face snap to the side before she realized what she’d done. Dread trickled cold down her spine as she watched him lick his lips and turn back around to face her.
“If you find any more rugs, take him some of those, too,” she instructed, sipping a spoonful of sauce with a smack of her lips.  “His nursery should have a good, thick rug in it.”
“Malfoy,” Harry demanded, poking his head around the corner of the hall to his bedroom.  “Am I your date?”
he’s ‘Uncle Magnus’ and I yell at him for trying to pass toddler-size Falmouth tracksuits off as acceptable Yule gifts.”
“Granger is your Patronus.  Got it.  Not funny at all.”  He grinned and didn't bother to hide it, because it was damned ironic.  “Alright.  So, a touch of blood on your name, then burn your knife clean, and that should be it.”
“Well, no.  You’d cut different types and lengths and still arrange them.  Ferns mean sincerity and humility, which is what you were going for.  But also bonds of magic and love."  He stopped abruptly.  “Unspecified love, not necessarily romantic.”
“Alright, you pick the next one,” Harry said, draining his glass.  Far be it from him to question a Seer.
The futon dipped behind him, and he frowned as the blanket whipped back and the other man slid underneath.  Harry groped around on the floor and found his glasses.  Hopping into bed together was a bit of a leap, but at least they were clothed.
A stone hearth takes up one corner, a bowl of Floo powder on the mantle. Draco could have used the Floo at the gala to come straight home, then. But he’d let Harry carry him back to his little flat above the workshop. Bit devious.
His head lay back on the top of the backrest. Black sparkles still dancing around the edges of his vision. His body sagged, only the ropes holding him in the chair.
He groaned and pressed his weight between her legs, reveling in feeling his pelvis flush with hers.  His entire length was buried inside her slick heat.
Jensen is gone with a pop and not even a nod to Harry. It feels trite to think that Jensen is his least-favourite soulmate, because most people don’t get one. Let alone four.
Pansy thumbed a chip in her nail polish.  “Harry’s still here, and he’s single.  But you knew that.”
“We’re a Dark Arts unit. We can’t function without a Medic. The day you didn’t show up for our assignment, three Aurors died.” The man sniffed and straightened his glasses. “I sat there with your pack and watched them die.”
What if Pansy wasn’t in Slovenia with him, and it was just him and Magnus?  What if the visions in the crystal ball were more accurate than the dreams?  What if Magnus in bed had somehow erased dreams of platforms and library fires and rings?  Did a man in bed in a crystal ball outweigh an orb’s vision of Hermione arguing with a teenage Ursella in front of the fireplace at Wheal Elvan?
Eira turned to shuffle back to her table, and he followed.  He really had walked right past her.  But she was between him and new books, so it was understandable.
Warm breath soaked into Draco’s t-shirt, and the man’s fingers splayed over Draco’s hip. His ring glowed with a webbing of scratches in the sunshine.
“It probably won’t. Robards likes me.” Harry shuffles his mail into an even pile. “And I should have thought to go in and douse the cauldrons. We don’t have a rapid-response team, but I . . ." Moonlit blond hair and the click of Malfoy’s boots skitter through his mind. “I guess I didn’t think of it.”
“Not at first, maybe.  But they were so grateful and eager, that it was hard to not want to feed them
“I… won’t,”  Potter said warily.  He reached for the wine, and Draco thought he was going to top off his mug.  He simply slid it out of Draco’s reach.  “You really
They looked to be… hugging?  In a weird, formal way, hands cupping each other’s elbows, but Malfoy’s forehead rested on Falk’s chest.  Falk had leaned down to put his face in Malfoy’s hair.
His arm was normal in this dream, the Mark’s loops and curves integrated into the larger tattoo.  But that’s not where the burning was coming from.  In fact, it wasn’t exactly a burning sensation.  And it wasn’t coming from his arm, but his eyes.
The Supreme Mugwump had given into an apoplectic rage and was hurtling profanities in Portuguese.  When she lost her voice, she reared back and whipped her mobile at Shacklebolt, but missed by a rather wide margin.
Deft fingers trailed down Harry’s abdomen, following the line of dark hair to its conclusion.  He was half-hard even before Draco squeezed the base of his shaft.
“Oh.  Luna,” he slurred.  Merlin, he’d never been so tired.  Just staying upright in the chair was a challenge.
The wards reached their crescendo and quieted, but Harry had the distinct sensation of being enclosed underwater.  Godric, how bad was this going to be?
“I know, I know,” she muttered, as she brushed crumbs from her hands.  Her blue eyes found his, but glistened with unshed tears he didn’t understand.  “I just…”
Harry groaned softly in interest, glad the music had gotten loud enough to drown him out.  Malfoy was going to take him home, and that sounded amazing.  Whose home?  Hopefully Malfoy’s.
He crept in and curled up behind him, basking in the simple privilege of the act. He was allowed to snuggle Draco Malfoy. And so much more. The scope of it all felt impossible. He could ask for hugs, and “I love you”s, and sex, and Draco had yet to ever reply with anything but eager willingness.
She peeked out from behind Ron.  “Harry, did you leave him alone?  Afterward?” she whispered, already knowing the answer.
Sea water and blood flooded her nostrils and she gagged, retching onto the ground yet again.  Raising her hand to wipe her nose, she found nothing.  No water, no blood.  An illusion?  A disgusting one, if so.
Draco’s finger presses against Harry’s entrance again, and his lips murmur into Harry’s hair. A slick, warm tendril of magic wiggles itself into his arse, and he shouts.
Vellum.  His eyes darted to some of the older books on his bookshelves.  The signature felt like a vellum cover from one of the centuries-old pieces he’d taken out of the Manor archives.
Rolling over to face him, she glared down at him, incredulous.  “You’re a little frustrating, you know that?”
The Kneazle showed him its belly, and he squinted in suspicion.  Hand on his furry noggin, he slithered a small touch of Legilimency into the beast.
But worst of all, Draco was grounded.  Literally.  A smaller bird could have flitted around within the sixty-foot range, but not a fucking eagle.  So, instead of spending his morning on the wing fishing, he was trapped in his home.  With an audience.  And that
Slowly, Harry lowered his face toward Draco’s ear, sniffing dramatically.  “Potter!  You mother fucker!”
Looking around the room, he didn’t immediately find Malfoy, which was surprising.  He was the tallest person by several feet.
Harry shrugged, face slack in confusion.  Ron sighed, figuring he owed Harry for keeping him out of Muggle prison.  And he was going to need cooperation beyond what the DMLE provided if he wanted to get his car back.
Next to her, Bryn waved to a blonde girl who was boarding the train.  He looped his arm through Malu’s and tugged her toward the train.
Would Harry stop with her there?  Would they leave him stuck to a footstool with his arse in the air while they went and fucked on his bed?
Halfway through the room, white-blonde hair and shock of red lipstick lure him back into his surroundings. Draco holds two full bags of popcorn, smiling triumphantly. He holds a bag out to Harry, and his clammy fingers close around it.
“I… I’m sorry, Ms. Granger,” he stammered, unnecessarily sliding his glasses up his nose.  “Someone released them all a few days ago.”
With a pop, he Apparated the miles to the road in front of Malfoy’s wards and placed a studiously polite knock on them.  His mum would approve of his manners, he thought.
He’s devastatingly gorgeous.  Like a sunset through a forest fire haze.  I don’t blame The Prophet for putting him on the front page so often.  He hates it, but such is the price of beauty.  I’d clone him, if I could, as an act of public service, and it’s probably good that I can’t.  I’d give Molly Weasley’s uterus a run for its money if I had one.
Harry shook his head a bit too quickly for Draco’s liking.  “None, I think.”  He licked his lips, hands sliding together over Draco’s upper arm.  “The Wizengamot would have been contacted, and this is Hermione’s registered Floo.  So, I’d say it’s safe that parole breaches are only reported to the Head Auror.”
The opening was suddenly clear, and he climbed out.  She was pacing between the kitchen and living room.  Which was the better move?  Walking past her to get a towel from the bedroom, or standing still, not attracting attention?  Was her attack instinct triggered by motion?
Harry frowned.  Malfoy looked like death sitting between his parents, and he wondered if this memory was from early in his time at Durmstrang.  His hair was still short, and he looked rather underweight.
Harry flailed around and walked a circle in the road.  Malfoy pushed off and walked across the road.  There was a chance he’d smash into them yet.
Images with white-blonde hair disappeared into each other to his side.  Fragments of sky and brooms merged near his feet.  Water, deep and dark, in moving visions, piled above him ominously.
“Greetings,” Draco replied with a bewildered shrug.  Just because Ron was in the other room, they were formally announcing their arrivals now?
In a cobalt-glazed pot the size of a bathtub, a cactus sits next to the fireplace. No, he thinks, on closer inspection. Not a cactus. A pine tree shaped like a cactus, arms bent over and over at awkward, sharp angles. The entire plant is covered in blunt, scale-like needles that spiral out at the tips of the branches and cover the bark entirely.
“A boon, then, Blackblood.” Odbert croaked, straightening.  Draco nodded, accepting the deal.  Having the Goblin community owe him a favor was no small thing.
Harry thought he'd earned at least a chuckle, but a shuddering inhale shook Draco’s frame.  He looked up and raised eyebrows in acknowledgement.  “It was awful," he joked weakly.  "Two of the truffles had marshmallow in them.”
Nostrils flaring and breath shuddering in, he tried to ignore the hilarity that he was holding a picture of Harry Potter’s cock in his hand. Let alone that Potter had sent it to Granger with that damn thumb thrown in as a dignity-defying measure.
Very odd, indeed. Cringing, he held the morsel between his lips and offered it to her.  Almost grudgingly, she took it and gulped it down.
“Adams!” Draco barked, watching the man startle and getting a little thrill out of scaring an Auror.  “Does your magic misfire more around the full moon?”
In his third year, he’d been left unattended in Dumbledore’s office shortly after the Sorting Ceremony.  It had been a rather informative conversation.  “No, I mean… Lucius bribed it,” he said warily “to sort me into Slytherin.”
He opened the door to Calix Fucking Onasis’ stupid, gorgeous face yet again.   He smiled, showing off perfect teeth and just the right amount of humor in his warm brown eyes.
“Oh, gods, Dray,” Harry whispered.  His entire body burned with the need to climb on top of him, pin him down, and fuck him till they both came.  His jaw clenched as he took a slow breath and focused on keeping his hand still.
, but it didn’t quite rhyme with it. It was so close to tumbling out his mind to dissolve on his tongue.
Panic unfurled up his chest and tightened his throat.  There was no evidence of other redecorating, and this new sofa was no upgrade.  It looked like the wall of a padded cell folded in half.  Not aesthetically-pleasing at all.
“My whole life is pretty much fucked last week of August through mid-September,” Ron muttered, scratching his beard.  “And then quite a bit of September is restocking after the start of term.”  The annual Hogwarts rush was the most lucrative few weeks of the year, but it owned him.  Sleeping on his office floor was the glamorous life of a proprietor.
It had taken her five days.  Five fucking days, to realize she’d forgotten it.  Beyond the range of Muggle last ditch efforts.
examples on how to mistreat a child.  There was no reason he couldn’t grow up to become Uncle Vernon.
, and Draco’s tight smile and ambivalent nod.  It wasn’t a great name for a jewelry line, Ron had to admit.
He shrugged and hoisted himself to his feet, only swaying slightly.  “He said he panicked, but honestly, it was probably gut instinct.  Mungo’s couldn’t have gotten him in a bed fast enough to save him.”
“So…” Draco drawled, watching Harry’s fingertips trace the design down his arm.  “You’re answerable to yourself.  The man with his hand on my balls is the one in charge of making sure he keeps his hands off my balls.”
The sunny little shop on Horizont fills with an aroma that’s second only to fresh-cut cypress, in his opinion, but there are few occasions for cypress. Cypress is mostly good for underwater-
“Not my fault you hide behind your paper in a corner like a wanking pervert,” he said with a smirk, which earned him another swat.
Malfoy turned, striding to his pile of discarded clothing.  This room absolutely fucking reeked of sex now.  One of them, he assumed Weasley, had braided her hair.  And all three of them looked very happily rumpled.  Malfoy smirked.  Maybe this venture could be worth the trouble.
He briefly debated whether or not to ask her if she’d done this before, but decided it ultimately didn’t matter.  He was going to fuck Hermione Granger's arse precisely as much as she wanted him to.
She set her sandwich down and flicked her wand.  And flicked.  And flicked.  Like a terrier after a rat, she was.
Draco huffs a laugh right into his mouth, pulls back and glares down at him, wiping tears from his eyes. “I very much wish I were. But not on weekdays. And even-“
and all.”  Draco very slowly licked his lips, letting Harry watch the slow path of his tongue over the slick pink skin.  Harry’s breath shuddered, just a touch.  His hips pressed into Draco’s foot, just a touch.
He snatched the envelope off the table.  Ignoring the sweat on his palms, he popped the seal and pulled out a single paper.
Potter’s apartment was the most boring space he’d quite possibly ever chosen to grace with his presence.  Clean.  And surprisingly tidy.  But pathologically boring.  No art, no pictures, not even any real color.  If a Dementor became an interior decorator, this would be how it would finish a space, Draco thought.
The talk of weddings had set the two women to chatting, and their easy banter lulled Hermione into a productive groove of scrutinizing the ever-loving hell out of the citations for their project.  So many small errors.  Delicious little errors to snuff out one by one like gnats.
“You want this?” Harry waggles the cape, and Draco’s head snaps back and forth with the motion. He growls a low reply, and Harry smirks. “You want it back?”
He flopped onto his back and stared at the ceiling. He’d have to go back to his flat eventually. His not-husband seemed to like having Draco around, but he felt like a burden. A bore. A duty. A Captain surely had better things to do. Like interview new Medics.
“Not so fast, Dray.”  Harry looked up at him with that damnable smirk, head tilting back to catch his gaze.  “I believe you have a sample of… ‘Ogden’s Knob’ first.”
Ron concentrated very hard on his teacup.  Harry watched him, the light slowly dawning behind his eyes.
Those threads of pleasure wind tight at the base of Harry’s cock as his fist skims over his come-slick skin.  “Fuck, so close.”
Draco’s head fell back down as she pushed into him, watching him carefully.  “Fuck, Granger,” he panted.  “Fuck… Fuck…
“How could I use your own emotions against you as a weapon?”  Harry chuckled and nipped at a corner of the scone.  “And who would even do that?”
Satisfied with his preparation, Draco leaned his elbows behind him on the table and began a quick, snapping rhythm down onto the length.  This time, for pleasure, and it was obvious.
Merlin, how was he supposed to explain to her he couldn’t do that?  That he’d hurt his first few girlfriends with his lack of restraint?
Draco holds his hands out, palms up, and his eyes dart as he thinks. He flinches on Harry’s lap, and a surprised squeak comes from Draco, but he doesn’t appear injured. Harry smells something vaguely sweet, and familiar. There’s a shiny glint on Draco’s hands.
Miraculously, he thought, she still wanted a response from him. Tension in his shoulders began to melt, gathering instead in his groin as she idly traced one hand up her ribcage. He watched her nipple tighten in response.
Draco woke to bright sunlight and a disappointingly empty expanse of white sheets. It had to be past noon, by the sun. He stretched and lazily slid a hand down to cup himself. The dream he’d been enjoying had already melted away, but it must have been exciting. He rubbed his face with both hands, and hoisted himself up to standing. Everything felt wrung out and sore from a long flight yesterday. Caffeine was in order.
He let a small smile peek through.  The Unspeakable was clearly enthusiastic about her work, and it was oddly charming.  And she appreciated gossip, as well.
Pansy’s phone vibrated again and Hermione’s name slid across the screen.  She read it with another smirk.
“Muggle tool.  Or toy, kind of.  You put rocks and grit in it, and it rolls them around till they’re shiny.”  Her gaze lingered on the oven, but her attention was far away.  “My dad had one in the garage when I was little.  Mum gave it to him for Christmas, but then it was so loud, she made him plug it in in the garage.  Took days, but the quartz came out really pretty.”
She blew out a slow breath and tried to concentrate on her tepid surroundings.  She was going to be sitting in a courtroom deciding a man’s fate in a few hours.  And had just been asked to gang up on the top authority in magical law enforcement.  Meanwhile, on every side of her, bored law students struggled to stay awake while one of their own crucified herself on the monotony of her own words, likely taken verbatim from a textbook.
She wanted to tell him to fuck off, and go to hell, and call him a vile Death Eater son of a bitch… but
He didn’t look sorry.  He looked pleased as all hell.  Harry frowned and felt through the bond, too.
.  Out of the corner of his eye, Harry caught Connie nonchalantly lean into the aisle and flip her “Press” badge.  Shacklebolt frowned at her, but Harry sighed in relief.
Through the mist, he saw a tall figure step out onto the field and turn to face the bleachers near him.
His left hand’s grip around his own cock was awkward, lacking the ambidexterity to do a decent job bringing himself off.  Switching hands wouldn’t be better.
“Well, alright, then.” Harry clears his throat and arranges the halved potato on the chopping board. “Feel free to surprise me.”
“I think I am,” Ron said with a grin.  “I believe the Wizengamot has to do thorough background checks on new administrators.  Maybe even home inspections.”
His hips stall. Harry whimpers and tries to thrust himself back on to Draco’s cock. A fist knots itself in Harry’s hair, and he groans at the sharp pain. Draco pulls him up by the hair and wraps a cashmere-covered arm around Harry’s chest. The soft jumper rubs against his back, over his nipples, and along his sides. A whiny, pitiful sigh slips from him.
Her strategy had worked up until this point in her life, and she was finding it a strange flavor of humiliation to have to admit to men she fancied that she mainly fancied them during a specific part of her cycle.
Harry crushed the empty containers into the bin with a scowl.  Collaborating with Falk for the Wizengamot trial had been downright enjoyable, but the tidbits that slipped out of Draco about him were worrying.
With a sigh, he realized he was getting hard again, and the discomfort had faded.  His hips gave a subtle thrust, and she smiled, rubbing her cheek against his full length.
“We know very little so far, about anything,” Robards answers, and Draco listens to the swell of murmuring around him.
Potter’s mouth had opened under his, slick and pink and fuckable, and it tasted like hunger. It tasted like a dare. Like flying too fast and too high, too late at night.
these things. I don’t know, I— I haven’t been able to stop thinking about that, since I saw that tea cosy.”
A sigh shuddered from him as his thumb and forefinger found the outline of the head of his cock, squeezing it gently.
Draco’s back is a pearl expanse that Harry’s lips need to feel to make sure it’s real. Sweat beads in the furrow of his spine, and it wets Harry’s lips as he kisses it away.
“I’ll get you back home, though.  Don’t worry.”  Ron sighed and eyed the Griffin warily.  “Wouldn’t be right to leave you here.”
Draco had fallen asleep to the sound of them discussing werewolf-friendly DMLE policies and options for family leave requirements.  It was rather nice.  A different kind of love.  A different kind of bedsport.
Draco sniffed back tears as he woke, wiping a cheek in Harry’s hair.  Pansy in labor and Millicent at the bedside with Draco attending.  So strange, but so right.  She hadn’t looked much older in the dream, but then pregnancy had a way of obscuring age.
Luna looked over her shoulder and winked. She absolutely understood what she was doing. The minx.  His year spent in his Animagus form didn’t have too many lingering effects, but she’d apparently found one. A new game.
“That’s it, then?” Harry asked, having expected to at least argue or lie, if not pull out the Auror’s Last Gasp; Obliviate and Apparate.
Good to know, Falk, Harry thought tersely.  This guide of his had been entirely too thorough, and annoyance was setting in.
Harry and the boy share a smirk. “Why not?” Harry asks her, then turns back to her son. “I can make you a set of pressed birch wood wands with unicorn hair cores. They won’t give you a stomachache, they’ll work fine, and you can just get a new one out when you need it.”
“I suppose you can just Apparate now that you’ve been here,” he said, taking her in.  The anger added a glint to her eyes that he couldn’t help but find appealing.
“Harry, Kate. Kate, Harry.” Draco gestures between them. “Kate’s a Squib. And a Bulstrode,” Draco says with a nod.
“And here I thought you’d brought me something.  Mum’ll be thrilled.  You are her favorite son, after all.”
.  You overestimate the civility of men who have little left in life but each other’s bodies.”  His fingers gave up on teasing threads from the futon and took turns finding snags in his cuticles.  “I spent three or four nights a week there.  Lucius would follow the Trace in my signet ring to find me wherever I ended up in the morning.  With whomever.  Hell of a way to wake up.”
“Do I know you?”  His fingers traced over the tops of the confections and settled on an espresso one.  The blur snapped forward and slid the box out from under his fingertips.
Desperation and need gushed hot and choking through his lungs, and he gasped. His body flushed and ran with goosebumps, and a deep groan shook his chest.
Why was that, though?  Was there something more inherently satiating about wizards compared to Muggles?  Coincidence?  Luck, maybe, that the three of them just happened to be rather complementary in bed?
.  The entirety of him thrummed with need.  The palm of his unoccupied hand skimmed the edge of the couch, leaving damp lines in the velvet.  His toes flexed and spread for want of traction.
Armed with fistfuls of apple slices, Lou was released to sticky up the kitchen.  Ron smiled, pleased someone enjoyed the literal fruits of his labor.
Harry snorted a laugh and buried his face in Draco’s chest. His words were muffled, and barely audible, but Draco hugged him closer, anyway. “You really got that inscribed, didn’t you.”
Falk didn’t stand so much as lurch upward bodily and harness the movement into a choppy, quick walk.  He was headed to the food truck, where the man was lifting a basket out of a fryer.  He arrived at the window precisely when the man turned toward it with his chips.  Legilimancy like that was eerie.
A split-second concern over his unmanicured nails was interrupted by her drawing her wand from the dress.  “
Hermione owned it like a piece of herself.  An instrument that only she could play, but if she were feeling generous, that maybe she would let him dance along to.
, Ronald,” Draco said, almost proudly, as he held out a flower-covered arm.  The floral arrangement killed the threat of the Mark below it.
Draco hits the floor in multiple thuds and a wheeze and stares at the ceiling for several long moments. He swallows, Adam's apple bobbing under Harry’s hand. Harry watches as his breathing slows. His eyes glint in the moonlight, but he’s gaunt, as if he’s been on a bender. His cheekbones are stark and beautiful, and his collarbones sweep out from his chest and-
The items were blurry through the lingering Unspeakable, but it didn’t matter.  He knew what was in every vial.  He’d lived it, relived it, stored it, and continued remembering it.  Most of the worst moments of his life were in those vials.
A pen clicked several times in the kitchen, and Draco waited for the man to close a file, which he immediately did. Draco set the DMLE guide on the coffee table and stretched out on the couch. It was a good couch. In a sunny, big-windowed livingroom that looked out into a backyard with the apple tree.
Harry waited, expecting another prompt round of responses from Hermione.  He stared at the screen until it went black.  He shrugged and tucked his mobile in his pocket.  With a stretch, he hopped up and braced himself.
Several of the other Wizengamot members were fiddling with mobiles in their laps, as well, but with little discretion.  The man who’d worn a tuxedo to Draco’s resentencing was absolutely glued to his.  Likely placing bets on upcoming Harpies matches.
“I’m going to ask her to marry me, Malfoy.  I don’t know if that changes things for you.  Keep it under your hat, though.  Or… in your knickers.”  She smirked, and it took a good, long moment for her words to sink in.
The man flicked a finger across his mobile screen. “Looks like it’s been closed for quite a while. Are you sure this is it?”
Settling himself on his side, Draco patted the bed in front of him in invitation, and Harry’s breath hitched.  He’d only been wanking to the idea of Draco inside him and Hermione on his cock for a month or so.  It only took up… well, most of his idle thoughts.
. The peak of it barely rose to his waist, and it took up only a little more space than the couch. Thin ropes tethered the peaks of the tent to the leg of a coffee table on one end and a potted plant on the other.
He pulled out the bedraggled rectangle of warped red and yellow stripes.  It wasn’t pretty, but it had kept him warm in the drafty castle many nights.
Sitting up suddenly, he gripped the seat in front of him, letting a wave of nausea and vertigo pass.
The light flicked on to reveal his lanky, disjointed form.  The bond roared to life, and Harry froze as breath-halting terror poured through to match his own.
A greyhound’s long muzzle nudges the door open, and wide brown eyes watch him warily. Her coat is a light tan, like a perfectly-roasted marshmallow. He holds out a hand for her inspection, and she gives it a few cursory sniffs and a nudge of approval.
Harry paused, nearly fully withdrawn, and pressed back in.  Draco’s body arched into him, a needy whine trickling through his nose.  His hands clutched the sheets as he fought to stay still.
“Oh!  I suppose it is.  No, I’m fine.  Quite good.  But Hermione’s locked up on Level Two for smuggling contraband into Ministry Headquarters and-“
He slid forward and threw his arms over Draco’s shoulders, forcing their chests together.  His breath hitched as he waited for a response, and exhaled as Draco’s arms scooped under his.
Circe’s snatch, Potter took a surprisingly long time to get dressed for someone who usually looked like he threw himself into a Muggle clothes dryer and just wore whatever stuck to him.
A plastic straw nudged Draco's lips, and his jaw tried to part, but met the binding pressure of the wires threaded between his teeth, followed by searing pain.  Not the first time Lucius had broken his jaw, but possibly the worst.
Draco ducks out of the fireplace and stands, hands full of Merlin-knows-what, but he beams like the sun, and Harry forgets how to greet a guest. Draco steps onto the thick rug, and a gust of warm air that smells like foliage follows him before the Floo dies down.
Bringing up the location on her phone, she grimaced.  That section of coastline was very remote.  There weren’t even real roads near it.
Water followed his hand, and a cool wet line traced down her forehead, between her eyebrows, and down her nose.  An obnoxious dangling drop of water tickled her nostrils and made her open her eyes.  She hadn’t realized she’d closed them.  Or that she’d had him in her mouth long enough for him to be hard again.
“Uhm, a long time?” Draco guesses with a baffled shrug. A sweet potato rolls off the counter, and he stabs a knife into it to pick it up.
Harry runs his hands under Draco’s jumper, under his shirt, and up his chest; ignoring the throbbing ache in his jeans.
He’d been avoiding broaching the topic since Potter’s announcement yesterday.  Yes, Harry Potter was moderately desperate to get in Draco Malfoy’s pants, he reminded himself.  But was he enough of an imbecile to indenture himself to DMLE service to hasten the removal of said pants?  Was he so impatient that he’d wear a badge for
“Uhm…” Harry draws a slow breath and stares at Draco’s lips, daring them to smirk. “I can’t Apparate.”
Existing outside his wards at all was a terrible idea, but especially at night.  The cowardly shit-stains who liked to send rigged owl messages tended to have them delivered after sundown.
“Ministry protocol.” Harry grimaces in the dark at his own weak answer. Jensen’s questions have taken on a definite air of superiority. “We’re not dependent on Muggle technology. You should probably brush up on wandwork and investigative charms while you’re here.”
The stars faded, replaced by granite walls, a thick rug, and a vision of soft skin and chestnut curls.  He rolled over on her, intentionally graceless and clumsy.
The weight of his orgasm broke through his control, and his hips thrust up against her. His hands scrabbled for purchase only to find the back of the chair.
“Hey, Birthday Girl, your mobile’s ringing.  Says it’s your mum calling,” he hissed, hoping he wasn’t waking Ron, too.
There it is, Harry thought.  There’s the common ground between him and Malfoy.  Snarky bastards, the both of them.  Reassured, Harry decided to dive right in to the reason they were sitting on a bench waiting for chips from a truck that probably wasn’t even supposed to be serving food yet.
It’s a trick. It’s all another trick, but I’m not sure if it’s between my ears, where I live, or on his lips, where I come alive.  “Not to do what?”
“Come to Cardiff,” a weak female voice faltered.  “Please.”  It laid down, closed its eyes, stilled, and dissolved.
“Speaking of which, you gonna teach me how to use this fancy knife?” Ron asked, trying to flip the silver knife between his fingers, fumbling it horribly, and nicking his thumb.
“Not that your wards can’t handle it, but I have to be reachable by owl.  And I wouldn’t mind finding out who sends you curses.”
It looked like Harry.  The real Harry. The scar was correct.  But it had been five years.  Plenty of time to perfect such a complicated Polyjuice.
Draco set the glass on the table and watched Harry’s gaze flit up and down his pajama-clad form.  Standing knee to knee, he looked down into repentant green eyes, sentiment stirring.  Gods, this man and his blundering.  Why did things end up
offer.  Delphi sounded like a terrible, fascinating idea.  It probably looked like the Slytherin dormitory and the Hall of Prophecy smashed together and rolled in a Dementor robe.
She nuzzled her lips against his soft hair as she drowsily thought that this was an unexpectedly tender moment she was having with Malfoy, of all people.  But it was rather nice.
Harry was sitting on a park bench, which was not warm yet mid-morning, in Muggle London, watching Falk negotiate with a food truck worker.  The vendor had warned that it would take a half-hour to warm up his fryer, and another fifteen to actually make the chips.  Falk told him that was fine.  He’d wait.
Harry’s cock drips down his thigh, and a reedy whine forces itself from his throat. Because Draco is too goddamn slow.
She thought of him putting his hands on the mattress on either side of her head, and starting to move, thrusting gently at first.  And then he would drop down onto his elbows along her sides, and press her into the bed with his weight.
“Lovely.  I’ll add a line encouraging ticket sales,” she said, scribbling.  “And Coach, any truth to the rumors you’re dating the Harpies Seeker, Jonathan Augustus?”
He grunted and gripped the back of her head, crushing her mouth to his.  It was… different.  Salty.  Less bitter than he’d expected.
Draco rolled his eyes at the plastic constellation Draco above him. “Fitzsimmons, spotted dick is supposed to come in a can, not a canteen, you bloody wanker.”
His hands found her hip bones, and his thumbs gently dug in where the muscles of her abdomen met the flared crests of her pelvis.  Unexpectedly, her body responded by parting her thighs in invitation.
slicked through her memory.  Along with the feel of Ron’s hands in her hair and him hard against her, Harry leaning invitingly back on her couch.  Anxiety and desire made her breath hitch.  Maybe it was a coincidence.
Draco smooths the mesh tank top down over the band of his jeans. His head tips back and forth, as if he’s sifting options like sand through his head. “I could be troubled on Thursday nights.”
Ugh, nothing made her request feel less desperate.  Muggle men were so much easier.  They were everywhere, and it didn’t take much to get them in bed.
Draco let go and wiped the collected mist from his face with his sleeves.  A pop of Apparition echoed around the stadium faintly, and he ignored it.
He rolled to his knees and threw pillows aside, resting his forearms on the stone ledge above the bed.  Notebooks, shells, pearls, and his own glasses greeted him, and he swept them away to make space.
His route puts his good ear toward the wall, and Draco’s head is on the crowd side. The tip of a velvet-soft ear flicks against Harry’s cheek, and he turns to find a reporter right next to him, peppering him with questions.
“We wouldn’t want to sully this lovely rug, hm?” Draco says, listless. His gaze wanders down Harry’s chest, and his tongue darts out to wet his lips. “I’ll be very, very neat.”
“Oh, sorry,” he sighed softly.  “But no, nothing like that.  I am not a vector of disease.  Currently.  And I checked you thoroughly when I Healed your shoulder.  Took care of a budding sinus infection, too.”  His tone was off.  Monotonous.  Dead.
catching up, in the case of Ron. He was obviously listening intently and several times opened his mouth to chime in, but quickly closed it and refocused on his food.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
His breath shudders out as he slides the garlic and carrots into the pan, then lines up ingredients on the counter. From Draco’s pantry; cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and sugar. From the groceries; a can of coconut milk, red curry paste, and his secret shortcut ingredient, a jar of chunky peanut butter.
Falk’s hand slid up to the middle of Harry’s back, and he instinctively arched into the touch.  He couldn’t help but imagine the tattooed hand between his shoulders was Malfoy’s.  Long, elegant fingers, delicate wrists, barely-there arm hair.  Harry shook his head, focusing on Basilia’s instructions.
,” Draco retorted, “that I might have a bit of a thing for dark-haired men, in general.  Formative years being what they are.”
And particularly wonderful breasts, he mused.  Her pale skin against his was familiar, and he eased her onto her back, tracing her sides with his hands.
Harry takes a steadying breath, thankful for the change in atmosphere. “I’m really not sure, that’s the issue. I haven’t worried about me — about what I would do outside this house — for almost 12 years. It’s going to take some time to figure that out, I’m afraid.”
“I did. We ended up sitting in a Muggle coffee shop for hours, just talking.” Harry smiles at the memory. “It turns out Albus has been really worried about me being home by myself and had been upset in front of Scorpius. Scorpius had asked Draco to check on me.”
“Healer Carr, thank you for coming.” He ushers her in and moves to sit on the edge of the bed next to Harry, taking his hand. “This is my fiancé, Harry.”
“Yes.” James’ response is firm and without hesitation, and Harry feels immense relief that James is not feeling pressured. Granted, his own first experiences with men were under different circumstances, but no one had told him he could say no or change his mind, and he’d done things he really hadn’t wanted to do. He doesn’t want James in that kind of situation, and he doesn’t want him to put a partner in that situation.
“James, your mobile is in Draco’s jacket pocket. I was running a bit warm and didn’t want to wear mine.”
Harry nods in agreement with Draco. “And then you would stay here, Matthew, if that was your choice, or you could choose different arrangements. We will support you no matter what choice you make.”
is what you took away from this?!” Draco rolls his eyes. “Yes, those trousers make your arse look fantastic, all right?”
“That’s quite all right,” Draco assures her. “What we found was an excellent fit for our space. We find ourselves needing furniture for this one’s bedroom today.”
“Just like that. That’s…nngh.” Harry trails off, seeing stars as Draco brushes his prostate with every stroke. He can already feel his balls tightening and his release building in his belly.
“Brilliant! I told Mina I would see if she can come visit. She wants me to come to her house again, too!” She squeezes next to Harry in the recliner and snuggles into his chest. “I’m really glad to be home.”
“That was my bet. Hermione hypothesised they’ll say we’ve added her to our relationship and are now a triad.”
Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “I’ve never really gone into detail about it with the kids. They were four and two when it happened. Albus has no memories of the Weasleys or his mum. James has a few spotty memories of them, but he knows that there was a disagreement and we went separate ways.” Harry feels Malfoy’s concerned eyes watching him as he fiddles with his cup. “If they asked, I’d explain further. If they expressed a desire to see them, we would discuss it. I don’t want to add that emotional weight to what they already handle. The kids and I, we have a very open relationship and talk pretty freely about everything, but I also don’t see the need to put that burden on them.”
Suddenly, Harry’s brain is going a million miles an hour and his chest is tightening just that little bit around his heart and he’s clutching the throw pillow to his chest.
“Merlin no, but we’re going to do it anyhow,” Draco quips. “We’ve talked about building on to the house, actually.”
In the three weeks since the kids returned to Hogwarts, Potter Cottage has been a flurry of activity. Draco brought in several magical contractors, and after seeing proposed plans and thorough interviews, he and Harry had selected a company to construct the addition to the house. Adding Matthew to the family, along with Regulus’ impending arrival, has rendered the already-spacious home too small. Six kids and two adults need more than five bedrooms and one communal living space.
Two days later, the staff at St Mungo’s is no closer to figuring out what’s wrong, and Harry is losing patience. He’s nauseous and vomiting, even with intravenous potion drips. He’s completely exhausted from a trip to the loo. And he’s tired of being poked and prodded and tested with no productive outcome.
Scrambling off her chair, Lily kneels beside her father. Harry takes her hand and places it where Draco’s hand was. Lily is immediately rewarded with a firm press against her hand.
After several minutes of pondering and discussion, Draco seems to have made up his mind. Harry pulls his mobile out of his pocket. “Let me just text Hermione and make sure this brand isn’t overly complicated to ward. She says some are easier than others.” Harry looks to his phone as he quickly sends Hermione a text. “She’ll probably respond in a minute or two.”
“This…” Draco’s voice catches, and he has to clear his throat to continue. “This is where I found you on the floor. And there were several times this last week I didn’t know if I’d get to have you home again. And I knew I loved our child before this, but I didn’t realise just how much I wanted this baby until we almost lost it. I’m so relieved to have you both home safe.”
“Surely there’s an acceptable name for our son somewhere in here.” Draco shakes his head and smiles. “I know you’ve written some things down, too.”
“I’ll Apparate to my flat, get what I need, and pick up some dinner.” Draco looks Harry over as they step into the elevator.
After Hermione’s gone home, Harry spreads several large books and sheets of parchment out over the bed in front of himself and Draco. They’ve decided to use the rest of the evening to try to find a name for their son.
“What’s the matter?” Draco is already dressed and perched on the dressing bench, tugging on his socks.
Harry takes a deep breath and nods. He’s finding it hard to remain calm and accept the testing and prodding with no time to mentally prepare himself, especially this one since it’s invasive in a very personal manner. Healer Carr moves to her conjured table and begins pulling more equipment from her bag.
“The kids come home for break next week. We were going to do it over the weekend anyway, so might as well do it today.” Draco seems unconcerned, but while Harry really doesn’t care if people know — he’s quite proud to be carrying Draco’s child — he’s not looking forward to the gasps and the stares and the gossip.
“All right, come sit for a minute and then we’ll figure out what kind of takeaway we want for dinner.”
sound like something that would appeal to me.” Harry exhales heavily. “It just seems to have a more personal meaning, as well.”
“Exactly.” Harry doesn’t want to cause any of the children any unnecessary distress, but he admittedly does worry about Al more than the other three in that regard. “How do you think they’ll take the news?”
“I find I’m quite enjoying it myself.” Harry is sure he looks ridiculous with the sappy smile he can’t wipe off his face. He kisses Draco gently on the lips. “I could get used to this.”
“Hmmm,” Draco intones thoughtfully. Several moments of silence pass before he speaks again. “Would you consider working at CRMM?”
“You’ll make quite the pair, then.” Harry beams at his son, then turns to Hermione. “Have you seen my groom?”
“He’s making plans with me, Claire,” a deep voice says from the doorway to the lab. Harry’s gaze shoots to the doorway where Draco is leaning against the doorframe, looking absolutely fabulous in black trousers and a ribbed turtleneck jumper in slate blue. His eyes are narrowed at Claire and he looks a bit upset.
“Enjoy your wedding, gentlemen. Congratulations! I’ll see myself out.” With a wave of her wand, everything is packed, and Healer Carr bustles from the room.
A delighted grin from Draco makes Harry’s pixies take up their dancing once more. “Absolutely!” They set off down the hill side by side. “That’s one of the downsides to having a flat in London proper. No place to play Quidditch.”
Harry hands Draco the other cup of tea, which he holds aloft while Harry settles between his legs on the couch. Harry lays back against Draco’s chest and tangles their legs together.
Harry’s hands wander from Draco’s hips to under his t-shirt, and he slides it up over Draco’s head before Draco shrugs the rest of the way out of it. Harry takes in Draco’s chest up close, tracing one finger down the single thin white scar from just below Draco’s right collar bone across to his left nipple. It’s nearly invisible unless you’re up close, but it’s there, and Harry can’t help but feel ashamed that he’s the one responsible for marring Draco’s body.
Harry hesitates. Yes, he’s hungry, but his primary concern is less what’s for dinner and more not having another awful night. He takes advantage of pressing the button to call the elevator to gather his thoughts and maybe a little of his courage. He looks around to make sure they’re alone and reaches to squeeze Draco’s hand.
“What brought this on?” There’s a small, pleased smile on Draco’s face now, as well as in his voice. Harry’s pretty sure he’s been thinking about the same thing and just hasn’t brought it up.
Malfoy hesitates and runs a hand through his short blond hair, standing some of it on end. His gaze shifts away beyond Harry to look at something across the room. He seems a bit uneasy as he speaks again.
“You don’t look like you feel well. You’re pale. You’ve been in the hospital. Draco hasn’t let go of you since we got home. Something is wrong.”
“Pretty good. I’m actually not nauseous. Still tired. And I’m awfully anxious to know the baby is all right.”
Harry swallows hard and feels his nerves rising. He’s never done this with anyone, but he knows what he wants — provided Draco is comfortable with it, as well.
“How long after I left did you wait before you started getting ready?” Hermione asks, shaking her head and smiling.
interested in the job Draco described, and Draco really does seem to think Harry would be capable of doing it.
“James.” Draco’s voice is gentle and encouraging, even if Harry can hear the nervousness in his tone. “Just say it. Everyone in this room has a preference for men, even if one of them is your dad. We’re not going to judge you. We want to help.”
Draco nods and kisses Harry’s forehead before heading down the stairs. No sooner has Harry undressed and slipped under the covers again than Healer Carr bustles in.
Healer Powell waves his wand and two oddly shaped supports appear on either side of the bed. Harry knows from his reading that he’s expected to put his calves in them, basically spreading his arse for display. They’re different than the ones for witches, in order to tip his pelvis for a better exit path for the baby.
“My mother’s owl.” He raises his voice. “Leave him, Lil. I’ll be right down. He’ll bite your finger off if the letter isn’t for you.”
“That should work. If we send Edgar off tonight, we should hear back by tomorrow.” Draco’s fingers trace patterns on Harry’s belly. “Provided they can come, I think we should tell them Friday night and give them the weekend to ask questions.”
“Well, whilst I was helping the two boys put together Scorp’s new room, Scorp informed me that he and Al both think our relationship is great and that they like that we’re together.”
“Our second year of Hogwarts, Ginny’s first year, she was regularly possessed by Voldemort through a diary that was cursed by some very Dark Magic.” Harry purposefully omits the fact that Draco’s father was the one who gave Ginny the diary. He’s not even sure if Draco knows that particular bit of information, and he’s certainly not going to tell him now. “They had no explanation when Ginny’s core haemorrhaged after Lily was born. All the testing for known pregnancy-related core issues was negative.”
“What do you think, little one?” Draco puts his hands on Harry’s hips, speaking to the bump. “Would you like to be Regulus Etamin? The brightest spot for both your daddies in a very long time?”
He’s not sure how much time has passed before he opens his eyes and sees terrified silver eyes wet with tears staring back.
Harry shrugs into his leather jacket as Draco pulls his own jacket from the coat closet. “There’s an Apparition point not too far from Currys.”
“I was worried about that. My parents said as long as I refuse to ‘behave appropriately’, I can forget about anything they do for me. They do pay my phone bill.”
he whispers, needing a moment to adjust. His own breathing is startlingly loud as he moves slightly, pushing against the dildo as he wishes fervently it was Draco’s cock instead. He rocks back and forth just a little, the discomfort slowly giving way to the blissful feeling of being completely filled. “
“We’re having a son,” Harry whispers, turning to accept a quick kiss from Draco. “Can you go back to his face? Just for a moment?”
“I'm afraid I don’t understand.” The caring and sincerity in Draco’s eyes and voice comfort Harry enough to allow his body to relax, just a bit. He untwists his hands and lays them on his knees, focusing on Draco.
“I thought maybe you and I could go into wizarding London today and pick out new bedroom furniture. What I have now isn’t enough room for both of our stuff, and it would be something that’s
“Ok, let me tell you what’s going on and then you can ask any questions. I’ll be as honest as I can with you, as always.” Harry glances over at Draco. “I know the four of you know that Draco and I got to know each other better after you all headed off to Hogwarts. What you don’t know is that we’ve found that we enjoy each others’ company romantically, as well, and that we’re in a relationship.” Harry watches the children's eyes go wide as he reaches over and squeezes Draco’s hand. He can’t help but chuckle a little at Lily, who is bouncing excitedly. Clearly she is not upset by this development.
“He’s right, Har.  I did think about making him soup earlier.  It’s just hereditary.”  Ron ripped off an overly-large piece of naan and shoved it whole into Draco’s mouth.
occurred to him that Potter would interpret holding his drink as a suggestion to consume it.  Nor that Potter would practically overdose himself on straight carnal desire out of boredom.
Harry mumbles something in his sleep, and I’m pretty sure it’s about food, because he then hums and chews on empty air.  Maybe he’ll bite his tongue.  I hope he doesn’t, though. For entirely selfish reasons.  Fun fact.  St Potter is the patron saint of sucking cock.  I saw it in a cheap porno rag on Knockturn, and I’d be hard pressed to prove them wrong.
He gasped, eyes wide, as a single red rose unfurled in her hand. She smiled, tucked it carefully into her jacket against her chest, and made for the back door of the Burrow.
Draco smiles up at them, soft but resigned. “Brunch on Saturday, Parkinson. You’ll survive till then. The hormones are getting to you.”
.”  She glared at him, somehow terrifying but thrilling as she lowered her head and slid her mouth over the head of his cock.
But the man had never introduced himself. And none of the nurses or healers had greeted the man with anything but "Oh!
“You don’t trust me alone with him,” Draco accused, tone deceptively light for as heavy as his heart felt.
Adams had finished the sausage rolls and looked ready for a nap.  His chin was cradled in his palms, and his eyes were blinking more and more slowly.
With a deep breath, he slit the envelope open roughly with a finger and peered inside, half-expecting a swarm of venomous insects or a glitter bomb or something equally annoying.  Instead, a piece of coarse paper stuck to the inside of the envelope.
I am malleable in his hands, filling with molten gold as he moves, a rising tide of release that grows as he quickens.  He is my sculptor and I am his creation, so when his fist tangles in my hair and pulls me upright, I bend gladly.
Harry lifted his hips and tucked himself back into his trunks, squinting to watch Draco wipe his hand off on Harry’s towel.  With a bone-deep sigh, Harry sank back down into the chair, sun hot against his skin.
The dishes were all… powdery, and Harry wasn’t sure if that was right, but he was desperate for something to keep his hands occupied.
“I warned you it was an ambitious selection.”  She smiled, winding a segment of the soft golden ropes around each of his wrists and knotted each side.
It was simultaneously embarrassing and fortifying what Draco’s presence had done.  Harry had still been on edge from fighting with Ron when Draco came through the Floo and laid himself on top of Harry like a human duvet.  But damned if it wasn’t exactly what he didn’t know he wanted.  Somehow confining and liberating at the same time.  Like a shelter of flesh and whispered affections.
Harry chuffs a laugh and reaches behind Draco’s neck with both hands. “You went back for more Disney films, didn’t you? Let me tie it on and dab it with resin.”
Jensen puts his fork down to scratch at his soulmate mark, then resumes eating. It’s not love, Harry thinks. Or probably not. He likes Eric, and respects him, maybe fears him a little. He wants him to be happy, and likes being around him. But that’s not love, he doesn’t think.
Fingers make their way down Harry’s back, leaving a cool, wet trail, then linger at the cleft of his arse. He buries his face in Draco’s jumper and draws a deep breath. “Yeah.”
He blew a deep breath out between pursed lips.  This was why Harry slept on top of the duvet.  Wandering minds lead to wandering hands lead to Azkaban.  With a deep inhale came the faint scents of coffee and chocolate.
The bracing irritation of his double-negative reined in her shock.  He was right.  She had left the UK immediately after taking her NEWTs early.  But she hadn’t heard anything about reunions or parties.  Not that she would have come back for them.  Or maybe she would have, if this were an accurate depiction of a class reunion.
“Yeah.  I just… And I guess it’s not that unusual.  I’ve always been the one to reach out to them,” she started.  “I always arranged time together in Perth.  I made the dinner reservations.  I planned the holidays.  I was literally the one to always call first.”
My throat makes a desperate, keening sound that I can’t stop, and I don’t want it to stop, because it keeps nonsense from coming out of my mouth.
He was dressed for sport.  Grey track pants clung indecently to a muscular backside, and a tattered hoodie hung from broad shoulders.  He balanced lightly on the balls of his feet.  Whether out of grace or habit, it was hard to tell.  His eyes turned to watch Basilia intently.
What he didn’t expect was a glacially-slow line.  Just… offensively slow.  Especially compared to the other gates, where color-coded robes and tidy business suits were entering and exiting freely.
The Bludger, the blunt instrument of a human, took a towel from the rack, unfolded it, and wrapped the blood-streaked fabric around his fist.
Harry crawled over him on hands and knees, and Draco gulped.  Instead of a heated gaze, Harry’s eyes were wary as he hovered over Draco’s face.  He traced long fingers down the other man’s tan cheek.
He held her wrist tight while she glared at him.  “I might occasionally take a hit if I feel I deserve it, Granger.”  He released his grip, and she stepped back.  “But I haven’t done anything.”
Nostalgia lanced through his chest, and he sighed.  “Yeah.  I guess I was.  But that’s not exactly something to brag about here.”
“Ron, you don’t ever have to look at him again, but I’d like to at least try to work something out,” Hermione added, turning in his arms to rest her head on his shoulder.  He was warm and solid and smelled like home.
“It’s okay.”  He sounded more put out than she did.  “This is what we get for loving Purebloods, Harry.”
“She just signed off an international travel ban for Narcissa.  And then it sounded like she sent one for the Wizengamot, as well,” Molly summarized, eyes still on the Harpy feeding frenzy before them.  “So, if any of those Wizengamot members try to take a Portkey to Spain on holiday, they’ll find themselves incarcerated.”
A moving picture of Odbert slamming his fists on a table filled the paper above the fold.  He’d seen the Goblin angry before, but he was bloody terrifying in this image.  His lips pulled back to show sharp teeth glinting a menacing grimace, and his eyes were dark with rage.
Knit it tighter, concentrate the energy.  Make it dense and heavy with magic.  Impenetrable and inexhaustible.
Maybe she should have felt out Harry’s opinion of Malfoy before announcing that bit.  What if Harry knew things Luna and Pansy didn’t?  He was an Auror, Pansy had said.
Harry’s forehead rested against the cold stone of the mantle as his fingers sought out little lumps of powder in his hand, crushing them one by one.  What if the Ministry found out he’d touched Draco?  The other Aurors didn’t seem to know, but what if the Wizengamot or Shacklebolt had been alerted?  Would Draco have to go through a full resentencing trial?  Would Harry be starting a new career?
Harry set his mobile down and made a mental note to tell the Aurors to text less and email more.  So many tedious text messages.  Far more interesting was the argument between Draco and Ron.
It had made for one bumbling, awkward Harry come morning, though.  Before thrice drowning the table, he’d also dropped and stepped on his glasses, smashed his hand while folding the futon, tripped and fell spectacularly during a run of the wards, and nearly blown his hand off unraveling hexed owl messages.
Draco grunted against his upper arm, arms and legs intertwined like a greedy Acromantula.  An especially aggressive hand job had done wonders for Draco’s mood.  Harry set his glasses above them on the ledge and snuggled down into the nest of pillows and limbs.
He shivered, and opted to brave the perilous voyage to the next room.  Shockingly, she let him, but he felt her staring daggers in his back the whole walk.  When he rounded the bookcase, she was standing, braced for combat, hands on hips, in the center of the open space.  A showdown, then.
An anxious gesture, Harry had noticed.  It hadn’t really occurred to him that Malfoy couldn’t consider his future options without taking the twins into account.
“So anyway, Magnus knew him.  Already hated him.  They argued in Russian for a while, and I only caught tidbits but Mag lit Cal’s fucking eyes on fire. Metaphorically.  Legilimantically.  Whatever it was, it was about me,” Draco’s eyes crinkled in a soft smile.  “And then Cal’s nose was suddenly broken and Mag was Healing his own knuckles.  Then we stopped going to parties in St. Petersburg.”
“Robards chipped in some demolitions charms as a housewarming, but I don’t think I was meant to survive using those, either.  Might want to see if you can wean Weasley onto those.”
Malfoy’s eyes were shut, and he was mouthing something again.  His hands had started an elegant, repetitive pattern of weaving and plucking.
“Yeah.” Harry snorts and feels his shoulders relax. “Yeah, he did, and I wish I could say that was the weird part.”
Draco smiled, bottom lip between his teeth.  “You could knit a jumper right now, and I’d come, Harry.”  He sighed and ran hands up Harry’s thighs, gaze lingering on Harry’s hard cock jutting out between them.  “For starters,
Ron emptied his pockets onto the sofa, scattering furniture like an upended dollhouse.  He picked his Crup-handled Blood knife out of the pile and slid it back into his pocket.  “Here.  This is what she got caught with.  It’s quartz, Floo powder, and Peruvian Instant Darkness powder.”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
It’s not so unrealistic, is it? Crups and German shepherds and family barbeques and tamales? London and Lubbock? Eventually, he’d look up what the hell a tamale was and where on Earth Lubbock was.
Draco’s only half-hard, and Harry’s just starting to soften as he pulls out. His soulmate mark burns for a moment, like it does every time they part, and Harry wonders if Eric’s burns every time Harry does this.
It should have looked obscene, he thought.  A floral skirt draped lightly over a hard cock, paired with a ragged sweatshirt.  But on Draco, it was the picture of
Draco nodded absently, not really seeing the dark Floo in front of him.  He pulled the collar of the sweatshirt up over his nose and breathed deeply.
With a lurch, the green flames died down, and the brick of the Burrow fireplace came into focus.  Minding his head, Ron stepped out and turned around.
The words blazed through his mind as Falk’s fingers skimmed lightly up and down Harry’s spine, out of view of the women.
Harry’s attention turned back to the gorgeous offering in front of him.  He sighed, glad he’d left the scene in the restroom tonight.  This was so much better.
“A hushed awe, Auror mine.”  His teeth had found his cuticles.  An old habit to keep the screaming in his head contained.  Breathe in over knuckles, exhale over fine hairs.  Feel how they move in the wind.  Again.
His hard length pressed against her backside, his arm around her waist and hand between her legs pinning her to him.
Grey eyes regard him for an uncomfortable stretch of time, and Harry’s cock hanging between his legs becomes a distraction.  His fingers wrap around it with an introductory squeeze that makes his eyelids flutter.
Flannel pajama pants on the red velvet of the sofa were never the best combination for getting comfortable, and he half-wished he’d have put a shirt on.  The fire crackling to life in the fireplace would warm the room up soon, though.
The fox huffs an indignant breath across Harry’s knuckle and… lets go. Harry’s arse hits the edge of the pot behind him, and Draco’s teeth gleam as he laughs a triumphant bark. Harry’s arm pinwheels back to catch his fall, hits a branch, and a splintering crack fills his ears.
Mafia Movie Voice: Sometimes, ya know, ya gotta blow up a bathroom a little. And then sometimes ya gotta hold a guy down and blow him, too. If ya know what I’m sayin’.
Approaching the north edge of the ward, he withdrew his knife and examined the small blade in the peach glow of the rising sun.  That he’d held onto it through the war, escape, and Azkaban still amazed him.  Nobody had thought to look for a weapon embedded in the flesh under his Mark.  Their mistake.
Harry nodded and shoveled in a second mouthful of the scarlet curry.  Draco waited for him to explode in capsaicin-induced pyrotechnics, but he calmly arranged a third spoonful.
Harry ran his wand down the owl, and finding nothing, moved on to the small note.  His detection spell lit up a fireworks display of sickly yellow and angry red slashes and swirls.
Potter currently looked like he’d swallowed a pufferfish backwards.  Best to ignore him till he got his shit together.  Potter was likely to lash out, and Merlin knew Weasley wouldn’t rein him in a second time.  Never did.
He’d probably bought that person a ring that fit them perfectly and never said a word about his own being too tight. He seemed the type.
Shacklebolt threw a doozie of a Muffliato over the Wizengamot members, and retook the podium.  He hastily cast an amplifying spell on his gavel and slammed it against the disk on the podium.  The resulting crack resounded down to Harry’s bones and he shuddered.  Malfoy was stock-still.  Shacklebolt examined his now-cracked gavel with disapproval.
Harry sighs and pulls Draco’s arm tighter around his waist. Draco stirs behind him, nuzzles into Harry’s curls, and stills. Harry’s hand slides along Draco’s arm, then over his own chest. He rubs over the barely-there hair on Draco’s arm, then down over his own coarse chest hair.
Draco let out a surprised yip as a fork zipped out of his hand and embedded itself in the wall to the side, tines-first.  A soft hum filled the room as the fork handle quivered.
Draco nodded and sighed.  “I got two miserably sober days in Mag’s bed before they breezed in and demanded sanctuary.  Look, Harry.  Nothing about my relationship with Magnus was ever, or will ever, be normal.
Draco’s shoulder was smooth and hot under his hand, and he fought the impulse to slide his fingers up into platinum hair and drag him forward into a smoldering kiss.  Maybe his control wasn’t as good as he’d hoped.
With a stumble, Draco stepped out of the Gringotts lobby Floo.  Not eager to draw notice from the witches and wizards going about their business, he drew up his cloak hood.  He forced his feet to move faster than his gut commanded, and shuffled into a side hall to rap on an office door.
“I’ll come straight back here as soon as they’re safely on the train.” Draco hesitates. “Are you sure you’ll be okay alone?”
Harry is slightly taken aback by James’ choice of words but can’t help being amused at Draco’s gasp. He’d warned his fiancé that his kids were incredibly blunt about sex, and James had certainly driven that point home.
Agonisingly slowly, Harry is being filled. He closes his eyes and gives himself over to the fantasy from his dreams.
“I’ve only been fingered by someone else. I enjoyed it. I finger myself and use toys. I find it very enjoyable. I’d love to have you do either to me.”
“No, it hasn’t. It’s always been pretty high.” Harry’s been told, repeatedly, that he has abnormally high magic levels. “There are records with the Ministry Healers from when I was an Auror.”
“Yes. I’ve been trying to make myself eat more, but sometimes it just doesn’t stay put.” Harry makes a face. The amount of vomiting he has been doing is both astounding and disgusting. He’s even been retching when the anti-nausea potions should be helping.
“Why not?” Harry asks, concernedly. He hates that anything prevents Hermione from being fulfilled and happy, but, just like him, she’s faced some serious hurdles in life.
Lily extends her hand and Harry places it low on the small swell of his abdomen. “Okay, press down lightly.” He feels her push softly.
“Yes, Draco. I’m so close. I’m so close,” Harry pants, his body strung as tight as a cord. Harry chants, “Oh Merlin, oh Merlin, oh Merlin,” like a prayer.
“It was kind of embarrassing at first, but now it’s nice to be able to talk about it and not have to guess what he’s thinking.”
Draco obliges and, as he steps around the door, Harry sees what he’s holding. Draco offers three roses to Harry; one orange, one lavender, and one white, tied together with a simple silver bow.
Harry watches as Draco strips off his clothes and joins him in the bed. He snuggles into Draco’s side as an arm comes around him.
“I’ve put lubrication gel on two fingers of my gloved hand—” she lifts them to show James. “—and I’ve cast a relaxing charm to make it more comfortable. I’ll slide my fingers in with the pads of my fingers facing up.”
Once in the bedroom, Harry turns to Draco and smiles ruefully. “I feel ridiculous. I want you here, but I’m so nervous. And I don’t even know why.”
“When a wizard goes into labour, we would use imaging like that to place hands on the outside of the abdomen if the baby were to get stuck or to need help breaching the membrane opening of the canal.”
“Are you quite comfortable?” Draco teases, finishing his apple. His lips are damp with the juice, and Harry would very much enjoy kissing it off.
“We’re studying multiple series of imaging of patients who eventually haemorrhaged from their core for unknown reasons. It’s a lot like what happened to Gin. It’s a huge age range, from kids to adults, but once I got past that first series that had me so frustrated on Monday, I started seeing a lot of patterns.” Harry closes the drawer he’s been working on and opens the next. “I’ve been able to untangle almost all of the benign and benevolent magic so the malevolent can be sent to the Curse-Breakers. I might actually get sent over to Curse-Breaking for a few days towards the end of the week, so we can try to break some of the nastier stuff.”
Matthew is waiting for them just outside The Spotted Owl and Harry sees his face light up when he spots James. Harry’s heart warms seeing his son and his boyfriend so happy. He knows it could end in heartbreak, as so many teenage romances do, but having grown up in such a homophobic household, Harry is thankful he’s raised his son to know that his sexuality isn’t shameful.
He didn’t regret his late-night confession.  Not at all, which surprised him a bit.  The surety of the dream lended him a certain invincibility.  Silver nitrate of the heart.  A cathartic debridement of the soul.
“Nah,” he groaned, hoisting himself up.  “You really shouldn’t be Apparating into a Muggle building in the middle of the night.  And it’s kind of a leap from Cardiff to Wheeze’s in the morning, what with you not having a Floo.”
With a sigh, she slid a key under the fold of the paper, making a ragged incision across the top.  There looked to be a single piece of  ivory paper inside.  The edges were thin, the pulp having been spread by hand.  Unfortunately, there was no sliding it out of the envelope without destroying it.
The reporter lets out a mortified shriek and claps his hands over his half-exposed groin, but not fast enough for Harry to notice he’s not wearing underwear beneath his trousers. On the floor, the fox has his teeth dug into the man’s trouser cuff, and is attempting to drag the reporter down the hall.
“Yeah, I’m gonna Floo into the Atrium and-“  Ron’s hand brushed the pouch of AstraNox in his pocket, along with the shrunken furniture and trunks.  “Shit.”
“So” Ron drawled, frowning with the beginnings of frustration.  “You dream about other people’s kids?  Like a Naming Seer?”
Harry slides it across the table, fingers lingering over the innocent little piece of metal. Draco grins so wide that his lipstick rubs off on his teeth. His hand rises from his under the table and slides an ornate golden key next to Harry’s.
Draco smiled tightly, hips rocking in a gentle sway over Harry’s thighs. His face went slack as his hips drove forward and thrust, hot streaks arcing down across Harry’s cock and hips.
“You fucking Purebloods and your fucking dynasties and your scheming and-“ Articulation failed her and she screamed, wordless.
The cell block guards would escort them in and hand them off to these two men.  All of them bristled with an assortment of magical weaponry.  They had a few new toys on their belts, he noticed.  Ones he hadn’t tasted during his stay.  Superb.
Aware of her flowers wilting, she listened as he told her about combining blasting and space extension charms to add entire subterranean floors to the shop.  Her mind had trouble wrapping around what he was describing.
Harry dried his hands off on his trousers and adjusted his glasses. What had happened that would make him stop visiting his parents?  If Draco didn’t volunteer the information, he didn’t really feel comfortable asking.
The man’s vacant, dazed expression melted into soft horror that made Draco want to wrestle his question out of the air and put it on a leash. Husband? He’d presumed too much.
for mistaken instrumental interludes, Blood Magic curses for imperfect table manners, isolation in his rooms for underdressing for dinner.  It was a wonder the man was a functional member of society.  Or… a mostly-functional shut-in, as it were.
“Well, we got your package, you know,” Pitchlynn continued, though Ron shook his head.  He hadn’t known what happened to the package.  “And I was just kinda curious why you sent us Horned Serpent parts like you did.”
A drink appears at Harry’s elbow, something unnaturally blue, and he looks around to identify the sender, but nobody catches his eye. He hadn’t planned on drinking, but it tastes like white Airheads taffy. “So, what are you two celebrating?”
“Orientation” was one of her least favorite words, but especially in an academic setting.  Four hours of slowly being told information she could read in twenty minutes was little more than torture.  And especially when these jeans felt so
Ron turned back to his desk and list of smoldering fires.  With a now-clearer head, none of the issues seemed huge.  Most of them looked rather dull, actually.
