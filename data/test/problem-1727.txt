“Er, yeah. Close one, but yes,” Harry said, heart sinking at Draco’s hopeful tone. He wondered if Draco had wanted Robards to fire him. “Listen, I’m really sorry. It was an accident, honestly. If it’s any consolation, I’m supposed to scrub your lab down by hand now.”
, judging by the smell. Every shelf, hinge, and tile was coated in the drying blue potion. It stuck in clumps to the ceiling and had pooled across the floor. Harry couldn’t even recognize the color of the walls.
Draco was about to nod and take off when a familiar yet unexpected sound cut through the air. Voices quieted slightly as people glanced in the direction of the disturbance before moving aside and continuing with their shopping.
And Malfoy really was fit. Cute. Beautiful. Whatever.
,” Harry continued over him with a wide grin, “says shite about it they can shove it straight up their arse, because I did not defeat the Darkest wizard of the age just to have Hogwarts’ finest tell me ‘no’.”
Harry sputtered. “Well, don’t you have anything to say about it? A book to follow? Some brilliant explanation for why I keep cocking up the simplest shite on earth?”
“Just take it.”
“Irresponsible! Reckless endangerment! A violation of laboratory rules! If I hadn’t seen you fly myself I’d assume you catch snitches with magnets, you sausage-fingered muppet!” Robards paused for breath, mustache quivering and what looked to be several droplets of spittle stuck in his beard. “You’ll be cleaning that lab up by hand, and if Malfoy’s gracious enough to kick you in the arse while you do it, call me so I can watch!”
Draco nodded mutely.
Harry knew wine came in reds, whites, and pinks, and that if it had a
“It was his office we were in,” Ron explained. “I didn’t notice, and I guess you didn’t either. The parchment, it was personalized.”
“That’s phoenix sapphire,” he answered. “The gems are inlayed into the chain to always touch the skin. It’s named for the traits of a phoenix— healing, rejuvenation, protection from harm, purity, so on and so forth.”
interested. Which is utterly implausible. He pulls back to look Harry squarely in the eyes.
“Father said she was better this morning,” Draco frowned. “Are you sure you’ll both be alright...?”
“Mandalorian, right?” Draco says. There’s just a hint of insecurity in his tone, and it’s fucking adorable honestly. He’s such a dork. Harry’s absolutely lucked out. “How many episodes do you want to watch?”
“Is your name Harry or Riven?”
Draco slowly raised a hand to run his fingers over those still-damp lips.
Harry opened his mouth, but wasn’t sure how to respond. This sounded like flirting—proper flirting, not whatever he’d done by blowing up Draco’s corner of the Ministry. But after the way he’d reacted to Harry’s shoe innuendo, Harry was fairly certain Draco was not a fan of crass banter. Which meant he intended it in a more literal way—he really was just looking forward to seeing Harry gunk himself up in potion remains for the next couple hours.
Draco kissed him. He pulled back almost instantly to apologize, but Harry swept him around and crowded him against the railing before leaning back in to open his mouth with his tongue.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron, the petty bastard, threw up a quick privacy charm around his section of the desk. He would have dismantled the wards, but when he raised his wand, his inkpot started hovering threateningly, tilting to aim for his head. Harry sighed and stood. There was nothing for it. He could do this.
“Well, he’s not
There’s a moment when Potter lets go of one of his hands to pluck off his glasses and slip them into the pocket of his robes. His eyes look soft without them. Draco almost makes the mistake of asking how he plans to wander around in the dark, when it occurs to him what glasses might be removed for.
“Soap, water, and a rag, to start,” Harry said.
But Harry looks absolutely thrilled. He’s grinning and bouncing on the tips of his toes now. “Is that the new Star Wars one? I haven’t seen it yet, is it any good? Where can you watch it?”
“For real?” Harry’s grinning. Why’s he grinning? “I played six hours of Animal Crossing yesterday! Have you got that?”
The Eighth Years were gathered in the Common Room for their weekly round of Muggles party games— renamed from the Peace-building Inter-house Socializing Socials. The event was organized mostly by Hermione (ergo the acronym) and a surprisingly willing Neville, but the other students had quickly caught on to the idea.
It was barely noticeable, but Harry caught the muscle that jumped in Draco's jaw and the way his hands twitched on the edges of the blanket.
“Potter,” Draco was laughing for real now. “Stop. We’re not doing that, people will—”
“Erm, Malfoy?” Granger sounded unsure. “I hope you’re not headed to the library, are you?”
At the moment, Draco is opening his door after getting his mail downstairs, so he doesn’t think to glance behind him until a cheerful voice calls—
“That’s my wand.” There was an uncomfortable lump in his throat. His eyes burned. Wordlessly, Harry plucked it from the box and took his hand, pressing the familiar wood into his palm.
“No price,” he answered. Pansy tisked but knew better than to argue.
He’s so absorbed in not being miserable, and so miserable regardless, that he doesn’t hear the footsteps until they’re echoing on the wooden bridge. Draco assumes it’s an equally melancholy party-goer, and stays where he is so they can pass. But there’s a dull tugging deep in his chest, and the footsteps pause before a familiar figure leans against the railing beside him.
When they finally part for real it takes them a few tries. Draco settles for resting their heads together, close enough that Harry is free to continue dipping in and pressing short kisses against Draco’s lips that set his heart fluttering.
Draco stayed quiet. A setup, then. Had Potter been treating him kindly all term just to torment him now, or was his plan deeper than that? For a second Draco entertained the wild idea that’d they’d lured him here for Potter to push him off. Maybe he deserved that. It would certainly be a poetic end. Let the punishment fit the crime and all that rot.
Harry almost choked on his laugh. “I think it’s so homeless people don’t sleep under the awning,” he said seriously after a moment. He watched the way Malfoy’s brows furrowed and his lips puckered into a frown.
Riven stood and crossed the room to the armoire, flipping the doors open and pulling a fur cloak out. He swept it around his shoulders and pulled up the hood before coming to stand in front of Draco again. Draco watched with growing confusion as Riven lifted some of the fur to cover his face, the dark hair taking the place of a short beard and the shadows of the hood warping his eyes into familiar shapes. The green flashed at him even in the relative dark.
“Do you think,” Harry finally gasped, “we should—should still go to the—” he gave up when Draco took his lip between his teeth, content to press him up harder against the wall and rock their hips together. Draco moaned at the contact, and Harry took the opportunity to kiss the soft skin of his neck.
“What arrangement?” Potter says, bewildered. “Draco, I—I really don’t do one-night stands.”
“That would be acceptable.”
That’s a no, then. Harry pushes himself up on one elbow so he can see Draco’s face. There’s a furrow between his fine brows, his cheek smushed against the pillow. It muffles his voice.
“What?” he finally asked when he noticed Harry’s stare. “Have I still got sparkles on?”
“Dagnabbit, he’s taken my currants, the filthy cur! May he be cursed until his dyin’… breath,” Draco sighs the last word like it takes a monumental effort, and it would sound a lot more threatening if he didn’t spit it in an American Southern drawl. As it is, Harry nearly bites through his lip trying not to laugh.
“Er, coffee table? Or behind the TV. Check the mantle if it isn’t there.” Draco laughs and goes to dig for it. Harry leaves him to it and goes to get napkins, because the cookies are indeed amazing but also crumbly as hell. “Do you want anything to drink?” He calls from the kitchen as an afterthought.
And there it was. Harry. At the center of his dreams, his heart, his mind. Harry was gone, but in leaving he’d taken more of Draco with him and left more of himself behind than should have been possible. But he was gone now. Draco had every right to— needed to, in fact— move on. He wanted this. He wanted to move on. More and more often Riven was the first thought on his mind and not the second.
“Him.” It slips out without Draco’s permission, an instinctual request from deep in his heart. He presses his lips together, eyes fixed on the bushes in front of him. Pansy doesn’t reply. She knows he can’t take it back. It’s true.
“Sometimes,” Malfoy says cryptically. Harry’s not having the greatest time puzzling out his strange behavior and responses— they leave him floundering for something else to say.
Harry wrinkled his nose at the obvious whiff of firewhiskey. He opened his mouth to beg Ron to show some self-control, to spare his dignity if nothing else, when Ron’s face split into a wicked grin.
“Can I take you to dinner?” Harry asks. He’s not sure where to go from here, but he knows he’d love to have dinner with Malfoy, so it seems like a good place to start.
“I have done no such thing,” Draco sputtered indignantly. He had definitely done such a thing.
“Is someone after your currants?” Harry can’t help asking. He tries to stifle his laugh at the idea of Draco dreaming about the former Minister of Magic threatening his (evidently) valuable fruit. It appears the currants are momentarily safe, however, because Draco sighs happily and resumes mumbling. Harry watches for a few minutes, but there doesn’t seem to be any immediate change in sight and he’s reluctant to wake Draco up just to get some quiet. He finally lays down behind him once again, wrapping an arm around his waist to pull him closer.
“Well, you’ve already smothered my cat, I suppose. I mean we could just…”
“Not with that attitude I don’t.” Harry laughed and earned himself a pinch for his troubles. “Don’t act like you did something grand, you clearly want to date me too.”
Preferably something not like that.
“I’ve only— I was just asking, just curious,” Harry tugged at a fraying string on the edge of his hood a bit, a nervous habit Draco had noticed some weeks before.
“The bond’s acting up,” he says shortly by way of explanation. Pansy sets her glass down on a nearby table and wordlessly takes his hand. Draco lets her lead him away.
“I’m going to shove currants so far up your arse, you’ll be shitting berries for months,” Harry shoots back.
“Thank you, but I can’t accept that, Draco. I couldn't bed someone just to heal myself.”
“Tonight?”
“Ask and you shall receive,” Pansy said. “The most public would have been Slughorn’s desk during lunch.”
“It’s only eggnog,” Ron cut in, tilting his glass towards them to show off his drink.
, and Harry wants him. The way he kisses Draco, the way he delves into Draco’s mouth, that’s for him. It’s on that edge between too much and far, far too little, and Draco’s overwhelmed and wanting, unable to get close enough.
“Creevey.”
Harry sputters. He points a threatening finger at Malfoy’s patrician nose and shakes it a bit, but he’s really not sure what to say. All he knows is he’s done with the emotional whiplash of these nonsensical replies.
. When he straightened again, there was a smirk playing around the corners of Draco’s sharp mouth. Harry tried not to lick his own lips. He felt a bit too ashamed to indulge in any appreciation of Draco’s form.
That hurts. To think that he’s not even good enough for that. He desperately wishes Potter would leave. There’s nothing he can possibly want from Draco, unless it’s to humiliate him, and even Potter isn’t that cruel.
Savage whistled lowly and Draco’s cheeks turned a darker shade of red. Harry made a note to taste the eggnog and see just how much Ron had spiked it—he’d never seen Draco blush quite like that.
“He’s consulting,” Ron explains slowly, “for the Finley case?” Then, when Harry only stares back blankly— “Harry. Can you even read?”
“Malfoy,” Harry repeats to himself quietly, just to feel the familiar shape in his mouth. It’s lacking the venom and suspicion it should have on principle.
They wisely decide to shut up. There’s a used staple on the corner of Harry’s desk, and he reaches over to fiddle with it just for something to do.
Draco’s eyes were locked with his as Harry lifted the side of his own shirt. He could see the exact moment when confusion turned to shock and understanding. For a brief second, he swore Draco’s eyes lit up with— impossible, but how Harry wished— hope, but then his face twisted into something ugly.
for once— then maybe, everything wouldn’t feel so… out of control.”
“Pea,” Draco blurts from his position on the floor. He quickly gathers the papers around him and shoves them out of sight into his apartment before standing.
He couldn't recall the walk up the stairs and down the corridor. All too fast his hand was on the smooth wood of the door to his and Draco’s room, and then he was pushing it shut behind him as he stepped quietly up to Draco’s bed. The drapes were closed tight and Harry knew he’d find Draco pretending to be asleep before he even pulled them open.
“I’m trying,” he whispered. “But I’m afraid I can’t love you the way you want me to. I’m sorry.”
“—and not knock over any more trees,” Ron said sagely—
“I’m not harassing him.”
“Oh,” Draco frowned. “So I shouldn’t...?”
“Happy Holidays, Weasley, Savage,” he said. “And Po—Harry.” The slightest hint of color appeared on Draco’s cheeks. Harry wondered if he might have been drinking too.
“I’m fine, nothing’s wrong!” Harry blurts out. He’s red, and he squeezes Draco’s hands briefly. Draco waits once again.
“Oh, no, should it have gone closer to the middle?” Malfoy looks suitably concerned as he leans forward, but his words aren’t making an awful lot of sense. “I wanted it to be a font-and-center spread, but Pansy thought it would look nice near the beginning.”
“Do you know what day it is?” Potter asked.
,” he groaned.
“You’re so infuriating,” Harry murmured. “I wish you knew.”
Harry finally looks around before turning back to Draco. “I can see why. It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.”
But Hot Neighbor is already holding his own phone with an expectant face, and doesn’t seem to be aware of the jumble of embarrassment that is currently Harry Potter, so he lists off his number with only the slightest stumble.
Riven liked him.
“I don’t like things that aren’t solid,” Draco finally admitted. Harry gave him the time to gather himself and go on, although it felt like he was about to shake loose from the inside out just from that one statement. “I don’t like ifs. Everything’s always about ‘if’. If this, if that— it’s stupid and I’m up to here with it all.”
“Er, it’s on Disney, I think,” Draco says carefully.
Draco pulled his hand back and whipped it across his cheek.
“No, I do. I really do. But if there aren’t any ‘if’s, then things are decided for you, aren’t they? That’s shittier, in my opinion. I’d rather have life be one large ‘if’. Then you can make all your own choices.”
Everything he wanted was hanging before his eyes. The threads were about to snap, or weave into something beautiful.
Malfoy huffs, but his ears are pink. “Funny way of showing it, storming in here, colors blazing.”
Harry, who at this point was firmly pinned as the doors dragged his jacket higher and higher up the wall, tried to do so. His cuffs, however, remained buttoned, and refused to let him slip away.
“What?” Draco glances back at him.
“Alright that’s enough!” Draco cut them both off with a venomous glare. “I don’t sound like that. And you’re late, Pans.”
Harry hid his smile in Draco’s hair. “You want to date me,” he teased.
“This is my favorite part of the gardens,” Draco admits. He waits for Harry to make fun of him, to joke or to look surprised, to nod and tell him he agrees, but all he says is—
“Fancy seeing you here, Malfoy,” he said. Harry straightened and spun around, running a quick hand through his hair and over his beard. In the brief moments they’d been talking to Savage, he’d lost sight of Draco amongst the milling Aurors. He’d somehow managed to migrate over to their corner of the room, and was nodding stiffly to Ron.
“And then I told you I’d rather have him over you,” Draco said hollowly. Riven winced.
“There’s no match in the records,” Draco spoke over her. “It's not that difficult to search. No one’s registered with the same mark.”
“I can't say I know what you—”
“I see.” Draco spun the ring between his fingers mindlessly. His cheeks were burning as he stared at the ground. He felt utterly humiliated, and couldn’t shake the sick feeling that he’d done something irreparable.
“What? Really?” Harry spun in his chair, catching sight of Draco’s long legs disappearing around the corner. For once, he’d been preoccupied enough that he hadn’t noticed him leave Savage’s desk. “Where’s he going?”
“What’s that got— oh, right!” He pulls out his wand and summons the ring from where it’s been lying innocently in the grass. The moment starts to feel serious once again, enough to be ever so slightly frightening.
He could feel Harry’s heartbeat against his chest, and he never wanted to let go. He could have kissed him forever like this, tangled together and drunk on happiness.
“But made for the wrong reasons.” The words stung.
Harry didn’t bother replying to them. He kept his head face-down in the middle of his place-setting, right between the knife and fork. He felt quite a bit like the overboiled stew Hermione was serving tonight. Might as well act the part.
“You just need to be a bit more subtle,” Hermione said. “Draco is a Slytherin. He appreciates the things left unsaid, the meaningful gestures. And crass flirting will get you nowhere—Dennis tries it every time Draco comes to our floor.”
, it’s his neighbor, the hot one across the hall whose name he’s never gotten because Harry’s mouth turns to cotton every time he sees him “—it goes. Yeah, er, just clumsy.”
“Oh,” was all he could think to say. “That’s that, then.”
It’s Harry’s turn to deploy the Look. Malfoy frowns at him like he doesn't get it, but Harry’s not really in the mood for deduction.
“Lay it on me,” Ron said. Harry rolled his eyes, if a bit sadly.
So Harry did.
“My shoes aren’t normally untied in the field,” he said with a cough.
“Yes,” he yes. “Yes, of course.” He choked out a laugh. Harry looked awestruck, unbelieving, a reflection of everything Draco could feel coursing through his body. Harry was still looking at him like he was the world, and Draco was none too happy about the distance between them.
“You think so?” Draco was slowly smiling, the anxious pinch of his face easing.
There was a pause.
“Hm?”
“Er, yes.” Harry bit his lip, suddenly unsure. “I’m taking cues from the jacket thing here.”
“It wouldn’t— it doesn’t have to be just for that,” Draco mumbled quietly. “I want— even if you weren’t sick, I would want to... I’d want you.” He swallowed and looked up to meet Harry’s widened eyes. “I want you.”
Draco pursed his lips. He was overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events, the unwavering dedication and excitement in Harry’s eyes. But whether that was a bad feeling or a good one remained to be seen.
“We must not have touched,” Draco replied softly. “I thought we had.”
“Christ, I’ve tried,” the bloke’s eyes go wide. “Sainsbury’s was completely cleared out. Have you been lately?”
“Oh. Well you’re going in the middle of the day, it should hopefully be restocked.”
“You never talk about them,” Dean shrugged. “Just curious. Have you found them yet?”
“That’s lovely, Harry,” Hermione said. “Very thoughtful. Give it a few days so he’s not too focused on the, ah—”
“You heard Hermione,” Pansy leaned forward, sounding as earnest as he’d ever heard her. “Go talk to him.”
“Oh Jesus Christ, thank fuck!” Malfoy said suddenly. “It’s the bus!”
“It’s—” Harry stared at that small patch of exposed skin. “I'm not sure, but—”
“Yes, yes of course,” Riven almost laughed. “Please do— think about it, take as long as you need.”
Harry tries not to let his dismay show on his face. “We have to work through lunch?” he asks. It sounds pathetic even to his own ears.
Ron took a couple more seconds to stare, before he sighed in a way that let Harry know whatever was coming next was Draco-related.
“Alright. Do you need anything?”
Draco took another shuddering breath, looking up at the curtains and trying to muster the will stay silent. He couldn't deny that he wanted to seek comfort from his friend.
“Aren’t we sentimental today?” Harry mused. “Would you have missed me?”
“And you’re taking them remarkably well,” Draco said. He shifted a bit and Harry felt the cold point of his nose on his neck just above his collar. “I suppose dinner would be an acceptable place to start.”
“Oh,” Potter says. “Alright. That’s good.” Draco waits for the addition. “Why, er, why
He dreamt of Harry again. When he woke up suddenly enough to know he had cried out, Draco cursed himself. The bed under him was unfamiliarly soft, the sheets silk, and he would have lain in a barn if it meant his wanderer was laying beside him.
“Yes?” Potter quirks an eyebrow at him. “I think? If you mean the part where I date you, then yes, very. And the pun, only if you liked it. I’ve got more. Which I’m saving for the first date, assuming we have one.”
It wasn’t unheard of for King James and his wife to ride through the Hollow. Their castle was only a few miles to the east and their frequent presence in the city had absolved them of most of their infamy. Their son Riven, however, was more myth than celebrity. The prince was said to never leave the castle during the day, and was rarely seen by servants outside of his rooms.
Harry is
Puzzlingly, Potter’s friends had been the only ones treating him decently since his trial. Besides that, he would never forget the sound of Granger’s screams.
That’s not entirely correct when one gets down to the facts. Draco Malfoy has blond hair— a light, airy blond, the color of sunlight on snow. Harry Potter knows this because he’s spent many an adolescent winter watching Malfoy walk the grounds of a frozen Hogwarts and noticing it. The fact that he’s observed Malfoy that carefully is neither here nor there, although Ron would say it’s
Draco, for all his currant-related madness, smiles a happy little smirk and snuggles into his pillow again. Harry eyes him in resigned defeat. Bested by berries at last.
“Harry,” he said, “I’ve got to tell you something. It should probably wait until after work, but you’ll hear about it any minute anyway.”
“What are you on about?”
“Potter?” Blaise said. “Care to elaborate on that?”
“I have.”
“I’ll see you then,” is what he said instead.
got your tongue?” he asks.
“You cleaned. It smells like you’ve vacuumed in here.”
With that, he set the flowers gently on the step at Draco’s feet and turned to mount his horse. He was gone as quickly as he’d come.
,” Robards thundered from the safety of his chair, “I’d have you out on the street faster than you can say ‘larceny’!”
Draco paused, still running a fingertip over the furl of a rosebud. “I don’t think it matters,” he said, “seeing as he would not have been there either.”
“No,” Riven said calmly. “I didn’t come for business purposes.”
Unlike the many celebratory balls held in May, the gala tonight was not mandatory. Harry had already been planning to go (he was under threat from Hermione), but he hadn’t bothered with new dress robes. He did, however, hang his old ones up before he left for work, shooting a quick ironing charm at them. He didn’t usually believe in superstition, but he felt compelled to make an effort if he wanted any chance of Draco going out with him.
“—as consort king, yes. And as my lover. I’m certain you could grow to share my passion if only you allowed me to prove myself to you.”
“Fuck, yeah, ok.” Harry grinned. This felt like a moment from their school days, spontaneous and most likely disastrous. But he felt high on enthusiasm and hope, giddy with his feelings and more than ready to do something about them.
Not just glowing— lighting up. Faintly, like a soft pearlescent shimmer across the milky white, but still stark against the darkness of the carpet. Little whorls of light followed the path Harry’s hand had taken, spiraling in spotted patterns over Draco’s side, looping once around his navel and dipping teasingly under the edge of his shirt.
“Are you going to tell me what’s in that fancy file or do I have to read it?” Harry finally asks, jerking his chin towards the papers tucked under Malfoy’s arm. He sincerely hopes Malfoy will volunteer to summarize for him. It’s because Harry’s glasses are giving him a headache and not at all because he likes the sound of Malfoy’s voice.
“Even if we’re an ‘if’,” Harry began when he felt like he could talk around his smile. “Even if you
Except then the typing bubble pops up. And disappears. And pops up again. Hovers.
“I’m just fucking with you,” Harry says over a smile. “Let’s go.”
“Of what horrid illness?”
“I know you’re smelling my hair,” he said, and Harry could hear the smile in his voice.
“Nothing! You know nothing! As clearly demonstrated by your pigheadedness!”
It didn’t help that Harry liked to wander around dusk or sunset, the opportune moment for a romantic rendezvous and hidden kisses down dark alleys. He hadn’t seen Harry in almost a week, however, and it made him a bit anxious.
The prince considered his words for a long moment. “Is this your answer?” Riven said finally.
“Of course,” Harry smiles and turns back to his apartment, giving Draco and Pea a little wave as he goes. He hesitates briefly at the door. “Hey, I don’t know about you, but I’m kind of ridiculously bored right now. What have you been up to for three weeks?”
“Yeah,” Harry frowns. “No? I thought we were on that page.”
He’d known Potter would be here. It’s one of the reasons Draco hasn’t left his house since that night: Potter is everywhere, inside and out. Draco knows Pansy feels bad for making him come tonight, but he wouldn’t have let her go alone anyway, not with how heavy she’s getting. That’s his only spark of joy at the moment—he can’t imagine a child more lovely than Blaise and Pansy’s.
“I thought you were indifferent to me,” he repeated. “I’m the fool. I’m so sorry.”
“Hello.” Draco sent him a weak smile from where he was sitting on the window seat. “Isn’t it bad luck for the grooms to see one another before the wedding?”
,” Draco repeated. He hoped he wouldn’t be imprisoned for this.
Draco doesn’t have any opinion on the matter, but that’s mostly because he’s never been able to believe it would actually happen. When they started seeing one another he never thought they would last— Harry would get bored, Harry would get to know him and realize he didn’t like what he saw, Harry would grow frustrated, Harry wouldn’t be able to deal with his idiosyncrasies, Harry, Harry Harry. There were so many insecurities, so many predictions. Draco remembers lying awake at night agonizing over them for weeks before he came to the final conclusion that it was all too much. Not Harry— never Harry— but the pointless worrying over where they were going, where they’d end up, how they figured into one another’s future— that was completely unnecessary and overall a pile of rubbish. There were too many possibilities. The only thing Draco could do was let them all go, the bad
“Yes,” Malfoy says quickly. “We do. But we could try staples from the supply closet.”
The next second, however, he felt his stomach drop with a surge of anxious anticipation as Potter stepped closer. He was close enough to touch, biting his lip and twisting the hem of his sleeve in one hand, the wind whipping up the scent of his soap.
Harry was smitten. It was an open secret (even if Harry had never told a soul and would deny it to his dying breath), but he was firm on the stance that he'd rather be expelled than do anything about it (and his priorities were sorted there). There was a list of reasons pages long why bringing it up was a bad idea, not the least of which was the marks they both carried. Harry didn’t dare believe the universe would pair them up. Hermione’s and Pansy’s bond had been a strong enough shock, and they didn’t have nearly as much history.
“I— I’m sorry?” Harry sputters.
But in time, maybe he wouldn’t be.
Blaise shook his head. “People are too desperate to leave it up to fate. And Draco and I checked every Ministry list.”
“I’m afraid I’ll mess it up,” Harry confessed. “I can’t even talk around him, Ron. I’d do it, but it’s hard enough worrying he’ll—that he doesn’t feel the same. Trying to manage myself while I’m at it—”
“You— you play Switch?”
“Oh, are you now?” Harry wiggled his eyebrows and Malfoy shoved his shoulder, cheeks turning red.
He still poked Draco in the side for good measure, just to feel him squirm. He settled back down with a huff and Harry found his spot on the page again. Draco’s soft shirt was riding up over his stomach, and Harry unconsciously let his fingers linger over the warm skin, tracing gently. With the heat from the fire on his other side he could just feel the beginnings of sleep tugging at his muscles.
“Haven’t a clue, just asking. Most everyone suspects he’s making a bit of a move on you, that’s all. I don’t see the appeal; he’s rather awkward, and he might make bedroom eyes at you but he always hides under that vile hood so you can’t see them anyway. And you’re— well, you’re you, darling.” Blaise sent him a truly shit-eating grin.
“No, no!” Draco sniffled. “It’s not you, you’ve been perfect. Nothing but wonderful, for all the time I've known you, and this is all my fault, I am so
“You’re still cold, aren’t you?” Harry said. “Do you want my jacket?” He wanted to disappear into his seat as soon as he said it, but Draco was hiding a smile in the folds of his scarf.
They both enjoyed the town but preferred the open air of the forests and meadows. They had a secret sweet tooth Narcissa was very familiar with, and a common disgust for the color pink (Riven was unfairly fond of red, however, the heathen). Draco’s favorite was green, which he went on to describe in embarrassing detail using phrases like “forest streams glimmering with sunlight” and “emerald moulded by ocean spray”. Riven had rolled his eyes to the monologue and simply said his favorite was silver-blue, like storm clouds.
“I must go see them, then,” Riven murmured.
“I have somewhere I need to be,” Harry gave him a hint of a smile. “Take care of your mother. Goodbye.”
He choked on his words at Harry took a step towards him. They’d already been standing close, but that last stride brought Harry’s face dangerously near his own. The warmth of his chest seeped into Draco despite the wind. Dying sunlight glinted off Harry’s glasses as he swallowed.
Riven didn’t kiss him, just leaned their foreheads together and murmured sweet nothings and ardent promises. Draco tried to return them.
“Draco,” Harry says. He swallows once more, and then he reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a black box. The band nestled inside is thin silver when he flicks it open, studded with diamonds and sapphires, and Draco knows it’s not what Harry would have chosen but it’s what Harry knows Draco would want.
Draco barely made it to his room before the tears began. There was nothing to be said for it. He’d been in love with Harry. He still was.
He could say yes. Riven loved him.
hair,” Malfoy admits. He seems to regret saying it, and tries to make up for his embarrassment by adopting a suave position leaning against Harry’s desk. He misses and stumbles slightly before righting himself.
Harry kissed him. They were supposed to be past this by now, but every time he touched Draco he felt as untethered as the first time they kissed. Harry threaded his hands through Draco’s hair, and even the familiar sigh that slipped out between them felt new and exciting, his breath coming faster as the kiss deepened.
As he stood up, however, Harry tapped his shoulder.
Draco’s office was at the other end of Auror Headquarters in the Consultancy Department. There was a neat little lab attached to it, expanded and sustained with charms so as to hold a host of rare ingredients. It reminded Harry of a kitchen—wood counters and painted cabinets, with jars upon jars of herbs stacked on every surface. If he weren’t so sure of Draco’s skill as a potioneer, he’d be worried about cross-contamination.
“Harry doesn’t want in his pants,” Hermione said. Harry felt the table shift as she placed the serving bowl in the center, and then her hand ruffled his hair lightly.
“Good to meet you.”
The royals glanced around briefly, ignoring the stares of interested townspeople, before walking towards their stall with a purpose. Draco remembered his manners when Pansy elbowed him, and quickly followed her in bowing. He didn’t dare look up, but he could see silk skirts and polished black boots moving closer. They stopped.
“Your cat is literally a hot water bottle,” he says in delight. Draco purses his lips and gives Pea a short glare that Harry hopes never to see directed at himself.
“Asking Malfoy out like a normal man instead of acting like a bloody prat, pussyfooting around him for weeks and making a right mess of yourself while you’re at it!”
Draco had forgone his robes once again today in favor of trousers and a grey button up. But even under the pale Ministry lighting, against the faded backdrop, he looked so incredibly light and
A new gust of wind blew in through the open window, and Draco wrapped his hands in Harry’s scarf again.
“Oh, spit it out already,” Hermione glared as she siphoned the excess ink off her parchment. “And next time don’t you dare scream like that, it’s completely—” she froze, her eyes on Draco. “Oh my.”
the one harbouring a pitiful fancy for Harry.
Draco doesn’t watch her go, just listens to the crunch of gravel under her shoes, and when the sound fades he stands. He doesn’t know these grounds—the mansion the Ministry rented is originally Muggle—but he can hear running water, and he decides to just follow the path for now.
spend all night doing just that, alongside trying not to murder his boyfriend in his sleep. It’s not so bad at first— indeed, Harry was just thinking about how soothing Draco’s voice is— but that’s before the thirtieth repetition. Then the sixtieth. It begins to pound away in Harry’s ears, but it it’s a matter of pride now. He refuses to be beaten by a ditty. The currants go on, and on, and
“Yes,” Harry says. “Staples?”
never— be his?
They sit together for long minutes, listening to the music waft into the night. Pansy begins to fidget at some point, no doubt anxious to use the bathroom or to find a more cheerful dance partner. It makes Draco smile a little, even if his eyes are damp.
Riven must have smiled too, because Draco heard it in his voice when he thanked him a thousand times, promised to cherish and love him, and cupped his cheeks gently with gloved hands. Draco breathed out in relief. How fitting that even now there should be something separating them, a block between their intimacy.
“Brewed with water?”
Draco had gotten a wand, his mother, and his life for his birthday that year. He hadn’t dared to bring it up. His father’s trial had been the next day. He’d whispered happy birthday to himself at midnight and that had been that.
“If I don’t see you in half an hour I’m sending a search party,” she says firmly, hitching up her skirt.
Just then, a head of dark hair came weaving through the crowd towards them. Speak of the devil, and his female counterpart shall appear. Something along those lines.
Whatever it is, it ends just as abruptly as it began. Harry strains to catch the sound, but the little murmurs are gone. Draco snuffles into his pillow and Harry tries not to smile; if he does, he’ll never fall asleep again, and he’s got to be up early for work tomorrow. He closes his eyes and settles in against the long line of Draco’s warm back.
Hermione was curled up around Pansy on the rug, her bushy head tucked under her girlfriend's slim chin. Ron, Neville, and Blaise were piled on top of one another. Theo was dating Parvati, a strange but intense relationship if Harry had ever seen one, and he’d noticed Goyle walking the grounds with Luna on more than one occasion. All in all, they’d managed to nurture a tentative peace between Slytherin and the other three houses, if the silencing charms around everyone's rooms were to be trusted.
He would have thought Harry would react to haven his past words thrown in his face but he barely shifted. “You say the prince was here? Riven?”
Harry ground his teeth. He knew he wasn’t the smoothest flirt, perhaps not even a passable one, but level-headed Hermione thrived on fixing problems, and he felt problematic enough at the moment to warrant
“Mine,” he murmurs. Harry melts a little.
“I haven’t been back here since I was six or seven,” he remarks. “It hasn’t changed at all.”
“Don’t give me halfhearted falsities. You look ill. You haven’t been eating, or sleeping from what I hear. Please talk to me, I only want to help. I hate to see you upset.”
“I know you’ve changed,” Harry said firmly. “Malfoy. Look at me.” He did. “I know.” It was important to Harry that he knew— knew Harry appreciated the work he’d done, the time he’d taken to understand the world anew. “I don’t regret the past. Even if I don’t approve of the things we both did to get here, I don’t regret them. But I like knowing those times are over. I like seeing that.”
“I haven’t even asked yet,” Harry tries to laugh, but he’s crying too.
Harry shivered as he stepped into the familiar cafe, shaking out his wet umbrella and leaning it by the door. It was raining again. He wondered vaguely how there was any moisture left in the clouds circling London. Surely there was a desert somewhere in need of their endless deluge.
“But that’ll take until tonight!”
This way may be more permanent, though. Draco bites his cheek and breathes through his nose. He meets his own eyes in the still water and frowns at himself. Then smiles. He looks both beautiful and sad. It occurs to him that he’d make a lovely classical painting, something from the Italian Renaissance, perhaps. Draco revels in that narcissism because it’s all he has. If Potter can’t love him, he’ll certainly love himself.
“Alright,” Harry finally said. “It was only a question. I’m glad you’re doing well, though.”
“I suppose I didn’t have to ask ‘Mione out, really,” he finally said. “That just sort of happened. But I feel like you and Malfoy—don’t take this the wrong way, mate, but I feel like you two have always been a bit of both fire and fuel. It’ll happen, but you’ve got to start it.” Ron looked pensive for a second, something that was both rare and worrying. “Why don’t you owl him? Seems like all your physical plans have been the problem so far. You could invite him out through a letter. That’s straightforward.”
“I think,” Draco muttered as he pushed himself quickly off of Harry’s chest, face flaming, “that we’d better just organize a meeting on Monday, Potter.”
“I love you, too,” Draco said before pulling Harry back in again.
Harry’s not going to wake him. He’s not, really. It’s a petty thing to disturb Draco over, and he has terrible trouble falling asleep after he’s been woken. Harry can be patient and focus on something pleasant, like the feeling of Draco’s silky cheek against his as he turns his head to—
“Auror Potter,” Malfoy purrs. “What brings law enforcement to my reputable establishment?”
“Hello,” he nods back before bending down to get it in as dignified a manner as possible. As he does, however, he forgets the open door behind him and a lump of tufted fur flies between his legs and out into the hall. Draco drops all his envelopes (again) and promptly dives after his demon of a cat, but Pea is already out of his reach. His gut swoops in panic right as Harry leans down and scoops the monster up before it manages to dodge past him and towards the stairwell.
Harry felt thoroughly blindsided by a Malfoy using Muggle slang, but he forced himself to at least
“Excellent! What’s your raunchiest fantasy?”
His family no longer had anything but a spoilt reputation to offer, and any good Pureblood child knew it. It didn’t bother Draco so much. Most of his housemates he’d only kept close for the attached strings. Lucius was rather fond of politics, after all. Draco did miss Greg, but he wouldn’t ask him to sacrifice his fragile social standing for the sake of some company.
“You don’t think it’s a little boring?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes and pulls Harry in across the wide expanse of his desk to kiss him.
“Be that as it may, I won't see it hurt you in the meantime.” Riven studied him carefully. Something in Draco's expression must have been too telling, because he blanched momentarily, before his face closed off. “Is this... if this is about the wedding, if you are having second thoughts—“
“The effects are similar, I presume?”
At the moment, however, Narcissa was bedridden with fever, and Draco had been put in charge of their stall while Lucius took care of her. Even now she insisted she was fine, but one sneeze and her overzealous husband had her in his arms and promptly in bed. It was entertaining to watch, though painfully sappy in Draco’s opinion.
“It’s my birthday in two weeks,” Riven let out in a breath.
The room erupted into catcalls and cheers. Ron looked worryingly green, but Draco was smirking and Hermione’s cheeks were flushed.
It was only when Draco got home and looked in the mirror that it occurred to him Riven had described the grey of his own eyes, and it was only when Draco felt the first tear hit his cheek that he realized he had been describing Harry’s.
Harry himself takes a breath, as if he’s bracing for something, and then he turns to face Draco fully. He takes Draco’s other hand and holds them both between them, clasped tightly in his own. His hands really are sweating now.
“Is that what we’re calling it?” Ron leaned back and crossed his arms, entirely unimpressed. “Oh, Merlin, seems I’ve caught a horrid chill. Wish Hermione would come strap me down and eat my—”
“Am I?”
“Natural talent,” Hermione muttered again.
Harry pokes his head back into the living room to give Draco a disbelieving look. “Wine is crying juice.”
Draco didn’t let himself imagine the worst. Harry had left for long periods of time during his stay at the town (Draco refused to acknowledge the thoughts that whispered it had never been this long). Harry was a traveler, but this had become a makeshift home for him. Surely he would return. Even if he were leaving the town for good, he would say something. He’d have come to Draco, bid him goodbye, if only to argue one last bittersweet time.
Ron frowned. “Er, don’t think so. Smith’s been nosing around though. I think he asked him once or twice, but Malfoy said no.” He turned to Harry quickly, eyes alight with a sudden stroke of inspiration. “Let’s write it tonight! Slip it in his pocket or something, yeah?”
“You— Harry— with the— you, Merlin’s saggy tits, you and—”
“Salazar’s fucking tits,” Draco cursed. Harry felt like that summed it up nicely.
“I— me too,” Draco sighed, his eyes scrunching up as he tried to not grin the way Harry was doing.
The coming weeks followed in a similar miserable pattern. Since his previous subtle observation had long since become a thing of the past, Harry decided to throw himself into his makeshift effort at courtship with everything he had, hoping for some hint at reciprocation. Ron was in a state of despair—he’d erected a reinforced paper wall around his section of the desk in a bid for peace. When Robards came by and saw the towering contraption, he’d nodded solidly and gotten Ron a cup of grainy coffee from the canteen.
“You’re always on him,” Seamus cut in. “There’s no way you haven’t. You’re attached at the bleeding hip.”
Draco stayed silent, his face turned away into his pillow, his hair glowing in the soft candlelight of their room, and Harry still couldn’t find the words he wanted. Quietly, as if the silence itself were preserving the moment, he slipped off his shoes and pulled back the covers. Draco stiffened as Harry slid in behind him and wrapped an arm around his waist, pulling them flush together. They’d lain like this countless times after nightmares, but now Harry’s heart was racing for an entirely different reason.
The bus stopped once more, this time at the side of the street.
“No shit," Draco snorted.
Malfoy swallows. His neck is a long expanse of smooth skin, and Harry vaguely wonders what it tastes like. “We might make use of them on the case. Staples, I mean. Have you any more?”
Most people would think the Astronomy Tower anything but calming, and their idea of a bad day had never included Unforgivables. Draco, however, found an unsettling peace sitting in the same spot where he’d stood two years prior. It was cathartic. There was a sense of forgiveness to it— a wild and vulgar rejection of peoples’ expectations. He would come up here sometimes when the skies were clear and just lay beneath the stars, breathing cold air until his head felt clear again and his ears hurt. Today it would work well enough for studying.
“At Malfoy. You’re staring at Malfoy.”
But the statement makes Potter frown. “I think I should be the one to decide that. And I do like you. I more than ‘like’ you, actually, which is why I can’t seem to talk to you unless I’m plastered.”
“Your hair’s wet,” Draco commented just then.
“I was being proactive!” Malfoy yells back.
“What?” Harry finally looks away from Malfoy. “No. Ew. Of course not.” He says it far too blandly, like a child denying their love of sweets, and Ron gives him a Look. Harry tries (unsuccessfully) to change the subject. “What’s he doing with the— why did he— what’s… erm.”
He was so preoccupied that he nearly forgot his field robes at home, and upon finally making it into the Ministry, he spent ten minutes panicking in the loo.
“Were those—“
“Go out with me,” Harry breathed between kisses. “Please. I want— to talk— to kiss you— take you to bloody Hogsmeade—”
Draco nods. He barely has time to sigh before Potter cups his face and kisses him.
Harry bit his lip.
“It’s not
Draco was once again seated at Savage’s desk, with Cho hovering over his shoulder while Ernie picked apart a case file infront of them. His chair was tilted in such a way that when Harry passed by, their eyes automatically met over Cho’s outstretched arm. Draco nodded at him blankly and looked away.
Harry shrugged. It certainly looked like a full day’s work.
cry after a quarterly meeting with both of them.
Draco hummed. “I’m not sure if it’s a matter of choice.”
“What’s your soulmate status?”
Today, however, he didn’t even make it to the door before he was stopped once again by Longbottom.
“Potter, you dunce,” Draco said indignantly. “It’s not funny, we’ve missed our fucking stop!”
“Yes, of course!” Draco flings himself half on top of him as Harry’s arms come up around him. They’re squeezing each other tight enough that Draco can hardly breathe, but he only pulls Harry closer. Draco kisses his hair, his temple, his wet cheek, and eventually finds his mouth. He presses his lips to Harry’s more desperately than he thinks he’s ever kissed him before. They don’t even taste one another, kissing close mouthed as they kneel together on the pathway, too happy and overwhelmed for anything else. Yet it burns Draco down to his core, leaves him breathless and laughing.
Perhaps luck would be on his side for once.
They lay quietly after that, with nothing but Draco’s heartbeat echoing in Harry’s arm. It didn’t feel like avoidance, however, more like they were both waiting for the right time to talk. Harry was inexplicably reminded of a piece of music or perhaps a dance, one where he wasn’t meant to come in yet. He didn’t have much to say, but he could feel Draco’s words in the tense line of his stomach, in the shift of his jaw as he bit his lips.
Harry sucked in a breath. He hadn't meant to, but it slipped out the moment he saw the stamped black swirl on Draco’s hip. The sound echoed unpleasantly in the quiet.
“I can share my login with you.” He doesn’t mind at all, really, even though he barely knows Harry and that just goes to show how weak Draco is for that mussed up hair.
“Juice, beer, or water, I think.”
He wanted this.
“Here,” Ron said, twirling his wand at the quill. “Handwriting charm. I didn’t marry Hermione for nothing.”
“Is she here?” The question was tentative, polite. Draco’s eyes flickered to Riven. He had not moved, but his gaze was sweeping over the crowds, his hand resting on the golden pommel of his sword.
“Right.” Harry’s not going to ask where Draco got the accent from. He looks around the room, but he’s not wearing his glasses and it’s still woefully dark. Draco sounds like he’s getting impatient however, mumbling quiet currant-related death threats, and Harry’d rather his lover not dream about making him into a pie.
“Well, you did buy me cat food,” Draco jokes. Tries to. “It’ll make us even—” but then he really thinks about what Harry said, and it couldn’t have been unintentional, it absolutely couldn’t have, not with the way Harry’s looking so crestfallen at his refusal. The wild, plague-ridden universe is finally blessing him, and Draco’s not going to fuck it up. Hopefully. “Or. Or instead— we can watch it together?”
Harry thought quietly for a moment, mostly to avoid Hermione’s stew, but also because she may have had a point. Draco rarely paid attention to his admirers, and they certainly shared a penchant for direct advances. Perhaps Harry did need to find a more subtle route—something that would show he cared respectfully, something that might indicate he knew Draco a bit better than Dennis Creevey did.
And they are, they’re so dazzlingly in love. So in love that Harry picks Draco’s dirty socks out of the laundry so they stay white and Draco lets him pee with the door open when their favorite shows are on (Ron may never understand the value of small things, but Draco does).
“You brought Pea,” Harry says, dumbfounded.
“Sorry, I— not actually, of course—”
“I don’t bloody know!”
“Look at the back,” Ron said.
Well, fuck.
Malfoy jumps to his feet, and Harry congratulates himself on finally getting a reaction out of him. “I’ll thank you not to call my business a rag,” he snaps. “And I shan’t take anything out. It’s none of your business what I print anyways.”
It’s as good as Draco remembers, and a thousand times better, because the way Harry holds him is because it’s
“Shit, I’m so sorry!” he said. “Are you alright? It was an accident, honest—” Harry would have continued with a lengthy apology, had that not been the moment he tried to step towards Draco, only to realize the back of his Auror jacket was firmly pinched in the doors.
The department around him was silent. Bunch by bunch, he began to unshrink every rose. Harry spread their shedding petals over the floor. He conjured up vases and set them on the shelves, filling them flower by flower. Their scent, soft and natural, clouded the room as he worked. Slowly, meticulously, Harry covered every surface in blooming red, until they sprung from the cabinets, the drawers, the very carpet. From every corner they stared back at him.
“Merlin, that’s really good, because I’ve been driving myself mental thinking about you,” Potter admits.
“I’m Draco Malfoy.”
Riven spoke so quietly that Draco barely heard him over his own ragged breathing. “I thought you didn’t care.”
“That would be us,” Ron says cheerfully. “Buckle up and tuck in, mate. Your hard-on is showing.”
Somewhere a hopeful little bird was chirping at his morning song. During those seconds Riven’s shoulders rose hopefully. Then Draco’s mind caught up to him.
Harry considered reminding Ron that reports were meant to be done in ink in the first place, but there was a more important battle to fight here. He wasn’t in denial about his feelings, but it was a standard dance—a matter of honor, if you will—to defend his behavior.
Like oranges.
Dean twisted his neck to look at the spot from a different angle. “It doesn’t look very balanced to me. That white dot is far too tiny.”
Draco blushes, dammit. He can’t help it. Harry tells him often enough, but he always says it with weight, like he means it, and Merlin if it doesn’t take Draco’s breath away.
The weather had been holding at a pleasant warmth, the blue sky filled with the clouds that were so crisply cut they reminded Draco of cream on a pastry. There was a light breeze in the air and the smell of sweet spices wafting through town. Draco loved fall.
Three horses were making their way through the throngs. Atop the lead mare sat a tall woman, her glossy red hair falling down her back in a loose tail and her rich satin robes rippling with the movement of her horse. A thin gold crown twisted over her brow, the leaves and designs rivaling Narcissa’s. Queen Lily.
The singing starts again.
“She’s indisposed, unfortunately. As her son I’ve taken over the business for a short while. Shall I carry a message for her?”
“I haven’t.”
“Don’t trip,” Draco murmured right before their lips met, and Harry smiled into their first kiss.
“No, he’s not!” Harry shouts back, cheeks flaming.
“I, er…” Harry swallowed, fumbling with the plastic cup. The paper sleeve had grown damp with condensation, and on a whim he tugged it off and pocketed it. “I brought you something, actually.” Draco raised a sculpted eyebrow, and Harry backpedaled on instinct. “I mean, I was just getting myself coffee at that place down the road. Not sure if you’ve even heard of it, to be honest, but they gave me two by accident so I thought maybe—”
“Yeah, and I’m going to be hearing about ‘nothing’ every five minutes in annoying little fractions for the next hour.”
This time Harry does laugh.
“What’s your name?” The question is light, easy.
“I know.”
Harry really couldn’t, so he finally bent down and retrieved the pieces of his glasses, knitting them together with a quick
“Terrified,” Draco said with an answering grin.
“How are you?” Potter asks, like nothing’s wrong, like the last time Draco heard his voice he wasn’t coming in Draco’s mouth.
All in all, Harry felt optimistic about the start of his day, and not entirely hopeless about his chances. He walked through the Atrium with a spring in his step, and hummed quietly in the half-empty elevator until an old witch shot him a glare.
“I hate to warn you, but you're being incredibly cryptic.”
“Just our luck that they’re coming this way,” Blaise was muttering beside them.
“Are you certain you were meant to do all of this by hand?” Draco said, eyes wide as he took in the mess. “How does one go about cleaning this without magic?”
Harry returned the smile. “I know. Thank you, ‘Mione. Means a lot.”
Draco holds out his hand and Harry slips the ring on with a look of reverence.
In the end, though Narcissa protested, Riven did not stay for supper. He excused himself with all the elegance of a court socialite and left Narcissa beaming. Draco had never known she possessed so many white teeth. Of course, he was shooed to the door to see Riven off with numerous smirks and winks from his mother. He was sure he’d rather she just drop the pot of tea on his head.
“What?”
He shuffled a few papers around, and pulled out a decorative card. At first Harry thought it was his own letter to Draco, misplaced, but when he took it from Ron and opened it, the inside was blank.
Harry was quiet for a moment. “But you’ve never been in love, correct?”
“Er, Draco?” Harry asks quietly, “Are you awake?”
“You wouldn’t.”
“Conservative, my arse,” Ron muttered.
“Ride it yourself, you coward.”
They rode together for several quiet moments, before Draco spared a glance for his offending footwear.
Draco doesn’t respond, but his cheeks slowly darken and Harry thinks his heart might actually stop. Forget coronavirus, he’s getting taken out by a blond with a fat cat. What a way to go.
Harry considered it for a moment, slowly nodding his head. “I—actually, that’s a pretty great idea.” He started to grin. “Ron, that’s brilliant, really.” Draco did love that sort of thing—the dress robes, the gold-leaf invitations. Which raised another worry.
“Wow, you’re a handful,” he blurts as soon as he hefts Pea up against his chest. Draco flushes. The vet insists Pea is healthy, but he weighs about 10 kilos and knows it. “What’s your name?”
It’s Harry of course, but it’s Harry in shorts. It’s Harry in a T-shirt that has no right being that tight, Harry with a sheen of sweat over his face and dampening his hair and flat stomach. Harry looking flushed and out of breath and like he’s just run halfway around the park. Draco gulps and drops half his mail.
“Well, I’ll be—”
“If you mean all those months ago, that’s a longer story,” Harry looked away. “I needed to be present to test the magic of whatever piece you chose to sell to me. I was born with a magical affliction. I am much weaker than I appear. Sickness is quick to take me, and all the exercise and healing in the world hasn’t seemed to help. The illness limits my life significantly.”
“I suppose it’s passable,” Draco said. Ron snorted, and whispered something about Harry liking things bitter as he threw back the rest of his eggnog. “I was actually hoping to speak to you—in private, possibly?”
, and now he knows just what it feels like to have that mouth pressed against his own. He’s sure it will all turn sad and painful and embarrassing when one of them finally pulls away, but for now he’s just
“Are you asking now?” Draco said, turning to fully look at him.
“Kneazle got your tongue?” Ron asks after Harry fails to finish his sentence for the fifth time. Ron can make fun of him if he wants—
The tree itself was a young one, and clearly not meant to support the weight of an adult wizard, because with a violent wobble it began to topple sideways. By that point Draco had caught Harry by the elbow and was attempting to hoist him free, but Draco was rather slim himself and didn’t seem prepared to support the weight of an adult wizard either. Harry desperately reached out to grab something to keep them both upright. His hand landed on something fuzzy and rope-like, and he pulled.
“That you are, loverboy.”
“It’s magnificent,” Harry says. “You think we’ll ever be able to get our garden at home up to standard?”
Draco’s not sure where this is going, but that certainly isn’t what he expected. After their drunken night together, he’d imagined Potter doing many things—denying it, pretending it didn’t happen, perhaps even threatening Draco into silence. Certainly not bringing it up calmly, if a bit insecurely.
“Yeah, yeah sure.” Harry scoops around in his bag for his phone. “Let me just give you my number.” He stops. His cheeks feel unnaturally hot and he just knows he’s blushing, dammit. How smooth.
He felt peaceful, wonderfully, boringly domestic, for the first time in what felt like months until—
And finally, Draco rolled over to face him. They were close enough that their noses might have brushed if Harry leaned forward just barely. Draco’s breath washed over his lips with every exhale, and he found it difficult to concentrate on what he said next.
