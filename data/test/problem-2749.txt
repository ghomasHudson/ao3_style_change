“He cannot move,” the Healer said, his beady little eyes much wider but still beady. “It would be detrimental to his recovery – “
Harry turned to give him a startled look. “That’s the second compliment you’ve paid me today, Malfoy. Are you coming down with something?”
hit me when I came back, didn’t she?”
And with that, she turned to the fireplace, threw floo powder onto the flames, shouted “The MLE!”, and disappeared in a rush of green. And Draco cried out in anguish, lurching toward the flames. But he couldn’t move; his arms were being held and there was a weight around his knees. When he looked down he saw Teddy; he’d wrapped his arms around Draco’s legs and was holding on as tightly as he could, looking up at him with tears in his eyes.
Contentment filled his heart as he placed a plate with roast, potatoes and prominently featured,
“Log books,” Draco said, dropping them onto the coffee table with a dusty thud. “Decades worth. And apparently, the phenomenon we’re seeing with the animals has happened before.”
“Too old to be acting like this.” He sighed. “I’m forty-six years old, Draco; I didn’t want to assume.”
Both Hannah and Justin murmured shamefaced apologies, and Harry waved them off. "You both have valid points, but if we can't be civil to one another, and we're on the
Draco grinned before he ducked his head under the spray. He came back out, shaking his hair and flicking drops of warm water across Harry’s chest. He just batted at him ineffectually.
"But we won't. I swear." Apparently Al read Harry correctly and could see a break in his resolve. "We'll just use it for our NEWT. We never even considered turning ourselves into anyone other than each other."
She looked as if she might cry. “I’m sorry, Harry.”
Draco snorted, glancing over at Harry. “We had to move his portrait into the attic,” he said wryly. “Needless to say, he didn’t approve of the remodel.”
Draco laughed. “Prat.”
The corner of Draco’s full lips quirked. “What, an offer I can’t refuse?” When Harry looked surprised, Draco snorted. “I’ve read The Godfather, Potter. I’ve even seen the film, believe it or not. But given that you aren’t Sicilian, at least as far as I know, or involved with the Mafia, I find myself mystified.”
He read it several times, then shoved it back into his pocket. He'd show it to Draco tonight, and they'd decide what to do. They could, in theory, choose not to press charges. Harry doubted it would go that way, but Draco had surprised him before.
"If it is, it's new at it. I sent him out to the owlery for treats and a rest. The envelope is on the desk, over there."
"I'm all right, and I figure your company won't be late. With that thought, I'll take my leave." He gave Harry a lopsided grin. "Night, Mate."
Draco’s smile curled his lips almost reluctantly. “I think I’m flattered.” Harry chuckled. “What do you suppose that was, anyway? That
“Oh, I think I understand more than you want me to.”
Harry looked at Hermione in surprise. She shrugged, dropping her bag by her chair and pulling off her teaching robes, dropping them onto the ottoman. She was wearing tailored dark blue trousers and a white blouse, and she collapsed back into her chair, kicking off her pumps.
“Face it, Pops,” his son went on. “You’re hot.”
“I know. It’s just that…” She shrugged. “This is home.”
He pulled the band from his hair and let it fall around his shoulders, trying to run his fingers through it but it was hopelessly tangled. He pushed it back over his shoulder, looking over at Draco.
She squeezed his hand. “At least you get a couple of weeks before classes start again.” She looked cagey. “I don’t suppose you’ve heard from the new Potions Professor.”
"I'm – lonely," he said, surprising even himself. "I'm thirty-two years old, I'm flipping Minister for Magic, I'm with people almost from the moment I get up until I fall into bed at night. But I'm so lonely I ache."
Malfoy inhaled deeply, turning his back on Harry and running one hand up into his hair. It was shorter than Harry had ever seen it, and he liked the casual tousled fringe, mangled during his play with his grandson. His raking fingers didn’t help. After a couple of minutes, he squared his shoulders and turned back. The thick hair looked lighter to Harry than it had when they were young, and he wondered if there was more white in it than blond. Harry certainly had an abundance of curly silver hair at his own temples.
Draco felt his heart hitch, then begin to beat hard and fast, right at the base of his throat. “For me, too,” he whispered.
“Careful there, Malfoy. You’re insulting my bedroom.”
It took Harry a minute to get with the program, probably due to rum intake, but the taste of Draco, already so familiar and missed, broke open the seal Harry had put around his heart the morning before. He wrapped his arms around Draco and tugged him in tight, angling his head and kissing back with everything he had.
Harry snorted in amusement.
"Only if used in a derogatory manner describing a woman. Was my manner derogatory?"
Draco eyes came back, and he angled his head. “How so?”
“Let’s not overextend ourselves.”
Harry huffed. “Don’t be a git. Okay, here goes.” He swirled the fabric around them like a magician’s cape, which he supposed it was, come to think of it. He settled the light weight fabric over them, then stepped forward until he could feel the heat of Malfoy’s body all along his side. He caught Malfoy’s wrist and felt him stiffen.
“Good morning.” Draco didn’t look nearly as relaxed, and Harry knew it was childish but he took some simple satisfaction in that.
Harry laughed. “It’s only happened once or twice.”
Harry added the dark sweater over the tee shirt. “Okay, I need coffee if there’s going to be much more of this.” He picked up a pair of boots he’d worn maybe twice during tropical storms on the Island, and he’d had to troop out through the muddy paddocks. They looked brand new, and they’d been the only footwear he owned that was even mildly appropriate. And his trainers were still soaked through from the night before.
“You know,” she said, nibbling on a piece of perfectly browned toast. Harry took another off a plate in the middle of the table and took a bite. It was perfect. “I had a thought last night after you went to bed. I think you should go to the Ministry and access their Veterinary Medical records.”
Draco smirked. “I thought you might be going to take issue with that.”
Harry was lying on his side facing the door, his eyes closed. For the first time since they’d seen him in New York, the lines of pain on his face had relaxed and his breathing was slow and easy. Hermione walked to him, laying her hand on the back of his where it rested on the bed next to his head. His eyelashes fluttered and he looked up at her.
“Spoken like someone who knows,” she answered, giving him a speculative look. “Something you want to tell us, Harry?”
He’d tried sleeping on the sitting room sofa the night before; he doubted he’d ever feel comfortable in his own rooms at the Manor again. The bloody sinister nutcracker had taken care of that for him. But he’d been on edge the entire night, and light-headed for most of the day since the sky had lightened from black to pewter gray. And now, it was snowing again. He shivered as a cold breeze blew wet snow into his face and sped his steps, slipping on the slush and glancing over his shoulder.
Hermione smirked. “I agree. Even Ronald does, which…”
“Thank you, Hermione,” Harry sighed. “I love you.”
Glad Rags was all but deserted in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon. Harry sat in an offered armchair, embarrassed by being offered coffee and biscuits, even wine, all of which he refused while Draco flitted from rack to rack like some sort of tall, animated fashion fairy. He pulled slacks and shirts and jumpers and jackets, dumping them into the arms of two attendants while Harry looked on in dismay. He'd have to try all of that crap on, which he hated. Draco was obviously having so much fun, though, that Harry decided he could live with it.
"You're very welcome." His smile was brilliant, and he signed happily. "I do love shopping."
Mare shook her head. “Statute of Interministry secrecy, I believe. But they’re fairly obvious.” She didn’t roll her eyes, but the desire to went unspoken. “And they did leave floo coordinates so you could return the call.”
Harry stared at him, startled. “Well, it hadn’t until now.” He looked at Hagrid, who was far ahead of them, cleaning his old meat grinder outside of his hut. The giant new Fang lay nearby, no more ferocious than the old one.
“You don’t understand,” he said instead, shaking his head. He looked back up, his eyes wide. “They knew things; things they shouldn’t have known. And they threatened…” He was whispering, but even so, his voice felt too loud. He looked around desperately. “Do we have to do this here?”
“Oh, dear. You look tired; are you all right?”
“This can’t have come from Rohrbach. You’re certain that’s his bird?”
“There is that.” She took one of the loaded carts and one of the volunteers, and wheeled it off down the long hallway.
“Trust me, you want this job.”
. Didn’t you have to study them at the Academy?”
“I’m not that strange,” Harry said with a lopsided grin.
Draco lurched forward as he saw the ring glow a brilliant blue, but when he reached out with both arms Harry disappeared, and he stumbled into the place he left behind. “No,” he gasped, his arms achingly empty. “No, NO!” He whirled on Granger, who had her wand out and was waving it frantically. “Why did you give him that? Why???” But she ignored him, her face a mask of rapt concentration. “Granger, do something!!”
“No, Mum. It’s pretty important.”
Harry's snort of laughter sounded vaguely hysterical to his own ears. "No doubt."
“Just who we thought,” she answered, and Harry narrowed his eyes. “Hermione –“
hpdmhpdhmhpdm
Draco frowned thoughtfully. “Are you sure I said that?” He glanced down at the elf as he passed her. “Hello, Flossy.”
“Harry Potter, sir?”
“The one in the middle of the floor that says; On this spot, on May second 1998, Harry James Potter killed Tom Riddle, also known as Lord Voldemort…”
“Harry.” Kingsley’s smile flared white in his dark face. “How are you?”
Scorpius had made a scoffing sound. “Mr Potter’s always been very nice to me when I’ve gone into the bakery,” he said. “And after last year’s father/student Ravenclaw/ Slytherin match, he told me I flew really well.”
“Aren’t you even remotely interested in how Scorpius’s mission came out?”
The bird obediently silenced, settling on a stand just inside of the window. Harry found a plate of treats nearby and fed him one before closing the window and turning away.
She stared into her mug, and Harry was alarmed by the tears that misted her eyes. She cleared her throat. “Horace passed this afternoon.”
Unlike Ron, if Hermione was worried about someone her sleep was sketchy, and she was very concerned about Harry. He was one of the strongest people she knew. For him to admit that he was near the limits of his endurance frightened her, and that had been hours ago. She checked her watch, and sighed; six hours ago, exactly. Her breath fogged the window and she frowned distractedly, taking a step back. Colored twinkle lights hung from a branch just outside the glass, covered in the thick, heavy snow that had fallen overnight. The view from the third floor window down onto 74th Street was lovely, even with the rush of early morning traffic. The trees were cloaked in white, the sidewalks as yet un-shoveled, the wheels of the steadily moving cars hushed by the six or more inches of snow. Usually New York was one of the noisiest places she’d ever been, but right now it didn’t seem like it. Maybe the glass was thicker than usual…
Draco grinned at him slyly. “Hairy, huh?”
Harry smiled in spite of himself. “She’s also brilliant. She was just very nervous…” He let his voice trail off, unable to elaborate further without sounding like an ego maniac to his own ears. Malfoy didn’t need him to continue, apparently. He smirked.
“Oh, George, I don’t know.” Merthilda tried to dig her heels in, but it did her no good.
“Lovely, isn’t it?” Frombley said. “So nice of the supplier to get them to us two days before Christmas Eve. I doubt we’ll sell a tenth of them.”
Prompt for this part:
He was sitting in the anteroom of the Wizengamot’s full meeting chamber, his hands clutched in his lap. Along with his feet they were so cold they felt like blocks of ice, and his heavy winter robes felt weird on his body. He hadn’t worn robes in so long that it felt as if he was only half dressed. So much so he’d gone back after meeting Harry on the corner near his flat, run up the three flights, and put on skinny jeans underneath them.  When he came back down, Harry had been standing right where he’d left him, his arms crossed over his chest. Gods, he’d been sexy, robes pulling taut over his biceps, feet braced and planted.
He nodded. Symptoms didn’t appear until ten days to two weeks after exposure; all of the children, all twenty seven of them, could have been exposed by now. And another fifteen would be arriving home on the Hogwarts Express on the fifteenth. He sighed and raked his fingers through his hair. This could be a nightmare.
Harry glanced out over the lake just as a long, black squid arm broke the surface, and arched through the air before disappearing once again beneath the gently moving waves. How did one broach this topic with their sixteen-year-old son? Sorry, but your Aunt is afraid you've knocked up your best friend – your
“You had a choice,” the Nutcracker countered. “There are always choices.”
“We’re going to wait another minute,” she said.
"Utterly."
Draco glanced at the drawing. “Her wings spread?”
Harry glanced up at Dennis as he saw the other man take a drink of his wine, his mind racing. It was pretty clear that Denny had some mental issues; adding that potion to someone who was dangerously unbalanced, and holding a wand, was never a good combination. He’d have to keep his wits about him. He just hoped that the series of anti-intoxicant potions he took as a part of his job worked as well as the MLE thought they did.
“Don’t forget the fan mail,” Ernie said brightly, dumping several envelopes on the corner of Harry’s desk. He eyed the messy stack balefully.
"Ignore him," he whispered. "I've met piles of excrement with more intelligence."
Draco stared at his son and felt as if he’d been struck. He and Scorpius had never discussed the horror that had been his sixth year; he hadn’t wanted to give himself excuses, or to make himself look like even more of a pathetic figure than he had been. “How do you even – “
Harry snorted. “Of course, it is. It couldn’t simply be that you like her.”
“Could I stop you?”
The answer was almost instantaneous.
“I remember that.” Harry rubbed his hand over his face. “I was crying,” he admitted softly. “I’d just come out to you and Ron, and he asked me if I had a thing for Malfoy.”
~***~
Prompt used for this part:
“No, Hermione’s already done that.” Ron smiled. “I don’t think they’d let you do it anyway. You’re a wee bit compromised at the mo.”
Anya had lost both of her grandparents within the last year, and their passing had left her prone to worry. He couldn’t blame her.
Harry crossed to him, reaching up and pushing his fringe from his light colored eyes. “I wouldn’t trade a one of them, something you know only too well.”
wanted it, and yet here he was, utilizing half a dozen rooms in a Manor house with nearly three hundred rooms at last counting. Of course, being a wizarding domicile nearly four hundred years old, with a series of sycophantic aristocrats and one Dark Lord in its history, the floorplan could not be considered set in stone.
and turned it into an actual newspaper, albeit an eccentric one. Draco had argued that giving an interview voluntarily would prevent the rags from following them everywhere they went for the next six months; Harry had agreed to give the exclusive to Luna because he knew that it would piss Skeeter off. And after the way Dennis Creevey’s trial had been handled by the
Harry frowned at him in disbelief. “He’ll come back to you and his son, safe and sound. I guarantee that’s more important to him than this fucking house.” Malfoy looked unmoved, and Harry sighed. “I can ask Kingsley to send an Auror crew out here to attempt to add a layer to your wards, but I’m not confident they’ll hold. Not well enough to protect that little boy.”
“That won’t be necessary,” Harry said. He’d spent enough time in the ER; he knew how to get there. “I’ll take him up, then?”
Leah's smile was slow, but knowing.  “How is this new flame of yours going to feel about being trotted out like Potter's trick pony?  That might be a bit overwhelming, don't you think?”
Harry rotated his finger, maintaining pressure on the gland, and Draco rolled his hips, his head back and his eyes closed.
“You don’t like it?”
“What?” Pansy turned.
“Where, there’s a change,” Ron said, slipping his hands into his pockets. “Usually you buy the kid something just this side of legal.”
He frowned. “What?”
“You’ll keep him unconscious, you mean. So he’s supposed to float through the next eleven days in a cloud of spells and Mandrake root?”
Potter grinned at him.
“Chatty cow,” Draco grumbled. “And shouldn’t you be in class?”
“Well, yes, I told Harry…”
“Mr Potter.”
"Honestly, Potter. Did you give this any thought at all before blurting out that you wanted me to pretend to be your date?"
Ernie rubbed his face with his hands. “What a fucking mess. Weasley, you’ve got to believe me…” he said, then paused, his eyes opening wide. “Wait, wait…” He licked his lips nervously. “Wait. There is someone… Harry’s been getting these weird cards…”
Harry looked down at the parchment in his hand, concerned because it was so dark, when the words began to glow on the page. He felt relief flow through him.
“Noted, Healer,” Hermione said, touching his arm. “I’ll make certain he stays still.”
He looked back in time to catch the blush on Harry’s face. “It feels like forever, but I guess since the war. Seemed like a good thing to know. It’s no big deal.”
"You been coaching her, now?"
on you to get you to give Katie Bell the opal necklace that almost killed her.” Harry arched a brow at her, and he saw pink spread across her cheekbones.
Draco levitated the giant silver punch bowl carefully down the flight of stairs at the back of the room, letting it come to rest in the center of a long table that was draped in a silver lame cloth. On one side of it crystal goblets were lined up in neat rows, and a stack of hunter green plates and cutlery were placed on the other. Beyond it were more tables, all in the same silver and green décor with large arrangements of white flowers. They would be groaning under the weight of the food that was planned. Harry let Draco have his way with the décor, but he’d planned the menu.
"Going up for Scotland verses England?"
“Aside from the conviction that I may never walk again, yes.”  He studied Potter's flushed face.  “You?”
“I was watching you,” he said, lifting his chin and accepting the light kiss that Harry dropped onto his lips before sitting near his knees. “Were the wards stable?”
Harry caught Tyler’s feet so he didn’t kick his dad. “Someone else didn’t nap, either,” he observed, and Draco shrugged one shoulder.
“I hope you can explain why Hermione Granger and Harry Potter are standing outside at the counter, asking for you.”
“Lovely.”
Harry nodded. “Truly. And they’re about twice the size of British goats.”
Draco cleared his throat. "Because it's a mess," he finally answered, intentionally choosing to misunderstand and keeping his tone light. "If I'm going to be seen with you, I'd just as soon you weren't a disaster."
“The coordinates,” she said by way of explanation. Hermione nodded.
He knew that his face was flooding with color, but he didn’t look away.  “Yes.”
Harry glanced at Draco. He held up his hands. “Far be it for me to deny Princess Olivia anything.”
Harry kept the kiss soft, his mouth moving gently, his hand curving around Draco’s back. Draco felt thin but solid under his hand, and when he turned more fully into Harry’s body, his arms lifting to curl around Harry’s neck, Harry murmured against his lips when he felt Draco’s arousal press against his own. Draco pulled back and looked up at him, his eyes full. “Look at the windows,” he whispered, and Harry turned his head.
He stopped by the new clearing. It was amazing, really, how fast the young of any species recovered in comparison to the more senior members, and this was the same with the baby Thestral. She was up on her feet, and she greeted him with a happy bleat and bounced up to him as if she’d never been ill at all. Even though his heart was heavy, he was able to find a very real smile for her.
oooOOOooo
“Yes. Have done since Father went back to Azkaban the second time. I was, what… seventeen? Eighteen? Only to find out even then he’d near run it into the ground and let Riddle raid the vaults. And why the fuck am I telling you this?” He scrubbed his hand over his face. “In answer to your question; yes. I’ve been in charge of the Malfoy estate for a very long time.”
Harry opened his eyes and turned his head to the side when he felt a bump against his left shoulder.  Ginny sat on the arm of the sofa, leaning into his side, a smirk on her face.
Draco picked moodily at his dry scone and couldn’t help but wonder what Potter might think if he saw him now.
It was a weird sensation to be hugged by someone you couldn’t see, but not necessarily a bad one.
“He's quite won you over, hasn't he?”
"Fine, then. I'm smooth, and you're hairy as an old boar."
“I need a shameless ruse to get you naked, do I?” he asked, one brow arching.
“Potter.”
Scorpius smacked Al's upper arm, giving him a quelling look but Al ignored him.
“There’s an Angel’s Market just over a block,” she answered sotto voce. “I thought we’d go for coffee.”
She crossed her arms against the cold as well, and her expression was stern, her amusement fading. “What are you doing?”
Under the wards, a thriving wizarding village called
“But she spent so much money here,” she sniffed. “And what if her friends listen to her and stop shopping here?”
“No, that’s all right.” Scorpius hunched forward and dug his fork into his lunch, careful not to look up again. “I’m over-stepping. This is your business, and pretty clearly you don’t want me in it.” It was the hurt in Draco’s son’s voice that got to him, made his throat ache. He rubbed his hands over his face, then dropped them into his lap.
Draco jumped and turned, finding Harry standing directly behind him. He was wearing his uniform, but his jaw was covered with dark stubble, and Draco felt an unmistakable stirring of need low in his stomach. Gods, he loved it when Harry had a day’s growth of beard on his chin, and it was much thicker now than it had been at twenty. He smiled slowly and held up the festive cookie.
Harry laughed in spite of himself. “Now my love life is a Christmas carol.”
Harry pulled his shirt off over his head without bothering to undo  the buttons, dropping it to the floor as he began to ease Draco toward the open door of the bedroom. Draco made a sound of delight on seeing all of Harry’s dark sun-tanned skin and his firm muscles.
~***~
They finished the song with a flourish, hands in the air, and gave themselves an enthusiastic round of applause. Harry stood, sweeping the hat from his head in a deep bow, and the children giggled in delight.
“What’s a prick?”
Harry lifted his head and looked into Draco’s eyes, to find them wide, watching him.
“Good,” Potter said with a cheeky grin. “I don’t top exclusively. This should work out extremely well.”
Harry winced.
“Yeah.” He shrugged. “So?”
“Harry!!”
Harry looked at the door with a smile. He thought the small family was brilliant.
“Oh, that’s subtle,” Harry said as keys rattled once again in the lock.
oooOOOooo
“That,” Harry answered, leaning over to put his plate on the floor, “was Hermione, on a mission.”
“Family estate? The Ministry made sure there wasn’t much of one left.”
No one was supposed to be able to
“You look like hell,” Draco said softly. “Did you sleep at all?”
When he arrived at the nursery door, he paused and watched for a moment before making his presence known. Potter was still sitting in the rocking chair, and though Olivia’s romper had been changed and her hair combed, she was still clinging to him in her sleep. Potter wasn’t sleeping, but he looked very much as if he needed to.
“Oh, you don’t know that,” she countered, still snickering. “Maybe he’s trying to send a message.” Mirth made her voice unsteady. “Maybe he bats for your team.”
Finally, he pried open his eyes and turned his head to the side, and saw Potter lying there, his body still slick with sweat, his chest rising and falling rapidly.  Potter's head rolled to the side, and  he sought Draco's eyes.  “Are you all right?” he asked.
She shook her head. Draco caught the small lobe in his hand and peered into her ear, and immediately saw the problem.
When Harry stepped in through the massive double entry doors, he was met by a house-elf who dutifully took his outer robes, leaving him in a black high necked jumper and black trousers tucked into his boots, and told him respectfully that ‘the family is being in the front parlor’. Harry followed the sound of voices, and grinned when he heard Teddy’s high-pitched, happy chatter.
“I never met her,” Draco said softly as Potter released his hand and went into the en-suite bath. Moments later, Draco heard the sound of water filling a tub.  When Potter came back, he crossed straight to Draco and carefully removed the fur hat from his head before starting on the buttons down the front of his coat.
“Because I have the distinct impression we aren’t headed toward London.”
Draco’s pretended to look thoughtful. “I suppose it does, actually,” he murmured, stepping closer to Harry. Harry reached out and snaked an arm around his waist, pulling him into his body.
emphasized voice and the room settled into silence. "Bill Number1297D, also known as Narcissa's Bill, wherein the law is changed to allow Witch's to sue for divorce under circumstances that make the institution of marriage no longer tolerable…"
“I don’t find you at all amusing,” Draco called after him.
Harry looked after him for a long time.
Harry snorted. “That was a long time ago, Hermione.”
Harry and Ron stared at one another. "Come on, Harry. You think Malfoy
“What is that?” he asked rhetorically. Of course, he knew it was a motor bike, but honestly, he’d never seen one up close before.
“Okay.”
“And then we wait for the sugar high to wear off some time around four this afternoon.” Hermione took a sip of a cup of coffee and smirked at the front page of the newspaper.
“Thrilled, more like.” Hermione reached out when they reached the end of the hall and pushed open one of a set of massive black doors. It swung easily at her light pressure. “She’s been a teaching assistant for Ancient Runes at Ilvermorny for over a year. I wish old Babbing would retire so she could come home and teach at Hogwarts. I know Neville would hire her in a second.”
Blaise looked as wary as Draco felt. "All right, now, before we venture into this, I want you to make me a promise."
“Goes with the territory.” Harry forced himself to relax back against a potting bench, his hands on either side of his hips. He caught and held Draco’s gaze. “I had a thought about Adrian today.”
together, it would be obvious. Trust me. There are two guys in our dorm room who are together, and it's hard to miss. I know you can't tell me who, okay?" And he didn't look any happier about it than Harry was. "But what made them leap to that?"
Harry laughed in relief. "I'm so glad you weren't gone." He wrapped his arm around Draco's slender waist and pulled him in against his chest, lifting his chin to stare into his eyes. He leaned in slowly, knew the exact moment when Draco let his head drop to the side and closed his eyes. He closed the scant distance left between them and pressed his lips to Draco's. He caressed Draco's mouth with his lips and teeth, then slipped his tongue along the seam of Draco's lips until he finally parted them with a soft sound of acquiescence.
Potter laughed. “Not really, no.  I like it, though, the exploding gun. As long as no one loses any fingers.”
Harry chuckled. It was the only time she cursed; when there was a book she wanted to study, and there was no time.
Harry stopped in the middle of the staircase, and Draco stopped beside him.
Draco crossed his arms but his usual defensive quip wasn’t forthcoming. “Why were you down here?”
look like this.”
Draco gently rolled him to his back, then slid his arm under his shoulders. Harry could smell the subtle scent of his cologne, and feel the strength in his arm. He gripped Draco’s other hand, and between the two of them they were able to get him into a seated position with a minimum amount of pain. It had receded to a deep throbbing, and he pushed at the solid muscle in his thigh.
She pushed the laundry aside and leaned forward, her hand coming to rest on his upper arm.
Malfoy sniffed and looked away. Harry knew it was all of the acknowledgment he was going to get.
“So you’ve said.” Hermione pulled her handbag up higher on her shoulder. “Repeatedly.” She sniffed and looked off down the road toward the entrance to Hogsmeade.
“All right,” Malfoy began, apparently unaware of how gobsmacked the people in the room were by the changes in him. He started to peel back the thin hospital blankets Harry was wrapped in, then hesitated. He looked up at Ginny and George, then over to the young woman still hovering in a corner of the room. “Ah, Rebecca, will you please take George and Ginevra to the sitting room and give them refreshments? And thank you for helping to get him here,” he said to them. “International Portkeys are notoriously rough. That can’t have been easy.”
Draco’s eyes grew hooded. “What about him?”
“Oh, Harry, just do it,” Hermione encouraged him with a smile.
“Mmmm. Well, like I said, that is a minor thing as far as I’m concerned.” Harry pressed in and Draco’s body gripped then relaxed, allowing him in to the second knuckle. Draco’s mouth dropped open and he made a visible effort to regulate his breathing. “Fortunately, I know my way around a man’s arse.”
The couple he'd heard entered the hallway abreast with them, and Draco leaned into his side. Harry felt a surge of pleasure so strong he almost missed what Draco was saying.
Draco blinked again, gobsmacked.  “Weasley... told his sister to mind her own business... even though he knows that we're seeing each other.”  He shook his head when Potter nodded, and took a larger drink of the wine, draining nearly half the glass.  Potter smiled. “The planets may well have just re-alligned.”
finish that sentence. My father used to say that shit."
Draco looked at his right leg. “Do you feel up to that?”
It’s insensitive.”
Draco stared at her, stunned. “He was in America, and he left his wand here?” He could scarcely fathom such a thing. He didn’t think he’d been more than an arm’s length from his own wand since he’d been eleven and Olivander had handed it to him. Well, unless one took into account the months Potter had it. “Why in the world would he do such a thing?”
“I don’t
Draco heard Harry gasp, and he even caught his own breath. That could be disastrous, even fatal. Children took entirely different potions than adults did. Their systems were so much smaller, and more susceptible to poisoning.
She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.
“When is the last time you went home, Hermione?”
“’Morning, Uncle Harry.” Her voice was high and clear, and he smiled.
Now Draco grinned. “Spoken like a true Gryffindor. One part bravado and nine parts pure dumb luck.”
About half of the students enrolled at Babbity were Muggle born, so their parents dropped them off in the attached lot. The other half arrived via an Apparition point behind the playground, or via the Floo in the main office. It was part of the reason Harry arrived early, aside from the fact he enjoyed the early morning quiet; he wanted to make sure the Floo was open to the network so staff and students could arrive. He expected Clara to come through almost any minute; some days she arrived before he did, but it wasn’t often.
Draco glanced at the doorway again, fidgeting with a small bottle of colored sprinkles on the granite counter top. Teddy was chatting merrily with his mother and his aunt as they cut out sugar cookies in the ancient Pagan symbols and slipped them into the oven, but Draco could only stare at the door.
“Ah, see? He can be taught.” Harry grinned at Draco’s sour expression and knelt smoothly by Draco’s feet, untying his shoes and taking them off one at a time, then pulling off his slacks and pants and letting them drop to the floor. Draco went up onto his elbows as Harry looked up into his face, then down at his cock.
“I am,” Harry said, grinning. “I’m almost fifty years old. How old are you?”
He hadn’t seen him in years, not since the trials at the Ministry but there was no mistaking who it was. Harry had testified at his trial, and at his mother’s. They’d exchanged a few words and Harry had returned his wand, and that had been it. He’d looked awful back then, drawn and gray, so thin he’d been brittle. The glance he’d exchanged with Harry just before he walked away with his mother had haunted Harry for months.
For the purposes of this story, I’m borrowing the Pagan celebration of the Winter Solstice and adding in a dash of HP canon, and my own take on a wizarding celebration. No insult is intended by doing this; I have enormous respect for the pagan traditions, and find myself learning more every time I read about them. In fact, as a Christian, I’m amazed by how much we ‘borrowed’ from people here long, long before we were.
dare fall,” Potter said against a rough kiss, and Draco didn’t understand until Potter slid gracefully to his knees.
“Harry, Mate.” Ron walked up from behind Malfoy, moving slowly and carefully, one hand up, palm out. With the other he gestured carefully to Hermione from behind his back. It only took her a moment to understand what he wanted her to do. “Much as it pains me to admit this out loud, he actually is trying to help you.”
“Hello,” Harry said as he approached the table, unwinding his dark scarf from around his throat. He desperately wanted to press a kiss to those full lips, but he let his fingers trail over a square shoulder instead.
“Christmas come early, Potter?”
“Can I make you tea, gents?” Clara offered brightly. “I’m making some for myself, so it wouldn’t be any bother.”
Draco widened his eyes. "Conducive and charade in the same sentence," he drawled. "I am impressed."
“Thanks.”
“The normal social niceties just really are utterly beyond you, aren’t they?”
“Oh.” Harry shook his head.  “Sorry. Of course. Better be yours. I’m obviously distracted.”
When he paused in the doorway, his smile softened at the sight that met his eyes. Narcissa and Andromeda were seated side by side on a small settee, wine glasses in hand, and Teddy was on the rug, his legs crossed and a rapt expression on his face. Draco was seated in a wing back chair in front of him, the holly wand in his hand, making several glowing symbols float in the air. The room was lit with candles, dozens of them, burning on every surface and the light caught in the waves of Draco’s hair and made his face seem to glow.
He heard a step on the floor behind him and turned. Draco was standing in the doorway, wearing his green Healers robes, his hair tousled and his cheeks pink as if he’d just come in from outside. He saw Harry, and his lips curled in a soft smile.
“But of course.” She turned back to the documents scattered across the top of her huge desk.
“Glad you approve.” Harry sounded faintly suffocated, and he rolled his hips into the touch. Draco caught his rhythm, squeezing, and after a few rolling thrusts, Harry stopped. “Okay, I get your point about being close,” he said. “Perhaps what we need to understand is that it just isn’t going to take very long this first time, and get on with it.”
He felt a light touch on his arm and looked over in time to see Pansy set a crystal tumbler containing a large square ice cube and gleaming amber liquid on the white linen cloth near his hand, and he nodded his thanks.
Draco blushed, and Pansy shushed her.
She called out ‘Ron and Hermione’s kitchen’, and disappeared in the flare of neon flames. Harry stared into the darkened fireplace, chewing thoughtfully on the inside of his lower lip.
“Charming, you are,” Ron muttered. She gave him a hard look when he stood and went to the refrigerator, returning with another bottle of beer. He popped the top and set it in front of her, then reclaimed his chair.
"I'll bear that in mind," he said, eternally grateful to Oliver.
“Shut it,” Malfoy growled. “It’s his bloody name, all right?”
“Hey, you’re awake,” Weasley said with a friendly smile when he saw Draco watching him. “Excellent.” He turned back to Harry. “See, Mate? He’s awake.”
Santa was not pleased.
“Yeah.”
Draco was a bit humbled by that. "I'll endeavour not to violate that. Are you adverse to arse play?"
"Why is it we always have to arrive at these things so bloody early?"
“Thanks so much.” Harry wiped the mess away with the back of his hand, grimacing.
“Oh, I should write you up for that jumper, Ted Lupin. Especially wearing it into my home, you rotten brat.”
“I beg your pardon?” Harry replied, one brow raised.
“After the great war between the centaurs and the giants in 1597, the Dementors of Siberia – ” Harry read aloud.
As if he could forget.
Harry took a step back, and reaching into a deep pocket in his robes, he withdrew a small black velvet box. Draco stared at it, his eyes wide.
“Very,” Malfoy answered, and Harry thought he wasn’t imagining the answering melancholy tone.
Al stopped abruptly, turning to look at Harry, his eyes very wide. But for the scruff on his chin, he looked just as he had when he was little and been caught with his hand in the box where Jamie kept his chocolate frogs.
Draco hated that term, 'we need to talk'. It had never led anywhere he wanted to go.
She didn't begin to gather her things and Harry waited. He'd known her too long and too well not to recognize when she had something to say.
Harry pulled Draco behind the building where they wouldn’t be seen and drew his wand, holding firm to his arm as he conjured his Patronus. The stately stag appeared and stood before them, regal even in its wispy form, waiting.
Once again, Potter turned the tables on him.  Shy and earnest dissolved into a slow, sexy smile that transformed his face completely, and made Draco’s mouth go dry.
Potter nodded slowly.
“No one cooks like you, Molly. I’ve been damned near all over England, Scotland and America, and no one makes scrambled eggs like you do.”
“He’s very cute.”
Of course, he thought. Of course it would be him. Why was it that they seemed to find one another in loo's when one or the other of them was at a low point? Hermione mentioned he would be in attendance, something about this being a cause he was deeply invested in, but Harry had doubted they'd even have reason to speak. Stupid, that.
He felt something on his arm, and turned back to find the child tugging on the sleeve of his hoodie. “Yes?”
Hoping to catch Harry off guard, he jerked at the harsh grip and began to struggle, but he should have known better. Harry was larger, stronger, healthier. Within moments Draco was breathing hard and near tears. And then Harry took another step in, and his sturdy thigh pressed between Draco’s legs, pressing insistently into his groin, and his chest flattened against where Draco’s heart struggled to burst free, and he went still, suddenly bathed in heat. He could smell him; God help him, he could smell the cologne and he recognized it. Because he had given it to him.
She forced a weary smile. “Maybe once the surgery is over. Or if you ever decide to teach another trainee class in America.”
Draco, unfazed, smirked at him. “But you, my dear, are not. Nor are you covered in freckles. Nor do you have ginger pubes…”
She grinned. “Dad, you picked me up at the station.”
The burrow felt relatively empty on this last Sunday before Christmas. It was only Ron, Hermione and their children, and Harry and Draco along with Arthur and Molly. Next weekend the hoards would descend, but this week was fairly quiet. Draco followed Harry and little Hugo, his arm slipping around Hermione’s waist.
“And because your team kicked Slytherin’s arse,” Pansy added.
“Not bad, I don’t think,” Harry answered.  “But who really knows.”
” she said finally, looking up at Harry. “Harry, have you ever heard of the
Draco nodded, his lips slightly parted. “Oh, yes.”
“Ah, but he is,” Ron said, holding up his cocoa. Two more cups had appeared, along with another that was much smaller and piled high with tiny marshmallows. “Even if he is stubbly.”
"Don't bite my tongue," Harry leaned back long enough to warn.
She grinned at him, pulling one of the doors open with apparent ease and letting him walk through in front of her. Once they were in the cavernous entry hall, and the castle’s warmth brushed over his face, Harry let out an audible sigh. It was as if he was being pulled into Hogwarts embrace.
Harry’s frown deepened, and he opened his mouth.
"Admit it. You stroke off to the thought of the smell of a crowded locker room, don't you?"
Harry shook his head, holding up one hand. “Could we stay with one subject at a time? I know
“The one who teaches Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts? The half giant, right?”
“You never were very good at that,” she said, one brow arching. He narrowed his eyes, then reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her down onto the bed until they were a giggling tangle of arms and legs. It took several moments for their laughter to subside. Finally, Hermione lay beside him on one side and Rose across his stomach, her elbows planted on his chest and her chin propped on her hands.
“I like the sound of that,” he said, his hand stroking him. “Next time.”
Prompt for this chapter:
“It was cool, huh?” he said brightly. He looked up at Narcissa, who had joined them on his other side. “Auntie, can I light the plum pudding with Draco’s wand?”
“Loved her, yes. Wanted her? Not so much, as it turns out. And you’ve always wanted Malfoy.”
“Can’t I?” Draco responded with a look very like Scorpius’s, and his son grinned at him as he dug into his Shepard’s Pie. He let the boy get half way through his lunch before he speared him with a direct look. “So, have you any intention of telling me what you’re actually doing here?”
Draco gasped into his mouth.
Hermione watched Harry’s broad back, his head lowered, as he turned and left the small room where they’d been watching Ron interrogate Macmillan. This was hard on Harry, she knew; doubly hard because partners are supposed to have each other’s back, not betray one another. She sighed, and turned back to the window.
Harry felt like he’d been holding his breath ever since he’d sent Phaedra to Malfoy. The beautiful white bird, very similar to Hedwig in appearance except larger and a good deal bitchier, was even now asleep on her perch in his office, her attitude rendering her above perching with the other birds in the owlery, at least in her own opinion. Harry knew he indulged her, but he didn’t care. She reminded him so much of his old friend that he could deal with her idiosyncrasies.
“He won’t have the chance. He’s being disciplined by his department, whatever that means. He ought to be worried about his mother. She’s going to be livid when she hears about this. And Molly is scarier than Kingsley.”
"Now," she said, leaning against the lift wall. "Talk to me."
“Now, why do we take the gift to her house, again, when she just brings it back to ours Christmas morning?”
That had been the wrong thing to say. Malfoy straightened to his full height, his eyes sparkling with temper. It was a good look on him. The prat.
Harry, who had kept reading, gasped and looked up at Hermione. “This is it,” he said. “Hermione, you are brilliant!”
“Friday”
“Do you mean the nearly nude angel, or the ectoplasm?”
"We're just commenting on how good you look," she said. "It's good that you're changing things up a bit, and getting out."
His hands were trembling slightly when he opened the flap and pulled the card from the inside. He swallowed heavily before he turned it over and read what was written on it.
Harry heard what he thought might be her mother’s smothered giggle.
Harry chuckled. “That does seem to be the problem.” He gave her an amused arch of a brow. “I don’t suppose you’re ready to hang up the green robes and come teach for me?”
“Thank you. I think.” Harry gave him a wry look.
Draco seemed to become aware of Hermione and Ron for the first time.
She shushed him. “The way he looks at you? I think you’re mistaken.” She patted him on the back then straightened away. “Go on with you, now.”
“Harry, you should have told us you were coming home!”
It hadn’t made Harry feel any better.
Draco stared. “To save my life.”
"You're staring," he said, sitting on the edge of the bed and carefully cleaning Harry's stomach and the inside of his thighs before taking the soiled flannel and tossing it into an empty laundry hamper. He heard Harry laugh behind him. "What?"
Draco stayed very still as Harry touched the child’s head fondly, then looked back up at him. “Very cool,” he said softly, and Draco’s heart began to pound. Was it even remotely possible that Harry didn’t hate him? Gods, if the situation had been reversed, he’d have been reaching for his wand, hexing him into oblivion. But then, of the two of them, Harry had always been kinder, more patient… Draco’s throat thickened.
Harry spotted him instantly, long lean frame bent over his sleek quidditch broom at the point of the vee. His white blond hair blew back from his handsome face, shining like a silver flag. It needed cutting, Harry thought, but he could see why he didn't; it was certainly striking and the bastard loved the attention. His little fangirls, the ones who threw their hotel room keys and panties and chanted his name, were probably creaming said panties on sight of him, Harry thought uncharitably. When the team pulled out of formation and came to hover near the official at centre pitch, the seeker sat back on his broom as it floated easily the air. He hooked one of his long legs over the top of the broom and reached up to pull the fine, sleek hair back into an elastic he had around his wrist. He curled it into a messy 'man bun', a term that always made Harry sneer. However, with a few strands falling around his sculpted features and the messy knot at his crown, it was undeniably sexy. Very sexy. Harry felt a stirring in his groin, and the cheeky tosser gave him a knowing side-eye.
"In here."
Draco nodded. “I don’t remember exactly what it said; just something about how I wasn’t good enough for you.” Draco shrugged. “I thought it was a joke. You know, something the twins would say. I didn’t think too much of it…”
"How did you get here?" Harry asked, closing the door. Draco stood in the centre of the entry, looking around with his hands on his hips.
Harry threw back his head and laughed, and Draco admired the long line of his throat, the broad, square set of his shoulders.
Harry forced himself to look, knowing in advance what he'd see. Kiernan O'Conner was standing at his table, feet planted and arms crossed. The smirk on his face made Harry's skin crawl. Kieran drunk was an unpleasant thing to be around; he didn't hit, but his mouth was vicious enough.
Draco’s jaw worked. He set aside the tape and leaned back on his hands.
“I don’t mean to be rude, Minister,” Hermione interrupted, “but we’re terribly concerned about our friend.”
Malfoy gave him an amused look. “Poor Potter. The tropical climate ruined you for England?”
Harry chuckled. “Must’ve been life-altering.”
“Of course, we’d have loved to have Harry,” Kingsley agreed.
"Blah, blah, blah," Harry muttered. "Go to sleep."
Harry felt the mattress sag at his side and Draco was there, tie gone, white shirt open at the throat and rolled up at the cuffs. He leaned close to examine the burn once again, and a swath of pale hair fell over his forehead. Gods, he was beautiful still, his long throat unlined, the pale skin stretched taut over his jaw and his cheekbones. There were a few, slight lines around his eyes, and he cursed them but Harry loved them. To him, those were the echoes of the smiles they’d shared over the years , and he valued each and every one.
“A convenient fuck.” Aaron threw the blankets back and stood, grabbing his jeans off the floor and stepping into them, yanking them up over his bare hips.
Harry smirked. “Well, look at it this way; if something goes wrong, you can always Apparate out.”
“Draco,” Harry insisted. “Please.”
“I’m fine,” he said quickly, and she arched one heavily tweezed brow at him.
Draco turned and continued his walk, the corners of his mouth pulled down in a scowl.
“Draco.”
Harry ignored the question. “How’d you even know about the ring, Denny? I didn’t tell very many people…”
The Hall was already crowded when Harry walked in, but Teddy immediately noticed him, jumping up from his seat and waving wildly. Harry grinned, walking to a spot near the front of the room at the Gryffindor table, looking at the four boys who sat there.
"I'd not thought of it, honestly," Harry said, "or I might've. Actually," he paused, feeling suddenly extremely awkward, "we've errr…come up with a better idea."
“I’m the best man,” he announced, and delighted laughter flowed through the room. Ginny and Luna pushed forward, babbling their delight, but McGonagall raised her hand, palm out and silence fell again. “Decorum, ladies and gentleman, if you please.” She straightened and looked at Harry and Draco. “Dearly beloved,” she said again, “we are gathered here to celebrate the marriage of Harry James Potter and Draco Abraxas Malfoy…”
Harry stared at the words even as they blurred, and he blinked quickly to clear his vision.
“Aren’t they cute?” Molly preened.
“Weasley-Granger,” he snapped out. “Whatever.”
Now he looked at it hanging there, and wondered why he hadn’t tossed it out with the man. He hesitated for a moment, then shrugged and pulled it from the hanger, folding it and tossing it into the open trunk. Who knew when he might need an ugly Christmas sweater? And he could always put it on under a hoodie if it was cold enough. Which reminded him –
"Trust me, the man we're referring to is very sweet, but I'd be more likely to believe the Muggle Prime Minister managed to hover on a broom and take those shots."
…he came awake as his wand began to buzz on his bedside table, his morning alarm.
Finally, Malfoy crossed his long legs in a show of casualness. “I’d wondered, you know.”
Now it was three in the morning, according to the chiming of the grandfather clock in the downstairs entryway, the tones drifting almost eerily up the stairs. The lights in the nursery were dimmed, and the only sound was the slight squeaking of the chair as Harry rocked gently on the hardwood floor.
Draco rolled his eyes and went back to his paper. “Apparently.”
Harry fell back onto his elbows with a sigh. He shouldn’t be surprised; he knew that. There had been no promises made on either side. In fact, there’d been almost no conversation afterwards at all. But as Harry’d rolled to his side and Draco nuzzled in against his chest, Harry had allowed himself to
“I did leave,” Potter admitted.  And he stopped, looking shamefaced.
oooFINISooo
The picture on the front was of a man, from the back, clearly naked but for a Santa hat on his head. He had very square shoulders, and a tapered back, the upper curves of his bare arse just visible. He was holding a sprig of mistletoe over his shoulder on a piece of green ribbon, right in the middle of his back, and the implication could not have been clearer.
The words created a surge of unpleasant electricity that streaked down his spine. Harry’s mouth went dry, and he stared at the envelope in Kingsley’s large hand, the green monogram seeming to glow against the ecru background.
“But, you’ll be here, and – “
Draco let the tip of his fingers slip just under the sleeve of Harry’s green jumper. “So she has – Harry.”
The old woman snorted. “I’m sure he is.”
“Oh, we Slytherin’s aren’t so bad,” Draco commented.  “We’ll win you over in the end.”
He shrugged. “Just the regular one. Macmillan was easy.” He made a scoffing sound in his throat. “You people really should be more selective about who you let into the Aurors corps. That one is a light weight.”
“Mr. Potter has history with the presiding specialist.”
“Oh, well, of course. And you being ‘Harry Potter’ had nothing to do with it? You do love to toss that superiority around, don’t you, Potter?”
The big voice boomed out in the crisp air, and Harry turned to see the half giant making his laborious way down the steps leading to his large hut. He moved slowly, limping on his left side, and the joy Harry felt on seeing him morphed into concern.
Potter smiled back, lips curling.  “Yes, sir.”
He sat heavily on the end of the bed beside her. “Not a ghost.” He flopped back on the bed, his hands above his head. “Merlin, Hermione. I’m such a fucking idiot.”
“Something else seemed so much more important,” Harry filled in for her. “Anything seemed so much more important.”
“Better?” Harry asked him wryly.
"About half an hour."
“And if you ever want to finish what we started this afternoon, you’ll put it right back in the ‘things I need never mention’ file,” Harry warned. Draco didn’t look deterred a bit. “So,” Harry said after another big bite of cake, “speaking of press I don’t want, how many students were standing around the entry when you levitated me up the stairs?”
She smiled, still studying him, her head angled to one side.
“Right now I’m more concerned with your arse.” Harry twisted his fingers aned curled them, finding the spot that had Draco’s back arching, a soft cry coming from his lips. “Ah, there’s the spot.”
“I can’t just drop in to see you?” Harry asked, suddenly and painfully aware of the number of people who were staring at them. There was no place Harry could go within the wizarding world where he felt his continued fame quite like within the Ministry. He’d pulled his fringe down over his forehead, worn contacts and even dressed a good decade younger than he had any right to, and still everyone stared. Even in Diagon, or Hogsmeade, or even in the halls of Hogwarts, people were not nearly as obvious about staring as they were here. Staring, and whispering, and it made his skin crawl.
kid. Then there's Dean, but I think Seamus might protest. As a matter of fact, if you think about it, Gin…"
Harry’s shoulders tightened. “I don’t know that,” he said. “I might know them.”
He nodded, and she went into the kitchen. He could hear her talking, but he stared into the fireplace, reliving each minute of his time in the Room of Requirement, startled by the painful longing it had launched. By the time she came back, it felt as if something brittle and jagged was broken in there, leaving him wounded and bleeding. She took one look at his face and instead of the chair, she sat down beside him.
“Alone at last,” he murmured, stepping closer. “I’ve wanted to kiss you for hours.”
“Of course you won’t,” she muttered as she took the tray into the kitchen.
“I’ll walk you as far as the courtyard, then.”
Ron handed his wife a glass of wine and gestured with his head. “The one night of the year I crawl into this bloody suit, and that wanker shows up looking like that and no one will even notice.”
“Why am I out here?” she asked for the tenth time.
Their eyes held for a long moment. “Thank you for that,” Malfoy murmured, cheeks even more pink.
“I gather relocating was why you couldn’t be bothered to testify at any of the trials.” Draco hated that he sounded so bitter, but it had been his default mood for a long time, damn it. Between him and his mother, they’d saved Potter’s skin at least twice. Of course, if one started keeping count, Draco knew he was at a disadvantage. Flying him out of a room engulfed in fiendfyre had been heroic enough to clear the slate, even before Potter had off’d Voldemort.
Draco sputtered. “Pushy.”
Draco studied them, walking carefully from animal to animal. After a few minutes, he came back to Harry, his expression thoughtful.
Hermione leaned forward on her elbows. "Harry, Scorpius' first class of the day is Herbology. After I heard that there were rumors circulating, I went to Neville and asked him if he'd," she shrugged one shoulder, a bit awkward, "heard anything. Or noticed anything off about how they were behaving."
Harry’s eyes widened. “Wow.”
Harry took him at his word and let himself go, driving into him in a punishing pace. The bed began to squeak and the headboard bounce off of the wall, and still Draco urged him to go harder, faster. Just when it became too much, when his balls began to tighten and Harry felt pressure building at the base of his spine, Draco cried out and stiffened, shuddering in his arms. Harry felt the warm wetness of Draco’s release between them just as his own orgasm spilled from him and he cried out, his back locking, his body shaking as he came harder than he could ever remember. It seemed to last a long time, and they strained together until almost as one, they fell limp, their breathing loud and ragged, their bodies trembling with exertion.
"That's my girl," Ron muttered. "You should've followed her advice." The look Hermione gave him would've pealed skin off of a lesser man.
Harry exchanged a look with Ron, and Ron rolled his eyes behind his wife’s back. Harry managed, just, not to laugh.
“Where are the boys?” Harry asked, lifting Benji and setting him on his feet, holding on to him long enough to make sure he was steady.
~***~
"There is that. Well, don't just stand there, then. Let him in."
and straightened. “Yes. With an ear infection. It’s still minor, but I’d recommend ear drops for the pain and some oral anti-infection potions.” Sudden inspiration struck, and he looked into the little girl’s wide green eyes. It wasn’t actually unethical; his mentor at University recommended testing blood for all childhood infections when the patient was under five due to the resurgence of Dragon Pox. Or course, she didn’t have any of the symptoms, but still…“If you’re agreeable, we should probably take some blood as well, just to make sure there isn’t any underlying infection. Dragon Pox is going around.”
Pansy watched him until he was out through the front door and it was closed behind him before she allowed herself to chuckle.  Turning on her heel, she crossed into her office and scooped her mobile up off of the top of her desk, punching in Draco’s number with a long, red-laquered fingernail.  When his voice mail picked up, she rolled her eyes.
“Potter is Headmaster at Hogwarts,” Draco answered, and Gods, how those words stung, even to just say them. “Granger is a Healer. Is her husband with them?”
Harry inhaled sharply, then wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him in. Draco finally gave up and dropped his arms around Harry’s waist.
He knew it was true, and he felt guilty. "I'm sorry, Hermione. I know I've been an arse, and you bear the brunt of it."
“You look mad,” she said. “Like this.” She made an exaggerated face and Harry smiled.
Harry gave her a slightly mortified look. “I didn’t even think about that.”
“Professor Malfoy?” she said hesitantly.
“Yeah, he is. And I don’t think the apple fell very far from the tree.”
Almost as soon as the tingle of the spell had finished, there was a soft pop above their heads and a shower of gold and red and silver and green glitter rained down on them, sticking to their hair and their clothes. Draco looked up in surprise, and saw that the mistletoe was gone.
Applause broke out behind them, but they didn’t hear it. They’d find out later Hermione had started it. All Harry knew was that Draco had said yes. He smiled, so wide it made his cheeks ache, and he stood. He took Draco’s left hand and slid the ring onto his third finger, then pulled him into his arms, closing them around him tight. His heart swelled when he felt his fiancé trembling.
“Wine?” He arched a brow at her, and she smacked his arm. “Not for me, you idiot, although my Healer said there’s no risk at this point. Still… for you.”
"What are you doing?"
Teddy sat straight up, his eyes as wide as if Draco had poked him with a pin. “A train?” he said, his voice high with excitement. “We’re going on a train?”
At first he thought he imagined the voice, he’d wanted to hear it so much. Then came another.
Draco started to speak, but Harry kissed him, silencing him effectively. The baby was patting them both on the cheeks when the odd suction experience from before happened again, and this time they were both pulled out in a rush of strong air. Vision Draco and Harry, and their baby girl, were both gone when the Room of Requirement door slammed and disappeared.
“Yes, Master Draco?”
“I’ll be right there, Ted. Pick up whatever you dropped.” His eyes came back to Draco’s, and there was both regret and resignation in them. “I had other things in mind for tonight,” he murmured, his hands sliding up and down Draco’s arms. “But Andromeda flooed and asked if I could take Teddy. She’s not feeling well. I told him we’d make cookies.” There was another crash inside, and Harry chuckled wearily. “If he doesn’t demolish my kitchen.” He turned his head once more. “Ted,” he called emphatically. “Wait for me.”
The animal nodded his head regally, then disappeared, and Harry stuck his hands back into his jackets pockets as he stood outside the gates, bouncing slightly in place as the breeze caught a long strand of his hair, whipping it across his face.
When Draco emerged from the back room a few moments later, he was wearing a black hip length pea coat, and yes, his legs were longer, and a black knit cap pulled down over his ears and forehead. Just the barest bit of fringe brushed his eyebrows and ears, and even just that bit of pale blond looked soft. Harry wanted to touch it, and he jammed his hands into his jeans pockets to keep himself from doing anything so painfully stupid. Draco gestured in front of him.
Harry opened his eyes and turned to face him. “Why?”
“Of course!” She said, her eyes moving rapidly over the page. “I knew it was something in violation of
“Of course. Welcome, Thomas.” She gave Draco a sweet smile.
"I'm not going to accuse him of anything," Ron growled. "I'm trying to look out for you. You are the one with the most to lose in this, Harry."
“Brilliant,” he said, starting across the street. “Bloody brilliant.”
"Gracefully done," Ron said with an impish grin. "Feel up to a seat at the head table?"
Harry hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, we are.”
Phipps had been a hundred and fifty if he’d been a day, and every conversation began with, “well, back in my day we did it” this way, or that way, and reminding the old fart there’d been two wars and hundreds of fatalities since did absolutely nothing. He was all about blood purity and squib discrimination, (‘
Harry shrugged. “Didn’t know I was going for charming. I just want you to tell me what’s wrong.”
Harry straightened, frown deepening. “Okay, what the hell is going on? Now, Minister, if you please.”
The fact he and Gin were better friends and parents since the divorce said a lot about their marriage. Molly justified their separation by saying 'they'd been too young', (which they had) and that the war had left too much heartache behind. That was true, too, but there was more to it than that. The only job Harry ever really considered was being an Auror, and he was damned good at it. He'd loved Gin, and he loved the kids, but he was Head Auror the way she was a Quidditch player; to the marrow of his bones.
"Ronald!" Hermione sounded aghast, and Harry wasn't sure which she was more upset by; her husband's comment, or Harry's ex.
“Well, yes. He’s rather
“Are you Harry's someone?” Teddy had repeated.  “My Gramma Tonks told me that there's someone for everyone, and that Harry's someone would probably not be a lady.”  Draco heard a faintly suffocated sound coming from behind him, but he didn't break eye contact with Ted.  “You and Harry seem to have fun together, and you're always whispering and kissing and stuff when you think I'm not looking, and I was just wondering if you were his someone.”  The boy shrugged, but Draco had a sudden feeling it meant more to him than he was letting on.
“’Cuz she gets cross with me.”
“She likes you,” Harry said. Draco touched the little girl’s forehead and found her cool to the touch.
“Don’t be silly. You were a tri-wizard champion, and she lived off of stories about how you relieved her of her virginity for months.”
"M A C," Draco corrected politely. "M A C capital I N T O S H."
“BP normal, pain levels registering within acceptable levels,” a woman wearing colorful Christmas scrubs answered, her face kind. She wore a surgical hat identical to Malfoy’s. “The anesthesia is wearing off a little more quickly than I’ve seen before.”
Draco watched him go, thinking how much he’d grown in just the last twelve months. He’d gone from just past toddler to little boy, and part of Draco mourned the loss. The other part of him enjoyed the bright, infectious six year old who loved to climb trees and was already a terror on a training broom. He and Harry both enjoyed the time they spent flying with Teddy on the pitch when it was unoccupied, and Draco couldn’t think of a better place for him to practice. As long as he did it supervised; they’d already had that conversation at least twice that he was aware of, and he had a sneaking suspicion Harry and Ted hadn’t told him everything.
“Sorry to disappoint.” Harry narrowed his eyes. “I was wondering the same thing about you, actually.”
“Winky will try, Harry Potter.”
Draco’s lips quirked up in a smile. “Is he driving you spare?”
Draco was wearing white velvet robes trimmed with white fur, over a shimmering silver tunic that was belted around the hips with a heavy chain link belt, and he seemed to glow, standing there in the doorway. His hair was very nearly the color of the fur, and the velvet coat was accented down each side to the hem with silver stitching and small diamonds that glittered when he moved. “All here? Good, let’s gather in the solarium, then.” He lifted one arm, and the silver sleeves were so long they nearly brushed the floor.
“Kill joy,” Ron muttered, and she smirked.
Harry and Ron walked from the Apparition point through a quiet, charming neighborhood on the outskirts of Ottery St. Catchpole. Apparating had been as disconcerting and nauseating as Harry remembered, but fortunately Ron’s skills had improved. They arrived with all of their parts intact.
"Not much," Harry said, and went back to it.
“She is. A very nice person. Whose taste is all in her mouth.”
“This has been rather sudden. I wasn’t expecting house guests.”
"Molly is always worried; you know that."
“You scream like a girl,” he baited Harry, grinning.
Hermione’s mouth went dry. “What do you have to do?”
“But… that’s turmeric. It’s what makes the paste yellow.”
“Yes. Oh.” He walked forward and sat on the bench, not close but nor far away, either. “I was really afraid of it before. It was why I left.”
“Oh, please. I barely touched you. You plan to take my arm, or are we going to stand here until someone bows us over?”
“He got married?” Harry asked weakly. She nodded.
"A man who is killing a Dark Lord, pardon my saying, Master Draco."
Harry opened one of the doors of the armoire and took out a hanger, slipping his jacket onto it.
“Yes,” he said firmly, squeezing Potter's hand. “They're obnoxious and rude, and you handled them beautifully. I'm fine.”
She rolled her eyes. "Thank you so very much."
"Dad," Jamie said, sounding scandalized. "Did Mum know you spent all those months in a tent alone with Aunt Hermione? It's just, Aunt Hermione is kind of beautiful, you know?"
Draco looked at the envelope in his hand. “Are you going to open that?” he asked archly. Harry sighed, but slid his fingers under the fold.
“No, actually. It doesn’t,” Hermione said, lifting her wand. “Just ignore them,” she whispered to the wide-eyed little boy, who was watching his grandfather and Harry with a worried frown between his eyes. “They’ve been squabbling like this since they weren’t much older than you. One would have thought they’d have outgrown it by now.”
“But it’s a
“You, too, Harry Potter. Definitely a surprise.”
Now the only blond he’d ever really wanted had indicated he’d be amenable to drinks at least, and Harry had no bloody idea how to ask him to go. He got up and wandered around his quarters, his hands in his pockets, frowning as he stared at the floor. Flowery words and clever phrases were not his style, they never had been. He walked over to the large cage in the corner that held his snowy owl, Lena. He’d named her after Helena Ravenclaw, because she had a soft gray tinge to the underside of her feathers, and he’d never forget the help the ‘Gray Lady’ had given him during the siege of Hogwarts. He thought he’d never own another owl after Hedwig was killed, but once again it was Hermione who’d changed his mind, and who’d gifted him with the gentle little owl for his thirtieth birthday. He opened the cage door and reached out, and she rubbed her head against his hand.
Teddy whooped. “Excellent!
Harry straightened. He looked at Ron. "Where do we start?"
“Oh,” Draco sighed when the fullness of Harry’s weight had settled on him. He spread his legs and lifted his knees, and Harry’s hips fell naturally between them. “Oh, God. You have no idea how good you feel, and how I’ve missed this.”
“I will be doing this, Harry Potter. You can be relaxing after working all day.”
the paper said another time. That wasn’t true either, although to Draco it had sounded like something the berk would do; off to save yet another populace from evil, the arrogant sod. Like no one else could do it.
“They were done, anyway, Dad.”
“They’re darlings, they really are.” Molly leaned forward earnestly. “They’re just a bit… high spirited.”
“Of course, Harry.” Seconds later Clara was there in the doorway beside Miss Penny, and her look was so imperious that Goldie had little choice but to follow her. Harry rolled his eyes at Penny, who grinned at him and handed his charge over.
A sharp rap sounded on the window behind him and Draco jumped, startled. He turned and saw a large barn owl hovering outside the window, looking at him reproachfully.
Malfoy finally exhaled heavily. “I believe you. You apparently haven’t outgrown the impulse to be heroic.”
“I’ve thought about that. I’ll say his parents are friends of Hermione and Ron’s daughter, Rose, who are out of country on business. He’s living nearby with his gran.”
She hesitated less than a second before she was nodding. Harry didn’t hear the incantation, but he watched as Draco ran his wand the length of the divot in her skin, and the muscle and flesh knitted closed before his eyes.
"I don't much care how it looks to you." Draco took a deep breath, clearly trying to control himself. "Harry, I have to go." He could see Draco was looking around for something, and he spotted his hawthorne wand on the nightstand nearest the door. Harry grabbed it up before Draco could move.
“Draco, I’ve dated. Quite a bit, and I imagine you have, too.” Draco felt his cheeks heat. Yes, before Teddy, he’d dated rather a lot. “What if I don’t want to date, any more. What if what I want,” he paused, as if to make sure Draco was paying attention, “is a family?”
“So, I like blonds,” Harry said defensively. “So what?”
“Up to you. I’ve got to get going. A bunch of George’s new inventions arrive today, and if I’m not there, he’ll start trying them out on the stock clerks. He calls it ‘quality control’.” Harry wasn’t sure if it was the sight of Ron making air quotes, or the idea of George sneaking up on his staff to try out his madness, but Harry laughed.
"Don't joke," Harry said softly. "This is the thing I'm most ashamed of."
“You wanted to be an Auror.”
“Ron,
She shook her head. “He’s out walking with Rosie and Bludger.”
“Humility is reserved for those who are not stunning. For us, it's just silly.”
“They were grieving their own loss.” She didn’t scold, but he felt like she should. He’d forgot all about the lost twin.
Now that he thought about it, Harry wasn’t even surprised. He rolled the bottle between his palms. “And?”
"I gather she was…I don't know, Draco – what is the right word? Complicit?"
“It’s -- yeah, fine, okay.” Draco could scarcely form coherent words. The feeling of Harry’s hand on him, slightly callused, and his cock, hard and thick against Draco’s, robbed any thought of lucidity. When he began to stroke them together, Draco groaned in a sound so wanton he couldn’t believe it had come from his own mouth.
Once the massive cake was set in place, Potter made a series of complicated motions with his wand and at least two dozen petite fours lifted from the box and before his eyes, enlarged to the size of small muffins, then climbed in a spiral to curl around the tiers, small rotating chocolate satellites. Potter slipped his wand into his sleeve and was Vanishing the white bakery boxes when Draco dropped his hands into his pockets and approached him on silent feet.
“So what do you want to do?” Harry asked, sounding hoarse as the lithe figure came to him.
“Yeah. Probably.” Harry rocked back on his heels. The silence in the room was stifling after that, and Harry had about decided to go get himself a drink when the flames flared brilliant green. Harry looked toward the grandfather clock on the far wall; Hermione was five minutes early. She was always precisely on time, but rarely early. When her face appeared and Harry saw the serious, hard line of her jaw, his throat felt thick. Harry saw Draco’s shoulders stiffen, and he dropped down into a crouch on the hearth, trying to block her serious expression from Draco’s view.
Sheila covered the toddler with a soft blanket. “I’ve no idea, Mr. Potter. The bird was pecking at the kitchen window when I went down for some tea.”
It was later, when they setting the table and the kids were running around the flat from a pursuing Ted, squealing, when Hermione caught Harry’s arm.
"Potter," he said, his posh voice lower, smoother than Harry remembered. "Fancy meeting you here."
“Harry,” Hermione said a bit more insistently, and he paused, lifting his eyes to hers.  She was watching him with a slight crease between her brows.  “You’re not seriously considering using Parkinson, are you?”
Large, square hands slid up Draco’s pale thighs, the skin shades darker on the fingers than on the legs. His face a mask of concentration, Potter studied the tenting in the black cotton y-fronts, then reached forward with one of his hands and ran his fingers over the straining arc. Draco gasped, his hips jerking, and Potter looked up at him with a slight smile, then still holding his gaze, leaned forward and very carefully, skimmed the bulge with his straight, even white teeth.
a different cake than what was delivered.”
“The pattern doesn’t make sense, then,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Nineteen ninety-seven, but then not until now.”
“Huh,” he muttered, still confused.  He set it aside when he saw that there was a card in the bottom of the box, and once again, he lifted it out.
"Try catching the Snitch; that might help for starters."
, he’d argued with his reflection in the mirror.
She reached across the table and took his hand, linking their fingers. “He’s been there pretty much forever, hasn’t he?”
"Oh, just don't speak. You only make it worse. Come back here." He slid his hand up Harry's back and neck, long fingers sinking into his hair. He clutched it hard.
His hair was tousled and he quickly ran his fingers through it, but that didn't take away the lines at the edge of his eyes or the pallor from his cheeks. He looked old, he thought with dismay. Old, and tired. He used a quick glamour, smoothing out the wrinkles and putting a bit of color into his cheeks, and it helped a small amount but still… He was a forty-one-year-old man, and he looked every inch of it.
"You were gone so long, I was afraid you were really in trouble," Scorpius panted. He looked at Harry. "It was my idea, Mr Potter, honestly."
“I don’t want you to go home,” she said, her voice shaking. “Even if you do have pink sheeps. I want you to stay here forever. If you go back, I’ll never see you again.”
“You did.”
Ron grinned. “Aye, the woman loves me. She can’t help it; I’m irresistible.”
With that, there was a pop, and the Nutcracker was gone. Draco’s knees felt weak, and he sat heavily on one of the two white chairs that faced the fireplace, his face in his hands.
Inside, Draco sighed. He supposed they were going to have to discuss bloody Potter, whether he wanted to or not.
The smile Harry received in response was one of those slow growing ones, the kind that start with the lips but end up lighting the eyes. Draco pushed back his stool, took two slow, hip led strides that took him to Harry and spread his long legs, lowering himself to straddle Harry’s lap. He lifted his arms around Harry’s neck and smiled almost shyly into Harry eyes.
“Look at me, Harry!” The little boy said brightly. “I’m the sun! Cool, huh?”
Harry avoided Draco’s narrowed eyes. “She had bigger issues to deal with today. The Hufflepuff keeper ran into one of the rings during practice and broke his shoulder. I wasn’t going to go take attention away with a minor hex burn.”
He turned back to Mrs. Figg. “But, it’s empty…”
“So do you,” Draco answered, breathless.
"They do seem to get younger and younger, don't they?" she muttered, slipping the cape from her shoulders, then straightening them with a toss of her head and a determined air. "Firewhisky on the rocks?" She glanced over at him, one brow raised.
“Shall I have coffee sent up?”
“No, Scorpius.” Draco’s temper got the best of him again, but his son showed no signs of backing down. “I couldn’t. There’s no point in setting myself up for the inevitable disappointment.” Draco leaned forward, lowering his voice. “I’ve been working in the Muggle world for nearly twenty years. I’m no longer even up on the latest potions and ingredients.”
“Has anyone even been inside Grimmauld Place?”
Draco pushed at his fringe again nervously, irritated that his hand was trembling. He fisted it and dropped it to his lap, hoping she hadn’t seen, but doubting it. She’s always been annoyingly observant. He cleared his throat.
Harry was in physical therapy the next morning, his back screaming as he pressed up with his hips and held the position while Ronan, his therapist, counted to twenty as slowly as was humanly possible.
On the very top was a note from his mother. He could recite it by heart without even breaking the seal.
"Thank you!" he said triumphantly. "What have you got."
Isaac’s eyes came back to Draco. “I have something that might interest you too, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry could only agree.
Hermione kept her feelings to herself as they toured to first floor, but when they started up the rickety staircase and it protested loudly beneath their weight, apparently she had gone as far as she could in silence. “Harry, good Lord.” She batted at cobwebs hanging from the balustrade. “What were you thinking?”
She looked stunned. "You hate being Minister."
oooOOOooo
"This is so much more convenient than the mobile."
Draco groaned and his arms came up around Harry's torso, his hands curling in the red wool of his Auror jacket. He pulled back just enough to speak against Harry's cheek. "You're an arse."
"No, they don't. At least, Albus doesn't. I have no idea if you've discussed where your scars came from or not."
His mother’s smile widened. “No, you had gold stars. Don’t you remember? I used to put them on the calendar. Every day that you were good, you got a gold star. On the days when you were not…”
“Her name was Merry,” Draco answered, surprised by how hoarse he sounded. Potter’s hand felt warm around his wrist, the touch almost painfully intimate. “Merry Barnstable. She owned the shop and left it to me when she died.”
"Dad?"
Why the bloody hell hadn’t he fixated on that? They wanted to appeal his sentence. Potter and Granger, possibly the two best known and widely respected people in the Wizarding world, wanted to go before the Wizengamot and appeal his sentence. Perhaps it was the enormity of it that made staring at Potter so much simpler. But once he’d got home, changed into pyjama’s and made a pot of tea, and was curled on his sofa with his cup in his hands, he’d been unable to think of anything else. They were going to speak for him, Granger the Healer and Potter the giant killer, were going to speak for him. He couldn’t allow himself to hope, because hope was painful, but the possibilities spread out before him like a banquet of wonders; to have his wand be more than a paper weight, to show his son he truly was a talented wizard, to walk the halls of Hogwarts. Oh, Gods; to walk the halls of Hogwarts.
"You look so much better!” Hermione said when she walked into the bedroom Harry had already come to think of as his. He put down the book he’d been reading and smiled at her. “And you’re reading! Be still my heart.”
He couldn’t really retaliate to that.
“Harry,” she implored.
Pansy studied him for a long moment, a smile beginning to curl across her lips. “Would this be for the Savior himself?”
“Mad? The only mad man I see is you, Potter.” He spit Harry’s last name the way he used to, and something in Harry’s chest began to ache. He didn’t want to go back to that place, to that animosity.
She waited a few beats, until his skin crawled with the delay.
The door opened almost immediately. "Minister?" Ron said diffidently, and Harry knew immediately he wasn't alone.
Draco scarcely had time to process the amazing words. Potter was patient, thorough, but the very meticulousness with which he kissed Draco made it impossible for him to think beyond the pounding of his heart and the swelling cock in his trousers. There was too much else to process; the skilled lips, the soft breath, the tongue that never felt invasive and tasted faintly of peppermint and gingerbread. The scent of spicy cologne and the heat of the chest pressing against his arm. Draco shifted in the seat when Potter pulled him closer, turning so that their chests were together and lifting his hand from Potters leg to slide it around his side. Potter pulled back for just a moment, using his teeth to pull his glove from his fingers, then slipped his hand under the fur and Draco felt his fingers deftly opening the buttons down the front of his coat. When he slid his hand inside and pressed it over Draco’s flat stomach and the heat of it penetrated through the jumper to the skin beneath, Draco made a soft sound of pleasure.
“How soon do you want to do this?” Hermione pressed.  Harry shrugged.
. I said to Floo…”
"No." Harry studied him carefully. "I'd very much like you to stay. I just hate waking up to a cold, empty bed."
“I was actually thinking more like three hundred.” George smirked. “If it makes you feel any better, the Minister is less than pleased.”
“I – that would be… nice,” Harry finally managed, his voice dry.
Draco rolled his eyes, secretly pleased. “Well, if Weaslbee can do it…”
“He doesn’t, not really,” he said, his voice rough. “But we go way back. It’s probably more about common history than anything. But it was nice of him to try to come to your rescue.”
"Because it's… dignified, maybe?" Ron shrugged, letting his Auror robe fall from his shoulders. "Much better than Fudge in his tatty tweeds and bowler hats. Think about it; can you imagine turning up at the Ministry in that?" he gestured toward his new jacket, grinning. "Might be worth it just to see how everyone reacted."
“This will be conducted in a civil manner,” he said resolutely. “I will cut it off and make an administrative decision, without involvement of this body, if you can’t behave yourselves.”
“Uhm, well, sir, I – uhm.” Her words sputtered into silence, and Harry was about to take pity on her. He was startled when Malfoy did it first.
Kingsley’s pause filled the office with uncomfortable silence. “Scorpius is very, very smart Harry,” he said finally, “you know this. He’s bordering on brilliant.”
“After you.”
“Why?” She held up her hand. “No, don’t answer that yet. I’m going to order up some hot chocolate, and then you can tell me everything.”
"I'm contacting you, as Albus's father, as a courtesy." Hermione's voice was very prim.
“Of course I have,” Draco answered, leaning his elbow on the pillows behind Harry’s head and resting his head in his palm. “There are years of memories stored in little bottles next to Mother’s Pensieve.”
She giggled and took another drink of her beer. “Oh, relax. There’s no blood involved, and no one gets naked. Although—“ she pretended to look thoughtful, “—I never did get to see you starkers, so maybe I should have lied and told you to let me have a look first, just to be sure you haven’t gone to flab.”
Harry picked up his wand and poked Draco in the hip. “I’ll wound you.”
“Why did you bother, then?” he asked, carefully studying Harry’s face.
Harry pulled Malfoy gently to the back of the lift and didn’t breathe until the doors closed and the lift moved with no one in it but them. There truly had been no way to control where people stood, and it had been the one part of this plan that had made him nervous. Now that they were past that, Harry leaned against the wall, breathing a sigh of relief. They still had to get by the offices on the way to the Minister’s suite, but if everything had gone according to plan Hermione would meet them at the lift doors and lead the way.
hpdmhpdmhpdm
“Such a charming child,” Hermione said dryly, leaning in to kiss her son’s cheek. She made a face when she pulled away, picking up a napkin to wipe her mouth. Harry took a sip of his coffee, then sighed in delight.
“I know,” Harry said. He slipped his arm around Draco’s waist. “Make you hot?”
Malfoy’s blush deepened. “I will when I’m hungry, Evie. Thank you.”
“Oh, fuck off.” Harry scowled at him.
Potter nodded thoughtfully. “That doesn’t explain the gifts, though.”
“Same as usual.” The boy smiled, his brown eyes gleaming.
He recognized the potion immediately, and his body tightened.
Harry scowled at him as the Portkey activated and braced his feet, closing his eyes. Gods, but he hated Portkey travel. It made him dizzy and nauseated, and he could never know how long it would last. It had got better as he'd entered his late twenties, but he was still never sure how he'd do. Knowing how iffy Harry's Portkey landing could be, Ron took a half step closer and curled his fingers in the back of Harry's hip length black Minister's robes. He was wearing one of the less formal sets he owned; there was a high collar that curved behind his neck and hugged his sharp jaw line, and a simple Ministry logo was embroidered on the front right breast. The lining was black satin, the tunic beneath black wool with a row of buttons up the front, not unlike the ones Snape used to wear. He wore black trousers, wishing they were jeans, with a short black boot, wishing it was his trainers. He doubted he'd ever settle into the idea of most of his Minister's robes, particularly the ones with the swags and epaulets and jewelling; they were for more formal events and he frequently wanted to hit them with an
“Sure.” He paused before a gate in the middle of a white picket fence and leaned over to push it open, and Harry looked up the narrow walkway to the charming two story house that sat back from the street.
Harry groaned, his hands clutching Draco’s hips. He pulled him in until they were pressed together from shoulders to knees, legs entwined. “Mine?” he asked. Draco nodded as their lips met again, and they disappeared with a ‘pop’.
Harry's attention shifted to O'Conner, just like most of the other people in the room, and Draco felt him cringe, as if he wished he could grow smaller. It infuriated Draco. He tightened his arm around Harry's shoulders.
Dean had given him a baleful look. “You cannot be that stupid. Blokes are just short a hole. And they know exactly how to suck a man off, Seamus. Don’t knock what you haven’t tried.”
“Oh, are you staying??” Megan did everything but jump up and down in place like a toddler, and Frombley gave her a quelling look.
“Gods, it’s getting deep in here. I’m going to need a shovel to get to the door.” Hermione rolled her eyes and crossed her long legs.
"This had best be good, Draco," Pansy called out entering the room. "You've no clue the delicious drama…" She stopped, staring around the room with a lascivious grin. "Or perhaps you do. Well gentlemen, and I use that term fairly lightly, just what in the name of Merlin's saggy pants is going on in here? Because I'm fairly certain it has to do with that one's," her head shifted in Harry's direction, "bastard ex and the current show he's orchestrating in the ballroom."
He heard the sound of the door chimes echo through the cavernous house but out of habit he ignored it. Flossy would see who it was, although who could be at the door in the middle of Whiltshire he couldn’t imagine.
Malfoy leaned his head against Adrian’s, his long-fingered hand caressing the child’s back. He looked torn, but finally he mouthed, “Thank you.”
"They're on commission."
Harry looked to the waitress, who waited with her pencil poised, one brow arched.
Potter’s lips slid from his mouth, over the curve of his jaw, and Draco let his head loll to the side. Potter eased his scarf down with his chin and settled his lips just below Draco’s ear, teeth nibbling before his tongue touched the heated skin. His hand slid down, teasing along the line of Draco’s trousers before dropping lower. Draco shifted restlessly, legs spreading slightly, hips lifting, and Potter understood the unspoken need. His palm flattened over the smooth bulge of Draco’s confined cock and he hissed between his teeth.
“Sweetheart.” He opened his arms and she walked into them gratefully, her hands clutching his jacket. “Don’t worry about it.”
Something about that proprietary ‘my Harry’ really irritated Draco.
“You don’t need any more, Pepper.”
“So are you,” he muttered, voice strained.
Draco entered his shop, still preoccupied. He handed Pansy the bag, and she immediately took it to the small table in the corner that held not only the tea things, but a small bar, as well. Many of their clients found the tattooing went easier after a finger or two of Firewhisky. He had bent over to check the appointment book when he noticed the large black eagle owl, sitting on the perch in the corner.
“Mr Potter,” Millicent Bagnold said, surprisingly deep voice smooth, one dark brow quirked.
“Is he sleeping?” Draco nodded, and she took a step towards the door before pausing. “Can I…?
And why was he turning up in Harry’s Floo, of all places. He’d left it unlocked, but
Draco grimaced. “I imagine it was a good deal worse for him. Fortunately, if the treatment worked, he won’t remember any of it.”
“I’ll bet any of you tossers I can make this place completely liveable by the time term starts in the fall,” Harry said stoutly.
“Are you all right?” Harry asked.
“So, stop bouncing it.” Draco sighed. “Merlin, you’re like a ten year old on a sugar high with the bouncing and twitching.”
"Anxious to fuck you. Wood, the sadist, is threatening to fine anyone he hears about having sex with a team-mate five hundred galleons."
It was enough to know that, whatever Potter thought about the gifts, he still wanted
He turned towards the door, feeling both shocked and elated. Had Potter just said what he thought he’d said? He shook his head in bemusement. Once again, he was almost to the door when Potter spoke.
Ron shocked him by leaning down and hugging him. “I’m glad you’re here, and I’m glad you’re okay. Try not to be too big a pain in the arse.” He lowered his voice to a whisper. “He’s really not that bad.”
“Have one,” Frombley entreated, and Draco saw the pleading in his pale blue eyes. Draco studied the sugar encrusted biscuits and realized Megan had come to the open door and was watching him anxiously.
“There was a time when you would have.”
Hermione picked up another cookie. “Of course you have a say in it, Harry. We won’t be holding you prisoner. But you do need to be thoughtful about it. I just don’t want something, like a fall, to set you back.”
*******
She turned to him, one brow arched. “So?”
The room was enormous, panelled in cherry wood that gleamed a dark liquid sherry tone, polished to a deep sheen. Large chairs upholstered in red leather faced a wide, black marble fireplace, above which hung a huge rack of deer antlers. Large portraits of Lord's and their Lady's past hung on the walls, and near the fireplace was the biggest four poster he'd seen in his life. It was covered with a white duvet, a deep green and blue plaid blanket of soft wool folded at the foot and a stack of red and blue throw pillows against the intricately carved headboard. The bed was so high he'd need the provided step stool to mount it, and the four posts were carved with vines and roses, a crown decorating the top of each. The only place Harry had ever seen anything like it was on Downton Abbey on the telly.
“What exactly are you and Ms. Hereford doing in my classroom?” Harry’s voice echoed menacingly off of the stones in the walls and floor. He’d discovered that little trick barely a week in residence. It made him sound much more imposing than he was.
“I’ve no idea what ‘Tesco’ is, but I assume it must be some sort of—food procuring establishment?”
“Potter,” Draco managed. But he couldn’t manage more than that.
"Draco…"
It had actually taken five treatments before Bernard had declared Harry free of the phobias surrounding certain foods. Now a small bottle labeled ‘Subject 34, treatment A1d0’ sat in the cabinet behind his desk with dozens of others just like it. Only Harry, Draco and the Healer knew it contained those toxic memories from his childhood.
"Weasley," Malfoy responded in precisely the same tone, although he looked infinitely more amused. Ron turned back to Harry.
Rose jumped out of her chair, milk from her cereal dripping down her little pointed chin. He didn’t care; when she threw her arms around his waist he hugged her, then picked up a napkin and wiped her chin.
When they walked into the small bakery it was mostly deserted, save one table in the far corner with a couple of twenty somethings. It was festively decorated, garlands around all the large windows and a Christmas Tree by the counter, red bows and silver balls tucked in amongst the evergreens. And on each table there was a small tree, bent nearly in two, one large red ball hanging from the top. Harry saw them and began to laugh.
Prompt for this part:
“No,” he said slowly.  “Not exactly.”
*****
Harry lifted his hands away, straightening slowly. Draco sighed softly, and everything in him told Harry to go back upstairs and go to bed, and let Draco think Whimsy had come down in the night to cover him, but he couldn’t do it. He just… couldn’t leave him there alone.
Draco looked up quickly. “Oh, Merlin. I forgot Belasio married Charlie Weasley.”
"I've never meant anything more in my life."
The adult had white-blond hair that was gently mussed and curled over his collar, and he was reaching across the two youngest to take popcorn out of the bowl on what could only be Teddy’s lap.
war hero, isn’t he?” Draco was proud he kept the vast majority of bitterness from his voice.
"Sometimes, but not always. I think I understand what you're saying, though. He wanted the giant slayer, not the man."
“What’s amazing?” Harry asked, wiping his hands on a pristine kitchen towel.
Harry felt himself colouring. “Snacks should be right in, and the substitute should be here shortly, too.”
Potter smiled. “Care for a drink?” He asked, pulling him away from the wall.
Somehow, Hermione knew what she was going to say before the words ever left her mouth.
Harry felt something close tight around his wrist, and he looked down to see one of Malfoy’s hands gripping him, so hard it was almost painful. Harry leaned forward. “Malfoy, relax,” he murmured and closed his hand over the bony fingers. “It’s okay. We aren’t here about that. Well, we are, but not in the way you think.”
“Don't know,” he heard.  “How are you able to come up with sentence like that?”
"Ron." Hermione's growing concern must've finally got through, and he looked up at her.
“Daaa,” she said, patting him on the face.
“The elves made that coffee. I only make mine because they’re insulted by the idea of a Keurig, and have never really mastered the idea of cappuccino.”
Harry’s spirits soared as he rounded the last bend in the path and  picked up his pace. Off to the right were the thick trees of the Dark Forest and down to the left he could just see the shinning banks of the Black Lake, clearly frozen over. Down a steep stretch the massive gates of Hogwarts came into view, and another twenty feet and there it was, the school, the thousands of windows gleaming with warmth and light. Harry shivered, wanting that warmth as much as he wanted his next breath, drawing his wand to cast his Patronus.
“Of course you do.”
Draco shook his head. “I completely disagree. You’re entirely too noble and self-sacrificing to have done well in Slytherin. That bunch of snakes would have had you for lunch. Believe me, Slytherin isn’t the place for…”
He’d really rather do something a bit more proactive, just to see if her theory was correct.
, he wrote instead, feeling a little thrill at seeing the name on the parchment,
He just shook his head.
The space was a surprise. Draco had never been in a mind healer’s office before, but he certainly hadn’t imagined it would look like this. There was a large window along one wall, charmed to show the view of downtown London. It looked to be a lovely, clear day, the sky blue and a few fluffy white clouds drifting gently above Big Ben and Tower Bridge. The room was bright, walls a soft green, floors of pale oak with homey throw rugs scattered about. Two comfortable looking armchairs sat at an angle to a sofa upholstered in a soothing pattern of green leaves. One entire wall was taken up with bookcases stuffed to the brim with books and papers and knickknacks, and there wasn’t a desk in sight. It looked like a comfy sitting room in a flat populated by a bookish uni professor; all it was missing was a fat cat perched on the deep window ledge.
It was the first real kiss they’d shared since Draco had been back, the first one that felt
“Malfoy.”
fan mail.”
The cookies came out of the oven and were set on racks to cool and Draco’s attention was brought back to the effort when his mother reached over and caught his hand, her fair brows lifted. Draco had nodded, and leaned in to help thread ribbon through the decorated cookies so that they could be hung on the tree. When Teddy carefully picked up the plate of completely cookies and carried them into the family parlor, Draco followed, even though his eyes kept lifting to the nearest doorway.
“Wif choc’ate chips?”
He gave her a dirty look. “Low blow, Hermione.” He told her about his year’s long attraction to Malfoy after he’d finished off the better part of a bottle of red wine. A lot of painful secrets were shared that night, on both sides.
“Better cast a silencing spell,” he said dryly.
He leaned in, doing precisely what he said he would. For the first few seconds Draco held his mouth stubbornly closed. But eventually, he sighed, and softened.
Love you madly!
It was bitchy, and so unlike her that Harry stared at her in surprise. She had the grace to grimace.
hpdmhpdmhpdm
Harry closed his eyes again, shaking his head.
Arthur took the tray off the highchair without batting an eyelash. “The same can be said for all of us occasionally.”
“So do I,” she said, mischief entering her eyes. “And imagining Lucius’ reaction to a portrait of St Nicholas hanging in his entryway gives me unimagined joy.”
“Isn’t that the truth. Do stop and spare the poor clientele.” Harry didn’t yell but his deep voice carried. They collapsed into laughter, unable to continue due to their general hilarity. He shook his head at them, hiding his own amusement, and turned to walk over towards Rosmerta and her fat tree.
“I heard his assistant ask him if he’d eaten, and he told her no.” He crossed his arms over his chest. “Oh just shut it, the both of you.”
“I can’t see why,” Draco said. His gaze grew challenging. “Unless, at your advanced age, you’ve only got one in you.”
Draco was trembling, and it tore at Harry's heart.
“Nope.” Rose settled more comfortably against Harry.
She put her lips next to her mother’s ear. “I need to wee.” Harry looked away, swallowing a smile. Apparently the concept of whispering was somewhat lost on the little girl. Hermione sighed.
“That’s just one of your gifts, Molly.” He took a large bite of the biscuit, humming appreciatively. “And it is a gift. These are delicious.”
"Oh, I know," Al said, waving it away. "But you did in school, and I imagine anyone who knew about your history might think that. Dad, this really is too funny."
Draco turned back to him. “Thank you, Mr Frombley. I have no idea why you’re being so kind…”
“Nothing to be afraid of in here. Not even any obnoxious fucking white peacocks.”
“There’s an owl out here. It’s a Ministry bird, and it’s…very insistent that its parcel can go only to you.”
There was a lit exit sign over a hallway that led out of the ballroom, and Harry headed for it. If this venue was like any of the other ten thousand hotel ballrooms he'd been in during the interminable last ten years, that hallway would lead to the loo's, and then the lobby. He thought if he could just splash some cold water on his face, he'd be okay. Then he'd go back, his pride intact, order a double firewhisky and ignore the obnoxious Irish prat for the rest of the evening. He could do that; he was sure he could.
Silence settled over them, thick as the rapidly cooling, foggy evening air.
She looked up, black eyes assessing his mood at one glance. "Shall I warn Minister Shacklebolt's assistant that he might want to keep his eyes peeled for an assassin?"
After dinner Harry and Ted took a walk down to the new clearing to see Hagrid.
Harry’s smile widened and Draco reached out and took his elbow. They disappeared from the kitchen with a soft ‘pop’.
“Having you back is gift enough,” Narcissa murmured as she hugged her son, tears in her eyes. Harry could not help but agree.
For the purposes of this story, I’m borrowing the Pagan celebration of the Winter Solstice and adding in a dash of HP canon, and my own take on a wizarding celebration. No insult is intended by doing this; I have enormous respect for the pagan traditions, and find myself learning more every time I read about them. In fact, as a Christian, I’m amazed by how much we ‘borrowed’ from people here long, long before we were.
"How dare I?" Harry growled. "I dare because I've been in love with you for seventeen fucking years, you stupid wanker, and you carried and gave birth to my son without ever bothering to tell me!"
“She’s feeling just well enough to squirm and just bad enough to be a pill.”
Malfoy blinked. “You’re welcome.” He slipped his wand into the left sleeve of his outer robes, and Harry wondered fleetingly if his Mark had faded at all. He pushed the thought away.
“You know that isn’t possible, Ernie,” Ron said. “Harry can’t be involved in this.”
“I don’t understand. Tell you what?”
Draco frowned. “Before Hogwarts? Not much. Why?”
Adrian held out his hand, looking like quite the little man.
“Harry!” George said expansively, coming over and patting him on the back. “We’ve been waiting for you.”
”I’m glad,” Draco breathed. “I doubt we’d be where we are now if you still did.”
“It’s a date,” Harry said with a bright grin. Anya smacked his shoulder.
He felt more than heard Potter's sigh. “She means well,” he said finally. “She really does. And she was an enormous amount of help to me once, when I'd been in a disasterous relationship. She really did save me from myself. But that doesn't mean...” he shook his head, his voice trailing off.
Out on a pristine bank of snow were etched interlocking hearts.
Harry waited for the cutting comment that didn’t come.
"Harry," Draco cried out, pushing his arse back down onto Harry's finger, "I'm going to come. I…" He gave an inarticulate cry, his back arching
“Potter wanted to make a little trip down memory lane today.”
They didn’t have to wait long. Hermione came back into the room, lugging a huge book, and Harry was forcefully reminded of that time during first year when she’d found the information about Nicholas Flamel. With her hair a halo of curls around her head, she didn’t even look that different. She dropped the book in the middle of the table with a solid thud and Ron smirked at him, mouthing ‘light reading’. Harry fought a smile.
“Kreacher?” Harry said. The elf jumped, startled, and turned around.
He heard Pansy sigh, and he turned back to her. She was giving him a long, level look. "What?"
“In November of 1998,” he began, “Draco Malfoy, his mother and his father all sat in front of a Wizengamot tribunal in order to be tried for crimes against wizarding kind. Lucius, as I believe everyone agreed at the time, was found guilty of sedition, treason and murder, and returned to finish his sentence for breaking into the Ministry, with a life sentence attached to the end. He died a decade into his sentence, and I doubt there are many who didn’t think he deserved it, including his son. But for Narcissa and Draco, I believe there was a serious miscarriage of justice.” There was a burst of disbelieving sound, and Harry held up his hand. “I know some of you are going to disagree with me, based on the name alone. But you’d be wrong about that,” he said firmly. “As wrong as I was not to stay and testify, because I have important facts to add to the transcripts of both trials.” Harry’s eyes moved over the crowd, and they seemed to hang on his every word. “In January of 1998, Ron and Hermione Weasley and I were taken captive by a group of Snatchers, and taken to Malfoy manor.” This was common knowledge, as was Hermione’s torture at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange. Hermione had written a biography that contained a great deal of information about their year on the run. Interestingly, nothing about the Malfoy’s. None of them thought that odd at the time, but now their absence was glaring. “While we were being held, Draco Malfoy was asked by both his father and aunt to identify us. There is no doubt in my mind that he knew who we were.” Again, Harry’s laser green eyes moved over the crowd. “He refused to identify us, no doubt saving our lives and changing the outcome of the war.”
Potter blinked slowly, looking like the action almost pained him. “I don’t – understand.”
“I only know he’s been in an accident because of Pansy. And I stopped taking the bloody paper after Andromeda died. They made their feelings about me being named Teddy’s guardian rather than his golden boy godfather very clear.”
Draco let the heavy coat slide from his shoulders then reached up to pull the dark beaver hat from his head, attempting to smooth his hair with his hand.
Harry crossed his arms slowly over his chest, green eyes frosty.  “Yes, Ron.  Being ‘what’, precisely?”
Malfoy looked faintly insulted. "People with a vocabulary."
Draco looked up at Healer Whycroft, glaring at him from the doorway.
to produce an heir, had it made any sense to him. At the time, he’d felt almost—relieved to find that out.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded. She patted his arm with her other hand. “That's my boy.”
He laughed. “Well, that’s one thing to call it I suppose.” He shook his head. “But I didn’t ask you here so we could exchange compliments.”
He was walking a shell-shocked Draco towards the front door when they passed a pile of boxes near a holiday display. The top box was open, and lying on some crinkled newsprint was a blown glass stag. It was about the size of his hand when Draco picked it up, elegant in every detail, its head held high and its eight-point rack catching the overhead lighting. Within the glass over each of the four legs and over the proud head was a frosting of gold.
"Well, excuse me, you selfish son of a bitch, but I can't just – "
“This wasn't a ruse?” he said, gesturing.  “You're pretty organized for a man who just 'wanted to get me warm'.”
"Yeah, honestly Daddy," Ron said, punching him in the shoulder. "I'm hungry. Shake off the sprogs and come eat."
“Charming,” he muttered. “I’ll wager your grandmother doesn’t even know you own that.”
“I like it. It fits better than any of mine.”
They stumbled up the stairs, kissing every few steps, clothes left dangling from the bannisters and puddled on the floor.
“A bit.” He raised his knees. “Feels good.”
“I didn’t do that,” Harry said uselessly. “And I’m not Harry Potter. I’m someone poly-juiced to look like him.”
"Oh, honestly," Draco complained, but he didn't mean it. Grabbing Harry around the waist, he flipped them over until Harry was on his back, looking up at him with wide eyes and Draco knelt between his knees. "What do you like?" he asked as he flipped open the cap on the small lube bottle and dribbled some onto his fingers.
oooOOOooo
“It doesn’t bother you George is all but… well, he isn’t subtle.”
“You’s too big to sit on Draco! You’d smoosh him!”
“No,” he said faintly. “No, this is my ring. I haven’t had it out of my sight since the moment you gave it to me.
“Did that hurt?”
“Oh, would you? Thank you, Draco. We brought the trunks in long enough to drop them off and for everyone to pack a few changes of clothes.”
“…why?”
Ron chuckled. “Yeah. That’s humiliating, is what that is.” He shook his head in mock sadness. “We promise not to alert the media.”
Harry had got much better at apparition; he no longer staggered on landing, or felt like he was going to sick up on his shoes, which was a good thing as there were dozens of people milling about the Ministry courtyard and still arriving at any one of a dozen Apparition points. Harry hated this part of coming to the Ministry, particularly for formal events. When it was for the work day, it wasn’t so bad. People still stared, but that was pretty much the story of his life. In spring and summer, the courtyard was pleasant, with fruit trees in huge planters and rose bushes in bloom around the edges. In winter, it was ordinarily just cold and wet, and overall miserable. For this particular evening formal event, there were fairy lights hovering over their heads and sparkling frost on the walls, and Harry would have to remember to tell Hermione how beautiful he thought it was.
Harry pulled out Hermione’s chair for her, then sat in his own. Hermione sat after giving her husband a pointed look. Ron plopped into his chair, then noticed his wife’s baleful stare.
"You know me so well." He kissed her cheek, then watched her walk toward the bar, slim hips swaying, a vision on the six-inch stiletto heels. There wasn't a man in the area who didn't follow her with his eyes, or a woman, no matter how beautiful or glamorous, who didn't hate her on sight. Draco smiled as he walked to the coat check, handing over her cape and his long black wool overcoat, taking the tickets from the polite coat check girl and slipping them into the pocket of his outer robes. He entered the dimly lit ballroom and stalked along the edges of the bar area, looking for the perfect spot to watch the room while being inconspicuous himself. He supported the cause, but had no desire to see himself on the society pages the next day.
Draco shuddered. "Of course I do," he snarled. "Not a day goes by that I don't remember how bloody stupid I was. I've spent more than twenty years trying to live down the shit I did, to make sure Scorpius never lives with the kinds of regrets I carry."
Harry heard Hermione giggle, and felt Mrs. Malfoy stir restlessly near his knee, and smiled against Draco’s mouth, drawing back, but pressing one last light kiss to his lips as he did so. “Perhaps we should save this for later, when we can be alone,” he whispered. Draco rolled his eyes.
She flipped open the book, searching the table of contents.
“There’s a world of exhaustion in that sigh, Minister.” Harry gave him a wry smile.
Harry smiled. “Then it’s far past time.”
“Thanks, Ron,” he grumbled. “That makes me sound like a damsel in distress.”
As they moved through the halls of St. Mungo’s, people didn’t just stare; they stopped and gaped, and pointed, and whispered behind their hands, and by the time they arrived at the cafeteria Harry was irritated and wishing they’d never left his room. But when Hermione pushed through the doors the room was empty, only one table set for tea with a tablecloth and a lovely white ceramic tea set, and a three tiered silver server stacked with small cakes and finger sandwiches. When Hermione parked him next to the table, a woman in a pink uniform with a white apron tied around her waist closed the door behind them and locked it, then gave them a smile before disappearing into the kitchen.
," Harry repeated. Malfoy took another long drag, and Harry rolled his eyes.
“No,” Draco replied. “But I am acquainted with your escort.”
Harry knew his brows had shot up. “You – want to tag along with me?”
“You certain you’re all right?”
Harry gave him a pointed look. "Well, I haven't. Not yet at least. Anything you'd like to tell me, son?" Harry was teasing, but when Al and Scorpius exchanged a startled look, Harry began to wonder if there wasn't something going on he ought to know. He angled his head and peered into Al's green eyes, but his son just shrugged. "O – kay," Harry said slowly. He'd interrogated enough suspects over the years that he could see something was up. He mentally added it to the things he'd discuss with his son during their stroll. Speaking of which… "Al, don't disappear after dinner."
"What are you doing here?" he asked as one of the junior Auror's, standing almost painfully stiff when he arrived, reached out and took his small rucksack. Hermione had taught him her spell to extend the interior of a bag, and he'd found it extremely handy in his necessary travels as Minister.
“She probably will,” Draco said, his voice even. “But if you don’t get some sleep soon, you’re going to be absolutely useless, and unless Olivia is very different than the other children, we’re in for another long night.”
Harry snorted softly. “That must have been fun.”
"Yeah," he breathed.
For the purposes of this story, I’m borrowing the Pagan celebration of the Winter Solstice and adding in a dash of HP canon, and my own take on a wizarding celebration. No insult is intended by doing this; I have enormous respect for the pagan traditions, and find myself learning more every time I read about them. In fact, as a Christian, I’m amazed by how much we ‘borrowed’ from people here long, long before we were.
“Who?” Hermione asked, her brow furrowed. “And why?”
"Knobly," Draco said softly. The old elf appeared. "Mr Potter would like
“It’s going to work,” Draco said firmly, deciding to borrow some of Hermione’s resolve.
“He isn’t down yet.” Harry turned as Hermione set Rose on her feet, then came around the counter toward him. She was wearing a lovely set of russet robes, and her hair was pulled back at the nape of her neck, spilling into wild curls between her shoulder blades. “And don’t you look smart!” She eyed him with a smile.
Draco studied him for a long time, then smiled slowly. "So you are."
"Drag?" Harry's voice dripped with disdain.
She paused, her hand tightening on his arm when he offered it to her. His eyes lifted to hers, and he saw that one of her graceful brows was arched. “You’re nervous,” she whispered. “Would you care to tell me why?”
"A bit beyond? That's one way to put it." Harry raised a brow. "I'd think two weeks of sleeping wrapped in someone's arms might lead to the parties involved at least being on a first name basis."
“I’ll do anything I can, Draco.”
“Oh,” Hermione said quickly, “if you’d like to get something else.”
Kingsley wasn’t bending an inch on Harry staying off until after the first of the year, and Hermione and Molly were making very sure he didn’t do anything at home, either. In fact, he’d gone to physical therapy that day and come home to a perfectly clean flat, all of his dishes washed and laundry done. He loved them so much, but forcing him to do absolutely nothing was driving him spare. He’d watched as much football as a person could and read an actual biography of Dumbledore, not that load of shite Skeeter had written, but even so he’d felt as if something was missing. He’d found out well after Dumbledore’s death that he was gay, and the supposition was that he’d had a relationship with Grindelwald when they’d both been in their early twenties. This author was almost too respectful, sticking mostly to his magical accomplishments, and Harry found himself a bit disappointed there wasn’t more about the man.
Potter sniggered, then covered his mouth as if alarmed by the sound he’d made. “No, not really,” he said with a grudging smile. “It’s just that she’s so much more articulate than I am, and she can explain in five minutes what it would take me an hour to get out.”
“Nah,” Harry said, rubbing noses with the baby in delight. “Look at Arthur; they’ve all got his metabolism.”
"Don't." He wasn't begging, he told himself. He'd just heard it all before, and hearing it again wasn't going to change anything.
“Then, will you please just tell me?”
“There was a time when I used curses without knowing what they did,” Harry countered, somber. “Fortunately, we’re no longer sixteen.”
“Glad to be of service, sir. I hope I can help you out again soon.”
She turned and walked away, leaving him standing, watching her in bemusement.
“Oh, you’re hilarious,” he grumbled, turning back to sift through a pile of jumpers on a clearance table. He felt her come up to his side.
"You know what I mean, damn you."
Harry fought a grimace. Slughorn was dead, after all. It wasn’t generous to begrudge the old man this last gesture. “I’m sure they will. And the kids will want to pay their respects.”
“By the way, I did stick my head in here for a reason.” She grinned at him. “Tea or coffee?”
The resulting silence through the line made him clench his fingers.
Draco smiled as he bent to press a kiss to Pansy's fragrant cheek, then whispered in her ear, “I'd have called you later, you pushy bint.”
Draco couldn't help the exasperated smile that spread across his face.  He shook his head slowly, and prepared to tell her what she wanted to know.  And then to his surprise, because he'd always told Pansy everything about his sexual exploits in the past, he found that he just... couldn't.
Draco shook her hand. It was hard to tell if he was still flushed from the heat or blushing, but Harry thought the colour looked good on him.
“Not flirting. I actually wanted to pick your brain a bit.”
“I will not,” Harry said in pretended afront. “I make much better coffee than the elves.”
She swept out of the room, leaving blessed silence behind her.
