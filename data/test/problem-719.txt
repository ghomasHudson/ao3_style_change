He found himself removing the now soaked bandage. The scratches had healed leaving the faded dark mark glaring up at him, and the old scars reminding him. Nothing had been able to remove it, and Salazar had he tried, he was forever left with a brand that whispered and screamed in torment – the ghostly voices of his victims of torture, the victims he had witnessed murdered, the echoes of his past. He still felt the phantom pain of being called to Voldemort’s side. All the wrong that he committed, all the mistakes and regrets of his past… it was forever there for the world to see…. There for him to never forget!
The sudden, drawn out moan, had Harry turning to face Draco once more. Draco had taken a bite of a chocolate muffin, his tongue darted out to the side of lips - not wanting to waste any of his chocolaty treat. He failed to noticed the way Harry was now staring at him, nor the way Harry’s tongue slithered out to wet his own lips as Draco took another bite at his muffin.
Harry nodded again. Molly finally made him return to the Burrow, and they had a nice chat over tea. Molly just asked that Harry was careful, nothing else. She was okay with whatever Harry chose just as long as he was happy and safe. She never even accused him of being at fault for his brake-up with Ginny, telling him agian how much of a son he was to her; if her children weren't talking to each other, she still loved them all the same, and that included Harry.
To have his memories played out like that though, Harry must be feeling so violated and sick. Draco hated it when Voldemort breached his mind, he could imagine how Harry felt. He would be livid, and humiliated if it had been
His crash on Tau was a blossoming like wild flowers in an undisturbed meadow, he was caught hook line and sinker, and the man’s personality was so intoxicating and charismatic. Tau’s words were both witty and refined. The man radiated intelligence, eloquence, and of course, that light, playful, amusing arrogance of his -- but he always made him smile, laugh, or contemplate things he wouldn’t have before. The man also had a calm, appeasing quality to him; the type of calm that Harry could imagine in front of a crackling fire, with coffee and gentle conversation; the type of calm that was coming home from work and embracing each other.
-Images stretch into focus. Falling off his broom at 3-yrs into his fathers arms giggling. Chasing a rabbit around the garden at 5-yrs, getting dirty.  Nursing a injured bird at 8-yrs with his mother.
-Draco looks at his dark mark, then at his appearance in the bathroom mirror. He frowns and runs from the room to find Hermione.
Harry: "Because I love her, we're sorting things out, and you know what ... it's none of your fucking business."
Harry chuckled. Yep, definitely arrogant, but also ... somewhat charismatic - at least in his opinion. There was just something intriguing about this mystery man behind the parchment. He couldn't stop the grin that donned his lips; he felt like a teenager again and this sudden new aspect of his life was rather exciting.
“That’s just it though. He would have had to have let Tom into his mind to show his loyalty, at least some parts. I think Severus was just that good - that he could hide the information away that he really didn’t want Tom to see, while making it seem like he was opening his mind to him.”
“Scared that you can’t handle your drink, Potter.” Draco’s left eyebrow raised on its own – something Harry almost frowned at. He couldn’t lift one eyebrow, and it was so tempting to try that he almost did. Draco had such expressive features when his wanted to use them.
He sighed and walked to the other end of the living room - over to what looked like a massive golden snitch stuck trying to pass through a tall wooden table. Harry opened the top half of the golden ball, revealing a drinking cabinet with glasses. As Harry was helping himself to a glass of Glenglassaugh Octaves single malt Scotch whiskey, Draco found his voice.
“At least tell me why. Maybe we can go someplace else?” Harry’s mind was working overtime to try and figure out what had spooked Draco, but nothing was coming to mind – or at least, nothing was coming to mind quickly enough.
“Mr Malfoy! This is a confidential legal matter, and it is against protocol to have a Death Eater present.” Auror Graves spat.
Harry was waiting for Draco - in the bitter winter cold outside the Three Broomsticks, wearing his coat, scarf, and gloves. He was nervous and excited simultaneously, and found himself biting his bottom lip. He was quite early, unable to stop thinking of Draco or fidgeting before he left the Burrow. He just hoped the bloody radio wouldn't make an appearance today - he needed to know how real their feelings where for each other, and get to know each other without magic interfering.
you torn yourself apart that year. It was a war, there were more than two sides Draco, and you were in the grey – being backed into a corner. Only someone that found pride and enjoyment in their orders from that bastard deserved to be punished. Only those that feel remorse and guilt over the thing they were forced to do, deserve absolution.”
Back in his private room, he wiped the soup bowl clean with his bread and popped the last of it into his mouth. The spoon clinked as it landed into the bowl and he pushed it aside. A few moments later, the bowl vanished and a fresh cup of coffee appeared. He thanked Kreacher - not knowing if he’d heard him or not.
“Minerva would like to see you when we get back from Hogsmeade.” Draco shouted so that Harry would hear him.
“I’d be out soon!” He called back. “You don’t have to wait for me.” And you shouldn’t wait for me, he thought.
Harry was afraid that if Tau knew his real identity, the words - ‘it was too good to be true’ would in fact, be true. Yet, their talk of fears and overcoming them gave Harry a sudden confidence to be brave. He needed that solid, undeniable, without a doubt proof that Tau
Harry was still terrified that his feelings for Draco sat precariously on a precipice - likely to tip into something more than platonic friendship if he wasn’t careful, and he was still growing fonder of Tau every day.
Draco and Harry were walking through Hogsmeade the following week. They were currently in the middle of a conversation.
“Harry.” Draco caught his attention, cutting of his train of thought. “I think I better return to my room; my legs feel like jelly.” He slurred ever so slightly, and as if to prove his legs had lost their proper function, Draco had to grab the dining table to prevent a fall. He chuckled as he stood up straight again.
Draco never wandered from his side, still eating his way through far too much sugar and chocolate. Then, about half-hour later, Harry noticed the warning signs of fight about to break out across the Hall. He set down his cup and went to deal with it before it escalated.
Councilor: "You can try and manipulate me young man, but I won't be fooled. You're lost are not? Stuck between what you've known your whole life, and what you want to become - but you're judged for your past, stuck there and struggling to take the next step forward. Might I even dare to say, scared, unable to trust, and unsure of what your are now?
Harry: "Here's the thing, I should have been used to it. I should have been able to ignore her like I'd always been told to do. But she was insulting my parents and wouldn't let me leave. She wanted me to sit there listening to her rambling on and on about how bad bred my family - my mother and father were to have me."
Harry didn’t know how to take that sudden question. He felt his walls stacking rapidly, his mind suddenly on guard. Draco had better not try and cause trouble for him - he enjoyed his work as a teacher. The Auror department had forced him to see a mind healer during his training eleven years ago, it was for that reason that he was declared unfit medically to become an auror. They gave him the all clear to teach at Hogwarts though, and the ‘mind haze episodes’ as Draco had just labelled them, had been occurring less and less every year. If Draco started to cause issues for him now, he would not be happy.
“Draco!” Harry shouted. He was about to follow the blood when he was accosted by a bloody news reporter.
Harry rubbed a hand down his face, sighing deeply. He needed to get back to his work, stop thinking of Draco for now, and stop thinking of the past… but then a house elf popped into his room loudly and startled him.
-Tuesday 10 November, Harry stares at Draco across the Great Hall during dinner, he headbutts the table when Draco notices him.
Draco’s eyes found Harry’s before they seemed to look behind him … suddenly filling with fear. “C-Ch-Chimera!” He shivered, voice pitched high and pointing at the wall behind Harry.
Monica and Duncan looked down in shame. Harry hated it when his students were anything other than happy, but he needed to install the correct values in them so that they grew to be respectfully adults.
He just hoped that Draco would rush to get the door, and that he wouldn’t put away whatever it was he was doing first. ‘
“No, they won’t!” Harry shouted. “If that’s what you’re so worried about, then let me tell you this – I have a contract with every bloody new reporting agency and the UK, they can’t publish anything about me unless I have agreed to an interview. And you’re not a Death Eater!”
“He cares a great deal about you, you know?” Madam Pomfrey whispered, more to herself than anything, since she knew that Draco was deep asleep and would remain so until the morning at least. Thank Merlin for sleeping draughts – it would have been impossible to keep the man in bed otherwise, and he needed the sleep.
Harry was tempted to just plop his butt on the edge of the desk, but this wasn’t his classroom so he sat in the chair as instructed. He felt a little strange sitting in Draco’s chair, and quite a few of the sixth year Gryffindor and Slytherin students frowned between him and Draco. Draco regained their attention quickly and continued as if Harry hadn’t just interrupted them – which made Harry all the more curious; he expected Draco to complain about his timing and tell him to piss off to be honest – maybe not quite in those words but to that extent, not welcome him in and offer up his chair.
They were dismissed, and Harry found himself walking down the corridor. He was lost in his own mind however - a moment of sadness, and a feeling of being incomplete washed over him. He was previously filled with joy - knowing that Hogwarts would soon be gaining so many, innocent, smiling faces ... but he wished for his own, imagining a life with two kids and someone to love.
While Harry raged internally - taking it out on his toast, he didn't notice Draco's face pale, or feel the atmosphere turn more hostile around them. Seamus was suddenly standing next to him, his wand out and pointed at Harry. Not thinking he would do it, Harry ignored him.
Potter. You’ve never done anything wrong in your life. You weren’t there. You weren’t- You didn’t see what HE did, what he made ME do! You have no idea what it’s like-”
Ron whispered into Harry's ear angrily, making him turn to face Ron instead of Draco. He looked at their potion, it was green.
The room they were in had unlabeled boxes stacked everywhere, and some stacks reached the ceiling. There were a few abandoned classroom tables, and various other things. It wasn't that small, but it was so full of stuff that there wasn't much room left to move. Draco's apple-minty breath wafted into his face along with his scent of old books, and an addictive blend of blood orange, coffee, and broom stick wood. He found himself inhaling deeply through his noes, thinking how it caressed his olfactory senses and made him dizzy. When Draco spoke again, Harry noticed him almost blushing - he looked... embarrassed?
-Top-less and knocking into the chest of draws behind him, Harry fights Draco for mouth dominance. Spinning around, they move over to the bed - mouths still firmly locked, they fall onto the bed together.
-Harry slumps down against the outside of the shrieking shack, kicking the snow in anger. Then his head falls into his hands.
Draco didn’t return for a good ten minutes, and Harry was just pouring another glass of liquid courage when the man walked into the room. Draco put his empty glass down on the coffee table expectantly, which Harry happily re-filled.
“Open it then!” Harry said, when Draco just continued to stare at it. He was nervous enough as it was, he just wanted to get this over with – and he hoped that Draco wouldn’t assume Harry was trying to buy his affections.
"I would like a coffee please Kreacher, and maybe a sandwich. You know what, anything to eat would be great! If that's okay please." Harry asked, sighing. Kreacher nodded once more, and left the room with a slight pop.
-Saturday 23rd, Harry sits with Draco at the Slytherin table, confident, with a look to anyone that dared to say anything. People finally start to accept what is obviously inevitable.
Malaise had run a back ground check on Harry before he had left Le'Amortentia, and she had informed him that certain crimes such as murder, child abuse, rape, and pedophiles for example, had to be listed on the profiles. Harry knew then, that his secret chérie was no murderer, or it would have said as much.
Councilor: "Slytherin's are a cunning, resourceful, and an ambition bunch. I know you want me to give you the okay, but it's what ya need that we'll focus on. I can already tell you need to be here."
“Merlin’s bollocks, Harry. You were a Horcrux?” Draco shuddered, and Harry nodded sadly at him. “Fuck! I’m assuming that’s why you walked to your death like a bloody Gryffindor. So, what, you died and traded Tom’s soul piece for your own or something?” Draco asked with bewildered aghast.
Harry decided to try his luck first – it couldn’t hurt to ask, and he was probably stalling too if his was honest.  “Once I’ve told you - explained everything about the Horcruxes dear old Tom made, I’d like you to tell me what happened today at the Three Broomsticks. I think I may have some idea, but I want to hear it from you.”
“Yeah. Erm… The Goblins might have said something about that, but I have no interest to mess with her life.” Harry explained, not seeing the big deal.
He left the parchment out as he climbed under the covers, and he checked it one last time before his eyes closed. If he wasn’t so tired, he might have laid there thinking for hours, but the fatigue quickly ensured that Friday September the 3
Harry had a sudden urge that early evening to write to Draco, so he did. He borrowed Pigwidgeon – with a bit of persuasion from Ron, who couldn't understand why Harry had to write to the Slytherin tosser.
As he was pondering how Tau would take his little 'X', he saw a new message come through on his parchment.
Minerva stared down at the students over her square spectacles, but no one dared to leave the table even if they
Tuesday, 29th September. Harry sees Draco using a curse on a 2nd year Gryffindor by the lake, he turns around and leaves - angry at Draco.
Ron: "I think you need help mate! You haven't stopped going on about giving that slimy git a second chance. I'd rather fuck a hippogriff to be honest."
It worked! The snow on the ground froze like ice, and their opposition were momentarily shocked. In their haste to gain balance on the ice, and their laps of focus … it was on!
“Yeah?” Harry frowned slightly, nervous yet hopeful. Silence, Draco obviously couldn’t say or ask what had been on his tongue just seconds ago.
“Well, “Harry said, hoping to get a reaction from the blond, “we have Honey!”  Draco slowly turned his head to look at him, and then he looked down at the breakfast tray that Harry had just slipped onto his lap. “Come on,” Harry encouraged, trying to forget what Draco had said during his hysteria, “You really do need to eat something.”
Harry tapped his fingers, trying to get his mind out of the past. It must have been a good hour before he received Tau’s very short reply.
On the way to the Great Hall for dinner – having fallen asleep at his kitchen table marking homework, and had therefore missed breakfast and lunch – Harry bumped into Mr Samuel Bartlett, a first year Slytherin, who had literally run into him as he turned the corner.
Draco kept frowning down at his dark navy-blue jacket that Harry had transfigured for him in the end, seeing as Draco kept going for trench coats that still resembled robes far too much. Draco was hesitant to admit it, but he rather liked it. Harry claimed that he wore too much black, and honestly… he rather liked the dark blue.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. “But he didn’t know what Tom wanted with that information, and he meant no ill intent, even warning Riddle how dark they were. He was horrified when Riddle asked the possibility of making seven.”
He was use to Ron’s temper – so he could deal with anger, but Draco’s attitude changed as they were about to enter the Three Broomsticks. Draco was bothered by something, and instead of admitting it, he was getting defensive and frustrated and taking it out on him.
“What can Kreacher do for Master Potter?” The gravel voice of his house elf asked as he appeared with a ‘crack’.
"Erm, it is like… Okay, remember what I said about batteries?" Harry asked, looking for a section on technology or human advancement. The store was huge, multi levelled, and dazzled up with festive decorations like everywhere else.
Petunia had screeched at him for being so clumsy, because of course, he would have been in worse trouble had he accused Dudley of shoving him. She had only shoved a slice of dry bread at him that evening, a toddler sized cup of water because he walked and behaved liked one, and apart from a single trip to the bathroom before she went up to bed, he was in there until the morning when he had to go to school again.
“W’atsit?” Draco mumbled into the ombre green rug – between the black leather sofa and the antique black coffee table – his voice horse and weak.
Harry took Draco's hand and pulled him toward the brick-wall – a magical wall that would take them back though the Leaky Cauldron and into muggle London. Harry planned to send his current purchases home with Kreacher once they'd entered the pub.
“Shut it Potter!” Draco whispered, glaring at the raven-haired man. Why did he have to be right? Bloody saint Potter!
Draco was starting to berate himself for sending the house elf to get Har-Potter. The feelings Harry’s presence and focus on him elicited…
Draco walked up to the Astronomy tower, alone. He was simple overwhelmed with happiness; everything new but perfect. What would his parents say if they saw him now - he chuckled slightly at the thought. Harry, he believed, was his soul mate. He wanted to spend the rest of his life learning and living with him. He was finally a better person now, and because of him and Harry the world had shifted; Harry freeing people from the terror Voldemort promised, and them, teaching people to be more accepting and forgiven by just loving each other. People weren't judging other for their pasts or given houses, it was surreal. He had changed.
Harry wondered if Draco was himself right now, or at least close to his real age. He seemed calmer, more mature, but he was still dubious of Draco’s state of mind.
“It’s never happened before. I think the students keep me distracted enough. Besides, I think one of the students would notice and start shouting, don’t you?” Harry tersely explained.
“Yeah, but I think I’m using it more of an excuse to avoid the Weasley gathering.” Harry admitted; the truth always spilled easier from his lips when he’d had a few glasses of whiskey. “You?”
Draco filed it away in the 'strange things about Harry' section of his mind for later. He knew a lot about Harry – his favourite foods and drinks, his hobbies, his sleeping habits, his tendency to skip meals, the way he rubbed at the back of his neck when embarrassed, and the way he bit the left side of his lip when thinking… but he hadn't known that Harry was claustrophobic. Well, that begged the question… why hadn't they just taken the stairs?
Draco: "Professor, I can't speak for Potter here, but i'm concerned about my N.E.W.T.s. Even though it appears - to everyone else, that my work is being completed; I am struggling to recall what I've learnt, and I don't remember all of my past lessons due to this curse."
He put the parchment away, and spent the next couple of hours tossing and turning in bed before sleep finally came.
“Oh,” Harry realised that he’d been so caught up in Draco’s reaction to the journal and quill, delighted in making the blond speechless with appreciation, that he’d actually forgotten about the vial and lanyard. Harry reached across the table, to carefully bring his present closer, and smiled almost guilty at Draco. “It’s beautiful Draco, but… erm… what?” He frowned.
-Harry walks in silently, letting the Marauders map fall at his side. He stands there silently, watching Draco's blond hair shimmer in the moon light, gently blowing in the wind. A picture of perfection that warms his heart. He watches - his eyes filed with love, knowing the blond is all his.
Harry looks up at him, their eyes burn into each other with want for a few seconds, but then Harry averts his eyes down to his food quickly.
I can't say I'm sorry about the she-Weasley, but then you know what I want Potter. So, if I'm honest like Madam Sornaya has been encouraging me to be, then I'd have to admit that makes me somewhat hopeful. However, I also know how close you are to the Weasleys, so I'm assuming you are not fond of the tension. I hope therefore, for your sake, that this will not impact your holiday too negatively. Perhaps, in a few days, the she-Weasley will reel in her fangs and be open to a more platonic relationship with you. If she is screwing Dead Thomas as your letter implied, then she should have no reason to be angry with you.
Each step closer that Potter took, was another skip of his heart… and what Draco didn’t see, was that Harry was using wandless magic to lift a small mound of snow that sat behind him. Distracted by the oncoming raven-haired man, he almost squeaked in shock when that mound crashed over his head and snow exploded over his entire body.
"I just don't like closed spaces much." Harry said no more on the subject, the lifted 'dinged', the doors opened and Harry sped out and into the non-fiction section of the library.
And for a second, before his thoughts were interrupted by Mr Sayer, he couldn’t stop the thought about how time had gone so fast during his snow battle with Potter this evening…
wanted to – which they did not. The two girls that had previously screamed at the mice, looked a bit disgusted at the idea of rodents roaming the castle, but they hung their heads in shame. Draco wasn’t exactly keen on rodents himself, but they were harmless – often eating scraps of food around the school or the kitchens, but otherwise they were mostly unseen – and no one had ever been bitten by a wild rat or mouse when he was student here.
of January – and that he would not be permitted his wand outside of lessons or unsupervised for the first four weeks of term. Mrs Avery – Silas’s mother – had collected her son’s wand after her meeting with Minerva back on the 19
"He was, yeah…" Harry paused as he heard the shrill voice of a frazzled mother, demanding her son come away from the window as they had lots to get done, "…but he wants to practice. Hufflepuff have some great players this year…" Harry had to pause again, to let a herd of giggling girls pass by with their Christmas shopping. He found himself pressed up close to a warm body… Draco's body – unchanged, unlike his glamoured facial features. Draco's hand gripped his shoulder as the man glared at the 'impertinent' females.
Draco spat, then he nearly knocked Harry over as he spun around and left the room - slamming the door shut behind him. Neither of them had noticed the radio's sudden appearance, or the date and time clearly displayed as: Saturday September 5th 1998, 6pm.
Draco: "Babe, not a bloody minute goes by when I'm not thinking of you. I hope you love me just as much, or enough to say yes, otherwise I'm making a huge fool of myself. Harry James Potter, will you do me the honor, after we finish school of course, of becoming my husband?"
his living room, snapped him out of his train of thoughts. It had been stupid to think he could avoid the raven-haired man completely – they were colleagues! He’d given it his best attempt however, but this was just work… he could do his job and no more. Harry was also correct in that – they
“A mouse, actually!” Filius Flitwick added, nodding from a few seats up in his modified – raised chair. He wasn’t angry, but a little disappointed. “That was quite an unnecessary commotion from you too Miss Adair.” Filius address his first year Ravenclaw with a shake of his head.
“Erm, Merry Christmas Draco!” Harry smiled, taking the offered coffee before going to the table to address the owls.
“No!” Harry interrupted again. “I never got anything from them. I never got to celebrate Christmas with them.”
“Actually yes! Can you please inform Professor McGonagall that Mr Malfoy has the Snowflu, and that I have been asked to stay with him by Madam Pomfrey.”
He wasn’t satisfied though; he wanted more proof before he had to let go of his illusion of Tau. He’d said it before, but Tau was intoxicating and charismatic and wonderful, and he didn’t want to give that up. It felt like he was suddenly grieving for a man he’d never met, that reality was now knocking and he had no choice but to let Tau go.
Random students appear again, and Draco moves to avoid them - finding himself turning down the wrong hallway.
He had been trying to decide all day if he should write something to Tau or not. He didn’t want to come across as desperate, but he really wanted to know if Tau was still speaking with him or not. ‘
“I get It Potter. As for tomorrow, shall we say lunch time, twelve, and I’ll meet you at your room?” Draco flicked his wand and muttered a spell to turn off the flame. He levitated the hot metal kettle and started putting together the coffee.
“No. That’s not what I meant. I just wondered what happen to cause your absurd eating habits. You eat small amounts, when you feel hungry, I presume, and you eat a lot of meat. You rarely join us in the Great Hall for meals, and you always seem to wait until everyone else starts eating before you do.”
“Draco NO!” Harry shouted, rushing over and stopping him. What on earth had possessed Draco to such actions? Harry knew he hated the Dark Mark, but it was telling how much he despised it if he was willing to hurt himself trying to remove it in such a way. It upset him how delirious, how confused Draco had become so suddenly, and something had stricken the man’s mind to draw such a response. Harry wondered what Draco had remembered, had thought about…
, Draco thought, when the girl in question looked contrite at his glare. “Forgive me if I missed the latest,” he drawled, “but I’m quite certain that the customary behaviour of one at the dinner table, is still to remain
The hardest part about writing the letter, was admitting something to his ex-rival that was rather embarrassing. If he didn’t admit it, he wouldn’t be able to explain his ‘ignorance’ as Malfoy had put it. It also wasn’t exactly a secret either; the rest of the staff knew.
putting your hands out when you fall. That's what it is like for me - trying to change the part of myself I hate, its embedded as instinct. I don't need - nor want you too save me Potter. If you give me a second chance ... I only ask for patience from you while I work it out. I can't promise I won't be an outstanding cock-up agian, but maybe we come to an agreement at least?"
The threat currently, was that a student may slip him – or one of the other teachers, an altered version of the draught of living death. Draco was confident that the Wiggenweld potion would still be the best first course of action should anyone be poisoned, and a few teachers had vials on hand. They seemed to have everything under control, there was no evidence to say that Silas would actually do anything nor that it would be tonight, and It certainly wasn’t as deadly as Basilisks or dark lords.
Harry: "Why would I break up with Ginny? She never cheated on me, that was an act to get my attention. And, how do you know that?"
He folded his letter, making a note to thank Miss Vixen, and then slide it into his jeans pocket before continuing to play around with the tables. He had no idea how many students he would have in each of his classes yet, but if he halved the number of first years starting … he guessed thirty-two wouldn’t be a far-off estimation for the number of students his classroom needed to hold at full capacity. Now he just needed to figure out how to get thirty-two students into his class with room for spell casting and practical work.
Harry hid the wand behind his back, as he and Draco turned to see Neville and Filius waiting for them.
What had he been thinking? If Draco found out that he’d lied, found out that he’d only made the visit to seek out evidence, he’d be throttled by the man. He groaned, not only that, but he hated lying. He could hold back the truth, refuse to talk about things, but outright lying made him feel terrible – especially when it wasn’t for the greater good.
“Potter!” Draco wanted to say something, but again, he had no idea what he actually wanted to say. He had a desire to see if they fit… to see if their lips slotted together the way he imagined they would. Surely Harry’s lips were as unique and addicting as the man himself was.
“As I was saying…” Draco glided between the student tables as he spoke, not unlike that of one Professor Snape but with more elegance. “I expect you all to know how to create the Hiccoughing Solution by your next potion lesson. The potion takes precisely forty-three minutes to make – if you are competent, and seeing as your next lesson with me is last period on Monday, anyone who fails to make the potion correctly will stay behind. I suggest you familiarise yourself with the process thoroughly, because there will not be time during the lesson. Any questions?”
“I do, yes.” Draco answered. He was being honest, he really did like Padfoot … in fact, he might even go as far as to say that he was in love with the Padfoot he’d envisioned, but at the same time he felt like he was turning Harry down.
“I’m not a child Harry! I do know what extremities are.” Draco then picked up the spoon on his tray and started to eat his porridge. “Eugh! It’s bloody bland.” He complained, adding some of the honey and Cinnamon he then spotted on the tray.
Draco ducked when Harry sent a charmed parchment bird at his head. Draco laughed, grabbing his own wand to retaliate, and as Harry ducked out of the way of the dancing jinx he smiled. The smile that the blond wore was one that Harry hoped he would see more of. That smile was Christmas come early, everything Harry would ever need, and as light as air.
His new coffee, along with the buttered toast - and jam should he want some, appeared next to him on his bedside table. He sipped at the hot, strong liquid and started his reply.
Draco swished his hand in circular motion, and Harry’s robes billowed until they fell straight and crease free.
Harry tried to nod, but the spinning room threatened to make him vomit again. He tried to grab the potion vile, but he was too off balance and his hand grasped at air. Still gasping for breath, he felt a hand gently tip his head back so he could take the potion that Draco was now pouring into his mouth.
-Hermione holding a baby girl with Ron beside her. Harry and Draco smile at them, them share a look.
“Of course, I wouldn’t have agreed otherwise.” Draco smirked. “As long as let me buy you a decent outfit Potter! Call it a Christmas gift if you like, but I refuse to be seen with you Christmas day if you insist on wearing those rags!”
“Yes. I remembered these from my stay in France,” Draco explained as Harry went to fetch it, “and I ordered you one. I do hope you don’t take it the wrong way, but if you don’t appreciate it or it offends you, I’d rather you just say so and I’ll send it back.”
It felt right, it felt good, and Harry knew it was only a matter of time before he fell in too deep. He could already feel himself falling…
…They might be crazy things, but Harry loved the way Tau’s mind worked. His philosophical and theoretical way of thinking was intriguing and intelligent. He respected that about the man, and found it an attractive trait…
“Maybe I will ask him… to meet me that is.” Draco used his drink as an excuse to look away from green eyes. If Harry did like him as he suspected, then Harry was sure to be hurt by his dedication to Padfoot.
Draco held Harry, shocked to witness the raven-haired man sobbing and shattered on the bathroom floor. Harry didn’t break down! Harry was strong! But right now, Harry was sobbing on his shoulder and holding onto him so tightly that it hurt.
“Oh, I’d say… a cross between Myrtle’s bathroom, a four-hundred-year-old abandoned classroom, and the dark depths of the Forbidden forest – and then times that by at least a hundred and fill with dark artifacts. I could always just show you a memory in a pensive.”
“I have to try Minerva!” Harry repeated. “He’s just a boy! If it doesn’t work then contact Mr Graves by all means, but you know Silas will go down for life for this. If he does, it changes nothing. Tom Riddle was failed by adults, look how that turned out. If we don’t try then Silas remains at fault with his misguided views, and he stays angry with me and people that support me. His anger could grow into something nasty, something worse!”
“If you’re sure about this then… I was thinking about adding some of mine.” Draco looked up at Harry. “My memories that is. I saw him … torture and … kill his followers, others too, but if … if…” Draco took a deep breath and exhaled. “If it helps then you’re right, it will be worth it.” Draco closed his eyes.
They hadn’t shared much: bits and pieces of trivial things, exchanged apologies, and reviewed how prepared they were for the new school year, but … Harry honestly found it nice to have someone other than Neville to talk to.
“No Draco! You kept you and your family alive. If Narcissa had – if she hadn’t been there to lie to Tom, I might have died and stayed dead. We all have a knock-on effect; we all played a part. Even the terrible things Tom
“Intends to harm you, you mean.” Draco corrected, giving Harry a pointed look as he followed suit – sitting in the chair to Harry’s right, before returning his gaze to Minerva. “I believe he may have an altered version of the draught of the living death, and that he intends to slip it Mr Potter’s way.”
-Thursday 11th March: the outskirts of the forbidden forest. Draco slams Harry against a tree, whispering into Harry's ear before licking it, teasing it with his teeth. He slowly starts to sucks on Harry's neck, working his hands down until he finds his prize.
“NO!” Harry almost shouted, the words blurting out before he’d even had a chance to consider Draco’s question. He didn’t have time to wonder why he felt so strongly about that, because he was already trying to fix his mistake. “I mean, n-no you’re fine. This is nice. I mean, it’s strange that we’re here sharing coffee and not about to hex each other, but … it’s pleasant.” Harry gesticulated and then held his breath, offering a small smile and hoping the blond wouldn’t run off.
By the end of the letter, Harry's cheeks were aching from smiling so much. Draco's was a first class, pompous idiot, but he loved Draco's way with words. Despite some of the more embarrassing content, he re-read the letter multiple times. He could hear Draco's voice as he read the words, imagined him rolling the quill in his fingers as he thought of what to write, and visualized the way his head would tilt as his quill formed words over the parchment.
-Uses the exploding charm to blast his bedside table up. Then slides to the floor against his chest of draws.
Draco glared at anyone that dared to come too close to them – the man didn't mind crowds per se, but he hated being touched and knocked into. Harry was in the same frame of mind actually, but he had more tolerance for rambunctious crowds when they didn't know his real identity… Yes, they'd never get anything done if they knew their '
Draco chuckled and shook his head. Harry found himself mildly jealous - Draco even chuckled elegantly, it was soft, breathless and warming, where as his own was deep and rough.
When he returned to his classroom, a cold shiver ran down his spine when he observed the cold smirk that Silas wore on his face – it was there for just a second before it morphed into a sneer of hatred, but it had definitely been there.
He was ashamed to admit – even if it was just to himself – that he needed Draco to be there when they viewed the memories. He’d been thinking about precisely what memories to show Mr Avery, and just the thought of them unsettled him. Yes, he’d grieved for the lives lost in the war, learnt not to place the blame so heavily on his own shoulders, and spent years in therapy, but his flashbacks and emotions simply failed to understand logic and reasoning; it wasn’t logical to lose his mind to visions when he thought back to certain events, and it made no sense because he’d been through all the motions towards recovery… but it didn’t matter! His head was fucked up, and he knew he’d need the support when the time came. Worst case scenario: he’d have a flash back, and Mr Avery would take advantage of his lack of awareness and attempt to kill him. Best case: he’d be slightly affected and he’d have Draco there for support.
Harry exited the bathroom - in his black cotton, long sleeved pyjamas after his shower, and climbed into bed. He opened the draw of his bedside table and pulled out the charmed parchment and quill, smiling when another message had appeared.
Harry closed the door behind him, a few students hurried down the halls to make curfew, and the moving portraits settled down for the night inside their own frames.
Draco: "No one else is effected by whatever magic is affecting us Potter. If we tell anyone they'd think we were insane! Or at the very least ... they'd blame me."
Harry took a moment to gather his wits about him and remember that he had students to escort to the Gryffindor tower. He’d felt bereft of the warmth that had seemed to radiate from Draco’s own cold body somehow, and he thought, just for a moment, that Draco had shared his desires. He’d probably imagined it; their battle and the cold having affected his better judgement… but there was still a tiny ray of hope that came from the way Draco had stared at him. The only thing was, if Draco did share his feelings – or even a fraction of them – why would he claim that it would never work between them? That’s what he said, right?
“He’s dangerous Potter!” Draco insisted just as firmly, yanking his arm away. If Harry hadn’t been bloody Potter and fought of the curse so easily, Harry would have attacked him. He was also fuming that Harry could have been attacked or hurt for his actions under the effects of the curse.
Draco had just entered Harry’s private rooms at Hogwarts, and he took his usually seat in the left Armchair.
-Eyes of hate, malice, and scorn followed Draco as he exited the 8th year common room. Walking slowly, and woefully to the courtyard.
"I best get going Harry," Draco announce as he stood up, "I'll visit Diagon Alley in the morning and catch up with you when I get back."
And this is where I give credit to the original singers and owners of the songs I have used in this story, for entertainment purposes only.
“Mother did consider returning for the holidays,” said Draco, answering Minerva’s latest question regarding his mother’s well-being, “but I assured her it wasn’t necessary. She has been keeping busy with the book story… and I believe her attention has been greatly occupied with a possible male companion.”
“We’ll be just behind you. Go on ahead!” Harry smiled, watching as Neville frowned, shrugged, and then left with Filius. Harry then pulled out his wand.
His first reaction was to apologize, let her know he wouldn't be coming back to the Burrow, and that he never meant to hurt Ginny. He was quite surprised when she stopped his ramblings with a tight hug, and told him he was being stupid.
“Not exactly.” Harry admitted. “I just don’t need that much food – okay!” It was true, he’d always eaten little and been content. He hadn’t felt the true pains of hunger for years, just the typical, over used phrase that many meant when they said ‘I’m starved, I could eat a horse!’ So many people said that, but they’d never experienced real hunger.
Draco was just stuffing the familiar parchment and quill under his pillow. Harry really couldn’t deny it any longer. Draco was Tau! Sure, it could just be another coincidence but… who was he trying to kid? How much more evidence did he really need?
“No one to spend it with.” Harry almost whispered, but he meant it as understanding. He may have the Weasleys, but their lives were separate to his own – they were family in a way, but they also weren’t. He didn’t want to feel like the odd wheel, the way he always did when he was amongst them all.
Harry didn't know where that had come from, but it had McGonagall speechless for a moment. Draco on the other hand, found Harry's assertiveness damn sexy!
blowing up cauldrons, but she could brew potions to ‘exceeds expectations’ level when she concentrated. This year she had increased her penchant for explosive errors, but she had also become careless and nervous. It wasn’t like her, and it would be best for her head of house – Neville Longbottom – to know that something was off.
Before attempting to get some much-needed sleep, Harry decided what he was going to write back to Tau. He decided to respond as if nothing had changed, and to be fair… nothing may have changed at all–
Draco: "Don't Potter! I Don't want you're fucking pity. Save your heroics for all the damsels in distress that swoon over you like Ginger."
For now, he would continue with his quill and parchment, and continue to crush on the illusion he was painting in his mind - it was such a splendid and delicious illusion.
Harry knew that Graves wouldn’t have the same liberty that he did when it came to the minster of magic himself, but it would remind Auror Graves to think carefully before he tried to fuck with him and his own. He smiled warmly, as if this was an everyday conversation between them.
Draco and Harry were sat in the Three Broomsticks,  both with a tankard of warm foaming Butterbeer, and mid conversation.
Draco: "Come of it Potter. The whole damn school knows about it. You're not happy with Ginger, so why not just cut her loose?"
Harry fought hard to pay attention as Kreacher continued... fought to listen, unless he wished to sink into the past.
“I'm a wizard.” Draco explained, as if it was obvious, and he was smirking proudly at his own attire. “And what are you supposed to be?” He frowned at Harry, eyeing him up and down.
Harry felt bad for threatening the reporter, but he should be aware of the outstanding agreement Harry has with news reporting agencies; Harry will only talk to them if they made an appointment, and he refused to answer questions when accosted in the street. In fact, the agreement states that they would lose the right to print anything about him should one of their employees forcefully question him in the streets for example, and if that right was revoked and they still ran a story about him, they would be sued.
With his addled brain - due to over work and tiredness - it started to become obvious that he wouldn’t get anymore planning done tonight. It was quite late, and the words, numbers, and lesson plans were starting to merge together in ridiculous ways. He was also pretty confident that his third-year students should not be trying to defeat a boggart by using the patronus charm on it, but then, he couldn’t think why it sounded like the right thing to do.
a divorce, but requesting one is demeaning. She wouldn’t have any access to the Malfoy vaults or properties any longer either. If you were to deem her marriage in breach of the marriage contract, or express concern for her wellbeing as the Lord of Black, she could be released of her vows without condemnation and blame. She’d probably be entitled to a substantial sum of the Malfoy funds – well, what remains of my fathers that is, as indemnification.”
Harry didn’t miss the - ‘she wouldn’t be so friendly to me otherwise’ that was left unsaid. Harry felt sorry for Draco - that he still held such insecurities, but he knew it would be ill received if he expressed it. Harry himself, used to be guilty of seeing only one side to Draco - the side he wanted to see or expected to see, but not anymore. In fact, he hadn’t been so blind since their first coffee together.
“His mother will keep her trap shut when her options are to do just that or to see her son thrown into Azkaban.” Harry calmly explained,
There were two things he wanted to know above all else; Was Tau, without a shadow of a doubt, Draco Malfoy? And, what was Draco’s true personality?
Yes, his mother had mentioned a man – many times in fact, in her correspondence to him – and if he’d read the letter correctly, then he was certain she had been alluding to a growing relationship with one Valerius Cantrelle. One didn’t simply mention the same man twenty times between three letters, if one was only a regular to her shop. The fact he was so regular spoke volumes… perhaps he needed to pay his mother a visit and scoop out this Valerius!
… you scared?” Harry raised his eyebrows as Draco glared daggers at him. Harry just sat there drinking his coffee with a smug grin on his face.
-This story is corny, a bit fast paced, a bit illogical, might make no sense in some parts, and was made for fun only. (Please ask if you get confused at any time.)
“No.” Harry’s voice started sombre - his eyes cold as he stared into shocked grey ones, but it grew louder and angrier the more words spilled from his lips. “No of course not Draco, because I didn’t carry a part of him, of
Hermione: "What's brought all this on Harry? I'm all for inner-house unity but this is Malfoy we're talking about."
“I came to check you were still breathing actually. Wouldn’t want to miss the show if you suddenly dropped dead – the boy who lived, killed by poison at the hand of a teenager. I’d pay a lot for front row seats.” Draco smirked, eyeing up the spider decorated chocolate muffins on the table.
Well, that didn’t fucking help him, now did it! Harry just shook his head, making sure Draco was tucked in, snug, under the two thick blankets. For good measure, he applied warming charms to them too.
"Oh, erm..." He interrupted her. "I'm not sure. I don't mind muggle borns, half-bloods or pure-bloods ... but I'm not sure on the others. N-not that I have anything against them, I have friends that-"
Harry stood, mildly shocked for a few seconds, then he shook his head and chuckled before rushing of to see if Draco was alright.
At risk of a spoiler, I wish to warn my dear readers that this chapter contains a scene where Draco scratches himself rather harshly. It falls under self harm, but for Draco, it isn't really intended as self-harm. Please ask if you need more info. And comment if you liked the chapter. XD
"Yes, Potter." His answer was a little snappish. Harry raised his eyebrows at the irritated way he'd responded, handing him a cup of coffee all the same. "Thank-you Harry," he amended, "well, you best get some parchment and make that list then. The Weasley's breed like rabbits, I'm surprised you only forgot
Harry ate in silence, watching the students as his duty as teacher, and wondering what pudding might be sent up tonight. Once the main course was finished, he found out: Double chocolate gateau, black forest gateau, ice-cream, and fruit salad bowls. He sighed … no treacle tarts.
to be there; he couldn’t jeopardise the only opportunity they had to help Silas reform – if it was even possible – and that meant delaying the date of their inevitable meeting.
“Don’t be ridicules Potter – Harry.” Draco spoke between mouthfuls. “I’m not some foolish child that doesn’t know when to stop.”
Draco: "I don't know Potter. All I know is that we haven't got that fucking radio, and we have no proof except our word. They'll point the finger straight at me. You're the fucking chosen one i'm ... as Weasley so kindly put it, a 'traitorous wanker'."
“I don’t know exactly.” Harry admitted, rubbing the back of neck. “Hermione has already questioned and tested me to death, and she thinks that my hatred of the house – its darkness, and depressing smog if you like, pissed me off so much that during my rage, I somehow got my wish to be rid of it. I was just happy to know that I wouldn’t go mad living here. After that, the house was easier to clean and decorate. I didn’t get my job at the school for a few months, so I spent all my free time on the house. I discovered that I get bored siting on my butt all day, so I got right into it and obliterated the place.” Harry shook his head and smiled at a memory. “I remember inviting the Weasleys over for dinner after I did the first two floors; Molly wasn’t sure it would be a good idea – said it would be safer to go to them, everyone else dragged their feet over, but once they got here… I swear it took an hour to pick up their jaws off the floor.”
“I did too Harry. You’re not a total failure of a host you know. Perhaps we should do this again sometime.” Draco smiled, sliding out the door and into the draughty corridor.
“You unscrew this,” Harry explained, “and you can use the pipette or magic to put the ink inside. You don’t need to dip it into the ink, you just write. It will last for about eighty inches of constant writing before you need to refill it.” Harry waited for the nod before continuing, trying not to smile as Draco’s look of surprise and awe stayed plastered to his face. “You have six different tips, from very flat to very pointy, so you will have to figure out which one you prefer. If the ink doesn’t flow, if it dries up a bit, or you wish to change tip or change ink colour, you can clean it with warm water or just use a cleaning charm. It’s actual gold, so it is okay to use magic on it. You just screw them back on like this.”
cracker with Miss Munson that caused the interruption. They didn’t usually pull the crackers until pudding, so it was premature, but the girl shouldn’t look so whipped.
Harry paused, remembering how a couple of his students last year had handed in a twelve-inch paper with just a long list of uses. It was for a shield charm likewise, but the students had obviously copied each other, and in the long list of creative uses, included shielding them from bullies, against unwanted suitors, and against someone’s flatulence.
Harry went to snatch the radio from Draco, but he pulled it back. Blaise and Pansy laughed. Harry tried again, but he ended up falling into Draco's chest.
“He doesn’t – He just – I think he must have done that years ago. I really don’t think it’s something he still does. If I had to guess, I’d say he did that not long after the war. He probably just wanted to remove the mark… nothing else.”
Suffice to say Herbology was hell. Every time they past each other, looked at each other ... heard each other for crying out loud, there would only be one thing on their minds. Harry and Draco being who they were, wanted to make it more of a challenge - they teased each other.
’ He though, picking up the quill and deciding to just go for it. He’d never get any work done if he just sat there staring and waiting.
-As the sun sets, Draco hovers to take in the scene. Harry suddenly nudges him, before shooting after the Snitch - Draco on his tail.
"With the student numbers finally increasing, I'm am looking forward to great year." Headmistress McGonagall informed them all with a warm, excited smile. Harry tore is eyes away to look at the headmistress instead.
Once the war had ended, Harry was finally allowed to be himself. He was free to build his own life and make selfish choices. Therapy had helped him realised that he’d always acted how others expected of him, and they had asked him to think about what he wanted for himself - and not because it was expected of him. Harry had finally accepted that yes, he did have Slytherin tendencies; He might not have been that ambitious, but he could be very cunning and crafty when he wanted to be. He didn’t wear his emotions so openly – he was never allowed to growing up anyway, and the media certainly didn’t need to know about his real emotions.
“Draco! Draco, wait!” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and spun him around. “If it makes you feel any better, I like men too.”
Well, at least he knew what the Warmendall potion was, not that he’d had a reason to see it before – nor had he ever brewed it. He trusted Poppy however, so he did as he was instructed.
"Sorry Draco, I – I think I'll just get this book for Arthur." Harry said, not wanting to talk about the place his mind had just taken him too. He hurried back to the elevators, tapped the book as he waited for the 'ding', and fidgeted again as they went down.
Draco dropped his spoon as the hand holding it turned blue. The spoon fell onto the floor and clattered while Draco grimaced in pain. Looking down at the ice on his nails, the frost that covered his fingers, Draco frowned in alarm – “What in Salazar’s name?”
Draco nodded, so Harry went to check with Poppy that honey and cinnamon wouldn’t affect the potions that Draco had taken.
With a crack, the hills were once again left in solitude under the calm night sky. The wind caressed the grass back to shape, from where two teachers had once laid - releasing some of their long-carried burdens. Even the stars seemed to wink knowingly as the moon rose to guard the night.
“You are correct,” he started, not wanted to dash her confidence, “but remember that any colour has a very wide, and maybe even an infinite range of shades. Blue, while correct, doesn’t tell me much.” Draco summoned a transparent glass vial, and added plain water with the Aguamenti charm. “Observe!”
“Y-Yeah that sounds like a good idea.” Draco played it off as if he’d finished book browsing and simply wanted to sit back down. “What about the secrecy though? What if someone over hears us, or you need your potions, or- What?”
Harry had left Draco to his thoughts while he talked with the students and the other teachers – trying not to be the awkward one at the table that sat in silence. It seemed that Draco was still being limited with him though, only talking about trivial things or work, and quickly retreating from communication if it got too much or run past his quota for the day. He still glanced Draco’s way; he just couldn’t help it! He was fool in love and Draco had no idea that Harry’s heart was frozen, anxious, and waiting with bated breath – or in this case, with bated beats – for the answers that would only come when the truth came out about Padfoot.
Remember that no good would come from avoiding what was so totally obvious; remember that he would gain nothing from being blissfully ignorant; and remember, that if he could face his death – literally, then he could face this.
Harry opened the second letter, eager to read what the mystery blond had to say, and the very first line had him chuckling.
“It’s Halloween!” Harry decided. “I have Mr Haines saying he had nothing to do with it, and you two insisting he did.” Harry held up his hand to stop Cain butting in. “No mater your argument, I have two sides of the story. We can either debate this all night in my office, or, considering your property Miss Raines, is returned and intact, we can be mature and walk away – enjoying the rest of your day. What will it be?”
“Oh, but I would! But that wouldn’t gain me anything now would it. Would you feel better if I was a Slytherin? If it was a fellow Slytherin that had Slytherined you?” Harry asked, a smug look on his face. Oh, he was really enjoying this. Teasing Draco this way was delicious. Draco had never been on the receiving end of Harry’s Slytherin tendencies.
“Slytherins unorganised? Merlin help us the day that happens. I’m sure you will find the time to round up any Slytherin stragglers mind you …
Harry shook his head in disbelief. He made to leave - exasperated and hurt, but Draco grabbed his arm.
“Please, excuse me!” Draco politely excused himself from the table. He left the Great Hall, forcing himself to walk normally, but once he was in the corridor he walked briskly to his private chambers.
"What is the secret parchment service exactly? How does it work?" Harry asked, subconsciously biting his lip.
-Saturday, 3rd October, outside the Great Hall. Draco shoved over by three Gryffindor students. They spit at him.
Harry was washing his hands at the sink, listening to Draco trying to string his words together. It was actually funny - Draco Malfoy mumbling and rambling.
Malfoy had a strange look in his eyes then, and if Harry didn't know any better, he'd swear there was actual remorse there. Seeing as Malfoy didn't say anything more, Harry turned and left in a huff. He didn't need to start fights or confrontations with his old school rival, the fact was, they weren't students anymore. It didn't stop the blond prat making him feel like a bloody student again though.
“I understand Potter –- Harry.” Draco nodded, and he seemed sincere. The prat probably liked to know everything though. He’d be like that kid with the secret, ever growing stash of candy - even if he had no intention of ever sharing it or eating it. Yes, Draco probably had some degree of hunger for knowledge.
Three days the students had been back, and already Harry had so much homework to mark. He had tried to forget about Draco for the time being, burying himself into his work, grading with a furious dedication, but he could not stop his mind wandering when things reminded him of the man.
Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Harry sighed. Oscar would insist he had nothing to do with it until he was blue in the face and then some. Harry couldn’t prove it was him, and it to be honest, it wasn’t something he would expect of Mr Oscar Haines.
“Ah. That would be to save our hide from Minerva’s wrath should we fail to meet the years curriculum.” Draco smirked.
He left the small room and closed the door, reminding himself that he would definitely have to mark the second-year Gryffindor and Slytherin’s essays over the weekend - seeing as they were due back on Monday, and he should also make the seventh-year Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw’s essays priority as well. He also needed to analyse the results of the start of years tests, and incorporate what needed to be revised into this year’s curriculum.
Draco was interrupted by a loud bang of a nearby cracker. Two fifth year Hufflepuffs – Miss Briana Payne, the girl that had blown up many cauldrons this year, and Miss Ella Munson – had just pulled the first Christmas cracker. Both girls were laughing as Miss Payne donned a rather large, bright-yellow sunhat, featuring dancing reindeer. The typical squeak of mice was followed with an obnoxious squeal of horror from Miss Josephine Prescott – a second year Slytherin, who jumped to stand on her bench, and an equally ear-piercing shriek from Miss Leona Adair – a first year Ravenclaw.
“Yes, she seems much calmer now, but she is obviously still worried about something. It’s important that you try and get her to speak up.” Madam Pomfrey then disappeared into her office.
Harry laughed as he reread a certain question on his parchment that night – a question that Tau-Draco had asked him.
They both arrived late to breakfast, after a trip to the infirmary, and both center of attention as they walked into the Great Hall. Harry didn't even say bye to Draco as he stomped to the Gryffindor table - slumping down next to Ron. Most of the Gryffindors knew to be wary of Harry's temper, but not Seamus.
There was no closing, but that wasn’t uncommon - Harry chuckling to Tau’s reply wasn’t uncommon either. No, what was unusual, was the feeling of satisfaction that had allowed an indescribable feeling to sneak up on him. It was like standing in the warm sun, but he couldn’t place it enough to name the emotion. Maybe it was simply a mixture of warm emotions that he couldn’t separate, but he was most certainly happy.
“Potter?” Draco frowned, backing up in confusion and reaching for his own wand in defence. Harry advanced on him… then stumbled…grunted and forced his wand to lower.
“Well, I’d like to see you do better! As for Mrs Black …  It was the day I was basically fired from work, due to my - well you saw why today.” Harry unfolded his arms and sighed. “I came home in a raging fit, slamming things, breaking things, and the state of the house only spurred me on. I didn’t regret breaking anything because it was all destined to be burned anyway. Then dear old Mrs Black’s portrait started screaming and insulting me and my lack of employment, and next thing I knew… I had blown up the wall – literally. That window at the end of the entrance hallway… let’s just say, it hasn’t always been there.”
Harry instantly went up the stairs - dragging Draco behind him by the hand, and into what looked like an old living room. Harry popped down his small bag - containing his shrunk shopping and turned to apologize for the house's state, but Draco had initiated a fiery make out session. As they landed on the old couch, they started coughing as dust swooped around them - the smell of mold not the right ambiance for the moment. It was because of that, that Harry shrunk the current couch, and returned the new the new one he brought today into its original size.
Other times were born from grief, mental pain, and the questioning of oneself. I will admit that a lot of times, even though I had people around me, I felt alone. Feeling alone with so many questions and painful emotions, well, it would make one question their sanity I suppose.
"A little nervous." He admitted, and offered her a shy smile. He wasn't about to admit how he'd been feeling a moment ago though.
Harry chuckled. Draco was a prat, but he was his prat. Their lips met for round two of their overdue make out session.
"It educates the reader on the advancement of medical related tools and practices. Like this," Harry turned the book for Draco to see, "this is what they used to do in the middle ages." Harry pointed to the section that explained the process of cauterization – how they would burn a wound to prevent bleeding and infection.
“But I don’t wanna go to bed.” Draco’s sleepy voice sounded so childish. Well, Harry thought… that would be the childlike symptoms.
As just like that, Draco turned to leave. Harry grabbed Draco's arm to stop it; he don't know why he did it, why he didn't just let him leave, but he was confused. A part of him that would never admit it - wasn't ready to lose the amazing scent that was Draco, it was just so criminally addictive.
Draco: "...so, I just thought. If you terminated things with Ginger - officially ... seeing as she cheated on you anyway, then you would be very much available to try it with someone else, ya know."
The look Harry gave him was akin to a beaten puppy not understanding why its owner was abandoning it – Fuck! He turned his head, suddenly remembering the pain that had flashed in Harry’s eyes as they'd briefly discussed the memories they planned to use in the pensive with Mr Avery. That look was almost identical. Did his rejection really hurt Harry as much as the man’s past traumas did? Surely not! The man would get over him…
Their eyes met - both sets blurry in their struggle to accept the truth of each other’s words. As their eyes continued to hold contact, and Harry could feel Draco’s heart beat beneath his hand, he felt an awkwardness suddenly descend on him like a cold shower – this had become far to mawkish for his taste.
Draco: "It's me ... Draco. Can I come in, we need to talk; I think you're right, I think we need to see McGonagall."
learn as opposed to anyone else. You turn over a card, have to do the spell correctly in a set time, or suffer a counter attack. It was genius - the game, but Draco didn't see the point. If he wanted to learn a spell he would just practice.
"You're not the first, and you won't be the last Mr Potter. Pushy, we-have-your-best-interests-at-heart friends, are the most common reason for nervous, hesitant customers. However, your voucher was purchased under a name not your own, and I may or may not remember the people who came and purchased it for one Mr Potter." She winked at him and smiled. "Says here you have the full secret parchment service. I'm not surprised. I am assuming your friends recognised the needs to keep your renowned name from influencing any potential suitors."
Yes, Draco had to concede. His mother had sent him an expensive robe that was more then suitable for potion masters to wear; it had charms to protect him against potion mishaps and fumes, and it was protected against staining – easy to clean. He was very grateful, and it did have an element of thought, but every year she gave him either that or dress robes. He wouldn’t mind something unexpected and … dare he say it… something more sentimental.
His guilt at finding Draco attractive was dissipating the more evidence came to light that he was in fact, Tau. At least he wouldn’t have to choose between them if he did develop feelings for Draco, and standing here before the man once again, he was reminded of the fact that it was actually a possibility. His feelings for Draco had always sat precariously on an edge – rocking between friendship, enemies, and something else entirely.
Harry heard Draco gasp, as three smoke created images erupted from the point where the two wands met. The first of the images, being the last spell Silas had used, showed a door where a key twisted locked and then melted away – the locking charm. The second image, a face with glazed eyes and a lost expression – the Imperius curse! The last one showed a feather with wings lifting a rock – the feather-light charm, and probably a spell Silas used earlier on his trunk.
“He still has the childish symptoms then?” Harry asked Poppy. “It’s been about thirty-eight hours. Shouldn’t they have lessened by now?”
As he stood up, letting the blanket hit the floor, he took two paces before throwing his half empty cup across the room. The broken shards of china representing his life, his heart… and the coffee that dripped down the wall onto the carpet mimicked his tears.
“It is a spell I utilize constantly, so yes.” Draco smirked, glad that Potter wasn’t acting weird anymore. “I don’t know why you’re so impressed Potter, I seem to recall you blowing up your house.”
Harry wasn’t sure why Draco had brought this gift for him exactly, but he had a few ideas: Draco didn’t want to find himself in that uncomfortable situation again with him, Draco was worried that he-Harry could be caught short one day, maybe he assumed that would make him-Harry feel more comfortable to know that had the potion nearby, but Harry assumed that Draco cared. Draco had seen him at one of his worst moments, had seen him weak, had seen him broken for a few minutes that day… He wasn’t judging Harry, wasn’t laughing or ridiculing him, and most importantly, he wasn’t asking if he was okay or offering pointless advice. Draco was trying to help make things easier for him, was offering a gift that, at this point in time, meant a great deal to him.
-Draco finally finds his feet, and holding back tears, Harry watches him leaving the Great Hall. His heart breaking for Draco; he never realized just how much hate Draco received until now.
collaborate our plans for Mr Avery.” Draco said, sticking to his job. It was safer this way – all work and no fun. Besides, he liked his own privacy, and Harry equalled news reporters printing his life and bringing attention to his ‘splendid’ history. No, Draco didn’t want his nefarious past rehashed in the papers either.
He'd been a huge fucking tosser over the years, he'd been a bastard, a cruel - heartless bully; he didn't know how to be anything else. Harry's world and his were so different, and he thought his was better ... until now. Thanks to his wonderful cock-sucking criminal of a father, and his mother who followed Lucius like lost puppy, Draco had been thrown under the night bus so to speak.
Harry braced himself, wand at the ready as pure excitement took hold of him, and he too lost himself to the anticipation of this friendly battle. The snow flurry that Draco had caused, morphed into a small blizzard – one that blinded him from his opponent, but he wasn’t afraid or nervous... this would be fun!
Molly: "Harry, you're like a son to me dear. No matter what you do, we would always forgive you for it. In this case though, I don't think you've done anything wrong, except leave rather rudely perhaps."
Draco sat in his room looking at the Daily prophet he had flattened out - creased and ripped slightly from throwing it earlier today. He watching as Harry's photo argued with the reporters that were slamming Harry for defending him at his trial back in July.
-Harry sorts his muggle money, then stand up to pay. Draco gets slapped by Hermione to pay attention. Ron chuckles.
Harry hoped that now they could continue to get to know each other, and that Tau would trust him to honour his word. It felt like a heavy weight had been lifted of his chest, and he was just waiting to find out what Tau had to say to him now.
Draco held his mask firmly in place, he didn’t want Harry to know what he was feeling… his desperate hope that Harry
“Yes, that’s fine. We don’t have any Warmendall on hand?” Harry knew the question was stupid the moment he asked, but he was worried.
“In your book, you swear blind that he was a spy for Dumbledore - that he was a good man. But I thought he hated you and vice versa?” Draco asked, eating his way delicately through a vol-au-vent. The crumbs neatly caught on the plate.
Draco's teasing angered Harry, who pulled out of Ginny's hold and stormed back over to Draco - much to Ginny's annoyance, and then Harry shoved him.
“His essay on that, was rather short, so I graded it as poor for the lack of facts … but during that lesson, when I handed their work back to them, Mr Avery created a scene over his grade. I won’t go into the details, but when another student showed their pride at receiving an outstanding mark, he mumbled that the killing curse would ‘help a lot with natural selection too’. I gave him detention, deducted house points, but even though I knew exactly what he was referring to, I had no solid proof to take to McGonagall. It was also later rumoured that he had been practising the Imperius curse on first year Hufflepuffs during that week, but without any evidence, nothing was ever done about it obviously.”
“You caught me.” Harry chuckled, knowing full we that the conversation was all in jest. The fact that he had been about to scan the room with his eyes was neither here nor there.
Harry: "Draco ... You basically just ambushed me to tell me you wanted to go out with me. I hope you don't call all your romantic interests by their surname."
Harry started thinking that he must like pure-bloods, because Tau was also a pure blood -- Draco also had blond hair, and they both-
“Aughhh! My head.” Draco complained Wednesday morning to a bossy Poppy. Such bizarre memories were circling in his usually organised mind – some that were horrifyingly embarrassing, and there were also periods that were just totally blank. He’d been reminded of his illness the moment he’d woken up, the bloody Snowflu of all things, and he blamed Potter! It was all Harry bloody Potter’s fault that he’d been in the hospital wing since Sunday evening.
Harry took the list from his pocket and went over them with Draco. He needed the antidote for pixies, blood replenishing potion and bite solution for vampire bats, and several vials of the beautification potion for the red caps he was introducing to the first years. Most of the potions he needed were emergency precautionary measures, but the beautification potion was an effective method to repel red caps.
That was his last lesson for the day. He tidied up the class room with a wave of his wand, scooped up the test papers and the book he had just finished into a box, and then retreated to his private rooms.
Harry blushed, knowing Draco meant the staring, the hounding, the begging him for a chance at friendship. It was made extremely clear - during whatever magic was doing this, that Harry was crushing over Draco. He still had a girlfriend though, and apparently Ginny was pissed with him for obsessing over Draco - instead of spending time with her. No one but Harry and Draco seem to know about his feelings though, it was like the spell or whatever, was providing the others with altered memories or something.
It was quiet solitude over the lake as he returned in a slower pace. He’d never seen anyone flying out here before, so it was surprising when that was exactly what he could see now - another rider. He instantly noticed that familiar platinum white-blond hair, almost glowing under the sunlight and reflecting the rays - Malfoy!
“And cinnamon?” Draco asked, unaware of Harry’s whirling thoughts, and hesitantly deciding that it wouldn’t be so bad if he could get honey
I will say this now, I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, AND THIS IF FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. I thank Joanne Kathleen Rowling, for her wonderful Harry Potter book series, that with out such, this fanfiction would never have existed.
“Yes sir! It’s been amazing really, and that Snowball fight between you and Mr Malfoy was…” Samuel coughed once to regain his composure and reel in his exuberance. “What I meant to say, sir, is that it’s been a rather enjoyable experience despite being the only first year here.”
“I almost forgot you were head of Slytherin now.” Harry’s smile was brief before he shook his head. “McGonagall agreed with me that Silas wouldn’t be continuing with my classes, but Avery’s mother was particularly verbal and threatening. She threatened to report me to the ministry for unfair treatment of her son because his father was a death eater, accusing me of being prejudice and vindictive. Ever since then, Silas sneers at me when we cross paths. I fear the boy will grow up to be more vindictive than his mother claimed
-Harry gets a punch to the arm by Ron, for not focusing on the potions. Draco shakes his head at him laughing.
Harry was about to write the words ‘I promise’, but he took the time to think about it first. Could he make such a promise and keep it?
“That Chimera didn’t look friendly!” Draco whined in obvious incredulity. “Where did it go?” Draco suddenly sat up again in fear, looking around in a desperate need to reassure himself of his safety, but Harry gently pushed Draco back down.
“An extension of the reverse spell. I learnt about it at the Auror department, but it’s kept a secret so that wizards can’t hide an illegal spell by just using another one to cover it. They would just use three spells to cover the illegal one if they knew about this spell.” Harry explained before pointing his wand down at Silas’ thin, long, ebony wand and spoke the spell. “Magis prior incantato tribus!”
Harry’s second year Slytherin and Gryffindor class were due soon, but he found himself sat at the teacher’s desk staring at the magical parchment with the purple quill in his hand.
, you levitated about thirty pounds on snow onto my head.” Draco reminded him of his delinquency, climbing off the bed now that his headache had dimmed to a mild throb. He found his wand on the bedside cabinet.
Draco glared daggers at him, so Harry continued. “Listen, whatever happened, it hit you hard enough to send you running. It obviously brough back bad memories. I’ll share some of my demons with you regardless, but as your friend, I’d like to understand a bit better.”
“Mmm. Sorry for intruding on you unannounced Potter -- Harry, but there was something I wished to discuss with you. Mind you, it might be nothing to worry about.” Draco sipped at his coffee, but Harry could see the slight frown he tried to hide. Draco appeared concerned or worried. This was Draco in a serious mood.
“What – what’s wrong?” Harry panted, eyes roaming every inch of Draco’s body to check for injury or distress.
Draco watched Harry disappear around the corner before closing his door. He sighed; trust Harry fucking Potter to leave an imprint on his heart, to worm his way into his life and make him feel things that should never be or never will be. He had Padfoot to think about, and he really hoped that the mystery man could make him forget all about his new feelings for Potter. Something however, was telling him … that wouldn’t be the case at all, and he’d have to make a choice sooner or later.
“No! I mean, no, I just needed…” Harry could have slapped himself; he was a terrible liar and this felt all kinds of wrong. Luckily Draco seemed to accept it though.
“Open them then Potter,” Draco picked one up and handed it to him, “It would be rude not to thank them for the gifts when we get to breakfast!”
He had turned Draco into a mess of small insecurities and doubt. He loved it! He also loved the fact that Draco listened to him and was even asking him – as Padfoot of course, questions that he had put into his mind in the first place. He wondered how long it would take before Draco stopped doubting Padfoot, how long it would take before Draco started trusting his own judgment again.
Harry banished the blanket to living room in a panic, yelling for Kreacher. “Find me some thick blankets!” He demanded of his house elf, and watching Draco shiver violently he snapped – “Quickly!”
passing on my message first of course. It’s the Gryffindors and the Hufflepuffs that I find need the extra time to gather their wits about them. Unless Harry makes an appearance soon, I fear that there will be chaos amongst the cats this morning.”
During Transfiguration class the next morning, Harry and Draco kept exchanging glances. They were meant to be learning a more complex spell - that let's the caster turn an inanimate object into another inanimate object of the caster's choice. It focuses on transforming objects that don't already have a set spell - like 'Scribblifors,' which is used to transform an object like a fork into a quill. Imagination, and concentration were the key components to the spell, but neither Draco nor Harry could focus.
Harry smiled and welcomed him in. Draco had been doing that a lot this week – saying ‘Potter’ then following with ‘Harry’ after a short pause, when they’d seen each other at dinner or in between classes. Harry guessed it was his way of reminding Harry of their friends - not friends’ status. ‘
“I was almost put into Slytherin you know,” Harry stated, “but I begged the hat not to for personal reasons. Hence, I went into Gryffindor. You know our history – of the Slytherin student Tom Marvolo Riddle, who grew up to become evil Lord Voldemort and who was obsessed with trying to kill one Mr Harry Potter. Well, can you blame me for not wanting to be in that house when I was eleven. If I could do it all over…” Harry sighed. “I might have allowed the hat to place me with the snakes.” Harry smiled at Samuel’s shocked face and winked. “I might not be your head of house, but If you ever need someone to talk to my door is always open to you.”
Harry loved teasing Draco; the wavering between pure-blooded bullshit and the real Draco was adorable! Harry was positively gushing inside, but outward, he would show no more than a smirk. “What’s your secret chérie like then?” Harry asked as if he was regarding the weather.
When everyone had departed the classroom, Draco folded his arms and sneered at Silas. It took a lot for Harry to stop comparing Draco to Severus, to stop thinking about Severus, but he was determined to listen to the blond and not let him mind wander.
He knew Tau was Draco – he fucking knew it!!! It was just that, having the evidence slapping him in the face was a whole new can of worms. Yes, he still had that tiny, minuscule feeling of in denial - what if it was all just a big coincidence, and what if Draco had a totally different chérie that wasn’t him at all? He scoffed at himself –
"Grow up Malfoy! It was a damn accident. Not that I'd expect you of all people-- You know what, never mind."
He suddenly remembered what his own therapist had said about him – something about his own childhood being deprived by his treatment of his aunt and uncle, his isolation and lack of normal childhood activities and experiences having shunted his development ... and not just physically.
“Thank you, Harry,” he managed to say as Harry sat back down opposite him, but he just stared at the Christmas gift most tingling in his hands.
He liked Draco – he really did, but the man was closed off and mercurial at best. Maybe that’s way he never saw Tau in Draco before now – if indeed he was correct in that assumption. Could Draco be expressing his true personality through Tau – the safety of the parchment providing a comfort net and making it possible for Draco to be himself, or was Tau Draco’s alter personality – a personality that Draco has created to project the person he wishes he was, or something to that degree?
Harry put the parchment to the side and plumped up his pillows. He called Kreacher to bring him a glass of milk and honey, and a glass of water for the night. The milk would help him get to sleep after too much caffeine, and it would also tie him over until breakfast.
“I often do.” Draco replied putting another spoon of gateau into his mouth. He swallowed before continuing. “If you’re asking me, if I want coffee with you however … then why?” Draco turned to face him.
“No! Not really…” A few seconds of silence passed before Samuel continued. “I heard how wonderful Christmas is at Hogwarts, and I choose to stay for the experience, but … I was shocked that I ended up being the only first year… everyone else is third year or up.”
"She gave as the day off remember; I doubt she's expecting us to turn up now." Harry smiled, but he looked away. He wanted to say something…
He was simply staring at him during breakfast that Monday morning, and he couldn't have given two flying fucks what other thought.
-Memories continue to play in patronus like images. Lucius scooping a running  3 year old into his arms. Draco watching stars with his mother at 4 years old. A lesson with his father at 5 years old- on posture, turned into laughing and exaggerated pompous behavior. Draco at 6 years old, curled on the window seat in his bedroom, reading his favorite book about magical creatures, myths and legends.
Miss Camellia Nixon was going to be just fine, classes were cancelled for tomorrow, and he’d just noticed that Tau had replied to him from earlier. The small smile that graced his lips was instantaneous, as was the warm bubbly feeling inside – dousing out his negative thoughts and feelings.
Draco explained that the ministry have temporarily seized Malfoy Manor and their bank vault, including his own personal one. That they are still deciding the details, and deciding how much of it will be used to cover damages the Malfoy's caused. Until then he hasn't a knut to his name.  He also admitted how he felt when he had to side alone apparate with Harry - the ministry have refused him any prospect of a licence until he turns nineteen.
. He noticed that it was a purple-blue colour, and the nails literally had ice on them. He was quite frankly shocked, startled and near panic as to what to do, but as he stared down at the frozen hand in his own, it suddenly returned to a normal colour, and the nails started dripping where the ice was now melting.
Harry was currently in a staff meeting - one that was just about to end, but he couldn't keep his eyes from wondering over to certain blond man he hadn't seen in about twelve years; one rather good-looking Draco Malfoy. Yes, Harry could admit when a man was gorgeous, even if their personality was ugly ... but the change in Malfoy was shocking.
“You need some socks.” Harry explained, finding them in the bottom draw of the chest of draws. “Here, let me put these on you.” Harry said, not waiting for an answer.
Knowing he’d take his dinner in his chambers later, he slipped into his short-sleeved pyjamas and black slippers. He threw the towel into the wash bin, then sat down at the table with a fresh cup of coffee. Sighing to himself, he opened the box to start pulling out his lesson plans.
Harry cleared Tau's message with the Othala rune and his quill feather. He felt a bit alexithymic in that he knew he was feeling a range of positive, almost excited emotions, but couldn't identify them singularly. He rubbed the feather against his chin, thinking of how to reply before staring to write.
He ran, leaving Draco standing there berating himself for being so mean, so callous, and so cruel to the boy that already had so much on his shoulders.
He wanted to be friends with Harry, but it was laughable. A Death Eater, and the savior.  Harry has enough to deal with, without his problems adding to them. It was also impossible, Harry's life would be ruined if he was apart of it. The problem was, he was addicted to Harry, curious about him, and was attracted to him something bad.
All the students work was sorted into boxes per class, and the boxes where then stored in the box room until needed. All the teachers’ rooms had a box room within their private chambers, a ‘box’ shaped room no bigger than six by six feet in size. Harry levitated the box containing his seventh-year Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw’s class essays over and into the small room, settling it down on the shelf next to the others. Shelves ran the length of two walls, the east and west one, leaving the last two bare except for time tables and memos.
Malfoy’s words threw Harry for a loop. Did he just apologies … to him? Not that he wasn’t grateful for it, but the Draco Malfoy that Harry once knew would never have admitted fault. Twelve years
He entered the room on the 5th floor, after knocking and being called in by an elderly witch. The old woman had purple spectacles on her long pointed noes, short grey hair left down, and was wearing purple robes. She smiled widely at him and pointed to the black arm chair across from her own. The room was bare grey stone when he entered, but as soon as he sat down ... it changed to Slytherin colours.
- 17th September 9am, Harry walks into herbology and stares at Draco - who ignores him, then he shakes his head and sits with Hermione and Ron in defeat.
Harry instantly saw fault in Filius plan, and quickly used a milder version of the Sonorous Charm before chaos and confusion broke out in the Hall.
Once he stopped laughing and chuckling, he pulled out the thick parchment with a special black-purple feathered quill. He read the note attached to it which explained that he must only use this particular quill with the parchment - that the ink needed lay inside the parchment itself - no ink was required. Once he had finished his message, he was to draw the Mannaz shaped rune on the bottom centre of the parchment and . The words would instantly send to its partner parchment and would only be readable to the person it was intended. Any received messages could be cleared with the Othala rune and by running the quill feather over it. Only he would be able to read the words on his own parchment likewise - to anyone else it would appear blank.
Standing up, Harry began to make his hasty retreat – before he suffered anymore of the angry healer’s wrath. It was true; he’d finally fallen asleep after tossing and turning in bed for ages – worried about a certain blond haired potions teacher, only to be woken up half an hour later by nightmares.
Draco's screaming last words had Harry's anger rising and his fists clenching, but before he could punch Draco ... the radio popped into existence. Both Draco and Harry muttered 'fuck' at the same time, before the golden light took over them both and the entire school.
“Yes! But if I just so happened to keep my eyes open a little wider, and I so happened to catch someone going against school rules myself…”
“Her portrait has protection charms and the like…” Harry went on when he could talk again. “…So, she didn’t get damaged. She was still attached to part of the wall though, and I had shocked her into total silence. I couldn’t believe she had nothing to say – just looked at me gaping. We managed to have her moved to the Black vaults – Kreacher was pissed, hated me for the entire year.”
He could say he was besotted with the Tau, but he wouldn’t dare ask to meet the man yet - he was scared his perfect illusion would shatter, it was to soon. At some point, they would have to meet. He couldn’t live his life on parchment, and what if Tau was as real as his words implied … he would miss out on something that could be wonderful - a physical relationship instead of a parchment one. Someone he could return to, share his bed with, hold hands and sit next to, and share his life with. Someone he could kiss, love, and maybe spend a life time with. If he clung to his parchment, whether or not Tau became the man for him, he would miss out on a very real relationship.
“What? I’m bloody starving!” Draco said. “I don’t starve myself like you seem content to do. I don’t skip meals!”
Ginny: "I love you Harry. After everything we've been through this year, I'm glad it's finally over. I'm glad we get to be together now, are you?"
-Monday 26th October - Charms class, Draco walks in and catches his eyes briefly before taking his seat.
Harry had taken lunch in his room, forgone dinner again in favour of grading more homework from the summer holidays, and was currently tidying up the table.
Harry slumped back into his chair and relaxed slightly. Could that be all it was for Draco, a simple curiosity? Or maybe he was trying to get information out of him regarding his condition, gain information that he could later use against him.
Draco’s true self, then he just had to accept everything that was Draco – the history between them, Draco’s past, Draco’s walls and insecurities, and… Oh Merlin! He had so much to figure out.
Draco’s rooms where different to his own; simple, less cluttered, more organised, and laid out differently with more space –
-Most of the lyrics in this story have been altered slightly from their original to fit in with this story. (Yes, I've used songs that already exist instead of creating my own.) Also some songs have been cut shorter. It is therefore advised that you read the lyrics in the story.
“You’re smiling.” Harry stated calmly, drinking his coffee once again. Draco’s smile vanished in an instant, but his eyes belied his lips.
It had taken Tau over an hour to write that very short message - unless of course, he had been busy – but Harry didn’t think so. No, Harry felt like Tau had been lost for words and didn’t know what to respond with. The fact Tau was asking about his ability to forgive Elliot, only strengthened his own feelings that this was a test.
Mathews looked deflated at that stipulation, but Harry continued to address the room. “Twelve inches, including the different ways it can be useful. I do not want a twelve-inch paper purely on the history of shields, nor do I want a twelve-inch
Draco jumped, realising that everyone who had yet to do so were now pulling their Christmas crackers.
“Okay.” Samuel sighed, hesitating just a few seconds longer. “It was Mr Monero … and Mr Cray too, I think.”
“Hey! I brought the clothes you asked for.” Harry said, placing the black trousers, boxers, white shirt, and black robes onto the bed with the equally black shoes and socks. Why Draco insisted in looking like he was attending an important meeting all the time baffled him.
“Well done! Yes. I would say, navy blue with a slight lean toward indigo. Maybe you should familiarise yourself with a more extensive range of colours, it will help you with your homework when you need to state the given colours of a potion at various stages of brewing.”
Draco: "Not anymore. Even Pansy and Blaise like Hermione, they are slowly warming up to Ron - not that he makes it easy."
When Mr Potter started to manipulate the snow that was being sent his way by Mr Malfoy, the students gawped in awe at the huge, massive snowball that had started to form above their defence against the Dark arts teacher’s head, growing bigger, and bigger, and bigger...
Draco hadn’t attended any meals in the Great Hall since before his illness, had barely left his private suite, and he’d been point-blank ignoring Harry. Harry had even noticed the lack of response from ‘Tau’. Draco-Tau, hadn’t written to him at all, and Harry hadn’t the foggiest understanding of why.
Draco: "I want ... me Harry. Garden ... trees ... Wind. I don't remember. Happy ... fun. Fun ... child ... Myself."
Tau once again took ages to reply, and that just seemed to confirmed Harry’s thoughts. He tried not to think about it too hard as he finished the last mouthful of milk.
As the students on Harry’s team were ready to clout Draco, Lilium, and Josephine in red snowballs, Draco was starting his own count down.
Harry poured out another glass of whisky – of liquid courage as he had dubbed it, and as he poured another one for Draco’s sake, he decided that in order to gain Draco’s trust and encourage him to open up, maybe he could be honest about the soul fragments Tom Riddle had stashed away. If nothing else, it might prove that he did in fact, understand enough.
-Thursday 4th - 3am. Making tea in Harry's room, after both young boys wake due to more images of death and abuse. Small tired smiles shared, and loving hugs.
As Draco drags Harry to the dance floor, the radio appears silently where the band are standing. It doesn't pop, but its magical still takes over.
The fact Tau seemed to hate Elliot’s treatment of his family, well… that spoke volumes of Tau’s own loyalty to family. So far, Harry hadn’t gotten the sense of Tau having anyone close to him. Tau always seemed to be alone, or at least, his writing portrayed it that way.
Tau seem to hold a very strong opinion that Elliot was at fault and didn’t deserve forgiveness. He blamed Elliot for his blind following of Azorren, even though Azorren was the one pulling the strings and manipulating him.
Draco: "Before you decided to vamoose because you have the emotional level of a twelve-year-old girl, I suggest we figure out the date and time, then we go and find the headmistress. Unless you would rather wait until the next time the radio appears. Perhaps I'll end up balls deep in your arse next time, and i'd rather not if it's all the same to you Potter."
As his eyes finally adapted to the morning rays that streamed through the window, golden and intrusive, he saw what he’d knocked off his bedside table a moment ago – the Le’Amortentia parchment and quill. Tau-Draco, had already sent him a message that morning:
? I’ll have you know that this is a thousand times better then it was.” Harry said, folding his arms.
They lean in closer, lips meet in an unsure kiss, and then ... a tsunami of emotions fuel their unspoken desires, everything speaking volumes without the need for words.
He then turned to face the man he had falling in love with. Curse or no curse, today had proved that it wasn't a lie. He really did love Draco Malfoy. He realised then that ... he couldn't be without him. He would persevere with Draco, be patient and understanding, and hope that one day ... Draco wouldn't feel the need to hide behind a wall and protect him-self with hostility and lies.
The door chimed three sickly-sweet tones, and Harry Potter's eyes roamed as he slowly entered Le'Amortentia, tapping a purple and silver voucher against his left hand nervously. Sucking his bottom lip, his eyes widened to better absorb his new surroundings. He wondered then, whether he still had time to change his mind and quickly make his exit?
“Each one of these colours, Miss Payne, were blue, yes? Yet, I can assure you that none of those would have been the correct colour for Murtlap essence. Can you now tell me what colour the Murtlap essence should be?”
Draco sighed in relief – for the fact that Harry would check on Miss Payne, and because Harry was no longer in his presence – and opened the door to return back into his classroom.
“Indeed she did, but there is time to open your gifts first… or are you embarrassed about your mediocre Christmas presents.” Draco smirked, purposely eyeing the green jumper Harry wore.
Draco just listened to Harry rambling, and it helped remind him that his dreams were either in the past or not real. When Harry went silent, Draco decided to share what he'd dreamed. He wanted to be with Harry, he had to trust him with things such as these.
serious about Padfoot. Draco was a Slytherin, he had done things that were unforgivable, but he was not a cheat! He would not betray Padfoot without giving the man a chance, without meeting him first at least. Besides, Harry was out of his reach – too good for a Malfoy. For all the words that Harry spoke, perhaps they were just kindness as per the duty of friendship, nothing more.
“I will pretend that I didn’t see the contents of that note.” Harry continued. “I was a student myself once, however, I hope that whatever you two are doing is safe for the both of you, and for the other students in this castle. If something were to happen while you two were alone, no one would be able to find you.”
