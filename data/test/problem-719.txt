into my ass.
“You’re a snarky, little bastard, Malfoy”, Harry growled between wet kisses.
"Try it again and when you've breathed in, you have to hold your breath. Then I'll relieve the pressure and widen the lungs again, okay?"
"Ha, he wouldn't even let you treat him if his life depended on you," the redhead growled angrily.
Draco loved the sound of his voice and the naughty words he muttered against his back. Harry's thrusts got faster and kept hitting the little bundle of nerves in Draco's ass. It felt so good!
Chatting and laughing we went down the small street to Hogsmeade. Harry’s cheerful laughter sounded loud in my ears and I had to grin. When he was happy, I was happy. Casually he slung his arm around my shoulders and kissed my head, pressing me against his warm body. The snow made little crunching sounds beneath our feet. It felt like Christmas.
Draco's heart beat almost out of his chest as he lifted Harry's blanket and moved closer. The smaller man lifted his head and his long black hair tickled Draco's naked arm as he slipped it between his neck and mattress. He felt Harry's big hand on his own ribs and moved his slender fingers onto Harry's back at the same time. Harry now lay a little lower than himself and placed his face against Draco's naked chest. He felt the soft hair of the black beard tickle his skin and hoped that his racing heart would not betray him.
I heard him muttering a charm, which cleaned and lubed me at the same time.
He roughly pulled down my pants. My hot cock sprang free and I gasped as it hit the cold air.
The blonde got serious again. "If anything is going on, you can always come to me, yeah? And now I really have to sleep, it's quite late."
When Draco was sure that Harry was finally asleep, he stroked his wet, curly hair one last time and then pulled his hand back. Gently he rose from his uncomfortable kneeling position in front of the bed. He went quietly to the door to make himself something to eat when he heard a soft noise.
His hands were all over my body, pressing and touching and
“Hi”, he said and his voice was like liquid honey. All the embarrassed awkwardness from a few hours ago was washed away and replaced with a confident white-teethed smile and a flirty look.
“How does it feel?”
Draco took a deep breath, then opened the button and zipper of the tight cloth pants with the golden stripes on the side, which was in the same royal blue as the top and cape of the uniform. He pulled on the soft fabric, gradually exposing trained bronze legs with curly dark hair. Draco simply could not prevent his fingers from touching the naked, warm skin and he shuddered at the touch. "Damn it, pull yourself together," he admonished himself, sharply sucking in the air as his gaze fell on the tight black shorts the next moment. What he saw there didn't seem to be very small, even when asleep. Fuck, Malfoy, what's the matter with you? He tore his gaze away, ignored the beginning tension in his groin and let Harry sink back onto the soft mattress and slide the blanket over him. The former Gryffindor sighed softly in his sleep and turned to his side. Draco growled inside as his prick twitched at the sound. Carefully the young healer took off Harry's now crooked glasses and laid them on the bedside table. With a long index finger he gently stroked the temple of the other. The Auror made another small sigh.
Draco buries his face in Harry’s chest. “I missed you so much”, he mumbles, happily inhaling the familiar smell. “Gosh, you’re so warm.”
Pansy rolled her eyes in the exact moment the last song ended with a guitar solo and a loud cheering applause from the crowd.
"When do you have to get up?" asked the black haired man and raised his gaze a little.
Harry lowered his gaze and nodded. Again a dizzy feeling went through his aching head and he quickly clung to Draco's broad shoulders.
," Draco exhaled as the two full lips, which could kiss so well, lay around his glans and moved over the shaft up and down faster and faster. Draco's heart was pounding while he could only hear his own blood rushing in his veins and his loud moaning in the quiet apartment.
Harry laughed quietly and sat closer cross-legged. He no longer wore a T-shirt, so Draco had an unobstructed view of tanned abdominal muscles as Harry tied up his black hair. Fuck, he looked damn good.
“What do you mean with ‘gone’”?, Ron asks.
," Draco screamed in mild panic.
"You-your... your skin..."
" What's the next step now?", Draco added.
"I know we only decided yesterday to be friends, but I would love to be
The grip of the tanned fingers increased around Draco's hips as Harry withdrew almost completely and then thrusted deep into him again.
He growled angrily. "Keep going!"
Draco was slightly ashamed to notice that he was still sitting on Potter's hip, pressing pelvis against pelvis and quickly climbing down.
Draco frowned and punched Harry’s arm. “Potter, I swear…!”, he snarled.
set up
The dark-haired man kneeled on the floor with a chalk-like face and hunched trembling. He had his arms wrapped around his belly and cold sweat shimmered on his forehead. Draco immediately noticed that Potter was wearing jeans and a T-shirt and not his auror uniform, so nothing could have happened to him in combat this time, could it? It had to be a violent colic or appendicitis...
“Come!” He took me by the hand and pulled me into a dark alley between two houses. He hastily threw some concealing charms around us, masking us from curious views.
," Harry asked in a soft voice.
“I can’t wait to marry you tomorrow.”
Draco took the bearded face in both hands and felt the cold sweat of fear.
Draco wiped his counter and grinned as he remembered the first time Harry came into his shop. Well “came” would certainly sound too harmless. “Burst in” would be the more appropriate expression. Harry had been on a raid in an antique shop some way down Diagon Alley that was reputed to deal with stolen valuables. As soon as the aurors had entered the shop, the owner had run away and Harry straight after him. Both of them ended crashing through Draco’s front door, smashing the glass and toppling over the nearest table. Harry had arrested the owner, despite a huge gash in his cheek and shoulder and maybe that was the moment that Draco had fallen for him. Again, as Pansy might say. Well, anyhow…
Harry just smiled, snaking his arms around Draco’s slender waist and pulled his boyfriend closer to him, while avoiding bumping his nose into the other man’s chest. “I know, baby. But it still hurts
Draco swallowed and whispered: "At 8am, but don't worry about me".
The door to Ron’s room was ajar and Harry burst into the room. There was no one there. The room was as messy as always and his flatmate was nowhere to be seen.
He stroked his smooth chest, his flat stomach with its many fine scars until his fingers touched the arch of his now semi-erected dick. Pictures of Potter, no Harry, appeared before his inner eye. The tanned skin, the trained upper body, the flexing muscles under this dragon tattoo and what was showing through his shorts. Draco gasped slightly as he felt that he was now getting really hard. His fingers glided briefly over the shiny glans and then pulled his hand away.
So the little healer babbled non-stop until they arrived in the locker room. There she shoved a pile of robes into his hand.
"So, Anthony, your new colleague, Draco Malfoy!"
Thinking about the fiery girl, Draco shook his head and snorted. “No, not really.”
Harry had been looking forward to replanting the balcony, but now he didn't like to dig in the ground bent over all the time. Again and again he had to snuffle and stretch his aching back. He did the cleaning mechanically and without any frills. Again he swayed slightly and had to hold on to the kitchen unit, but blamed the dizziness on the fumes of the cleaning agents. Yes, the boy who lived twice was a stubborn one.
upstairs. He was struck by an unknown curse that caused seizures and panic attacks," he told her in a matter-of-fact tone. "Do you have a room for him?"
“By the way, who was that?”
Ron’s eyes were wide as galleons as he looked back and forth between a laughing Harry, who rubbed his stubbly chin and my exciting, pink-cheeked face. “What the fuck did you tell him?!”, he asked in sheer surprise.
Arriving at the station, of all people, he ran into Katherine, the obtrusive witch of his class. She had apparently ended up on this ward after her training. Smiling and swaying her red-brown hair, she walked towards him. The young man had to make every effort not to roll his eyes.
“Yes, what?”, Draco asked grinning and normally Harry would have spanked him for that cheekiness, but he felt desperate for that feeling again. “Yes, pleaaaaaaaase”, the word drawing into a moan when Draco firmly pressed against his prostate again.
Draco writhes and shakes, just half a second away from a breath-taking orgasm. With his pure willpower he forces himself not to come, not to yield the temptation of endless relief.
“If you don’t fuck me now, I will just come on your fingers and faint”, I snarled.
"What, but -" his young colleague stammered.
"So somebody wanted to kill him?," asked his colleague, shocked.
Draco sniffed at the bottle and immediately had a bad suspicion. It really smelled like cherry juice, that was obvious, but there was another note to be detected. And that was, by Merlin, anything but harmless. Draco turned on the heel and ran off.
Harry pressed Draco back against the brick wall. They just happened to be back in London for a few days, since they lived together in Paris for 7 years by now, and just as luck would have it, they were even in Shoreditch that night. They have visited the restaurant of a friend to have a nice dinner, some wine and a couple of whiskeys and were about to walk back to their hotel, when they passed a small pub. “Black Lion” was written in large letters above the door. The place where it all began. Draco had simply grinned and pulled Harry by the hand in a dark alley just behind the pub.
“Ronald Weasley, I’m not going to explain to you the concept of being gone! He just ran away, this utter twat!” Pansy all but screams into her phone.
“I can’t hold it any longer, baby… Fuck, you’re so hot… I – ughn gods, I’m close!”
That damn stubborn voice in the back of his head, wondering why he was reacting so violently, the blonde just tried to blend out. Potter just knew how to push his buttons, how to get his old rival on the the edge of a tantrum. So he hadn't changed. Draco felt something like regret flooding his stomach and immediately decided to drink a glass of wine even though it was only 4 pm.
He set it on a low level and glided over his bulging balls and gasped excitedly as he let the vibrator's tip glide over his glans. A few drops of white already poured out and Draco threw his head back as he grabbed his hard shaft with the other hand and pumped briefly. The vibrator now slipped through his pale cheeks and Draco turned on his stomach with his legs wide apart to ease access.
The trembling became more and more violent. Now he grabbed his head with a moan, pressing his palms against his forehead and throwing his head back. His whole body began to twitch and he rolled his eyes upwards.
He felt Harry’s fingers, coated in his own saliva, pressing in his loosened hole.
"Or do you think you can't do it?" Anthony shot back smugly and with a nasty grin on his face.
When Draco woke up, he couldn't move. His half-sleeping brain tried hard to figure out what had happened? Why did he feel so heavy and warm? A moment later he noticed that there seemed to be something half on top of him burying his right side. Blinking he opened his eyes and looked down at a sea of long black curls. The memories of last night stormed onto Draco like a tornado. They had kissed! He and Harry Potter had kissed! And it had been, by Merlin, so wonderful. Now the boy who survived was lying in his arms, his head on his shoulder and his right arm and right leg wrapped around Draco. The blonde man's heart began to beat quickly again. And it almost tripped over when he took a look at the alarm clock on his bedside table: 8:45am. He had to be at work in fifteen minutes!
Harry had to stop in his tracks to regain his wits. Then he remembered: Ron wasn’t with him last night. He was out with Lukas and Nils, two German guys whom he met on vacation last year and who happened to be in London for a few days. They had texted him and asked if he wanted to hang out. And boy, could those Germans drink… For every shot that he, Harry, downed, they took two. At some point they must have split up. Harry could vaguely remember staggering home alone in the gentle twilight of a new morning. And Ron? Right, Ron had spent the night at Hermione’s, this cute, but nerdy girl he currently dated.
Harry made a vague movement with his hand and somehow Draco understood what he meant.
Harry’s mouth is on his slender neck, licking and sucking and biting the soft skin there. “I’m gonna reward you, love. You’ve been so good. You deserve it. You deserve everything in the world.”
“Oh, Madame Rosmerta is selling mulled wine and mead in front of her pub! Do you guys want some?”, Theo asked.
I felt so fucking full, so stretched and so full. Harry’s hands stroked my sweat-covered back and my eyes rolled back in my head, as he started to thrust in me with deep, long strokes.
“That’s beautiful!”, Neville said in awe, when we entered the small village.
“Who was what?”, Seamus asked back while arranging his drum set.
With a firm grip, Harry held Draco’s jaw, pushing two fingers between Draco’s plump lips.
“Don’t hide yourself, my sweet boy. Let me see you.”
The unpleasant feeling in his stomach from apparating increases even more as Draco opens his eyes and sees the graveyard. Quickly he lowers his gaze and steps on, past old headstones and high spruces.
"Draco," Harry murmured.
If his sweet boy only knew, that Harry clearly hadn’t planned on sleeping early this night.
Harry put an arm around Draco’s slender shoulders and pressed a kiss in the crook of his neck but flinched when his nose still protested. Right. He nearly forgot in his post-orgasmic bliss.
to come
Soon they both stood in the spacious shower cubicle with shaky legs and let warm water run over their bodies. Draco enjoyed the closeness of the other. He ran his hands through Harry's thick hair and pressed a gentle kiss on his mouth. The Auror sighed softly and moved his lips against the Draco's. Tenderly caressing hands stroked over Draco's body, caressing the places they had touched so hard before. A pleasant shiver ran down his back.
“Hrchm.”
Draco obeyed, pressing his bare chest against the chilly stone, whimpering when it scratched over his hard nipples.
The next morning Draco woke up with a huge boner. The last remains of his dream were just rushing through his slender body. Draco could dimly remember strong brown hands and long black hair. He moaned slightly as he stretched out extensively and noticed goose bumps running down his back. What was wrong with him? He hadn't been as horny as yesterday and today for a long time! That couldn't have anything to do with a certain guy with a lightning scar, could it? Again Draco's thoughts wandered to the muscular brown chest and the flashing green eyes and his hand crept to his rock-hard arousal. Hadn't the jerking yesterday satisfied him enough? Why did he have to fantasize about Potter again? Well then maybe today in a different way. Determined the young healer turned around and reached into the small drawer of his bedside table. He snatched out the expensive lubricant and the slim, black, slightly curved vibrator. His cock twitched again in light anticipation of the extremely pleasant feeling that it would give him in a minute. He turned back to the other side and moistened his right hand fingers with the cool gel. He sighed as he circled a finger over his rim and penetrated gently. The blonde bent his back a little to push his hand lower into the velvety heat. His pale chest raised and lowered quickly as he added a second finger and also pushed it into his tight hole. A satisfied groan left his slightly open lips as he hit his prostate and felt everything clenching around him. Faster and faster Draco fingered his wet entrance, stroking his prostate with each thrust. His moaning became more hectic and he had to control himself not coming right away. He pulled his fingers out of his now widened hole and lubricated the vibrator with some gel.
my soft skin. I hummed into the mattress.
Draco had poured them both a glass of white wine and now stood with his back to the table at the stove and continued cooking. He felt a tingling sensation in his neck, felt Harry's gaze resting on him.
"Hey, Harry! It's all right, stay calm," the blonde tried to persuade him.
The black haired man raised an eyebrow and his left corner of his mouth raised. Was Draco mistaken or did the other man let his gaze wander over his upper body just as he did over him? But Harry's light smile suddenly collapsed.
Draco had to smile when he heard how happy and rested Harry sounded.
So, Harry was gay. No big deal, wasn’t it? Only that he was the most beautiful man, Draco had seen in a long time. And he was talented and kind and funny. But besides that?
"My head...I don't want that! Please stop..." the Auror groaned and closed his eyes in agony.
I quickly scrambled to get up and pushed my butt in the air, my hard cock now dangled heavy and red between my legs.
"So I read your message. I stayed a little bit longer and made myself some tea afterwards. Then I briefly went home and showered and changed. And since I didn't know where to go or what to do anyway, I came back here. But I was still so exhausted that I went to bed again. I don't know why, but I didn't even wake up once in your bed, it was really great!"
Finally the broad grin made its way to the pale face.
After I found my friends and told them about our plans, I wanted to get dressed and moved to my room. Our room. The place that brought us together, actually. When we came back to our 8
They all started their work. Draco checking and refilling the bar and the band setting up their stage. Draco soon started sweating carrying beer crates and bottles of booze in his tight jeans. He felt his face redden with the effort and swiped the back of his hand over his sweat covered forehead. All the while he heard the band arrange the stage, test their instruments and mics and try out the lights of the pub.
Harry leaned forward as he felt Draco’s slender hands on his back, pulling him closer. Their noses touched and Harry felt that pair of familiar and incredibly soft lips on his own. Skin on skin their mouths moved together, their tongues tenderly intertwined in an intimate dance. Nothing like Draco’s giddily frisk before, more like a slow and innocent smoochy dance by two teenagers.
The blonde felt his cheeks blush and smiled slightly.
Finally the smaller one gave in and nodded briefly just to make a face right on it when the pain shot through his head.
"The wine is good," the Auror finally broke the silence. "I'd rather drink beer, but it's really delicious."
"Save your breath, Malfoy," Potter hissed back.
for?”, he muttered under his breath.
"Merlin, Malfoy... You are so hot. Your tight wet hole feels so good. So good for me," growled Harry with clenched teeth.
Draco himself was not sent to Azkaban either. Again Harry Potter made a decisive contribution. A contribution so decisive that it made Draco dizzy when he thought of it. Instead of Azkaban, he had been sent to St. Mungo to serve the magical community. And indeed, after a few weeks of emptying bedpans and cleaning operating theatres, a master healer recognized Draco's enormous potential and allowed him to start a proper apprenticeship after the year of community service if he wanted to. And Draco wanted! Finally he would be able to show the world who he really was and what he could do!
Draco quickly disappeared into the bathroom and digged a little in his cupboard with the remedies. Triumphantly he pulled a small bottle with light blue contents from a corner and hurried back to Harry, who had started to tremble despite his hot head.
Draco’s mouth was hot and wet, and he quickly began to bop his head up and down, taking the big cock up to the back of his throat every time. Harry’s fingers raked in the white-blonde strands and tightened there, holding Draco in place. His eyes flew open as he felt Draco gently massaging and tugging at his swollen balls and he growled at the delicious sight in front of him. Draco’s naked, slender back was bent, showing of his firm little butt in his tight jeans. His right hand held the base of Harry’s cock, moving in time with his head, the left hand pressed now firmly against his balls and his sensitive perineum. And Draco’s face – gosh – his face… Harry moaned low in his throat, feeling lust and endorphins rushing through his body, when he looked down. Tears spilled from Draco’s glinting grey eyes as he choked again and again on Harry’s twitching dick and some drool drippled out of the corner of his mouth, which was stretched so wide around the girth.
I felt my cheeks get red “Oh, shut up”, I mumbled, when we broke apart.
!”, he said, trying to look like it.
"Everything okay?" Harry asked with a strained, worried voice and spreaded little kisses on Draco's bony spine. His big hands gently stroked the pale skin and soothed the blonde that he soon demanded more.
"Don't flatter yourself. You were just damn hard and big," Draco grumbled.
had been Harry's only salvation. Draco pushed this strange tingling, which now spread to his stomach, aside. Surely he had not eaten enough again.
“But daddy, you would make me feel so hot and good…”, I moaned in his ear.
year, it was horrible at first. I was broken after the war. And so was Harry. But together we somehow managed to pick up the pieces and assemble them. We became friends along the way. And then about 3 weeks ago, the sexual tension between us (that might have actually started about
When the young healer fetched a coffee in the lounge on Friday afternoon in a quiet moment and allowed himself two minutes of peace, he heard the loud laughter of the reception witch from the reception area.
"Malfoy..." Potter whispered quietly and pressed his hands on his still aching stomach. "What happened?
“You’re still so tight, baby”, Harry growled in Draco’s ear, licking the shell.
The blonde propped himself up on his elbows and raised one neatly plucked eyebrow. “You let me?”
Smirking an evil smile, he looked Draco in in eyes. “I accept your apology, baby.” Draco sighed in relief. “But –“. Draco looked at him with big grey eyes. “But I think you still deserve a little punishment for punching your daddy on the nose, right, baby?”
Slowly he gets up and moves through the hall. His hand already lifted, he takes a deep breath before knocking gently against his guest bedroom’s door. As he hears no answer, he slowly opens the door, pokes his head inside – and stops dead in his tracks.
“Draco, get your shit together!”, she hissed in his ear. “It’s nearly painful to watch. You are
you in fact?” His eyes were big as galleons.
Draco sighed heavily. “If you guys promise me to behave, leave nobody in and don’t plunder the booze rack, then I will leave you alone for a minute to head home to freshen up.”
Harry stood now right in front of the counter. Slightly sweating he rubbed the back of his hand over his forehead and smirked. This fucking smirk.
"And do you know what hit him? I'm – uh, I’m just curious because, frankly, we were a little bit confused!"
With every step we took, the hard, unyielding stick pressed against my balls and prostate in just the right amount of pleasure and pain. I constantly bit my lip, to restrain me from moaning. Harry’s hand in my mine was warm and calm and the only thing that kept me from losing my mind! I wanted to come
Harry closed his eyes and nodded. “Yes…”
With a roll of his eyes Draco stepped aside and allowed his unannounced visit in.
A strange mixture of disappointment, sadness and shame gathered in Draco. What had he done? He had scared him off. For Draco it had felt so... so right last night... so right and real like nothing in his life for a long time. But apparently not for Harry.
I was almost asleep anyway. And so exhausted, that I just could nod.
“Shh, baby boy. Stay with me. Don’t come, baby. It’s okay. You can come soon, I promise.”
Ron came to his help and saved him from his embarrassing stare. “Yeah, we were just about to have beer out in the sun.”
Stumbling and swearing Harry jumped out of his bed and rushed into the hallway of the small apartment.
Draco greeted them with a cursory wave and rummaged for the bar’s key. “Sorry for being a bit late, I had a course.”
!” Harry’s eyes flew open and his head snapped up. He felt an electric spark revibrating in his core and knew that Draco’s long fingers had found it. The spot that always felt so swollen and soft under Harry’s fingers. The spot, that he knew how to hit, when moving his hips in the right angle. The spot, that made his boyfriend come without even touching his cock.
“What?!”
Harry took his hands down to slap his lover’s arm. “Stop laughing! It was terrible!”, Harry growled.
In the meantime he also knew a bit more about his colleague. Anthony was 31 years old and had attended a school in Canada. After graduating, he moved to Great Britain, where his mother's family originally came from to study healing. Now he had been at St. Mungo for almost 11 years and had of course witnessed Voldemort's rise and fall and the war very closely here in Great Britain. Also he was not unaware of the role the name Malfoy had played in the whole spectacle. Even though Draco didn't talk much about himself, he felt that he had convinced Anthony with his abilities and his polite manner that there was more in him than the former Death Eater and the son of a convicted criminal. They actually got along quite well. Anthony had a somewhat rude sense of humor that Draco didn't always like (and unfortunately settled with nickname "Blondie"), but he was a good healer and a patient teacher. Maybe they wouldn't become friends for life, but it was an advantage to be in a team with this energetic man. He complemented Draco's sensitivity and precision well.
“Oh, shut it…”, Harry grumbled, but he was tempted. The guy, Draco, looked just too
Draco sighed. “Fine”, he said, like it would be his enormous mercy to drop the subject. He leaned back in his chair, long legs crossed gracefully. He inclined his head to take another sip, eyes still at Harry, full of faked innocence. “Or are you just afraid…”
“Potter, for fucks sake! Would you suck or fuck me already? Preferably both!”, Draco whined, a desperate sound leaving his throat.
“I’ve never seen you so flustered, sweetheart…” The fucking smirk was back. Wasn’t this boy ashamed of anything?! “I bet you like it…”
by his first name?!
“You look so hot Draco…” He spread my cheeks now with both hands, clearly staring at my pink hole. “Fuck, your ass looks so delicious…”
"St. Mungo" was the quiet answer.
"No, the first time was in St. Mungo when you got me out of a panic attack."
"Just watch out, otherwise I'll regret it," Draco warned and smiled back.
“Hmm, yeah”, Harry grumbled. It hasn’t been the most pleasant days in school for him. He actually only wanted to tell Ron and Hermione, but apparently Lavender had overheard them and so, only a couple of hours later, the whole school seemed to know.
"Well, I'm gonna take a little break and be back in 15 minutes."
“Hmm, but…”
“Fuck it, I have to call Ron.”
Draco sighed just a tiny bit. “Okay, daddy.”
“Draco, love… What I do, gives me a bloody good feeling as well!”
And now they stood there, snogging and rubbing against each other like randy teenagers, visible to anyone who would come out of the pub’s back door.
“I am.”
“Do I have to remind you, that
Well, at least it seemed to have helped.
“You wouldn’t believe!”
“Hey, Ron? Ron was it, right?”
A hard slap had me jerk forward and my forehead was now pressed into the pillow.
The boys and I moved down the narrow road towards the pub. Then I noticed, that Harry wasn’t next to me. “Harry?” I turned around. “Harry?!”
Hermione appears in the doorframe of their bedroom, a worried look on her face.
"Well, um... I didn't
Draco nodded to the bottle on the table next to him and cleaned his robes of Potter's sweat and vomit with a flick of his wand. Anthony took the bottle and sniffed it.
Draco was just about to answer, that this didn’t mean that he
Harry’s cock twitched in Draco’s hand and the blond got the hint. He started to jerk his hand again, this time also wrapping his lips around the hard hot flesh.
"Oh, you've had a hard time with that now”, Draco teased.
Suddenly Potter started shouting something in a hoarse voice. What was that? Draco couldn't understand a word.
"Oh shit... Yes, come in."
Draco tried to recapture his briefly slipped facial features and cleared his throat. "Yes, of course... thank you, Sir."
He only got an annoyed groan in response. Phew, lucky again.
"Listen, Anthony..." he started and bent forward a little.
Draco felt his ears getting hot and hurried to hide his face under the counter to rummage for a bottle of coke.
Harry had crossed his legs and put his elbow on the armrest. Tiredly, he had supported his head on his hand. One could clearly see that he hadn't slept much the last few nights.
His colleagues nodded and got to work. Draco grabbed the bottle and hurried to the lab in the back of the ER. Skillfully, he examined the red liquid and quickly realized that he was absolutely right. After all, potions and poisonings were his passion! At the small but well-equipped brewing table in the corner he quickly made a suitable counter potion and was proud of himself. He, the young healer, had known it before anyone else! He had saved Harry Potter!
… displayed, very well.
“Don’t worry”, one of the guys, Seamus, answered with a strong Irish accent. “We’re missing a member anyway.”
“Okay, calm down!” She hears another grunt. “Does Harry know?”
“More, daddy, please! I need you so bad”, I whined and Harry
He felt that his cheeks were a little flushed when he thought about the intimate details he was talking about, but whatever. If anyone could understand, it was Harry.
“The tall muscular guy, with the tats and the cute spectacles.”
"Harry, I'm home," he shouted into the apartment.
Harry looked Draco in the eye and nodded. "You've been through a lot, too." His voice was quiet and rough.
With half-opened eyes Draco looked down. What he saw was absolutely divine. Harry Potter kneeled in front of him with dishevelled hair and naked torso, looking at his bobbing member with outrageous enthusiasm.
“You and I. Cottage. Now!”, he growled in the blonde’s ear.
“Do you know what you get, when you get your daddy hard in public?”
“Are you all the way in?”
Despite the dim light he could see Harry's cheeks turning red and a smile curling on his lips.
The voice of the healer only reached his mind slowly. By then she had already guided him to a room, misinterpreting his continuous nodding from before.
"I told level 3 that we were going to take him straight to her ward. They'll take care of his poisoning."
Harry’s voice had been low and a tiny bit sad and his hug was so warm and comfy, and Draco had known that nothing in this world could harm him, as long as he has the love of his life with him. But Harry is gone now, and Draco has nightmares and feels miserable and he just wants – no, he
But... Let's see what's next :D
Well… Once he took a breath, he knocked short and hard and entered.
“That’s what you’re going to wear?”, I asked incredulous.
Draco's heart again made a small hop out of time and he quickly covered his red cheeks with a scornful grin. "That's just the alcohol talking, Potter! Don't get used to it!"
The blonde simply ignored this comment. "Do you want to take a shower?"
Harry pressed a wet kiss against my left ass cheek. “When we come home, you’ll have to be nice and loose and ready for your daddy’s hard cock. Okay, baby?”
"I don't," Draco mumbled into his black hair. "I don't know how many times at night I've wished someone was there to comfort me."
“Actually wanked me raw that night…”, Draco muttered under his breath. “Oh, don’t give me that look, Potter”, he added, glaring at Harry’s surprised and amused face. “It was just a
Draco nodded and caressingly let his fingers glide over Harry’s scalp. The young man closed his eyes. “And I found porn.” Draco’s hand stilled. He could literally see him smirk even with his eyes closed. Harry had introduced Draco to the internet about a year ago. To
The blonde stared into the other' s bright green eyes and frowned slightly.
But nevertheless, they were a bit sceptical when they heard, that the new owner would be Draco Malfoy,
"That is, he is... he is..."
With a quiet groan Harry straightened up. Little black dots danced promptly in front of his eyes and he swayed slightly while sitting. Oh no. He had certainly only moved too fast. With a deep breath he tried to calm down, which immediately triggered a violent coughing attack.
Together they stumbled into the bedroom. The sun fell through the left side window and casted a rectangle full of warm light right onto their bed.
Draco on him. His fingers, his lips, his tongue made his stomach tingle with lust. Draco had one hand in his cock, slowly massaging the hard flesh and his other hand caressed his balls. Harry hummed as Draco licked his cock, slightly sucking on the head and only flinched a bit, when his lover’s hand moved, and warm fingers brushed his hole.
“Please, daddy! Oh, please, fuck me! I can’t take it anymore!”
Harry sat up and Draco’s hands flopped loosely by his side on the mattress.
"Fuck, he's having a seizure," Anthony remarked.
Actually, she was right. It was really silly and only unnecessarily kept up the enmities of school time.
Harry kisses his way over Draco’s sharp jawline to his neck, sucking slightly on the creamy-white skin, careful not to make any marks, which Draco appreciates. He loves being marked by Harry, but he would prefer not to have any hickeys on his wedding photos.
"Oh, it smells good here, though," the black-haired man remarked.
The rest of the night, well, didn’t went
"But I... so it was actually... for me at least..."
"But you had a long day," Harry tried to protest again. His snuffed voice broke.
He heard a choking and immediately saw the dark red, foamy vomit on the couch and on Potter's upper body. And then Draco knew what it was. His three colleagues were just trying to give the screaming and groaning auror venous access for a cramp-relieving and pain-relieving potion, but the black haired man trembled so terribly that they had trouble keeping his arm straight.
"Try and take a deep breath."
Harry felt Draco slightly staggering next to him because of the sudden apparition. He grabbed him by the shoulders to steady him, eyes fixed on Draco’s beautiful face, his wind-swept hair falling in his eyes. He pressed him against the front door and kissed him hard. His tongue dove into Draco’s mouth and he could taste the coffee as his boyfriend sank his hands into his raven curls.
"Well, great," Anthony called. "So he does understand us. And apparently the confusion is slowly diminishing if he still knows where he is."
"Change quickly, you can take the empty locker down there on the right. Then come out and I'll take you to Mr. Young, who'll take care of everything else."
But Draco wouldn’t complain. He loved his job! He was practically selling happiness! In terms of money there was absolutely no need for him to have an own shop or even work at all. But in terms of his mental well-being? Yeah, absolutely! He loved to have his own business, to be his own boss (for the first time in his life) and to do something he had a passion about. In school he would have never thought that his excellent skills in potions would come in handy in that way. But combined with his exquisite taste for good food, it made him create dozens of new types of ice cream. And that made him get a reputation quite quickly!
“Oh my god, what happened?!”, Draco blurted and scrambled forward to the place where Harry sat on the blue carpet.
She turns around in Hermione’s arms and pulls her wife into a soft good-morning-kiss.
Slowly and on his bare feet, Draco moves into the hallway, snatches his shoes and leaves the apartment. His wand is safely hidden in the big front pocket of Harry’s old worn sweater and Draco pulls the hood over his head to be even closer to the familiar smell. The early summer night is brisk, and the fresh air feels soothing on his hot cheeks and red eyes. After he has put enough distance between him and the cosy houses of the neighbourhood, Draco takes a deep breath to concentrate, thinks about the place, he wants to go and turns on his spot.
Only now had he noticed the brunette young witch in the blue blouse standing by the nurse wringing her hands. A blurred image of a small fist dashing towards his nose suddenly came to Draco's mind. He shook his head. While his three colleagues were taking care of Potter, he quickly turned to Hermine Granger.
"Shh, you don't have to cry." In a soft voice Draco talked to Harry and with his thumbs he wiped away the wet marks on his cheeks. Compassion flooded his stomach and he felt a small sting in his heart. "It's all over."
Together we strolled through the decorated streets, stopping here and there to buy a few last-minute-gifts for our friends and some snacks for us. The wind grew colder every minute and my feet started freezing like hell. I looked up at Harry, still clad in his leather jacket (which he looked freaking hot in). He simply showed no sign of discomfort or cold whatsoever, that git. Me, on the other hand, really wanted to go home by now. Slip into my warm bed, Harry wrapped around me and his dick preferably in my ass. So, I started to whine.
They both moan as Harry pulls his cock out and waves his hand for a wandless cleaning charm. He shifts the both of them, so that they face each other, legs and arms entangled. His strong hands are on Draco’s cheeks, wiping away the tears that escapes his grey eyes.
He nodded. He couldn't say anything, his brain was paralyzed, his hands still stuck to Harry's back and his heart was thumping like mad.
“Could we maybe not talk about the virginity of my
Harry hummed contentedly and nodded. With one hand he opened his own pants and pulled them down together with his boxer shorts. And as Draco had already suspected, his erection was huge! The other hand fumbled for the wand and he casted a little spell. Draco immediately spread his legs a little more as he felt slippery silky fingers searching the way back. He wanted more, he wanted everything!
And yet his cock strained so hard between his legs that he could no longer ignore it. Again he grabbed his bobbing erection and moaned softly as he took it in his hand and slowly began to stroke it up and down.
“I already told you, I was
"Keep going! Yes! Yes!
The black haired man uttered a panic whimper and stared at the wand in Anthony's hand with his eyes widened in horror.
"Thank you for taking me in tonight." Draco heard that the deep voice was a little sluggish. "I really needed a little distraction."
With long steps he was on the fourth floor. God knows he had no intention of staying long. He spoke to the first healer he met in the hallway. Draco knew her only by sight. She smiled slightly when she heard who he was asking about.
"Draco, how nice to see you," she was already fluteing at a volume that was completely inappropriate at night in a hospital ward.
White spots appear in Draco’s vision. Everything is hot and tight and full and oh, so good! All he feels is Harry, Harry, Harry…
Draco wiped sadly over the wet corners of his eyes and went into the bedroom to undress. Now he urgently needed a hot shower. Carelessly he walked past the unmade bed and pulled his shirt over his head. With a rustling sound he threw it into the laundry basket.
Harry advanced until he had Malfoy against the opposite wall. He waited until Malfoy had swallowed, Adam’s apple bopping, to bite out, 'I want you to respect my friends. Hermione’s worth fifty of you! You should be thanking her for even speaking to you!'
Just to see Malfoy’s reaction, Harry adds, ‘I want you to come in my mouth.’
Harry pants, unable to stop himself now, despite alarms blaring in a corner of his brain. All he can see behind his closed eyelids is Draco humbled, tamed,
Albus frowned, floundered. ‘But...I’d never –’
‘Are you – What’s wrong with you?’ Malfoy’s eyes flicker over Harry’s face.
?) working on, but he wracks his confused brain anyway, trying to find the words that’ll satisfy Malfoy’s need for humiliation. In the end, he can just come up with, ‘Everything.’
‘...That’s why I’m obsessed.’
Harry isn’t even aroused. He’s just...unfulfilled.
‘My son tells me you’re good friends...’
Harry kicked at him. 'Not a good Death Eater doesn’t mean not a bigoted, arrogant little twat!'
Albus's first meeting with Mrs. Malfoy went much better.
want to fuck me. You’re fascinated. Enraptured. Enthralled. And
Harry snorts. ‘Or what? You’ll close the door in my face? You’d never.’
. Breathless. Emotionally perched on a cliff edge. Whimpering quietly.
Harry thinks about what might have happened had McGonagall not been there. He is sure he’d have managed to get through to Draco, make him avert his eyes or look down, make him finally,
Even in the privacy of his own bed, the memory brings the smile onto Harry’s face again. His hand speeds up on his cock while his hips are lifting themselves up off the bed, grinding in tiny circles.
‘Potter,’ Malfoy’s voice drops while an unholy glint comes into his eyes. A glint that makes Harry lick his lips again. ‘Potter, just what have you
He’s using an almost offensively casual voice, but of course Harry knows Malfoy is mocking him. Harry just can’t fucking stop. He probably wouldn’t even be able to stop if Malfoy Stupefied him – and that’s not too unlikely, even if he’s certain Malfoy would never kill him.
. ‘Ah, Malfoy, I’d say it’s good to see you again, but I have a scar on my hand that tells me not to lie.’
Malfoy’s grip on his shoulders wavers. Encouraged by this, Harry continues, ‘I thought it was because you’re up to something, but...I’ve never acted like this with anyone else I thought was doing something evil.’
with this or use it for whatever scheme he’s (
'I don’t have to answer to you, Great Saviour or not! Piss off, Potter! Stick your nose-who-lived up someone else’s arsehole!'
‘Yeah, best friends,’ Albus answered, trying to communicate
A corner of Malfoy’s mouth curled up as though he was sharing a joke with himself. Albus had exchanged five words with the man and already felt wrong-footed. He crossed his arms.
. What a fascinating proposition. And then do what, hm? What is it you want to do, Potter?’
‘Sorry,’ Harry mumbles.
Malfoy rolls his eyes ostentatiously, though he's smiling all the while. ‘You’re lucky it was Exsu and not poison or a love potion. Fuck me, the bitch actually thought she could unlock repressed feelings of some kind for her in you. If only –’ He leans closer. ‘– the poor darling knew. What you’ve really repressed.’
Harry’s bed curtains are closed and tinge the space inside dark red. Outside, Dean and Seamus are taking the piss out of Neville, and dark shapes are moving. Sighing, Harry grabs his wand and casts all necessary privacy charms, making all outside sounds fall away. Harry’s breathing seems to be louder in the ensuing silence.
‘That’s why you’re obsessed,’ Malfoy says encouragingly.
Malfoy took a few steps backward, and Harry followed, wand trained on him. Malfoy pulled an uneasy sneer and asked, 'What the hell is your problem, Potter? Not enough people beg for an autograph today? Brave new world bore you?'
God, being alive feels so good.
Malfoy looked away, already seeming bored with the conversation. Albus could barely deal with the realisation that he’d just, out of the blue, been vaguely threatened over a friendship. Scorpius had, of course, said negative and positive things about his father, but at that moment Albus had a hard time remembering or believing the positive ones. He also knew that Malfoy wasn’t a Death Eater anymore, had barely ever been, that Dad and most of his Auror friends thought Malfoy was just an attention-seeking arse for the most part. Despite all of that, the man intimidated him a bit.
. His grip on himself is weakening and growing again in an uncontrollable rhythm. ‘Secretary. She’s nice. Or not, I suppose. I thought she was nice. Known her for a while.’
Harry wants to answer, but Malfoy pats his arm in mock-comfort and he loses his train of thought and just stares at Malfoy. There’s a torch floating in every corner of the entrance hall, and the orange light makes Malfoy’s white-blond hair shine golden. Harry wants nothing more than to memorise everything he can about him, but every new detail he notices just overwhelms him more.
, listen to Harry, make him mumble in acquiescence. And then, and then Harry could have demanded he show his regret by apologizing to Hermione, first her and then everyone, with begging grey eyes, made genuine at last, or maybe by kneeling, in the Great Hall by Harry’s seat, or by stripping down to his underwear and –
He grits his teeth.
Harry knows Malfoy’s just going to run to the
Malfoy throws his head back when Harry starts wanking him off, his Adam’s apple shining with sweat. His voice is breathless when he answers, ‘Fuck off.’
‘Let me rephrase,’ Malfoy drawls, eyes glittering with excitement. ‘You don’t
why you’re, as you so beautifully put it,
Harry isn’t normally...like
‘Fucking hell, Potter,’ Malfoy chokes out, and Harry readjusts his idea of how much Draco Malfoy wants him once again. Because surely nobody else would look as if they’re losing their mind from Harry’s first attempt at a blow job. But there Malfoy is, wheezing, hands scrabbling at the wall.
Albus assumed was barely concealed hatred. ‘A scar, you say? How impressive. I also have a cool scar! It’s on my chest. I got it in Sixth Year.’
Harry is distracted from the thought by his own body. Lust is slowly sinking its way into his legs, making his toes curl.
Harry wracks his overwhelmed brain. ‘Adora gave me a box of sugar mice.’
‘Since when, Malfoy?’
‘Again.’ Malfoy sounds very pleased.
That is when McGonagall noticed Harry's wand and Malfoy's stance against the wall and interrupted.
Harry exhales sharply. Even as he wonders how he’s going to explain the change in his relationship with Draco Malfoy to Ron and Hermione, and even as warning bells ring in his mind telling him the whole thing is a horrible idea, he says, ‘Right, okay, yeah. Yeah. I’ll just...come around eight, then?’
With a clearer head, Harry can see the goose bumps break out on Malfoy’s skin. ‘Always knew you were a wanker.’
Nobody would call Astoria Malfoy
He can still feel the phantom sensation of Malfoy shaking against him.
Malfoy just continues in that overly polite tone. ‘Well, why do you need to be where I am?’
‘Er, yeah. I’d never –’
And Albus suspected that even if he weren’t hated by 70% of the Wizarding population, even if he had everything he could possibly want, all the power in the world, Draco Malfoy would still be struggling with an internal hunger for more.
With every single word that came out of his mouth – every rumour about the Minister and his secretary, every insulting remark about the host’s outfit, every brag about the price he’d paid for the newest artefact in his collection, every too biting joke about Headmistress McGonagall’s possibly red-and-gold knickers – Malfoy came more alive. And yet...there was something peculiar about his attitude.
‘Oh. No, it’s...it’s not like that.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘I’m not the one who just came prematurely. And do you know what "nicely" means?’
sleeping in our home, you practically
Draco Malfoy was excited. His training was over, he had passed all his exams with top marks and his master healer, mentor and fatherly friend Albert Jenkins had solemnly handed him his diploma a week ago. And now he should come to his first real department. Of course he had gone through all possible wards in his training, had entered almost every field of healing and had learned so much that his head nearly burst on some evenings, but now the time of grace was over. It was Monday and the new class of healers, with Draco 8 more young witches and wizards, were to be assigned to their new positions.
Green eyes looked at him expectantly.
“Just relax, baby, I’ll take care of you”, Draco whispered against Harry’s toned abs and the black-haired man chuckled, because Draco used his own lines against him.
And Draco just stared. He had completely forgotten the half-filled glass in one hand, the bottle with vodka in the other. Only when the guest in front of him waved his hand in front of his nose, Draco woke up from his temporary paralysis.
"I know. It's been a long time..."
"I think it was supposed to trigger exactly like it did. Disable the Auror for some time, demoralize and eliminate him. The Italian thing you wrote in the file was certainly just a stupid coincidence. But the panic attacks were real. I think he can go home tomorrow morning. When he can go back to work is the other question. He's still pretty whacked out."
"I'll get you something for the fever and the pain, yeah? Then you can sleep for a while."
Draco was on his feet as well, obviously surprised by the sudden outburst. Harry grabbed Draco’s slender wrist and pulled him close.
“Oh, shove it!” Draco grins and slaps Harry’s arm, but the Auror is faster and grabs his hand. Quickly he rolls them over, so he’s now lying on top of Draco and tickles his fiancé, leaving him giggling and gasping for air.
Potter was still lying in the bed Draco had taken him to the night before. He looked up in surprise as he saw the blonde and lifted his eyebrow.
"I know you didn't want that..." he said quietly. "I know that, Harry."
"What are you doing, Harry?"
"I'm not sorry."
"Don't give Potter anything against the pain. I don't know exactly how this will react with the antidote. Lay him on his side and keep him warm, the body temperature can drop quickly. I'll go to the lab and hopefully have a medicine for him in 10 minutes. Tell Granger to wait for me."
“So?”, Draco asked impatiently.
Six weeks had passed since Harry Potter's last visit to the ER. It was just half past three in the morning and Draco and Anthony were on duty. Actually it was supposed to be a quiet night. From experience, there was not much going on in the middle of the week, so the ward was only half staffed, but suddenly they heard a little tumult from the reception area. Several people were talking wildly across eachother and Draco didn't understand a single word. Then they heard Gladys calling their names, so that he and his colleague rushed into the corridor in front of the treatment rooms.
"Come on, Harry. Don't make a fuss. You can't be alone in this state."
She had already hurried back outside and the four healers from treatment room No. 4 ran after her. They heard the hoarse, tortured screams from the waiting area. A deep male voice shouted and moaned apparently in agony. And Draco only needed to take one look at him and knew immediately who they were dealing with.
"Potter, hey, Potter! Can you hear me?"
"Draco, thank you for everything. I have to say, you've really changed."
! He had called him by his first name - and this time his brain wasn't full of panic and delusions.
The other man, who introduced himself as Connor Benson, also an Auror and looking also a little wrecked, sighed impatiently.
Lots and lots of shimmering lights and candles lit up the streets, fir springs were hanging above our heads between the houses, decorated with candy canes and ornaments. The sound of little bells and Christmas carols overlay the crowded street. It truly was beautiful.
Finally he tore his gaze back and looked at me. His smile was genuine, and just a tiny bit sad. “Yeah, I’m okay.” His warm hand tenderly cupped my cheek. “You look beautiful, you know that?” And then he kissed me. His lips were so soft and hot and Merlin, I could do this all night long.
Harry felt his cheeks heating up. “Well, he’s… attractive?”
"And yet you still waited patiently until the end of work," Draco snarled mockingly. " Gee, Potter, that's so gryffindor of you. How noble..."
“Please, god, please!”, I begged. “Just let me – nghhaa – let me come, daddy!”
Soon the pub got more and more crowded and Draco simply had no time at all the think about the dark-haired man with the green eyes and the tattoos. He tapped beer, mixed cocktails and long drinks, washed glasses… trying to glimpse Harry in the crowded place.
“Turn around.”
“Do you even think he’s gay?”, Draco blurted to Pansy over the noise of the music and the crowd.
“Yeah”, Harry breathes. There’s no question, but there is just this answer.
to exploding.
Recap: Harry Potter is an idiot and Draco didn't want to see him again in the E.R.
“You’re going to freeze your ass off!”
Harry’s eyes went wide and he sat up again. These were Draco’s safewords for when they play. For when they have one of their scenes with tying up and spanking and Draco begging and crying for release. “Do you think –“ He cleared his throat. “Do you think that’ll be necessary?”
"Then tell me." The words had left Draco's mouth before he could stop them. Merlin, what had got into him? Why did he offer Potter to pour out his heart?
Ron’s voice yanked me out of my blissful doze. I had my head buried in Harry’s lap, cuddling into the soft fabric of his sweatpants as we were sitting on my favourite couch in the 8
"I have no idea! Of course he didn't have a clue what was inside, otherwise he wouldn't have drunk it, would he? So I remember that the window in the kitchen was open... Maybe... Well, maybe he didn't get the bottle until the few minutes we both weren't in the kitchen per owl or something!
"Is he serious?" he shouted loudly into his empty living room. "Is he fucking serious?!"
“But how – how can one be so stupid and not use any lube?!” Draco gasped between laughter.
His feet stop in front of a compact brick building. Slowly he creeps in the alley between this building and the next, so that he comes to the small backyard. Draco’s eyes wander up the façade and his heart skips a beat, when he sees dim light shining out of a window on the first floor. An idea strucks his mind and he bends down.
“You know who’s in control, right love?” His question was more of a harsh statement and Draco nodded quickly, closing his eyes as the pain and the pleasure grew
I shivered, as his cleaning charms washed over me. Then I just cuddled back into his chest and felt my eyes close and soft darkness embraced me.
Harry rubbed his face with both hands as if trying to erase the memory.
“Gosh, you’re so beautiful.”
"Why aren't you at Hermione’s or Weasley’s?"
“Can I try?”
“He’s unbelievable!”, she grumbles through gritted teeth and throws the door open.
Potter grumpled. "Uh, okay."
Draco chuckled. “Nearly, love.”
It had got dark outside and the two men had moved into the living room with two glasses of fire whiskey. Draco had lit the logs in the small fireplace and sat down in his corner of the couch, while Harry had sat down in the armchair, which stood at right angles to the dark grey sofa. Draco was comfortable, the food had been good, the fireplace was burning and the wine and liquor were warming him from the inside. He noticed that he was a bit drunk, but it didn't matter... In fact, it was just very cozy. Yawning, he pulled up his legs and looked into the flames.
“You must have been half-hard the whole night, baby”, Harry murmured against Draco’s throat, sucking the white skin.
I felt his laugh rumbling in his flat stomach underneath my cheeks. He tried to pull the seam of his hoodie up, so I would have to come outside in this cruel, cold world.
"Since when are you sick?"
"But actually I think it's quite nice," the blonde added in a small voice.
He groaned as Harry released his dick with a wet pop. “I thought you wanted less talking and more fucking?”, Harry teased.
Draco stared at him for a moment, surprised, then he laughed briefly.
," Harry replied mattely and groaned as he turned a little.
Draco frowned. "What do you mean?"
In the locker room, Draco quickly slipped into his new white robes decorated with red darts on the seams, chest, shoulders and back. "It makes me look like a ghost," he thought as he looked at his pale face in the mirror.
We stopped. Harry’s eyes were full of sympathy. “You wanna come, baby?”
“Yes, what?”
Harry grins and presses a kiss on the other man’s forehead. “Missed you, too, baby.”
Draco pushed himself around the couch on his stool again and looked into stunned green eyes. Only now he noticed that Potter had replaced this ugly glasses from his school days with a more modern one with a black frame and square lenses. He looked pretty good... Damn it, Draco! Pull yourself together!
that Draco's heart almost stopped. A tingling and crackling seemed to run through all his veins and the blood was rushing in his ears. They didn't move or make any noise, as if they both felt how fragile the whole thing was between them. After what felt like an eternity, perhaps just a few seconds, Harry detached his lips from Dracos and, with his eyes still closed, leaned his forehead against the blonde's.
Draco felt his cheeks blush again.
When he looked up again, Draco was taking a sip of his espresso macchiato, the smirk still evident in the corners of his mouth. This beautiful, full-lipped, way to sassy mouth.
“I love you so –
Draco could now take a better look at them. In the dim light of the pub he could see something like a big stag on a glade, designed in black and white and geometrical lines. And on the back of his hand there was a delicate lily stretching from his wrist to his fingers. The other things Draco couldn’t see, but in all it looked beautiful.
"Oh and I'm not supposed to be flattered?" Again a white grin appeared in the dark beard.
He turned back to the pots and Draco felt his cheeks turn red.
And so, Draco’s way to success had been a rocky road. He worked day and night, creating new flavours, giving away free samples, making more ice cream, gaining his customers’ trust. But after a few months, in the middle of a hot summer, he had made it. People loved his ice cream.
“Pansy has the flu”, I answered casually. “But I will ask the boys!”
"You thought I left, didn't you?" the young Auror asked with a crooked grin.
Harry rolled his eyes and chuckled softly. Draco could be such a Slytherin sometimes.
Harry Potter's eyes widened when he realised who was standing in front of him.
Yawning and stretching his sore back, Harry unlocked the door to his and Draco’s flat on the outskirts of London. It got late that evening and Harry’s neck hurt due to all the paperwork he had to work through. He knew Draco must be home for at least a few hours, judging by the punctual closing times of Flourish and Blotts. Working as an auror, Harry not even knew such things as early evenings at home and free weekends. He was hungry and tired and when he took a glimpse in the empty kitchen, he saw a bowl of the delicious, savoury beef stew Draco sometimes made, steaming slightly under a stasis charm.
reflexes, because I definitely wasn’t expecting to be
But then I heard a soft, rustling sound. I craned my neck to see, what he was doing. And I saw something red and white in his hands. What the hell?
"Thank you very much, Sir!"
“That’s it!” Harry slammed his flat hand on the table, startling the nearby guests. Heat flooded his limps and brain. He stood up, fumbled for his wallet in the back pocket of his jeans and carelessly flung a few notes onto the table.
"Shall I be honest?" he muttered.
“You’re a proper pain in the ass, Malfoy”, Harry grumbled, taking a sulky bite of his croissant.
They kissed slowly. Just a gentle touch of their lips and just the tiniest nip of their tongues.
The next hour was torture. Well, it felt fucking good, but nevertheless. Torture!
Harry nodded shakily. Then he exhaustedly dropped his head back onto the headrest and stared at the ceiling. "I'm so sick of these nightmares," he growled annoyed. "As if the usual ones weren't enough. After this strange spell they have become even worse."
Harry also raised his almost empty glass.
, the blonde thought spiteful. Draco turned back to Potter... Harry... and looked at him expectantly. The dark-haired man had listened silently. He seemed almost too weak to interfere. He looked at his big hands in his lap, which trembled slightly.
Draco hummed understandingly. “And when do we get to the point where your ass comes on stage?”, he asked lightly.
"Here, Sir," the former Slytherin answered and raised a hand.
He’s the singer, Draco thought. Fuck. Draco cursed his susceptibility for male singers. He swallowed hard and answered: “Sure, I’ll bring it up right before your gig. Do you guys need anything else?”
We both moaned in unison as Harry pressed deeper and deeper inside my tight hole.
of a man. Palming his stiffening dick through his jeans, Draco took a deep breath and grabbed a few limes to cut in pieces for tonight’s Cuba Libres and Caipirinhas.
