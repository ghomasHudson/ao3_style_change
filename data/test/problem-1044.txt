Harry fidgeted. ‘Difficult time’ seemed a bit of a strange thing to call an addiction, but he wasn’t about to point that out.
He groaned, brought his hands up to cover his face, and laid back down in the fetal position. Why did Potter tell him that, especially when Draco was so obviously pissed? Potter was clearly pissed too, and it might have just come out unwittingly. Draco could live with that explanation.
Draco glanced back over at Leo and gave an apologetic shrug; Leo frowned but held his tongue, unable to say anything with their companions back in earshot.
After much deliberation, he read and reread the summary that was on that support group’s website. It was another week before he emailed them, saying he was interested in joining. When they emailed back, saying they’d love to have him and providing all of the information, he read and reread that too.
“Come on, Harry,” Ginny said, her voice softer now but still firm, “You’re smarter than this. You’re
Harry firecalled Ginny the next morning. When her face appeared in the fire, tired and yawning, he asked if she’d go get coffee with him. She declined citing tiredness, so Harry offered to bring coffee (plus pastries) for the two of them (and Blaise!). She nodded and disappeared.
“The first stage has been completed,” Draco told them. “The second stage will take place tomorrow night, stage three two days after that, and after that he should be completely cleansed of all foreign chemicals that are currently in his body.”
Should he give it to Potter now? Or should he wait until tomorrow? Draco checked his watch. It was already six. Would it be better to leave Potter to rest for the night? He knew he didn’t exactly aid Potter in relaxing – quite the opposite, really. But on the other hand, he wanted to give Potter Wolff’s contact details as soon as possible on the chance that Potter would change his mind about treatment again.
“Yes, of course,” he cut over her quickly, suddenly wanting to leave Wolff’s office. “Thank you, Healer Wolff.”
“It didn’t do anything,” Draco continued, his voice fainter. “It bled, but when it healed, it healed completely. There weren’t any scars left over to show what I did. I tried several times, but it couldn’t be changed. So I thought I had to live with it. I kept it covered all the time. I was ashamed and angry and I felt ill every time I looked at it and so finally I just figured I’d distract myself from it. If I couldn’t get rid of it, replace it. So I did. Life…creation, over death.” He flushed a little bit, and lowered his bare arm. “It’s ludicrous, but there you have it.”
“39.6°? That’s…what, about 103° in Fahrenheit? Christ,” muttered Estrada. “Betty, could you go get me a Fever-Reducing Potion?”
“You might feel better after punching Draco,” Potter said. When Granger tensed, he added quickly, “I’m kidding. No one’s punching anyone. We’re all adults, and the past is in the past, as you like to say.”
Harry thought the waitress looked at them with interest, as if trying to figure out all their ties. They were quite the group, the six of them, obviously familiar with each other but not quite
“But, um,” Draco went on, while Hermione and Ron looked at him strangely, “Thank you again, and I’ll…leave if you want me too. I wouldn’t blame you.” He finished awkwardly.
“Hello, Weasley, Granger,” Draco said, and folded his hands. He sighed. “As you read, Potter’s being difficult. He’s still under the impression that he’ll be leaving tomorrow, and I’m certain I don’t need to tell you how terrible that idea is.”
Draco was heating the cauldron and running through the list of instructions when Potter returned. Draco barely acknowledged him as he began picking through the ingredients to find the ones he needed first. He could feel Potter watching him as he worked, making him even tenser than he was before. He desperately hoped he wouldn’t muck it up; embarrassing himself in front of Potter was the last thing he needed. He’d already spent much too long humiliating himself.
“It’s your birthday tomorrow, mate, not mine,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice even. “I’d be fine with it if you are.”
“I agree with you, mate,” Ron had said as he went back to work. “I guess we really do need to catch up with the Muggles.”
A knock at the door brought their attention to Leonel, who stepped inside, a grim look on his handsome face. He didn’t look at the parchment in his hands before he spoke, choosing instead to meet Granger’s and Weasley’s worried eyes.
"I am certain Mungo's would be happy to accommodate you for the time being. Do you have someone to keep you accountable?"
“I knew you didn’t exactly feel comfortable, despite what you said earlier today, so I kept it vague,” Harry told him. “And anyway, I’d sprung enough on them for one day. I don’t know how they’d react if I told them I was seeing
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, clearing his throat. He slid into the booth opposite Malfoy and clasped his hands together underneath the table. “Thanks for inviting me.”
“You don’t need to say anything, Draco,” Harry said, releasing him. He sounded more like his usual self now – more collected, less distressed. He looked at Draco a moment, though Draco wasn’t sure how much Harry could actually see without his glasses on. “Really. I, er, talking is good. I’m not saying I’m magically cured or anything, but it helps.”
After lunch, Draco was dragged along to the library by Pansy, and the two of them were accompanied by the Greengrasses. This was clearly a thinly veiled attempt to keep Draco within her sight after they’d eaten, and Draco begrudgingly let it happen. He’d skip dinner to make up for it.
Draco’s eyes widened fractionally before growing dark with lust. He withdrew his fingers and slicked his cock thoroughly, openly taking in Harry with his eyes – Harry’s face, his body, his hard cock. Harry’s breath hitched as Draco smoothly positioned himself over Harry, plying his legs apart (not that it was difficult, really, Harry would do anything Draco wanted at this point) so Draco could have easy access.
Draco stood outside the Muggle patisserie with trepidation. He peered inside through the windows, his hands stuffed in his coat pockets. It was fairly busy, people of all ages going in and out with coffee and pastries. He could catch a glimpse of bright red hair towards the back of the shop.
"Dragons are cool," Harry said simply. "I could be deep and say they've played a big part in my life, or that they're tough and resilient or whatever, but I just like the look of it."
“I swear,” Draco gasped as Harry came to rest at his side, a horrible (wonderful) smile on his face.
Draco’s brows furrowed. He didn’t think he’d ever heard Potter say ‘please’ in his entire life, much less to him.
“Anyway,” Draco cleared his throat, his grey eyes now bright with intent, “I was under the impression that we came here to get
Blaise stood there with Ginny Weasley by his side. He was looking quite pleased with himself, considering he’d called her a blood traitor just a few short years ago. Weasley, however, wore a scowl on her face, clearly only there to appease Blaise.
Harry did so and uncrossed his arms. Breathing exercises weren’t always effective for him, as his mind tended to wander a fair bit. The disastrous occlumency lessons that took place so long ago was proof of that.
"I did, yes," Draco said. He sat back down at the foot of his bed. "I think you can see that I'm not really fit for company at the moment."
“Ah. Yes, of course,” Ira nodded. “Have you eaten yet? We can get a bite to eat while you tell me what you need to.”
“Harry, you’re a wonderful person,” she said, and when Harry rolled his eyes, she continued, “Really, you are. You’re strong and caring and compassionate, and what’s even more incredible is that you’re still all this after – everything. If he doesn’t want anything to happen again, it’s his loss, honestly.”
Potter opened the door a moment later looking incredibly groggy. His hair was wilder than usual and he was wearing what Draco assumed to be his pajamas.
“Oh yes, well,” Luna said, looking at him with her wide eyes. She was dressed in Muggle clothing, though there was still something quite odd and Luna-esque about them, “I find that Muggles have a wider collection of what they call ‘vegan’ food. Do you know what that is, Harry?”
“Oh, business as usual,” Blaise said in that silken voice of his. “It's a nice place, but there’s far too much greenery, if you ask me.”
Harry pulled back the curtain and stood up, back and arse to Draco. He noticed that he was right; Harry did still have his socks on.
“Er, yeah,” Potter said. He sounded tired – exhausted. When he looked Draco in the eye, he frowned, which was
“Lie back,” Draco told him, and Harry obeyed immediately, feeling shivers run up his spine as Draco straddled him.
He stayed in the same position for a good ten minutes before getting out of bed and shakily walking himself to the shower. He was sore in the best way possible, in the way that he hadn’t been in literal years. Harry winced as he bent to turn on the water. As he waited for the water to turn hot, he glanced at himself in the mirror, pleasantly surprised by what he’d saw.
It was. His wand of nearly seven years. He grasped it firmly, and he felt right again, like he was no longer missing a vital part of himself – something he didn’t even know he was missing. Draco goggled at it, turning it over repeatedly in his hands. He looked up at Harry, who was grimacing.
Malfoy and Estrada. Estrada and Malfoy. All the unspoken words, how Estrada had looked away whenever Harry asked too much about Malfoy, the way they both had said they knew each other “well.”
“You’ll be able to see everyone soon enough. Whenever you feel up to it, of course, but you know, you’ll be released tomorrow,” Hermione said as if Harry didn’t know this himself, “And I’ve got a good feeling – about it all – this time around. Really,” she added at Harry’s scoff. “The circumstances are different and you’ve been doing so well…”
He still felt shaken up, but he knew Hermione and Ron would be anxious to know how the appointment had gone. Harry had told them about it yesterday during their visit, feeling strange as he did so. Hermione and Ron took it in stride, however, and reassured him that it was the right thing to do. Still, he didn’t know if he could handle the both of them right now.
“It was. You were,” Harry said earnestly. Draco’s insides felt light and airy, and he didn’t have the heart to stamp those feelings down. “Well, maybe not the last time. I was gutted, if I’m being honest, Ma– Draco, but er…I don’t think I’d be where I am right now if you hadn’t done that.”
“No ice, I’m afraid,” Ira said as they took a seat once more. “Though it’s often cold enough in here where I don’t think it’s all that necessary.”
As he straightened up from the side of the bed, his eyes caught on the shiny black card that Malfoy had given him yesterday. It was sitting on the bedside table innocently enough, but as soon as Harry’s tired brain processed what it was, he felt nauseated all over again. Annoyed, Harry snatched the business card and glared down at it.
“Good, yeah.” He hesitated, then said, “Thanks. For forcing me to talk about it. I, er, probably wouldn’t’ve otherwise and I guess I needed it.”
“It’s still fucking weird,” Harry couldn’t contain a short laugh. He finally opened his eyes and met Draco’s glare. “You put in loads of time to make them. Did you make them yourself, or did you get people to help you?”
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen her – let alone this closely. She was beautiful as ever, though she already looked older and more mature. She wasn’t a teenage girl fighting for her life anymore; she was a woman, courageous and funny and kind and strong. Her brown eyes were sad as they studied Harry’s face. He suddenly felt conscious of how poorly he must have looked.
“What? What is it?” Potter asked roughly, though he didn’t actually sound mad. Draco knew very intimately what Potter sounded like when he was mad. “Malfoy?”
“Morning, Blaise,” Draco said uncertainly. He got out of bed and smoothed down his hair instinctively. “Where’s Theo?”
“Straighten out your back,” Draco said, and Potter obeyed. “Now inhale deeply, as long as you can. Keep the air in.”
Harry ran a hand through his dark hair and huffed. “Fine. Will you come with me to breakfast at least?”
Pansy and Blaise were the only people he could feel comfortable enough to talk to, but even conversation with them felt forced more often than not. He could feel Pansy’s worried gaze on him frequently, and she’d tried to get him to open up several times. Even Blaise had tried to start a few conversations with him, sent by Pansy, no doubt.
“I won’t stop trying,” said Harry lowly, coming closer. Draco was utterly fixated on him, and a thrill ran through Harry’s body as he realized this. “You already know how stubborn I am.”
He filled the kettle with water and left it to heat as he set up the drip mechanism. It was Muggle, yes, but as there were quite a few Muggleborn or Half-Blood employees, it needed to exist. And Draco found that he quite liked it. Once the water had finished boiling, he poured it over the ground coffee, watching as the water-turned-coffee sunk lower and lower, revealing the coffee grounds underneath.
Draco jumped violently when he felt a hand on his shoulder. His widened eyes stared at it for a long moment before moving to Potter, who was gazing at him seriously. Chills ran down his back as he struggled for words. Potter beat him to it.
They were going out for drinks. Social drinking. Not drinking-to-forget-how-much-you-wanted-to-die drinking.
Draco tried to be alright with it, he really did, but then he found himself asking, “Don’t you care if people see?”
and the only one who can do that is you. So you're not bloody leaving until it's sorted and you admit that you’re ill."
“I should just bring my own wardrobe at this rate,” Draco observed, sifting through Harry’s apparently subpar collection.
Pushing these thoughts aside, Draco continued responding to his mother’s letter. He wrote without pause, only stopping when he got to the final paragraph. Would he be staying at Hogwarts or coming home?
“You can’t just excuse it all,” Draco said angrily. “I’m not a good person, Potter. I never was, and I never will be. Even if I didn’t have this fucking Mark on me, I wouldn’t be good. I almost killed your best friend, for Merlin’s sake, and Granger was tortured in my own bloody home!”
“Oh, Draco. Did you really think I was going to disapprove? Like I’d be so tactless,” she scoffed. “As much as we like to say we’re more advanced than the Muggles, they’ve certainly figured out sexuality far sooner than us. We as a society are so behind, Draco, but not me. You have nothing to worry about.”
Once done, she flushed and smiled at Harry. “There, that’s done. Now, show me all of your Muggle drugs.”
“Sorry, it’s just me – “ Draco stopped and huffed out a frustrated breath. “It’s me putting my Healer hat on again. Overthinking things. Worrying about things,” Draco emphasized, hoping Harry would understand.
"Did'ja know there's a hefty price on your head, Harry? It's all they're talking about in.... certain circles...."
" he interrupted, "I need you to get me on the calendar for a meeting at the Ministry of Magic for tomorrow afternoon."
I had only hoped I might find those things by proxy to someone like you, but then you incidentally offered me the answer that I didn't even know I was looking for! One little offhand mention of a long forgotten fable and it finally became clear: I don't need to feed off of other people's greatness like a leech when I can have it for myself!
bit they've played all these years and the resulting Gryffindor vs Slytherin thing that's blown up because of them isn't going to help them. Thus, we need to show that we can all get along or at least
"That I never abuse it or invite anyone else beyond the wards." And he hadn't. He'd had to tell Blaise so that he wouldn't worry when he disappeared overnight but even he had never set foot beyond the wards.
Potter blushed. "I mean, I could do the wandwork!" Draco bit his lip and nodded. Potter's blush deepened but he continued: "You're cleverer than I --"
Harry sighed heavily as Madam Pomfrey headed back to her quarters. "I don't even know where to start..." His eyes widened slightly with panic. Draco reached out to put a calming hand on his shoulder and he watched as Harry's face switched from anxious to contemplative to a shy nervousness. "Hey, Draco, do you think you could come with me?"
"Hmm?" Draco was stirred from his thoughts to find father scowling at him and mother looking peeved. "Oh, yes, wonderful."
"I couldn't remember exactly where it was, but I know it has to be around here, somewhere," Harry said as they turned yet another corner.
"Then I'll tell them all about what to watch out for when dating knuckleheaded boys and you can cover anything that involves even the remotest knowledge of female anatomy."
"Sure, why not?" She smiled smugly and he shook his head. What he had experienced with Draco had been intense passion but Ginny still had the ability to make him feel special during the times when he felt his worst. What that meant, he didn't know. Neither did he know where they stood or what either of them needed, but the fact that she could still show up for him at a time like this as his friend meant something. "How are you, Harry, really?"
Running into Potter and his estranged Aunt had opened Draco's mind to an alternate reality that had been kept from him and, now that he'd had a glimpse of what could have been, he felt slighted. What would it have been like if Andromeda had been a part of his life all along? To have a fun, cool aunt who was friends with Harry Potter instead of a batshit crazy one. Would he have already been allowed to be a part of that picture, there for Christmas dinners with the 3 of them, if she had?
he whispered directly into Harry's ear. Harry sighed but nodded against his nose. Draco took a deep breath and waited until the next flash of light showed Sebastian in a tree dense area of the forest. Draco exhaled and said a brief prayer as he apparated them, blindly, between two trees not far from where he'd last glimpsed the man.
"Draco." Astoria reached out and wrapped herself around his arm. He frowned down at her. "Are you still mad at me?"
Narcissa finally faced him square on, "My perfect boy never would have broken his mother's heart if it weren't for this... this...
Draco couldn't help the smile that spread across his face. He watched as she walked towards the entrance hall and paused before she went in.
Stevens' urgent shouts carried up the stairs and effectively defused the moment before it could even properly get going! Draco scowled and Harry shot him an apologetic smile before flipping Draco onto his back in one smooth, fluid motion. He kissed his nose before he stood and pulled on the nearest t-shirt (which was definitely Draco's).
"Well, first of all, I think not acknowledging your sexual trauma would be foolish for both of us. You've got to remember that I was there, too, Harry... It was traumatic for me in a different type of way..." He swallowed hard and Harry'd stared into intense grey eyes that showed a glimpse of the pain behind them. He had never thought much about what that must've been like for Draco to have witnessed. "It's a particular type of hell to stand by helplessly and watch someone you lo--" He stopped himself but Harry's heart still fluttered. "To watch someone you care about -- even if you
Bill placed a firm hand on his shoulder and grinned proudly. "You are a good and honorable mate, George."
"No, but would you like something to eat while you wait? On the house, of course -- Harry never has to pay here and, since you're the first friend he's ever brought, I'll extend the curtesy. I'm Kamal, by the way."
Draco looked hesitant though his eyes burned with passion. Finally, he nodded and Harry scrambled off of him, taking Draco's hand in his as he hurriedly lead him to his bedroom.
"Are those our wedding robes?" Harry squinted and Draco gasped when he followed his gaze and realized that Ginny was, indeed, holding two garment bags from Madam Malkins'.
**Update August 30th, 2020** I edited the part written in Draco's POV in this chapter because it wasn't sitting right with me. Not a big change and doesn't add too too much to the story, but does make it flow better and seem more genuine, IMHO. Adding the note here in case you're coming back to it and wondering "What the heck?" and I'll add the same note to the beginning of next chapter I'll post today for those who might have already read the chapter but are interested in going back to read the changes.
Draco rolled his eyes. They were standing concealed in the woods on the outskirts of the Parkinson residence. The sun was just starting to set which meant they didn't have much time.
Draco had heard about texting, virtual mail sent instantly between devices. He'd asked pansy about it in their letters but her family was rather conservative and she didn't think they'd approve of her purchasing muggle technology. He'd told her it would make their conversations so much easier but there was a bit of nostalgia and romance in owl mail so he hadn't pressed too much. He had a new freedom that pansy and some of the other conservator puebloods didn't, without the guidance of his family and with the disdain of the wizarding world draco was free to explore as he wished, and muggle things were suddenly a whole lot less forign. Watching Harry use a phone made him curious about getting one himself, it couldn't be that hard if potter was able to use it.
"Not you, give me bud," Ginny fussed, wriggling around to rest her back against Harry's legs. Harry passed her the joint skeptically, breathing a cloud of bluish smoke onto the top of her head and laughed stupidly when she started coughing and sputtering. Luna confiscated the weed.
friday mornings he woke up to yellow light filtering through the window and the smell of the shower down the hall and coffee ready made sitting on the stove. he arched his back under the duvet and stretched out his spine, digging his heels into the soft mattress. he spent a moment suspended from the bed to think through the list of names in his head.
"You got your potions done then? All up to date?" She passed him the joint and tied the front of her cardigon up waiting patiently for Harry to answer. Harry watched the rolled bud smoulder and go cold in his fingers for a minute, nodding absently. He lit it again and breathed in deeply, grinning at Luna who asked suddenly "how is draco?"
"You find it alright?" Draco said, scraping the diced ferns into the sleeping drought with an obsidian blade. He was side eyeing Harry, who was paler than before. Harry scowled at him and picked up his notes, reading over the next step instead of responding. dracos brow furrowed and he looked away, somewhat disappointed. He had begun to feel at ease with Harry being in his home, brewing potions with him in his kitchen. perhaps he had imagined it.
The spray was hot, turning his skin red. It felt nice though, such a contrast to dracos cool house and cold body and chilling touch. Harry had started walking towards the main road from Draco's house after he had left, not trusting himself to apparate in his state. He had been shaking and was still a little drunk and his nails were quickly disappearing. He got there and turned to the direction he thought his house might be, but hailed the first carriage that rattled past and let them deliver him home.
His first conversation with jordan in sixth grade, out in the forest for a herbology lesson looking for bracken ferns, slipped through his memory. Jordan had approached him openly and unafraid, introducing himself and holding out a dirty hand for draco to shake. It had been on a day when his usual possy, crabbe and goyal, were in detention for something Draco hadn't bothered to commit to memory, and he had been feeling relaxed without peer pressure to be a twat. Draco had even shaken Jordan's hand, maybe he had even smiled.
And Jordan had seen right through him there in the forest, Draco could remember the look in his eyes. Jordan had noted the change in dracos posture, how content he seemed in solitude, and draco had felt fear and relief  swamp him. Fear that he was so revealing, that he had let his guard down, that someone may have been able to slip between the plates of armour Draco wore round the clock. And relief that he might have found someone to shed it with.
of the trip to see his dear friend Blaize, getting a tan, or horribly sunburnt. He felt new energy to do
“You didn't get me anything,” ginny said. She pulled herself out of her chair and flicked a drying charm at Harry who thanked her quietly.
like a chant every spare moment of thought it played out in his head, dancing across his lips quietly and dampening his mood. Friday turned really grey quickly.  he rolled out of bed and pulled clothes onto his body. school started at nine. in the kitchen of their small flat ginny was buttering toast with the back of a teaspoon and scratching at her leg up on the counter next to the stove. Harry wrapped an arm around her shoulders and squeezed her gently, the wool knit of her jumper itched his face.
“How uh,” draco started, not sure where the sudden need to fill the silence came from, “how are you doing in history class?” he asked stupidly. Harry gazed at him, his head lulled back and forth with idiot serenity. He considered his answer for a minute, wiping his face with his hands and scratching the cat behind the ears. His only answer was a shrug for a time.
Ginny groaned and rolled around on the grass to wake herself up. Luna joined her, together they flattened the greenery and fussed around more than was necessary.
Draco pulled a pot of lentils he'd made for dinner last night out of the fridge and set it on the stove top, waving at it to turn the burner on. Harry was acting differently, he was kinder to draco now and for a moment there draco had thought maybe he shared his feelings, but he had batted the thought down quickly. Still, it was hard not to let his hopes pick up a little. Harry was saying something about Kelly's, draco saw him tapping at one of those black handheld muggle devices with his thumbs. He'd been into a telephone shop once, Apple, what an odd name for a telephone. The whole experience had been altogether overwhelming and he had left quickly without buying anything. He bent over the bench to watch Harry use the device, it was a complicated process with a lot of flat glowing buttons, he read the word
"carry on," harry shuffled his papers and coughed into his fist, giving a short nod. he scribbled down the rest of seans notes quickly into his book. he's had enough of parchment scrolls and quills, it had been fun at hogwarts but the innocent magic and impracticality of such a practice had surpassed him along his journey and he had bought muggle lined paper and ballpoint pens to use for his final catchup years of study. Many kids had chosen extended years, like Harry, running a more advanced and in depth seventh year over a two year period. They were almost finished with the first year having started the final term, and Harry was looking forward to the holidays the same way he had begun to look forward to weekends.
that he wore a necklace of the thing around his neck, draco reached out to hold Harry's hand still so he could examine the little details, tiny intricate scales and sharp teeth and mean eyes, it was beautiful and haunting.
“There's a little walking path I like, always covered in moss. Did you know the niplets that spread it live in the creek down that way? I want to find some,” luna petted the seedling she was holding gently, roughing up its roots to get the soil off them, “also bring your cat, i want to meet him.”
Draco strolled over steadily and pulled the chair out, sliding into the seat. He turned out a parchment and a muggle fountain pen from his satchel and settled in, spinning the pen in his slender fingers.
“Ok, alright, so these three never actually cook anything right?” draco looked completely baffled, he waved his empty glass at the T.V, “what audacity! They just judge everyone's meals!” he hollered. Harry and Draco were well on their way through the bottle of bourbon, tucked up next to one another on the couch watching masterchef. It was a nice little couch, draco had bought it thinking the cream colour would match the rest of his living room well but as it turned out the style was completely off. It was too plump and rounded for the rest of the decorations and articles in the little room but hadn't been culled yet for something more stylish because it was so tremendously comfortable. It was a luxurious two seater, perfect for laying down with your head on one arm rest, and more than big enough for two people. Yet somehow Draco had found himself half on Harry's cushion pressed up against his side unashamedly yelling at the television where a large man was scolding his new favourite chef for over cooking a piece of meat. In any other state, a sober state for instance, draco would be ashamed of such an outburst. But he felt lightheaded and stupid and confident.
busy, like he had a life. He still ate dinner at the same time as his cat most nights, studied more than regular students he was sure, and made some new paths in the forest, but aside from the regular routines he had other people to do other things with, to think about. He even forgot to wright pansy a letter on tuesday. The one he had received contained a large amount of cuss words and complaining and unnecessary capitalisation, a rarity for such a sensible woman as pansy. She hadn't been getting along with her  parents as of late and draco had to suffer through three pages of her nonsense. At least she had apologised for it at the end. Their owl, Nightwing, seemed grateful for draco letting it stay and rest the night, it had not bitten him in the morning. He resented the bird a little,
Draco looked up and held both his hands out for Harry to pull him to his feet. He wobbled, gripping harrys hands tightly for a second, he felt light and dangerously relaxed. Like he could say something he shouldn't say, or do something he would regret later. Like he could lean into potter and press his forehead to Harry's chest, the material was cold and damp.
and very much liked it. He wanted to do more things together with people, with Harry. He had done enough healing on his own and felt ready for the stuff he had to do
Draco glanced up at Harry, furrowing his brows. Harry's knee was bouncing and he was muttering to himself, a silent chant, like a curse or incarnation and draco felt a jolt in his chest. Then the brunet noticed him and stilled, looking a little annoyed and embarrassed for a passing moment. Harry pulled a small tin container of herbal cigarolls from the chest pocket of his jacket. Luna had introduced him to them when she caught him having a panic attack back in his first term at this new school. He'd known her to smoke a little pot from time to time on the astrology tower at Hogwarts with a few cheeky hufflepuffs and wasn't surprised when she pushed some of her hippy smokes on him in his moments of panic. And to his surprise they had actually helped calm him. They sometimes went out to the forest to pick wild jage leaves and collect absynth flowers that they dried in the kitchen and rolled. Ginny didn't partake in smoking, she didn't approve of it, wanting to be in peak fitness and health for her quidditch. She had shown some promise and there were rumours of holly harpie scouts being sent out to the schools next game.
“What are you looking at?” Harry asked, appearing out of nowhere. Draco yelped and fell back onto his bum.  Harry had almost filled his little heshed bag with chamomile, draco could smell it from where he sat, and some other purplish leaves were poking out of the top. Draco saw Harry still had leaves and moss in his hair.
"did you bring a cauldron?" He turned to Harry, examining his mish matched outfit. He had a red collared shirt under a thick black jacket with wooden buttons and a terrible thin knitted scarf in purples and browns. To top it off he was wearing corduroy trousers. but he looked good in it somehow. Maybe it was the olive skin and the soft green eyes, and Draco found himself shivving his imagination for thinking such sentences.
draco pulled himself out of the shower, clenching and unclenching his fists to stop his fingers from shaking. what a way to start his sunday. he looked at himself in the mirror and frowned at a growing bruise on his forehead where he must have hit his head in his writhing sleep. he pulled open the second draw where his products were kept, fine hair conditioner and tea tree shampoos, aftershave that smells like cinnamon and pine needles and a cologne he had found in a muggle store that took to his fancy, and a little bottle of fresh healing potion that he had made in class last week. he dabbed it onto the bruise on his face and ran a comb through his hair while he waited for the potion to settle into his skin.
There came a knock from the door and Ginny barged in stumbling over Harry's pile of clothes. She launched herself at the toilet and dropped her shorts.
"You should just come with us," luna was saying, pouring out more tea for Ginny who had been giving her side eyes about it, "the weather's nice for it."
He instructed Harry on the best way to chop the bore root and kept a close eye on him, not sure if brewing slightly stoned was the best idea. But Harry was diligent and careful and more concentrated than before so draco didn't say anything on the matter. He pondered while he stirred whether Harry ever attended classes in that state, and thought the answer was most likely a yes, he did. Then he considered how often, and why he'd never noticed. Which he supposed was the same reason he hadn't noticed his attraction until sixth year when Jordan had spelled it out for him. He had been avoiding the matter furiously, when it would have been easier to face head on in hindsight. Harry was a reasonable man and draco was sure he would have understood, spared some empathy in light of draco's dialemmer. Instead Draco had bullied him for years, a more extreme form of playground pigtail pulling backed up by poor parenting and prophecies that enabled self entitlement.
Harry spared draco one last glance and began walking back down the little trail, hands shoved deep in his pockets. Draco gave himself a minute,
“Hurry uppp,” ginny yelled at them from further down the trail, grinning maniacally. Harry flipped a finger and told her where she could shove the moss next time and jogged to catch up with them, leaving Draco to shove his hands in his pockets and wonder where he stood in Harry's life. His chubby white cat broke out of a bush near him and composed itself, strutting over to walk next to draco calmly.
but they were all inadequate responses. they would only serve to drive a steak between them and whatever progress they were making towards being something like, not quite friends, buddies perhaps. they may even descend back into arguments and snide comments, and Draco was surprised to find he didn't want that. that he had moved on and matured past the childish whims of fighting for fun and stirring shit. He felt like he could try to be a good student without the outliers.
“I hate that little lip in the doorway too,” Luna said, reading Harry's mind. Harry let luna pull him to his feet and joined her on the edge of a wooden garden bed. She patted his hair, picking grass out of it and apologising for having put it there in the first place. The air was chilly and little nocturnal bugs were waking up and flitting about, glowing in the dimming light. Luna smelt like lavender oil and hazelnuts, she pulled a joint from her bra and held it out for Harry to light. He picked at the dormant tomato plant behind him as she smoked, the front wispy pieces of her hair singing on the glowing end. Harry tucked them behind her ear for her gently.
“Lunas already beat you to that,” Harry muttered, nudging her with his boot. Luna stirred and peeled her eyelids open, looking up at him with big pale eyes. “Side along with Ginny home,” Harry told her, glancing at the ominous clouds gathering in the sky beyond the clearing, “it'll rain on the walk back, might as well apparate.”
"nothing," he settled for an appropriate answer to save face. it was better he held some ground, kept his space. He wouldn't check up on Harry's health. asking if harry was alright was what he had granger and the weasleys for. Draco was just helping him with his homework, and he  feared the word just in that thought the same way he felt saved by it.
“I don't think that's a real word,” ginny scoffed. She was in her chair playing with a hot bean bag, the grains inside it made pleasant grinding sounds. The chamomile was hanging in the kitchen by the window, they had washed it and every now and then draco heard a drop of water hit the bench. It was irritating, so different to his unit which was almost dead silent. Their house was far closer to the forest than his, the trees nearest rubbed against the roof and crickets chirped merrily and the whistling of air moving through the branches of the forest could be heard. The walls were very thin, draco supposed. Harry had done another warming charm on the house and Draco smiled pleasantly, he looked like a man who would produce a good amount of warmth. Ginny explained that he had burnt the quibbler and draco called it a nonsensical problem.
Draco malfoy took a swig of the sleeping drought he and harry had made together and lay down in bed, tucking the blankets in close to his sides. He thought about the word
"We should go out then," Harry said, picking up his glass, draco made a noise. He looked up at him as he took a sip, draco was wide eyed and red and it struck harry suddenly what he had said, he coughed into his glass, "I mean, the group, the uh, our little study table, to Kelly's," he spluttered, trying to make up ground for whatever line he had crossed. He emptied his glass and draco followed suit.
"skip potions with me later?'' The water was scalding when ginny turned the tap on to rinse out her mug and she dropped it in the sink, shattering. a swear word slipped out and she went hunting for her wand.
Friday morning. ... Friday mornings had changed for him, becoming a person or a colour almost.  It had taken a while for days to regain their substance and meaning, and a deal of healing to catch up, but now Friday morning signified the last day of the week, a day to spend looking forward to Saturday, to the weekend. The days had been traveling slowly, since the war and the cleanup that came next. and not just the cleanup of the school, that mess was easily swept under beds and hidden, but people needed cleaning too, cultures needed re shaping homes rebuilding around empty seats, new neighborhoods with new neighbors that would struggle for trust. cleanup after funerals clean up after parties, after weddings twice postponed and children conceived in the sudden shocking still and calm of the world. There was a lot of clean up, work hasn't returned to a regular schedule even months after His death, and the weeks in that time, and the few years before during the war, had simply been numbers to cross off on a calendar. but they were regaining substance. Wednesday felt green, number three of the week, one of Harry's favourite days. Saturday was red with energy and excitement and Sunday mulled down to a calmer purple slipping into blue Monday.
“Oh, Draco, you’re so boring when you’re obtuse,” he drawled. “Lately you’ve been all ‘Harry this,’ ‘Harry that.’ I see you looking at each other during meals. In Potions, you were practically best mates. Weasley was furious,” he added, smirking. “So well done there.”
Draco dressed in silence, watching as Potter went back to levitating the inkpot nonverbally. It was strange, how he could resume his practice as though nothing had happened. Perhaps for Potter this
“Oh, I don’t know. It’s all so confusing. I’m just glad my parents kept to themselves. This year I’m focusing on my grades and staying out of trouble.”
“Probably.” Looking to change the subject, lest they start discussing his parents, he nodded at her parchment and said, “You could just use magic to do that, you know.”
“How did you know I was here?” he asked, pulling out of Harry's arms to be able to speak to them properly. Harry didn’t seem capable of answering—he was breathless, studying Draco’s face as though he had never seen him properly before.
“You don’t need to look so nervous, Draco,” she muttered. “I’m not going to punish you like a little boy.”
“What?” Draco didn’t know how to feel. He hadn’t known Dobby very well—he had been his father’s house-elf, and mostly relegated to the kitchen—but he had been loyal to Harry. He had saved Harry’s life. “I’m…I’m really sorry.”
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Harry said softly. “To think that your parents’ only chance at getting away is this tiny, little bottle.”
“Oh, yes, Potter,” he scoffed. “Finally, you’ve uncovered my ruse.” Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to his feet, waving Potter away as he leaned forward to help. “I don’t really care much about Quidditch this year, anyway.”
“Well, how was I supposed to know!” Draco said, affronted. He drew his cloak tighter around himself and pushed on down the path—the wind had picked up. “This is so stupid.”
“Oh, is it? That’s exciting!” Granger said. “They won’t be staying in Paris, but I’m sure they’ll visit. Won’t you, Ron?”
As he unfurled his father’s note, Draco was surprised to find that the letter consisted only of two lines:
“Robins. She was a great find. McDonald, not sure if you know her…” When Draco shook his head, Potter said, “She’s good. Needs a bit of work. But she’s really keen.”
“I bet you Slughorn’s only taken that line with you,” Pansy said darkly. “Because of…you know. God, he’s a coward.”
“Draco,” he was moaning. His voice had taken on a high, breathless pitch. “Right there. Right there. Don’t stop.”
“Go on, Draco, lay down,” Harry said. He withdrew his hand and placed it on Draco’s back, gently urging him forward. Feeling very foolish—and vulnerable—Draco crawled onto the blanket. He arranged himself as comfortably as he could while Harry took his spot next to Granger.
After lunch, he had a free period, which he used to catch up on his Transfiguration homework. Delacour wasn’t going easy on them—in fact, so far she had assigned them more homework than all his other professors combined. Draco huddled in his little corner in the library, working through his notes from the previous class and trying to make sense of his poorly written diagram. As dinner rolled around, Draco packed up his things. All day, he had been nervous at the thought of having to teach his first lesson tonight. Much of his anxiety came from the fact that he had no idea what these study groups were supposed to look like. He had never taught a group of students before, let alone students who probably detested him. For all he knew, one of them would take the opportunity to hex him into oblivion. Maybe that was McGonagall’s goal.
“What are you talking about?” he asked, puzzled. “Why would I get hurt? When we finally get rid of my Mark, I’ll be
“And you ripped me apart!” Draco was shouting now. “You used that—that curse, whatever the fuck it was—I could have
“You’re getting better.” Draco jumped—though Potter spoke quietly, the sudden sound of his voice shook Draco’s concentration. And, of course, the shoes dropped out of the air.
“Out.” Madam Webb, apparently at her wits’ end, was storming down the length of the bench. “I know we’ve all enjoyed your little visit, Mr. Potter, and I’m sure Mr. Malfoy is very glad of the opportunity to see his father, but this is not for your eyes.” As she came down the stairs towards them, Harry held up his wand.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, trying to disentangle himself. But Potter pulled him forward, ignoring his complaints. They hobbled out of the forest together. This was the second time someone had helped him back to the castle in less than a month. Utterly humiliated, Draco kept his eyes to the ground, praying no one was out for a midnight stroll who might recognize them.
“Oh, Draco,” she sighed. She had a look on her face he had come to detest over the years, as though she was speaking to someone very stupid or very naïve. “Just watch yourself, alright?”
“No, I don’t,” he said lightly. “I seem to remember that you looked quite fit in your Quidditch jersey.”
“Tell me you don’t want this,” Potter breathed against his lips. “Tell me you don’t, and I’ll leave. I won’t bother you anymore. We’ll go on like nothing’s happened.”
“It’s to impress that man she’s seeing,” Blaise said. “I think they’re on the verge of ending things, thank God.”
“Oh, for God’s sake.” Draco slumped back in his chair and fiddled with his quill. “It was a dumb fight. I just told her—” He broke off, looking over at Daphne. He didn’t want her to know what the others were saying about her and Thomas. “I’m just tired of it, the whole pure-blood nonsense. The Sacred Twenty-Eight, and all that rubbish.”
“I thought you said this was all nonsense.” She opened her mouth to reply, but he cut her off: “Make something up. Or write more about Millicent. I’m sure Trelawney would love that.”
Draco stalled for as long as he could. He listened absently as Blaise rambled on about his mother, who was anxious about hosting the Christmas dinner and driving Blaise around the bend. He sat on his bed, fiddling with his cuffs as Blaise went on and on in his bored drawl, knotting his tie one way, checking the mirror, and then changing it. Running out of ways to dawdle, Draco dumped the contents of his satchel onto the bed and began to sort through his quills, setting aside the broken ones. Finally, Blaise was about to leave for breakfast, when he suddenly remembered that he needed to hand in an assignment for Astronomy. He rifled through his desk, starting up
“Get these off," Harry said, motioning to the chains wrapped around Draco's father. "This is ridiculous.”
“You two have become great friends,” Draco said sourly. “You’re getting on like you’ve been mates for years.”
“If something happens to you…if I lose you…I will completely fall apart. Do you hear me? I won't survive it. So I can’t…I have to keep some distance.”
“I haven’t. But what does it matter? Really? What difference would it make if I just decided to snog you right here?”
At that, the large doors to the Great Hall opened, and the first-year students filed in, led by Hagrid. They stopped in front of the wizened Sorting Hat, sat on its stool by McGonagall’s side.
Draco set to work counting out scarab beetles while Pansy sharpened her knife. “I diced it quite fine, before,” she said. “You think that’s alright?”
“He’ll be happy now that he’s back in his shop,” Ron said. “He’ll have a whole new group of first-years to sort out, all needing their wands.”
Although they were no longer speaking, Harry was suddenly everywhere. Draco tried to ignore the awful pang in his chest whenever they passed each other on the way to class. Although his mouth went dry and his stomach twisted during Potions class as Harry fooled around with Weasley, Draco forced himself not to look up. It was painful enough that they were ignoring each other. What made it worse was that Harry seemed to have forgotten all about him. He spoke loudly with his friends during meals, and he was as lively as ever during their study groups. One evening, when Draco had been walking the grounds alone, he saw Harry and his friends traipsing down to the Quidditch pitch. They were singing some nonsensical tune and laughing uproariously. He remembered Harry’s insistent demand that they play against each other one last time. It felt as though that night at the pub had happened in another lifetime.
He almost didn’t manage to refuse her. It was so much easier to defy his parents when he was at Hogwarts and they were safely imprisoned in the Manor. But he took a steadying breath, turned to face her, and for some strange reason thought of Daphne as he said, “That’s alright, Mother. I’m going back to Hogwarts.”
The rest of the day passed quickly. Following Transfiguration, he had Charms, and then after lunch, double Herbology. As he filed into the greenhouse along with his fellow Slytherins, Draco paused to speak with Sprout.
Draco opened the door and made to leave when Potter reached out and flattened his collar. “Thanks,” he mumbled, oddly incapable of meeting Potter’s eyes.
“Isn’t it the same thing?” Lovegood asked. She was now staring at him again, eyes wide with surprise.
“Do you see Weasley staring at us?” Zabini asked him. He didn’t look up from his cutting board. “Fucking blood traitor.”
He shrugged. “From the way my father’s been talking lately, it sounds like I’m not going to be able to rely on him financially for much longer.”
, he felt exposed. He hadn’t realized until now that the cover of the dark forest afforded him a sense of privacy. As though reading his mind, Harry murmured, “Hermione, could you turn off your light?”
They stood there, neither of them prepared to leave, taking each other in as the crickets vibrated around them. Draco’s feet were sore on the cold stone, but he didn’t dare move. He needed to commit Potter’s face to memory. As Potter studied him, he felt horribly exposed, but he relented and allowed Potter to pull him apart with his eyes. It would be his final undoing.
Draco pulled his arm away and brought his hands up to cover his face. He was really crying now, soft sobs racking his body. His chest felt hollow, as though his soul had vacated his body and might not ever return.
Draco pushed him gently, smiling. “Oh, of course. I forgot that you Gryffindors are always so noble.”
“I thought we were all signing up to be Aurors?” Zabini said drily. That earned him a round of laughter.
“Harry knows some spell,” Draco said, pulling back down his sleeve. “Granger found it. They were using it to get rid of his scar, but he stopped. It lets him go through my memories, the ones connected to the Mark. It’s not like Obliviating, though. The memories are still there. I can feel them.”
Draco blanched. He had no answer to that. And, just as his pulse had started to ease, it picked up again, his blood racing through his veins. He felt very warm. He ducked his head, certain that his embarrassment was painted all over his face.
“Draco.” Harry shifted so that their faces were mere inches apart. “I understand. I do. And I won’t make you forget it.”
“Maybe,” Granger said, but she sounded doubtful. “I’ll look into it. But anyway. This memory. Harry’s tried to erase it twice? And both times the same memory came up?”
"Fucking Potter,” he growled. “I don’t know if he thinks I owe him now, because of what happened with my—with my trial, and him saying what he said—of course they weren’t going to charge me anyway, I was a minor when it all…anyway. He’s so bloody arrogant. He came up to me and just told me to teach him nonverbal magic.”
Draco untied the parchment from Callidus’ leg and unfurled it. His stomach clenched as he saw that it was from his parents. How stupid—he had always looked forward to his parents’ letters and the treats they sent him. But he swore he could feel their misery seeping out of the parchment in his hands.
“I’ve noticed something,” Draco said. The words came out before he could stop them. “You have loads to say here, but you were quiet, the other night. At the Three Broomsticks.”
Having gone through these lines of thought—and innumerable others—Draco sometimes managed to drift off into a fitful sleep. That morning he had awoken groggy and stiff; as usual, his nightmare consisted of vague, black shadows, sharp screams, and flashes of green light. The weather outside seemed to reflect his mood: the Great Hall’s enchanted ceiling showed the sky to be overcast. He watched Pansy eat a bowl of oatmeal and listened to her prattle on about an article she had read in
“Flattery will get you nowhere. Why do you need to do a nonverbal Shield Charm, anyway? Is there some new Dark wizard out to get you that I haven’t heard of?”
“Let’s meet again tomorrow,” Harry said. He gestured towards Draco’s arm. “We should try to finish before it snows.”
Draco didn’t dare believe it. Even in the dark of the forest, it was clear that the skull and snake had turned a dark shade of grey. “It’s lighter,” he breathed. Forgetting the pain, the nausea, he sat up and stared at his arm in awe.
“It wasn’t a memory. It was…I just thought…” He swallowed thickly. “Imagine if I didn’t have to worry about my parents anymore. If they just…weren’t…here.”
Draco smiled. “Could you put in a good word for Pansy? Her parents have been on her ever since…ever since the Battle. When she said…”
“We’ve already voted,” she said. Her Patronus, a small, silver-feathered owl, was hooting angrily at them.
“It’s just a chocolate. Blaise’s mother sent them. Well, not his mother. A man she’s seeing. Blaise doesn’t like him very much.” He knew he was rambling, but he couldn’t stop. He was suddenly nervous. “That one’s treacle tart flavoured.” When Harry said nothing, he felt very stupid. “I thought you liked treacle tart. Forget about it. You don’t have to eat it.”
Although he hummed in agreement, privately, Draco didn’t mind—it was nice being outdoors. Sketching required just enough concentration that his mind didn’t wander. The breeze soothed him as it grazed across his cheeks, lifting the edges of his collar, flitting through his hair. Once, Pansy jerked her leg up violently, convinced that another bug had attacked her. But otherwise, they were undisturbed. Draco’s drawing came together quickly enough—he labeled the rounded rosette, the flowering stem, and the taproot that he imagined burrowing deep into the ground.
“We had practice right after Slytherin the other day. Ron and I were watching them for a while. They’re alright. Harper’s tough on them, but he’s…he’s alright.” A pause, and then, “I really don’t think they’ve got a chance without you, though.”
“Probably. She was furious! But she never did tell your parents, did she? She always liked you. Thought you were clever.”
The eighth-year Slytherins soon found that they had a record number of assignments to submit before the holidays. Saturday morning, they met in the library to try to work through their respective piles of homework. To Draco’s surprise, even Greg joined them—he, like Draco, was still working on the complicated paper Delacour had assigned them on Animagi. It felt strange, being with the others and acting as though everything was normal. Because it wasn’t—his life had been flipped upside-down in the best way possible. Whenever there was a lull in the conversation, Draco could think of nothing to bring up except topics revolving around Harry. It seemed very odd, that other people’s lives were going on as they always had, while his had been so permanently altered.
“Yeah.” Daphne's kindness was going to undo him; he hurried out of the library before she could say anything else. Heading for the Owlery, his heart pounded ferociously in his chest. He could hardly see the other students around him. At one point, he thought he heard someone calling him, but he didn’t turn back. What was he going to do? Harry had said not to panic. But how could he not? His father was going to be blindsided. Should he try to warn him? How would that be possible? The Ministry was checking the Manor’s post. He had written his father surreptitious letters in the past, but he doubted their mail had been so carefully scrutinized before. It would be incredibly reckless to write. If the Ministry realized what they were up to, he and his father would be in a huge amount of trouble. But what other choice did he have? If he could just warn his father, perhaps there was a small chance his lawyers could intervene. At any rate, he couldn’t just sit around and do nothing.
As Draco pulled down his pants, Potter was reaching for the lubricant. He made to take it from him when Potter swatted him away, coating his own fingers instead. Draco didn’t understand. Did he mean to—? His thoughts came to a grinding halt when he saw the dark outlines of Potter’s hand reaching down to prepare himself. Draco’s mouth went dry. He held Potter’s knees to brace himself as he watched, transfixed. Before he had quite gotten his fill, Potter grabbed his wrist and pulled him forward. Lining himself up, Draco opened his mouth to ask Potter if he was sure, if he had prepared himself sufficiently, because he was always so
He jumped when Pansy happily announced, “All done!” She folded the bit of parchment and tucked it into her bag. “Now. What did Proudfoot want?”
Draco and Harry were late to their Thursday study session. They bumped into each other on the way to the Great Hall, and Draco gave a perfunctory show of resisting before allowing Harry to pull him into an empty classroom. Pinning him against the wall, Harry kissed him so hard that Draco wondered faintly whether he was trying to stop him from breathing ever again. When they finally broke apart, their lips swollen, their faces flush, Draco made to reach for Harry again when they remembered the study group. They pulled themselves together as best they could before rushing to the Great Hall, sharing an amused look as they realized that they were the last to arrive. Pansy, Draco noticed, wasn’t there. They hadn’t spoken since their argument. Draco told himself that he didn’t care.
As he circled the pitch again, drifting lazily along the corners, he reflected on what Proudfoot had said. Regardless of the advantages seven N.E.W.T.s might provide him, there was still the undeniable fact that he felt out of place at Hogwarts. In the past, Hogwarts had been a second home to him; and, once the Dark Lord had started using the Manor as his headquarters, the castle had been a refuge. Coming into his eighth year, he had expected to be able to escape his troubles once again by returning to Hogwarts. Instead, they had followed him here. His episodes had not stopped—if anything, they were worse. And then there was Potter. Once again, as he always did, Potter had muddled everything. There were still times when Draco swore he must have dreamt everything up. It was too implausible, too surreal, to possibly be true. Never mind that his stomach clenched and his heart froze whenever he saw Potter; surely his mind was inventing all kinds of ridiculous hallucinations, perhaps to distract him from his anxiety.
Draco didn’t know where to look. At the end of the table, Weasley was glaring at him, clearly unhappy with the present arrangement. Harry, meanwhile, was as unbothered as ever, studying Draco as though he were an interesting plant they were sketching in Herbology.
Draco remembered very clearly, although he didn’t enjoy reliving the conversation. “You said you were…anxious.”
“I have no idea. Away from here. Somewhere far away, where nobody knows who I am. Where I’m something other than Lucius Malfoy’s son.” He gave a cold, bitter laugh. “God, what an idiot he is. And so am I, for following him all these years.”
They found that they agreed on most of the curriculum, although there were a few points of contention. Potter felt that nonverbal spells were probably beyond their abilities, and that they should leave those to the faculty to teach; Draco, on the other hand, refused to budge, arguing repeatedly that nonverbal spells could be the difference between Exceeds Expectations and Outstanding.
He was cut off as Potter kissed him fiercely. He kissed him back, just as angrily, wanting to hex him into tomorrow but also inexplicably needing to taste him and to feel him. When they finally broke apart, Potter’s breathing was ragged. He loosened his grip on Draco’s arms, but he still held him pressed against the wall, barely an inch of space between them. They stood like that, glowering at each other, until finally Potter said in a low voice, “I don’t want him touching you.”
Bracing himself, Draco picked up the chart. As he scanned the little rows and columns…he let out the breath he had been holding. This wasn’t too bad. In fact, he could already see the calculation coming together in his mind. Excited, he dipped his quill into his inkpot and went to work, carefully scribbling his notations above the numbers and then adding each digit in turn. It was somehow comforting to be drawn into the calculation—it was exact, precise, unchanging. So long as he knew the formula, he could wring out the meaning of the text. He finished in record time; only Granger, seated at the front, had finished before him. Had he done it correctly? Had he missed something? How could he have finished so soon? Nervous, Draco checked his work again, but he could find no mistakes. According to the large clock hanging above Vector’s head, they still had another twenty minutes to go. Unsure of what else to do with himself, Draco read over his answers several more times. He had done, he thought, rather well.
“Maybe. You saved it, though. Saved it from being turned back into a toad.” He was grinning widely now as he asked, “You think it’s better to be a mouse than a toad?”
“I never liked him,” Pansy said promptly. “I never did. God, can you imagine what Snape would say?” She was pacing now. “He would
“Oh, God.” Pansy cackled viciously. “So we’re doing Tarot cards, right? And I’m reading Millicent’s. And she pulls the King of Swords. I’m absolute rubbish at Tarot, so I just go through my textbook trying to make something up. I tell her a man will be coming into her life soon, and he’s very clever, and authoritative, and a bit brooding. And guess who she thought I meant?”
Draco forgot to be outraged. He stared at Theo, who was calmly gazing back at him. “That’s not true,” he insisted.
Potter shook his head but said nothing. He was still gripping Draco’s hips, their chests pressed together. Draco swore he could hear Potter’s heart beating in tandem with his. He felt a burning need to commit everything to memory: Potter’s bright green eyes, his jet-black hair, his parted, pink lips. His white uniform shirt, with the top three buttons undone; his tie, hanging loosely. As he looked down at Potter, it suddenly occurred to him how reckless he was being: alone, with Potter, snogging him. Surely Potter had lost his mind. He would be expelled for this, or worst. And if his parents found out…
He felt himself turning red. Packing up his things, he waited until Pansy and Blaise had left the classroom before saying, “You can’t tell anyone, Greg. I mean it.”
“Fine,” she spat. “But you’re making a horrible mistake, I hope you know. You’re always putting me in these positions where I know you’re doing the wrong thing and there’s nothing I can do about it.” And with that, she stormed off, throwing a furious look at Potter as she passed him.
Nott sat up in indignation. “They have an eighth year doing lines? We’re of age! Just stop going. What’s he going to do?”
“Surely you’re good at everything, Potter,” he said, watching as a sixth-year Hufflepuff turned her cushion from green to orange.
“I didn’t know my father,” Harry said, catching another teardrop as it trickled down Draco's cheek. “But I heard things about him. Saw things. Saw memories. And some of what he did…it was awful. He did things to Snape that…”
“I know you feel the same way. I could tell, that one time in Potions. You looked like you’d seen…like you’d seen everyone who had died come back to life. As I said, you looked the way I feel.”
He tried to focus as Harry spoke excitedly, leaning forward over the table, “We could fly together, over the holidays! You could help me practice. You’ve got your broom, haven’t you?”
Harry gripped Draco’s hips, holding him down ever so gently as he continued to kiss along his stomach. Then, suddenly, he sucked hard on the tender flesh, and Draco gasped. That would leave another mark, Draco knew, and he squirmed at the thought. He was so hard it hurt. He began to rock under Harry’s hands, begging silently for some kind of contact, some kind of friction. At last, Harry took pity on him, and he hooked his fingers around the cotton waistband. So slowly it felt like a delicious sort of torture, Harry pulled his pants down. He slipped them past Draco’s feet and then tossed them to the side.
“Theo,” Pansy asked timidly, reaching out to touch his hand. “She doesn’t…she doesn’t turn, does she? Into a…?”
“It’s freezing!” Pansy cried, rubbing her arms. “Come on, let’s get back.” She turned to Theo and wrapped him in another hug. As they said their goodbyes, Draco stood off to the side, ill at ease. He thought again about what Theo had said about Greg, and for some reason, he felt sick to his stomach. He couldn’t think about Greg without also thinking of Vincent.
“They are. I thought it all might be coming to a head, and that it would ease once my Mark was gone. But if we can’t erase it, then…”
him like this. Not when the Mark was already fading. Potter held his gaze for a moment, frowning, and then strode out of the classroom.
Theo pulled back his sleeve and checked his watch. “We’d better be going, Draco. Our appointment’s coming up. I told Greg we’d meet him at the Ministry, before Flooing in.”
“Ha, ha,” he said drily. Harry chuckled. “That’s what happened, though. Slughorn asked me what my plans were…told me to be practical, you know, since I’m Lucius Malfoy’s son…and I couldn’t really think of anything. So Proudfoot told me I’d be teaching lessons with you.”
“Keep still,” Draco muttered, coming to rest his hands on Harry’s head. He did as he was told, eyes fluttering shut as Draco rocked in and out, in and out. The salty taste of pre-cum was on his tongue. Slowly, Harry brought his lips to close around Draco’s cock, humming in satisfaction when Draco inhaled sharply. He kept his head as still as he could as Draco quickened his pace, thrusting into Harry’s mouth as he threaded his fingers through his hair.
Kreacher settled into a deep bow, his nose nearly touching the floor. “Come, please, come sit, Master Harry, your favourite spot…”
. Abruptly, Harry pulled away and came back up to kiss him. His cheeks were pink, his mouth red and glistening.
“It was good of McGonagall to set up the internship program, but I think we would have been fine, anyway,” said Boot. “Surely facing Voldemort and his Death Eaters has given us some kind of credentials?” As the others laughed, Boot grinned and was about to take a swig of his firewhisky when he caught sight of Draco. He blanched. “I mean, of course—grades matter, too, don’t they—and we didn’t all—we all had different, different situations, didn’t we—so it’s not everything—”
“It was the Chocolate Frog card!” Daphne said. “I was up late, I couldn’t sleep…it’s been bothering me, thinking about what the others said, about Dean…so I was up sorting my Chocolate Frog cards, when the Harry Potter card started waving at me! Jumping in the frame, flapping his arms everywhere, it was actually quite funny…and the portraits in the cards can’t speak, you know, but I realized he was mouthing something to me: your name!”
As Harry took Draco’s arm and pushed up his sleeve, he said, “We had Quidditch practice after dinner. It was awful.”
“Put down your quills,” Vector’s voice finally came. She raised her wand and fifteen pages of parchment swooped towards her desk; Abbott, who had still been writing, gave a little cry as her chart snuck out from under her quill. “Now, please open your textbooks and turn to page fifty-five. Today, we’ll be discussing…”
“There’s no need to thank me, Weasley,” Draco said, finally collecting himself. “I…care about Harry, even if doesn’t always seem like it.”
you’re just going to do whatever Malfoy’s going to do for winter break? It won’t be the same without you at the Burrow…”
He liked learning as a child - it made his parents proud even though he always failed to surpass Granger in school. He didn’t like it as much now, just as he didn’t like much of the things he used to. He still had a knack for it, however, and thank Merlin for that.
Draco had left shortly after that, pulling on his clothes and saying that he had work the next morning. Harry watched him go, then laid in bed and stared up at the ceiling, his head still spinning from all that had happened.
Johnny tightly rolled a five-pound note and bent over the table. Harry watched as he snorted one of the four lines quickly, straightening his back and tilting his head up.
“Well. It’s hardly surprising,” Draco said after a moment. “Change in professors can only do so much.”
“Recovery is not a linear process,” Hermione recited immediately, her expression serious. “Even if it seems like we’re doing ‘well,’ we have our off-days, Harry. I’m sure you know that. I mean, by the way I snapped at you earlier…you know that. You can vent to us anytime. You don’t have to worry about us.”
Draco handed it to Potter, who took it hesitantly. He looked at the card, his expression unreadable, before glancing back up at Draco.
“I knew we should’ve gone shopping yesterday,” Ginny grumbling, getting up from her spot on the floor. She looked down at Harry, her hands on her hips. “D’you want take-out? I can go pick up.”
“I was puzzled, as I think anyone would be, and asked him why he was lurking about and following me. He said he needed a distraction.” Draco frowned at this. “So I took his to the lounge and made him tea.”
“So you see,” Draco continued, “I don’t care. I can’t, truthfully, but when I look at these,” he ran his hand over his bare chest, “I try to see them as old marks. I try not to dwell on the past. I’ve spent too long doing that, so I just…move on.”
“Please? Even if it’s completely horrible it’ll be progress, right? The beginning of tolerance?” He nudged Draco gently. “Right?”
She was wonderful, though. She’d try to cheer him up, she’d try to distract him, and she’d soothe him when he woke up screaming – and this happened more often than not. She’d try to get him outside, to get him talking to people, talking to Teddy. She’d calm him down when he had panic attacks, when he’d get headaches and fear Voldemort was coming back again.
Harry was struggling to stay upright; the stabbing pains in the back of his head also made it hard to focus.
Malfoy pressed his warm body up against Harry, his scent overpowering Harry’s senses. Harry grasped at Malfoy’s arse as he slowly began to stroke up and down. Malfoy picked up the pace, continuing to move his hand in varying motions and speeds, incredibly perceptive to what Harry liked best. Harry quivered at Malfoy’s touch, overwhelmed by just how
But their friends were still firmly in the dislike camp, while they attempted to play nice for the sakes of Harry and Draco.
He hated playing the part of the blushing virgin, but how could he be something he wasn’t? He wished he was experienced so he could go along with Harry and not feel so out of his depth. But more importantly, he wished he didn’t hate how he looked underneath his clothing.
Harry gave a horrible grin and wiped his forehead again, rushed Draco, and put his sweaty hands all over Draco's face.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and cleared his throat. He glanced over at Draco (his face impassive as always) before addressing the group. “I’ve been doing really well lately. It’s er – been a good week.”
“No, you won’t!” Draco finally exploded, turning to glare at Potter. “I can’t release you in good faith. You have an
“That’s rich, coming from the biggest fucking git I know.” Harry stood up, the chair making a harsh squeaking noise against the floor.
Draco didn’t know what was happening. If Harry didn’t approve, wouldn’t he just tell him instead of asking all these questions and beating around the bush?
Draco came in Harry with a deep moan; white spots filled his vision. He’d never experienced anything so powerful, so strong, so
“Leave?” Malfoy repeated incredulously. “You need to stay here for two days at the very least, so we can finish treating you. Potter, I don’t think you understand how grave this situation is.”
“Hello, Cait,” Malfoy said smoothly. He looked over her head, peering into the crowd. “Where are the others?”
“No, I’m fine,” Harry told her again, guilt blooming inside of him. He focused on maintaining eye contact with Ginny, who still seemed skeptical. “Really.”
But it was none of those things. There was surprise, yes, but Draco couldn’t detect anything remotely negative in his expression.
Draco watched as Harry’s eyes opened, and as he turned toward Draco and propped himself up on his elbow.
“But it wasn’t ideal. I know that. I can say that and believe it, because I know they really disliked me…I know they weren’t the best caregivers, and I know that locking me in a cupboard for ten years wasn’t right. But they took me out eventually. They gave me a room and food when it wasn’t too much trouble, when
Draco scoffed to himself as he opened the door into his bedroom. He shared the room with Blaise, thank Salazar, who was as neat and organized as they came. He also kept to himself, caring more about his own affairs than anyone else’s, which was certainly useful for Draco.
“Whatever,” Draco scowled. He crossed his arms. “And what are we doing, anyway? You know I don’t eat anymore,” he said in what he hoped was an offhand manner, his voice wavering only slightly.
“I can cast a Disillusionment charm on you so you don’t draw any unwanted attention. Do you consent to me doing so?”
That was it? It was a bit anticlimactic, but Draco decided to accept it. Maybe he did feel a bit bad after all. He assumed it was normal for straight people to be curious about homosexuality, though he certainly wasn’t an expert and couldn’t be certain. But still, he couldn’t get mad at Harry for that.
He’d walked over to the mirror that hung on Draco’s closet, the one he spent hours agonizing in front of. He frowned at it.
“And this collection,” Draco said, kneeling to examine the disorderly stacks of tapes shoved into the cabinet, “Is pitiful.”
Once he had gotten over the initial shock, Draco hurried over to the shocking sight. Trainee Healer Bethia Burke and Healer Leonel Estrada were running the stretcher and casting diagnostic spells.
Draco put on his clothes carefully and combed his hair. It was good enough, he thought as he examined himself in the mirror. As good as it was going to get, anyway.
Draco considered it. He was already feeling the effects of the punch – it was clearly stronger than it tasted. He really wasn’t planning on getting completely sloshed, but then he thought, why not? It’s not like he had classes tomorrow. He’d just be staying in the castle during Christmas, unable to face his mother and the Manor. With his father in prison, his mother was beside herself, a mere ghost of the woman she once was. Draco knew that he wouldn’t help any by showing up looking what he did.
Kathy went on to the next person, and Harry tried to pay attention but his mind kept replaying what Draco had said.
“The majority of patients that come through my department are poisoned, which tends to affect their moods. Others recognize my name and treat me accordingly. And some fall into both categories.”
A chill ran through his entire body when Potter said his first name. He tried to focus on the context in which he’d said the word instead of the word itself.
Draco dropped his eyes down to his food, their exchange once again reminding Draco just how much Potter’s situation was impacting everyone close to him.
Thankfully, when Potter spoke again, he didn’t sound angry. Just tired. “I thought you weren’t meant to be my Healer anymore.”
“No, this is good. It will be easier to have him drink the Clearing Potion than having to force it down.”
He felt Harry come closer, his body heat coming off him in waves. Draco shuddered, remembering how Harry was his own personal furnace during the cold nights. He would have to get used to sleeping alone again.
“You did what you did because the situation was forced upon you,” Ira argued. “You didn’t hunt Mr. Potter down and demand that he join you for a mid-morning coffee date. You listened to what he was saying and helped him out. Sure, the outcome may have been a bit different if it wasn’t Mr. Potter, but I don’t think your actions were out of bounds. Not by a long shot.”
“That’s the second time you’ve called me sweet,” Potter’s voice said, sounding both smug and bewildered.
He flipped it open to his favorite picture of his parents – the one of them dancing. Harry stared hard at it, blinking back tears, and studied it for the thousandth time. They’d been so young,
“Shut up,” Draco hissed, anger and embarrassment boiling up within him. “You know I’m not above using hexes on you.”
It was bright. That was his first impression. His second was that the room was quite small, especially for the amount of people that was crammed into it. Most of them were already sitting down, making small talk with those around them. Others were standing around a plain, rectangular table that was topped with a box of donuts, Styrofoam cups, and a rather outdated coffee maker.
Draco leant against the doorway leading from the entry hall into the living room. He didn’t even try to look.
“Hey, Hermione,” Harry grinned sheepishly. He picked up his shirt off the floor and pulled it on. “Sorry. It was, er, hot. Hi, Rose.”
“It might’ve been, in the past,” Draco said, “But with our family outed as the slimy, Dark house that we are, I’ve had to find other means. Not to say we’re bankrupt, but I certainly can’t depend on lying on my arse anymore.”
After wallowing for a few more minutes, Draco drew the curtain back and got out of bed. He glanced around the room. Blaise had already left for home, it seemed, and Draco had the room to himself. Gathering a fresh jumper and a pair of trousers, he left for the bathroom.
“Go,” Draco said before Potter could say anything. “You should return to your friends. Wouldn’t want to be found out here with me.”
“All these tricks up your sleeve,” Draco murmured. He pulled Harry back down again. “You really are sneaky.”
Potter’s arms were crossed in front of his chest defensively. "I'm sorry too. You told me to leave you alone and I didn't. I should have respected your boundaries."
“So let me get this straight. You jerked off a wizard in a loo. The wizard in question is someone who just happens to go to the
"God yes Draco harder please," Harry was only half-aware of what he was saying but that didn't stop him. Draco's cock was thick and warm and filled him up so completely -
Draco’s grey eyes flickered to where Kreacher had stood before they went back to his soup. He swallowed another spoonful before answering.
“Alright,” said Harry, up for the challenge. He counted them off on his fingers. “He’s rude, arrogant, patronizing, dismissive – and he was a prejudiced wanker ‘till just a few years ago.”
Her hand hovered over the place she kept her wand. Draco worried that she wasn’t sober enough to be able to wield it properly – not that there would be any need for that.
“Oh.” Potter’s eyebrows scrunched together in thought. After a moment, he said, “I’ll go there. It’ll – er, be a nice change of pace.”
“I died,” Harry said simply. He turned back around; his voice was scratchy and his eyes were sullen as he stared at Draco. “When Voldemort hit me with the killing curse in the forest, I died. I saw Dumbledore, and he told me I could go on or go back.”
It didn’t feel real. After all these years of harboring a secret affection, something had come of it. Harry returned these feelings. Draco couldn’t understand why; he wanted so badly to ask
Draco made an undistinguished sound and tried to escape, but it was no use. Harry was an inch or two shorter than him, but was built much stronger than Draco was, rendering Draco useless in a physical fight.
Harry shrugged when Cait looked at him. “I got too ambitious. Anyway, I’ve really got to get home, I’m knackered…”
Draco flushed as Harry raised his trembling hand to touch Draco’s face gingerly, that expression of awe still on his face.
. It is my job to look after your health and to help you. There’s a reason I’m head of this ward, and there’s a reason I’ve been assigned to you. I have an extensive knowledge of potions and poisons, and –“
“Alright. Just send us an owl when you’re ready for us to visit. No rush, Harry,” she added quickly.
Malfoy stepped back so Ginny could enter the room, and with a final nod, he left and closed the door behind him.
Draco began thrusting slowly, his cock tight and warm, and placed his hands on Harry’s arse, taking hold of him. Harry shuddered underneath him.
“I won’t buy any more drinks or potions, and I’ll bin the ones I have at home. If you don’t believe me, you can come over and do it yourselves,” Harry replied.
Draco’s throat was dry. “Well, I’m not shagging anyone.” When Potter looked over at him sharply, Draco amended, “I mean – I’m not busy. I can listen.” He was at least twelve hundred percent sure his face had turned pink again given the burning sensation on his cheeks. Potter was still staring at him, and Draco finished weakly, “If you want me to.”
“Yeah, like you’d care about being impolite,” grumbled Harry, and before Draco could respond, he loudly shushed him. “It’s starting!”
“I’m sorry.” His voice was quiet, but his words were firm. “I couldn’t have been more wrong about your childhood. I feel terrible.”
“Alright,” she said and approached him. “This is the Fever-Reducing Potion, and it’s rather self-explanatory.”
Draco picked up the pace after this, driving in deeper with every thrust. The slap of flesh on flesh and panting filled the otherwise silent room, and Harry closed his eyes again and relished the sound. He was achingly hard but was avoiding touching his own cock, wanting to enjoy this as long as possible.
"Thank you," Harry said, and Kreacher bowed and excused himself. He turned to Draco, his face growing warm. "Hey."
“You also seemed to get the wrong impression from me,” Draco said hesitantly. His change in tone made Potter look him in the eye again, his expression a little less hard. “I don’t – well, that is to say, I –”
“Just, y’know, for being my mate,” Harry explained. “For understanding and being nice and cool an’ all that…”
did not mean to say that. Nothing good came out of being vulnerable, and he would never forget what had happened when he’d originally asked Potter for his friendship. And sure, he might have come to the conclusion that they were friends, but he’d never acknowledged it out loud. He was too scared to.
They had an unspoken truce: neither would mention what had happened this morning. Harry would say no more about wanting Draco to eat.
He shouldn’t have sat up so fast. Harry pressed his palm to his forehead and shut his eyes, trying to distract himself from the lightheadedness.
He avoided eye contact with the two of them, silently cursing himself for his stupidity and the way alcohol made him forget himself. It was obvious, however, that Betty and Leo would not be ignoring everything he’d just said, and Draco briefly considered Obliviating them.
They were sat in the eighth year Common Room again, lounging by the fireplace. The quiet voices of Macmillan and Abbott and the crackling fire were the only other sounds in the room, and Draco was unsettled by it. He wondered what wild theories the two Hufflepuffs were coming up with about him and Potter.
It was strange how disappointed Draco felt at those words. He tried to not let it show on his face, tried to keep it as impassive as possible. There was a sinking feeling in his chest as he watched Potter stand up and walk over to the door. Potter hesitated and turned.
He thought about Malfoy's words. That Estrada liked to be professional, but he would open up if prompted to. Harry knew he
The best of it was that Harry would never even find out. There was no evidence – all he would think was that Draco was also in his dormitory preparing for Blaise's return.
He felt horror and shock and disgust wash over him, like all his emotions had just been stuck behind some wall but the dam broke and he was finally absorbing it all – the numbness was gone and in its place was all these emotions, painfully visceral and overwhelming. And now, finally, he realized just how much he’d fucked up, just how
I'm so so so sorry, so much shit happening right now and also that pesky ol' depression is acting up again. But here's the chapter at long last! Hint: still don't know what I'm doing or where I'm headed. Thanks for being so endlessly patient.
Harry laid back down, relaxing at Malfoy’s reassurance but still unhappy with the situation. The last thing he’d need right now was for Rita bloody Skeeter to catch wind of this whole thing.
As soon as Harry had arrived back to his flat, he’d yelled out Ginny’s name. She looked up from where she was lounging on the sofa, apparently watching telly and helping herself to Harry’s biscuits.
your recovery is more important,” Draco said. “You’ve got to figure out who you are as a person again without the drugs. Any new relationship would be a distraction from staying sober, or worse, a substitute for the drugs, that is to say, something to be dependent on. It would mean a greater risk of relapse in the case things go wrong in the relationship.”
There was a dip in the bed as Ginny sat down, her hand still on Harry’s shoulder. He opened his eyes and turned to look at her.
to know what went on in his mind, least of all Malfoy. It was strange enough spilling his long-kept secrets to a virtual stranger.
“Oh.” Potter blinked. He looked at Draco curiously. “I, er, wasn’t thinking about that. I didn’t think you would.”
Harry woke up on Monday morning filled with nervous excitement. His stomach felt dangerously unsteady and his brain was buzzing with anxiety.
Draco then fished through the bottom drawer of his desk for one of Healer Wolff’s business cards – simple little things with a framed Wolff smiling solemnly on them. He held it in his hands, frowning down at the black-and-white Wolff.
. Draco put his back against the wall and looked up at the ceiling, afraid of what he would say or do if he kept staring at Harry.
Draco turned in the corridor outside Gryffindor tower, already on edge simply after hearing that voice. He met the firm gaze of Ron Weasley, who stood just outside the portrait hole in his pajamas, and shoved his hands in his pockets, afraid of a repeat of their last encounter.
The fact that there weren’t any for Wizards was a major shortcoming of Wizarding society, Harry thought. Along with the lack of the Internet, and ballpoint pens, and probably hundreds of other Muggle inventions. Someday he’d have to make a list of all the things the Wizarding world was missing out on.
“Fascinating,” Ginny murmured. “Dad would love this stuff. Not the drugs, the labels. It’s like a different language.”
Splashing his face with cold water, he rid the images from his mind and tried to relieve himself of the guilt. Did they think he
“Right,” Potter said, glancing nervously into the Room. “Er, thanks, Malfoy. For talking with me about this.”
Tears formed and fell down his face now, and Harry couldn't hold it back anymore. He let out a shuddering breath and his entire body shook with the force of his crying. Ginny kept rubbing his back and staying things like "it's alright" and "let it out."
With a sigh, he finished changing into the white hospital robes. If anyone saw him now, there’d be no doubt he was a patient here at St. Mungo’s. Hopefully the staff could keep their promises and keep his being here private.
“There,” she said severely once it was fitted snugly in a top shelf, “Now you won’t forget where it is to be returned.”
“I dunno,” Potter said, and he bit his lip. “I mean, I just wanted to thank you. Properly. It, er, was nice to get that all of my chest.”
“So that’s what I propose our team to do immediately.” Leonel glanced at Draco and the others, who nodded. Reassured, Leonel went on, shifting his attention back to Granger and Weasley. “Cleansing is a fairly easy process, though it must be done over a span of several days and can be painful at times. Of course, we’ll do our best to make it as painless as possible.”
He moved their hands so Harry’s hand was turned up over Draco’s lap. Draco examined the back of Harry’s hand, ignoring Harry’s soft
It was just a silly infatuation, wasn’t it? Hogwarts was a long time ago and he didn’t even know the man who was in front of him now. They’d both changed in the past seven years. It was obvious.
Draco looked him up and down; he didn’t seem to be doing poorly, rather, he looked the same as ever.
“As well as it could’ve gone,” Harry said with a frown. “They weren’t happy to find out you spent the night – and right under their noses, too - but really, it’s none of their business. I don’t go around demanding to know when
“Merlin, you’re so pretty, Draco,” Harry said, eyes bright as he sat up fully and moved closer. He continued talking in a breathy voice that went straight to Draco’s cock. “You’re so beautiful, it kills me every time I see you, I still can’t believe how fucking beautiful you are…”
“I’ll check up on your vitals and we’ll see if it’s improved,” Malfoy informed him as he drew his wand.
He did so, savoring the way the hot water pounded on his knotted shoulders. He exited his bathroom after clothing himself, pushing his damp hair out of his face as he made his way to the kitchen. His one-bedroom flat was certainly different than his childhood home, but he liked it very much. It’d become home after all these years, and Merlin knew Draco needed a new one.
“Yeah,” he managed to say despite the lump in his throat. Wanting to move away from the topic, he asked Hermione, “You told Ginny?”
Harry’s arm twitched like he wanted to reach out and save the pills from falling, but he restrained himself by crossing his arms across his chest. He watched as she binned the empty container, picked up a new one, opened it, and dumped its contents. She repeated these movements until she’d finished with all of them.
“Oh, wonderful! It’s called the four-seven-eight breathing exercise,” Kathy reminded kindly. “Anyone else?”
“Budge over, you traitor,” Harry grumbled. He nodded his head at the CSI rerun playing on the TV. “Is this what was so important you had to leave me alone with Malfoy?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. His body radiated warmth. “Invisibility Cloak. Now you know one of the secrets to my success.”
"Do you think anyone cares? I've been ostracized from the Wizarding world, and for good reason. No one trusts me - no one should. When you first walked into group, I thought you'd go somewhere, tell someone about me, make me the laughing stock again. Honestly, I don't even know why you've even talked to me, let alone - let alone..."
“What?” Draco snapped, though he had no right to. He felt his face warm but he tilted his chin up defensively all the same.
He didn’t know how long he sat there, not entirely present in the world, before someone came and sat down next to him. Draco turned his head to face Harry, who was worrying his lip.
“You don’t look so good.” His dark eyes were compassionate, his tone suddenly softer, and Draco was once again reminded why Leonel made such a good Healer. “You can still talk to me, Draco.”
A few minutes later, the wave had passed and Harry was left panting and sweating even more than he had been before. This one had lasted longer than his previous ones, he noted, and as a result, he felt even more exhausted than usual. His heartbeat was pounding, loud and forceful throughout his entire body.
He kissed Draco then, gently, holding his breath (for some reason). They kissed for a while, and it was slow, calm, and soft. It made Harry feel lightheaded as usual, and every sensation, every sound, every flick of Draco’s tongue just made Harry drift farther away from earth. Draco was intoxicating – there really wasn’t any other word for it.
“I don’t…is this some sort of strange exercise, Potter? Am I meant to look at this until I feel like eating again?”
Harry helped Draco hang up his clothes in his closet. When they finished, they stood back and admired their work.
Pansy frowned at him, while Daphne just seemed to be waiting for them to leave so she could continue on with her conversation.
He flung an arm around Samuel, who wasn’t quite so intoxicated, but was definitely feeling the effect of alcohol in his blood.
“Don’t look like that, Malfoy. You think I want you to be miserable?” Draco shook his head hollowly, and Potter continued in a matter-of-fact tone. “You’re right, you had to make hard choices – but in my eyes, you’ve already paid the price several times over. I mean you’re a bloody Healer now. And I won’t forget that you saved my life.”
“It does.” The smile looked more natural now. Harry reached over to touch the scarf; Draco shivered despite himself. “This is the closest we’ll ever get to a Gryffindor Draco Malfoy.”
“Is there perhaps a place where the two of you could meet in the middle? Someplace that reminds her of your old life together, and someplace that doesn’t hold such negative memories for you?”
“Oh Ron, we should have done something,” Granger said desperately. “We should have gotten him help before this happened – we could have stopped it! We’re so awful and careless…how could we have let this happen?”
“Horcrux?” Draco asked, pausing in his tracing. In all his years of living in the Wizarding world, he had never heard the term.
“Time isn’t real, nothing matters, etcetera,” Ira waved their hands. “Come on, Leonel, Draco. Live a little. It’s been ages since we’ve gone out together, and Betty’s never been.”
Draco stuck his arm out, and as Potter looked at it, Draco wondered if he, too, thought back to what happened all those years ago. Potter smiled, an actual toothy smile, and shook Draco’s hand.
And was Draco thinking the same thing about him? Was he wondering why the great Harry Potter wasn't doing anything with his life except attending a Muggle group to whine about his woes? Or why he was confiding to a bunch of strangers who didn't know him as Harry Potter but instead as Harry, even though he had a wealth of friends who actually knew about magic?
Oh. The Fidelius charm. Harry took Draco’s arm again and they walked towards 12 Grimmauld Place. When Harry reached the first step, the earth began to tremble.
“What, this?” Draco asked innocently, betrayed only by his wicked smirk and the fact that he had grasped Harry’s cock through his pants.
He got flashbacks to fifth year when she’d preformed that horrible Bat Bogey Hex on him. Draco cleared his throat.
Draco rolled his eyes but stepped back, allowing Harry to come inside. Draco shut the door behind him, and before he even knew what was happening, Harry had wrapped him in a big hug.
Ginny grabbed his face a touch too forcefully than he would've liked and made him look at her. Her eyes were harsh and cold.
Draco bit his tongue, not wanting to say anything embarrassing but Merlin it was hard, it was so hard when everything felt so
He took Draco’s hand and led him into his bedroom through the dark. He climbed into bed first, then beckoned Draco to join him. Draco made quick work of undressing Harry, pausing only to press hot kisses onto his newly bare skin. Soon, Harry was naked while Draco was still fully clothed.
,” Draco murmured in a voice that went straight to Harry’s cock, and Harry let out a breathy laugh. He stopped. “What?”
Potter laughed, and he could feel Astoria rolling her eyes at the both of them. Draco smiled softly, feeling warmth spread through him that might not have wholly been from the alcohol.
“Why am I dating a complete idiot?” Draco murmured to himself, pulling Harry close. When Harry opened his mouth to argue, Draco added, “You don’t need to answer that.”
His cheeks had swollen noticeably, emphasizing his smile lines. Red splotches and lines surrounded his eyes and crawled from his temples down to his jawline. The redness stood out against his sickly pale skin. Heavy bags sat beneath his tired eyes. All this combined and the effect was shocking. He hadn't seen himself look this bad in ages.
He lifted himself off Harry and went to sit on the bed; Harry climbed onto it fully. He pulled the curtains closed before they resumed kissing, Draco’s heart thudding and cock pushing against his trousers.
. “Remember when you beat my face in after that match in fifth year? As if kicking my arse in Quidditch wasn’t enough, you had to
“Let’s just keep walking. Sorry,” Harry apologized again and resumed walking without waiting for Draco.
Mildly intrigued, Draco watched the back of Potter’s head for a good minute before turning his attention to his Transfiguration professor.
And the anxiety. His chest was so tight it hurt, and his heart was constantly pounding, loud and fast in his ears. Everything’d been making him jump lately and he’d had his first full-blown panic attack for the first time in a while yesterday.
They spent another forty-five minutes talking, people going around at random to talk about their week.
"It means, Potter," Draco said, his voice as calm as Harry's was volatile, "That you haven't examined the pain inside you. You haven't looked at the cause of it to actually begin healing - you just look for temporary ways to cover it up."
Harry shoved them in his mouth before he could talk himself out of it, dry-swallowed, put the bag back into the pocket of his jeans, and Apparated back home.
“Perfect,” Harry said before kissing him sloppily. He cuddled up next to him, pushing his sticky body against Draco’s own. “It was brilliant. No one’s ever done that to me before.”
Potter was silent. Draco wondered belatedly if this had been a bad idea, but then he remembered that the idiot had
Harry, however, seemed completely unconcerned and had already started on his plate. When he noticed Draco wasn’t eating, however, he stopped chewing and poked his fork towards Draco’s own plate of food.
“There’s still time. We’ve got two and a half weeks left of term, which is plenty of time to do thorough research, organize our notes, and write a
They left the restaurant shortly after and hovered outside the door, looking at each other uncertainly. Harry’s heart hammered a distracting beat as he tried to think of what to say, a difficult feat with the way Draco was watching him.
He remembered how his panic had resumed as soon as he’d gotten back to his room, and how he spent a good fifteen minutes trying to remember how to breathe. He stayed in there until Pansy and Blaise had come to drag him out to lunch. That was a day ago, and Draco still wasn’t sure what to make of the whole exchange.
“You look good, Harry,” she said kindly, “And I see you’ve finally gotten out of that hospital gown.”
“Merlin, Draco,” said Ira tiredly. “At this rate I should start charging you. Do you think I’d be suited for a career change? Mind Healer White. How’s that sound?”
Draco breathed on Harry’s ear, the ghost of a nibble making him shudder with want, but Draco stepped away, a smirk on his face.
much. And I’ve found out a lot of things out from articles.” At Harry’s wary look, Estrada conceded, “Which I know aren’t always factual, but it’s still something. You-Know-Who was never that big of a deal in the U.S., but we still heard about major events. Y’know, like…”
He was brought out of his thoughts by Blaise’s murmurs and Ginevra’s laughs. Draco watched them for a moment, feeling achingly single and alone. He cleared his throat.
that word – by fifth year,” Draco admitted. Harry’s mouth opened, halfway between a gasp and a smile. The weight of his chest lifted just a bit. Draco looked away; his face felt hot. “I told you it was embarrassing.”
“Hermione’s lectured me about consent one too many times,” Harry explained, a shy smile on his face. “We aren’t thinking clearly. We should be sober.”
“Very well,” Malfoy said, drawing closer. He seemed surprised, perhaps even curious. “What did you want to discuss with me?”
Harry licked his lips. Malfoy’s eyes darted down to them, the pink tinge of his face becoming more pronounced. And then, even though his mind screamed not to, he moved closer. Malfoy’s eyes snapped back to Harry’s own, but Harry kept walking. With his body on autopilot, he finally came face-to-face with Malfoy.
He didn’t pull down his sleeves like Harry expected him to, but instead left his forearms on display. Harry had trouble keeping his gaze away. It was so beautiful, how something so pure and elegant could come from something so evil. He’d never seen anything like it before. He itched to touch it, to touch Malfoy, but he was sure he’d get cursed if he even tried.
“That’s cute,” Astoria smirked. She finished her eggnog, then eyed Draco’s punch. “You done? I’m going to get more.”
He met Harry’s gaze, steady and warm. Harry leant in to kiss him, slowly, savoring the feel and taste of Draco, and the way Draco kissed back almost carefully.
He looked up at Potter, and he found his gaze dropping to Potter’s lips. They were full but chapped. Draco wondered what Potter would taste like.
“You’re anything but,” Draco agreed, though this didn’t do much to assuage Harry. He sighed. “You really don’t feel that we’d be moving too fast?”
ed her own hair with disastrous results. Draco’s mind drifted. Just half a year ago, they were in a war. People had
“Mmmph,” Harry said, then pulled away. His glasses were askew, and Draco still had his hands up his shirt, unwilling to let go. “We’re right in front of the window, Draco.”
"Benzos, cannabis, and ecstasy," he choked out, staring hard at his hands. "They were from people I just met in clubs before they turned into, er..."
“No, that’s not – you don’t need to do that. It was nothing.” Harry tried a smile. “Let’s just drop it.”
Harry blinked, surprised by Draco's authenticity. It seemed to be authentic, anyway, by the way his eyes were earnest and how his eyebrows were pinched together in a sad sort of way. His voice was low and calming, running over Harry's rough edges and smoothing them down.
Harry clamped his mouth shut and looked away, his eyes burning. He was ashamed of himself, for getting himself in this situation again for the thousandth time for having to see Ginny like this to know he made Ginny feel this way to know he’d fucked up
"Are you sure there's nothing else bothering you, Harry? What made you want to drink in the first place?"
Harry pondered the question. “I used to do accidental magic all the time when I was a kid. But I hadn’t done it in a while before, well…”
“Hey, Harry, I know it’s a Wednesday night, but I wanted to know if you’d be interested in having a few drinks,” Damien said uncertainly, “Y’know, for Sam’s birthday.”
Leo lowered Draco’s pants and stroked the length of Draco’s cock, making him gasp sharply and bite Leo’s bottom lip in retaliation. Leonel pulled back, his chest heaving as he looked Draco up and down.
Draco almost felt grateful to his attacker, in a way, because it’d gotten Potter to talk to him again.
Draco shucked his shirt off aggressively, tossing it to the side, and crawled on his hands and knees on top of Harry. Harry's breaths were short as he looked up at Draco, wondering what would happen next. Draco lowered his hips and straddled Harry, startling a gasp out of him when he felt just how hard Draco was. This made Draco smirk, his hair falling in his eyes as he did so.
Draco was just about to tell him he missed him too when they heard voices from down the corridor. The two leapt apart from each other, Draco accidentally banging his elbow into the scratchy wall. He winced and rubbed at it as they turned to see who it was. When they realized it was just a trio of younger Hufflepuffs, they deflated with relief.
“Ok,” Draco murmured. He withdrew his fingers and slowly slid his cock in Harry – had Draco ever experienced something so
“If you want to,” Draco said. He took a deep breath and looked away, his eyes hard. “I’m sorry. I don’t know how to talk about this. It’s your choice.”
noise and rolled over onto his side, knocking Potter’s hand away. When his body lurched violently the second time, Draco began panicking and sat up quickly, ignoring the fiercely spinning room.
And the sight of a sleep-deprived Malfoy in a tight, white button-up with the top two buttons undone was one he wouldn't be forgetting soon. It had allowed Harry a peak at Malfoy’s collarbone and the smooth skin underneath.
Unlocking the stall door, he walked out and went for the closest sink to clean himself up. He first washed his hands with soap and water before rinsing his mouth and face. He turned the tap off and stared at his own reflection. The blood vessels around his eyes were popped, leaving unsightly red squiggles that stood out against his pale skin.
He had gotten used to the noisy crunches of Potter eating the apple, so when they stopped, Draco was pulled out of his thoughts.
But then he figured it was only a matter of time before Potter went back to ignoring him. It was too good to be true, really; Potter wasn’t meant to be socializing with someone like him.
“Right,” Harry said, getting Draco’s attention. He was wearing that black hoodie Draco loved so much, and those Muggle inventions called jeans. His hair was slightly tamer than before, though that didn’t exactly mean tame. The large love bite Draco had given him the night before was fairly noticeable. “Breakfast?”
“It won’t,” she said immediately, her tone suddenly defensive. She sighed and ran a hand through her long hair. “Look, Malfoy, I know what’s upsetting him, but it won’t get in the way of him getting better. I’ll make damn sure of that.”
“Harry, I...” he tried to organize his thoughts but his mind was too cloudy. “How do you even...I mean, you didn’t even know you liked men until two days ago.”
It didn’t work and he ended up wanking hard, desperately, his eyes shut tight until he came with a cry.
“Merlin, Harry, you’re…” He couldn’t even finish; he didn’t think he could sum up exactly what Harry was in a word.
“You wouldn’t,” said Harry, grinning at her before walking over to the window. He pulled it open and let Malfoy’s owl hop inside gracefully. Untying the scroll of parchment from its leg, Harry told Ginny, “It’s from Malfoy.”
“Thank you, Sir, but I’m afraid it’s mostly Draco who does the actual potion-making,” said Harry, nodding at Draco. “I just help when I can.”
Something about the sincerity in Estrada’s voice stopped Harry from arguing even more. The anger was slowly draining from his body and mind, and soon all that was left was the sickening pounding of his heart and the trembling in his hands.
Draco broke eye contact with Hermione to glare daggers at Harry and finally scramble into a sitting position, his pale, scarred chest and marked arm in full view.
The giant knot that had been in his chest since he woke up hadn’t ceased by the time the game was due to start. It took him a while to force himself out of bed, but he was here now.
Draco whispered something, and then Harry heard the click of a cap opening. He looked back then, at Draco rubbing lube over his erect cock and hands, such nice hands and long fingers, Harry thought dazedly.
Harry took off his glasses to rub at his eyes. He dragged his hands roughly down his whole face and knelt forward, still covering his face with his hands. Why did he suddenly feel like crying? Why had he been so angry just a moment before? Even Harry himself couldn’t keep up with his mood swings. He felt like he didn’t have control over himself – he was just watching as his body said or did things, detached from himself entirely.
Draco woke the next morning disoriented, feeling unsettled for whatever reason. It only took a few moments for him to remember that it was because of the awful text message he’d sent Potter. He lay in bed a few moments, wishing that he’d never sent the stupid text in the first place. He’d never listen to Ira again.
“Draco.” She paused, then spoke carefully. “What if you’re building him up to be this perfect hero with absolutely no flaws?”
He had skipped the first match, Gryffindor vs Slytherin, because it was much easier to stay in bed that day.
“I understand Healer Malfoy is attending to you with some help from the other Healers. They’ll take excellent care of you,” Mitchell said to Harry. “It has also come to my attention that you’d rather keep your stay here confidential, which, of course, is something we can do. I trust all of my employees that are in your care, and that this room will be sufficient in keeping your identity hidden. However, if you’re not comfortable enough in here, it would be no trouble to move you.”
“No,” Potter said. He set his elbow on the table and put his chin in his hand. “I don’t think you do.”
Harry felt a sudden rush of affection for them and had the impulse to leave to just see them, to just tell them how important they were to him. He didn’t think he expressed it to them often enough.
“There’s no need to treat me like a child,” Leonel muttered as he surely double-checked that he had all the equipment behind Draco’s back. “You have Betty for that.”
“Even if that were true,” said Draco carefully, “You owe your success to yourself. No one else did that, Harry, it was all you. It could
“He was,” Harry nodded. He exhaled shakily. “Not of his own choice, though. He was never happy as one, Hermione, I saw it.”
Draco crossed his arms and glared at Potter, who only realized it when he’d looked up from his plate. His eyes flitted down to Draco’s still-empty plate, then back up to Draco’s face.
“Man, I’m jealous. Do you want something to drink, by the way?” He rummaged around the kitchen, searching for beverages. “We’ve got…wine, some vodka…and…water.”
Draco took them from the landing to the kitchen. He set everything down on the island and examined the coffees.
He felt like he didn’t belong here, like this was all a big mistake, but his mother had pleaded with him.
Classes had started again but all Draco could think about was Harry. After spending Christmas holiday attached at the hip, it felt wrong to be without him. They could hardly afford to sneak around now that there were bigger risks than simply Macmillan and Abbott knowing. It was a miracle enough that it seemed as though the two Hufflepuffs kept their word about not telling anyone.
But usually, he’d sleep at infrequent intervals, read old paperbacks, and talk to Ron and Hermione when they had time.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Are you still keeping tabs on me? Oh, what am I saying, of course you are, Potter,” Draco said as if it were obvious. He smirked. “Your inner stalker is showing itself again.”
It appeared as if Draco’s unintentional ruse was effective. Better to let Potter think he was ignoring him because he hated him rather than the truth. Draco nodded, and Potter left to get the ingredients.
His face was still wet from rinsing it off; he reached up to wipe the moisture off with wet hands. It didn’t do much good. He stared blankly into his own grey eyes for another minute before going to sit against a wall.
Draco felt strange after the conversation with Potter in Potions that day. It was the most normal he’d felt – whatever that meant – in a long while. He thought Pansy might have noticed a difference in him too; she looked at him with something other than sadness in her eyes.
Draco complied, unbuttoning Harry’s trousers and pulling them down enough so Harry could kick them off.
Granger leaned against Weasley, her hands covering her face. Weasley put his arm around her, as if they could get any closer, and kissed the top of her head. She looked up at him with watery eyes.
Finally willing his body to move, Harry tucked the fallen strands back behind Draco's ear. His hand trailed down his pale face, down his bare chest, finally landing on the cloth restraining his cock. Harry gripped it through Draco's trousers, relishing the way Draco's body tensed.
The way Potter spoke about himself boggled Draco’s mind. Ever since he was a child, it seemed like all everyone could do was care about Potter. Talk to him, talk about him, listen with bated breath to everything he had to say. Either people didn’t actually care about him (which frankly didn’t seem too likely), or Potter truly believed that he wasn’t cared for. But, well, what did Draco know?
“I’m not ignoring it,” he said sharply, snatching his hands back from her. Her eyes widened, but he kept going, driven by his own shock. “How could I possibly ignore it, Pansy? I know he’s not perfect, I know we’ve got a fucked up past, even before the war. I can’t forget the bad things he’s done to me, and I certainly can’t forget what I’ve done to him. But I’m not forgetting the good, either. He’s saved my life repeatedly when he never needed to. He’s been a decent person to me when he has no reason to. I’m not ignoring anything.”
Granger’s eyes were watery again. Weasley sagged with relief, though his arm remained around Granger’s waist protectively.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He was in awe of the man in front of him. How did he do it? How did he seemingly take everything thrown at him in stride? Did anything make him falter? Draco couldn’t help but be impressed.
His mind drifted to his mother; he hoped that she was doing well. He had sent her a letter a week ago but she hadn’t written back yet. She also worried about him, and he also wished she wouldn’t. It was much easier to evade his mother than Pansy, however, so he had to be thankful for the little things.
Draco flushed spectacularly and bit down a smile. He was sure Harry couldn’t see it, given the distance, but from her chuckle, it sounded like Astoria certainly did.
It was Saturday. He was going to be released the day after tomorrow, even though he felt so unbelievably far from ready. The only thing that gave him the semblance of hope was that Ginny was going to be with him and making sure he wouldn't relapse. It made him nervous, funnily enough, to think about living with Ginny again. It'd been years since they had before she'd broken up with him and moved out, leaving Harry to his own devices.
Speak of the devil, Harry thought, as his eyes landed on Malfoy, who was stood talking to Estrada in front of his office.
“That’s not true,” Malfoy said sharply. “You’ve still made a lot of progress, and one relapse doesn’t erase all that.”
By eleven, Draco had checked up on his patients, had a few frank talks, been told off twice, and released one person. There was only one more thing to check off on his morning agenda: talk to Potter.
“I have an Invisibility Cloak,” Potter said, watching Draco’s face carefully. “And after I got rid of that Death Eater, Ron, er, went for it. Called you a bastard, I think.”
God, it actually felt good. The scalding water beat down on his skin, soothing his tense muscles and washing away the sweat and dirt that had accumulated in the past…several days? Week? He scrubbed his skin raw with the provided soap, putting it out of his mind. He was showering now – that was what counted.
Harry sat on the side of his bed and stared down at the floor, not yet comfortable looking Malfoy in the eye.
He watched as Malfoy stood up gracefully and made for the kitchen. Harry sat there for a few more seconds before standing as well.
“That’s the exact opposite of what we need to be doing,” Draco replied as a chill ran down his back.
"Some people don't like it," Draco was saying even as he drew close to Harry's hole. Harry twitched as Draco's hot breath went over it.
But instead of saying anything, he closed the distance and kissed Harry harder than he’d ever had, taking Harry’s face in his hands. Harry let out an embarrassing sort of whimper and kissed back desperately, his heart close to bursting.
“Yes, darling,” she told Rose kindly. “Alright, I’ll leave you boys to it. I’m sure you still have so much to do.”
“Look, you’re doing your job. You’re a Healer, and you’re helping him as best you can to get healthy. You haven’t made any advances – that I know of, at least – so you certainly haven’t crossed any ethical boundaries. Just keep doing what you’re doing and you’ll be perfectly fine.”
“Of course,” Draco said, never failing to be endeared by Harry’s politeness, his uncertainty. He made space in the area next to him and watched as Harry made his way around the table and sat down. “How’d you sleep?”
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said, sighing. He ran a hand through his hair and glanced at Weasley and Granger. “I think this is a conversation we need to have alone.”
Breakfast was sitting on the bedside table under a warming charm, but Harry knew he was too anxious to eat; he felt like he could vomit at any moment. Not wanting to sit still, however, he decided he would take a shower to pass the time.
A series of emotions flashed over Draco’s pale face, which did nothing to mollify Harry, but then he gave a little huff, took hold of one of the lapels on Harry’s coat, and pulled him in for a rough kiss. Harry stumbled forward into Draco’s warm chest and though startled, he kissed back fiercely, his hands coming to rest firmly on Draco’s shoulders.
“I see. We’ll continue checking on you, Mr. Potter,” Estrada said. “I’d like to keep an eye on you and make sure that you stay out of danger. Once the Healer-In-Charge comes in, we’ll do that final step of cleansing, and you should be out of the woods. Does that sound good to you?”
Draco wondered what his past self would do if he told him that he was having a civil disagreement with Harry Potter. He thought fifteen-year-old Draco would laugh in his face and call him mad.
Potter’s brows were furrowed but he didn’t push it. Apparently resigned to dropping the subject, he picked up his fork again. His eyes flicked up at Draco.
They obeyed and hugged for a few moments. Harry took a few deep breaths and closed his eyes, feeling his closest friends wrapping their arms around him. He knew he was loved. He did. It was just hard to wrap his head around. He just felt like such a
Satisfied and already starting to feel the effects of the Xanax, Harry went back into the living room and sat back down in his spot on the couch. He’d only been half-watching the telly for five minutes when Ginny came through the front door, bringing in the aroma of cheese and marinara sauce with her.
When they made their way back to the eighth year Common Room entrance, the two made their goodbyes, knowing it would simply be too risky to enter together in front of who knows how many people. Dinner was surely over by now, and their respective friends were most likely wondering where they were. Draco wished he could kiss Harry goodbye, but settled for a small smile and a 'see you later' before he entered the room first.
What a loaded question. Harry exhaled and looked away, trying to think without getting unnerved by Wolff’s intense gaze.
But then Leonel’s Patronus bounded in and said in his voice, “Come to Mr. Potter’s room immediately.”
For years, Hermione had suggested he go see someone for his PTSD (which Hermione had diagnosed him with after much careful consideration). Of course, she couldn’t let the matter rest when he said
“I’ve treated lots of addicts,” Draco finally continued in a low voice, “But I’d never known one so personally. And for it to be Potter…it’s just even more shocking to me. He’s thrown me off my balance and I don’t know what to do or say anymore. It used to be so easy – they were just patients. I was just their Healer. But now…”
“It’s just,” Harry had said, lowering his wand, “I still can’t believe wizards don’t have hospitals like that too. What do mentally ill wizards and witches do?”
“Yes,” Pansy said, snapping her bag closed. She stood, her eyes flashing between him and Harry. “I’m meeting Padma for dinner. You boys have fun.”
Draco’s heart stopped. His shoulders tensed; he could hardly register what was happening. Before he could even respond, Potter pulled away, releasing his hold on Draco’s arm as he did so. Potter looked mortified, his eyes everywhere but Draco as he stumbled backwards.
“Yeah,” Harry said, seemingly relieved that he remembered. Draco was perplexed – he hadn’t seen Harry this nervous in ages, if ever. “So I wasn’t just curious. I mean, I was, but for, er, anyway, what I’m trying to say is I-think-I-like-blokes.”
At the sound of a throat clearing, Draco looked up from his parchment to see Harry leaning against a chair, bag over his shoulder and a small smile on his face. He looked a bit more well-rested than he did this morning, slightly easing the anxiety that had been gripping Draco throughout the day.
“He’s an old House Elf who’s been serving one of the oldest Pureblood families out there, Harry. Do you expect him to
He took them down some stairs and led them down a corridor, stopping at a painting of a bowl of fruit. Draco squinted at it.
She was giving him the look he'd gotten used to over the years, the one that said, 'oh, Harry' in a patronizing way. He looked away so as to not glare at her.
“All right,” Malfoy said. “Well, Potter, am I correct in saying that you’ve changed your mind since our last conversation?”
“We haven’t all been together in – what, since the end of fifth year? No, that’s not right. I can’t even remember. Fuck, Draco, why did I think this was a good idea? Is it too late to cancel?”
"I'm going to get released on Monday anyway. It's only a couple of days. Come on, Gin, what difference would it make?"
“Great. Trainee Burke should be back in a second with that potion,” Estrada smiled. “And be sure to eat your breakfast, Mr. Potter. Your body needs the nutrients and energy.”
He stepped closer, a hand held out like he was going to grab onto him. He must’ve thought better of it, though, because it fell away. Draco’s gaze focused on it, his mind weakly trying to make sense of what was happening. He was so dizzy.
,” Harry said uncomfortably. He worried his lip. “They knew they weren’t the best. Did you know Ron and his brothers helped me escape in our second year? They showed up in the middle of the night and broke the bars on my windows. We flew away in their Ford Anglia.”
He jumped as he heard the door swing open; Harry turned and looked Malfoy straight in the eyes. They stared at each other, silent, the background noise of the pub halting the need for speech. But then the door was closed again, and it was just the two of them in the bathroom.
“That Gryffindor mindset of ‘if someone I trust trusts someone, then I automatically trust them too’ isn’t sound, Potter. I congratulate Granger and Weasley for not having it,” Draco paused. “Even if it means they’re not happy about this.”
Draco released Harry’s finger from his mouth and licked his lips, his eyes watching Harry trace the pattern.
Draco gave Harry a strange look at that but didn’t say anything; instead he made his way to the bedroom, Harry tagging along. As he gathered his things, he glanced repeatedly at Harry, who lounged against the doorframe.
They stood in comfortable silence for a moment. It was times like these when Draco wondered why they broke up in the first place, but it only took a few minutes to remember the reasons. They were infinitely better as friends and colleagues; their overwhelming passion burned them out so quickly that they grew bored of each other just as fast.
Draco bristled. A few weeks without Pansy’s harsh words and he’d gotten soft. He was annoyed, offended, mad.
that Potter was fit. And even if this wasn’t their situation, he knew that Potter would never want him. For all he knew, he was still a snobby Death Eater in Potter’s mind. And of course, Potter had quite enough to worry about already, regardless.
Draco had been coerced into taking a shot of that with Potter (and by Potter), and at the time, he’d hated it, but now…everything was hazy in a most pleasant way.
"What, you're suddenly shy now? What happened to 'harder Draco, please Draco,'" Draco asked, adopting a falsetto in order to mimic Harry, whose face was now burning.
The good thing about Potter was that he understood on some level. They never talked explicitly about these particular feelings (besides their drunken conversation on Halloween), but Draco knew Potter had issues of his own. They had a silent, mutual understanding to not bring them up. Draco didn’t know if this was healthy or not, but it worked, and that was good enough for him.
ed my way into the program or that I’d only become a Healer in the first place to poison innocents.”
Without a word, Johnny passed the note to Harry, still sniffling and staring at the ceiling. Harry's brain was already buzzing with excitement as he knelt over the table –
Potter must have noticed, because he added on, "But I'm the one here who's a drug addict, so I reckon I shouldn't be making judgements."
“Oh,” Harry said. He scooched closer to Draco, touched that he’d noticed. “Yeah, it’s fine. Two beers in two hours is perfectly normal, Draco.”
Flipping his phone open, he watched as it lit up and displayed words that made Draco’s heart beat even faster.
face before continuing to Draco. “And yes, I did get your letter before – I’m sorry I never responded, I reckon I was still a bit overwhelmed. I’m…glad, I suppose, to know that you feel badly about it all.”
And then Draco realized his sleeve was still rolled up, and that Harry’s hand was on Draco’s arm, and his Mark was out in the open, just a few inches away from Harry’s fingertips. Horror washed over him, amplified because of how empty he had been feeling just moments before, and he wondered if Harry had seen it, but he must have; how could someone miss something so glaringly obvious.
Potter stood back from the railing and made to leave. Draco turned and forced himself to finally look Potter in the eye. Merlin, he was breathtaking.
Draco pushed into Harry some more, somehow aggressive and gentle at the same time. They were nestled on Harry’s couch, surrounded by blankets and pillows (courtesy of Molly), Harry happily molding himself into whatever position Draco wanted to be in. It was absurd but this seemed
"You’re not weak, Draco," Harry said firmly. Draco tried to shake his head, his eyes red. "You're not broken. You're brave and you've been through too much and you hold yourself too accountable. No one can be strong all the time. You're
What Draco Malfoy was doing at a Muggle mental illness support group meeting, Harry did not know. Malfoy crossed the room and sat down directly across from Harry, apparently not spotting him, but as soon as he looked up and caught sight of him, Malfoy’s grey eyes widened fractionally.
The party had died down considerably an hour later. Some had retired to bed alone, and others had left with companions. When Draco realized that Blaise and the youngest Weasley had disappeared around the same time, he blanched.
“But you haven’t had any seizures…we would have caught them if you did. Have you been having nightmares?”
He retrieved the patient’s files from the nightstand and skimmed over them. Bill Douglas was apparently brought in by his coworker at the Ministry at 11:48 am when he’d noticed Douglas turning a slight purple color.
Both Harry and Malfoy watched them leave. His eyesight caught on Malfoy – he was watching him with a somber face, making Harry feel even more uncomfortable than before.
Harry kissed back gently, slowly; he seemed to be savoring it just as much as Draco. Too soon, they came up for air and Draco’s face felt hot as they stared at each other. Even now, Draco grew flustered when Harry looked at him that way – he still couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that
“If you’re sure.” Pansy seemed doubtful. Draco nodded. She gave his hand a final squeeze before letting go. “Then let’s go find Blaise. And the alcohol.”
He looked at Harry sorrowfully, and Harry wanted to hit him. He couldn’t speak, couldn’t find the words, and when Draco made to leave, he softly said, “If you were serious about that owl, I’ll be looking forward to it,” and all Harry could do was stare blankly at his retreating back.
know that, but they certainly don’t! I’m assuming you haven’t told them about me? The fact that we’re even friends?”
Harry suddenly felt very hot in the crowded pub, even though he’d taken his winter coat off earlier. Where was it, anyway? On the floor, probably. Harry pulled up the sleeves of his shirt and ran a hand through his hair.
When he opened his mouth, her brown eyes fixed him with a glare and she answered his unasked question. “Down the loo.”
Harry led Draco back to his lips and his own hand to Draco’s hard cock, stroking through the cloth (which was in fact, Harry’s own pair of briefs). Draco tensed and kissed harder, the hand on Harry’s bicep gripping tighter. Harry dipped his hand into Draco’s pants and grasped it, making Draco gasp softly. God, he was so hot.
“Why can't I just have a simple life?" asked Harry, but all Ginny could do was pat him on the shoulder.
"Um, I'll leave you to it,” she said, her voice a higher pitch than it usually was. She inched closer to the door, a fake smile plastered on her face. “If you decide to come, great, if not, also great. Right. Bye, Harry!”
It wasn’t completely different from what they had before. Sometimes he and Potter would simply meet by chance and talk about whatever was convenient at the time.
As the days went on, he had to resort to riskier tactics to continue to get drugs every few days. He didn’t even bother with potions; that would involve the use of glamors and would altogether be too dangerous. In the Muggle world, he was no one – just another bloke who wanted to escape reality for a bit.
When their food was gone and their conversation had waned, Harry asked their waitress for the check. Draco made to pay, but Harry took care of it before he had the chance.
He wanted to take Draco’s hand in his, comfort him somehow, but he feared Draco’s reaction. His eyes flickered down at it, and Draco caught him; his face grew guarded.
Damien laughed and shook his head. “If she does, she’s in for a disappointment. That bloke’s clearly gay.”
Malfoy did so. Before Harry had gotten used to the feeling, Malfoy had already stowed his wand and turned toward the door. Harry hurried to catch up as Malfoy set off towards his office, swerving to avoid colliding with people who couldn’t see him.
“Er,” Harry said, and he fidgeted uncomfortably as approximately fifteen people turned to look at him. He stared determinedly at Samuel and pretended that Malfoy wasn’t there. He pushed on, “Well, I don’t know if it’s exactly the same, but when I’m feeling, kind of, er, trapped in my head and anxious about things, I like taking walks outside. When I do that, it sort of reminds me how big the world is, and my problems feel tiny in comparison. It’s kind of humbling, I guess. It helps me relax.”
Draco looked him square in the eye, meeting the other man’s gaze even as more tears fell down his cheeks. He bit his bottom lip to keep it from quivering. Potter looked back at him unflinchingly, steadily. There was a softness in his eyes, and Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen them so up-close. And then he was reaching out at Draco.
“Should we pick up where we left off?” Harry asked Draco later, up in his room. They were sitting at the edge of Harry’s bed.
“No,” Draco snapped immediately, cutting Potter short. Fueled only by his anger and embarrassment, Draco stood up. He wavered for a second. “I’m fine, Potter. Fuck off.”
Draco chose this moment to slip his hand into Harry’s trousers, and Harry gasped as Draco took hold of his throbbing cock.
Draco came just a moment later, pulsing deep into Harry as he cried out as well, belatedly releasing his hand from Harry’s neck.
Students who currently walked these halls had tortured younger students not so long ago – Draco included. And
“He's back in London too. Just came in this morning, and just for a day or two,” Granger said. “They’re at Molly’s and Arthur’s.”
The other man had a clearly visceral reaction to Harry saying his name, and it only increased the fluttery feeling in Harry’s stomach. He looked at Harry as though it pained him and leaned away, crossing his arms across his chest.
“I don’t know who was worse, really, between him and my uncle and my aunt. They all hated me, they all wanted me gone. They just had different ways of showing it.” Harry rubbed absently at his neck. “I don’t live with them anymore, thank Merlin, but I can’t let it go. I mean, I know what they did was wrong, but sometimes…I just keep remembering everything they said and did and I…I believe it. I believe that I’m a waste of space or I’m useless or a burden or whatever else they told me I was.”
He didn’t realize at the time the finality of Potter’s statement. Draco thought that maybe he’d given up for the night, but he’d be back the next day to give him that wounded look and ask him invasive questions. But instead of all that, Potter had just gone back to not interfering in Draco’s life, like he had been at the start of the school year.
"Thanks," said Draco quietly. He followed Potter into the room and shut the door behind him. He felt awkward, off-balance. He'd never been inside Potter’s dormitory before, and he'd yelled at him during their last conversation. "I wanted to apologize for everything I said in the bathroom. And in my dorm. It wasn't fair to you, and I'm sorry."
Draco wondered if this was going to be the case again, when Pansy turned toward him, a troubled expression on her face.
“I was going to make an event out of it,” confessed Ron as he moved his bag up and down. “But I was just thinking about how much I love her and how I wanted to hear her talk about work every day and I got caught up in the moment and – really, why not now?”
Whatever progress he had made in the past day was gone, it seemed – Potter looked nearly as bad as he did when he first came in. He was covered in a thin sheen of sweat with heavy bags under his eyes, his hair greasy and unkempt. The ends of his hair curled and stuck to his cheeks. And then, as if to greet Draco, Potter promptly vomited into the bucket at the side of his bed.
Ginny was also the one who had gotten him to wean off the dreamless sleep. She’d noticed just how much he was taking, and just how frequently, and confronted him about it. Harry tried to deny it at first, but she could see right through him. She had known him too well and too long for that. She helped him stop even though he was scared and angry and he begged her to let him keep using them.
“It never even occurred to me that it was something out of the ordinary - being attracted to blokes, I mean. It was just, I was attracted to women and sure, I’d get the same feelings for men but I just brushed it off.”
When Harry and Draco came in through the Floo, Ron’s eyes nearly popped out his head. Hermione dropped her spoon. Her brown eyes jumped from Harry, to Draco, to Draco’s (Harry’s) jumper and jeans, and back to Harry.
“Well, let’s get this over with,” Harry said, choosing to stare at his hands instead of Malfoy’s annoying piteous face. “What do you want to know?”
Harry pointed at the bedside drawer; Draco got it wordlessly and uncapped it with steady fingers. Harry watched, his mind foggy, as Draco covered his fingers in it. Once he’d finished, he looked up at Harry.
Despite Draco’s complaints, Harry pulled him over to the room and let go once they’d reached the closed door. Harry looked at Draco, who raised an eyebrow.
One of the Healers, a tall, lanky individual, shook their hair from their face and exhaled. There was a small shiny badge on the front of their robes, which read 'Ira White - they/them.'
“I know,” Draco said again, “But I seem to recall you, well, overshared about your drinking problem.”
ran through his head for what felt like the thousandth time. “Excuse me, Samuel, I was wondering if I could have a word with Harry.”
“It makes sense, Harry. You shouldn’t be ashamed of feeling this way,” Luna said kindly. “Would you like to fight with Draco again?”
Draco immediately saw that Pansy was waiting for him at their usual table. She was finally detached from Daphne, thank Salazar, and Blaise was still most likely with the Weaslette. He noticed Weasley and Granger sitting at the opposite side of the room, worried expressions on their faces. He tore his gaze away from them.
“It’s your fault,” Draco finally said, glaring at Harry. “You’ve been forcing me to eat every day and I need to – to fix it.”
Draco and Harry found just small moments throughout the school week to meet. Apparently, Granger and Weasley had started paying more attention to Harry again after he’d told them the truth about what had happened in the forest. He found it harder to sneak away since the two of them were spending less time alone together. When he did slip away from time to time, Harry told Draco, it just seemed to heighten their curiosity for who he was seeing.
Potter avoided eye contact as he answered. “Said she was meeting you for a bite to eat and said I should come along. Better than being cooped up or whatever.”
“How do you still not understand?” Draco interrupted, his voice colder than it had been in months. “Leave me alone. I don’t want you here, Potter.”
“No, I can’t chance it,” Potter shook his head aggressively. “I’ve been completely clean since that final step of the Cleansing thing. I can’t risk it.”
Draco stiffened just for a moment. “You’ve already tried that, Potter, did you forget? Madam Pomfrey would be no help, even if I did consent, and my mother has quite enough to worry about. I forbid you from telling her about this.”
He hadn’t been careful. He could easily have been caught on a number of occasions, but this today was much too close for comfort.
Harry led the way into the kitchen, Draco following him like his life depended on it. True to Mrs. Weasley’s word, Hermione and Ron were sat in the kitchen, snacking on the gigantic spread of food before them. They looked up at the noise and grinned.
Draco took out his pack as he walked down to the lake. He had just lit his cigarette when he stopped himself short, ten feet from the water’s edge.
He then heard Draco offer his congratulations. Hermione smiled at him and thanked him warmly, as Ron flushed.
“Likewise,” Samuel said. His eyes were very brown, and Harry found them to be warm and inviting. Samuel bit his lip and cocked his head. “I don’t mean to be rude, but are you South Asian?” When Harry blinked, he continued. “That
Estrada grinned then; a grin that Harry had never seen on Estrada’s face before. It was...predatory, almost.
Draco couldn't seem to decide if he should be impossibly happy or wracked with guilt, and it was driving him mental. The battle waging inside him must have been outwardly apparent as well, since Leo, Betty, and Ira all asked him if he was ok.
The confusion had now been wiped off Potter’s face; he was looking at Draco with this same, indiscernible expression.
“Don’t.” Harry shook his head. “I er, wouldn’t have talked about it anyway. It was enough to know I wasn’t alone, y’know?”
Harry leaned over to kiss him. Draco threaded his fingers through Harry’s hair as he kissed him back, still surprised at how soft it was. Harry pulled away, but instead of straightening back to his original positon, he laid down in the grass and rested his head in Draco’s lap. Draco smiled slightly and resumed playing with Harry’s hair. He almost felt at peace, sitting here, gazing at the stars above him with Harry to accompany him.
“Yes,” Draco answered. “Like I said, she has lots of experience and is one of the best in the field. I’ve already spoken to her and she’d be happy to have you as a patient. And of course, patient confidentiality is her highest priority, so you don’t need to worry about that.”
Final exams were approaching quickly; professors and students alike were on edge, anxious about how much material there was left to cover before term ended. Draco wasn’t too worried; although his grades weren’t as good as they were in the past (shockingly enough, good mental health was essential to do well in school), he had always been good at revising.
“It’s been a week since I’ve been outside,” Harry said. He was looking out the window again, watching the leaves shift and move together gracefully, each one in sync with the next. And then he started talking and couldn’t stop the words from coming out. “It’s sort of…before, I’d stay in for – who knows how long and not even care. But now my mind’s clear again and I have to live and be
“Great!” he said too loudly, trying for a smile. It looked more like a grimace. “Let’s all sit down, we shouldn’t, er, crowd the area.”
“I’d like to extend my condolences and well wishes,” Zabini said, his voice low and smooth. His dark eyes were fixed on Harry. “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”
Merlin, it was even worse up close. Draco looked down at his notes immediately after reaching Potter’s bright (though apprehensive) eyes. It was like looking at the sun; he was too bright, too powerful, and Draco was just a terrible, depressed pile of nerves. He managed to look up long enough to meet Potter’s gaze, hoping there was no pink tinge to his cheeks.
worry about you,” Harry said, shaking his head. “How could I not? You’re my best friends and I just want you to be happy.”
. Draco had never brought it up, and why would he? He’d never spoken to anyone about this before in his life. It was yet another problem, just another issue he had. Something else that marked him as different.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Potter said with no real hostility. He gave a heavy sigh. “Well. As long as it’s not just me.”
“What?” he said defensively, taking in their expressions. “My dad’s uncle abused potions when I was a kid.”
Draco Apparated outside of the Dotted Lamb at 7:58 and was wondering if he should head inside and get a table for all of them when Blaise and Ginevra appeared. They caught sight of each other quickly and congregated in a small circle.
“What else?” Draco muttered. And then the thoughts that had been running through his head flew out of his mouth before he could stop them. “Merlin, I never thought I’d see him again, which was foolish of me in hindsight, I suppose, but like
“I’m afraid to tell you that there were numerous potions in Mr. Potter’s system, all of them having to do with inducing sleep or calmness. Fortunately, since many of them have the same sort of ingredients, there isn’t too great a risk. However, the lavender in the Sleeping Draught may have had a bad reaction to the syrup of hellebore in the Draught of Peace, both of which were found in Mr. Potter’s system. It isn’t mortally dangerous, but it would be best to cleanse his system as soon as possible to avoid any permanent damage.
Draco showed him where he was doing things incorrectly with his brewing techniques without being insulting, and Harry found himself relaxing into the small kitchen area easily. it shocked him how easily he was able to move on from hatred and scepticism and unease to this comfortable environment he found himself in. he got distracted sometimes, looking at draco and the way he moved, trying to piece together how this could be the same person as the boy on the astrology tower, or in the bathroom, or the scared little kid in the dark forest who easily abandoned him to save his own skin. and draco would catch harry staring and scowl at him and ask
Harry could see how his actions were affecting the other man, the confusion that crossed dracos features when he frowned at something Draco said, the way his cheeks heated when their eyes held for a moment too long, he knew watching him in such a way wasn't healthy for anyone. When draco came over to explore a new animal trail luna had found on wednesday night, the turn of the seasons, harry had tried his hardest to ignore him as if it would counter the over attentiveness draco had been on the receiving end of all week. but If anything it had fueled his fire, the next day another partnered potions assignment was given out and draco had been at his elbow. Harry had said yes, Sean and Lavender had gotten together some time on the weekend at a small house party and were doing everything together, Harry  found it a little disturbing. He was almost grateful for draco providing an alternative.
Harry felt a little exposed on dracos behalf. It was the first time he had seen the pokey blond open up, his gentle actions so at odds with the image Harry had built up of him in his mind. Of course, Harry knew he couldn't have been evil all the time. Back at Hogwarts Harry had built visions of him scheing in his dorm room with the other slytherins, rubbing his fingertips together, but he knew they were false images. Draco had to have had his down time back then, he would have softened up for his friends, Harry was sure of it. He had only ever really been on the receiving end of all draco's worst and nastiest moods. It was bizarre, almost surreal to be sitting on his balcony sipping tea and watching him talk fondly about his chubby cat. He was almost content, which put him on edge. He recited his list to remind him of who he was with.
. But he took too long thinking and Harry had come to his senses, a clarity sliding over his eyes, and he snuffed the cigaroll out on his boot. Draco thought it was a very considerate action, a lesser man would have risked scorching the wood slats of the floor. He watched Harry slide the half smoked roll back into the tin where it fit loosely next to several others, and sat down on a chair. It had been a close call.
“Sands almost out,'' Harry muttered and scooped the cat into his arms gently as he stood, “we should finish brewing.” Draco darted to the door and opened it, letting Harry and the cat inside.
The bathroom was stylish and small, a sink and draw below a round mirror on the wall, a toilet wedged in the corner and a pokey bath wedged between two walls with a black stainless shower head protruding from the ceiling. A little fern hanging next to it thriving in the humidity. The room was tiled in white with a thin line of pink glass tiles running around all the walls at waist height. Harry sat on the toilet lid and squeezed his hands together, his knee jumping around. He said his list in his head, once, twice, then out loud in a whisper, and again louder. like a chant he recited his list between knee bounces over and over until his body relaxed and stilled. Harry sat up straight and rolled his shoulders. He looked at himself in the mirror and turned the tap on, washing his face and hands.  He thumbed the little tin box in his chest pocket but left it alone. in the reflection of the mirror he noticed a pile of clothes in the bathtub, soaking wet.
Draco actually had quite an impressive library, inheriting most of its books from the manors collection. He had written out a list of his favourite books for a house elf to pick up for him, not daring to enter the cursed building himself. so his favourite books rested proudly and relieved away from the dark literature found in the halls of his once home.
as a label to. It had been cruel and tormenting and Harry couldn't picture Malfoy as thinking of him in that way. Sure, Lately his actions were vaguely reminiscent of an awed teen looking at a star athlete, like they wanted to be them, or be with them, but Harry had been trying not to think of the possibility that Draco bloody Malfoy had
Friday night rolled around and they had prepared the first half of the doubling potion they were brewing, it was a two day process so Mis V had given the assignment on a Thursday, no less blunt about shutting down the begrudging moans and excuses flip flopped around the room. They were getting trouble from the government, funding was being funneled into other areas and ingredients weren't getting any cheaper so partnerships was the way to go about stretching their stock. The storage cupboard  had looked pretty full to Harry, but he didn't say anything.
Harry, trying to focus and not look quite so scandalised, snuck a peak and Sean's paper and copied his notes. He was far more organised and straight to the point than Harry was. "it was our thing though, we watched it together, and now im being excluded,"
"so i've been thinking..'' Ginny started, wriggling around to sit next to Harry pressed up against his side. Harry raised an eyebrow at her, sipping his coffee curiously. "when the new season of masterchef starts.."
The mirror fogged up and his reflection blurred and he stepped under the hot spray, allowing it to sooth his tense muscles. Harry had let Malfoy kiss him. He had heard draco whisper the question, like a little bird, and seen him lean in. yet he hadn't stopped him. Malfoys lips were softer than ginnys, but cold from the ice in his drink and they tasted like bourbon and bitter unbrushed teeth. Harry had let malfoy cling to his shirt like he might fall away. But when he felt that wet tongue slip between his lips and slide over his teeth he had snapped out of whatever trance he had been under. Harry pulled away, his brows furrowed seriously with great concern, and draco tried to follow him. The blonde leaned in, planting wet open mouthed kisses against his jaw. Harry had to push him off, sobering up quickly. He excused himself and collected his things methodically and left draco sitting embarrassed on his sad mismatched couch.
Luna skipped into the greenhouse cheerfully, humming to herself a song she had had stuck in her head all week. Ginny gave her a blue flower that Harry had given Ginny in the morning, a very confusing chain of events that had led up to it being in Luna's hand. She gazed at it for a minute while her herbology teacher Pots cracked onto her for being late again. She explained that it was Monday, and Harry had left his curtain open allowing the verrigors into their home which had made her sleep really heavily. Pots had argued something ridiculous about how
"honestly i don't understand why you get so worked up about it," sean was saying, scratching down the notes their potions teacher was putting on the board. The potions professor was a stout little woman, in her late thirties and far from bubbly. Mis Vermont was american, she was strict and rough edged but spoke well, Harry found himself enjoying potions a little even, personality aside. He could actually learn from this woman.
“Do you mind if i collect some of those?” draco asked luna, pointing at them. She was sitting on the ground shucking grass seeds and scratching her legs. She followed his finger and craned her neck to see over the tall greenery, and nodded absently, laying back down. Draco supposed that was a yes.
. Draco thanked luna politely, suddenly unsure of where to put the flower. He fumbled with it for a second then slipped it into his satchel, in one of the side pockets where it shouldn't get lost. He looked up and turned red, realising luna had been watching him. She smiled politely and grabbed draco's sleeve to pull him over to an empty bench where they could work.
Draco malfoy was standing in his doorway. Harry's eyebrows knitted together and he took a startled step backwards, taking in his whole form to make sure he was real. Black leather shoes, tailored pants, dense felt coat over a blue collared shirt and his stupid slicked hair ever grees to top it off. But he didn't look bad, Harry had to admit even to himself draco was a man of good taste. Still, there was the dilemma of him being in Harry's doorway smiling politely at him casually clasping a hemp tote bag by his side.
“Come sit down,” Ginny said, sensing Harry's discomfort. She had pulled a singlet over her head when draco had walked in, not quite as comfortable as luna was with being half naked around… guests. Harry supposed fair was fair, and he shouldn't really be freaking out quite so much. He had been in draco's house not twenty four hours ago, sipping sweet tea out of draco's matching muds. But there was something different about the stylish, matching, almost clinical setting of Draco's house and their mismatched and roughened home. It was more personal and connected, their shared home was warm and inviting, the kind of house that welcomed guests, while dracos house was cold and serious, the kind that encouraged tidiness and formal conversation. Harry felt split open and exposed and he held Ginny's hand while she wrote down her notes.
