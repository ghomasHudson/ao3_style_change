“Goodnight... Draco.”
“I was just writing to my mother. Nothing I can’t finish later.”
“It’s the last day of June. It’s been three years today since I came here.”
,” Pansy explains, sliding her gaze over to Harry. “He’s worried that they’ll think he’s doing it to
It takes Harry’s breath away. His lungs simply
“Okay, I’ll leave you to it, then,” Harry says.
open doors for Naia? Draco feels almost breathless at the idea of what the future could hold for a brilliant young person with a connection like that.
Pansy schools her expression back into the dispassionate one she usually wears. “Nothing. I was just thinking… it’s nice to see them both happy and laughing. After everything.”
Harry’s faintly horrified to hear a man who must be close to eighty speak like that. Then what Carl (or maybe it’s Curt) just said sinks in.
“Let’s go,” Draco says when he rejoins Harry, cloak over his shoulders and satchel in hand. “We’ve had a very productive week, wouldn’t you say?”
Just when Draco’s debating whether to slip a hand down Harry’s chest and under his shirt, the Floo flares. They both draw back, startled by the sound. Draco silently thanks Merlin that the sofa isn’t in the line of sight of the fireplace, because the unmistakable voice of Molly Weasley calls through the flames.
“Are you all right? They didn’t rough you up, did they?” she demands.
“The only people who know this story are Ron and Hermione, and they were worried that I’d gone a little mad after they heard it,” he began. “It’s going to be hard to believe, I know, but I swear it’s all real.”
was already there, trying to take you.”
“Let’s just say that I have a well-established history of choosing things that I
The rest of the words got caught in Harry’s throat. Malfoy’s expression turned sympathetic, and when he spoke again, it was with surprising gentleness.
“Another hour and it’ll be ready,” he says, catching Harry’s eye. “Then I can start getting the stones for the firepit.”
, he congratulates himself.
for all I care.”
It seemed like he was gone forever, but it couldn’t have been more than an hour. By the time he returned, I was beginning to feel truly miserable.
I’m just holding it for you until you decide you want it back.” While they’re waiting for the light to change, Draco takes the opportunity to give Harry a wry smile. “And don’t tell me
They both decline the offer of dessert. Harry thinks they both just want to get out of here, away from the din and the other people sitting so close around them. It seems to take forever for the bill to arrive, and then there’s another long wait for the credit card slip that Harry needs to sign. Malfoy’s lips press together in disapproval every time he sees their server attending other tables, making Harry feel even worse about the evening.
“Marry a gay man with a chequered past?” Draco asks with a bitter twist to his lips. “Not for money, don’t worry. She has enough of her own, between what her parents give her and her photography business. She simply wanted a family—a child of her own, to be specific—without the complications of a traditional marriage.”
“Oh, I was coming to look for you,” he says.
“Who the fuck would I tell?” I sneered, trying to pull my arm away. “It’s not like anyone would believe me, even if I did.”
“We’re not going to slam into the wards halfway across, I hope,” Malfoy says sharply.
“Are you sure you want to know?” Harry asks. “It’s… really awful. I mean, he did a lot of truly monstrous things, but this might be the most horrible.”
“I told you. I felt you die,” he said quietly. “I can feel it when anyone nearby dies, and it’s… the most awful, awful thing, Draco.”
Harry lays in the dark, eyes burning, until Draco’s breathing settles into the regular rhythm of sleep. Then he reaches for his wand to end the Silencing Charm. At least he can have the frogs and crickets to keep him company.
“Of course not,” Parkinson smiles with a careless shrug. “I’m merely a socialite myself, unemployed and decorative. Who am I to judge?”
He lost it. He lost the stag.
I pulled my hands from his and wrapped my arms around him.
“Aurors, rounding up people in the Alley,” Draco says, panting. He lifts his hand to run it over his sweaty face, but stops when he notices that his palm is grey with grime. “Didn’t want to get... detained.”
A tentacle brushes his leg. He cries out, half-expecting to be pulled under.
He’s unsure how to break the awkward silence while they straighten the chairs and Vanish the empty Butterbeer bottles. There’s something
“Yeah, well, telling them that Death came by and confirmed that I was really his Master and that there wasn’t anything I could do about it definitely didn’t help.” Harry leaned back against the pillows, pulling me against his chest and waiting to speak until I’d settled beside him. “They wanted me to see a Mind Healer. Or an Unspeakable, which would have been even worse. Can you imagine if the Ministry found out I have this much magic?”
It’s only then that Harry notices the patter of raindrops against the kitchen window. He smiles at Luna in wonder and starts on his soup. Remembering the unusual combination of ingredients in the pie last weekend, he decides against asking what’s in it. He’s probably better off not knowing.
“Oh, god, oh, god. Draco,” Potter rasped near my ear. Trembling fingers swept my fringe off my forehead. “Are you awake?”
of all people to live here with you?”
, you knob!” Greg calls when he sees Harry stumble in his rush to get away from the bonfire.
The room seemed to hold its breath around us while he waited for my answer. I knew, somehow, that by accepting I would be putting myself in Potter’s hands—he’d already helped me more than he’d needed to, so I would be the one indebted to him once again. Not only that, there was still so much I didn’t understand about him.
Draco shakes his head. He looks down at his filthy hands, resting in his lap, and his vision suddenly seems to tunnel around them.
“Well, that’s settled then,” Luna says, clapping her hands. “Shall we have lunch? I’m as hungry as an Augerey chick.”
He sets out in the direction that takes him away from the village and towards the wilder part of the valley, where Ron once mentioned there’s a river that twists its way down from the moorland to the west. Harry’s never ventured beyond the pasture where they play pick-up Quidditch, but he reckons he can always find a quiet spot from which to Apparate if he gets lost.
“Oh, fuck me. I never even thought of that,” Draco moans. “Bloody Ravenclaws.”
“He doesn’t think there’ll be any trouble for you two, does he?” Weasley asks, then relaxes when Harry shakes his head. “They’re not saying anything to my face, but I’m getting a lot of suspicious looks in the bullpen these days. Some of them can’t seem to make up their minds about whose side I’m going to come down on.”
“Draco?”
“To light,” she says solemnly. “May it illuminate new paths for us to follow and spark new hopes and aspirations. May it shine into our hearts today, the longest day of the year, so that we may carry it through the darker days ahead.”
Harry awakens to the sound of snowploughs roaring down Columbus Avenue and a warm, slightly clammy body stirring against him.
He’s not in a Ministry holding cell. He’s in his ramshackle attic bedsit in Knockturn Alley. The early morning light slips around the edges of the piece of heavy fabric tacked over the window with Sticking Charms. Above his bed, Draco sees the familiar pattern of knots in the sloping wooden ceiling. He’s spent countless hours staring at them, lost in thought with a half-read novel resting on his chest. The air smells of the Muggle brand of tea that he drinks.
“You have me now. Forever. Did you really believe that this was never going to happen?”
They stride back down the slope, feeling much more companionable than when they climbed it. Just before they reach the path, a hare darts out of the grass in front of them, a streak of brown fur.
Malfoy reaches for a book from the pile on his bed. “I’ll be reading downstairs for a while.”
“Saint Mungo’s treats people for free. Why would they go to an unlicensed Healer?” Granger asks, leaning forward.
Harry doesn’t like the bitter twist of jealousy that he experiences when he thinks of it. He
!” she admonishes him when she sees his face.
It’s disturbingly… organised. Other than the layer of dust that coats everything, dulling their colours and sharp edges, it’s almost tidy. Whatever malevolent turn Erwina’s thoughts took near the end of her life, Harry gets the impression that she never lost her fondness for her collection. All the pieces are carefully arranged on the shelves, as if she liked to come in this room and admire them, like a visitor to a museum.
“No, I’ll do them,” Potter said, gripping the arms of the chair. “Can you just get the fuck out of my house, please?”
Harry laughs. “Probably for the best. I’m sure he’ll explain it to me tomorrow. I’ll get a long cord, just to be safe.”
After levering himself upright, Draco fills a glass with a shaky
“What happened?” Draco asks, gripping Harry by the shoulders. “Are you cursed? Should I take you to Hogwarts? Just nod or shake your head.”
, Potter,” I replied, turning on the balls of my feet to look up at him, archly. “Not just the wandless magic, which is impressive in its own right. When I’m in my crow form near you, it’s almost like standing under a waterfall of magic.”
“I thought Andromeda might like some, but… I suppose you could say that a new and more interesting possibility arose,” Malfoy says with a raised eyebrow. He pours a couple of inches into each glass and passes one to Harry. “Savour that. It’s not that swill Ogden’s makes.”
The stag leaps from Harry’s wand, making Teddy clap with delight. He sends it in a trotting loop around Teddy’s head before giving it the message and sending it on its way.
“Oh, no, I’m sorry,” Harry says. “Is there anything I can do to help?”
Charm over himself and steps out into the rain. After taking a few deep inhales, he walks towards the house at a leisurely pace to savour the cool air on his face.
“That’s good to hear,” Andromeda says. “Ah, speaking of writing… Before I forget, Harry, Teddy asked me to tell you that he needs your help with a short essay for school.”
“I really am sorry! Can I open my eyes now?” Harry asks meekly.
“All right.”
Between seedlings, Harry straightens up to stretch his back and sees that Pansy and Luna have returned to the injured snake. He can hear Pansy’s voice across the clearing, close to panic. She seems determined to help Luna in spite of her fear, and Harry can’t help but admire that. He thinks of Ron and the spiders with a smile.
But that’s as far as he gets before Harry straddles his legs and kisses him clumsily. Honestly, it’s a small miracle that Harry doesn’t bash his head against the low ceiling, especially since Malfoy’s bed is lurching, too. Stupid beds. He reaches over to grab the top of the wooden headboard and accidentally catches Malfoy’s hair.
“It’s really small,” Harry grits out.
“I need you to drink these. A Blood-Replenishing Potion and a Strengthening Solution.”
can come up with some ridiculous ideas, but I hope they won’t start with that one.” Harry moves his hand to cup the back of Draco’s neck and holds his gaze. “So, would you consider that flat? If the rent isn’t too much?”
“Um, no.” Malfoy pushes himself upright and runs a hand over his hair. “I’ll change in the bathroom, I think.”
It takes over an hour to reach the desolate hilltop where the stone circle lies. Harry doesn’t realise they’ve arrived until the others start examining the slabs of stone sunk into the peat. They’re spaced out in a wide ring, their exposed sides level with the ground around them.
“She wants…” Harry trailed off, mind unhelpfully blank.
“Yes, it was very good. I’ve never tried tomato soup before. I was afraid it would taste like the sauce that goes on pasta, when I saw it in the shop,” Draco says with a sheepish smile.
After that night, one of them managed to find the other every few days. A hidden alcove, an empty classroom, plus a few cutting words or a challenging lift of a chin were all it took to goad each other into another snog. Draco learnt where to touch Potter to make him pull his mouth away with a gasp. How to tilt his head so that Potter got the hint and went to work on Draco’s neck. He learnt that Potter takes his tea sweet when they kissed after breakfast. He knows when Potter has been to visit Hagrid by the woodsmoke in his clothes.
I always resisted, telling myself that I might just be going a little barmy from the isolation.
, and he feels slightly reassured. He keeps his eyes locked on Potter until the Aurors lead him around a corner and into a room with a small table and two chairs.
Despite his disappointment that his joke had fallen flat, he couldn’t help adding
Malfoy’s scowl sobers him quickly, and then the horrifying thought that he just
the most important anyway, don’t you think?”
“Madam Peabody was a bitter old bat who pinched children while giving them dancing lessons,” Draco replies drily. “It’s a miracle we still enjoy dancing at all. Not that I have the occasion to do it very often.”
Malfoy glares at Harry for a moment before he disappears into the hallway.
Draco nods and gives a small wave before turning away.
Harry tries to read his expression, but it’s impossible with the darkness and the scarves over his face.
“So, when exactly did you announce to all and sundry that I’m your soulmate?”
“Now you sound like Hermione. I got a talk about high-functioning depression and compulsive overworking the other day.” Harry sighs. “I really do think it’s just a recent thing. A
“And you?” Malfoy asks, interrupting Harry’s thoughts. “What brings you to New York?”
“You’ll be careful, won’t you?” Draco asks soberly.
“Nah, I knew I didn’t want to do that when Bill trained me in curse breaking, and it’s not like the goblins would trust me with one dented Knut anyway. You know I enjoy what I do, and I get to be my own boss and skip out early on Fridays.”
Harry smiles at Draco after she darts out of the room.
And yet he can’t help feeling that their happiness has ebbed somehow, and that they’ve both been pulled away from the solid ground that they used to stand on before Harry found out about their bond. Harry’s relationships with his friends and family are strained; his faith in his work as an Auror is shaken. Draco’s contentment with life in Knockturn has been eroded by his inability to reciprocate Harry’s generosity and, if he’s honest with himself, the tempting offer to move into a proper flat.
Draco sighs. “Her parents have an extremely unhealthy and unhappy marriage. Astoria grew up witnessing all the ways that two people could make each other miserable, both intentionally and unintentionally. Divorce wasn’t something they thought their social standing could survive, and going through the messy legal process probably would have been worse than just putting up with each other. So, the long and the short of it is that Astoria swore she’d never marry. Unfortunately, wizarding society isn’t quite ready yet to accept witches who choose to conceive out of wedlock and raise children alone. And that’s how she and I found that we could satisfy her wishes and my obligations by marrying each other. And we both agree that it’s worked out wonderfully.”
Pansy and Luna are deep in conversation and Greg seems absorbed in their surroundings, craning his neck when he hears a bird singing above them or reaching out to touch the trees that grow close to the path.
“Anything that contradicts the image of order and prosperity that the Ministry wants to maintain. Anything that would show that they’re not doing a bang-up job and might endanger their jobs or reelection chances. If they can keep most of the suffering conveniently confined in one district, then the rest of the population won’t see it. And if it becomes an accepted belief that the people who live in that district are criminals and dark wizards, then the Ministry is morally justified in ignoring the needs of the people who live there.”
“Well, all right,” Draco sighed. “We’ll see if it helps. Thank you, Potter.”
“Hmm?”
“Were you worried that we were improper?” Harry asks with a laugh. He grips Draco by the hips and pulls him closer, then adds in a lower voice, “That does sound rather fun, actually. We should try it.”
“You’ve worked here for three years now, haven’t you?” Wharton asks, eying the tidy stacks of parchment on Draco’s desk, then the spotless wooden benchtop where he prepares parcels to send by owl post.
“Of course.”
Malfoy mirrors Harry’s position on his own bed, legs crossed at the ankles. “I’m sure people would line up to hear them anyway. You must have been asked to.”
“Yeah, it’s the only one near where we were walking.”
“Go walking much?” Harry asks, squinting up at him against the bright sky.
“A piece of— How could a soul be broken into pieces, Harry? I don’t think that’s even possible.”
The most recent letter from his mother, sitting in plain sight on the small table tucked into the corner, catches Draco’s eye. He falters for a moment, but recovers quickly. Merlin, he hopes Harry didn’t take the liberty of reading it. Her reaction to the news that Harry’s his soulmate is not something Draco wants him to see.
“I also hear you’ve been working hard with a great tutor,” Harry adds, with a wink for Draco.
“Well it took a while to figure out what she was talking about,” Harry explained, shifting the snake in his arms again. “That’s why we were talking for so long.”
“Why wasn’t it pleasant to come home? Because of where you lived?” Potter asked. He had settled in the armchair, waiting for the kettle to boil.
“All right, all right. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t do that. I don’t want to upset you, either.”
“What’s this?” Parkinson asks with narrowed eyes when Harry sets the hamper on an empty chair.
“Yes,” Harry says defensively.
“Let’s take a break for a bit. Then we can move to the tent and narrow down the list while we have our tea,” Parkinson says. She rolls up the parchment and sends it and the quill flying into the tent with a flick of her wand.
Draco hums. “All right.”
“I’m going to have a short walk, I think,” Harry tells him, making the decision almost as the words form in his mouth. “Would you rather I sleep out here tonight? I’ll understand, if you do.”
“Ah, her soulmate mark,” Harry says softly.
Harry opens his eyes and blinks rapidly. Hovering around them in a hazy cloud of light are several dozen fairies.
Harry still can’t figure out what possessed him to do it.
Perhaps that should have made it even more worrisome.
Charms on them as he stumbles over tussocks of grass.
“Draco!” she shouts again, and he sees Naia’s head of black curls hurtling through the crowds. She’s waving something above her head. “Draco,
“What, Potter? You hoped that, what?”
“Don’t look so worried, Potter. I’m not going to jump you,” Malfoy snickers. “I just thought we could have a drink to celebrate my birthday.”
“So, what needs to be done?” Harry asks. “Do you want me to start turning another bed or spread the manure on that one?”
It’s a beautiful April day. He tilts his head back and watches the towering clouds drift by, some cottony white, others woolly grey. The air smells divine — sweet apple blossoms and freshly-cut grass, along with the sharper scents of the damp soil of the lane and woodsmoke from the Burrow chimneys.
“Please do,” Susannah says, smiling. “And stay for dinner. I’m sure Jer and I will both be wrecks. We’ll need something to take our minds off it.”
Draco’s wearing his black jeans and Muggle coat again. His fair hair shines brightly under the lights of the car park. The air has a sharper bite tonight, a hint of the winter weather to come. Harry pushes his fists into the pockets of his jacket and glances longingly at the soft scarf wrapped around Draco’s throat. He obviously paid more attention to the weather forecast when he was packing than Harry did.
“Thanks, Gin,” Harry says sincerely. “I appreciate it.”
They shook hands at the front door, as usual, and Draco solemnly expressed his gratitude for Harry’s assistance one more time.
“Is that what happened with us?” Harry asks, cocking his head with an amused smile.
“Draco, this is Verity, one of the teachers at the Knockturn school,” she says. “She has some of your former students in her class.”
“Ideally, yes. But if you recall, I already told you about my financial… challenges. I hope one day to have a proper lab, once I establish myself as a Potions Master and business picks up. And there’s no danger to me or anyone else with proper ventilation and safety procedures. I’m hardly likely to cause an explosion like a bumbling first-year student,” Draco said, frowning as if Harry had insulted him.
Draco unbuttons his shirt and slides it off his right shoulder, twisting sideways in the chair to show his back to the Healer. She exhales with a soft murmur of gratitude that Draco doesn’t quite catch.
“I’ve had more than enough of people deciding what’s best for me. Unlike you,
There’s no answer to Harry’s knock. He considers Apparating to Portree for lunch, or even making a second, longer jump to go to Hogsmeade, but then remembers that Mary told him and Draco of a small museum and arts center in Loch nam Madadh that has a little cafe. The idea of staying close to the cottage (and the bed inside it) is appealing. Harry pulls up his hood against the drizzle and heads back to the lane.
Draco laughs. “I’m not surprised. She teases me about re-reading it so many times, but I think she loves that book more than anyone I know. She probably took it as a personal affront that you fell asleep.”
It still feels a bit jarring just thinking it. Harry hasn’t considered telling anyone yet, even Ron and Hermione. He knows they’ll be completely supportive, but he’ll have to muster some Gryffindor courage before he’s ready to say the words aloud. And find a way to dodge their questions about how this epiphany came about without mentioning a certain blond Slytherin.
“You will be asked to identify yourself.”
There’s no point dwelling on it right now, Draco tells himself as he rises from the chair. Best to get on with his morning and stay focused on the positive parts of his life: Harry, of course; the kids he tutors on weekends; even his job, which has provided a meagre yet honest living—not an easy thing to come by for someone with a criminal record.
Harry looks away from Draco, over his shoulder at the dark street beyond. “Were those things true? What you said about the bribes and the sex workers?”
“Has the house itself been checked for curses?” Harry asks.
“They’re pretty close to the shoreline. I was here over the summer when the staff was recasting them.”
“Ernie said to wear something warm and waterproof. It’ll likely be raining when we get there, and the Portkey will set us down outside.”
Harry reminds himself that Malfoy’s a complete prat and someone he should definitely not kiss ever again. Only two days ago, he asked Andromeda—in the middle of lunch!— if she knew any mending charms for the
On the walk back to Harry’s flat, Draco heaves a heavy sigh that makes Harry pull him by the hand to a stop. Beneath the awning of a sweets shop, he cups the back of Draco’s head with a gloved hand.
Draco whispers and lets himself be pulled into Harry’s arms.
—is gazing up at him, lips slightly parted and pupils wide. He gently takes Harry’s wand and lays it on the bedside table, then he reaches for Harry. He goes eagerly, tugging Draco down beside him, ready to find his mouth again and explore the warm skin beneath his clothes.
He cuts himself off again and returns the book to the shelf. When he turns back, he resumes spooning food onto his plate without another word. Harry’s never seen Malfoy be the least bit self-conscious before. It’s both unexpected and a little painful.
“That’s not what I was going to say. I was going to say that you’re my soulmate, and if they love me, there’s no way that they could believe that my perfect match is a terrible person, right? That should be enough proof for them.”
Suddenly worried that he was taking too long and Draco would think that he was snooping, Harry flushed the toilet and returned to the reptile room.
“Do you think Luna got to spend her summers with friends?” Parkinson continues, her voice lowering dangerously. “Or Draco played in the woods and explored the countryside? I spent my childhood in London. My parents wouldn’t even take me to a park because there might be
“I said, would you like something sweet?”
With a deep sigh, Harry turns off the television. He lost track of the story at least a half hour ago, and now his mouth is watering at the thought of the meal that’s being prepared two floors below.
Harry laughs. “Well, I know where to go when I run out of loo roll and the shops are closed.”
It takes three days for Harry to show up at Draco’s door. They’re almost as agonizing as the five days he spent waiting for news of Harry’s condition. Draco was beginning to think that Harry’s friends were hiding the identity of his soulmate from him and convinced him to take a holiday abroad in order to keep them apart. Honestly, that might be preferable to Harry deliberately staying away.
“Mmm, not really,” Harry admits. “It was just something to do.”
That night, Potter merely nodded with weary acceptance when I told him I’d rather sleep downstairs again. He probably thought I was punishing him for his impulsive offer earlier.
“And that’s not what you want?” Harry asks. What he really wants to know is which of those things Draco objects to most. Marriage? Children?
Draco keeps his back to Harry. “It’s understandable if you were.”
“About the same as usual,” Draco replies, tensing.
Luna and Pansy lean back so he can see what’s inside the basket that’s on the table. It’s a snake with dull, green-brown scales, curled up and motionless.
“Don’t you think it’s odd that so many of the pieces with curses on them were Muggle?” Harry asks. “From what you’ve told me, it’s almost three-to-one, Muggle to magical.”
“I have to admit, I’m rather impressed with what you make already,” Pansy says. “I can barely manage toast. I think our house-elves would rather I stay out of the kitchen entirely, for everyone’s safety.”
Harry laughs, shaky and rueful. “Oh, I just announced to the entire Auror Department that you’re my soulmate. After handing in my badge to the Head Auror in the middle of an emergency meeting. Can you start packing now, please?”
“I’m glad they did. But you can still see them. It’s not like you’d be moving out of England or something. And you’ll still be working there.”
“Come on,” Harry whispers, taking Draco’s hand and wrapping it around both of them.
Draco tenses. Potter hasn’t returned yet and Draco doesn’t want to be here when he does. The one thing that could make this disastrous party even worse would be having to watch Potter cheer in the new year from across the room, knowing that he’s avoiding Draco out of anger rather than discretion.
The bathroom door is closed when Harry takes his rucksack into the bedroom to put his things away. Draco emerges a short time later wearing navy blue flannel pyjamas. His long hair is unbound and loose around his angular face. The low light from the lamp makes him look softer than usual, Harry thinks. More vulnerable.
“I also wanted to apologise for showing up at your door uninvited and upsetting you,” Potter says abruptly. “I shouldn’t have intruded like that.”
“Muggles. It’s not hard to find someone at a club, but it was just an occasional thing.”
When lunch has been eaten and the table tidied up for Draco’s afternoon work, he and Harry step out the back door and climb over the windblown dunes to the western side of the island. The air is sharp and salty on their faces as they trudge over the rise to get their first glimpse of the open sea since they arrived.
so that I’d get enough food in me to be able to go out and look for work the next day.”
“No, I want to see you this time, if you don’t mind,” Harry says. He peels Draco’s shirt off his shoulders and lets it fall to the floor.
Even though it isn’t any more sensitive than the rest of his back, he shivers at the touch. It’s the first time Harry’s seen it, and it almost feels more intimate than anything else they’ve done. Harry presses his lips to the mark, then kisses across Draco’s shoulder blades and up to the nape of his neck. The brush of his beard has Draco squirming against the duvet, but Harry holds him down with a splayed hand on his lower back and nips at the skin beneath Draco’s ear.
Greg sits on the bench beside Harry with a dramatic sigh. No, calling it dramatic would be uncharitable, Harry decides. Greg’s been working outside all day and the man understandably wants his dinner. Harry leans forward to prod the burning logs with a fireplace poker from the house, hoping to hurry things along a bit.
“I don’t think you regret marrying Astoria and having Scorpius,” Harry points out.
. She noticed I was cagey about all the time I spent here.”
“No, she’s actually a good-sized foal. She’ll try to stand up in a little while, and you’ll see how tall she is. I’m going to check the mare now. You might want to stand back.”
I gave in, less because I wanted the bed that badly (though it was nice), and more because I was simply too damn exhausted to argue with him anymore.
Draco leans closer to read over Harry’s shoulder. “Is that what ‘Oxfam’ is? I wasn’t certain. What a strange place for Erwina to go shopping. I doubt she was lacking for gold.”
It’s not
“No, that part was actually nice. It was having my friends not even recognise me anymore…”
The three walk back to the lift, waiting until they’re inside to speak.
“It should be,” Malfoy replies, picking up the bottle to look at the label. “It’s older than both of us put together. By the way, this is the moment when you would propose a toast in my honour, if you weren’t an utter cretin.”
“Yeah, I did,” he says, sinking further down in the loveseat to hide his burning cheeks. “And I got some takeaway in Portree and brought it back here for dinner.”
Now Harry worries that his most recent—and most shocking, to their ears—decision will undo the progress he’s made in getting his friends and family to trust his judgement.
is in the room. He shakes his head.
“You have a way with them, from what I’ve seen with Teddy and Naia,” Draco chimes in. “You may get your fill of the latter when she’s home from school next summer. She already won’t stop talking about you, according to her mother.”
“Yeah, why not?” Harry hears Andromeda’s footsteps on the stairs, so he gets to his feet. “Besides, this is the first time you’ve ever stopped trying to make my life miserable. That’s a good enough reason, all by itself.”
I watched from the armchair, where I was reading
Pansy comes over and takes Luna’s hand. “Should we wait it out, do you think, or try to go back?”
“I love you, too.”
the Ministry—and a good portion of the wizarding world—for treating everyone here without the smallest bit of dignity and humanity.
“Are we safe?” he asks quietly. “I don’t mean from the press. From the other people who know about our bond?”
Harry grabs his bags and his jacket and wraps his fingers around the smooth corner of the ashtray. It’s already starting to hum with magic.
Despite walking quickly and breaking into a trot when the cottage is in sight, Harry’s soaked through by the time he gets inside. Sitting by the fireplace is tempting, but the bed and its heavy duvet sound even better. He hangs his wet clothes over the curtain rod around the bathtub, then returns to the bedroom to pull on a fresh pair of pants.
Harry keeps his eyes squeezed shut as he feels Malfoy reach across him to grab the back of the chair. Malfoy then pulls himself a bit more upright and lifts his hips to scoot back an inch or two.
“I think I’ve worked it out, but I want to think it through one more time before I try anything. Check my calculations again. But I’ll probably try it tomorrow. Any guesses what’s in there?”
Granger waves back while Weasley fumbles with their coats and the dripping brolly. Draco’s hand finds his napkin again while he watches them walk to their table. He follows Harry’s lead and stands to greet them.
“That’s not how it works, Potter. You don’t get to pick.”
Harry’s relieved. “Okay, I’m glad you liked it.”
This time, the only reason why Hermione and Ron were surprised to see Harry was because they weren’t expecting him on a Thursday evening as they were squabbling over what to make for dinner. He almost started crying again when Ron cuffed him on the shoulder and asked him if he wanted a beer.
“Of course not,” Harry replies, curious as to why Draco seems… uncomfortable. Maybe it’s because they’re alone together, which hasn’t happened before.
The first time that Draco sees Harry Potter after the war, he’s huddled against the wall in the exercise yard at Azkaban, shivering in his grey prison robes with his hands pushed into the opposite sleeves and the hood pulled low over his shorn head.
What the fuck is the world coming to?
He didn’t get the chance to finish. Harry launched himself out of the chair and crushed Malfoy in a hug, laughing tearfully into the shoulder of his Unspeakable robes.
Two days later, Draco’s eagle owl landed on the kitchen windowsill at Grimmauld Place. Its appearance made Harry’s heart leap, but the letter itself carried grim news.
“I already told you that I thought it might be letters. Of the
“All done?” Draco asks, levitating the last of the clean dishes into the cupboard. “Did everyone in magical Britain want to talk to you?”
Draco looks away. “That’s hardly the same thing as what I did. I think it was a very reasonable choice, and surely one you don’t regret.”
“You’ve a busy life,” Draco says lightly as he starts casting Preservation Charms on the loaves in the bag. Susannah always gives him more than he can eat before things start to get stale. He hums with pleasure when he finds half a dozen sticky buns at the bottom of the bag, wrapped in waxed paper. When he’s done organising the cupboard to his satisfaction, he Vanishes the paper bag and turns back to Harry.
“I remember,” Draco says. “He sounded very dull.”
Malfoy finally relaxes a little, so Harry turns his chin with gentle fingers and kisses him soundly.
“Is there something upstairs?” Draco demands, straightening so that he’s holding Harry at arm’s length. “Is it safe to leave it?”
than he has in a long time.
“I wasn’t sure if he wanted me to, just yet,” Draco says. He really should have, but at the time it happened, he’d been too anxious about the news of their bond exploding. Jerome and Susannah thought he was staying with Harry to spend more time with him. Draco had decided that they’d only worry if they thought that Aurors might be targeting him.
If Andromeda wasn’t sitting on the sofa, Harry would probably elbow Malfoy in the solar plexus.
“I know. You’re okay now. We won’t let them in here,” she says, filling a glass with water for him.
When he turns towards the door, Harry sees that it’s perfectly intact. The wardrobe, however, has its doors blown off at the hinges. They’re on the floor, barely visible beneath a pile of…
“Maybe he finally got it through his thick, blond head that you want to get in his pants,” Ron called from somewhere out of sight. “Ugh, I gave myself mental images. Hermione, be a love and kill me the next time I bring up Malfoy’s pants.” Hermione just rolled her eyes and shooed Ron away from the Floo.
kids to go looking for trouble in there.”
“It was no trouble, honestly,” Harry replied. “Hey, maybe you could meet me and Teddy for ice cream sometime. I’m sure he’d like that. Andromeda says he enjoys your visits.”
“In honour of your twenty-first birthday, Draco,” she says when she places the cardboard box in front of him.
(as his mother describes them) allegiances have returned to Hogwarts.
“Hmm,” Harry agrees, taking his first sip. It’s delicious. Leave it to Draco to remember to pack his own tea supply. “I won’t interrupt you if you want to go back to your book.”
“There you are,” Susannah says when the bag is brimming with bread and rolls, in addition to the biscuits.
“Yeah, that would be great, thanks.”
The next twenty-four hours were going to be torture.
“And your flying lessons?” Draco teases.
and heads to the bathroom for a slash and some cold water on his face to wake himself up properly. Then he dresses warmly and slips into the sitting room.
I had lain beside him all night without knowing it.
The flat tone of his voice gets Harry’s attention. “What’s the matter? Is Pansy mad that we wanted to stop for a bit?”
“Oh, I didn’t know.” Draco glances at Harry, who looks just as surprised. “I’d be honoured to be invited.”
Draco brightens. “As a matter of fact, I do. A loaf of bread for dinner, if it’s not too late to buy one.”
“It’s
It doesn’t matter. He knows they’ll see each other again soon.
The room is
After shaking the Healer’s hand, Draco summons the courage to acknowledge Harry’s friends. Mrs Weasley looks away, but Granger nods. Draco reads sympathy in her expression, which surprises him. He hopes it’s because she empathises with having one’s soulmate cursed—Weasley is an Auror, too, Draco knows—and not because she expects that Harry will reject him shortly.
“Don’t worry, I know better than to try,” Harry laughs. “Did you just drop by for a cuppa and a chat, or was there something else?”
at the base of the stacked wood.
“You’re covered in flour, Potter. What are you even wearing an apron for?”
He loosens his Slytherin tie and slips it over his head before starting on his shirt. Harry can’t help following the movements of Malfoy’s long fingers as he slips each button through its hole, revealing a narrow strip of his pale chest.
all day, even when they’ve been alone, leaving Harry unsure if he should attempt it himself.
“W-why are you st-stopping here?” Harry chatters.
He attempted a smile, but it wavered quickly.
“And why would I do that?”
Astoria agreed to it and made arrangements for Scorpius to go to his grandparents’ house when she has something scheduled for her photography business. Draco only requires that he can return home every three or four days to spend time with his wife and son. He’ll arrange the Portkeys for himself. Enclosed with Draco’s letter is a separate list of his standard services and rates to forward to Ernie, so that an agreement can be drawn up in advance.
Those are awfully grim things to have in common… hardly something upon which to base a friendship, which is what Harry is beginning to suspect he’d like to have with Malfoy.
likes Shrivelfig tea.”
“What’s this, a peace offering?” Draco asked, taking the bag. He reached into the layers of tissue paper and pulled out a mug with a picture of a lizard on it.
Draco’s smile vanishes. “I do, rather. I’ve refused to take any money from my parents.”
“I was hoping she’d be here when we left.”
“I could give it to you. I have more than I’ll ever need, and some of it is from the Black vaults.”
“It’s a double bed. We could share it.”
Harry smiles, suddenly overcome with the near-giddiness of having Draco like this—his satiny skin and his smell and obvious arousal. He lifts his head to give Draco a soft kiss.
I tried to imagine what it would be like for him after I had gone, week after week, month after month, with nothing but Thestrals and ravens for company. I pictured him cooking meals that he would eat by himself in his silent, half-furnished house, and opening the next Christmas hamper alone.
Now Harry knows that leaving England was one of the best decisions he’s ever made.
consists of one person, and one person only. It isn’t unheard of for Harry to drop by after work without sending an owl first, and if Draco can’t offer him much in the way of refreshments, at least he can entertain him in a tidy space.
,” Draco says pointedly.
“So, you’re happy. That’s what you’re saying?” Harry asks. The words come out rough and low.
If Draco wants this, Harry doesn’t think it’s in his power to refuse. He’s too far gone. The clamouring demands of his heart and body are louder than any consideration for the consequences. He nudges a leg between Draco’s and tilts forward until the tip of Draco’s nose brushes his. Draco’s fingertips find the warm skin of Harry’s lower back, just above his pyjama bottoms.
“Sleep all right?”
“Thank you for finding me in the fog,” he says, holding Draco close.
“Okay there, Harry?” Andromeda asks, glancing over while wiping the crumbs off Teddy’s chin.
Bloody hell, what are the odds he’d end up being Malfoy’s neighbour? Thousands of miles from England and in one of the biggest cities in the world? Harry would laugh if it didn’t feel like the universe was kicking him in the balls again.
Watching Malfoy drum his long, agile fingers on the upholstered arms of his chair, Harry suddenly remembers something else they share.
“That’s okay. I don’t care about that,” Harry assures him, his voice gentle.
Susannah reaches across the counter to pat Draco’s forearm. “I know you do. And we’re grateful beyond words for everything you’ve done for Naia. And for our new famous customer,” she adds with a laugh. “He’s here so often that Jerome’s going to start worrying that he has competition.”
Or rather, Harry hopes he won’t. He left a rather effusive note about the shepherd’s pie inside the plastic bag. He still doesn’t know what possessed Malfoy to feed him, but he suspects it was pity, and he’s afraid the note made him look even more pathetic.
He’s beautiful when he laughs.
?” Harry asks, appalled. “She never asked me, and I didn’t know she was making one until she brought it out. I made the biscuits because I thought they’d be easier to carry.”
“No, wait! It’s not that. I’m just… a bit rusty,” Harry said hastily. “Just give me a moment.”
“That’s no surprise. He’s another English guy, like you. Not as friendly as you are, though,” he says with a wink. “He looks like he walks around with a stick up his fancy ass.”
He laughs and rolls his eyes at Parkinson, but something inside him withers at the observation. Harry’s been trying to push down the nagging feeling that he has
“Just your standard anti-theft charms, but they either degraded over time or someone tried to tinker with them. It started stinging anyone who came into the room a couple months ago, so Mrs Willoughby owled me to come pick it up and fix it.”
, that is, even though it’s the last minute and I should have asked before. But I thought it would be okay, until this morning when I realised it
Hermione said this with such conviction that Harry almost expected a judge to materialize and declare him guilty as charged. Merlin, she was going to be a terror in the courtroom.
I shook my head. “I wanted to be someplace I could use magic without violating the Statute, if I was in serious danger and had to change back.”
“Honestly, Malfoy, if it weren’t for the debt I owe your mother, I’m not sure I could bring myself to care.”
As he’s about to pour out his tea and settle in to wait for Harry, the Floo roars. Draco looks through the kitchen doorway, anticipating the relief of seeing Harry step out of the fireplace. Instead, Weasley’s there, still wearing his uniform and looking uncertain.
Wharton nods, apparently willing to let the matter go for the time being. Draco goes to his desk with a sigh of relief. He hopes the identity of his soulmate won’t leave the shop, and that whatever gossip Wharton heard won’t make its way to ears attached to less discreet mouths.
There’s a tapping on the window just after Harry lights the hob beneath the kettle. He pushes up the sash to let Draco’s eagle owl hop inside, where she nimbly takes a treat from Harry’s fingers. Harry feels anticipation sparking in his chest as he detaches the letter from the owl’s leg and hooks a finger beneath the wax seal to open it.
it. You made moves that even a first year would know are careless.”
“That’s settled, then. I’ll send down my Patronus for you boys when lunch is ready.”
Maybe she’ll be wary at first, but Harry thinks her heart will be ready when it happens.
“Oh,” Malfoy sounds faintly surprised, but he doesn’t hesitate more than a moment to make good on Harry’s acceptance. He places his hands on Harry’s hips and aligns their bodies with only an inch or two between them, his quickening breath so close that Harry can feel it stir the air between them.
“Just at the Weasleys’ house on Sundays. There are usually enough people to toss the Quaffle around, if not for full teams. Charlie and I have Seekers games when he’s visiting from Romania, but that’s not very often.”
home. I truly wouldn’t want them to do something they’re uncomfortable with,” Draco tells him, reaching over to rest his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
He began striding against the flow of the water. I did as he suggested and transformed. At the edge of the small pool at the bottom of the waterfall, I found a stone ledge large enough to fit my human form and changed back. By the time Potter arrived, I was sitting with my bare feet in the water, kicking idly.
“Of course I did! I tried so many times that every magical establishment in London has threatened to hex me if I show my face there again.”
. He didn’t want to have to leave before he could even have a proper conversation with Draco. Harry shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and desperately tried to think of a way to help Draco that didn’t require an ability that he no longer possessed. He had never once, until today, wished that he was still a Parselmouth. It was something that he would always associate with Nagini.
Later, when the duvet has been kicked onto the floor and they’ve caught their breath, Draco’s stomach growls loudly.
Other than a few silent spells when the conversation lags, they chat easily about their days and some of the more mundane details of their lives. Harry has a flat by himself, he tells Draco, but he still owns Grimmauld Place and thinks about fixing it up someday when he wants more space. Draco relates his first intrepid adventure in a Muggle grocery store, having been advised to try it by a neighbour in his boarding house. It makes Harry laugh to hear that Draco was so overwhelmed that he pushed his trolley around for an hour before leaving with only some apples and a tin of soup that he didn’t know how to open.
“All right,” Parkinson says. “I’d like to have some games and frivolity. Treasure hunts, lawn games, and so on. The kind of things they do in Edwardian novels about genteel young people making merry and having summer romances.”
The world was white.
“Upstairs? I assume you have a bedroom up there, somewhere,” Draco says as they struggle to get back upright without losing contact with each other.
“I don’t know!” Harry says, surprisingly annoyed that Malfoy stopped kissing him. “You started it.”
Too late. He’d caught me looking.
, yes?”
“Bedroom,” Draco repeats.
Stomp, stomp, stomp.
“She does seem to enjoy your company,” Draco mused, “and she would certainly get more attention than she gets now. Do you think you would like owning a snake?”
“What’s the problem? Why can’t you do that?”
They part outside the door, with a murmured goodnight from Granger and a firm—and completely unexpected—handshake from Potter. Draco’s heart is in his throat, and he can’t manage a proper farewell before Potter turns away to follow Granger down the pavement.
Harry stands and places his empty glass in the sink. He tries not to flinch when the Fanged Geraniums twitch in their pots. “I’ll be off then,” he says. “Thanks for the water.”
The word falls out of Draco’s mouth garbled, then his throat closes up and he can barely breathe, much less speak again. He can’t move, can’t believe his eyes.
“You never answered my question the other night. How are you feeling?” Draco asks.
Clumsily, we lay down on the grass. The ground was uneven and the weight of him draped over half of me pushed a small stone into my back, but,
sent a group of kids off to finish the job you left undone. Because
There are only a few other people on the beach, most of them at the far end near the car park. Harry leads Draco in the opposite direction, towards the place where the land rises up in a bank of green grass studded with yellow flowers. The only clouds to be seen are a few broad wisps that stretch across the sky, thin as brides’ veils. The island’s certainly a different place than it was last autumn.
Then Draco saw him.
Wincing, I kept my back to him and filled my glass with an
“Great! That’s really great. So I guess I’ll be in touch, yeah? Or you can firecall me if you want,” Harry added boldly. “My address is Number 12, Grimmauld Place.”
He’d only taint the whole endeavor, if word got out. Donors wouldn’t give a Sickle to a cause linked to a former Death Eater.
“You might. And you might decide to bring someone with you. Someone from the
Harry lifts his head to squint at the clock, then levers himself into a sitting position. Draco doesn’t move away, as Harry half expects him to. Instead, he eyes Harry’s sleep-mussed hair with a fond quirk of his lips. Harry drinks in the sight of him, dressed with his usual precision with his hair tied back, and tries to reconcile it with what happened in the dark a few hours ago.
“I assume so. She must have been living on birds and mice these past two years—yes, there are mice; I can hear them in the walls. I can’t imagine someone else’s cat could have wandered all the way out here, and she doesn’t seem feral, just shy. Aren’t you, sweetheart?”
Without Harry beside him, Draco lets himself tip sideways until he’s half lying on the sofa, his dirty hands carefully curled against his chest. He feels cold, even though it’s a warm August day.
Draco racks his brain for weeks, frustrated by both his limited means and the recentness of his re-acquaintance with Harry. Finally, he finds the perfect thing on the crowded shelf of knick-knacks in the charity shop where he buys his clothes. It’s a beautiful conch shell with stripes of golden brown and white along it’s bumpy whorls and a smooth interior that’s as pink as a blush.
“When do you have to go?” Draco asks. His voice sounds rough, choked.
Granger pats his hand and says goodnight to Draco as she stands. Weasley silently follows her towards the door, acknowledging neither Harry nor Draco. When they’re out of sight, Harry leans his elbows on the table and covers his face with his hands for a moment before flagging down the server for the bill. Watching him, Draco feels his righteous anger melt into shame.
He didn’t really need to tell me that,” Harry says with a shudder. “I saw Dumbledore’s hand.”
“Both,” Greg says. “It feels nice in the shade.”
“And when you’re ordered to conduct a raid for some pathetic infraction? Or when you see one of your colleagues using his badge to harass people in the street who are just going about their business? It’s going to happen eventually if this keeps up.”
“A few medical supplies, just in case,” he explained when I inquired.
“Yes. They were… pretty rotten people. Not alcoholics, they just hated my guts and worked very hard to make my life as miserable as possible,” Harry explains with a grim laugh. “You have no idea how happy I was to go to Hogwarts.”
“Aye, she did, but most of the MacDonalds left a hundred and fifty years ago, in the Highland Clearances. They were driven off their farms or paid by the landlords to emigrate, many to Canada, Muggle and magical alike. The MacDonalds managed to hold the land where Erwina built the house because it’s a small island, and they kept it warded well, even when no one lived there. You’ll see the shell of an older house when Ernie takes you out there tomorrow.”
The next few days followed the same blueprint as the first one. After breakfast each morning, Potter gave me a pointed look that sent me towards the door. I spent cool, drizzly days under an Impervius Charm, roaming a little further afield as I got my bearings. When the sky began to grow dim or the rain too heavy, I returned to the house and kept as silent and inconspicuous as I could until Potter cooked dinner. There wasn’t any conversation, but he didn’t seem to be as irritated with my presence as he’d been the first day. I took it as a sign that I was tolerated for the time being, if not welcomed.
Draco stretches and props himself up on one elbow to look down at Harry. His hair is mussed around his face and his pale eyes are bright.
He leaves Susannah laughing when heads for the door.
“Harry,” Draco sighs, sobered again by the significance of this decision. “I would never have asked you to do that. If there was another way…”
“Have you ever been to the zoo?” Harry asks, tilting his head toward the buildings that are just visible through the trees to their left. Draco shakes his head. “I’ve brought Teddy here a few times. He’s only just stopped demanding to know why the Komodo dragons don’t have wings.”
Harry bends down to zip his rucksack closed so that Draco can’t see his cheeks colouring. “No, I think it will be fine as it is.”
“Did you use Sticking Charms for the house, hmm? Did you just slap slates onto the roof with a few waggles of your fingers? Is the loft held up with Levitating Charms?”
“All right,” Harry says, but that’s all he can manage before his throat starts closing up with emotion, reminded that the day is passing much too quickly. He pulls away from Draco with a grim smile, then starts back toward the boardwalk over the damp sand. Draco trudges after him.
“Oh, I thought you meant whatever they’re cooking in there.” Harry looks over his shoulder at the door of 2C. “It’s an English dish.”
doing something. They see Naia’s potential and they want to give her the best chance they can, even if she never gets a Hogwarts letter. That’s why they found someone to tutor her.”
Draco draws back and casts another
That same day, Malfoy catches Harry coming in from the garden for a glass of water and pulls him into the pantry for a few blissful minutes. He felt bold enough to let his fingers graze the curve of Malfoy’s arse, so he reckons the bruise on his lower back from the corner of a shelf was worth it.
, so now I’ve made it known.”
Back at Luna’s, they split up. Luna and Pansy go inside to make tea, and Greg makes a beeline for the garden. Harry follows Draco to the tent, determined to do whatever is needed to set things right with him.
He’s looking out the window, adrift among the memories of the walk home with Harry last night. Their hands brushing as they squeezed through the clusters of people waiting outside restaurants. The shy smiles exchanged in lieu of conversation. The long embrace that ended their evening together and the promises breathed into each others’ ears to see each other again soon. Very soon.
“Water?”
“It was a gift!”
“What else did we put on that list we made?” Draco asks.
“We almost missed it,” he says, holding out the small, ceramic ashtray to Harry.
If Draco were in danger, he wouldn’t have asked Harry to wait a full day before coming to his aid. Still, Harry indulged in a brief fantasy that involved him rescuing Draco from a ruthless band of desperate… somethings. And being rewarded with Draco’s admiration and gratitude. Very
, then kept it hidden away in the Outer Hebrides for Merlin knows how many decades.”
“Because it would have been seen as trying to avoid punishment! It would be exploiting our connection for my own benefit,” Draco shouts. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. “Don’t think I didn’t consider doing it. I was terrified, absolutely terrified about going to Azkaban. But I decided that I needed to serve whatever punishment the Wizengamot ordered. I needed to admit responsibility for the things I did and do penance for them before I could ever think about telling you.”
“You’ll just have to wait and see, won’t you?”
“Could what?”
Scorpius is a miniature of his father, save for Astoria’s blue eyes. The matching blond heads are bent close together as they examine something in the sand, and Harry can see that Draco’s trying to explain something. Scorpius, however, gets impatient before long and pulls Draco by the hand back toward the water.
“Oh, we don’t think she did anything to the house. I’ve been all through and nothing’s happened to me, ha, ha!”
“Well, someone will be soon, I’m sure, and they might not like something that sounds like a stomping troll over their heads. It’s a decent flat,” Susannah explains to Harry and Draco, “but the landlord is particular about who he’ll take. We usually end up with good neighbors, so I can’t complain.”
Draco’s coming to Scotland with Harry, the letter informs him.
“Are you upset I didn’t make you a birthday cake?” Harry blurts out.
charm change to eight o’clock. He smoothed down his button-down shirt, patting his lower back to make sure it was still tucked neatly into his jeans, and rapped on the door. Draco opened the door so abruptly that Harry was startled into taking a step back. He was wearing the midnight blue waistcoat with the silver buttons shaped like tiny cauldrons, Harry noticed.
Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the faintest idea what he’d rather do instead. At a time when his friends are eager to begin their adult lives, Harry feels so weighed down with grief and regret that he can’t move forward at all.
The room is warm from the afternoon sun, even with the window open to let in some air. Draco catches the faint scent of sweat beneath Harry’s cologne. He wonders how long Harry’s been waiting here reading—
I watched silently as Potter ran a hand over his mouth, seeming to struggle with something in his mind. Finally, he sighed in resignation and stepped toward me.
He reaches into the top drawer and pulls out a square bottle and two glasses, and sets them on top of the chest of drawers.
“Please come in,” he says, stepping back to allow Harry go ahead of him into the flat.
Draco calls from the kitchen, where he’s frying sausages and eggs, “It’s too cold. And wouldn’t we have to take a train to get there?”
“All right. If you really want to.” Draco sinks onto a cushion next to the phonograph and flips through the stack of records beside it. “I won’t stop you.”
Draco tilts his head back against the wall behind him and looks at the stars through the window. Despite his scorn for the Muggle stories—which he expressed to Blaise with as much condescension as his fourteen-year-old self could manage—he did consider what he’d ask for, given the chance. While he would have loved to prevail against Potter just once, even his child self knew better than to waste a precious opportunity by wishing for a short-lived schoolyard victory. He already had more gold than he could ever spend, a guaranteed place at the apex of British wizarding society, and no small opinion of his own cleverness and good looks. And although his father expected Draco to share his appetite for power and influence, he secretly longed for something simpler. Something that seemed to elude him since he arrived at Hogwarts.
“You breed reptiles for potions ingredients?” Harry said, aghast.
“She could have ruined everything, taking it out on us,” Greg says sadly. “I don’t understand why it’s so hard for people to just keep their ruddy mouths shut.”
worried, he knows the situation must truly be serious.
“Yeah, sorry I woke you.”
Harry grins. “Are you charmed?”
“Oh,” Harry says. “You dodged them.”
“Where is this?” I asked when he stood to take his pot to the sink.
He and Malfoy don’t speak again until they’re in front of Malfoy’s door. Harry can still detect the faint smell of burnt food, even now.
We were walking with Zoë on the highest ridge of moorland on the far side of the stream from his house. The hills were lushly green around us, the sky dotted with bright, slow-moving clouds whose size was almost too enormous to fathom. It was a perfect day, and yet I was dissatisfied.
He couldn’t help feeling a little triumphant that he was privy to this small piece of Draco’s life, even one that Draco found irritating. Hermione was right; this was much better than the random bits of information that Harry had collected about Draco from afar. He felt the same way he did when he had a promising lead on a case, as if he were finally getting somewhere.
“Speaking of glamorous cases, I have a big one I’m thinking of taking. An entire house with dozens of cursed objects, up in Scotland.”
) and some TV after his nap sound just fine. There’ll be other Saturday nights. The city will still be here.
changed that day, and now they can’t—”
“Twat,” Malfoy calls after him.
“Markus was a fool,” Wharton tells him. “A few Galleons to the right people would have kept the Ministry out of his shop. Now the landlord’ll evict him for sure, for the trouble he got himself into. Been there for over ten years and did good business, too.”
Harry lifts his hands to Draco’s waist and slides them upward around the back of Draco’s shoulders. “Some gambles are worth it, if the reward is great enough.”
important to me,” Potter laughs. “And I really want to give it a go with you. Dating. And stuff.”
He’s reminded of a cone-shaped shell that he found on a French beach when he was a child. Draco’s mother told him that it belonged to a kind of snail that lived in the sea. Nothing lived in that particular shell any longer—the tip was broken off, leaving a hole into which Draco pressed his pinky finger as he sat in the hot sunshine. He lamented to his mother that the shell was imperfect, ruined by some unknown force or collision. Still, he held it for a long time, tracing his fingertip around the spiral from the delicate rim of the opening down to the break, relishing the startling moment when the smooth surface changed to a jagged edge.
who was somehow responsible for saving everyone again.”
“You didn’t need to cook for me,” Draco says when he arrives in the kitchen.
He begins to tilt his head to kiss Draco, but pulls away when a group of people approaches on the pavement.
It burns like a bitter potion in his throat.
“No, I don’t want to be near people, not even Muggles. That was the entire point of buying this place. And no one’s forcing me to do it. It was my choice.”
The conversation turns back to the Knockturn school as they’re finishing their entrees.
Not that the trip was likely, anyways. Draco received a letter from his mother yesterday, relaying—in her delicate and carefully-worded way—that the relatives with whom she lives made it clear to her that Draco isn’t welcome there. He wonders, indifferently, if he has been burned off the family tapestry in Great-Aunt Marie-Célèste’s parlour. The irony that his crimes had been committed out of loyalty to his family is undoubtedly lost on all of them.
