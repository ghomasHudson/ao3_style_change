to know. You think that just because you kissed me a few times, just because I stayed with you, you’re entitled to demand answers I don’t wish to provide?”
Harry nodded once in acknowledgement but otherwise did not respond. He dropped his gaze to the bags in his hands, absently hefting them as he mulled something over. Content to avoid the subject, Draco did nothing to break the ensuing silence.
"I had a brilliant idea," Draco proclaimed one evening, as Harry booted up his laptop and Draco pulled the popcorn from the microwave. "I think we should watch that drama you were in."
His hands stopped their movements a second later when Draco suddenly remembered that it was already Christmas Day and he hadn't managed to buy Harry a present. He briefly contemplated the merits of staying in bed all day and ignoring reality in the hope that it would cease to exist, but the fragments of the previous night's nightmare that still danced behind his eyelids spurred him into action.
“But you aren’t okay now!” Harry exclaimed, voice rising in volume. “Why are you hiding this from me? Why don’t you trust me?”
Far from being placated, Harry scoffed in disbelief. “You’re not exactly giving me much reason to trust you right now,” he pointed out. “You’re refusing to tell me anything. The way you’ve been acting over the last couple weeks is enough to tell me that things won’t be okay, not anytime soon.” He fell silent for a moment, before continuing with a short laugh, “I guess I should have seen this coming. If you don’t want to be with me anymore, you can tell me.”
Draco would have been ashamed to admit that the diversionary tactic worked, forcing him to close the laptop after watching only three episodes, had his body not been singing with pleasure. He turned his attention to Harry instead, returning his ministrations in kind.
Draco let his hand drop from Harry's back when he felt certain that Harry would continue moving without Draco's guidance. His hands clenched into fists as well, mirroring Harry's, as anger washed over him anew. This wasn't the Harry he knew. This wasn't the Harry who had coaxed Draco out of his shell with promises of happiness and freedom. This was a Harry he had only glimpsed once before, and that, too, for scarcely a split second-when he had asked Harry about the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.
"You're not getting anything?" Harry asked Draco as they joined the queue for the register so Harry could purchase the myriad items he was juggling.
He withdrew further into himself, unwilling to give Harry any indication of just what was inspiring such terror in him. When Harry snuck into the shower with him in the mornings, wrapping his arms lazily around Draco’s waist, Draco shrugged him off under pretense of not being able to move and steadfastly ignored the hurt expression Harry bore as a result. When Harry brought back takeout from Draco’s favorite Chinese place, Draco couldn’t taste it through the guilt and fear clogging his throat. He barely remembered to thank Harry for the kind gesture.
Draco remained frozen and wide-eyed, unable to respond. Then Potter's lips covered his own, and he finally found himself able to move. He pressed into that delicious friction, giving back just as good as he got. He registered Harry pushing him into the door and welcomed the support when, just seconds after latching onto Draco's, Potter's lips ghosted up his jaw to his ear. "Definitely not cold as ice," Potter whispered. Draco shivered involuntarily.
Shaking the disquiet from his mind, Draco trudged through the snow until he reached a small copse of trees at the far end of the grassy field that made up most of the park. Bare though they were, the trees were deceptively secluded, serving Draco's purpose perfectly. Despite the lack of potential onlookers in the park, Draco wanted every ounce of privacy he could get.
Draco’s voice was shaking by now, and he took a moment to close his eyes and focus on breathing. Yaxley’s smirk surfaced, unbidden, in his mind’s eye, taunting him from that snow-blanketed grove, reminding him of how much he had to lose. But he’d lost it all already, so what shred of pride was he clinging to so desperately? Why was he still so afraid of saying the one thing he hadn’t—the one thing he most needed to?
"I suppose you think I should make it up to you?" he drawled. He had reached his room by now, and he slipped his key into the lock so he could open his door.
Briefly, Draco wondered why he was trying to push Potter away in the first place. What would be so bad about letting him in? Potter certainly seemed as though he knew the meaning of discretion, and he acted like he was genuinely interested in Draco. Selfishly, Draco tried to convince himself that it would be fine to see where things went with Potter.
Still, better safe than sorry. Draco forced Potter to remain still for another minute before signalling to him that the coast was clear. Potter slowly crawled out and stood. He stretched to relieve his cramped muscles and brushed off the dust his legs had collected. Draco took advantage of his obvious distraction to assess him.
Except he wasn’t under any covers. He was still curled up on the floor, his arm numb from being used as a pillow the night before. He pawed about until he found his phone and opened one bleary eye as he clicked the home button. The screen remained dark save for a flashing image of an empty battery, drawing a groan from Draco.
When Draco reached the correct floor, he paused for one more brief moment, squaring his shoulders before turning the corner and coming face-to-face with Potter, who was sitting at the same desk Draco had been sitting at when they first met. Draco strode forward and sat at the other chair pulled up to the desk, presumably by Potter since Draco didn't remember the desk ever having had a second chair any of the numerous times he had used it. Neither boy said anything.
Draco could had done some awful things in previous years, but he was done with them now. There was nothing for Draco to fear here. He would not let phantoms of his past haunt him in the safe haven he had created for himself.
Harry only laughed, the sound much louder than was probably appropriate in a bookshop, and that was when the appearance an aggravated employee prompted them to flee the bookshop as well for fear they would be ejected for their unruly behavior.
"Just a few popular adverts," Draco said in disbelief. "That somehow has the half the females here and a quarter of the males besides running after you like you're Colin Firth. Don't think I didn't notice how that girl glared at me," Draco continued accusingly as Potter began sputtering out a protest, "as though expecting me to know you without even needing a description."
He only realized his mistake when he sunk into his customary seat near the front of the lecture hall and draped his coat over the back of his chair, exposing his arms in the process. His
He stayed like that for a minute, letting himself wallow in embarrassment and self-recrimination. His words from the previous night barrelled through his mind, making it difficult to think straight. Then he dragged himself out of bed and headed to the bathroom to transform himself into something resembling human. He returned to his room to wallow some more and then, having done a suitable amount of that, to organize his thoughts regarding Potter and figure out how to proceed.
“You’ve given me a lot of grief, Draco,” Lucius said finally, disdain dripping from every word. “Throwing tantrums, running away without a word. Do you have any idea how frantically I worked to mitigate the fallout of your sudden disappearance? And now, this fantasy you’re entertaining of studying law… I won’t abide this insolence anymore. You’ve had enough time to work this rebellion out of your system. I’m bringing you home, Draco.”
Wow, this chapter got...kind of out of hand, lol. It also took me 6 months to write. I'm really sorry for the delay, and I hope the length of this chapter makes up for it!
And all the while, Draco was left waiting. Waiting, and planning, and preparing. He refused to admit defeat. He refused to return to the Death Eaters and be his father’s pawn once more.
Instinctively, Draco pulled at the hem of his sleeve, even as he said, “No, it’s nothing like that. It’s just a nightmare, I promise.” He turned to look Harry in the eyes, attempting to infuse as much sincerity into his voice as he could.
He trailed behind Harry as the other boy deliberated over what to order, offering only a small shrug to Harry when he what flavor ice cream Draco wanted. He ended up asking for a scoop each of mint chocolate chip and vanilla in the same bowl, blushing slightly at his boldness when he placed it firmly on the table between him and Draco. He produced two spoons and waved one at Draco, waiting for Draco to take it before digging into the ice cream with his own.
His father drew his eye first. Lucius stood regally as always, his left hand placed behind his back, his right resting on a cane adorned with an elaborately carved snake’s head, his shoulders drawn back and his spine ramrod straight. It was a familiar posture; Draco had spent a year learning to emulate it. A bulky shape interrupted Lucius’ silhouette at the right hip, and though Draco was too far away to distinguish any details, he knew he was looking at a pistol.
Harry chuckled. “Waiting for the post-Christmas sales?” he joked. “Wish I’d thought to do that.” The statement coaxed a quiet laugh from Draco. He took a moment to silently appreciate the fact that Harry was giving him an out.
“He’s a friend,” Draco said, forcing himself to say the final word without stumbling. It was a last-ditch attempt to regain control of the situation, but he knew already that he had failed.
When Draco arrived, he knew immediately this would not be one of those afternoons. Harry’s expression was stormy, and his lips curved in an angry frown.
Draco grimaced. "I certainly don't," he said with a disdainful snort. "All that sweat and bodily contact. It's utterly undignified."
Anger bloomed bright and acerbic in the back of Draco’s throat. Anger at Yaxley, for digging up a past Draco had wanted to bury and forcing him into this choice; anger at Harry, for continuing to press the issue and, childishly, for not realizing Draco was being reticent for Harry’s sake; anger at himself, for growing complacent enough to acquire something he couldn’t afford to lose.
Behind the wheel was Dolohov, another Death Eater and a close friend of Yaxley’s. Lucius had been fond of him; he was a quick shot and deadly accurate, earning him his position as Lucius’ guard when Lucius met with suppliers or other gang leaders. Draco knew he would find no sympathy, much less assistance, on this front.
Still, Draco understood where Potter was coming from. He inclined his head in acknowledgement. "We all have our secrets," he agreed. His own were largely encapsulated by a stupid mistake, burned forever into the flesh of his left forearm and symbolizing a stretch of Draco's life he was glad to have left behind him. He and Potter were silent for a stretch, caught up in old memories.
He had let his walls crumble, and what did he have to show for it? A broken heart, and fear eating away at his mind. Well, he could rectify that mistake now, could encircle himself with barbed wire to keep outsiders at bay. What did it matter if he couldn’t leave, so long as no one else could enter and hurt him again?
Harry smiled good-naturedly. "I'll be fine here," he reassured his friend. "You should go, though, or you won't make it to the airport in time."
Potter put paid to that strategy roughly two seconds after Draco closed the door behind him, and really Draco should have seen that coming as Potter seemed to have a penchant for ruining all of Draco's carefully constructed plans.
With an easy shrug and an air of lazy triumph, Lucius replied, “Two bodies are just as easy to dispose of as one.”
“What if I refuse?” Draco asked, his eyes trained on the pistol. He wrapped his fingers around the grip and tilted it back and forth, testing its weight. It gleamed faintly in the dim light, and the heft of it against Draco’s palm was comforting in its familiarity. Despite himself, Draco felt some of his fear recede now that he had a way to defend himself.
"I will," Draco reassured him. "Listen, I have to go, I have a lot of work to do tonight. I'll talk to you tomorrow." He barely waited for Harry to say his own farewell before he hung up and let the phone drop heavily to his bedcovers.
“You will fail,” Lucius spat. “If you imagine wiping your slate clean to be as easy as running away, you are a bigger fool than I ever imagined you to be. Do you think you can simply drop a curtain between your past and future and separate yourself from the things you’ve done? Do you think your future clients, your future colleagues, will see your Mark without knowing exactly who you are? Who you were, who you could have been?”
Draco felt he was punch-drunk on happiness and adrenaline. He couldn't remember having laughed this hard or for this long any time in the past several years, and yet after leaving the bookshop he and Harry hadn't stopped giggling like schoolchildren until they were two streets away. They walked aimlessly, paying no heed to where they went, until Draco absently checked his phone and was floored to realize it was already time for him to get to class.
Draco’s eyes flashed. “No!” He was so vehement it made Harry jump. “Your body is your body, Harry. You shouldn’t be any more ‘chill’ about someone touching it than you want to be.”
“Yes,” Draco rubbed Harry’s back, “clothes removal can be arranged. Anything else? Or is this just a show and tell kind of deal?”
“That’s understandable,” said Draco. “May I…?” Draco lifted the arm nearest Harry, seeking permission to put it around Harry’s shoulders. Harry nodded, rearranging himself on the sofa so he could snuggle under Draco’s arm, resting the back of his head against Draco's chest. Somehow it was easier to feel vulnerable like this, held and not looking directly at Draco.
Harry smiled, arms crossed, one elbow hugged tight to his chest. “Yeah. Yes. I’ve heard of it. I even thought I might be asexual for a while, but I’m not. At least, I’m pretty sure that I’m not…” Harry rubbed his nose. Draco waited patiently for him to continue.
Draco laughed, and curled himself around Harry’s back, pulling the covers over them. Harry felt safe. Draco had cared for him, listened to him, and helped him in ways that made Harry feel needed and strong, not needy and broken. It occurred to Harry that there wasn’t anyone else in his life he would be comfortable spooning while naked. With Draco it was easy. Harry closed his eyes and remembered the way Draco had touched him while they kissed, the way Harry’s skin had tingled, his stomach tightened. He remembered Draco spread in front of him, cock hard and eyes smouldering. The noises Draco had made as Harry had touched him, the taste and feel of his skin on Harry’s tongue. The memories were getting Harry hard, which was a bit odd given that the actual actions hadn’t at the time. Tentatively, Harry palmed his cock. Yep, he was already most of the way up.
“I think what you’re trying to say is ‘thank you, Harry for pulling strings so I can train with my Quidditch heroes, even though they are not on your team,’” said Harry, crowing.
fan attending matches. Draco’s reverence left him speechless – a shocking first – so Harry struck up a conversation with Birch about his days playing in the league and for England, then hinted heavily that Draco might appreciate an autograph. After Birch and Davidson had signed every item Draco owned and had to hand, as well as some random napkins he had filched from the club, they headed out to the pitch.
“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “But I’m still sorting out a few of the logistics, and I want it to be a surprise. Your date is next up, anyway. Saturday, right? Have you chosen what we’re doing yet?”
Harry shrugged, “So I can wear muggle clothes. There’s a super-strict dress code for those events and I was venting about it to Hermione one day, and she suggested I wear muggle clothes as an up-yours to all the pure-blood bigots who wrote it in the first place. It’s very effective as an up-yours – they really hate it –   but I can only get away with it if I ensure that what I’m wearing would be sufficiently formal in a muggle setting. Then if they don’t let me wear the stuff, I can make an official complaint about prejudice towards muggle-born customs. They only tried it once and there was so much of a fuss they gave up.”
“My pleasure. Now, you said something about wanting to touch my cock? Let’s not get distracted from what’s important here,” said Draco, grinning. “Would you like me to sit, or to lie down?”
, said Harry’s brain. Desire and possibly arousal. Oh fuck. Harry could feel the beginning of a blush prickle the back of his neck.
“Naturally that works. After all, bodies only have so many different holes and appendages, and human emotions are alarmingly similar. There are really only so many ways of writing ‘I think this person is hot, they think I’m hot, so let’s get together and orgasm all over the place in improbable ways.’ You don’t actually have to have
“Settle down, Draco. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, embarrassing as in it’s a public date with a
“I bought it to wear to Ministry events, when they insist on hauling me in as their favourite show-pony to impress dignitaries and the general public.”
“Stay,” he said, quickly. He didn’t want Draco to sound like that, like he was terrified and broken. “Please stay. It’s alright, well… it wasn’t, but… I just got a fright. You didn’t do anything wrong, it’s understandable you would think… I mean, that did seem to be where it was going…”
“You wouldn’t see anything! There are separate girls showers, with cubicles and everything.” Harry objected.
“I know. But it’s easier for me to focus on you at the moment, touching you, enjoying your arousal. I don’t want to be touched myself right now, but you enjoying yourself makes me feel good. If you would like me to do that.”
Draco appeared with two cups and saucers, a teapot, milk jug, sugar bowl, and plate of chocolate biscuits bobbing along behind him. With a flick of his wand everything settled on the coffee table and he sat and carefully poured tea for the both of them.
way. So, anyway. Ginny was really upset; she thought that it meant that I found her too ugly to fuck. We broke up not long after that, it wasn’t great.”
“Er… not offended exactly.” Harry didn’t meet Draco’s eye. “It's just that I haven’t, you know. Had sex. That is.”
“I’m not… Harry, what the fuck? Sex Author? Since when… I mean… you do realise that isn’t a thing? As in, that is not a job title. No one when heading up a CV in the history of ever has put ‘Sex Author’ under work experience.”
was a good idea for a second date. Harry didn’t even know what one wore to the muggle opera and it wasn’t like he had a huge selection of people to ask: Hermione’s parents were Classic Rock snobs and they were the only muggle adults Harry had any real connection with anymore. In the end he decided on the white waistcoat and black tails that he wore to formal events at the Ministry, by which point he was running late for Draco’s ridiculously early meeting time: half an hour before the curtains raised was just over the top.
“No idea,” said Harry, “being straight was never my problem.” Then belatedly “...Oi! We’re no more backward than…”
“I think it would be good to… er… what I meant to say is… I’d like to establish… to, er, discuss as it were, what exactly we are to each other.”
“Weird, really how much has changed. That having sex before marriage was seen to be completely evil. It isn’t even that long ago, really. Dumbledore would have been about our age the first time that opera was performed.”
“There’s nothing wrong with being a virgin, Draco. I’m hardly going to laugh at you, I too, am also a virgin. We have established this.”
“Oh, Harry, yes. Yes, of course. Whatever you like. I’m fine with slow, slow is my favourite. We can do as much or as little as you like.”
Harry read the synopsis; it was grim. Harry wasn’t sure what kind of topics he had expected an opera to cover, but he was sure that a man disfiguring a woman out of jealousy because she would not marry him, a blow-by-blow on the shame of a 19th century out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and infanticide were not what he had expected. The house lights dimmed and the conductor picked up his baton. Beside him, Draco shifted in his chair, alive with anticipation. Harry swallowed. The opera began.
The seats were nice, red velvet with plenty of legroom and close enough to occasionally share body-heat with Draco without actually looking like that was what Harry was doing.
“No, no. Your bow tie is fine,” said Draco, waving a hand. Draco wasn’t wearing a tie: he was wearing a sheer gauzy black collared shirt that was open at the throat; a dark red waistcoat that matched the detailing on his slacks, his eyebrow ring, and his pocket handkerchief; and a French-blue sleek sparkly blazer. Harry swallowed, Draco looked properly hot. He was also still talking at Harry about Harry’s clothes.
Harry pulled a face. “Here I was thinking that despite the posh décor and exorbitant prices, the food was at least likely to be good. Now I suspect this is all just a swanky aesthetic aimed to con money out of a clientele with more status anxiety than taste.”
“Oh, you complete fucker.” Draco punched him in the arm, and Harry grinned. “You invited Brevis Birch and Robyne Davies from the
Harry’s stomach dropped. He walked towards Draco, rolling his unfastened sleeves up past the elbow as he went. He leant in to whisper his reply in Draco’s ear, “I’ll cum for you later, if you’re very good.”
“No, no. I insist on taking the credit for that. It was entirely my doing and I won’t hear otherwise.”
It was worse than usual, however, because that woman was the first of many to attempt to bring up the issue in one way or another. It was infuriating. Draco kept up to date with current events as best he could, but he was clearly missing something. It made him uneasy, and he itched to bury his head deeper in his metaphorical sand.
Draco opened his mouth before the realisation of the trap he just stepped in slammed into him. He stood straight and crossed his arms.
"Never saw much appeal to gardens," said a voice behind him, making Draco jump and almost fall off the bench. Noticing this, he quickly jumped down and straightened his robes before looking for whom the voice belonged.
"Sorcerian Belby has had many successes over the years," Bones contributed. Her salad was being replaced with the main course, and Draco quickly shoved a few bites of his own in his mouth before laying his fork across his plate to signal he was finished. His plate, too, was replaced.
Out here, he could almost pretend he was little again. Sneaking out with his starter broom to practise flying. Hiding his governess' reading glasses in the shrubs. Chasing the peacocks into them to watch his parents argue which were more important: the peacocks or gardens. That last one stopped working when he was nine.
"But what about the rumours of the debates in the Sorcery Courts, Mr Malfoy? Is there any truth to the in-fighting behind closed doors?"
He took a magician carriage to the gallery. The gallery was at the Royal Academy in London and was the starting location for this gala event, which he was pretty sure was for raising money for higher magician education. Starting locations usually frequented magicians who were not quite elite enough to warrant an invitation to the main event, but were influential and famous enough to be expected. Along with them would be the elite Muggles such as the Prime Minister and the Court Royals, but only a handful of them were ever invited to the main event as well.
"The Muggles apparently have it on good authority that a couple of Sorcerian Masters are developing a potion that will eliminate any threats lycanthropians pose."
Draco successfully avoided being cornered by Sorcerians Thicknesses, Umbridge, Jorkins, and Edgecombe. When he spotted Sorcerian Master Snape, he rushed toward him.
Draco wasn't very close with Regulus, even though out of the rest of the family, he was closer to the man than others. When he was younger, he was practically Regulus' shadow. Regulus was everything their family demanded a proper Sorcerian to be. When his older brother was disowned, Regulus stepped up and became the heir of the House Black. He mastered most of all branches of magic, becoming more than a mere magician or even Sorcerian but a proper witch, wizard, and warlock (his official title being Sorcerian Warlock Master Sir Regulus Black, Magician of Witchcraft and Wizardry), and despite that, he was always present in the courts, using his great influence and fame to navigate the water in his family's favour.
Draco forced him to snigger in agreement, trying not to think about just how much those regulations had changed. Before he could steer the subject to more small talk, a voice to Draco's right interrupted.
Draco sighed and looked forlornly at his tea. He was already dressed in his gala-best, and if Wadpey was fetching him, he was very close to being later than what was fashionable. With a gut full of dread, Draco dumped his tea and locked up his lab.
Once he actually began participating in politics, he quickly learned that it was less that the politicians cared about the people they were supposed to represent and more that they cared about their vaults. He had yet to meet a politician who hadn't drastically changed their political opinions and votes over the years. Particularly if they had recently dined with the infamous, long-standing political leader, Sorcerian Riddle.
The sweet smell of his tea caught his attention, and he rose from one of his many desks with a journal still in hand to strode down to where it was boiling. He removed the kettle from the gas burner he had there and chewed his lip as he pulled milk from one of his Muggle iceboxes.
“Ok, don’t take this the wrong way. But isn’t sex something that requires, er… a more practical approach than say, reading a report?”
“Right. I mean, just down to shirtsleeves and slacks, I don’t want to be completely starkers just yet.”
in 2001, after their last seeker retired. It was a fun job and suited Harry better than working for the Aurors. Escapism might not be a particularly healthy coping method for dealing with war trauma, but it was working better for him than murder investigations and hunting down potions smugglers. Harry enjoyed the camaraderie of team sport and the physical nature of the work was rewarding. He wasn’t keen on the fame aspect, but at this point it was impossible to be more famous than he already was, so playing professional quidditch didn’t make things any worse.
“That,” said Draco, landing with his plastered sweatily all over his face, “was quite possibly the best date of all time.” He was so happy that Harry felt his ire over his 15-12 defeat evaporate. He didn’t even have the heart to take the piss, or to point out that half of his team had been geriatric, and not only had half of Draco’s been fighting fit, but also England’s best chaser. Instead, he just hugged him. Draco cupped Harry’s jaw and kissed him, while Davidson whooped and wolf-whistled.
“I declare this topic closed. We need a new one. For the love of Merlin pick something civil this time.”
Harry shook his head, and then bit his lower lip, thinking. “Could we take off our clothes? I would like to see you…” Harry stumbled over the words, blushing.
– and all of a sudden you find you’re in stitches? Also, it was very surprising. Your whole career revolves around writing erotica – sorry, romance novels. But honestly Draco, there is
Except Draco’s clothes were significantly more revealing than Harry’s: that blasted gauze shirt. Now his waistcoat was off, Harry could see Draco’s nipples. As in, it was difficult to keep his eyes off them. Fortunately, Draco appeared not to have noticed, he was too busy looking at him as though Harry were sex on legs. Harry’s brain had been right; Draco’s unidentified expression from earlier in the evening had been that of desire. Now Draco wasn’t masking it, this was obvious. Harry shivered. Draco stretched out on the settee, arms thrown wide over its back, one ankle hooked over his knee.
Harry submits gratefully to Draco’s attentions, seemingly relieved to no longer be responsible even for something as meaningless as a quick scrub, let alone trying to explain what’s going on in his head. “Turn for me,” Draco says into his ear, and Harry lets out a breath and revolves, his eyes closed, granting Draco easier access to his front.
“And you’re doing so well,” Draco said with a small smile. Potter shivered at the praise, which Draco filed away for future reference. He shuffled closer, placing his legs in between Potter’s, and reached around Potter’s chest with both hands. He ran them tantalizingly slowly from collarbone to midriff, stopping to toy with the other man’s nipples, feeling them start to harden under his touch. Potter leaned back against him, seeking more stimulation of his hyper-sensitive skin the longer that Draco played with it.
Harry laughed. “I’m not a food critic,” he said. “I don’t need an objective, logical rating system for when I get hungry. I just like a bit of variety.”
Harry smiled. “To new opportunities,” he said, lifting his mug. It was a sentiment that he truly meant, but it was also tinged with sadness. He really would miss Draco’s cantankerous, prickly presence every day in the office.
“You have to admit, it’s very suspicious,” Harry said, taking a step closer.”Five years since the trials and there’s no sign of you, and then you just
“Did you do this?” Harry asked. He could feel himself smiling as he looked about the gaily-decorated room.
“The intern! Robards got us one of the summer interns from the evidence department, and you wouldn’t stop making fun of him behind his back. You called him Little Lord Fauntleroy, which, honestly, coming from you is really quite something.”
“Merlin,” Draco muttered. “Ok, look. I’ll make you a deal, Potter. If you read… Oh, I don’t know, the first few pages of that book, after that I’ll explain everything.”
Malfoy tsked impatiently. “When you’re just starting to make an impression on the clay. What does the process feel like to you?”
“Make something,” Malfoy suggested as if it were obvious. “Or don’t. Whatever you want.” He sat down at his wheel again and appeared to consider his work, seemingly prepared to ignore Harry completely.
“I talked to the portraits in the Manor,” Malfoy says casually, not rising to the bait. He’s roaming around Harry’s workshop as they talk, looking at everything. He reaches out to minutely adjust the angle of a framed picture of Hogwarts that’s hanging on the wall, and Harry itches to tell him to keep his hands to himself. “They trust me, you know. I started asking questions about family scandals, and they were falling all over themselves to tell me whatever they knew or suspected.”
“Potter?” Draco asked, and Harry looked up to find that Draco was looking at him funnily. “Should we end a bit early today and get a start on that first thing tomorrow?”
Harry walked to his desk and sat down, his mood buoyed. He glanced at the top few sheets of parchment awaiting him before dismissing them; he didn’t feel like studying the summer intern’s transcriptions of arrest statements at the moment. Below those were a deep stack of annotations about Pensieve recordings which looked more interesting.
“I would,” Harry said. He met Malfoy's gaze and he tried to convey… he wasn't really sure what, but he knew he wanted to spend more time around Malfoy. He wanted to solve this new mystery. “I really would.”
Uncharacteristically, Draco seemed hesitant. “It’s about us,” he finally said, and Harry suddenly found it hard to breathe, as if all the oxygen were being sucked out of the room.
“I refuse to allow the fact that you’re so easily distractible to affect my grades, Potter,” Draco said haughtily. He braced himself for a battle of wills; he didn’t know what he would do if Harry refused to interact with his missing memories. His whole plan depended on it. “We’re not going anywhere unless you finish that book.”
“So the book is a… representation of my missing memories?” Potter asked uncertainly. “This is extremely weird.”
Harry grinds his teeth and breaks eye contact, turning back to the wand. Somehow when Draco is being a prat it actually makes the desire to go to him stronger, and he can’t really spare any concentration to unpack that right now. Placing one of the hairs he took from Draco in the centre of the two wand segments, he grabs a bottle of wood glue and spreads it carefully along both lengths of wood.
be considered an emergency. It would certainly give Harry the ability to deliver the wand to him quickly and not look like a creeper, just a helpful Auror looking out for his partner’s well-being. That was fine, wasn’t it?
“Remember,” Malfoy said gently. “You can stop the wheel at any time if you’d prefer not to continue. All you have to do is take your foot off the pedal.”
” He ostentatiously opened it to the first page and began to read, then looked up and caught Draco’s gaze. “Don’t watch me,” he said. “It makes it hard to focus, knowing that you’re just standing there staring at me.”
He had hardly gone twenty steps when his mobile rang, and he had to fumble in his coat pocket for it. He always felt ridiculous answering it in public, but modern society demanded these inconveniences.
the words run the length of his body, feels himself hardening in response. He gulps a breath; his mouth is dry all of a sudden.
Looking back towards the entrance to the church, Harry saw the greeter watching him, and she gave him a cheerful thumbs-up. Feeling foolish, Harry found a pew in the back that was largely empty and tried not to call attention to himself as he took a seat in it as quickly as possible. His immediate needs addressed, he finally allowed himself a moment to look around and take in the rest of the service.
"Indeed. Although, it's more of a glorified garden if you ask me. He's done very well for himself, however. He's one of the top five suppliers in Wales."
If Draco was agreeable to Nott, to Slytherins and their causes, he could go into the Royal Court, cast his ballot against the Goldsteins, and his one vote would count as much if not more than six Muggle ones. Because he was highly influential, many other epistocratics would likely follow his lead. If he had the mind to, Draco could single-handedly influence the Goldsteins right into Azkaban.
, Draco thought. "Not at all," he lied. "The award was for something else entirely. A happy—but accidental—discovery in the lab."
"Quite." Nott finally took a sip of his tea, and Draco was lamented to see he had almost finished his own.
When he was young, it all seemed so simple. There were people who were magicians, which made them better than other people, and there were people who were magical through pure, family blood, and they were the best. Therefore, it was odd when Draco embarked into the world only to learn that actually, not many people agreed with that assessment. And then he began to meet people, non-pure-blood magicians, Muggles even, and he couldn't quite understand why he would ever believe himself superior. It had him questioning so many other values he was raised to believe, facts that turned out to be ignorant and unjust opinions, and practises that with new eyes were just cruel.
This was true, but Draco felt like he could soothe some of his guilt over his lack of participation because he had just genuinely forgotten about his last vote.
"It won't take long, you know. The Goldsteins are widely respected, and I suspect it won't take five minutes for the Court to side in their favour."
Sorcerian Snape gave him a cool look but didn't say anything. Draco was used to this. Snape did worse at these functions than he himself did.
Draco felt his frown deepen in his confusion. "The Moon Camps? I know it was proposed, but it was shot down. The Prime Minister said they were no better than the Muggle camps Grindelwald had."
Draco, both on and off the record, was un-declared. His father called that a cop-out, but it suited Draco. Perhaps most of his circle considered him a coward. Better a coward, however, than a soft, poofy cat-paw, or worse, a blood-traitor.
"So, something of Sorcerian Belby's creative imagination might actually work?" Regulus asked, doubt clear in his tone.
Bones chuckled. "I know the feeling. I used to be able to help out in other departments, but for the last few years, the cases across the dock require a lot more detailed investigation than before. I never thought I'd miss the days being bored from one of Sorcerian Crouch's lectures on international regulations."
For one, he was simply scared of werewolves. He was intelligent enough to know the fear was largely irrational, that the majority of those inflicted were only dangerous around the full moon, but then there were others. Draco wished he didn't know about them. But he reasoned that those like Greyback, a 'family friend', wouldn't want anything to do with the potion anyway. It was a safe assumption that those who would volunteer to be test subjects would be of agreeable demeanour and genuinely want the potion's success.
"It's been a pleasure," Draco nodded. "He is very intelligent and bright, and he has truly creative ideas."
Accepting Nott's very PR answer, Draco decided to move things along. "I take it, then, that I am not needed? If the Court seems that sure of a decision."
They’re quiet for another moment, then Draco reaches out for Harry’s bar of soap and carefully asks, “Would you like me to-” Harry’s already nodding against his shoulder before he’s finished the question, so he lathers up his hands in preparation. They’ve showered together before, playfully, eventually ending up pressed up against one of the walls and rutting against each other. Draco has even tortuously, sensuously washed Harry in the shower before, never breaking eye contact and avoiding touching the other man’s cock the entire time. It turns out the brain can invent entirely new erogenous zones if the usual ones are starved of attention, and Harry had been practically incoherent by the end, begging to be taken. Draco had been all too happy to oblige him.
He slowly reaches out, placing a hand on the wall next to Draco’s head. Draco darts a nervous glance at it, then meets Harry’s gaze again. He appears confused, possibly even concerned, like he’s searching for something in Harry’s face. Harry summons all his courage and attempts a smoulder for the first time in his life.
“What would you like me to say?” Malfoy asks. It’s a reasonable question, and Harry is irrationally irritated by it. He can’t split his focus between making the wand and directing the conversation as well as avoid thinking about how Malfoy is just
“It’s not the first time something like that has happened around me. This was the first one that ended in a formal complaint, though. I’m off work right now, and I’m meeting with a… a magical therapist.” Harry reminded himself of Ginny’s words, that it didn’t actually need to be a shameful admission. “I can’t go back to work until she clears me for duty. She told me she thought I should attend the class, and it was pretty clear that she wouldn’t let me return to work unless I did it.” He let out a slow breath; it felt like a knot loosening inside him.
“It was a big Auror operation,” he says quietly. “Some kind of… bust? An underground potions lab. Lots of spell damage.” He takes a deep breath, shudders a bit, and Draco doesn’t say anything, just lets him keep talking. “They just kept bringing more wounded in… all the people hurt in the raid. We kept patching them up… tried to figure out what was spell damage and what was exploding potions. When that slowed down I helped with the regular patient triage. It was really backed up. Just… stacks of charts everywhere, all these patients waiting to be seen.”
“Shut up,” Harry said, his face heating. “I just meant… I don’t know what I was expecting, but it wasn’t that.” Dragging his fingers idly around the clay that he was working, he abruptly realized that there was a reasonable approximation of a bowl taking shape beneath his hands. “Oh!” he exclaimed, taken aback. “This is starting to feel like it might actually work.”
The tips of Malfoy’s ears turn pink, but he brings his gaze up to meet Harry’s once more. “It turns out the other wand makers aren’t interested in my custom,” he says.
Harry was about to continue the argument when Robards poked his head around the door once more. “Ah, Draco, there you are. Just wanted to wish you both a Happy Christmas before I take off.” He paused as he took in the state of Harry’s desk, and seemed to notice the strained air that weighed heavy between the two Aurors. “Is everything alright?”
“Draco! So glad you could join us!” Melanie said, and Harry raised his head fast enough to get whiplash. Improbably, there was a very Malfoy-esque figure at the front of the class, exchanging friendly words with the teacher. Sure, his hair was cropped short on the sides and he was wearing some flashy, well-fitting Muggle clothes, but Harry would recognize those features and long, pointy limbs anywhere. And none of that explained why Malfoy just happened to be a student in Harry's beginner pottery class.
There’s a palpable, gaping absence when Draco finally moves his face away from Harry’s overstimulated neck, and Harry can’t keep a whimper from escaping when Draco’s hand follows.
Potter appeared to be lost in thought, however. “In fact, a lot of this feels like a dream, when I stop to think about it,” he mused. “The way we came here instantly from the library. The way the darkness…” He paused for a moment, his brow furrowed. “I’ve seen that dark cloud before,” he said slowly. “In.. an office?
It usually wasn't that difficult to find something, and sure enough, it took only a few days to run across an old letter from Sorcerian Master Damocles Belby, writing for Draco's opinion on an idea of his. The idea was intriguing, the academic and practical challenge of it enticing, and something that was sure to take up a lot of his time.
If he had the mind to, with just one vote, could steer the tides toward a storm that could change everything.
As it stood, it appeared more like Draco burying his head in the sand. He was grateful no one had yet accused him of it outright as it would be rather difficult to defend, all things considered.
Draco let himself smile. "Dray is not fine, if you please. If we must be familiar with each other, my old nickname will suffice."
Draco knew better, and tonight could potentially show exactly what kind of fight it would be to continue. If he was brave enough to test the waters.
"I imagine I've heard the same as you, which is to say the persistent rumours that if you can imagine it, somehow a magician is capable of it. That is not the case."
Therefore, something inherently more complicated, such as lycanthropy, was not technically completely Dark. Yes, it was mostly Dark, but with it also came the construction of one's strength, senses, and instincts along with a healing factor of its own. Not to mention the construction of physical traits when triggered along with the deconstruction of others.
Draco had to think a moment to know what they were discussing exactly. "Quite. The laws around rare potions ingredients get stricter every year, either by us or the Muggles."
His lab was his favourite place. He had an academic lab at a university, financed by said university where he sometimes taught or lectured. There was his work lab, one he mostly shared with Sorcerian Master Snape, which was significantly better stocked and the envy of most Masters, and then there was his personal one at home.
Theodore Nott and he had grown up together. Draco knew good and well that Nott would much rather throw the Goldsteins in Azkaban than to let them influence the Court. Or rather, some of the things the Court was being slowly manipulated to do. Draco never thought much about it growing up, but when he was old enough for his father to think he was ready to start learning the tricks of the trade, as it were, it became too clear just how easily the Court could be manipulated. The Muggles were definitely terrified of it, or rather simply of them. It was why they had a branch of government solely to focus on magic, a whole Ministry of Magic. It was to restrict the magical, but also to protect the non-magical.
"I take it you've seen the papers," Nott changed the subject. It was a purposely innocuous steer, a small trap, one Draco could always spot miles away but could never do anything about.
They had gone as far as they could go without actually introducing test subjects. Earlier that day, Draco had sent Belby another long list of other test subjects they could try before progressing to actual werewolves. Lycanthropy was a curse that only affected humans, but there were other curses that inflected other animals that were close enough to begin. Belby knew Draco was dragging his feet, but Draco couldn't help it.
Draco's soup had been replaced with a small salad, and he was enjoying chasing a walnut around his plate. Now, he laid his fork down and put on his best appeasing expression. "I do, but I'm afraid as a guest lecturer, I am limited to how potions and Muggle chemistry coincide."
"But is it true that Sorcerians are capable of casting mind-magic that can control the court members, even potentially control
a Master, in all but title. If the world wasn't in such a state of unrest, this would normally be greeted with praise.
Yes, Sorcerian Draco Malfoy fully supported the causes for which this event was, and he was encouraged to see such a diverse turnout. "It's always encouraging to see the continued good relations between our respective worlds."
He was in his private lab again, where he had spent the majority of his time the last two months to prevent anyone guessing his project nor his natural means of magic to accomplish it. He had been equipping it with more and more Muggle inventions with a few magical adjustments, and though he had noticed a small interference in some of his magical equipment, which meant eventually he would have to separate them, it wasn't enough to skew results. And they were simply a delight to use.
Draco blinked. "I assure you, the Sorcery Courts are no different than yours, ma'am. We enforce the law on ourselves just as it is enforced in joint courts. No one is being mind-controlled."
He stepped up on a stone bench to squint in the distance where the conservatory was just visible. Inside them held more precious memories, such as his mother teaching him the beginnings of herbology, his father giving him his first lecture of superior genes via magical versus mundane plants, and Sorcerian Master Snape giving him potion lessons. Inside was a perfectly innocuous pond that, in actuality, was an illegal concourse into a magical lake full of all kinds of magical creatures and aquatic plants.
when the continued debate whether or not Muggle laws kept the world safe from magicians came around. Particularly because he didn't have a good answer. "
"What are you working on now, Draco?" Regulus asked. "I believe I overheard you telling Sorcerian Bones it's in practical research."
Unfortunately, he didn't have much to occupy him now that his burn-salve had been passed to research witches.
"I heard a rumour…" Regulus opened, slowly stepping forward to make them begin walking. Draco followed, feeling an ominous chill indeed. "See, there had been a Muggle bill passing through their courts to begin new legislation against those inflicted with lycanthropy. It's more lugubrious than the others. They are suggesting detainment centres."
Bones' eyes lit up. "Absolutely. I can send you their information if you want. I know Sorcerian Longbottom gives discounts and regular delivery schedules for researchers."
They finished the trek to the first floor together, purposefully giving off an air as though they were deep in serious discussion, and were able to avoid being approached until they found their respective places among the long table covered in heavy cloth and some of Malfoy Manor's finest dinnerware. To his delight, his reserved place was across from Snape, so he hoped that would salvage some of the night.
As usual, the festive atmosphere gave way to an eager feeling of something new. Draco had learned to loathe that feeling.
Regulus stopped, gently touching Draco's arm to make him look at him. "The Sorcery Court is just confused why any Sorcerian would go to the trouble to help
He was also, Draco knew, one of Sorcerian Riddle's close associates. While both Slytherin and Gryffindor parties publicly denied their respective radical groups, the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix, and the public by and large believed them to be conspiracy rumours, Draco knew better. He knew because of his father's secret robes and a certain mark he wore on his skin. Regulus was highly regarded in almost every circle, but highest by far was within those closest to Riddle.
Between dances, Draco suffered through conversations, giving out congratulations and best wishes where they were due, engaging in sociality gossip of which he was more than passable thanks to his friend Sorcerian Pansy Parkinson (who was always up to date despite living in Egypt), and eventually leisured his way into the gardens.
Yaxley’s smirk transformed into a scowl, his displeasure at being ignored abundantly evident. Just as during their past confrontation, though, he had no leg to stand on. Disgrace or not, runaway or not, Draco remained the son of Lucius Malfoy. “You’ll find out soon enough,” Yaxley said. He finally stepped forward, pulling the door shut behind him, and stalked past Draco while typing something on his mobile. “Come on, then,” he snarled when he noticed Draco hadn’t moved. “You should know better than to keep him waiting.”
The man under the desk-Potter, Draco presumed-attempted to rise, but Draco pushed him down. "Not yet," he murmured, able to see from his vantage point that the girls were headed back their way.
He didn't bother looking back to see if Yaxley was following him. The man may have been two decades Draco's senior, but as Lucius Malfoy's son and heir, Draco enjoyed a position of authority second only to Lucius himself. Despite having left in the manner he had, Draco's command still held.
Every word was a bomb exploding within Draco’s chest, but he maintained his neutral expression. Malfoys weren’t affected by petty emotions such as fear and hurt. Malfoys didn’t express vulnerability. And Draco had been taught how to excel at being a Malfoy by the very best.
Draco’s future, Harry’s happiness, the future of their relationship—it all seemed to come down to how Draco responded to Harry’s plea. He could tell the truth, or a censored version of it anyway, and take a leap of faith. In doing so, he would be leaving himself vulnerable in a way he never had before.
In the end, Draco was little more than a self-serving creature of caution. So he pasted a smile on his face, forced his body to relax, and said, “It’s just a few nightmares. I’m sure they’ll go away soon.”
Draco bristled. "I'm not scared," he spat out, glaring at Potter. He tried to dissuade Potter one last time. "You're right that it won't last long, though. I'm broken, Potter, I don't think that's made it through that thick skull of yours."
“Now that’s what I like to hear!” Robards said. “Good work, Potter. I’m off to put the fear of God into the rest of the team. No overtime this year, or I’ll have their thumbs!” His head disappeared from the doorway, and Harry listened to the receding sound of Robards’ forceful steps.
“I think Draco might actually like it,” Harry said, thinking back to their earlier conversation. “His choice, of course. But I think he’s really interested in getting to know Andromeda, too, based on what he told me. He keeps surprising me.”
“Listen,” Harry said, pausing as they passed another alley entrance. “I should be getting home. Might as well apparate from here, but first…” He pulled Draco’s wand out of his coat pocket and held it out in front of him. “I’ll see you tomorrow, yeah?”
Malfoy tosses aside another wand in disgust, this one containing a house elf hair core, and removes another from the nearly empty box, when he suddenly goes still.
Harry eyed him, but no further explanation appeared to be forthcoming. They both stood in the entryway to the studio, looking at each other. “Well?” he said after an interminable moment of silence. “I’m here. What now?”
“Huh,” Harry says. His curiosity is definitely piqued now; he runs a hand through his hair absentmindedly, fiddles with his bun as he reevaluates what could be causing Malfoy’s problem. “You can let the spell go,” he tells Malfoy, and walks over to his collection of wands and picks a few out. A beech wand with a hair from a centaur’s forelock, oak surrounding a bit of kneazle whisker; those are well-rounded wand cores that should be broadly compatible with many different magical cores. He rummages through the box, looking for some others with similar characteristics, then reconsiders and decides to bring the whole thing over to the workshop bench instead.
Draco cracked a smile. “If you insist,” he said. “What are we toasting with?” Harry held up the unopened bottle of Ogden’s, and Draco whistled. “You have surprisingly decent taste. I was expecting some kind of alcohol that comes in a box; this is almost respectable of you.”
“I nearly hurt someone with accidental magic,” he said. “My latest partner. She was just out of training, and I was having a shittier day than usual, and all the windows in the room just imploded with no warning, and, well. She was standing right next to one.”
“You knew!” he accused Blaise. “How did it never come up before now?” He turned to look at Pansy, who gazed back at him coolly as she took a drink from her martini glass. “How long has Malfoy been doing this?”
There’s a pause. Harry resists the urge to turn and look at Malfoy, see what his reaction is. He tries to focus on the woods in front of him—is Malfoy a birch? No, that’s far too common for his dramatic personality.
Hermione elbowed him in the ribs as Ron took a drink, and he spluttered as some beer leaked down his chin.
Harry points at the wand. “There’s nothing inside that except one of your hairs,” he says. “They used to make wands with Veela hair cores; I don’t really know why they stopped, but there are still lots of older ones in use. There’s no reason that wand should work for you unless that’s a Veela’s hair that I put in it.”
“Yes!” Harry says through gritted teeth. “Now go read a book!” Setting Malfoy’s hair aside for later, he grabs his roughest sandpaper and sets the lathe turning once more. The next part requires him to hold the sandpaper against the wand as it turns, pressing down the roughest chisel marks and ensuring the surface of the wand is smooth to the touch.
“As sure as I can be,” Harry allows. “Ron’s sister-in-law is part Veela and described the wand-making process to me.” He runs his fingers along the unformed blocks of wood sitting on the shelf in front of him. He always enjoys this part, when he has to choose an appropriate base wood for the wand while considering the nature of the wizard.
“You’re insane,” Potter told him as Draco stopped climbing a few rungs below him. “Just tell me what I’m actually looking for here and we can get off this death trap.”
“I don’t. I won’t,” Harry says, almost incoherent with pleasure. “Please.” He’s not even sure what he’s asking for anymore, but the thought of Draco leaving him behind again is too much to bear.
“Yeah, I found him,” Weasley said nervously. “In his office at Hogwarts. I was dropping by as a surprise, and he was just… sitting in his chair at his desk, but slumped over. At first I wasn’t even sure he was breathing.” He shuddered. “When he wouldn’t come to, I got Madame Pomfrey. When she also couldn’t get him up we decided to stick him in the Floo to bring him here.”
Draco turned his whole body to watch this time, and once again Potter was greeted by an expanse of darkness behind the door where a corridor should be. This time, as Draco watched, the darkness appeared to flow past him, slowly but surely engulfing walls, ceiling and floor as Potter looked around himself in confusion.
“That was it,” Malfoy says, and he looks nervous. “That’s what I’m talking about. Sometimes it’s more extreme than that.”
“Well, that’s just great,” Potter groused. “Fantastic. Did you come up with any ideas for escaping this dream?”
Draco awakes to the sound of the floo spitting somebody out into the living room. He looks around him blearily; the room is still quite dark and he is damp with sweat, and he feels a fleeting sense of loss as the knowledge of whatever he was dreaming about evaporates. He listens for the sound of footsteps making their way towards the staircase to the upper level, and yes—he recognizes the sound of Harry’s tread on the steps, making his way to the bathroom. Harry likes to have a shower when he returns from St. Mungo’s; despite the protective charms they use, and their Healer robes with repellant fabrics, he says it helps him relax at home to know he’s washed everything off himself, and it’s a chance to decompress after a shift.
“How long will that take?” Draco whispers, practically in his ear. Harry lets out an involuntary gasp.
“I can’t believe we’ve learned nothing from Muggles,” Granger said angrily. “Magical attachments to wixmail! Honestly!”
Draco sighed. “Dreams aren’t real, Potter. They don’t mean anything. All of this—” He gestured around them, trying to encompass the whole ordeal they’d been through together. “It’s just your brain trying to make sense of your experiences, the same as any other night of your life. So go ahead and tell me whatever’s got you all twisted up, and I promise to be professional about it.”
Harry decides the quickest path to getting what he wants is to fulfil Draco’s desires, and apparently what he wants most in the world at the moment is the stupid wand. He bounds back to his work bench, grabbing his smallest chisel en route, and sets the lathe spinning a final time. The torture of knowing that Draco is behind him, waiting for him, ready to give him what he wants, what he needs—it’s exquisite. Harry’s cock is harder than he can ever remember it being, straining uncomfortably at his trousers. He unbuckles them without thinking, slides them down and kicks them away, then gives himself a quick press of his hand through his pants to relieve some of the pressure. It’s barely tolerable; he’d much rather be rutting against Draco.
“You’re good at thinking things through,” Harry said, refusing to back down. “I appreciate that about you. I’m much more likely to jump right into something if I don’t really understand it.”
“But it sounds like you did all the right things,” Draco says, and he’s unable to prevent a yawn as he does so. “Sorry. It sounds like you noticed a problem and made sure she was treated appropriately. Why aren’t we throwing a party?”
Harry wandered back to his seat and considered his wheel. The demonstration had seemed straightforward while Melanie was giving it, but his own wheel suddenly appeared rather daunting. Glancing around the room, he watched the other students placing their clay balls and beginning to turn them, and he decided to copy their movements. It wasn’t long before his wheel was turning his round block of clay happily.
“Getting me into the mood?” Harry asked, and Malfoy flushed but held his gaze. “Ok, fine. You seem decent. I see you helping the other students in the class, and they all look satisfied.” As Malfoy seemed about to puff up at the praise, Harry added: “This, what we’re doing right now, on the other hand, is pretty fucking weird. So it’s a bit of a wash so far.”
Harry arrived outside the studio fifteen minutes early, still unsure if he was actually going to take Malfoy up on his offer. It wasn’t that he thought Malfoy was going to try and take advantage of an empty studio to get revenge—well, he didn’t
you would find it easier in a different environment,” he finally continued as if Harry hadn’t said anything. “Maybe you might even start to enjoy yourself! I’d be willing to settle for something more achievable, though, like not constantly having a stick up your arse.”
Malfoy breaks eye contact, and the moment passes like a cloud across the sun. “Oh,” he says again. “Right.” He straightens his shirt unnecessarily, still looking at the wall next to Harry's head. “So, two days then?”
“Dunno.” Harry shrugged, bewildered. “Like… clay? I’m pressing my fingers into the clay. What else would it feel like?”
Draco tried to keep himself from smiling. He had encountered patient fantasies in his mind-magic work over the years; it was unavoidable, really. They were always far more embarrassed about it than he was. “What about them?” he asked, attempting to keep his tone neutral and non-judgemental.
“You're also really important to me,” Harry says, barrelling onwards. Draco suspects he was semi-rehearsing this conversation in the shower, and possibly catastrophizing about it in the process. “I feel like a fraud saying that, though. I can’t even be here for our anniversary! I can't promise that we can make plans together or that I’ll be around for them. I think… I think that it’s time to acknowledge that.” Harry turns his face back towards Draco, and in the moonlight he looks worried.
Malfoy just took another drag on his cigarette, and Harry unabashedly watched him do it. He blew out a cloud of smoke pensively as the silence continued to stretch, exposing the curve of his neck as he leaned his head backwards. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of it.
As if sensing his cue, Potter once again emerged from the back room, this time clad only in a towel, his hair dripping. “Malfoy,” he said, a smile appearing on his face. “I’m glad you could make it. Sorry about…” He made a half-hearted motion towards the broad expanse of warm brown skin that Draco was having a hard time ignoring. “It was the faculty Quidditch match, you see. It went longer than expected.”
Harry’s stomach did something funny. He remembered how it felt to discover Sirius’ connection to his family, and when Sirius had asked if Harry wanted to live with him… He wanted Draco to have the same opportunity that he had.“What do you want to do?” Harry asked gently. “I’m pretty sure she’ll give you a chance."
Once the priest had delivered what Harry’s program referred to as the benediction, the organist began to play again as the congregation filed out of the sanctuary. Harry realised that he needed to make a choice—he could try to get out of the church without Draco noticing and pretend he hadn’t stalked his private Christmas Eve plans, or he could prepare himself to confess when Draco eventually noticed him sitting right by the exit. Given the press of bodies making their way out of the doorway next to him, he briefly entertained the idea of crouching down and crawling under the pews instead, but at that moment Draco turned around in the midst of putting on his coat and made eye contact with Harry.
Several unproductive hours later, Harry and Draco sat slumped in their respective chairs, staring at the large pile of largely unreadable paperwork.
Malfoy cocked his head slightly. “And what of being an Auror? Do you see yourself doing that forever?”
that Draco threw at him; he had apparently decided to follow Harry’s example and win at any cost. He frantically stood to cast an
“What?” Harry asked, baffled. “But… what do I do?” He followed Malfoy, who seemed to show no inclination in providing any further guidance.
Malfoy frowns. “Do what?” he asks, but he looks closer at Harry and must notice the tension that he’s carrying. “Oh,” he says, meeting Harry’s gaze once more. “I… don’t really know what I’m doing.”
“There’s no need to take that tone with me, young man,” the woman said, returning to her crossword. “Somebody hasn’t found his holiday cheer yet.”
Sometimes, Harry’s therapy sessions felt like being on a stakeout. He would sit back, constantly watchful of his surroundings, waiting for Healer Tran to make the next move. Meanwhile, she would watch him right back, her fingers steepled in front of her chin.
at Draco, but Draco simply blocked it as he swept towards Harry in a vision of righteous wrath, following it up with his own
Malfoy chuckles. “What a… loose definition of ‘a couple’ you have,” he says, and when his eyes meet Harry’s again Harry feels himself swallow. It’s a look that promises many things. “Three days it is.” He strides to the doorway, pulls open the door, then stands on the threshold. Without looking back at Harry, and in what Harry is coming to think of as his normal voice, he says, “Thank you. For… you know.” He apparates away before Harry can think of a response.
They put up a token resistance, but Harry insisted and they didn’t press him. Ginny ruffled his hair and told him to get his beauty rest; Pansy did a little head jerk which was her way of saying goodbye to people she was friendly acquaintances with; and Blaise gave him a small, lazy wave with a smile.
“Happy Christmas, Molly,” Harry said fondly as he allowed himself to be squeezed tightly. “I brought Draco too. I hope that’s all right. We can’t stay too long, but I couldn’t let him keep working while I got to see all of you.”
be explained away as the product of a flighty dreamer, moving on to a new scenario when the previous one no longer held their attention, Draco wasn’t sure that explanation made sense. Not with the weight of Potter’s attention and convictions in their conversation so far.
Pushing open the door, Draco peeks inside. The bathroom light is on, and he can see Harry through the glass walls of the shower cubicle, standing with his head tilted back so the water from the showerhead hits his face before running down the rest of his body. He’s not moving at all, just… standing, and Draco feels the hairs on his neck rise on end. He moves closer, until he’s right outside the shower with Harry’s discarded healer robes pooled around his feet.
Draco smiled politely. “Oh, it’s no bother. Perhaps we can review my son’s work in your class while I’m here, though. You know his name, of course.” The trick with dreams, Draco had found, was never to get hung up on one single approach. You had to be on the lookout for any detail to latch onto that might be enough to get the dreamer to wake up in a panic if you just prodded roughly enough at it.
Potter threw his head back and gave a guttural moan as Draco kept jerking him, and Draco felt his lips part in preparation—
Draco shrugged. “Dreams aren’t known for being logical,” he said. “Unfortunately, we still need to find a way to wake you up once you regain all the missing memories. I probably just made it more difficult by revealing all of this, because now your brain will be primed to recognize surprises as part of the dream.”
What does he actually want? He remembers the feeling of attending the Quidditch World Cup when he was younger, and the effect that the Veelas on the field had on him. Draco isn’t a full Veela, so his influence over Harry should be lessened, but this afternoon has been exhausting. Harry had thought he had moved on from Draco after that night they spent together; he had believed he could do this work relatively dispassionately. Clearly he’s been wildly over-optimistic about the whole thing.
“Well,” Malfoy said briskly. “No need to read too much into this particular dream. Can you tell me where you work?”
“I appreciate what you’re doing for me, Harry,” Draco says. “I want you to know that.” He presses his face against the back of Harry’s head, and Harry leans into it, revelling in the closeness. “I know this is difficult for you.”
“Oh, Potter,” Draco said, sounding delighted. “That was… thoughtful of you. To bring my ‘special stick’ all this way.” He appeared to be on the verge of laughter, and Harry felt his face reddening.
“Yeah, I am,” he said. “What’s wrong with it? Have I made a mistake with tying it or something? The charm’s a bit of a faff, but I thought I had it after the third go…”
