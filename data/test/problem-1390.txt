Potter’s cheeks were flushed with red, and he was obviously gritting his teeth together while giving Draco an intense stare.
Their lecturer stood up and started to walk towards the back of the class. Brown and Parvati looked up in surprise, both becoming sombre.
It was a rare treat, to have the dormitory for themselves, as all four of their dormmates were in a Herbology class – something Draco had decided to skip this year, thinking he had all the necessary knowledge of plants, in order to boss one of their garden elves around – which meant there was still at least an hour and a half without interruption.
“Yeah. Just with her,” Potter continued after a short silence. “Before and after the war. It was –” he sighed and rubbed his face, “It didn’t work out. I wanted something else… I wanted…”
There was giggling in the back of the class. Draco glanced at the girls, as did their lecturer, before giving the girls – Brown and Patil, unpredictably, and a couple of others – a stern look.
“Very much so,” Potter breathed, swallowing hard as Draco’s fingers moved downwards, close to their hips.
Potter blinked at him and swallowed hard. “Um. You know. Blaise.”
In the beginning of September, the eight years – all thirty of them – had been divided into six dormitories. Three for girls and three for boys. Naturally, Draco was placed in the same room as ‘saint Potter’. However, Draco had been satisfied to see that both Theo and Blaise would be rooming with him, and Weasley would not. Draco, Blaise, Theo and Potter were put in the same room with Longbottom – harmless plonker, on Draco’s opinion – and Finch-Fletchley – who wasn’t that much different from Longbottom: the bloke could rarely tell which way was up.
He summoned lube from the drawer in his own nightstand and put the wand back on Potter’s nightstand. He gave a furtive glance at Potter who was still kneeling behind him and watching him expectantly, before squirting slick on his fingers and moving his hand close to his crease. Potter gasped quietly, as Draco started to circle his arsehole, arching his back slightly.
Granger looked pleased, while Potter’s neck seemed to get stiffer as their Wizarding Sex Ed Lecturer spoke. Draco wondered, if she knew her friend now had close acquaintance with the boy who had been bullying her for her first six years at Hogwarts. Naturally, Draco had apologised to Granger, but it was more a formality than anything else. He was quite certain Granger wouldn’t be forgetting all the shit Draco had put her through – and Potter too, even if the boy himself did – for a while.
Draco started to rock himself back against Potter’s fingers, fucking himself against them, while his breath caught in his throat, and his cock became stiffer and stiffer. “More,” he grunted, his voice breathy. “Another one.”
Draco gave him a sly grin. “And I want your dick in my arse.”
“This?” Draco asked pointedly.
“Uh, yeah,” Potter said and coughed slightly. “A couple of times.”
. Longbottom seemed to drink every single word that came out of the dull lecturer’s mouth. He was even taking notes, the pathetic oaf. Draco was certain that Longbottom hadn’t even seen a witch without their dressing gown – if his grandmother wasn’t included – even if he was supposedly matured and buffed up.
Draco moaned, trembling.
Draco was somewhat thrown off by Potter’s hesitant voice as well as his words. He licked his lips and thought for a moment of what to say – of where to start.
bloody hell!” He moaned, as Potter’s knuckles brushed against him, as his fingers moved quickly in and out, pushing inside hard and grazing his prostate.
After that, it had become a habit that hadn’t stopped. A secret habit, no one else knew about. Draco was more than fine with that: even though he reckoned many of his closest friends had been guessing his preferences already, he wasn’t ready to be outed to his parents nor being the topic of gossip in a school that desperately needed something to gossip over, now that having ferocious sex in the halls was prohibited and there was no dark wizard to dread. But what bothered Draco, was that their habit hadn’t really progressed anywhere from snogging, and after two months of most inappropriate daydreams and being continuously hard, Draco knew exactly how he wanted the thing between him and Potter to progress. He was rather certain Potter knew it as well. After all, he had caught the bespectacled boy staring at his backside with the most hungriest gazes for more than once.
Draco smirked at Potter and then moved slightly away on the narrow bed, to discard his pants. Potter lunged up and pressed himself on Draco’s back, kneeling behind him, his hands moving over Draco’s body, his lips sucking Draco’s neck. Potter’s hands brushed over Draco’s thighs, his groin, and feathered over his length, while he pressed his own cock against Draco’s backside, breathing hard when he circled Draco’s cock and gave it an experimental stroke.
Their lecturer hummed. “Well, yes, it is. Of course, there is no reason not to include queer and non-binary youth into this course.”
“Bloody hell,” Potter gasped, his other hand taking a firm hold on Draco’s hip. “…That looks amazing…”
–” Potter panted, “
“…You reckon he’ll leave eventually?” Potter asked, out of breath and somewhat doubtful.
Draco didn’t stop, but continued bobbing his head along Potter’s shaft, while frantically pushing a hand into his own pants, widening his legs and circling his own length. Draco moaned, a cock still deep in his mouth, as he felt Potter’s hand at the back of his head, stroking through his hair, holding his head in place as he sucked him.
!” Potter moaned, his stomach muscles twitching, his body tightening.
Draco had pulled slightly upwards, and held Potter’s hips down as he took the head of his cock between his lips. He sucked, hollowing his cheeks. Draco let his tongue lap at the tip of Potter’s cock, all the while stroking himself slowly, loosely, and still on the brink of an orgasm.
house – with values of respect, honesty, commitment and teamwork. Still, Draco and his friends liked to call their house ‘Merlin’s Wrinkled Ballsack’, just to piss off Granger.
” Draco started snarkily, but when Potter’s slick fingers started rubbing circles over Draco’s hole, the rest of his sentence died in his throat, and instead he was reduced into a shivering, gasping puddle, that was leaning against the headboard with one hand, while the other was still on the bed, desperately trying to hold him upwards.
“Well. Let’s start with the obvious one. Have you ever fucked anyone?” Draco asked plainly, slightly amused by the blush creeping into Potter’s cheeks.
Draco’s eyes flickered to the front frow, at the boy in question. Potter was sitting back on his chair, his arms crossed against his chest. His gaze kept moving lazily between their lecturer and the thin leaflet they had each been given. Draco wondered, not for the first time, if Potter had actually shagged anyone, or if he was a virgin. He wondered, if Potter had been shagged… Which made Draco’s spine tingle with warmness. He pressed his teeth together and looked away, his gaze stopping at Longbottom.
As expected, Potter looked back at them and scowled, evidently having heard something, or at the least, realised what Draco and Theo were up to. Draco smirked back, knowing just the thing that would make Potter explode. Well. He wished there could be other – more pleasurable – ways that would make the bespectacled saviour explode, but for now, Draco was reduced to make Potter explode in rage, and not, say, in bliss, like he wished.
“Dick?” Draco asked wryly.
He could feel exactly how hard Potter was, and was certain the rather impressive tent in his trousers wasn’t missed by the raven-haired wizard. There was a still moment, as they both stared at each other, and the next moment, Potter was pulling Draco flush against him, his hand firm on Draco’s neck. He felt a whoosh of magic around them.
Potter let out a shuddering breath and slid a hand inside Draco’s pants, finally touching his cock. “Oh, I plan to make you come…”
They were both panting heavily, and only then, did Draco realise that someone was banging at the door.
Draco nodded quickly, his body quivering. “Yeah – ‘m fine,” he mumbled. “Go on. Fuck me already!”
Draco groaned, hanging his head while his cock jerked at the thought that Potter wanted to watch him finger himself. He leaned down against one hand and spread his knees wide, displaying himself while pushing one finger into his tight hole.
“Yes?” The lecturer cleared his throat, “Miss… Granger, is it?”
what you’ve been hiding,” Draco murmured absently, his eyes glued at Potter’s thick and long cock that was on full display, pointing slightly upwards. He shivered, knowing he was going to ache the next day in the most pleasurable way. He glanced up and licked his lips. “Can I suck you?”
It was Weasley.
A new class wasn’t the only change there had been after the war. No, the previous seventh year students who had come back to finish their studies were now eight years, forming a temporary fifth house in the school. They were even given the option to choose the name of their unfortunate house. Naturally, the majority of the eight years were Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, and were not even amused by the name suggestion provided them by Draco, Blaise and Theo. They were the
Draco snorted against the pillow, feeling blissfully fucked, and only a little annoyed that Weasley had come to ruin everything with his presence. He pushed himself up a bit and grabbed Potter’s wand, before pointing it at the door.
“Oh, you like that, huh?” Potter asked with a ragged voice, evidently noticing how Draco was on the brink of an orgasm. “My fingers fucking you?”
Slick and wet sounds filled the room, joining loud puffs of breaths and the occasional moans. Potter kept working his cock in and out, picking up pace, and Draco was so full of Potter, so desperate to feel the hot pulsating pleasure and come over Potter’s jerking cock.
Potter whispered, his gaze zeroed on Draco’s backside. “Spread – um – spread your legs, Malfoy,” He said with a raspy voice.
They were in bed, and Draco had been grinding his achingly hard cock against Potter’s equally hard prick, and still, the saviour blushed when Draco asked if he had ever slept with a girl.
Draco smirked – as did many others – and turned to face the front of the class, meeting Potter’s eyes.
Granger shot her hand up.
“Nothing.” Draco shrugged languidly and leaned back on the pillow, mildly surprised that Weasley had actually taken the hint of a good ol’ necktie on the doorknob. He turned to smirk at Potter’s suspicious expression.
Potter grunted and then, his cock started to slide in and out, his hands holding Draco’s hips with a firm grip, and his gaze inevitably glued at Draco’s hole that was practically sucking Potter’s dick inside.
” Potter whispered dryly, before grabbing the lube from the side of the bed and slicking himself up.
He could feel Potter’s grin against his skin, and the bloody prat took his time, kissing his back before pulling away, rubbing his fingers twice inside Draco, before pulling them out.
is not someone you want to think of an example of what to expect from gay sex, Potter,” He said firmly, barely stifling a growl of frustration.
Everything had gone surprisingly well when the year had started – mainly because Draco, Blaise and Theo had both decided to stay at the school for the most of the summer after their Wizengamot trial and hearings, respectively, avoiding the press and rebuilding the school. Which thankfully managed to make Draco’s sodden Death Eater reputation a bit better. It had also helped that the war wasn’t a topic that was discussed openly in the common room area or in the halls, as they had mandatory group counselling for that.
… How – how can you take me…?” Potter asked, his voice curious, low and hoarse.
It was heaven, and Draco wasn’t sure how long he would last before he would burst. Every time his cock – which was still unfortunately as clothed as it had been thirty minutes ago – brushed against Potter’s hip, he thought he would explode in bliss and come in his trousers. Potter’s lips were soft and pliant, his fingers squeezing Draco’s shoulders with a grip that was just the right side of painful, and the soft gasps he let out, that grazed Draco’s lips, were making warm shivers flicker down his spine.
At first, Draco had avoided Potter’s – and everyone else’s – accusing gaze for all his might, until, two months prior, sometime before the Hufflepuff-sex scandal, he had confronted the speccy git and been somewhat impulsively ready to duel with the saviour of the wizarding world, with the boy who destroyed the darkest wizard that had existed. It hadn’t gone as Draco had anticipated, and instead, well… They had ended up snogging after Potter had wearily told him that he didn’t want to fight with Draco anymore, and hoped that they could start fresh and forget the past.
Potter moaned into Draco’s mouth as he started to rock his hips against Potter’s, seeking friction and feeling Potter’s cock hard and hungry against him. The next moment, Potter’s hands started to pull Draco’s shirt from his trousers, and sliding beneath his shirt, fingers spreading against Draco’s bare stomach.
Potter closed his eyes for a moment, seemingly embarrassed, before finally looking at Draco. “Yeah.” He said with a ragged voice.
Potter bucked again, moaning loudly, and Draco finally pulled away, admiring the view: at Potter’s flushed body, his tight balls and twitching prick, the way he panted, the way his moans and breathy puffs of air filled the room. Draco watched Potter’s face, intrigued by the bewildered and desperate expression on the saviour’s face.
Potter let out an amused sniff. Draco stiffened against him, not sure if he ought to have been hurt or angered by Potter’s reaction.
Draco stilled and then groaned, leaning his forehead against Potter’s shoulder. The bloody git had – what? – waited? He had… “Potter.” Draco gritted through his teeth, still not lifting his head to look at the other boy. “Were you… waiting for me to beg?”
Draco arched his back, feeling his skin flush and his cock leak at Potter’s words. Fuck, it was definitely something he was going to inspect later.
Potter sniggered, but then became solemn as he worked his finger inside. “It’s so…
Draco lifted a single eyebrow at the bespectacled boy and mouthed, ‘with you’, before looking away and barely covering an amused snort, as Potter nearly choked on his own saliva and started to cough loudly.
“Well then, I suppose you’ll excel in th –
“…Fuck,” Potter gasped between a wet kiss and another, as Draco grinded his hips against Potter’s, while holding him down on his bed. “…Ahh!”
They kissed some more, Harry kept stroking him slowly, and only when Draco felt that he was too close to coming, he pulled back to rip off his shirt and trousers.
Potter’s hand grasped Draco’s shoulder, while the other slid over him and took a hold of Draco’s cock, working it in quick moves, his hips working his cock inside Draco with the same rhythm.
“Okay. I promise.”
“I was wondering… do you think your parents would be okay with me going to visit Sirius tomorrow? Just for a few hours? I have to talk to him and Remus about some things. The whole dating-Draco-Malfoy thing being one of them,” Harry said.
. Ron nodded.
"Shut up, Potter," Draco mumbled, biting his lip in a clear attempt to hide a smile and failing. "I said no such thing, and you heard nothing to suggest otherwise." Harry grinned and shook his head, pulling Draco out of the empty room and continuing down the hall.
“GET OUT OF MY HEAD!” Harry yelled. Something else broke. The burning in his scar subsided and his mind went quiet. All that he could hear was panicked breathing and his own sobs.
“I love it, Harry,” Draco said, chastely kissing Harry's nose. He took the camera from the box and brought it up to his eye, pointing it at Harry. Harry blushed, covering his eyes with the sleeves of his—well, Draco's—sweatshirt. “Oh, come on, let me see your face.” Harry shook his head. “You give me an instant camera, and then are surprised when I want my first picture to be of my boyfriend?”
“Listening. Being there. I dunno, everything?” Draco smiled fondly at him. To Harry's surprise, he reached down and picked him up by the arse, Harry flailing for half a second before wrapping his legs around Draco's slim waist and latching his ankles together. Draco looked up at Harry and kissed a soft trail of tiny kisses from his jaw that led to Harry's shoulder. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and kissed his forehead. “They don't understand. They don't see you like this.”
“Shut up,” Draco replied without venom. Harry felt Draco’s fingernails drag up and down the small of his back. “I still don’t like you.”
He felt his abdomen tense and pressed his lips together in a thin line to prevent from making any more embarrassing noises. Harry’s toes curled and he clenched his jaw as he came down Draco’s throat. The blond milked every drop of come from Harry’s cock and then tucked him back into his trousers and zipped him back up again. Harry parted his lips and let out a small sigh, releasing his death grip on the bench. Draco nudged his legs to one side and Harry felt him crawling out under the bench. Harry froze. But Draco was invisible when he left and apparently took the opportunity to give Harry a kiss on the cheek before leaving. He was using Harry's bloody cloak.
“That's all right. It will all be okay soon.”
“And that’s why we’re going to be subtle, but not keep us a secret anymore,” Draco murmured. “Just… subtle, at first. To warm people up to the idea.” He kissed the tip of Harry’s nose. “Then we can have as much PDA as we want.” Harry laughed and shook his head. “What is it?”
“Mhm. I’d say around a month’s worth of it, or more if we want to be overly sentimental and look at all the paintings and explore the decor first.” Harry laughed and grabbed the sides of Draco’s face, kissing him firmly and briefly.
“Please what, Potter?” Harry shuddered. “Say it.”
“Malfoy. Truth or Dare,” Hannah Abbott said.
“Oh,” Draco whispered. “I still write to my aunt, even though she married a Muggle. My mother’s side of the family disowned her because she ‘brought shame’ to the Pureblood line of the Blacks. I’m not even supposed to know about her, but family has a way of getting brought up in conversation.”
“Yeah.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Geez, Malfoy, trying to kill me already?” he added sarcastically. Draco pulled back and grabbed the sides of Harry's face, looking into his eyes seriously.
Lunch passed normally enough, if just a bit more tense than usual, but Harry suspected that was mostly because the Weasleys didn't know what to talk to Draco about.
“You,” Harry hissed when he got back into the Slytherin common room. He stalked over to Draco, who was reading a book and leaning back on the arm of one of the sofas. “What the fuck were you thinking?!” he hissed. Draco looked up and smirked.
“Never, Scarhead.”
“Yes, of course. It's always great to stay at the Burrow with you all.” He paused and looked at her curiously. “Can I help you with cleaning up anything?”
Harry frowned and glanced at Draco. Draco shrugged next to him and kissed his temple lightly. Harry exhaled heavily when Draco's mouth reached his earlobe.
“Tu es trop fou pour moi,” Draco said in a joking tone. “You're too crazy for me.” Harry leaned back slightly and cuffed him on the shoulder playfully. They laughed. “Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Tu est parfait.”
“It sounds like you're already in love,” Ron said honestly, with a shake of his head. “I just wanted to know about him, not hear you gush. Bloody Hufflepuff.”
“Or…” Harry hummed, walking backwards towards his bed and pulling Draco with him, “you could get undressed.”
George and Fred both grinned and said, “sorry, mum,” in unison. Draco leaned into Harry's ear.
“Hey, what's wrong?” Draco called over the wind. He walked toward Harry and wiped Harry's cheeks with warm palms against a wind-frozen face. It was only then that Harry realized he had been crying. Harry fell onto Draco's chest and sniffled. “Harry, what's happened?”
Draco pointed across the room. “That one, over there. Personally, I don't think it looks anything like a dragon, but…” Harry followed his finger and saw a constellation that really just looked like a curved line to him.
Draco grabbed his waist and bit Harry's lower lip lightly. “Me too,” he murmured.
Harry sighed and frowned. “Fine. But you owe me when we get back after hols.” He stood on his tiptoes to kiss Draco slowly. “Thank you.” Draco rose an eyebrow.
“I do have one question, though,” Harry murmured. Draco hummed. “Why did you lie about who it was that you were talking to?” Draco sighed.
Harry slid off and fell ungraciously onto the bed beside Draco. “Fuck. That was…” He turned his head to look at the boy next to him, who was staring at him lazily.
“You think?” he hummed. Harry nodded. “Do you want to know what I think?”
It was slower; not chaste or rushed, just a soft kiss that had Harry feeling like he was floating.
“Because I like it, and you love me.” Draco rolled his eyes but grabbed the book and leaned into Harry’s arms anyway. “So… tell me about these Horcruxes.” Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco shifted in Harry’s arms and somehow managed to snuggle closer. Harry grinned. “I told you you’d like it.”
Hermione cleared her throat. “As much as you two are a very sweet couple—” she held up a hand when Draco opened his mouth to protest, “—this is, unfortunately, a quite significant issue. I think we should go straight to Dumbledore—” Draco scoffed. Hermione paused and raised an impatient eyebrow. Harry winced in sympathy for Draco. He was either about to get scolded or guilted. “Do you have an opinion on the matter?”
“Oh, just asking Ron about something. Why… is Malfoy with you?”
“You know… I think my mother knows,” Draco said softly, looking over at Harry. Harry frowned in confusion. “I think she always has. I've never shown interest in a girl. At parties, they would try to get close to me, flirt with me—I'm guessing that's what they were doing, though I'm not sure. A lot of girls just acted like they had something in their eye.” Harry laughed softly. “I never really responded. But… even when I was younger, and had no idea what sexuality was, I would have more animated discussions with boys. I'd sit or stand closer to them, smile more often, just small things. Be more engaged in conversation.” Draco sighed. “I think, even when I was trying to suppress it all, I knew how I felt. I always knew that she knew. Somehow.” Harry hummed.
He was promptly shoved against the wall again. “Unh—you could just tell me to follow you somewhere, I don’t like being shoved against walls.” Malfoy was instantly pulling his hood down and mouthing at his neck.
“My father… I was just told that—” He broke off with a shaky breath. “Fuck, I told myself I wouldn't cry.” Draco recomposed himself for a moment before continuing. “I've just been informed that I'm scheduled to—take the Mark this summer.”
“I told him not to let himself be coerced either way, but I don't know. I don't want him to be hurt, or worse.”
“Is that your way of saying you want me to sleep with you tonight?” Draco rose an eyebrow. Harry nodded awkwardly into his pillow. Draco walked around to the other side of Harry’s bed and climbed under the covers, his body like a furnace against Harry’s back. Draco threw an arm around Harry’s waist and pulled them impossibly close to each other. Harry could feel Draco’s breath ghost across his skin and could smell Draco’s vanilla conditioner as he drifted off to sleep.
“Hermione!” he cried. “Can't you trust me when I say he's not like that? He's a good person! You don't have to trust him, but trust me. I’d like you to at least give him a chance, before dismissing my judgment. And I'm not just saying bullshit, I know. I know because he just told me that he would fuck up anyone who tried to mess with me.” Hermione's eyes widened and she opened her mouth to reply, but Harry walked out of the compartment and to the open end of the train, sliding the door shut behind him. His eyes stung.
“Good. I’m really sorry, again, I didn’t even think about it, I just said it.” Mrs. Weasley rested a comforting hand on his arm.
"We'll do it somewhere private. Or sneak around the castle," Draco murmured. "How does that sound? Good?"
“That will never happen,” Draco whispered. “We’ll fix this. You’ll be just fine. I promise.”
“No,” Draco admitted. He sat further from Harry than he usually would. Harry started to panic. Was this it? Was this when Draco would tell him it was over?
“I don’t care, Draco,” Harry snapped. “Are you going to fuck me or am I going to have to find someone else who will?” Hurt flashed over Draco’s features for a split second before he recomposed himself. Harry felt a pang of guilt but was still focusing too hard on sex to register it fully. Draco stuck his hands down Harry’s pants and squeezed his bare arse. Harry moaned and bent forward to take Draco’s lips in an open-mouthed kiss. “Good choice.” He removed their shirts and rocked their hips together.
“Draco, where did you learn that spell?” Harry asked in wonder.
“Harry!” Ron jumped up from his seat. “Where did you go with the ferret?”
“I’m glad you’re so eager, Potter,” he hummed in response. “It’s called a secret.” Harry frowned slightly. “And we’re not doing anything, really.”
“You know,” Harry mumbled after they pulled away, noses still touching, “I think I might rather like you.” Draco grinned.
“Draco…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Severus is my godfather, Granger, watch your tone,” Draco replied in annoyance. Harry was grateful for the fingers that were still massaging his hair. “And yes, I think he would tell Harry exactly what’s going on because he doesn’t like him at all. Anyway, something wouldn’t be wrong with Harry. Just Voldemort. Why would he lie? Severus doesn’t sugar-coat anything for anyone. And he doesn’t lie, either. Despite what I’m sure is a Gryffindor House-wide assumption, he doesn’t work for You-Know-Who. I know this for a fact. He advised me against taking the Mark, and he was the first person I told when I decided not to. I trust him with my life.”
“You chose a cat over me,” Harry replied blandly. Draco placed the cat on the couch and kissed Harry on the lips firmly.
"Is she the new Professor?" Ron asked after swallowing a mouthful of chicken leg.
“Or your hair,” Harry offered with a dopey grin. Draco smiled softly and kissed him. “Where's your constellation? I know there's one called Draco.”
Harry's face heated immensely. He snuck a glance to Draco and he was red as well.
“Oh!” Harry said suddenly after they were all crammed in the Weasley's living room. He and Draco sat on the floor in front of the full sofa, Harry essentially in his lap. Harry stood up and dragged Draco with him towards the stairs, stopping in his tracks when he heard dog whistles and catcalls behind them. “Hey, it's not like that, I just want to give him the Christmas present I have for him.”
“Potter, go to bed,” Draco whispered in his ear. Harry groaned. “Come on.”
“Yes.” Draco scoffed.
“They really are like the same person,” he realized. Harry nodded.
“But that’s just quidditch,” Harry mumbled.
“I think you’re beautiful.” Harry smiled softly. Draco kissed up the side of his neck to his ear. “Are you still wearing the necklace?”
“Uhh—” Draco gripped tighter and pulled Harry harder against his groin. “Charms… Harry, we need to put up charms,” he groaned. Harry huffed and fumbled for his wand in the nightstand and cast silencing and locking charms. He shoved the piece of wood under the bed and returned to snogging Draco breathless. He moved down the blond’s body and pulled the silk black pyjama trousers off along with Draco’s pants. Harry wasted no time sucking Draco’s cock down as far as he could into his throat. Draco tangled his hand in Harry’s hair and arched into his mouth. “God, Harry.” Harry looked up and his partner was staring back at him with parted lips and hooded eyes that were blown in a very attractive manner. Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hair and pushed his hips up suggestively. Harry moaned around Draco, nodding. “Fuck.”
The whole exchange was over far too soon and Harry walked back to Hermione and Ron's compartment, rubbing his bracelet affectionately.
“Hi,” he said quietly, smiling when Draco kissed him. “Missed you.”
“We'll be there, Prongslet,” Sirius confirmed. Harry smiled at them before throwing the Floo powder down and calling out the name of the Burrow.
“Whatever this first date redo is, it better be amazing,” Harry warned. Draco scoffed.
“Hello, boys,” Sirius said, a hint of amusement in his voice. “I'm just going to take a wild guess and say you both are panicking right now because of what was just said?”
“Fuck,” Harry moaned quietly. Draco nodded in agreement, crooking his fingers again. Harry continued to massage the front of Draco's trousers, reveling in the muffled gasps he received in return.
“Cheers,” Harry hummed, “to the untainted flowers.” Draco laughed quietly at the reference and everyone else took another drink to his toast. “I’ve never had feelings for more than one person at a time.” Hermione drank and blushed. “‘Mione, who?”
Draco scoffed when Harry caught up to him. “Took you long enough.” Harry shook his head and grinned.
Harry pouted. “I will not tell, and yes, it was good. Can I continue eating my food now?”
“What do you want for your birthday?” Harry asked.
“I like him,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Thanks, Nott.” The boy held up a peace sign with his fingers and then went back to ignoring them. Draco threw a pillow at Harry. “Well, now we’re
“You’re bloody mad! What were you
“Harry, I’m sure he’s all right,” Hermione said apologetically. “Maybe he’s just not feeling well…”
“Draco.” Harry reached for one of Draco’s clenched fists and pried it open, entwining their fingers. Draco didn’t pull away but he also didn’t respond to the touch. “There’s seven billion people in the world. And I’m still here. What does that tell you?”
“Well, it looked like that snake in the dream I had last year,” Harry recalled, “the one that was by Voldemort. It ate an old man.” Draco pulled away and looked him in the eyes.
“No, I didn't. I called you perfect,” he replied, amused.
“It’s like a part of him transferred into Harry,” Ron chimed.
“Fine. Kiss the person that gave them to you. If they’re in the room.” Harry made a pained noise.
“I actually want to tell you a couple of things, if you have time.”
“Have you not slept tonight?”
It was not long after that Draco clutched Harry tighter and came hard, groaning.
“Actually, I should be going back home,” Draco said. “I’d love to stay, really, but I told my mum I was going on a walk, and I've been here a while.” Harry followed him to the door.
“I get it, Draco, I understand what you mean.”
“Is the word you're looking for, ‘hot,’ Ron?” Harry supplied.
“I was walking back to the dorm and that arse just grabbed my wrist and wouldn’t let go,” Harry grumbled, “started saying shit about me and how he could ‘take care of me’.” Harry scoffed and shook his head. “I’m not someone that just goes around letting anyone who wants to fuck me do it.” He dropped onto the ground in front of his trunk and opened it, rifling through it to find his robes.
Harry looked at the full bag slung over Draco's shoulder and the trunk at his feet. “You're leaving,” he realized. Draco ran a hand through his loose blond hair and nodded. “Are you going to stay at the Burrow for the rest of hols?”
“Love?” Harry offered. “My mother begged him to kill her instead. A mother’s love is what I was always told.” He paused. “Well, that’s what Remus and Sirius said, at least.”
“Found him,” he whispered hoarsely, through gritted teeth as he felt his jeans being unzipped.
He was cut off by Draco’s mouth covering his own. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and pulled him closer. “That was a nice surprise,” he laughed quietly. Draco kissed him again. Harry slipped a hand down and played with one of the buttons on Draco’s shirt. “Well. If we’re not going to be doing anything, I need to get dressed.” Draco rolled his eyes and kissed his forehead.
“Harry…”
Draco’s fingers found their way into Harry’s hair and Draco moaned quietly. Harry looked up at his face through his own eyelashes and saw Draco’s head leaned back, the front of his throat exposed and skin taught. Draco thrust harder, and Harry gagged slightly. He could feel a steady stream of drool dripping from his lower lip. He could also feel the beginnings of tears pricking at the sides of his eyes, but Draco felt so good in his mouth that Harry didn’t care.
“Um—the room was—it had shelves of crystal balls, I think. It was all black, all marble. Really shiny,” Harry recalled.
“You two didn't have to spend this much on us,” George said after hearing the news that the three hundred packaging materials would be delivered on the 27th to the place they had bought in Diagon Alley.
"We love you too, Harry."
“What did you leave for?” he asked. Draco didn’t look at him.
“I’m not a flower,” Harry replied indignantly. “I’m not fragile.”
have real friends and not just followers. Your turn.” Harry sighed.
“Je t'adore. Harry, what are you doing?”
“He’s a good person once you get to know him, I promise,” Harry assured. Neville gave him a skeptical look. “I swear it. On my life. He's a better person.”
“He’s… not wanting to talk to anyone right now,” Sirius answered cautiously. “Look, I don’t know what happened with him and Harry, but he’s torn up about it. He hasn’t come from his room, and the door’s locked.”
“Of course, dear, bottle to what?” Mrs. Weasley replied.
Molly stood up and clambered over dozens of children's feet to Harry and Draco. “I'm so sorry, dears,” she scoffed fondly, shaking her head, “they’re being so crude. Forgive the manners, you seem like a very polite young man.”
“Go home. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Draco grinned.
“Hm.”
“Thank you,” Harry murmured. Neville shook his head in exasperation and walked down a few compartments. Harry stepped in and sat next to Draco. He pulled Draco’s head into his lap and began running his fingers aimlessly through Draco’s soft hair.
“I like that idea,” he agreed. Draco got off his lap and Harry moved further up the bed, propping himself up against the bed frame and holding his arms out expectantly.
Draco cupped Harry’s cheeks and whimpered in the back of his throat that made Harry smile. “I really fucked things up,” Draco mumbled, “Weasley helped me realize it. Shockingly.” Harry chuckled.
Draco pulled out and thrust back in, slowly, shallowly. Harry heard himself making breathy gasps, and then Draco growled quietly. His hands were on Harry’s hips, holding him lightly. Harry’s arms gave out, and his head fell forward onto the pillow, his ragged breathing audible.
“You hug me all the time.”
“Who’s this, Sirius?” he asked curiously.
The tip of Draco's tongue traced along the vein in Harry's neck. He sucked lightly on Harry's pulse point. Harry bit his lip.
“Y—yeah, I’m going to go,” Harry murmured. “I’ll see you both soon.” He walked toward the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo powder. “The Weasleys are having a huge dinner on New Years’ Eve. You both should come. Remus, too,” he said before stepping into the fireplace.
“Bullshit.” Harry looked at Draco again. “You’re lying. What’s going on? Was it Abbott’s Dare? Or Marietta’s?” Harry didn’t answer. “You’re being difficult, Harry.” He looked up to Draco at the use of his first name. “Don’t read too far into it,” Draco warned. “Tell me what’s going on.”
“Ah—Malfoy, please—”
“Happy New Year's, you dork,” Draco murmured. “Love you. Now go to bed.” Harry hummed and returned his head to Draco's neck.
He awoke to someone shaking him. He turned around and saw Ron in his pyjamas shaking his shoulder. “What?”
“You're just saying that because you've got a boyfriend,” Ron scoffed.
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin with a hand and tilted it up towards his own face. He leaned down and planted a kiss to Harry’s lips.
“I couldn't give less of a damn about it, but Kreacher insists on keeping it clean and it was the closest sitting room to where we were. What do you have to say?”
“It will be,” he promised. “I’m a great planner.” Harry hummed his assent and shrugged.
After several moments of severely uncomfortable silence, Draco moved closer to Harry and pulled him into an embrace.
Handing back the letter, Hermione smiled. “We honestly did underestimate him, Harry. He really cares about you.” He nodded and neatly folded it back up, putting it in his pocket.
“What about the other way around, then? If he got under the table, on his knees, and got you off with his mouth, would you be mad?”
HI I'm sorry I always take soooo damn long to post again... life's crazyyyyy, y'all. Well, I hope you liked it!! Drop a comment/Kudos if you want, I always love reading and responding to comments :)
“Harry, my father’s not a bit mad,” he laughed softly, “he’s a complete lunatic.” Harry grinned, and Draco kissed him lightly. “You should get dressed.”
“And?”
“Actually, I talked to Draco the other day,” Sirius remembered. “Remus was out doing… something, I don't know, when suddenly my wards went off and a Malfoy was trying to get through. Thought it was Narcissa at first, honestly, before I saw who it was. Draco explained everything to me. Poor kid. Lucius is still mental.”
“It’s just lightning.” He grabbed Draco by the cheeks and pulled him down for a kiss. Draco rested his hands on Harry’s arse, squeezing lightly, and Harry sighed softly into his mouth. Draco started playfully biting Harry’s neck, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry rolled his head back to laugh and to give Draco more access. He momentarily opened his eyes and froze at the shocked faces of Draco’s parents staring at them from under the covered area of the courtyard. “Draco,” he said, eyes wide. Draco hummed and hugged him tighter. “Draco, your parents are here.”
“Err… yeah.”
“You don’t mind, do you?” George asked from Harry’s left. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Blimey, she'll be getting quite a lot of books for Christmas, then,” Ron said with a grin. “I'm pretty sure we all got her studying material and parchment and such. I got her a huge book that is filled with misspellings that I think she'll love. You're supposed to find them and correct them, and it's around four hundred pages long. And it was surprisingly cheap. I guess nobody wanted to take the time to go through and fix it, but Hermione loves books, correcting things, and schoolwork.”
“Who said they didn’t?” a voice asked from a couple feet away. Draco leaned his shoulder against the wall, wearing nothing but loose pyjama trousers. Harry again tried to tug his wrist out of the boy’s grip. “I’d let go of him, if I were you, Nichols. I’m sure no one is a fan of being called an immature little kid, and Potter evidently isn’t fond of you manhandling him as you are. I can't imagine the world of trouble you'd be in if you keep trying to take advantage of the Chosen One.”
Ron felt bad for Harry. He was his best mate. But, he also wanted to sleep. He couldn’t handle the hiccuping breaths any longer. Who knew people could cry in their sleep? Ron sighed and got out of bed, quietly stepping down the stairs. He made sure to skip the squeaky stair.
“Someone's here to see you, mate,” Fred urged. Harry frowned and walked down the staircase, hands stuffed in the pocket of the sweater Draco had given him.
“I mean...” Draco shrugged. “If I ever do get married, I would like it to be to you.” Harry tried to contain a grin and failed.
“It might be the one that I got from falling out of a tree when I was younger,” Draco hummed. “It was eleven years ago, I think.”
“I'm glad the two of them decided to move back into Grimmauld. Maybe they’ll fix it up a bit. Quite gloomy, that house,” Mr. Weasley mused with a little smile.
“I won't,” Draco replied quietly. “I love you.” He kissed Harry quickly and squeezed his hand before looking at Molly. “It was lovely getting to know you all, Mrs. Weasley. Harry really does have the best family he could.”
Harry's face flamed up. “I—I—well—to ourselves?” Fred nodded, smirk playing on his lips. “Then, I guess—I mean—umm…”
Draco placed a hand on the small of his back to support him silently. Harry leaned into the touch and sighed. “Thank you, Headmaster,” he mumbled. Dumbledore nodded solemnly and Harry and Draco took that as their queue to leave.
Draco started the water and helped Harry undress slowly as if he’d break. Sitting in a ball in the tub, Harry grabbed onto Draco and held him tight. Arms immediately wrapped around his waist and he buried his face into the familiarity of Draco’s warmth.
“It's hard to call them family because they treat me more like a rat that they can't get out of their house than their nephew. I get two-minute showers every other day. If I stay in longer they turn the water freezing cold until I got out. They won't let me eat with them; I always eat in my room. Sometimes I'm not able to eat at all. Not always because I'd been particularly bothersome that day, but because I existed.
“Yeah,” he mumbled against Draco’s lips. He felt Draco breathe out a sigh of relief.
“You mean like, coming out?”
“Hey, Harry. Sorry—I was just looking at the photo. I keep wondering if he had been better... if he knew more if he would have survived.”
What, they all knew. Nobody had to ask.
“It’s not that bad.” Harry protested but allowed Draco to fix it anyway.
“Hey, Neville… what were you doing in there?” Harry asked with a frown.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, what the bloody hell happened?” Ron asked warily. Harry glanced up at him and minutely shook his head. Hermione stepped cautiously forward.
“I love you,” he whispered. Draco returned the phrase in a haste mumble and slid Harry’s shirt off his shoulders, kissing down his chest needily. He dropped gracefully to his knees and bit at Harry’s stomach above the waistband of his trousers, leaving light pink marks behind and pressing his face into Harry’s hip with a soft groan. Harry felt a cleaning charm zip up his spine and he exhaled sharply when Draco pulled his trousers down and mouthed at the front of his pants.
“Well, you're very—”
“Thanks,” he said softly.
“A month is a… reasonable amount of time,” he conceded with a smile.
“Harry, we don't have time…”
“Well… this is just a guess, but… Mrs. Weasley has this very accurate ability to tell when one of us is lying before we even open our mouths. Maybe parents just know those kinds of things. I think Molly knew what I was going to say right when I asked her if I could speak to her,” he reasoned. “But… I only have one example to go off of, so it might just be a Molly Weasley thing.” He thought of the mirror of Erised and what he saw in it during Second Year. He really did have his mum's eyes.
“That comment didn’t go unnoticed, Harry,” Hermione said, “and actually, I think this could be a good way for the rest of us to get to know Malfoy a bit better.”
“Ooh, she’s loud.” Harry frowned up at Draco, who returned the expression with worry.
“I thought there’d be more feeling up,” Hannah said sadly. Harry gasped as Draco's hand immediately found its way to the front of his jeans and squeezed.
His normally natural-tanned skin on his throat was littered with purple, circular bruises that went all the way down to his chest. Harry’s face reddened. He regretted not bringing his wand. But then again, Harry didn’t know healing spells very well at all. Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing when he realized that it was greasy. He stripped his shirt and pants off and stepped into a shower stall, turning it on hot enough that steam filled the whole bathroom.
Dumbledore held up a hand to silence him. “Phineas, please wake professor McGonagall. She’ll want to hear about this. Have her inform the Weasley children.” A portrait to Dumbledore’s left nodded and disappeared from his frame. “I shall send Madam Pomfrey to the Ministry, and inform the Minister, St. Mungo’s, and the DMLE. I appreciate you telling me this, Harry, not to worry. Mr. Weasley will be taken care of. I’m going to need a description of your dream. Where were you? If you can pinpoint the exact place in the Ministry, it’d be most helpful. How did you witness the attack?”
“You've been having these dreams since last year?” he asked slowly.
“I really have to go back home,” he said regretfully. “I—” He broke off and shrugged helplessly.
“I can’t seem to remember either,” Harry agreed, grinning in satisfaction. Draco grabbed Harry’s free hand and kissed it lightly.
“Say something,” Draco pleaded after a moment. Harry swallowed.
"Why?" Ron asked her. "What does it mean?"
“Hey.” Draco grabbed his hand and squeezed it. “You’re not him.”
“Like this, love.” He started running his fingertips lightly against the front of Freddie’s neck, and the white fluffy cat started purring again and nuzzling against Draco’s hand. Harry rose an eyebrow.
“Hey, Cho.” Harry rested a comforting hand on her shoulder. She looked over and wiped the tears from her cheeks.
“Fred!” he yelled, chucking a pillow at the twin. Fred grinned when he caught it and threw it at Hermione. She spluttered and turned red, walking over and proceeding to smack Fred with the pillow repeatedly.
“Oh—love, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you,” he laughed, rubbing a warm hand up and down Harry's back. “Are you all right?”
“No!” She drew back in shock. Harry realized that the whole Gryffindor table was now looking at them in curiosity. Harry shrunk in his seat and used the drawstrings to close his hood more. His eyes met Malfoy’s again, who was laughing at his sudden outburst. Harry glared at him.
“Did you just ask me out on a date, Potter?” he asked. Harry blushed. That wasn’t what he meant… He opened his mouth to say as much but Draco beat him to it. “Because I can’t. I can’t be seen going out with someone. Especially a boy.
Draco sighed. “You're turning me into a Hufflepuff, Harry Potter.” Harry grinned and Draco whipped out the Polaroid to take another picture.
“Um—” Harry cleared his throat, “Draco Malfoy,” he repeated, louder. Sirius rose an eyebrow.
I'm so so so sorry about flaking on posting for a while. I've been having very bad anxiety and depressive episodes, and I had no motivation to post or write anything at all. I'm no longer going to be posting once a week as that is surprisingly very stressful on me, and it makes me even more anxious. I'll try to post at least once or twice a month, but I haven't given up on writing this. Again, I'm really sorry, but I hope you liked this chapter. It's a bit short, but it's all I can do for now.
“I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that,” he mumbled.
“Vernon likes throwing things. The first heavy thing he can get his hands on. I quickly learned to duck from flying objects. Dudley is big enough that he could easily sit on me until I pass out. He likes to rough me up, bruise me a bit. Sometimes break a few bones. Until I was eleven, until Hagrid knocked down the door and personally handed me my Hogwarts acceptance letter on my birthday, I had to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.”
,” they chorused.
“I'm sure they'd understand. I’m protecting their beloved golden boy, after all.” Draco's eyes held a sort of fiery determination that made Harry realize just how lucky he was to have such an amazing boyfriend. “Je t'adore,” Draco suddenly murmured the odd phrase again, pressing their foreheads together and looking Harry in the eyes, “it means I love you.”
Potter groaned, his forehead against Draco’s back as he kept wriggling his fingers. “Fuck – you’re killing me, Malfoy!”
Draco arched a brow at him. “Let me guess. She-Weasel?” He asked dryly.
“Impressive,” Draco whispered against his mouth. “What else have you been hiding, I wonder…” He murmured, between kisses.
dick?”
It all happened after three couples – Hufflepuffs, Draco was sure of it – had been caught sneaking around at night and carelessly having their end way in different parts of the castle. It hadn’t all gone along at the same night, but during the first two weeks in November. And when they came back from their holidays, the Headmistress had informed everyone during the start of term feast that there was a new mandatory class to be taken by everyone from fourth year up.
“Nothing, really,” said Potter. “It doesn’t matter.”
“What?”
"Why don't I have one of those," Harry asked, as Malfoy led the way down the street.
"Alright," she said. "It was nice meeting you, Harry."
“Congratulations,” he said.
Hermione had given each of them a copy of
"Sometimes," Harry said. "I go flying pretty often."
“What?”
"He was," Malfoy said.
He stood up. Potter reached for the door.
”Nice face, Potter,” Draco said.
“You think I’m lying?”
“So what do you plan to do instead?” asked Draco, pretending that Potter hadn’t just tried to derail their barely functioning conversation with his unwelcome sincerity.
Draco glanced into the the dark opening. He couldn’t see far down it anymore, but when it had been illuminated by Harry’s patronus, it had looked like it stretched far longer than it ought to, far beyond the extent of the outer walls of Azkaban.
“Get your story straight, Parkinson. Maybe you could ask Malfoy to help you with the consistency, I’ve heard his story is very neat, good enough to keep him out of Azkaban, even with that pretty tattoo on his arm.”
"And if it's like… something personal or something, you don't have to tell me, but I'm going to die if I don't ask, alright?"
“Be careful, then,” he says instead. “Please don’t die.”
Draco spent the rest of the lesson focusing on his spellwork and he was picking it up quickly. He had hoped McGonagall would notice and possibly change her mind about the detention, but of course she didn’t.
“Right,” said Potter. “Well, I saw you and I realized I hadn’t actually talked to you for a whole year or something. Not that we’ve ever actually talked, but I had the thought that… you know, lots of things have changed, so…”
“I don’t care.”
“I missed you too.”
Ron scoffed.
Harry groaned.
“That you’re going to visit your father?”
to. You could borrow money from me or from Greg or-“
, and Draco had no idea how to handle that if he couldn't run his mouth on autopilot. And around Potter, that apparently still meant spewing out insults at every turn. There wasn't any snarky comeback from Potter, though, and when Draco glanced over at him, he had his eyes fixed straight ahead and an oddly serious expression on his face.
"I need to call someone," he said.
“It’s Dumbledore’s orders,” says Mr Weasley quietly.
“No, not at all. I just need some air. I already finished the paper for Muggle Studies anyway,” he said, indicating Hermione’s roll of parchment.
“Harry, you can’t trust him, even if he suddenly seems like a nice guy-“
His tone suggested he was making a joke, but he didn't look like he found it funny.
“Bathroom.”
“Yeah, Ron and Hermione helped. I don’t know about Seamus and Dean… they might have figured it out. They haven’t asked.”
"Alright," Malfoy said.
“I’m going after her,” she said.
“An old Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom down here. I found it a few days ago, I thought we could use it.”
“I want to sleep forever,” said Ginny.
The voice of the Dark Lord was a gentle whisper of recognition. His face had twisted into a smile, and Draco knew that this could not be real, that it wasn’t real, but his thoughts were jammed, he couldn’t
“She’s not exactly friendly,” said Malfoy, taking it back when Harry handed it to him.
And then in the chaos, he began to see the pattern, a story that was dark and terrible enough that through it all he wondered why he had not heard of this, how much time had had to pass for something like this to be forgotten?
"Good ones too."
!” called some witty bastard, misquoting the painful headline from the
Draco could feel his heart like a heavy fist knocking against his ribs, his stomach a tightly wound knot.
“We were kids!” he yelled.
They all nodded.
A week after Potter’s visit, Draco was meeting Irie and a couple of the others for their usual routine of beer and small talk that would turn to gossip that would turn to lewd jokes that inevitably led to all of them staggering home when they were too plastered to be coherent. He was on his way out when the phone rang. For a fleeting second he had the ridiculous thought that it might be Potter. It wasn't.
Draco nodded. She sounded like a Gryffindor. He shouldn’t have been surprised.
“Right,” she said, looking down at her notes. “So now that that’s settled, there is quite a lot that we don’t know yet and a lot of questions we need to answer before we’ll know what the best approach to the situation is.”
"Do you know what he is?" the girl yelled at Irie. "He's a fucking Death Eater! He's a murderer!"
He reached up a hand and carefully touched his neck, and Potter looked confused, but he didn’t pull away. He didn’t let go. Draco’s fingers rested lightly against his skin. Maybe he had flinched just a little at the touch, but it might just have been because Draco’s fingers were cold and Potter’s skin felt burning hot beneath them.
"He's hungover," Malfoy added helpfully.
Another summer passes. Harry, Ron and Hermione follow Draco to Borgin and Burke's. Once again Harry is trying to point out the obvious to people who won't listen. It's really entirely rational of him when he sneaks off to the Slytherin's compartment on the train.
“No, people who have been confunded have a hard time keeping track of time and will often have difficulties with complex conversations,” said Hermione, reflexively quoting one of their charms books.
He had been mentioning Draco often enough in his letters to the Weasleys, and he was sure Ron must have too ever since Draco had started spending time with them, but in truth it had taken him quite some time to work up the courage to tell them they were more than just friends. It had been agony waiting for a reply to that letter. Mrs Weasley had been very supportive, but Harry was still pretty nervous about introducing Draco to them, though he wasn’t about to let Draco know that.
It felt strange saying it out loud. Malfoy's expression didn't change.
“Just leave it.”
He mumbled an incantation, pointing the wand into the air above them. The rain was getting heavier around them, the path already turning muddy, but Harry no longer felt the cold drops on his face.
“Fine."
His voice doesn’t sound like his own, it’s loud and shrill and terrified. And then Moaning Myrtle lets out a deafening scream:
“I know.”
She looked at him as if she couldn’t care less about it.
“Draco-“ Harry begins, but Draco shakes his head vigorously and takes a step back.
“What?” he asked.
Malfoy glared at him.
“Nothing,” he said quickly. “That’s what the message said, didn’t it? That it wasn’t anything important, it was just… it’s not like I had something I needed to tell you.”
“What happened?” asked Luna.
Harry reached out and touched Draco’s hand where it was clutching his left arm. The imagined itch of the dark mark on his skin was unbearable. Harry gently loosened his fingers.
“Is there anything else on this floor?”
“Yeah.”
“Apparently not. We’ll just have to hurry as much as we can and hope that’s enough…”
“I don’t like it when we keep secrets from each other.”
It took a while before they were all in bed and quiet and the lights could be turned off. Harry could hear the others settling in. It had gotten late, but he wasn’t tired at all. He lay awake in his bed with eyes open in the darkness, thoughts grinding relentlessly around in his head.
“Okay, Hermione,” he repeated. “I just didn’t know.”
"Probably. I think George might come by too, I know he really wants to see Gin before she leaves for the aurors. I mean, he has the whole summer to see her, but he'll probably get Lee to look after the shop if he can. Percy's probably not gonna take time off work, but I'm pretty sure Bill and Fleur will be there."
“They put them in the fabric when you buy proper clothes.”
“Sounds nice,” he said.
He looked up again and raised an eyebrow at her.
“Really?”
Harry rolled his eyes.
And he can’t tell them anything.
“No, professor.”
“No!” Draco interrupts and there’s a petulant, childish ring to his voice. “No, you didn’t. No one was there until Snape showed up!”
Draco looked up. Across from him, a Weasley took the seat next to Pansy. Freckles and bright, red hair. Red and gold trimmed robes. It took him a moment to realize that Granger was there too.
He leaned back on the sofa. Malfoy was staring out the window again, expression blank.
“The Hog’s Head on Saturday at 3, then?”
“He didn’t say.”
“I was distracted.”
“It’s a habit.”
“There has to be other pubs in Hogsmeade than this and The Three Broomsticks.”
“But I don’t think we can achieve that by ignoring each other.”
Hermione nodded.
He had kissed a bloke. That was one thing. And he wanted to kiss him again, which was another. He wondered vaguely if this meant that he was queer, but he would rather not think about that. He didn’t have to decide about it now; it didn’t matter anyway, as long as no one knew.
change, that in seven generations, being a Malfoy will still mean exactly the same thing. So I suppose… Sorry, I don’t know what I’m trying to say. Just that maybe that’s another reason for going to Azkaban. I just want to make sure something changes.”
“I’ll meet you down by the quidditch pitch when the feast begins,” said Draco, pushing open the doors to the Great Hall.
He smirked.
“Do you know what this is about, mate?” asked Weasley.
Mark didn't work at Starbucks. He was one of Maya and Irie's friends, but apparently didn't need to be introduced to anyone but Draco. Irie asked maybe-Josh to move over, but he said he needed to be getting home anyway, so Mark took over his chair instead. He barely had time to sit down before Irie sent him and Draco to get more beer.
Draco huffed.
He never wants to talk about it again.
“How do you know?”
“Granger?” he said.
Ginny and Ron landed a moment later and dismounted their brooms.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
And maybe Mr Weasley would look up to see what was going on and he would start – stand up, hesitate for a moment, and then he would stalk out of the room, unable to even look in their direction a second time.
“We used to come here last year when we needed to get away from snitches, and the barkeep gave us this table – and don’t look so surprised, Potter. Slytherins had things to hide from the Carrows too.”
Potter laughed and Draco could feel every muscle involved in it, how his chest convulsed and his arm tightened around him and the blow of warm air that moved his hair.
Harry nodded. He pushed back his chair and squeezed his way out, opting for jostling the stranger next to him rather than squashing himself against Malfoy.
“Yes,” said Draco’s mother.
He threw his transfiguration into his bag and they headed down the stairs and towards the Great Hall for breakfast.
“We should split up,” said Granger.
Harry kissed him again and Draco slid his fingers into his hair, clenching his fist in it and kissed him back. Harry pushed himself closer, and then Draco felt his hand on his thigh and everything he knew he had to say was pushed from his mind, because this was new, and he hadn’t admitted to himself exactly how much he wanted it or that it had any part in what he had meant when he told Harry he had missed him, but it did. He pressed himself against him and felt the hand move to his stomach, following its dip at Draco’s sharp intake of breath. He pulled back to catch his breath. Harry pushed his fingers between Draco’s shirt buttons and Draco had just leaned in for another kiss when someone cleared her throat.
“No of course not. I mean, in families like mine, the heir is expected to marry so that he or she can carry on the legacy, but otherwise people couldn’t care less.”
like this. We find something that’s impossible to do, and then we find out we have to do it, and then we try to plan or prepare and then we go there and find out we missed something important and then all of our plans fall apart and someone looses a limb or gets caught or dies. And I just thought it would be nice if, just for once, we had actually prepared enough.”
"I’m glad they got you out,” Potter says finally. “I’m not- It’s not easy that you’re here, but… I don’t want you to think that I would rather you were still with Voldemort. You did the right thing, you know.”
He took a sip of his coffee. It was only lukewarm but at least it wasn't as bitter as when Hermione made it.
Harry felt a rush of relief. Changing the subject was Ron’s way of being conciliatory.
“Well, it’s a surprise to see you here.”
"That map. With the apparation points."
They did group-work for the rest of the lesson and when class was dismissed, Nott wanted them to finish up the last question and Potter was out the door within seconds, just like the rest of the Gryffindors.
“Okay?” she said, in a tone of voice that suggested, that she didn’t consider that a very good reason for them to speak to each other.
“Molly and Arthur are very nice. I’m sure you’ll be fine.”
“That’s not what I’m doing,” Potter snarled.
This was different from the careful kiss Draco had brushed over his lips the day before. Potter was kissing him, and his breath was fire in Draco’s mouth, his lips nipped at Draco’s, there was the foreign push of his tongue, and Draco kissed him back. Their fingers were still oddly intertwined and every nerve in Draco’s body hummed.
"Maybe," he said.
“Better than thestrals, I suppose.”
“It’s just nice to know that you do have friends. Honestly, I’ve been thinking about what you said about allies in Slytherin. It’s been bothering me. I wouldn’t know what to do with someone who doesn’t have any real friends. I’d probably have to believe everything Hermione says about you, so it’s nice when you act like a person.”
“You know how.”
Harry winced.
She pushed the door open and they filed out into the corridor.
“You ready?”
And the Weasley family would all be there, of course. Mrs Weasley would stand up to greet Harry and then stop in her tracks when she caught sight of Draco, who wouldn’t know what to say. Harry had seen Mrs Weasley angry plenty of times, but that was mostly directed towards her children or husband, and the anger towards a Malfoy in her home would surely be much colder.
Harry hadn't known what to expect but he had shown up for this determined to be civil, to at least give Malfoy a chance to say whatever it was he wanted to say. He had no idea what had happened in the last year, and anyway it had been a long time since he had actively resented Malfoy, but if he was going to be a dick, no amount of free beer would keep Harry from walking out of there.
“Are you stalking me?” he asked.
“Yes. And you know, I hadn’t expected you of all people to be so shocked about it.”
“It was all over the papers a while ago. Her family didn’t get her registered, thought it was a better idea to just lock her up in the basement during the full moon. Then one night she got out, killed her mother and brother and a couple of muggles. Her father survived, but I think he got a sentence too, for trying to keep her condition secret. Why? You know her?”
“What? Don’t look at me like I don’t understand things when I am the only person here who’s being sensible!”
Ron set the eggs on the table and pulled out a chair across from Harry.
"When did you say you were meeting them?"
Potter looked at him then, and Draco took that as his cue.
“Potter,” she said finally. “Really?”
“I’m not behind on anything, I’m just prioritizing.”
“Okay,” he said. “Powerful memories. Fine.”
"About what?" said Malfoy, face turned towards the window.
” he cried loudly, clearly, as if he wasn’t afraid at all.
“Good luck finding a place to plug it in.”
As he climbed the stairs to his dormitory, the thought struck him that perhaps the sense of urgency that he remembered feeling had had more to do with Potter and less to do with the prison itself – that perhaps this had mostly been about getting close to him, and he just hadn’t been able to admit that to himself. It did make sense when he thought about it like that – the more certain he had felt about Potter not abandoning him, the less urgent Azkaban had become. They were putting themselves in danger by rushing it. They had time, didn’t they? Perhaps they should even reconsider the possibility of a political solution.
Harry glared at him. There was still a thin smile ghosting his lips and Harry had no idea what the hell that expression was supposed to mean.
“It shouldn’t exist,” he said. “Something like that… it’s not supposed to exist.”
"I meant do you have any plans?"
“I know, it was a rhetorical question,” said Ron. “Though Harry does seem to have a hard time keeping track of some very simple aspects of this conversation.”
"I'm not gay," Harry said quickly, quietly.
“You can’t even imagine what it’s like,” he continued. “The prisoners, they’re… It’s so wrong. They’re not even people anymore. I couldn’t tell which ones were dead and which ones were still alive; there was nothing in their eyes. My father was just… I don’t think he recognized us. He was half dead.”
“But the patronus already does that and the dementors don’t die-“
“I don’t see why not.”
"I don't."
"He's friends with you," Harry said. "You all seem normal enough."
"I'm serious."
Potter nodded.
Potter muttered something, and this time Draco thought it might have contained words.
“No,” she said. “You’re not. Your father was a wonderful man, and I promise you, some day you will be able to remember that about him. And in some ways you are very much like him, but he was a very flawed person, and this war destroyed him. It did not destroy you. You will get through all this awfulness and you are going to be a braver and kinder and better person than he was, and all the terrible things that have happened to us are going to make you stronger.”
Draco replaced his flower with another, less crumpled one.
“I don’t want to be policing who you spend your time with,” she continued. “I just want you to know that your actions have consequences.”
He figured that as soon as he got used to it, he would be happy to be back. He liked sharing a dorm with Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean again. It was almost like before the war, except they had all very quickly gotten into the habit of casting silencing charms on their beds at night, so they didn’t wake each other up when they had nightmares.
“I suppose that’s reasonable enough,” he said.
“At least we got to say goodbye,” his mother said, breaking the long silence.
"Alright. I really need to sleep now. Goodnight, Pansy."
“No. Do you mind if I clean up my station while we talk?”
“Pansy? May I come in?”
She put down her fork.
“Will you just be moping around in Gryffindor tower all evening?”
“I didn’t come here to hear you make excuses for yourself,” he said.
For a second, he had thought - he didn't know what he had expected. Not that Potter would be
“If it bothers you that he talks to me then tell
And they can’t stay there forever, so eventually Draco takes another step back, and Harry takes a deep breath and heads for the door.
“I’m not going to force you to help.”
The photos ignited another wave of public outrage and the Ministry began the process of moving the prisoners to another “more humane” but “still secure” location almost immediately.
!” said a loud, clear voice to his right.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked.
It was the fourth time they discussed this. They had taken turns suggesting and rejecting the idea.
“How was practice?”
Hermione looked like she wanted to kick him.
Harry slides his hand down Draco’s arm and takes a hold of his wrist. And then on an impulse, he lets his fingers migrate under Draco’s shirt cuff. His fingertips brush over uneven skin, raised scar tissue, and Harry’s stomach drops. He tightens his grip involuntarily, fingers digging into the mark on Malfoy’s arm.
The threat came almost casually, but Draco was oddly certain that he wasn’t bluffing. Saint Potter was actually considering poisoning him to get him to – do what, exactly? Spill his evil plans of taking over the world and become the next Dark Lord?
“Mum, please-“ he began, but she kept talking:
“You definitely would,” he said, mirroring her polite tone. “But I don’t think it would help in this case.”
“Yeah, your sincerity was really shining through,” he said. “Is this what you’re like when you try to be friendly?”
He headed for the stairs.
"I'm sorry, what?"
“It seems we got side-tracked,” he said stiffly. “I believe that I must have answered your initial question by now. To summarize: I am not up to anything. The things that go on in Slytherin are nothing but what has always been going on in Slytherin. I would appreciate it if you’d stop stalking me and do something more productive with your time so that I can at least confine the time I am forced to spend with you to the classrooms. Goodnight.”
Heating beans in a tent hadn't felt much like cooking, and that was what they had mostly resorted to when they were searching for horcruxes, which was the last time he had cooked anything.
“Right, leave it to Lovegood to use something harmless and obscure in a duel.”
“That’s what I expected,” he said, but he still looked disappointed.
"She's working late."
“Granger,” he interrupted her. “Look, I’m- I’m very sorry for the way I’ve treated you over the years.”
She ran a hand over her face. He watched her draw in a deep, shaky breath. Then she straightened up and looked up, a wry smile curling her lip.
“Not funny,” he said.
"I don't know," said Potter. "I have no idea, actually. I know you’re an arrogant prat and you think being pureblood makes you better than other people, but it’s still quite a jump from being a spoiled brat and an arse at school to taking the Dark Mark. I actually can't imagine why anyone would want to be a Death Eater in the first place unless they were mad.”
“If the first thing you did wasn’t insulting Ron. What if it had been you who helped me find the platform instead of the Weasleys? Do you think that would have changed things?”
“Okay. Good.”
“You actually got him to meet with you? How?”
"You can hang your coat by the door."
“But I’ve never
“Maybe-“ Harry began, but she cut him off again:
“They’ve been quoting them in Slytherin too.”
“I must be going mad,” he muttered.
“Yes you were,” said Harry putting down the knife.
He looked at her. She wasn’t smiling. It didn’t seem very probable that she would be joking but –
“I don’t think you’re mad,” she said. “I’m just wondering why, if it really is that terrible – that prison has existed for hundreds of years. We have been using it to hold prisoners for so long, so why hasn’t anyone else destroyed it?”
Maya raised her eyebrows.
“Hm,” said Lovegood. “That’s good.”
“I fell asleep in transfiguration once,” he said. “Very scary thing waking up to McGonagall standing over you with that look in her eyes. Can’t recommend it.”
“Draco-“ Harry began.
“Shut up,” said Potter.
He stopped.
“I can’t believe you’re actually friends with
“So are you excited about the feast tomorrow?”
“Hey!” she called and they stopped, turning to look at her. “Harry, how do you feel about doing a couple of group duels?”
Ron looked alarmed.
Malfoy’s hand is curled tight in Harry’s sweater; he stays leaning against him as he catches his breath. One of Harry’s hands is sticky and hangs limply at his side. He has the other one resting on Malfoy’s back, steadying him. He moves his thumb in small, soothing circles. They never did this either. There was never anything soft about the thing they had, and Harry feels his chest tightening, because it’s over now and he should feel the regret and awfulness creeping in, but it’s nice to have someone holding him and to hold on to them, it’s really nice, even if it’s Malfoy. He knows any second now, Malfoy will push him away and leave so he tries to take as much of it in as he can; the feel of Draco’s robes under his fingers, the flowery scent of Draco’s shampoo, and his own smell underneath that, the heated brush of his exhalations on Harry’s skin.
"Him and Mark just stepped out for a smoke." She frowned at him. "You alright?"
"Or a coke, if you don't drink," Maya added.
It felt weird saying that now. It had always been unspoken between them, maybe because they knew how thin it would sound when it was said out loud. It felt weird saying it to Potter. Draco shrugged.
Malfoy disappeared through the door and Harry was left there staring at it and feeling like an idiot. His head was a roaring chaos. His thoughts had derailed somewhere about halfway through whatever had just happened.
“I thought she was going to die. I thought we’d killed her.”
Draco had only managed to walk about five metres down the hall after he had split up with Potter, before he had to stop and steady himself. He slumped back against the wall and closed his eyes for a moment. Somehow he felt worse than he had after their fight. At least that incident had felt like something he had controlled.
He pushed his glasses up and pinched the bridge of his nose.
She sighed.
“I don’t know, actually. I never asked her.”
He sat up and Neville got out of his way. Harry’s body ached in protest of his sleep being interrupted. He slipped out of bed and got dressed as fast as he could manage with his groggy mind. Neville already looked ready to go and waited silently by Harry’s bed while he got ready.
“Yes,” he said. “I’ve left you all alone this year, haven’t I?”
"I don't want to pry,” he said primly.
“Expecto patronum,” said a voice behind him, forceful but not loud, and he turned to see a hare patronus erupt from Lovegood’s wand.
"Half an hour, I think."
. Harry wondered why no one had bothered to send him that last one, or at least told him that there were laws about where in London it was okay to apparate. He flipped to the final leaflet and scoffed involuntarily.
“I shouldn’t have taken you with me,” she said.
“We won’t make it. It’s been two hours already since we left the castle. We have to be back in three. This is taking us too long.”
"Gryffindor and Slytherin."
More silence. He couldn't make out what Ron and Hermione were saying. His stomach was inventing entirely new knots to tie itself into. His heart was beating very fast.
“I actually have a theory that you being an only child played a big part in turning you into such a prat,” he said.
"I miss you too."
“You don’t mind that I know.”
"What's an auror?"
Next to him, Malfoy snorted.
"I can get them myself," Mark said, already standing up.
He turned his broom around, trailing behind Malfoy in a lazy curve. They made their way to the village in silence with Malfoy leading the way.
“Oh, come on, Harry-“
“I don’t see what there is to discuss. You swear that you aren’t plotting anything that’ll hurt me or my friends or Hogwarts or anyone else, and I’ll stop trying to figure out if you are. You stop antagonizing my friends and we don’t have to fight every time we see each other and we can stop hating each other for no reason and just pretend the other person doesn’t exist.”
“But Ginny is right that we shouldn’t trust them, especially her. She tried to make us hand Harry over to Voldemort!”
The skeletal man didn’t move. His chest rose and fell and Draco was uncomfortably aware that his own breathing had synchronized with that slow rhythm.
Lightning crashed again, and Draco looked at the sky with a flinch. “No, but that might.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“It's—it's nothing, Harry, I need to see Sirius,” Draco answered. “Sirius?”
“I was thinking... that we hadn’t seen each other all day and I wanted to make sure you knew that I haven’t forgotten about you quite yet.” He grinned and leaned up to kiss Harry. Harry frowned. “You look good when you’re mad.”
“Wait—” Harry sighed. “We need to talk,” he finished in a whisper, talking to the empty space in front of him. He picked up his bag that had fallen onto the ground and walked towards the Great Hall for supper, still uncomfortably hard.
“Of course I’d be bloody mad,” Harry replied, “he's already done that, and I
“Her arm!” he cried. Draco didn’t look at him still, and it clicked in Harry’s brain. “Draco… are you jealous?” No answer. “Are you nervous?” No answer again. “Are you—”
Harry mulled over her evidence and nodded in defeat. “Maybe he didn't hate me,” he conceded. He looked over at Ron and felt his throat get scratchy. “He's refusing to take it.”
“I don't know… I don't want to be a bother and I was thinking that I should find somewhere more permanent because I won't be going back to the Manor at all,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I do like the Weasleys, but I was a bit overwhelmed yesterday. It's a lot to take in and adjust to.”
“What do you mean?”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “What?”
“Draco?” Harry breathed.
He was suddenly very awake when he saw who was sitting on the couch with a cup of tea in his hand, talking to Arthur solemnly.
“Wow, how many times are you two willing to do this?” a girl asked elatedly. “This is bloody hot.”
“Shut up. I have a habit of demanding things and I’m… trying to break it,” he grumbled. Harry brought his hand up to Draco’s chest and his fingers started dancing over the flawless pale skin lightly.
,” Harry argued, stabbing his steamed carrot to punctuate his sentence. “He just makes me happy. Can't I be in a good relationship?”
“Oh. Winky. Is this my tea?” Harry asked quietly, relieved. Winky bowed and set it on the nightstand.
“I don’t like giving up on things,” Harry said, “and you’re going to have to deal with that for quite a while.” He paused. "Did you say you want me?" He saw Draco blush for the first time today, and he silently cheered at his accomplishment.
“Well for one, you’re a world record idiot,” Draco teased. Harry scoffed. He knew it was true, but he'd never admit it. “Oh, stop scowling. Second, you’re the only person I've ever…” He trailed off and blushed, looking away. “That I've ever actually cared about. Third, you're mine, and there is certainly only one person that I decide I want at once. And you have honestly the best arse I've ever seen.” Harry offered him a shy smile. Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed Harry's cheeks and pulled him in for a quick kiss before leaning back. “I should get back, I have to do my Prefect duties.”
“Baby, wake up.”
“I didn't make you choose, did I?” Harry asked quietly. “I didn't—you're not making this choice because of me, are you?” He took a step backward. “Did you—”
“That's true.” Harry sighed when he tucked himself back into Draco's embrace. “How do you think I'd look with longer hair?” Draco looked down at him thoughtfully.
Harry hummed and kissed Draco again softly. “I would say that you are currently in a rough spot with your family and that it's risky to take a chance like that, and I don't want you to get hurt. But also that it's a very nice gesture, and I've never been outside of England besides Hogwarts, and you’re very thoughtful for inviting me to Amsterdam.” Draco grabbed his hands and intertwined their fingers.
“I—I think I’m going to take a bath,” Harry replied.
“A lot of strings,” he amended. “Don't be mad?” he asked hopefully, taking Harry's hands in his own. Harry shook his head.
“Well, Slytherins are known to be ambitious,” he said pointedly as he tied the makeshift necklace around Harry's neck.
“Very.”
“I do not squeak,” he said indignantly. Ron shrugged and dragged him out of bed and downstairs where the whole Weasley family was waiting in front of the Christmas tree. Harry yawned again and rubbed the sleep from his eyes with the heels of his palms.
The room was filled with various cheers and hollers, and Harry saw Ginny come to sit next to him on the sofa.
"I'm not sure, Harry, I'm truly sorry," Mr. Weasley replied apologetically. "I cannot go in there. I'm not allowed. Will you be all right in there on your own?" Harry shrugged.
“Nothing. Who was on the Floo?” Harry asked.
“I’m not just going to watch you be stressed out and confused and do nothing,” Draco replied. “I can’t fix everything for you, but I want to help.” He laughed quietly. “Even if it’s just soapy massages in the bath.” Harry smiled softly.
Draco lifted a shoulder in an elegant shrug before dropping it again. “Maybe. It's just difficult. I've grown up with all of these traditions, and beliefs. To realize that they're wrong, that my whole upbringing has been… medieval, and that what mum and dad said really means nothing, that those laws and beliefs don't apply to the modern world. It's a lot to take in. It's a lot to unlearn everything. And then to relearn it all in another light…”
“I have another question,” he said suddenly. “Have you… did you happen to tell your parents about us?” He bit his lip after seeing Draco’s expression. “I’m sorry. I just thought that… maybe you’d said we at least got to know each other… Nevermind. I’m being ridiculous.” Draco grabbed his cheeks.
Harry turned around to where he saw Ron sitting with his mum on the couch. "Thank you," he whispered. Harry walked to Ron and wrapped his arms around the boy’s lanky shoulders tightly. “Thank you,” he said again. Ron returned the hug.
“It's Italy! Of course, I'd go!” he sputtered. “Do you know how amazing that would be?”
Harry rolled his eyes and sat up with a yawn.
“Potter. Truth or Dare,” he mumbled darkly, buttoning all but his top two buttons of his shirt.
A soft voice and something warm behind his ear caused Harry to stir from sleep. The warmth moved to his jaw.
Harry nodded. “Yeah.” Draco kissed his forehead.
Draco sighed. “It's terribly uncouth to do something like that when Harry’s family is in the house.” He wove his hand dramatically. “Another time, another place.” He pulled Harry up the stairs and let him lead the way.
“One,” Draco said. Harry cocked his head. “One date. And I get to pick where.”
Harry groaned softly in frustration and Draco kissed his head. “Yes, Weasley, he did, and if he were sober we would have done it on your desk just to spite you.” Harry snorted quietly.
“This is hurting my back,” Draco countered. Harry sighed.
“One more thing. What's the thing you always say? The word that I can't understand, and you told me what it meant yesterday?”
“I’ve got it,” Hermione said. “Just don’t let him do anything stupid.” Draco nodded and Harry frowned at the exchange. The frown disappeared when Draco picked him up and carried him bridal-style into Ron’s room.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve always had this weird… feeling, just a little question of whether I made the right choice in being a prick to him in first year. I know he treats us like shit, but I’ve seen how much he cares about his friends. And he’s not… unattractive.” He’s really fucking hot, in other words.
“Draco, please—please, I need—” Before Harry could finish his sentence, Draco flipped him over and removed his fingers. Harry’s hips were lifted into the air and he scrambled to support himself on his forearms.
“But the palace has no wards… my parents wouldn’t know. Since it’s mostly Muggle and a tourist attraction, there’s no point because they’d be going off constantly,” Draco said reasonably.
Harry shrugged. “I didn't mean to. I was going to wait for you at the bottom of the stairs. I wasn't trying to listen.” He paused. “What's overwhelming? Why do you want to go back home? Why were you talking about Voldemort having your room? Am I stressful to you? What will be over soon?”
Harry rolled his eyes again. He looked up from the parchment at Malfoy, who was staring at him with glazed over eyes.
Ron seemed taken off guard by the question but after a moment, he said, "of course. What do you mean, 'do I want a hug.'" He scoffed. "I always want a hug." He walked up and wrapped his arms around Harry and Hermione's back and rested his head on her shoulder, sandwiching her between him and Harry.
“I promise, in no way am I upset or distressed because of you inviting them.”
“No!” Harry cut him off, attempting to reassure him. All he really did was make Draco jump. “No it's fine, I understand what you mean, I didn't mean to make you feel obligated to stay. It was just an option, I'm sorry if I made it seem like something else.”
“Well…” Harry shifted on his feet and avoided eye contact. “When I was over at Grimmauld Place yesterday, I might have invited Sirius, Remus, and Draco to the New Years’ Eve thing… and they might have agreed to come.” Mrs. Weasley sat in a dining chair and beckoned Harry to sit beside her. He did. “I’m sorry, it was last minute, but I never see Remus or Sirius anymore, and Draco was there, and I—”
Harry was fucked. Absolutely and utterly fucked. He still had no idea what he and Draco were doing since it wasn’t dating and they weren’t fucking, but he’d seen a softer side to the Ice Prince. Like for instance, Draco wouldn’t go any further than blowjobs as much as he obviously wanted to. So he did have standards. And Harry was starting to really like him.
"I love you, too." Draco tossed down the powder, said his destination, and was suddenly gone.
“When I was young, and I couldn't sleep, my mother would always come in and cast it,” Draco murmured. “She'd sit on my bed and point every single star and constellation out until I fell asleep.” He pointed to the star right above them. “That's the North Star. The spell causes it to be drawn to the brightest thing in the room. It's over here because of your eyes.”
“I d—” Draco squeezed again and Harry whimpered. “I don’t know.”
“Are you all right? Wait, what is—” She went to pull his hood down and he jerked in surprise.
“I don’t know why you bother having Potter do that, Hannah, Draco’s obviously a top,” Zabini chimed in. “He’s the one that would be feeling Potter up.” Harry chose not to mention the hand that was currently in his lap and rubbing him through his denim.
“I'm coming, little cousin!” Sirius called. He walked down the stairs and set a hand on Draco's shoulder. “How's it at home? Is anyone giving you a hard time?”
Love you guys <3
“Draco—”
“Quite possibly,” Harry laughed softly. “That’s not what I meant, though.” Draco looked over at him. Harry smiled tentatively, the expression widening when Draco squeezed his hand.
“It’s Zabini,” he whispered.
“Of course. Hey, Remus! Harry's here!” Sirius called behind himself. Remus emerged from a room a few doors down the hall with a yawn. He looked up and grinned when he saw Harry, increasing his walking speed to hug him tightly.
“I think that You-Know-Who is a manipulative bastard and that if Malfoy doesn't willingly take the Dark Mark, he'll find a way to threaten him into taking it. Malfoy isn't a Gryffindor, Harry, and if he gets scared enough he'll probably do something to save himself.” Harry sighed heavily.
"Seems like it," Harry whispered back.
“I suppose you’re right,” Harry conceded. “What do you want to know?” Draco shrugged.
“Yeah. Ron and Hermione?”
“That you were one of a kind, but not because you survived the Killing Curse, because you're an idiot, and the only person I've ever really cared about,” Draco replied in confusion. “What is this about?”
“He's not always like this, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry assured her. “Just around new people, apparently.” Molly chuckled and Draco elbowed him lightly in the ribs.
“Absolutely not!” Hermione cried. “Malfoy, if you think Snape won’t lie to Harry or just run along and tell You-Know-Who that something’s wrong with Harry, you’ve lost your mind!”
“Yeah. I’ll give you a bit.” Ron sat on the sofa as Malfoy walked up the stairs. “I hope I didn’t just make it any worse,” he sighed.
“He said you were dry heaving in your sleep and had been crying all night,” Draco said. “That you felt terrible.” Harry hugged him and buried his face in Draco’s neck.
“Harry! Malfoy!” Ron's voice called up the stairs.
“Wait—I didn't mean it like that,” Harry rushed, sitting upright and leaning over Draco. “It was more than ideal. You're quite talented at fucking me into the mattress until I scream. And I'd like you to do it again soon.” A slow smirk formed on Draco's lips.
“All right. Well, good night, everyone,” Hermione said quietly. Harry heard the door click shut and he easily started falling back asleep before hearing Ron's voice from above him.
“I’m comfortable, though,” Harry complained.
“Oh no, did you have train sex?” Ron wailed. Harry sat down beside him.
“I think it's a bit big,” he said sheepishly.
“Harry,” Draco sighed in exasperation. “I could never be on that side knowing that I’d have to hurt you someday. No matter what kind of shit we go through, I'm fucking here for you. It's done. I've made my choice. And I'll never regret it.” He rolled his eyes. “You've turned me into a Hufflepuff.”
“Well, we tried,” the twins said in unison. The chatter that had paused now resumed around the table and Draco leaned to Harry's ear.
“What? No,” Harry said. He tried to take a step but fell against Draco’s chest. “Um. Maybe a little?” he amended. Draco sighed. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know how strong it was. Please don’t be mad.”
“Hey, what happened? What’s wrong?” he asked. Harry shook his head and got out of bed, rushing out of the dorm and through the common room. Draco was beside him a second later with a sweatshirt on. “Are you all right?” the blond asked. Harry shook his head again and paused at the Griffin statue that led to Dumbledore’s office.
Draco added another finger and it went easily enough. The lube definitely helped. They were continuously brushing Harry's knot of nerves and he could feel himself tensing as he got closer to coming. Draco pulled off his cock with a pop and Harry whined, which turned into a moan when he felt the jolt of pleasure again. Draco moved up to kiss him. It was light, soft and almost reassuring. The discomfort Harry had initially felt was gone, entirely replaced by pleasure. He was gasping and arching his back with every stroke. “Mo—Draco, more,” he said shakily.
“Fine.”
“My friends hate you,” Harry replied. “They don't trust you, they don't know you. They won't even give you a chance.”
“I write to her, too,” he said. “I’ve never met Andromeda or Tonks in person, but I’d like to.”
“Oi, Harry!” Ron hissed from Harry's other side. “Stop eye-shagging each other, we can all see it.” Harry nearly choked on his chicken.
“I mean… if I wanted to try it with a bloke, y—yeah, I guess,” Ron stammered. Harry rose an eyebrow.
I never know how to summarize correctly. very hot I guess, I'm mostly insulting harry's abilities to handle his nightmares
Draco heaved in air and bit Harry’s earlobe. “Gods, you’re so tight, Harry. Do you like this? Do you like feeling me fuck you?” Harry nodded minutely.
“They're not in the relationship, though,” Draco said. “I don't care what they think of me.”
“Since I’m reluctantly forfeiting my Dare to you and changing it to tell me what’s going on.”
“What's it say?” Ron asked. Harry handed it to him, knowing that it was really nothing terrible. Ron read through it and gave it to Hermione.
“If you’re sure…” Neville replied uneasily. “I won’t say anything.”
“Care about me and want what's best for me?” Harry finished for her. She nodded eagerly. “I know. I'm sorry I got upset.” He held out his arms in invitation and she ran into him, bushy hair tickling Harry's neck. Harry grinned at Ron, who was raising an eyebrow. "Are you wanting a hug, too, Ron?" he teased.
“Second year,” Harry said, “I’m not the heir to Slytherin, I was told that. But I tamed the Basilisk, I talked to it, I understood it, I figured out how to get into the Chamber. I met Voldemort's soul from before he was Voldemort. If I’m not the heir to Slytherin, then how did I do that?”
“Were you watching the attack or committing it?” Dumbledore asked calmly.
“Hey, Harry,” she said softly. “Malfoy said he thinks these odd dreams are connected?”
“Don’t call it that. And wouldn’t you like to know?” Harry shot back with a grin.
“Not necessarily. And not like that. Some other way.”
“Language, Harry,” Remus scoffed fondly, shaking his head. “Good Lord, who taught you to swear like that?”
Malfoy's hand moved from Harry's chest to his hip and gripped his side tightly. His slim fingers poked just barely under Harry's jeans and dug into the skin right above his arse.
Interesting.
not having sex tonight.”
He started to feel slightly uncomfortable when Draco trailed kisses down his mouth and jaw, landing on his pulse point and began sucking avidly and determinedly to leave a giant bruise on Harry’s neck. It was only uncomfortable because now he felt people staring at his face, instead of something else on him. He bit down hard on his lip to stop from making any noise.
“I think your mother has a bit of a crush,” he whispered. Ron snorted. “Is Harry upstairs?”
A few minutes later, Draco shoved Harry into the wall of an empty train compartment by the hips and started carelessly pulling off their clothes.
?” Harry gritted out. Draco chuckled lowly.
“Hmm… yes,” Harry admitted. “I don’t want you getting in trouble or hurt or dragged back to live with that psychopath against your will.”
“I promised you—”
“He's not like how you think he is. He's not like how he was. He's nice. He cares, a lot. He's funny, and comforting, smart, and witty. His smile, Ron. And his eyes. Just—everything. Did you know he has dimples? His hair is so soft, and sometimes he hums quietly when he's doing homework.”
” Draco, the everlasting angel, did as Harry asked and moved faster, fucking him into the mattress with fast, smooth movements. Harry continuously moaned into the bed as Draco battered his prostate, groaning obscenities directed at Harry. He pulled Harry up straight and wrapped one hand around his throat, the other around Harry’s cock and started stroking while he kissed and nipped at the skin on Harry’s neck and shoulder. Harry tilted his head to give Draco better access.
“No! Ron, a bracelet!” Harry spluttered.
“Draco, I swear to god,” Harry grumbled. “Let me sleep.”
“I think that would look amazing on you,” Draco murmured, stroking Harry's hair softly. “I'm sorry I snapped at you when I told you what was happening with the Mark. I was scared, and I didn't know what reaction you would have.”
“I know the feeling,” he said. Draco pulled him closer.
“Harry… how would you feel about maybe not hiding and sneaking around anymore?” he asked quietly. Harry looked up at him.
Harry grabbed Draco's upper arms tightly. “Draco!" He took a deep breath. “You're spiraling. Calm down.” Draco exhaled sharply and nodded.
“He's trying to be better,” Harry replied softly. “The reason he was here today was that he's just been told that Lucius wants him to take the Dark Mark.”
“I dunno, Malfoy, I just might,” he replied. “I mean… have you seen Charlie Weasley?” Draco growled in the back of his throat and brought Harry's body flush against his own by the hips.
“Yours,” Draco replied.
“I think you'd look great with long hair,” he replied after a moment. “How long?”
“I want to show you something,” he said. “Have you seen the DA?”
Harry frowned and shoved his glasses on. He threw one of his oversized shirts on that fell off his shoulder and went down to his thighs, and padded into the bathroom. He received smirks from some Slytherins and odd looks from other Houses in the common room on his way there. Upon glancing at himself in the mirror, Harry’s jaw nearly dropped.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Mhm. Okay, Draco.”
“Mnh—” Draco slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt and grabbed his hips. “Again with the low hanging trousers,” he mumbled.
Draco looked up and blinked rapidly. “Harry? What are you—where's Sirius?”
“Fuck you,” Draco growled. “Fuck you for taunting me with your hip bones and your arse and your throat.”
“Yeah. I know what you mean.”
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco heaved, “you’ll make me come so fucking fast if you keep doing this.” Harry would have smiled, but he couldn’t with his mouth full. He instead tightened his throat and momentarily choked before relaxing again. He bobbed his head in sync with Draco’s rough thrusts.
Harry towel-dried his hair and wrapped the towel around his waist, bending down to retrieve his discarded pyjamas from the bathroom floor. Draco took them out of his hands and they walked to Ron's room.
“Wow. All right. Um, I…” She sighed again. “I wasn’t expecting that. I don’t want to be that friend that controls your life, but please hear what I’m saying.” Harry nodded. “Whatever you do, be one hundred percent sure that you’re going to be safe. And that if he wants you to do something you’re not comfortable with, leave. Get out of there as fast as you can.”
Hermione rested a hand on his shoulder. “We can skip the feast, I’ll search the books with you.”
you. My father would kill you and probably lock me up in my bedroom until he could marry me off. To a witch. With pure blood and money.”
“Everyone needs to be cuddled,” Harry answered simply. “C’mere.” Draco had a cute look of conflict etched across his features. “You want to,” Harry hummed. “I see you trying to decide.” Draco narrowed his eyes. “Come on, you’ll like it.”
“Excuse me, I need Harry's help with something for a moment,” Draco said after a few minutes. He set his tea down and stood, pulling Harry gently along with him outside.
“Hey, Ginny,” he said, gratefully accepting the cup of hot cocoa that Mrs. Weasley offered. “How've you been?”
“Wow, Harry,” George commented through a mouthful of potatoes, “Malfoy’s seriously got you wrapped around his finger.”
Harry sagged in relief. “Really?”
“Since the start of term.”
“Umm…” Harry stopped doing it. “I think I did it wrong.” Draco sighed from beside him and moved Harry’s hand gently out of the way.
“Baby, you'll be all right. It's all going to be fine, yeah? I don't need their approval to have feelings for you. And I don't need their approval to act on those feelings.” Draco planted a kiss on Harry's head. Harry moved his face and his nose brushed Draco's neck. Draco shivered and his breathing halted.
“Two?” Ron asked, “what do you mean?”
“Mm, well, it seems the twins like you enough,” Harry commented.
Draco pulled back to stare at Harry, his eyebrows furrowed. “Are you sure?” Harry nodded. Draco’s grey eyes were blown with lust, and Harry thought his probably were as well. Draco stuck three fingers past Harry’s lips and stroked the sensitive top of his mouth until Harry began sucking on the fingers obediently.
“He told you what happened?” he asked. Ron nodded as he sat down on the couch. “Um… the reason I lied about who I was talking to on the Floo was that I had told Harry that I wasn’t in contact with my mother.”
“You wish.” He started to unbutton his shirt but was stopped.
“Just Sirius,” Draco lied. Harry gave a sad smile. Right. Sirius.
“I mean, you got good genes, too,” Draco said thoughtfully. “Your arse is damn near perfect.”
“What?”
“‘Course not.” He looked back at the camera and shrieked in surprise when he felt a tongue on each of his cheeks, not even noticing Mrs. Weasley take another photo. His arms dropped from around his friends and he ran over to Molly, scrubbing his sleeves over his cheeks. “You guys are terrible!” he cried. The twins laughed and Fred ran towards him. Harry darted away, and he nearly made it through the kitchen before Fred picked him up by the torso and carried him over his shoulder back to the living room.
"Shut up, Harry." Ron shoved his shoulder and stuck his tongue out at Harry. Harry grinned and rested his head atop Hermione's.
“My birthday is July 31st. I don’t really have a favorite color, but I guess I’ve always liked blue. My favorite food is anything raspberry, and my favorite dessert is treacle tarts.”
“My turn,” George said loudly. “I’ve never had a crush on a Slytherin.” Harry, Hermione and Ron drank. “Oh? Ronniekins, who’s the lover?” Ron reddened.
“I don’t want to be dropped, actually,” Harry grumbled, cursing Fred silently. He thought he saw Hermione blushing out of the corner of his eye. Fred carried him over back to the group of Weasleys and stood beside George, refusing to put Harry back down. At least he was facing the camera and his arse wouldn't be on display for years to come.
“Murder.”
“What did you mean then?”
“He touched you,” Draco replied calmly. “He hurt you. And nobody touches you. Not like that. Not unless they want to end up without limbs. And I'm not going to hesitate with girls, either. I don't care what they identify as. If they touch you in a way that I don't like, or they try to hurt you they’ll be missing the rest of the school year.”
“Yeah. He does,” he agreed. Harry yawned. “I think I’m going to go to bed, I’m really tired.” He stood up and stretched his arms above his head. “Goodnight, you two.” He clapped a hand on Ron’s shoulder and leaned down to hug Hermione before walking up the staircase and falling onto the bed. Casting a quick Tempus, Harry saw that it was ten-thirty. He placed Draco’s letter on the side table with his wand, rolled over, and fell asleep.
“I've been walking around with a hickey on my neck?” he hissed. Harry grinned and kissed him.
“I just don’t know what he’s wanting to do, he’s been so quiet about it.”
“If you insist,” he murmured. He let Harry unhook his leg from his hip and then let go of Harry’s arse. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and spun him around so that Harry was facing the tree, arms wrapped low around his waist and mouthing at Harry’s neck.
“Be quick,” he sighed. “His room is the first door on the left.” Ron walked up the stairs and tried to push open Malfoy’s door. It was locked.
“Je t'adore, Harry Potter,” Draco whispered.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re a shit liar,” he declared, drawing his wand. He walked over and grabbed Harry’s wrist, pointing the tip of his wand at the raw skin and murmuring a healing charm. The pain went away and Harry gave a tiny smile as thanks before going back through his trunk to look for his tie.
“For?”
“So are you.”  Draco paused. “How about we just lie here tonight?” he asked. “I’ll fuck you senseless tomorrow, but I just want to lie down with you right now.” Harry smiled.
Draco's blush deepened. “It's the day we started dating,” he admitted sheepishly, “I thought you might like it.” He shrugged. Harry grinned and charmed it onto his wrist, afterward launching himself around Draco and burying his face into the apple-scented skin of Draco's neck.
“I'm gonna give you two a minute.” Sirius patted Draco's shoulder and walked down the hall to the kitchen.
“I'm serious,” Draco said, “you could pull it off very well.” He leaned forward, lips barely brushing Harry's. “I love you.”
“Harry!” Mrs. Weasley sighed in what sounded like relief. “How was your visit?”
“I'm not mad. I think… your dad loves you, but he's a bit crazy,” he said. Draco pulled him closer, biting his lip.
“Of course, you can't. Don't go mad on me, Potter,” he joked. He pulled Harry closer to him by the legs. Harry laughed, cupping Draco's cheeks with his gloved hands when Draco bent over to kiss him. “I love you.”
“No, Harry!” Draco cut him off. He grabbed Harry's arms lightly and looked him in the eye. “Well, yes, but—”
“D'you have a sitting room we could go into? ” Harry asked.
“Why?”
“You’ve been talking about it nonstop for three days,” Ron said. Harry bit his cheek.
“How do you know?”
“Tell me something about yourself that I don’t know,” Draco probed. Harry ran a lip through his teeth.
“That’s about to change, Golden Boy.” Draco took a step towards Harry.
“Harry—”
“Draco's perfect,” Harry sniffled.
“Shit, I need to see him,” he breathed. “Is he awake?”
"No, no, this is bad," Hermione said worriedly.
“So I want to… ask you if you want to… go out. On a date. With me.” Draco’s cheeks were bright pink now, and Harry grinned. He moved up to kiss him again.
“This is genius,” Hermione breathed. “You think that they’re—”
“Well, to each their own, Harry,” Hermione replied, shaking her head. “Just be careful. Especially with him.”
“Saviour.”
“I love you, too,” he whispered. Harry laughed against Draco’s lips.
you, not because of you.”
underneath the word Parseltongue. “Umm… anything else?” He gasped after a moment. “Mind! You saw Mr. Weasley get attacked! You said Nagini was there.”
“How I stand two of you, I have no idea,” he chuckled. “I’m kidding, I love you both.”
. “Hi, Ginny.”
“Draco Malfoy, did you just propose?” Harry teased.
Draco licked at Harry’s rim and Harry tensed his shoulders. “Draco—” Harry gasped.
“You’ll never be free of me,” Voldemort’s voice echoed in Harry’s mind. His grip grew tighter on his hair, and tears spilled over onto his cheeks as he let out a loud, choked sob. His scar burned like a bitch.
The front door squeaked open, and Harry looked over Draco's shoulder to see Sirius in the doorway. Draco turned as well and undid the silencing charm.
Harry sighed, reassured, and nodded.
“Harry, do come over and stand next to Ron and Hermione,” Molly said encouragingly, camera in hand. Harry did as requested and Ron placed him right between him and Hermione, wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulders casually. Harry wrapped both his arms around his friends’ necks.
“Tu es beau, mon amour,” Draco replied. “You don't need to know what it means. Not yet.” Harry frowned, puzzled, but nodded. “Now, I really need to get to Prefect duties.” Harry sighed and nodded, standing up from where he had somehow ended up straddling Draco's thighs. Draco stood up as well and pulled Harry into one last strong kiss before kissing his cheek and hugging him, leaving afterward.
Draco nodded to him, a smile playing at his lips. “Thank you.”
“Don't you forget about me, Potter,” Draco hummed, releasing his arms from under Harry's arse and letting Harry's legs drop to the ground. Harry grinned.
, they read in elegant, slightly slanted, swoopy handwriting. They disappeared when Harry finished reading them.
“He’d want you to,” Ron pressed. Malfoy nodded and stood as well, following him down the stairs.
“Your friend just—bit me and it bloody well—hurt, Nott, don’t ask if I’m enjoying myself!” Harry snapped, breathing heavily. Draco laved over the bite as if apologetically and Harry squeezed Draco’s waist for a moment in acknowledgment.
“Mate, what's that around your neck?” Ron asked curiously. He walked toward Harry and looked closer at it. “A promise ring?” Harry blushed. “Well, shit. When did this happen?”
“Sorry.” Harry shrugged and kissed him again. “You know, I think I rather like saying ‘I love you.’” Draco grinned and bit Harry’s lip, tugging on it lightly.
Stepping through the Floo, Ron was pinned with a cold stare from his mum on the couch. “What? I’m home fifteen minutes early,” he muttered.
"Harry," George asked suddenly, thus ending the game, "I have a question." Harry hummed. "Would you ever let Malfoy grab your arse in public?"
“Aren’t you a Third Year, Greengrass?” Draco murmured into Harry’s skin. She shrugged.
“Well, hello,” he cooed. He picked Freddie up from Harry’s lap and stood up, cradling it in his arms like one would with a baby. “You’re so cute, yes you are, aren’t you, Freddie?”
“Honestly. That's the worst kind of taking advantage of the underage wizard laws.” Percy scolded. And for once, Harry had to agree with him.
Hermione looked over from where she and Ron were talking at the windowsill and smiled, beckoning Harry over to sit with them. “How was Grimmauld Place?” she asked.
He stepped back. “Wait!” he cried. She leaned back in surprise. “I'm seeing someone! I—Idon'twanttokissyou,” Harry rushed out. Cho turned red.
Draco traced the side of Harry's face with the light pads of his fingertips. Harry closed his eyes and leaned into the comforting touch. “Harry,” Draco whispered. He made an odd, choked humming noise in the back of his throat. “Where do they live?” Harry's eyes flew open.
“Harry… what—” Draco tried to say, but Harry cut him off by kissing him. Draco gave in for a moment before pushing Harry back slightly. “Harry, tell me what’s going on.”
Harry dropped his hands into his crossed lap. He looked up at Draco, blushing furiously. He smiled when Draco kissed his forehead. A clicking noise went off and Harry turned his face, covering his laugh with his sleeved palm. “You're an arse,” he murmured into his hand.
“Please, just… prove me wrong. Prove to me that the worst case scenario that is running through my head right now is not what's going on,” Harry pleaded. “Because what I heard makes it sound like you're using me to play some sort of angle. Am I overwhelming to you? Do I… do I stress you out? Did you lie to me when you said you wouldn’t be taking the Dark Mark?”
“I missed you, too,” Draco replied. “Have you been sleeping all day?”
He was crying when Ron walked into the room. “You didn't come downstairs when Malfoy was leaving, I just wanted to—Harry? What's wrong, mate?” Ron came to sit next to him, enveloping him in a much needed hug.
“I love you,” Draco repeated. Harry nodded quickly and smiled before kissing him again with a quiet whine of satisfaction in the back of his throat.
“Doesn’t seem like he wants to be put down, Hermione,” he pointed out.
“Can we go somewhere more private?” Harry asked. Draco smiled softly and nodded.
“You offered to kill my Muggle family.”
Harry practically jumped on Draco, straddling his legs, and grabbed his face to kiss him enthusiastically. The sheer force of this gesture nearly toppled Draco over. “Say it again,” Harry requested breathlessly, between kisses. Draco's arms circled Harry's waist and pulled him close. “Draco, say it again.”
“I said don't make a choice because of me! Fuck, and that's what you did, I didn't want you to choose because of anything other than what you thought was right.” Harry looked to his side and avoided looking at Draco.
“Hey, Harry,” Fred said from Harry’s right.
Ron groaned loudly.
“He's just a boy!” Molly cried.
“Yeah?”
“Oh? You like that, do you?”
Malfoy looked at him with wide eyes. “I made this so much worse by not listening, didn’t I?” he asked.
The things that Draco's fingers made Harry feel were sinful. The repetitive feeling of his prostate being brushed made his whole body tense in anticipation. Harry rode out his orgasm on Draco's thigh, while slipping his hand into Draco's pants and pulling him over the edge as well.
“You’re so… willing,” Draco murmured in astonishment. “How? You don’t seem put off or nervous at all.”
“Really,” Sirius affirmed. “Now, let's go back inside, shall we?” Draco grabbed Harry's hand and they followed Sirius back into the house.
“Please don’t rip it,” he requested. She nodded.
, trying to stray so far from how I’ve been raised, as far as prejudice and superiority. I
“I attacked Mr. Weasley in that dream,” Harry corrected. “I
“I mean… I suppose,” Harry replied slowly, confused. “I've been really pissed off before and I've almost cried…”
“Harry, what’s going on?” Draco interrupted, voice sounding frantic yet his face remaining cool and collected.
“Oh, that’s Freddie,” Sirius mused. “He loves chin scratches.” Harry curiously scratched right under Freddie’s mouth, and the cat did nothing. Just blinked at him with confused blue eyes.
“I’ve checked everywhere, ‘Mione. He’s not anywhere,” Harry sighed. “I’m worried.”
Draco stopped massaging Harry’s head and leaned over to look at him. Harry blushed. “You said…” He trailed off.
“No,” Draco replied.
“I said I don’t know,” Harry repeated. Draco sighed and walked to the other side of Harry’s bed.
“Now, as much as I love talking to you, Hermione, I need you to leave the room, because I need to wrap your Christmas present.” Hermione scoffed and shook her head, but stood up nonetheless.
“You wrote me a letter explaining why you love me because you thought I might be overwhelmed.” Harry rose an eyebrow. Draco opened his mouth to speak again, but Harry beat him to it. “It was two pages long.”
“I can’t do anything else,” Draco retorted, too quickly, “your body is on my arm and if I moved you would have w—fallen off this bed.” Harry resisted rolling his eyes. For a Slytherin, Draco was a terrible liar.
“No,” Draco murmured. Harry interlaced his fingers in Draco’s and rested his head against Draco’s chest. Draco leaned into his ear. “I love you.”
“Mum, please! He’s my best friend, and I can’t just let him be depressed over Malfoy!” Ron whispered. She sighed and pinched her nose.
“But there was only one of them, Harry,” Draco pointed out with a frown.
“Why?”
“Go right ahead, Harry,” Sirius answered with a grin.
“A dress?” he asked. “What kind of dress?”
“It’s Christmas! Mum wants pictures, she said to wake you up. I’ve already got ‘Mione up, everyone else is downstairs,” Ron hissed. “Get up.”
mad.” George rose an eyebrow.
“Draco Malfoy,” he mumbled.
Draco moved a little faster, and a little harder, and he kept making Harry claw at the bedsheets and cry out. “Fuck you, Malfoy, I’m not going to break,” Harry snapped from his pillow, “move faster—
“Draco,” he whispered, taking his hand, “choose for yourself, yeah?” Harry smiled sadly. “Choose because it's what you believe. Choose a side because that's what you think is right. Don't let yourself get pressured into anything.”
Hermione scowled at him. “And who, exactly, do you have in mind who will tell the whole truth and not be biased toward Harry about this?” she demanded.
“If he were here, and he asked you to be exhibitionist and suck him off under the table right now, would you?”
“Nothing's ever my fault, Harry,” Draco joked, “I'm a Malfoy, and Malfoys are always perfect. And honestly, I was about ready to cry when I landed on the ground. That hurt.”
“Voldemort can speak it,” Harry answered.
Harry smiled softly and continued to read.
“Things will pick up after terms starts again,” Harry said, putting his wand in his pocket. “This has been really great, I hope you all decide to come back after Winter Hols.” Everyone started to leave the room quietly. Harry looked over and saw Cho Chang standing by a photo of Cedric Diggory, crying. He walked over to her.
“You don’t want to do that,” he warned. He grabbed her arm tightly when he felt Draco pulling his cock out of his jeans and pants.
The couple sat in silence for a minute before Harry spoke again.
“I’m going to be honest and say I don’t like her very much,” Draco admitted. Harry rolled his eyes. “Sorry, love, she’s too much like me, and I can barely stand myself.” Harry snorted.
“Lucius Malfoy needs to stop trying to control Draco. He's a child, not a dog,” Bill added.
“Yeah?” Draco smiled and nodded. Harry sighed. “Your dimples are the best things, they're so cute.” Draco's cheeks went pink.
Malfoy stared at him intently. Not necessarily maliciously, but intently. Harry blinked. Malfoy blinked back and sent him an annoyingly flashy smirk that did odd things to Harry’s stomach. He rolled his eyes and looked away, deciding to focus on the shininess of the House point system, his appetite forgotten for the afternoon. A piece of parchment and a quill appeared in front of him. Harry looked at Malfoy again, eyebrow raised. Malfoy scribbled something on a parchment by him, and the words appeared on Harry's paper.
“Endless pestering, I’m guessing?” Harry teased cautiously. Draco let out a breathy laugh.
“Why do you think I wear them, Draco?” Harry purred. “It keeps you staring.” The pressure on his arse was a lot, now, and Draco canted his hips up, searching for more friction. Harry fell forward in surprise and caught himself by the hands on Draco’s chest.
“I just love you.”
“He gave you jewelry? Let me see,” Hermione spoke up. Harry held out his wrist and she drew out her wand, casting detection spells rapidly before he yanked his arm away.
Draco joined him a moment later and reached into his own pocket, pulling out a short silver chain. He blushed a pretty pink color that spread across his cheeks and handed it to Harry. The bracelet had a thin silver chain and clasp, and a silver flat piece engraved with what seemed to be a date. “Wh—is this…”
“God, Draco,” Harry breathed. Draco hummed around him softly. “Your mouth is perfect.” Draco pulled his mouth off and looked up at Harry, pulling a lip between his teeth and smiling.
“Well, Freddie, there's our answer,” George said cheerfully. “And, Harry, if you were to wake up tomorrow to see Malfoy completely naked and in your bed, what would you do?”
“No, but I don’t think he’d mind if you woke him up tonight.” Ron stood. “I should get home. You can come if you’d like.”
“Harry, it’s okay,” she said calmly. “I adore Draco, he’s very charming, and I’d love to see the others again. Anyway, I already over-estimated and bought way too many groceries, since Charlie and Bill can’t come this year, so I’m glad I can put them to use now.” Harry smiled in relief.
They all laughed.
“I blame you for that,” he said. Harry pulled away from the hug with a playful scowl.
“You’re so sensitive,” Draco purred. His other hand came to haul Harry up by the shoulder so that his chest was pressed against Harry’s back. He wrapped an arm around Harry in not a possessive way but in a protective, reassuring way. He kissed Harry’s cheek. “Harry.” Harry choked on his breath. “Baby, look at me.” Harry tilted his head to the left, where Draco was speaking into his ear. Draco kissed along the tear tracks on Harry’s face and even Harry’s eyelid before kissing his lips and eliciting a moan. He retracted his fingers and held Harry lightly for a moment before kissing his neck. “How?”
Harry’s whole upper body stiffened and he embarrassingly burst into tears, sobbing, begging Draco—for what, he didn’t know anymore. Draco’s intentions were to obviously torture him with overstimulation.
“I’ve never,” Hermione said thoughtfully, “had sex.” Everyone else but Ron drank.
“No, of course, you’ll stay here, don’t be ridiculous.” Sirius waved his hand at nothing and continued, “you’re my cousin and you won’t be staying in any trashy hotels as long as I have this house.” Draco smiled brightly, and Harry’s stomach jumped and did a flip at the sight. It was just a smile, he should not have been so affected by it.
“So, who's the lucky bloke?” Remus asked. Harry played with the hem of his sweater.
“My birthday is June 5th,” he said instead, “my favorite color is purple—yes, purple, stop giving me that look. My favorite food is soupe à l’oignon,” Draco continued, ignoring Harry’s question, “dessert is chocolate covered strawberries, and despite popular opinion I actually
“I know, Hermione,” he croaked, “I can’t believe this is happening right now.”
“Scared, Potter?” he purred. Harry shot him a glare.
“Pfft. Not now. Ask me after that truth or dare game Davis was telling me about tomorrow.” Harry got up and poked Draco in the chest before walking out into the common room to strike up a conversation about Dung Bombs with George, who was lounging on a couch in front of the fireplace.
Draco fingered him open slowly and teasingly, and it drove Harry mad. He tried to pull Draco closer by the waist to get friction, but Draco just smirked and nibbled on Harry's earlobe. Harry retaliated by biting onto Draco's neck and avidly working on leaving a large bruise in his wake. He worked a hand in between their bodies and was pleased to find that Draco was already hard. “Draco—”
“You did?”
“Okay,” he whispered. Draco pulled his wand out and murmured a spell that Harry had never heard before. Suddenly, the room filled with thousands of stars and constellations.
“Please don't,” he said softly.
“Expelled?” Ron wondered in amusement. They laughed.
Harry did, and he talked as he did it, and finally, at the end of the train ride, they had figured some very big thing that Harry didn't quite understand out except what caused Harry and Voldemort to be connected.
“I think you should. A lot of people are in it, even some Slytherins. Hermione, Ron and I started it because Umbridge isn’t teaching us anything of use.”
“Wh—no! George Weasley!” she scoffed. “Don't go mad, you're far too young. I'm not giving any underage person in this house any alcohol at all.” George sighed and shrugged to Fred on his left.
“Huh. So you'd shag Blaise?”
“Poncy git,” Harry muttered to himself. He scowled at Malfoy and flipped him an annoyed finger one last time before he set the parchment under his untouched plate.
“I wanted to give you something,” Draco murmured. He locked the door. Harry rose an eyebrow and sat on a cushioned bench.
“Draco,” Harry moaned into his mouth, “please do me a favour.”
“I’m hurt,” Draco whispered. Harry shot him an irritated look. And louder, “yeah, Potter, let’s see who got the pleasure of marking the Chosen Neck.” Harry rolled his eyes and didn’t even bother to lean back when Draco leaned forward.
“Watch out, Draco,” he hummed, “They've adopted you into the family now. Mrs. Weasley will hug you any time she sees you.”
“You’re such a smartarse.” Harry grinned. Draco kissed him on the forehead. “Prat.”
“Oh fuck,” he groaned. He moved his hands behind him to Draco’s thighs to support himself.
“Care to prove that claim?” Another two steps.
“What happened?” Ron asked. Harry recalled the interaction exactly how it was, crying turned to sobbing at the end. “Harry… every couple fights. You're going to be okay, mate. You just heard some stuff without context, and if I heard what you did I would think the same thing.” Harry nodded. “Just give Malfoy the rest of the day and then maybe write him a letter later tonight.” Harry nodded again. “I'm going to go get you some tea, okay? I'll bring Hermione up here and we'll take your mind off it. Just lie down in bed, yeah?”
“Prongslet? I'm upstairs! Come on up!” Harry tread up the staircase of Number 12 Grimmauld Place and was met with a bone-crushing hug from Sirius when he turned a corner.
The bell rang and Harry almost didn’t register it, but Malfoy backed off and pulled Harry’s hood back up before running off.
Draco smirked. “Are you sure? I would think you’re the one who wants to see me naked most of all, considering that we’re routinely fucking.” Harry felt his cheeks warm.
“Fine,” he conceded. “But no Truth or Dare.”
“Everything okay there?” Mrs. Weasley asked sweetly.
“But—”
“I do not,” Draco denied.
“Okay?”
“Right…” Harry yawned again.
“Hey, little James! How's my favorite godson?” the man asked happily. Harry smiled into the hug.
“Oh, yes, it seems to have slipped my mind that you’re an untainted flower,” Draco purred. He took another step toward Harry.
“Truth or Dare.” Blaise had asked the question to George, who grinned.
“What did you two do while you were gone?” Hermione asked suspiciously. Harry shrugged and looked down at Draco with a small grin. Draco rose an eyebrow and smirked.
Less than six minutes later, Draco was coming down Harry’s throat with a groan. Harry swallowed and pulled off with a deep breath. Draco pulled Harry up and kissed him.
“Yeah,” Zabini chimed knowingly. “He would. So would everyone else. Get on with it, Potter.” Harry bit his cheek to stop a grin. “Or we’ll start guessing.” Draco rose a challenging eyebrow with a smirk. Harry hesitantly moved forward and his lips brushed Draco’s. The blond coaxed Harry’s mouth open with his tongue and it slipped inside. Harry thought he felt a smile on Draco’s lips but there was no way of knowing for sure and he didn’t want to stop the kiss. These kinds of kisses were rare; the post-orgasmic feeling always left them floaty and breathless, and when Draco did kiss Harry like this, he always left right after. Harry was still attempting - and failing, honestly - to deny any feelings past sexual attraction and he doubted Draco had any feelings for him at all. It wasn’t as if they had been friends before they started getting each other off. It was just sexual attraction, and Harry knew that. Several people started murmuring in shock and some gasped.
“You too.” Draco stood and hugged Harry tightly. “Goodnight.” Harry kissed the nearest place he could, and that happened to be Draco's stomach. “Now go.”
After shutting the shower off, Harry was a bit hesitant to go out of the stall naked to grab a towel across the bathroom but did it quickly anyway and wrapped it around his hips, sure to hide those bruises. He grabbed his clothes off the floor and walked back toward the boys’ dorms, hyper-aware of people staring at him. He jumped when a Ravenclaw in a higher year grabbed his wrist. “Do I know you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you understand? I don't want him near you,” Draco ordered lowly. Harry swallowed and nodded. Draco dropped a soft kiss against Harry's lips, hands moving back up to cradle his face. Harry grabbed one of Draco's hands and kissed his knuckles, lips brushing the Malfoy crest ring that rested on his left ring finger.
"I'll make do. Thank you, Mr. Weasley."
The cat just meowed.
“That was you? That had the whole Gryffindor and Hufflepuff side of the Hall smelling terrible for weeks!” He scrunched his nose at the memory. Draco grinned and grabbed Harry's hand under the table.
Draco pulled Harry out into an empty compartment on the Hogwarts Express.
He crawled back in between Draco’s legs and again sucked Draco into his mouth. Draco grabbed Harry’s hair with a groan and pushed his head down to guide his cock into Harry’s mouth further. Harry offered no resistance and happily complied. Draco did this again, multiple times until Harry felt his eyes watering from the tip of Draco’s cock pushing into the back of his throat repeatedly. Draco shuddered and pulled Harry’s mouth off, breathing heavily. Harry used the back of his hand to wipe away the small amount of spit that had gathered on his lower lip and fallen onto his chin. He caught his breath and Draco moved his hand from Harry’s hair to run a thumb along his shiny, swollen lips.
“Mate, it was a smile,” he murmured, face reddening. “Just a smile.” Ron hummed.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed, tilting Harry’s head to the side by his chin and kissing down it roughly.
Harry experimentally kissed the spot right above the start of Draco's collarbone again. Draco let out a shaky breath. “Harry.”
“I want to fuck you so bad,” Draco growled. He rocked his hips forward again. “Do you feel that? Feel how hard I am for you?” Harry nodded. “And you’d be so tight, damn. I’m your first, aren’t I?” Another nod. “Good. Merlin, you’re so willing. Look at you. All red and flushed and hard from me just talking about how I’m going to fuck you.” Harry groaned. He didn’t know if it was because of the promise that Draco was going to fuck him or because his arse was being squeezed brutally again or if it was the steady rocking of Draco’s hips against his. “You're just gagging for it,” Draco growled softly in his ear.
“He's saying that he loves you but he's trying to sleep,” Draco said, and Harry heard the amusement in his voice. “I think it's quite possible that he's telling you to go away.” Harry hummed his affirmation into Draco's collarbone.
“I thought Hufflepuff was supposed to be the angelic House,” he grumbled as Draco walked over to him and dropped his knees on either side of Harry’s outstretched legs, sitting on his thighs. Another one of those feral grins appeared on Draco’s face.
“So,” Draco repeated. Harry frowned.
“Is he sleeping?” he whispered.
“I bet… that I can make you come just from my mouth.” Draco’s teeth grazed Harry's ear.
“I don’t know.”
“Definitely,” Draco agreed.
Draco kissed him again. Harry kissed back and his hands found the sides of Draco's face.
“That’s all I get?” Draco pouted.
“What do you need?” Draco asked him softly. “What can I help you with?”
“How—about instead of talking about it—you
“Merlin, Harry, be quiet and listen!” Draco interrupted, seemingly frustrated. “I'm not regretting choosing your side of this war because doing that means I'm regretting being with you. And I don't.”
“I’ll teach you.” Harry turned around and smiled. Draco pressed their foreheads together.
They both turned at hearing a loud shattering sound. Ginny was standing there, broken glass and a puddle of pumpkin juice surrounding her feet.
“It was good. I told Sirius and Remus about Draco and I. They took it well. Sirius said it's unexpected but if it works, then he can't say anything about it.”
“I just wish he had an option, to do what he wanted to,” Harry mumbled. Ron and Hermione walked over to him and wrapped him in a group hug. He felt two more bodies wrap around him, and he concurred that he had the twins, and his two best friends piled around him. More weight came in from all sides and Harry suspected that he had a whole-family Weasley hug on his hands.
“What a lovely thing to hear you say,” Draco murmured.
“I don’t want to think about it. I want you to fuck me,” Harry said, lust overcoming slight irritation.
After getting settled into the Burrow, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all trapped in Ron's bedroom together, Harry turned to Hermione.
“Yeah. I know,” he said. “I just hate sneaking around. It’s stressful, and I hate it when Astoria Greengrass pins you with her creepy look that makes her seem like she wants to eat you.”
trying, I know my father’s and You-Know-Who’s beliefs are wrong, that this is a pointless path that will lead in death or Azkaban for fifty years. I just can’t be a better person overnight. It’s going to take time. I don’t want... people to think I’m not trying.” Draco took a step towards Harry as they walked, and when Harry didn’t move away, Draco grabbed his hand. Harry squeezed it and let out a surprised yelp when Draco pulled them into a quiet passageway.
“Oh, no, dear,” she hurried, vanishing the washcloth from her hand. “I've just finished up. You look troubled. What's bothering you?”
“Sorry, I’m what?”
“I am—essentially—a house-elf to them whenever I'm there. Think of any chore, I do it. Cleaning the floor with bleach until it sparkles. Washing dishes. Scrubbing the couch. Washing the bathtub.
“Say that again,” Draco demanded. “Weasley, say that again, in those exact words.” Ron did. “I know of something like that. I read about it or heard about it, it’s some ancient, Dark magic. Worse than Blood magic. I remember my father shutting me up about the subject incredibly quickly. He yelled at me to never ask about it again. It’s an evil practice, not just Dark magic. It’s pure evil. You have to be a sadistic bastard to do something like it, I just can’t—I can’t place it!” he groaned. “Damn it!”
“Please,” Harry groaned. “I love the rain.” Draco sighed and shook his head but stood up anyway. Harry laughed and jumped off the bed, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him toward the door.
“Of course you did, you're Hermione,” Ron said.
"What about your family?" Harry asked worriedly. "I don't want you relationship with them to be even more sour."
“Children!” Mrs. Weasley yelled up the stairs. “Come down here! It’s eleven forty-five!”
“Well, I’m glad you’re coming to terms with your sexuality, then, Ron,” he chuckled. Ron shoved his shoulder again, and he nearly fell off the twin bed.
“Draco, I love you and your sense of humor.” He paused. “You'll have to go back tonight, won't you?”
“This is
“And I trust you both with mine,” Harry cut in, “Hermione, I know why you think going to Snape is a terrible idea, and I’ll admit, he’s not my favorite person either, but Draco’s right. Snape will be honest, and then we can go to Professor Dumbledore and tell him what Snape told us, and Dumbledore will tell us what to do next.”
He was currently pushed up against a huge oak tree, one leg hooked around Draco’s hips and the other standing on its tiptoes as Draco snogged him senseless. Harry’s hands were threaded in the soft platinum blond hair and Draco had his arms wrapped around Harry’s lower back. They had snuck away from the rest of their Magical Creatures class. But Harry was done with being confused. He pulled lightly on Draco’s hair and they separated their mouths.
“I lied, before,” Harry admitted. “To Dumbledore about that dream with the snake and Arthur Weasley.” Draco hummed in curiosity. “I wasn't watching the snake attack him. I was the snake attacking him.”
Ron tries to un-fuck the mess Harry and Draco made.
“Fuck, you’re so small and tight around me, Harry,” he groaned. “You should see yourself like this. Gorgeous.” Harry blushed. The only thing going through his mind was
“That’s brilliant!” Draco exclaimed to himself, “how did I not see it?”
"George, he gave me a blowjob in front of the whole school," Harry snorted. "Granted, it was under a table, but Draco's passed grabbing my arse in public already."
“In Ron's room, dear,” Mrs. Weasley hummed softly. Harry nodded and skipped steps up the stairs and burst into Ron's room.
“I was already doing that, but yes, I suppose now that you have my sweater we are the perfect stereotypical couple now.”
“Wait!” Draco exclaimed. Harry stopped and turned around to see his hoodie being thrust at him.
Harry and Draco looked at each other and laughed quietly. They set all of the charms again and Harry pulled the covers back, causing Draco’s erection to spring back up.
“They won't care,” Ron replied. “As long as Sirius makes sure you don't die, but you'll be fine.” He nudged Harry's shoulder. “Mate, you know that none of us care, right? I mean, I'm not sure if any of us, except maybe Percy, are completely straight. So, if that's been weighing on you, we don't care whether you like blokes or girls or nobody at all, or other people who identify as whatever. It is a bit of a shock that you're dating the ferret, but we'll get over it eventually. And, if he ever hurts you he'll have a whole group of rabid Weasleys set on him.” Harry grinned.
“Draco…”
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice broke Harry out of his daze. He looked at her.
“That’s rude.” There was a lull in conversation as Draco helped Harry out of his trainers and jeans. “Will you fuck me?” Harry asked suddenly. “Please? I really want you to.” Draco hummed softly and placed Harry’s legs in his pyjamas, pulling them up over his hips.
“Oh?”
“Did you just call me a whore?” Harry teased, accepting a quick kiss. “Only yours, love.” Draco rolled his eyes. “What is a Horcrux?”
Harry stumbled through the Weasleys’ fireplace in their living room and saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley sitting on the couch and drinking tea while holding hands.
“Hmm… perhaps.”
“Well then, I suppose I'll have to see you more often,” Draco replied warmly. “I'll see you all around.” He went to kiss Harry's forehead again. “Don't forget about me, Potter,” he warned. Harry rolled his eyes.
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but Harry was suddenly being lightly shaken awake. “Hmm?”
“Scared, Potter?” he purred, smirking.
“Astoria Greengrass is a Third Year and a girl. No part of that is appealing to me,” Draco said. Harry bit his cheek. “And I can’t help it if I’m appealing to her.”
Draco kissed his cheek. “It will be. I'll make it okay.” He stood up and pulled the shower curtain closed so it covered Harry's body up. He walked out of the room, returning with Hermione in tow right as Harry was washing his hair.
“You know… I seem to remember the promise of really hot, dirty, kinky sex while I'm sober,” Harry rose an eyebrow. “Well, here I am, sober and almost completely naked already. And very touch starved,” he added as an afterthought. Draco kissed his neck and picked him up by the arse, setting him down on what Harry assumed was Ron's desk. He rolled his eyes and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck when Draco kissed him. “I was mostly kidding when I told Ron last night that I would let you fuck me on his desk, just so you know.”
Harry hummed contentedly. “I love you, too.” He pulled the necklace out from under his shirt and twisted it around his finger loosely. “I seem to remember a bet? And a promise?”
“Nothing, it’s just funny how Draco Malfoy is talking to me about subtlety,” he teased. “You aren’t exactly… not… what’s that word…” Harry grinned. “Well, anyway, you’re very dramatic.” Draco scoffed. “I’m serious, you have always had a… certain preference for it.”
“Mmm… just a few trinkets you've likely never heard of, a few odd robes and trousers.” Draco shrugged. “And of course, you.”
“I mainly don’t want to see you get hurt, Harry. And I can say that Ron doesn’t want that either,” Hermione said reasonably. He sighed.
“A little,” Harry admitted. Draco moved one hand away from him and a few seconds later something soft was pressing into Harry's side. He looked over at it and saw a light grey sweatshirt, complete with a hood, a pocket, and drawstrings. “Is this yours?”
“Please don’t say anything. If you do, he and I could both get badly hurt. This is a new thing and we’re testing the waters, and would really like to keep it private for now,” he said quietly. Ginny hesitated for a second and Harry gave her a pleading look.
“You have now given me the right to officially call you my boyfriend.”
“You don't think you're straight?” he asked.
“I've—I've been okay,” she stuttered quietly. “Listen, I'm really—really sorry about my—about how I reacted—when I saw you and—and Malfoy, I was just shocked.”
There was silence at the other end of the door. “Malfoy… I know you love him, too,” Ron said softly. “I don’t like you, but I do love Harry. He’s my brother. I’m doing this for him. He’s devastated, so please, just—open the door.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"And Harry?" Hermione said as an afterthought, "you're the dork."
“Mum, would you hand me the bottle, please?” George asked across the table.
“I love you, too.”
“Aren’t I supposed to be the one holding you?” Draco asked suspiciously.
“Well…” He nuzzled Harry’s neck and smirked. “Would you
“Yeah. It does.”
“I love this kid,” Sirius announced suddenly. “Best damn godson ever.”
“Harry, there's a letter for you,” Mr. Weasley said, coming into the living room where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were huddled up on the couch. He handed the pristinely folded parchment over to Harry, who opened it curiously.
“You’re not responsible for what she did.”
“We’re not going to be
“Please do.”
“Then I guess we should get back to the castle,” said Ron. “Try to catch some sleep.”
She put a piece of toast on her plate and Harry passed her the butter.
As the day went on Draco grew more anxious about his meeting with the headmistress. He ended up leaving the Great Hall halfway through dinner, and even though he went by his dormitory and tried to get a bit of homework done, he was still by her office almost fifteen minutes too early. He paced back and forth in the hallway for a while, then stepped up to the gargoyle that guarded the entrance. She hadn’t given him a password, but he assumed it would let him in when he had been invited.
Draco was very, very drunk. He had been about to fall asleep when Potter called him back. Potter said something Draco didn’t quite catch. And then he was messing up Draco’s hair. He laughed and ran his fingers through it and the touch sent a shiver through him. The hand curled around the back of his neck, fingertips still playing with strands of his hair, and the touch was warm and soft. Something was off about it. Potter was laughing. The warm hand didn’t move. Draco wasn’t sure what it was that was off, and he liked how it felt. He liked the weight of it and he liked how Potter looked this close, the brightness in his drunk eyes and the way his smile curled his lips. He didn’t think Potter had ever actually smiled at him before.
Draco hesitated.
“I always return the books on time and I’ve never damaged any of them,” he said, just to offer some justification. “That’s more than can be said for most other students in this school.”
“NO!” screamed Lucius.
Hermione crossed her arms.
, that this
"Are you okay?" Ron said, sounding alarmed.
on us,” Draco drawled.
Harry didn’t apologize to Hermione in the morning. She was unnecessarily cheery and polite to him at breakfast and clearly wanted to pretend the fight hadn’t happened, so Harry went along with it. They were almost halfway through the school year now and had long ago settled into their routines, so it was easy to go through the motions of the day as if nothing had happened. Even Harry being tense and irritable had become part of their new dynamic. He did sleep better and was doing more of his homework by day now, but that hadn’t improved much on his mood. He had realized about a week ago that this was as good as it was going to get. He had returned to Hogwarts with a knot of tense apprehension in his stomach that had never been there before, but he had convinced himself that sooner or later that feeling would go away. Even if the castle reminded him of all the things he had lost and of how out of place he was there now, sooner or later that claustrophobic and oppressive air would have to subside and it would once again become the place of wonder, freedom and safety that it had been when he was younger, and he would feel at home again. But it was November now, and he still caught himself walking on tiptoes down the stairs, keeping close to the walls, sitting hunched over his food at meals. Things he hadn’t done for years. Things he used to do when he lived with the Dursleys.
“Like spreading out our own patronuses,” she said.
He fell into step beside her.
His heart races as he spies on the conversation, everything he already knew being confirmed, getting angrier and angrier with every second he has to stay silent and listen to them. And of course that anger has nothing to do with the way Pansy Parkinson clings to Malfoy. It doesn’t have anything to do with the way they talk about Ginny. Not at all. Last year was an eternity ago; this is about Draco’s suspicious behaviour, his vague bragging and the mark Harry suspects he’ll find on his arm. Harry forgets to stay entirely still, so when his friends leave, Draco stays behind. He curses Harry, breaks his nose and leaves him under the invisibility cloak. That, too, has nothing to do with last year.
“Ernie is a Tornados fan.”
"Sure, that's not suspicious at all."
“Yeah, well try to be nice to her about it. We’re all trying to deal with things our own way. She’s just worried about you because she spent all of last year trying to keep you alive, and then you went ahead and died anyway.”
“That wasn’t what you meant?” he said, interrupting Potter.
“What? Me and Hermione?”
Harry flinched and Draco and Granger both raised their wands, looking around for what had startled him.
. He had no idea what that was about. A joke? Except that wasn’t like Malfoy at all, and it hadn’t
His anger curled back at her icy tone, but he did not apologize. He looked away. Narcissa turned back to Lucius. She brushed her lips lightly over his cheek. He didn’t seem to notice. Draco wanted to throw up.
And maybe he had sometimes kept out of the way of that new closeness because he had been slightly jealous. Not because it had changed how they felt about him – Ron was still his best mate, Hermione was still like a sister to him – but even though he knew it wasn’t fair, he sometimes envied them that they were together after the war, when it had broken him and Ginny apart. He still missed her sometimes. It had been good with her.
, he didn’t say. His voice hadn’t sounded right. He was walking next to Harry and for a brief moment, he felt the warm brush of Harry’s hand against his own. He didn’t say anything. They reached the next staircase.
“I agree with most of what you said.”
“Draco, dear, I’m so sorry, I don’t understand-“
"I made coffee earlier, think there's still some left, if you want it."
“It would still be comforting, I think.”
Draco nodded.
They were speaking in low voices, whispering to each other even though there was no one to hear them. Draco pulled his own watch out of his pocket. Arguing was wasting their time as well.
“No one’s here,” he said and held the door open.
He nodded to them and then left, dragging Alain with him out of the Great Hall. Everyone watched them go, and only when the two of them had disappeared through the doors did they turn back to their friends. Mutterings spread down the tables. Pansy looked mildly horrified, Draco was sure he wasn’t any better. An angry flush was still visible on Weasley’s cheeks. Granger cleared her throat.
“Trying to save the nerves in her skin,” said Madam Pomfrey without looking up.
people in Dark Arts - I heard you were good at it, too. I heard that the spell seemed to come naturally to you.”
He opened his eyes and looked into the kind face of a silver otter. He turned his head and there was Harry, kneeling down and leaning over him with a hand on his shoulder. His expression was raw, scared. He pulled back when Draco opened his eyes, allowing him room to sit up. Draco carefully pushed himself upright, grimacing at the pain from his head and his bruised elbow.
He shrugged. He felt detached from the whole conversation. He was only vaguely irritated that she insisted on beating around the bush instead of just getting to the point. He had known it was coming at some point. He was surprised it hadn’t happened sooner.
“How do you expect us to clean up without our wands?” asked Draco.
“Maybe I shouldn’t have asked Ginny to come.”
Harry followed where he was pointing to and saw the angular shape of a darkened house a bit further down.
"Harry-" Ron began but Harry cut him off:
“Harry?” she said, taking a hesitant step towards them.
“Actually, that applies to all situations,” said Ginny. “We shouldn’t talk to each other outside of this room in case people notice. Obviously we don’t talk much now, but we’ll need something like the coins for arranging new meetings.”
“But there’s no need for Parkinson to be there.”
And then before he could answer, she had taken a pair of scissors with her and gone back to where she was trying to kill her own plant.
Ron shrugged.
“As far as I know, Malfoy doesn’t have an invisibility cloak and I wasn’t spared from endless hours of Malfoy-theories, so…” Granger shrugged.
“Would you…” Draco stopped to clear his throat.
Potter scoffed.
“I do,” Harry said. “He’s really different from-“
“They won’t mind,” he said again and Draco allowed him to pull the hand free.
“No,” he said flatly.
“Shit,” she muttered.
Harry nodded. He stood awkwardly at the edge of the group, unsure of what to do with himself. Ginny was still scowling.
“They should at least give us the right ingredients,” said Ron as he and Harry stood up. “It isn’t fair if it’s
“I was never a big fan of your father, but I think I’d be happy to get to see my father even if he was in Azkaban.”
“Yeah,” he said, straightening up a bit. “Yeah, I’ll be studying herbology in Sweden, actually. In Uppsala. The school has rooms for foreign students, so…”
He stepped back out of the niche.
"Sure," Harry said.
Draco and Mark finally came back and Harry felt his shoulders drop in relief. He accepted his beer gratefully.
“Okay, goodnight,” she said, with a quick smile to both of them.
She huffed.
“And the other day,” Malfoy continued, speaking more carefully but still without taking his eyes off Harry. “The things I said – I’m not going to pretend that I didn’t say them. I know I did, and I’m sorry, but I don’t think I would have said any of it if I hadn’t been to Azkaban. While we were there, I accidentally got out of reach of the patronus. It was only a couple of seconds, it shouldn’t have meant anything, but I wasn’t really myself afterwards. That’s why I came back late, too. The other day, I just wanted you to leave me alone. I said what I thought would make you the most angry. It wasn’t about them. And I don’t know why I wanted you to be angry. I just didn’t have enough… space in my head, and I wanted you to go away.”
“Yeah, it was. Goodnight.”
After Potions they had Charms, and Harry realized something was wrong when Hermione still hadn’t looked at him the entire lesson. He also had an uncomfortable feeling he knew what it was.
"Oh," he said, staring at it while he turned it between his fingers.
And Draco was about to say something else when he stopped himself, because Potter was smiling at him, and that wasn’t supposed to make him feel fluttery at all. For a moment he was at a loss for words as a gaping hole of dread opened in his stomach. Because that couldn’t be it. That wasn’t right. Then he gathered himself, forced out words, hoping that Potter hadn’t noticed his hesitation.
He nodded.
Potter shrugged.
“I can’t say for sure,” he finished, “but it’s the only way it makes sense to me. It would also explain why there hasn’t been any public debate about removing the dementors even though they joined the Dark Lord during the war. The safest way to avoid any discussions of an uncomfortable issue would be if everyone agreed that it was fine as it was and nothing had to change, right? And as far as I know, it was a unanimous vote to keep them as guards of Azkaban. Unanimous votes don’t happen on the Wizengamot, so that in itself is a sign that something is wrong.”
“We’ve been beating you for years.”
Malfoy scoffed.
“Like I said, I needed to talk to you and you wouldn’t let me. If I’d just walked up to you in The Great Hall, your private army would have lynched me.”
“No. She’s in Wales.”
to do, you’re apologizing and begging for their approval and trying to be one of them. And I’m not. I can’t go around hating myself for it just because they tell me to, but I also can’t defend myself if you’re right there next to me condemning everything we did. They don’t like me. I’m not
“I thought about doing it this year too, but none of the other Gryffindors in our year are staying so…” He shrugged. “How about you, are you okay with going home?”
“Pansy-“ Draco began as she had started to stand up.
He grinned.
He gestured vaguely. He sort of expected Malfoy to protest, people always did when he tried to tell them this, but even if Malfoy was asking for his help, he wasn’t about to insist on Harry’s greatness. He just shrugged.
“Sure,” he said. “I forgot how little you care for manners.”
“I thought you were mad about that.”
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “It’s difficult with her at the moment. I’ll write to her.”
“You really shouldn’t walk by yourself!” called Draco after him. “You’re going to fall and break your neck on the stairs, and guess who will be charged with murder when you do!”
“Fine,” she said.
His stag walked ahead, leading the way. Hermione and Draco’s patronuses were on either side so they formed a small, triangular spearhead of light that parted the darkness ahead. The patronuses illuminated the space between them, but then reached only a few inches out. It looked odd too, the way the light just stopped, as if the darkness was something solid, a wall ahead of them. It had gotten colder too. Harry could see the thin mist of his breath in the air.
“Why?”
Except that wasn’t entirely true either, because that also belonged to a time when Ron and Hermione would never have sat that close, when Hermione wouldn’t have allowed Ron to fall asleep on her and Ron wouldn’t have dared to touch her that way anyway.
Pansy had practically been in the guy's lap when he left and it had been pretty obvious where things were headed. It was part of the reason he had decided to skip out in the first place - he didn't fancy having first row seats to that performance.
“They did switch sides,” he said. “Right at the end.”
. In twenty years I’m still going to be that pureblood bitch to all of them. So if you think you’re not abandoning me by pretending you’re not just as much of a Slytherin as I am, you’re lying to yourself. And you
It was another thing he hadn't thought about in months, had actually totally forgotten until seeing Malfoy's face had triggered the memory. Ron looked surprised.
“Right, no, of course… So you’re together, then?”
“It’s not that simple.”
“I’ll tell you on the train,” he said. “Let’s go find a carriage.”
Potter shrugged.
Potter looked surprised.
"Malfoy?" he said, only a little out of breath.
She was quiet for a moment.
“Might be.”
“Holy shit,” she breathed.
“Some dumb thing from when you were 11?” she said, looking unimpressed.
"Hm. You don't strike me as the type."
“So we’re meeting the Weasleys at the station?”
