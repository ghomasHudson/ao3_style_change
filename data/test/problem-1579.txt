Draco puts it on with impressive disregard for his hair and the ladies giggle delightedly.
Halfway through a messy sort of spin, the magic relaxes its grip on Harry and he stumbles, arms flailing, until he ends up on his backside, flushed and breathing hard.
He tries. Pansy is always telling him that he spends too much time thinking about Potter, but then she’s been saying that since they were both eleven years old. It’s just habit, that’s all.
Draco trails soft kisses along his jaw and sighs against his skin. “We should probably move from here before Ida spots us from her kitchen window.”
“Needle… just be good, Needle,” Draco sighs.
The bath is deep, oversized and made of cast iron, enamelled to match the rest of the suite and lifted from the smooth stone floor on little feet in the shape of leaping koi. The water spills from four gleaming taps, creating steam that billows upwards and frosts the stained glass in the window, a recent addition featuring a seascape design based on one of Rose’s drawings, the sight of which never fails to make Harry smile. On a shelf beside the bath, Harry’s bottles and potions sit in a neat line, looming over a little paper package which he now reaches for.
Draco lets out a long, steady breath. He rakes a hand through his hair, blinks, and then puts on his coat, almost tripping over Needle in the process.
“Why?” Ron asks, clearly baffled.
“There are worse things,” Harry says, just as Jean bustles into the room with a tray and sets it down besides Harry’s coffee cups. “Don’t drink anything Florean gives you, though. He’s great with ice cream but his tea is…”
“I brought it from Sage,” Draco objects, ruffling the pages of his pilfered newspaper. “It was very good coffee. Why don’t you have a kettle in this godforsaken place?”
“If it makes you feel any better, I think I made Reuben cross, too,” Draco admits.
She doesn’t, of course, because he is trying. He is so far out of his comfortable place that she can almost taste it, but he is doing it anyway, and she thinks she might just have to hug him once this session is over.
Every word is bellowed as though Mr Fortuna is trying to wake the dead, and Draco finds himself taking a step backwards. Beside him, Harry is nodding and smiling and swaying slightly, as though he is being blown around by the force of the man’s voice.
As soon as the shop quietens, Harry leaves with Mr Borteg’s blessing and heads down to the flower shop to buy Esmee something bright and cheerful. The afternoon sunshine is warm on his skin and seems to gentle the wind until the touch of it feels merely refreshing. He walks through the busy shop, waving to a grateful Shan, and climbs the stairs to the flat. He opens the door to find Esmee curled up on her patchwork sofa, covered in blankets and scowling at a book while steam pours out from under her hair. It’s strange to see her without one of her colourful scarves, and in her fluffy red dressing gown she seems smaller than usual.
“He’s mad,” Draco says, peering at the nearest poster.
“One hundred and twenty next week, and still bothering the people of Portsmouth with his poetry,” she says. “He gives me hope.”
Molly says nothing but hugs him tightly, face pressed into his chest. When she steps back, her eyes are brimming and Harry’s jumper is slightly damp. Deciding not to draw attention to it, he sits down and allows her to resume buttering large, floury bread rolls.
“Not that I know of.”
“Remind me why I continue to come here?” he sighs, dropping Sam’s safety form into the nearest chair and folding himself down on top of it.
Hermione laughs, and Harry can’t blame her. Despite Draco’s obvious exasperation, there is something very earnest in his voice and it’s both hilarious and hopelessly appealing.
“Oh?”
Draco nods. “When he... when
Harry stares, taking in the sharp profile, the hair that gleams like silver in the near darkness, the strong pale hands that grip the oversized wheel just a little too tightly. The man gazes fixedly ahead at the pool of tarmac now illuminated by the bus’s headlights.
For several seconds, there is silence, and then Jean speaks up.
“Sorted,” she says, smiling at Harry and dropping several Galleons into his hand. He is fairly sure she has short-changed herself but he knows better by now than to challenge her on it. She pulls a patterned purple headscarf from a string-handled bag and shows it to Harry. “Do you think Es’ll like this?”
“Well, it’s alright,” Draco says, but Harry can tell that he’s trying not to look pleased.
**~*~**
Draco nods. “Right. You try that and I’ll go and do the tinsel on the outside.”
“My mother.”
Letting out a caught breath, Harry drops his wand and shoves his glasses onto his nose.
Right now, as Draco swings the wheel and plunges them into a huge, frost-glittery meadow, just because he feels like it, Harry has absolutely no idea where he stands, and he’s terrified. When Juno appears from nowhere and leaps onto his lap, he startles and swears under his breath. When he looks at Draco, he is smiling and luminous in the pale sunlight and Harry wants to put a stinging hex up his shirt.
“Because some people like to look as though they’ve made an effort sometimes,” Hermione says pointedly, glancing at her husbands ancient corduroy jacket and worn trainers.
Luna leans back on her elbows, pressing her weight against the cold, prickly grass.
“I saw the Prophet,” Draco says. He follows Harry and sets the cups down on the counter.
“That doesn’t sound very pleasant,” Draco says mildly.
“I’ll stop it if you will,” Harry cuts in, and, for no good reason that he can see, he reaches out and removes the piece of leaf from Draco’s eyebrow. “There you are.”
“He thought it might be revenge,” Draco says, looking like he wants to take a step back.
Rose nods. “Yes. But you have to bite the head off first.”
“We could,” he says, looking up at Draco from his armchair. “We could do anything.”
Harry glances at Draco and immediately wishes he hadn’t, because the bugger couldn’t look any more pleased with himself if he tried. Rolling his eyes, he thanks the stallholder, shoves the cube into his pocket and pushes his way through the crowd until he reaches the fountain.
“A crocodile, of course,” he murmurs, fitting his eye to the telescope. “Rainy days and crocodiles, they’re just always... oh, good grief.”
“Ah,” Harry says, nodding. It hurts. “I’d just burst in there, all ‘friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!’ and we’d have a crack team of Aurors down here in five minutes flat?”
“No,” Harry says hotly. “I just wanted to see what it was like. It was an accident.”
Harry watches him go, wand out and what seems like several miles of tinsel wrapped around his shoulders. When Draco is out of sight, he settles down to his task of turning several hundred green Christmas lights into purple Christmas lights to appease a finicky bus.
“Thanks, Uncle Harry.” She frowns. “How would I eat them if I didn’t chew?”
“Did they really put spiders in your bed?” he murmurs against Draco’s lips.
While the kettle bubbles away, he opens a window, allowing the cool air to sweep into the stuffy kitchen and clean away the musty smell of sickness. Carefully, and with one hand, he tidies the dirty dishes into a pile and wipes the sticky surfaces with a cleaning spell. He clears the table with a controlled sweep of his wand and stacks everything into a neat pile. When some semblance of order has been achieved, he opens the fridge to grab the milk and stops.
“I’ve seen you looking at my bath,” he says with a sly smile. “If we have one together, we might be done in time to see the alligators.”
“Look... lavender... sorrel... sage... there was a herb garden here,” he says, pointing to one corner, where a bedraggled collection of plants are now visible.
“Indeed, and what an experience it is,” Draco murmurs, swinging the Eye slowly along the street and feeling his stomach clench as he catches sight of Harry.
“I’m not sure I want to be a leader on my own,” Harry says, meeting Draco’s eyes.
Draco’s eyes go entertainingly wide. “Good grief.”
“We’re still here, it’s only Notice-Me-Not,” Corrie laughs, and when she waves her arms around, he can just make out the flap of her sleeve and the wiggle of her fingers before she fades into the background again.
Draco instinctively smoothes down the immaculate black fabric of his trousers, glimmer waving and spitting around him. He opens his mouth to speak but Sam gets there first, looking up from his desk with an amused glint in his eyes.
“She’s a Seer. Shouldn’t she always be expecting someone?” Draco says, smirking.
“They sent us a Timothy,” Harry points out, gulping his tea when his head starts to spin.
“In the tent.” Ginny rubs her hands together. “It’s much more exciting in here.”
Harry takes one last look around the empty bottom deck, sighs, and follows him.
Harry snorts. “Who didn’t?”
“Something like that,” Pansy says, putting on a new record and reclaiming her chair. “Potter hasn’t got any parents to infuriate, though, has he?”
Draco smiles to himself. Revenge is sweet.
He flees, ridiculous cloak flapping behind him. Mr Borteg lets out a dry bark of laughter and then returns to his back room, leaving Harry alone. Cheered, he gets out his box of cloths and starts polishing the shelves of bottles from top to bottom. It’s warm work, and by lunchtime he’s shed his shirt and jumper to work in trousers and a thin t-shirt despite the cold air brought in by each customer and the snow that continues to fall outside the window.
“Yes. I know Mr Borteg, you see,” the man says, and Harry fights down a smile. “I know he’s not here, of course, but you can trust me. I’m friends with his mother. I always get a discount.”
“Do what?” Draco asks, and the tone of his voice suggests to Harry that he knows exactly what.
Her fingers tighten around the strap of her bag as she silently debates her next move. Of course, some would say that the whole eclipse-pyjama madness should be enough to deal with for one morning, but on the other hand…
“It is a curse... a curse to know all that must come!” he cries, and Draco grins.
“Tack!” Stanley says, crawling out from under the bench. “Tack tack tack!”
“The other thing is… I don’t think I’ll be able to make lunch today,” he says, and Molly fixes him with a stern eye.
He’s an interesting sort of person and he’s never told her that she’s strange, which makes her curious as well as grateful. He had been surprisingly kind to her and Mr Ollivander when they’d been kept in the dark place, and unlike the other followers, whose glimmers had been bright and fierce, his had been almost non-existent. She had known there was something different inside him, something beside fear and regret, and all the arrogance in the world couldn’t mask it.
“I’m going to see if there are any sausages left,” Ginny says, rising and half-walking, half-dancing her way over to the food table.
The next few days slip by in a haze of work, food and sleep, as the residents of Strath Kinna cotton on to the fact that there is a source of reliable and relatively cheap labour in their midst. Word spreads quickly through the little village, and Harry and Draco find themselves taking on a whole range of jobs, from walking Great Danes and feeding pigs to stock-taking at the Post Office and cleaning for an elderly couple who insist on slipping five pound notes into their pockets when they aren’t looking.
“I knew that one,” she whispers, and he grins into his beer.
“He’d be flattered, Mum,” Charlie says firmly. “Handsome man, handsome dog.”
“I’ve got leftover chicken, potatoes… the carrots have all gone, I’m afraid,” she mutters, granting Harry a look that is equal parts apologetic and concerned. “There’s plenty of fresh bread if you need—”
George regards his brother with great benevolence. “Chocolate fudge, please. And I’ll think about it.”
“We’ve got a whole team in there,” Esmee says, smiling when the sharp scent of a cleaning charm wafts out into the shop. “Everyone’s pulling together, it’s wonderful.”
Draco rakes an anxious hand through his hair. “Should I be worried?”
“Thank you for that weird image,” Harry mumbles, pushing it away with some effort.
Draco tries not to look at the photograph but he can’t help it. The sight of it pulls him tight with an odd mixture of sadness and longing and he barely restrains himself from drawing his wand and knocking it out of her hands. Harry’s eyes are closed, he’s reaching for Draco as though genuinely terrified of losing him, and in the midst of all the astonishment and blurred colours, there’s a tiny smile on his face, pressed against Draco’s lips, that tips the whole world sideways.
“Do you really think he can’t stop?” asks Serafina, as Harry hunches over and performs what looks like a kind of chicken dance.
“Er…” Harry manages, gulping his mulled wine and burning his tongue. Juno appears at his feet, takes one look at the mass of birds and leaps onto his lap, purring and sticking her claws into his legs. “Fuck,” he whispers. Juno peers at him with her head on one side.
“Do you think so?” Draco asks cautiously.
“Will you stop?” he asks, passing the gravy to Louis.
“Thanks, Luna,” he calls after her, and she only feels a little bit guilty.
“We’d better go back to the bus, then,” Draco says. “Come on, Juno.”
“That’s right,” Luna says, smiling at him and then turning her most no nonsense look on Draco. “You might not like the taste of dancing at first, but that doesn’t stop it being good for you.”
“The picture. Is it your new boyfriend?”
Harry touches his arm gently and Draco turns to him, surprised. “Me neither. And I’ve never seen Mr Borteg look worried before. It was…”
“Of course,” Harry lies.
“It means do nothing,” Caroline says, bounding over to Luna and peering at the record on the turntable.
“Ah. People who eat and people with grandmothers… two more things to cross off the suspect list,” Harry says, grinning.
“Why are you being so nice to me?” he asks suspiciously.
As she showers and dresses and heads out to the home, she thinks about the new notes in her bag and smiles to herself. It’s not a complete plan, not quite yet, but she has the feeling that she’s only waiting for one last little piece so that she can tie it all together and unleash it on her unsuspecting friends.
Harry sighs, heart sore. “Thank you so much, Eilish, and I’d love to come, but I’ve already promised my family.”
The truth is, he has no idea.
“What exactly do you mean by evidence?”
“I didn’t know there was such a thing,” Harry says, grinning. He draws his wand and Summons a worn paperback into his hand. “I borrowed this from Hermione… just in case you felt like something was missing from your day.”
Across the Great Hall, Draco is pushing away his plate, meal practically untouched. Roast chicken is his favourite, but he’s clearly not in the mood for eating, and that fact makes something prickle dangerously inside Harry. He glances over at the staff table to find that only Slughorn, Madam Hooch and Trelawney are currently present. He makes the mistake of meeting Trelawney’s eyes and she stares at him, hand flying up to her mouth in alarm. As quickly as he can, Harry gets up, seeing her do the same. He is faster, though, and is safely inside the Gryffindor common room before she can catch up. The last thing he needs right now is to hear about his impending death.
“Be thankful it’s not a great tit,” Corrie says loudly, and in the row in front of them, several people giggle.
“You’ve never asked me that before,” Harry says, surprised.
She closes her eyes and thinks of the eclipse, the children’s whispers and Diagon Alley lit only by the light of a thousand glimmers. She thinks of Sam in his neat stripy pyjamas and feels better, and then thinks of Harry in his tatty old t-shirt and feels worse again. Feels a little bit sick, in fact, because perhaps she pushed them too hard. Embarrassed them too much. Perhaps it was all too obvious. Perhaps they caught on to her plans and turned their anger on each other.
“Ding-dong, verily the sky!” Harry sings, throwing himself into it and hoping for the best. He’s never been a confident singer, but belting out a familiar tune always seems to lift his spirits, and he’s obviously not alone; by the time they reach the climbing, breathless ‘glorias’, everyone around the table has joined in.
Draco glances at him. “I don’t know!”
Harry gulps at the cold air and reaches for his focus. Never mind Draco and his ways, he has promised his boss a full report of the morning’s festivities and he needs to pay attention. Mr Borteg has never asked him to work weekends, but Harry is happy to lend a hand during busy times or at moments like this one, when the distillation process demands every last bit of its master’s attention. Harry has time, and he has time because his life is in perfect balance.
When Ron retreats from the fire, leaving a soot-spattered hearth behind him, Harry discovers that it’s already half past nine and decides that he ought to get moving if he wants to spend some time with his new friends before lunch at the Burrow. Molly’s roasts are legendary, and though he can cook well enough for himself, he lacks the enthusiasm to create anything elaborate when he knows he’s going to be eating it alone, and he knows that her vast portions and tubs of leftovers will see him through half of the week.
Draco snorts. “Don’t let them play poker with you, Harry. You won’t stand a chance.”
The bus pings back to its normal shape in an instant, but Harry’s ears are ringing and he can’t decide if Draco looks cross and amused or just cross.
“You’ve eaten Ida’s macaron, haven’t you?” he asks her, and she purrs so deeply that he feels the vibration right up to his shoulder.
Mr Jennings peers at Needle. “What will we do if he gets ill?”
When they come back, it is, according to Sam’s schedule, time to begin. Luna takes a deep, fortifying breath and climbs up onto George’s stall. She wraps her fingers around the top spar and feels for the strings of the balloons, allowing herself to pretend that they are pulling her gently skyward as she gazes down at the sea of little faces and the curious glances of passing strangers. Lively music is already being piped down the alley, and the reporter with the Wizarding Wireless Network is loudly counting down each minute to the start of the eclipse, filling the gaps with astrological trivia and news updates. The Starlight Home for Children is going to have to make a hell of a racket if they want to be heard.
“Or both,” Harry suggests, and their eyes meet and hold for a little too long.
“A robbery?” Molly cries before George has time to answer. She tugs off his coat and pushes him into a chair. “Are you alright? Arthur, make George a cup of tea.”
“It wasn’t the time,” she says softly, and he nods.
“Tack tack tack tack tack!” says Stanley, thrilled to see yet more of his favourite people. These are the ones who had trouble flying, just like him. Unlike him, they are all getting much better at it.
Luna smiles and takes it. “Do you think a person can be in love without knowing it?”
“It’s not my cat,” Harry says, knowing he’s going to have to tell them sooner or later.
“I will,” Rose says, taking off her coat-cape and standing on tiptoes to hang it on the lowest arm of the tall, ebony rack.
“It was ages. It was long enough for me to go to the pub and buy these and come back,” Draco argues, sipping his drink. “And when I did, you were still talking to yourself.”
Everyone watches in silence as Timothy takes his arm and nods to Florean, who dispels his anti-Apparation wards without a word. As Timothy prepares for the Side-along, Mr Jennings turns his head and smiles at Harry. He grabs his wand and lunges towards them but it’s too late; in the split second before he and Timothy disappear, Mr Jennings clicks his fingers and all the lights go out.
“I bought new ones,” Deb admits.
“Much better,” he murmurs, smiling when the lizard flicks out a long blue tongue.
“Those were lies. Those innocent members of the public were a reporter and photographer from the Daily Prophet, who walked into Hermione Granger’s garden and starting questioning her daughter. They wanted information about Harry Potter. About his activities. Hermione Granger’s daughter is four years old. When they wouldn’t leave, she drew her wand. She shouted at them. She tried to protect her daughter. The editor of the Daily Prophet has seen a memory that proves her innocence, but they don’t care about her reputation. They don’t care, so someone else is going to have to care for them. I don’t know about any of you, but I am going to be watching them. I’m going to make it my business to watch them, and I’m going to be here every morning, telling you what I’ve seen. And if anyone from the Prophet has a problem with that, I’m at the WWN building, tenth floor, studio two. I’m here from six until twelve noon, Monday to Friday, and I’ve had enough.”
“Maybe it’s pea soup,” Ron says. “Biting pea soup.”
“You are completely welcome here,” Draco says. “This man does not represent us and he certainly doesn’t pay my wages.”
“Over there.” Draco indicates Mr Borteg’s desk with a jerk of his chin.
“Ah!” cries her father, striding across the grass towards them. “Finally, someone else who isn’t just a whippersnapper!”
Harry laughs, sitting on a bench to remove his heavy skates. The sensation of lightness is an odd one, and he rotates his ankles, gazing down at his thick woollen socks.
Surprised, Harry stops eating. “When?”
“Give her to me,” Mrs Purley says, taking the box and smiling down at the mother Kneazle and her kittens. “If we can get the café cleaned up, I can start making hot drinks. All the tea and coffee’s in tins so it might still be alright.”
“I don’t know what you think I’m lying about, Pansy, but you’re very much mistaken,” he says, a little more crossly than he means to.
“What’s happened to you?” she asks, looking so concerned that Stanley cycles his little legs in the air and tacks quietly to comfort her. “I should probably take you to Professor Malfoy, but… here’s a secret between me and you… I’m a bit frightened of him.”
For what seems like a long time, Draco says nothing, and Harry hopes to disappear into the secret compartment full of fruit, never to be seen again.
Illness and injury do not take a holiday, but the bustling foyer of St Mungo’s is resisting that fact as hard as it can. Tinsel decks the walls and the ceiling, while every Floo point has been draped in flashing multicoloured lights, and nurses with glitter in their hair scurry back and forth to the sound of rousing Christmas carols.
Harry knows a challenge when he hears one, and his blood is already racing as Draco casts the charm over both of them.
Harry takes the small cake and admires it. The pure white icing shimmers with the most delicate glitter, and a wafer thin sugar snowflake balances on top. With Molly’s eyes on him, he takes a bite, and of course it’s wonderful. The sponge is light and soft, concealing a well of chocolate sauce that goes perfectly with the buttery mint of the frosting.
“You know,” Draco says thoughtfully. “I don’t think we ever finished going through your list of dating disasters.”
“What about him?” Harry asks, spine prickling at the mention of his godfather’s name.
“Real passengers,” Ida says, eyes wide.
It’s all fine. In fact, it’s more than fine; it’s wonderful. Carefully, he places Stanley on a cushion in his favourite chair, taking a moment to remove all six boots and set them out to dry on the coffee table.
Grinning now, Harry turns to see that all colour has drained from the customer’s face and his smug expression has dissolved into one of horror.
“Er, right. Well, let’s go, it’ll be starting in a few minutes,” he says, mildly surprised when all the biddies get to their feet and file past him to the door.
“That’s a terrible excuse, Draco,” Luna says. “Everyone can dance, and you can’t say you don’t like it if you haven’t even tried.”
He hums to himself as he vanishes the remains of the studio’s coffee and refills the tin with the decaffeinated variety. That, he hopes, will teach the lates to pilfer his secret stash, and if it doesn’t, perhaps the switch to extra-caffeinated in a week or two will finish the job.
Fred shakes his head. “Care of Magical Wigs?”
Harry pushes his plate away and meets her eyes. “It wouldn’t dare.”
“It’s what?” Draco presses, and when Harry looks at him, his eyes are bright with anxiety.
By the time he gets off the bus at the end of Ron and Hermione’s street, he is humming with wellbeing and absolutely ravenous. The afternoon tea he had shared with Draco and the biddies is a distant memory, and there is no way he is going to risk being late for Ron’s shepherd’s pie, even if he is a bit windswept and a bit covered in cat hair.
Harry and Ron exchange amused glances.
Draco arrives at the studio early the next morning. Feeling dull and irritable, he wanders around, tidying up stray bits of parchment and gathering up empty cups. He pauses outside the lates’ studio and notices that Francis, chattering into his omnivox and clutching his coffee mug, is clearly as high as a kite on the high-caf rocket fuel, and he just sighs.
“Well, just in case you weren’t, can you go and start the bus for me? I think I might have cracked it.”
“Okay.”
“There they are, look,” one of them hisses, and the others break out into little whispers.
“Right. That’s how we know it’s someone from the street.”
“Please ignore Harry,” Draco says loftily. “He hasn’t even been in my restaurant. He’s frightened.”
“Who’s back?” the woman asks, clearly curious.
**~*~**
“And what part is that exactly? The ‘I do’ part? The food part? The part where we all sit around and watch the groom stepping on the bride’s foot for three excruciating minutes?”
“I didn’t,” Luna says. “I’ve had this nightie for years. I think you look… lovely, Harry.”
She steps back and allows Stanley to scuttle-bounce into the room before closing the door and sealing in the heat from the huge, roaring fire. Stanley turns in circles on the hearth rug, warming himself and peering around at the strange, wonderful room.
“Be quiet,” he whispers.
Mr Jennings turns red with fury. “Never mind sorry, young man—do something to put an end to this farce!”
She pulls out several sheer scarves in various colours and waves them around herself as though she herself is the Giant Squid. In response, Draco pretends to swim around her. The others are now raiding the prop chest and Luna can hear the record reaching its end, but she can’t look away from Eliza and Draco. The tiny girl is giggling now as Draco drops to his knees with startling grace and reels back from Eliza as though genuinely fearful of her multicoloured flailing tentacles.
“Please explain,” Draco says, drawing up his knees and looking at him expectantly.
“So will we,” adds George, coming to join them with a bedraggled but smiling Mr Borteg.
In reality, there will be nightmares and there may be a shivery little figure attempting to climb into her bed in the early hours of the morning, but she asks for the tranquillity in the hope that something, somewhere, might grant it. She’s never really minded getting up in the night, anyway. Her father taught her early on that adventures do not always wait for daylight, and being friends with Harry over the years has only confirmed that.
Luna frowns, puzzled. “At the home, of course. Otherwise the children won’t be able to laugh at us, and I think that’s sort of the point.”
“So’s George,” Fred laughs. “How else do you think he maintains his dazzlingly slender shape?”
“So I have,” Harry says, looking down at his cup and wondering how he has managed to avoid spilling it all over himself in the process. “I was wondering how you were fixed for Christmas Eve.”
The ladies glance at each other, each nodding slowly before Ida reaches into her handbag and pulls out a small object. As Harry watches, she uncoils a long, flexible pole with a gleaming, brass eye-shaped device attached to the end. The eye blinks at him and he blinks back in surprise.
“Corrie! Your cards are a secret,” Danica reproves, counting out her Knuts with a long finger.
“I see,” Draco says, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t see at all. He has no idea what to do with that information, and he has even less of an idea what to do about the churning sensation in his stomach that has nothing to do with the spicy food.
“Oh,” Harry says, frowning. He wants to say something supportive but all that comes out is, “That’s a really weird problem, Draco.”
“You could use these to keep his feet warm,” the boy says, taking a handful of soft, white things from his pocket.
Sam sighs. “Now that we’ve straightened that one out, can everyone look at this afternoon’s schedule for a moment?”
“It was brilliant. Mum and Dad had some, and Angelina’s parents,” Ron says, grinning. “You two had yours and started having this weird conversation that nobody could understand. You kept pointing at each other and mumbling about glitter.”
“They’re getting desperate,” he says when she finishes the news, handing the folded paper back to her.
“Could you stay with her for a few minutes?” he asks, curling his trembling hands into fists at his side. “There’s something I have to do.”
“He’s coming back… and I think the swan is following him.”
She thanks him and hurries off to arrange her remaining flowers in the square. Harry looks at the chocolate shop and then at Rose.
“Get out of it, ’orrible bug,” the man shouts, grabbing a big broom and waving it at Stanley, who would be all too happy to leave if he would just open the door.
“Yes, Daddy was very ‘tired’ that night,” Ginny says. “I like these window boxes.”
Harry rummages in his pockets and extracts a slightly damp ten pound note. He’s been carrying it with him at all times for longer than he cares to think about, and now it might actually be useful.
“Thank you for that,” he mutters, opting to leave it on. “Pansy, when this show is over, I’m going to have you stuffed and mounted.”
,” Mary Ann puts in. “And I’m game, Luna. The kids’ll love it.”
“That’s it,” Draco says, stopping suddenly in the middle of the pavement.
“Like ‘Harry Potter walks down Diagon Alley with a crocodile?’” Draco asks.
“Just out of interest… why?”
The woman’s face clears. “That’s a good idea. By the way, which of these whiskies do you think would be better for Christmas dinner?”
“Well, we thought we’d share the news in person and we decided to take one side of the street each. She’s got the other side.”
“You know what, Draco? The thing that’s really funny is that they suit you,” Harry says, finally finding the words. “Anyone else would look like an idiot in those things, but not you. What is wrong with you?”
“The boys and girls are alright,” Jean says, to a sigh of relief from everyone, and when Mr Pike returns with Carmella and her kittens, the general mood starts to shift from despair to determination.
“And a large tea, please,” Harry says, intimidated and delighted at the same time. When Mrs Purley nods and turns away, he notices the little glowing glass cone on her counter. “I see you have one of these, too. Quite a saleswoman, isn’t she?”
“Do they just know where to find you?” he asks, peering at the beetle. The beetle peers back, wiggling long, upright antennae and flailing its little legs.
Harry takes a deep breath and threads his fingers through Draco’s. Draco smiles nervously and grips his hand hard enough to hurt. And it’s alright, because they’re making that leap together, and whatever the real world has to throw at them, this time they’re going to be ready for it.
Slowly, Draco releases him and rearranges himself with his head on the pillow next to Harry’s.
Harry opts to ignore the casual objectification and just smile at his friend. “Morning, Shan.”
Harry takes the piece of squared paper and reads the title: ‘Costumers of Uncle Harry’s shop between 3.30pm and 5.30pm Monday to Thursday’. The whole thing is painfully neat and he can almost ignore the fact that Draco has his own column on the graph.
“No, but Mother will be sure to share the news when she next goes to visit him.”
“We’re staying here now?” he interrupts, surprised to find himself feeling hopeful.
Trelawney adjusts her shawls, glittering and rustling at him as her smile turns somewhat smug.
Draco stares at him in disbelief and then pushes him off the rock. He lands on his back, stones and pebbles poking into him and stomach roiling as though he has just missed a step on the stairs.
“I ken,” she says, voice softer now. “Youse are upset. There’s a wee cabin down by the loch. Might that do?”
notice when the laughter starts.
“That is not new information,” Sam sighs, rubbing his eyes.
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry says gravely. “I’m sorry, Corrie, let’s try again.”
“That’s true, Dad,” she says, reluctantly leaving the stream and walking through the long grasses to hand him her empty cup. “Think good thoughts. Accepting and enthusiastic ones if possible.”
“Right.” Potter scrubs at his hair and frowns. “So you just believe everything you read in the papers.”
He’s home and he hasn’t even missed the decorations being put on the tree that is probably still too big for the room.
Miss Lister smiles and straightens up. “All mute swans belong to the Queen, you know.”
“Yes, alright,” Draco snaps. “Eilish, I have not forgotten Ida. She is at her Healer’s today so she’ll be joining us later in the afternoon.”
Harry says goodbye to Daraja and wanders on, past two little boys having their faces painted like gargoyles, past the smiley lady at the sweet stall, and back towards Borteg’s. The shop is packed, and Mr Borteg has no time to comment when Harry breezes in and spends a good half an hour selecting the perfect whisky for Molly and Arthur’s Christmas present. He does, however, apply a heavy discount at the till and treat Harry to a smile that is festive and brilliantly macabre all at once.
It’s fine for Ginny to know about this part of the plan, she reminds herself. It’s not a secret that the children would love a piano, and it needn’t be a secret that she’s planning a pyjama day for the staff to raise for the funds for it. As long as no one knows about the Harry-Draco-embarrassment part of the plan, then everything will be fine and the Happiness Project will be safe.
“Everyone is happy, then?” Florean asks, and the room ripples with approving nods. “Alright, then. Harry and Draco will be our detectives, Mr or Miss MLE will be with us on Friday, thank you for attending, please bring your dishes and spoons to the counter.”
“I can’t hear anything.”
When the last of the plates have been cleared away, the speeches have been made and the cake has been cut, both sets of parents work together to clear the tables and chairs to the edges of the marquee and lay a shimmering, pearly white dance floor. Fleur gets up and plays the harp while the Weasleys, Johnsons and various others mill around, circulating and chatting to everyone without a care. Draco sticks to Harry’s side and continues to look blindsided as people approach and ask questions about the Knight Bus.
“What sort?” he says at last. “The sort that misbehaves.”
Clutching her book tightly, she steps into the stream and wades carefully into the centre, where the gentle current ripples around her ankles and makes lazy swipes at the rolled-up cuffs of her dungarees. She opens the book and gazes down at a photograph of herself and Neville in front of an enormous cactus, glancing up when the sound of wingbeats catches her attention.
“You do think they’d tell us the truth, don’t you?” Harry says. “I know we’re not MLE but they did all seem fine with this at the meeting.”
Harry threads their fingers together and grips tightly. “They get what they deserve in the end.”
“Then it’s settled. This afternoon, we’ll watch Granny getting
“Fantastic,” Ginny says, beaming at him. Louis beams back, and Harry gets it.
“That doesn’t sound very nice,” Luna says, puzzled, but she lets it go.
“Ralph was fun,” she muses, picking up a bag of ice mice and examining it. “He taught me some songs about goblins. Some of them were really rude.”
He gets up from the table and Harry watches him leave, startled when Narcissa speaks to him.
It’s quiet at first, just a soft sort of tittering, but it rises quickly, giving way to giggles and then to deep, helpless belly laughter, the kind that is uncontrollable and runs away with a person, forcing them to close their eyes and clutch at their stomachs, their sides, each other. To Luna’s delight, Harry and Draco are soon laughing so hard that they have to grab onto each other to remain upright. Harry’s fingers are gripping Draco’s shoulder, and Draco leans forward, one hand braced against the notice board and the other fisted into the back of Harry’s t-shirt.
“I thought she’d be angrier,” Draco says, frowning at the letter.
“No,” Draco says, laughing and resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. “I couldn’t help it.”
“Okay. I suppose the biggest question is, how did you end up driving the Knight Bus?”
“That’s good coming from the woman who’s steaming at the ears,” Harry mumbles.
“I can’t see,” Rose complains, eyeing her brother’s position, strapped to his father’s chest.
“Ridiculous as it may sound, this way is probably easier. Plus, I get to have a few minutes away from her. She’s staying until the new year,” he says, and Harry makes a face at the bottles.
“Please,” Mrs Purley says, reaching for two cups. “I’ve never known you forget your manners.”
Harry laughs, exchanging smiles with Mrs Purley, and then jumps when Florean appears behind him.
“I don’t want to hear about it,” Caroline says crossly.
“Don’t you think the teachers should do something?” Ginny says under her breath, apparently hoping not to rile the others, who are still attempting to protect Harry from his terrible decision.
“Motion put forward to add a supplementary storey to Jennings’ Quills,” he reads, and Harry freezes. “Mr Jennings feels that a larger retail area and a new shop front will improve his business. General concern expressed about major structural work, e.g. wards in all the surrounding area would need to be taken down and redesigned. Florean suggests such major concealment work may require a grant from the Ministry. Mr Borteg is concerned that shopkeepers’ pooled funds have already been committed to the winter festival.”
“I wanted you to be able to try our whisky,” he says as Draco peels away the wrappings, smiling at the swan patterned ribbon and then frowning at the bottle.
“Do you have to put your cold hands all over me?” Draco grouses.
“It’ll be over in about a second,” he admits.
“Yes, dear, I had hers and Audrey’s to give out,” Eilish says without looking up.
The whole admission procedure is over so fast that Harry is left feeling dazed, looking around at the others and wondering exactly what has just happened. Draco fetches watery hot drinks for all of them and then sits beside Harry, staring into the middle distance and absently stroking Montague, who has finally been forced to stay behind, much to his displeasure. Harry secretly thinks he should be grateful that he is allowed to stay in the hospital at all, but he keeps the thought to himself. Juno, as far as he knows, is still perching on the luggage rack in an attempt to show the Christmas tree just who is boss.
“That was different. These are my… newspapers,” Draco says, climbing slowly onto the bus and looking as though he wants to gather up every single copy and vanish them completely.
“What’s the matter?”
“It is, it’s really nice,” Harry agrees, and though he’s not lying—the whole thing is hot and soft and fragrant with bursts of fruit and sugar, and the sauce is a revelation—he has no idea how they are going to finish it, and if she continues to stand there, he thinks they are going to have to.
Potter sighs. “Look, Malfoy, until five minutes ago, I doubt we’d said ten words to each other in the last ten years, why the fuck are you interested in me now?”
“Sit down, both of you, before it—” Ginny begins, but falls silent when the bus lurches into motion, seeming to hover in space for a fraction of a second before pelting across the bridge at eye-watering speed.
“Sorry, don’t mind him, he’s just curious. Is there anything I can help... oh. It’s you.”
Harry snorts. He rests his head on Draco’s shoulder. “People are looking, you know.”
“You see,” Danica says, beaming. “The protest carols worked.”
“Of course, he owes a lot of his success to love potions,” she mumbles to herself.
“Fortunately, I have an idea.” Draco gives Needle a stern ‘stay right there’ look and then gestures for Rose and Harry to follow him. “Come on. Bring the spider with you.”
“This is going to be the best ice cream ever,” she enthuses, and Harry can’t help smiling.
“We all went out looking for him, and then I thought I’d better come back in case he… thank you, Ivy. Thank you, Magnus,” he says, and then Stanley isn’t listening because he is being hugged to his best friend’s chest and stroked with a hand that fits the curve of his shell just right.
“Personal reasons,” he mumbles, dipping his quill and grinning. “That’s a new one.”
“Good morning,” Draco says, and something in his tone makes Harry shiver.
“It’s a bigger group today,” Sam says helpfully. “Mr McGann’s off, so there’s no art lesson. I need at least two of you in there. I’m sorry, Draco, but you’re going to have to just… give it a go.”
He takes a deep, shuddering breath, and then another. He opens his eyes.
He gives Draco a determined nod and locks up.
“Flattery will get you… well, it’ll certainly get you a free crackleball or two,” Shan says, and then turns to Draco. “We’re hoping to drag a few people back to yours afterwards… tea, cakes, that sort of thing. Do you think you’ll have a space?”
“Good,” he says, wiping away all the patterns with his hand and gazing out at the snow, now littered with tracks and turned orange by the streetlamps.
There is no need for words, not now, and as they walk back up the street, through the restaurant and up to Draco’s flat, everything that needs to be said is spoken in heated glances and the brushing of fingertips against palms. At the bedroom door, Harry stops and attempts to locate Needle in the dark living room, finding him at last under the windowsill, peacefully dead to the world in a large, blanket-lined basket. Harry follows Draco into the bedroom, this time making sure to close the door behind him.
Harry doesn’t notice it at first. After a long and rather active night down by the lake, he is ravenous, and has no attention for anything besides his bacon and tomatoes. He doesn’t look up when the post owls swoop into the Great Hall, nor when they drop letters and packages and newspapers beside the plates of those around him. He has only just had a letter from Hermione and he hasn’t ordered anything in weeks. Vaguely, he wonders if he should give Draco some kind of gift, and then he hears it. A gasp, and not a quiet one. Then another and another, until the entire cavernous space is echoing with shocked little whispers. Instinctively, he looks across at Draco, who is staring at his copy of the
“No,” Harry says, deciding that she doesn’t need to know about the way his eyes had stung when all the children hugged him.
“What’s wrong with your door?” he demands, watching it close for a moment and then turning to Harry. “I’m looking for a veneficus-aged, single barrel, fifty-year-old Scotch that costs less than thirty Galleons.”
“A Drenglebacked Gloonpuffer is a creature that can eat anything because it doesn’t have any tastebuds,” she explains, biting her lip when Benny accidentally crashes down on her foot instead of the ground. “Maybe we can find a picture of one in the library. Otis, you’re right, it’s not nice to be rude about Mary Ann’s cooking, and—”
“What is this?” he demands, poking at the roll with one finger.
Harry gazes at her, bewildered. “Don’t you feel bad about Marius? I feel bad and none of this madness was my doing.”
“I’m suggesting exactly that. It’ll even be dark for a while… might spare their blushes a bit.”
“You sounded like some kind of mafia don,” Pansy says. “It was quite sexy.”
“I suppose that’s a fair point,” Harry concedes. “What if—?”
“So… we keep going?” Harry asks, blinking as his head starts to spin again.
In the end, he decides to hug her, wrapping his arms around her smile and her curls and her brand new lavender-coloured jumper.
Ron and Hermione will, of course, be working, as will most of his other friends. Of course, if he were to hail the Knight Bus, he could be sitting in an armchair and drinking tea with the biddy club in minutes… but he’s not going to do that. Perhaps Rose’s school will be closed for the day. He could Apparate over and visit her at the Burrow, because… Harry sighs.
“Dad!” she laughs, looking over his outfit, which is exactly the type of one-piece-suit-with-the-feet that Deb seemed to think she’d be wearing. She doubts Deb could have predicted the entire thing being covered in green fur, though. “What are you doing here?”
She heads back to her partner and Harry darts one last glance at Daraja, who is now beaming and matching her customers with their Orishas. Something pulls at the pocket of his jeans and he looks down to see Needle, who has been miraculously quiet throughout the whole incident.
“We are simply acting under the instructions of the farmer, such that they are.”
“Actually, I was hoping Draco and I might be able to borrow the notes from this year’s meetings,” Harry says, voice barely above a whisper. “We think they might be very helpful.”
“She’s here or she’s on the bus,” Draco says, fingers clenching into fists at his side for a moment as though in preparation. He closes his eyes briefly and then takes out his wand.
“Yeah. She wouldn’t leave me alone.”
“And now you’ve met someone,” Hermione says, and he doesn’t know why he’d bothered to hope that she might let that part go.
“Er… not really, no.” Ron sighs. “Listen, I’m not going to push you. If you want to do something weird, it’s your own business.”
Harry smiles at her. “Thank you. So… we looked at a lot of different angles and eventually realised that the person responsible had to be someone from the street. Someone in this room,” he adds, and the ice cream parlour erupts into a cacophony of angry protests.
At that moment, the room seems to fill with Weasleys, and in the middle of them, beaming with pride and still covered in blue face paint, is Rose.
“They aren’t supposed to do it at random,” Harry says, because he has to say something.
There isn’t going to be any dignity today, and he might as well accept it. He watches as the Giant Squid sinks below the surface and out of sight, leaving only a mass of bubbles behind. Stanley burrows against his wet shirt, waving his antennae and issuing contented little noises. Draco cradles him protectively, allowing himself to sag when Harry wraps both of them in his arms and holds on tight.
“The phrase ‘bosom pals’ certainly didn’t enter my head,” Harry says, and then, “Sorry.”
“Shh, now, Mummy’s sleeping,” he whispers, and to his astonishment, Hugo’s cries seem to soften, just a little bit.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Pansy says airily, though she shoots Draco a grateful smile. “So, when was the last time you went on a date, Draco? Or even went out for drinks with someone other than me? And no, your mother doesn’t count.”
At the sound of his name, Needle rises from his crate and shambles across the shop. There is something about his awkward, pitching gait that reminds Harry of Mr Borteg, and he finds himself wondering if he, too, would be more graceful on water than on land.
Harry suspects he is altering the protective magic on the cash drawer, and he can’t say he blames him. He’s heard about all sorts of new security measures from the customers this afternoon, and it’s likely that by tomorrow, Diagon Alley will be armed to the teeth.
“No time like the present,” he mumbles, enthusiasm growing as he thinks about the box of festive things, untouched since last year, sitting on a floor way above him and gathering that cold, musty aroma that, for him, always marks the start of Christmas.
Harry follows, allowing the Leaky to seal itself and its secrets shut behind them. “No, Draco.”
“He was my best friend.”
When, half an hour later, everyone is drifting in a sugary haze and Ida’s chair still remains empty, Harry starts to feel anxious despite assurances from everyone on board that she will be along soon. By the time the teapot has been refilled and emptied, though, the ladies are darting concerned glances at each other and the jigsaw in the centre of the table has barely been touched.
“Why don’t you call me Molly?” she offers, and Harry drags his attention back to Rose.
“As you know, we’ve been asking a lot of questions recently. We’ve also been looking at the scenes and the evidence and trying to fit it all together.” Harry looks at Shan and Esmee, back from their break and glowing with happiness, and he hesitates, heavy with the impact of what he is about to say.
The snow is still very much present on the street, despite the midday sun making its best efforts to shift the lot, and when the Knight Bus careers into view, its wheels kick white powder over everything in sight. Harry, however, has learned, and protects himself with a Shield Charm until the bus comes to rest.
“Brunch is really nice,” Hermione says, too caught up in counting out knives and forks to notice Molly’s expression. “You get all sorts of fruit and bread and meat and sometimes you get a glass of something bubbly at the end.”
“I like geese,” Harry confides, tucking his arm through Draco’s. “But we shouldn’t go to Canada.”
To his surprise, Draco laughs, a real laugh, not a snort or a sardonic bark but a warm, dry sound of real amusement. Harry smiles into his cup and leans back on the bench, letting the warm wine dissolve his tension and watching with interest as Eilish fishes a tin of cakes out of her bag and starts handing them around. As she turns around to offer the tin to Harry and Draco, the badly behaved swan stretches its neck and steals an iced bun.
Ron picks up the offending cup and spirits it away, while Harry examines the wet piece of paper.
Draco’s eyes flit to the chattering old ladies and then back to Harry.
“I’ve heard things about that swan,” he says warily.
He doesn’t want to step onto the bus, open his mouth, and ruin everything, but he knows there is no way of keeping it to himself. Not now.
“You’re leaving? Already?”
“Word travels fast in big families,” Harry tells him as a giant of a man, possibly Angelina’s uncle, finally ambles away after a lengthy discussion. “And there aren’t any secrets. Believe me.”
She has pinned the second earring to the collar of her traditional Chinese dress, the short sleeves of which reveal intricate painted designs on both forearms. Harry looks back at Esmee, who is sporting similar designs on her hands, and then at Natalie and her partner, who are watching raptly from their stall. Harry has never seen Shan in a dress before. She looks tinier than usual, and it takes him a moment to realise that she has abandoned her usual heeled boots in favour of delicate scarlet slippers.
Surprise clear on his face, Draco lets up on the accelerator and the bus slows almost to a standstill. All around them, silvery winter grasses wave against the windows, swishing the glass like the rollers of an enchanted car wash.
“Maybe you can educate me,” Harry says. “Let me come on some of your outings.”
With a mixture of horror and interest, he looks around the dining room. The first thing that hits him is how light the place is, illuminated against the grey sky by a magical glass ceiling, yards and yards of tiny white lights and a mismatched collection of glowing ceramic lamps. The walls, pale and roughly textured, are lined with shelves that contain a forest of plants, with everything from flowering cacti to dangling vines represented. There are no pretentious tablecloths… in fact, there are no tablecloths at all, and every table is different. Some are chunky and wooden, others spindly with legs propped up on books; one in the window is made of wrought iron and has two matching garden chairs, on which a young couple sit, chattering over coffee and cake.
“Is there any sign of the new crackleball?” he asks hopefully.
“No, I think I’ve been fu—erm, flipping cursed or something,” Harry says breathlessly, setting the children off into helpless giggles as he jerks his hips this way and that and then rolls himself sensuously like a belly dancer. “It was you, wasn’t it?” he accuses, pointing at Draco and then making a clumsy sort of leap that almost causes him to crash into the side of the building. “I saw you dancing and now… you’re taking revenge!”
“‘I thought you knew’?” Draco repeats, helping him up and then dragging him into a heated kiss that tastes like tea and chocolate and warm exasperation. “I love you, you absolute tosspot,” he mumbles against Harry’s lips, threading strong fingers into his hair and keeping him close. “I don’t know why... I really don’t know why.”
By the light of a new fire, they spread out on the hearthrug, drinking tea that tastes only a little bit musty and toasting bread on forks until it’s golden and hot enough to melt cheese between two slices. As darkness falls, they curl together in restful warmth and talk of nothing much that matters, just drifting the silence with soft words and insubstantial ideas.
**~*~**
, a result due in the most part to her own skill and vision, but at least a little bit to Luna’s tireless campaign of encouragement, endless cups of tea and eagle-eyed proofreading. She presses her free hand to her bag, almost feeling the hum of positive energy bursting out of her little book. Inside, next to Hermione’s picture, is a copy of that article, each page carefully cut out and pasted in with pride.
He's happy, and that’s all there is to it.
“What are you knitting?” he asks Corrie, who is working on the same stripy project he had seen the day before.
Draco stands on the shore, naked and dripping, and stares at Harry. “Did you get a look at him?”
that no one will want to listen to us!”
“Ah, yes, that,” Draco says, wondering just how that bizarre piece of information has managed to fall out of his head during the last few hours. “And how did that go for you?”
After what seems like a long time, Potter returns to the shop. Some of his fury has diminished, but the look on his face is now one of grim determination, and he is carrying a small, string-handled bag.
Oddly, he doesn’t seem to be doing anything unusual at all. His hair and clothes are unremarkable, and there’s no evidence of any sort of bizarre activity. He is, however, making rapid progress along the cobbles, and when Draco focuses on his face, it is immediately obvious that he is livid.
This just sets them off giggling again, and all he can do is wait. There’s no way they can know anything about the situation with Draco. He’s pretty sure. And yet.
By the time Tuesday morning’s show is over, Draco is practically seething with intrigue. He knows he should just go home. He has never before had a problem filling his time; he visits people and places and learns new and interesting things. He takes care of the Manor and his ducks and attempts to take care of himself. He has plenty to do and none of it requires a visit to the Magical Menagerie, but it’s no good. As soon as Pansy has Apparated home to bed, Draco is making his way along the cobbled street, heart speeding even as he tries to slow his steps.
“Whatever for?”
“You’re naughty,” she says again, remembering Sam’s button, but he tilts his head on one side and regards her with such innocence that she has to laugh.
“Yes?”
“So, he’s just about stopped trying to do a handstand and the bloke says, ‘right, now it’s time for bed’ and Harry starts stripping off, right in the middle of the stage. He tries to stop him, you can tell he didn’t expect him to do that, but Harry just keeps going until he gets to his boxers, at which point the audience start wetting themselves laughing because his boxers have got little blue pixies all over them!”
“She’s… pretty angry, but she’s okay. Her till was full—she always goes to Gringotts to deposit on a Monday morning. They took everything, but she’s not hurt. She wasn’t even there when it happened.”
“Try me,” Ron says, pinning Harry with the look he usually reserves for dangerous criminals.
Harry shifts Hugo to one hip and fills the kettle, setting it to boil and wondering if Hermione has somehow managed to fall asleep.
Harry pretends to zip his lips. Phillippe floats the half-done toast to the counter, where he arranges the ingredients in such a way that the most wonderful smell begins to spiral into the air and Harry’s stomach grumbles loudly. With the toasties assembled, Phillippe returns them to the range, where he sends them turning slowly over the flames with a swish of his wand.
“Harry, that doesn’t help me. Your robes are even older than mine,” Draco points out.
Luna joins them, losing the worries of the last few days in the voices of her friends, the scrape of the violin and the piping of the flute, the warmth from the setting sun and the multicoloured glow of happiness that fills her garden with light.
He wonders if Needle is awake and bothering Draco, following him around the restaurant or pulling at his blankets and hissing him awake. He wonders if Draco is an early riser or if he struggles out of bed at the last possible moment, hair all ruffled and… Harry stops wondering, because he doesn’t want to know. He also doesn’t want to go to Diagon Alley, because it’s Saturday and Mr Borteg has already assured him that he won’t be needed in the shop.
The raw candour of Thora’s words has crept under his skin, scrubbing him sore, and he’s not ready to share any of it. He can’t help wondering what she has written in Draco’s card, but he’s not going to ask. Not yet, anyway. A cool hand rests on the back of his neck and he breathes quietly, closing his eyes for a moment.
Draco laughs and leans against him. “She doesn’t really like anyone. It’s not personal.”
“I must buy you a gift,” Miss Lister blurts, making everyone jump as she dashes for the shelves, scanning for something with such focus that Harry daren’t interrupt to offer help.
you doing now?”
“Oh. Well, never mind. Everyone should be behaving—it’s Christmas,” she says.
“Well, that was inevitable,” George says, and they both turn to see him grinning at them over his paper cup. “Does Mum know? Can I tell her?”
“Yes,” Ida says, nodding furiously. “We’re going to be at the interviews.”
It is a common enough scene, so much so that Sam, behind his desk, is paying no attention to them at all. He looks up briefly when Luna enters the room but quickly returns to his work, because, of course, he cannot see the blaze of scarlet and sea green that flares around the two of them, intensifying at all the points where they almost touch. Neither does he see the shift in those colours as Luna’s spells take hold, but it’s safe to say that he
“Your man’s got standards,” George says with a smirk, and Harry is saved from having to respond by the sudden arrival of Florean, who sprints up to join their group with a roll of parchment in his hand.
“No,” Luna says. “Draco Malfoy.”
“I just realised that we were... that something was happening between us and I wanted it to and maybe you wanted it to and then I sort of forgot all about what you’d said because it was sunny and you were smiling at me and I’d just told the editor of the Daily Prophet to screw himself—”
“This is wonderful,” Hermione says to Draco. “I love soup.”
“Are those my essays?” Draco asks, dislodging Stanley and picking up several inky pieces of parchment. He stares at them, horrified, and then at the floor, and then at Harry.
Pansy clicks off and drops the needle onto a frenetic, bouncy song with an infectious beat. Draco taps his fingers on the desk as he flips through the leftover listeners’ messages. Finding nothing of interest, he wheels over to the Eye in the Sky and looks up and down Diagon Alley. The street is still sleeping, lying peacefully under a blanket of soft, grey clouds. Without really thinking about it, Draco swings the telescope around to point at the Magical Menagerie. The shop is, unsurprisingly, closed, but he lingers, examining the bright exterior paintwork and the shadowy movements of the birds in the rafters, just visible through the tops of the windows.
“I’ve lived in Strath Kinna for seventy-eight years,” she says, staring pointedly at each of them in turn until they pick up the towels and begin to rub obediently at their hair. “I see things. I’ve never seen either of youse before and there’s no good reason to come here unless youse are come to fish. We ken well enough there’s nothing to see here. And youse’ve no come to fish,” she finishes flatly.
He doesn’t let go, and he’s so close that Harry can see the flecks of silver in his eyes.
“I don’t know what to say to that.”
By the time they have been back at Hogwarts for a week, everything is almost back to normal. The Slytherins are no longer excluding Draco, and he no longer cares. The Gryffindors, chastened by McGonagall’s admonishments, have made room for him; Seamus has apologised, and there hasn’t been a single incident of spiders in anyone’s beds. There are those who stare when Draco laughs with Harry or sprawls with him in front of a common room fire, but Harry doesn’t think he has ever given less of a fuck.
When the coffee is ready, she pours out two cups, just to avoid suspicion, and then pulls out the small potion bottle from her bag and adds several drops to the one she intends to give to Harry. First thing in the morning is just about the perfect time for a potion that induces uncontrollable dancing, because the drinker is quite unaffected until he hears music, and there is rarely any of that until lunchtime, when one of the children will turn on the wireless. By then, Harry should have forgotten all about the cup of coffee she made him at nine a.m.
“I don’t know either,” he admits.
“He’d better not be,” Molly says darkly. “He told me that wasn’t going to happen any more—he was going to work the morning and Verity was going to do the afternoon. Her family has
Harry tips some coins into the scoop and sits down in the conductor’s seat.
“Right, well, thanks for that,” Harry mumbles, getting to his feet and heading for the door. Just before he opens it, curiosity snags him. “What is my true path, then?”
He is greeted with enthusiasm by every member of the Weasley family present, hugged by Molly, invited to view the crumble by Arthur before it goes into the oven, and dragged into the living room by Fred to advise on whether or not the incident with the mummified dragon penis should make it into his best man’s speech. Having hugged Molly until she squealed, admired Arthur’s crumble and informed Fred that, in his opinion, the speech would be incomplete
“I didn’t,” he agrees, flushing at the words even before they leave his mouth. “I think I want you inside me when I do.”
“Oh!” Ida cries, grabbing Corrie’s sleeve. She points at the bus. “It’s Christmas!”
Harry stares at her. “No, I wasn’t.”
“Harry, I don’t mean to be rude, but you do know he’s using you, don’t you?” says Demelza, squeezing into the space next to him on the bench and regarding him with anxious dark eyes. “People like him, they don’t really know what friendship is about. He’s just trying to make himself look good. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
Harry smiles. Today, Audrey’s hair is a vibrant mint green, which clashes wonderfully with the pink and purple theme she has chosen for her window box.
,” Rose says, clattering into the kitchen and twirling around, “it doesn’t have any horrible things in it like broccoli… or mushrooms… or stringy beans…”
“No,” Luna says. “But I have friends who are boys. And one friend who’s a crow. Would you like to see a picture of him?”
He is in good spirits as he arrives in Diagon Alley the next morning and he strides up to Borteg’s with Rose at his side. Most of the street has been returned to normal, but the sparkling paths remain, and several of Sophie’s lanterns are still hovering over the tops of the stalls.
“Erm… yes, I suppose I have,” Harry says, attempting to look surprised by this fact.
She hums happily to herself all the way through the morning handover and is amused when she catches several of her colleagues, including Sam, stuck with the tune for the rest of the day. She grins as she pokes the last of the children into their morning classes and wanders around the big old house, swinging her wand at her side and blasting everything in sight with cleaning and brightening charms. She sings as she picks flowers from the gardens and slyly encourages them with a spell until all of the vases are overflowing with colourful blooms, and when the little ones spill out for their morning break, they sing along with her, easily picking up the words of her old Irish folk song and belting it out at the top of their lungs.
“This will be my tenth year,” Draco says, pulling up his knees and wrapping his arms around them.
“Cotton wool balls,” the boy says. “I got them in a Muggle shop.”
“I did,” he says, frowning as he slices into a piece of carrot. “And I’d love to help you, but… Merlin’s beard, Luna, nobody wants to see me in my pyjamas.”
“Why?” Mr Borteg continues. “Because both of these things require a lot of patience… a lot of care… the right ingredients… and perhaps most importantly, everything must happen at exactly the right time.”
By the time darkness closes over the castle grounds, he is wound up too tightly to lie when Neville asks him where he’s going. “I have to... lake,” he manages, and breaks into a jog. He doesn’t know how he knew it would be tonight, but when he reaches the water’s edge, he knows that Draco knows it, too.
“The Inner Eye is free from the fog of emotion, my dear. In its sight, one will always find the truth. Nothing more, nothing less,” Trelawney says, and when Harry looks at her again she is smiling down at him seraphically.
Draco glances at him, eyebrows knitted. “Do you really think they don’t mind giving away five extra tickets?”
“I haven’t forgotten that I work here,” Harry says. “You know, selling spirits, lighting fires, making things look all clean and shiny.”
when Draco yanks at something that opens with a rattle and a clunk.
“And how did it feel about that?” Harry asks, amused.
“I feel… uncertain,” Mr Borteg admits, huge pale eyes meeting Harry’s. “Many things in this life lack certainty, but when it comes to social… occasions…”
“Take a breath, Hermione,” Harry says, but his posture, suddenly rigid and upright, tells Draco that he is just as caught up in this new development as she is.
“Professor Trelawney... what’s this about?” he asks.
“No,” Harry says flatly. “No way. No more sportsmen.”
“The price list is here,” Draco says through gritted teeth, indicating a long metal plaque screwed to the side of his chair. “No one ever buys the toothbrushes.”
“Mrs Cook had better watch out,” Hermione says, tipping the carrots into a pan that looks a lot like the one she uses to make the horrible soup with the weird things floating in it.
“Need a hand?” he offers, and she stands stubbornly firm for a moment before allowing him to take Hugo from her.
“Are you really here?” he asks, in case this is just another, rather nicer, part of his dream.
“Ever practical,” Hermione says admiringly, having appeared in the row behind Harry seemingly from nowhere. “Her sister decided to stick with the heels. Hope she doesn’t get frostbite.”
“Do I look alright?” she whispers to Harry, and he smiles, taking in her dark red dress and festive cardigan, her hair caught up with a velvet clasp and her uncertain little frown.
