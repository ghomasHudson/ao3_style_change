“Get up Nott,” yelled Burke as he stopped by the man’s cell. He made banging noises despite the fact that Albert had already groaned and was making an effort to sit up.
Given they just finished lunch, Harry assumed whoever was walking the halls didn’t have a benign reason for being there. And since he heard foot steps, he knew it was men and not dementors. Harry braced himself for another visit from Burke.
“I don’t understand… manage doing what exactly?” said Harry, his voice almost sounded as gravelly as the dementor’s.
“Right,” Wiblin nodded and once again stepped closer to Harry. Harry immediately repeated his harsh “don’t”, which fortunately made Wiblin pause.
Once Hale was done taking pictures, he called in a guard to heal Albert. Harry once again removed each illusion one at a time. Harry relied on where the guard pointed his wand, as he could not feel what areas the magic was attempting to heal.
The last significant question they asked was whether or not Harry believed Albert could be rehabilitated. Harry was quick to say yes, and reinforced how kind Albert had been to him.
This time when Draco leaned in for a kiss, Harry did not pull away. Being able to kiss Draco was even better than he imagined, even if he was wracked with nerves. He was excited, oh so excited, to be so close to him. But part of him was terrified. He hadn’t been this close to anyone in a long time. To be honest, he hadn’t had all that much opportunity to be close to even Ginny. It was new territory and he was eager to explore it. He knew how it could all go horribly wrong, but he wasn’t going to pull away again. This time when Draco’s hand teased the hem of his shirt, he pressed forward.
“He – I...” Harry glanced down as he did not want to look at anyone while he shared the story. “When I was younger, my cousin... got his friends to chase me. I knew I couldn't let them catch me. They’d – I couldn’t let them catch me, so I accidentally apparated to the roof of my school. I didn't know how to get down. Someone living near the school called the police – er, they’re muggle aurors – and a fireman came to get me down. The teachers were upset, kept asking me how I got to the roof, and I didn't know what to say. When my aunt and uncle came to get me, they... were... upset.”
“There have been instances where memories are collected for the courts, but that’s usually once the person has been released and is trying to sue. But even then, it’s not necessarily the best course of action. The memory is thoroughly examined to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with. There is always the chance that the court may request seeing additional memories if the guards try to claim there was provocation. This leaves the accuser vulnerable to an invasion of privacy and sometimes additional charges for infractions revealed in the memories. You’d have to be
Harry and Theo sat on the floor, close to the classroom door. As Theo scanned Harry’s notes, the others crowded around to get a look as well.
Harry wanted to be alone. He knew his friends would have questions, and he wasn’t ready to relive the embarrassment of revealing too much. He was tempted to ignore Theo as well, but he knew Theo would be concerned about his father’s trial. So, Harry headed to the unused classroom the two had planned to meet in to work on the mirror. Theo joined him almost immediately after classes ended.
For several long moments, Harry’s laboured breathing mingled with the rattling noises they were making. Moans were issued from the other cells, but they faded to the background as Harry focused on his three visitors.
Albert drew the warding symbols with a piece of chalk that Harry had conjured for him. He had Crabbe and Harry repeat the symbols on their own wall. Lucius used Harry’s drawing to create his own. Likewise, Lestrange used Lucius’ and so on. With Albert’s guidance, Harry was able to activate the wards in Lucius’, Albert’s and his own cells. The latter he thought was unnecessary as he felt rather hot, but Albert pointed out that Harry didn’t know if his power-up was permanent.
Harry laughed at Malfoy’s recounting of his own glory days playing quidditch. It seemed he pulled as many dirty tricks as his son. Even if Draco wasn’t playing quidditch at the moment, it gave Harry some ideas of what to look out for. Assuming Harry ever got out of Azkaban.
As much as Harry wanted to keep talking to them, he saw Lucius and Albert shift uncomfortably. By the way the mirror kept sliding downwards, Harry assumed Lucius’ arm was getting tired of holding the mirror up as well.
"No," said the second Lestrange brother. "I had one as a kid. Took him everywhere. It’s the form my patronus takes too... though I haven't tried that charm in years. Might not be the same now."
“I don’t know how humans consume one another or the repercussions,” said Ishanders, which caused Harry to flinch. He hated the way Ishanders phrased that as it sounded uncomfortably close to cannibalism. The idea of cannibalism made Harry queasy, though he didn’t know if it was better or worse to eat someone’s soul. Probably worse.
“It’s not that,” responded Harry. The last time the prisoners were allowed a shower, it was because Albert was seeing his judicial-wizard. The guards wanted to make sure he looked presentable to give the impression they were doing a good job. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if today’s shower meant good news for him. “Do you think all this means that Hale finally managed to set up a meeting with me?” he asked.
“Er, Malfoy, hi,” Harry said as he closed the distance between them. He tried to stop his out-of-breath panting so that it wasn’t so obvious he had run after them. “Can I talk to you for a moment? In private?”
Even James seemed to be encouraging it. He’d interrupted Harry and Draco’s conversation with a happy “Da!” They’d both turned towards the child, and noticed his arms raised towards Draco, not Harry. Draco had turned worried eyes on Harry.
“You’re allowed to grieve,” Hermione was quick to reassure him. “No one holds last night against you. Everyone was a little depressed.”
“Ah! But it speaks to Potter’s character and his previous delinquent behaviour,” stated Runecraft. Harry bristled at that. How could saving himself and his cousin count as delinquent behaviour? It was Umbridge all over again. Harry wondered if she is the one responsible for sending the ministry after him now.
“He’s been acquitted,” Hale volleyed back, “the compensation he is due is from Azkaban and the ministry’s gross mistreatment.”
“You’re the only perv here,” Harry threw back good-naturedly. As tempting as the opportunity might be, Harry wouldn’t violate someone privacy like that.
“Alright, we’re both awesome then,” Theo bragged. Harry smiled and ignored the disbelieving snort Parkinson made in response.
“Then you and I will regroup and strategize a new course of action,” it helped that Hale didn’t seem all that phased by the idea of his initial plan not working as they hoped. “And even with a trial date, we can still work to win over the public.”
“So, what did I miss?” Harry asked. He knew they wanted to ask him about Azkaban and the trial, but Harry wanted to put off that discussion as much as possible.
Harry laid still, stared at the ceiling, and desperately tried to think about anything but recent events. When he was reasonably sure that Albert and Lucius were asleep, he quietly got out of bed and sat in the middle of his cell. Silently he levitated a nearby pebble. Likely it was a chipped piece of Azkaban’s crumbling walls.
“We’re flooing from here,” Hale informed him before Harry could spiral too far into his sudden fear that the aurors took him here for an assassination attempt. Auror Perkins flooed first, followed by Harry, then Hale, and lastly Bradley. Harry was rather surprised to land in the main atrium and guided to check-in at the visitor’s station. He felt eyes on him as Bradley manhandled him. It made him extremely tense until one witch yelled “free Potter!” and several other voices joined in with a supportive cheer. By the time it took them to get processed, several bystanders had transfigured and charmed handheld posters. Harry read ones that said ‘Free Potter’ and ‘Down with M.O.M, we don’t trust them!’. The crowd had also started chanting “Hey, hey, auror! Unhand Potter!”. It helped Harry steel his resolve.
“Can you fix it?” whispered Harry as he hugged his knees. There was a telling silence for an achingly long minute, before Lestrange admitted, “I don’t think so.”
“She wasn’t exactly sorry either!” Harry retorted, glad that his anger was pushing down his despair. “She ran out of the ministry bloody
It helped that one journalist managed to corner Neville and Luna while they were shopping in Diagon Alley. Luna had been quoted saying Draco had been kind to her during her captivity. Neville hadn't spoken about Draco specifically, but had made a general statement about healing and rising above hatred and anger. It was enough to infer he supported Harry. With Harry and Neville as a united front in the media, some of the initial negative press about the Malfoys tapered off.
The carriage ride was tense and silent. Perkins occasionally glanced at Harry but didn’t offer any more support or encouragement. The other auror’s wand didn’t waver from where it was aimed. Even when the carriage finally did stop, Perkins had to prompt the other auror before he lowered his wand to allow them to exit smoothly.
Monday had been a grueling day. He’d had to put aside his eagerness about the mirrors and pretend he had the same amount of interest in every single one of his classes. As much as he was able, he tried to portray myself as a well-adjusted and dedicated student. This meant he couldn’t be caught studying content unrelated to the class, even once he completed the classwork. It wasn’t worth risking his professor’s attention and then being saddled with a mind healer.
“I don’t think our ages mattered,” Harry said. It was obvious Hale was setting up Bellatrix to be the villain. Harry didn’t have a problem supporting that considering his history with the woman, though he hoped Rodolphus would forgive him. He told Hale the spells he remembered her casting at him and his friends. He briefly and painfully recounted what happened when she killed Sirius, and how happy she’d been.
“It’s perfect,” Harry said again, because it was exactly what Harry would have requested if he’d been awake at the time. Despite his reassurance to Ron, Harry was a little hesitant. It was the second time they told him Ginny had chosen something because she thought Harry would have wanted it. He hoped she’d wanted those things too.
Even though it left Harry almost alone, he still couldn’t focus completely on the mirror because Hermione was there. He studied transfiguration and charm theory, which he though he could apply to the mirrors. He even looked into some potions, but he wouldn’t be able to tie them together in any meaningful way until he understood blood magic better.
"Is your animagus form a sugar glider?" Harry asked. He had trouble picturing one of the most notorious death eaters as a cute and cuddly sugar glider.
Hale asked about the other guards’ actions once they discovered what happened. Harry briefly contemplated offering that memory to Hale. When he recalled that he was naked from the waist down for part of it, Harry decided against it. He didn’t want anyone in the ministry to see him like that.
“Watch it,” Harry warned. He could not pretend to be unaffected if the man tried to sully the name of his parents. Unfortunately, Burke caught on to this.
“I’m honored to call James my grandson,” Lucius informed him, which surprised Harry until he added, “Draco has done an admirable job raising him with the manners expected of a child from our family.” Harry didn’t bother disputing Lucius’ claim that Draco was solely responsible for the proper upbringing of their child. Harry reinforced the please and thankyous, but Draco was the one that insisted on proper table manners and how they should behave in public. He suspected those were the manners Lucius cared about. Even Harry got the occasional ‘stand up straight, dear.’
Over time, Lucius and Harry’s interaction became easy. Not enough for Harry to feel like Lucius approved of him, but enough that he no longer dreaded having to spend time with the man. Draco had been exceedingly amused when they started attending quidditch matches together. The first time it happened was because Draco felt ill and suggested his father take his place at the match. Harry would have preferred to ask Ron, but Draco had made the suggestion in front of his parents. Narcissa had jumped on to the idea, and both men were left awkwardly agreeing. Apparently rooting for the same team, insulting the moves of the opposing team, and fanboying over well-executed maneuvers was enough to make the experience enjoyable. Enough that it kept happening, and Harry even found himself fire-calling Lucius to discuss the overseas matches they didn’t attend in person. It wasn’t the sort of friendship people wrote poetry about, but it was a vast improvement from where they’d started.
“No problem.  Your dad wanted to write to you for ages,” Harry said. He briefly thought about reciting the message Crabbe had initially hoped Harry would deliver, but he knew the man had put it in one of the letters already. Since Nott seemed annoyed at the possibility that Harry had snooped through their mail, he didn’t want to bring up that suspicion again.
The man stood up as the guards brought Harry in. He waited until Harry’s hands were unspelled before he moved forward and offered his hand. “Reginald Hale,” the man introduced himself.
“I don’t think I appreciated how hard it was for you. The media alone...” Neville trailed off. Harry could sympathize. Being the one who vanquished Voldemort, Neville suddenly gained a lot of attention, from both the media and admirers. For someone as shy as Neville, it was a lot of change, most of which was very much unwanted.
Harry wasn’t sure how much he should share. He didn’t want to lie, but the truth wouldn’t comfort Draco. Plus, he didn’t know how much Lucius would want him to say. Lucius had always been Draco’s hero. Harry didn’t want to tarnish that by inadvertently giving the impression that the hardships of prison made Lucius weak. If anything, it was the opposite, but it was hard to explain the man’s strength without acknowledging what he was surviving through.
“The twins started a new line of products in your honor,” Neville added. He hurried to his own trunk and pulled out an item. “This is part of their
His friends didn’t look convinced, but at least they didn’t look at him like he’d been permanently brain damaged by his stay in Azkaban.
“You’re welcome,” Harry said with a smile even though Lucius couldn’t see it. Then he quietly let himself out so the two could have a private reunion.
. It’s terrible, Draco. So, so bad,” Harry said. Draco was quiet for a few minutes as he contemplated it. Since their friendship started, Draco had known there was something weighing on Harry. Something beyond Ginny dying in childbirth. He figured the other man had hurt, or possibly killed someone during the war and was prepared to talk him out of the self-hatred Harry had developed as a consequence. But he started to suspect it might be more complicated than that. He took Harry’s drunken words seriously and debated if it was possible for Harry’s secret to truly drive him away.
“Yes, that incident has been examined already. It should have been struck from his record,” Dumbledore cut in and gave Harry a warning look. Harry knew he should remain quiet and let Dumbledore take care of this. It really was too bad Harry was never good at keeping his anger in check.
Both Lucius and Crabbe shared stories about the summer hijinks their sons got up to. As Harry tried to fall asleep that night, he kept wondering if he would have been part of the story had he accepted Draco’s friendship in their first year at Hogwarts. Harry didn’t regret sticking up for Ron, but he still spent the night playing the “what if” game. It kept him up longer than it should have.
“Consume- I’m not- it’s not food to me,” Harry stressed. He thought back to how little he had eaten since kissing Burke. “I mean, I
“Don’t pretend Azkaban cares about protocol or prisoners’ rights now,” Albert sneered. The guard looked as if he would insist, so Albert added, “I’d much rather keep the kid here, than risk him being alone with you lot. Didn’t turn out so well last time.”
“Er, Hale is his dad’s judicial-wizard too,” Harry said. The statement wasn’t a lie, though Harry knew they wouldn’t appreciate an intentional misdirection either. Harry wanted them to assume Hale had told Nott while he was visiting the school. He was certain Nott caught on, as he let the statement stand with a minor smirk he quickly repressed.
“I-” Harry shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t want to talk about Azkaban. Ever. Unfortunately, he didn’t know how else to get them to understand his new perspective on the other prisoners. “It’s a pretty miserable place. It’s cold, and the guards... well, they’re mostly shit if I’m being honest. Maybe some of them are alright, but not the ones working in the major crimes section of the prison. There’s just so much time to think about how everything went wrong. The dementors’ presence just encourages those thoughts,” Harry said. He might have stopped feeling the dementors’ effects himself, but that wasn’t the case for the other prisoners. He’d felt guilty and frustrated that he couldn’t do anything to help them. The time he’d heard Crabbe sobbing in his cell, trying to be quiet, had been heartbreaking. Doubly so because he had started to look forward to Asherath and Ishanders’ visits, hoping he’d get answers (and then wishing he never had). If he said the dementors ‘weren’t that bad’, his friends would think he was certifiably insane.
They had to wait a few more minutes before Draco exited the classroom. Everyone turned to watch him. Harry could immediately tell Draco had been crying. All tear tracks had been removed, but Draco’s eyes were a telltale red.
What surprised him even more, though it probably shouldn’t by this point, was their continued support even after all that they saw. After witnessing Harry purposely touch Quirrell knowing it would burn the man, Albert merely told him to never be ashamed of fighting for his life. Lucius even apologized after witnessing himself through the eyes of a scared twelve-year-old.
“How do you know about that?” asked Ron suspiciously. Harry’s eyes widened as it could only have been through Albert’s letter. Harry still hadn’t told Ron and Hermione about the letters since he would have to explain
“Who is?” Harry asked, just to be sure. Not that there were many possibilities of who they could be talking about. Harry didn’t have a large circle of friends and acquaintances.
“Shine?” Harry parroted. It should be a relief to hear he wasn’t carrying Burke’s spawn. And yet, his apprehension only seemed to grow the longer the conversation went on.
“Come see me after today’s classes. We’ll review the rest and decide on a plan for how you’ll catch up with the missed assignments,” McGonagall said. Harry wasn’t thrilled imagining the amount of assignments he’d likely have by the end of the day from all of his professors.
Harry refused to say anything to both men as Burke continued to pat the tattoo for longer than a minute. In fact, as the pain receded completely, Harry became aware that Burke was no longer patting the area so much as caressing it. As his hand passed from one side to the other, he let his pinky drag along Harry’s collarbone. Harry’s unease grew at this new attention. He didn’t forget Burke’s extra attention during his pat down.
“I’m not going to beat around the bush,” Draco warned once his house elf served Harry breakfast. “I meant what I said last night. I will help you figure out what happened to your horcrux.”
Harry and McGonagall stayed a little longer at the trial as they initially planned to leave when the court adjourned just in case Harry was called back. Harry assumed they would once they got their bearings back, but they never did. The rest of the testimonies went quickly and were more subdued than those that occurred before Harry’s. Consequently, Hale was able to lead the questioning to best support his case. Harry was surprised to learn Hale was not only trying to say Albert had been an unwilling participant the night he was arrested, but that he was also an unwilling Death Eater. Hale claimed Albert was forced into it initially and been trapped ever since. He was rather convincing. Enough that Harry might have believed it himself if he didn't know Albert supported most of the Death Eaters’ goals. By the time he and McGonagall left the ministry, Harry started to believe Albert had a chance. He just hoped Voldemort wouldn't be feeling murderous at anyone publicly denying the glory of being his bootlicker.
“Is it?” countered Harry somewhat hysterically. While he didn’t want his worst memories replaying on repeat, it didn’t seem like a good thing to have the dementors’ curiosity focused on him either.
For Harry's prison number, I did extensive research (i.e. did a quick google search and based it on the first few results and didn't verify their accuracy):
“Well,” Lestrange dragged out the word as he groped for a way to justify his wife’s actions. “Black was a blood traitor-”
Throughout the night, Harry added more and more stones. Eventually there weren’t any left in his cell, so he summoned a few from the hallway and Lucius and Albert’s cells. No matter how many he added, they all moved as effortlessly as the first one had. When the early morning light woke Lucius, he sat up to the sight of a veritable wall of rocks orbiting the boy.
“Yeah, but I meant... I think James is the other half of my soul. Like, he’s my soul reincarnated,” Harry suggested.
It warmed Harry’s heart to hear how much effort Hermione had put into helping him. He was also glad that Hale took Hermione seriously and didn’t interpret her actions as an insult to his ability to do his job. It was this more than anything else that made Harry sure he has picked the right man to represent him.
“Get off me you bast-” Burke interrupted Harry’s outburst by leaning down and forcing another kiss. Since Harry’s mouth had been open mid-insult, Burke took the opportunity to slip his tongue in. Harry’s brain short circuited and looped ohmygod-ohmygod-ohmygod as Burke seemed intent on shoving his tongue as far as it could go. He only broke out of his panic when Burke tugged on Harry’s hair to adjust the angle of their kiss. Still frighten but no longer frozen, Harry bit down on the invading tongue. Burke jerked back.
“So, what’s the problem?” asked Neville. “We thought perhaps you didn’t know how to tell us, but I’m beginning to suspect you’re not actually with Draco.”
The prisoners all ate their breakfast quickly after Harry spelled the food to taste better. Even Harry ate his full share. He hadn’t felt hungry, but he must have used enough of Burke’s soul on his gifts that the thought of food didn’t make him feel nauseated. Harry resolved not to feel guilty about that.
“No, I’m fine,” Harry said. He suspected Dumbledore knew it was a lie, but he didn’t press. There wasn’t anything Pomphrey could help with anyway.
“You sure you want me here?” asked Harry with a slight slurring to his words. “I might sick up on your extrouv-extav-ext-nice stuff.”
“What’s interesting?” ventured Harry. He figured as terrible as the notion was, he already had their attention. He reckoned he had nothing to lose by trying to get them to answer his questions.
“These prisoners have shown me more kindness in the few weeks I’ve been here than the ministry has shown me since I started Hogwarts,” Harry concluded. He suspected that quote would make it into the newspapers.
Harry picked up the first book he wanted, but had trouble finding the second. He moved to see if it was in the next isle over, but froze when he spotted the sixth year Slytherin boys all working at a table. It was rare to see them all together, but Harry assumed they must have followed him like a good chunk of the school. He took a moment to observe them, before it dawned on him that it was a good moment to deliver the letters. He hesitated over Zabini’s presence as his father - nor several step-fathers - wasn’t a known Death Eater as far as Harry knew. Harry hoped that Draco and the others would be able to ensure Zabini kept the matter to himself.
“Do you really want the added criticism right now? You know my judicial-wizard will push back hard against any attempts to deny his visitations,” Nott cautioned. “And I doubt the minister will be too happy if Potter is unavailable the next time he visits due to made-up offenses.”
“No,” Lucius said for Harry. “As incredible as it sounds, Harry kissed Burke the way a dementor would.”
“Perhaps,” Draco nodded. “If souls develop as we age like any other body part, then yours might have had to grow around the foreign substance. Even with it now gone, your soul stayed...”
“He’d want to decide for himself what happens to the boy,” Lucius disagreed. “He’d see your actions as disrespectful and presumptuous.”
If Snape and McGonagall weren’t bad enough, the other students regained interest in him after Lance’s first article was published in Monday’s paper. That first article was a short piece that let the public know Harry had become a young activist who was hoping to improve Azkaban and the overall policies surrounding wizard incarceration. Harry had expected this, as Lance informed him he would conduct some research and interview others before he started publishing more in-depth articles. Unfortunately, it seemed that once Harry was willing to open up to a reporter, the other students felt intitled to ask their own questions. Neither Ron nor Hermione were surprised when Harry announced his intention to spend another night in the library, despite having managed to catch up with coursework.
Harry trailed off. He knew if he said too much, he might start crying. He thought he had put Sirius’ death behind him, at least enough that he wouldn’t cry over it, but there was something about being in Azkaban that was tearing down his defenses.
“I don’t know. I didn’t mean to. I think it just... she was wearing the ring when we, er, made James. It must have... moved somehow,” Harry said.
“You stopped him?” Crabbe’s confused voice prevented Harry from wondering how he felt physically fine. Harry didn’t know what to say. The last thing he wanted was for these men to fear him or be disgusted by what he did.
It was awkward at first. Draco and Harry had too much history to just pretend nothing happened. Draco was snotty and prideful just to get on Harry’s nerves, but he slipped too often and Harry saw the fragility Voldemort and Azkaban had caused in him. Over time, Harry got to know who Draco was as a person. They found they had more in common than a love of quidditch. After the first few weeks they reconnected, they mostly bonded over the sense of guilt they carried. Draco did not understand what Harry had to feel guilty of, having never been involved in the Death Eaters like Draco had. Harry vaguely implied there was more to it than Draco knew, but was reluctant to elaborate. Draco didn’t push, instead he let Harry share whatever he was comfortable sharing. Consequently, Harry eventually found it easier to confide in Draco than it was with Ron and Hermione. He wasn't sure if he would ever regain the closeness he’d had with his two best friends when he couldn't ever admit the truth.
“Know what?” Harry asked faintly. He grew apprehensive about whatever it was the two were alluding to.
the guards were gone. He felt like he should relax, but couldn’t because the feeling of Burke’s soul was still present. Without the distraction, that too-much feeling returned.
,” Harry said before painful sobs wracked his body. He let Mrs. Weasley gather him in her arms, and felt worse because she should hate him, but Harry let her comfort him instead. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry...”
“I couldn’t stomach the idea of patting the ministry on the back for doing nothing. I’d hoped it would be different once they acknowledged Voldemort’s return, but they still want to pretend everything is fine without
“Ok... ok, but don’t get mad. I was doing some research, and, well Harry, mind healers can help you after what you’ve been through. It’s not a weakness to see one. Oh Harry, after everything-” Hermione pleaded earnestly.
“I have no proof,” Harry stated cautiously aware that none of his friends had believed him, “but I think Malfoy – er, Draco – I think that Draco was given some sort of task from Voldemort.”
“Sorry, that’s weird,” Harry said before he reluctantly pulled away from the hug. “It’s just... Azkaban just has this mild moldy smell...”
Plus is wasn’t an altruistic offer on the part of the others. They too needed distractions to keep their own negative memories away. As Harry stared at Malfoy’s earnest expression, he wondered how he had spent his days prior to Harry’s arrival. Harry speculated whether his cell had been empty the whole time. If so, that pretty much just left Lestrange as the only person Malfoy could see. He could talk to the men on either side of him, and possibly even a few cells down if the spoke loud enough. But after months of being locked up, not allowed any visitors beside the guards or their judicial-wizards, their conversations must have grown stale. Harry’s presence shook things up and gave them something new and challenging to occupy their time with.
“Dammit, Harry,” Draco swore, but he sounded more tired than upset. “Let me observe you for a couple of weeks. I can run a few tests, maybe find some more... evidence for you.”
Again, Harry was quiet. He could see Burke getting frustrated and hoped that the man would grow tired and just leave.
“A young man,” Malfoy conceded. “My point is that your youth will work in your favor. Throwing someone who hasn’t even finished their education into Azkaban without a trial will backfire on the ministry.”
He mentally reviewed what he wanted to say as he walked towards the meeting place. He felt confident up until he spotted Hale and another man waiting for him. The second man was a black man roughly around Hale’s age. He was dressed in practical dark grey robes. He held himself in a confident manner without giving off the impression of someone pretentious. He made an interesting contrast standing next to Hale, who even on a casual Saturday managed to embody the wealth and prestige his job afforded him.
“What do you want?” asked Ron rudely. Harry turned to the boy next to him with surprise. He too wondered why Nott was sitting with them, though Harry wasn’t as affronted by this as Ron.
Harry was able to demonstrate enough mastery of the current lesson, so McGonagall suggested he take the rest of the class to practice the spells he’d missed and call her over if he needed aid. She kept an eye on him as she circulated the classroom, helping those that were struggling. Towards the end of the lesson, she returned to Harry’s side and asked him to demonstrate the spells he’d been working on. Harry only had enough time to explain and carefully cast two spells before the class period was over. McGonagall was pleased to see Harry had no difficulty with those spells, but wouldn’t be satisfied until Harry demonstrated them all.
“They won’t let it go any time soon,” Draco warned. He said it in such a matter-of-fact tone that Harry didn’t take offense. He mostly just felt worried about the lingering stares, questions, and comments that he would have to continue to deal with indefinitely. Harry wondered how much Draco had dealt with after Lucius was arrested.
game. Only the premise was about sending a niffler into your neighbour’s yard to look for buried treasure. Harry wasn’t sure how they kept track of where their treasure was or where they searched. Unless the bar of soap left enough residue on the wall, they must be keeping track all in their heads. Or they found a way to smuggle in stuff.
“I’m sure he’ll go through that bottle before your transfiguration resets,” Albert snorted. Despite agreeing with Albert, Lucius was not one to squander the learning opportunity. He gave a quick overview of 3 common methods wizards used. Lucius suggested Harry perform the easiest one on the bottle given it was unlikely to be traced back to him. It was also the easiest of the spells to undo, but for the purpose of creating a bottle of lube, Lucius suggested it was sufficient.
“The... his cousin was killed by a muggle. He wasn’t... too fond of him,” Harry decided to state. It was something Albert had told him about near the beginning of his imprisonment, when Harry defended muggles as a whole group. All of the Death Eaters had similar stories, and Harry found it hard to defend those muggles. He knew there was a long history of muggles hunting and killing witches and wizard, and that carried pain and anger from one generation to the next. But he’d seen the other side of it too and wizards hurting muggles or portraying muggleborns as less valued or deserving of their magical gifts was not a good response to that. Harry still didn’t believe all muggles were bad; they shouldn’t suffer if wizards sought their revenge for deeds done by someone else. But he’d be lying if he tried to claim that their arguments hadn’t worked on some level. He hoped the wizengamot felt the same.
Draco watched him with a strange look on his face. He opened his mouth to say something but quickly snapped it shut again. He watched Harry fidget.
The now familiar sound of the door opening at the end of the hall eventually broke the near silence of the prison. Hurried footsteps of two men quickly made their way to Wiblin.
“I have a suggestion for our heating problem,” offered Albert. “We can do a low-powered ward in each cell. If confined to the dimensions of the cell, the guards won’t notice when they pass by.”
Draco pressed one chase kiss to Harry’s lips before he returned to his earlier position laying with his head against Harry’s chest. He made a point to grab Harry’s ring hand and hold it tightly.
“Good choice,” Draco said. It only held a fraction of his usual Malfoy haughtiness, but Harry was charmed by the smirk all the same.
“Right. It’s kind of a long story,” Harry said and he debated how to even start explaining. “And I’m sure he’s getting impatient by now...”
Tuesday was a better day for him. Another one of Lance’s articles was published, but Harry was merely quoted in it along with various others. That one was focused on the need for a medi-witch or wizard to be assigned to Azkaban on a permanent, daily basis. Lance provided statistics on the deaths that had occurred in Azkaban over the past decade. One of the people he’d interviewed implied that some of those deaths could have been avoided with proper medical care. There were no statistics on the injuries that occurred in Azkaban, but Lance used Harry’s quote about prisoner’s injuries being left untreated. Lance stressed the need for the guards to get some basic medical training (though Harry knew that wasn’t the full reason as to why they didn’t tend to prisoners’ wounds). The article ended with a comparison to three other wizarding prisons that had an on-site medi-witch. While their injury and death rates were still too high, they were better than Azkaban’s.
“What I should have done the moment you arrived,” Burke hissed back. “If I had put you in your place right away, you wouldn’t have caused so much trouble for me,” as Burke spoke, he leaned more and more into Harry’s space. His hold on Harry’s hair was unforgiving and he strained Harry’s neck in an uncomfortable way.
It had been hard to let her go. He’d felt cold and miserable but didn’t know if that was a side effect of being separated from his horcrux, or just the bleak reality of the war.
“It’s my fault she died,” Harry said apropos of nothing, several weeks into their newfound friendship. He had no intention of telling her about the horcrux, but it was the most honest and upfront he’d been about Ginny since his initial reaction to the news of her death. He could sense she was about to offer some platitudes, so he cut her off before she could. If she repeated what the Weasleys had been telling him, he’d lose his nerve. “I know everyone says it’s not, but it feels like my fault. I’ll never get rid of that feeling.”
“But it’s not to late to salvage this. Many people still believe in the chosen one,” Scrimgeour gave Harry an intense look. Harry merely raised an eyebrow but kept quiet. It was easier to ignore the man when they had been in the Weasley’s garden and there was a convenient gnome putzing about. The most exciting thing in Harry’s cell was the diminishing bar of soap that Harry really hoped they would replace soon.
“It has been at least seven months,” Lucius responded. “The dark lord expects results. What if it’s already-” Lucius didn’t finish his sentence, but took a steadying breath. He started to pace along his cell. “There must be something I could do, even from here.”
“Not, er, not like he attacked me. He didn’t try to...” Harry trailed off uncomfortably. He couldn’t bring himself to say it. Hale was smart enough not to press yet.
“Potter,” was hissed at him. The voice confirmed it was Burke. He quickly strode over to the groggy boy and pushed him back onto the mattress when Harry started to sit up.
Harry tried to go as quickly as possible. He was glad that it wasn’t particularly loud, and it didn’t clog the toilet. The situation was embarrassing enough as it was. Harry waited for one of the other prisoners to comment, but no one did.
Sorry for making you wait so long for this chapter. I haven’t abandoned this story, but I can’t make any promises about when I’ll update it. I wanted to thank everyone who has been leaving encouragement. To make up for the delay, this chapter is longer and features naked Harry... though sadly there isn’t a matching naked Draco (is Lucius close enough?).
“Well, it’s not like he can condone Potter torturing his wife,” a new voice cut in. Harry was pretty sure it was the other Lestrange brother. “Considering she’s your sister-in-law, you probably shouldn’t be encouraging the boy either.”
Harry debated revealing what he discovered about horcruxes, and ask Dumbledore if he knew that Harry was one. Anger briefly surfaced at the thought but it faded quickly and was replaced with fear and sadness. He knew they should talk about it, but Harry wasn’t up for facing it today on top of everything else.
There was more shaky movement in the mirror. By the time the view settled again, Harry was able to see part of Lucius and part of Albert in the mirror. It was obvious they were both awkwardly squished against the wall separating their cells so that both men could see the mirror at once.
“Even if I don’t use the memory as evidence, it will still help me,” Hale said, getting back to Harry’s offer. “At the very least, I’d know what to ask or avoid, and get a sense of what the ministry might try to drag up against my clients,” Hale said.
“Where are we?” Harry asked. He wondered if the aurors had taken him to the middle of nowhere to dispose of him. It suddenly occurred to him that he was alone with them and at their mercy. They could tell the world that Harry fought them, maybe even that he escaped so they would have time to hide his body.
Rabastan Lestrange would be gifted a pair of x-ray/telescope glasses. Initially Harry had intended for only let the immediate outside world be visible, but when he tested the glasses himself, he quickly realized how boring the area surrounding Azkaban was. The constant fog made it difficult to see very far, so Harry adjusted the glasses to see distances. It was so successful that the glasses allowed one to see the stars and beyond. Harry hoped that a man that had spent way too many years locked away would appreciate an occasional glimpse of the outside world. Worried that it could still be boring or painful, Harry added a deck of muggle style playing cards. He made the jacks, queens and kings of each suit a historical figure the man had mentioned during his ancient studies lessons.
“It’s perfect,” he reassured her. Honestly, Ginny could have named their child Voldemort and Harry wouldn’t protest considering.
“I won’t tell anyone,” Nott said. Harry wasn’t sure if that was true, as he could see Nott wanting to tell his roommates. Though it did seem unlikely he would spread it beyond them. Harry wasn’t sure how trustworthy they all were, but Draco and Crabbe would likely reign in Zabini and Goyle if need be.
It took a couple of hours, but eventually everyone was able to engage in the lessons with their usual vigour. Mulciber and Rabastan were tag teaming to teach Harry a spell called ‘Lynceus Sight’, even though it wasn’t part of the sixth-year curriculum. It essentially gave someone temporary x-ray vision. Unfortunately, it was exceptionally difficult to control. Mulciber told Harry about one of his classmates who cast the spell on himself in hopes of seeing his crush naked. He had been unable to stop after looking past her clothes and ended up seeing muscles and bones. And it hasn’t just been focused on his crush, but everyone who happened to be around. Grossed out, the bloke had tried to avert his gaze by looking at the ground but ended up seeing past the floor. The kid freaked out as his brain kept telling him he wasn’t standing on anything.
“Did you really manage to remove Burke’s soul by yourself?” Lucius asked. His voice held no condemnation, which gave Harry enough hope to answer truthfully. He was pretty sure Lucius had had a clear view into his cell, but realized the man might not have wanted to watch him get raped and turned away at the most critical moment.
“Ok... but would you please take these,” Hermione said and riffled through her bag until she pulled out a stack of pamphlets. “Just – just in case you change your mind.”
When Harry hesitated at telling anyone other than Crabbe, Theo turned his impatient stare on Harry. “I trust them, too,” he said.
Rodolphus Lestrange taught him a spell that mimicked birthing contractions in its victim. Harry was glad that the man couldn’t demonstrate the effects of the spell as Harry wasn’t sure he’d be safe if the man was able to properly teach him.
His meeting with McGonagall unfolded in a similar manner as his meeting with Flitwick had. Harry was eager to show her that he was ready and willing to catch up. At first McGonagall was pleasantly surprised at Harry’s progress, but grew suspicious rather quickly. It annoyed Harry, but he couldn’t really blame her. Even before Hogwarts he hadn’t been the studious sort. One of his teachers had called him intellectually lazy. Most of his teachers had been annoyed with his spotty record with completing homework. It was a bit tough to do when locked in a dark cupboard. Harry tried to do as much as he could during his lunch hour at school. More often than not he had to rush through it to make sure he was able to hand in everything. Needless to say, Harry never developed any useful study habits. The Dursleys didn’t care about his grades beyond the fact that he had to do well enough so they wouldn’t be called in for a meeting with teachers.
“It seems to be disintegrating,” Ishanders told Harry. He meant it as encouragement, but Harry felt the heavy weight of guilt settle in him.
This fear meant Draco had to do very little to convince Harry to attend family dinners with the Malfoys once Lucius felt well enough for company. The first few were as awkward as Harry expected. Neither he nor Lucius contributed much to the conversation. Luckily Narcissa, Draco and James kept the chatter going.
“It should probably just be you, Draco, and Crabbe,” Harry pointed out. Parkinson and Zabini frowned, but Theo nodded.
“Oh, come and stir my cauldron, and if you do it right,” sang Mulciber suddenly, drawing everyone’s attention to him. He swayed his hips as he continued, “I’ll boil you up some hot strong love to keep you warm tonight.”
“I was just going to request privacy charms,” Lucius said with a smirk. “I don’t want to see Dolph using your gift any more than you’ll want to hear it.”
Harry was on his way out of the great hall when they arrived. Another minute and he probably could have avoided a large spectacle. But a spectacle is exactly what these men wanted. Five ministry employees stood at the doors leading into the great hall. Four were dressed in Auror robes while the fifth was wearing robes that Harry had come to expect to see on an older high-class pureblood wizard.
Harry knew he was blushing, but that was a fantasy he had entertained before. Perhaps they’d fight about quidditch, or Draco would insult his friends, or Harry would push to find out what Draco was up to in the room of requirement. Whatever it was, they would argue, possibly try to curse one another, but as they drew closer, their fight would become physical. Only, instead of punches, they would find themselves kissing. What happened next would depend on how the fantasy started. If they had been in a deserted hallway, Harry imagined some heavy petting. Even in his own mind, Harry didn’t want to risk Snape catching them and seeing him naked. But when Harry entertained thoughts of confronting Draco near the room of requirement, he allowed the fantasy to go further. Without the possibility of being interrupted Harry imagined how Draco would feel in his mouth or arse; what he tasted like; what he’d feel like if he allowed Harry in him. Harry wanted to try it all, but assumed that they would only ever happen in his mind.
“Who? I can’t ask our friends. And soul magic isn’t exactly legal, so you can’t set up a proper study,” Harry pointed out.
“And how’s school?” asked Malfoy during a lull in Harry’s narrative of some of the more recent prophet articles. Harry immediately understood that Malfoy was asking after his son. Harry bit his lip while he considered how candid he ought to be with Malfoy. Harry eventually decided to be open given the fact that if the situation was reversed, he would want to know about his loved ones even if it wasn’t all good news.
At one of the back corners there was a toilet bowl and sink. The sink had a small bar of soap resting on one side and a toothbrush on the other. Fortunately, the toothbrush was still in a package, so it wasn’t a leftover from whoever has last used this cell. In the center of the back wall was a window. A cold breeze occasionally made its way into the cell. A glance at Malfloy’s cell revealed he had a similar window. If all cells had a window, then that would explain why the entire place was so cold. The window was high up, so Harry couldn’t see much. Harry guessed that he probably could reach the window, but it wouldn’t be easy. This was probably why Sirius had not thought to use it to escape until he became desperate.
Hale’s eyes trailed over Harry’s shoulder and the man frowned at something back at the castle. Harry turned expecting to see Snape hovering nearby. Instead it was Draco and Nott standing near Hogwarts’ front steps, doing little to hide the fact they were watching Harry and Hale.
“Do you hate me now?” whispered Harry when he couldn’t stand the silence any longer. Draco looked down and noted that Harry had started crying again.
“Er no, I didn’t take that either,” Harry said suddenly feeling self-conscious. “I am taking herbology.”
It was easy to agree to the first part, but he debated about whether to involve Draco. It was tempting as it would give Harry an excuse to spend time with Draco. It would also get him away from whatever he was doing in the Room of Requirement. But Harry also wanted it to be a surprise; a gift he could use to impress Draco. He didn’t know which option was more selfish.
It took a bit of maneuvering with some transfigured mirrors, but Harry was able to see into Crabbe and Lestrange’s cells to activate their wards. Unfortunately for the others, their wards would could only be activated the next time Harry was in the hallway. Luckily the chalk lines were faint enough that they should avoid detection.
When Harry saw Lucius and Albert yawn for the umpteenth time, he suggested they call it a night. He selfishly wanted them to stay up and distract him from everything that had happened. Harry did not feel tired and couldn’t imagine how he’d fall asleep in the same spot Burke had attacked him in. However, these men had been generous enough with him. It was odd but Harry felt more guilty for keeping them up late than he did for eating Burke’s soul in the first place.
Later, once they had escaped Nagini and Voldemort, they’d both taken a closer look. The band was made of pure gold, and the ruby was a genuine stone. They had no way of knowing if was Lily’s ring, but they both thought it unlikely someone would have purposely left an expensive ring in the rubble of Harry’s home. Harry knew it could have been dropped by any number of people that had checked out the scene of his parents’ murder. Still, he liked thinking it had been his mother’s and got lost until Harry luckily found it. The fact the center was a ruby - Harry’s birthstone – supported his theory. Hermione even suggested it might have been a gift given to her after Harry was born. Part of him felt he’d built a whimsical fantasy; that in desperate times, he was grasping at any means of connection and comfort. Still, he treated it as if it was his mother’s ring.
"Just draw any old frog then," McNair suggested. Harry tried, but the result looked more like Neville’s toad, Trevor... just skinnier.
Harry felt he made good progress on the assignments, but he hadn’t finished them all. He knew even more were in store for him after tomorrow’s classes. He was irritated that the professors hadn’t spoken to each other about assigning a reasonable workload. If Harry had the luxury of sleeping, he didn’t know how he would have gotten through them all. He didn’t want to agree with Snape, but pre-Azkaban Harry would have been overwhelmed.
“He has done well in all of his classes today. You heard Filius at dinner. The man was praising Mr. Potter’s resilience,” McGonagall interfered before Harry and Snape could start bickering. Harry wondered if Flitwick had actually been that complimentary or if McGonagall was playing it up for Harry’s benefit now.
Burke might think he was safe, but Harry was starting to feel the same way he had right before he blew up aunt Marge. The magic felt particularly potent given that Burke’s insults played upon in his negative feelings towards Bellatrix. Unfortunately, when Harry tried to actively reach for it, his magic seemed to slip out of his grasp.
“Potter, you need to speak to someone about your trauma,” Snape insisted as he looked down his nose at Harry.
“Me and Luna? No, she’s just a friend... I knew she’d make Slughorn’s party more interesting,” Harry said.
"Oh, could you Harry?" asked Crabbe. Harry couldn't say no to that once he heard the hope in his voice. It was also a better solution that sticking the letters to his person and stealthily transferring them to the bottom of a bench when he had to shower. The first time, he’d almost forgotten the letter on the way out.
Fortunately, Albert was the only one to glimpse his less than pure thoughts about Draco. Harry didn’t know if Lucius would still be supportive if he’d glimpsed some of Harry’s fantasies or caught on to the very real stalking Harry had conducted over the year. However, Lucius seemed to anticipate the danger and avoided all thoughts of his son just as much as Harry tried to hide them.
Everyone grew quiet again, but this time it seemed less tense than before. Harry glanced around his cell as he reflected on what Malfoy had said. The cell was more spacious than Harry had pictured when Sirius spoke about Azkaban. Of course, that hadn’t been too often as the man did not want reminders of his time there. Harry wondered if he was in Sirius’ old cell. Knowing his luck, he was probably in Crouch Jr.’s old cell.
Ron and Neville recounted how the aurors came back a few times and thrashed their dorm. It only stopped once the newspapers started talking about Umbridge and criticizing the ministry. One reporter had caught wind of the aurors’ constant visits to the school and wrote an article claiming the ministry was harassing Harry more by destroying his stuff.
“You don’t know that. Pregnancy problems happen all the time. I can’t do that again, Draco. Not to you,” Harry said.
“He will continue with his classes. For now, we won’t ask a mind healer to come,” Dumbledore said while Snape’s frown grew more pronounced. “However, we will revisit this decision should any other professors share Professor Snape’s concerns.”
“Your dad. You said you needed him, and well, talking to him helped me, so I thought it would be the next best thing. It took awhile, but I figured it out – well, Theo really helped, but, er, yeah,” Harry said and then pulled out the mirror. A quick glance down confirmed the mirrors were still connected. Harry gave an anxious-looking Lucius a reassuring smile before holding out the mirror to Draco. Draco automatically took it and then gasped as he saw Lucius in its surface.
Not important to the plot but in case anyone was curious: Blocks A and B are for less sever crimes/sentences while C and D are high security. Block A & C are women’s while B and D are men.
A door at the end of the hall opened, which caused Harry to tense. It was difficult to tell time here, but it felt too early for supper. The sound of footsteps confirmed that it was guards and not dementors returning.
“He has made remarkable progress in catching up with his studies so far. I’m sure with Miss Granger’s continued support, he will be back on par with his peers soon,” McGonagall said. Harry was conflicted. He appreciated her confidence in him, but was annoyed that she contributed most of his success to Hermione. He might have relied on Hermione in the past, but he was trying to improve his own skills now. It hurt that McGonagall assumed all progress he’d make would be mostly Hermione’s doing.
Harry glanced at Burke but knew that the man was probably purposely leaving him with death eaters who hated him. The smile Burke gave him as he unlocked the empty cell next to Crabbe pretty much confirmed it. There was a maliciousness in his eyes that made Harry think he’d actually feel safer once the cell was locked and Harry was able to get some distance from the man.
“How smallminded of you,” Lucius sneered in true Malfoy fashion. “You’re overlooking the fact that others far more important than you or Burke have already staked their claim on the boy.”
Before she left, Mrs. Weasley promised to come back every day until he was cleared to leave the hospital. She made him promise to stay with them until he was ready to be on his own.
“You were fighting for your life, and the lives of many others. Whatever it is, you had valid reasons,” Draco insisted.
“Oh,” Harry sighed. “I can do privacy charms!” Except, before he could put any in place, the door at the end of the hallway opened up and they were told to file out of their cells for a shower.
“I guess,” Harry snorted. Reluctantly he levitated the rocks away from him. He lined many against his own walls but had to return some to the hallway and the other cells. As soon as all the pebbles were on the ground, the uncomfortable feeling of having Burke’s soul wedged in him returned. He was tempted to start levitating the rocks again, but if the other prisoners were waking up then the guards would be by with their breakfast in the next hour or so. Harry couldn’t chance it.
“Unlikely... at least not today. I wouldn’t be surprised if he got a warning over your tattoo. He’ll have to be careful about his actions for awhile,” answered Nott.
“It doesn’t have the same kick though, does it? Potter, what else you got for us?” asked Mulciber. Harry ran through uncle Vernon’s more creative insults as well as the ones he picked up from the Weasley brothers over the years. All in all, the men spent close to forty minutes calling out any insult that came to mind. Harry used Burke as inspiration to come up with increasingly vulgar names.
“I recall that. Draco moaned about it in his letters home. He was quite upset with you in particular,” Lucius reminisced with a fond smile.
At his response, Harry noticed movement behind the dementor. He glanced into Malfoy’s cell. A white peacock was watching him. Harry glanced towards Albert’s cell, but it looked empty. He thought he saw something shift under the cot and assumed the man was an animagus as well.
“It’s not going to help you, Potter,” Burke mocked as he refocused on Harry. Fortunately, he no longer wanted to strangle Harry to death, but unfortunately his hands resumed their exploration of Harry’s chest. Harry tried to push him away but barely had much strength after their last struggle. He couldn’t stop Burke from pressing his hips to the bed as the man leaned down to lick at Harry’s chest. He tried. He pushed at Burke’s head and mumbled “no, off” but the man ignored him. Burke even tried to ignore the lingering dementor, but its presence was usually enough to kill anyone’s boner.
“Perhaps we just need the younger generation to show us a different way. Reginald has made your recent stay a rather public spectacle. That attention might open debate, and sway witches and wizards to be open to reform,” Dumbledore mused.
“Ugh! That man is such a... a...,” Harry struggled to find a word that was insulting enough for an idiot like Burke. He couldn’t find one that properly articulated his feelings about the man, so he settled for something Dudley and his cronies used, “fart-knocker!”
I didn't want to humanize Burke by giving him a first name, but it seemed odd that all his coworkers kept referring to him as Burke. I don't know about you, but most people refer to me by my first name. So, I settled on Maxim Burke because it sounded like 'maximum berk' (sorry if anyone reading this is actually named Maxim Burke!). As in true J.K fashion where names have meaning, his name would mean "the greatest fortification". In a way it works as he serves to build up Harry's defenses against an attack... and I think this subconsciously led me to have Harry build a literal wall around him at the end of this chapter.
As a rule, brewed lube was preferred over the conjured variety. Still, Harry doubted there was a single boy in Hogwarts that didn’t know that spell. Harry had been taught it by Fred and George. The twins had burst into the dorms one day and claimed it was their solemn duty to teach Ron essential life spells. Harry and the rest of the dorm were given a front-row seat to Ron’s humiliation, but everyone ended up learning quite a few useful spells. So, it was exceedingly easy for Harry to fill the bottle with conjured lube.
Their honeymoon also served as a research trip. They had specifically looked at countries that legally allowed the study of soul magic. Draco had been in contact with several specialists over the years, and several had invited him to visit. They planned to visit them all eventually, using family trips to avoid too many questions. Their honeymoon was the first such trip. They only booked a one-week trip. Neither of them wanted to leave James for longer than that. Draco had set aside three days dedicated to his research with a fourth as padding if needed. The first three days of their honeymoon were spent in bliss as they barely left the bed. Unfortunately Harry was bored the rest of the trip, and made a mental note to plan his own activities for future trips.
Instead of arriving at the ministry as he expected, they are standing at the edge of a large body of water. As far as Harry could tell, there was nothing for miles around.
Harry fell asleep surprisingly quickly and had two blissful hours where he was pulled away from all the thoughts that left him with a heavy heart. Then, a loud noise broke the quiet of the prison and caused Harry to jerk awake.
“What else? There must be more to your suspicions than just an odd conversation with a shopkeeper,” said Malfoy.
“Draco, I can’t lose you too,” Harry said. When Draco reached out for his hand, he clasped it desperately.
“I don’t do enough. I know I could be better if I wasn’t so... ashamed, I guess. I’m trying to give him the life Ginny would have wanted for him,” Harry knew Ginny would have given James a great childhood. Harry would never know if she realized the child was carrying his soul, but even if she had, Harry knew she would still want the best for him. He didn’t doubt that she’d loved him, even if Harry was clearly unworthy of that love and trust.
“I think we need to look at James’ soul... and other children to compare,” Draco said. If he never managed to convince Harry to see himself in a good light, he could at least try to convince him James was his son and not something more sinister.
impress Draco. Harry internally debated whether he ought to create an entire vanity instead of a small mirror. That would probably get Draco attention... assuming Harry figured out how to send it to him. He didn’t think owls would be able to manage an item that big. As soon as Harry started to consider the logistics of it, it occurred to him that Draco might be more insulted than impressed. With Harry’s luck, Draco would probably think Harry was calling him vain.
“Dad!” a happy voice called out before Hale was jumped by a first year Gryffindor. The two said their hellos before Hale introduce his youngest, Regina. It surprised Harry more to learn Hale had a daughter in Gryffindor than to realize he’d named her after himself.
“Potter, you’ve just returned from Azkaban. You shouldn’t return to classes until we’ve evaluated what you can handle,” Snape insisted.
It honestly surprised no one that Harry drank too much that night. Fortunately, his plan to avoid people by hanging around Draco worked. He said some unfortunate things, but nothing he couldn't bounce back from when sober. Draco, while he did nothing to stop Harry from drinking, had helped steer the conversation towards safe topics. If Harry remembered, he would have to thank him in the morning. Unfortunately, despite Draco’s best efforts, Harry still managed to embarrass himself. At some point he had drunk enough to feel queasy and had to run out of the room before he vomited in front of everyone. Despite making it to the privacy of the bathroom, it didn't take too much sleuthing for people to realize what had happened.
“And they stopped you? From spiraling?” Hermione asked and Harry was glad she was trying to understand.
“I did. I made a horcrux. It hurt so bad, Draco,” Harry said. He tensed, waiting for Draco to walk out in disgust now that he knew exactly how horrible Harry was. Instead, Draco  eventually resumed running his hand through Harry’s hair.
Having Hermione and Ron at his side felt right, but watching the rest of the gathered Weasleys, Harry couldn’t help but think it was wrong. Fred and Ginny were missing, and it left two large and obvious holes. Mrs. Weasley was holding a tiny baby with black hair instead of red.
“Very well,” McGonagall said. After another awkward offer to talk, which Harry declined, the two parted ways. Harry could feel her concerned gaze track his departure. He didn’t dare stay. Once her guilt and concern faded, she would remember that Harry had gone to the trial to support a known Death Eater. He didn’t want to see her concern turn to anger.
“Draco, aren’t you going to hug Potter too?” teased Zabini. Harry was almost certain the other boy had caught on to Harry’s crush.
Mulciber also taught Harry what he called the finger trap jinx. It forced an opponent to clap their hands and interlock their fingers.  Nothing prevented the person from immediately separating their hands, but it might give Harry the time needed to fire off a more complex spell. Plus, his opponent might drop their wand in the process. Harry wondered why none of the Death Eaters had used that spell on him previously, but as he caught Nott surreptitiously copying Harry’s movements, he realized he wasn’t the only one learning new spells.
“That’s one option,” Draco acknowledged. He couldn’t discount it without Harry turning his reasoning on him.
The carriage moved quickly and in a matter of seconds Hogwarts completely disappeared from Harry’s view. Harry felt like he was going to sick-up at any moment, though he doubted it had anything to do with the speed of the carriage. It was as fast as the knight bus but a lot smoother given they were not weaving around muggle cars.
Harry quickly checked his surroundings but didn’t see anyone looking his way. He crouched down and removed the ankle bracelet that held the box of letters. He nervously rolled the small box between his thumb and finger as he debated what he should say. He’d have to open the box himself so the others wouldn’t assume it was a trap.
“It was only after hearing stories like... after hearing how a muggle hurt someone magical that Albert would speak poorly of muggles. At least to me,” Harry said to further encourage them away from Harry’s mortification.
bound two souls together. I suspect I will have to order more books - from overseas as mine and mother’s day-to-day lives are still scrutinized by the ministry and journalists,” Draco said.
Once the box was ready, Crabbe and Nott handed over the letters they had already written. Both had written their sons' names on the letter so that they could be properly distributed once the box was full.
“Except toilet paper,” added a nearby voice. “They won’t fight you on that. No one wants to be cleaning that shit up.”
“I don’t plan to use it on anyone,” Harry asserted. These men might be keen on corrupting Harry, but that didn’t mean he had to use his new knowledge against anyone… except maybe Voldemort. Harry thought it would be some great cosmic joke if he managed to defeat the dark lord using a curse one of his servants taught him.
"Be glad he can't dress you like a proper young wizard, because you’d look like a prat too," teased Mulciber.
“I just-” he sighed. Despite his new resolve, Harry struggled to keep his emotions onboard. “You won’t understand, but I feel guilty for using up his soul this way.”
“What?” Harry was shocked. If he could do some basic healing spells, then shouldn’t the guard be able to?
No idea if 77K galleons (£232035.44 according to an online converter I found) is enough compensation for what Harry went through by court standards. It probably varies by country, and who knows what the wizarding world standards would be. If Dumbledore had been representing him, the headmaster would have been satisfied with just getting Harry acquitted. However Hale is one of the best lawyers money can buy... he probably would have asked for even more money, but this amount isn't arbitrary. I got plans for what Harry will do with it ;) *tease tease tease*
Burke turned to Harry, looking horrified. Harry didn’t know if Burke realized it was Harry or just his own worst memories had started playing in his mind. The more scared Burke got, the more giddy Harry became. Harry knew it was only a fraction of the joy the dementors got when they did this. They pulled a person’s good memories towards them like a damn appetizer before they claimed their soul. This left the dementors all warm and fuzzy while their victims were left with their worst feelings and drowned in misery. It incapacitated them long enough for dementors to pull out their vulnerable souls.
“Ron was a mess. George too. I’m pretty sure Mr. Weasley wasn’t holding up as well as he pretended to,” Hermione offered.
“We find it helps if they have a visual reminder,” Burke stated as he opened the box. Harry braced himself for any sort of torture device, but only a potion bottle and some cloth were in the box. Burke pulled out the cloth and cut off a piece using his wand. Harry flinched at the sound and the chains constricted once again.
“Pans, go get Theo, or we really will be here all night,” Draco interrupted before Parkinson and Harry could continue to bicker.
Harry tried to ease into the topic; more for his sake than hers. But Ginny had always been able to see through his bullshit. “Harry, I love that I get to see you. I really do. But you’re not here for a snog in the woods...” she prompted.
Despite being prepared, it was difficult for Harry to talk about everything. Especially the part where he decided to bring Sirius in. Harry wasn’t comfortable using his godfather as a tool for his own release, but he did want retribution for Sirius. So, when he spoke about the ministry locking him away without a trial, it was easy to remind the world that the ministry had a history of doing this. Since no one was telling him anything about scheduling a trial, he was starting to believe the ministry planned to keep him in Azkaban indefinitely no matter how unlawful it was.
The door swung open to reveal Harry standing at the top of the staircase. Snape sneered at him, but Dumbledore offered Harry a seat before Snape could say anything scathing about Harry eavesdropping.
Conversations eventually tapered off, but Harry felt more relaxed than previously. He couldn’t say Azkaban was pleasant, but he thought he could survive it until Dumbledore got him out. Harry still hoped it would be soon.
