With every word of Dumbledore's answer, Harry could feel his chances of escaping dwindle further and further. If it was as he said— and really, who was he to doubt Albus Dumbledore? —then it was certain. He'd have to be the one to defeat Voldemort. Most of his friends couldn't even say his
As Dumbledore's eyes landed on Rosier at last, Harry could almost feel a crackle in the air. The Headmaster was a tall man, but in that brief moment he seemed to grow at least a couple of feet. Rosier was clearly trying to match him, but it was barely even a competition. Finally, whatever unspoken battle the two had been waging came to its inevitable conclusion, and Rosier bowed his head.
"You want me to put your trunk away?" Harry asked her, prompting her to start as if she'd been lost completely in her thoughts.
"Hey, did you hear that Furley might be moving to the Cannons?" Ron asked. As usual, he pounced any opportunity to talk about his beloved Cannons. "Heard it from George."
"When Voldemort… killed me, I didn't just wake up," she said. "I'm not sure what it was, but it felt like I was back in Malfoy Manor. I was in this corridor that was decorated like the one in Mother's suites. Father never usually let me go there, but I snuck in a couple of times with Dobby's help."
"Didn't she use a switching spell to swap your ears with your tackle that time in fifth year when you tried to hit on her?" asked Dean, clearly unconvinced.
Neville nodded, and added, "All the rest of it is really just identifying you. That line, 'his hand, her heart' seems to be the really important bit, though."
At least Rosier had disappeared after his unmasking at the Ministry. That was one fewer person to worry about.
The other witches and wizards had formed a loose ring around them by now, and though Snape continued to retreat, there was no escape.
Didn't everyone? Harry nodded hesitantly. What did Voldemort have to do with him?. "He found out that Lucius Malfoy was working against him from inside the Death Eaters, and went to his Manor to kill him, along with his whole family," he said, pausing when Sirius scoffed quietly before he was silenced by a look from Lily. "When he tried to kill Iana, something happened, and his Killing Curse backfired somehow. What does that have to do with me?" He glanced at his parents. They still looked very serious indeed.
It took a moment for Harry to get his bearings as, for once, he really hadn't been paying attention to whatever it was she was doing. "What are you talking about, Malfoy?" he retorted, almost on instinct, really. "In case it slipped your notice, you're the one who dragged me in here."
Clumps of her hair were frazzled and still smoking lightly. Soot and grime caked it thickly enough that it defied gravity, and he could barely tell that it was meant to be blonde. The cosmetic charms she used had clearly been badly mangled by either the explosion or the Fiendfyre, and she had something of the look of a distressed panda about her.
"It is evident that the boy is incapable of comprehending this task, Headmaster," Snape said, speaking for the first time since Harry had entered the room. "I do not understand why you insist upon his involvement."
In fact, things were very nearly normal. Perhaps the greatest change from what Harry was used to was that Malfoy had taken a step back for whatever reason.
At that moment the two other Elves who had been creating the requested raspberry chocolate tarts snapped their fingers, and two of the large tarts materialised on the bench nearest them. Ron and Seamus wasted no time in pouncing on them, much to the delight of the Elves.
As children greeted their friends, and shuffled past each other, lugging trunks bigger than them through the narrow carriage doors, it was like the last month had only been a dream.
Catching her before she fell very nearly resulted in them both ending up on the floor again but through some minor miracle he managed to keep them upright. He looked down at her to give her a slightly embarrassed smile.
"She loved that ugly thing," said Helena. "Perhaps more than she ever loved me. And I resented it, perhaps more than I ever resented her. She was so perfect. Beautiful, witty, and of course with the wisdom of Ravenclaw herself. How could I ever have measured up to her standards? Especially when her standards were impossible to reach, even for her. She'd forgotten what the Diadem did for her, I thought. She'd come to think of it as a natural part of herself, and she resented me for failing to live up to her legacy."
The rumble of a distant explosion vibrated up through the floor. It hadn't come from outside. "Do you think everyone agrees?" Harry asked.
Another boom echoed through the house, louder than the last, and Harry felt rather than raw or heard the house's protective charms give way. It was a strange sensation. If he was to try to describe it, it would have been as like when his ears popped, and everything suddenly sounded subtly different until he got used to it again, only it was some other sense than hearing. Moments later, the small glass windows set into the front door shattered.
"Well, that'll be quick," said Harry with a shrug. "I have no clue what happened. I just knew what the Prophecy said, and knew I couldn't let Iana down after what she'd sacrificed."
He pushed the torch's unlit tip to the limit where the water reached, so that it would remain lit and illuminate them, and returned to Dracy, who was naked, sitting in the sea with the water covering him almost to his breasts, which were swollen, full of milk. The cry of pain that echoed in the night made Harry's eyes fill with tears, and he knelt between Dracy's legs, opening them and touching him between his legs. With two fingers, he placed them inside the vaginal channel, down to the bottom, and his eyes widened when his two fingers opened easily inside.
“Lucy? Are you okay?” Harry asked, approaching, and breathed a sigh of relief when she threw the berries away.
threatened you and your family. We were just a bunch of kids. You can’t even be hold accountable for that, you were underage and under pressure. We all were. I’ve made mistakes too, and I sure as hell suffered because of them. I know you suffered too. You had to work here, hadn’t you? My family knows that. And I know you won’t like what I’m going to say next, but my family won’t hold grudges like some
“But we are. And you’ve made me so much better. I’m sorry that I was a complete prick when we were teens… I…”
, saying it was amazing even though it was three hours long. Draco decided to give in, and he was glad he did. The film wasn’t as incredible as Harry said it was, but the soundtrack was simply amazing. He could listen to that forever, and it actually made his mind burst with ideas for a completely new story.
He should have waited though, because he was now in the middle of bloody nowhere, his wheels deep in snow, and the sky getting darker and darker.
They ate in silence, enjoying the comfort of each other’s presence, and after a few minutes and many eaten fruits later, Draco sighed loudly.
That took Harry by surprise. And McGonagall knew it would, or else she would’ve talked about it before he agreed to do it.. Now he couldn’t back out, and he was very sure she had done it on purpose, especially because Malfoy didn’t look at all surprised. He sighed, nodding and resigned.
“Potter, you’re awful,” Draco laughed, and as he tucked himself again, he heard a loud cry that showed that Lily was probably awake. “Since you’re the one who wants more of these, you get to change her now and see if you still have the same ideas when you come back.
“My name is Harry. We've been here for a few months now. We tried to leave, but it was fruitless. We almost died.”
“Well, I’m not very padded,” he pulled his sleeves up, showing his skinny, milky white arms. Where his Dark Mark was, only a scar was left. Draco told Harry that it disappeared on the day Voldemort was defeated. “So I guess I do feel colder than other people.”
“My baby sister was just born, my papa can’t really take care of her alone and Christmas will be a big affair with the baby’s arrival and all. He needs me there, sir.”
“He says he’s grateful that you saved his life so many times. He doesn’t feel worthy of talking to you.” She made a face at that, and Harry shook his head.
Now… It was different. He had a family. A true, awesome family, five kids and an amazing omega at his side – and, those four babies also had a crazy aunt, who happen to be the mother of their older brother. And it was even more amazing when Harry threw into the mix the other aunts and uncles those babies had. Yes, it was different. Because now Harry knew who he was, where he stood and what he wanted for life.
Now, though, Draco really wanted it. He really wanted the whole, full experience. He wanted to get pregnant and have Harry act like the bloody angel he was and never let Draco step on the floor again because he was just
“Because you are a wonderful mother, my beautiful girl.” Harry said, lightly stroking Dracy's chin, making him blush and look away.
On the back wall, there was a big, wooden door that probably led them to the bedroom and bathroom. McGonagall moved her wand, and seemingly nothing happened, except that a few books that appeared on the table.
In the present, Draco kissed Harry’s mouth tenderly, giving in to the desire he could feel rippling through Harry’s body.
“Soooooo we’re having a third one in the future?” Harry asked when Draco was tucked on his side, eyes closed and ready to sleep.
“We should probably get this out of here. All cargo will be damaged if the sea can penetrate the boxes.” Roberto pointed to the objects. Harry found it useless to worry about it, after all, there was no way for the man to sell it since he would no longer be able to leave the island. But maybe he was still in denial, as he and Draco were at the beginning when they fell there. “Can you help me, Harry? Lucy probably shouldn't be carrying weight in her condition.”
“Please, Harry… Please I want it…” Draco’s voice was almost high pitched, goosebumps all over his skin.
“Stop saying that. Getting pregnant is not easy. And you’re not broken, we did all the tests and both of us are fine. And even if you couldn’t get pregnant, it wouldn’t make you broken. We’d just have to find another way to have a baby.”
Sirius reached out, touching his little sister’s hair and smiling softly, which was different yet sweet on his face, since he was a trickster by nature.
Draco didn't answer. After a few seconds, however, he shuffled the inches that separated him from Harry, touching his back against the auror's chest, and his arse in the curve that Harry's legs made forward. Harry said nothing. He just held him by his waist, wrapping an arm under Draco's neck and pulling him even closer.
“There’s no way you can go to the city with the weather like this!"  The man almost screamed at the other side. “My house is just a few meters from here. I'll park your car there and you can spend the night. I think the weather might be better tomorrow.”
“I think I'm pregnant.” Draco said, and Harry gasped after his words came out of his mouth, but he didn't move away. His hand went to Draco's soft belly, his thumb slowly stroking over Draco's tank top.
“I need to talk to you,” Dracy said, tying her long blond hair in a knot behind her head. She was shirtless, and several jute necklaces with shells and seeds covered her breasts up to her nipples, making only the bottom visible. It took Harry a few seconds to look up at Dracy's face, who rolled her eyes. "Can you go two seconds without thinking about sex?"
It was all a bit bizarre, being friendly and joking with Draco Malfoy, but at the same time, it felt like they had known each other closely for such a long time. Almost as if Harry was reuniting with a long lost friend. They were never friends, but Harry could see that, in another world, it would be much easier to just have accepted Draco’s offer in their first year and simply shaken his hand.
At the five months’ mark, Dracy began to tie small tufts of Talitha's black, unruly hair, which made her green eyes appear more clearly. With each passing day, she looked more like Harry, from her tireless curiosity to her determination. She responded to her parents with screams and laughter, clapping her hands and feet, showing all three of her teeth with the joy she felt when Harry disappeared into the water and appeared again in front of her while the three were bathing.
He didn't know if Lucy would want to be called Draco again for the time being, but Harry wasn't going to change it until she asked him. She snuggled into his chest, and didn't respond, but the gentle kisses she gave to his chest muscles were enough for Harry to know that she was reciprocating.
Auror Ronald Weasley was once again on one of those boring meetings. They never had any goals, and they only discussed things that, in the end, would not improve the searching at all. Harry and Malfoy were still missing, and nothing and no one could find a solution to find them.
Somehow he bumped into something, and held the shape at his side instinctively. It was Malfoy. Out of sheer instinct, and perhaps years of training as an auror, Harry groaned an ‘ascendio’ underwater, almost like in his fourth year, and on the verge of despair, his magic reacted so hard that he was thrown out of the water, Malfoy in his arms.
“She just called you 'mama'.” Harry smiled, looking at Dracy, his smile opening even more when Talitha repeated.
Malfoy smelt like freshly picked Jasmine with a hint of mint. He had this scent all over himself, and it was so strong it overwhelmed my senses. My Elk wanted to do a mating dance wherever I saw that bastard, and I had to focus as hard as I could so I wouldn’t forget a cue.
“Let's go. We need to look for something better than coconuts,” Harry said, but Draco was lying on the floor, stomach up, his face red.
Draco didn’t answer. He walked closer to Harry, held his neck with both of his hands and pulled Harry onto a kiss.
Upon seeing that scene, Draco smiled, looking at Harry and pointing at them silently. Harry returned the smile, not only because of the scene, but because he saw Draco's smile light up and make him look like he was before he discovered the pregnancy.
They kissed for so long it seemed like it was an eternity, but they needed to breathe, and soon they were panting against each other’s mouths.
“Next time you see I’m getting too much into work and I’m not eating… Just… Grab me, you know? I… I really do forget I’m hungry and I’m not good at stopping things once I started them.” Draco asked, and Harry nodded, putting his arm over Draco’s shoulder, hugging him.
Harry jumped from the bed, hugging Draco so tight he lifted him from the ground. He couldn’t help the happy tears that fell down his face, as they cried, smiled and kissed each other surrounded by their child’s magical print.
Harry positioned himself better between her legs, holding one of her thighs with one hand, and with the other, he held the base of his penis, pressing it into her body. Lucy moaned, her body arching towards Harry's, her channel even tighter than Harry remembered, pressing around his cock in a visceral grip. Harry couldn't control himself. Soon his thrusts were strong and violent, his instinct speaking louder. He knew that she really needed that pleasure, because soon her body shook again in a delicious orgasm.
“What he means is: we’re okay you’re Harry’s mate. Just so you know that” she said, then extended her hand.
“Well… I’m happy you decided to go out in the middle of winter in a fucking snow storm.” Harry said, and Draco laughed out loud.
.” She said, but I could see her cheeks were reddish, and she was smiling. Ron grinned at her, winking one eye, before turning to me.
“Hey, what's up?” Harry entered the room, his tanned skin glistening from the beach water still drying on his body. He sat next to Draco, stroking his arm and kissing his cheek gently. “Can I help you in any way?”
At the end of the day, they were able to see the quads on their tiny, human form. Draco was still a bit tired and sore, but he just couldn’t rest, fussing over their babies.
He felt pity for Malfoy. Being an Unspeakable, he worked in the depths of the Ministry without making the effort that the Aurors made every day. The day must have been heavier than any other day the man had ever experienced in his life - except, of course, the war days. So he took one of the closed coconuts and, with his knife, cut the top, opening enough so that he could drink the water from inside. He took a sip, then patted Malfoy's arm, which took his forearm out of his eyes and stared at him, grouchy.
Was the goal to caught his attention? Or to prove that he could get a girlfriend before him? Or maybe it was an attempt to make him jealous? If that was the case, he has succeeded for once in his life.
It's weird because when he's with all his friends, he has no problem getting all in Harry's face and spitting insults at him with zero care. But when all his friends leave his side, he suddenly doesn't have that courage?
The two stood face to face with each other, it being night again. Harry had found Draco sneaking out again and took this chance to maybe get Draco to at least show interest. But he knew the boy was stubborn.
Harry had an idea that maybe he was acting nervous because he was staring at him. He sure wasn't acting like this before he knew Harry was watching him. But now he's gotten all uneasy.
"Have you come to kiss me again?" Draco half teased with a roll of the eyes. "If that's what you want then yeah. But you act like you didn't enjoy it." Harry slyly says with a small smirk.
"I wasn't having a savior adventure! I was just-" Draco interrupted Harry and smirked. "Oh no, Potter! You were just out sneaking around the halls in the middle of the night for a midnight snack. Right." He gibed. Harry clenched his fist and wanted to wipe that smirk off Draco's face. But he couldn't do so without getting detention. "Shut it Malfoy." Draco looked at him with a more snarky smirk than before and it was as clear as day that he was getting to the golden boy.
Although the way Draco would roll his eyes when Pansy turned away had Harry thinking he wasn't with Pansy because he liked her. Which made Harry wonder, why was he dating Pansy?
She stops and turns to the enemies. "We're here. Now good luck." She says and Draco looked at her as if she just murdered his mother. "Wait what?! We don't get any light?! Or directions?!" Harry furrowed his brows at the forest which was illuminated by the moonlight that was extra bright that night. "No Mr. Malfoy, you do not receive any extra source of light." Draco scoffs and walks up to her. "What do you mean
Or not that surprised because so many people have a crush on that boy. Harry doesn't think Draco realizes that everyone knows how much the girls adore him.
Maybe he could find him now. He was sure he couldn't be the only one awake. Maybe Draco was a night owl like him? It wouldn't hurt to find out, right? Which sparked an idea. The Marauder's map!
His eyes glance from Pansy to Harry but it diverts so fast that you'd have to be closely watching to be able to have caught him. But it was a good thing Harry was very observant and caught on to this.
"Exactly, now all we need to do is keep walking left." Draco explains and Harry nods. They start walking left and within 7 minutes, the air started getting colder. "Bloody hell it's cold!" Harry rolls his eyes and eyed Draco's appearance. "Yeah well, no one told you to walk out your room with barely any clothes on." Draco quietly seethed and was mentally planning Harry's death. "Shut up Potter! No one asked you to wake me up and ruin my rest with your little savior adventure." Harry glared at Draco and scoffed in the direction of the blonde.
"Yeah sure." The raven-haired boy said with a smile before glancing back at the pure-blood couple. He felt an unsettling feeling run through his veins, but couldn't identify it exactly. Jealousy maybe?
"If that's crux then that constellation must be.. Orion!" Harry looked at him confused. "Orion?" Draco turns to his side and looks at him lazily. "Yes, Orion. The west and east constellation. Then that means that this star over here is Polaris! The northern star!" Draco pointed and Harry was starting to see the pattern and trailed the stars that notably formed an arrow. "Wait, I see it. It's pointing this way!" Harry points to the left and Draco nods in agreement.
He showed no interest before, nor does he now. So what is he gaining from dating this pure-blooded girl? Attention? Popularity? Affection? What could she be giving him that he doesn't already have?
As lunch ended and everyone left, Harry had caught Pansy flirting with Draco while he was walking with his friends to his next class. He felt a little jealous but she was his girlfriend.
Harry would have said a rebuttal if he hadn't noticed Draco was behind her. He raised a brow at Pansy and glared at her when he thought no one was watching him. Except Harry was.
Harry bites his lip and looks at the ground, his mind blank at what he just heard. He has no idea what any of that meant, but he might as well try Draco's idea. It might just lead them somewhere. Draco uses his finger to guide himself and connect the stars and find all the constellations. "Wait I've found the south star!" Harry looks up and his eyes follow to where Draco's finger was pointing. He kinda saw it, but didn't ponder on it for long.
But what if Draco liked her? Harry grimaced at the thought of Draco kissing her and being all lovey-dovey with her. He just doesn't look good with her and his heart stung a little even thinking that.
Draco was absolutely stunned and felt paralyzed. He couldn't believe this was happening, but the movement of Harry's lips made him believe otherwise. Harry James Potter was kissing Draco Lucius Malfoy.
So he did what his heart told him to do. Kiss him. He softly pressed his lips against Draco's and moved them despite waiting for Draco to push him off. But that never happened. Much to Harry's surprise, Draco's eyes fluttered shut and his lips began to move. His lips slowly followed the rhythm of Harry, which gave Harry confidence to lick at Draco's bottom lip. The blonde let out a soft sigh in delight and opened his mouth a little. Harry's tongue gently slipped into the mouth of Malfoy and very softly played with Draco's tongue. When Draco would see couples at school making out, it always looked so sloppy and rushed.
Or maybe it was just her idea of some light reading. Nothing could warm the cockles like reading about how your great great great great gand-father had once killed an entire village full of muggles for letting their sheep graze on his land. Probably did just the trick when she was feeling down.
Harry pushed the door open, and found not only Professor Dumbledore and his parents, but Sirius too. None of them looked happy. Even after an exchange of spells with Malfoy which had resulted in more than one botched transfiguration he hadn't seen the Headmaster looking so grave.
Had something happened between Snape and Malfoy? Some kind of falling out? What about Rosier? He was meant to have been one of Malfoy's men too. Unfortunately, he wondered about the answer to that question a little too long, and Snape turned his irritated gaze in Harry's direction.
"We are all dying, Harry," said Dumbledore, a small smile causing his beard to twitch. "It does us no good to fear it, but I have no intention of doing so before my task is done. Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me if I did not at least consider the possibility of my failure."
The way she avoided his eyes as she said it told Harry that there might be a little more to it than that, but he kept his silence for the time being.
It was a strange thing; to know he was about to die. The pain, great as it was, seemed to lessen, and the screaming of his mum and sister melted into the white noise that had filled his mind.
"Yeah," said Sirius, grabbing Remus around the shoulder. "If this old grump gets to join the Potter clan just because he turns into an oversized Crup once a month, I think you get a free pass."
"Doesn't make you immune to fear," said James with a smile of understanding. "I don't mind telling you that I was cacking my pants when Voldemort attacked the house. Anyone in their right mind would. I still fought, though. And I'll fight today too. Just like you."
Harry would never admit it, but hearing his father say that, and the accompanying little squeeze on his arm from his Mum made a world of difference. They didn't know what the future held, really, any more than he did, but at least they were still there. He still had so many questions, though.
With Effie gone, Harry pulled the curtain closed once more and charmed it silent. He turned to Iana, and she answered his silent question with a shrug. He looked back at his mum.
The following morning, the papers delivered news of a mass break-out from Azkaban, supposedly masterminded by Evan Rosier. Still not a word of Voldemort.
She was crying freely by now, and no amount of hugs could stem the flow. The words continued to tumble from her, though. Harry wasn't sure she'd be able to stop them even if she'd wanted to.
The laugh that question prompted was distinctly sardonic. "Didn't you notice? I don't have those any more. Not that they'd need it, anyway."
By telling him, he'd pretty much signed his death-warrant. Of course Voldemort was going to try and get to Harry's friends when he was so obviously involved somehow. How had he not thought of that? "I got him killed, didn't I?"
"And I am a merciful saviour. I present to you a choice, one which I trust will be simple. Surrender Iana Malfoy to me, and I will allow you all to return home in safety. If you do not, I will not be responsible for any damage caused to Hogwarts, or injuries caused to the children in your charge."
It was followed by the distant thunder of a shelf collapsing, toppled by the vibrations. Motes of dust rained down across the room, knocked loose from the rafters high above.
Chuckling, Dumbledore shook his head. "No, not this evening. I find myself sadly underdressed for such an event." His eyes sparkled with mirth. "In addition, I am also somewhat unwelcome within the halls of the Ministry, and I doubt my arrival would be able to pass unremarked."
"You should have a bath, Iana," he said gently, trying to ignore the way his fingers were being ground together. "You'll feel much better after one. I promise."
"Rosier'd have a field day," said Harry. It was amazing just how easily he found himself falling into the same old camaraderie. "Imagine if you'd been seen. That'd be an entire week of lectures on the 'dangers of over-integration'."
"You always were far too taken up in your own myth for your own good," said the Death Eater. He shook his head before lazily pointing his wand at Lucius. "
?" If Dumbledore was still looking for them, her harsh shriek would surely help him. "How can you not know?"
Harry spun around to find Iana loitering in the doorway, looking torn. She clearly didn't want to be there, and yet when he met her eyes, there was a look of such loneliness and despair that it hit him almost like a physical thing.
"Well, murder maybe, but splitting your own soul? What does that do to a person?" She caught Harry's incredulous look. "I'm not saying I'd murder anyone, obviously. Honestly, you and your Gryffindor morals."
"We're under attack!" one of the other Death Eaters shouted. He pointed in Harry's direction with his wand. "
"If we'd done that, we'd all have lost," said Sirius. He didn't sound happy about that fact. "The Dementors and Death Eaters were just itching for us to make a move."
Effie's little giggle, Harry's little joke clearly catching her by surprise, had a snotty, bubbly quality to it that he was sure would usually leave her mortified, but this time he merely sniffed loudly and rubbed the tears from her eyes. "He won't know what hit him," she said, her voice still a little weak.
"I know," said Remus. He rubbed Harry's arm comfortingly, but it was undermined by the way his voice cracked. "You don't need to try to convince me, or anyone else, that you made the right choice. Do you think I wouldn't have killed him if I'd had half a chance?"
The moment Effie heard the name, she stopped in her tracks. Her eyes went wide as she realised what their parents must be doing. "What? But he's dead. Iana Malfoy killed him!" Her breathing became shallow and rapid.
"You don't even know what you're looking for," said Harry. He put the book down and leaned back in his seat. "You don't even know if you'd be able to recognise it if you
Her eyes were a stormy grey quite unlike anything he'd ever seen, and her lips parted just slightly.
"Really?" Harry asked. Usually Rosier was one of the many teachers who seemed convinced that the sun shone out of Malfoy's arse. "What happened?"
Iana had clearly not been overjoyed by the new additions to Harry's study group, but after Harry had reigned in a few of the more barbed remarks aimed in her direction by the others, the rate at which she released conspicuously loud sighs decreased back to normal levels.
That was a strange notion. Trust Malfoy? Had anyone said that to him last year, or even just a few months ago, Harry would have laughed in their face. Now, though, he found himself doing just that.
The crystal-blue gaze that Dumbledore turned on him forestalled any further complaints. "As you and Lucius did not see fit to involve me in your scheming, I see little reason why I should enlighten you on the reasons for my own actions," said Dumbledore with uncharacteristic coldness. He waved his gloved hand. "You may have done the right thing in coming to me with this after Lucius' death, but I think it is clear enough now that were I to abide by your demands, it would have been too little, and far too late."
to you after your birthday? You went off to talk to old Dumbledore and we pretty much haven't heard from you since."
The distant sound of shouting rose up out of the darkness behind him, and he realised they had very little time indeed.
"Our Elf saved my life," Iana said simply. "He also probably did more to raise me than my father ever did."
That was as good a cover as any. "Look, Professor Dumbledore said I couldn't tell anyone what it was about, okay?" Hopefully he'd assume it did indeed have something to do with Malfoy.
One of the medi-wizards made their way over to the bed Harry and Remus were both sitting on, a bowl and some unidentifiable potions in hand and Remus winked at Harry. "Now, looks like it's my turn. You should go check on your mum. She'll want to know you're safe."
"Indeed it does," said Helena, finally turning to look at them, a grave expression on her transparent features. She laughed mirthlessly. "Mother never did admit what happened. It would have tarnished her precious reputation."
"Aww, Mum!" Effie moaned, abandoning all pretense. "Why can't I stay? Whatever this is about it clearly involves me too."
"That'll have to do," she said once the open space stretched a dozen or so meters across, like a huge crater in the debris of so many destroyed shelves and their contents.
"But it's still Voldemort, right?" Harry asked. "He's still going to be out for me and my friends because of who we are."
He glanced around to make sure no one was listening in. There was no one nearby enough to hear, and while he could see Effie staring at him with a strange expression on her face from the other side of the room, no one else was paying them any undue heed. Despite that, he flicked out his wand and closed the curtains, charming them silent as he did so.
knowing was perhaps more dangerous than knowing. It is not the same for you. Please, Effie. Just a few minutes."
"Hey, that's not fair," said James, adopting a look of outrage. "There was that time during the Christmas of '88?"
Lily clearly understood what he meant and turned to her daughter. "Effie, dear, could you maybe give us a few minutes?"
"Our parents," said Harry, quickly heading off any more targeted lines of enquiry. "About what happened over summer."
"It was Peter," said Harry as they watched him go. He wasn't sure why he said it. Perhaps he needed someone to talk to. "He led Voldemort to us."
It was obvious she wasn't going to leave him be and was likely spoiling for a fight, but he wasn't going to give her the satisfaction.
As the Headmaster contemplated his answer, Harry realised that he looked weary. More weary than Harry had ever seen. From the first time Harry had met him, and all through his Hogwarts years, Dumbledore had been like a force of nature. He'd lost a lot of his influence to Malfoy over the years, but he'd never seemed to allow that to get to him. Now, he looked old, and Harry wondered just how long he could keep the fight up.
Iana shrugged, and for a moment Harry was distracted by the things it did to her upper body. "I don't really know. It's why he used my blood in the spell to revive himself, though. He said it was old magic. I don't see how it can be that, though. It hasn't protected me from anything he's done since then. I don't even know if it stayed with me after I was a baby."
"Go kiss a Dementor," Iana hissed as she shoved him against the wall. "I gave you your answers. It's not my fault you're too dense to see the strategy. What did you expect him to do? March up to the Dark Lord and challenge him to an honour duel?"
Harry opened his mouth to argue back, but was stopped in his tracks when Stump's wand appeared in her hand and a Langlock Jinx hit him in the face. His tongue attached itself firmly to the roof of his mouth.
It was a challenge presented to me by Seratin on DLP. I don't think he ever expected me to take it as far as I did, but here we are. I guess the answer to that driving question depends on how you define 'decent'. On the other hand, this might be the longest setup ever deployed for a one-liner lame joke, and of that I am actually rather proud.
"But they'll stop him… right?" Effie asked, pleading. "Even if they don't, he'll want to go after the Girl-Who-Lived, right?"
"It was the sacrifice," she said, shaking her head. She got up and started pacing back and forth across the room. "But surely it would only work if you know you're giving your life… and Voldemort gave us the ultimatum. Iana for our lives. It all fits, but— Oh, that man."
He heard an inelegant snort behind him, and realised that Iana was still there. He turned, ready to defend against whatever verbal barbs were about to be levelled.
"Okay," Harry managed, but she was already lugging her trunk out of the door, and down the corridor. All too soon, she was out of sight, and Harry was left alone.
A million questions warred for supremacy in Harry's mind, and a roaring sound filled his ears. His mother said something, but he couldn't make out the words above the din. He felt her squeeze him, and some semblance of order returned to his world.
"So, you two have a good Christmas?" Neville asked, as Harry and Effie bustled into the cabin he'd managed to lay claim to.
"— the way Snape spat that last word made it clear he would have much rather have replaced it with something else —"is no match for the Dark Lord. We would be better served throwing the Longbottom boy in his way. At least Iana Malfoy has been trained for this."
Had he not known just how knowledgeable his mother could be, he might have been surprised that she was able to recognise the spell just by looking at him. This was the woman who'd been able to tell which specific Smartie was a transfigured Bertie Botts Every Flavour Bean without even seeming to try, though.
Iana Malfoy, and she'd even allowed him a few pictures. It hadn't taken long, however, for her to get bored. By the third week of term Goyle had 'accidentally' broken the camera, and it had never returned. The expression on her face, though, would have been worth the effort of repairing it.
As Harry had suspected, two sets of eyes didn't actually prove to be any better than one. The core issue, which he'd been able to identify early on, was that neither of them had any idea what they were meant to be looking for. Despite that, Harry found himself appreciating her help. Easter was slowly approaching, and with it the amount of classwork rose exponentially. So much so that even Neville was only able to find time once or twice a week to help Harry in his search. Ron was making an effort too, but he was still on the Quidditch team, and had even less time than everyone else.
Not one to be cowed by a superior look, Iana met the ghost's eye with a steely gaze of her own. "Do you have any idea what he might have done with it?"
At that moment, Harry heard a deep rumble which vibrated through the house. He met Iana's startled gaze, and they both bounded out of the room. Effie materialised in the door to her own room.
"Yeah." Harry heaved a long sigh. "I guess we can still take it to Dumbledore," he said after a while. "At least that way he'll know what he's looking for."
Leaving his book open and forgotten on the table, Harry wasted no time in following her. They passed Madam Pince who, from the pinched look on her face, was indeed about to give them both a stern talking to, but she was stymied when Iana and Harry bypassed her and stepped out of the Library. Iana then led him into one of the less-used corridors, and slipped into a disused classroom without a backwards glance.
"It is a lot, I know," said Dumbledore, seemingly reading Harry's mind. "Yet I find myself without other recourse should the worst come to pass. I ask only that you consider carefully whom you wish to tell. Should Voldemort become aware that we know of this he will surely take actions to further protect himself."
"Yeah, yeah. Okay. Professor Dumbledore had some pretty bad news," he said vaguely. "But, look, it's ancient history. I'm really sorry I cut you guys out."
"This is a detention, not a house-witch gossip circle," he drawled, not looking up from whatever it was that he was so focused on. "As such, it will be completed in silence."
The suspicion disappeared completely, and she adopted a worried expression. She glanced around the room, clearly understanding his meaning. "Well, maybe we should go to the kitchens, then. Neville can cover for us all. Right, Neville?"
"Mate, it was Lucius Malfoy," said Neville, as if he was pointing out the blindly obvious which, in all fairness, he was. "He had his greasy tendrils in pretty much everything. With him gone, who's going to be the one pulling Fudge's strings? I heard they're already planning on giving him the boot."
"Hmm," said Lily, clearly distracted by the first question enough that she'd barely even registered the second. She blinked. "Not at all. It is an old, deep kind of magic. There are no spells or incantation; certainly no wand movements or potions, but it's still magic. No one really understands how it works, not in the same way we understand Charms, for example, but it is most certainly a strong enough magic to surprise Voldemort."
"Ah, Harry. You are right on time." The Headmaster held a hand out for Harry to take. "We should make haste."
"No, really, what do you care? A few mudbloods and blood traitors less in the world probably doesn't seem so bad to you."
"Obliviated I guess. Maybe Imperiused," she shrugged as if it didn't really matter which. "They were useless, anyway. The Dark Lord swept them aside like they were nothing."
"You know what I mean," said Iana. "Anyway, I think my point has been made by the simple fact that we need to study this stuff to have a chance against Voldemort."
His heart hitched in his chest a moment, when Iana glanced up and met his eyes, but she looked away again a second later. "My mother, maybe?" she said uncertainly. "She left me with some kind of power which meant Voldemort couldn't harm me."
"And yet, you will," said Dumbledore, his intense blue eyes focused on Harry once more. "Why else have you been pushing your friends away, and spending every waking hour studying?"
How long the kiss lasted, he couldn't have said. All he knew was that when they finally broke apart his lips were tingling. He stared at her, unsure what to say.
"You think yourself more an expert than the Minister?" she asked quietly. "Perhaps you gained your potions mastery over the summer? No? Then I would recommend you be silent on topics of which you know nothing."
It wasn't until New Year's Eve that Harry had been able to get anything more than he already knew from his parents.
When Effie didn't move immediately, her eyes tracking over the scene with obvious interest, Lily raised her voice just slightly. "Effie!" she said sharply, prompting a startled jump. "Bath! Now."
Even then, he wasn't entirely sure what it had been about. Mythical hidden rooms in Hogwarts, maybe? Whatever it was, none of the information had made it past his eyeballs.
She whispered something that Harry couldn't catch as another explosion rattled the heavily laden shelves of the room.
That his voice didn't falter as he said those words was a minor miracle. He wanted nothing more than to cut and run but he knew his family wouldn't do the same. Even if they did, they'd probably never be truly safe.
"So, what do you have planned for the holiday?" Dean asked in a game attempt to break the impasse. "You don't usually head home for Easter."
For a moment it looked like he was going to say no but then, much to Harry's surprise, he shrugged. "Not like any of the teachers are running patrols at the moment anyway," he said breezily.
With a quelling glance at Iana, Harry silenced whatever it was she was about to say. It was clear that Helena had just about forgotten their presence, lost as she was in her reminiscence. It was not so dissimilar to watching Binns lecture on the Goblin Rebellions of 1412. An interruption might be ignored, or it might result in a complete change of topic. You never could tell with ghosts.
As usual, their arrival was met by much excitement from the Elves. While they typically did everything they could to remain out of sight in the rest of Hogwarts they seemed to really enjoy it whenever Harry and his friends went to visit them.
Harry groaned. They were nearly back, and now he had to head all the way across to the Headmaster's office? "Alright. Cheers mate. I'll go now."
"It is a heavy burden I must place upon your shoulders," said Dumbledore as he looked over his half moon spectacles with a sad expression. "Yet, it seems I have no choice in the matter. I have never been one to set much faith in Prophecy, preferring instead to have faith in people above all else, but even I cannot overlook it in this case. When the prophecy was first uttered, I had hoped to keep it secret, and had I been successful in doing so, perhaps you would not now be facing the task which is before you.
Harry cracked open the huge volume and started to read through the sections specifically relating to the founders. At least Bathilda Bagshot had some idea of how to retain a reader's interest. There was still a lot to get through, though. It seemed as if she was intent on covering every event in their lives which had led up to their choice to create Hogwarts Castle, and being some of the most powerful and famous witches and wizards of the time, there was no shortage of them.
Whatever that was, though, Harry never found out as before he could ask, Neville called out to them from one of the higher flights of the moving staircases they were walking beneath. "Oi, Potters!"
"Hey, walking wounded here!" said Sirius, pointing to his still badly damaged face. "I'm asking because it looks like I'm going to have to pass the torch on earlier than planned."
Still fairly lost, Harry followed suit, and joined her in making for the door. "Sure. He'll probably be in the Infirmary. He's been spending a lot of time there since the fight. I guess they needed lots of potions."
"Can I sit?" Harry asked politely. His voice might have wavered just slightly with the effort it took to not throw some insult at her, but he managed it.
"He's broken through," he said immediately, though he really needn't have. Lily had already leapt to her feet and sprinted over to one of the windows. Harry wasted no time in following.
Harry and his other friends had of course always poked fun at him for it. Couldn't let an opportunity like that pass them by.
Unsure if he'd be able to answer, Harry instead opted to bow in the accepted manner. Behind him, his mother called out to him.
Remus Lupin, one of James' other friends from school, was something of a sore topic at the moment, Harry knew. Even if he hadn't, the rapid darkening of James' and Sirius' expressions would have made that clear.
anything," said James firmly. "You're only seventeen, and there's no way we're going to let some hokum spouted by that old fraud put you into the middle of a war. If we can keep him from regaining a body, he might
"Not that I don't think it couldn't work or anything, it's just it seems really strange, you know? If it's too personal or something, you don't need to say anything, but I was just wondering because there's lots of rumours and stuff. Sorry if—"
him? Harry scrunched the parchment up as he balled his fist. "She's just throwing her life away!" he shot back. "Voldemort isn't going to keep to his bargain. You all know that!"
In a pool of light beneath one of the floating blue lamps which provided a sparse illumination for the hall, Harry found the source of the voices.
"Sit down, dear," said Lily with a smile. "I think we all have some questions, anyway. Would you indulge us?"
"Miss Malfoy is uninjured," said Dumbledore, raising his voice after concluding a hissed conversation with James which Harry had not been able to hear. "There are more important matters to discuss. I have summoned the Order to meet, so perhaps it would be best if—"
"We found one," Harry explained once he was close enough to be able to speak quietly. "Iana destroyed it, but it didn't want to go easy."
Dumbledore led Harry over towards the security desk. In the half-darkness it looked to be unmanned, which was strange even on Halloween.
The lack of response he got from Iana wasn't exactly positive, but it wasn't another 'no', so maybe it still counted? He wasn't sure how long they sat there, the pregnant silence filling the corridor.
Sirius had been left with horrific burns over much of his body, the result of the acid-filled pustules he'd been cursed with. They were also highly resistant to healing charms, and as a result Sirius had spent much of the last few days in a morose silence.
"I asked her why they'd done it. Why I'd been raised like I had, only so I could die. Why couldn't I at least have had a few happy years if all that was going to happen was Father was going to throw me at Voldemort's feet the first chance he got. I asked why they didn't fight for me like your parents fought for you.
"Harry! Are you okay? Merciful Merlin, what are you doing in the middle of all this?" he asked. His words came so fast that Harry almost couldn't comprehend them.
With an expression that was somewhere between worry and surprise, Iana took one step closer. "I'll be okay."
"I don't know," Harry admitted. "If Dumbledore found anything out before he died, he didn't tell me."
On a whim he also sent a blasting charm at the roof just metres behind them. Maybe the rubble would slow the Death Eaters down.
Harry looked around frantically; hoping, praying that Dumbledore would descend upon them in an irresistible whirlwind of spells, but he was nowhere to be seen. Where could he have gotten to?
"I grow tired of this charade," said one of the Death Eaters as he stalked back and forth. His voice seemed familiar, but Harry couldn't quite place it. "You know your defiance is futile. The Dark Lord will not be denied."
It was a fair question. It had been Lucius Malfoy who had rolled back the rights of pretty much every non-human species there was, with the sole exception of goblins of course. Technically, it had been the Ministry and the Wizengamot, but they'd both been well under Malfoy's thumb for years after he'd chased Dumbledore out.
," said Harry as he made a face. What would everyone think if he started palling around with Iana of all people? Not to mention, she was still an absolute bitch, even if a few of the edges had apparently been filed off over the summer. "What were you talking about, anyway? What's wrong with Rosier?"
"I think I shouted at her then," Iana said, and the sob that followed contained a little bubble of laughter. "I told her she wasn't even real. I was dead, and it was all just my imagination. She just smiled, and hugged me. Then she told me I didn't even need to be dead if I didn't want to. She said there was enough soul in Voldemort's shard to keep the ferryman distracted.
"You'll be passing nothing on to Harry," said Lily firmly, though Harry could see the mischief sparkling in her eyes.
Sitting down on the edge of her bed, Harry frowned down at her. "I thought it was destroyed, like mine?"
"How many years have you known her?" Neville asked as he shook his head. Harry made way, and they both entered the cabin. Neville continued, "Sometimes I think you might need glasses more than Harry does."
"Thought you might miss it this time," said Dean as he shifted over a bit to make some space. "Reckoned you'd end up stealing your dad's car and flying it to Hogwarts or something."
"Well, are they here yet?" she snapped as her eyes darted towards the top of the stairs just in case Harry was being followed.
The scream that the elder Malfoy let out was something that Harry knew would live on in his nightmares. He'd heard of the effects of the Cruciatus Curse, but nothing he'd heard or read could have prepared him for the outpouring of agony that came from Lucius as his body, clearly held up and stationary by spells, twitched and shuddered.
She rubbed her face tiredly, and her expression suggested she really wasn't sure about whatever it was she was going to tell him. Eventually, though, she sighed and started speaking.
"How many are there?" Harry Potter asked as he gazed over a table straining under the weight of dozens of gifts in many different shapes and sizes. He looked at his mother with an expression of concern.
"It means he tried to give me up before too," she said bitterly and finally her eyes started to fill with tears. "I dream about it sometimes. I just thought it was a dream. I can hear a voice, I think it's my mother, pleading with someone to let me live, and I can hear my father trying to get her to step aside. Then there's a flash of green light, and I wake up. The bastard tried to trade me for his own life when I was a baby, and then he did it
"Well, yes and no," said Harry as he flipped another book, this one a slim tome bound in leather so old and cracked that it looked about ready to fall apart. "Everyone and their Granny seems to have
Harry glanced over in the direction of where James was still concealed from the rest of the room by drawn curtains. There was no reduction in the urgency of the witches and wizards entering and leaving his little cubby. "He's alive," he said, hoping it was true.
Voldemort laughed at him. It was a high, cruel sound that had very little in common with the laughter that Harry knew.
"Dumbledore has one," said Harry with a shrug. He'd never even heard of the things before that. "Surely your dad must have had one too?"
"As big as it is needing to be," the Elf replied, nodding his head as if it was obvious, and causing his huge ears to flap around like wings.
"You're alive," he said when they broke apart. It was almost too much to believe. Around them the fighting was already dying down. He didn't know who was winning. He still didn't care.
"As I believe Sirius wishes to explain, Lucius was never, to my knowledge, working directly against Voldemort."
She didn't argue, and bounded straight up the stairs, managing to take them three at a time despite actually being a little shorter than Harry. She grabbed Effie's hand and immediately dragged her down the upstairs corridor. "Follow me!" she shouted to Harry and Iana as she went.
The Grey Lady held up an imperious hand, neatly forestalling any other questions as she glanced up and down the otherwise deserted corridor. Apparently, it was not nearly deserted enough, as she floated off to the side, straight through a door. After a moment of indecision, Harry and Iana followed her.
It was the Charms classroom, but with how late it was Flitwick was nowhere to be seen. The Grey Lady hung in the air in a beam of moonlight which shone down through the high windows lining one wall. Her long robes floated around her as she stared out at the dark forest beyond.
." As Lucius lifted off his feet, just an inch or two into the air, Harry looked back at Iana. "Then we pull him with us."
Both of them were very puzzled to find the room very different from how they remembered it. The shelves were still there, though this time everything had been arranged much more neatly, with clear paths through that didn't involve clambering over mounds of ancient mouldering books.
Iana's glare melted away, and she slumped back against the suit of armour with a muffled clank. "You're better off not knowing. Father said he'd handle it."
Iana stared at him in surprise, before her lips tightened once more, and the ghost of a frown passed over her expression. For a moment, he thought she was going to laugh in his face, but she didn't. Instead, she merely scoffed, before turning on her heel, and leaving the cabin. It took a moment for Crabbe and Goyle to come to terms with the sudden reaction, but a few seconds later they too were gone.
"But you're seventeen now, Harry," Lily added. "We'd hoped that all the nonsense with the prophecy could be forgotten when Voldemort fell. There is nothing I want more than to be able to shelter you from this, but you're of age now. We couldn't keep this hidden from you forever. You deserve to know the danger you might be in."
That seemed to be the signal for what remained of the fighting to come to an abrupt halt. All around them, witches and wizards were scattered, but it was immediately clear that the majority of the casualties were among the Death Eaters. The hesitant allegiance of the Aurors had been lost the moment Voldemort had fallen, and the Death Eaters had been significantly outnumbered.
"Can you imagine what she'd do if you went up to her and tried to give her a hug or something?" Neville asked, grinning. "She'd hex you so hard you'd be pissing teeth."
Harry was almost in a dream as he was excused. He drifted from the room, barely even aware of the brief few words of apology which followed him. It was only when the door snapped closed behind him that he emerged from the daze. He paused as he heard a voice through the doorway.
It was weird, but then again, it was all a political statement, and I was a pawn in all of this. I sighed, but walked with grace and poise with Pansy slightly behind me.
Harry got up on the bed, taking off his own clothes - already looking like rags - and kneeling between her legs. Moonlight came in through the window, and Harry sucked on the fingers that had once been inside Lucy, who moaned, her breathing labored.
“I have wanted to do this since I saw you for the first time in McGonagall's office,” Draco said, kissing down Harry's chest, over his abs and across the hair trail leading to his pyjama bottom.
The Curse-breaker was completely soaked. He was looking at Harry, utterly shocked because it seemed like the weather inside his office wasn’t being very kind to him.
He still felt awkward, though. His hair was longer, almost shoulder-length, and he had it wrapped in a messy curly bun. His glasses were new, square and black-trimmed, and he was wearing new Hogwarts robes because his old ones were too small for his body now. He felt a bit less weird than when he was seventeen, but the awkwardness never really went away.
, considering it was for just one person. There was a bathtub, for one, and it was big. The showerhead looked like it was made of gold, and there were two sinks in the counter. Draco’s toiletries were already on his side of the sink, and putting his clothes hanging on the side of the tub, Harry came back to grab his own toiletries that he had forgotten. Shampoo, shaving cream, razor, soap and deodorant. Harry couldn't imagine any wizard needing more than that, but Draco certainly had at least double his number of things on his side.
“Of course, mate. Which one you want?” Harry asked, putting Saturn to bed and grabbing the books he was into lately.
“Yeah. They’re just feeling a bit weird. They were all cuddly and warm inside of Papa’s tummy, and now they’re out in the open. It’s a bit scary for them.” Harry said, sitting on the small settee they had in the nursery, patting on his side so Saturn would sit at his side.
“I’m Harry,” the man replied, shaking Draco’s hand with his gloved hand. It was a firm handshake, but not enough to hurt him.
Their conversation stopped there. The Professor cleared her throat, asking for them both to sit on the chairs in front of her desk, and she sat behind it.
The visit to Draco’s Healer wasn’t extraordinary. He went there with Harry and the Healer did all the procedure – magical ultrasound to see if his internal organs were okay. After everything was cleared – yes, his uterus was just fine, he could get pregnant if he stopped using contraceptive spells, but due to the fact he wasn’t a full veela, they couldn’t easily track his fertile cycles, since his eggs would usually be absorbed into his body after a while and that also made sure that Draco didn’t have anything close to a period. Sometimes he would feel cramps, but no blood in sight. It also meant that his hormones were misbalanced, and that made it harder to get pregnant. He would have to take hormones to make sure he’d become pregnant, and the healer told him that it could change his body slightly – but not as big as changes that would happen when he actually got pregnant.
, so they could deem their family finally complete. Being a family of all boys was decidedly chaotic, to say the least.
“What happened?” Harry asked, and looking down at Draco’s face. The first thing Harry noticed was his friend had wet eyes, his breathing was broken and far too fast. Fuck, he was having a panic attack. How long this had been going on, Harry didn’t know. “Hey. Hey, Dray. Look at me.”
DO I HEAR THE WORD UPDATE? I'm sorry I've taken so long to update this story. Life has been really hard on me these last few months. I'll try to do better and update more often. Thank you for all of you who stayed here with me!
Training with Malfoy was… Eye opening. Not about the dancing. I still didn’t like dancing in public and it still made my stomach roll. But there was many things that I’ve never even thought, and he talked about it as if every single person in the world should know. Like my family, and about what I was missing. I always knew I was the only Potter out there, that I had no one to count on. I knew my grandparents were old when they had my father, and that he was an only child. But it didn’t mean my grandparents didn’t have a
Still, he was sleepy. He had received a report from the Department of Mysteries, and it made no sense to his sleepy mind. He remembered knocking on his favourite Unspeakable door because it was the only one he trusted to give him the information without a mixture of the crush everyone seemed to have on him, and he remembered seeing Malfoy open the door with a not so friendly face. They argued over the report. Malfoy left his office - without letting Harry get into it - locked and headed for the department aisles, looking for an item that should’ve been there.
He sighed, giving up on Cygnus for the moment and sitting Sirius at his side, then he put Scorpius and Aries on Draco’s side. Knowing that Cygnus wasn’t going to be easily bribed, he grabbed a box of every-flavoured beans and moved back to the settee. He grabbed the toddler from where he was playing on the rug and gave him the sweet, sitting the boy in his lap. Cygnus was finally quiet, and Mark moved so he could fix a thing or two on the boys so he could take the picture.
“I vow to protect, love, and surrender to you, my omega, even giving my life in order to make you happy every day of my life, only stopping once I’m away from you because of my own death.”
It took at least another forty minutes for us to get there. And another hour so the servants would take of my clothes, wash me and redress me in a soft, white, see-through gown that would technically cover my whole body if it wasn’t so transparent.
“Should we do the testing to clear our heads, then?” Harry suggested, and Draco got out of the bed, grabbing his wand and turning back to Harry.
“Well, I was busy admiring you,” Draco said, looking at Harry’s toned chest. His husband was delicious, with his tanned skin from Quidditch, freckles on his shoulders, sparse hairs on his chest, that would go down to his stomach, thickening under his navel and disappearing into his pants, that Draco knew was hiding his favourite toy.
to hear the rest of the song, it sounded like a story. I looked at Dean Thomas, who was beside me, being also a tenor, and I whispered:
They finished setting up a makeshift camp when the sun was already touching the sea. They dug a hole in the ground and surrounded it with stones, filling it with twigs and dried leaves so that they could set fire at night. They left the opening through which they would enter the side of the "cabin", to prevent animals and the cold wind from hitting them directly.
Maybe it was because it was overwhelming for both of them, but Harry couldn’t wait any longer. His pace turned almost ferocious, the sound of skin against skin reaching his ears as he pounded inside Draco over and over, smashing non-stop against his prostate.
Finally, they were able to create a raft that not only floated but could support their weight. They also made two oars to help them in the process and, after picking coconuts and fruit for the trip, stated that they were ready to try to leave.
“I think we better look for him,” Harry said, taking the spear with which they hunted fish and following into the forest, Lucy in pursuit.
Draco sat up and accepted the coconut, drinking thirsty. Harry sat beside him, letting his body rest a little. His muscles were still warm and he didn't want to cool, but he felt that at that moment he needed to give Malfoy some support.
He couldn’t help but feel his heart thundering inside his chest. Draco was so handsome, even when wet and panicking. Harry had harboured feelings for his friend for about a year now. It started as friendship, pure and simple, and  even though Harry thought of  Draco as one of his best friends now (and even Ron and Hermione included him in everything nowadays), ever since the fateful day where Draco had truly,
It was all it took for Draco to come inside Harry’s mouth, filling his mouth with his pleasure. Harry’s fingers and mouth didn’t stop until Draco stopped coming. He withdrew his fingers from Draco and licked his cock clean, kneeling between Draco’s spread legs and running his hands over Draco sensitive skin.
“Yes, please,” Draco nodded, opening himself again for Harry. Harry proceeded to touch the head of his cock to Draco’s rim, and pressed inside, Draco’s slick helping him in.
, Potter!” Malfoy answered, and his hands shook. “Come here, hold this.” Malfoy practically ordered, and Harry stood up quickly, reaching out and holding the object he was pointing at: it was a shell-shaped brooch. Whatever Malfoy was expecting didn't happen, and he let out an agonised groan.
I blinked, a bit confused. Yes, I loved our coupling, as he called it, but it wasn’t just… expected. Could we really live like a
“Hi, I’m Harry Potter. I’m eighteen years old and I want to be an Auror. Nice to meet you.” He raised his hand so Malfoy could shake it, and upon seeing his hand, Malfoy snorted, which turned into a hearty laugh.
“Harry, I really don’t care about the size of your cock. Just take off your clothes and shower. You stink too.” Draco said, starting to condition his hair and closing the showerhead.
“I'll just wash her, don't worry. Now I need you to cleanse your body and then use healing magic, okay?” Harry instructed, and Dracy nodded, his eyes fixed on the baby.
“If I wore trousers, you wouldn’t stare at my cock, so that’s a no-no for me. Anyways, I was thinking—”
me, for one, and I really don’t want to fight anyone.” I sighed, looking around, seeing that we were both alone after everybody left. “I know it looks like I enjoy making people mad, but I just enjoy making
Except, half an hour later Draco was singing his solo, and just after him, it would be me. My heart started beating fast even before Draco’s song was over, and I was sure I missed one note or another.
“I am a Gryffindor, so… Yeah, I mean at the Gryffindor table.” He teased, and I opened my mouth once or twice before asking again.
I couldn’t help but be embarrassed. I was an adult, an alpha, for God’s sake. I should’ve known better than end up in a fistfight with Blaise Zabini over Ginny Weasley like a dumb troll. And he wasn’t even doing anything, I just
“We make a boat,” Harry said, sighing. “And we try to get out of here by sea. All we have to do is to get to any continent, any of them, and we can look for some magical society in there.”
Slowly, the hormones started to change Draco, small changes that they could observe slowly appearing. He was gaining weight, and Harry loved that being honest. Draco was always so skinny, and seeing with a bit of extra padding wasn’t bad. He rounded around his thighs and hips, a little on the stomach and his tits started to show a bit more. Harry loved to spend time licking and sucking and teasing the little nubs while fucking him, Draco sitting on his lap and grinding against him.
I never came so hard. My mouth was drooling, my eyes were turning and my cock was jerking like crazy. My hole was so stretched around his knot I couldn’t even flex my muscles. It seemed like my body was soon calming down, and he held me around my waist, hands in my stomach, and moved us to the side, away from the puddle of my own come.
There was no way to carry the torch. Harry frowned, closing his eyes and wishing, with all his heart, that his path would be lit up. When he opened his eyes, small balls of light floated down the path towards the cabin, but Harry wasted no time in admiring his new magic. He had his world in his arms, and he needed to take care of them.
“If you don’t want me to stare at your cock, wear some bloody trousers, would ya?” Harry complained, and Draco just smiled.
The assembly took even longer. It was a matter of trial and error, and for the most part, the attempts went wrong and they needed to start over. The work was tiring and the days were hot, but Draco always refused to take off his own shirt. He said he wasn’t an exhibitionist like Potter, and that he could work
“Looks like when Hermione is having pregnancy cravings and I have to go to the bloody shop at 5 AM to get some green bananas or something equally weird.”
“Harry... Can I make you a request?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded. It was dark, but he was sure Draco had felt his movement, so close they were. “I know that... It's strange... But... Could you treat me like Lucy?”
Slowly, Harry approached Draco, unsure how to proceed. With one hand, he touched his waist, the other still holding Draco's hand where they were resting between them. When their lips met, Draco sighed softly, bringing his body even closer to Harry’s and touching him on his arm. More confident, Harry moved his mouth against his, finding little resistance. Draco opened his lips and let Harry's tongue taste his, slowly but willingly. Soon Draco was leaning against Harry’s chest, Harry's hand gripping the Slytherin firmly behind his back, Draco's hand tucked into his hair.
When Harry came out of the water, Draco was putting the lid back on the pot so the cotton balls wouldn't fly, and they went to the shelter on the beach to make lunch for the day.
I wasn’t expecting that, so I shook it awkwardly, my cheeks burning. I was expecting her to punch me in the face –
They were finally all seated in their usual seats, and about 12 new students were going to be sorted this year. All the tables were a bit empty and a little bit grim. The Slytherin table was the one which was the emptiest between all four, and Harry felt the irrational urge to go and sit there, just so it looked less empty. He searched for known faces and found Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of Malfoy, and maybe it was for the best, at least for now. Harry had spoken in his favour at the trials, telling them how Draco and Narcissa Malfoy had saved his life while he, Hermione and Ron were looking for the Horcrux. Luna also vouched for Draco, her speech soft but emotional.
“Dray… Stop… Or else I’m going to come…” Harry begged, and Draco smiled around his cock, before stepping up and swallowing saliva, still smiling.
Dracy pursed his lips, as if only at that moment he realised what he was about to do. He looked around, the berries on the floor, and the baby, crying in despair, on the floor.
“My king, are you feeling all right?” Pansy was soon beside me, and I licked my lips before looking at her.
I never felt this way before. No one has ever looked at me the way he did, and no one has ever sung to me the way he sang. When we came backstage and Flitwick thanked all of us, allowing us to finally have dinner, I still hadn’t let go of his hand. It made me feel safe and important, and I didn’t want to feel like old bastard Malfoy yet.
Their life was filled with pictures: pictures of Harry and Draco when they were dating, once they got married, after the birth of their first child. There were pictures of Ron, Hermione, Rose and Hugo, at the beach, on the first day of preschool. There were pictures of Pansy and Theo, of Blaise and Ginny, of Luna and Rolf and their twins. There were plenty of pictures of Neville and Hannah, especially birthday pictures, because they always had a two day party for him and Harry.
And it all spilled out at once. A sob cut through my throat, and my eyes got blurry with unshed tears, that soon were spilling down my cheeks. I started trembling hard, my own feelings out of control, and I hid my face, trying to hide away from him. I was crying – no,
“Fuck you, you walk naked around me all the time!” Harry crossed his arms, his face red, and Draco laughed.
Life with Talitha changed the reality as they had adapted. After a year on the island, things seemed to have become routine. They woke up, marked the day on the calendar stone, went on to take care of hygiene, but always with Talitha in their arms, stopping to play with the baby, change her diaper - which Dracy had to make several and still continued to do with both the cotton and the fabrics that came in the boxes - and breastfeed.
Draco moaned, forgetting all about the ‘being recorded’ thing, and just gave into the pleasure of being filled to the brim. He was getting louder and louder, as Harry started to move in and out of him, his cock slowly getting deeper inside of Draco until they were flush against each other.
I tentatively smiled at him, and he smiled back, as if his shirt wasn’t wet with my tears and probably snot. I must’ve look stupid with a red nose and puffy red eyes.
Draco held the elastic of Harry’s bottoms, pulling it all off, leaving Harry naked. His hard cock reached his navel, the veins protruding, precome oozing a bit from the tip.
“Kids, hn?” Mark tried to laugh it off, but Draco and Harry looked at each other, not really sure if that was an accident.
“Hmmm... You’ll fuck me so deep…” Draco smiled, moving to sit on Harry's lap again, getting up and resting on his knees, one hand gripping the base of Harry's cock and putting the head on his wet cunt. Draco slowly descended on his cock, his warmth enveloping the Auror's cock completely, while his eyes closed, his mouth opening in an 'o'. “So big…”
“Draco… Even if we become boyfriends. Even if we get engaged. Even if we marry and adopt a quidditch team of little kids, you’d still be my best friend.” Harry assured him, and Draco hugged him tightly, breathing in and closing his eyes.
“You should get your things and get inside. Your face is turning dark pink with the weather, and the snow is getting thicker by the minute", said the man, "I’ll park my truck in the garage over there,” the man pointed to another large building beside the house. “There’s space for another car. I suggest you do it unless you like your car frozen?”
I was feeling like I was about to pass out. Flitwick was giving us a motivational speech about how amazing we were in practice and now it was time to show everyone how incredible we were at stage. We were behind curtains in the room that lead to the great hall, and I felt like I was going to vomit. My hands were cold and I could only think about all the ways I would mess up and everybody was going to see me failing.
Draco fell flush against the bed, his body sticky with his own come and slick. Harry fell over him, his body hot and sweaty, his cock still jerking inside Draco.
Draco came, his mind blank, only Harry’s voice guiding him through his orgasm. He came and came and then came again when he felt Harry come behind him, his insides warm up with hot jets of sperm.
“But this is a wedding bond... Like ours.” Hermione pointed to the image of the Weasley family, restored after Harry returned to live at the Black house. There was a golden braided thread, just like Harry and Draco's, between Ron and Hermione. “We need to want the bond so that it takes root, don't we?”
“More… More, Harry!” Draco pleaded, and Harry pressed a third finger in, observing Draco’s face, the pleasure he was feeling. Draco’s own cock was leaking precome, a line forming from his cock to Harry’s belly.
Flitwick asked him to stop, and all the people around me started clapping and catcalling. Potter looked like he was a bit embarrassed, and walked back to where Flitwick was. I just sat there, my mind going a mile per hour. I
“Remember when you talked about knowing where my family state was?” He asked, and I nodded. “Well, I talked to Ron and Hermione and we… Well, after the holidays, we would like to go looking for it. And since you know where it is, I was thinking… Maybe you could go with us?”
It was hard, to have all four of them at the same time. Draco was overwhelmed, trying to take care of all of them at the same time, but managed to be calmed down by Harry and the midwife, who stayed to help them with the early hours after the birth.
The narration flowed easily, each song getting into the other as the choir sang as one. We all danced and moved, and I felt alive. The sensation I had that I was part of something big was incredible, and it made me have purpose. I felt that I’ve lost it after the war. I didn’t know what to do, who I was or what I was supposed to do. Ron had Hermione, and he was already asked to work with George on the shop. Hermione had a few work options as well, and I had…
Draco was already very delicate when it came to his body. He had a small and soft cock, just like his balls, and his nipples were puffy, but not big enough to be called breasts (although Harry loved to call them titties when they played in the bedroom). He also had a low sperm production – tested before because, when he first had sex with Harry, he was surprised at the amount of come the other one could produce, and he wondered why he only could produce a little. The best quality though was that he didn’t need artificial lubricant. He could produce his own. According to the healer, he could expect an increase in it.
Draco moved his wand almost aggressively, and as the spell rounded around his middle, an explosion of colours merged in the original spell, showing off his womb like a moving picture.
“It was a joke, Harry. I’m not actually punching the guy,” he said, and he looked like the gears were turning in his head. I could actually imagine a lightbulb lightening in his brain. “He’s your mate.”
“Who runs away without their wands, Hermione? No, they were attacked and were probably captured. What confuses me is the bond... Could they have been forced?”
“Okay, but be careful. Put your arms like this,” Harry helped him with his arms position with one of his hands, and carefully put Aries on his brother’s arms, a careful hand under the baby’s head.
I stopped with my mouth open, and I could feel my whole body heat going up as I thought exactly how I would like to kiss Malfoy senseless.
“Why are you so prudish? You wouldn't think you've been at boarding school since you were eleven,” Draco asked one night, and Harry sputtered before he could say anything.
“Well, the good part about being a self-publishing writer is that I don’t need an office to work. I often do it in my bed between a cliché film or another.” Draco snuggled against Harry, happy and warm, despite the weather.
“Morning, Harry. Malfoy.” The redhead absently shook his head, shoving everything he could in between two slices of toast and biting into it.
“I didn’t make you… But you were made for me.” He whispered, and he didn’t let his baby out of his arms for a second, even after they signed all the papers and their new boy’s birth certificate.
I was shocked, and my surprise must’ve showed in my face, because he immediately started talking again.
Harry didn't need to hear it twice. He lowered his lips to kiss her, his hand tightening on her swollen breast. She spread her legs, opening the trousers she was wearing and pushing it down with some difficulty - she had lost weight during her time on the island, but the pregnancy was making her gain the weight back, making the trousers tight. Harry felt his entire body throb, as he would have the person he loved again after so long.
Roberto just nodded, not really answering. They all ate in silence, and Draco offered the extra room in the cabin so that Roberto could sleep, but the man denied it. He said he needed to think, so they left him by the fire.
Potter was exhilarated, his crush was kissing back! He got excited and pulled him so close that both of their bodies were fully touching now. Draco's lips followed Harry and let him take the lead.
"I'm fine, I was just spacing out." Ron chuckled and nodded. "I do that too sometimes mate, you aren't alone." Harry laughed at his friend and shook his head with a slight smile.
It was so random but Harry had a feeling Pansy was the one who initiated it and Draco just took that chance to spite Harry. Maybe Harry could confirm that Draco likes him.
He didn't know how Ron would react to him having a crush on Draco. I don't know if he would be surprised because Harry himself was a boy and evidently didn't like Draco one bit.
"No I can... you're pretty good at potions." Harry bit his lip and did not expect himself to say that. "Damn right I am." Draco gloatingly says with a small smirk. The two continued to walk as Harry spoke up. "I bet you'd hate to smirk." Draco rolls his eyes but drops the smirk on his lips. Draco shivered as the weather suddenly dropped and his limbs were now freezing. "I bet you'd hate giving me your sweatshirt." Draco was about to smirk, but then remembered he wasn't supposed to.
Harry noticed for the first time ever, Draco looked shy and was blushing furiously on top of that. This boy couldn't get any cuter to him. He finally had his first kiss and it was absolutely divine. It was not only divine because he did it with someone beautiful, but someone not expected. Draco felt the same way, he had no idea kissing felt that good. But he figured it mattered who you were kissing, and he assumed it would probably only feel this good with one person. There was only one person who had managed to make Draco's heart soar sky-high.
Harry smelt more like black tea and firewood, Draco literally fell in love with the scent. He could barely smell it on the sweatshirt, but now that he was chest to chest with Harry, the scent was as clear as day. Harry's arms touched Draco's legs and couldn't help but to think how soft they were. Like what did this boy use for lotion? They were really soft, like really soft. The first few times it was on accident, but then after the 3rd time it was on purpose, and he laid his arms on Draco's pale smooth legs. Harry thought his legs were way too soft and pretty to be out freely in weather like this.
Her voice was pure venom, and her face screamed hate. Harry's friends angrily snarled at her and glared at her. "Why don't you have anything better to do with your life, Parkinson?" Hermione harshly asked.
"Ha! Don't make me laugh! I do not in any way fancy you, Potter!" Draco states and narrows his eyes at Potter. Attempting to look intimidating, but instead looked quite cute to Harry.
Harry blinked at Draco and tilted his head. He wasn't stupid, he knew what Draco was about to say. But he wasn't gonna embarrass him since he felt the same way. He also didn't like girls, at least not in that way. Harry saw Draco shiver again, even with the sweatshirt on, and looked to be really suffering from those shorts on. His eyes landed on Dracos hairless slim legs that evidently didn't have any muscle. They actually looked quite fragile. As did his arms too.
He slowly wrapped his arms around Harry's shoulder and let Harry grip him tighter. Harry broke off the kiss and swore he fell in love. It was official. He was 100% in love with Draco Malfoy. His enemy.
Short black hair and narrowed eyes stared directly at him. She glared hardly at Harry and pushed him away. "Watch where you are going scar head. Wouldn't want to end up with another scar, would you now?"
"Well, maybe you shouldn't have been wandering the halls at night! And then I wouldn't have to tell Professor McGonagall anything!" Harry scoffed and grumbled. "You were also wandering the halls!" Draco stopped in his tracks. "Yeah well not for the same thing as you! You probably were off trying to risk your life like you always do! Adrenaline freak!" Professor McGonagall turned around sharply and scolded both of the boys in annoyance.
However, despite Draco's disbelief, he couldn't stop the smile that etched on his face. His fingers shook slightly but that wasn't unusual. Quite normal actually. Harry had such a big impact on him, and he kinda liked it.
bad at dueling." He quickly says and avoids Harry's eyes. Potter looked taken aback, as he did not expect Draco to actually compliment him. Draco looked up at him and smirked. "I bet you couldn't compliment me to save your life."
All while Harry was becoming all mushy with fondness, Draco still stood in the hallway with extremely flushed cheeks. He reached to touch his lips and could still feel Harry's lips on his. It was so weird, but the good kind.
He furrowed his brows at that and flinched when Ron nudged his side. "You alright mate? You've been staring at the Slytherin table for 5 minutes straight!" Harry shrugged and turned to him.
He noticed Draco's fidgety hands and how his eyes wouldn't stay on one thing for more than 3 seconds. Was he nervous? Why did he look so anxious? Was it because Harry was watching him?
The wind blew a little colder and so Draco brought his legs up to his chest and rubbed them as he leaned his head against a tree. He swore he was gonna get frostbite out there but there's nothing much he could do. "Say Malfoy..." Harry had a question that lingered on his mind for a while. Draco rolls his eyes instantly when he hears his voice but still responds. "What?" Harry thinks for a few more moments before asking, "Have you ever been kissed before?" He genuinely wanted to know if his enemy had his first kiss or not.
Harry wasn't dumb or oblivious when it came to people's feelings or actions. He realized Draco may only be bullying him because he has feelings for him, and he wouldn't be displeased if that was the case.
Ron has had a small crush on her for a while now, but he's only told, Harry. Harry 100% supported it. However, when Ron asked Harry if he had someone he liked, Harry lied and said no.
Harry has always thought Draco had a beautiful body. He can't see much of his body because it was always covered by robes and thick clothing. But the outline was enough to state that he had no average body.
"Anyway, I bet you can't say 'my name is Harry Potter' in French!" Harry thought for a good minute and groaned. "I don't even know French!" Draco snorted in a very un-Malfoy manner. "How don't you know how to speak French?! It's literally so easy!" Draco says with a small twinkle in his eyes that Harry catches. "Okay, then teach me how to say 'my name is Harry Potter'."
He always seems to want to prove himself and show off when he's around Harry. Whether he wants to prove that he's better than Harry or not, he still needs to impress Potter.
"No one asked you, Potter! So shut up!" Draco spat venomously at him, leaving no room for kindness anywhere. He turns to McGonagall and looks annoyedly at her as he taps his foot. "And how do you go about us only having the moon as our light source? And where do we even go to find the spring water?!" Draco had so many questions that weren't getting answered and his nerves were just growing by the second.
Harry swear he saw Draco roll his eyes the more Pansy continued to talk. This kind of made Harry happy that he was displaying such emotion towards this situation. It shows that he's displeased.
One, he's planning on something revengeful and nasty. Or two, he fancies Harry. Harry knew these two were very different and the second option was very far-fetched. However, he still thought it was possible.
Soon after Draco left the shelter. Harry gave him some mint leaves and water, and Draco thanked him with a nod. After the kiss, Harry supposed everything would be very strange between them, but the expectation of the journey into the unknown was more important than that.
Harry sat down again, putting a very happy Cygnus on his lap. He wasn’t struggling, but he wasn’t looking at the camera either. Scorpius, trying to be a good kid, smiled at his little brother.
“I don’t have anyone.” Harry was fast to reply. “I mean, now I have you. And I don’t want you to go either. You can write here, can’t you?”
They sat him down near where their old shelter was. The structure was still standing, even though many leaves that used to form the roof had been blown away by the wind or animals.
It was difficult for Harry to be strong, and he knew it was important for Draco not to see him fall apart. Harry let himself cry while taking a bath, when the water in the lake would be confused with his tears, and with his back to wherever Draco was. It was a silent cry, in which only his eyes let out his emotions, and then Harry took a deep breath to return to being the rock that he had to be in that relationship.
in that weather, especially when the strong winds began to soar and they felt cool despite the hot weather during the day.
states. Every pure-blood family has properties, and your family was once part of the Sacred 28, back when it had more than 28 families. I bet there’s a lot of family heirlooms and old family trees you can dig.”
On the next week, Harry and Draco started to look for orphanages and foster homes. It was extremely hard, especially for Harry, to see all those children that they couldn’t adopt because they couldn’t give the love they deserved, for all of them. They focused on getting one, that maybe looked a bit like them, so they could calm their hearts from the frustrating times of trying to have a child of their own.
“What are you talking about?” Hermione asked, looking a bit irritated. She hated when we knew something and she didn’t. Ron turned to her, over excited.
“I thought you were the straightest straight from the Ministry,” The Unspeakable's tone was light, as if there was a smile on his mouth. Harry turned to him, and realised that yes, he was laughing a little.
Potter looked at me as if he’d never had thought of that. His eyes were open wide like saucers, and I could almost hear his heart beating like crazy.
“Talitha... Yes, she looks like her name. But the next time we have a girl, we're going to use the Evans tradition, okay?” Harry said, and Dracy smiled along, leaning his head on Harry's shoulder as they both watched the little miracle that was their baby between them.
The third box, however, appeared to be filled with Roberto's own personal items. There were two knives, a lighter, some cigarettes and men's clothing. There was also a small collection of blankets and bedspreads, as well as a hammock for sleeping. Harry raised his eyebrows, smiling at Lucy.
They got into the house, and Draco noticed straight away that it was simply furnished. A man’s house through and through, with practical furniture and next to no decoration, with the exception of the roll of photos on top of the fireplace, which was lightened, warming the place nicely.
Draco got a half chewed sweet from the floor and smelt it, making a face and grabbing his wand to clean it all with a flick.
. I didn’t know if it was simply because he was getting too tall for his own body, or simply because you can’t expect a deer – or whatever animal he was – to dance. To be true, I couldn’t figure out what animal shifter he was yet, except it was big. Some people were more sensitive about it, but it wasn’t the norm.
“We got it right every day until today!” Harry said, glad they were so good at keeping their dates up to date. It was something they did so they wouldn't miss important dates like birthdays. They didn't want to lose that connection with the outside world. “We have a calendar rock. It is actually the side of a cave. The passage is too small for us to enter, but we use the side to note the days of the year. We forgot to write down the days of the week, so we don't have a lot of notion about that, but it's not as important as the actual days.”
“Potter, I’m so gay I can’t even think straight,” Draco joked, and Harry had to laugh at that, shaking his head. “You don’t mind, right?”
“Arsehole. It’s just I think Mrs Weasley would like us to be there on Christmas day… I figured even if I didn’t go, she’d like you two to be with her.”
He turned to Draco, his vision blurry and unfocused. He raised a hand to his face and noticed that he had lost his glasses. Wonderful.
It was a five minutes’ walk from his office to Draco’s, and Harry didn’t knock when he opened the door. He immediately regretted it. A cold wind blew his hair, making it even messier than before. Harry got into the office, shivering a bit while his mouth just fell open.
He put me in the middle of the bed, hovering over me, his knees between my parted thighs. He kissed my mouth, but it was tentative, not as aggressive as he was holding me. I kissed him back, trying to know my husband deeply. His tongue played with mine, and his hands explored my body, starting with my creamy white thighs, up to my hips, my waist, and up to my chest. He held my tiny, puffy breasts with both of his hands and pinched my nipples, making me scream.
The only chair available on the bass side was right beside me, and I pretended I didn’t see when Potter sat on it like he was hating every single second of being here.
I faded to sleep again, and he woke me up in the morning after with some water and grapes. I didn’t love him, not yet, and I knew he didn’t love me either. But fuck if it wasn’t going to be easy to fall in love with my husband.
He heard Draco about in the room, his honey smell making Harry’s cock harden further, and Harry got even angrier with himself for having the hots for Draco. He willed himself to sleep, but he couldn’t, especially when the curtains opened.
Eventually, the days got a little better. Draco was still introspective and silent, but there was a gleam in his eyes that had died before. He sought out Harry at night to sleep snugly, and wasn’t reluctant to eat or do his daily activities, which Harry thought was a victory. He still showed no interest in sex, and Harry continued to say nothing about it. He hoped that eventually Draco would go back to what he was, but Harry knew he needed time to think.
When Harry pressed the fourth finger, Draco howled in pleasure, his nails digging into Harry’s shoulders, his beautiful, long and hard cock leaking hard.
As Harry observed his babies, Aries started to fuss, and before he could wake his siblings, Harry took him in his arms and rocked him slightly. His eyes filled with tears as he tried to hold back his feelings.
Harry didn't resist. He held his hand close to his and sighed with relief as Draco squeezed his hand back. They stayed like that for a few minutes, seeking comfort in the mere presence of each other. Harry was the one who broke the silence again.
“That’s it, I'm here!” Harry said, and when the next contraction came, Harry brought his fingertips close to the opening, ready to help if Dracy needed it.
“Don't get me wrong... I love women. But... I like men too. I think both are extremely attractive. But I never tried with a wizard, just with muggles in bars. I wonder what it would be like,” Harry mumbled, and his body seemed lit, his heart beating a little faster without him really knowing why. Or maybe he knew
My face was on fire. I couldn’t speak. There was a lump in my throat, and he looked like he asked me if the ball was to my liking, smiling and waving to his people. I didn’t know what to say, but my body had other ideas. My cock was shamefully hard, and my hole was slicking so much I was sure my white clothes were absolutely ruined. Thankfully I was wearing way too many layers and I hope it didn’t show through.
Draco’s eyes went wide, and they carefully looked around, hyper-aware of their surroundings. The photographer had just put the camera in the middle of the living room, in front of where they were preparing to sit.
“Spit it out!” Draco tried to hold his cheeks as you would do to a dog that is chewing something they weren’t supposed to, but Harry moved his face, laughing.
Harry tightened his jaw, feeling a muscle swell as he did so. Without saying anything, he began to dig the grave in the farthest part of the clearing, far from the entrance they normally used. Lucy soon joined him, and together, after a few hours, they managed to dig a hole deep enough to bury Roberto. It was already mid-afternoon when they placed a stone on top of the closed grave, and Harry used his fire magic to write the name ROBERTO, JUNE 28 and a cross beside it.
“Don’t you have yourself on a pedestal? Is your sperm made out of gold?” Draco teased, and Harry laughed, finally slipping out of him.
“No... We don't have much to offer. But we are about to make our dinner. You are welcome to join us.” Draco, or Lucy, as Harry would probably have to call him for now, said.
It was something Draco cherished with all his heart, how dedicated Harry was to him. So when Harry said ‘Hm, so… I really would love to pretend I’m getting you pregnant while we fuck’, Draco was surprised. He thought Harry was going to say something related to Daddy and Baby because Draco surely saw Harry as a mighty fine Daddy, but that made him frown and say ‘what?’.
“Yes, I know that. I’m a freak.” Harry said, soaping his body with more strength than necessary, not turning to Draco at all.
Roberto's body was lying near one of those bushes. Lucy ran to him, bending down and checking his vital signs with her fingers on his neck. Then she put her ear to his chest, and tested his breathing again.
The world stopped for them, and they slept as they were, tucked against each other. The day had been emotionally hard for both of them, so they gave themselves a break.
“Of course you can do it, Harry!” Max’s smile was honest and broad. “I heard you singing it when we were preparing to leave last rehearsal.”
“The alternative is to live here forever, Potter. Of course I still want to... try,” Draco sniffed, putting a hand to his face and wiping it off. “But I'm scared, too. Terrified.”
. But it may be for you.” Harry said, biting his lower lip and trying not to get his hopes up, but it was happening anyway. “I think you’re pregnant.”
"Hence, I'll do the learning and you'll go by." Draco teased back, and Harry couldn't help but laugh.
“Using only your hands. Relax. We don't need to be in a hurry. Go bathe and then we'll have some eggs. I found an abandoned nest and I'm really missing something other than fish.” Draco said, and Harry laughed, starting to take off his pants and head for the pond in the middle of the clearing.
it had happened wasn't really clear. As soon as Lucius had recovered from his treatment he had left Hogwarts, and so far as Harry was aware he had refused to answer any questions on the other prophecy, which apparently included Iana of all people.
The look of irritation on Snape's face was one with which Harry was pretty familiar, but had never seen directed at Malfoy. "I believe I made myself clear?"
After a few minutes, Harry's own curiosity got the better of him. "What about you?" he asked. He pointed at her book. "That's not got much to do with magic. What are you looking for?"
"Perhaps it would be best if I started from the beginning," said Dumbledore, tapping his chin. "Very well. The story begins, I think, in the Hog's Head, on a cold night seventeen years ago. I was interviewing a young witch for the post of Divination Teacher, a post I confess I had previously been resolved to leaving unfilled."
