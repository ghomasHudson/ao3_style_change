an older ship, but I like the feeling of manual control anyways. Like Hedwig and I are a team.
“Fuck me,” Draco says, his words coming out much more desparate than he intends. “Potter, you better
“Hi, Pepper,” Draco is saying, his voice rounded and sweet in a way Harry has never heard. “How are you? How was your day?” A long silence, then– “I hear you, I hear you. That sounds like very important cat business.” His voice trails off into unintelligible, soft murmurs.
“What do you want?” Harry repeats, crowding even closer until Draco is shaking. “God, you bastard. I can’t… Draco, what do you want?”
“And don’t bother coming back, if you– just don’t,” Harry says, one shoulder jerking up in a charade of nonchalance. “I thought maybe we… I thought maybe one day, you could want me. But it’s– fine.”
“I thought, since we have our own place…” Draco trails off, then sits down on the ugly plaid sofa next to Harry, pressing their thighs together.
Fingers digging into Draco’s waist, Harry kisses him, fierce and tender all at once, and Draco wants to cry.
“Come here!” Draco calls, so Harry does.
Harry reaches out slowly, his chest twinging when Draco flinches again. The bite mark on Draco’s shoulder is already turning a vivid purple, and Harry swipes his thumb across the bead of blood welling there. Draco holds himself still, but winces when Harry touches the marks on his neck.
“How was your day at work?” Harry asks, then snorts as Draco immediately throws his head back and groans. “That bad?”
Harry’s face goes slack, like he’s been slapped. “Draco–”
“Let’s go home,” Harry interrupts, pressing a kiss to Draco’s temple. “We’ll figure it out at home, love.”
“You didn’t have to make me breakfast,” Draco replies, immediately wincing at his blunt tone. He used to be better about tempering his thoughts, his words, but he simply doesn’t have the
The fourth time, Draco is asleep and doesn’t hear the door, and by the time he comes down Harry is sobbing in pain and there’s blood dripping out of his ears, and once Draco heals him he has to hold Harry tightly in his arms until he can stop himself from shaking.
“Told you you’d want your seatbelt. First time warping is always rough.”
I’m– I’m– you’re the fucking ex-Death Eater. I’m not like you.”
“You said you love me.”
feel like home,” Draco says again, his eyes bright as he crooks a smile at Harry. “I really didn’t know. That you felt the same.”
“You make me feel so good, Harry,” Draco continues, and Harry’s whole body shudders. “Did you know that? You make me feel so safe as I come apart.”
“What?” Harry asks, suddenly breathless. Malfoy cocks an eyebrow, a ghost of her old self.
on Draco’s cock with Draco’s fingers still wrapped around his wrist, guiding him roughly. Harry twists his hand viciously around the head, and even with the mess of precome there he can tell it’s too dry, and Draco yells, a strangled sound that stops abruptly when he throws his head back.
“No,” Harry says, gently arranging Draco and sliding a pillow under his hips. “No, I took you home because you’re pretty.”
– I want to go down on you, I want to wrap my mouth around your cock and–
“Are we girlfriends now?” Harry whispers, trying not to sound too giddy. Draco has been something unreachable for so long, for so many reasons, and now she’s here, safe in Harry’s arms.
“Whoa,” he whispers, awed, and Harry grins back at him. “We did that with our bodies.”
I wake up for the seventh morning in a row with Draco’s hair in my mouth.
Harry briefly ventures out of Draco’s flat in the morning, returning with croissants and Hermione.
“Maybe,” Harry says with a grin. His shirt is rucked up around his hips and his jean flies are open, revealing tight black pants. “Wrists, please.” Draco complies, flexing his wrists slightly just to test the sensation as Harry guides his hands onto the pillow above his head. “Keep those there.”
“I already saw it,” Draco says, trying to keep frustration from coming through in his tone. “Please. I can’t– Harry. It hurts me to see you hurt.”
Draco nods silently, reaching out with both of his shaking hands to grab Harry’s. His palms are smooth and cool, and the base of his nails are rose pink.
Draco comes so hard he sees stars, and Harry pounds into him through it until he shudders and stills, pressing sloppy kisses to the knobs of Draco’s spine.
“Draco, I want to stop pretending,” Harry says, and Draco steps back again, jerkier this time, trying to breathe through the ache in his chest. Setting his jaw, Harry follows, reaching across the space between them, and Draco freezes. Harry’s hand on Draco’s waist is intimately familiar, but the burning light in his eyes is not. “I want to

“You sent up a distress beacon in one of the most dangerous quadrants of this system. You’re lucky it was me and not pirates.”

“No.” Smiling crookedly, Draco glances up to the ceiling. “I’m dying.”

Draco gasps, gesturing wildly and nearly knocking over his drink until he can find words again. “I’m not

“Skipping the foreplay?” I tease, but nod down at him anyways, and I can’t help the gasp that falls from my mouth when he lightly trails his fingertips over the head of my cock. He wraps his other hand around the loose harness, tugging me closer.
There’s a
Harry stretches his toes out, shivering a little at the sweet ache underneath his skin. The rope around his wrist pulls slightly, keeping his arms above his head. Draco’s hands never stray from him, tracing out random patterns through Harry’s leg hair. For a moment, Harry feels rather enraptured with this. How lucky he must be, to have Draco stay with him.
“Hello, listen, I’m rather unsure of what I’m doing and–”
“I want to be tied down and also spanked across your knees,” Draco says, barely catching himself from falling forward as the door is wrenched open.
“Choose a toy, then.” I nudge his hands away and strip my shirt off, clambering back onto the bed fully naked except for the harness. Draco skates his fingers over the three toys in the box, finally pulling out the thinnest but longest one. It sparkles blue and purple against his palm, and his eyes crinkle up in the corners with the force of his smile.
There’s a soft knock on her door.
“I’m sorry I’m on top of you.” Harry rolls away to face the ceiling, leaving one hand on the back of Draco’s neck, smushed against the pillow. “I just– fuck. Sorry.”
me to be–”
“Yes,” Draco murmurs. “Yes, yes.”
“We’ll need an objective measurement,” Harry says, popping his head up to meet Draco’s gaze, matching the competitiveness and exhilaration he finds there.
. There’s still room for Harry to pull and be safe, but he lets the chain slide loose, just a bit. “I don’t think that’s where you want me to fuck you.”
“Oh.” Draco’s lips are pink, fallen open in an
Harry snorts. “Tenacious is a good word for it.”
With a jolt I realize I’ve been babbling this whole time, nonsense sentences strung together with
“I can’t thank you enough for this, I’m going to get out of your hair now, since it’s late.” Harry stands up and Draco jumps up too, holding his arms out instinctively, but Harry doesn’t so much as wobble. Before Draco can protest, Harry is gone, and Draco slumps down into his chair, beginning to tremble with leftover adrenaline. All he can see is a loop of Harry’s face: slack in unconsciousness, strangely flat when he avoided Draco’s questions, crumpling at the insinuation that they aren’t friends. Even once in bed, Draco lies awake, absentmindedly trailing his fingers along the scars on his chest, finally stumbling upon the question that seems most urgent.
, and it’s so good. It’s so good.
“Harry,” Draco says softly. “May I…”
“What?”
. Why can’t you go to St. Mungo’s?”
Draco manages a content hum, and burrows further under Harry’s arm. Warm air stirs through his hair, a sign of Harry’s breathless, happiest laugh.
“You’re wearing my skin.” Flat. The walls, your voice, the air. Flat.
Later, after a long chastising from St. Mungo’s officials for performing unregulated healing magic in an empty field in the dead of winter, Hermione tries to explain to Harry what happened.
Pepper chirps from underneath the kitchen chair, and Harry scoops a hand down to bring her into his lap. Her small body fits easily on his thighs, and he scratches absentmindedly through her spotted fur.
“Harry?” Draco says, his voice firmer than before. Concern ripples through his mind, and he starts to sit up before he feels the weight of Harry’s gaze, and
“I want to try,” Harry murmurs. His voice is a deep rumble in his chest, and Draco presses his cheek against Harry’s skin, feeling sleepy and content all of a sudden. Harry’s breath is warm against the top of Draco’s head, and then there’s kisses pressed there, butterfly-light.
“I don’t– I–” Draco is frozen, his words seemingly caught in his throat.

without you.”
“Of me?” Harry asks, tucking his knees up to his chest. Draco mirrors him, and their feet overlap.
“I dreamt of you every night, since the day you told me. I couldn’t… I don’t know what it is about you, Draco, but I just…” Harry runs both of his hands through his hair in agitation. “Will it take you a while to fully recover?”
“I hate you,” Draco says without conviction.
,” Harry says resolutely. He presses a sweet kiss to Draco’s cheek, and in the warmth of his soft lips Draco feels the truth behind both of their words.
“Yeah?” Draco replies, too turned on to parse the question until Harry holds out a palm and a mid-size blue dildo smacks into his hand, along with a soft leather harness.
man. I want you so bad. I want you so
“But you need to work on your jokes,” he says, softening his words with a wry smile. Draco cuffs him on the shoulder with a put-upon huff, yet when he kisses Harry it’s slow and deep– a promise.
“Here, let me,” Harry murmurs, right behind Draco now. Draco drops his hands and lets Harry spin him around, his dark fingers stark against the white of Draco’s shirt as he finishes undoing the buttons. He efficiently strips Draco of his trousers and pants, then does the same for himself. They could do this partially clothed, Draco knows; the bond doesn’t care how they have sex, as long as they do. But Harry has proven to be a gentleman, insisting they take their time, always tender with Draco yet blind to the way he makes Draco’s heart come undone.

“I know the bond wasn’t what either of us wanted.” Draco is talking in a rush, as though he’s been holding all these words right behind his teeth for weeks. “I know it isn’t easy, I know I’m not easy to be around, but I don’t have anything to go back to. You– you–” Draco laughs humorlessly, tilting his head back. “You’re impossible not to like, did you know?” At Harry’s silence, Draco keeps talking. “You said you would take care of me, and you did. You still are. I thought…”
“Yeah?” He’s already breathless, and I smile against his skin. The barest scratch of stubble rubs against my lip and I kiss his jaw again. “You’re gonna be good for me, pet? What do you want to do?”

me to take you, to claim your pretty arse.” Draco kicks his feet as much as he can and lands a blow to Harry’s ribs that leaves Harry panting with the pain and frantically turned on. He slams two fingers into Draco and fists the other in Draco’s hair, flipping him onto his stomach. Draco sinks his teeth into Harry’s arm, making Harry crook his fingers painfully hard inside Draco.
“Draco,” Harry says, punched out and raw, and then they’re kissing again, their bodies slotting together, heat to heat, heart to heart. Harry’s hands are wrapped around Draco’s hips, tugging him closer, insistent,
“Comfort movie or something new?” Harry squeezes Draco’s hands back, thinking about how he should’ve known he liked Draco by the fact that he can list all of Draco’s comfort movies without a second thought. “I just got
“I’m going to start heading back now, okay? Do you think you’ll be able to fall asleep at home?”
“Rothwell asked me to interview a Quidditch player over lunch this weekend and I just said no. I just said no!” Draco laughs, a bit breathless. “I said ‘Sorry I can’t, I’m not scheduled to work on the weekends, but I’ll certainly get you the article on the Werewolf Rights Commission by Friday afternoon.’ And do you know what she said?”
Good grief, he was going to do this, wasn’t he. He was going to confess all his sexual woes to Draco Malfoy, former schoolyard nemesis and current purveyor of sex toys. He had to, really. He needed some help.
“Equal second,” Draco interrupted. “I don’t report to you.”
Oh. Malfoy’s
“So,” Malfoy said again. “I’m no expert on your life, Potter, but I’d reckon you’ve dealt with some stressful things in your time. Saviour, Auror, all that. Why has this case gotten under your skin?”
. Him, Draco Malfoy, the one who betrayed Dumbledore and nearly cost them all their lives - the traitor, as they called him in public, and as Draco called himself in private. Potter hadn't
Malfoy stood there for a beat, and just looked at him. “The Centaurs Arms,” he said eventually, and returned back to his desk. Harry watched him complete a series of charms to clean and press his uniform robes, then hang them carefully on his coat hook, and then pick up the satchel ready to leave. “You ready?”
"One lump, or two?"
Granger must have made her decision, because an elf in a tuxedo appeared silently by the table, and placed a glass of something red beside her. Draco didn’t look at it too long. The colour made his chest ache.
Potter stared at him unblinkingly.
Malfoy nodded seriously. “Who would dare use a misdirection charm on a Muggle, in a Muggle venue? In front of a senior member of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” His expression was one of perfect innocence, and if it had been anybody else Harry might even have believed it. “Nobody I know, certainly.”
“But can’t you ask your boss to let you have the weekend off?” Teddy’s hair faded from plankton blue, to a familiar white blond. Draco felt like arsehole of the year, which he probably was, at this point, considering nearly all the old Death Eaters were gone. “What if we called Uncle Harry and got him to change it? He’s one of the bosses, isn’t he? He could make them give you a day off!”
off me.”
Naturally, that’s when Longbottom and his gang came in. Naturally, that included Potter.
Malfoy had found the pasta salad, and set it out on the kitchen table with Harry’s plates and cutlery, and a breadboard with something enormous and delicious looking on it.
Draco was flustered. “You’re a wanker.”
Okay, but was Malfoy
“Oi, Potter - I know I said there’s no rush, but that was before you decided to stand at the top of the stairs for the rest of your life. You’re aware this is not an escalator, aren’t you? Potter?”
He straightened his posture, watching his muscles move as he raised one hand to his hair. He ran a hand through it, pulled it slightly - he liked that, he likes the way it feels to have someone's fingers sifting through, and then a sharp tug. Likes that it's long enough, and thick enough, to lose a hand in. He could do with a bit of hair pulling in his life. He reckoned Malfoy might enjoy doing the pulling.
Well. It was often
Hermione blinked several times, looking between them. “Well, I suppose it was my own fault for asking.”
“As soon as you start calling me Harry.”
that meant kisses, or being in knots inside and feeling utterly sick, or barricading himself in his borrowed bedroom.
“Verity Parsnip.” Draco recognised her from the personnel file, and quickly disarmed her as she started and dropped her wand.
The response came nearly immediately.
, he tried to reassure himself, over chronic Draco-pangs.
“Draco Malfoy,” Ron said, sounding exactly like the host of the worst sort of game show. “Shag, marry, kill!”
“So,” Malfoy said eventually. “Things got a bit weird in there, Potter. I’d go so far as to say you had a bit of a turn.”
“Wand, penis, just grab something and

. Could he trust Malfoy now?
She smiled at him, her eyes warm. “You have mayonnaise on your chin, you mucky boy.”
“Exactly,” Harry said again. “What do you make of this, though? I have some thoughts, but I’d like a second opinion, if you wouldn’t mind.”
Malfoy brandished a fork at him. “Don’t think I won’t still kill you, Weasley.”
“I’m doing nothing of the sort, Weasley. I did exactly what I was asked to do.”
He shrugged. “Dust, mould...traces of hippogriff, probably.”
"Mmm, you must have read my mind. And cake! Yummy!"
“Unfair,” Draco narrowed his eyes. “Why does he get kisses and coffee, and I get juice and insults?”
Draco muttered something under his breath about ‘organised’, and snorted. “Well. We needed seven rooms, and three of them are basically done. We’re practically halfway there.”
“Oh,” Draco blinked. “Okay. I’m always up for trying new things.”
“Wouldn't say I’m a civilian,” Potter interrupted.
The question was so unexpected that Draco almost didn’t understand. He laughed, breathless and delirious. Potter was jacking him roughly. “The only cock Blaise is interested in is his own.”
,” Harry said. “I just think there’s a lot about you to be celebrated, so we should be doing that.”
“Is that what I was doing?” He tried for innocence.
“Massage. I’m starting to wonder if your ears were painted on, Malfoy.”
“I did tell him. I always do. I’ll tell him again on Monday.” Harry frowned. “Why does he always have to pick on you like that?”
Bog’s eyes betrayed nothing. “Message for Auror Malfoy.”
Potter was a bit pink. “Uh, yeah. Like-”
Ron’s eyes widened. “Fuck! Yes – Hermione’s birthday. I need gift help.”
fucking-” Malfoy flipped the phone open and frowned again, before answering. “Auntie? What’s wrong?”
A bartender pushed a tall glass of something green across the bar to Potter, with a bemused smirk. “From a fan.” The twink looked like he might have a stroke at any second, and Potter raised the glass in acknowledgement. The kids' eyes went huge. Draco cast a discreet spell on the drink to confirm it hadn’t been spiked with anything.
. I hate to burst your bubble-”
? You say we're friends, but we aren't - we hardly say a word to each other. We just live here together, and I don't
“She’s a girl,” Teddy rolled his eyes, as if Draco were rather dull. “And it’s vulgar.”
Draco fiddled with his bottle of water. “Anything that allegedly happened between me and Potter is no one else’s concern.”
“Fuck,” he said under his breath, trying not to breathe in the combined pong of droppings and sweat too deeply. If the owls were gone, wizarding government was about to grind to a slow but certain halt. No wonder he’d been called in. This needed to be sorted quickly.
He could feel the pounding of Malfoy's pulse under his fingertips. They didn't speak for several minutes, the silence stretching out between them.
Hermione cringed, looking terribly guilty. “Oh dear. Harry. Are you alright?”
“Won’t,” Harry said, hardly able to bear pulling his mouth from Draco’s skin even long enough to reply. He wrangled Draco’s underwear off at last, pushed his legs apart, and brushed his mouth across the sticky head of his cock.
“Yeah,
“Dickinson, you’re in charge of cream buns. Nothing with coconut, or orange rind. Jam is fine, with or without icing, but if you go
“Are you ready?”
Potter looked pleased. “But you hate cricket.”
“Sorry,” Harry said, not very sorry at all. “Maybe being harassed by my friends makes it hard to play a game of strategy!” He took another long gulp of his punch, and felt sweat prickle on the nape of his neck. The Muggle pub was free of wizarding reporters and gawking wix, but it was also sadly absent of cooling charms.
When he did lift his eyes from the glass to Malfoy, he looked completely neutral. And the bastard continued to wait, silently. Harry sighed. “She was really good about it. Amazing, really. At first it was just talk, you know. Pillow talk, like.” Christ and Hades. He didn’t dare look at Malfoy now. “When we were in bed she used to whisper things to me, and it would have me in pieces. And eventually that became, um. Touching.” He coughed. “Fingering when she went down on me, that sort of thing. Once she had her fingers in me, and she suggested we brew some Polyjuice so she could fuck me properly next time.” Harry huffed a wry laugh. “I came so hard I thought I’d gone blind.”
"You shouldn't have. You aren't supposed to. We could get into trouble."
“But she is the brightest witch of our cohort. Shouldn’t she have been able to master this too?”
Malfoy smiled, still looking away. Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off him. “I want to keep it. And your respect. All the good things. I want them to stay. I couldn’t do without them again, I think. I’m grateful for our friendship. Maybe I haven’t said, but you’re one of the most important people in my life, Harry.”
“Don’t talk about you and Hermione splitting up,” Harry said with alarm. “You’re the only parents I’ve ever known!”
"…actually kind of thirsty, now that you ask…"
He sighed heavily, louder than he had intended, and far more dramatic-sounding. Dawlish appraised him, and his gruff voice was gravelly in Harry's ear.
Draco stared at him. “Finnegan? What does Finnegan have to do with what I’m wearing?” Was everyone fucking insane?
Draco had never said no. Even once. He was like a very stupid moth, coming back for more despite being scorched alive every time. They bit, and pulled, and fucked each other, but Draco never stayed the night, and Potter never acknowledged it in the day.
"Vicky!" Harry said grumpily, stomping out of the lab and slamming the door shut behind him. He very nearly threw the dissection report across the tiny foyer and out into the Level Two corridor, but managed to hold onto the rapidly scrunching parchment with the last of his forbearance. "I need some time to think about this case. Can you please hold my owls for the rest of the afternoon, and I don't want to be disturbed unless it's the Minister." He paused at his office door. "Actually, I have an appointment at a quarter to five, so please let me know when he's arrived. But other than that, I'm bloody offline!"
“You – in the shirt,” Draco snapped his fingers and a passing server stopped in his tracks. “I need you to do two things immediately. Firstly, go over to the buffet table and make sure that drunken fool in the orange robes does
“I find that offensive,” Draco said, and Weasley laughed again.
“I suppose that qualifies you for,” Harry paused for dramatic effect. “Not-Mousse, with raspberry sauce.”
By the time the briefing with Ron was scheduled, Harry had made far less progress than he had hoped for. The cuttings had not sprouted. The various samples had mainly showed only what Harry supposed they ought: that they were made from polyvinyl chloride and bore the hallmarks of some sort of magical intervention, although what that was specifically was still unclear. The objects themselves had not been manufactured with it – they were definitely Muggle, down to the slight ridges from the original mould along the length of it. The spellwork was very subtle and would need further investigation, which was the most disappointing part for Harry, as he’d be fervently hoping it would turn out to be something obvious and easily identifiable, so he could skip straight on to the tracking.
“You’re my slag,” Harry cuddled into Draco, causing him to yelp and nearly spill the water himself. “You’re my handsome Slytherin tart. King of sexiness and being a smart-mouthed prick.”
“Ow,” Harry said, a bit more awake now, and starting to get annoyed. He found his glasses and shoved them on. Malfoy’s nearly bare body came into better focus, which didn’t help Harry keep track of the conversation any better. “Who woke you up?”
"I don't
Neither of them looked sure, but Slytherin’s didn’t cajole, at least not each other, and Draco moved across the crowd towards the rear exit. There was no fucking way he was passing by that bar, again. He caught sight of Pansy and Longbottom, the latter’s mouth shiny with what appeared to be cherry lip gloss, and they’d both seen him as well. They wore twin looks of concern, so Draco gave them his best smile, and then put his head down and pushed on.
He couldn’t really spend the whole day getting off with himself. For a start, he wasn’t actually fourteen and he was probably going to start finding it difficult to get, well, hard. And sore. He thought he would probably start feeling quite sore soon. No, no more wanking today. Four times was quite enough. He pushed himself away from the sink and strode with purpose to his bedroom, determinedly not covering up his bits this time, or thinking about the soft weight of his cock against his thighs.
“A considerate person would piss against the porcelain, not directly down into the water like a fucking animal.”
“The rest is easy. Marry my best friend, Mr Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Boy Who Lived, et cetera, because people already think we’re a throuple, so why not make it official. And kill - myself, obviously, as I’ll have recently got off with Anders, and between the flashbacks and my wife, I’ll be better off dead.” Ron took a swig of his beer and looked very proud of himself. “Now, are we going clockwise, or playing by Weasley rules?”
,” Draco said, parroting Potter’s favourite word. “I’m on leave.”
Draco looked up, and went a bit pink. “As many as you like. Brie will need at least one playmate, surely?”
"Draco!" he shouted, curtains forgotten, neighbors forgotten, pack dropped heavily to the floor and kicked out of the way. "I'm home!"
"It's going to work out, Malfoy. I'll make sure that it does."
“How hard?” Harry said petulantly, and Draco looked down at him with fond annoyance.
been one of Harry’s turn ons?
The third week, Ron brought a deck of cards, and they tried to teach Malfoy and Pereira how to play Oh Hell, which Ron promised would be much easier than Five Hundred. It was not. Harry had rarely laughed so much.
“What happened?”
Draco’s eyes drifted involuntarily over to where Potter was sitting with Weasley’s own wife, a heavy-duty Privacy Charm thick around them. He let his eyes slide past them to the bain marie, reluctantly, and considered his options. “Rendang and coconut rice, with a roti.” When Draco looked back at him, Weasley had a knowing smirk on his face, and Draco felt a bit hot.
Draco paused, then replied. “Well, I think he was just surprised to see me, and I’m wearing the Slytherin colours today, so...maybe I just provoked a little bit of our old rivalry. Nothing for you to worry about, my darling,” Draco crouched in front of Teddy, and pushed back his fringe. “I mean it.” Draco twisted and pointed up to the stands. “I’m going to be right up there all day.”
It would be much worse, later. When he’d experienced being in a relationship with Potter, and having him leave, move on to someone else, and always having the reminder of him through Teddy.
Bog shrugged. “Bog doesn't know such things as why Bog is. Bog was just Bog, when there wasn’t Bog before.”
. They'll probably give you another Order of Merlin for your contribution to society. Hell, they'll probably give you twelve!"
“Was it this?” Draco reached one hand out, and ran his fingertips softly, so softly, over Harry’s collarbone. “Was it
There was a long pause. A whistle shrieked on the field, someone had caught the Snitch in record time and the first round was over. Draco felt shaky and embarrassed.
Potter opened his mouth. “Good. If you’re having difficulty preparing, let me know. You have two hours – I’ll see you all in the board room at nine o’clock on the dot.”
“Good,” Harry said roughly. “They were going to find out anyway when we lodge our paperwork, anyway.” He tightened his arms, and kissed Draco on the shoulder. “Alright?”
“This is a mistake,” Pansy said on a sigh, and poked at a bloated lychee floating in her cocktail until it began to disintegrate.
Harry felt the blood drain rapidly from his face, only to come roaring back seconds later, with force. Of course Draco Malfoy would be the attendant of the only sex shop he’d ever set foot in.
This time was after a field assignment that had gone completely shit shaped. Being in Potions, his fieldwork was very rarely dangerous, these days, but Draco was still as well trained and deadly as any other Auror in the Corps. It had only been two years since he’d transferred from Field, anyway, and so when a routine collection of samples from a crime scene, which had apparently been secured earlier in the day, turned abruptly into a wandfight, he’d been able to hold his own. He’d been squatting, examining a spill of something thick and iridescent, with Weasley hunched beside him, and the crackle of magic had him looking sharply up as a hex rocketed past him and caught Weasley in the chest. He went down with a thump, and Draco managed a Shield charm and a healing stabiliser in rapid order, before he got his Patronus off to Robards, and focussed on defending himself from an onslaught of curses.

“Yeah, but it feels– like I should ask.”
Draco hums tiredly. “As long as you want to stay, Harry, I’ll be right here.”
“I cannot
“Apparition sucks after an international Portkey.” Harry keeps his eyes on the pools of streetlight splashed across the dark road; if he looks over towards Draco the terrifying knot of his feelings will overwhelm him.
“You like when I’m a little mean.”
“Hmm. You’re not doing a very good job showing me you aren’t.”
Harry blinks, nonplussed. “What?”
.” Draco swallows hard, allowing Harry to place his hands on Draco’s slim shoulders, holding onto him. “I had to leave before you did.”
“You’re alright.” Harry holds himself still, waiting for Draco to adjust. This isn’t new either, the gentle murmurs, the soothing tone. Like Harry is apologizing with every word. “You’re alright.”
Harry shifts, biting back a moan as Draco clenches around his cock. He stills as Draco cuts him a look, their eyes narrowing.
“Hedwig,” I bite out, “get us back up to half-warp, and on course to Catchpole.” This is not a quadrant where ships stop, not unless they want to be quickly and easily cleaned out by pirates. I’d rather avoid that today.
“Yeah,” Harry says, grinning as he’s jostled by Draco’s arm over his shoulders. “Why?”
“Medium,” Draco says, because he doesn’t want too much pain today, but he also doesn’t want only softness. “But I want you to

like you.”
“Fine,” Draco says with a sniff. Her hands find Harry’s, tangling their fingers together.
He stills at that, his entire body shuddering as his glamours drop. It’s with his own big green eyes that he starts crying, struggling to breathe under your palm. Fuck. Take your hand away. Smooth down his hair. Shush him softly, tenderly.
“Let me–” Harry starts to bend down, but Draco flinches violently and Harry freezes.
Draco looks at Harry out of the corner of her eye. “It looks bad. I messed up the ends.”
“Tap my thigh if you need me to get up,” I say breathlessly, bracing my forearm against the wall and resting my forehead on it. Furrowing his brows, Draco hollows out his cheeks as if I’d issued him a challenge, and I try to drag in air. What does he like? Praise, praise he likes–
“I’m going to keep looking at these,” Draco says. Tender fingers comb through Harry’s curls, then disappear as paper rustles. Draco’s cock is swelling, working its way to hardness, but Harry ignores it for now, knowing Draco will do the same. Long fingers settle in his hair again, massaging Harry’s scalp, and Draco exhales softly. “Thank you, love.”
Finally, Draco presses fully against me, nuzzling his nose into the hollow of my throat. “I’m counting on that. Are you sure we have to get up?”
“Okay,” he whispers, and I feel his hand travel up from my arm to my shoulder to my neck, searching in the dark. His fingers reach my jaw, then my mouth, pressing down lightly. “May I…?”

“It’s not that, just–” I sniff again, but the tears are already escaping the corners of my eye. “I’m just really– oh, I
“Harry.” Draco reaches across the table and touches Harry’s fingertips. The base of his nails are turning purple-black, and Harry wants to throw his soup across the room. “If anyone can do it, it’s you. I just stopped letting myself hope a long time ago.”
“Oh, I’ve tried,” he replies, picking up the end of my trailing question. “You can’t really get leverage though, and like, when you turn the grav back on, it’s just, the come kinda goes... everywhere. So really, really not worth it.”
Draco wakes up disoriented and gasping and ice cold. There’s a weight on top of him, pinning him down; he thrashes, frantic, until he understands Harry’s hands on his skin and Harry’s soft voice in his ear.

it, and yet here is Harry, sitting on Draco’s couch and looking like a kicked puppy.
“Wanna sleep, please,” Draco says muzzily. Harry snorts, then presses a kiss to the top of Draco’s head. Their hair is everywhere, silky-smooth across Harry’s shoulder and neck. Harry wandlessly cleans them up; it’s not perfect, but he can get Draco into the bath tomorrow.
“A tie means we need a tiebreaker,” Draco says, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s soft cock before he blinks and pulls the comforter over himself, burrowing down into it. Harry taps the end of the biro against the notebook on his thigh with a frown. “We need another sex act to do.”
“Ah,” Draco says into Harry’s shoulder with a wry little laugh. “You do, more than you think.”

“Darling?” Draco says, and his hands come up to Harry’s hips now. His voice has a new quality to it, and Harry closes his eyes again. “Darling,” Draco repeats. “You’re shaking. Shh. I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Hello, Brennan.” Draco continues to scrape the edge of the key to his flat– the key to

“I’m not trying to–”
Harry’s eyes are dark, lit only by the crackle of the fire at Draco’s back.
“And you know this because…?”
They’ve slept in the same bed since Nashville, when Harry stormed out of the room without thinking and Draco blacked out; Harry couldn’t stop crying when Draco came to. With his arms wrapped around Draco to stop his shaking, any lingering anger melted into reluctant relief that he wasn’t alone.
and lifts himself up, leaving Draco aching for friction. He shifts until he’s straddling Draco’s waist, purposefully avoiding brushing against Draco’s cock. Harry’s own cock is flushed and hard, nestled within the black curls between his legs, and Draco wants so desperately to taste him. Harry’s so slick already– Draco can feel it on his stomach. He shifts slightly, pushing his wrists up against Harry’s grip to no avail.
“Hey.” Harry hovers in the doorway, unsure whether to move further into the room or not. Usually Draco is already shrugging off his shirt by now, but he just sits, looking at his hands. Harry moves to sit beside him, leaving a small bit of space in between their bodies that feels palpable. The itch underneath his skin settles to a low buzz.

“I know. I know. Hot and cold.” Harry kisses down Draco’s neck to his pulse point. “Have you thought about that? It’s a little bit symbolic, don’t you think?”
“Draco...“ Harry says, clearly swayed by the sheer pleading in Draco’s voice. “I have to– I need to fix–”
“Will it be a problem that I’m a wanted man?”
“Yes, that would be… distasteful.”
Harry smacks Draco’s arse, quick and light; Draco jerks and drops his face down onto the pillow. “Brat,” Harry tells him again, unreasonably fond, and Draco just laughs, so joyfully bright even muffled by the sheets.
“You’re gagging for it,” he says quietly, reverently. Draco squirms underneath the scrutiny of Harry’s gaze; there’s nearly too much adoration for him to handle, right now.
With a huff, Draco slides his socked feet around on the carpet too, and they shuffle around in a strange little dance. The crisp winter air nearly crackles around Harry’s hair.
Draco snorts. “
in his head like a lifeline.
“Do you remember the first week of the bond?” Harry asks, pitching his voice a bit lower, trying to sooth Draco. “When we had to be together all the time, and even though we had already made our peace with each other before, it was going terribly. But then you snapped something like, ‘at this point only one of us is making it out of this week alive and it
“Mhm,” Draco says, because he’s willing to try. His hands are shaking with long-suppressed affectation, and it makes him want to try. “I really do.”
“Do you still want the spell on your cock?
“Yes.”
“Wait,” Draco whispers, the pain sharper than pleasure for a moment, and Harry freezes immediately. He’s at the right angle to lay a kiss to Draco’s collarbone and he does, over and over again, humming softly when Draco buries his free hand in his dark curls.
“What do we

, letting himself be held in Harry’s arms.
, Draco. Not just a place you sleep. And no one can take this away from you, you know?”
“Old men get the floor,” he says, and promptly flops face down onto the bed, and suddenly I feel like crying. Not because of Harry taking the bed; honestly, it really is his right. I just can’t help being difficult; it’s a flaw I’m fully aware of. But everything seems so overwhelming all of a sudden, my chest tight with things I didn’t let myself feel in the panic of existence on the Silver Swan. Sadness, anger. Fear. Homesickness for a home that was never my own.

“Maybe it’s the possibility of love, I’m not sure. But whatever it was you burned the curse right out of his veins. There isn’t a trace of it left. What were you thinking about, when you let go?”
“There you go,” Harry says when he’s smoothed the potion across the entire bruise. His instinct is to say something light, to make Draco smile for real, but he finds he can’t fathom how to do that. It’s as though something fundamental has shifted with Harry’s hand gentle on Draco’s skin, with the fact that Draco chose to come here.
Draco’s voice goes quiet. “Are you sure?”

“I don’t want to lose you,” Harry whispers, and he didn’t want to say that because it’s too much and it will scare Draco away but he’s
he’s hidden his feelings during this– this fling. He knows, because he’s hidden them so well he’s nearly fooled himself.
“Oh, Harry. No. I– I get scared. I get so scared that I won’t be able to do anything. I don’t know what to do with all that fear. And I

Before Harry leaves, he presses his hand to Draco’s jumper-clad bicep. His grip is firm, and something about it, the casual touch and the proximity of Harry’s smile, shakes Draco to his core.

Draco presses their eyes closed, then furrows their brow as they roll their shoulders, and even though Harry’s vision is whiting out around the edges he soothes a thumb over the hollow of Draco’s throat. “Are you uncomfortable? Do I–

starting to recover from what you put me through. Why would you come here and– and set me back like this?"
“Why didn’t you go home?” Harry asks softly. Draco lives with Pansy– she would’ve taken care of him.
Draco rolls to face Harry. They’re both still naked; Harry’s length lies soft against Draco’s leg, strangely comforting. “Do you mean defining our relationship?”
“I resent that accusation, you lump. If you come to bed I’ll hold you.”

Later, after lurking in the background of the most uncomfortable break-up he’s ever witnessed, Harry holds Draco’s fingers gently in his own and rubs a healing potion across his split knuckles. They’re sitting on the couch, and Draco’s wearing his pajamas, looking pale and ruffled.
“It’s good that the Bond Specialists said they were close to figuring it out, today.”
All of the air punches it’s way out of Draco’s lungs, and he curls himself around Harry, holding on almost too tightly, desperately. He’d suspected, wished, hoped Harry felt as strongly as he did, but Draco has never been brave.
“You have handcuffs?” I ask without thinking, and his expression goes dark, hungry. A moment passes by and I shiver as he blinks, an easy smile tugging at his perfectly-shaped lips.

“I can.”
Draco murmurs softly again and I grin. I learned the hard way that Draco is not a morning person, and it’s best to just let him wake up on his own. Sliding quietly out of the bed, I pad into the main living space, pulling a canister of coffee and a scratched plastic mug from the cabinet. Once it’s brewed and steaming, strong the way I always drink it, I go to the cockpit and check our course.

“Fuck,” Harry whispers, pressing a hand to Draco’s cheek, already starting to pull out. This doesn’t happen. This is different than Draco blinking away tears after coming, this is– sobbing. “Fuck, I’m so sorry, I’m so–”
“Not many,” Draco responds as he follows Harry to his new room, formerly Harry’s guest room. On sunny days the room stays bright thanks to the large windows, but it currently sits dark and gloomy. Harry throws up a small wandless
“Red.”
“I bet you’re so wet,” Harry says sweetly, keeping his voice low even as Draco manages to get a hand free and smack Harry across the cheek, sending hot arousal thrumming through Harry’s stomach and thighs.
When Harry bottoms out, his breath catches.

The aftermath of it is unnaturally still.
“‘Night, angel.”
“You have golden highlights,” Malfoy whispers back. “I can see them in the firelight.”
“No,” Harry says softly. Malfoy’s wearing a full-length nightgown with soft lace at the sleeves and high neck, and she looks beautiful. She looks like a ghost.
“It always feels too dark.” Malfoy pulls her knees up to her chest, a white flash in Harry's periphery. “I just don’t sleep much.”
“Okay,” Harry laughs. “Okay.”
Time seems to stop as Harry stares at Draco, unable to catch his breath.
“Are we going to leave?” he asks in a posh drawl. He’s sitting at the dining bench with a bored expression on his face, but his clenched fists give away his nerves. He isn’t looking at me dead on, eyes locked on my temple, which means he’s hiding something.
“Bollocks,” Harry says immediately, trying to keep his face straight. “You’ve lived with me for over a year, you

Draco cuts him a look but slides his fingers away from the waistband of his pants. “Why are you here if not for this?”
Two months after moving into their new flat, a perfectly cramped one bedroom above an electronics store in Muggle London, Draco comes home with a length of soft red rope and a book.
“Okay, move now.”
“Just relax,” I tell him, kicking my feet out into the air as the familiar feeling of weightlessness overtakes me. I keep the grav on most of the time so that it’s not a huge adjustment when I’m planetside for a while, but I like to turn it off every so often and just hang out.
“Please,” Draco chokes out, even though he didn’t mean to beg– he wanted to retain some semblance of dignity, but he’s quite sure he lost it the second Harry locked eyes with him across the bar. “Please, Potter, please, fuck me so hard I can’t
“Harry,” Draco whispers, because what else is he supposed to say when he’s blinking back tears. “Fuck, Harry, you didn’t have to–”
“That’s what a liar would say,” Draco grumbles, but she lets herself be gathered back up into Harry’s arms. In the shuffle her hand had slipped out of Harry’s shirt but she slides it back in again, her hand soft and slightly clammy on Harry’s bare skin. Harry kisses her on the mouth, just because she can, and Draco deepens the kiss immediately, grabbing onto Harry’s hip, her fingers dipping underneath the waistband of Harry’s boxers briefly. The motion sends heat through Harry’s entire body, and she breaks away.
Also, he might be in love with Draco, but that’s
“I wish I knew how to braid, so I could braid your hair,” Harry says without meaning to. Draco’s fingertips flutter across Harry’s back for a moment, light as air. When she doesn’t reply Harry just shrugs, reaching up to feel the neat lines of a French braid. “This is nice.”

“I didn’t bring you on board with a stunner held to your head. I haven’t tied you up and shoved you in my storage closet to deal with later. I haven’t handcuffed you to my dining table.”
“Sit,” she says gently, and he does, pressing against her side, dragging comfort from her warmth. “I know it’s upsetting. But he… I’m sure it’s so much harder on him. I wish…” She sighs, resting her head on top of Harry’s. “It makes sense why he doesn’t want to get close. So it’ll hurt him less too.”

Soft red rope is knotted down Draco’s back, keeping his arms pulled straight behind him and his feet digging into the back of his thighs.

“Maybe,” Harry laughs. “But only because you dropped into our living room and then said you’d kill me if I didn’t fuck you, and I was

until he comes hard, buried in Draco’s warmth. They lay there for a few moments, sweaty skin pressed together, until Draco starts shivering.
“I can cook for you every day,” Harry blurts out, and Draco’s eyes snap back open.
“I’m sure you can put on a better show than that, pet.”
, endlessly. He wants so wretchedly that he can feel it in the back of his mouth.
By the time Draco comes, he’s blinking away tears. This doesn’t happen every time, but often enough that he knows how to hide it. Harry murmurs at him lazily, his cheek tacky against Draco’s shoulder, talking about his plans for the week and the kitten he adopted two weeks ago, like he’s trying to pull Draco into his life during these hazy moments of flimsy intimacy.
“I’m telling you I won’t. We’ve got ten days at half-warp to Catchpole. We’ll figure it out. Okay?”
Harry gathers Draco in his arms, squeezing him tight for a long moment before kissing Draco’s temple. “Alright. We’ll figure it out.”
“Mm– yes.”
“I can be there when you do. If you’d like.”
“It is not–”
“Harry, I did it!” Draco nearly yells, belatedly noticing the unusual way Harry’s wringing his hands, but he ploughs on. “I said

“Shouldn’t you be doing that during work hours?” Harry asks, his eyebrows scrunching up in the middle with worry. Draco tries not to think about how that expression is becoming more frequent on Harry’s face whenever Draco talks about his job– he can’t dwell on it. He has to have this job, because if he gets promoted, then he’ll get to put his name on the articles, and people will see that he’s doing something. That he’s capable of his own achievements.
“No.” Harry’s voice is low and smooth. Deadly. “Leave, then.”
“Obviously,” they interrupt with a snort, and I cross my arms over my chest. “You need to get off that ship, kid. With the way those alarms are going, I don’t think you’re gonna be able to fix whatever’s wrong.”
“At least let me clean you up,” Harry says, holding up the flannel in his hand. Draco wavers, thinking of Harry’s gentle touch across his skin, and maybe– no.
“It is what it is. I can’t…” Draco laughs dryly, looking down at his hands. “It’s just how it is.”
“Yes.”
“Oh, pet, you could have been
“I did,” Harry says, oddly fierce, and Draco finally looks up to the doorway where Harry is standing, lit by the soft glow of the fairy lights, and time stops.
“What the hell do you do for work?” Draco had gasped out as Harry’s lips found the sensitive spot under his ear.
“You’re going to sleep like the dead tonight,” Draco says with a little laugh, leaning down to press a kiss to Harry’s ankle bone. Harry hums, and Draco moves on to his other leg, repeating his ritual. He’s just as self assured undoing the ties as he is when he does them up, his bright eyes intent on Harry’s body. There’s a pattern to it that’s soothing– Draco slides his fingers under the rope, releasing the pressure on Harry’s skin, then wraps the length around his free hand. Slide, release, wrap.
“Sundays then. I’m making dinner on Sunday nights.”
“Obviously. Didn’t your ship have one?
“You did,” Draco replies, his mouth pulling up into the ghost of a smile.

. I’m going to braid it.”
It starts with a small potted rosemary plant that Draco brings home and presents to Harry, his cheeks bright red the entire time. “You mentioned you want to have a garden,” he says, his words tripping over each other. “I know we don’t have room for– for a whole garden, but we have a windowsill in the kitchen, and it’s pretty spacious, and I just thought–”
“Yeah, I know. You’re going to be like spaghetti for a while. I’m going to get you to drink water while we’re in the bath, though. You need to hydrate.” Harry exhales, then presses a kiss to Draco’s head. “You are so,
. We both win. This is a– a win-win situation.”
It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.
“You didn’t love me,” Draco says right into Harry’s ear, close enough to be heard over the music. Under his hands Harry is trembling, heat wavering off his skin “Harry, you didn’t. Don’t say that.”

for this. I am not here at your beck and call.”
“Harry,” Draco whines, tugging my hair insistently until I’m looking up into his grey eyes, glinting bright with arousal. “Harry.”
Draco turns away from Harry on autopilot, curling up into himself, struck with the fact that Harry could tell Draco was uncomfortable. How? From the lines of his body, from his breathing?
“Someone sounds desperate.” Harry yanks Draco’s pajama pants down to his thighs with his free hand, pressing his thumb into Draco’s throat when Draco hisses at the cool night air.
They hadn’t even kissed.
s from earlier?”
prepared for how hot that would be.”
“I love you very much,” Draco says, barely above a whisper, and Harry shifts, gently taking Draco’s cock on his tongue. He tamps down the urge to hum in contentment and instead rests his cheek on Draco’s thigh. The hair there is downy soft and wispy. Harry closes his eyes and breathes through his nose, letting himself relax into the all-encompassing sensation of
Draco tips his head down to meet Harry’s gaze, his playful exasperation melting away to something more serious. For a moment he just worries his bottom lip between his teeth, and Harry nearly has to look away, the small motion making something unravel in his chest. “I have to prove that I can do something on my own, you know? I have to prove that the Malfoy name isn’t completely useless.” Draco scowls down at his salad, and Harry feels bad for asking.
Draco hears himself whine, but he’s halfway out of his mind and couldn’t be quiet if he tried. He pulls against the restraints again– he likes to fight, to struggle– and Harry makes a wild sound behind him.
“Oh, darling.” Harry presses a kiss to the crown of Draco’s head. “I love you too.”
rings, on Harry’s fingers. There will be time later, to ask
“It’s going to be alright,” Draco says softly. “Better than alright. Your work is fantastic, Harry.”
“Yeah, yeah,
“Hermione,” Draco says, holding his hands out helplessly. “I don’t think I’m the best person for this, you’re so much closer to him…”
“I like you pointy,” Harry says truthfully. “Anyway, I’m too soft.”
“I didn’t know you cursed like a Muggle.”
“Come for me.”
For the first few weeks, Draco told himself the feelings were due to the bond, though the Healer said there was no emotional compulsion. Before they were cursed the two of them were barely acquaintances, civil at best. But it’s hard for Draco to lie to himself when the strongest ache for Harry’s presence isn’t the itch under his skin, but the vise around his heart.
Harry comes to face down in a field of flowers.
“You’re so dramatic.”
“Well I–”
“We–”
“Nope,” Draco says, popping the
Harry stares down at Draco’s hand, his vision blurring with the threat of tears. “He wasn’t treating you the way you deserve.”
“No,” Harry interrupts suddenly. He glances down at Draco with the hint of a smile before reaching out to trace his finger along Draco’s jaw.
“Didn’t wanna wake you,” Harry repeats, his brow crinkling in the beginnings of sleep-addled distress, so Draco kisses his forehead.
Harry doesn’t understand how they can be so perfect. Wonderfully curved, with that heartbreaking dip right in the middle of his top lip. Plush and soft, murmuring things against Harry’s skin late at night or on sun-soaked mornings.
“Wish I could fuck your mouth too,” Harry says breathlessly. “Fill you all the way up.” Without thinking Draco drops his mouth open, arching up into Harry as best he can with the restraints. Harry snorts softly, then places two fingers into Draco’s mouth, pressing down hard on his tongue. Draco lets his jaw drop obligingly, feeling spit pool around Harry’s fingers until he slides them out again. Wetness lingers on his skin as Harry runs his fingers back down to Draco’s nipple, brushing across it lightly. Pressure is building deep in Draco’s stomach, kept at bay by the magical tightness around his cock, and he flicks his head to the side, suddenly feeling like every touch is too intense, too hard, too
as a weapon. It’s the way he says Harry’s name when he comes.
“Yes,” I reply, handing him the now empty cup, which he places on the floor. “Did you come?”
“I don’t know. He liked me?”
“Draco?” Harry asks, his voice still rough with sleep, and Draco whips around, blinking owlishly at Harry and then flinching when the bacon grease pops. He’s wearing his usual silk pajama set, the top few buttons undone and revealing his collarbones, and his hair is up in a messy bun on top of his head. He’s soft, and blinking sleepily, and Harry can barely breathe through his affection. “What are you doing?”
, Draco wants him. Harry’s dark curls are mussed and his skin glows golden, pink curved scars pale in contrast. If Draco strains his head he can see the black patch of hair in the vee of Harry’s legs, the tip of his swollen cock nestled in the curls.
to do that for you, but I can’t risk you, baby.”
“Harry–”
Harry’s breath is hot against Draco’s skin. “It just feels like I don’t get to hear things like that. But it also feels…”
“What do you mean it isn’t the bond?” Harry asks, breathless. “I thought it was the bond.”
“I want this,” Harry says, his voice heavy and sincere. “You. I– I want you.”
“Draco, that’s literally why we’re living together. Because I have the time to cook and stuff.”
“Okay.”
shut up, call me pretty names or whatever just fuck–” Harry thrusts hard, and Draco chokes on air, “–
“Oh my god,” Harry breathes. “Oh my god.”
, angel– Draco– I’ve got you, I’ve got you, baby.”
“But all you have is your bookshelf and your bed. Don’t you have knick knacks? Or– or plants?”
“And the day after that,” Draco murmurs, and then everything is
Draco squirms, trying to keep his breathing steady. “Suck my cock,” he says, too needy to be a demand, and when he comes down Harry’s throat and murmurs
“Get off of me.” Draco thrashes, fiercer than before, nearly unseating Harry before he grabs onto both of Draco’s wrists and pins them to the mattress, leaning his weight onto them the way he knows his husband likes.
“Fine.
“Oh.”
Harry grimaces into the fridge, but pastes a smile on his face by the time he turns to look at his roommate. Draco is standing at the hob, flipping bacon, wearing pink pajama pants and a knit jumper he definitely stole from Harry. Swallowing down his longing, Harry reaches around Draco to grab some glasses from the cupboard for orange juice. “Sure, I don’t care. I can head over to Ron and Hermione’s for the night if you want the flat to yourself.”
. Harry moves directly into Draco’s line of sight, and when he nods Draco returns his hand to the small of his back.
“Call me baby again, then maybe.”
“Your ship has a computer?”
“Hello,” Draco says, trying his best to wave in a sexy manner before realizing it’s hard to wave sexily when you have soot on your hands. “Uhm. Yes. Hello.”
“Tell me you want it,” Harry says, low in his throat. His hand drops from Draco’s hair to grip the back of his neck. The possessive weight nearly makes Draco come right then, but he drags air into his lungs, willing the heat in his thighs to simmer a little longer, until Harry lets him come. Harry’s other hand runs over the sensitive skin of Draco’s arse, raw and stinging with the ghost of Harry’s handprints.
“Ngh,” I manage to get out once the stars are zipping by us rather than a pure blinding white light on all sides.
“Dance with me,” Harry says, grabbing Draco’s hand and twirling himself underneath Draco’s arm, catching a glimpse of Draco’s bright smile before he’s dropped into a dip, Draco’s hands strong against his back. When Draco pulls him back up they meet in a kiss, Harry cupping his hands underneath Draco’s jaw as though he’s holding the world in his palms; he has a feeling that he is.
You’re breathless. “I didn’t think you’d take me at my word.”
“I know.” Harry pulls the sheets down and then back over Draco’s body before pulling Draco to him. “You just don’t say it that much, so it feels pretty special when you do.”
“Oh, fuck,” Draco murmurs, his attention caught by a flashing red light from one of his spells. Burns. He summons his first aid kit, which is rather like a miniature hospital at this point, and sets about locating the injuries. He desperately hopes he won’t have to completely strip down an unconscious Harry on his own couch, because there’s only so much of Harry’s skin he can handle on a good day.
“I’ve got you.” Harry curls his arms around Draco, pulling him even closer. “You’re alright. Shh, darling, darling.”
. You’re going to hurt yourself.” Draco grabs Harry’s bicep, guiding him back towards the doorway. “Are you just going to go home and not even deal with this?”
an adult in all star systems.”
“Hmm.” Draco’s smile widens, turning playful. “You may need to prove it to me.” Laughing, Harry leans forward, playfully brushing his lips against Draco’s before grabbing Draco’s waist and pulling him away from the counter, clicking the wireless on as he goes. Draco blinks for a moment, baffled, but then catches on as Harry shimmies, rolling his shoulders to the upbeat song.
“Are you sure you don’t want to fuck?” Harry asks, because he knows Draco, and Draco just laughs before rolling back and pulling Harry above him. His enthusiastic response is lost in Harry’s mouth, in the slide of their skin, in the rippling heat of Harry pushing in slow with his hands wrapped around Draco’s wrists. Draco comes first with a whimper, panting Harry’s name until Harry also shudders and stills, holding Draco tight to his chest. After a moment Draco casts a cleaning charm and they slip under the covers, facing each other, holding hands tightly as though this is a different life, one where they don’t have a war behind them.
“Good,” Harry says when he breaks away, unable to stop warm affection from spilling into his voice. Draco is just as still as before, looking up at Harry through his lashes. “You’ve been very good, baby. I think I’ll let you choose what we do this time, since you stayed so still and didn’t make any noise, just like I asked. I’m going to give you two options, and you can think about it while I undress. Nod to let me know you understand, or shake your head if you need something else.”
“Stop,” Draco protests weakly; his fight nearly always starts to crack as soon as Harry’s cock is in him. “Harry, Harry.”
of it?”
“Looking for my Transfiguration book,” Draco snaps. The line of his back is hard under his pajamas, lit dimly by a soft-glowing Lumos hovering near the ceiling.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, his mouth pressed to Draco’s collarbone, and Draco must hear the hesitance there because he grabs Harry’s wand from the top of the dresser and does a spell that immediately makes his hole wet and loose against Harry’s fingers. Harry doesn’t even have time to freak out about the intimacy of Draco using his wand before Draco swallows hard and coughs under Harry’s hand.
Malfoy frowns, true hurt flashing across her expression, and Harry feels a twinge of guilt. Before coming back for eighth year, Malfoy cut her hair right at her chin, choppy and jagged. It’s wildly different than the waterfall of silvery blonde it’s always been, and Harry hates that she’s kind of in love with it.
“Dramatics are warranted when your shipmate turns off the gravity with no warning,” Draco bites out, his voice small and sharp, and I finally bump gently into him, stopping my momentum. I grab his shoulders and he glares at me, knuckles white where he’s still holding the couch.
. Draco glances across Harry’s chest, at the mess of burn and claw marks littered there and the faint, curved scars underneath the newer ones. Harry blinks down at him for a moment, his gaze searching and intense. “What words do you prefer?” Draco asks quietly, and Harry visibly softens. He slides off the bed, pulling down his trousers and stepping into the harness as he speaks.
“Oh, babe, that’s dramatic.” I kick off the wall and turn a lazy somersault in the air towards him, the pet name rolling off my tongue before I can catch myself. It’s not new–
Hermione smiles at him, that bright smile that makes her look years younger. “Alright, git, back into the fray.”
“Harry,” Draco says, over and over again in her softest voice, and Harry swallows down her own name like air.
“Harry,” Draco says, fitting himself to Harry’s side and immediately feeling safer. “Let’s just go.”
“I have to get creative sometimes,” Draco mutters, trying not to look pleased as Harry tangles his fingers into Draco’s wind-swept hair.
“So,” Draco says, but it comes out on a sob and he closes his mouth again. Moving very slowly, as though to not startle Draco, Harry lifts his hand and cradles Draco’s cheek, wiping away a tear with his thumb.
“That contestant’s answer was complete bollocks,” Draco says, forcibly looking at the telly. He can still feel Harry’s eyes on him, but eventually Harry sighs.
“Please.”
“I’m washing up after meals.” Draco grabs the empty plates and heads to the sink, as though he’s going to make good on that statement immediately. “It’s fair.”
“I like that you’re soft,” Draco murmurs, and Harry believes her. “It makes you feel real. Like you’re something that won’t slip through my hands.”
“You’re so wet. So wet, just for me. You can say no, you could
“Tell me our safeword.”
“I want– I want–”

“Please stay,” Harry murmurs. It’s the
“I mean, my answer is yes. Of course it is.”
” I jerk underneath him as he works three fingers in and hits my prostate, pleasure shooting down through my thighs, and I pant, trying to remember what I was asking. “With just the friction on your cock?”
“I’m trying to fix Draco’s room,” he replies, and she stares at him piercingly for a moment before looking up towards the ceiling, clearly trying to fight a grin. “What?”
Draco chokes on his inhale. “
“Make me,” Draco says with a sneer that wavers when Harry presses closer. They realize what’s happening at the same time– Draco’s eyes go almost comically wide, and horrified panic ripples through Harry’s body.
at Harry’s feet.
“I don’t mind,” Harry says, trying to keep his voice from wavering. Everything he feels for Draco lies right underneath his skin, and he’s terrified. Of what, he doesn’t know.
“Harry?” he calls, thoughts still slightly muddled by the lingering edge of dreams, before grabbing his wand and padding into the living room.
“I know.” Harry sounds so impossibly tired. “I can’t– uhm. I can’t see.”
“The Prophet can suck my

“Gonna come,” he says, and Draco’s breath stutters. “Would you like to come too, baby?”
for day 6: coming untouched
“Thank you,” Harry says, primly adjusting his glasses, and Draco’s stern face cracks as he laughs. “You can just pay me back for your half of groceries, so I can go while you’re at work. I’m doing the house cleaning though. I don’t mind it, and you don’t need to be wasting your free time on that.”
“Does everything feel alright? It wasn’t too tight?”
“Not to mention I don’t exactly fancy asking someone how they would rate the sex after, you know, having it.”
By the time Harry drops to his knees on the tile floor, Draco is sobbing.
,” Harry snaps, shocked that Draco would even suggest it. “No. Tell me what’s wrong.” Draco shakes his head, dragging warm tears across Harry’s skin. “Please.”
Harry laughs low in his throat, tugging Draco towards him easily by the chain. Draco topples forward, landing on his hands, and Harry grabs his bare wrist and pulls Draco to his chest until he’s staring up at Harry, their faces inches apart. Draco’s lips are bitten pink and parted, and his tongue darts out to wet them, knowing full well how that drives Harry mad.
, “–could do that.”
“But–”
“That’s when I knew that we could make this weird situation work. I still wish it didn’t take away… full consent, I suppose. But I think we’re making it work.” Harry lets himself lean in towards Draco a bit, trying to swallow down the way his heart is pounding. He never talks this much before sex– Draco made it clear once they could be apart that he wanted to keep it rather impersonal, and Harry would give Draco anything at this point.
as his orgasm rolls through him, unstoppable. He hears himself shout, the cuffs digging into his skin as sparks lick through his body. Above him Harry has his face turned to the ceiling again, baring the long line of his throat, and as Draco starts to come down Harry grinds onto him and
“Yellow,” Draco gasps, and Harry stills immediately, his cock buried in Draco. “I’m– I’m sorry, I just–”
“Keep these here?” Draco repeats with a smirk that reshapes into a gasp as Harry nips at his neck with no warning. “Wait– ah, Harry, my robes–”
” Harry’s head snaps up and Draco knees nearly give out when he meets Harry’s burning gaze. He looks
“Yes.”
“Tell me

a small thing, at first.”
“You want me, pet,” Harry croons, watching raptly as Draco’s breathing goes shallow and he momentarily stills, pressing his cheek down onto the sheets. “You know you want me. Just give in.”
“I wanted to hurt you,” Harry murmurs, and the truth of the words cut deep. “Fuck, I wanted to hurt you so bad, but this doesn’t feel…” He trails off, unsure what’s even happening in his chest.
“But–”
“Do you get nightmares too?” Harry asks, staring into the fire instead of the cut of Malfoy’s cheekbones, but she’s aware of them. Harry’s always aware of Malfoy, in a way she’s given up fighting. “I get them, and then it’s too dark when I wake up.”
he’s hiding something, he has a reward on his head across four star systems. But now that he’s sitting here in my ship it’s already more complicated than
Cold.
“I’m sorry I didn’t know,” Harry says, suddenly aware of the fact that if Draco hadn’t gone on his date tonight he wouldn’t have gotten hurt. As though Draco can read Harry’s thoughts, he vehemently shakes his head.
“Hi.”
“Tell me your colour right now.”
“Draco?” he exclaims as soon as he opens the door. “What– it’s nearly eleven–”
“Oh, that’s a good euphemism.”
“Draco,” Harry says now, and Draco shudders in a breath.
“Bet you can’t even fuck me right,” Draco pants, his gaze finally meeting Harry’s, steely and desperate. His entire face is blotchy pink, and Harry finally drops his hand from Draco’s neck, wrapping his arm around Draco’s back instead. There are dark marks left behind, a deep red that should probably worry Harry, but only makes him consider what Draco will look like bruised up. Will he hide the marks with a glamor? Will he look at his neck, and remember what Harry has done to him?
Harry reaches his hands across the distance between their bodies and Draco meets him in the middle, tangling their fingers together. For a while they sit in comfortable silence, Draco’s eyes flicking between their joined hands and Harry’s face.
this sort of case!"
"Of course - I haven't anywhere else, have I?"
“You said this morning. You were meant to be on hols. I can’t take you abroad, but I can help you with the other bit.”
Draco was staring at the fridge-shaped hole in the wood panelling of his study, which had passed through every wall between the kitchen and its final resting place. His eye was twitching in a way that worried Harry significantly.
“Well it’s not hard yet Potter, but if you gave it a proper go—”
“Scrivenation, sir?” Wedderburn asked, his eyes locked worshipfully on Potter’s becrumbed face. Or at least, that’s what Draco imagined was happening based on the breathless quality to Wedderburn’s voice. He was already turned back around to face Morgan.
“Potter. You just kissed me.”
“Oh, fuck - no, that’s not what I meant, Malfoy, Merlin. I was just asking, like, conversationally. Out of interest.
Malfoy had told him. Jesus. Well, that wasn’t going to be a problem, there was absolutely no chance Harry wouldn’t be touching himself as soon as he got home. In fact, the way he was feeling right now, he’d better get a move on before the touching started right here beside the kiddie swings and monkey bars.
“He has my eyes, now,” Harry gives Ted his finger instead, and lets him bite down with relish.
Draco wasn’t sure how much more of this he could take.
“I haven’t any plans,” Malfoy said, casually flicking the cap off the tube. “Frankly, this is the most interesting thing to happen to me all week. Are there any rules against having an observer in the lab?”
“Do you want to sleep in here, or not?”
“I’ve been thinking about my tongue and your arse all afternoon,” Harry said, equally low.
“With a strapping young massage therapist? He has magic fingers, Harry.” Ginny wiggled hers in his face with glee. “
“Oh my god Hermione, why am I just finding out about this now? We have
Longbottom carried his share, and they stacked the gear and samples carefully in the cabin with some Cushioning charms for good measure. Draco lifted his arms and stretched, feeling his spine pop. Longbottom snapped another picture, and Draco yanked his jumper down where it had risen, and flipped him off.
“I don’t think you’ve thought this through, though, mate,” Ron said, feeding Twiglets in one by one in rapid succession like a Muggle wood-chipper. “I don’t think you
“And all I want for my best mate is the same kind of happiness. Lovely, kind, cuddlers are not for him. He needs someone who’s going to drive him up the wall, because he loves that. Loves arguing, loves being put in his place by someone smarter than he is. He needs someone who will call him out for his bullshit. It’s not all fights and fucking for ‘Mione and me, and it won’t be for you either, but I know when I start to get dark thoughts about things, she’s going to pull me up by the hair if they start to get the better of me. She’s the first person whose opinion I want when I’ve got a problem. The first person I want to talk to when something good happens, or something bad. You two have been in each other’s heads for so bloody long, in so many ways. Just let it evolve into the next phase, already, you knob.”
Hermione coughed, and Ginny’s eyebrows threatened to make a break for her hairline. “Ouff. Shots fired.”
Draco’s eyes were soft on him. “What did you get me for dinner?”
“Working.”
“I broke
“Oh, shush,” Draco laughed. “I wish I could have seen his face.”
goblin porn, is it? Oh god. It’s not Griphook?”
His outfit was laid out on the valet in the bathroom (tick), his luggage was packed and assembled neatly by the front door (tick), and an elf service booked for a spring clean while he was away. The perfect schedule, revised a dozen or more times over the past several months as he counted down the days to this much-needed break.
“Ah. Well, my former boss was, well, a difficult personality shall we say, and I decided it might be nice to take some time off, get in touch with the inner me – you know, find myself.”
“Cleaning,” Harry murmured into the corner of Draco’s mouth. “I do want the party, and I want to show you off to all our friends and family,” a kiss, another, just one more, “but I’m not looking forward to cleaning this place up.”
Ginny appeared at his side, wearing satin tuxedo pants, a blue velvet blazer buttoned once around her sternum, and very possibly nothing else underneath. “Parkinson. Have you fallen on hard times? It seems you couldn’t afford a whole dress.”
“Are you dead,” Draco asked darkly.
be a trifle busy.” They scattered like ants, and Draco went back into his office, closing the door before allowing his grin to finally break free. He checked his watch, frowned, and then returned to his desk to check his calendar, picking up a quill to scribble out a memo.
Harry grinned and set the tray on the coffee table in front of the leather sofa, indicating that Draco should take a break and sit with him.
“Malfoy, thanks for coming,” Harry gestured for Malfoy to come over to the whiteboard. “I was really impressed with your custom charm work yesterday. I was wondering if you’d give me your opinion on this.” Malfoy stepped closer to the whiteboard, which was now covered from corner to corner in Harry’s cramped notes.
He stared out the window of the van at the first rays of sun in the breaking dawn, and daydreamed about hash browns and orange juice, and how much better plum jam tasted when it was licked from between Draco's arsecheeks.
They reached what Harry supposed must roughly be the middle of the dance floor, and Malfoy stopped prodding him forward and instead gently squeezed Harry’s hip to indicate he should stop. The air was sort of hazy, with purple and red laser lights cutting in and out of the smoke. Harry’s ear was still tingling from where Malfoy’s lips had almost brushed against it; he felt a sudden need to see Malfoy, and twisted around to face him. Malfoy was really there, his pale hair glowing red, purple, red, as the lights flared and subsided. He looked glorious; incongruous in his waistcoat and grey in a sea of neon and glitter, and bare skin. Malfoy smiled at him and leaned closer to be heard. “What are you thinking, Potter?”
When Draco came to his senses, he was panting and pressed into the hard back of his chair.
“Sorry about before.”
“So, nothing going on with Malfoy, then.”
“On the contrary, it’s now more important than ever that I put you in your place. You’re representing our family, it’s my responsibility to make sure you don’t disgrace us, by applying regular, yet light bullying. Honestly, I don’t know that I understand the point of marriage if one is not supposed to verbally spar with ones intended.” Draco leaned forward to kiss him gently on the cheek. “So, I’m gone for less than one day, and you get yourself hexed half to bits, and you destroy the whole house. Have you eaten?”
an emergency and Hermione or someone came barging in...there would be no hiding what’d gone on. He’d die of embarrassment.
“Pasta salad?” Harry said weakly, hopeful that this wasn’t the start of yet another interrogation.
“You’re being super weird about this.”
“Shut up,” Ron flipped him the rod and unpeeled himself from the table. “I’ll forget to invite
Harry laughed and patted Ron on the shoulder. “I’ll see you at dinner tonight.”
“Good boy. Tell me what else you see.”
The engine rumbled to life, and Harry grinned at Ron. “They got old. We’re not so far behind them, you know.” He eased the car out of the laneway and onto the main street, and before long they were cutting swiftly through the quickly thickening Muggle traffic like a hot knife through butter, courtesy of a combination of Disillusionment charms, and the sorts of spells which allow a car to pass directly through the middle of a roundabout, shrubbery and all, without harm. Harry was particularly fond of that part.
“Not for long,” Potter thumbed the button open at the top of Draco’s trousers, and drew down the zip. “I’m about to make you very messy.” It shouldn’t have turned Draco on even more, but somehow, it did. Potter brought their mouths together in a fierce kiss. His mouth was hot and Draco tried not to lose his breath as he chased the fading taste of Darjeeling across Potter’s tongue and lips. Draco’s fingers scratched at the small of Potter’s back, and in reply Potter took hold of Draco’s hips and pushed his trousers, pants and all, the rest of the way down, where they dropped to his ankles. Draco pulled Potter’s shirt over his head so hurriedly, that his glasses were pulled off too, and Potter grinned at him myopically and hoisted Draco closer by lifting him roughly by the arsecheeks.
Two hours later, Draco found Harry amid utter chaos on the first floor.
Harry leaned heavily on the bar, and ordered a firewhiskey to buy himself some time.
” One of the parents gasped, and Potter went red in the face.
“No breakthrough here,” Potter said quietly, leaning close to Draco’s ear. “I do think I feel
want that, Malfoy.”
Was that all it was going to take, to have Harry begging for it?
Draco looked out across the amphitheatre, crowded with every witch or wizard with any kind of influence in the whole United Kingdom, and some from abroad. An elderly, white-haired witch sat in the middle of the Wizengamot, engulfed by a deep purple robe of crushed velvet, appearing, at first, old and frail. Upon closer examination, her spine stood ramrod straight; her dark eyes almost black, glittering with satisfaction, and the self possession of one who held a great deal of power. It had been she who had pushed for Draco's initial sentencing, who had insisted that the parents of Hogwarts children deserved to have justice for the danger their children had been put in the night that Draco had let in the Death Eaters, and Greyback. She'd been the one to suggest the specific mode of his punishment - five years as gamekeeper at Hogwarts, no magic allowed unless handling magical creatures or in the event of a life-threatening situation. Alma Fivepennies, his prosecutor. Harry Potter was appointed to supervise, and report to the Ministry weekly on Draco's performance. And somehow, today, she had been the one to insist that Draco deserved to be released - six months served, exemplary behaviour. The glowing character reference from Harry, and a few words from Granger. He couldn't lose, with those odds. And he had not. He was free.
