“Thank you, Cici, for everything.”
“Oh?” Draco asked, surprised.  Lara rarely brought anything up anymore.  Usually, Draco was the one driving their sessions, as he talked, stream-of-consciousness about the things he’d done, and learned, and how funny he thought that some of the Muggle things he’d seen were.
“Do you regret it?  Coming back?  Letting Cass donate her bone marrow?”
“Yes, this is my Mama,” Draco answered.
“Dad?”
“You look like you’re in the Headmaster’s office, waiting for punishment,” Draco said finally.
“Oh, Harry, it’s not your fault,” Hermione started, the condescending tone putting Harry’s teeth on edge.  “With your upbringing, it’s no surprise that you are still experiencing trauma from your own abuse.”
“But you know what happened.  We slept together.  We made promises to one another.  We had hope for a future.  Then you left, and I tried to owl you, but they kept coming back.  And I talked to your Mother, and she said you’d left the continent.  That’s all.”
I laugh, and agree.  “Yay.”  I don’t feel like I’m going to expire of satiated lust any longer, and so I maneuver him closer.  He lays his head on my chest, and I wriggle my arm underneath him, so that I can hold him tightly.  I stroke his side, and he giggles, which is, frankly, adorable.  “Draco Malfoy, you’re ticklish?” I ask in delight.
“But-”
“But you were children!”
“Well, no, not exactly,” Harry laughed, “but I did give it to Ollivander.  It turns out that killing a rare magical creature gives you the right to dispose of all its ingredients.”
Pureblood funerals are…involved, Harry realizes.  The next three days pass in a haze of ceremony, and specific outfits, and politeness.  Harry hates it, but he is a solid presence for Draco, instinctively knowing when to enter a conversation and use his notoriety to distract some snobby old witch away from his friend.  Ron keeps Hermione occupied, and away from Harry by educating her on all of the traditions, and Harry is grateful for her distraction.  Neville is a godsend, as he talks Harry through the rituals and keeps him from committing any newsworthy faux pas.  Harry doesn’t give a fig about whether the press catches him doing something embarrassing, but he cares about Draco, and genuinely liked Narcissa, and so he’s glad that her memorial is dignified, just as she’d have liked.
“He’s the Minister, yeah?”  Mill nods, and I continue, “Then yeah, that’s where I’m headed.  Is it weird that the Minister of Magic wants to talk to me?  Like, why would he care?”
“Easy,” a voice says.
“Draco?” All of the hope that had dissipated starts to bubble back.  “He isn’t here.  Is everything okay?”
, Hermione!  And Kreacher seems to encourage it.”
“So we’ll get pissed and pass out after dancing to Muggle music?”
“Show off,” Draco accused.  Harry pried open his fingers and, since the bird was a magical construct and had dissipated, seemed disappointed that the bird was no longer there.  “At any rate, there’s not much to tell.  My Mother was eager to arrange a suitable match for me, but at the same time, she’s aware that I’m not interested in women.  This places her rather between a rock and a hard place, as she’s too dignified to mention my predilections, but too uncertain of her place in society to speak to another family, only to have me refuse the match completely.  It means that the two of us are at a stalemate, which means I don’t have to discuss it until she gets too frustrated to be dignified.  It’s win-win, really.”
“I have a court appearance,” Ron said, but then brightened, “Oh, Mum can come over.”
Draco is silent, he can’t move.  She’s screaming everything that he thinks every day.  Except the lying and cheating part, Draco knows he hasn’t cheated anyone.  But she’s not wrong about Draco’s attempts to try to forget the reprehensible things he did during the war.  Draco wants to crawl underneath the counter, but his limbs are wooden and he can’t move a muscle.  Shame, hot and acrid, suffuses his face.  He can’t say anything.
But, there was no time for woolgathering today, as they both had appointments at Hedwig House.  They apparated into the gardens, and Draco steadied Cass, who always stumbled upon landing.  “Ready?”
“Can we?  I miss you, Harry.”
“It’s a family name, Potter.”
Harry awakens as the sun starts to bleed across the threshold of his bedroom.  He finds that he is plastered against a warm body and as he opens his eyes, grey ones are staring back at him.
“Well, yes, seeing as how she potioned Ron, and nearly got him killed.”
“I’m sorry, Kreacher,  I didn’t remember anything, not even important stuff like…house elves. Not Ron or Hermione, or…anyone.”
When he returned, Minerva was preparing to leave.  “I’ll see her in the morning when she’s awake,” she said firmly.  Her words seemed to galvanize Harry, and he squared his shoulder and managed a watery smile.
Harry’s lack of adult companionship was a topic discussed more often than usual between a father and his nearly ten year old daughter.  Harry knew that he treated Cass more like an adult than was strictly necessary.  He reasoned that, not having had a stellar childhood himself, he wasn’t sure how to relate to a child that hadn’t grown up surrounded by darkness.  On balance, though, he figured that the two of them made it work.  Cass certainly was the cleverest, most well-adjusted child he knew, even if he were slightly biased.
Kingsley frowns.  “Harry, that’s…not convenient.”
“Or evil and calculating, depending on who you ask.”
“Well, nothing more can be done about that,” Ron points out reasonably.  “I’m hungry.  We could go get Mum to feed us.”
Hermione incants, and the words don’t make sense to me, but they’re rich and melodious as they drip off her tongue.  Draco uses the dagger to slice his palm open, and lets his blood drain into the chalice.  Hermione’s voice echoes sure and strong, and next to me, I hear Ron, breathing harshly.  He's nervous, probably for Hermione, based on what he's said about Slytherins in the past.  I don’t know exactly what’s at stake here if we screw this up, but Luna’s made it clear that magic isn’t risk-free.  “We call upon Mother Magic to hear this man’s petition!” Her voice makes the chamber ring, and then there’s complete silence.  The air seems to grow heavy as we wait.  I want to shift my weight, but I don’t dare.  Suddenly, in a blinding flash of light, a ghostlike figure appears.  Her translucent hair is long and she wears robes that are similar to Draco’s.
Cass tugged a lock of her wild curls and sighed.  “Genetics.  Honestly, Dad, all the things I could get from you, and I ended up with your hair?”
Satisfied that he was sleeping soundly, Draco returned to the living room.  Astoria was staring into the fire, a huge gin and tonic in her hand.  She noticed his entry, and motioned towards his own drink.  Taking a bracing gulp, Draco settled himself at her feet.  “Tor,” he said.
In truth, the first time that Harry had asked Draco out, he’d been terribly hurt, thinking that Harry was making fun of him for his sexuality.  Draco knew that he’d been unkind as a child, not just to Harry, but to…well, everyone, but he was disappointed that Harry would stoop to something so hurtful.
Harry holds up a hand, requesting her silence while he continues.  “You were.  Everyone does it.  From the moment I got this stupid scar, people have acted like I was public property, and that everyone gets to have a say in the choices I make.  I’m a person, Luna, and I deserve the right to decide things for myself.  If that means that I don’t want to date, or I choose not to share my feelings with others, it’s my decision.  You’re welcome to your opinions, and sometimes, I’ll invite you to share them with me.  But I’m finished with other people deciding things for me, for my own good.  If you think differently, that’s okay.  We don’t have to be friends, and I’ll wish you all the happiness in the world as we go our separate ways.  It’s your choice whether you want to take me as I am, or if you wish to see me as someone who needs fixing.”
“Okay!”  Harry jumped to his feet and clapped his hands.  “What’s the first rule?”
His frantic spell casting seemed to help though, because Harry gasped a breath.  His eyes were still blurry and unfocused, though, and his body remained rigid.  Draco’s panic reached a frenzied peak, however when, with a tiny tremble, his body started to change.  It started at his feet, the tiny socked toes lengthening and thickening, and the change extended to his ankles, and up his legs.  Beneath his t-shirt, Draco could see his ribs expand, and then his shoulders, and ankles, before his face altered in front of Draco’s eyes.  Later, Draco would be unable to articulate exactly what changed, but as he watched, the baby-soft innocence disappeared.  He was still innocent-looking, but his eyes, in particular, obtained a more adult quality.  It was
Harry was immediately forgotten as Malfoy knelt in front of his son.  “Oh, darling.  Come here.”  He gathered the child into his arms, and held him tightly.  “Are you alight?”
“How in Merlin’s name am I to fix him?”
“It’s possible.  I don’t really want to talk about Harry though.  He’s welcome to come to me for treatment if he likes.”
His pupils dilate, and he sinks to his knees, clumsy hands unbuckling my belt, opening my fly.  I’m not a blowjob expert, by any means, but this one’s mediocre at best.  Still, mouth on cock is hard to screw up too much, as I demonstrated the other night.  He pulls off.  “You can fuck my mouth, if you want.”  His voice is shy, his eyes cast submissively downward.  He has incredibly long eyelashes, which rest appealingly on his high cheekbones.  I grip him by the hair, thrust into his waiting mouth.  He moans.  It’s perfunctory.  A means to an end, but still, I come, and as I pull sharply on his hair when I spill down his throat, by the sounds of him, he does too.
“Oh.  That sounds sort of vile, if I’m being honest.  Do you suppose I could have a pint of something?”
“Yes, I rather think you will.”
I whirl around, wondering if some jealous boyfriend is about to punch me, but nope, it’s the redhead.  Ron.
“I suppose you’d better tell me, then.”
I read it more closely.  “‘Saviour seduced by Sinner’?  I’ll give them points for alliteration, but it’s a bit hyperbolic.”
Harry couldn’t find any reason to argue, so he took the stack of clothing that was handed to him, and showered.  He looked into the mirror and a stranger looked back.  His face was thin, and gaunt, and his eyes looked dull.  His hair was a lot longer than it had been, and his beard had grown in completely.  What had happened?
Linden sneered at Harry, his crooked teeth making Harry think of Snape.  It was his only resemblance to Harry’s Potion’s instructor though, as Nettle was short, squat, and had at least three decades of age on Snape.  “I still think it’s mad, letting you around children.  Between your unnatural tendencies, and your propensity to violent outbursts, you’re a walking time bomb.”
“Hermione.  She got mad at me.  And I got mad too.”
“I’m not sure,” Draco said thoughtfully.  “I’ve never met her.  I’m sure you know that she and my Mother’s family had a falling out when Andromeda married Ted Tonks.”
“Um, sure, thanks,” I say, and a few minutes later, Mill appears, lacking her usual smile.
“I know.  I know.  He’s absolutely furious with me, as he has every right to be.  I left the UK without telling anyone for what seemed very good reasons.  I honestly thought that I was doing the right thing.  None of that matters now, because I’ve cocked it all up, but I swear to you, Pansy, I didn’t do this to hurt Draco.”
Two days pass before his bedroom door opens again in the darkness, and a slim, pale body steals into the covers beside him.  Harry unfolds like a flower, surrounding the beloved form of his love.  “I got a rather pointedly-worded owl from Granger,” Draco says.
He looked up a Draco now, and his eyes, still tear-filled, were so green, and so desperately pained.  “Of course it didn’t work like that.  I chose to return to England, and I did have to admit that I’d gone about things in a terrible way.  And when I saw the custody papers, it reinforced everything I’d been telling myself for years.  That freaks aren’t allowed to ask for things.  That saviours aren’t allowed to want something, especially if it takes it away from someone else.”
“What’s Gringotts?”
When he finally spoke, it was more like a breath than a voice.  Draco leaned closer, desperate to hear what Harry’s heart desired most. “Cass,” he said softly.  “A family.  A proper family where I feel like I’m part of it, not watching from the edges.”    Miriam seemed to ignore Draco’s agonized look.
He grins.  “Sounds about right.”
“You’re so different,” he says hesitantly.  I tense.  “No, it’s not a bad difference,” he assures me.  “Your past was, I think, a heavier burden than was good for you.  And it’s nice to see you making choices because they’re what you want, not because of what you think is best for others.”
“Well, no,”
Harry, sensing his introspective mood, stood on his tiptoes to kiss his cheek.  “You good, Draco?”
“But you know enough to go and throw your weight around, disrupt an unjust arrest?”
Apologies for the very short chapter, but it's needed to get us from here to there, and because of the Point-of-view change, it didn't make sense to break it up any other way.  I promise the next few are quite a bit longer, and I'll post the next chapter in a day or so to keep you from having to wait too long.
“And if you miss me, or get lonely or sad, you’ll come get me?”
I can feel how big the smile on my face is, and Mill is watching me with interest.  “Draco’s going to help me get my memory back.  I think.  Well, he hasn’t said no yet.”  She gets the same look that everyone else gets, every time Draco’s name is mentioned.  “What’s that face mean?”
Harry made a face, and Miriam said, “You can make up a game later.  This is my game, so my rules.”
Agnes smiles at me as I arrive at her desk.  “Harry, how’re things?”
Looking around, a little ashamed, Dean sighs.  “I really fucked up this room,” he says.
“About Malfoy? Or about the fact that you need minding?”
“It’s Molly, dear.  I know that your family and ours don’t get on, but after our Harry stood up for you after the War, you haven’t caused a spot of trouble.  I’d say it’s time to let bygones be bygones.”
“We can’t take him to St. Mungo’s.”  The mulish set to Weasley’s jaw was beginning to set Draco’s nerves on edge.
“Are you lonely?”
“No, probably not.”  Hermione was just as terrifying as she’d been in school, more so, actually, because she was a lot more confident.  Harry wished that he'd seen Hermione toe to toe with Romilda Vane.
He gave Malfoy a crooked smile that was more like a grimace.  “What you missed, then, was how spectacularly things fell apart after that.  Your parents’ deaths uncovered a lot of corruption and shoddy practices within the DMLE.  I tried, for about a year, to change things, but I wasn’t getting anywhere, and I was so unhappy.  I’d been fighting the Ministry, and wizards who were taking the law into their own hands, and it was just, suddenly so clear that nothing I did would make a difference.”
It takes nearly a week of uncomfortable indecision before I finally agree to have Hermione restore my memories.  I’m fearful of the consequences of my action, but I have to admit, living this sort of bland life, where I never particularly feel anything, would soon grow awfully boring.  Draco assures me that this leap of faith with little consideration of risk is fully in character for me.
“My wand.”  Cass had tearfully confessed how she’d come to acquire her wand, and Harry had been quick to reassure her.
“Yes,” Harry agreed.
“Everyone!  With you guys, and with my students.”
I consider this.  “I understand that.  It
After a very, very long silence, Harry give an almost imperceptible nod.  Draco cast the diagnostic spells, taking care to be especially gentle.  Harry jumped a little when Draco’s magic washed over him, but otherwise didn’t move.  When he was finished, Draco said, “Thank you, Harry, you did brilliantly.  That was very helpful.”
She stops walking abruptly, pulls her long hair back from her face and stares up into the sky for a moment.  Finally, she breathes out an enormous breath, and turns to face me.  “Not,” she says carefully, “by anything you’ve ever said.”
“Saved by laziness,” I respond lightly.  “I get why this is such a jarring difference, though,” I finally continue.  “That bloke in the memory, he’s nothing
“I set up the Probation and Rehabilitation Department.  A number of people, including the children of convicted Death Eaters did break laws during the war, even if it was just aiding and abetting their parents.   They had to answer for their crimes, but public opinion didn’t support sending them to Azkaban. Nevertheless, nobody wanted them participating in an uprising, either to try to reincarnate Voldemort or to replace him, so I was able to convince the Wizengamot to create the department, and I personally supervised its efforts.”
Harry wipes the tears that have appeared on Draco’s lashes.  “You’re going to be okay, Ferret-boy,” he says gently.
“The super-ego works to control the id's impulses, especially the ones that aren’t considered socially acceptable.  It persuades us to do the right thing, even when no one is watching. It also has the function of persuading the ego to turn to moralistic goals rather than simply realistic ones and to strive for our ideal self.”
“Of course,” I say, stepping back and allowing him entrance.  I catch a closer look at his expression.  “What’s wrong?”
“Harry, no.  Is that what they told you?”  Harry nodded, a wrinkle appearing between his fine eyebrows.  “No, Harry, your mum and dad were really good people.  They weren’t drunk, I’m positive.  I don’t even think they had a car.”
She gives me a look that I can’t quite place.  Part annoyed, part sad, and a hint of something else, but she says, “Chaser,” and I nod as though I know what that means.
“Has he changed, then?  I seem to recall that he was a superior little shit in Hogwarts, if the stories you tell are even remotely true.”
“Alright then,” I say, and then something occurs to me.  “Draco, from what I’ve been told, you and your family have had some…image challenges since the war ended.”  It’s the politest way I can find to say that people seem to hate him, and the look on his face confirms that I’ve not done a terrific job at it.  No way out but through, I decide, and continue.  “Wouldn’t it do your reputation good to be seen as someone who righted a wrong?  And seeing the way that people seem to pay attention to me, I can’t imagine that it would hurt you any.”
“Do they tell you that?”  Harry nodded.  “Harry, sometimes, do strange things happen to you?  Things you couldn’t explain?”  Another nod.  “That’s perfectly normal.  It’s just accidental magic, and it happens to young witches or wizards when they feel upset.  We all do it.  It doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you.”
“Thank you,” Cici said.  “You’re very generous.”
Nina’s voice echoed through the sitting room, and Luna whispered into Malcolm’s cupped hands.  Harry didn’t really understand Luna’s unconventional version of providing comfort, but he’d seen it in action enough times to let it proceed.  Malcolm’s eyes were drooping, and Luna pressed a gentle kiss into each tiny palm.  “He’s ready for bed, I think,” she said.
Draco started, and looked closely at her.  Her face was impassive.  “I don’t know what you mean,” he said, his voice stiff and stilted.
“Alright, Weasley?” Draco said in a quiet voice.
“So the super-ego is basically, Hermione, in our brains,” Ron expands.
share yourself with us, Harry. You give your time, and your love, and you never once let anyone see any of the things you deal with.  You keep everyone at arm’s length.  You don’t let anyone help you with anything.”
She waved a hand cheerfully. “I have to eat anyhow, and Ron will be pleased to hear I’ve left the office for a change.”  Her smile dimmed a little.  “Draco, I wanted to let you know how sorry I am to hear of Scorpius’ illness.  It must be so difficult for you all.”
“She’s fine,” Hermione says, and when Draco looks skeptical, she continues, “It isn’t easy to find someone who knows the brain and the Magical world.”
“Call me Ben, please.”
“Oh?”  Strictly speaking, Harry was under a restrictive secrecy agreement, but, since Andromeda was a Healer, she was a bit of a loophole, and Harry appreciated her advice. He supposed that it was
“What is it, my heart?”
Of course there are owls, several a day, at first.  He ignores them, and they become more and more persistent, but he becomes efficient with shield spells, and they flap through the Great Hall in agitation.  When Hermione appears at breakfast one morning, he rushes back to his quarters, and, later, goes to Minerva.
Draco had long ago reconciled himself to the fact that he wasn’t a good man.  He was a man who made awful choices, and a coward, and he knew he would be punished in the afterlife.  Whatever guilt he struggled with on a daily basis about his moral fibre, he had no compunction whatsoever about widening his eyes, and replying, “Hermione’s going to kill you.”
“Well then, Cass, maybe you’d sit with me until dinner?  We have a great deal to catch up on."
“We all watch Drag Race,” Harry grinned suddenly, and Draco’s heart did another unappealing flip.  Against his better judgement, he flung some of the throw cushions onto the floor and leaned back into the couch while Harry called the housemates.  Harry flopped beside him and Draco was aware of a warm thigh so close to his own that it was nearly touching.   Draco took a breath and tried to ignore it.
“Dad, this is insane.”
“What do you think is happening?” Draco asked.  Harry looked closely at Draco.  He didn’t seem defensive, or like he was hiding something, just worried and upset.  But, Harry reminded himself, Draco was a Slytherin, and had learned to mask his real emotions since birth.
“I’m sorry.  I didn’t really plan for you to see me all disgusting and pathetic.”
“Harry,” Draco said, taking a step toward where Harry was splayed out on the bed.
“It was for the greater good.”
“I’m afraid we don’t,” Draco said.  “We were only made aware of the need for a discussion with the Head yesterday evening, so there wasn’t time to make one.  I understand that she is likely very busy, and I hate to presume, but the matter is time-sensitive.  Is there a possibility to make any time in the Head’s schedule today?”
I shrug, which has him doing his whole ‘blink at me strangely’ routine.  He’s posh, clearly I’m not posh, it just makes good sense to work to our strengths.  Hopefully I’ll soon figure out what mine are.  He seems to mentally shrug back, and then obligingly opens the menu.
Draco laughed.  “I was.  And I didn’t realize that until I was eighteen years old.  The War was difficult, not just for Voldemort’s enemies, but for his followers too.  He was cruel, and he was driven, and he didn’t care how he used someone, so long as he was getting what he wanted.  When Harry finally ended him, our society was very angry at those of us who had taken his Mark.  Anyone who had been in his service was hated.  Harry spoke for me at my trial.  Don’t get me wrong, Cass. I did terrible things, things I’d give anything to take back, but I was also a scared kid, trying to protect my family.  Harry seemed to understand that, and so he managed to keep me out of prison, and get my Mother put on House Arrest.  My Father served a five year term in Azkaban.  We were given incredible leniency, and the people in our social circle hated us for it.”
Astoria, a product of her breeding, did not outwardly react in any way, but her fingers tightened around his knee so tightly that Draco could barely keep from grimacing.  “So it’s not fixed yet?” Scorpius asked.
“Bad Harry.”
She smiled.  “Kitchen still hates your coffeemaker?”
“I beg your pardon?”  Harry’s voice had gone very low.  He was vaguely aware of Cass murmuring ‘uh-oh’, next to him.
“Maybe that’s why he’s doing it.  Maybe that’s the only tradition from his family that he feels is worthy to keep.”
, his mind supplied.
“I want to give it to him, you know.  I want to give him everything, really, but the family?  That’s what I want too.”
Harry smiled, knowing that Draco’s protests were now just a matter of saving face, and not agreeing too readily.  “Well, one of them is your cousin, actually.  Teddy Lupin.  He’s the nine year old, and he’s a good sort.  He’s well-used to being the oldest kid in the gang, and he’ll enjoy the cake, if nothing else.”
“How can you?”
The last thing he thought before he fell into an uneasy, lonely sleep was, this could have been mine.
“We agreed that you’d stop calling me that,” she teased, and wrapped her arms around his middle.
.  “The three best friends have to sneak into the vault, and that’s not going to be easy, because Gringotts is protected by the Goblins, who are smart, and hard to trick.  They drink the Polyjuice-”
“Draco, this world is your home.  This is your heritage, your history.”
“My family was once very influential, and my Father…he had some strange ideas about what it meant to be a proper Wizard.  For a number of reasons, your Dad was the sort of person he didn’t approve of.  If he’d not gone a bit silly, he likely would have wanted to take you away from your Dad’s influence.”
Eight o’clock found Draco in his lab, pot of tea set with a warming charm, and some classical music from WWN2 gently playing in the background.  He cast a scouring charm on his worktable and lifted his quill, his diary open to today’s page before stifling a groan.  It was inoculation day, which meant that, in merely four hours, his sanctum would be invaded by Aurors.  He’d spelled the appointments into his diary from the parchment that the Ministry had sent over last week, and he scanned the names.  Pritchard, Jones, Richmond, Weasley, and Potter.  He allowed himself the luxury of three breaths, then repeated Lara’s words to himself, “The threats are manufactured, and my caution is an asset.”
“No, Malfoy, I can’t.  I have to go back to the Ministry before anyone notices that Harry and I are both gone.”
“I’m not sure.  We received word this morning that I could restore my memories, if I choose.”
“Picture it,” I say.  “Midnight, a dark warehouse.  I’m sneaking through the shadows, because that’s what I do.  At my job.  Sneak, and vanquish evil, that sort of thing.  I’m looking dashingly handsome, of course, in my dark green robes-”
“Why not?  If I ask for your help, I can’t very well tell you how to go about it, can I?”
“Oh.”  Draco looked startled for a moment.  “I’m not sure, we’ll have to ask him.  Maybe we could find a Muggleborn Tutor for you.”
It’s a week before Harry returns to the shop, and Draco has spent much of it snapping at Grace over trivialities and
“You scared
“I like that.  It’s very apt.  Have you been having a nice time in Scotland so far?”
Harry Potter would be here to witness his humiliation.  Potter doesn’t look at Draco, his attention is fully focused on the screaming woman who’s in Draco’s face.  “Out.  You don’t get to come and scream rubbish at anyone, much less someone in their place of business.”
“No, it doesn’t.”
“Cici, I have a sister!” Scorpius said delightedly.
“I guess.  Is Cass going to wake up soon, though?”  Harry looked at Cass, his worry evident in his features.
“Alright.”  The drinks were poured, and Harry sat, uncomfortable, unsure why Draco was making the gesture.
“I want to know, obviously.”  Her delivery of the word ‘obviously’ was a deadpan Severus impression, and Harry flicked his eyes to the portrait to see his reaction.  Severus emitted a long-suffering sigh, and motioned Harry to continue.
“Draco!  They won’t be as nice tomorrow!”
“Oh,” Harry says, his voice small.  He’s obviously dreaming, so he decides to just go for it, and finish what he has on his mind.  “That’s good.  I…also have interest.  But I’m also completely broken, and I’m not going to be any good at anything, and I think I need to go really slow, and Merlin knows, I’m not really a catch, so as my friend, I’ll tell you right now that you could do a lot better.  But,” Harry stops to take a breath, and he’s not sure if he can say this next part, so he waits it out, and hopes that maybe Draco will start talking so he doesn’t have to.  Sadly, Draco is just looking at him, so he summons his courage, and says, in a voice that makes him curse his fears, “But, I want this.  I want you.”
“Harry,” Draco said evenly, his face revealing nothing, but his eyes warm.  Harry managed a nod, and a weak smile.
We remove our robes in silence, and when we’re both in t-shirts and pants, we crawl into the big bed.  The distance between us spans wide, and in some ways, it’s lonelier than if I’d stayed in the guest room.  Then, I feel a cool hand encircle mine.  “Is this okay?” Draco’s voice is barely a whisper.
“It’s fine,” Draco replied curtly.  “You should remove your outer robes.  Did any of the potion touch your skin?”
“Not Harry,” Hermione says.  “His egoistic wants are very simple, and he has little need for more of the depraved desires.  He just wants to live a simple life.”
“Yeah,” I say with a laugh.  “Not sure why old me wore everything so big.”
After a check on Scorpius revealed that he was fast asleep, and a second one on Cass revealed the same, Draco left his sleeping children (Children!  Plural!  In his house!), and curled into his favourite chair.  The wounds left from discussing his failures were deep, and he manfully soothed them with a snifter of brandy.  It helped about as much as he expected it to, and invariably, his mind returned to his discussion with Cass.
“Draco, are you listening to yourself?  If this were someone else, what would you tell them?  If it were Pansy, or Blaise, and they were basing their self-worth on the conditional approval of another?”
“Harry?”
“Well, no.  You’d be here at base, but you’d be communicating closely with the Senior Aurors who lead tactical teams.”
Harry had a familiar, mutinous expression that somehow looked adorable when on the face of a seven year old.  “I just wanted to make you breakfast,” he said, his eyes on the floor.
Someone was groaning.  Groaning and swallowing repeatedly.  Draco had been the sober one at enough parties to recognize the guttural swallowing noise for what it was: a harbinger of vast amounts of vomit.  “Accio bucket,” he cried in alarm.  The bucket arrived, mostly in time to catch the copious amounts of sick that poured from Harry.  Draco frantically vanished it, grateful that at least he was back in the Wizarding world, and he didn’t have to clean it from the carpet by hand like he did in Toronto.  There was a plastic cup left on the table, and so he quickly scourgified it, spelling it full of water, and holding Harry’s head up to drink.  “Here, drink a little, Harry, you’ll feel better”.  Harry obediently drank a few swallows, but turned his head away before Draco could get much into him.  He summoned another flannel, and cast another quick augumenti, washing Harry’s face, and smoothing the sweaty hair back from Harry’s forehead.  “You’re okay, Harry, I’ve got you.”
“Yes, I expect it will get exciting if she explains who her Dad is.  How is Harry doing?”
From the hallway, Draco could hear a disgruntled, but slightly familiar voice lamenting, “…but why does she only bloody wake up when I come in?  It’s like the old bint
“Six weeks.  My mother will be in hysterics, planning.”
“Draco, I…I never thanked you for your letter.  I wasn’t sure how to respond to your apologies, but I wanted to know that I really appreciated it.  And I believe that you’re doing the right things, since…well, since.  And what you’re doing for Harry…I just…thank you, Draco.”  To Draco’s horror-filled surprise, Hermione wrapped her arms around him.  Draco stiffened, and she immediately backed off.
Hermione’s eyes flashed in panic at Draco, and he said, “Weren’t you afraid that you’d cause an almighty fuss if you told your mother?”
“Draco,” I say.  “We’ll figure it out.”  I have no idea if that’s true, and I hope that nobody asks for any details.  I look around suddenly, remembering that Draco doesn’t live here alone.  “Where’s your Mother?”
“Perhaps.  But right now, I am concerned with a little boy who has enough on his plate already, and a young lady who is watching a stranger scream at her Dad.”
“So you going all 'red mist' on someone who makes you mad isn’t something you did when you were younger?”  Greg was grinning now.
“And?”
, and the stretching, he was bigger, a bit, anyway, and squinting at Draco in a way that made him know exactly how old Harry was when he got his glasses.  Draco pulled Harry’s glasses from the cupboard where he’d placed them, along with his wand and his Auror robes.  After the glasses were shrunken to an appropriate size, Harry owlishly blinked a little, then smiled up at Draco.  “Is that my stuff?”
Harry looked at the elf, complex emotions crossing his face.  He looked as though he was about to say something once or twice, but eventually just shrugged helplessly.
“I’d rather find a dark corner and suck you off, but I suppose a drink is alright too,” I reply, and his eyes look like fucking
Lara, unsurprisingly, was not in favour of Draco’s newly appointed role of nanny to the Saviour of the Wizarding World.  “You do like to bite off more than you can chew,” she remarked.
“A little,” Hermione admitted,  “but I’m still a giant coward.  I told Ron that I didn’t see how it could be any sort of stimulant, and that the I thought maybe it was some type of attraction potion.  We’ve known that part for ages, anyhow.  He’s an Auror, though, and I’m sort of hoping…”
“What’s that?”
“And what did you say?”
Draco wasn’t sure, actually.  He hadn’t left his home in well over a year, aside from flooing to therapy.  His increasing need for isolation had been what had prompted Paul to finally break up with him.  Since he’d moved out, the idea of being beyond his wards had horrified Draco.  Still, it was the Manor, and despite the figurative ghosts that now haunted it, it felt like home.  His Mother was there, and familiar elves, who would do whatever Draco needed to keep them all safe.  “Let’s go,” he said decisively.  “Go and clean up, get dressed, and we’ll leave when you’re ready.”
So he does.  “After the war,  the moral backlash on Death Eaters was enormous, as you know.”  He looks at me and amends, “As most of you know.  They imprisoned anyone who was a Death Eater, and it was only your testimony, Harry, that managed to free Mother and I.  Our reputation was in tatters, and they seized a great deal of our assets in reparation, but we were free, and, after our probation, the Goblins were the only ones who would hire me.  Goblins don’t really care much about human matters; they only cared that I could do my job.”
The woman clicked her tongue at him, and examined the diary in front of her.  "I could make fifteen minutes available at 11:00 sharp,” she said, a little grudgingly.  “But then she has an appointment with the Minister, so that’s the best I could do.”
“I’m pretty sure there were tumbleweeds.”
her.  Most of the time, her bossiness is endearing.  And sometimes, she goes too far, and I get annoyed.  You haven’t fought back, not before this, not ever.  I think you surprised her.”
“How’s Scorpius?” Ron seems subdued, which isn’t normal, but he also looks genuinely concerned.
“Little duck?”  Harry had turned to his daughter.
Harry sighed.  “I have a hard time trusting people, both because I feel like their assistance is conditional, and because I have a hard time believing I deserve it in the first place.  It isn’t easy for me to ask for or accept help from others.  A lot of the decisions I’ve made in parenting Cass have been as a result of feeling like I have to go it alone.  And…” A harsh sob escaped him, and he covered his face with his hands.  Hank snuggled closer and put a heavy head on Harry’s knee.  The tears flowed faster and Harry let them go for a moment, but then cleared his throat.  Miriam passed him a handful of tissues, which he used to mop his face, and blow his nose.  Draco watched as he swallowed, and then squared his shoulders.  “And,” he said again, “this explains a lot of the decisions I’ve made as a parent, and also helps to explain why I broke down when I left England.  Being Cass’ Dad was the way I defined myself, and when I didn’t have that anymore, I let myself believe that I had failed.”
“Harry help,” Harry said in a whisper, but the look of fear on his face suggested that he thought that this might be some sort of prank.
Eventually, I’m pointed towards an office door.  As I lope over towards it, I realize that I have no reason for seeking Malfoy out.  I pop back to the Welcome Counter.  “Can you remind me what Mister Malfoy’s area of specialty is?”
to defeat that snake-face arsehole only to keep allowing stupid things from the past to divide us,” Harry answers grimly.  He notices, with some approval, that Neville has spent most of the day clinging to Ginny like a limpet.  He hadn’t known that they were together, but it makes sense, and he is surprised that he isn’t jealous in the slightest.  The night ends on a surprisingly hopeful note, the group agreeing to meet at the Hog’s Head for a get together the following month.
I look at her evenly.  “I don’t want to talk about anything.  Not now.”
“Merlin no.  Just an agreement is fine.”
“From start to finish, we expect you sleep about two hours.  Everything should be finished before lunchtime.  Alright then, I’ll leave you all to get changed, and you can kiss your parents goodnight, and then we’ll be back in to give you the draughts.” Cici gave them all a big smile, and she and Healer Mancini exited, shutting the door behind them.
“I did.  I did a bad thing for what felt like very good reasons, but I doubt that is any comfort.”
Jealousy bloomed in Draco’s mind for a moment.  Who was Hank?  Why did Harry need him?  He wasn’t at all comfortable with a stranger being part of this.  He was about to protest, but Harry, seeing the look on his face, said, “It’s okay, I promise.”
Draco doesn’t push him for more details, and more importantly, whatever pity he feels for Harry isn’t acknowledged.  He just says, “I can see why it would be hard to expose yourself after being independent for so long.  And I know what it’s like to feel like it isn’t safe to be vulnerable around anyone else.”  Draco looks at him from under his fringe.  His eyes are pretty, Harry notices absently.  “You know all of the worst things I’ve ever done, and we’ve still ended up as friends despite it all.  If you ever did feel like you wanted someone to talk to, really talk to, I…”. His glance falters and he flushes before he says, “I could be that person.  No pressure or anything, but no judgement.”
He chuckles.  “You’re not pathetic, exactly.  Just…floppy, and sort of sweet.”  He takes my arm.  “I’m going to side-along you, okay?”
“It hasn’t been performed for centuries,” Hermione continues.  “It has a heavy cost.”
“Scorp, that’s the nicest one yet,” Dean said, and Scorpius entertained himself by flying the dragon around Dean’s head.  Dean gave Draco and Astoria a friendly smile, and cast the standard diagnostics.  “Okay buddy,” he said.  “Time to appease the Vampire.”
“I’d like to run some scans,” Draco said.  He wasn’t sure if he was telling Hermione or Harry, but the little boy looked up at him fearfully.
It could be his only excuse for his thoughtless performance at dinner.  Narcissa had been telling Harry about Cass’ visit to the Manor.  Draco listened with half an ear, caught up in thoughts of Harry and Cass, and how he’d stupidly made the decision to abandon what could have been his.  Harry seemed calm about the fact that Cass had spent time with Lucius, and roared with laughter when told about the peacocks.
And Draco.  Harry had expected Draco to be angry, but he’d been unprepared for how
One sentence, and I’ve tipped him over the edge from annoyed to angry.  “Potter, you are in line to be the next Head Auror.  You must know that you can’t be seen consorting with known Dark Wizards.”
Hermione found him, two hours later, still scrubbing down the cabinets.  “My goodness, Draco, you can’t possibly be up already!  I suppose this is how you keep such a lovely clean home.  Do you mind if I make coffee?”
“Well, that’s good then,” Harry said.  “I bet we’re best friends.”
“What makes you say that?”
Draco grinned.  “Well, the West Parkdale Wolves are very proud to sport the crimson and gold.  And I’m a very proud member of the Wolves.”
“And how do you feel?”
“You broke me.”
The entire room was silent.  Even the babies were quiet.  The only sounds were the crackling of the fire, and a little whimper from within the blanket that Draco carried, as though its contents was waking from its nap and was curious about its surroundings.  Harry took a step towards him, and Draco thrust the blankety lump towards him.  Harry accepted it deftly, and unwrapped the blanket carefully.  When the tiny brown-furred head poked out, Harry gasped.  “Draco.  It’s a dog.  You got me a dog.”
“And how is that disgusting Muggle pastime going?”
She purses her lips at Ron, but continues, “The super-ego also uses guilt to punish us when our behaviour falls short, and pride when we try to hit the ideals that it sets for us.”
“I think we both walked away.”
An interview with Luna Lovegood goes…pretty much as I should have expected, really.  We manage to get the salient points of the story across, and Luna takes a picture of Draco holding a cherubic-looking Scorpius, but it’s hard going.  Luna is prone to disjointed flights of fancy, during which she questions Draco earnestly on his Nargle infestation.  We’ve just managed to drag her back unwillingly from a discussion of the effect of Dirigible Plum brandy on moon frogs, when she locks her strangely compelling eyes on me and says, “Of course, the Ministry has always had a seedy underbelly, you know.”
“I want you to tell me.  Tell me everything.  I don’t want to have to remember it bit by bit.”
“Oh,” Grace, his assistant says.  “Did I miss Harry?”
“Please don’t go, Harry. I was hoping that we could talk.”
Hermione shakes her head.  “You thought that the therapy was voluntary, and, fortunately, you never tried to quit.  Everything else happened in secret.  I was working day and night, trying to find a solution.  Finally, the Psychologist and I developed a theory.  Harry, have you ever heard of Freud?”
“Myrtle’s bathroom.” My voice is slurred, but I’ve clearly remembered right, because she starts to sob.  Ron, who has appeared in my field of vision, pulls her into his chest, and she winds around him like a vine.
“Do you love him?”
“He’s on dad-duty.”
“No,” she says, but she’s not looking at me.  “I can’t say I’m shocked, though.  There has been a lot of ill will towards anyone affiliated with Voldemort and his lot, since the War ended.”
“Whatever.  Goodnight, Draco,” Harry said, kissing Draco a little perfunctorily, and then rolling over so that he faced the wall.
the homework she assigned, and often found himself, sweaty and trembling, standing on his front step, trying desperately to muster the courage to apparate somewhere.  He’d found it strange at first that she’d sent him off to strictly Muggle destinations, but soon realized that the anonymity of the Muggle world allowed him to become more comfortable with exposure to the danger therein  After all, none of the Muggles were watching him fall apart, trying to enter a Library.
He wasn’t sure what to expect when he carefully dropped two precise drops of potion onto Harry’s neck, and cast the gentle Aguamenti, but Harry's tiny body going rigid and his eyes rolling backward wasn’t it.  “Jesus!  Jesus Fuck!” Draco cried, alarmed.
“When you ride a Muggle airplane, they always explain what to do in case of emergency.  For example, if the plane lost air pressure, masks fall from the ceiling, and the passengers are instructed to place them over their face, to help them breathe.  For those who are travelling with others, others who are unable to take care of themselves, the flight attendants insist that the person in charge affix their own mask first, before helping others.  Do you know why they do this?”  Draco shrugged, annoyed.  “It’s because, as the person in charge, you need to ensure that you
“I honestly have no idea.  She didn’t shout at me, and considering the rest of today, we’ll consider that a victory.”
“I’ll kill you!”  Draco seems to have abandoned his wand in favour of putting his hands around the man’s throat.  Hermione steps forward and pushes him off.
Anyway, what she says next firmly occupies my thoughts, so I don’t have time to worry about Hermione anymore.  “It isn’t your job, Harry.  Everyone has just gotten in the habit of telling you it is.”
We nap, and fool around again, and, after a shower, we’re lying in bed, eating toast that Kreacher has produced, when he says, “I still want to see your memories.”
“Same as always, mate.  Hold your head up, don’t comment, and let it blow over.”
He made his way to the potions cabinet, finding a hangover remedy and returning to the sitting room.  Harry had been sick again, and Draco vanished it quickly, casting a quick mouth-freshening charm.  “Here, drink this,” he whispered, again holding Harry’s head up and uncorking the potion.  Harry took a few swallows before shaking his head.  “Can’t,” he murmured.  “Going to sick again.”
“Draco, you had to do this?  You had to hurt me as much as you could?”
Draco flew through the quickest shower of his life, a stupid little ribbon of hope furling through his stomach.  He tried to temper it, but it was stubborn.  However, leaving the locker room, carrying his hockey bag, he suddenly feared that he’d imagined seeing Harry at all, that he’d find nobody waiting for him in the stands.
“Of course,” Snape demurs.  Harry is nearly out the door when Snape calls after him, “Potter?”
“Maybe not.  It kept me sane, though, for a long time.  A lot of stuff had…I dunno, hurt me, I guess, and I didn’t ever really work through things.  I was pretty messed up, when I got to Canada.  But then I had this baby, and she
Ron looks about to go off about something again, but Hermione breaks in.  “It’s just that…well, you haven’t ever said so, before this.  And since you have been dating Ron’s sister for the past several years, it’s a bit surprising.”
Astoria was keeping Scorpius distracted, and seemed to have the situation well in hand, so Draco pulled a chair to Cass’ bedside.  Harry was still speaking softly to her, his stubby fingers stroking her wild curls back.  “…and that’s because you’re the toughest little badass I know, Cassiopeia Potter.  This is a little harder than waking you up for school, although, Melin knows that’s hard enough.  It’s no wonder that you’ve no concerns about being a sleepyhead who is taking advantage of an opportunity to lie in.  But I’ll tell you one thing, little duck, when I was just a bit older than you, I refused to die, despite a whole passel of people who wanted me to, and you’ve inherited that Potter stubbornness, understand?  This isn’t going to be the end for us.”  He didn’t seem to notice Draco there, and for a moment, Draco thought he might be intruding, but he couldn’t leave his daughter’s side any more than Harry could.
One shelf, piled with a number of plush toys that had been Draco’s since he was small looked wrong.  The chimera was too close to the Hornback.  “Someone’s been in here,” he said, not registering that the words had been said out loud.  He quickly scanned the corners for shadows, and pulled Harry to stand behind him.
Andromeda and Teddy lived in a tiny cottage on the outskirts of a Wizarding Village.  They apparated there hand in hand, and walked the short distance to the cottage.  Harry threw the door open joyfully, calling “Andy?  I’ve brought a guest.”
“Not her.  I know you would.  I wanted to thank you for everything you’ve done for me.”
“Which of my children wishes to make the petition?” Her voice makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  It contains galaxies, and it’s loving, but lonely.
“Me too, Harry.  Be well, cub.”
“Oh god.”
“No,” Harry said patiently.  “I mean, I have magical friends for Scorpius.  I have a six-year old, and a nine year old, and a four-year-old and a three-year-old, just off the top of my head.  And, actually, I have another one, a little girl, who is about Scorpius’ age.”
Harry thought for a moment.  He’d never spent a night away from Cass before, but it would be good for her to spend time with Draco.  He stifled the disappointment of missing out on seeing her experience the places of his childhood, and managed a nearly-genuine smile.  “Yeah, of course, Draco.  I’ll speak to her tonight, and I can have Greg bring her over in the morning.  If anything comes up, I’ll owl you.”
“I want to go home.  Not to the yellow-haired human, to my real home.”
They’d grinned at one another, and the bargain was struck.  And somehow along the way, she’d become the most important person in his life, other than Scorpius.  They’d had exactly enough sex to produce Scorpius, and amicably gone their separate ways.  True to her word, Astoria was a wonderful Mother, and spent as much time as she could with Scorpius.  Her parents, and Draco’s Mother had been furious when they’d divorced, but there’d been no scandal, and neither Draco nor Astoria had allowed their parents to interfere.  Scorpius had done a lot to offset their parents’ collective disappointment as well, he allowed.
It was game time.  Nerves zipped through his body, and Draco bounced on his toes, feeling the way his blades bit into the ice.  He warmed up, pleased that a sizeable crowd had come to see the home opener.  Warm, focused, ready to go, he joined the pre-game huddle. The first line went on, and Draco settled on the bench, hydrating and awaiting a line change.  It came quickly, and Draco skated to the face-off line, tapping his stick against the gate three times for luck on the way.
“Yeah little duck?”
“No,” I say, feeling sad again.  “I don’t want to go home.  She might come back.”
As Juniper discussed break-room cleanliness, for the fourth week running, Harry stifled a snicker as Linden swiped distractedly at his ear.  Tamsin glared warningly at Harry, who bit his lip and looked away.  The meeting droned on, and Tamsin continued to plague Linden mercilessly.  Just as Linden caught a glimpse of the quill out of the corner of his eye, Harry quickly banished it with a wave of his hand, leaving Linden none the wiser.
Harry’s preparing him frantically, his index finger rubbing his prostate in time with his bobbing head.  He scissors Draco’s opening and when Draco can’t take the torture any longer he begs “Please Harry, in me, I’ll die if you don’t.”
They were quiet for a while, each of them thinking about their own lies and the way that they would inevitably change things.  “Honestly, we’re the worst,” Draco said miserably, after a while.
“Were there other elements that you wanted to protect her from?”
to be strong for you.  I
“No,” Hermione admits.  “But I think that public opinion would still have swayed in the direction of the Ministry.”
“What were you mad about?”  I barely notice, but he’s helping me up from the stool, throwing a pile of gleaming coins onto the bartop, and nodding at Hannah.
“What?  That someone would choose my Dad?” Her voice was challenging, and Draco realized he needed to tread carefully.
It was all arranged very quickly.  Papa made a few floo calls, and then, before she knew it, he was holding her hand tightly and stepping through the floo as he called, “The Burrow.”
“Yeah, she is.  And exhausting, and a pain in the backside.”
“Salazar, Potter, does she even have a parent?”  The words escaped Draco’s mouth before he could stop them.  He was completely unnerved by this new, mature Potter, who didn’t rise to his bait, who seemed to care so little about Draco that he practically ignored him.  But, he reasoned, Potter didn’t care about Draco, obviously, since he was able to walk away and start a new life, without a backward glance.
He doesn’t say anything, and I finally nudge him with my foot.  “Do you think my personality is missing its
“Please George,” Hermione begged, “could we just look at the lab, just to make sure?  Ginny stunned us and took Harry somewhere.”
“Yes.  Why are you just sitting here?”
“Nothing else to do, I suppose.”
“Having you defend him so passionately means the world to me, Harry.”  Harry looked up, confused.  Narcissa was smiling at him.  “The manner in which you chose to stand up for him may be a little unrefined, but the fact that you did is what will be remembered.  The press will certainly criticize you, and, perhaps, Draco, by extension, but the people will know that their Chosen One fought for Draco’s honour.  You have given him, and me, a tremendous gift.”
“I’m going to kill him.  He kept this from me for how many years?”
“Draco.  I don’t suppose we can just forget everything?  Pretend that you didn’t come here last night, pretend that I wasn’t a mess?  Shake hands and part as…well not friends, but with some sort of dignity?”
“A promise is a promise,” Draco said, and Harry smiled.  “I wondered if you wanted to talk about what happened?”
“Thanks.  I’m thrilled for me too.  How have you been?  It’s been ages since we caught up.  How’s Ron, and the rest of his family?”
“You have to say that.  You’re my dad.”
“That’s fine.  Magical Accidents, room four.”
Draco doesn’t tell her how right she actually is.  “I think,” he says carefully, “that Harry feels like he needs to do this on his own.”
Cass nodded.  “Yes, Dad is kind of into brooms.  He got us both the same ones that the Canadian National team uses.  They’re wicked fast.”
.  “This is strictly a political appointment.  You’re promoting me into a position I’ll be terrible at, to operate as a figurehead.”
“You’ve done better than I have,” Draco confided.  “I never managed to beat him, not in all the years we went to school.”
It wasn’t long before she felt a hand on her back.  “Cass?  Cheri, what’s the matter?”
“But Malfoy, is…well…” Hermione starts.
“And what,” Hermione said, “in your research led you to pursue this theory?”
Hermione gives me a potion, which I take after a nod from Draco.  It’s pleasant, tasting of mint, and I’m still licking my lips when she uncaps a vial, similar to the memories that she sent me earlier, only much larger.  She starts to incant in latin, and the silvery fluid rises out of the vial, and surrounds me.  I can catch glimpses of faces, and events, and colours, but soon the fluid coalesces into a misty veil that obscures my vision.  Hermione’s chanting grows louder, and the mist moves in closer.  I hold my breath at first, but as I’m forced to breathe, I inhale the mist.  A few breaths later, and my senses are overwhelmed with stimulation. It’s as though I’ve thrown myself into a pool filled with intense emotion, and physical sensations, and loud sounds.  I panic, trying not to breathe, but I feel a tap on my chest, and I’m heaving in vast gasps.  The sense of overwhelm increases, and suddenly, everything fades to comforting black.
Harry’s embarrassed by the tears that spill down his cheeks, but Ron isn’t.  “C’mere, you daft old softy.”  Ron’s strong arms make him feel safe in a way he hasn’t felt since…ever, maybe.
“Nope.  I was trying to arrest a potion smuggler, and I was obviously cursed, and knocked unconscious, and when I woke up, I could barely remember anything.”
“Not with each other,” she said immediately.  “I can’t bring another baby into this world knowing that they’d have a chance to being just as sick as Scorp.  It’s not fair, to either of them.”
Until, that is, they crossed the threshold into a crowd of people huddled around a blender on the counter.  That was when Draco realized that he’d walked into a lion’s den.  Literally, if the sea of Gryffindors were an indication.  “Guys, Draco’s here.  Be nice to him,” Pansy said airily, grabbing one of the red plastic cups from the island and stuffing it into his hand.  In unison, all of the faces turned to look at him, and Draco could feel heat rising up the back of his neck.
He was back quickly enough, and they flooed to the Manor.  Unsurprisingly, Narcissa had everything in hand, so they sat on the terrace with tea, awaiting any instructions.  “Does Cass usually have big birthday parties?” Draco asked.
“Basilisk scale.  How interesting,” Madame said, her face lighting up even more.  “This scale was one that Monsieur Ollivander had been saving.  It had been gifted to him by a former student, and Garrick said that one day, the recipient would arrive for it.”  She seized the scale, and went back to her worktop, humming and chanting to herself.  Cass was looking a little uncomfortable, but Draco smiled reassuringly at her.  It didn’t take long before Madame Lefebvre was passing her the wand, holding it by the tip.  “Would you try it?”
“You can’t possibly be asking this of us,” Harry said flatly.
“Draconus, please be reasonable.  I don’t mean you any harm” the tone of her voice suggested otherwise,  “but I care a great deal for Harry, and he is to be responsible for Teddy if anything should happen to me.  Surely you understand that this…fling cannot continue.  Harry has been promised to Ginerva since she was eleven years old.  This is his chance for the family he’s always wanted.  Why would you stand in his way?”
“Thank you darling.  But please, listen to me.  You need to talk.  You need to be honest with him about your feelings.”
“She’s not intolerable.”
me?”  Is this the kind of shit we get up to regularly?
“Wait!  Don’t you want to know who?” Draco asked.
-Scorpius has a magical outburst that requires a brief visit to hospital
“Nooo,” he says slowly.  “It was weird.  It’s not a curse, though.  I can feel the foreign magic that’s locking up the memories.  It’s like someone has created a vault, and shoved a whole bunch of stuff inside.  I can say for sure that you didn’t do it to yourself, and the magic isn’t malevolent.  It feels like healing magic, almost.”
As Draco stepped toward the floo, Lara said, “Draco?  You should be very proud of everything you’ve accomplished.”
2 Weeks
“You’re able to.  I don’t think that Draco has that luxury.”
“Yes, we separated shortly after Scorpius was born.”
“So did they,” Draco agrees.  “Which is why they passed a series of sneaky bills within the Wizengamot to ensure that what they were doing obeyed the letter of the law.  When some of my old housemates started to approach me, I helped them, in secret.  I smuggled people out of the country, and sold some of their family heirlooms to discreetly pay fines, using the Goblins to avoid being caught.  I’ve been very careful to ensure that nobody knew that I was helping them.  When they arrested Pansy on trumped up charges, I acted rashly, wasn’t as cautious.  Obviously someone figured out that I was the one who was helping.  And when they realized that I was seeing Harry, they got worried.  They sent me a warning last week to break ties with him, and to keep my nose clean, or they’d make me pay.”
“How?”
“Passable.  You had your ‘kick ass class for kick ass girls’ this evening?”
Harry’s words dislodged something in Draco that he hadn’t even realized existed. To his immense horror, he felt a prickling in his nose, and, before he knew it, enormous tears were rolling down his cheeks.  A sob popped out, followed by another, and suddenly, he was weeping, his forehead on the floor, feeling that he might die from the pain he was feeling.  He sort of hoped he would.  His crying was undignified, loud inelegant wails, but Draco was pretty sure he was never going to be able to stop.  Harry hovered above him, eyes wide, and impossibly green, unsure what to do, unprepared to deal with such unfettered anguish.  Tears swam in his own eyes, and finally, as no other options present himself, he settled next to Draco, wrapping himself around Draco’s heaving form and held on.
“But Mother, I’m not a child.  You can’t make decisions for me as though I were.”
everywhere with wild magic, and you don’t have to tell me how awful that was to explain to her Muggle babysitter.  So I had it down, right?  I was keeping her alive, and she was doing cool stuff, and talking, and she was potty trained.  And then I had to let her go to school, where complete strangers were in charge!  I nearly had a nervous breakdown on her first day of pre-kindergarten.  Severus was about to call Minerva to come and dose me with a potion.”
“No, I get it.  I don’t understand, I don’t have the same memories that you do.  It wasn’t fair of me to expect you to help.  Thanks for coming, though.”
“Oh, Cass, yes.  I loved him more than I loved myself, and for a spoiled brat like me, that’s a lot.  For a while, once we started dating, things were good.  We were hidden away from the world, in Harry’s Godfather’s house.  While we were insulated like that, it was perfect.  But life doesn’t allow you to stay hidden away forever.  Harry wanted to tell the world that we were together.  He’s not afraid of anything, you know?  He didn’t care what the consequences were.  But I’d watched the newspapers, and the stupid people in our society rip him apart for one thing or another since he was eleven years old.  I knew that they wouldn’t stand for their Hero consorting with a Death Eater.”
Cass didn’t know what to think about that.  She couldn’t understand how anyone could hate her Dad, and she especially couldn’t understand why someone would adopt a child that they didn’t love.  Papa continued, “When you’re little, and someone makes you feel like you aren’t good enough, it stays with you.  It makes you insecure.  And your Dad never could see how amazing he was.  So, when he found out about you, he was afraid that people wouldn’t let him keep you.  He thought that my family and I would insist that we raise you.”
“I don’t understand,” Ginny wailed.  “Why isn’t it working?”
“You wouldn’t,” she says.  We walk back into the house, and she immediately climbs the stairs.  Ron and Hermione look up at me from their seat on the sofa, and I shake my head the tiniest bit.  Ron’s face goes a bit thundery, and Hermione bites her lip.  It’s awkward, after that, the easy conversation that had been taking place when Ginny and I returned seeming to fizzle out.  I’m relieved when Ron and Hermione started making ‘time to go home’ noises.
“See, but it’s not ‘that bloke’,” Hermione reasons.  “
Harry's lips quirked a little.  "It means that when you promise something, it always comes true.  It's something Aunt Petunia always says.  Like, she'll say, 'You freakish boy, if you burn those chops again, I promise it will be a week with no dinner, and a promise is a promise!'  And then it
“He wasn’t so bad.”
“I don’t understand.  Please, Harry, explain to me.  I want to understand.”
“I’m fine,” he said, his voice coming out croaky.  “Sorry to scare you, little duck, I just lost my breath for a second.”  She petted his hair for a moment, looking at him closely.  Then she cast a filthy look at Draco, and slowly returned to sit by Scorpius.  As they resumed their chatter, she kept a wary eye on the discussion amongst the adults.
And so we do.  Ron and Hermione, still clutching her beaded handbag in one hand and her wand in the other.  Pansy, her face fierce beneath her hooded cloak.  And Draco, clutching me tightly as he side-alongs me.  I consider protesting that I can do this on my own, especially in light of the fact that he’s down a third of magic, but the panicked, pained look in his eyes convinces me otherwise.  Nobody’s bothered to tell me what can go happen if an apparation goes wrong.  How bad could it be?  It turns out not to matter, because the trip goes fine, even if I stagger around trying not to vomit afterwards.
“We were never going to last, though.”
“Yes, of course I know.  Go, Harry, before the Greengrass family comes with shotguns.  We’ll owl you when the heat dies down.  I love you too.  Go.  Be happy.”
“Of course.”
“No you aren’t.”
“No thank you,” Harry said.
I laugh.  “Am I?  Can you help me change that?”
“We fight all the time, and not in the way we used to.  At Hogwarts, we’d bicker, and it made me feel alive, it challenged me.  Now, it just makes me sad.”
Draco turned back to Astoria and Cici, and allowed himself one single moment.  He closed his eyes, and placed his head in his hands, and sighed, just once.  Then, he squared his shoulders and said, “Right then.  Options?”
“Thank you,” Draco said, taking a sip of water.  “We’ve been managing, since the diagnosis.  Scorpius is…well, you’ve met him.”
“’s nothing,” Harry mumbled, not looking at Draco.  “Thank Cass.”
“Draco?  What’s going on?”
Cass shrugged.  “I don’t know.  I just feel it.  My Dad wouldn’t leave me like this.  Not unless things were bad.  Like, really bad.  One time, he got hurt in his shop.  A tool slipped and he cut his hand open.  He showed up to pick me up from school with a towel wrapped around it, dripping in blood, because he didn’t want me to get scared if he wasn't there when school was over.  And the secretary is like, one of his best friends.  He could have left me there with her, but he came, because he didn’t want me to think he had forgotten me.  He needed fifteen stitches, Papa, but he dragged his stupid, bloody self to pick me up.”  Papa was watching her closely now.  He looked mad, but Cass knew he wasn’t.  He was just thinking hard.  “I don’t think he’s okay.  I don’t know what happened before he left, but he wasn’t normal.”
“I wanted to do those things with you.”
“I don’t know, Cass, but they do.  It’s stupid, but people have always been interested in me, because sometimes weird stuff happens to me.  Like the Parseltongue, and the way my mum saved me.  Then, I left with no warning, and of course the stupid newspapers made a big deal about that.  It only stands to reason that they’ll be intrusive now that I’ve returned.”  Harry gave her a reassuring smile.
“Oh thank Godric” Harry muttered, practically running through the door.  “How long until they wake up?”
“It isn’t really an investigation of you, at least not formally.  I’ll be looking into all aspects of Scorpius’ life, to make sure that he’s safe, and happy, and getting all of the support he needs.  It’s not a fishing expedition, Malfoy.”  And it wasn’t, Harry reminded himself.  He
Fuck, fuck, Harry,
The girl flushes.  “I just…I always wanted to meet you.”
“No,” Draco said kindly.  And that had nearly broken Harry.  The fact that Draco was being kind to him while he broke his heart.  “We’ve had a lovely time together, Harry, but that’s all it was.  It was never going to be more, just a lovely time, with someone I’m fond of.  I’m sorry if you thought differently.  I’d love to think that we could be friends.”
“You’re not an ideal babysitter,” Hermione grumbles.
“Thank you,” Draco replied.  “I didn’t realize that you’d ever seen me as a child.”
“I…Harry-”
“What?  What kind of a question is that?”  Harry glared at the reporter.  He was young, barely out of Hogwarts by the look of him, and Harry felt uneasy about the way that he was smiling at Draco.
“Harry.”
It was this confluence of events that had Harry nearing his breaking point as they flooed back to Draco’s house.  Cass had been ordered to take it easy, and she’d insisted that if she was going to be stuck inside, it wouldn’t be at Hogwarts.  Draco had offered up her room at his house, and Harry had hesitated.  His reluctance to leave her alone must have shown, because Draco had said, “You too, Harry, obviously.”
“I’ve never had a friend steal me before,” Harry replied.
“It’s family,” Cass said simply.
Harry sighed, pushed his fringe out of his eyes.  His gaze met Draco’s for a moment, then he bit his lip and looked away.  “Because, Draco.  I’m so fucking tired of this war, and losing so many people.  It’s been such a fucking waste.  You deserve more than to rot away in Azkaban.  I reckon that you were born into your role the same way I was.”
“Oh no.  There are owl spells?  Have I been hurting them this whole time?” I look at Mill, asking with my eyes for her to fix this.
She stands and rounds the table until she’s standing next to me.  “You’re a blessing, Harry Potter,” she murmurs into my hair as she pulls me into a hug.  I feel a bit uncomfortable by the raw emotion, so I tell them that I’ll have a solicitor contact them about the investments, and we agree that I can come and help out whenever I’m free.  Their beaming faces usher me from the store, and I walk down the alley with a spring in my step.
love anymore."
“My dear, I’m certain that you understand why that won’t work.”
Ron’s eyes are wide.  “I have no idea, mate.  What were you involved in?”
Harry laughs, “Either are you.”  She grips his face with both hands and lays a wet kiss on his forehead, then staggers off to torment Blaise about his relationship with Dean.
“Dunno.  You could hex me, if you wanted.  Or punch me out?  Hermione seemed to get a lot of satisfaction from that, once.”
“I’m glad to hear it.  I wanted to thank you for doing this.  I’ve seen such an increase in Amy’s confidence since she’s been coming here.  She was a bit timid before.”
“And I can’t really be mad at Mother.  She’s dying.  So that just leaves myself.”
Cass looked at her Papa in horror.  “You hated Muggles?  You thought that people like my Dad and my Grandma should be dead?”
I want a dog?”
“Am I?” Draco asked, in spite of himself.  “Well, that’s good.”  He didn’t really know what he was just in time for, so he looked around for Harry instead.  He finally found the dark hair in a sea of red, sitting by the fire, a red-haired baby Draco didn't recognize in his arms.  He had his back to the room, and seemed to be telling the baby a story.
“Of course not.  You say it’s been growing, right?”
“So,” she begins.  “The three best friends need to get the cursed goblet in order to destroy the worstest wizard of all time.  They search far and wide, and learn that the terrifying Bella has locked it away in her Gringotts vault.”
coming to my cabin in the woods. His pace slows, and eventually, he slips out, dragging himself to my side and wrapping his arms around me.  I turn to face him, kiss his lips.
Kreacher interrupts before Mill can even begin to respond, so we settle ourselves at the table and eat while we talk.  Violet is enchanted with Kreacher, who parks himself next to her, chattering away, and giving me the odd guilty glance.  “Kreacher,” I finally say, “are you giving me looks because you think you’re breaking the rules by hanging out with Violet?”
They begin with Wendell, and he dreamily confesses to his actions, while implicating about a dozen other members of the Ministry, who, entertainingly, go chalk-white and look like they want to run away.
“A sibling like me,” Cass said quietly.
“Hello, Harry, it’s wonderful to see you again,” Narcissa said sweetly, and Harry’s lip trembled for a moment before he stepped closer and allowed her to hug him.  Hugs weren’t common in Pureblooded families, but Narcissa had a knack for understanding when to sidestep convention.  She gently kissed his cheek, and his hands touched the spot before looking up in wonder.
“Really?” His face is suddenly joyful, and Draco can’t take another moment of watching this unfold before his very eyes.
“I’m glad to have seen you at all.  Harry-"
“Of course it’s my business.  Draco, I care about you-”
“That is strange,” Draco concedes.  “You’re their Great Saviour.  I’d expect that you’d have a whole wing of the Ministry cordoned off and full of researchers.”
“Yes, well, losing one’s shit like a commoner is very exhausting,” Harry says, and Draco grins at him, and shoves his shoulder.
“You quit your job?”  Mister Fortesque looks thunderstruck.  “But everyone says you’ll be the youngest Head Auror ever.”
“Okay,” Draco said, but his hands were tapping nervously at the table.
“And I have.”
“I don’t think I have a choice, do I?”  Harry was tired, which was ironic, since he’d, apparently, been asleep for a week.
“Draco, I’m not taunting you!”
The answering smile that Harry gave Draco was enough to convince him that this was worth it.
“Your dinner is prepared, Master,” Kreacher said, grandly sweeping his arm toward the table.
Scorpius shrugged. “She was colouring, just like everyone.”
The weather had finally turned temperate again, when Minerva arrived the following week.  Harry was working in his shop, sleeves rolled up, The Beatles playing on the record player he’d charmed to work around all the magic.  As always when he was working, time had slipped away from him, and he looked up in surprise when he heard Cass shouting from the back door of the house, “Dad! She’s here!”
“We’re fine, thank you,” Malfoy replied.
wanted Harry's attention, but he'd much rather have kissed him senseless than make him angry.
“No,” his Father says, his forehead wrinkled.  “I don’t think you are.”
happens like she says.  Promises are super important, Draco."
“No, Harry.  Harry.  Gods, you…Do you know what I see when I look at you?  I see someone who has been forced into one traumatic situation after another, who still manages to laugh and see the good in people.  I see someone who has had nearly everyone he’s loved taken from him, but who loves those he still has with an open heart.  I see someone who I’ve been fascinated with for my whole life, but who never stops surprising me.”
“How wonderful!” Mrs. Nott exclaimed.  “Thank you, Scorpius.”  Scorp grinned and presented her with the muffin he’d selected as though it were precious jewelry.  “Have a seat then, darling, Ms. Weasley-Granger will see you in just a moment.”
“Hug,” she said simply.  He rinsed and dried his hands, and then gathered her close.  As he stroked her hair, she clutched the hem of his jumper, as she always did, and breathed deeply.
“How old is he, do you think, Weasley?” Draco asked, still a little put out that Potter had been such a turncoat.
I pull the cork, and toss the liquid back.  It tastes pretty nice.  Raspberry, and something else that isn’t at all unpleasant.  Immediately, my head clears, and the room stops spinning and I’m fucking thrilled by this turn of events.  I smile up at him and he asks, “Better?” I nod.  “Now, can I go back to fucking sleep?”  I nod again, and he’s soon disrobed, and sliding in next to me.
of it.  The machismo ran heavy in the locker room, and although he was pretty sure nobody would fault him for it, he kept any campy inclinations to himself while in Canada.
Ron dismantled the wards, just as George came up the stairs.  “Oi, what are you doing?” His voice was indignant.  “You can’t go in there!”  He stopped short when he saw Draco, “Malfoy,” he said evenly, his voice losing a lot of its ire in place of curiosity.
been on watching Draco.  Probably the first time in his life that he and Draco had shared a room and Harry hadn’t been obsessed with what he was up to, he admitted to himself.
“Four and-a-half,” Scorpius replied.
“Of course not,” Harry agreed.  “Something unusual happened to Amy, though, right?”
“Dunno,” I say.  “Try not to get mad? I expect not working for the nutters at the Ministry will help.”
There’s an older man standing over a cot, waving his wand and muttering something to a quill that hovers over his head, scribbling onto a parchment.  As he hears the curtain, he turns around.  “Unspeakable,” he says mildly.
“Yes.” Draco looked uncharacteristically ill at ease.  “I was unprepared for your return, and the situation was exacerbated by my worry over Scorpius’ health.  I didn’t react well to learning about Cass.”
“I hope to fix this before he has a chance to call me anything,” Draco answered.  Harry’s enormous eyes fixed on his, and he extended his hands towards Draco.  With a sigh, Draco reached over and, surpassing a shudder, took the baby, nearly dropping him when he noted that his elaborate dress robes were encrusted with food.
“Merlin, Draco, I can’t believe how close I was to making the biggest mistake of my life.”
Harry flinches, but continues.  “It’s um…for Teddy, actually.”
“I still say we should skip it,” Ron says. “Solidarity with Harry, and all.”
He moved on to Mrs. Sanders, and, once his suspicions had been validated, he proceeded to make a series of complicated wand movements that would transfer the memories directly to the recording cube.  The couple was watching him intently from their places on the sofa, terror obvious in their expressions.  Harry ignored them, methodically calling for an apprehension squad who would take them in for more extensive questioning, and, if required, proceed with legal actions.  Harry then conjured his Patronus and smiled thinly as Prongs erupted from his wand, scanning the room for danger.  “Lu,” Harry said.  “I’ve one for you, tonight if possible.  Let me know.”  Prongs bowed his head and bounded through the nearest wall.  Presently, a shimmering hare bounded through the wall and said, “I’ll put the kettle on, Harry.”
“Potter,” Pansy’s voice was friendly, and something about her tone made Harry feel a touch unsettled.  Pansy didn’t really
Just saying her name opened the floodgates.  Astoria’s huge blue eyes filled with tears.  He knelt between her knees, and held her chin with his hand, while wiping her tears away with the other.  “Dray, I’m so scared,” she wept.  “I don’t know what to do.”
Caring for a baby, it turned out, was much more difficult than it appeared to be.  Potter seemed happy enough to sit and contemplate his fingers while Weasley and Draco had been talking, but the moment Weasley flooed away, he set his enormous green eyes on Draco’s face expectantly.
“It’s nice to meet you,” Cass said happily.  “My Dad, well, my other Dad, has told me so much about your shop, and I always wanted to see it.  Did you know Mister Ollivander?”
“And hearts broken, by the sounds of things.”
“Did you use Ashwinder Eggs in your love potions, when you were brewing them?”
By the time September rolled around, everyone he knew was working or in school, and Harry still had no idea what he wanted to do.  His parents’ vault ensured that he didn’t have to work, but Harry knew he would want to do
Instead, Ron and I entertain Scorpius with the bubble charm.  Ron is excellent with babies.  I’m still pretty unsure what to do with him, but Scorp is a nice enough little fellow, and he puts up with most of my nonsense.  He babbles happily as he reaches out to pop the bubbles I’m producing.  I’m surprisingly relaxed.  There’s nothing I can do to change things, so I’m happy to go with the flow.  Fortunately, Ron doesn’t seem to want to talk about feelings or anything.  He’s a restful friend to have, despite my complicated feelings about his wife.
“Blooming, Min, as are you.  You look wonderful.”
“I don’t know.  But it doesn’t sound like he’s over you any more than you’re over him.”
“How’s work?” Harry asks, leaning on the counter.
“Harry,” he said, looking down at his hands, trying to be kind, despite the disappointed voice inside him that was wailing in dismay “I…” He sighed, examined his hands again, and tried once more.  “I care about you so much…”
Then, a tall, beautiful blonde woman was standing in front of him, and he recovered, and said, “Mrs. Malfoy, it’s very nice to meet you.”
He laughs.  “We don’t all dress like we’re homeless, Potter.”  He looks me up and down.  “Although, it seems that someone finally taught you how to buy clothing that fits you.”
“Hey Rosie,” Harry answered, just as quietly.  The little girl standing on the steps had her father’s fiery red hair, and her mother’s brown eyes.  She moved quickly, and burrowed her face into Harry’s middle.  “Alright?”
Pansy looked at him for a long moment.  “And what about yourself?”
“You don’t mind if Cass comes with Astoria?”
“Can we see him?” Draco asked.  He knew that Cass would need to see that he was okay, and Greg’s explanation of Harry’s state when he’d found him had left Draco needing to see him as well.
Harry looked as though he’d been slapped.  Hard.  Draco felt a tingle of unease.  Perhaps he’d stepped out of line, just slightly.  He didn’t have time to explore this thought, because his daughter descended on him like an avenging angel.  “What’s your problem?”
“Does it?”  I have no understanding of what she’s saying, but I’ve learned that with Luna, sometimes, just letting her ramble is as effective as trying to follow.
“Lookit, can you just come through for a minute?”
“The extraction isn’t exactly comfortable, but we’ll use a sleeping draught to make sure that we offset any discomfort Cass might encounter.  She will feel a little bit of tenderness around the extraction site after she awakens for as long as a week afterwards, but again, we’ll manage that using potions.  Within a few weeks, her body will have regenerated the bone marrow.”
“Yes, well…” Draco trailed off.  There wasn’t much to say.
“You would?” He smiles at the surprise in my voice.
“It’s not as though I had a choice,” Draco replied, a little defensively.
“Yeah.  I don’t know his floo-thingy, though.  Can you send one of those glowy ghost animals?”
“No,” I say.  “That doesn’t mean I’m not interested in how your day is going.”
He sat on the other side of Harry, who was now staring straight ahead with wide, terrified eyes.  Harry cast Tempus and Astoria laughed.  “It’s been fifteen minutes, Harry,”
Of course he sees.  “Harry, I can’t do this to you.  We’re breaking our hearts, doing this.  It’s never going to be easier.”  He stands, spells himself clean with a harsher than needed Scourgify.  “I can’t come back, Harry.  It’s too hard.”  He stops for a moment at the doorway, his face immeasurably sad.  “Be happy, Harry.”
Draco didn’t respond.  He’d broken himself as well.
“Huh?”  Draco knew that he was being inarticulate, but his confusion outweighed any of the long-ingrained Malfoy manners at the moment.
“Does it matter?  Do you want to finish the season?”
“Because if I do bad things, and hurt someone, then the Aurors are going to blame my Papa for that, and they will put him in Azkaban.”
“Slytherin, that’s the Hogwarts House, right?  The ones who are smart and ambitious?”
“Harry, we were grooming you for his position.  We’ve had this succession plan in place for almost a year.”
I shrug again.  “They’ll call me if they find something.  They didn’t seem very optimistic.”
“I’m not sure.”  With such a promising endorsement, I’m not sure how to pivot this to more flirtation, but, of course, the wine waiter arrives, and Malfoy tastes the vintage, pronounces it excellent, and we’re left regarding one another again.  “So,” he finally says, “you’ve been cursed.”
“And how long will I be under investigation?” Draco asked, and he didn’t look angry, like Harry would have expected.  He looked defeated.
“Harry.”  Ugh, why had Draco called him Harry? In a situation like, this, where all he wanted was to preserve some semblance of his dignity, the correct address was 'Potter'.
“Never mind, Potter,” a voice from behind me says.  “I didn’t for a moment assume that you’d think ahead to book something.  Reservation for Malfoy.”  He directs the last sentence to the host, who looks so relieved that he won’t have to turn me away that he amps up the fawning as he leads us to the table.  He spends a distressingly long time ensuring I’m seated in my chair, and pats the napkin onto my lap with great care, which is embarrassing.  Draco watches the production with amusement, his beautiful eyes dancing.
After a few hours of catching up on gossip, Harry excused himself to the kitchen to prepare dinner.  The chatter continued from the living room, but Harry relished the opportunity to work, alone with his thoughts, for a few minutes.  He chopped vegetables, and made a stew methodically, allowing the repetitive movements to soothe him.  He loved Minerva as much as he would have loved his own Mother, but having her here, in his home, left him feeling unsettled.  She represented the world he’d fled, and when it encroached on the safe space he’d created for himself here, he was left feeling panicky, threatened.
Draco tapped the parcel with his wand, and unwrapped the parchment.  It was a huge volume.  “What is this?”
“You,” I say.  We’re standing at the apparation point now, and I can’t remember that we’ve walked here.
After a hearty tea, and long after Narcissa has taken Scorpius for his nap, Draco finally decides that Hermione’s methodology is sound enough.
I laugh.  “You want me to hate you?”
“I’ll just keep asking, then,” Harry replies, and he reaches into his pocket, removing a second boxed cupcake.  It’s not as pretty as Draco’s, but it’s still an acceptable specimen.  “For you, Grace,” he says setting it on her counter.
“Thanks Kattie.”
Draco sequesters Hermione for a detailed review of her research, and the planned procedure for restoring my memories.  I know I’d be welcome to listen, but to be honest, I’d likely understand less than half of it, and I trust Draco to stop her if she’s doing something ill-advised.
“He always seems to make it work.”
He smiles then, but it’s chilling.  “Then, I found out that he was dating Harry Potter himself.  I couldn’t target him directly, not with the Chosen One being directly in his pocket.  But that created bigger problems to solve.  You, of all people know that we couldn’t allow someone like Potter to be tainted by Malfoy’s darkness.”  He directs this last sentence directly to Hermione, and my instincts flare, and my bad feeling gets a lot worse when she flushes and looks guilty.
“Don’t we always?”  It’s true.  Gin and Muggle music have gotten them through several of the major crises in their lives.  When Hermione lost her first pregnancy.  When Harry dropped out of the Aurors, and then dropped out of society.  When Andromeda suggested that Harry might be a little too unstable to take an active role in Teddy Lupin’s life.  When Hermione had gotten into a screaming match with Molly Weasley over the way she ran her marriage.  Gin and Muggle music has become a staple.  “Where’s Ron?”
“Who, Theodore Tonks?”
, his mind said,
“He didn’t keep you, dad.  Why would he want me?”
It’s only later, as the thoughts are still running through my mind, that I think about Hermione and cringe.  It’s not the same thing, not exactly; we fought because I resented her implication that I can’t make my own decisions, not because I was determined to help the Slytherins.  But I was taking a moral stand against someone who I know loves me.  And I did make her feel awkward by asking her to help with Parkinson.  Fuck.  I’m not totally in the right, and the realization annoys me.
She gives me a long look, which makes me uncomfortable, so I change the subject.  “Anyhow, thanks for coming by.  Did you have any news about the curse?”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione asked.  Harry didn’t seem to hear her at first, so firmly were his eyes locked with Draco’s.
“No choice,” Astoria answered, shrugging.  “Also, we drink.  Quite a lot.”  Her smile demonstrated that it was a joke, but her eyes were sympathetic.
“Draco, trust me, after my Gran died, I thought I should be alone.  It was awful.  Harry came and brought me back to his place, and it helped.” Longbottom’s face was incredibly kind.
“Yeah, alright.”  For some reason, even though I can’t remember a lot of the incantations for spells, anything that’s wandless or action-based is easy.  Muscle memory, I suppose.  It’s still not perfect though, as I wind up way down the wrong end of Diagon, and have to jog to the alleyway behind Wheeze’s, where we’ve agreed to meet.  As soon as I get there, I say, “I need to grab some Galleons.  Okay for a quick stop at…” I struggle to remember, and then pluck the name from my mind, “Gringotts?”
Cass’ eyes were enormous, filled with fear and sadness.  Draco wondered how to explain.  She was a little girl, and for her, the world was still dark and light with no twilight in the middle.  She hadn’t yet been exposed to the cruelty of life, the pain that exists in the hazy grey in between right and easy.
So it was no surprise that as the night progressed, it was him, Dean Thomas, Cho Chang (real dark horse, that girl) and Harry Potter still perched on stools around the island, while the rest of the party had left or passed out.  Harry still hadn’t spoken directly to Draco since their awkward  encounter when Harry had come home, but Dean and Cho were compensating for the tension by being extra friendly.  Draco was inventing a new drink with spiced rum and some Muggle lemon soda.  It was delicious, even if the strength of the mix resulted in Cho sicking into a plant and being taken to bed by a wobbly Dean.
“He’s sleeping,” Mrs. Sanders said shortly.
His bulbous eyes light up, and I swear he’s crying a bit.  “Master Harry is no longer with the Blood Traitor?  And he wants Kreacher to cook for his date!  And Master Harry will have a child for poor old Kreacher to take care of!”
Hermione arrived, with Ron and Rose, a few minutes later.  She and Draco disappeared down into the lab, under the auspices of preparing the potion.  “How are you holding up?” Hermione asked, the moment they’d warded the door.
“Don’t,” he says sharply.  “Harry, I’m barely hanging on.  If you’re kind to me right now, I’ll fall apart and I won’t get through this.”
“I don’t?  Well, that seems typical of me,” I say, and I can hear the anger in my voice.
“It can’t be good, right?”
“He just doesn’t understand,” Draco said.  “I’ll explain it to him.  It will be okay. You mustn't punish yourself, and that's an order.”
“So what happened?”
Scorpius regarded him a little balefully.  “Yes, Papa, we’re going to see the Vampire, and then you’ll get me a new book, but only if I’m good, and only if I don’t cry.”
“Heyy,” Harry said softly, wanting nothing more than to give this tiny, hurting child a hug, but keeping his distance. “It seems like you feel sad about that.”
“Kreacher will be helping, then,” he says, as though it’s an enormous burden, but he’s prepared to face it.  Bit of a martyr, this one.
“Thank you for coming in to see me,” he says.  He looks a bit uncomfortable, and, although I’m not sure why my instincts tell me to do so, I decide not to make this easy for him.  I nod, and wait.  “I want to start out by assuring you that this conversation is not an official discussion, just a friendly chat with someone who has always had your best interests at heart.”
“You already are,” she whispered.  “Help me get Harry back, and I’ll never be able to repay you.”  The tears spilled over her lashes, and she choked back a sob.
, Harry?”
“I wish things had been different, Dragon.”
The little fellow appears right away, looking a bit too earnest for my liking.  “Master Harry called his good house elf?”
Harry laughed.  “Of course not, I got a bloody nose and a month of detention, but I did give the other kid a black eye before he got the best of me.  It was so stupid, and I knew it was stupid, and Dudley didn’t even care, he was mad that I made him look weak, but I couldn’t
Draco leafed through the pages, watching a younger Harry and a tiny Cass as she threw mushy baby food at the camera and danced at a ballet recital.  There was an excellent photo of a tea party with her Uncle Professor’s portrait.  Draco noted, with some amusement, that Severus was wearing something that looked like Augusta Longbottom’s vulture hat for the occasion.  It was a decade told in events, a widely smiling baby sporting her first tooth, a beaming four year old on her first day of school, and, Draco’s favourite, a serious looking Cass bowing in a karate gi.  There were birthdays (which did look shockingly elaborate), and Christmases, and first broom rides, a tiny Cass on skates, wobbling across the ice after a puck, all peppered with Harry’s messy handwriting as he explained each one.
“It’s not so simple…”
Some time later, Pansy wobbles over to him, and sits beside him.  “Potter,” she says.  “Thanks for, you know, stuff.  You’re not so bad.”
“I don’t want this for our family.  I don’t want my daughter to have some dangerous power that we have to keep hidden.  I don’t want her to go away to a school I can’t visit, and I don’t want strange men with sticks coming by to wipe my neighbours’ memories.”
“Oh!”  I grin at her, delighted.  “You’re Millicent, then?”
“Professor, I’m kind of scared,” he had admitted, ashamed to be representing his House so poorly.
Harry is different.  He’s put on a little weight, a little muscle, lost the skeletal, foot-in-the-grave look he had when Draco last saw him.  His eyes are clear, and bright.
“I’ll do my best,” Draco said.
“Did you tell him so?”
For a split second, he thought about telling Harry exactly how he felt.  Then, he remembered.  He wanted to do the right thing.  Cursing his stupid, stupid, recently developed conscience, he realized, it would be temporary anyway.  He might have Harry for a day, maybe a couple of days, but Ginevra’s terrible potion would wear off, and Harry would hate him for having taken advantage of him.  The worst part was, if he tried to convince Harry that he was under the influence, he’d never believe Draco.
“Hmm, yes, it’s been commented on before.”
“Maybe.  But tea first.”
“Wotcher, Harry,” Weasley said.  The baby grinned at him, and reached with grabby hands.  Ron cancelled the levitation spell but left the bobblehead, and picked him up.  “So,” he told Draco, “I told the Ministry that Harry had to help a sick family member.  Thank Merlin that Robards has no interest in the fact that we have actual personal lives or he’d know that Harry
The silence stretched out between them, until Kreacher muttered something that Harry could barely hear, but he made out the words ‘Number Ten’.
“Yes, darling, you did wonderfully.”
“I see,” Harry said.  “Given that he has two magical parents, I wondered why he was attending a non-magical school?”
“We thought we’d come downstairs and see you,” Hermione said cheerfully.  “Harry, can you say hi to Draco?”
“No,” Draco said shortly.  He didn’t have any, as they’d all been freed by the Ministry as part of the reparations after the war.
“Well, I will be, shortly.  But off-ice training is important too.  I need a strong core to support me.  I just have one more thing to finish before I hit the ice, okay?  Do you want tea, or breakfast?”
“Point.”  I view the picture more closely.  It was clearly taken last night as Draco rescued me from the Leaky Cauldron.  I’m barely on my feet, and Draco’s half dragging, half carrying me towards the apparation point.  Worst of all is the way, just before the picture loops again, I look up at Draco.  Fuck.  Ron’s right.  I’m at very least smitten-adjacent.
“You taste so fucking delicious, Harry.  I can’t wait for you to come down my throat,” Draco muttered around Harry’s cock. He sucked Harry completely, opening his throat, while his hand cupped Harry’s balls.  Harry was panting now, his cock so hard that Draco knew he wouldn’t last long.  Good, he thought.  His finger stole below Harry’s balls, pressing firmly until he found what he was looking for, and Harry jerked.  Redoubling his efforts, Draco sucked harder, making sure his teeth were sheathed by his lips.
“I’m sure you had your reasons.”
“I didn’t mean to!”  The little girl burst into tears.
“I don’t know.”
“Hey, little duck,” said Harry.  “Did you have a nightmare?”
“Yes.  Yes.  I want that.  I want you.”  Draco knew he was babbling, but he was so fucking relieved.  He’d been given his life back.
.”  Scorpius grinned.
Vincent Peachley, in an ill-conceived flight of fancy, corners him in an alcove one evening.  Harry’s eyes are wide as Peachley draws closer to him, and as his arms grip Harry’s and a strong leg insinuates itself between his thighs, Harry panics.  He pushes Peachley away, and the Defence Master, startled, falls on his arse, looking up at Harry in confusion.  Harry’s magic swirls around him, his unpreparedness for the situation making him dangerous, a snapping live wire downed from a pole.  “I do not understand,” Peachley says, gaping at him.  “I thought that you were single.”
Astoria’s owl had asked Harry and Cass to meet them at their flat in London before the appointment with Scorpius’ Healer.  Harry smoothed his robes again as he prepared to step through the floo.  “Ready, Cass?”
“No, don’t be stupid, Mill.  Don’t go home, not if you don’t want to.  Don’t worry about the fees.”
“Or Harry Potter?” Lara asked, smiling gently at him.  “And that, right there, is why this isn’t a healthy course of action.  Your past is behind you.”
“Are you okay?”
“Really?”
“I think that might be the problem.  I think that’s what Luna meant,” he says gently.
“I don’t know what would happen.”
Oh.  Oh no.  “Darling, wouldn’t you like a different sort of story?  This one doesn’t end happily.”
sexual tension?”  They look at me a bit strangely, and I say, “Did you not know anyone else who fought like cats and dogs and it turned out that they just really, really wanted to shag?”  They exchange a bit of a look at that, and I inwardly applaud myself for guessing right.  These two are chalk and cheese, and her being as bossy as she is, and him with that temper, there’s no way that they weren’t a living example of the same bloody thing.
