With one sentence, Draco made Pansy and Blaise freeze suddenly. Even the silence of the night was surprised to hear that. "WHAT?!" they shouted at the same time.
Luna smiled sweetly. Draco always knows how to make Luna smile, and Draco loves her smile. It makes Draco smiled too. Then his eyes turned to a man standing behind Luna. The hair on his neck immediately stood up. Harry's arrival took him by surprise. Not because he was afraid of the man, but because Draco was afraid that Harry would hear Luna's words.
"I still won't leave the Spartan Prince. I quite like him, and I brought him to Olympus with no ease. I don't want my investment to go to waste." Ares reiterated.
Harry's head was spinning when Draco bent his innocent body so he could lift a brown pant higher to his hips.
Harry's expression gave Draco goosebumps. The vision of himself being killed by Harry crossed his mind. It made Draco really dizzy, and he wanted to puke.
Many couples have come down to the dance floor in the ballroom. The ladies in their beautiful dresses and the gentlemen in their stiff suits collided elegantly on the dance floor. Apparently, they have too carried away with the romantic atmosphere created by that famous orchestra group that they didn't notice that a young man was staring at them with a sparkling gaze.
"Yes, I know. However, the extra wages I'm referring to are not from royal money or levies from the people."
Both Charles and Draco then danced to each other to the rhythm of various musical instruments from the orchestra. They continued dancing until Charles reluctantly had to release Draco's body so they could change partners.
Harry's face hardened. “Yes. I know what drug it is. And I refuse to use Draco under the influence of drugs. You did it yourself without asking for my permission. You know if I get angry, I can punish you."
Draco's dazzling silver eyes opened wide when he heard Glenice's offer. He then nodded his head in an enthusiastic gesture, a move that a queen of a large kingdom shouldn't be doing.
Amid his nervousness, Draco continued to walk gracefully. The older man's bored gaze didn't make Draco take his eyes off the older man. He kept looking at the older man.
One of Harry's hands reached out carefully to remove the white cloth, slowly but surely turning red because of the wound.
Draco turned his head. "Ah, you're Potter's friend, right? Sorry I have no kind of affinity for you, whatever it is." Draco tried to explain.
"Come on, honey, let's say goodbye to the host," Ron nodded at Draco, then tugged at his wife's waist to follow him.
But the young prince decided to pile up the pillows on the floor immediately and continued his sleep without saying anything. It was as if he didn't think of Ares as a husband, let alone a lover. At least he had to remember that he was the God of War.
Her cry grew louder. Harry couldn't do anything but gently caress her back, which was already shaking violently from her cries, and whispered soft words in the ear of his mistress.
There were only five of them, yet each of them could fight more than ten people. Counted there were more than two dozen Spartan fighters who fell. Most of them looked daunted by the sight of the weapons they were using. None of the weapons scratched their skin, but the warriors fell and were thrown to the ground.
Draco looked away, suddenly saddened by how lucky Hermione was compared to him. The woman looked so happy and carefree. As for himself, he didn't even know what he means to Harry. Draco's eyes filled with tears as he imagined the failure of his plans to kill that man, which ended up trapped in the demon's embrace.
All Cedric had to do was wait for that moment to come. And he will be waiting for him because he sincerely loves Draco, who has become the mother of his children.
Draco was just about to open his mouth to say "winged, horned creature". But Draco keeps his tongue from commenting any further. Then he walked out of the house irritated. That man asked Draco to love him, but how could Draco love him if his attitude was annoying.
With a bit of a grunt, Harry pulled on his light robe and covered Draco's bareback with the soft cloth. Draco flinched and stared at his husband's face, which was for some reason adorned with the flames of intense anger.
"It seems that you are quite intelligent and wise, prince of Sparta. You will indeed be my wife, and I will try to make you comfortable living here. But there are boundaries that you must not cross. I will discuss it another time. Alastair! Accompany him around or direct him to his room. Or maybe you want to continue your sleep, prince of Sparta?" Ares smirked at him.
Draco slumped against the shower. He has reached the point where his body could not take it anymore, completely out cold from his orgasm. Harry admired his work before slowly pulling out to clean himself and his lover.
Draco turned his attention from the embroidery threads in the basket to the girl's cotton cloth. He couldn't help but smile in amusement as he looked at the abstract patterns on the cotton fabric.
"What's fair? He's just a mortal while you're the mighty God of War Ares thousands of years old, aren't you ashamed?" Athena denied.
"Ah, yes. Thank you, Your Majesty." Said Draco. Harry started to walk his feet towards the soft lounger not far from the bed.
Draco lifted his head, his eyes colliding with the night sky filled with stars competing with each other to show off their rays to all the inhabitants of the earth. Until Draco felt his back suddenly warm, a cloak of wolf fur landed on Draco's narrow back.
With care and gentle movements, Draco wrapped the peach-colored satin scarf around Arabelle's slender neck. As much as possible, Draco hid the dirty tracks so no one could see.
Ah, even in that dream, Draco could clearly feel Harry's gentle kiss on his forehead before that man left.
Draco excitedly entered the room and stood in awe while scanning the books on the shelves. Potter is apparently a fan of classic literary books; the various books seemed tempting, ready to be savored.
Oh, sure! Harry's gaze at him was like an eagle about to eat his prey, a rabbit. Draco felt it natural that he wanted to protect himself.
"It's okay. Now, you can go back to your room and ask the maid to apply some ointment so the spots can disappear quickly," Draco suggested as he gently stroked Arabelle's dark strands.
"Okay. You will not be disappointed that you have hired me to kill Harry Potter." The telephone hung up, and Tom chuckled in the dark. Downing his drink, for the early celebrations.
"Hopefully, Madam's daughter can be successful this season," Draco said kindly and flashing his best smile.
With a growl, he pulled Cedric's back so that he couldn't help but turn Cedric's body away from Draco.
Draco winced at the statement. If only his instincts hadn't ordered his legs to retreat backward, it would have been certain by now his neck would have been covered in blood.
As he walked through the central royal garden, Draco's eyes were pampered with the dandelion flower beds that had become the hallmark of this kingdom. From the book Draco had read, the founder of this kingdom named his kingdom the Kingdom of Delion because dandelion flowers thrive in many places in this kingdom.
Draco breathed in relief. “Yes, I feel a little nauseous and dizzy. But don't worry, I'm fine." Draco smiled.
God knows he's been trying to save this boy. But somehow, this blonde had such a strong determination to harm him until he forgot that he had already challenged the most dangerous man.
Draco tries to start hitting Harry again and again when Harry's hand catches his wrist. He sees Harry differently now. A wing expands behind the man's back. The wings are white, clean, and look tremendous. It's as if he could blow Draco off with his wings. Then Draco also sees two horns above Harry's head. Like an animal's horn, the difference is that it gives off a dark and fiery aura.
. He didn't understand how his soul could transfer to the body of another young man who lived two thousand years ago. A bit of his logic still believed that maybe he was involved in a super-sophisticated and expensive television entertainment project.
"Another man, huh?" Draco muttered with his eyes fixed on the towering trees not far from where he was sitting.
"Why are you suddenly being kind and asking me that?" Draco asked curiously as he pulled out a chair for him to sit on.
"No. If I'm hurt, I’ll always try to get that woman out of the palace." Draco said confidently, taking a step forward which made Cedric take a step back. After all, he had no intention of hurting Draco.
"Where have you been?! Why didn't anyone tell me that Draco had a fever?!" He shouted angrily. "And you, Alden! I warned you to monitor him. Why did you let him walk around the garden when he was sick?!” Harry growled.
Narcissa immediately ignored all of her work and walked over to Draco. She hugged Draco tightly and caressed his head gently. "I'm always with you," she stated reassuringly.
"Spending this one day just with you, without being bothered by anyone," Harry replied, kissing Draco's forehead gently, making him smile.
Harry only stared at him for a few tense moments, then nodded his head. "Bring one, my usual drink."
When the door to his room was opened from the outside, Draco had no idea that Harry was the one who entered. That man had utterly ignored him lately. Draco hardly even saw the man, except the scene when Harry entered his car on the lower terrace visible from the second-floor window where Draco was locked up.
"Your majesty, don't you want to dance?" invite the young man in the end while spreading his charming smile to his husband.
"Don't play dumb! You know I love you! How long are you going to ignore me, huh?!" Cedric's yell echoed in front of Draco's beautiful face. "Until when?!?" His shout was accompanied by the sound of lightning striking so violently.
Pansy remained patient. It was a little difficult to be sensitive among those who were insensitive. "Potter
"Huh? Why are you playing romantically with humans until you marry them? Just sleep until you get bored and then leave like you do your other human lovers!" snapped Aphrodite emotionally.
"What do you think I should do, Potter? You are my enemy, and although now I decide to cooperate a little by not trying to escape, you are still my enemy. And when I feel that my condition got better, I still demand to be released."
"Do you know why he is doing this, Athena? I did repeatedly force him to marry but not to humans!" Zeus said again, disappointed.
The window was open, and the dim light reflected from it, so clear. Harry stared at the window in frustration. The young man was over there, and Harry should have him undoubtedly. But the blonde's attitude made him feel like a disgusting bastard when he forced his will on Draco.
Bound and helpless, Draco watched as Harry took off his shirt and half crushed him. His mouth was so close to Draco's that their breaths collided. Harry lowered his head, kissed the side of the blonde's neck, made Draco arching his back, and try to struggle again.
Harry took it, glanced over the familiar Incident Report form, saw the name of the victim, and felt the blood drain from his cheeks. “Fuck.”
Draco watched his mother swanning about the room with regal charm and thought she was doing no such thing, but he didn’t bother to argue.
Pain and frustration made him reckless. He flicked his wand at Harry, knowing it was a colossally bad idea to attempt magic in his current state but not giving a fuck, and was surprised to see a halfway decent Stinging hex fly from its tip.
Slipping a hand up Draco’s back to clasp his neck just above his collar, Harry let a trickle of reassurance pass through his fingers and into his love’s overstressed body. Draco felt it. His shoulders loosened slightly and he lifted his chin, tilting his head back against the support of Harry’s hand.
He slid his hand into his pocket and twirled the wand. It warmed to his touch and he felt a moment’s regret at the thought of giving it up. It liked him. It wouldn’t want to go to another, even someone it knew. Then he quashed that thought and straightened his shoulders.
He was circling the cramped space like a starving vulture, gnawing on his thumbnail, privately cursing himself for a bloody fool, when he heard the distant grind and clank of a lock turning. He flew to the front of the cell and gripped the bars ’til his knuckles whitened, wishing that his head was smaller or the cell bars set wider so he could see what was going on at the far end of the corridor.
Harry laughed, and the flames leaping in his eyes abruptly died down to a warming glow. “Careful. Don’t give away any secrets.”
“And, ahh…” Lucius paused with his hand on the doorknob and turned his cold eyes on Draco again. He had assumed a casual air, as if tossing off a just-remembered point, but Draco was not fooled. This was why he had taken the extraordinary step of coming to his son’s bedroom in person to deliver his instructions.
Draco recognized him instantly and tried to detach himself from Ginny’s grip. Dennis Creevey was probably the last person he wanted to encounter today. Especially in that particular spot.
"How can you… how can you do that to someone you've known since she was born? She's a pureblood wizard, from a fine old family, everything you say you respect…"
"How do you make me feel like a leper one minute and the King of the World the next?" Harry murmured into silver-gilt hair tickling his cheek.
Draco had always loved green, especially when paired with silver. Slytherin colors. But he was anxious to put aside his old habits with his old name, to throw off the taint of snobbish pureblood values so closely linked to his old House and start afresh. New name, new life, new colors.
“I do not wish to be personal, Mr. Potter. This is, as Mr. Bloodworth has pointed out, a criminal hearing and not the place for irrelevancies, but I feel I must ask. Are you…
They spent the afternoon with Hagrid, drinking tea, gnawing inedible scones, and tramping through his vegetable patch in search of some rodents that had been nibbling on the vines. After that, they flew around the Quidditch pitch for a bit, just to feel the wind in their faces and see the ground streaking by below them. All in all, it was a perfect day.
"Don't worry, Poppy. Young Mr. Malfoy will not get his hands on it." He flourished the wand, and a funny, squat little table on crocodile legs appeared beside the bed. At his gesture, Madam Pomfrey set down the thing she held on it.
Harry sighed and tightened his hold on the body in his arms, lifting Draco nearly off his feet. They kissed long and deeply, while their bodies moved eagerly together and their cocks filled. By the time they broke apart, Harry was intensely grateful for the concealment of his robes.
“You’ll love Grimmauld Place! It’s dark and dingy and full of Black Family rubbish, and there are more rooms than I can possible use, so you can have a whole floor to yourself if you like. In fact, I’ll fix up the master suite for you! Clean out the last of Buckbeak’s feathers, put new linens on the bed, make it all snooty and grand so you feel right at home! Just like you were back at Malfoy Manor!”
He’d known it. When the letters stopped coming and the silence grew, he’d known it. Something soul-killing had happened to his dragon in that place—that chamber of horrors he called home—and Harry had failed to protect him from it. He should never have listened to Ron and Hermione when they told him he was overreacting, never hesitated, but jumped on a broom and flown to Draco’s rescue. Because
The old wizard smiled at that, his eyes crinkling at the corners with real amusement and, possibly, just a hint of affection. “There is always the chance that Voldemort will die and free you from this bond.”
“Spoilsports,” Ron muttered, but his lopsided grin took the sting out of it. Pocketing his wand, he stood looking about the wreckage of Harry’s lovely room with marked satisfaction. “Kreacher!”
The Death Eaters climbed to their feet again and retrieved their balls of wandfire. There was a new tension inside the ring of stones, an anticipation that hung visibly in the air and curled like vapor about the gathered wizards. Even the Dementors fell still, turned toward their master with something like eagerness. Draco remained kneeling with Lucius' hand on his shoulder, and Harry noticed that everything – the Death Eaters, Lucius, the stones – seemed taller than before. The light from the wandfire began to pulse faintly, as if in rhythm with Draco's heartbeat.
“Only after you succeed with the one you’ve got. Confidence, Miss Granger! Don’t let Mr. Potter intimidate you!”
"What are you doing here? And remember that I know very well you did not have permission to visit my son."
He edged even closer and bent to murmur directly into Draco’s ear, “You’re safe with me. You know you are. Just climb in the tub. Lie back in the hot water. Relax and trust me.”
“He believes that you bought him for your own pleasure,” she went on relentlessly, ignoring his protest. “He believes he has no right to deny you and no say in what happens to him. If you want him to trust you again, to
Harry worked a finger between his cheeks, fumbling for his hole, and he gasped, “No! No prep! Just do it!”
"I told you so." Draco sounded annoyed, but he was no longer squirming. He sat very still, while Harry stroked the teeth of the comb through his hair, pausing to pick at the snarls and knots.
He could only guess what had put Draco in this rare mood and, frankly, didn’t want to examine the reasons too closely. Draco was always eager to give himself. Always ready to surrender completely to Harry’s passion. But he was almost never truly submissive, preferring to grant Harry the privilege of claiming him, rather than acknowledge his right.
There it was, folded neatly under Harry's pillow. Of course, Ron realized as he lifted the soft pad of silvery fabric, he should have looked here first. Harry always kept it under his pillow, ready to hand, so he could slip out to meet Malfoy any time the urge took him. Except today, when he had so much work to do and Malfoy was feeling so grumpy.
“No, his name was Forbush. He sent Draco a letter, but Draco threw it in the fire without reading it, so I never found out what he wanted.
Lissy turned her enormous eyes on Harry, and he saw a distinct reproach in them. “Is Harry Potter bringing Master Draco home, as he promised? Or is he lying to Lissy again?”
“Yeah. Harry, mate, calm down and listen to me!” Ron used his sleeve to smother the biggest flames, then flung a smoldering scrap of paper on the floor and stomped on it. “
Six o'clock. Harry groaned softly and closed his eyes, willing himself back to unconsciousness. What insanity had possessed him to wake up at this ungodly hour, when he had only fallen asleep a few hours ago? How could he possibly deal with the veritable mountains of homework he had to do, if his mind was clogged with exhaustion and his body too tired to move? He had to draw up a massive Astronomy chart, research his History of Magic thesis, dice nightshade roots to and set them to soak in armadillo bile for his revealing potion...
Bellatrix’s hand fastened in his collar once more and dragged him into out of his hiding place. “Get to the tower!” she shrieked. “We’ll hold them off!”
“They’d tied him to the bars with his own hair. He was naked, so I could see the wounds all over him. Bruises, welts—like the kind you get when you fire a hex at close range—cuts and bite marks. His nose was broken, and his jaw. His ankles and wrists had bloody marks on them where he’d fought against his bonds. His ribs were black—I mean, really
"I'm still your best friend, aren't I? And that means I watch your back, like I did today with the Slytherins. So what are
“I’ll tell you when we’re done.” Turning his eyes back to Draco, Warwick said, “Do you know who I am, Malfoy?”
Draco spat blood onto the bar, shooting his tormentor a scornful look from beneath his lashes. He reached for his glass of Firewhiskey, only to have his wrist clamped down by a meaty hand.
This was an intriguing idea, considering that the healers had immediately pegged the spell as deliberate and tightly focused. Either they had a master practitioner of wandless magic on their hands, or someone who knew tricks the Aurors didn’t. He’d have to check with the Unspeakables. See if they had any ideas.
Harry decided to take a detour through the village on his way home, transfiguring himself and strolling through the square to see just how badly his cover was blown. He counted no less than six strangers lurking about—in the Post Office, the tea shop, the public house, anywhere they could shelter from the cold—and staring avidly at every passerby.
“The Ministry can trace wands. Isn’t that how they know when a Hogwarts student uses magic outside of school?”
Snape pounced on his words, grabbing him by an arm and almost shouting, “You know where Malfoy is? Show me!”
"Mr. Potter is right on several counts. He came here as a witness for Malfoy's defense, which gives him the right to speak out on the boy's behalf. He has been accused of several crimes, all of them relating to Malfoy and to the charges at hand, which puts him in the dock as well. He and Dumbledore have offered evidence to this court that we have yet to see. Why are we even discussing such a drastic and violent step as forcing Veritaserum on a mentally incapacitated boy, when we have evidence in front of us that could condemn or clear him without it?"
As Madam Pomfrey lifted her wand, Harry edged closer to the head of the bed, still clutching Draco's hand in both of his own. She murmured the spell, tapped the sleeping boy once with her wand, between the eyebrows, then bent over him, watching intently. Malfoy did not move.
His eyes fluttered open, then screwed shut against the light. A diffuse pain filled him, pooling in his half-healed wounds and lapping softly around his limbs, trying to draw him back down into that dark lake of unconsciousness. He had floated in it for an uncounted time, and part of him longed for it still, but he refused to succumb. He was done with hiding in the dark. He wanted to be here in the light and the air. He wanted to exist again.
He was answered by a piercing wail, and Harry jerked around to see Pansy Parkinson being dragged into the circle. She struggled futilely against the grip of her captors, feet skidding on the wet grass, and called to the silent watchers, "Let go of me! I didn't do anything! I didn't…
He bottomed out in a single, effortless stroke, fetching up bent over Draco’s back and clasping him with his body. They fell still, letting heat course through them. And in that blissful moment, when they felt more like one body than two, Harry finally understood: this wasn’t about how hard he
“Yeah, that’s me.” He almost scuffed his foot against the carpet but stopped himself in time. Better not to lay it on too thick.
The guard at the gates checked in their wands, favoring Harry with something as close to a simper as a grown man could manage, and told them that the Minister was waiting for them in his office. This seemed like a good sign to Harry, who had only ever attended hearings in the dungeon Courtroom. How intimidating could one office be? And how many hostile witches and wizards could it hold at one time?
“I’m sure.” Draco kissed him, mouth open and hungry, breath hot and quick on his face. “Absolutely sure.”
"But Draco needs me," he mumbled, his face heating with embarrassment as he said it. He felt surprise and an odd trickle of warmth come through the link, and his heart contracted in agony at the thought that he might never feel such a thing again.
They had brought the lovely upright piano from Narcissa’s private parlor at the Manor, one small piece of Draco’s childhood that they’d managed to salvage from the wreckage. In the months since, Draco had taken to playing it nearly every day. Harry, though an ignorant boor when it came to Classical music—as Draco never failed to point out—loved to watch him. He didn’t care that he could barely tell Chopin from Tchaikovsky or a Nocturne from a Concerto. What fascinated him was the look on Draco’s face when he played, the way his head bowed thoughtfully over the keyboard, the tilt of his shoulders, the grace and speed of his fingers, the droop of his lashes over his inward gaze, the smile that tilted his lips so very slightly when the last note echoed into silence.
Draco took a deep breath. Until now, Draco didn't know why Cedric hated his brother's mistress so much. In fact, Arabelle never disturbed Cedric's composure. "She has a name. You shouldn't just call her that," Draco chided and shook his head in a very slow motion.
"Okay. I'll see you this weekend. Thank you again," said the red-haired girl, and finally, she got up from her chair. The other girls followed and walked away from Draco.
Harry smiled faintly at Alden's answer. "Yeah, the look in his eyes was burning, full of hatred." Harry took another sip of the wine, closing his eyes. "But, you know how much I wanted to have him tonight."
"General Hector has a point. In legend, a god like Zeus simply chooses and goes to the human he likes. They are gods! They can do anything!"
Draco was utterly under the influence of the drug. After stripping off all the pretty boy's clothes, Harry took out a bottle filled with lubricant and hurried to prepare the blonde. After the preparation, Harry pushed himself into Draco's body.
One of Harry's coldest-looking bodyguards walked in half an hour ago, carrying a tray of food, setting it on the table. Then without saying anything, go and lock the door back from the outside. During that long half an hour, Draco tried desperately not to glance at the alluring tray.
Harry quickly laid Draco on the bed, stepped out of the white room, slammed the door, and shouted, "Alden!"
"I would like to meet Mr. Harry Potter," Draco muttered nervously to the receptionist in the luxurious office lobby.
"I care for him more than anything else, my King! But remember, we have millions of people. Your concubines and I also have dozens of children who must continue to live. Don't you remember the story of Tantalus? Do you want to see the kingdom of Sparta destroyed by God Ares?"
A sudden heat engulfed Draco's cheeks and neck. The queen’s silver eyes stared at Harry in surprise. What do his husband's words mean?
The man kissed the corner of Draco's lips softly, then his tongue stuck in, opened Draco's soft lips, smacked them, and felt the entire texture of Draco's warm, hot lips. His tongue hooked Draco's and played with it with great intensity.
If Aphrodite had lived in London, where Draco's true origin was, the Goddess would have received massive blasphemy. She's a public figure with millions of followers, but she had an affair with a man until she had children, even though her husband was alive and healthy. Women like Aphrodite would be labeled 'shameless'. Draco felt sorry for Hephaestus, her husband.
"Look! There's a cobweb," Draco immediately felt an idiot. Ares chuckled and got up from his seat. He casually sat down next to his new wife and put his arm around him. Draco felt like jumping, but he didn't want to run either.
Draco was stunned. Miscarriage. So, their baby was never born? Draco suddenly felt sad remembering Seraphina's smile in the painting, the smile of a very happy mother, with her arms wrapped around her stomach as if protecting her baby who was sleeping there.
"Your Majesty, what business do you have with me?" Draco asked as he tried to keep his gaze on Harry's piercing stare. Even with just a glance, Draco felt like his skin was being ripped apart. He could feel an incredible chill seep through his bones.
To be honest, Draco didn't understand the meaning of the sarcasm. He mentioned the word 'hell', really religious even though he had a point. "Then why am I here?" Draco frowned.
The bull fell to the ground. Ares used his sturdy arms to hold and squeeze its neck. Ares forced the bleeding to speed up. The bull finally succumbed to death without any significant resistance.
"I understand your feelings, but there were some things that I didn't have time to explain to you at that time when master Harry interrupted our conversation," Alden said again, "Indeed, you will surely see that master Harry only sees you as a substitute for Mrs. Seraphina. No. As time goes by, what master sees is you, yourself."
"God, what happened to you?" Draco was surprised when he saw that Arabelle's usually smooth and flawless legs were now covered in red blotches.
Greyson shrugged his shoulders. "Well, the project run by my company in Greece has ended successfully."
Harry closed his eyes in annoyance as the dirty thoughts began to take over him. Not wanting to be tempted any longer, Harry immediately hooked a hook in the form of a satin string to the hook hole in the back of the tunic.
Foreplay, he thinks. All right. Foreplay. Mentally, he reaches for every soft, romantic gesture he can find, and then remembers how this used to go; Ginny used to love when Harry would cast wandlessly and wordlessly. When he could just make things happen.
“Come on, you wanker.” Harry laughs; it feels odd to joke casually with Malfoy the way he would with most anyone else. “As though you wouldn’t just use Lumos. You’ve known that spell for twenty years.”
Draco's found his wand and is holding it in his lap, still staring at Harry, as Ginny brings a sleepy hand out from under the covers and pats whatever part of him she finds — his knee, his thigh, the side of his stomach.
Draco's mind is racing, but he manages to follow Potter's deliberate gaze across the room, and it lands on Ginny like a searchlight. She's already looking back toward them while Charlie and some other bloke talk at her as she completely ignores them. She's not trying to hide it.
Draco’s neutral expression matches the decor. He snaps his fingers — the first magic Harry's seen here — and a small, flat-bottomed jar flies from the doorway into Malfoy's outstretched palm. He places it on the bare desk and slides it toward Harry. Inside the jar, the potion is a thick dark purple, almost black, and it churns and roils of its own accord. It looks menacing, or else Harry’s just projecting.
to hex more than one of their classmates. But James and Ember both, even though she’s still a tiny thing, have a certain toughness to them. A thicker skin.
“You arsehole,” she mutters. She smiles just a bit bigger, but it's all he needs. Her skin is glowing in the candlelight.
"So, what's a dragon's favorite food?" he asks, and she's caught so off-guard that she looks at him properly for the first time. Fuck. She should know better. Why does Harry still, always, have to be so bloody hot? The thick, ink-black, shaggy hair. The dishevelled slouch that can't disguise the strong broad shoulders, jammed into an ill-fitting, all-wrong suit he can't be bothered to charm the wrinkles from. The sweet, earnest, tired eyes that beg for someone to take care of him, god
“I can take it. I agree, in fact,” he says tightly, and then, as though summoned by magic — and perhaps he was, somehow, some sort of family charm that registers when the others get riled up — Charlie Weasley appears next to Ginny. He’s bloody hot now too, dressed in skintight dragonhide trousers that presumably he couldn’t be bothered to change, and a self-assured unstudied masculinity. He’s short, even shorter than Potter and a full head beneath his sister in those towering heels, but he radiates power and muscle.
She tastes like nothing he can describe with words, unless she’s been drinking. Then, she tastes like firewhiskey and fresh air and sweat and spring, like the first buds of the leaves on the trees.
, for fuck’s sake, the Dursleys and that cupboard long hidden behind more pressing and recent evils — but buried there down deep, nonetheless. Harry is numb all the time. He feels nothing, and sex with Ginny is about proving himself, in the beginning. Proving he could feel something. Proving they were normal and healthy, that they were okay. That they had survived. That they
“There was some wanker with a camera prowling around the building earlier, and I figured it was because of you. Doesn’t the media follow you everywhere?” Malfoy sticks his head back out the door and looks back and forth warily before he shuts it.
do, then?” she asks, angry, and he has no answer. She props herself up on her elbows, her hair falling like curtains around her face. Her shape is indistinct in the dim light but her eyes, like always, are on fire. They gleam in accusation.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Why are you always making me repeat myself? Every conversation with you happens twice. I would like. An exception. To the Legilimency statute. For
“Er, thanks, Malfoy,” he says, suddenly desperate not to leave. He lingers, too close, for just a moment, and Malfoy puts an oddly gentle hand on his back, ushering him out.
He rubs at his neck. "Er, sorry. I wasn't sure if you wanted me there," he says, suddenly conscious of the dirty room around him. He sits up straighter on the sofa and wonders if he could get away with a quick straightening charm, but she's already glancing around, taking in the whole sloppy scene.
Ginny Floos to the Gala alone, early, having ignored the owls and texts from her brothers about Apparating over to the Muggle hotel together. She's grouchy and starving, so she stumbles out of the Floo unprepared for the extravagance of the room. It’s really quite grand, a soaring high ceiling, glowing midnight blue and shot through with moonlight and stars, and a central waterfall charmed to splash just so. Lush plants grow in every direction, with walkways winding through them like open forest paths and tables set into their own clearings. Flowers are everywhere. Dragonflies flit around, lighting occasionally on the greenery.
“What did you say, Malfoy?” she repeats. Ginny's voice is tight; she looks rattled, and so is he. Draco defaults to the only defence he’s ever had against Potter: pettiness.
it that way?” Harry’s back is against the wall; his magic thrums inside him the way it does when he’s facing danger. “Why are you still punishing yourself, after all this time? Haven’t the stupid restrictions from the Ministry punished you enough?”
The tables are spread with a feast of tiny food: miniature pastries and finger sandwiches, bite-sized canapes, tartlets with bacon and onion jam, tiers of candied kumquats charmed to hover like Snitches around a dark chocolate fountain. She sets down her tiny clutch — with several extension charms; nothing can fit in those tiny bags — and takes a delicate china plate from a tall stack.
“Er, flying, dear. Quidditch. Not forever!” she hastens to add. “Just for the duration of the pregnancy, that’s all. You don’t want baby to be jostled if you fall. Not to mention the bludgers—“
Ginny had wanted it too, surprise and pleasure in her voice when Harry had initiated things. He’d deliberately come to bed when he knew she was still awake — something he rarely did — and had stripped off his jeans and sidled next to her under the quilts. He’d been playing with her hair, rubbing his thumb along the shaved part, and she’d looked him dead in the eye with one eyebrow cocked. He smiled, embarrassed — he was already hard, she could see his pants — and then she sat straight up and threw her leg over him, calmly took off his glasses and set them on the nightstand, and leaned down for a proper kiss. Eventually, they’d fucked just like that: him on his back and her on top with her back arched and her head thrown back, almost like there was wind in her hair, almost like she was flying.
Now, instead of Fiendfyre and curselight, his nightmares are mostly about his children. They peaked when James went off to Hogwarts last autumn — Harry can’t believe how young he is, how small — but most of his worries, day and night, are about Al.
Harry didn’t feel better, exactly, but at least the tears stopped choking him. He sobbed, down on all fours, grounded and safe from Ginny’s fire, and that was when he knew he had to leave.
Harry wades through them. He almost wants to laugh; they're Draco's own furious, horny reactions to Harry, with material for miles. There are simply so many. Draco looking at that same Quidditch Weekly spread, his cock in his hand, angry and afraid. This very room, but freezing cold, tunnelled under the blankets. What must be his room at the Manor, spread-eagled on a lush-looking ivory coverlet. There are more recent images, too: one is from just a few weeks ago, the last time Harry had been to the office. Draco had braced himself against the door desperately. He's frantic, breathing through his mouth, looking down at himself, stripping his cock brutally, his other hand reaching around back to—
Instead, he decides to call it a night, cleans his teeth, comes back to bed and pulls up the comforter over himself. He won’t allow himself to cast a Tempus charm; he knows it’s ridiculously early.
"Once again," Harry says, clearing his throat. "I'm right here." He's lying down with his back to them again, but his body is rigid and too still, a sure tell he's still on edge.
He looks Harry up and down coolly and continues. “You’re a wreck, Potter. As per usual. Come back and I’ll get you a coffee too. But if you betray me to these godforsaken Muggles, so help me Merlin, I will hex you halfway to Cornwall.”
"What? Oh. Hilarious." She rolls her eyes and drags them away from his face; it's easier to be mean to him if she's not looking.
Harry stays silent — the oldest interrogation trick in the book — and it keeps Malfoy talking, although he gives nothing away. “It suits me, frankly. I’d much rather trade in favours anyway, most of the time.”
She laughs softly again and pushes him back, closing her eyes and leaning against him. "Don't be ridiculous, it's just a stupid hobby. I like the way clothes keep me covered up. Safe. Separate."
it, and although Ginny had sworn long ago it wouldn't be her, she hates herself for how much she wants to trace the circles beneath them with her thumb. His easy strength, his effortless insouciance, the shadow of stubble along the jawline—
And then they both reach for Draco's cock at once, stroking it hard together. Draco's head tips back onto Harry's shoulder — he's shaking, he's falling apart, and this is what Harry has wanted, has
The first few weeks are difficult. Immediately after they bring James home, that old burden of proof — the feeling of being constantly scrutinised (by the Weasleys? Hermione? himself?) to make sure he’s okay — roars back and grows heavier. It settles on him like a physical weight.
for, and they're both wanking him together. Inside Draco’s mind, Harry feels Draco's pleasure and his own, at the same time. His own touch on Draco's cock and under his hand, both at once. He sees a riot of images, swirling liquid chaos that reminds him again of the sea, of being pulled out in a tide of pleasure and sensation.
Instead, he fetches new sheets from the linen cupboard and puts them on the Muggle way, as a kind of punishment. His lower back twinges unpleasantly, achy and sore, when he stretches. He’s still on edge, maybe worse than before, and he barely even knows why. He falls asleep face-down on the bed, on top of the covers, slipping into a dreamless exhaustion until he hears Ginny come in. The room’s grown dark and his mouth tastes bad; he hasn’t cleaned his teeth yet.
They get married at Bill and Fleur’s cottage, the salty air whipping at Ginny’s dress. Harry says “I do” and means it. When he pulls her close to kiss her, he tastes the sea on her lips, and then he feels a little kick right at his abdomen, even through all those layers of clothes. Someone tips off the press, but when they refuse to bugger off, George launches vicious sulfur-sticking charms at them until they flee, which is highly satisfying.
Well, if she was honest with herself, it had been coming for a while before that; nineteen was just when she started practicing on purpose. There was a learning curve, it turned out. Now she'd been at it for five years, and she was getting rather good.
Ginny always floats away from herself during sex, somehow, whether she's with a man or a woman, magical or not, kind or not. One or two or even three at a time. Even now, she likes to be in charge, and to not be so nice about it. It turns her on to feel as though she's watching the whole scene from a distance. It probably isn’t… healthy, or whatever. But it’s okay.
"I know what you mean." Malfoy hands him six vials, enough for a long time, particularly since he and Ginny have stopped having sex again anyway. Harry’s got a stockpile now, and he doesn’t need it, but he gathers them and practically runs out of the office, down Seaside Lane, back to the Apparition point. That night, alone in a too-quiet house, he downs one of the vials and wanks himself raw, thinking of Malfoy the whole time. He comes three times in an hour, but he’s still wanting and empty.
, after all, a completely helpless one who needs him blindly and constantly. And Harry has absolutely no idea what to do — how to hold a new baby, or feed it, or change a nappy, or make it stop crying. While Ginny was still in hospital, people had told him that everyone feels that panicky new-parent feeling, but Harry can't help but believe it's worse because he's never seen someone be a parent to an infant.
Malfoy snorts. “‘Some kind of way.’ It’s funny how none of my customers are particularly eager to be known as such. This line of work isn’t exactly noble.”
He clears his throat awkwardly. “I was just wondering where you’d found the lovely corset you’re wearing tonight. Was it Lesbians R Us?”
“Fuck,” he whispers. And then he hears himself say “fuck” a second time, louder, after he realises he’s just said it out loud.
His chest can’t possibly be comfortable, but Draco can feel Harry get heavier as sleep overtakes him. He lets himself for a few long moments. Harry is unguarded in sleep, his face more relaxed than Draco's ever seen it. He risks waking him to brush his knuckles against Harry's cheek and smooth the thick black hair away from his forehead. It’s dark enough in the room that he can barely make out the scar.
Harry tries to make himself wait until the end of the day but only makes it to half-three before he gathers his things, walks to the communal Apparition point, and selects a spot closest to Malfoy's lab. As he hurries up the nondescript grey street, lined with office buildings that all somehow seem empty, he feels his face growing hot despite the spring wind and the warm drizzle. Which is ridiculous. He’s nothing to be embarrassed about, nothing at all. He hasn’t seen Draco Malfoy in years — not since they’d run into each other once, around Christmastime, shopping on Diagon. They'd been perfectly civil. And after the Fiendfyre, Draco owes him a life-debt after all, doesn’t he?
, even in a completely inappropriate suit, with that perfect arse just staring at you.” Ginny begins to laugh and oh Draco likes it, the pit of warmth deep within her that it seems to draw from.
Meanwhile, Malfoy is still talking. “—another reason you ought to come out with me tonight. There’s a whole world out there, Potter. There are better ways of forgetting than pulling a blanket over your head.”
“Take it or leave it, Potter. The first one's on me.” Malfoy turns away, as though he already knows what Harry will do.
“How’s that good luck worked out for you so far?” Harry asks, rubbing his hand over the nape of Draco’s neck.
Acquiring the waiver to the Legilimency restriction was dead easy — Harry had simply requested it at the Magical Enforcement Unit and some clerk had given it to him without asking why, or even really looking him in the eye. Harry signed it himself and registered a copy with the Ministry. That was it.
Harry’s breathlessly happy that day. Getting married is brilliant; Ginny is brilliant. He can’t tell if he’s thrilled or terrified or both, but it feels normal, somehow. Arthur assures him that a young father is supposed to be terrified, and Harry clings to those words.
in our sex life, because of—“ she strides back to the table, back to the bottles — “because of a sex potion that
Harry is overjoyed, this time. The pregnancy goes smoothly. They both look forward to the next birth, and it's like a miracle all over again. Later, when things got bad between them, Ginny would joke about how things would be grand if only she could give birth every day. They were best together when they had a project.
like that,” she says, her voice too quiet. “While we're on the subject of sex, did you tell Al you’re bi?”
, you twit,” he responds automatically, the first words he’s said since he opened the door. Malfoy smiles as though getting Harry to speak means he’s won some sort of contest, and truly he’s got some nerve to have that kind of smile on him when Harry’s still just trying to adjust to the fact of his presence in his flat.
They do this for years, all through Ginny’s time at uni and Harry’s time doing… whatever it is he's doing. They use sex to push down every emotion, to rechannel everything into each other. Harry would fuck her anywhere, just to forget.
Draco can’t help himself, can’t hold back one minute longer, and he lets his eyes devour Potter's almost-naked body, and then he's crossing the room and kissing him, in a single smooth, fast motion. He’s startled to find Ginny’s hand on his back, reaching up to remove his jacket.
“What an ugly word,” Malfoy says. “It’s not blackmail. I just save my ask for when the time is right.”
Harry plays a lot of video games during this strange period of isolation, and he wanks. He makes up for lost time, years of being too consumed by uncertainty and fear to ever learn his own body. He begins to figure out what he likes, where it feels good to touch himself, exactly how and what and why. Wizarding pornography is very, very good; moving images have many uses. It is an excellent way to make time go by faster, Harry finds. He wanks a lot.
“But that’s out,” he continues, as though Harry hadn’t said anything. “I’m only interested if it’s mutually desirable. And I won't have it off with married customers. Or straight men.”
“Nothing I do is illicit,” Malfoy snaps back. “I have licenses for every potion I trade in. Would you like to inspect them, Auror Potter? Are you here on Ministry business after all?”
She wouldn’t, or didn’t, cry at the funeral, and afterward he’d thought that maybe they could let themselves be softer with each other. Harry had sat between Ginny and Ron, and Ron had sobbed, so hard and so silently that Harry didn’t know at first what was shaking the bench. Harry had no idea what to do, although Hermione had put her arms around Ron so tenderly, had seemed to wrap up his gangly arms and pull in his sadness so effortlessly, that Harry’s heart still hurt from it.
“I try,” she says calmly, adjusting a buckle on her leg somewhere. Draco’s not sure; once again, he can’t manage to tear his eyes from Harry.
He can almost hear the affectless voice of Arvin Mukherjee, the assistant potions analyst who submitted this report, reading it aloud. Arvin sounds judgmental, in his head. Harry scans the rest of the document.
She broke it off with Harry around then, too. He couldn't bring himself to tell her he was bi, even though she'd already told him the same about herself, and even though it was blindingly apparent to both of them. Merlin, he couldn't even bring himself to meet her eyes, back then. And he’d been too much of a coward — yes, Harry Potter, the bravest of them all, an utter coward — to admit he'd always wanted the idea of her more than the reality.
She huffs out a little laugh and relaxes back into him. "I just Transfigured some stuff, and charmed it all. No big deal," she says.
Draco makes one perfect sound, a note of surprise he can't seem to suppress, and suddenly Harry's dying to hear him make more. Already he can’t think straight, already can’t resist pressing himself down on Malfoy’s leg and grinding against him, just for a moment. Malfoy tightens his arms and jolts like he’s been shocked. His tongue is in Harry’s mouth, lightning fast like he thinks he’s sneaking something, and Harry moans himself, then— and he suddenly remembers Ginny.
Yes, the voice in his head hisses, yesssss, far too snake-like for comfort, and Harry squirms, fuck,
"I know, I know, I'm sorry," Malfoy says, and he almost sounds like he means it. "That was wrong of me. I just missed Legilimency so much. I adore it, and it's been so long, and I really wanted to know if you really... and that was— it felt like flying again. But you're right. Truly. I shouldn't have; I should have more self-control. I'm sorry."
, that’s the last thing he wants — and Harry’s whole world tilts. He feels unmoored, like he might drift off the bed without Draco’s weight anchoring him there.
to be talking or thinking about his family — ever, if he had his way — but he just doesn’t know how to interact with Potter. He never has.
Of course not, Harry realises. Former Death Eaters are still under severe restrictions. Tracers on their magic alert the authorities whenever they step an inch out of line. The restrictions are quite harsh — too harsh, some say, although Harry had always supported them. Malfoy would have to submit to the restrictions as well; there had been no exemptions for underage wizards, and no relaxing of the rules even though the war had been over for twenty years.
“First he has to save the whole bloody world or whatnot” — Draco waves a hand in the air dismissively — “and then he has the nerve to look like
"Do I have to guess which one? What a delightful game. Hm." Malfoy leans back and considers him, and Harry feels a prickle at the back of his neck. A warning, an uneasiness.
“Aren’t we enough to satisfy your saviour complex?” she asks, motioning to herself and James, who’s now trying to pull himself up onto a coffee table.
“Love is love, Potter. Or hadn’t you heard,” Malfoy says, and Ginny laughs like she can’t help herself, and finally, finally, the elevator reaches their floor and the doors slide open and they’ve arrived.
Everything else looks mostly the same as he climbs the stairs. When he gets to suite 37, there’s a new sign for Premier Pharmaceuticals, with small business cards in a fancy holder attached. There’s also a new doormat, and the door itself looks more substantial, somehow. More prosperous.
“No,” Draco blurts, and Draco never blurts. But his words are a runaway train, now. “I mean, no don’t forget it, and yes I want to get out of here. With you. Yes.”
Harry looks at them, piled together in the giant white duvet of an unfamiliar bed, in unfamiliar morning light, in the air-conditioned sterility of the hotel room. Ginny reaches up to try to pull Malfoy back under the covers and he's fussing at her, playful but tentative, as though he's not sure he's allowed. Harry sees them clearly, in that moment, all three of them people who survived more as children than anyone ought to have survived in a lifetime. They’d all been adrift afterward; they are still drifting.
Harry, unthinking, throws his head back and it hits the wall, and the jolt of pain somehow goes straight to his cock, and fuck, this was about to be over far too soon.
He's been doing so well, doing such a good job at never, ever, ever allowing Voldemort into his mind. He will not, he will
After taking a Muggle test — she and Harry don’t know the diagnostic spells for pregnancy, and they certainly can't ask anyone — she comes out of the bathroom, eyes wide, and Harry knows without her saying a word. He gets up and reaches for her hands, but she won’t come close enough to touch him. So he just stands there. They’re just the same height, Harry thinks, inanely.
When Harry doesn't respond right away — silence is one of his favorite interrogation techniques, and he often defaults to it when confronted — Malfoy continues. "What brings you here, Potter? Official Ministry business?"
Tonight, Draco's not eager to call attention to himself — he never is, with anything related to the war. But he's allowed just a bit of personality to slip through: a single earring, his favorite, a dangly silver one in the shape of a feather. It brushes his collar. His little rebellion, private but public.
On his twenty-fourth birthday, Harry is awake as the clock flips over to midnight, changing James' nappy. He hums ‘Happy Birthday’ to himself so the baby can hear it for the first time, but keeps his voice soft and uses the dimmest possible Lumos so the baby doesn’t fully wake up. James is still heavy with sleep, and he burrows under Harry’s chin when he picks him back up. Harry's still humming softly.
Draco makes sure his face is impassive as he absorbs the sting of her words. He’s heard far worse than this. He’s been shoved in the street, kicked, elbowed, screamed at, had his broom hexed while he’s flying it. He knows the sensation of someone else’s cold spit sliding down into his collar as they scream obscenities into his face. He takes it all because he deserves it, and more. He wants it to hurt.
A mediwitch (thank Merlin, not the one from that first appointment) casts half a dozen charms at Ginny as well, for pain relief and stamina and who knows what else. Their hospital room is locked down as tight as a Gringotts vault, so there's no press anywhere. No friends, even, just him alone with Ginny and the Healers. There is quite a lot of fluid and blood,
He’s so responsive, it's a dream, pale thighs for miles, the most lovely arse she's ever seen. And her special charm — carefully honed with years of practice — means she can feel every inch of him surrounding the dildo. Its base grinds into her clit with perfect pressure and she can control it exquisitely, every inch of it, and it’s delicious.
. He doesn’t know when he’d finally admitted it to himself, doesn’t know when he’d allowed the thought to take hold, but there it was, and the voice in his head is positively shouting now. He's already harder than the Lover’s Voice had ever made him, his cock aching, his
. I don’t have a bloody storyline. I’m a person, in case you haven’t noticed, a person whose life seems to have fallen apart in the last six months, and—”
And then there’s a sparkle of possibility, a glimmer on the words even though they’re not magic. Or maybe they are, Harry can’t be sure.
“It’s chucking it down out there,” Harry says, trying to keep himself from visibly shivering. He casts another drying spell on himself, plus a double warming charm, and he sees that odd look on Malfoy’s face again. It occurs to him that he’s watching, closely.
"What do you call a dragon who's good at juggling?" He persists, always. Harry is nothing if not persistent.
“Potter,” Malfoy says, from what feels like a thousand yards away. “I don’t know where you’ve gone just now, and I know you’re an exceptionally busy and important person, but if you manage to find a free moment, I believe we have some matters to attend to.”
He makes himself a cup of tea and carries it into his bedroom, padding along in bare feet. He sits on the edge of his bed and scrolls aimlessly on his phone while he drinks it, wanders around on YouTube, debates some Muggle porn but doesn’t have the energy.
“Auld Lang Syne. The new year’s song. I make sure to sing the whole thing through every year, for good luck.” His voice is gentle, impossibly so — an entirely new way for Draco Malfoy to speak, in Harry’s experience.
On his stomach again, he palms his cock more roughly and begins to work himself harder. Trapping his fist beneath him, he stills his hand and pushes into it, everything tight and awkward. He used to always wank this way and it reminds him of his early jerking-off experiences, alone at Grimmauld Place, flipped over on the couch, lonely and anxious. His hips moving faster, Harry thinks of Malfoy again, of what it must have been like for him after the war, whether he started finally touching himself then too. Would he have been learning to get himself off just like Harry did?
“Likewise,” Harry says, and he does feel a fool now. What is he even doing here? He stands up abruptly, his knees cracking loudly in the silent room.
“Merlin, Potter, aren’t you and your sodding Aurors off playing detective every day? How on earth can you ever 'fight crime' and keep the world safe from the likes of me, when you’re this sodding clueless?”
Hearing Malfoy apologise puts Harry on his back foot. "But your Occlumency skills are shite, Potter." Malfoy is joking now, tentatively, as though he’s testing Harry’s reaction. "No wonder the Aurors are a bloody disaster."
Harry goes home that night to find Molly in his sitting room, knitting and listening to the Wireless. Ginny’s gone to the pub with friends, Molly tells him, accepted a last-minute invitation, and he ignores her frown of disapproval when he declines her suggestion to meet Ginny and skives off to the bedroom instead. Molly’s always worn her feelings on her sleeve, and Harry can’t help but see that she disapproves of the distance she knows is growing between them.
They talk to three other Healers, including a sports medicine expert, and they all say the same things: cushioning charms aren’t 100 percent effective, there are other dangers too, sudden altitude changes cause undue pressure, on and on. No Quidditch; no flying.
“You think I know what I’m doing just because I’ve fucked men before?” Malfoy is up in Harry’s space — close, too close — but also not close enough. “I’ve never fucked
When the spotty, Hogwarts-aged kid working the front desk tells them that hotel rooms will be complementary for "the great Harry Potter" — and when the poor git actually bows, so low he practically scrapes the ground — Harry dearly wishes for death. Ginny and Draco roll their eyes at the exact same moment. They catch each other's glances and cackle, identically, and suddenly Harry wonders what on earth he's just arranged.
But Harry is good in a crisis. He’s good when it counts. His instincts kick in, and he remembers the rhythm of this now — of presenting bravery in the face of fear — and he tries all the techniques they’d learned beforehand. His hands on her back, her hips. Cooling spells for her forehead. A spell to make the bed firmer, another to transfigure a cup into a yoga ball. She’s resolute and focused. Towards the very end, there’s a special opening charm, one he’s never heard before, that the Healers can’t use until the woman is ready.
James is born a few months later. Ginny’s contractions start hard and fast, too early, in the middle of the night. Harry never sleeps much or deeply, and he’d awoken with a start when he felt her shift in the bed in an unfamiliar way. Ginny looks at him with panicked eyes.
“Sit on the bed,” she orders, taken aback by the harshness of her own voice. He and Harry, both still hovering near the door, stare back at her. They're nervous. Good.
Harry knocks on the door, but there's no answer. He rings the small bell beside it and can't tell if it even works; he doesn't hear a thing. There's no sound from any of the surrounding offices, either, and Harry begins to turn away. He feels an odd sense of relief, which disappears when the door swings open, and there's Draco Malfoy standing before him in a white coat. His face is gaunt and his features are as sharp as ever. His hair is long but tied back and a bit shaggy, not a shiny curtain like his father's had been. His expression betrays nothing, but Harry sees him swallow twice, the sharp Adam's apple of his throat bobbing up and down.
In that spirit, he unpacks the groceries and makes himself an omelet for dinner, cracking three eggs, scrambling them up, turning the liquid round and round in the pan. He adds cheese and salt and pepper, flips it onto a plate with a little flourish, and eats the whole thing standing over the sink.
"Being what? I’m not touch-starved." Harry wants to shake his head to try to clear out the confusion crowding his mind.
“Well, I never!” the mirror harrumphs at her, which is blatantly false, because they have this conversation at least twice a week. “Have a
Harry fists himself for a minute and then flips over, ruts against the mattress to get some more friction, unsatisfied with having nothing to shove into. He turns on his side and tries fucking into a pillow, but that’s worse, too soft, all wrong. He wishes he had some porn to get the images of Malfoy out of his head, but he doesn’t want to stop to find some; he’s frustrated and angry, he’s not sure at what.
"Oh," Draco says. A rogue firefly buzzes past his ear, and he flinches and bats it away. "Don't— don't feel bad. She’s fine. She was released from Azkaban last year and joined my father wherever he's hiding out. I've no clue where they are, because they know I'd turn him in if I did. We don't speak anymore."
He huffs out a laugh in disbelief. “I’m not going anywhere with you,“ he begins, but Malfoy rolls his eyes and cuts him off.
“Neither have yours, apparently.” Harry steps inside and closes the door, but doesn't sit down. He tries to find his footing in this conversation; he’d forgotten how odd and off-kilter Malfoy always made him, and suddenly he feels the old wish for Ron and Hermione to be by his side. They were still close, in a way, still got the kids together on birthdays and holidays, but nothing like they’d once been. It was inevitable, he supposed. Of course everyone was busy all the bloody time, but at times like now, he missed their presence in his daily life.
Harry thought he'd have to force himself to reach for the jar, but he realises he actually wants it quite a lot. When he picks it up, it's warm to the touch and heavier than it looks. He stands quickly and moves toward the door; suddenly, he very much wants to leave.
He glances over at the kitchen clock with one hand in London time and one on Sydney time. Hermione’d bought it for him before she and Ron left for Australia. They did Floo calls every week and they always sounded warm and happy, hopping about with dingoes, or whatever it was one did in Australia. Forgetting about the war, probably. Forgetting about him. Being happy, or happier, at least. He hopes they’re happier.
"Maybe, but that's not what I mean," he says, infuriatingly steady as usual, but with a smile teasing his mouth as well, those full lips, the crinkles around those jewel-green eyes awakening now, a mischievous smirk overtaking the weariness of his face. "I mean you, Gin" — his tone changes on her nickname, to an unmistakable one she can’t help but recognise from years ago — "do
Malfoy unrolls it and scans it, a slow smile spreading over his face. He goes quite still, and before Harry has a moment to stop it, Malfoy is immediately in his mind, rifling through his thoughts as though he's looking for something specific. Legilimency is disconcerting at best, even when you're prepared for it; it's downright sickening when it's sudden and unexpected, and Harry gets a savage jolt that reminds him of Voldemort entering his mind unbidden. That rampaging, uncontrollable violation.
"More than," Draco breathes, and he's barely gotten the words out when Potter's already headed straight towards Ginny, ignoring the waterfall and the half-dozen people who try to stop him to chat, barging into her conversation. Could this be some kind of cruel set-up? He wouldn’t put it past Potter and his friends, or at least he wouldn't have a few years ago. But no, Harry meets his eye from across the room and inclines his head, barely perceptible. He raises his eyebrows like he's asking permission, again.
“Well, you never fucking thought to ask about them before, did you?” she snaps. He had once, actually, in the very beginning, but he thinks it unwise to bring that up. Ginny’d said she was taking care of it, and once again, he’d been relieved not to shoulder that responsibility. But now she’s looking at him with a different kind of fire in her eyes.
Ginny makes her way down one of the forest paths, toward the buffet set out on long tables at the side of the room. She's so early that it's nearly empty. Although it's hot outside for May, the huge room is chilly. She swings her hips as she walks, feeling the silk of her trousers rub her thighs, the corset shift stiffly against her back. Feeling the few pairs of eyes in the room swivel toward her. Good. Let them look.
Kissing Ginny is one thing; Malfoy is a different matter entirely. He's still sitting primly on the edge of the bed, but there’s an uneven flush creeping up and out of his stiff white collar. Very carefully, he takes off that earring —
“And I’m sure you only do what you’re allowed, right? Such a law-abiding citizen, here in your illicit potions lab.”
Draco wants to turn and look at it, but he’s mesmerised by the feel of what must be a large dildo pressing into the small of his back — and by Harry, still lying so close to him that Draco can hear him breathe, green eyes hooded but searching his face. They’re not touching, but Harry’s so close that Draco can feel the heat of his body, can study his face and his eyes, strangely unguarded. He can look and look and look, just the way he’s always wanted to.
“I’m not fucking off anywhere,” he tries to tell her late at night, in another whispered fight in her tiny, stifling bedroom. He’s lying and they both know it; fucking off somewhere, anywhere, is exactly what he’s doing. Romania is just the only option that’s been presented to him. He can’t breathe during these fights, can’t think. The air gets murky and thick.
“You too,” she says to Harry abruptly, and he jumps as though he’s been shocked. He’d been standing there frozen, his eyebrows raised. But then he walks forward, slowly, and sits down next to Malfoy.
They go to Ginny’s dormitory, too, and have sex in her room while her roommate is on holiday. They visit the showers in her Quidditch locker room. They rewrite the history of her tiny room at the Burrow and fuck there under three different silencing charms. They are not exactly happy, Harry thinks. More like determined. But they’re single-minded, at least, and they’re in it together.
“No, I won’t be accepting money from you. I set my own payments, and your payment, Auror Potter, is one favour. From the
She'd always wanted to sleep with Harry again, now that she knows more — more about her own body, about what feels good and why. It’s a relief to sink back into it. To admit she still wants him. To do something about it.
, Harry thinks, as Draco makes short work of the buttons on his trousers, jerks open his zipper, and mouths him over the thin grey cotton of his pants. Harry arches up and has to steady himself against the bar. He can’t stifle a gasp, loud and dramatic in the tiny elevator, and that seems to prompt Draco to give some sort of involuntary low growl and finish the work of taking Harry’s cock out. In the lift, the same one where he helped Mrs Cartwright in 6B pick up all the shopping she’d dropped from a torn bag earlier that day. Draco’s knees — Draco,
Harry scowls at him. He doesn’t actually need more potion this time. In fact, he wasn’t even sure how he’d wound up here; at the end of the day, he’d just wanted to go back to Seaside Lane. But Malfoy doesn’t wait for him to justify himself.
Harry closes his eyes against this. He hadn’t anticipated that question, somehow, and Ginny is going to hate the answer. She has always loathed Malfoy, and used to accuse Harry of having an unhealthy obsession with him back in school.
Draco swallowed painfully, and for a brief moment, something other than resentment showed in his eyes. "Oh, I get it, all right. I feel like something is ripping my insides out and there isn't a bloody thing I can do about it. You and Dumbledore won't let me go. Cutting off my arm won't help, though believe me, I've thought about it. My next best bet is to bash my head against the wall until I can't hear the voices anymore. But if I move, I'll throw up again, and I
Harry had refused to come down for dinner tonight. It was not the first meal he'd skipped in the last week, but his tendency to retreat into his bedroom and avoid even his fellow Gryffindors was becoming more and more pronounced with every day that passed. And Hermione was growing more and more frightened for him.
Countless eyes swiveled to Draco once more, studying him for signs of bodily destruction. A faint ripple of laughter swept through the crowd and quickly faded. Draco smiled sweetly but said nothing.
“Imran is a colleague. He was more than happy to lend a hand,” Forbush glanced up from the scroll on which he was jotting his notes to quirk one of his habitual cold smiles at Draco, “in the interests of Magical research.”
“He may be in trouble—broke, alone, maybe hurt. I’d appreciate any help you can give him. And I’d repay you.”
Narcissa paused to collect herself, and Harry half expected Dumbledore to break in on the eager silence, to use his guileless manner and needle-sharp wit to destroy the mood she had conjured with her words. But Dumbledore sat as still as the rest of them – as still as Draco, lost and broken, huddled so far within himself that his mother's eloquent lies did not even touch him – waiting for her to continue.
“Good idea. Just be gentle with the spell. You don’t want them forgetting their real names or marrying the waiters or anything.”
Draco did not bother to respond to this flagrant bit of sentimental drivel. Instead, he concentrated on helping Harry with the various clasps and hooks on his clothing that all seemed to stick when he was in a hurry. Harry nibbled lightly along his jaw, making him squirm in an agonizing, enchanting way, then whispered, "Some day, I'll make you say it... that you love me..."
The one on the left smirked, identifying it as Dragon (the twins had, eerily, picked up certain mannerisms from their namesakes—a smirk and lifted brow for Dragon, the habit of rubbing the back of his neck when uncertain for Hal—which was the only way anyone, even their parents, could tell them apart) and said, “You stole that from Papa.”
The lead weight got even heavier. Draco looked away from his husband’s frowning face, stared emptily at the candlestick on the end table.
Draco did not thank Harry for the kitten. He did not say one kind word to the little creature. But he also did not let her out of his hands for the rest of the evening. Felix was granted permission to pet her and kiss her goodnight, then Draco settled onto the sofa for his evening tea-and-foot-rub with the kitten curled on his chest. When he and Harry climbed into bed that night, the kitten came with them. She found herself a place on Draco’s pillow but quickly slid down into the curve of his neck, and for all his disgust at having a mangy feline foisted on him, Draco let her stay.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “Why are you surprised? The rules never apply to Harry. Or to his children, apparently.”
It was so fucking good… Nothing like his fantasies… The heat of Harry’s body. The way it clenched around his cock, seeming to swallow it. The sounds he made when Draco drove into him. The way his head fell back and his eyes rolled up. The way his skin flushed with want and beaded with sweat. The way the wetness from his cock pooled on his belly.
He edged closer to the other man, slipping a hand across his back and around his ribs to hold him tentatively. At the same time, he cast a Warming charm that started to dissipate almost immediately.
Instead, he cleared his throat and said, in as light a tone as he could muster, “Stop playing possum, Malfoy. I know you’re awake.”
It wasn't until the healer began leading Draco toward the door that Harry realized it was over. Dumbledore was finished fighting, and Draco was leaving the castle with his mother. Horror flooded him, lending a frantic edge to his voice when he cried, "Stop! What are you doing?"
Draco started to edge past Harry into the kitchen, but the taller man caught him round the waist and lifted him effortlessly off the stairs. Draco, his orange-clad feet dangling a handspan above the floor, looked down at Harry and smirked.
“Prat.” The word was a caress, and it brought a sob of happiness up in Harry’s throat. “Have you done enough looking?”
“I don’t want to survive it,” Draco gasped, as another shard of pain ripped through him. “I don’t want Harry’s child in Voldemort’s hands! I would rather die and take her with me, to some place where he can’t touch us.”
Harry's shoe struck Phineas square in the face, bringing a shout of pain from him and making him duck out of the frame. Harry stalked over to the wall. The portrait was a very large one in an ornate frame, but it was hung on the wall with a simple hook, and Harry lifted it down easily. Dropping it onto the floor with a thunk, he turned it around and propped it against the wall.
"I can't tell for certain. There's something cut into his face, a figure of some kind, but it's also badly burned. And whatever it is, it was made by magic."
Alone and together at last, with a solid door between them and the rest of the Wizarding world, they covered each other’s faces with mad kisses, laughing and gasping, clutching at hair and clothing, rolling about in wild, delirious abandon. Finally, Harry managed to pin Draco on his back in the middle of the mattress, using his superior weight to keep him still. Draco lay beneath him, no longer fighting his hold, and grinned at the feel of their bodies pressed so perfectly together. Harry pushed himself up on his elbows. A matching grin split his face as he gazed down at Draco, and his green eyes shone with happiness behind his crooked glasses.
“Tried to set me up as her next trophy fuck. As if I would follow in the footsteps of Clive the Ponce!”
"The vegetable patch! Who snogs in the vegetable patch? Never mind," he added hurriedly, when Draco opened his mouth to answer, "we don't have time for a list. Give me half an hour to get cleaned up and collect my books, and meet me on the Seventh Floor, at the Room of Requirement."
"Not in you, Harry." She hesitated for a moment, then suddenly slammed a large bowl down on the counter and snapped, in a voice that sounded much more like her own, "But I could wring Dumbledore's neck for this!"
That was the signal for everyone to start talking at once. Most of it was a wash of noise and laughter, punctuated by exclamations of “
"I'll bet that old bugger, Dumbledore, hasn't even told him we're leaving. Well, Mr. Malfoy will show Dumbledore what's what."
He could feel Harry’s face brightening, even with his back turned. His smile warmed the entire room. “That’s brilliant! Tea fixes everything! Bring us a cup?”
“Yes. No.” Draco scowled still more heavily, gaze fixed stubbornly on his plate to avoid Harry’s pleading eyes. “I don’t know.”
Harry would have preferred the blank, uncomprehending looks and wandering talk of stars to this. He would gladly have sat in the window embrasure with Draco, staring at his profile, holding his hand, privately weeping at the lack of recognition in his eyes. He would even relish the sight of a Patronus bearing down on him or the feel of crystalline fingers tightening about his throat, if it meant that Draco was still alive, somewhere inside himself, somewhere Harry could find him.
“He does that,” Draco mumbled, his eyes growing heavy and his chest aching with Bob’s absence. “Impressive spells.”
In the middle of one such dream, Harry awoke with a start to find himself in an extremely compromising position. He abruptly twisted his body away from Draco's, his cheeks flaming and a groan of pure agony rising in his throat. Draco was lying on his left arm. He could not tug it loose without waking the other boy, which was simply not an option at the moment, so he was stuck. Lying on his back while his arm went slowly numb, his eyes fixed blankly on the ceiling and his body betraying him in the most humiliating way, Harry bit back another groan and silently cursed his miserable, impossible, insane life.
Draco slapped his hand away (very carefully, so as not to hit the kitten by mistake) and said, with every ounce of disdain he possessed in his tone, “This is one member of the family you will
"I don't care what you want," Harry answered, evenly. "I'm in control of the Blood Link, and I'll do what I want with it."
Dumbledore smiled in a way that told Harry he was not fooled for a moment and looked around the small space enquiringly. "It appears that you have the only chair, Mr. Potter. May I borrow it?"
When they reached the stands, Philippe led him up into the top tier of benches, where they could see the grass oval spread out beneath them and the golden hoops glimmering in the dusk light at either end. Banners flapped gently in the wind, their colors muted nearly to grey. The first stars showed dimly in the bowl of deep blue above. Draco halted, standing close beside the other boy, and tilted his head back to soak it all in.
Fudge gaped at her like a furious, dying fish, his eyes nearly popping out of his head. “You’re taking the word of a known Death Eater over mine? You’re actually
Draco shook his head and clambered over the bench, feeling strangely clumsy. He made it to the door without tripping over anything or running into the walls, but it was purely by instinct. He was halfway across the entry hall, automatically heading for the dungeons and safety, when he heard a voice hail him.
“Because that’s what the Dark Lord wanted,” she answered in her chill, haughty voice. Ron marveled that she could be so composed and regal under all those hostile eyes. “He wanted Harry Potter’s child to raise as his own, as his heir, and to fashion as a weapon to torment all of you. The idea of seeing you enslaved to the spawn of your greatest hero amused him.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, trying to ignore the foul, old whoremaster dripping poison in his ears. “Why did you come here?”
“Now, now, Harry.” Dumbledore didn’t smile, but some of the cold rigidity left his face. He looked human again. “Mind your language.”
“He’s being held special. No one sees him except the arresting officers. So you can just go back wherever you came from and quit wasting my time.”
They were giggling and whispering, shooting avid glances about the room, looking so utterly out of place that they might as well have been wearing ‘Potter fangirl’ t-shirts. Harry took one look at them, blanched, and cast a surreptitious charm to deflect attention. The two men scrambled into their coats and made a hasty escape, leaving enough Muggle money on the table to pay for their tea.
Tilting his head back, he studied his husband’s face in the firelight spilling out of the pub. “Is this how it feels to be you, Harry?” he murmured. “To know you’re welcome everywhere?
"I'll see you when I can, Harry. I'm really sorry about all this, and I promise to come to Hogwarts just as soon as possible."
"Say, rather, a glimmer of an idea. Let me sleep on it. In the meantime, we have other sources of information." Dumbledore slid open a drawer in the desk and took out a roll of parchment. Tapping it lightly against his nose, he gave Harry one of those sudden, twinkling smiles that filled his entire face with impish delight. "I received a letter by this morning's owl post. A most interesting letter."
Harry and Draco exchanged an eye-roll, while Pauncefoot audibly snorted and Marchbanks squinted at them.
Uncounted minutes later, when their breathing had returned to normal and the sweat was starting to cool on their bodies, Draco stirred
With another explosive curse, Draco swung a leg over the bench, grateful that he hadn’t bothered with robes that morning and didn’t have to contend with their long skirts in addition to his massive belly. He was struggling to bring the other leg over when Weasel grabbed his arm, halting him.
“It is punishment.” The elf straightened a little more, and her gaze fixed intently on Narcissa. “Master is telling Lissy this.”
