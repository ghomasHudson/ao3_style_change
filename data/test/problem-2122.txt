Fred snapped his fingers. “We’ll double it.”
He knew he couldn't keep all the secrets to himself. He needed—wanted—to tell someone. If it was going to be anyone, it would be Dumbledore.
“Chocolate Frog?" Weasley offered, holding up a package.
What was that all about?
"Dobby, you're still here?"
“Of course it is,” Hermione said.
"Let's give Harry time to rest," Hermione said, pulling at Ron's arm.
“Zat is what happens when you confess at dances.
He has rarely been in the Headmaster’s office. It was only the times in fifth year he has seen it and it was under someone else's decorating (who had an obsession with pink and cats). Odd objects and portraits of past Headmasters took up every spot on the wall. There was a phoenix on a golden perch by his desk. It was old, shriveled like an old prune.
"Is this my punishment?" He fell to his knees, tears stinging in his eyes. "I just don't know what to
“Really.” Draco nodded. “Merlin, I can’t believe you even remember that.” Draco felt his cheeks burn in embarrassment. “That wasn’t my most dignified moment.”
“What?!” Granger and Weasley shouted.
"Mate, listen. The dragon's hatched, and Hagrid thinks he can take care of it. I wrote to my brother and he said he could take it on Saturday night. You in?" Draco looked at Weasley dead in the eye.
so feel free to check it out!
"Yeah, so?"
Anything that Draco was thinking of disappeared. He closed his eyes and raised his hands to gather his three friends closer.
Draco tried to not frown outwardly at that, but he couldn’t help thinking that was true.
What are you on about? You can’t!”
“We don’t have to. I know that you’ve been dealing with the Dark Lord and—“
“I’m here for you, you know? You can tell me when you're ready. I'll help you."
“Oh…” Draco had a feeling he already knew about what. Defense Against the Dark Arts was never a good subject for him.
“How so?”
"ANSWER ME!” Draco demanded.
Draco took his seat, one of the kitchen house-elfs set his plate in front of him. The tinkling of silverware against the plates and the quiet noises of chewing made Draco’s nerves on end. Meals were always this quiet, but the room didn’t usually feel like it was holding its breath. And the atmosphere was
"I'll do it. Of course, I'll do it." Andromeda held out her arms. “Come here.”
Draco found himself squeezed in between Anthony and another golden blonde girl in a pale blue uniform that made the air around her shimmer.
Draco took the jumper. Draco ran a hand over the knitwork, feeling soft material under his fingers. He pulled the jumper over his head. The length was a bit too long and covered his palms. He took a sniff of the yarn. It smelled like cinnamon, pine cones, and a warm fireplace.
"Why didn't you see Harry yesterday?"
“Arthur, may I speak with you?” Draco managed to hear his father ask before Ron roped him under his arm to jump in celebration.
“Are you saying that you've been pretending this entire time? They you’re not Michael’s best friend, or Terry’s, or
So why didn’t he feel completely happy about it?
"Then, how did you figure it out?"
He got a detention. He didn't willingly sneak out. Was getting out of bed to tattle on the Gryffindors that important? It shouldn't have been.
“I guess...” Draco didn’t like how that thought didn’t settle well in his head. He was once very unlikeable too.
Draco made an unsure face, crouching down to finally look into the basket's bars. Dirty yellow eyes seemed to stare him down as the cat’s fur ringed around his upset face.
That gave Draco more satisfaction than it should’ve. “Maybe you can live with him, Harry.” Draco turned towards the boy. Harry came to before term ended, excitedly telling Draco that when Sirius is free he could go and live with him as he was his godfather. (That's
"What was he hiding behind his back?" Granger said thoughtfully.
“I’m sorry?” Ron shook his head disbelieving. “Like hell we’re going to lose to Ravenclaw!”
“I don’t step on anyone’s toes… much.”
are you?”
“Okay.” He did what she said. After a few minutes of that, they prepared to add the knotgrass. Then there was a new voice at the stall.
"They don't mess around with O.W.Ls do they?" Terry swore under his breath. "This..
"Of course, professor," Dumbledore explained.
"Wow, Harry. Are you sure you're okay?"
Draco was roughly shoved sideways.
"Let me see it." Narcissa stepped into the room, a creamy envelope in one of her hands. Lucius ripped it out of her hand and started skimming through.
“Whoa, mate, are you okay? You look awful.” Michael said. Draco didn’t doubt it. He could only imagine what he looked like. Puffy red eyes, shaky shoulders, eating chocolate for comfort like a scared child. He
Later that night, Draco stared at his ceiling replaying the moment.
. Grey eyes blinked widely at Harry's own stare (
Draco’s mood wavered. He pulled his legs up to his chest and wrapped his arms around them.
Draco thought of the times that Harry made him
"You're just a first year," one told him.
"Stop being friends with Harry Potter."
“We have to start somewhere, but we can talk about something else.” the blond hoped that Harry would open up to him about this. He wanted the closeness--the
“Then why are you—"
"I know."
"Nothing. Nothing important." His gaze didn't leave his fingers.
"It's an insult to my belief! They should at least—"
"A long story." Riddle pushed himself off the wall. "But the short version is that Draco Malfoy poured his heart and deepest secrets to an invisible stranger."
“Hey, hey, is that who I think it is?” Michael made Draco pause as he squinted off into the distance. “Merlin it is.” He cupped his mouth. “OI! WEASLEY! GRANGER! POTTER!” The blond followed Michael’s gaze and saw the backs of the trio.
Draco was already awake when the house-elf appeared in his room, but he didn't open his eyes yet. He just got into a comfortable position only a few hours ago.
"What you need?" She asked (though, with the liquorice in her mouth it sounded like "Wot 'chu need?").
Harry blushed at the compliment. "Really? Because the way I look at a Quidditch game, I seem to go to Hospital Wing after, even during." Harry shifted the books from one arm to another.
“And I love
“Yes, sir. I just wanted to let you know that Tonks says hi.”
“Mate, if you keep it up, we’ll wipe the floor with Gryffindor!” Michael grinned.
“Potter…” Draco started.
"Where did you get that?"
“Good. Er, we can go up to--" Harry started before Sirius' head poked out from around the corner.
There were brief moments where Draco felt himself trying to break to the surface of the fragile peace. During these moments, Draco would feel all sorts of dreadful and filled with panic.
He turned around to see Harry and Ron staring him down.
"'Right then, guess this is where we part. We'll owl to each other, right? Harry? Draco?" Weasley asked as he pulled down his trunk.
“I’m glad to be of help.” Lupin gave a close-lipped smile.
"To be a Slytherin, sir."
Her forehead creased. “What are you doing still standing here? The train’s about to leave! What will your
“Draco?” Narcissa called out. “Can I come in?”
"Draco," Hermione said. "It's so good to see you!" She moved out from under Ron and stood to rush Draco in a hug.
Draco dragged his feet as they were lead into a clearing.
“Very sorry, Master Draco! Dobby did not think, he didn’t. Dobby should never listen in on Master or Master’s family's conversations!” Dobby fisted his pillowcase uniform.
“It’s not
So Draco idled as Anthony scoured the floors. He tried to ignore that Cedric and Harry were still in the room, but he couldn't help but overhear their conversation.
”but I know that the Slytherin Common Room is down in the dungeons, the entrance is a blank stone wall and the password’s..." Draco paused for a moment. "‘Pureblood.’”
“Yeah, I'm good,” Potter said, stepping even closer to Draco.
Terry gave him a look and his eyes flicked over to Anthony and Michael who had a face of vague confusion.
“I very much doubt that.” Hermione wrinkled her nose but reddened all the same. “Uhm,” She skimmed the chart. “Your life line has a break which
“I’m sorry, Professor. It won’t happen again.” Draco mumbled.
The professor sighed. "I guess... this is my unique way is saying... I'm happy that you feel free to be yourself and that you have those around you that you can feel comfortable, that you have... friends that brought you back safe and give you enough thought. It's more than I ever had." Snape added, a faraway gaze overcame his face briefly until he shook himself out of it.
Draco was bitter for a few days after that revelation.
Draco fleetingly clenched his jaw. “Tonks. She says hi and congratulations on the teaching position.”
“They are presents for Young Master Draco’s friends, sir,” Dobby answered, trailing after discarded paper. “Many owls came over the days delivering them, they did.”
Narcissa cracked open the door to see Draco sagging in defeat on his bed, unable to find his wand. She closed the door behind her and went to sit next to him.
“Merlin looked down on us and gave us a gift,” Michael said, gazing up to the ceiling.
Without knowing, Draco came up to Cedric’s side. “Diggory!”
“Harry, please. I know how I’ve acted before. I’m sorry. I can explain later but please.” Draco let Harry pass him but he followed after him. “This task is—“
He began reading through the bookshelf in his room. It was an interesting mix of wizard stories and muggle novels. Draco discovered muggles had very unique takes on magic and storytelling. (He found a lot of bright coloured books that revolved a lot around Muggle school romances that seemed targeted to young girls but Draco found himself obsessed.)
"Exactly..." Harry said.
“Hm?” Draco murmured, not stopping his ministrations.
Oliver yelped as Draco whipped through, trailing after the Snitch. Harry hurriedly followed up, brushing alongside Draco.
"Yeah, you're not one to chase glory, Harry," Cedric added. "And any glory you have is because you were only doing the right thing."
"Weird," Weasley mumbled through a mouthful of chocolate.
“Sorry about that.” The boy positioned his hands on his hips. “What did you wanna talk about?”
and a
“Harry!” Sirius’ voice carried from downstairs. “Are you up? Come down here before breakfast gets cold!”
Draco’s body felt like it was on fire, shivering as Harry’s hands tentatively caressed his waist. His fingers found themselves at the nape of Harry’s neck. He made a surprise sound at the touch of Harry’s tongue pressing forward and
“For what?” Draco asked.
“Excuse me?” he wrote. The same thing, it melted away and new handwriting took its place.
"Dobby likes the new young master Draco. He's nice. Madam is kind. Dobby needs to repay on how Dobby has hurt young master Draco's friend, Harry Potter."
“Telly?” Draco asked. What was
"Oh…” Hagrid’s face turned red in embarrassment. “I’ll just… wait outside then…” He stomped his way back to the office door and slammed it too loudly. “Whoops, sorry there.” He opened it again then closed it again, this time more gently.
"Hogwarts too?" He glanced down at Potter's robes.
difficult.
“Probably… Michael keeps doubting me, though.”
“Yes!” Draco said just as loudly. The Death Eaters didn’t tell him anything but he knew that Black wasn’t one of them. It was an exact misunderstanding!
There was a tense moment of silence.
That didn’t sound right in the blond’s head, but there was only so many miscellaneous events that he could remember clearly.
"Can we have Fang?" Draco rushed.
Terry was startled at that. “You
“What’re you doing?” The blond asked.
“Hi, Harry." Draco scrambled to grab his bag, stuffing his Potions homework back in. “Can’t talk right now—“
Michael pouted. “Is it really that shocking?”
“But, it’s just so painful to watch him stumble as if he's never spoken to a--” Harry forcefully cleared his throat, passing Draco to get into the train compartment.
“Have you heard from Michael?” He asked when his mouth regained moisture. If his body wasn't struggling to maintain basic equilibrium he would be on the verge of panic.
"You came here to save your friend with no plan?" Black raised a brow. "You truly are like your father, Harry."
"Come on, just forget about her."
Draco cried out and fell out of bed, getting tangled in his bedsheets. His heart banged against his chest, fight or flight adrenaline energising his body into a frenzy. Scabbers squeaky cries sounded from his bedside table. He thought he heard the dormitory door close.
"Er, okay... Who are you going to turn into? Hold on, why do you need this?” Draco asked.
“Have a fun year, son,” Ted said, squeezing his shoulder. “Don’t think too terribly hard, alright?
Terry blew out a long breath. Michael was tossing his dormant miniature Snitch between his hands. Anthony was shaking his leg.
Ron and Hermione weren’t too far from them, but as Ron opened his mouth to ask what was wrong, Draco stormed past, ignoring him.
“No… It’s about Harry. There’s another thing that happened last year.”
"I was retrieved from my hiding place in order to restore the Dark Lord. And I have your father thank you for it, Malfoy."
Draco left the table and dashed out to the trapdoor. The ladder shuddered as Draco tried to grabble down.
Tom’s diary curled in the fire, its pages rapidly turning into ash. An insane part of him wanted to save Tom from burning and think of every apology in the book to see if he could ever forgive Draco.
“I like it,” Draco responded immediately. “I really like it.”
“Tonks says he was her mentor back in Auror training.”
The spider felt the brief moment of suspension, the feeling of being weightless before the world swallowed in black in a blink.
“Of course not.” Draco agreed as he edged closer to the door. “Hermione said she’s going to build a case for you. I could help her.”
friends. Maybe we can hang out, just, the two of us... as friends..." Somehow, the way Harry spoke that word--
“Your family… is terrible.” How else could Draco describe it?
“Can you believe Lockhart?” Terry fumed as they were traveling down to Potions.
Hermione took one chair and Ron reached to pull out the chair next to hers.
"I'm fine, Hagrid. Believe me.” Draco ducked down his head. Not letting Hagrid respond, he walked away to find Charms.
"No, I don't. Can I come in?" Draco nodded and Lucius took the invitation. His father's boots clicked loudly along the floor. Draco climbed on his bed, unable to resume unpacking. He waited for Lucius to start talking.
Andromeda and Ted went out later that day so Draco decided to do his French lesson out in the living room.
NOTE 070120: Rewriting and light editing for this chapter occurred.
Harry then pointed at the sky. “Hey, are those leprechauns?!”)
"What? I was?" Harry seemed startled.
"A second year," McGonagall's gaze seem to gravitate to Snape's. "Draco Malfoy."
“Are you mad at us?” Terry asked.
Later that day, Draco felt something like himself trying to break out of his peace. As if another being inside his head was trying to escape.
"Here you go, darling," Andromeda said, setting his cup down in front of him as she slid into the seat across from him.
When Ron showed him his dress robes later that day, Draco erupted in unrestrained, howling laughter.
"I gotta go!" Colin took off in the other direction.
And he spat it out on the floor. "Gross, peanuts. Hate peanuts."
“Are you serious?” Michael laughed. “Draco, be reasonable! He must be one of the best flyers Hogwarts had in years. He joined the Gryffindor team in his first year!” Michael pushed his bangs off of his forehead. "There are reasons for that!"
“No,” Draco shook his head. “Wait, I mean, it’s…it’s sort of happened before but never like that...”
“Where are we going?” He attempted one last time.
Michael and Terry, who were already done with the exam came at Draco's side to calm him.
Draco yelped. He jumped out of his skin as he whirled around to find Viktor Krum leaning away, arm pulled back to him as he blinked in surprise. Viktor Krum. Viktor Krum was in front of him. Viktor Krum knew his name. Recognized his face, knew his name and walked up to him. His body went into dysfunction for a whole different reason.
"Me?"
Snape closed his eyes, took a deep breath and slowly said, "Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley both seem to have... acceptable behaviours that are proven useful if put in the right situation, yet their insistence of not paying attention in my class is no excuse and will be punished accordingly."
, it’s not going to kill you.”
Harry’s arms, the soft exhale against his pulse, and, despite its faintness, Harry’s clothes still smelled like sunlight to Draco.
That was stupid. He shouldn’t try to do things on impulse without knowing the outcome… Him knowing certain outcomes was the only upper hand he has. If he didn’t adhere to that then it’ll be like pulling a Harry.
"He's... going to look for Hermione. She's here as well so he should
“We don’t need to bring that up,” Draco said quickly. “I’m just more sorry, Harry. Moody--Barty Crouch Jr--he told me--Harry, my father has been doing things behind the Ministry's back. You know what I found out? He
Draco turned around and gaped ."Harry? How'd you--?"
"What," Draco seemed startled. "Oh, yes, I'm perfectly fine." he held out the diary and Harry took it, slipping it back in his schoolbag.
“That’s the best I can do without completely ripping it apart.”
The three (Granger took great pride that she already had her hair) let their hairs hiss and all turned gross shades of green and yellow.
A few minutes of nibbling and Snape returned. Anger was clear on his eyes despite his expression not changing.
The sun was about to set over the horizon.
He’s never heard his father say that to him.
"I’m glad.” Draco’s subconscious was looking at him insanely, but he chose to ignore it.
“Take me to the Yule Ball,” Fleur said as they were saying goodbye at the foot of the Ravenclaw Tower staircase after spending the afternoon going over French vocabulary.
"Nothing." Draco opened up his textbook, trying to find the chapter on stunning spells. "Can I come with you?" He pointed the question more so at Harry.
“And we just need…” Flitwick looked around the common room once more. “Ah, Miss Chang! May you also come with me?”
“They didn’t. Oh, Merlin, they didn’t.” Andromeda chuckled to herself.
“I still can’t believe a Beauxbatons girl talks to you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"H-hey." On the inside, he was slapping a hand to his face.
“Where are we?”
“I can help with that,” Harry said, holding out a hand.
minimum of what I can do right now. I mean, Tonks told me you were cursed and I didn’t even notice--”
Draco hesitated. “Sirius’?”
Does that mean...? “So the story about your Aunt Marge. It wasn’t as amazing as you said it was?”
"Okay, love, I think you're done," Draco's witch told him and he almost shouted in happiness. Gratefully, he let his robes be slipped off. Quickly thanking the witch and putting it on his family tab, he turned away to leave.
Moody's glass eyes roved around the room and settled back on Draco. He hobbled to stand in front of him. “Mister Malfoy, I presume?”
“You know, I sometimes forget that we’re
“What? That’s not fair!” Ron exclaimed. “Those Dursleys are right wicked! They probably never even gave you a chance.” Hermione’s jaw was clenched in response. Draco frowned. Again with the muggle relatives he barely knew anything about.
“Draco? Where did you come from?” Harry asked, seeming to forget about Flint and the whole rest of the Slytherin team interfering their practice.
“I don’t know.”
. There was a conflicting debate of even if he should reveal anything since he always swore he’d keep it secret. But to keep it completely to himself wouldn’t also be smart because he also couldn’t withhold information that could be a benefit to Harry’s success in the competition or even save the hassle of being a part of the tournament. But he needed Harry to be in the tournament in order to help save Diggory.
Affection from someone besides his mother. Spikes of jealousy happened when
“I believe you,” Cho added. “I think it’s obvious, don't you think? I don’t know why we’re saying this isn’t true…”
“Azkaban did a lot to you… Didn’t it... old friend?” Lupin said quietly.
to see how you can help out just by staying home!
Terry scoffed and stared at the ground. “You’re... You're all important to me too. And I’m… actually happy that you came over. I’d hate for anything to happen to you all.”
“Don’t worry you're still one to me,” Terry said.
to see
"I knew something was wrong with you." Anthony clicked, finally releasing the blonde, seeming to ignore Harry's introduction. "I'm never doubting myself again. All that spacing out, the silence, the tiredness. What was I
Fred and George were wrestling in front of the goblet, grey-haired, bearded, and wrinkled. A botched attempt to get passed the age restriction. The commotion froze when they found themselves in the presence of a Beauxbatons girl. Fred and George hurried off and stood alongside their friends.
Lupin then turned towards them, teeth bared as he stalked towards them. Snape moved in front of them, spreading his arms out. Draco clutched at Harry tighter. Lupin snapped his jaws and lunged before Sirius intercepted, his dog form looking painfully smaller than Lupin. The scuffle between them was drastically unbalanced. Lupin bucked Sirius off and dashed into the forest. Sirius shook his head as if to clear it and also sped off into the wood.
“Yes, Mister Malfoy?” Snape emerged from the shadows, a copy of the morning's
"This is stupid, I’m not talking about this. I
“That’s not good enough. The ball is not even a week away now.”
When the boys entered their dorm, Michael paused. “Oh, wait!” the boy dug into his pocket. “Look at what I found at one of the shops!” Between Michael's thumb and finger was a golden orb the size of a big marble. “A miniature Snitch!” Terry, who was removing his jacket, rolled his eyes. “And look!” Michael poked at its surface and wings that looked as fragile as a dragonfly unfurled around it. “So... how was it?” Michael asked Draco.
you.” she directed to Lupin. “And I thought
Tonks was sitting on the floor beside the Ravenclaw Tower’s staircase, her back against the wall. She was still covered in dust, her hair was in disarray, but there was a bandage on her cheek.
"Father?"
“Michael, your banner,” Terry said.
“I want…” Draco trailed off. “You know, I can get it back at my dormitory.”
"No, that's not necessary, Father. I have nothing I want. I would rather focus on... perfecting my magic." Lucius's eyes regarded him oddly. Draco couldn't blame him, he would also look at himself mad if his actual twelve-year-old self said he didn't want a gift. "To become stronger as a wizard." He added. Lucius opened his mouth to speak, but thankfully, Mr. Borgin stopped him.
?” Terry asked.
"Books can be inaccurate." Lockhart clicked his trunk closed.
“Oh! Oh, your poor cousin!” Draco gasped, placing a hand on his chest and cheek. “I feel so terrible! That’s just so awful!”
“No, because," Terry glanced around and lowered his voice. "Potter confessed.”
His memory was failing him right now. That made a worry line on Draco's forehead. The journal was tucked away in his truck that was still left out. Making a mental note to start writing as soon as possible, he pushed himself up and shoved his truck up on the railing above him. As he sat back down he heard the door open at the same time.
Hermione side-eyed Draco, slowing her movements of pulling out her textbooks. “Draco, what do you think of Professor Lupin?”
no, and nothing’s stopping me. I don’t get why I’m so—Argh!” Draco could
“What are you doing here?”
"Wow, how's that like? Wait, that's rude. No, sorry. I’ll just..." Creevey stepped forward but wavered about going further with Draco in his pathway. “No... but maybe I should still...”
Fletcher's sneer slipped off. "What was I
"What for?" Weasley asked.
"Yeah, it's nice to have a friend like him," Harry said.
Gray eyes blinked heavily as a blurry, empty, torch-lit corridor came into view. There was a crick in the back of his neck, and his feet ached.
One night, Draco was correcting Terry's Transfiguration essay when a second year, Cho Chang, tapped on his shoulder. “Yes?"
In a loss sense of time, the dormitory’s squeaky door groaned. “Is he in there?” Anthony’s voice sounded.
shrieked in his head as his fingers flexed at his sides.
“Harry?” Draco asked to the empty air. The crying noise shuddered and there were more pauses in between of inhaling gasps. Draco reached forward until his fingers met soft material and grasped it to pull it off the other boy. He has never seen Harry Potter cry before.
Against his better judgment, Draco wrote Harry’s name. He also wrote 'hates' with more force than necessary.
"Air...?" Terry slowly said.
His nails dug into the palm of his hand as he dropped Ron onto a chair and quickly made over to the seat next to Harry.
“Excellent, then it’s settled.” Terry declared, stuffing his fork into his mouth. He turned beside him where a blonde girl was sitting. “Hey, Lovegood, can you past the cookies?” He asked with a filled cheek.
Draco read the letter as he descended down the owlery tower and was heading back to Ravenclaw Tower.
Harry looked apprehensive, but said, “Okay… Then, say what you want to say.”
"Exactly! Who would know that would explain Fudge for saying that--"
"Yeh won't have long ter wait." Draco jumped. He didn’t even see Hagrid.
“We had a fight before Christmas. He hasn’t spoken to me since.” Draco also hasn’t been speaking to him, but Hagrid didn’t ask about that.
He hated,
… right.” He repeated more awkwardly. “Happy Christmas, then.”
Another mistake. “I just--” Draco rubbed at his forehead. How was he supposed to explain? “Hermione, I can’t tell you that. I’ll tell you later.”
His eyes gravitated to the lower branches and saw his mother’s young portrait once more. He saw a twig connect to Bellatrix, then the twig seemed to sicken when it reached another portrait of a girl with similar features to Bellatrix. Andromeda Black. An aunt. He has an aunt. An aunt he’s never known about. But
Draco, unruffled and still standing, stopped mid-chew and glanced over at Terry. “What?”
“Yeah, funny.” Crabbe nodded like it was the word he lost. “You’re acting differently. Never did I even see you look at us last year. We just want to know if you’re cutting ties with Slytherin. We need someone to follow and we were told it was going to be you.”
fancy.”
Andromeda looked away, deliberating.
“Sure, what’s the—
?” Terry whined.
Draco crossed over the common room and stepped outside. Ron stood there expectant, his pet rat clutched to his chest.
Draco flicked his wand without a second thought and Harry was disarmed.
"Be careful there, mate," Weasley gasped.
“Where did you go?”
“This!” He gestured to the newspaper that showed Harry and Hermione embracing on the front page. “I know that Potter and Granger aren’t like that! Aren’t you just a
“Right. Right."
"Yeah?"
"Oh, I thought that George and Fred were—I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley. Who are you?" Draco looked away from the rolling hills to see that they were both looking at him.
Harry cast one last look at Hermione before McGonagall's sleeve blocked his view.
“That’s alright. Sorry to bother. Have a nice train ride, all.” With another gracious nod, he closed the door softly.
Draco sighed and moved back towards his friends who were rolling out their new sleeping bags. There was an awkward silence of Terry not talking to either Anthony nor Michael.
"No, really, look." Ron stopped Harry in front of Flourish and Blotts, pointing pass the display of
Ron would love to know that he found him again.
' over and over. Not thinking, he put his hands on the stone floor and felt a cold
A grey streak bolted from under the table. A boy stepped out of the way, another brought their knees up as the streak launched behind Rowena Ravenclaw’s statue.
“You know what I mean, Tonks.” Draco moved away to look up at her. “They had their second chance and they threw it away. I can’t ignore how much this changes everything. And how I did nothing to stop it.”
It was a fun scenario in his head but for it to be presented without warning and from someone he wasn’t expecting just… freaked him out.
“Yes," Draco replied.
Terry poked his head out, bewildered. “Right, this is probably the most insane one!” he gasped. He glanced over at Draco and did a double-take. “Are you eating popcorn?!”
Snape suddenly stopped, making the boy pause as well.
Draco climbed up the Minister's Top Box and saw Lucius turned around in his seat, talking to a tiny house-elf who was covering her eyes.
"Yes, Aunt."
“Please tell me no,” Ron said.
Draco woke up in the morning wondering where he was.
Terry deflated. ”Yeah, sure. Seeing as no one wants to talk about it, I’ll drop it for now.”
“We found you out cold in the forest. You were hiding out in a hollow of a tree. Dad brought you home right away. Are you okay?” Ron said.
Draco looked up to Hagrid as if he would advise on how to deal with a crying girl. Hagrid just gestured back to her.
Draco grabbed an abandoned sock from the foot of his bed and folded it on his bedside table. He set Scabbers on it and the rat slumped down to sleep. “Maybe when Ron gets him back.”
“Yes, Nil? Do you need something?” Malfoy said tiredly, looking at Fletcher with an apathetic stare that he wasn’t at all used to.
Terry threw his arm over Draco’s free shoulder, overlapping Anthony’s. “Yeah, you’re stuck with us…
“For it to be on your behalf that would mean you asked him to do it. He might’ve done it for you but that was still his decision to make. It’s not you who killed my parents. It’s not you who I met in that graveyard. You know that you’re not your father, right?” Harry huffed and crossed the room to pull the blond into a hug.
(Terry overheard from Granger that Potter looked all out of sorts the remaining days before the ball when he found out that Fleur Delacour was Draco's date.)
“Why not?”
The players trailed after each captain (not surprising that Gryffindor got the louder cheers) and Draco’s shoulders tensed when he saw Fletcher Nil walk by, a large
“Wait, did someone get my broom—“ Harry asked his teammates huddled around him.
"Please wait quietly." With those parting words, McGonagall left the chamber.
(“Those Veela are something else, aren’t they?” Draco asked Harry before the start of the game when the women left the field.
Draco was confused, he crawled over to look at the tags tied onto them. There were presents from Michael, Terry, Hermione (Lucius’ face was pinched but didn’t speak a word), even from Anthony. None of the tags showed to be from Harry and Draco pointedly ignored that fact. Draco’s felt his chest grow warm at the thought of his friends getting him presents. (It also added to his guilt of being terrible company on the train ride.)
Harry cleared his throat. “I’m not alone.”
He hated this school. He hated Potter, he hated--
Terry rolled his eyes. “Please, I know that I’m not going to hear the end of it about how I was wrong ‘bout him never finding a girlfriend.”
"Hermione!" Draco went up to the girl. "Where's Harry?"
"Oh, yeah, I think we did."
Draco nodded and quietly said goodnight before heading up to the dormitory. He staggered to his bed and slumped down.
"Harry and Ron went into the Chamber to see if they could find me. He saved me." Her gaze went back to Harry's, then it was Harry who was surrounded by the smell of perfume.
“Yes... You look just like your father. Spoken to him as well. Quite a paranoid fella, isn’t he?”
“How did you... find out?” Draco asked, wondering how did Hermione come to
"Did you know that he felt like that?"
“You’re just… acting really different.”
It’s hopeless. I mean, I lived with with reward of their crimes! Even before! You never can escape from what you’re meant to be."
Draco tried to speak again but it came out like a crumbled groan.
What seemed like hundreds of pairs of footsteps were stamping around the castle, all tailed with their names.
Draco’s heart throbbed that had nothing to do with his fast pace.
"Ron and I found it..." Ron would never be able to look at Draco in the eyes if Harry told him where they were when they found it, so he didn't elaborate.
"No, far from it.” That’s why I need to tell all of this!
“Oh, hi.”
The two braced themselves for apparition.
"So you lied to make yourself look better?"
The game made Draco feel exhilarated. Viktor Krum still had the ability to make Draco stand on his tiptoes with his Omnioculars to catch better glimpses of him in action. (Draco felt the beginnings of an archaic, forgotten hyper interest in Viktor Krum was about to grab hold of Draco and spiral him back into the fanlike obsession if he wasn’t too careful.)
Pansy pouted as she stepped away. “Thank you for the dance,” she said and, after a moment of hesitation, added, “I can’t imagine someone being better at dancing than you, Draco.”
“I hope that means yes.”
"No, really, I'm fine." Harry started talking about Snape’s sudden desire to referee the next Quidditch game, not moving from his spot nor looking at Draco. "Are you sure he's not up to anything?"
“Yeah, cool, great. I’ll see you later.” Harry agreed before practically running down the corridor, leaving a mildly confused Draco.
Was she skipping? Was Hermione Granger
“I still can’t believe you actually got on the team…” Michael muttered as Draco sat down for breakfast one Saturday in the first weeks of October, dressed in a Ravenclaw Quidditch uniform.
Draco plucked a loose string off his robe sleeve. “No, I didn’t do anything exciting, but I did just get a new broom... I was thinking to join the Quidditch team this year. Sort of made a deal with Harry that I’d beat him during the holiday.” Draco smiled at the recent memory, remembering how Harry fumbled with his words that he highly doubted that Draco could be beat him but would like to see him try.
“Yes,” Harry said.
Refusing any other attempts at changing his appearance, Tonks tried to distract Draco the last few weeks of the summer holiday. She took him to the cinema for the first time (“When they said the film was going to be about a vampire interview...” Tonks said as they stepped outside, and a few hours later. “I was expecting something a
“This dance seems so uncalled for,” Ron complained, tucking his head in his arms. “These girls-- They walk in
“He doesn’t even
"And look what you didn't do."
“Harry Potter iz looking at us,” Fleur whispered as Draco spun her around.
“You couldn’t hurt those people, Draco. I believe that you didn’t attack those people," she said. “But who ever listens to Looney Lovegood?” As if he didn’t already feel like a prick, now she had to go and say what he called her in his mind since he heard the name Lovegood. “Let me do this for you.”
“If you know what’s good for you, you’ll back off, Malfoy!” Fletcher shouted with rising panic.
Draco stopped in his tracks and turned around.
“What?”
“I did..." Ginny did talk about Michael during dinner. "Maybe I just couldn’t believe it either.”
Aunt Andromeda and Uncle Ted were searching the crowd, their hands tightly clasped to one another. When their eyes landed on Draco, the two let out a long breath.
"Tonks, I'm fine. I need to get to Harry..." Draco heaved himself to sit upright.
"True." He pushed his bangs out of his eyes just for them to got back in place, letting out a breath he didn't know he was holding in. "Something is up with me. I need your help. It's about—"
Draco didn’t know how long they stood there kissing before they separated by the lack of breath and their lips going numb. Harry kept still, eyes still closed until he opened them, glazed and happy.
“Without a second to lose, Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! GRYFFINDOR WINS!” Dean Thomas’s voice seemed to drive the sense of losing deeper into Draco’s chest.
How heartless!”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You don’t blame me? Really?” He glanced over at Harry who turned back to Ron’s hand. “All of you?”
Draco sent one last look at Hermione before he went off to find the meaning of his name.
Rumours have never spread so fast before! They were saying you were
Cho would hold hands with Cedric in the Ravenclaw Common Room, Michael went to every Gryffindor practice (with his banner that had a tiny 'A' squished between the 'E' and 'S') to cheer Ginny on. Hermione kissing Ron on the cheek when he made the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper. And Draco... felt envy.
“You actually willing to put down a bet, Corner?” Ron asked.
"Let me go." Draco tried pushing off the wall, but Granger’s wand pressed closer into his neck. “Granger—“
“What did you mean, then? You somehow think that it was all a misunderstanding? That him betraying them was a misunderstanding? Him
“I feel…”
“It belongs to her muggle-loving father. Just give it to the Weasley girl. Understood?”
“Ah, I don’t know about that--”
? "What happened?"
Luna, who was reading her
Harry was coming to as the door clanked shut.
The lurching as he swayed back and forth as he could only make terrified chitters. Draco shuddered.
"See? This is what Snape has been trying to get to all year!" Weasley said  Draco just stared at them.
“Help you?”
“You look like any other student, but you have the highest grades, yet I barely see you open a textbook except during exams. Harry never stops talking about you, Ron thinks you’re the greatest ‘mate’ ever. And even I know something is up with you. What is up with you?”
Tonks frowned at that. “I’m his favourite cousin. And who might you be?”
“Professor Snape?" the blond called out.
“Draco?” Andromeda called through the door midway through Draco's private light show and giving the blond a heart attack.
Somehow, that kiss toppled Draco’s composure more than the kisses from earlier. He laughed airily. “Yes, goodnight.”
"Oh. Sure, why not,” Anthony shrugged.
“What happened to you?” Harry asked when Draco sat down beside him on one of the couches around the coffee table.
The four Ravenclaws and Ron shuffled across the stands to find a seat at the First Task.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Alright. Let's go back to the library." However, he was stopped by Hermione.
“Easy for you to say. They’re untouchable!”
“Mister Malfoy, Mister Potter,” Trelawney said over her shoulder from her position over Longbottom’s shoulder. “Clear your mind, if you will.” Draco couldn't really ‘clear his mind’ as her words made Draco off-kilter, but he settled down anyway.
Draco silently freaked. Was he about to go to the first meeting of this organization that he could never find before? One that had him hanging around people like Filch and never could find it on his own?
Draco turned away from the bickering trio, heading towards the newcomers, wondering if they had answers.
But Harry, being the idiot that he was, took the dive again.
"I see wisdom."
"Oh, that's why you looked upset! Well, this confession is not only just about him.”
Annoyance flared up but he pushed it down the best he could.
"What?" he said under his breath. It was too early in the year to be seen with Lovegood.
“Why?”
“Did you three know?” Draco asked abruptly. “That he—Did you know?”
Carefully, Draco avoided the three the next day. Walking faster when Weasley was looking at them, giving glares at Harry, ducking his head into his Potions book when he saw Granger's bushy hair.
Draco followed the gesture to see the lone door. How was Draco on some tapestry?
Oh, it was the first thing Draco did. Harry only told him he couldn't wait to see Draco out on the Quidditch field.
(Fletcher also tried to use Ron and Hermione’s new relationship status against them, yet stopped when he and Ron got final warnings from McGonagall and Snape from ending up in the Hospital Wing too many times.)
Draco didn’t reply and only buried his head deeper in his mother’s robes and nice-smelling perfume.
“Were you thinking of going to the Yule Ball?”
"Putting that talk aside... Draco." She reached out to gently clasp her hand over Draco's. "I want you to know that it’s so good to finally meet my nephew."
At eleven o'clock sharp on the night of his detention, Draco was in the entrance hall. The wall became an interesting thing as he stood there with Filch, waiting for the other “troublemakers” that was also going to be there that evening.
Draco took a deep breath and rubbed his temple. “I owe it to Hermione.
“You are not your father. What he does is his choice. You didn’t make it for him. Whatever he did for your good wasn't something that you thought would be for yourself. Draco, have you ever stopped to think that maybe you deserve this good thing because you might not be the worst person ever?”
“Yes! You know why?" Terry started arguing with Michael and Anthony added to the noise by trying to placate the two. Gryffindor finally arrived and a confused Ron lead Harry and Hermione into the hall.
“Hello?” Anthony repeated. “Hi, our elusive friend, Draco Malfoy, makes an appearance in our compartment.”
"What did you say?" Granger prodded.
Hope bubbled up within Draco. “You do?”
Trelawney only gave Draco a close-lipped smile. She patted his hand before giving them a slight shake. “Just remember, dear child.” She leaned in to whisper soothingly in his ear, “You might not know why the universe gave you another chance but wasn't as a punishment. It was never as a punishment.” Draco felt his entire body stiffen.
Lockhart's wand was in Ron's hand before he could open his mouth.
What is he thinking? He didn’t like Pansy like that. Never had.
"There you are. Come on, dinner's about to start," Hermione said.
No Dark Mark.
"Terrific," McGonagall clapped her hands."Tonight, we'll leave it to you to tackle that monster. We'll have everyone out your way and everything. Isn't that right, everyone?" the professor's stony expression didn't change as they agreed.
“Because he defeated the Dark Lord as a baby. He probably doesn’t even remember it! Then he has to be a nice and friendly and it just makes me… makes me… sick! But then he was nice to me and then I didn’t feel sick and I was… actually
“Or maybe to start a budding relationship with that Hufflepuff, Diggory,” Michael suggested.
“Oh. Good.” Harry’s mood instantly brightened. “That’s really good.”
"Of course we can," Hermione said. "Come on, Ron."
“No, you don’t. Harry, please, hear me out--” Draco laid a hand on Harry’s arm.
"I'd like to talk to Draco about something."
“Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone!” Lockhart was all smiles all the way to the dwarfs wearing diapers and golden wings, labeling them as 'cupids'. “Now, I know some of you are a little too shy to confess your feelings to your sweetie, but fear not! I have found a solution and told my cupids to search for any Valentines hiding under your blankets, trunks, or in your dormitories!” Several people from each table tensed. Ahead of them they could see Chang looking at Lockhart in horror.
did this, along with the attack on the Hufflepuff boy," the professor said. Harry briefly glanced up from Hermione, looking at said boy in the last row of beds, "but I know you wouldn't attack your own housemate and a close friend, would you?" McGonagall's robes made a rustling noise as she walked up beside the blond, who stepped closer to the girl -- Penelope, Draco called her.
“Then where’s Hermione?”
Draco bit at his cold bottom lip. “Maybe, it’s not what it seems. Maybe--Maybe it was a misunderstanding--”
“Draco, you're my best friend and I’ve just said, not even a few hours ago, that I'd do anything for you, but if you say you can’t be with Harry because you think you’re a bad person or something I will lose
"I-I always try to, sir."
"Is it?" Harry took a chance a sat down next to him, glad the stench of the chamber was now washed away from himself.
"We've been trying to figure it out, if it had invisible ink or some sort of charm on it, but even Hermione is having trouble breaking it."
"Draco!" He spun around at the sound of his name to see Harry grinning at him. The journal was pushed into the small of his back to hide it from Harry.
“Yes, Professor Lupin?” Draco tried to not sigh the words.
“You’d never—“
,” Terry gently pulled at Anthony’s arm.
“Thank you for the offer, Professor, but no.”
Draco grinned. “Me too.”
“Yes?” Draco said slowly.
He’s been trying to figure out where Malfoy's buttons were and he wanted to try out his theories. It was time for payback for having Pansy.
Draco thought about this year. Nothing from this year has been any different except for… himself. Still, Draco was in Slytherin when Black attacked Gryffindor. How did Draco becoming a Ravenclaw caused him to attack somewhere else? What could’ve happened differently this time?
“Draco,” Harry started. “I’m—“
Grey smoke slowly turned over. Making swirls collapse into one another.
He even went out of his way and sent letters. But on the fourth try, he gave up.
and Draco felt punched in the gut. That should be him. And it wasn’t.
before continuing!
"Dolores Umbridge. She works closely with Fudge and lives and breathes for Ministry control.
When he was approaching Hogwarts’ iron gates, he spotted them. They were hugging one another, knocking shoulders, laughing. It almost felt impossible to intrude. The knot in his stomach made him feel queasy.
A (very small) rational part of Draco’s brain told him that he shouldn’t be reacting like this, but he couldn’t stop.
"Yeah, the sooner we finish eating, the sooner the meeting can start," Ron added.
“I’m his godson.” Draco ignored her buggy gape. “I’m sure some words would sway him.”
“Say Dobby, want to know who Harry Potter is?” Draco needed to complain. Something he hasn't done properly all year.
It was happening.
The four Ravenclaws were in the corner of the library, hoarding two tables to spread out the homework they already amassed with their morning classes.
Draco waited for Harry to fill up the bucket (he was waved off to provide any help) and they slowly made their way through the crowds of tents and people towards the Weasleys' tent.
Mrs. Norris instantly appeared in Draco's mind. Memories long forgotten were soon remembered.
“Well, who says that you were rejected?!” Anthony protested.
“Yeah, I don’t really go after those type of… girls. B-But surprises happen!”
Silence settled over the party.
He closed the door behind them and shuffled in front of them to lead them further into the house.
Draco laughed. “But if I’m being serious, you’ve been holding up against the other champions well. I mean, with Cedric alone showing off his amazing transfiguration skills—”
"Me?"
Draco pulled out his wand, pointing it to Moody. "Don't pretend that you know anything about me! Or that you're a professor! I know something isn’t right. And..." His hand was shaking. "And I want it to stop. I want to stop it. I will stop it!”
The boy was small and blonde, still dressed in his school robes and stopped abruptly when spotted by Draco.
Anthony sighed heavily, shook his head, and reopened his textbook. (His attempts at conversation were getting shorter and shorter with each passing week.)
"What do you mean? Look, I need my wand back, I might need to use it."
“Draco!”
, and
“Why aren’t you going, Hermione?”
“Hermione’s cat keeps trying to hunt it. Ron’s asked me to look after it.” Draco pulled out his pyjamas. Being a rat-sitter was the least bizarre thing to happen to him.
“I…” He didn’t think this through. “I don’t know how it happens, I just know it does. I want to say I knew how it happened but… er, that’s all my vision told me.”
Draco took some consideration to clean up his appearance and poked around Ravenclaw Tower in search of a lantern. He crept down the tower minutes later and tiptoed around the corridors to reach the school grounds.
Draco thought.
"Very soon." Draco nodded his head before turning with Lucius down the street, opposite from where Harry was going. "Father?"
to return. I need to do this.”
see something!” Lavender Brown announced, but Trelawney kept her focus on the blond boy.
this!
Ignoring the small voice in the back of his head that said the opposite, he left Harry’s room and climbed down the stairs to see Ron and Hermione waiting for him on the first landing.
In honour of one Anthony Goldstein, this update (was supposed to be) for celebration for the beginning of Hanukkah! Happy Hanukkah to all who celebrate! And remember: trans rights!!!
“You’re ancient,” Draco muttered. He reached up to the side of the owl’s head to feel rough feathers. “Your eyes say it all.” Errol’s eyes had a cloudy layer, showing the defining trait of age. “You must’ve seen much, right?”
"To meet my mother at Ollivander's."
“Which is why I was so surprised by you. You're very different from how he was in school.”
Krum hesitated before nodding sagely. “I think I understand. Thank you, Malfoy. I… owe you one.” The phrase tumbled slightly. He quirked up his mouth, patting Draco's shoulder and walked off.
“Where’s your sister?” Draco asked Parvati.
But despite his reddened ear at the end of each lesson, he loved being at his aunt and uncle's house.
Maybe he could actually have that, to be someone’s and for them to be his. His chest tightened with a foreign feeling like excitement or another emotion that would’ve sent him spitting in disgust in the past. Draco felt the corners of his mouth twitch up. It felt like a dream. He would really enjoy revelling in someone’s love and affection. Maybe he could have a relationship. Maybe it could actually work out.
"Then, can I ask your advice on something?"
They stood there, taking in the warmth from each other’s hand. Draco’s heart still hasn’t slowed down.
Harry skimmed Draco’s face. “I can think of a few people.” He ducked his head briefly then looked back up. “You know, I think I’m just going to go back up to my dorm. I’ll see you later.” He passed Draco quickly, seeming unaware that his face was becoming an unflattering blotchy red.
“Terry,” Michael placed a firm hand on his shoulder. “We’ll be fine. Even muggles are looking for Black. We’re going to be looking out for each other, right? We’ll be okay.”
you, as well, should be a boy, but it seems you carried a burden early. A second year should worry about exams, and something tells me what you know is far from that."
"You know about the Order?"
“See, that’s better,” Draco said as Ron pulled away to breathe. “You're almost halfway there. Again.”
“Do you think that Professor Lupin is…” she took another hesitant look at the door. “A
"But you wrote--"
"Well, then we're listening." Ron dropped his oatmeal spoon.
Moody gave him a long look. "Mister Malfoy, I'm being patient but this type of behaviour is not normal. You're acting unreasonable."
As best as you could.”
drop a heavy thing like that without warning!”
When the summer was drawing to a close, Tonks and Draco were in the living room watching a 'sitcom' as Draco was composing a reply to Harry's latest letter.
Harry curled his lips inward as if to tell Draco he wasn’t going to tell. “Harry, please,” Draco pleaded. Grey eyes found tears in Harry's bright green eyes.
"You've got to help me, Tom." Harry picked up Draco's head. "We've got to get him out of here. There's a basilisk around here. Please, help me with him." Riddle didn't move even when Harry struggled to get Draco off the floor and only managing halfway. He couldn't see his wand anywhere. "Have you seen my..." Harry saw Riddle's eye his wand with content boredom as he twirled it between his long fingers. "Thanks." Harry held out his hand for it. Riddle gave him a sideways smile. Not able to struggle anymore with Draco's weight, Harry lowered him back to the floor. "Listen, Tom, we have to go! The basilisk could come at any minute--"
“I don’t believe it…” Terry muttered, not noticing Draco as he walked towards his bed. “This is madness. Straight up madness!” He dropped the newspaper onto his bed, "And I still haven't found Draco. I swear, I'm going to lose hair over that blond oaf..."
“Exactly! Relax harder! Don't think of me as me and don't think about trying to be exactly on time.”
put his name in the goblet? But why ask him to keep Harry safe then? He couldn't accuse a teacher of something like that without proof and he
He didn’t look like the cousin that tried to break into his tower.
Draco was trying to place where he spoke such words to Riddle until he found himself no longer in the maze but in the ruined courtyard amongst the rubble of a destroyed Hogwarts. He wasn't wearing a Hogwarts uniform but a torn black suit that covered his Dark Mark, standing before tired, wounded Hogwarts students and professors as he openly defied the Dark Lord that was surrounded by his followers, his family.
“Y-Yes, Aunt Andromeda?” He answered, clearing his throat.
“Auror Tonks, please announce that the Tournament is no longer commencing," Dumbledore said.
"The girl that's now a Ravenclaw and a boy who went to Gryffindor." Draco could think of the face.
“Go away, Terry,” Michael groaned, glaring at his Potions essay carefully spread out on his bed.
Draco frowned. “It’s freezing and most likely covered in snow.”
Aunt Andromeda. Finally seeing her outside of a tiny portrait on a family tree, she had an uncanny resemblance to Bellatrix but her wild, dark curly hair was beginning to grey, there were more lines on her face, and her eyes had a warmth nothing like Bellatrix's permanent sinister glint.
name,” Anthony said. “Why don’t I remember hearing that before? Terrence is—“
None of the other boys said anything for the short time left on the Hogwarts Express.
"Are you okay?" Anthony whispered as he tried to keep up with Draco's increased pace.
Draco stared at his aunt. “Do you mean… if I like… boys?”
“Piss off!” Draco jammed a hand at the side of Terry’s face.
he asked himself later that night doing the familiar routine of tossing and turning.
“What? What is it? Oh,
“It’s this mirror shard that he and my dad—it’s not important… I was kinda surprised.” Harry said, looking all around the room instead of Draco. “What did you want to talk about? Er, I mean, do you want to move somewhere else?”
Draco thought the first time around it was Harry’s chance at a grab for attention (he made those 'POTTER STINKS' badges as a result), but now knowing Harry, it’s the last thing the boy wanted to do. Not to mention that he couldn’t get through the Age Line. How
Detention was the last thing on Draco's mind. He just saw the Dark Lord. He wasn't walking or had a body, but he was alive. Alive and breathing. Far earlier than fourth year.
"Everything."
this entire story is beta'd by OmbreOwl so give her all the love!!
“Hi, Draco.” Luna still spoke in that soft whisper of hers. “Ron Weasley wanted me to tell you that he’s outside.”
A hand clapped his shoulder made Draco's skin jump off, heart pounding. He turned jerkily around to see Anthony. “Don’t
"No, no, Dobby, please understand." Just because he's trying to fix his act doesn't mean the knowledge of him doing so goes away with it. "I was horrible wasn't I?"
“I’ll see you at Hogwarts, right?” Potter asked, hope so evident in his voice that Draco wanted to cringe.
"The twins who came in with you?"
are to pick him up soon.”
Some nights were bad. Nightmares of seeing a giant snake hiss around the manor made him weary of coming out of his room, unwanted images of the Dark Lord both in the future and from the forest came together that made Draco get bags under his eyes the next morning.
The three soundlessly opened and closed their mouths.
"Don't call me that!" Tonks snapped. "Draco's in this just as much as the rest of us so of course I thought he should be kept in the loop."
"Fine. Sure. But something's up with you, Malfoy, and I'm going to figure out what it is." the snooty tone of hers was back.
You-Know-Who’s back, but what actual proof do you have?” Zacharias Smith asked.
"That's--amazing--" the blonde managed between breaths. "I can see it now,"
"What? Why would Fudge do that?" Ron questioned. "Dad says he never ignores the law."
"What? What is it?"
"I wasn't feeling well... I went to Hospital Wing."
The words on the paper seemed to make his eyes burn, so he rubbed them, letting his fingers rest at his temples as he continued reading. He almost slipped out of his seat when a hand slammed down on a passage about illusion charms.
He really didn’t want to. “Sure,” Draco said offhandedly. “He can stay with me.”
"Er, what about it?" Harry moved his head all over the room but not in Draco's direction.
"Enjoy the dragon, Potter." Hagrid spewed his tea on the three as he shut the door.
“Oh, wow, how
"Well," Hermione turned towards Draco. "I've already suggested it to Harry and Ron, but Harry doubts that it would work."
Fletcher's unpracticed smirk turned confused when he glanced at the blond. “Why are you looking at me like that?” Nil demanded. Draco let his face slip back to passive.
His attention went back to Harry and shocked to see how serious Harry looked.
Narcissa opened her small presents of sparkling jewellery and Lucius received dragonhide gloves that filled the whole room with their new scent.
"Who is the student?" Madam Hooch timidly asked, standing beside Snape. "What's the student's name?"
“She’s my cousin, Harry.”
A vein on Draco’s temple pulsed. “Ron, don’t make this more difficult than it needs to be. Just. Take. My. Waist. Now!”
“Why? What makes you think you think you can say something about this?”
“Draco!” Was the only warning before hands started pushing him forward.
But he used to.
Draco gave a watery laugh. “Sorry to say, he’s known my crying face for a long time.”
"I'm going to get cleaned up," Ron said suddenly, scratching at a track of dried mud on his face. He and Harry walked over to the door as Lockhart nodded obediently at McGonagall's whispering.
“As much as I can be,” Draco answered.
"How did Draco get like this?" He suppressed the shiver he got from looking down at Draco's motionless body.
"Fancy meeting you here, Malfoy," Ron said airly, already knowing that Draco also shared Top Box tickets.
Sorry for the short chapter but I needed to make an announcement. As you can probably notice, HRI has a final set of chapters! After five years, I've come to a decision that it's been long enough and its high time that this story reached its end. So, no more sporadic updates. I declare this to be an official (but last) hiatus so that I can focus on school and complete HRI/the HRI outline I have without keeping everyone in the dark about when the next update will be. I'm thinking about either publishing the chapters either weekly or in bulk and risk spamming everyone's inboxes.
“Yeah, what’s so funny?” Terry asked. “You were giggly when we got off the train too. You also kept waking me up with all your laughing throughout the train ride.”
Michael turned beet red. “I was talking to someone. Nevermind where I was.” He dropped into the empty seat beside Ron.
Draco’s suspicions cleared slightly. “Oh, then sure. Of course, I’ll help you.”
“Nothing,” Terry said, not explaining any further.
dying
Potter’s eyes widen at Draco’s words, obviously not expecting them.
"I wish, the only one who's not breaking a sweat is Draco over here." Michael nodded over to him, seeming to materialize next to the blonde.
Oh, the rich satisfaction of being right.
“Alright, see you tomorrow,” Sirius muttered, picking up his broken chess pieces.
He read the letter once more, his face burning even more. Draco didn’t recognise the handwriting. It was smooth and neat, as if someone poured hours into making it look this nice.
Draco’s body turned to lead. In major events of his life, Buckbeak didn’t do anything but instil an unneeded fear of hippogriffs, but it was still terrible. The creature was pleasant (at a considerable distance).
"How do
“What do you want with Scabbers?” Ron demanded. “He’s got nothing to do with this!”
heavy editing was done bc it was that ugly
Crookshanks leapt off of Hermione’s lap. He brushed his body against Draco’s legs before situating himself at his feet.
"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't leave now!" Harry took a step forward.
“Sorry about your broom.” Draco cast a look at the pieces of wood in Harry's lap.
He stared at Sirius’s photo, then at Andromeda’s.
"Yes, yes, there's much to discuss. Ah, thank you once more, Professor," Fudge reached out and shook Snape's hand. "Thank you for bringing Pettigrew to us and saving Sirius Black and Harry Potter."
The four Ravenclaws stepped off the train, awkwardly bunched in a corner of Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters.
“Please say something,” Draco said.
"Ron!" Hermione scolded. “Honestly! It was only a simple bet.”
"Do you know how Draco got in possession of the diary?" McGonagall asked.
“Oh, give her my well wishes, then.”
There was a noise off into the dark and Draco looked over, seeing something flicker near a distant pillar in the shadows. His eyes narrowed to search for more movement.
and rendered his mind in clouded paranoia. All the years of thinking he could single-handedly change the course of history… What was he thinking?
.” With a force she’s never used before.
Tonks was looming over a figure on the floor, her foot planted on their chest, her wand pointed with a singular focus. She was slightly heaving, her nicked cheek bleeding slightly.
Draco would much rather wake up in his bed and be seventeen again, Dark Mark and all, than be walking to the train station for his "first year" at Hogwarts. His father was pushing his trolley to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, wearing high-end Muggle clothes along with Narcissa, distaste stuck on his face at the feeling of cotton than silky robes. Draco was perfectly content, wearing a large jumper and denims (sneaked in by Dobby).
?” Draco asked.
Few screamed when Harry started falling to the ground, thunder thudding Draco's chest. There was a swooping downfall of Draco’s stomach as Harry was saved by a sudden spell that slowed him before he hit the ground. Dumbledore and other teachers came onto the field and placed the boy on a stretcher and carried him off-field quickly.
“Wha-- No, no!” Draco waved his hands in front of him. “I mean, why do you need to know?”
“I don’t—“
“I—Sorry, what?”
"Yeah?" Harry could feel his pulse flutter.
“I didn't think so. Draco, I need to tell you something very important and you can never forget.”
“I’ve been fine. I...” Draco’s eyes drifted over to a blanket-covered adult snoring in the corner. "That’s..."
?" She dug in her robes and pulled out the magazine.
“He can’t do that! That’s an invasion of privacy!” Anthony muttered, but Draco really wasn’t listening because he was still looking at the Gryffindor table and noticed Harry was one of the ones that tensed, his fork dropped in mid-air.
Draco let his legs stretch back to a sitting position. “I-I tried to be helpful. To both of them, I tried to be helpful and all they did was throw it back in my face. Just--” Draco made a helpless noise, feeling upset. “It’s… hard trying to be a good person. A nice person.” He confessed. “Especially when no one seems to notice.” Draco set his head on his knees. “Or even seems to care. And it’s not like me to be a good person. Why does it matter then if I’m a nice person? Why even bother trying to change myself when it’s obvious no one is going to change their mind? That I can't erase what I've already done. And what I've done was be horrible and cruel."
“This here is Fletcher Nil, and his father was so nice as to give the whole team gifts.” They held out their new
"It's in here?" Draco asked as Potter left the cloak on Draco's shoulders, running towards the tall mirror in the empty room.
"Why did you never tell us that you were a Seer?”
alive.
you knew something!” Hermione brightened. “When did you figure it out?”
He found dark red eyes.
"What's wrong with kids these days!? The youth has been
Draco shuddered at the recollection of his tiny paws, quivering furry body, and the sensation of crawling up a pair of trousers. “
He blinked and the figure turned into Harry.
"Draco, it seems that you need to sit down--"
Draco turned his head away to pout. His eyes roamed around the Great Hall and paused at the Hufflepuff table at the sight of Cedric Diggory smiling with his friends.
” The voice of Molly Weasley rattled Draco’s plate. She sounded beyond angry and it gave him shivers. Draco quickly grabbed his journal from the floor and leaned to the side to look around Terry to see Weasley’s forehead sticking out from the table as a red Howler was floating in front of him.
"Yes, professor."
“I know it must be embarrassing to have this conversation. Merlin knows I hated having these conversations while I was at school.”
“It would be unfun to go with someone zat I don’t know. I want to go with a friend. So,
"Uh, no, Ron saw you through the window and I..." Harry seemed to lose his words. "Just wanted to say hi." Harry finished. "Hi."
Harry snorted as he moved away from Draco’s range. “You said it first.”
"Draco, that's forever away."
He chose the better of the two.
“Now,” Aunt Andromeda cupped his face. “Have a good year, dear. Be good,” She dropped a kiss into his hair. “Be safe.”
The grounds a darkened almost pitch-black blue. Draco tripped and crashed into Harry, grabbing his shoulders for support. Draco glanced up at him. Bright moonlight made one side of Harry’s face glow.
“Here, I’ll help right now.” Draco picked up his wand and pointed at the parchment to gather up the ink. The ruined Snitch was never completed. “But are you actually going to pay attention?”
Nil froze. Pansy saw right through him.
The Fat Lady took in the blond’s tired eyes and fumbling with the dirty rat. “Good heavens, you look like you could use the holiday.” Draco shot her a glare. “Just pointing something out, dearie.” She put her hands up in surrender.
“What…” Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly. “Dobby, what’s this about?”
“You sure you have everything? Your books? Quills? Robes?
The last thing he needed to think was
“It’s… complicated. We’ll explain it to you soon enough.”
"You can't--does that mean he's not--" his heart clenched painfully.
"Lockhart, just the man I needed. A student--my godson, no less--has been taken by a monster. Taken right into the Chamber of Secrets. Lockhart, your chance has finally arrived."
Snape's face remained impassive as Fudge and Dumbledore left. He moved towards Draco's bed.
Lucius' shoulders jumped as Draco sat beside him. "Son! There you are... Where did you get
"Sorry."
"Meet with me tonight. Don't tell anyone about it. I'm only going to tell Ron." It sounded rather personal to Draco, something that he shouldn't be part of.
“Draco!” Narcissa gasped. “Don’t say that!”
At last, towards the end of the book, Draco turned the page to see a paper-thin tree sprout upward. It grew branches that bundled together to cradle small portraits of past Blacks.
“Because you want to talk about it,” Tonks said.
“Er… And then we do a dip, right?” Ron cheered and grappled at Draco’s upper back and waist.
"I guess not." Harry tried to shake the vile feeling away. It wasn't working.
“We needed that for dinner, though,” Ron said, frowning at the drenched grass.
"Okay..." Potter said, but he looked like he still didn't understand.
“I’m fine with just sitting here. Though… I think you should admit it.”
"For the Order?" Draco clarified.
He was… panicking. Why was he panicking?
The forest was black and silent. Harry, Granger, and Hagrid went to the left of the fork while Draco and Longbottom went to the right with Fang. They spent the few minutes wondering. Draco, looking for glimpses of unicorn blood, Longbottom, practically on top of him clinging on tightly.
Fleur gathered herself and introduced herself.
Draco’s quiet pleas fell on deaf ears as Tonks peeked at every door, muttering to herself until she paused in front of a particular door.
Draco giggled as he pulled the fabric off him and got to work. He managed to cut off the outrageous ruffles, removed the ‘Great Aunt Tessie’ smell, and vanished the antique print pattern on the robes so all that was left was a respectable dark brown.
"I'm sorry that you were cast out of the family."
Draco told Chang they’ll talk strategy tomorrow and lingered so that Luna could shower the rat with a squeaky voice of affection before she went to the girls’ dormitory for bed.
Draco went to his desk and wrote a quick letter to Michael asking if he was safe and if his father was okay. Sudden exhaustion made Draco's knees buckle and he slumped over his bed. He was in a light sleep when there was a soft knock on his door.
“Uh… Narcissa, wasn’t it?” He asked pleasantly. “What can I, uh,” He glanced back into the house. “What can I do for you?”
“Can I go up and see it?”
"Now," Draco replied. "I'm going to learn now. I'll make it up to you guys. Somehow."
“So, a telly is something you can watch programs on.” Ted eased him on the couch.
Harry, still trying to return to earth, shook his head. “A date?” He repeated.
“I think you best be going.” Narcissa breathed. “Draco’s probably wondering where you are.”
“That’s enough, Macmillan!" McGonagall shouted. She gave orders to take Justin to the Hospital Wing and to waft Headless Nick up the stairs, leaving them alone.
“We’re cousins on my mother’s side. Once removed.” Draco answered immediately. Sirius gave him a backwards glance. “It’s was on my mother’s family tree.”
“Er… I was talking about the Triwizard Tournament. Didn’t you say You-Know-Who is back?”
“Real amazing!” Fred said as he and George heaved him up onto their shoulders. There was another round of cheers.
"Sorry, Draco, but we needed to talk to you. It's about Snape." Granger said.
As he approached the great oak doors, a lone figure seeming to drag his feet back up the flagstone steps. Fletcher Nil was muttering to himself, his hand tucked deep in his pockets. He wasn’t going home for the holidays. Nil faltered when he saw Draco. His gaze flicked to the blond’s suitcase. He clicked his tongue, gave Draco a stinging scowl as he passed him, knocking his shoulder into the silent boy.
A shriek made everyone in the common room look up. A girl pulled her feet up from the floor, her arms wrapped around Cho Chang’s arm. “Something ran over my foot!”
"Well--" Draco's fingers tapped on the diary's surface as if he was nervous. "Well, maybe it's just a blank diary, Harry,"
“Narcissa," Andromeda chided softly. "Don’t cry, please. You always had the most dreadful crying face."
When he returned to the bathroom with the ingredients in hand, they were all surprised.
"I suppose so..." Hermione rubbed her eyes with her robes. "How are you always this confident?"
Who could like him? No one he knew could send him this. It was definitely for him, but who sent it? He was the most hated student in Hogwarts!
Mrs. Krum nodded her head. “It’s an honour to meet you, Dumble-door. But vhy am I here?”
Ron hurriedly grabbed Draco’s hand and placed his hand on his waist and they went off on the most choppy waltz Draco has ever experienced.
"So, Draco," Harry finally spoke. "How are you going to be spending your summer?"
Tonks and Sirius were still in the kitchen, but there were now playing Wizard's Chess. Tonks made a move that decimated Sirius' last chess piece.
Unable to help it, Draco’s gaze moved over to Harry’s. “I had it over the summer. It’s the Triwizard Tournament. It’s happening this year.”
Tom knew everything about him, about what’s to come, but after his talk to Dumbledore, Draco knew that if he ever lost this diary… everything would be ruined. This dairy was becoming dangerous. It was just a giant accident waiting to happen.
“She’s… pretty cool,” Michael said, scratching the back of his head and beaming. “She likes Quidditch.”
“They’re not powers,” Draco said. “And…” His mind was blank on who actually won. It was too long ago and unimportant in the grand scheme of things. “I’m not going to tell you.”
“Yeah, and your grandparents are visiting?” Anthony questioned back.
“Are you waiting for me to start talking?”
A woman stepped out from the kitchen and Draco felt his eyes blow open wide.
Draco didn’t know how long he sat there, back against his headboard, arms locked around his legs, his head aching as too many thoughts shoved themselves inside his skull.
His lips turned down into a frown. Listening back in, he heard Harry ask. "But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?"
The next week, all that was talked about was the attack, and Draco did everything in his power to ignore all of it until… he forgot why he was ignoring it in the first place.
"Mr. Malfoy," Harry mumbled. Hermione repeated the greeting.
“Young Master Draco.” Dobby’s voice sounded. The blond’s fingers jumped to shut the book and push it under his sheets.
“It’s going to be alright, son,” Uncle Ted rubbed Draco’s back. “Come on, let’s get you home.”
“Yeah, kind of,” Harry bit out, scrubbing a frustrated hand through his hair. “Why'd you wake me up for?”
"I-I can't say, Harry, er, Draco made me promise." Colin shifted from foot to foot, visibly gulping. "And, and," Creevey seemed to steel himself. "stealing someone's stuff is wrong, Harry!" he said. "but I still think you're cool, maybe--"
Mrs Weasley placed a bowl at an empty table setting. "Ah, there you are! Here you go, dears." She gestured to the two empty chairs before her.
Harry blinked. “I was? Er, I mean, I wasn’t.” He turned away and scratched the back of his head. “I was just…”
owe it to Hermione to make this a good night for her. You will not be an awful Yule Ball date.”
“I will.”
“I already know that too.”
“The most awful.” Harry nodded solemnly.
That morning was the first morning in a long while that he felt refreshed after sleeping. A few days ago, the students returned back from holiday break and returned to their skittish ways of being afraid when Draco so much as breathed. He was in the corridor, heading to the library to study with Anthony when someone tapped his shoulder. When he went to look he was surprised to find—
They both were quiet and watched the red light turn green.
“Did you see Michael and his date?” Draco asked, smirking.
His mind quickly supplied an answer; Saturday.
"You know how much I wanted Slytherin to lose their winning streak? I was gonna rub it all over Goyle's face. Now, I can't do that. So, for the time being: Ignore them." That got a couple of nods from the students next to them. On instinct, he leaned off to the side to see the Gryffindor table. Cold shoulders were giving to the Golden Trio along with Longbottom.
Draco wanted to groan in his hands. The constant circling ideas about relationships was honestly tiring him. He knew the basics of his feelings and thoughts on the matter. He liked the
"I don't know, but he had an adorable mouse with him."
The three situated themselves to sit at the base of the tree. Michael dug into his pocket and pulled out his miniature Snitch. Its fragile dragonfly wings unfurled and hovered over the boy as he jumped at it with Draco quietly watching. Anthony tipped onto his back and watched the branches sway in the light wind.
"No, I want to tell you. I..." Harry gulped very loudly, confusing Draco so very much. “care about you a lot, too. And I—I—need to say is that-- what I need to say is that I really, really,
There were distant sounds of roaring, rumbles, and a final screech before it quieted.
Was he really about to go through this? What if it wasn’t what he expected? What if he isn’t cut out for this type of thing after all? Should he bother with Harry with this when the Dark Lord is back—
Draco cared for Harry, nothing tampered with that fact but knowing Harry’s feelings… It made him off-balanced. He wanted to keep the acknowledging thoughts in the back of his head, being shoved away more and more with each passing day.
“He’s fine, Narcissa,” Lucius said. "Just nerves, though he should not have any.” He directed the last part towards Draco. “Can you at least consider dressing
Draco turned to look at the house-elf that his father was talking to.
Harry smiled. "I don't doubt you."
"Quite, actually," Potter laughed weakly. "You?"
“Do what you want, Draco. We won't push you. Terry, shall we?” Anthony wrapped an arm around the boy. “We’ll bring back sweets.” Anthony shot a grin to Draco, yanking Terry by the shoulder out to the dormitory door.
Draco’s shoes squealed and his robes left droplets in the wake of his path as he walked towards the hospital wing. The blond sighed, wiping his wet bangs out of his eyes. Can this boy have a Quidditch game that didn’t end with him in a hospital bed?
"How was Ravenclaw tower?" Lucius was so close to spitting out the word.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat.
Later that night, the four went to sleep in a bundle of blankets and pillows on the floor of Terry's bedroom.
"No!" Potter hissed. "It's here somewhere."
It was better to just ignore it.
“Morning, Potter. I do say that this is a new record,” Anthony said, breaking the banter. “This time I think it was almost instantaneous that you found us.”
“I, er, it’s been great,” Harry answered, taking the lead back to the water pump. “I mean, you’ve read my letters. I’ve been living with Sirius ever since he was granted release. And not too soon. Before I left, the Dursleys were about to put Dudley on a diet.”
The wailing howl made Draco’s ears ring.
“I’d go back to sleep a moment later. So what happened?”
No. It would be better to wait.
Ron raised a hand up. “Uhm, what’s the Triwizard Tournament?”
Crabbe and Goyle laughed at the insult.
“What?” Draco faltered.
Draco shrugged his shoulder. "It's like a... pet oddly. You stroke its spine and it falls to sleep. Hag--The professor must be quite a character this year."
“Nothing! It’s nothing!” Draco hissed, frantically scrubbing at his flaming cheeks.
“Professor? Professor?” Lavender Brown asked cautiously from her roundtable. “Professor, are you alright?”
that is
“Let me do this for you. I like to help.” Her blue eyes stared up at him, never wavering.
“Yes, yes, such charming features always come from Malfoy men. Who’s your mother?”
He hasn’t been openly angry at Harry in forever and it almost felt normal. It almost felt
"No one." The woman said hurriedly. She pulled the young girl away.
"Ron,"
“Don’t even try that—
“Oh…” he said out loud and more writing appeared.
The four pairs of champions took their position. Draco stepped out from Fluer’s side, holding out his hand in anticipation for the music to start.
“It’s alright that you didn’t.” Ron backtracked quickly, waving his hands in front of him. “Harry doesn't really like to talk about that sort of stuff."
“What happened at the Yule Ball. We never have to talk about it. We can forget the whole thing."
to him, shining with an emotion that Harry couldn't figure out... He blinked and the other boy was flipping through the diary's pages.
He hated when Dumbledore was right.
"It won't Father. I've learned to be more careful. You don't need to worry."
“Why not? I’m not going to dance that much.”
“But Aunt Andromeda said it rots your brain.”
The man was blending in with the shadows, his face in a pronounced frown, but he nodded his head and said, "Hello, Draco."
"That's right, Gilderoy." Professor Sprout dropped Flitwick that was coming to on the floor as she stood up. "Didn't you say that you knew where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets was this entire time?"
"Cousins," Sirius greeted.
When Michael sent the letter about his father managing to get tickets he also said that he and Draco must meet up, they must. Draco asked how they were going to meet up in a place they’ve never been to before. Michael said that Draco should just get onto the camping grounds and they’d figure it out from there.
“I’m not answering—Wait. What are es-kah-laters?”
“It’s not your fault,” Draco waved a hand, trying to not let the admission sour his mood. He pinned up a smile. “We'll tell the others about dinner.”
Lupin hurriedly excused him and told Michael and Terry to take him back to the castle so that he could rest.
. He could take solace in that fact, at least.
Ron turned towards him. “You don’t know about Marauder’s Map?”
"You would not
He slid closer and awkwardly placed himself at Anthony's side and the boy’s arm hesitantly laid on his shoulders.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I would think so…” Draco titled his head in thought.
“Funny.” Goyle tried.
to help find you.”
“Cool!"
He was in Ravenclaw, he was friends with Harry Potter and better friends than ever before, he might’ve helped prove Sirius Black innocent, his father and godfather were inspired by him to be better people. With the help of his new friends, Draco stopped being less of a prat and got him through everything. He wasn’t really Malfoy anymore. He hasn’t been Malfoy for a very long time.
"Lovegood!" She stood there, her robes more rumpled than before and now a red sweater was peeking out of her robes. "Luna, hi."
“Despite what… I feel for Harry. I think I’ll never have someone like you ever in my life again.”
Draco didn’t know how to explain that he knew completely.
But now here he was, surrounded with fantastical sights. Each space of the camping grounds was squished with people and towering tents, loud noises of singing and laughing, people hanging up large flags and other extravagances of the country they were supporting, children sped passed, sparklers and ribbons fluttering from their hands. Draco was to find one specific boy at one of the biggest wizard gatherings in the world.
What's happening to him? Sleepwalking? Did the future start taking matters into its own hands? Is he no longer in control over his
Draco had to squeeze himself in a small space so that Crookshanks couldn’t sneak in.
"Are you okay?" Tonks asked. "Do you need to wait longer?"
Draco slapped his hand away. “That’s not what I was going for!”
.” He quickly stuffed his Snitch into his pocket. “That’d be weird.” He took in Draco’s outfit. “Why aren’t you more dressed up?”
“Is something wrong, love?"
“Mum! I’m fine!” Terry pressed against her but she didn’t budge.
“Mrs. Weasley. You know, your friend’s mother.” She handed him the postcard and Draco took it, his brow furrowed. The postcard had the Weasleys smiling and waving at him, all wearing jumpers with initials and red hats on top of their heads.
Draco felt himself get tunnel vision. It became harder to breathe as his heart frantically tried to keep beating. His body locked with primal panic.
Tonks glanced over and did a once over of Draco. She stood and rushed him into a hug.
“Breaking curfew, are you? You don’t look like the sort.”
"Draco, how do you think I'll look with long hair?" Michael asked unexpectedly.
“Please,” His mother implored. “Let me speak to her. Please. I beg of you.”
"It looks fine, dear. Go along now, Draco."
“You really don’t think it can be fixed?”
The four talked. Complained about classes ("I'm
”But he said that the Chamber of Secrets has opened before… or he didn’t tell me that.” Eyes shifted from person to person, absorbing the new information.
But he wanted to know. It sounded important. Draco actually wanted to
Andromeda pressed a kiss into his cheek. “Be good. And remember to keep up with your French!”
He once joined Ted on a trip to the ‘supermarket.’ (He got scared of the sliding doors but then proceeded to hover near the entrance to watch it open and close. He adored the idea of doors opening up for him just by his mere presence.)
“Nothing. I’m not doing anything!” His shoulders hunched from being found. Staring after Diggory and his friends
The glow of red was making shadows on the trees. "Longbottom! What the hell?" Draco didn't like Longbottom as all for most of his life. The only time he was a tiny bit bearable was when they were in seventh year and finally grew a pair.
"Harry?" Draco's mother turned around towards him. Her eyes looked down at his bloody robes, then travelled up to his scar. She saw Ron trying bat Lockhart's hands away from his dirt riddled hair. She looked back at Draco, an obvious question in her eyes:
“I’ll be back later,” Draco called over his shoulder, moving towards the bright campgrounds of the Quidditch World Cup.
Draco pulled his scarf tighter around him, scowling at the fall wind already being way too cool.
"You're brilliant!" Harry gathered Draco into a hug. He could smell the sweat and the grass from Harry's Quidditch robes. "Absolutely brilliant!"
“The biggest idiot,” Terry added.
“Yeah, out of fear,” Terry repeated.
“Listen to her, you don’t have that much time to begin with.” When the two left the bathroom, an awkward silence filled their presence.
"No, professor, understand. I really have no idea how I—"
tucked under his arm. "Are you alright?"
“This handsome boy here is Crookshanks," Hermione said eagerly. Got him over when I got this year’s school supplies. Poor thing needed a home, no one would take him, it was just so sad.” Hermione crooned, her voice high and airy as if to soothe the creature. “Don’t you think he’s the most gorgeous cat you’ve ever seen, Draco?”
“Correct!” As Moody hobbled back to the front of the classroom, Draco slowly sat back down, beyond confused as his heart thudded. How could Tonks let herself be mentored by a man like that? There was no way that this was the same Moody she admired.
When Penelope was leading everyone to Ravenclaw tower, Lovegood held back until she was trailing after Draco. He couldn't do anything about it since he was caught in Terry's story about this summer he swore a vampire was hiding in his house.
"Oh…” Draco croaked. He sat there in silence, debating if he can just leave or did Dumbledore have to give him permission.
“Harry!”
Harry turned around and Draco almost ran into him. “I know what this task is. You don’t--I need to go.”
“Oh, yeah, mate, absolutely!” Michael interrupted. “I mean--Don’t even worry about it. I'm just going to hang around these guys,” He gestured to Ron and Hermione who were now smiling too widely. “Don’t even worry about it, don’t stress. Honestly, it’s the right thing to do, right? Right. I’ll see you in a bit.” He turned around and brought hands up to Ron and Hermione’s backs for them to do the same. “Weasely, Granger, let’s away,” he announced before pushing them forward and leaving Draco and Harry alone.
"N-no reason! Dobby will go now! Bad Dobby!" the house-elf's high voice brought Draco out of sleepiness.
“Draco! Hermione! We have so much to tell you!” Harry breathed, his footsteps thudding with the overlarge shoes.
After he left the Owlery, he went back to his room to hang up his coat and prepare his thoughts (stall, really) before going to his father’s study to apologise. Steadying his breath, he rapped lightly on the door, feeling like he was pounding his fist against it. When there wasn’t an immediate reply, Draco had a panicked thought that he wasn’t even inside before hearing a muffled, “Come in.”
Mrs Boot released her son and turned to the three of them.
"Hermione? Are you ready?" Goyle asked, knocking on her stall.
Draco left the kitchen and tried to shake off his nerves. He held his breath as he crept up the stairs and passed by the curtain portrait to go down the hallway. He reached out the door and entered an unused bedroom. The furniture was draped in white tarps, spiderwebs developing in the corners of the ceiling.
As Harry continued to stay silent Draco felt his stomach sink and he looked away.
“You’re all jittery now when it comes to Cedric Diggory.”
The entire kitchen was bustling with movement to get everyone seated, bowls of soup being passed down the table.
His mother didn’t have this reaction before (or not he’s known of). Draco was sent home early after the game and it wasn't until he was in the middle of it that he remembered what happened that night.

"No, no!" Draco wrapped his arms around himself. "I'd
“I’m sorry it took so long…” Draco said almost in a daze.
“Bow, mate,” Terry whispered and Draco took a deep breath. The blond’s eyes focused on Buckbeak’s yellow eyes and bent himself at the waist.
try to get in trouble with her.”
Hermione puffed up her cheeks. “No one. Why are you bringing this up?!”
“The Second Task is champions rescuing something very important to them from the bottom of the Black Lake."
"Ah, I left something. I'll see you guys later." Pushing his fringe out of his eyes, he slung his bag over his shoulder, leaving to go to Ravenclaw tower. He passed the library on to see Potter standing outside. "Harry?" Potter turned around, looking away from inside the library. "What are you doing?"
“I just didn’t know you had someone in mind. Do we know her?”
The library was filled endlessly with bookshelves that stretched limitless to the ceiling. Draco walked down the shelves of unmarked, dark leather spines, undeniably about the Dark Arts. Draco remembered he used to walk up and down the shelves, relishing that
“I’m… from the future—“ Draco almost ripped out the page. It sounded even stupider in writing.
"So you actually call him that?"
." His mother came into view, wrapped her arms around his shoulders, looking down at him with a smile of her own. "I'm..." His mother was wearing a short-sleeved dress, showing an unbranded arm as well. “I'm free..." There had always been a constant fear inside him. Fear of never being good enough for anyone. Not for his father, not for the Dark Lord. Always be a perfect Malfoy, the Dark Lord's next generation. And yet Draco in the mirror let his mother ruffle his head, laughing all the while like he never had to worry about anything.
“Oh, her and I have become good friends. She’s really a very nice woman. She says she has a special gift for you.” Narcissa rummaged around the box and pulled out a knitted midnight-blue jumper. “For you, love.” She held out the garment towards Draco.
Harry this time around. Harry knew a lot more about Draco than he ever did and the blond wanted it to be the same for him.
"Move along, Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall said and he finally scurried away to the blue table.
“Yeah, I think I will. Sorry for dragging you out here. I don’t… I don’t know why I did.”
“Draco, w-wait up!” Draco almost winced at the sound of that. It was always Malfoy, never Draco.
Draco ... didn’t really have a suitable opinion that would satisfy anyone. He remembered the story of Black’s arrest (who didn’t?) and his apparent loyalty to the Dark Lord, but when he joined the Death Eaters, they mentioned Black as a traitor (especially his Aunt Bellatrix) and never spoke his name without their faces twisting in disdain. He knew what the stories told him about Black’s connection to Harry and his parents (Draco felt an unwarranted wave of pity), but there had to be more to the story that he never knew. Black was later proved innocent after his death but Draco never found out the cause of it and how much had to do with Harry Potter.
Wait, Terry didn’t actually mean that. He was joking.
But, Draco would be a liar to say that he never thought about having a relationship. A giant liar.
“I know, that pale weasel gives me the shivers too,” Terry shouted in his ear to be heard over the loud booing from the Ravenclaws around them.
Harry suddenly looked fearful. “Well, it didn’t come up in conversation.”
“I—“ Draco didn’t know.
Draco huffed and pressed the back of his hand to his cheeks to feel heat. “Never do that again.” He snapped before climbing out of bed.
There was another flash of light.
Voices were calling out Draco and Harry’s name. The blond recognized the closest one as Anthony.
“Then
He was stalking the corridors looking for the fleeing redhead when Harry almost ran into him.
“Hm.”
"Actually, we have a few questions. What else is guarding the stone beside Fluffy-"
Draco fought over the large crowd and escaped and found them at Hospital Wing. Harry was already in a bed with two chairs pushed up to the bedside seating Granger and Weasley. Harry's entire arm seemed deflated.
Tonks chuckled. "You know Molly'll have your head if she finds out you let Harry roam around by himself."
It was

can’t ask someone?”
Harry pushed against the crowd crashing into them. Each rough shove made Harry’s grip on Draco’s hand tighter. Wooden support beams were collapsing in on themselves, showering them with sparks and embers. Draco managed the sight of a looming Death Eater before Harry noticed and yanked them in a different direction.
Draco could see the loss in Harry's face when he saw the splintered pieces of wood wrapped in a blanket. Harry set the blanket in his lap as his fingers ran over what was the broom handle.
“Can one of you...” Draco felt his face go warm.
the one that sent the love note two years ago? He didn’t remember her being a poetic sort of girl but it could be possible... and Draco had liked it all the same.
. And, apparently, he was stuck with them forever. And, apparently, he was fine with it.
“I do. Just... Why have I never met you before?”
A stack of textbooks slammed onto the table, drawing annoyed glances from nearby tables. The four looked up to see a fuming Hermione with Ron and Harry behind her.
"No," the man said. "I have no idea how Draco got hold of that diary." the way Lucius stiffened his shoulders made Harry think otherwise, but he held his tongue.
." Anthony defended. Draco smiled briefly before pulling his schoolbag in front of him to look for his Potions book. He found that it wasn't there.
“I swear, you’re a strange one even by wizard standards.” Michael shook his head as he reached towards his own copy of The Book of Monsters. (It growled around the thick rope tied around it. When asked about this problem, Hagrid explained that all you have to do is stroke your book’s spine because
“Hey, Draco?” Terry poked his head inside. “

Harry pulled the blank roll of parchment towards him. “I always pay attention to you,” He said matter-of-factly.
“Draco, hey,” Anthony placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “You had a bad day. It happens. You didn’t want to talk about it. I should've understood that.” He glanced over at Terry and Michael. “
"Thank you, Harry."
Terry clicked his tongue in annoyance. "Look, we don't know where he's going to be! That lunatic is probably heading to Hogwarts as we speak!”
“What? Yeah.” Draco shook his head in forced nonchalance. “Just…”
Draco's outburst seemed to further surprise her. “You’ve heard of me?”
"I'll try." Draco watched as his mother stepped off the train, joining her husband. Slightly waving, he stared as they walked away and went off the platform.
Many on top of the tree were greyed, obvious to show that they weren’t around anymore. Draco was surprised to see some of his ancestors were held on frail, withered branches as if no one would care if they suddenly broke one day.
“Are we there already?” Ron asked.
“I missed talking to you, too.” Draco huffed. “Does this mean we're friends again?”
“Hi,” Harry said.
Draco situated the rat to better sit in the palm of his hand. “I’m giving him back to Ron. Father would feed him to the owls if I brought him home.” Scabbers squeaked in protest at the idea. The three boys were about to follow him to the Gryffindor tower before Draco said, “I’m only going to drop him off. I’ll meet you guys on the train.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, looking at Creevey’s bowl of grapes and his giant muggle camera hanging on thin, measly straps.
“Dumbledore, come with me,” Draco pleaded, pulling at the professor’s sleeve.
“I should think you deserve it if you were messing around the Forbidden Forest this late at night.” Madam Pomfrey scolded, pressing her fingers around Draco’s chest. She tutted when at Draco’s disgruntled noise of pain. “Yes, that’s most likely broken. What made you go into the Forbidden Forest in the first place?"
“Draco, did you nap on the train? Is there still sleep in your eyes?” Anthony asked.
The day just kept getting worst for Harry. He, Ron, Fred, and Geroge were sitting at a table in the corner of the Gryffindor Common Room. Despite how everyone was crowded together, no one was saying anything, and it made Harry feel worst. Fred and Geroge tried to coax him into talking, to say
" Harry practically spat. "Sirius says it’s starting just as it was last time, that it’s happening
“Oh, I see ze others,” Fleur brightened. “Come on!” she yanked Draco over to the other champions.
"You don't know how much I'm... happy that we're friends." His eyes shifted away, unable to speak while looking at Harry. "I was never--good at keeping friendships. Friendships that I could count on. I was either too untrusting--or I trusted the wrong people." Unwanted emotion got stuck in his throat. Draco took a moment to collect himself. "I was never quite good enough to feel like someone should've cared about me that wasn't... my mother. Meeting you was new. You were insistent, you seemed
“What?” The compartment’s occupants were staring and Draco kept his head down. His least favourite habit of spacing out seem to be coming back with more vengeance. “I, I don’t get why you’d be after Black either. It doesn’t make sense.”A loud whirring noise came above their heads, startingly everyone expect for Professor Lupin who was still sleeping soundly. “What’s that noise?” Draco asked.
"Really? Now?" Ron said. "Of all the times the Heir to strike, they pick
Harry nodded. “No, you aren’t.”
"Yeah, kinda had to..."
Draco scampered back to the Ravenclaw Tower. As he stared at the top of his canopy bed, he tried to deconstruct Moody's message.
“You need what?” Snape said, his frown deepening.
it’s also about you no longer trying to deny this part of you you’ve been trying to reject. If you say he’s trying to get over you, then probably nothing will happen when you tell him. But at least you told him.”
"Yes, sir—“ The office door opened with a bang and Hagrid barrelled in.
“Draco.”
“Don’t blame me! This is weird!"
Finally, Anthony sighed and closed his textbook. “You can't avoid Potter forever.”
"It's all here, in your head. You have more knowledge than most in your year. In any year for that matter..." Draco gulped, but still tried to seem like he had now idea what the Sorting Hat was saying.
“Hallo Harry.” Fleur greeted and then looked at Ron. “Hallo… Harry’s friend.”
Hagrid went to change the subject. “Uh, Thanks fer workin’ on the case with me. Both of ye. Merlin knows I’d wouldn’ know what to do.”
Draco took a peek at the boy’s parchment as he set his own textbooks on the table. “You didn’t even start it.”
The admission brought a lot of
“… Arithmancy…”
"I might get the I'm-disappointed-in-you silent treatment from my father."
Potter’s jaw tensed and gave Terry a long look. He stood up abruptly, pushing back his chair and walked away from the table and towards a circle of people talking off to the side of the dance hall.
“What mess, sir?”
“Dad said that? Why?” Ron shifted Scabbers in his hands. “And if he thinks that Black’s after you... why does he think that you’d go after him?”
“Did they… get any better then? Do they
“Hold that thought.” Cedric eased closer to the goblet and let his parchment be swallowed by flames. The surrounding students cheered him on and Draco felt his stomach bottom out.
All day, classes were being stopped by one of the burly dwarfs barging in and passing out love messages to everyone. Draco was ready to gag if he had to hear another say-out-loud poem beginning with ‘roses are red and violets are blue’.
—responsible for any now. Draco tried shaking his head, as if that would make him appear in Ravenclaw tower, but he stubbornly stayed in the deserted corridor.
"Ron, darling," Hermione held out a hand. "Do you think you could sit beside Harry?"
"Of course."
“Well, I did try to be reasonable by playing nice with my aunt, but we know how that turned out.” Draco unintentionally smiled. Harry snuck a glance at Draco’s vague smile. “I’m on pretty bad terms with them after that whole thing.”
“Course you do! I just found it strange… My cousin inquired about my old mentor and told me things that didn't make sense… Kept telling me things that Just to find out it was a joke all along… You didn’t teach me to be an idiot, Moody… Well,” Tonks shrugged. “If I should even call you that. So what did you do to Draco?”
“Fine, fine. I’m fine.” Draco used the wall to help him get to his feet. “Just--I’m fine.” He took deep breaths, committed to not look at the teacher.
"Son," He, too, gave Draco a hug, though it was much shorter than the one shared with Draco and his mother. "What happened?" he asked, pulling back, holding the boy by the shoulders as he looked him over.
of all people had a brief relationship with a Durmstrang girl in the fourth year and would have
“Please, I don’t think someone in our year can do that to a cat. I mean, we all hate Filch, but taking it out on his cat? That’s stupid. Besides, doesn’t that seem to go against the Gryffindor code or whatever they got?" Michael crossed his arms.
“Of course. I’ll see you then.”
“Not your fault. It’s not your fault. You were under a curse.”
“Ron, it’s Harry’s life you’re talking about. You can’t just meddle around it and try to play Cupid.” Hermione admonished.
Draco didn't come down from the dormitory until mere minutes before sunset.
“Can you do that?”
The next week, Draco walked out onto the Quidditch pitch nauseous and tense. It was finally the match against Slytherin. He was finally playing against Fletcher Nil.
At the groan of the door, several owls swivelled their heads at the sound. They inspected Draco, a few readjusting their stance on a perch or moving their large eyes to watch the boy step inside. When they saw that he was harmless, they went back to eating or cleaning under their wings once more.
Their eyes slowly turned to him.
"You feel better now?" Tonks asked as she smoothed down flyaway hair strands.
Ron snorted. “That much is obvious.” He looked over at Harry. “I mean Harry was only trying to tell the truth and she gave him detention!”
“Oi, Draco Malfoy! Still need to deliver this note!” The cupid's scratchy voice yelled behind him. Draco didn’t worry about how Harry paled when he saw the cupid, and just start running again. Dashing down every hallway like a madman, he felt himself slow down until the cupid collided with his knees and sent him down. The dwarf sat on the back of his calves, making Draco the loser in this chase. “At least I don’t have to read it out loud," the dwarf grumbled, letting the envelope flutter in front of Draco’s face as the weight on the back of his knees disappeared.
Draco felt his hands shaking and balled them up to steady them. “I felt like I couldn’t do a lot of things when I found out about my… ability. I saw a future and I needed to follow it exactly. Then, I tried to go off on my own but I was still stuck on the fact that I already knew certain events in the future. And… you surprised me. For a long time. I’ve tried to find the answer. Of why I was given this… gift. What was the purpose of letting me have this? I just wanted an answer to make sense of what my life became. And I never did. But,” Draco moved closer to Harry. He heard the boy intake a small breath. “Someone told me that if I managed to find something, if I found someone who made me happy and made the universe make sense and gave me hope for a good future, then I shouldn’t let them go.”
“Will ye?”
Draco was almost touched. "What's wrong, Harry?"
"Harry—" he blindly grabbed for Harry's sleeve. "Run. Move."  He forcefully made Harry move as Quirrell began drinking the unicorn's blood. Harry doubled over, pressing his fingers over his scar. He almost fell to his knees, but Draco kept him up, Fang nipping at his ankles to keep going.
“Wanna pierce your ears?”
“I think I already know I'm going to be one..."
"Mr. Malfoy."
“No. Why’d you ask?”
drew perfect art for this fic and im????still????in shock????how was this story blessed with such talent??????
“I could’ve beaten him. I just wasn’t fast enough.” A spark of frustration at himself prickled under his skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, Draco—“ but he saw a turquoise-clad teacher sweeping down the steps so Draco pretended he didn’t hear him.
"Something moved about in the trees. It wasn't an animal." Longbottom was holding on to himself, most likely scared to ask Draco for comfort.
here? You’re not supposed to be here.” Draco pointed the question to Flint, ignoring Harry.
"No, she's talking with some Durmstrang people. They're really interested in those 'Nargles' she's always talking about."
“Molly?” Draco’s brow furrowed. No one in their family had a name so simple as Molly (at least, not on his mother’s side).
“Well, who are you hoping to ask you?”
“A Pepperup Potion? I don’t need this.” Draco pushed the bottle towards Terry’s plate.
“Just get some rest, Potter.” Draco settled on.
“Yes, make sure it doesn’t,” Snape said evenly. “I’ll speak to you later, Mister Malfoy.” He nodded and gave one last glance at Harry. “Mister Potter.” With that last remark, Snape continued down the hall, his dark robe fluttering.
“Just go.” The two left and Draco tightened his grip on his wand, too scared to let it go. It made him feel better that he had his wand again. A sense of familiarity that would never be changed. Something to ground him in this bizarre game of chance.
He instead pushed his bangs out of his eyes as he saw a cabinet. He never knew if there was anything in that cabinet. He reached up to the handle and—
“Harry, I’m sorry,” Draco turned away, his chest squirming. “I don’t think… I’m still trying to understand…”
“Can we talk?” Harry Potter gritted out.
Moody shifted his stance and he grinned crookedly. “I was sent because my father, and the Ministry for that matter, couldn’t handle the greatness of the Dark Lord."
Ron bustled in, sloshing around a cup of water. "Here, here." He handed it over to Hermione. "I'll go get Mum."
“I’m fine! I’m just happy to see you is all.”
“Hi, Draco.” I haven’t talked to her since the train ride.
“Fine.” Draco shrugged. “Boring. Oh, wait. I actually wanted to ask you something.”
A werewolf! Right in front of us! How did everyone miss that?”
“So…” Hermione cleared her throat. “Who'd be the type of person
“Whatever, I just can’t wait to see Viktor Krum!" Michael gushed at the name. "That’s mostly who I’m here to see! Merlin, to see in real life! In action! Viktor Krum!”
"Who is she?"
"Hurry up then!" Harry couldn't help the glare he gave Ron who just shrugged, giving more rapt attention to the conversation now.
“Wait, Lovegood—“ but she was already down the hall and out of sight.
“I don’t see the Dark Mark on you.”
Her nose wrinkled at that name. “Call me Tonks,” She held out her hand. “You must be my dear cousin Draco. Mum told me about you.”
If his friends were around Harry enough they could see that Harry had the right kind of humour that could make Draco laugh and see why Draco missed Harry’s company so much.
“I don’t know, maybe… You’d think I’d be a good prefect?” Anthony asked.
There was an archaic feeling of uneasiness as Draco stood on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, letting Aunt Andromeda smooth his hair.
“That sounds wonderful.”
"Bewitched to look like outside," Draco said at the same time as Granger did, who was a person behind them in line. They locked eyes with each other.
“Now," Dumbledore brought the focus back. "Let’s give the same spirited greeting for the students of Durmstrang Institute!”
"Well, it doesn't matter now, come on, we have to go over here." Anthony greeted and pulled them in a train until they reached a free carriage.
He didn’t know anything about what happened in that maze, but he could warn Harry,
“Okay... what's that?" Draco has never been more confused in his life.
“Of course, I’ll take you to the Yule Ball.”
Harry's fisted curled and tackled Black.
Draco gave a weak upward quirk of his lips but he let his head turn back to Nil.
“I’ll even go with you.” Draco volunteered. He turned to Michael. “If that’s fine with--”
“Let me see!" Michael said, yanking the newspaper out of Anthony's hands.
, how it made him feel so isolated from the others.
"Then I'll never have to pick up a book."
The dread of second year hit him halfway through the summer. How could he forget what happened? The Chamber of Secrets was opened. Students getting petrified... professors breathing down everyone's necks. The first time around was awful enough, now he must endure it again and closer to Gryffindors that surrounded the whole thing?
“Harry!”
"And Lockhart, come on," Harry grabbed Draco's hand, leading him back to the front of the chamber.
"Do you think that'll work?" Harry also got up from his chair. Ron nodded.
"But with that magic he was doing, Fred..." A pang of guilt went through Draco's stomach at that name.
"It's very true! I have to endure the pain of being near a... blood traitor, but that is the only way I can be close to Harry Potter." He tried not pause at the traitor comment, but he couldn't help it.
The two tensed and Draco slapped his hands over his mouth. They waited a few minutes before relaxing so that no one stepped out into the living room.
When lessons were over, Draco walked across the school grounds towards the gamekeeper’s hut. He knocked on the door and startled at Fang’s booming bark. His eyes expanded at the realization of having to talk with Hagrid by himself, with no one else there.
"Only you two blondes I ever saw all last year. Didn't you notice that? Now, I think I see two."
Draco was never that important for such a task.
“Oh, I doubt that. You’re a very handsome young man. And very polite as well.”
“Ah,” Sirius nodded. “From that side of the family. With Bellatrix.”
“Michael says he’s got a date for the Yule Ball,” Terry said, still swinging.
Fast recollections of Umbridge interrogating Harry, even went as far as to
. The world seemed the darken. Harry didn't remember where he was for a moment until Lockhart's voice broke through along with Ron's nudging.
Draco looked at the hallway entrance the sound of the name and sat up as his mother rushed into the room.
"Stand."
"I think he haunts me," Harry admitted quietly. "I hear whispering… I think he's in my head. I dream of a long hallway.
"Ready?" Harry called out.
"Follow me. I'll take you back to the Ravenclaw tower." She started walking very fast. "Hurry up."
Terry peeked one eye back to the two.
“Oh, I see how it is.” Flint’s eyes flicked towards Draco before going back onto Harry. “Well, if you
“You don’t understand how much this will help me, Tom. Thank you so much.”
“I think it’s a nice
“And what the hell is that?” Draco said, frowning.
than a friend. I want us to be…
“Are you sure?” Anthony asked, not really wanting to leave Draco alone at the moment. "It's not a problem to go with you--"
“That’s excellent to hear,” she removed her hands and headed back to the stove where a pot was boiling.
The chilling of cold air around them made him sure it was no mistake.
He heard the common room’s door creak open with sounds of loud talking and rushed footsteps and stuffed the robes hastily into his trunk and started buttoning the—
riddle answer:
"Difficult?" Draco hissed quietly.
“But I shouldn’t have yelled like that. I know I shouldn’t have--”
“I’ve… been a mess. I worry, constantly. I never worried for anyone but me and my family before. It's a... new experience.”
Harry was still trying to recover his breath when someone groaned in pain across the chamber.
Terry came into the dorm, dressed in his own refined outfit, and found them instantly. “There you two are! Come on, Luna’s waiting and I’m dying to find out who Michael's date is.”
Draco heaved a relieved sigh and picked up his quill.
!” Harry shouted in Michael’s voice. “
“Of course.”
“Because, it’s about the, the… I don’t need to explain myself.”
“Draco, don’t—“ He stopped, looking at the letter in Draco’s hands and seemed to forget what he was going to say. “Erm… what’s that?”
“I’ll take him. Thank you, Luna.”
“Maybe…”
“Ye seem to be getting worse.” Hagrid put his free hand against his forehead and he almost fell backward.
comments kept this fic alive so all is appreciated!!
"Harry, cousin, don't stay in the threshold! Come here!"
“As my godfather, can you trust me?” Draco pleaded. “Take him to Dumbledore. We can't let him escape.” There wasn't a proper reason that he knew of for this, but he knew enough.
"No, I don't mind. I'd never mind," Harry said offhandedly, still staring at Draco before shaking his head. "Er, come in." He stepped back to empty the doorway.
"You both are shivering. Come on, Hagrid's over there. Detention's over."
"I'm a memory. Stuck in the pages of a diary for fifty years." He pointed to the black diary on the floor, but Harry didn't process it, intent on trying to get Draco to safety.
He can't do it.
,” Fletcher Nil spat as he continued passing by.
“Dobby has heard of terrible things, he has.”
to be true. It’s—“
Even with the burden of exams was nonexistent, he felt jumpy and kept looking in the corner of his eye to see if any shadows followed him. Draco had more sleepless nights, each dragging on until one time he was still tossing and turning as he heard the other Ravenclaws get up for breakfast.
At least we can say that.” Roger Davies, clasped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “We can still take third.”
“T-The Dark--Young man, this is a poor joke. Especially during this--”
…” Anthony shook his head.
. If he wanted to act like that once more then
"Oh, my God!" Micheal yelled. Draco opened his eyes when he saw Harry swerve in the air.
"Well, what about-" Fang growled at a moving bush. "What's that?"
“Morning,” Terry returned halfheartedly, body stretched across the compartment seats, pillow under his head. “Don’t expect the others to join us. It’s just going to be you and me now that Anthony’s off to be a prefect. Did you get a letter about that, too?”
He saw Draco sitting on an infirmary bed, eating a bar of chocolate when he entered the Hospital Wing.
"Why are you so mad about it?"
Anthony paused. “That can’t be right… I always thought…”
“Trust me, Harry, I haven’t been angry with you for a long time.” Draco gave a weak smile.
Draco nodded, squeezing his mouth into a squirming line to choke back laughter as he calmly said, "It looks fantastic."
“What?”
“Ron, take Draco.” Harry shouldered off Draco towards him and disappeared into the darkness.
to a boy looking at the books laid out on one of the display tables.
“Such a vile woman,” Draco mumbled as his thumb stroked the broken skin. Harry hissed and Draco took his thumb away. “Sorry! I didn’t mean to.”
Harry cleared his throat. "Draco,"
“There’s no way he got out of there in one piece,” Terry said.
! Give her the love!
Clearing her throat she said, “Thank you all for coming.”
Stories had been passed around by Death Eaters that the Dark Lord had used Quirrell a long time ago as his vessel, but then the professor had proved unworthy. At the time, Draco believed that, considering that the teacher wasn't ever seen again after vanishing. Now he didn't want to go to Defense Against the Dark Arts to be proven right. The scent of food made him look away and he filled up on roast beef.
“What…?”
All grammar/spelling mistakes in prior chapters have been corrected by OmbreOwl. (To the greatest extent.)
“You were?” Harry blurted.
"Draco," a stern voice called out to him. Snape was at the end of the hallway, looking like a shadow in black robes.
"Harry Potter." Grey eyes glanced up and he saw Potter looking at him head-on. Potter blushed pink and ducked down, turning to Weasley to start a conversation.
A sharp, insane smile grew on Tom Riddle's face. A half-hearted chuckle slipped from his mouth, then another came, and another until he was howling with manic laughter.
Terry hesitated for a second before scrambling out of his chair to follow. He trailed after them, seeing them go out to the courtyard.
The Beauxbatons placed themselves at the Ravenclaw benches.
“T—thanks, Draco!” Harry stuttered and started running down the corridor. "I'll tell you later!"
"Funny, I don't believe you." Draco went towards him again, but Harry backed up until he was standing on the first step down, his other leg still on the floor above.
Hermione gaped. “I-I-What?”
He pushed himself out of bed, extinguishing his wand and stuffing it in his back pocket. The other four-poster beds in the dorm had their curtains drawn close expect for Anthony's who seemed to forget. Mindful of Anthony's light sleeper habits, he carefully walked passed the boy's bed. Anthony shifted and Draco froze. He only murmured and turned over in his sleep. Letting out a relieved breath, Draco slipped out of the dormitory.
"It's nothing, really." he tugged on their hands to start walking again.
Potter said he wasn't going to his aunt and uncle's place for Christmas and signed up to stay at Hogwarts. Draco, remembering that blue and bronze patch on his robe, thoughtfully stayed at Hogwarts too.
? Draco, what’s all this?” Anthony was looking at the top books of Draco’s giant pile on the breakfast table as Terry moved his bag off of the bench so he could sit there.
"Er, no thank you." The blonde shrugged and bit into the chocolate bar one more time before he sighed and let his hand drop in his lap.
“Do you ever sleep?”
"Coming!" Draco called out and hurried out the front door.
Unless…
“This’ll scar.” The words
"D—D—Dobby is just doing some extra helping out, Master Draco sir! Helping out Master Draco! Keeping Master Draco safe!" the tray in the house-elf's hands began shaking.
“Everyone!” Anthony held out his hands. “There’s no need to go off about questions. I doubt he can just force one out anyway.”
What happened to both of them?
Draco smiled over at Harry. "I'm very glad we are friends, Harry. More than I ever thought I would be."
"If I'm in a good mood."
“Did you see who did this, Peeves?” Dumbledore asked the poltergeist.
“You do not understand, Draco,” Fleur said, rambling her last-minute nerves even on the day of the task. “I made a fool of myself last task! I cannot do zat again!”
Draco twitched awake at the press of wetness on his forehead. His eyes opened to a fuzzy Ron and Hermione looking worriedly over him.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked.
“No, I think you have to.”
Draco swallowed thickly. He knows better, he learned his lesson, he didn’t have a reason to actually be afraid. He knows the etiquette of these animals.
Draco was also learning a lot about the outside Muggle world.
"Figures," Ron crossed his arms. "Of course she'll tell you. Why can't I get a relative like that?"
“You excited?”
“Harry,” Draco called out. He hurried to step in front of the boy. “Harry! Listen to me! You have to listen to me.”
"For Christmas. It was supposedly my dad's."
"No! No, no. Just... I thought you hated me..." Harry stopped walking. “You’ve avoiding me for the last few weeks." Draco stopped walking.
Harry swore.
Snape's face was incomprehensible.
Draco pulled his shirt on.
about dragons?” Ron asked.
That made Draco pause. “I was? It did? Then why didn’t you say anything?”
“I see... myself." Draco in the mirror was seventeen, his real age, but this Draco was different. He was smiling like he did it every day. Mirror-Draco gave a slight wave and his sleeve dropped seeing a… pale arm.
“It’s… nice to see you, too.”
there anything you can tell us about this year?”
Hermione’s dot wandering around the library, Anthony’s heading towards Ravenclaw Tower, Ron and Terry hovering around the Great Hall, Michael’s dot walking beside Ginny Weasley’s. It even showed the Durmstrang headmaster, Igor Karkaroff, walking beside Viktor Krum. (Madame Maxime's was oddly walking beside Hagrid’s.) Even showing Barty Crouch leaving the Defense Against the Dark Art’s classroom.
“I’m freaking out! I don’t have anything to wear for the Yule Ball.”
"Draco! Where'd you go?" Tonks whined.
to love him, he was connected to them in some way. If Snape wasn't his godfather than he wouldn't help Draco with anything, Draco himself would do the same. Crabbe and Goyle, they were walls he used to push away others. Pansy was just a lovesick girl and Draco took advantaged of that.
“Right, pureblood. Right then, I’ll show you.”
But how much Draco wanted it to be possible. He wanted to be with someone.
traitor?
--another Professor Lockhart.”
"And it's not like he got Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. Merlin, forbid. In the compartment, you didn't see Harry Potter get out as well?" His mother's voice was light, they way she talked to house guest she hated. Lucius didn't speak for a very long time. He seemed to be thinking about something long and hard... "Draco, explain how you are not friends with the Weasley and instead friends with Harry Potter."
a more advanced form of magic than the third-year level, I’m sure that it’s something you’re well capable of.” he gave an easy smile. “They’ll take place Thursday evenings at eight o’clock. You’d also be learning alongside Mister Potter if that makes a difference.” Lupin squinted at Draco’s frown. “
"I know Draco wouldn’t do such a thing. He’s jus’ a quiet student.”
Ron’s frown deepened. “Don’t wanna.”
“I tell you.”
,” Draco said, glaring to the outside. “Just. Don’t.”
“Good to hear, good to hear! Well! Off you go now, Malfoy. Don’t be late.”
Ravenclaw kept a steady pace of scoring, easing off pressure form Draco, but Fletcher looped around him like a vulture. “Are you ever going to play the game, Malfoy?!" he screamed. "It’s not to be as fun to beat you if you don’t!” Draco cursed under his breath and sped far from Fletcher.
“Calm down, Ron! I can fix them up for you. Transfix them maybe."
“It’s fine. Do
"Draco?" Tonks called as she pulled on her coat. "You ready? We have to get back, Mum's waiting."
“I’ll just wait out here.”
"Maybe, Mr. Malfoy should be taken to the Hospital Wing," Dumbledore suggested.
“Come on,” Tonks urged Cedric up. “There’s more important things happening than some measly tournament. Cousin, help him sit down over there.”
“Who…?” Draco trailed off.
“Really?” Draco asked.
"'Arry!" Draco had never been so happy to see the half-giant. "Where do you think yer goin'?" As an eleven-year-old boy, Hagrid was now larger than ever, more intimidating as he towered over the two boys. He was holding two large ice creams, one obviously for Potter, the other for himself.
"Yes." Potter gave him a small nod.
"It’s something huge—no one but you can probably understand it. It’s about the future—It’s about Harry—I need to tell you now—“
"Me too," Harry said softly.
One of the things Draco has noticed in these continuous study sessions is that Harry didn’t like to listen. Often when Draco would be speaking, the boy retained nothing. The boy would look at Draco, but only just. Harry always zoned out with his gaze on the blond. What the boy could always be thinking about Draco had no idea.
"You're not!"
Draco risked peeking inside the kitchen.
at the Gryffindor table at breakfast.
“Yeah, I do.” Draco didn’t make any move to get up from his mother’s lap and she didn’t protest. She continued to smooth out Draco's hair as the boy contemplated.
Weasley. No matter how many times Weasley tried to say that it was safe because Moaning Myrtle, the ghost that haunted a toilet in there, warded away any trespassers. Draco wanted to say Myrtle warded him away too. With winter breezes showing, the tiled bathroom had a chill to it as well.
This was not the way he wanted to start his morning. Cramped in a
of all people! And right before the Yule Ball! Who'll ask me now?"
“Woke him up!” Michael announced to everyone when they entered the kitchen. “Had to interrupt a dream to do it though, I think.”
Heavy hands grasped at him.
“No,” he answered as he pulled on his outer robe. “And even if someone did, it’s
Draco thought about it, a horrible muggle aunt who became a human ball and lift up into the sky. A smile broke when he huffed a laugh. Then a chuckle spilt out until it was laughter.
"Coming, Sirius," Harry answered, following the man further into the house.
“I-I don’t know,”
"How's that's supposed to help me?"
“Dammit.” He fumbled around his bedding to see if his wand was in the covers. "
“For what?”
Harry felt he had an idea.
"Oh, you agree with me." The question came off as a surprised statement.
"It's one of the houses at Hogwarts. You see, we are sorted into four houses and our housemates are who we will have classes, share dormitories, and sit with at meals." Draco's had that 'does-this-ring-a-bell' tone to it.
“Boot,” Harry Potter sighed, collapsing into an empty seat beside him.
"It has happened," McGonagall's voice was clipped. "A student has been taken in the Chamber itself." Professors started whispering worriedly. Harry could see Professor Snape was steadily silent.
A tense moment passed and a man opened the door. He recoiled when he saw Narcissa. Blond-haired, dark-eyed, a well-worn button-up, he looked beyond astounded to see Draco’s mother.
He must've said something wrong because Terry gathered the newspaper and slapped the top of Draco’s head.
“Yes.”
A Hufflepuff student was looking up at the ceiling. His eyes were blank and he was rigid and cold. Draco also noticed the Gryffindor ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, was right beside the Hufflepuff, his transparent body smokey and blacken. A lump appeared in his throat. He was never this close to any of the attacks last time. Never. But here he was, like…
!” He yanked at Malfoy’s wrist and pulled the blond back.
“No, no! You think you know everything but you don’t Draco. Not this. You don’t know
“Sounds terrible,” Draco said with a flat tone.
“Right, right. Alright.” Michael sent one last glare to Terry as Anthony and Draco pushed themselves in the compartment. “Did you do anything exciting this summer? I’m just
Draco felt his eyes burn from being too dry. He didn't sleep well last night.
Draco looked around the train platform, trying to catch a particular boy getting on the Hogwarts Express. Although he didn't find the boy, he found someone else.
Narcissa pressed his trunk into his hand, paying no mind to Mrs Weasley. “Hurry on, Draco. Remember: Be careful." She said once more, pressing her ritual kiss on top of his head.
“He’s the closest person to you.”
“What?! No, I don’t! Forget I said anything!” Hermione flapped a hand, giggling madly. “I’m just being-- I think I need to go to the library.”
Draco looked up at Michael to frown but then blinked, finally taking in the wording on the boy's face.
"You're nice. Usually, I'm being asked to leave now." She didn't look up but instead flipped to a new page.
Tom’s handwriting was loopy and big as if he really
"Maybe a large platypus since they can lay eggs," Terry said with a finger. "Draco?"
Draco made sure he picked an empty compartment. He dropped his truck in with a loud thump, not bothering to move it out of the aisle as he flung himself on the seat. Rubbing tired eyes, he pushed his blonde hair away to look at the compartment's ceiling. He was alone and he was confused by that. Usually was the time that Harry and Weasley found him, leading to a discussion over Quidditch while Harry tried to follow helplessly. He dug deep into his memories... they did something this year at the feast... and it involved a Howler somehow. A very loud Howler. It seemed so important back then now it was hard to even remember it happened.
He almost slipped away at the front door of the gamekeeper's hut if Weasley didn't catch his arm. "Draco, where are you going?"
“Do you find it a good thing?” Draco asked playfully, bouncing ahead of Harry to get out of the chilling autumn afternoon.
“Anthony!” Terry hissed and hurried up to the blond.
“Er, what?” Terry sat up. “What are you doing here?”
"Draco. Usually, I have people I sit with, but they aren't here strangely."
Divination was a disaster. Professor Trelawney kept saying that Draco’s Inner Eye was the most cloudy she’s ever seen from a student.
“What about me?” Draco asked before he knew what he was doing.
"Oh?"
Draco yelped. “Ow! What was that for?!”
Dumbledore looked to him, unexpectedly looking startled.
“You’re telling me...” Draco responded.
, if Harry still somehow gets chosen. Wouldn’t that be… kinda cool? Dumbledore said eternal glory for the winner. If Harry managed to win… then, wouldn’t that be impressive, Draco?”
“See? I’d be an idiot to say no to her.”
“Well, we visited Hagrid’s. He was so distraught to hear about Lucius Malfoy’s complaint against Buckbeak--but we don’t blame you, of course!” She tacked on hastily.
“Ah! Draco!” Gabrielle grinned. Draco had the decency give a returning smile.
Malfoy breezed past him.
“I didn’t think you’d want to hear from me.”
They reached to the staircase and Ron went over the plan to meet up. “Me and Hermione will meet you and your mates outside and we’ll all go down to Hogsmeade together.”
Draco screamed and turned back around to escape the obstacle course. He stumbled out shaking and crying. He collapsed to the ground, feeling everything hurt.
me, Anthony. I’m so scared about letting myself jump into this without knowing how it goes.” Draco felt himself wanting to laugh. “Because I don’t want it to end badly because all I’ve seen are bad endings. I don't want to give Harry a bad ending. So, please, tell me, Anthony, what to do because I don’t. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired of bad endings.”
Draco smiled. "Of course, sir."
That made Draco’s train of thought tilt. “You’re…?”
Terry and Draco had a good time with Draco laughing at Terry’s outrageous dancing and screeching of the band members’ names between sets. Anthony and Luna briefly joined them but they disappeared off back into the crowd. Neither Ron nor Hermione approached them but Draco found it strange that Harry didn’t try to find them.
Draco knows for a fact that none of his family wasn’t under any type of curse during the war. He dug his fingers into his left forearm.
“Dobby!" He laid a hand on his abruptly spiked chest. "Do not scare me like that!”
“Professor,” Draco returned, not thinking of what else to say.
“I guess you can say that,” Draco answered.
"When I was leaving, I noticed a black egg in the fire. Anyone with common sense could figure it out." The lie came smoothly enough.
sorry that this is terribly late, but with that aside, I never mentioned these works on here and I wanted to make sure everyone knew about them!
“How? He’s all over the papers! You know, mass murderer, known criminal in both the wizarding
“What are they—I’ll handle this, tell the others I’ll be there in a minute.” He left a confused Terry and gave Crabbe and Goyle a vague nod of his head to follow him.
“Who’s he?” Harry asked.
Hermione nodded and attempted to search for another topic. "Oh, Ron and I was chosen as prefects!" she said a touch too loudly.
.” Lucius rasped so low that Draco thought it was something that he wasn’t supposed to hear.
“You’ve been acting strange since the beginning of this year. I find you sleeping at the common room’s tables more than your actual bed. And when you are in bed, you're writing in that stupid ‘journal’ of yours—yes, I’ve noticed. Light sleeper remember?—And every day I see you get paler. Mate, you’re just straight up not yourself.”
A black dog jumped out from the darkness, baring its teeth as he bounded forward towards Draco. Biting into Draco’s jumper, the grim pulled him towards the Whomping Willow. Draco thrashed as best as could, but every twist brought a surge of agony. Dark orange blurred passed them and Draco shouted in surprise as Crookshanks eyed him from his stance on a tree knot before being pulled a hole at the base of the Whomping Willow.
“Yeah, yeah, I'm..." Harry waved an arm around. "You know Hermione’s way too wrapped up in her own workload to help me. I really could use the distraction from Black and all that.”
“Hey, what happened down there?” Anthony asked gently, sounding closer.
he warned himself.
“Professor Lupin requested a potion from me. I was only delivering it to his office.” Snape droned. Harry blanched at the explanation and Snape’s eyebrow twitched at the reaction. “It’s so interesting...” Snape continued, no shift in his tone to show actual interest. “Professor Lupin and I were discussing the both of you in his office.”
"Don't freak out! It's just an invisibility cloak." He pulled it off and Draco could see a head attached to a body again. Breathing through his nose, he calmed down.
“They’re all in the common room talking about what happened.”
“Yeah, okay.” Harry breathed in deeply. "Okay."
"You spoke wisely." Then the door opened to reveal a blue and bronze common room.
“This is the Weasleys',” Harry said, gesturing to a modest tent.
