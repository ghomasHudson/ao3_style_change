"Which ex is he talking about?" asked Benjamin, clearly interested, as he leaned comfortably against the sofa - he was sitting on the floor in front of it.
Harry found him vomiting, kneeling with his head in the toilet. He crouched down beside him, but did not touch him. When the vomiting passed, Draco remained with his head by the toilet, unsure. The world was spinning. Thank Merlin his wound was now healed enough that the vomiting didn't feel like an acid burn in his throat. "I didn't think seeing her would do that to me. I'm... I'm terrified."
"You two never told me how you met," Harry said innocently as Krzyszek made tea and Draco looked curiously through all the cupboards - a sure sign that the Dragonologist was an ex of his, he watched him do so with amusement and indifference, knowing in advance that there was no point in trying to get between Draco Malfoy and the object of his curiosity. There was even a little affection in his eyes. Harry wondered if he ever regretted his time with Draco. Harry felt for all of Draco's exes, honestly. He found it hard to imagine how anyone got over a break-up with him, especially when they continued to be friendly with him - Draco did everything he could to keep a good relationship with the men he had been with.
As with all barbaric rituals, families were expected to attend. Draco knew this, because many of his staff would be absent that day to attend - it was practically a holiday in wizarding London. But Harry didn't tell Draco about it. Honestly, it hurt him a little, but he feigned ignorance. He kissed Harry that morning like he did every other morning, and he and Salem watched him get on his bike through the kitchen window.
Draco had no idea what he was doing. After Jules, he was pretty sure he'd sworn to himself not to try again, and almost certain he'd sworn to his son that he'd be his only priority. And now he was obsessing over a wizard again. And what a wizard. Draco often told himself that he was only 26, that he was only a child, really, that his hormones, his naive feelings still had a hold on him because of his young age. If he could have had crushes in his teens, a few gradual romances early in his life, maybe he would be more balanced. Less romantic. That he wouldn't have a tendency to throw himself into the void right away. But Draco was as desperate for tenderness, for love, for happiness, as a thirsty man was for water. And his heart and his damn cock were fighting very, very hard with his brain.
Harry made them invisible to others, wrapped them in protection from birds, mosquitoes, cold, wet, falling, and Draco felt a bit like when his mother wrapped him in a cloak, scarf, and beanie before going out in winter. Harry's magic hummed against his skin, warm and soft.
Draco and Harry sat down in the Main Hall, on a comfortable leather chair right in front of the stage. Draco cuddled up to Harry sideways, so that they could look at each other, but Harry also had a good view of the bruises forming on his exposed back. A Shibari performance was beginning. Harry placed a dome of privacy around them and whispered in Draco's ear, "That's the first thing I've seen you do, with Callum. Shibari."
Harry frowned in incomprehension. Lucius dropped the report he was reading and seemed to remember his black tea left on the corner of the desk. He restored its warmth with an elegant flick of his wand and drank as he watched Harry, his raised eyebrows expressing perfectly what he thought of his intelligence.
Harry is blitzing something loudly in a food processor when Draco marks and closes his book and pads into the kitchen. He startles when he sees him approach, then sighs in quick and already disappearing vexation before turning and tipping the sauce back into a pan on the hob.
He gulps. “Sure, yeah,” he says weakly. “I just… er—sometimes, well, I think it’s common to be uncomfortable about someone being gay... but if you’re… so long as you try—”
“Erm…” He’s busy washing his hands? He’s busy being out with his friends? Or does he mean tomorrow? This week, maybe? “Can you be more specific?”
I’m not ready, Draco finds himself thinking in a panic, watching the man opposite smile over at him, deep in a story about two Christmases ago. I was just learning how to be a friend. It’s too soon. I’m not ready for this.
He clears his throat. “Er, since Emilia,” he admits with an air of disingenuous nonchalance, turning and busying himself by clearing the table to eat. Harry says nothing more while he clears the papers and stacks the evidence and the Ministry form for Harry by the door, but the second he’s in sight again, he’s being interrogated again.
Ron looks back at Hermione and they say nothing but nod meaningfully and she leaves again. Harry can think of nothing to do but continue holding Draco’s head while Ron begins to mutter a very long spell, his wand drawn and tracing up Draco’s arm to the shoulder, where the blackness is spreading.
Ron does return soon after, with food that Harry barely touches but nonetheless appreciates. And once the news arrives that Hermione reversed the curse in time, that Draco will be okay, it seems that the Ministry thinks it’s acceptable to send an Auror or two. Lucrezia comes with Marinella to ask him questions in an empty room, which mostly consist of answering “I don’t know” repeatedly and trying futilely to avoid the implications in Draco as the victim in his bathroom. He’s a bit embarrassed to look as haggard as he does in front of Aurors he actually respects.
program, Blaise Zabini! I was doing my job. You went on three dates and stood her up on the fourth! Who stands someone up on a fourth date?!”
“I realised maybe you thought—when I went upstairs I wasn’t walking away, just going where the paperwork happened to be. I’d hate if you thought I was. Walking away.”
. Malfoy nods and disappears into the row, so Harry follows quickly on his heels. From where they stand, he sees nothing of the commotion but a pair of leather shoes abnormally high above the books.
has no dedication page at all—the first thing Harry flips to find. There’s no preface, either, but it seems Draco doesn’t need it. This is his second publication, in 2004, and in the opening to the first chapter, Harry sees the first instances of the personable delivery that Hermione was praising at dinner.
By the bookshelf and an old trunk, he comes across a few objects that barely cross his consciousness—as malevolent as something he’d find at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but vexing nonetheless.
When they reach Kanpai, Ron and Hermione have beaten them. It’s a cramped but friendly space, with a long booth running the length of one side of the restaurant as half the seating for that wall of tables, and he sees his friends sitting close on the pillowed bench opposite a couple of chairs near the back. There’s a blackboard menu covering the opposite wall above a counter for ordering, and the restaurant is so busy and thin that Harry says “excuse me” no less than five times while reaching their table.
He follows Draco out of the store like a puppy and pays for dinner in a continual apology for the mess he made at Kanpai, despite his friend’s protests. There’s a single reporter outside Draco’s building and she looks incredibly excited to see them. Draco sighs beside him and he fights the urge to apologise again, for existing, maybe—sweeping through Diagon Alley during rush hour in his black Auror robes was an invitation for the press.
Sitting across from Draco in the Four Johns, Harry had made a point to describe his life as on-hold until he met him again, but when they finally got together, he’d simply exchanged one life for another. With strange post-fight clarity, he finally notices that he hasn’t been to the gym since things got serious between them, that he’s losing grip on his friendships, has been unfocused on his case… He’d been meant to add Draco into what he already had, not sacrifice it.
So he braces himself, when his plate is dropped in the sink (Harry insists always on hand-washing), to turn around and be confronted by what might as well feel like nakedness compared to his usual wardrobe. Harry does look him over. He watches green saucers trace slowly down his body and deliberately doesn’t throw his arms behind his back like he wants.
Draco clears his throat and shifts, desiring nothing more than to steer the conversation back from the embarrassingly human and sympathetic choices he’d had to make this week. “How do you manage all the publicity, then?” he asks, willing himself to relax.
“That whole ‘Not Thing’ with that guy last week… it went tits up,” Harry says, hoping to affect a casualness, a disinterest that doesn’t betray how surprisingly distracted it’s left him.
“And I you,” Draco says. He reaches out to mess with the buttons on the sherwani. “You should really take this off, though.”
In the phone booth, he holds back a smile at Draco’s appalled look, watching him pin the Ministry guest badge to his coat for him, but the somberness returns when they open into the bustling main Ministry hall. Draco’s chin rises higher, and only Harry from so close beside him can see the last deep breath he draws in and out through his nose. His stare is stony, eyes steadfastly set on the lift, and only once the doors of the lift close and leave them unaccompanied does his chest cave again.
And he looked so beautifully earnest, his eyes so green and so wide and so heartfelt, and there was that voice again going
Harry’s gaze bounces from place to place. Finally, it lands on him with a heaving sigh. Draco feels like he’s come off the adrenaline of a near-death experience. “Alright.”
He apparates home in a daze that afternoon, feeling powerless, and when Pansy and Blaise come by he’s too focused on the task at hand to recognise the circumstance as the first time they’ve been in his home.
He could be Draco’s research. His trials and his experiment and his proof that they work and they fit well together, body and mind.
“At least the Muggle hospitals have a telly hung up, right?” he muses. “We could pretend to care about that instead of these blank walls.”
it, but I was in so deep and I couldn’t hear myself think that year—I had no thoughts but ‘survive’. I’ve… worked on that—for almost a decade. I was wrong about so much. Horrifically, embarrassingly wrong. It haunts me, that I thought that way, but I think I deserve to be haunted? You know? And I think
He has Draco’s full attention, wonderfully attentive, face unreadable still. Harry wills himself to find his words better than the rambling he’s doing.
He leaves Harry’s side to take a seat in a chair by the fireplace and stare amusedly at the large Black family tree tapestry. If he’s getting that comfortable, Harry’s confident that he has a lot of cursed objects to get through before they move rooms. He focuses again, to hear a single voice.
Draco, he thinks: casual gambler, Hogwarts visitor, close friend of Luna Lovegood. He’d been running on the high of their afternoons in the study, how easily Draco let him into his home and a burgeoning friendship, but in all their study break musings, he’d never once mentioned Hogwarts or Luna.
Draco looks to him thankfully, finding home in his familiar expression and a topic he can handle. “Yes, he bought books in India. Plural. On purpose.”
“Might be,” Draco concedes. “But not in regards to that. Right now, the less associated with wizarding London, the better.”
on commercial but Georgia is getting ready for her nephew’s intramural Quidditch game with the program
“’Famous, not-so-tall but definitely dark and handsome Harry Potter? The only way he’s not tied down is if he’s a bachelor by choice…’ That’s the word in the break room anyway.”
He remembers sweeping Ginny into a waltz, turning to see Blaise and Ron doing the same while Harry and Pansy cackled like a couple of stumbling fools. He remembers dancing hot and close to Harry, remembers laying on the grass with Blaise and Hermione drunkenly discussing Wizarding Europe’s inefficiency at decolonising History of Magic education, remembers Pansy and Luna hiking up their dresses and racing across the grounds, remembers Luna reading his palm.
“No, you and my owl. Yes you and me. And no talk about the case, I promise.” Draco winces a little at this in memory. “Just ‘being civil’ and getting to know each other again, yeah?”
Harry’s on his stomach on the rug, surrounded by books, Rose’s toys, and Rose, who he’s occupying while Hermione gets work done at the table. He sends a note off to Draco with their owl:
“Good. I love you, owl if you need anything,” she says, then pulls back and with one more look towards him, stern as if to enforce that he heeds her direction, she leaves with Blaise.
“Then, alright. We’ll work on it,” he says. Harry watches his eyes light with excitement for just a moment before they narrow again, as if he’s just remembered he’s angry. “Not now, though. I’m too fucking… agitated. You need to be
Until now, this had gone unmentioned. The rest of the Black family was a sore subject for Narcissa, and he didn’t want to offend by leaving the property while she was expecting his help, but if she was proposing it too, it would be a rather helpful trip to make.
Harry holds his gaze firmly, then gives him a lopsided smile and pulls at him again. It’s all enough of a rousing interaction to stir something in him no matter the partner, but it’s
“I... thought we were friends!” he says evenly, frowning, trying to look emotional. “Years together, and you have the nerve to try and curse me dead within the Ministry?”
He gestures to the box, on the same shelf as the movies. Ron follows his gaze and stares for a long while. Then, he summons it and sets it right on top of Draco’s papers.
He can feel himself get angry and anxious all over again when he relays the accident with the skull. He can feel himself get washed in concerned affection when describing Harry showing up at his door drunk and sleeping in his bed, then pulling him into Christmas shopping in September. He realises, as he mentions his sudden acknowledgement of attraction that same morning, what telling Blaise everything is going to entail.
“There,” he says, sitting back down. “Maybe a little literature will help you describe traces better, too.”
“Thank you!” Draco looks more relaxed than Harry left him, leaning back comfortably in his chair, and he glances at Harry with a quick grin as he sits down. “I argued with Marta—my editor—for ages before she let me write in the first person. I think it makes it much more conversational.”
Ron leans over Draco and feels his pulse, something else Harry should’ve done already, then says his name a few times. He slaps his cheek, too, and Draco’s pupils shift, not focused on Ron but in another direction past him.
“—and I should’ve known no man could forgive me for years of awfulness, but I thought it was just so kind of him to get me into international waters…”
“We need to go. We woke Molly up just to leave her with Rosie in the middle of the night, and she’s in a state about
There, he sees a broom. It’s not a common mode of transportation here, but Harry knows there’s an Indian international team, street games, hobbyists. His fingers trace the soft wood grain and the golden Hindi script where the wood meets the tail bristles. It’s Indian rosewood, sturdy, smooth.
“Me neither,” she muses, shaking her head. He doesn’t ask if she’s received offers, too; he’d always just assumed as much.
Draco looks at the extended hand, seeming still a bit dazed, and purposefully ignores it without a word. He stands on his own and checks himself over, and when he raises his head to meet Harry’s eyes again, there’s a flicker of something jumpy.
There’s a photo, too, of a much younger Lucrezia—the only photo that still features her husband, albeit much younger himself—where they stand next to her mother and father, who looks out proudly with a penetrating stare in his own Ministry robes. Broderick, Harry remembers, another casualty of the war. Lucrezia has always been one of the few Aurors who took Harry’s war experiences seriously as anything other than a blanket triumph, and when he’d first entered the field, she’d checked on him and Ron often.
“Hermione had gotten ten pages into her research notes on the case before we got the Patronus,” Ron says, sitting in a chair across from Harry’s position on the edge of the bed. “I think she’s disappointed.”
“Draco said tomorrow, too, he told me it was a bad idea to jump into things tonight, but look where that’s gotten us! I don’t know how I’m supposed to-to just…
It’s charming, he thinks. There’s never been a better opportunity for the word. The church Harry passes was built in the 13th century, many of the buildings within a few centuries later, and the approach of Halloween had encouraged many shop owners to decorate the windows and entranceways with Jack-o-lanterns, autumn leaves, black cats, and hay bales. Posters for an All Hallow’s Eve festival are posted every few meters.
Draco gestures with his almost empty tea and a half-smile, but when he sees the look on Harry’s face he lowers it with sincerity. He reaches a dripping wet hand out of the tub.
“You know, Pans,” says Blaise. “I consider myself to have an especially contentious job and you make me feel like a tedious bookkeeper with your tales.”
“And I’d take you for a sickle, but Hermione looks like she’s going to explode if I don’t fill you in on the gala,” he says. They’d all been patient enough during dinner, skating around the topic to talk about Rose and Teddy and the Weasley’s. “It’s good, too.”
Draco doesn’t remember the last time he’d felt this much on the precipice of losing something important, but he feels as though they’ve toed the line of this relationship just often enough that he could give it the final push into futility, so he can’t help but feel his pulse rising quickly, a slight panic setting in.
“Agreed.” Harry pushes a knee between his legs and he gasps. He’s growing quickly hot, impatient, aroused. “I didn’t know how incomprehensible it would feel. Not to have you in my life.”
He’s grinning at Harry so genuinely that he can’t help but watch the last of his frustration leave his body. He knocks his elbow against Jack amicably. “Rest of your weekend, then?”
Draco slides into his coat elegantly, in one fluid motion of long, flowing lines, and it settles onto his shoulders effortlessly. His hands reach up gracefully to flip the collar out and then run through his hair, as if to purposefully test Harry’s restraint when the locks by his temple fall forward from behind his ears. Perhaps on a less eventful day, he’d have the wherewithal to question why his first instinct is to fit them back in place.
Harry’s never been one to fill silences or work overtime to support small talk, but this evening and the nerves that have been building since Draco agreed to the meal have pushed him in a regulatory direction. He once again becomes a crutch to the conversation.
right underneath. The edge is rough and fuzzy where it’s been torn from an edition, and there’s a page number, thirty-five, in the top left corner. Besides, this, it is empty except for the prose below the title:
Something happens on the television, a nonverbal farce maybe, and he hears Harry laugh lightly in response above him as his fingers comb through. As though it’s just another evening and his hand in Draco’s hair is a regular addendum. Slowly, Harry’s hand adds pressure, and when at one point he grazes down gently with his fingernails, Draco sighs audibly. He swears he can hear Harry smile.
Oddly, the work on the pages is pleasantly familiar to Harry, reminiscent of the kind of symbols and formulas he would look over and see when they worked in quiet companionship in Draco’s study. Occasionally, there’s a full two-page spread of Draco’s original handwritten notes and arithmancy for a spell. He feels an almost-affection for the recognisably loopy penmanship, shorter and more cramped in scrawling notes than it appears in Draco’s letters.
He tips the omelette onto a plate and takes a seat at his small table, summoning the files from his Ministry office. A stack of manila folders falls with a slap onto the table—he’d pictured his entire inbox, hoping the gala curse had already been added to his itinerary—and sure enough, it sits on top. He pages through with his free hand as he eats.
He pulls the hoodie over his head, revealing a Manticore Fight Store tee, and when Harry catches his expression again, it’s firmly decided. He knows a lost cause when he sees one.
Harry watches his face when he says this as though it’s a life-changing announcement. He pieces through the information on hand, trying to affect the proper reaction.
Hermione meets his eye with an apologetic glance that he’s sure will be the first of many. His throat dries, trying not to get overwhelmed by the length of the evening ahead.
“Erm. General locking charms… individually-added floo network… I have a deadbolt. The windows lock.”
He reaches for a blank sheet of paper and scrawls quickly, muttering as he goes. “Auror registered wands… I’ll have to find it myself so the Junior Aurors don’t see… Previous evidence re-examined… Are you worried?” he asks suddenly, meeting Draco’s eyes seriously. He poses the question with professionalism, checking Draco’s comfort levels.
Draco leans in the doorway with his hands in the pockets of his trousers. Harry wonders if he’s always looked so suave, so naturally charming, under that turned-up nose all those years. His ankles are crossed, the tip of his non-weight bearing shoe balancing lightly against the wooden floor.
Draco doesn’t say anything for a moment, and in the tense silence Harry trains his eyes on the papers. “Okay,” he says softly, eventually. “You’ve had an arduous evening.”
“Yeah,” Draco says. “You should get some sleep. I’ll see you Tuesday? I’ve just about got this counter-curse figured out, I think. Would be a shame for you to miss it.”
They stand in comfortable silence while Harry turns the chicken and adds the onion, a hand on his hip with the patience of a watchful cook. He doesn’t look up from the pan when he says, “So you and Pansy…”
Ron looks excitedly at Hermione, who seems a tad more hesitant to abandon her friend. She glances between them.
Harry quirks an eyebrow, recognising that his generally polished friend doesn’t tend to advertise himself otherwise. He turns back to Ron.
“The Chosen One, apparently,” he responds with mock arrogance, jutting out his chin and adding a low bow towards the fire. When he returns to the task of tying his tie, he tuts in judgement. “Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sitting in the audience, but I’m the one restoring peace.”
“I didn’t think I’d see you until the afternoon,” Draco breathes, looking flustered. He buttons the second-highest button on his shirt as he stands in the doorway. Harry sees his eyes drop to the evidence.
Harry recounts the whole tale, including Murray’s less-than-ethical attempt to get him to look the other way for a few days with Malfoy in custody while they began tackling leads. Hermione is shocked, while Ron looks as unsurprised as Harry had felt.
He was certain he’d successfully internalised it until Orsix arrived with an early morning schedule change for a department meeting and got stuck listening to his drama as he cooked a quick breakfast. Clearly it’s still more on his mind than he’d care to admit.
“It’s not you—I mean, you are proper distracting.” His eyes trace Harry’s bare chest. “But it’s also this flat and those uncomfortable dining room chairs and everything. Just final edit annoyances. Cabin fever. I get it every time.”
Harry agreed, impressed by the offer, and they wasted half an hour drinking tea and talking. This, too, became routine.
When Draco wakes up tucked warmly into Harry’s bed, he’s alone. This in itself isn’t jaw-dropping, but the speed with which he notices the absence of another is quite telling of how quickly he’s grown to expect Harry near him in his waking
He folds the jeans on the dresser and crawls up the bed on his knees to rejoin Draco, who reaches up to touch the black knit as though trying to place it.
He hands the treat back to Draco without looking, as if handing a purse to his spouse, focusing courteously on the wizard. In fact, every interaction is accepted with grace and charm, and with a perfect response to every comment. Harry does all of it with a smile, and Draco is pleased to already be able to differentiate it from the one he often receives—
When Draco completes the evidence two days later, he owls Harry immediately. Urgently. The response is short.
“Similarly, it is exceptionally difficult to involve charms and curses in the same object. The witch or wizard would need to be an advanced spell caster, capable of casting both highly intentional Light and Dark magic. Do you see where I’m going?” he prompts, ever the teacher.
He has no clue what he would do if he reached the action. All he knows is that disappearing behind the stage curtains very much feels like the wrong answer. The muscled men don’t lessen their hold though, as they haul him off the platform.
With his spectacular luck, Orsix returns with a response while Murray and five of Harry’s colleagues have crowded in his office to discuss a new policy for stakeouts, and he has to unfold a piece of parchment that only says
“Oh! Er, I am, actually. Gay.” Harry expertly fails to comprehend Jack’s last sentence, too focused on a quickly-growing regret for reacting so insistently and dramatically to a friend who knows nothing about him and Draco and is just trying to help. Jack let him vent and he’s just laughed in the face of his advice. “You’re not wrong. I’m sorry. Just… not him.
Draco squeezes his leg. “Ah, you know, he saves a lot of trouble and time by forcing me to use advanced charms to clean faster.”
Hermione follows them. The ribbon has fallen from her hair and she twists and wraps it restlessly around her hands.
He lifts his head. Her eyes are soft, and for the first time, he notices the messiness of her own attire, the red under her own fingernails. She’s dressed for the office, her hair pulled back into a quick top knot. Whatever there is worth saying, she’s more than earned it. With a sigh, she turns to face him directly and places her hands on his upper arms with a firm grip.
I'm not completely evil—how're we supposed to get to the love story if we don't spend time in the like story?
“Erm, hi,” Draco says, sounding surprised, and when Harry drops the weight of his head onto his shoulder instead of responding, he takes his arms from behind his back and slowly returns the embrace. “Are you alright?” he asks softly.
Draco rolls his eyes, throws his arm around Harry and kisses him on the cheek. “See? If it’s been three months, then it’s a
Draco raises delicate fingers too and removes his glasses, folds them, and sets them by the sink, then runs a hand gently around the back of his head.
Draco hums in contemplation from the doorway. “For old wizarding families it’s almost coveted to have cursed heirlooms. Impressive, even.”
With a smirk and only once the dew has sufficiently seeped into his back too, Draco lets him go, standing and holding out a hand. Harry takes it and doesn’t release it until they’re almost into town. He stops just outside the bookstore to pick a leaf out of Draco’s hair before they push open the door.
Draco regards him with fascination, then slowly his face creeps up and he lowers himself onto the scarf. Harry sits next to him, facing the water. The wildlife is stirring, and they watch the first boat paddle out onto the water below, breaking the still of sunup. He spares a glance to his left, at beautiful features faced out onto soft light, then lets his thoughts stray, and when he chuckles to himself, Draco turns his head.
Still, the nervous excitement of a new chapter in his life can’t quite soften the strange blow he’s feeling today, at the idea of losing the bright spot his best friend offered at a job he’s increasingly growing to resent.
Harry laughs, so genuine that it startles Draco, and then he turns and locks eyes with him again. The smile falls a little, from a full grin to something shrewder, his eyes sparkling darkly, and Draco’s hit again with a twisting feeling that he’s out of the loop.
on the list,” Pansy speaks up, smiling beautifully and rubbing his back. “If it’s the last thing I do. He’s put loads of work in.”
,” he recites, focusing on maintaining clear sight and annunciation. Curse-breaking spells were volatile, a single stumble capable of escalating instead of mollifying. “
She gives him that look—the one Jack had given—and it sticks with him as he’s leaving, still when he gets home, and as he looks at himself closely in the mirror while the shower heats, tracing and pulling at his skin with his fingertips.
He doesn’t, but he does smile down at the floor. It’s like an apology, from the flat to himself, for a morning of feeling overthrown.
He pours two cups, listening with a chuckle to the soft sounds of Potter talking to Dante, followed by a louder “Rude, not so much as a goodbye!” and the quick blur of black fur that runs past the kitchen towards his bedroom. He adds the teabags in silence, and is still standing frozen, trying to decide whether Potter is a milk and sugar person without debasing himself by asking when he hears the cry. It’s a sort of strangled gasp of surprise, followed instantly by a loud thump that sends Draco into unease.
Orsix hoots then flaps out the open kitchen window. Brilliant. Even his owl is sick of the Malfoy talk.
They stop back by the house and leave the brooms in the shed, and then, because Harry doesn’t have a usual hairdresser, find a place Ron had mentioned once over a year ago. There’s a single hairdresser open for walk-ins, and Harry spends maybe thirty minutes in the chair before he’s paying and out the door. He hadn’t asked for much—a bit shorter in the back, up to the line of his ears, leaving his curls trimmed but ever-present in a mop across the crown of his head and still hanging into his eye line. He reckons there’s no point in attempting to tidy what will be inexplicably messy by tomorrow.
It’s a cheap shot, but Murray at least succeeds in sending Harry into his thoughts—ones of Malfoy sneering and scowling and saying any horrid thing he can about anyone Harry loves, among the lesser of his evils.
“Sure,” Draco busies himself with a hand that drifts through Harry’s curls as though he himself is perfectly composed.
He disapparates on the spot, leaving Harry alone in astonishment on his doorstep, a hand tracing the pockmarked contours of a carved duck.
“Might I remind you, ‘Oh god, I didn’t mean that. I really didn’t mean that. That was a huge mistake,’” Harry recites emotionlessly, matter-of-factly.
He watches Harry attempt to shove an object that must be his present—it was Disillusioned, so to him it just looks like something he’s forgotten the moment he looks away—into a smaller bag and resists the overbearing urge to remind him of Engorgement charms.
Malfoy, meanwhile, has turned his attention to the wife and is labouring to steal her attention away from her husband. He speaks sternly, yet softly.
Hermione’s nodding profusely and as she leans forward to reassure him, Rose, brought along for the ride, fully extends her arms towards him. He reaches back and hefts her into his lap.
Harry frowns. “Well next time ask me explicitly what I think instead of just trying to read my actions.”
“Wow,” Harry pants, collapsing beside him. He leans over and plants a lazy kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Today ended much better than expected.”
Abruptly, Draco stops with his hands clasped, turning to Harry with that same disconcerting excitement he’d had waiting on the stoop yesterday. “It’s not family-owned anymore, but it’s the same structure, same business.”
“You might be aware that it is rather difficult for Dark wizards to perform the Patronus charm. Severus Snape is an impressive exception to the rule, one of few who overcome the challenge. Once one is gifted enough at Dark Arts, the lightest of spells become especially problematic…”
Neither woman looks displeased by this, and Harry gives Ron a covertly pointed look. He nods musingly.
“Didn’t I tell you? Suspicious. A Death Eater on the job. Despicable,” he spits. “Your infiltration on this case will plague me as a Head Auror, but it’ll haunt you in Azkaban. That’ll be quite a family reunion, won’t it?”
“Welcome, Harry, do come in…” Draco repeats quietly behind him, bewildered, but he closes the door without protest.
“It feels like a breeze. Or like… chewing really minty gum.” He opens his eyes and pulls his hand back, looking apologetic.
He leaves Draco’s side, presumably for his wand, and in his absence, he sits down on the floor and leans against the sofa. Vaguely, he registers the television is on. It’s black and white. The voices are reedy. When he closes his eyes, he can focus enough to hear them.
"There's no school today, sweetheart," Draco protested, turning to face him. He was nestled between them in the middle, looking very proud of himself. Draco pulled the duvet over him and kissed his forehead.
Scorpius was 90% the spitting image of Draco. But now that he thought about it, Harry could see a bit of Jules in him. Scorpius was a little less sharp, a little softer than the Malfoy. A little more handsome. His sparkling smile, the glow in his eyes, his skin, his hair. Jules had Veela blood. Scorpius had inherited it, no doubt. But not so much that Jules or anyone else would suspect that Scorpius was his offspring.
He waited for Scorpius' afternoon nap. He waited until Draco had eaten, and drank tea, and hung up from his usual Saturday call with Callum where they planned out the evening a bit. The Saturday evenings had resumed, with great regularity. Always Bound Gods, now that Thomas was in the know. It was by far the best club in town, and every week, as Saturday approached, Harry found himself getting goosebumps of anticipation regularly.
Harry spotted blonde hair. It had been happening to him a lot this past month. But his heart stopped for a moment when he realised that for once, he wasn't wrong. It was Draco Malfoy.
Their two twisted and brilliant brains came to the conclusion that tying Draco to a sex swing was a good end to the evening. Draco instinctively fell to his knees, looked down and thanked them warmly, his obliging voice making them grunt with desire. Draco watched as Potter effortlessly transfigured a plaid into a perfectly respectable, black sex swing that magically attached itself to the ceiling. Draco was manhandled onto the swing on his back. His head fell back, unsupported, offering his throat for penetration. His arms were bound in front of him, and his legs spread and suspended to best present his pink little hole to his masters.
He thought of something else, at some point, in the infinite time, in the windowless space, without movement, without change. He realised that he had never said "I love you" to Draco.
"Because of the Potter-Malfoys, of course," Selwyn said with a derisive gasp. "You're a brand name now, apparently. Just the right amount of Pureblood, just the right amount of Muggle love. You're..."
"I really tried to catch you, though," Harry said in a humorous tone to hide the seriousness of his words. "I was going crazy about you. I used to talk to Ron and Hermione about you all the time. I was stalking you on my magical map."
Then Harry put down his whip, wrapped his arms around Draco from behind, touching the wounds and making his husband tremble. "It's over," Harry whispered into his ear, licking it, breathing on the tender skin. "You gave me so much pleasure. You were perfect, my beautiful slave. You're stunning. I'll show you the memory, back home. The memory of what you look like right now, covered in my marks."
His wand fell from his hand under the shock to his whole body. He held onto the wooden furniture with his other hand, softening his inexorable fall a little, or at least preventing his skull from cracking on the stone slabs.
"Don't tell me," sighed Harry. "If I know, I will have to launch an investigation. And I'm not sure how Draco would react to me being the one to put his father in Azkaban after all. It certainly wouldn't help me be tolerated by Narcissa."
"If you're the type to stay for breakfast, I managed to find the one hotel that does the best brunches in this entire city."
"Should Draco pass away, he would like you to oversee the adoption of Scorpius by a Muggle family that you feel will raise him in a loving and fulfilling manner."
Like every Saturday, Ginny had come to her parents' house for lunch. They would eat well, Albus would play with the cousins who would be there that weekend, and when Euan didn't have Quidditch practice and came with them, he would disappear into the garage with Gin's father to talk flying cars and Circe-knows-what.
Callum kissed his hair and took the collar off. "Thank you for letting me be. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the world that you trust and who knows you at all. That's flattering, but it's not what I want for you."
Draco pinched the skin on his wrist with his other hand. After a moment, he asked with uncertainty, "I've been meaning to ask you something for a while."
Harry Apparated in the garbage shed on his street. Not very glamorous, but it was the nearest possibility.
"Too late. The wedding is settled, then," summed up Pansy, conspiratorial and ecstatic. "My lobbying work can move on to the second child."
With each thrust, his hips rubbed against the sheets, and with each thrust, so did his cock. It wasn't like a hand or a mouth, but it helped Draco to obey his man's wishes and cum just by the repeated pressure of his magnificent prick on his prostate, in his ass, splitting him open. The violent contractions of his rim caused Harry to cum in turn with a scream.
? Harry Potter dead in my bloody study! You would single-handedly regress all the work I’ve done to escape my infamy. Absolutely the most idiotic move I’ve ever witnessed. I shouldn’t let you into my
“Just waiting for me at my home? Had you thought to try saying ‘Hey, Potter, wait up’ instead of pointing a wand?” Harry is tense, and it shows in his voice.
“Just because an experiment doesn’t succeed does not mean you’ve failed, Draco,” he begins. He’s shaking his head, looking very serious about Draco understanding and accepting this. “I won’t even get back into discussing all the reasons why testing an item’s success without remembering to feel for a trace of its remaining power first is dangerous. I’m sure a skull still holding a full-strength Cruciatus would feel rather powerful and whatever happened,” he looks at him over his glasses, dubious, “could have been avoided.”
along, McGonagall would have to practically shush us. I miss her… and Neville won’t gamble with me, not even just over where we get dinner.”
“I don’t know…” Harry surprises himself with uncertainty, despite having thoughts similar to Ron’s while standing in the holding room with the man in question. “I’d be pretty on edge if I saved a woman’s life and then got arrested for it because some wand-ready Aurors were judging me for my past.”
He’s immensely thankful for his friends; Ron, who’d taken on the disconcerting task of overseeing Marinella’s collection of the evidence in Harry’s shower, then filled a bag with everything Harry would need to spend a few nights away and gone to Draco’s for a change of clothes for him, too; Hermione, who sent owls off to everyone who needed one, brought him multiple coffees, and stays with him long after Ron needs to go to collect Rose from their neighbours.
Luna smiles politely, eyes darting between the exes. “Bit of a rocky start, but he muddled through. The ending was spectacular; I think he found himself. And I can see why you mentioned at breakfast about warning the Slytherin coach…”
He’s been caught out, he knows—his worry for Harry palpable. It leads him to wonder how successfully hidden the rest of his feelings are, and as they walk past the entrance to the temple towards a quiet side street, he works not to bother Harry with
“Oh, well. We had a meeting, department-wide,” he begins, sitting on the rug. “I was ready for a serious discussion.”
This is, possibly, the most idiotic and embarrassing part of the story, and he says it in a fast mumble under his breath, grimacing. “All those talks about accepting each other, he thought I was talking about his sexuality and I thought he was talking about my sexuality.”
He sets the bowl down, crouches, and uses his free hand to gently part Leonard’s lips, slipping the spoon in. He waits a moment, then removes it and steps back. They all watch with bated breath as the man first squeezes his eyes shut, then opens them with a noticeably more peaceful expression. Slowly, he begins to rotate. Virginia lets out a soft, sad laugh in relief behind them.
His shower is unnecessarily long and hot, and when he’s out he shaves and brushes his teeth and uses a terribly alcoholic mouthwash that leaves his tongue burned free of any taste more than three seconds old.
“Before you leave, what sort of warding already exists?” he asks, balancing the paper on his knee. Harry stands thoughtfully, looking strangely guilty with one arm through the robes.
Even now, he runs his hand along the familiar stone of the hallway leading to Charms and is unsurprised when Flitwick’s classroom is empty of all but him. He looks up, face lighting brightly with a smile when he sees who’s arrived. It flickers then into something resembling guilt, just for a flash, furthering Draco’s belief that a trip to Hogwarts would have been rather manageable and the professor had ulterior motives to get him to the reunion gala.
He stops by the gardening aisle and finds a new copy of the trouble-maker from that day. After a glance across the empty row of shelves, he closes his eyes, controls his breathing, and feels for the buzz of magic in his core, mentally expanding it outward. Of course, there’s no trace of a curse on the book. He hadn’t expected one, really.
He’s opening the door before Draco can contemplate the added confusion in his answer and gestures for him to enter, so he does, Potter right behind him.
He watches Harry waltz through the study towards the kitchen like he owns the place, a heavy tote bag in his hand. He calls loudly back across the flat, “Do you have a chicken cutting board?”
The evidence is delivered by a Junior Auror that afternoon, looking hesitantly at Draco as he hands over a small Pret bag too, mumbling something about “for you, from Auror Potter,” and when Draco reaches in, he finds an egg and spinach salad and a small bottle labelled ‘Ginger Shot’ that has his eyes watering just from cracking the lid and sniffing.
Hermione looks up from her papers and smiles. “Rosie, come over here for a minute,” she beckons, reaching down to sweep her daughter up into her lap when she toddles over. She tickles her face with the thin feather of a quill, and Harry can still hear the high-pitched laughter when his head is halfway in the hearth before the Weasley-Granger fireplace is replaced by a familiarly messy study.
“Okay. Okay, Harry.” Hermione dives after the books, running a shaking hand down the index of one. She tosses it aside and grabs the second—Harry recognises heart wrenchingly that it’s the curse diagnostics book he’d picked up in the Mayakara Bazaar—to do the same, and this time flips open to a page halfway through a book. “This might work,” she says, but doesn’t act. She continues reading the page, almost leisurely, though Harry knows this is his panic talking.
“See you around, Harry,” he says, and that’s clearly the cue to leave, so Harry reaches down for his bag and slings it over his shoulder.
He’d also swear that he wouldn’t waste his time worrying what Potter thought of him, and in the next breath find himself so stressed that he couldn’t find anything to show for his work that he’d stand jerkily from the chair to walk rooms away from the files and nibble on a cold croissant with some strong coffee.
“Y-you too,” Harry speaks from just behind his shoulder and he almost startles. He’s too jumpy. He hadn’t known Harry stood close. Pansy waves back too, a bit perplexed, and he watches Blaise lean in and speak quietly to her.
“I just can’t imagine what you two idiots thought was happening. This is the best thing I’ve ever heard, Draco. I’ve thought you were clever, but I’ve always known you were stupid.”
“Hiya, Harry,” Ginny says, her lips pressed thinly together. She’s changed out of her refereeing robes into jeans and a long sleeve. Her stare fixes him with a heart-striking fear he hasn’t felt since they were together.
“That’s not all,” Draco says darkly, sliding over a second paper, this time fully scribbled in his handwriting. It’s his personal notes, taken down quickly as he worked, but at the bottom he’s circled and underlined the results. “I haven’t added everything to the form yet, and I… don’t need to. If you follow.”
“Just go talk to her,” Blaise suggests once Pansy has spent the better part of an hour laughing loudly and flipping her hair when Luna seems like she might look this way. “You’re almost thirty.”
“Yes, erm, this Muggle woman, Manisha Johanne, she has a muggleborn niece. It would be unethical to wipe her memory. It’s vital that you check family records for every single witness.”
Draco’s eyes have drifted closed in horizontal contentedness, so he sits up to meet Harry’s. He looks beautifully peaceful. Undone. His hand drifts, almost unconsciously, down the tan skin of his hip.
He huffs impatiently, wrapping his arms around Harry from behind. When he reaches forward and very tentatively kisses Harry’s temple, though mostly getting a mouthful of hair, he sighs contentedly and pauses his stirring to lean his head back for a moment onto the taller shoulder behind him. The reaction leaves Draco feeling validated in his analysis.
Mostly Harry and Draco were going to show Teddy the progress of their new house - but no one knew about it yet. Teddy was starting to get anxious about going to Hogwarts, according to Andromeda. Harry thought that if his godson knew that he could spend weekends with him from time to time, he would be less scared.
"Perfect. You are perfect. I've missed you so much." Harry breathed in the smell of his hair, traced the curves of his shoulder and arm. The bed was still cool, and Draco had goosebumps, seeking Harry's warmth. He slipped one of his hands under his pyjama top, playing with the hair on his chest with one finger.
Draco slowly got to his feet. His body weighed heavy. It wasn't strictly speaking his magic that was powering the building's protections, but like all powerful magic, they had to be anchored in a wizard, and that wizard was him, and no matter how much the highly skilled spellcasters who'd put together the top of the line magical protections explained it to him, at that moment, Draco still felt like it was his magic being siphoned off. A bit like a blood donation a little too fast where he could feel his dizziness and fatigue coming on.
"Untenable permanently. Look at you, the best wizard in the world, who dropped his after a few hours with me the first night we spent together. Even in potion form, I'd say that in daily use, the maximum would be five hours of effectiveness per day."
Harry thought he would join Draco, but Teddy demanded his attention, then Hermione, then Roxanne... And Draco didn't seem to need any help. He wasn't quite comfortable, very upright, but he smiled, and he spoke softly, and he already had the reflex to help toddlers who crossed his path crying or wanting something or having been bumped, without wasting time trying to figure out who the child belonged to. Draco was good with children. Harry wondered where he got it from. He was an only child, no cousins, no children around in his youth. He had shelves and shelves of books about raising a child in his library, though. Harry wondered how he'd done it, when Scorpius had been born, when Astoria had left. Had he spent her pregnancy reading everything he could find? Worrying that he was going to be a terrible father and that he knew nothing about babies? He shouldn't have. He was the best father ever. A natural. Gentle, funny, caring without being overprotective. Harry's heart was beating fast.
"Apart from the two cases I just mentioned, no. Our employees are careful and trained in these matters. The same precaution is required with suppliers, buyers, and Muggle clients. All the wizards employed by Sectumsempra are quite comfortable with Muggle instruments, their vocabulary, their way of life, so as not to be spotted."
What seemed like hours later to Harry, he peeled his cheek away from Draco's stomach and dared to look up into his face. Draco ran very gentle fingers through the dark hair. There were a few tears in his eyes and on his cheeks. "Why?" repeated Draco, in a tired but otherwise normal voice now. "How can you trust me after hearing that?"
Draco left the house. He returned about ten minutes later with a box that Harry recognized immediately. It was in the safe of the house without magic, in their bedroom's wall.
There was emotion, too. Draco had tears in his eyes when the candle-covered cakes were brought in and everyone sang for Scorpius, and he blew out the candles for his son, captivated on his lap. He had made a simple cake especially for the children, who happily ate it with their fingers, getting it absolutely everywhere.
Papa laughed. He crouched down in front of Scorpius and lifted his shirt a little to show his lower belly, which he touched with the tips of his fingers. "It takes a long time. First, the baby will be here, hidden, warm. It will grow, grow, grow, and when Papa has a big belly, the baby will come. But there is no baby in my tummy yet. It's just an idea. I wanted to talk to you about it before Harry and made the baby."
Harry was pacing in his office. After the Aurors had summoned the French authorities on the matter, his first instinct had been to call Lola, but his mobile had no signal in the Ministry of Magic. He had sent a short letter to Draco at Sectumsempra headquarters and anxiously hoped he would arrive soon.
"You'll have to let me babysit Scorpius every now and then," Blaise said quietly. "Pansy said she'd be willing to try for a new child only if I stayed clean for five years. Just eight months to go, now. I'm sure I'll make it. From the first day of rehab, even when I was puking my guts out and thinking I was going to die, I knew I wouldn't go back. There's too much at stake."
Harry wanted to be a good father. He didn't feel that he could match Draco on that score, but he wanted to do the right thing. Maybe it was strange, but he'd never really thought about how dangerous his job was before. Yes, he risked dying every day, but it was theoretical, remote, improbable. Now that he had a son, that he could call him his son, that others knew it was his son, Harry was invaded by new anxieties, diffuse but real. What if he died? Would Scorpius have any memory of him? Would he be angry with him for not coming home night after night? Then, almost without realising it, Harry became more attentive. Less of a hothead. Where he would have jumped into action before, he settled down, studied the building plans, the suspects' backgrounds first. Where he had never missed a difficult operation before, he sometimes stayed in the office, coordinating the various missions rather than jumping in. In short, he gave unprecedented importance to the preservation of his own life.
Their waiter arrives before Harry can be ridiculed further, presenting a wine list and taking drink orders, and when he comes back to pour it’s with an expensive cloth draped elegantly across his forearm and a perfect tilt of the glass, and all Draco can think about despite his best efforts is Harry, his jeans, and how sorely out of place he might be feeling.
He’s angry about being the Ministry’s puppet, only respected when PR finds it necessary. He’s angry at himself for caring about his job enough to not let all this affect his efforts.
you.” He grasps Harry by the jumper and kisses him firmly, passionately, hands pulling at the edge of his top as if its very presence is abominable and shimmying it over his head, jostling his glasses. He takes Harry’s wrist and pulls him quickly to the bedroom.
“I will be doing everything in my power not to trade a single word with anyone but our table and Flitwick tonight.”
“Merlin’s saggy—” Hermione elbows Ron before he can finish the thought, though she looks equally stunned.
,” he repeats. His head lowers and he speaks almost in a whisper, despite their solitude. “It’s laundry day. I had to wear my robes all the way here.”
Draco seems unwilling to fight him, so they move again. Ron’s already gone downstairs and Hermione’s just reached the stairs ahead of them when Draco says, “Wait,” louder and more urgently than before and Harry stops again quickly.
And now the wand type, too, was proving difficult. It was most of the reason for his sleepless nights—the length and quantity of brews required. Each brew needed to incorporate part of the material he was attempted to verify, which was a real thorn in his side for wand types; he’d called in every favour he’d earned for spare fragments of unicorn hairs and dragon heartstrings.
“Hm,” Pansy hummed thoughtfully. She turned to Blaise but her eyes lingered on Draco. “His style… very well-dressed.”
He can feel Draco’s eyes on him a couple of times after that, hears him clear his throat and shift his position once or twice. It’s endearingly awkward. When he clears his throat a third time, Harry’s surprised anything audible comes of it.
. There was something quaint, if not a bit alien, about Potter’s tendency towards muggle turns of phrase. Fitting, he thinks, taking in his surroundings and how hastily Potter had stowed his wand with a furtive glance around.
“They took the evidence,” Harry says. “I couldn’t stop that, but I made sure Ron went with them. It was just Lucrezia and Mari, but I’m not feeling too great about any Aurors alone in my flat for now.”
There are about fifteen minutes after Harry arrives back home where he has enough quick chores to keep the evening’s introspective turn in conversation off his mind, but soon enough the dishes are clean, Orsix is fed, he’s tidied the entire ground floor, and he’s lacing up his trainers again.
He gives in and glances back towards Jack. He’s still lifting, and seeing him so natural and relaxed at the gym simply because he hasn’t clocked Harry’s arrival feels terrible. It reminds him of how Jack had been before Harry sped towards something else he couldn’t maintain—smiley, bright, a leant ear and a good friend.
But despite his best efforts, Harry notices something off about him. His glances linger just a little too long when he looks up, and after a while he turns and sits up off his stomach, facing Draco with a tilted head. “Are you doing alright?”
Draco is painfully aware of how many eyes are watching him work this case, given the man he’s working it with. It certainly doesn’t diminish the pressure he’s put himself under to succeed significantly and quickly. He’s never worked an active case like this, so time-sensitive and important. Maybe Potter finds it to be just another day on the job, popular Auror that he is, but Draco’s never spent so many hours each day sweating bullets, paranoid that he’s going to publicly fuck up: the curse specialist ex-Death Eater who can’t even get Dark arts figured out.
“I’m going to go to the village, get stuff for dinner,” he tells Draco when he comes back downstairs. “Any requests?”
Harry looks up behind him and smiles instantly in greeting. He summons the other chair from the window, which Hermione falls into with perfect timing just as it settles next to him, like a trust fall. He reaches his hand out again and closes the door, shutting off any remaining noise from the party. She side-eyes his wandless magic, but just crosses her legs and leans back in the chair, smiling at Ron.
This isn't looking great. His heart is pounding. He could waste time regretting coming downstairs at all, but there’s no point when he’d never entertained leaving Draco down here alone. If it was going to end, it was going to end like this. At least he’s sent enough communication to Mari for Lucrezia to be found out—hardly a consolation prize to the dead.
Now, at least, that cold glower sits above flushed cheeks instead of the sallow eye bags he remembers. He’s still all sharp edges, cheekbones, pointed noise, even sharp eyes, but he seems filled out, healthy.
, the evidence won’t even have a good reason to leave the Ministry now, let alone come to your study. But… but you’re smart and-and knowledgeable and it’s undoubtedly linked to
“Ron!” Harry takes a couple of hard steps back, scowling at the men already moving in towards him again.
“I think our words, even if we believed them, didn’t have to be so harsh,” Draco counters. “Honesty without kindness is cruelty… or so they say.”
“Really?” His voice is raised in exuberance. “All my friends think it’s a bit ridiculous! Other than maybe Hermione. But she understands, it feels like a part of me that I lost when I got to Hogwarts. We both try to stay in touch with all that. Besides, I’m hardly recognised around here anymore.”
Is there anywhere he can go without hearing about or seeing Potter? He wishes he had a cigarette, or someone to bum one from, but the beer garden out front is empty. Instead, he sits at an empty table, aware that his head is spinning from one drink too many. He rests it in his hands. He really shouldn’t apparate.
Draco is almost hanging off the bed when he wakes the next morning, his face halfway past the mattress, an arm dangling through the blankets toward the floor, and Harry is tucked against him, an arm flung over Draco’s back while his side of the bed lays cold and empty. He groans a little at the ache of his muscles and immediately feels movement beside him.
my god, that explains so much,” Hermione gushes. “Such a rich magical history there, do you know Tamil is one of the longest-surviving classical languages? There’s a lot of spells with linguistic origins from Tamil wizarding—of course you know, you just read.” She blushes and sips her wine with focus.
It’s a while before he receives a response, and he’s just beginning to think he’s annoyed Draco into radio silence when Rose giggles excitedly at the approaching owl.
“It’s like you asked me to pick a favourite child! I meant to bring some clothes over, honest. I stared at my wardrobe and just couldn’t choose.”
He leans back to prop the door open for her and she screeches past them, the crown falling to her neck like a necklace. Now, they sit alone across from each other on a purple rug covered in fairies.
They land outside Harry’s. Draco follows him through the door and cautiously starts to pull his arm from the sleeve of his coat while Harry rather angrily yanks off his own. Optimistically, he holds out hope that somehow this negative energy is unrelated to him—that while he was discovering that he enjoyed spending time with Teddy, Harry was learning familial things that made him angry and sad. The thought twists through his gut with guilt, but he doesn’t feel it any less.
Aurors on-duty and off surround the woman but won’t step closer, unsure whether to touch her, acting unaware of what’s happened or from where the curse has originated. For just a moment, Draco’s breath catches in his throat, watching everyone immobile in shock, mourning the loss of discretion he’s about to experience.
He climbs the stairs to Draco’s flat and almost turns back. He was going to wait for Monday. And sleep on it once more. But he’s worried that Ginny’s influence will wear off before tomorrow comes.
The unease grows into a sense of emergency, and Draco drops the teacups with a splash, moving towards the study with a speed he didn’t know he had. He spins around the doorframe, his hand gripped to the casing to take the corner swiftly.
Stopping curses, neutralising them, then, felt as right as that felt wrong. Like a due to society. A way to use his charms mastery for something meaningful. The riddle of it, too, scratched an itch in his brain; a love of intricacy and puzzle. He enjoyed charms, and when he put it simply, curses were just charms with bite. He leaned into it, slowly narrowing focus until he found himself working with cursed objects.
Harry and Draco are separated to give statements. Two Healers buzz around him while he talks, spending way too long explaining his necklace to Mari and another young Auror to try and make sense of how he found the Bodes, accidentally advertising Draco’s next book in the process when they’re still a bit lost. Luckily, they don’t need much from him—the objects Murray thought were with a specialist in Munich sat hidden in her office and a bedroom of the family home had been converted into a potions lab.
It’s the simplest reason to mention. He doesn’t miss the look of subtle shock on his friends’ faces, but his own expression says he doesn’t wish to explain further, and Pansy stops badgering him. Blaise says nothing but glances at him like a man who’d thought he had most of the story and now feels like he’s been shortchanged.
As ignorant as it seems, Draco’s forgotten that those not trained in the Dark Arts are less prepared to come against them. Like a swelling tide, it hits him at once; Harry Potter, sixteen just like him, and while he’s being torn apart by a mission to kill Dumbledore, Harry’s discovering horcruxes, coping with a prophecy foreseeing either his untimely death or that of Voldemort. All just six years since he’d first heard he could be a wizard.
He shoves off the bannister they were leaning against and ignores the suck of breath that means Draco has comprehended his words, realised whose door they were facing.
Mostly, he guides his hand across each item without problem until twice he hesitates, stops meticulously to confirm, and levitates first a small gift basket of chocolate frogs and then another flower arrangement to the box holding the lilies. Harry responds with a sharp intake of breath through his nose with each one.
Once he emerges, they say goodbye to Pansy and take a floo in St. Mungo’s back to his. Draco stumbles immediately upon crossing the hearth on his books, and when Harry reaches for his arm he wrenches it away.
She picks up her wand beside her on the table, reaching into the bag proving futile (it’s an expanding bag Draco got her years ago for Christmas. He’s gotten used to watching her dig elbow deep into the clutch), and summons a set of blueprints. They look like the French chateau she’d bought on the outskirts of Chalais earlier that year.
Draco’s London flat must have sensitised him to acreage like this because despite his childhood home he was momentarily awestruck by the size of it all. And yet, southern France in autumn was a wonderful corner of the world, and even torn literally and figuratively by a Portkey from the middle of a rather important series of events in his life, he found himself fully understanding his mother’s interest in the countryside.
“Not sure. Something about that girl. Did you not tell him you’d kissed someone? You’re supposed to tell your best mates when you kiss a girl. Best mates tell each other things.”
Beside him, Harry sees Draco’s mouth open and close, speechless, but he says nothing. Harry wouldn’t know what to say either. Even Hermione briefly widens her eyes in exasperation staring down at the table, but Ron’s an adult, and neither of them can do anything more to speed up a valid forgiveness process.
He wills it into a still in his mind; a moment so clear that he could extract it for a Pensieve and at a second’s notice re-watch Harry look at him like this, with gratitude and ease and comfort. He can pretend, just for a self-serving minute, that what he feels is mutual.
Ron takes him to get lunch and they eat quietly at their place with Hermione and Rose, though the two of them are still digesting the latest information too much to be entertaining companions. Eventually, he relays everything they’ve learned, and they both nod along empathetically with Hermione’s shock at Lucrezia’s involvement.
He shakes his head quickly, frowning. “No, sorry, er, do you have any connections. Political, personal…”
“Why don’t I worry about the research and you worry about the editing?” he grumbles. It’s more biting than he meant. “Sorry. I’m just not ready to give up on it. I have one more theory. Something on Protean Charms, I think I’m close.”
Harry leans back against the armchair again. “Oh, I know you do. She told me all about your Quidditch bets and the sort. Why didn’t you say? I was just talking about her.”
“Yes, sir,” he forces out. There’s nothing more distressing, he’s decided, than a mentor reminding you of your worth.
Still, he has to assure Harry twice more before he turns it on, settling for an oldies Muggle station. Not long after, just as he’s moved a skillet from the stove to the oven, he feels a presence standing in the doorway, which waits for the oven door to shut before reaching closer and taking the beer from Harry’s hand to replace it with his fingers.
“Draco, dear,” she asked with a lifted chin. “How am I supposed to get to know your beau if you’ve sat directly between us like a pebble in my shoe?”
he thinks. Pansy’s scoffing, too—she knows him just as well. The look they share is at once private and bonding. They both stifle a laugh they’d be hexed dead for if heard through the door.
There’s a serene quiet to the walk, to being alone with himself in a way that he doesn’t often feel—unfindable, uncontactable. Maybe if he’s lucky it’ll have the same effect on him that it seems to have on Draco, and he’ll finally have the inspiration to see a connection in the casework that’s hidden from him thus far. Unlike Draco, who seems to work best staring straight at the problem—like a cursed skull for hours at a time—Harry tends to only get frustrated as he rereads the same notes for the thousandth time.
Draco smiles along, lets himself be flattered, and when he finally escapes, he apparates home and sees Harry sitting at one of the empty tables outside a dark Spoonfuls. He stands suddenly when he recognises Draco’s approaching form.
They fall soundless again, and Harry watches Draco’s face. It shifts occasionally from relaxed to pinched and back. He hopes it doesn’t mean he’s in pain. He must’ve been, in the bathroom—it’s all he can think about. The curse, when he traced it, seemed terrible, not to mention the physical wound, the back of his head.
“So we’ll be like the geese. Together. You know, take to open air, aim higher than our past, all that, yeah? Fuck history. Fuck the Ministry. Fuck
“Harry, you’re a bloody celebrity! I know you don’t act like one, and I love that, but you’re still you. You need… security. Wards. God almighty…” He throws a hand into his hair. “No wonder. I’m lucky you weren’t assassinated ages ago.”
Draco adjusts his posture on the bench and sits forward with a bit more interest when Lars joins him in the ring.
“Well, I barely feel Indian, do I? At least I know about televisions and muggle money—more than I know about my grandparents. Excuse me if I don’t want to write off my childhood completely!”
“Right, well. When I began working closely with cursed objects, I practised a method using the tonic—essentially training my magic to discover traces independently. So over time I became more and more accustomed to recognising magic and its intensities with less tonic. And now… with none. I just… feel it,” he finishes simply.
be?” Ron says. Some sauce from his sandwich drips and he catches it in his hand just before it can hit his Auror robes.
The answer is relayed through a note handed over by Draco upon his return. He’d caught Orsix out front, and extends it to Harry in the reading chair between the index and middle fingers of an outstretched arm, shifting the heavy cauldron on his hip.
Draco blushed a little and smiled soberly, forcing himself to keep his gaze on the show and not turn his head towards Harry. "You are all that exists too, Harry."
Draco felt better when Harry returned and took his hand. He ran his fingers down his forearm. He was tactile. He was warm.
Harry let her get back to the house and entered the hospital lobby. He immediately attracted the attention of the patients, but ignored them completely. He even allowed himself, with incredible arrogance and disdain, to pass the entire queue to attract the attention of a nurse behind the reception desk. She recognised Harry Potter and immediately got up to lead him upstairs. Never mind that there were other emergencies more urgent than Harry's concern. He did not pause for thought.
Ten minutes later, he regretted it, because he was very, very close to cumming in his trousers untouched, which had not happened to him since he was fifteen.
"Because of Sectumsempra. Because of the kind of people I employ there, and especially because of the kind of projects I run there."
Scorpius tilted his head from left to right. He liked to be just with his Papa from time to time, but sometimes he felt like he was sad on those nights, not like he usually was. He laughed a lot less, and when he thought Scorpius wasn't looking at him, he didn't smile too much. Scorpius wondered if it wasn't mostly Papa who was disappointed, when Daddy worked late.
"It's not just your job, Harry," Ron replied. "Aren't you the one with custody of the Malfoy boy? I'm not sure a court will let you have it if you cause an incident within the Ministry itself."
Harry Accioed the ropes he had prepared for the evening. He tied Draco's wrists and forearms tightly over his head and fastened them to the headboard with no room for wiggling. With Draco lying on his back, he spread his legs and tied his ankles to the foot of the bed. The ragged rope against the luxurious sheets, against the delicate skin made Harry groan. Draco was lost. He kept whispering "please, please, Master, Harry". Crazy with desire for this man who moaned as he looked at him with eyes of molten mercury, Harry sank to his body.
He orders it, with the same emergency tone he’d used at Flourish and Blotts, when urgent precision was of the utmost importance, and Harry looks stricken by the order. He’ll want to make a case for arguing for Draco, or stepping between him and the Aurors, and there’s no time for a Socratic seminar on the subject so he points his wand at Harry and selfishly studies his face one last time.
“Hm,” Harry frowns thoughtfully. “But mine has such a nice face. Look at his eyes,” he says, framing Ron’s face in his hands.
Harry sets the boxes down in resignation that this is now a discussion, not a storming-out, but his voice is still low and tight.
“I would’ve loved Hogwarts in the summer, I think. I always hoped I’d get to stay. That they’d stop me getting on the train at the last moment.”
.” Harry drives them towards the nearest wall, Draco leaning right beside the coatrack, lips already on his neck, and he can feel the urgency, the desperation in his breath against his throat.
Harry has to leave Draco to his own defence when he hears a grunt and spins quickly to see Hadrian turning to him with his wand held high, recovered. In a split second of reckless bravery, Harry chooses to run at him rather than duck behind any sheeted furniture. The man’s eyes are wide in astonishment at seeing a wandless man running straight towards him, and by the time the first spell explodes out, Harry’s already deflecting it by knocking his arm out of the way. The blast hits the basement window and something incredibly sharp makes contact just behind his ear. But it’s distracted Hadrian too, and Harry can’t afford to miss an opportunity, so he pushes the sensation out of his consciousness and sweeps one of the man’s feet instead.
“Tough shit. That doesn’t mean you maim yourself. You know this is gonna heal. It’s non-magical fire. Do I need to put you on a watch so you don’t try again?”

It’s not until Monday that he begins to secretly hope Harry will do what he does best and defy his wishes. On Tuesday, he craves it. On Wednesday, he smacks his elbow on the bedroom doorframe trying to reach the front door before a third round of knocks starts. He must not mask his disappointment well when he opens the door to find Pansy standing there, because she fixes him with a bewildered expression verging on pity, and proceeds to whack him with the
“Lucrezia is in,” Yolanda suggests, pointing back to the other office behind her desk. He sees Murray’s number two look up at her name. Harry considers it seriously; she’d gotten all the case paperwork and had hand-delivered the last evidence to him, so she must be up to speed. More than that, she’s actually agreeable.
He has nothing better to do. Once again, he’s awaiting execution. He mounts Harry’s broom, kicks off higher than Teddy and shows him just the drop upside down, then the drop upside down into a corkscrew.
much? God, I could’ve been healing that while Ron and Hermione worked on the curse. I was just sitting there.”
“I think so?” Harry shrugs. “I haven’t thought about it much again, besides that it’s made Fridays exceptionally awkward.”
“When I get frustrated, I do better. The more I let my temper go, the more I improve. It’s why I love to hit the punching bag when I’ve been personally wronged.”
Then, against all odds, he’s even managed to get him back to the gym, and in honest-to-god trainers and shorts. They’ve arrived at his usual time on a Friday, and the gym is moderately busy with the usual suspects. Draco’s overconfident agreement must be too good to be true, he thinks, as he drags him to the lockers. A glance over at him as Harry stows their things leads him to believe that there might have been more self-assurance in his agreement than his actual demeanour presents.
He huffs under his breath. Malfoy’s complacency now is more newsworthy than the earlier stings. When they step through the door, Murray’s gone, rather anticlimactically.
He drains his glass, charms it clean politely and places it back where he found it. Then, with a flick of his wand, he restores the office to order. The spell sends Harry and his chair racing back towards the window. He laughs, standing and rejoining Draco, who’d sent him flying with a sly humour Harry’s learned to recognise, face emotionless without so much as a quirk of an eyebrow. He’s innocently sliding his arms back into his coat.
He jumps awake at the pounding sound on the other side of the flat. Harry’s awake, too, eyes wide in sleepy shock and fumbling for his glasses.
Draco’s beginning to feel cross. “No, say it! Whatever it is, say it. Godric knows this isn’t helping and I look like an idiot.”
Draco follows his finger to see her at the tail end of a chase out the window; Victoire following Teddy, Teddy following Harry, Harry following Rose, whose short legs were slowing the entire chase to a crawl.
and that would be heartbreaking enough, but the more natural conclusion that follows will kill him. He follows the intuition anyway, regretfully, and walks slowly behind her desk to stand outside Lucrezia’s door.
“Erm, well with the evidence results, I… there’s work I should get done at the office. So maybe I’ll just see you Wednesday, send Orsix with the details.”
“What a great question,” he eventually replies. “Unfortunately, one I don’t know the answer to. But I
It shouldn’t be disappointing that Malfoy’s uncomfortable around a gay man—you’d have to desire acceptance to be disappointed and Harry refused to admit that he wanted anything resembling approval from this man.
Harry’s watching him flex and grunt into the impromptu workout of crossing the wide river. They bob high in the wake of motorboats, and sweat breaks quickly across his brow. Occasionally, he raises a sleeve to his forehead to dab it.
He cusses under his breath, wiping his arm clean and turning his shirt sleeve back down, then reenters his bedroom, where Pansy sits in a knee-length sage flapper-looking dress on the chaise in the corner, messing with her updo. There’s a bejewelled hair clip between her teeth.
He does his best to explain the very specific terror he felt outside the Ministry—at this, Blaise meets his gaze more knowingly than Harry could ever manage, something he’s always grateful for from his Slytherin friends—and then the surprising way that tracing the cursed package to Harry stilled his heart.
Harry whips his head from Malfoy’s persistent stare to Ron. “What? He’s not obsessed. He never was.”
wished for something like this. Not even in school. At most I hoped he’d… I don’t know, get hexed or knocked down a few pegs with that ego. Lose some of that ignorance. I saved his life during the battle. I’d do it ten times over now.”
Teddy kicks off the grass behind the house and begins flying low circles around Draco, who stands investigating the broom Harry keeps at the residence.
“As much as I would love nothing more than to shirk my obligations and finish some unfinished business, I have work and I still need to go home and change.”
“See, but my intentions were clearly good,” he starts, pointing to the scarf. “So you don’t have to—eagh!”
while we start some leads. You can admit it looked bad.” He speaks lower, and Harry leans back in disgust as he moves in to whisper closer. “He’s not exactly been a fervent supporter of yours...”
Besides a temper that’s stood the test of time, he looks good, Harry admits, considering that the last time he’d seen him was at his post-war trial, where he’d appeared especially gaunt, drawn pallid in shame. Or recluse. Of course, he’d been shooting daggers then, too, even though Harry was there to speak on his behalf.
Draco’s so enveloped in his thoughts that he doesn’t realise his mistake until the white-hot, searing pain has already incapacitated him. He gasps loudly, drawing his hand back from an innocuous skull sitting buried among his papers, but it’s too late.
Truthfully, he’s been recalling that image—Malfoy deeply focused, wand hidden away, one pale hand running up along the bookshelf—all afternoon. It distracted him at the office, putting in the order for curse detection, trying to put it into words for the case report. Stuck to his thoughts like peanut butter to the roof of his mouth. The how? returning again and again.
Draco can feel his ears heating while Harry looks back and forth, recognising that they’ve brought up separate instances at Jab. He meets Draco’s eyes with a refreshingly different expression—one more familiar, pleading for intervention.
He breathes a laugh, then feels Harry leave his side. It’s not long before he returns, and with a glass of water that he sets by the base of the toilet. He pulls his wand, too, and begins whispering something while he traces it down Draco’s stomach.
Draco can’t hear much of what Harry speaks through the fire from his position by the kitchen doorway, but it comes through clearly when he says “Erm… let me check, I have a mate over…” because he’s ducking out, turning and looking for him. He waves Draco closer, rolling his eyes at the distance he’d had put between himself and the fire, and when he still stops short by the back of the sofa, he sighs and takes a few steps towards him.
Though they spend Saturday morning lazily traipsing about Draco’s place, Harry and Draco don’t see each other again for the rest of the weekend. He’s kicked out before noon, about when a crazed look enters Draco’s eyes while he’s calculating how much work still needs to get done and how much time is available to do it.
Harry trudges upstairs to the allure of a hot shower, exhaling audibly as the steam and heat seem to wash off the day. He runs his hands through his tangled curls, combing through them with soapy fingers. Then, as he does after most sparring days, he slowly investigates his body, running his hands over his temple and where Lars had caught his chin, feeling no broken skin, knowing he’ll probably have a nasty dark bruise to heal in the morning.
Harry frowns. He’s never had a daughter, but he has Rose and he has Teddy, and when he held them both he thought, terrified by the immenseness of the feeling, ‘
"I'm not afraid of him, you know." Draco had a playful smile on his face, but Harry wasn't entirely sure of that statement. Draco probably didn't know what to expect. As far as Harry knew, he had managed not to be alone with his father for years.
For a moment Harry felt like lying to Callum. He didn't understand the urge and fought it, "Yes, he is. Let me give you my address."
"Call it any way you please. I admire you. And I imagine it must have been hard going through it all alone. Merlin, that explains so much... That's why Lucius and Narcissa never saw him, right?"
Harry ate it and complimented the little chief and played with him. Draco and Harry crowded into the little tepee in Scorpius' room to read him a story together. As big and strong and clever and increasingly self-reliant and resourceful as he was, Scorpius fell asleep on Harry's lap like the little child he was. Harry got up and cradled him for a moment, unable to bring himself to put him to bed.
Harry promised. He deactivated all the sensors and bugs in the room and hallway, and shielded them before leaving the room. When he closed the door, he saw Jules standing, drawing slow circles with his wand over his head, enveloping Draco and him in a force field of secrecy so strong that Harry could see them as if through a thick mist, could not see their lips move, and could not hear a sound coming from them.
Harry had done so many things he hadn't done before in the last few weeks. Like thinking of himself, thinking of their family before anything else. Like marrying Draco in the middle of the rubble to protect them. Like asking Draco to fuck him before he went to AK a terrorist. Like standing up to his superiors and colleagues and going after an implausible investigation for the sake of his husband.
Harry waited a few minutes after Jules left, but when Draco failed to give him a signal, he eventually returned to his office. Draco's face was impassive. He looked at Harry as he entered, but did not smile or say anything.
"Dada! Kiss!" demanded Nova, jealously, as she stretched her arms towards Theo. He was feeding her, so he wiped her little mouth covered in green mash before giving her the kiss and hug she asked for.
"I thought you might want to see a traditional celebration at least once," Draco explained, his eyes softening as he walked over to Harry to adorn him with ivy. "I don't know about your father, but I know that in your grandfather Charlus Potter's day, they still celebrated it."
Harry found an employee of the Department of Mysteries. The situation was even worse than he had expected. In the second company that had used temporal protection, the boss and anchor had not been in the building that day. He had been picked up and taken care of by the Ministry, which supplied him with magic to maintain the spell. So the danger was almost exclusively from Sectumsempra. But Harry was told again that they were not the priority, that they were safe for the moment. It was this 'for the moment' that drove Harry mad.
Harry smiled at him for a long time. Then he cleaned him up. And kissed him slowly in the tepid water of the bath.
Harry stood up and picked up the strap again. He turned the last of the cold wax from Draco's body into miniature black snowstorms that swirled around the room. His sub's skin, now free of all black, was not white. It was pink, and red, and purple. Harry stood in front of the mirror and jerked his cock, in full view of Draco. After only four or five flicks of his wrist, he covered his sub's back and buttocks with cum. "Thank you," Draco whispered, exhausted. Harry smiled.
The man climaxed before Harry, on Draco's shoulder and chest, covering him with thick cum. He talked to him for a bit, then cleaned him up with a wave of his wand. Immaculate again.
Draco couldn't even remember the last time he'd flown. He picked out four brooms that had come out within the year, unhooked them and weighed them, caressing their curves. They looked brand new.
The doctors pouted in a way that made Harry understand that it was neither very reasonable nor totally unacceptable. "We could lower your doses gradually," conceded the doctor.
The weekend 'toys' trip with Callum was hilarious and informative, and they went to what seemed to Harry the entirety of the BDSM shops in London and its suburbs to start Harry's collection. Callum's new sub had come along too - Thomas, a psychology student who had one of the cutest smiles Harry had ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on. He also happened to be the man who was literally chained up in Callum's basement the last time he was at Harry's house. His blonde curly hair on top of his head was completely shaved at the sides and back. One of his ears had numerous gold piercings, and Harry discovered at a fitting that his nipples were pierced too. Thomas was fairly new to the scene, and Callum was his first real Dom. He was enthusiastic about everything, cheeky and completely under the spell of Callum's natural authority and aura. He happily served to demonstrate to Harry the workings of certain objects and instruments. Harry came home that evening with his arms full of bags and in a very good mood. But as he unpacked his purchases, he thought longingly of the person for whom he had actually bought them.
The day Harry realised he was in love with Draco Malfoy, they had been dating for less than three weeks. They'd had dinner with Callum, Benjamin and Thomas in the gay district, at a pretentious but genuinely good arty restaurant. They'd all had a bit too much to drink, due to Callum's propensity to buy bottles and bottles of champagne when he was in a good mood.
Harry ran into a few acquaintances and was offered glasses of Prosecco. When an equally lively and deliciously romantic music played, he let himself be dragged onto the dance floor, under the lanterns hanging in the false olive trees. He spotted a wizard who was dancing, literally bursting with energy, his movements precise and in tempo, his white shirt half open. He was blond and handsome, and was clinging to a taller man around whose neck he had wrapped a tie. He was under thirty. Like a few other customers, he wore a glamour, but not one of those heavy, suffocating things that indicated at first glance that he had nothing in common with his real face. Just enough to make himself unidentifiable. He was genuinely attractive. His glamour was so light that Harry could even see his purple dark circles. He seemed to be enjoying himself so much that Harry forgot about them.
