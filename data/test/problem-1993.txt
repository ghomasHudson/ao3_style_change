“Of course,” said Narcissa putting her son in check, which she took pride in, especially his reaction after she said the simple word. “Harry could have done something to your mind, which makes it alert you with the pain of a slight stinging hex, which would cause you to break eye contact.”
“I’m going to miss him,” said Sirius, whispering.
Narcissa laughed and shook her head slightly. “No at all, Draco,” she said. “As you’re aware, the only Black that can actually perform Legilimency is Bellatrix and no one else, not even half out ancestors could do it, despite what we claim. The big, bad, dark family had to uphold our reputation and simply claimed that we could. Bellatrix is the first Black in almost seven decades to actually perform Legilimency successfully.”
“Was it a werewolf?” asked Neville, his eyes flashing with curiosity.
Chapter 22 –
“Me? As if.”
Harry picked himself up off the floor, trying to hide back tears as he reached for his glasses and rushed out of the room, he didn’t look at Ron or Hermione, he just ran out. He sat in a small indent in the wall, where hopefully no one would see him.
“Well, it’s nothing like battling Inferi, jumping over spells, or taking on some sort of supervillain intent on enslaving the world,” said Harry, grinning as he spoke. “I did hear something interesting about some sort of spell or potion in the library that had been handed down from student to student for years. I had no intention of going to search for it until I had better information, but we can go and have a gander. It’s probably fake, anyway. I mean, it was a Weasley who mentioned it.”
“You doubt Harry’s ability to be charming when he wishes to be, dear,” said Narcissa, giving her son a knowing look. “You also forget that he can be rather cute and childlike at the same time. He was rather blessed in the looks department, especially considering that he hardly looks his age. He looks much younger than he is and that could make many witches fall head-over-heels for him.”
” = Parseltongue
Harry just snorted, watching as the rickety shelf put itself back together, appearing as if it was brand new. He smiled at it and tucked his wand away, his eyes darting across the store and onto an object that instantly pulled his attention.
“I s-saw m-my p-parents die,” most of what Harry was saying wasn’t clear, interrupted by sobs and slight sniffing. “I KILLED THEM!” The sudden shout caused Draco to jump, but he kept firm, “they didn’t-” Harry sniffed, “-they didn’t even put up a fight, t-they even s-said I was w-worse than V-Voldemort!”
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” whispered Hermione, her eyes narrowed. “You’re the only person who hasn’t got it correct yet.”
Harry nodded and sat in one of the chairs that was pushed towards the side, just under the large window. The chair was actually far more comfortable than it looked, seeing a sit looked like a slab of stone.
Harry honestly had no idea why Daphne Greengrass was with them and not walking with her group of whiny friends, better known as Tracey and Pansy. It wasn’t that he disliked the girl, but her mere presence was annoying and she kept gravitating towards Draco, intentionally stumbling so he would keep her standing.
“Actually inquired about getting the students to help, but the Minister wasn’t having it. If one student is missing, putting more out there won’t help, at least according to him.”
“Nah,” replied Miles with a shake of his head. “There’s not many people here that could fit the role of Seeker right.”
Harry grinned and turned to Hermione, “I have something for you also!” She jumped softly on the spot, Harry pulled out a few expensive books, things that she would utilize daily, but for an odd reason the books were extremely expensive.
“Don’t try to flatter me, Harry.”
Harry blinked and listened as the two girls began attacking him. He listened to it for a couple of seconds before he hit Greengrass with a curse that sent her flying towards a nearby wall.
“No need to curse Weasel.”
“It means that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again,” said Dumbledore gravely, his eyes flickered towards Professor Snape who had just rushed in. “Any news?”
He had barely made it up a few streets before he was engulfed in bright lights, which had obviously been following him. He turned around when he noticed that the car had stopped and wasn’t going as fast as it should be. He instantly noticed the familiar pattern on the car and knew that it was the Muggle police, the Muggle version of Aurors. He grimaced as he lifted up his right forearm to block the blaring lights from his eyes.
“If you were being cooperative, as you put it, you would not have blatantly attacked an Auror,” said Severus, his eyes narrowing at the look he received. “I know that you attacked a certain Auror called Nymphadora Tonks.”
“You’re
“I’m pretty sure Seamus will do better than someone who nearly dies every Quidditch game.”
He really wanted to laugh, knowing that such a generic style suited Granger perfectly. She was too simple-minded to have a decent or unique style. In fact, even as he heard Moody speak about it, the man sounded bored.
Of course, that thought vanished into thin air when the dark emerald drapes were slowly pulled open, revealing a bunch of expressionless mannequins that looked like they were made of cement.
,” she hissed, surprised. “
“I love it,” Arthur said, regaining his posture, “it still has the same feeling of being home, but it’s so much more elegant, you didn’t have to do this, you didn’t!” A tear streamed down Arthur’s face.
“Oh, do explain your humble opinion, Granger.”
Harry jumped a mile high when he heard Snape’s voice, “y-yes sir, it really was impressive, and I heard you talking about it two years ago.” Harry rubbed the back of his head where he hit it against the cupboard and closed the door. “Its fine though, clearly none left.”
“Mr. Potter, perhaps it would be prudent if we began to head towards the Slytherin common room,” said Professor Snape. “Mr. Malfoy is starting to drive half of Slytherin mad with his questions and constant whining about your absence.”
“He’s famous in our world, the Muggles don’t know what he had done, what he’s lost and all the suffering he endures on a daily basis. That’s the issue with Harry; I regret how I treated him.”
“Obviously,” said Harry, bored. “However, not everything is based on Hogwarts and the previous war. It does seem coincidental, though. It came out this year and the war is known history. Maybe a Muggle-born wrote the script.”
“He can’t talk,” started Ron, glaring at the boy. “Just leave him to read his stupid book.”
“Where d’you think they’re going?”
“Riddle had cast some astonishing things,” said Salazar. “He always had an aura of darkness around him due to his constant use of the Dark Arts. Dark wizards flocked to him in droves because of this and that is how he coined the term ‘Dark Lord’. The other students considered him a lord of dark magic.”
He stood in the middle of the mirror, and saw his reflection, he scoffed and debated calling the mirror a liar until he looked around and caught sight of a woman with dark red hair next to him, and he instantly knew it was his mother. He edged just a little closer, to the left of his reflection he saw his father with a proud smile on his face, a hand firmly on his shoulder. He was taken aback slightly, surely his greatest desire wasn’t his family, what a pathetic desire. What happened to the power, the fear, money or heritage? They made sense, this didn’t. He heard the door behind him open, and saw Neville Longbottom almost fall through the door and into the room, eternally grateful that he was invisible, he slinked across to the side and watched quietly.
,” hissed the snake, slightly annoyed. “
“Too many people, Lily, too many people.” he trailed off, with a sigh.
“Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, not wanting to provoke the large boy. “You’re Quidditch Captain? Nice.”
“Severus and Annette Grey,” said Lily. “Both Slytherins, one a half-blood and the other a traditionalist pure-blood. We got along perfectly fine and no one really cared, despite the fact I was a Muggle-born. Let’s not forget that this was during the unforgiving reign of You-Know-Who.”
“You stay here and put your clothes and such away, you’ll be here for two weeks, if you didn’t pack enough a quick trip to Diagon Alley isn’t a massive issue. I’ll be back in a second.” Draco smiled and left.
“For being a homosexual, and because my parents left me an orphan, I was often beat because my parents were dead and I should join them.”
“I couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin. “The Boggart that’s sitting in the darkness inside the cupboard hasn’t yet assumed a form. He doesn’t know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door.”
“I don’t understand.”
“You don’t need to eat faster on my account,” said Petunia sharply, her eyes landing on his plate. “I just came in to ask a question while Vernon is occupied.”
Chapter revised:
“If you’re both getting it, perhaps it’s related to the Tournament.”
“You’re forgetting that I’m an Occlumens, as well.”
Gilderoy Lockhart didn’t look put out at all. “We can just include the father son fight in my article,” he said happily, his charming smile didn’t waver.
”And neither should they,” Hermione said. ”Draco, however, shouldn’t pay for his father’s sins.”
“I really wanted to spend the day with him,” Lily said, rubbing the back of her head with a sudden grimace. “But my head hurts. Would you really do that for him? I could… I could bake a cake. For him.”
been a disaster and a half.
Things did change, though not the way Harry had hoped for.
Harry thought then, but didn’t dare to voice that question. Bellatrix spoke as if him being able to revive - in some meaning of the word - his father made him part of another world altogether, which was just… absurd. “Okay,” he ended up saying in the end.
is involved.”
“Think he’ll wait if you don’t make a move now?”
“Just Harry,” Harry said. “I’m ten.”
Was it pathetic to feel so comforted by an object, not for what it was, but for what it represented?
“It’s a shite situation to be in, isn’t it,” Ron pitched in. “Not to sound… too depressing, or anything, but… even though I know we can move on and live our lives if we just focus on all the good things we have now, and not think of all the tough things we still have to do, it’s not easy. It’s not easy, when life is as intimidating as it is. But also, on the other hand, I don’t think it’s right to expect normalcy already, you know? Considering everything we’ve been through, and honestly, it’s not been that long since Voldemort was still running around, so it’s kind of unreasonable for us to expect to just… get back to normal.”
“Most children of that age do
“There will be muggle-born students who only recently learned of their admittance to Hogwarts. Besides, not many students even from half-blood or pureblood families care to study school materials as diligently as you have. That said - everyone struggles in the beginning. You must keep in mind that demanding constant excellence is cruel.”
“I’m not sure.”
, he heard Lily stomping away. Which, in itself, was odd. Harry couldn't remember his mother ever being in the habit of stomping. It was something she had started doing only recently.
“I’d be surprised if he didn’t, honestly. But maybe. I don’t know.”
Unfortunate for the boy, but the benefits of not needing to deal with his parents were appreciated.
Harry thought sadly, watching Nott fiddle with the corpse without noticing anything different about it.
“You’ve done a brilliant job with all of this,” Harry said, moving out of the kitchen area. “I’m… this is amazing.”
Ron and Hermione weren’t. Ron had lost two of his brothers and Hermione had all but lost her parents, while Harry hadn’t lost anyone in the last battle,
Mordred’s Mend was an odd house.
“Enough.” Bellatrix’s voice brought him crashing back, and as Harry blinked his eyes open, he saw her right in front of him, with barely two steps between them. The woman was looking at him with wide,
There wasn’t a reason to be worried, though. He was fine. Just a bit tired.
“What about—”
“Close your eyes and kneel down,” Bellatrix said then. When Harry did, he could’ve
Association with those people would cast Harry into a lifestyle the boy would likely never understand. Unlike other pureblood children, Antonin knew that Harry had been kept away from political discussions of all kinds, knowing only the barest of versions of how the First Wizarding War had ended with the fall of the Dark Lord and the survival of the Longbottoms. He didn’t grow up knowing how their kind hand been wronged and how their power had been chipped away bit by bit.
“Lestrange,” Uncle Tony said, the tone of his voice enough of a warning for now. The woman –
He didn’t want to regret this. He wasn’t sure what he was there for, but leaving now felt wrong. Vernon’s car was nowhere to be seen, and Harry wondered if Petunia wasn’t home either. Harry took a deep breath and began walking towards the front door, knowing in his heart that this would be the last time he ever came here. Moments after he rang the doorbell, he could hear someone walking inside, and the door opened to reveal Aunt Petunia. Her thin, blonde hair was longer than Harry remember, and the pale blue dress she was wearing was equally unfamiliar. The moment she realized who was standing in front of her, the pleasant smile on her face dropped, and Harry briefly thought of how unfamiliar that had made her face to him. She had never showed him a pleasant smile, after all.
”Good morning,” Ginny said, as soon as he stumbled his way into the kitchen. Her red hair was in a braid, and she looked composed and content. Well, as content as grief would allow her to be. When she gestured towards a covered plate, he could see that her nails had been painted in different colours. ”Well, it’s almost noon, really. Everyone else is out, but Mum left something for you to snack on.”
“Yes, Mr. Nott,” Harry muttered, sitting down. “Um… the books say it’s a rare type of Dark magic. They say it’s all about bringing back the dead, but not much else.”
their magic the way Harry did.
“No necromancer could be neutral,” Lestrange sneered. “Especially if we teach him the things he needs to know. The Dark Lord will be pleased to have him. After all— who would stand against a necromancer? Longbottom? I think not!”
”There will always be people willing to believe in the innocence of purebloods,” Ginny replied with a grimace. ”Because no matter what, there will always be people who have nothing else to value about themselves aside from purity of blood. To them, purebloods can do almost anything and they will be excused. I don’t think Malfoy will escape the consequences completely, however. There’s too much evidence against him and his dad.”
“We’ll have a practice run today,” Crabbe said. “An introductory session, really, for you to familiarize yourself with the concept and be able to mentally prepare for the real, longer sessions. Antonin - your fireplace works in this office, right? Harry and I might as well just floo to Highfield Hollow directly from here.”
Uncle Tony let out an annoyed sigh, falling silent when the waitress returned with their food. When she left, he spoke again. “Do you recall anything happening to cause this?”
stop his heart from beating faster, thinking of the life he could have if Lily just…
Antonin looked at Harry, who had clearly been waiting to share his news. The boy had patiently sat through most of the lunch listening to his godfather, but couldn’t wait any longer.
“Madeleine’s Burrow,” Malfoy replied. “She’s the only one to ever use this place. Taernsby Cottage is a good change, Potter. Well done.”
(See the end of the chapter for
”I’m sure they told you, but the war is over for good, now,” he said. ”And I won’t be coming here after today.”
'Yikes,' Harry thought. He didn't really feel one way or another about the Boy-Who-Lived, but then again... he also didn't feel much about the Dark Lord or any of the people Bellatrix kept hissing about.
“You know what’s funny?” Crabbe asked, though he didn’t sound like he was amused. “Nott told me something similar. He even took it a bit further and showed me using a muggle what would happen, as if he would actually dare. The boy is my patient, and I’ll treat him accordingly. Whatever you and Nott are thinking, I have no interest in playing those games.”
”I don’t know,” he replied. ”Feels like I don’t know anything, really.”
telling me that you don’t see how that would affect his psyche?”
”I’ll tell you, I promise,” Harry assured him with a short laugh. ”I’ll keep you informed.”
The sound of the wailing continued, and Harry decided to head away from it. He didn’t wish to encounter whatever creature was willing to make noise in these Woods. Not when everything else was always so silent and still, as if frozen by the fear of being noticed.
”Sure,” Harry said. ”So we’ll meet here again in two weeks?”
“I know,” Hermione sighed, sipping her drink for a few contemplative moments, before hesitantly saying: “You know, Harry… I think Malfoy’s company is doing you some good. You’re always so much happier after meeting him.”
”She’s safe. It helps that she saved you, and that you openly said so. Lucius is already being held in Azkaban, which I think is too good for him.”
His godfather was a tall man. He was pale, too, with dark hair and pale grey eyes. His robes were black and heavy, with small shifting runes sown into its corners and folds. The man’s wand was strapped into his arm, ready to be used at a moment’s notice. He didn’t smile when he saw Harry. Not that it mattered - Harry had never seen him smile, anyway.
“He’s used to this.”
James was still wobbling behind her, falling apart more and more every day. Harry knew that he’d have to learn how to keep the dead things he brought back from falling apart over time, but who to ask? Where to look? His parents had tried to collect any book that would be useful in understanding necromancy, but most of the little that had been published was little more than theoretical speculation of magic thought to be extinct.
“I’m just curious.”
— that wasn’t safe in this House.
Instinctively, without thinking of why, Harry found himself rolling out of bed and crawling under it instead. He hoped - desperately - that his mother would continue her way past the room, and felt cold when he heard the sound of his door being pushed open. Moments later he could see his mother's feet right in front of him, her coming to a stop right by his bed.
His mother never could tell him why - well, she didn’t tell him much at all anymore - but the corridors weren’t
Sorry for the info dump on creatures, too! Trust me, all races have been slightly changed. Goblins, elves, dwarfs, vampires, werewolves, etc. :)
“Not until we see a kiss.” Pansy grinned, ignoring the daggers Harry shot at her.
“Ah,” said Harry, sitting down. “So, why did you decide to compete, then?”
“Indeed, when we’re both free I’ll come down, sorry to cut this short but I can see Hermione and I’ve been hunting for her forever.”
“It would be a great fall-back job, honestly,” said Harry. “Of course the two jobs differentiate, a Potions Master would stay in Britain, whereas an Alchemist would be all over the place.”
“Yes.”
James strode into Flourish and Blotts, a piece of parchment held loosely in his hand, and instantly saw a crowd forming just near the staircases. He saw Ronald Weasley hung up in the air by a very familiar spell, despite the crowd throwing various spells at it to make the spell release. He glanced around for the culprit of the spell, not that it could be many people as the spell wasn’t very well-known, especially in the current year.
“Whoa!” said Neville as he peered at the map with the same intensity that Hermione uses when she finds a new book to read. “Hang – this is Hogwarts! And that – no – is that really –?”
“So you’re all pure-bloods?” asked Hermione curiously.
“It has to be someone that’s the head of a position,” said James, rubbing his forehead. “That or an assistant to someone. It can’t be someone that’s in a low-ranking position because, well, they can’t make it to certain rooms and locations.”
“Takes a real Slytherin to manipulate the Soring Hat.”
“My reputation causes damage in large amounts.”
Snape ignored his wand, just sitting there, tormenting him. He debating just leaving it there but it was handed back to him by a first year Gryffindor, he tucked it into his robes and looked around, and he made his way to McGonagall who was desperately trying to keep a brave face.
Harry blinked as he felt the train give a sudden lurch, the sound of the wheels screeching along the train tracks, sparks spraying the outside of the windows with each second that went by. He lifted his head and glanced out of the window, his eyes returning back to the forest and the clearing that still looked like the perfect ambush spot. He quickly noticed that the outskirts of the forest were much thicker with plant growth and trees, making it harder to see in clearly.
“We’re wizards, Harry, superstition isn’t exactly common ground for us as we break most of them daily. We are supernatural, Harry, therefore we are superstition.”
“Good luck, Potter,” said Miles and Terence together.
“Back on topic,” said Tracey calmly. “They all get along with each other besides us, it’s like we’re the outcast house and they bond over that.”
: All Grown Up
,’ said Tom. ‘
Snape knew Harry would be a brat about this, Snape fired off a simple stunning spell, Snape watched it drift towards Harry.
them! Why didn’t we guess?”
“No, Weasley,” he said, sighing, “I was using a rather common Muggle expression that is said to people that are either slow, mentally, or stupid. I was asking whether you had brain damage or not. Anyway, the Trace does not apply here because you’re at home.”
A few gasps where heard, but that was it.
“Your loud shoes are making more noise than I am,” stated Harry, a smug expression on his face.
?” said Harry, stressing the word. “I’m impossible when I’m like what, Longbottom?”
Dean whimpered on the ground, trying not to glance in Harry’s direction. Harry was fuming, he wanted to rush out and hex Ron but that would cause Dean more issues later on, Harry would take a page from the Slytherin book and destroy Ron piece by piece.
He cast a quick spell, trying to locate where the boy had gone. The first attempt failed due to him knowing nothing at all about the boy, but a second spell that revealed all humans in the area and left a small trail towards them worked and he grinned in satisfaction, even as the trail of the boy was steadily vanishing.
Snape rolled his eyes, “focus on the memory you want and then extract it, it’s really simple. I would like you to extract the memory when you spoke with you parents at Godric’s Hollow with Narcissa and Draco.”
“Cheater,” muttered Harry under his breath and closed the cupboard. “Draco fill this cauldron with water.”
Harry was now curious on what Death had to do with the ghosts and why they remained. “Isn’t that suffering for you?” he asked curiously. “Not being able to move onwards.”
,” said Daphne, pointing at Neville Longbottom. “Not only that, but he didn’t explain anything that could happen like this.”
Neville stared at Hermione for a moment and bit into the chocolate, his eyes going wide as soon as he felt warmth spreading throughout his entire body, leaving the tips of his fingers tingling slightly.
He ran his finger over the spines of various tomes, his eyes searching for a title that would jump out and explain everything he needed to know. He pulled one tome from the shelf, twisting his wand to make it float behind him. He grabbed two more as he made his way back toward his usual desk. He sat down, sighing softly, and gently opened one of the books.
Harry nodded and placed his head under the tap in the sink, he watched the water wash over his eyes and it was pure bliss; nothing is more soothing than water. Harry pulled his head from the water and turned off the tap, he reached for a towel and really hoped Draco hadn’t already used it, Harry decided to risk it, he doubted Draco used a towel more than once.
“What do you mean?” asked Neville, his mouth had gone very dry. He could feel Ron’s anger increase every time Harry laughed.
“The big jump in his grades was suspicious.”
“You’re in luck then boys,” she beamed with delight, and had an aura of confidence, Lucius and Snape looked at each other and then to her. “I know where my dear cousin is, he wants to see Harry these Christmas holidays, so I took down his apparation address and promised to bring Harry around sometime soon. We can do both, allow Harry to visit him and then get him away for a while.”
Harry wished the fat woman in front of him would move so he could read the golden plaque, which he could only see the corner of.
It stuck in his head and he refused to use knowledge James had given him. It infuriated him. He wanted to scream and shout, cursing James’s name as loud as he could.
“I did!” said Arthur, laughing. “It adds to the story. As I was saying, the land was full of magical creatures and when our ancestor discovered them, he began to cater to them, helping them and whatnot. The forest was full of Muggle things – half completed houses, some furniture, even a few early designs of what Muggles use now. It was like they had tried to settle in the forest.”
“Bad idea,” said Draco, sighing.
Hermione stepped out of the bush, gently picking the bits of leaves and branch off her. “How did he know I was here?”
“Oh, there was a motive,” said Harry. “The motive was to help his sick child, a child who is dying and will most likely not live to see sixteen – Bernard knows this, hence why he took drastic measures to scrape up the money to pay for more treatment.”
“Cannot even deal with a few conjured birds, Longbottom? Pathetic.”
Ron was cut off by Harry’s yelling, “HERMIONE?”
“Hey Pans, what exactly are they doing?”
“Of course not,” said Lucius. “
Fred opened his box and it vanished, “funny, Harry.” Fred frowned.
Severus remained quiet.
“That is unfortunate to hear,” said Albus, pausing for a moment. “It hardly matters now, of course. However, Mr Potter, do you notice anything off with the Inferi? If you read the book as thoroughly as I am sure you did, it should be quite obvious.”
“Nothing,” said Harry. “It quite simply allows you to calm down and be more in control of your emotions. A Seer is a natural Occlumens, which means that no one can get anything from their mind as it’s protected by their magic. It’s all very complicated, but once you hit a certain mental state, it all becomes very clear.”
“No time, I have to speak to Hermione and then Remus, who I heard you gave a job back to, I’m thankful for that Dumbledore.” Harry smiled and left, he stopped just outside the corner and listened in, he missed the first part of the discussion, but it sounded like Dumbledore and the Sorting Hat.
“Thank you for letting me know that I was required to leave, wouldn’t wand Madam Pince coming after me.”
“At first you were rather timid and shy of the Slytherins, but you at least attempted to speak to them,” said Draco, his face set in an almost stone-like look. “Now you avoid them, not just them, but everyone, and scowl at anyone who even dares to try and start a conversation with you. When was the last time that you helped Rosier or Theo with their homework? You know how clueless at some subjects they are.”
“Well –”
Harry paused mid flick as he heard Hermione granger scold Weasley for the incorrect incantation. He smirked and focused back onto his feather, hoping that something exciting would come out of their argument.
Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin stirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly open, and slept on.
Christmas came and went without much fanfare by the occupants of the castle. Decorations had been strewn all over the bare stone walls of the castle to breathe some Christmassy life into the castle, shielding the occupants from the harsh, desolate aura of the Dementors.
“Doesn’t matter,” Gemma waved him off and scrawled a note. “This should cover you, here, I’ll walk you so you don’t get detention for skiving.”
“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic – it’s logic – a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here for ever.”
“Indeed,” said Harry, suspicion filling his green eyes. “I swear that I saw her walking around that night… looking panicked and generally filled with regret.”
“This is amazing,” breathed Lily, staring in awe. “I have never seen anything like this before.”
A few hours later, Harry found himself in the garden, sitting under a tree that gave shade to a vast majority of the garden. His hands, as if on autopilot, sought out a weed and pulled it from the garden, tossing it towards the ever-growing pile to his right. He actually enjoyed gardening, despite all belief, it was fun and it was relaxing. When he told his aunt that he was going out to do some weeding, she glanced at him like he had three heads.
Shaking, Neville moved three spaces to the left.
“I don’t actually attend this school, so you cannot give me a detention,” said Harry. “Even if did attend this school, I wouldn’t go because you cannot give me a detention when I did nothing wrong.”
Neville, who was dazed by the searing pain in his arm, slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side. The Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time aiming at his face. He swerved out of the way, one simple idea was lodged in his brain, and that was to get to Malfoy. Through a haze of rain and pain he sped towards the Snitch, was hovering just behind Malfoy, who had begun to search for it.
“Y-Yes, I g-guess we should g-go back n-now.” Harry sobbed, he wiped his eyes on his shirt and forced a smile.
“I don’t doubt that,” said Narcissa, gesturing towards the cupboard. “Would you kindly fetch the chessboard, Draco?”
“What about you?”
“Hello Snape, Draco would like to explain what he has done wrong.” Pansy said and shoved Draco in, smiled and left.
“I’m not following,” muttered Harry. “You can just bite humans to make an almost infinite supply of vampires.”
Chapter revised:
“Of course you don’t
Fred forced Neville to begin walking forwards. “Oh look, there’s Potter!” he released Neville and hurried towards Harry. “I think you’re the shortest second-year I have ever seen, you’re almost half a head shorter than Neville.”
She was both intimidated and excited about the potential outcome of what they were doing. She also hated how calm Potter was when she knew what they were going to do. They would both remain quiet and never tattle, but it was still thrilling.
“You sorted Salazar?” asked Harry in an equally soft voice. “That makes no sense as you were created by him.”
“Can you believe him?” roared Ron, as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.
“Gee thanks,” said Harry, rolling his eyes. “Lucius Malfoy. I actually know him, so that doesn’t surprise me. He’s well-known for being charitable –”
Grexle didn’t dare respond to the taunts. He instead charged at the wizard with a burst of anger and some kind of deep hatred for the entire wizarding kind. He jabbed his spear in every direction. He spun and spun, hoping that he would clip the wizard.
“Rosier, Damien!” called Professor McGonagall.
“I am perfect and don’t make mistakes.”
“And what about elective classes?”
“Many of us embrace magic,” said Lily. “We embrace it by practising it every day of our lives, always honing it. Nothing about any study has proven ley lines to exist.”
Myrtle looked delighted as she watched the boy retreat.
“What?” said Myrtle sulkily.
Lily sighed. “As for what’s happened to him, it may be wise to take him to St. Mungo’s.”
“And?”
“That is enough, Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “You may go, Mr. Flint. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, take your seats.”
“That still makes no sense, Potter,” said Hermione.
“Okay, bad choice of words, but you get the point,” said Harry. “They’re trying to make sure that they stay in my good graces for if they ever want to go into professional Quidditch.”
Ron stepped forward, “and who is NBM, DLM, LM and HJP?”
?” hissed Harry, confused. He repeated it a few times and was still in the same position as before. “
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. He was aware that everyone was looking at him, waiting to see what he would do. “At least one of you has manners,” he said, ignoring the bitter taste that he imaged that was filling his mouth as he shook Percy’s hand. “The nice manners are a shock, actually. Maybe you should ask Percy for some aid, Ronald, maybe then you would earn a bonus Sickle at your future job at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, collecting the dishes. Such manners would go a very, very long way.”
He would have to call her back soon. Or send a house-elf to collect her. The sun was setting, and it wouldn’t be long until they ran out of time. He didn’t much care about leaving James’s remains out for the night - what could befall someone already long dead? His mother, on the other hand…
bad, was he?
He’d just need to figure out what to do next, and hopefully he would figure out something better than renting a flat somewhere and sleeping for a year.
“Ron, stop being silly,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “I think Professor Dumbledore kept as much as he could from being commonly known. I suppose if he hadn’t, the Ministry would have attempted interfering in school affairs much earlier. Especially when the situation with Ginny was already so awful at the time…”
“This could be Taernsby Cottage, then,” Harry said. “What do you think?”
“Family can be… difficult,” Hermione responded, sounding hesitant and upset. “You know my… I mean, Hogwarts is about to start again, and I just… I was supposed to already be on my way to Australia. No, actually, I was supposed to have been there and back by now, really. But I haven’t even left yet, and I keep pushing it, because… I’m scared of what comes after. What if their life now is better than what it used to be here, with me? You went back to the Dursleys and got disappointed. I’m scared of going back to my own parents at all, because I don’t want to get disappointed as well.”
“Come on, Flint,” one boy screeched, his fists clenched together. “All the bragging you did about what your dad taught you…”
“A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years,” said Tom softly, softer than he was speaking just moments ago. He pointed towards the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary.
“So,” drawled Narcissa, her eyes landed on the little boy in Lily’s arms. “What’s his name, haven’t heard much about him.”
“Because your great-great-great-great grandfather married his own sister instead of a half-blood.”
“Wait sir, since when did you start calling me Harry? Not that I’m complaining.”
gleamed under the Gryffindors’ noses in the sun.
“I have friends Harry, you’re one of them.” Hermione shook her head, sometimes she wondered if Harry secretly knew Legilimency.
“Hi Ronald, I’m great actually. Being able to fly and go through walls is actually rather fun.” Harry turned to Hermione and shot her a smile. Hermione attempted to hug Harry, but just fell through him.
“With your freaky magic?” said Petunia, her lips forming into a fine line. “No offence, Harry, but I doubt you’ve ever scrubbed a floor in your life.”
“Anger does no one any good.” Lucius said bitterly.
doing in here?”
“How much did you pay for the quill?” said Harry, thinking. “Because, I will not feel right about shortchanging a store owner, especially one as kind as you.”
“It was a joke,” said James.
“Same.”
Another one of Lucius’ policies. He would give you the location of an item, but not the description or general appearance of it. You didn’t get into influential positions by being open about everything. Harry knew that Lucius held so much sway over the Minister simply because he was made go on wild goose chases and Lucius would always be there in the end to help him. A trap within a trap. “Thank you, Lucius.”
Lifting up and placing down books is what he had spent the next ten minutes doing, especially around Longbottom’s area. Of course he had a huge feeling that the book wasn’t here and his plans were ruined before he had even started. For a brief moment he thought about how Weasley acted, she was suspicious for most of this year, looking rather sickly, and her eyes mostly vacant of emotion. He pondered it as he dug around the dormitory, his hunt proving to be less than successful, in fact the only highlight was that couple arguing.
“Perhaps,” said Harry, unsure on who actually spoke. “If I’m not fond of my own abilities or have no confidence in them, how can you trust me? A lot of you call yourselves the best in your field at Quidditch and the fact that you’re so certain about it leads me to believe it.”
“I am!” said James. “No one will ever forget that betrayal.”
“What do we do?”
Harry, having fled the dining room, made it to his bedroom in record speed. He placed the letters on his desk, trying to fit them in somewhere without leaving them scattered all over the tabletop. He wasn’t a neat freak like some, but he did dislike meaningless clutter that only served to take up space.
“Here you are being, Young Master. If you being needing anything, anything at all, then you being calling Visy, and Visy will come,” said Visy, beaming up at the wizard. She vanished soon after with a soft crack.
“No, Harry, that isn’t it,” said James softly. “Let’s not do this here, Harry,” he reached out for his son and frowned when his son recoiled from him.
“Nothing taken was particularly expensive or rare,” said Severus with his usual tone of voice. “In fact most of them wouldn’t be used and would have to be thrown out or used within two months regardless. There was one ingredient taken though that I am concerned about.”
He listened as Professor Burbage did the roll, his ears perking up at some of the names, especially Granger’s, who wasn’t here yet. He was rather curious on the fact that Granger actually attended this class and wasn’t doing what he was.
“Does not explain your earliness.”
“They all went where you would assume,” said Atieno. “Same spells, different names. The Lore of Life is mostly made up of Healing, Protection, and spells that aid in growing and extending life. The Lore of Death is Necromancy, Vampiric Magic, and anything that relates to death. The Lore of Dark is the one that got the most shattered over time and became a small sample of what it used to be. It is now mostly Dark Arts. The Lore of Light is essentially another version of Lore of Life, except more focused on spells that replicate light and create radiance.”
“No, Harry,” Snape sighed, “the Dark Lord had no intention of killing anyone that night at your house, his goal was to recruit your mother and father and then raise you as his heir. He was going to feign death and then rise with you when you turned seventeen, the Dark Lord knew your father didn’t receive the power and he would have made you do evil things to get that power, he would have made you kill your parents for the power. Your mother was strong though, she used all hers and James power to protect you and the Dark Lord vanquished himself attacking you, he foolishly killed James and Lily making you the last Potter heir, therefor untouchable until you were eighteen. You know the rest, his own stupidness was his own downfall, but he did have all intentions to raise you under his wing. The issue is the fact you absorbed his power, whenever you kill someone, you absorb their powers.”
“No, Granger, I don’t feel sorry that I seemed to hurt your feelings,” sneered Harry. “Must you take things so seriously? What I said to you was hardly offensive nor should you have been offended by a word that you didn’t even understand.”
He glanced downward, studying the dark blue line that was slowly leading him into an unknown direction. He studied the intricate white scribbles inside of the darker blue line, curious about why the line needed a pattern. It was not until he blinked that he realised the white scribbles were not scribbles at all, they were forming the same word over and over.
“The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal,” said Harry as if he had been reading directly from the book. He paused and wondered why he suddenly knew everything that he had read before about Nicolas Flamel, he had read about the man in one of his more boring nights studying.
“You’ll see him in the morning, Draco, let him rest. A full night’s sleep should do him some good,” said Narcissa. “How about we play a quick game of chess while we wait for your father to return from work?”
He blinked when he felt the train jerk and then a loud whistle. He wanted to sigh in relief and mutter about the fact that the train had finally left, but it looked like no one else shared his desire to leave the station. Something about the situation with the trains colliding felt wrong to him and he had no idea how to word it.
It had been the reason why his parents had kept him away from the world outside after all: they’d told him that if anyone found out about the things he could do, they’d take him and never bring him back. And when he’d asked if what was
managing to keep his fear at bay now. He didn’t know what he was supposed to do, only that he wasn’t supposed to be
“I’ve already asked him to spend time with me,” Harry interrupted. “I mean, I said I’d tell him about all the things we did at Hogwarts. I didn’t… I just wanted to be his friend, then. It’s changed quickly.”
"Who is he?" Harry asked, frowning.
“Aren’t sirens water-bound?” Harry asked, confused. “Aren’t they the singing water creatures that lure people to their deaths? Switzerland doesn’t border a body of water, right? Why would they—”
looked like, was grateful.
Harry remained silent, though the words stung a bit. His necromancy wasn’t
“Y-yes Master?” the thing croaked.
Unlike the Imperius Curse, Harry couldn’t find much to like about this one. Again - where was the fun in causing someone pain?
”Maybe he’s in shock,” Ron said. ”Ginny, after her first year, she... well, she spent nearly the entire summer barely responding to anyone.”
The cadaver smiled back, its black eyes fixed on Harry.
“Yes.”

“The Unforgivables,” Harry realized, having heard of the curses before, but hadn’t really read anything specifically about them.
“Britain’s magical heritage centers around sacrifice and summoning, though they won’t readily admit that,” Antonin explained. “It’s why there are so many strange creatures here, and also why the rules to control wizards and witches are so elaborate - they developed alongside the need for them. This applies largely on the whole of Europe, not just Britain. If you find yourself interested, you should read about the Sirens of Switzerland.”
But… at least he didn’t need to stay with Lily. He couldn’t yet leave Mordred’s Mend whenever he wanted to, and so these sessions, regardless of how useless he found them, did provide him with something he otherwise wouldn’t have had. And while this kind of avoidance wasn’t really a
“How about you tell me a bit about yourself,” Healer Crabbe then said. “Say anything that comes to mind, and do not worry over how you’re saying it. Like I said - anything you say here will remain a secret.”
Bellatrix kneeled in front of him, to get to his eyelevel. She then poked the corners of his eyes with her sharp nails and said: “don’t trust these.”
It was
Sleeping where, now?
Harry really enjoyed meeting Ron and Hermione at different muggle coffee shops. People never stared at him, and though the food was often dry, the tea just all right, and prices high, none of that made the experience any worse. It helped, also, that Hermione would come up with different coffee shops for them to visit every time.
Harry knew that the Dursleys had already been moved back. Their temporary relocation had been chalked up to the house being renovated, which had been provided for them to make the story more believable. Harry had been told by Arthur that the Dursleys had been very satisfied with the house, which was hard for him to imagine. He hadn’t ever seen them satisfied with anything, as long as he was still around.
This turned out for the best, as soon after the sound of her loud footsteps disappeared, Harry felt... strange. Anxious, though that was to be expected, given the circumstances. He didn't dare to peek from under the bed, but did his best to hear every little sound around him. It didn't take long for him to realize that after having run away so loudly, Lily had then returned - quietly, so quietly - back to stand in the corridor outside Harry's room. She didn't come in this time, and Harry was sure that she was waiting for him to come out.
”It’s all right,” Harry replied. ”It may be better for everyone to wait until the house is done, before visiting. Just to make it a nice surprise.”

Uncle Tony had sent him an owl earlier today, saying that he’d introduce Harry to a therapist. A therapist! Wasn’t it his mother who needed one and not him? He’d read about therapists too - what would they be able to do anyway? He wasn’t crazy, and no amount of talking to some stranger was going to change the House. Or change Harry.
? Harry didn’t think so, but what could be worse than what she was like now anyway? If he just left her out overnight… what would happen? Would Harry open the door for her in the morning? Would he dare to, or would that be allowing the Woods in? Was whatever lurked in there just hiding in the dark, watching and waiting for him to open a door or a window just a minute too early?
The lesson with Nott was draining, but interesting.
The darkness intensified as Harry walked, and strangely enough no matter which way he went, he could still hear the wailing. His skin was cold and wet though he

And yet… it was Bellatrix whose input made Harry feel alive.

”Right,” Nettlewick said, somehow sounding both positive and judgmental at the same time. ”How about this - I’ll give you this portfolio of available houses, and you browse through them in peace. Then we set up the next appointment, and discuss the options you liked.”
“Some fool who’s already in your pocket?” Dolohov sneered. “They better have a thick skin and be able to handle the things a necromancer - no matter how inexperienced that necromancer is - will tell them. It’s only going to get worse as he grows up.”
”Sure,” Harry said, resisting the urge to mention how odd it felt to hear Malfoy speaking on a subject he apparently knew a lot about. Instead, he said: ”It’s funny to see goblins here. Usually I see them only working at banks.”
”Yes,” Malfoy confirmed. ”In two weeks. I’ll send you the details in a couple of days.”
“Nott recommended him,” Uncle Tony told Harry, as if Crabbe hadn’t spoken. “And you seem to like Nott well enough.”
Harry was careful to not show any of his scepticism. The barely contained anger that oozed out of Bellatrix wouldn’t be tolerant of disagreements - especially disagreements concerning her precious Dark Lord. Harry was certain of that, and he didn’t want to test it. She reminded him of the Woods. Their silent and dark hunger, barely containing itself within its physical boundaries, ready to lash out and devour anything it could reach.
“You were talking with goblins,” Harry replied. “I didn’t want to interrupt.”
was worse than what was
“I need a proof of his powers,” Nott shot back. “I don’t know what he’s capable of, do I? What has he done to convince you?”
”The floors and the pipes are fine, but the walls will be painted white,” Malfoy said, leading him into the house where a team of five goblins were already working. ”The fireplace will be redone and then connected to the Floo Network, if that’s what you’d like.”
“I don’t know what you need,” Malfoy told him, looking unsure. “It’s just… taste.”
“Caspar,” Uncle Tony then said, “I don’t need to tell you what will happen if the boy is harmed in any way. I might not much care for children in general, but he’s a bit different.”
Why? He didn't know.
Harry thought, now paying attention to the large box that had been in the room before them. From the corner of his eye he could see that the doorway was empty. Similarly, there was no one hanging from the ceiling.
”I thought you’d want to live near the Weasleys,” Malfoy then said. ”Or Hogsmeade, near Hogwarts.”
“Why is it an unforgivable?” Harry asked, almost frantic. He’d never heard of a spell so perfect, and here Uncle Tony was telling him that using it would come with a prison sentence!
Bellatrix – who had told him twice to call her Bella, but Harry simply couldn’t – led him through the chapel, letting out a cackle as she walked past the seats and towards a large door in the back. Harry ran after her, seeing no one else but
Luckily, Lily didn't search for him.
Vurney startled, before shakily replying: “M-master’s mother is in her room.”
Not the... heavy weariness inside of him:
Harry sat on the large white couch, too aware of the seams of his clothes and the topmost button of his shirt. The faint hum of a lullaby clung to him like a scent, though he doubted anyone else could hear it. He felt suffocated and anxious, and worst of all - even a bit disoriented. It was becoming harder and harder to make sense of things amid the strange events unfolding in his life, let alone try and figure out how
when his
”I think that’s good,” Ginny said encouragingly. ”Neville told me that tending to the garden he has at home helps him stay productive and feel better. Maybe fixing up the house - well, as much as Malfoy will let you - will do some good for you.”
It didn’t seem believable, and even after he held back the assessment wand, the thought that anyone could – just from that – somehow figure out what kind of a wand would be perfect for him… it just didn’t seem possible.
Harry hated nausea more than pain. Pain he could put up with, pain he could control and ignore. But nausea? It turned his insides and scrambled his head, making him too weak to even move. It made him stumble and lose awareness of what was surrounding him. It made him vulnerable, and
“Nah,” Harry said. “Whatever you want to do is fine.” Having done so well so far, Harry doubted that Malfoy would deliberately try to ruin it all now. Besdies, Harry was curious to see what kind of a taste Malfoy really had. Could he even do something homey and cozy?
“Oh.”
Well, liked him enough to not tell him about the faces in the ceiling of his office, anyway.
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, head spinning. He didn’t want Healer Crabbe to think he was dumb, but he didn’t understand most of the things the man had just talked about.
It felt
”Gringotts is experiencing struggles in recruitment for some reason,” Malfoy said, and Harry wondered fleetingly if he was aware of the whole dragon thing that had taken place during the war. ”They’re good at this sort of work, and so I chose to hire them instead of... people. There will be some things that have to be done by either you or I, however.”
Uncle Tony let out an angry hiss, before he turned on his heels, visibly forcing himself to remain calm as he noticed Harry again. He then, watching Harry, said:
Fucking great.
”Too many neighbours,” Harry said. ”And too many memories, I guess.” And though he loved the Weasleys greatly, he just couldn’t stop blaming himself for the deaths of George and Fred. He didn’t know how Molly could stand to look at him with no anger. He didn’t know
Feeling tendrils of excitement, Harry did as told. He had barely managed to get a hold of the stick, before they were spinning away, into a city he had never even heard of before. The thought that by the time he’d return here, he’d have his wand, gave him an immense feeling of relief. A relief that only deepened when they reached their destination, and Harry found himself standing right outside what appeared to be a wall surrounding the town.
in the
There was something about the Burrow that felt like a hug. It was easy to just sink down into a warm, soft bed and sleep for ages. It was two hours before a late Monday dinner when Harry decided to take a nap. A part of him really wanted to simply sleep, while another part didn’t want to be confronted with Hermione’s concerned looks and questions. Ron was, strangely enough, better at balancing being available and not smothering him, and Harry hoped for Hermione to follow his example soon.
“Dumbledore keeping secrets isn’t new, that’s for sure,” Harry said, expecting to feel a familiar pang of resentment. He was surprised by its absence, however, and briefly wondered if he was actually moving on. It didn’t seem possible.
Harry nodded, hoping that Nott would be able to teach him more than just the theory of these activation and deactivation words. He hadn’t needed any before, so… how could he apply them now, belatedly?
”But it’s Malfoy,” Ron argued. ”Can you trust him to not somehow, I don’t know, do something?”
He couldn’t dwell on those thoughts, and so Harry had decided to move. He had worn the same pair of trousers, the hoodie, and sneakers that Hermione had bought for him a while ago. He knew he looked like a muggle, but did it matter when he was so recognizable otherwise?
…returned to
“I’m not interrupting, I hope,” Uncle Tony said. Lily startled, and whirled in the pantry to turn and take a peek at who had joined her in the kitchen. She smiled when she saw who it was.
“Oh come on, he’s likely struggling with things on his own, too,” Hermione argued. “Not that the backlash isn’t justified, but the Malfoys lost quite a bit in the aftermath. He’s now essentially trying to not just maintian his family’s responsibilities, but fix their name as well.”
Was Lily still grieving, or was this something else?
“Okay,” Harry said again, not doubting her. He wasn’t sure what absence of hesitation really was, though, and it worried him a little. What if he just wasn’t good enough? He didn’t want to end up in a well somewhere - especially considering that aside from Uncle Tony, it wasn’t as if anyone else would actually search for him.
”Do you think people will believe him?” Harry wondered. ”I know that his trial went quite well since he hadn’t been entirely willing. But... he wasn’t exactly innocent either.”
Resentment, deep and dark and angry, splashed inside of him. It felt simultaneously like a deep, bone-rattling ocean of rage, and a small, barely blooming little flower inside of him.
“And you are certain that that is his wand,” Uncle Tony then said. Harry’s fingers tightened around his wand, and he knew that it was his. He didn’t care if it wasn’t suitable for dark magic, or if it stood for things that he couldn’t possibly have – peace and friendship, of all things. He didn’t
”Potter,” Malfoy snapped, clearly struggling to not follow that up with an insult. When he continued, he sounded unintentionally defensive: ”I’m here to sell a cottage my family no longer has a need for.”
”We all will!” Hermione said enthusiastically, before turning to Harry and Ron. ”Won’t we?”
“Oh, Potter, hexing someone at Hogwarts—”
, if only he’d brought matches or
“I have a question,” Harry said. “If I can re-animate the body, and summon the soul… then why can’t I just bring the person back?”
Nott sighed, his wide smile becoming something smaller, softer. He looked down at the cadaver on the table, fingertips gliding lightly over the contours of its face. “This one was June,” he said out of nowhere. “She feared death just like anyone else, but remains unaware of the fate of her remains now. People fear that loss of awareness - the thought of no longer being a conscious, thinking creature is unbearable, because… of all the things you will no longer have. And the animal desire to survive - to live on and see another day - is powerful.”
Things hadn’t been this bad at first. Not long ago his father had been alive and his mother had been aware and when the dark had become darker, he had been able to rest knowing his parents would be there for him. But then his father had
“How’s his work with the cottage, anyway?” Ron asked. “Still as good as you said he was when he started?”
He didn’t even know what it’d be like. Only that it’d have to be vastly different than what he had now.
”Not really,” Harry replied with a shrug. ”I’m feeling better now than I did two months ago, but... I don’t want to... I’ll just focus on the house for now.”
”I wanted to come and see this place one more time,” Harry said with a shrug. ”I told you, closure. You hate magic, but I’m grateful for it - it got me away from here.”
Harry hadn’t questioned that either. He had simply sat down to read about magical theory until his eyes burned, practiced pronouncing spells he couldn’t cast yet until his throat was sore, and memorized plants and ingredients until his head hurt. Back then he’d though he would love nothing more than for those lessons to end, but now even after his mother no longer cared enough to teach him, he sought comfort and familiarity in the routine of reading.
Crabbe nodded, looking pleased already, though Harry didn’t think he’d said anything for the man to be happy about. “Good,” Crabbe said. “Your godfather told me you study a lot. How have those lessons been?”
"Yes," Bellatrix said sourly. "That little vermin. Him and his parents - they'll be the first to go, I promise you. And oh, it will be painful. I will make it painful for them. There are scores waiting to be settled."
”Well, there will be no neighbours here,” Malfoy said. ”Once the fireplace has been connected, you can name the place. In two weeks the renovations will be almost finished, and the only things missing will be some small details that I’ll need your input for.”
It was… exciting.
They. The twins, and their shop in Diagon Alley. It made sense, in a way, for Ron to take over it.
with him for some light. He’d always wanted a source of light for him to rely on, and yet now he had
it made him feel. As if a cavity inside of him had been filled, and the aching pain from it was fading fast.
“Is it? Is it really?”
”We’re staying at the Burrow,” Hermione explained, reaching to hold Ron’s hand. ”There’s quite a bit to do there, too. Everywhere, really.”
”What about Mrs. Malfoy?”
His home was here.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Harry said, “you could get to know me, if you wanted.”
creature can tell that there’s something different about you,” Nott said. “But whether or not they can tell what it is… I suppose it depends on whether they’ve encountered a necromancer before or not, and if they still remember that feeling well enough to identify it now. You’ve noticed how house-elves act around you, haven’t you? And that portraits tend to leave their frames whenever you’re near? There’s something deeply unsettling about you to any creature that is more aware than mere human beings are. Even wizards more attuned to death, such as myself, can tell that there’s something about you that is interesting.”
He hoped it was a coincidence. He hoped that the limb had fallen off the rotten corpse as it shuffled after Lily. Because if that wasn’t the case, it meant that for some reason James’s corpse had come to stand outside Harry’s closed door overnight, and that just… that was
“No,” Harry replied immediately. Kitchens were no good, he didn’t like kitchens. Lily used to hang out a lot in the kitchen, even after James’s death, and Harry just couldn’t feel comfortable in one. Living rooms were no good either - they were too… too central. “Office is good.”
odd. His glasses went a long way in distracting people from his strange eyes, and the way he dressed spoke only subtly of his wealth and status. He wasn’t aggressive, gloomy, or unpleasant, but neither was he chipper or welcoming. His face was often a mask of polite indifference, with a hint of a smile fading in and out of existence. There was nothing alarming about him, and yet—
He didn’t know when the words tumbling out of his mouth changed. When
”A cottage?” Harry asked, interested. A cottage sounded nice. ”What kind of a cottage? I’m looking to buy a house, you see.”
“It’s a good taste,” Harry replied, not knowing what else to say, and not really seeing an issue there.
“I’m not lying,” Harry insisted, still smiling. There was sunlight coming in through the window and warming up his back and the nape of his neck, and he fleetingly thought of all the early mornings he could have here on his own. “I can— I don’t have a pensieve right now at hand, but I could show you when I get one? There’s so much— I’ve ridden a centaur, did you know? And saw inferi up-close, too. And—”
“I do not know what makes you doubt,” the witch said, “but rest assured, I know what I’m doing. That’s why you’re here.”
happened only on Saturdays. His Uncle Tony existed from Saturday to Saturday, as far as Harry was concerned, and while he appreciated the few hours he could spend with his godfather, it just… it just wasn’t
“Isn’t that good enough, for now?” Ron asked. “If you two will already be meeting for other purposes aside from fixing up the cottage, won’t that be giving you more time to sort out your thoughts?”
“He won’t be showing off to anyone,” Uncle Tony said. “The whole
And hajjah is a feminine term to a muslim person who has done the Hajj. I thought it would be a nice detail to throw in there, because Dolohov is a man of culture. At first I had him say “madame” but in Libya that’s not a common way to refer to anyone.
Turning where he stood felt harder than it should have been. Harry’s entire body felt heavy, and there was a terrible ache in his right arm. But now he could see Ron and Hermione, running towards him, each from a different direction. Hadn’t they been together earlier? No? He could see them better if he mustered up the energy to wipe his glasses clean. His glasses. Miraculously, they had survived the whole ordeal - had someone cast some sort of an unbreakable charm on them? Because back in the day - years and years ago, before castles and snakes and fear and body counts - Dudley had been able to break Harry’s glasses with a punch. And he had done so, often.
— He didn’t want to hope too much, but he couldn’t
, and no one could make him feel like he didn’t belong. He had grown up here, and didn’t have a single memory of the other house his parents said they’d lived in before - somewhere in Godric’s Hollow, apparently. Lily had spoken so highly of the place, and so had James.
“That is to ensure the continuation of your control even if you happen to fall unconscious. For example you’re in a battle and you have a few corpses guarding something important. Then you get knocked out. If the deactivation spell has not been said, the corpses will keep guarding their treasure.”
Antonin wasn’t sure if the boy had ever been to Diagon Alley, and he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to go there. “While many do choose to purchase their school supplies from the many stores of Diagon Alley, it is likely that we’ll only go there for your books. The other equipment, such as wand and robes, we’ll be getting from elsewhere. It is of great importance to value craftmanship in even the smallest of details, and there aren’t many capable of delivering that here. There are some in Russia, of course, and some more scattered across Asia and Africa. Each region has things they specialize in even if their expertise encompasses all elements of magic, purely due to how living conditions have shaped their heritage throughout the times. To learn herbology or healing, I’d have taken you to parts of Asia. For runes, I’d have taken you to South America. For your wand? That’ll be the Arabs - particularly the ones in central North Africa.”
“—and look,” the man said, pointing at the patches of skin still hanging on to the cadaver. “Touch it. The give of the skin is different from the fresh ones, you see? So if you want to keep a body going, you’ll have to nourish it. Just getting it up and running isn’t enough. Now look, this other one - she's
"You're still soft, baby necromancer," she cooed, petting his hair gently, though Harry knew better than to take her words as compliments. "Most of that hesitation can be trained away, but it's so hard to do when that ridiculous godfather of yours hasn't even gotten you a practice wand yet. Maybe I should get you one - that'll show him!"
He couldn’t stop thinking about school.
“Something is wrong with your mother,” Uncle Tony said immediately, and something about the way he said it made a lump form in Harry’s throat. He swallowed, eyes burning. “What happened? Did she do anything to you?”
As they left, Harry’s thoughts returned to McGonagall’s offer. Perhaps he should accept it, and come back to study. It was just… he could barely muster up the will to speak these days, how on earth was he going to feel motivated enough to
”Do you still meet Malfoy every time you go there?” Ron asked, making a face. ”That miserable little ferret.”
And Harry, who knew what

Harry wasn't entirely sure what to expect from his sessions with Bellatrix, the witch never telling him in advance what she had planned. She had started out with meditation a long time ago, and over the span of the months they'd spent, she'd discussed politics and weaponry and even healing with him from time to time. This time, she seemed to have something new and exciting in mind.
Of what his parents had told him about Hogwarts – and the Gryffindor House in particular – etiquette had never really been mentioned. They’d spoken to him about Quidditch and the library and lessons and the Hospital Wing, but never about
“Good luck with that,” Harry muttered, immediately feeling guilty afterwards. He was getting along well with Malfoy, and talking ill about him didn’t seem as fine to do as it used to be. Besides, Hermione was right, and it was fairly easy to see that Malfoy was struggling with his own demons as well.
“In theory, it sounds possible,” Nott said dryly. “But how would you attach the soul back to the body? It has never been done before. At any case, you won’t be doing anything with souls until you learn the basics of body preservation at least.”
When his dad had died and Harry had brought him back, things had gotten worse in the House. The
”Unlikely,” Ginny said. ”I doubt that he’ll be in a hurry to ever go back there. Not after everything he did. From what I understood, he has to deal with family issues now. And for a family with no upcoming funerals, they have a remarkable number of skeletons in their closets.”
”That’s... I understand.” And he did, even though his relatives were the way they were. Ah, the Dursleys. Should he go back to Privet Drive? Just one more time to... to... say goodbye, or something. Make sure he had left nothing behind.
”Fine,” Ron said, ”but if Malfoy gives you a tough time...”
“I was hiding,” Harry replied. “She didn’t find me - didn’t look for me. But she came to stand by my bed for ages and then hid to wait by the door. I don’t— I don’t know what’s going on.”
. How he hasn’t lost his mind yet is a mystery.”
Lullabies in this chapter = not by me! The first one is an old Russian lullaby called "Bayu Bayushki Bayu". The second one is "Come Little Children" from Hocus Pocus.
”Wow, you really haven’t changed,” Harry observed. In the past, that would have made him pull out his wand and send a hex or two, but Merlin, he just couldn’t be arsed. ”I’m not dating Ginny. I’m looking for a small house for myself. Is that cottage for sale or not?”
”But it’s Malfoy,” Ron insisted. ”He’s a prick!”
One of the things that he had liked about the cottage, was a bench not far from the house. A bench surrounded by shrubbery and small, colourful flowers that Harry couldn’t name. There was no stream or a lake nearby to complete the picture, and no birds were there to add sound to the summer days, but the landscape that he could see from that bench was breathaking in its own right: vast fields of even greenery, hills going up and down as far as the eye could see. No neighbours in sight. No man-made roads, either. No car could reach him, and if anyone flew on a broomstick this way, he’d see them coming well before they could reach him.
“When will we go buy my school things?” Harry then asked, changing the subject entirely. “I need a wand.”
“No,” Harry confirmed, remembering with clarity that there had been no words involved – only a desperate wish. “Nothing.”
”No, don’t take him to the Great Hall,” someone said, and Harry felt a wave of relief wash over him when he realized it to be Professor McGonagall. ”The hospital wing is full as well. Take him to my office. You know the way, Miss Granger. The password is feather duster.”
he? What was wrong with him?
”I don’t want to think about it right now,” Ginny interrupted, mustering up an apologetic smile. ”I’m really not thinking about any of that.”
, of course he had hoped to somehow do this– but sometimes it had felt like such an
. To bring his dad back.
'I wonder what kind of jinxes would actually help me make use of that,' Harry thought. Because surely if he flung a bombarda - one of his godfather's favourites - at someone, it would matter if he hit the nose or the neck, their head would be blown off regardless. Was there a jinx of some sort that was simply a punch? There had to be, right?
“It’s better now than it used to be.”
“He’s focused,” Antonin replied. “Though I’m surprised you’d even consider allowing a necromancer slip from your fingers like this.”
“Well, isn’t that also a chance for you?” Ron pointed out. “A chance to just throw your confession at him and then spend months apart just after. If it’s mutual, he’ll contact you, and if it’s not, well… at least you won’t have to see his face around.”
Harry nodded, “thank you, sir.” Harry was still playing with his fingers rather fidgety, he didn’t want to look around so he kept twisting and bending his fingers on his lap.
“The Goblet of Fire will announce its decision in twenty minutes,” said Dumbledore. “Until then, there are a few more things that need to be said. For each underage person that was caught trying to put their name into the Goblet, a deduction of fifty house points will be made. There were seven people from Gryffindor, three from Hufflepuff, six from Ravenclaw, and five from Slytherin. If my memory serves correctly, that means that each house is now at zero points.”
“He had me change the outcome of a Quidditch match, making the team that lost into the team that won, it took almost a year to do.”
Professor McGonagall stood silent for a moment, staring blankly at Neville Longbottom, before she snapped out of it and placed her hands on her hips. “Of course, of course,” she said, her eyes flicking between the two boys. “I realise that this has all been hardest on the friends of those attacked. I apologise, boys, for not thinking of this earlier. I saw Mr. Potter in the hospital wing a few days ago, and I wasn’t sure why and then I realised that he had struck up a friendship with Mr. Finch-Fletchley.”
“Speaking of Potter, did you see him?” said Ron, holding his stomach as he attempted to muffle his laughter. “He looked like he’d seen his worst fear –”
“Of course I don’t find your speeches boring, Albus. Yours are fascinating, unlike Snape’s, I fell asleep simply thinking about the last potions lesson we had, and he wonders why I’m almost failing potions, I’m asleep half the time, I bet he sabotages my cauldron while I’m asleep to.” Harry snorted, and put his head back down, closing his eyes.
He began pulling out his clothes for the day, seeing as he’d be going to school with Dudley. He bent down and shifted through his trunk, wondering what he could wear as he did so, a few shirts were shifted aside and he scowled, unsure of what the school’s uniform was, as he wasn’t even told. He pulled out a pair of black and green socks, the green covering the heel and toes, a pair of black slacks, which were pretty much the equivalent of Muggle suit pants, a white collared shirt and a pre-tied black tie. He folded them over his forearm and picked up his toothbrush and toothpaste and made for the bathroom.
Harry frowned and followed the headmaster’s wary gaze towards Nagini. He did notice that the headmaster looked as if the snake would attack him at any moment. “Nagini wouldn’t dare hurt anyone,” he said, not noticing the odd look on the headmaster’s face when he had mentioned Nagini’s name. “In the six years that I have had her, she hasn’t not once ever bitten someone or hurt anyone. She is allowed to slither around home without any sort of supervision and generally does fine. Mother can attest to this.”
“The arena is ready for you, wizard.”
Narcissa lowered her voice, “can I just ask why?”
“Maybe,” muttered Harry as he took a seat near Ernie, who was playing a Muggle card game with Justin. “I had an idea – one better than whatever Nott’s trying to do. Why don’t we unite all the Houses together, besides Gryffindor, and then take over? We could create a minor rebellion and oust Nott.”
“Be quiet!” Harry hissed at the blond. “After that many shots I couldn’t see very straight and I though Draco was a pretty little blond – which he is anyway – and I began my amazing flirtation skills –”
“Oh Merlin!” Harry muttered and looked away from the letter sitting on the table.
“You’re right,” said Harry, waving her off. “Someone more talented, more aware was behind it. You can be coerced to put your name in the Goblet. Someone could have drugged him, cursed him, or whispered the right things. Who knows? Either way, we – Draco and I – were talking about previous tasks before I called you all over. I think we’ve found something…”
“I’ve read all about the Dark Arts,” said Hermione, lifting her nose. “Teaching it should be illegal –”
you came here every summer, with your... your freakishness and... and
“When the Dark Lord walked among us,” the woman said, “he commanded magic unlike anything you could imagine. He could raise an army of inferi with a single thought, and yield powers that surpassed death itself.”
“You want us to be friends.” The words were delivered with too much hesitation to sound like an actual statement. Regardless, Harry nodded.
Where were they?
“Okay,” said Harry. He hadn’t worried about telling Uncle Tony, and didn’t know if it mattered, really.
He did know of this Dark Lord that Lestrange kept bringing up. Voldemort. Harry was familiar with the story of how the First Wizarding War had ended, and how terrifying Voldemort had been. He hadn’t known that there were still people supporting that wizard, but clearly there were.
Malfoy was quite for a few moments, before he huffed in resignation. “It’s fine. The name isn’t horrible. Very obvious, and not exciting at all, but I guess that’s right up your alley, isn’t it?”
Harry woke up on Friday feeling sick.
“Only this once,” Lily relented with a sigh after a moment of contemplation. “But you have to find him first. I don’t think he went into the forest - he knows better than to trust the trees.”
“Let’s forget normal, then,” the witch said. “Let’s just figure out what makes us happy, and focus on that. And try to do the right thing whenever we have the strength for it.” She was nowhere near ready to tackle the issue with her parents, and Harry desperately wished that he could help her somehow. Make it easier for her to deal with.
The doors and windows were sealed shut at night, though whether it was to prevent the Woods from entering or the House from exiting, it was hard to tell. It certainly wasn’t a place that would allow for midnight wandering or late-night celebrations.
Uncle Tony looked pleased when he replied: “The unavoidable nature of an instant death is frightening to people, though I’m sure you’ll be told all about how
McGonagall nodded, then continued: ”I understand if any of you is apprehensive towards the concept of returning here, considering everything you went through. If, however, you’d like to come back, we will gladly accommodate you and provide the necessary education.”
. Most days he didn’t think the
”I’m fine,” Harry said in response. ”I just... I’m fine. I’m just really tired.”
”What about you, Harry?” Hermione asked. ”Do you have anything in mind for when the house is ready?”
“I’m not going to become an Auror,” Harry replied. “And it’s not like I’ve never done anything questionable either, you know that.” Why did people think that he was somehow an overly forgiving person? Harry knew he wasn’t - there were so many people he just couldn’t bring himself to forgive. He could never even consider forgiving Vernon and Petunia. Or Snape, despite the man having died while fighting against Voldemort to the very end. Or Dumbledore, even, for quite a few things.
And, and— he had a barrier there now. (What if it didn’t work?)
Nott nodded slowly, moving from the doorway to take a seat on the chair right next to Harry. He then looked at the boy intently, before nodding again. “I didn’t know the necromancer you spoke of would be so young,” Nott said. “How old are you, boy?”
“His secrets will be protected, there are vows and oaths of a thousand types—”
Harry watched her leave with a shocked expression. “I have never heard her speak so politely before,” he said to an equally shocked Pansy. “I spend almost ninety-nine perfect of my time here and I have never heard her say ‘please’ before.”
“PEEVES!” roared Filch. He flung down the quill he was holding and made a break for the door that lead out into the corridor. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have you!”
“Isn’t that right Harry?” They both said in unison.
“Ignore that Potter!” barked a woman off to the side before quickly shouting, “How old are you?”
Harry snorted and attempted to read on. He learned quite the facts, especially considering the fact that a lot of it was nothing more than wild theories and musings of what the man said during his one and only speech. Many believed that Ekrizdis was the reincarnation of Death and that his Patronus was a sign of that.
” = Parseltongue
,” said Salazar. “
“I understand,” said Nott, grabbing his wand from his pocket. “I understand one hundred percent, but I don’t agree with it and I don’t think you’re going to replace me, none of you.”
He glanced up at the estate, trying to get a better look, even as he pushed open the black iron gates, hoping that he wouldn’t get a nasty shock for doing it.
“Professor McGonagall had orders to turn any student away that asks due to pranks and such happening a few months earlier,” said Neville. “Someone told her that they found the Stone.”
“A sword can’t cut through a spell,” said Harry, scowling. “The impact alone would cause the sword to stop or be propelled backwards. Even a shield would struggle to continue to move against a spell.”
“Why would Harry just walk away? It makes very little sense,” said Draco and then sniffed slightly, the cold air pressing against his face was bringing on a flu or something. “I didn’t even see him leave, he just vanished.”
displeased,” said Harry, smirking. “His eldest son being kidnapped in Diagon Alley by Aurors that had no reasoning for doing as such. It was Tonks, wasn’t it?”
Minerva walked out of the room, she had plans for them, discreet plans that would prove that she was sorry and that time has moved on and now Hogwarts should show the correct house unity, the same house unity that once drove the best students from Hogwarts. It was a major conflict in her head, she did something special for each house. The Hufflepuff house received a room which held various plants, only for the Hufflepuff students. Gryffindor held various training rooms, including her massive chessboard from 1991. Ravenclaws got their own special library which was filled with books that could help their knowledge. Slytherin had nothing, nothing at all, she couldn’t think of something to do for them, everything that crossed her mind seemed wrong or just disrespectful to Slytherins in general.
Not even three minutes later Ronald Weasley walked in looking rather distraught and angry, with a small frown plastered on his slightly reddened face, clearly from venting or ranting to himself. “Sorry I’m late Dumbledore –”
“HARRY, GET UP YOU'LL BE LATE FOR THE TRAIN!” A voice shouted in the distance which sounded familiar, “honestly. We don't have all day! Get up.” The footsteps grew closer towards Harry’s room.
Harry let out a cold laugh, smirking. “I
“Everyone in?” the large man shouted, who had a boat to himself. “Right then – FORWARD!”
“Don’t laugh!”
Had he not been so determined to have a clean record, not a single detention to mar his record for Prefect and then Head Boy, he would have stood, flipped over a desk, and yelled at the disgruntled man for wasting his time. For a moment, when his mind slipped slightly, he thought that Moody was going to snap and begin throwing curses around. It would not be out of character if all the information he had was actually correct. Hot-headed, easily baited, reckless, and so much more negative traits for an Auror, yet he was still one of the best due to those traits. No Dark Wizard expected to be charged by a rampaging Auror. Combat was all strategy and planning, no matter the field. Alastor Moody ruined all of that by charging recklessly instead of keeping a distance. Effective, no doubt, but a very risky approach.
“No, it’s true, Cantankerus Nott wrote it and compiled it early on in his life. He produced an heir soon after as he felt that releasing it could threaten his life as a few knew that he wrote it. My father didn’t follow tradition and had me when he was older. When Cantankerus Nott passed away, everyone turned to us to update the book and continue the work of Cantankerus Nott, but my father didn’t want that kind of stigma on our family.” Theodore paused for the right words. “His beliefs were always pushed down onto our family, while we do agree with blood-purity, none of us have the energy to update the book and this offends a lot of people as the Weasleys should be removed as should the Ollivanders.”
, but they never did. Crying stopped easing the pain months ago. Every time I would try and open up, everyone else would go quiet or just tell me to be happy. My mum… my mum said she went through it, too, so I was hoping she could help me… she hasn’t. She doesn’t do anything. She sees me smiles now and then and thinks I’m better.
The soft discussion between father and son soon merged into a debate, one that had small jabs and petty insults tied into each word spoken. The whole situation was fragile and threatened to shatter at any given moment. The duo finally reached the top of the stairs and stopped directly in front of a portrait, who in Harry’s opinion was simply fat.
,” hissed Nagini. “
“– Potter has been smirking the entire match –”
Atieno decided to be the more mature one, for once, and drop it. “There are many different strategies in duelling that you can use,” he said. “In the duel you and I had, I could tell you are an aggressive duellist and this works perfectly because Salazar and I are exactly the same.”
They barely made it out of the door before they burst into laughter. Harry clenched onto the doorframe and wiped a stray tear from his eyes as he laughed earnestly at the image of a slug Draco. “Where’s Dobby? Shouldn’t he be around here somewhere? Normally he greets us whenever we return.”
As expected, Dumbledore began explaining that mere seconds after he pondered it. It would be year level and then the winners of each year level would duel each other, with the exception of first-year students. So, second versus third, fourth versus fifth, sixth versus seventh. It sounded like a good system for him. It meant he would win at his level and then beat those above him for more bragging rights.
Draco nodded and watched the front, “deal.”
“What do you expect from Nott’s final meeting?” said Draco, deciding on a change of topic, knowing that Harry had all the arguments prepared for maturity and he would never step foot into that mess. “I know we’ve talked about it a little, but I can’t help but feel as if something will go differently and we’ll all be thrown back a bit and left hanging upside down.”
“What are you doing in here Malfoy?” Hermione sat down with a rather large book in her hand.
“Right,” said Draco. “Harry will be in the middle, as it was his idea.”
A few snickers filled the chamber.
A man bowed. “Good morning.”

A few minutes later had the entire class up and rummaging through the expanded closet of clothes that the professor had somehow acquired.
“Dark Lord,” said the other boy. “Voldemort did what Grindelwald could not.”
“All the documents have already been processed,” said James, looking at Arthur. “Of course, the property won’t become his until after the World Cup, but future locations are undecided. Fudge, who has improved rapidly over the previous years, has already contacted the other leaders and they reached a conclusion the Quidditch teams were agreeable to.”
“I hate to break it to you, headmaster, but red and gold isn’t
He realised that Nagini had meant the Abraxans, which made much more sense. He had no idea that the creatures were predators of snakes, but then again, they could fly, were insanely quick, and seemed to have a powerful kick. One powerful stomp and he could see why a snake would fear the creatures.
“You misunderstand, Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore. “The small study club that you made between Slytherin and Hufflepuff was stopped due to the large amount of concerns and complaints the professors received regarding it. A fair few said that the group wasn’t functioning correctly and that it was primarily a cheating group and not a study group.”
limited with out options. Snape
“Oh, come on.”
“Something weird? Is it bad?”
Eventually walking into wakefulness like a painting quietly bleeding its colours away, Harry opened his eyes to a darkness that wasn’t like that of the Woods. Disoriented and confused, he tried to make sense of what had just been happening. Hadn’t he
changed into a familiar, comforting lullaby of
“I kind of miss Hogwarts, you know,” Ron said. “Watching Hermione pack her things and get ready to leave, makes me wonder if I should have decided to go back as well.”
If you enter Libya, and cross countless of miles into the desert to the west, right before you reach the Algerian border, you’ll find Ghadames, the oldest habitable city in the entirety of Sahara. At first, it’ll seem like a ghost city with its empty streets, but you’d notice by how clean and well-kept everything is that there are people living there. I went there briefly in early 2011 as part of a longer trip to Libya then, and to this day I’m hard pressed to think of a place more beautiful (IDK how it is now tho, since so much has changed). That’s why I wanted to include it here. It’s a place that deserves to be mentioned and appreciated. Also the Kufi signs are real btw, or at least were in early 2011.
“Here,” Bellatrix said suddenly. Harry looked at her first, before taking a look at the room they were now in - it wasn’t special by any means. There was a table with a large box on it. The walls were stained and white, the floor was wooden and creaky.
“Yes,” Harry replied, not knowing what else to say. Lestrange had turned to look at him as well, leaning closer and closer. Her breath smelled like candy when she spoke:
Did Uncle Tony know that by disconnecting the fireplace indoors and connecting to the fireplace outside, he had ended up trapping Harry in the House every night? Because Harry was not going to go outside - not for anything.
“If he has to go, then he will go to Hogwarts,” Lily replied, a tone of irritation breaking through the haze of happiness she usually lived in. “James and I attended Hogwarts - we want Harry to have that same experience.”
“People fear losing things,” Nott replied. “Change is another thing that people fear, as they worry about losing the good things they have now. Death is all those fears realized.”
Angel’s Trumpet was the wrong name for the plan, its appearance resembled nothing angelic or even peaceful that angels accordingly give to humans. The woman who found the plant simply gave a misleading name in hopes that people would be foolish enough to harvest the plant and then die. It was not her wish to do so, however, it was the person that she bowed to.
“What’s your opinion on this?” said Draco, gesturing discreetly at the situation in front of them. “This is something I never thought I’d witness.”
“No!” hissed the goblin. “You must fight like a goblin! Hands and swords only.”
“I never really noticed it before, but you seem to have a way of easily manipulating your mother,” said Draco with a slightly raised eyebrow. “Not that I blame you, as I do it with father. But, I cannot help and think on why you convinced her we were called Death Eaters or anything like that. I don’t think I have ever seen someone be called a Death Eater at all, or even heard the words in passing. At least not yet.”
“I said…”
Ron stood back as if he had been struck. His hand tugged at his robes, trying to find his wand. His wand may underperform due to an issue at the start of the year, but it could still work and he would demonstrate this by throwing a spell at Potter. “HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE MY SISTER, POTTER?” he screeched, sounding more like a rabid dog than a human. “I’LL MAKE YOU PAY, POTTER!”
He had already turned the cute little white rabbit into a pair of slippers, which wasn’t even the assignment, but he did it anyway. He turned the slippers green and added the crest of Salazar Slytherin on it. He smiled at Professor McGonagall when she just sighed. He flicked his wand and the Transfiguration vanished, leaving the small little bunny who hopped toward shim, tinged green fur with silver stripes.
“Don’t you dare, don’t you dare talk about Harry or his safety, wouldn’t it be a shame if this entire school learned that you sent him back to his relatives houses for them to abuse him, call him worthless and almost kill him with each year. The only reason Harry survived was because he heals exceptionally fast, which the people who have him have most likely already realized and each day we just sit here he’s getting attacked! Have you ever been under the Cruciatus spell Dumbledore? Once is bad enough, twice is like your body is going to fail you, I have no idea how three feels but it’s enough to paralyse you completely, you force yourself into a coma to ignore the pain. So far Harry has been hit with that spell three times, each time it hits him I feel it. You sit here and claim Harry is fine yet he fears for his life? He’s scared and angry, at times he feels worthless and you just sit here and improve the wards like that will do something to help him, at this rate he won’t be here for the future while you sit here like an old crack pot fool and sip tea, you arse!” Draco’s voice cracked with anger, he was on the verge of tears and he dropped to his knees, he was exhausted, or was Harry exhausted?
Draco gaped as nothing happened, his eyes darting between each adult in the area, his mind stopping and nothing was being processed as he tried to take in what was being done. He had long since stopped verbalising his worry about Harry, who had since appeared near them, a feat he had no idea how his friend accomplished and was lounging – actually lounging – on the ground near the barrier as if nothing was wrong.
“I suggest keeping your head down and travelling in groups,” said Harry. “If someone or something is attacking students, I doubt it would attack groups and seeing as both Mrs. Norris and Creeves were supposedly alone when attacked, it makes sense. Leave the heroics to the Gryffindors. I see no shame in fleeing if it’ll keep you alive.”
,’ said Tom. ‘
“Forgotten, did you know people think we’re dating?” Draco smiled.
“A fully grown man?” said Professor Flitwick, surprised. “That’s outrageous!”
“Bye Harry and bye Hermione!” Pansy nearly yelled.
Lavender almost tripped over as she walked back towards her seat, her eyes directly on the ground.
“An excellent idea!” said Professor Moody. “Ten points to Slytherin! And, as a bonus, I won’t even ask how you got the information about the competition. Right, sit back down. This won’t take long, but I don’t want you fidgeting and missing this vital information.”
“The concern is his impenetrable Occlumency shields, or walls, as some call them, Severus,” said Dumbledore, his face slightly paling. “Even if he was telling the truth, his ability to lie and change the truth with a simple practice of Occlumency makes him a prime suspect.”
“I’m a male and therefore will be taller,” said Lewis. “Just you watch!”
At that moment Ron walked over, with a furious look on his face that Harry recognized, it appeared as if Seamus and Dean noticed to, Hermione was oblivious to it. Hermione went to stand and Harry clenched her arm and forced her to stay, this made Ron even angrier.
“Yes,” said Harry in cold tone of voice. The entire room went silent, not that there was any chatter before, but it was definitely silent now, all eyes turned towards Harry Potter, even Dudley’s eyes focused on him.
“Be careful, Weasley. You don’t want to start any trouble or your mummy will have to come and take you away from school,” sneered Draco and then stood a little straighter, he then spoke in a highly ear-piercing voice. “If you put another toe out of line –” he paused while knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this. “Weasley would like a signed photo, Longbottom. It’d be worth more than his family’s whole house.”
Harry took a deep breathe, telling himself this was normal, this is what friends did, not that he ever had real friends, well male friends anyway. Ron was a different kind of friend, he was like a brother and that’s it. Harry glanced at the pyjamas that he was wearing, they had the Malfoy family crest on the right side and they were silver with green trimming, he didn’t expect any less. They were also clearly custom-made, as they felt like pure satin but different, and had some spells to remove sweat, they were really brilliant.
“There are rules and regulations,” said the druid. “Thankfully, you are underage and much easier to deal with. An adult would have no hope. My weakness is youth.”
The professors nodded and waited in silence as the house-elves set the table with tea and some biscuits.
“Harry…”
“Follow you where?” said Harry, trying to press for some details. “Where do you want me to go?”
“Indeed, but that is for Severus to say, not me.”
“If you cannot win fairly in Quidditch, you don’t deserve to play.” Harry puffed.
,’ said Tom. ‘
“Where else would you go?” Ron laughed to himself.
“Neville knows very little about Ilvermorny,” said Hermione. “You’re putting so much faith in something he knows nothing about.”
“What did I
I’m so morbid.
Regardless, it was nice to know that the stairs creaked and if he desired to leave the house, he would have to actually sneak. He found it very kind of Weasley to show him how to get around the house without making a sound.
“Enough time to understand your speech patterns,” said Clara. “Now, we’ve wasted enough time, I think it’s about time we participated in this race.”
“Could I have a glass of orange juice and two teas?”
Hagrid checked that Ron and Neville were hidden, when he saw they were, he seized his crossbow and flung open his door once more.
