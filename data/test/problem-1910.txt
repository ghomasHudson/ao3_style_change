No matter how much he wanted to tell someone what was going on, he wouldn’t. It wasn’t Draco's place to do so. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t convince Harry to do it.
“I’ll be right outside that door, waiting, and as soon as it’s alright, I’ll be right here again.” He stated reassuringly.
“Emma? Isn’t that…” He trailed off and looked at the woman who was silently occupying the chair on his left.
He chuckled an, “Ok,” and started kissing the pale back exposed to him as he moved his fingers to finish stretching the tight opening. Harry then gave a triumphant smirk when he found his lover’s prostate and Draco gave a strangled cry.
They were rocking against each other. Then Draco was on top of him creating delicious friction between them. And in the back of his mind, Harry couldn’t help but to compare the feeling to when Ron had forced himself on top of him. Ron had felt like dead weight pressing down on him but Draco… Draco on top of him just felt completely and utterly…
“Are you sure you’re ok with this?” Draco asked a few moments later when he was comfortable. He didn’t get an answer though as Harry had already fallen asleep. “I guess you are.” He said to the back of Harry's dark head.
Harry sighed and turned to head out the door only to find his way blocked by the half-giant Hagrid. He mentally face-palmed himself. The world seemed to be conspiring against him and his date.
“I’m sorry I have to go. I’ll come back as soon as my last class is over though, sooner if I can manage.” Draco said softly.
Draco took a deep breath, steeled himself for Harry's reaction, and began, “We’ve been trying for six months now. What if I just can’t get pregnant? And if I do, what if… what if I lose it? I don’t know how you managed to get through it the first time we found out you were pregnant and you had a miscarriage. You were so upset and depressed; I don’t think I’d be able to survive if it happened to me.”
“What happened, Harry? Why are you in the hospital-wing? And where’s Ron?” She asked in one breath. “I only found out you were here because Ferret-Face told me.” She added, her voice disdainful at the nickname.
“I suppose, but there’s only one… profession I can think of where a man would wear a dress and come running out of an alley in the middle of the night.”
Finally, Eric pulled away and stood up. “I’ll be here in the morning with your wedding attire.” He said as he walked toward the door. “Then I have a hair and manicure appointment for you. Okay?”
Draco's arm was draped lightly over his hip and Harry could feel his warm breath ghosting over the back of his neck. He put his hand over the blonde’s and slid their fingers together, sighing contently.
With that, Ethan leaned down and sucked a hardened nipple into his mouth, worrying it with his teeth.
“You mean the boy in the next room?” Ron asked, pointing over his shoulder as he did so. “He’s fine. I promise. He came in while I was tying you up but I made sure he got back in bed. He actually thinks we’re related, asked if I was “papa’s brudder”.”
Eric raised his hand to the boy’s face and trailed a finger down his cheek. “So innocent and naïve.” He murmured. “Didn’t they teach you at Hogwarts that wizards can, in fact, get pregnant?”
“I would hypothesize the trauma you experienced earlier this evening…” She glanced up at the clock on the wall. It was nearing two am. “Or I should said yesterday evening now, caused this somehow. We’ll need to talk and see if we can’t make sense of it.”
“Aaahhh… faa… faster.” He pleaded as Harry repeated the process, striking that special spot dead on. Draco's mouth fell open in a silent scream.
“It’s just after six. You only slept for about an hour, so you can go back to sleep if you want.” Harry quietly replied.
Before Draco had a chance to reply, a wet finger pushed its way into his puckered hole and he let out a loud moan. “When can I top again?” He asked, even as he pushed himself further onto the finger.
“Oh, why do you wear them then?” Now that Draco wasn’t wearing the heels, Harry could see that the man was only two or three taller inches than himself.
Draco wiggled the fingers he had buried fully inside Harry and pushed them in just a little bit further. He was rewarded with a loud moan and an exclamation of, “Holy shit!”
“Thank you, Draco.” Harry said as more tears fell from his eyes. The blonde smiled softly in return.
From his place at Harry’s cock, Draco reached up and placed three fingers at his mouth. He pulled off for a moment and commanded, “Suck.”
The other three were slightly taken aback by Harry's outburst and warily followed him as they were afraid something was going to spontaneously explode.
Finally, it was time to add the third finger. Ethan added more lubricant before slowly inserting the last digit.
Finally Draco broke the kiss to look Harry directly in the eye. He lifted himself up and then slowly began lowering on to Harry's hard length. He felt tears pricking at the corners of his eyes from the intense burning that was coursing through his body and reluctantly squeezed them shut to try and block out the pain.
Draco sneered at his husband. “What’s there to talk about? He went against us and now he deserves to be punished.”
The five year old blonde just shrugged and repeated his question more forcefully, “What is a chibi?”
“Good night.” Harry replied a little sadly as he too laid down facing away from his bedmate for the night.
He was about to start writing about how he had heard meows from the top of the stairs when he saw Draco enter the living room.
Harry knocked on Kingsley's office door. Amanda had just informed him that the Senior Head Auror had wanted to see him in his office.
"It will calm you." Harry says with that heart-melting smile of his. Draco looks away and munches on his chocolate. Casting a quick Tempus lets Draco know it is 7:30 p.m.
"So you have performed every bit of magic. For today, I thought how about the most advanced magic? A Patronus?" Harry asks.
It took everything Harry had in him to not jump up, pin Draco to the wall and snog him senseless. The way Draco's eyes shined after he performed another bit of magic, or the way his lips curved into the most beautiful and the most kissable smile Harry had ever seen, or the way Harry's name rolled off Draco's tongue drived Harry crazy. Everyone; Ron, Hermione, Molly, Ginny even McGonagall and Harry's students had noticed the change in Harry's behaviour, everyone except Draco. Harry didn't tell anyone about it except Ron and Hermione who already knew and Charlie who he trusted the most.
"Now reach within-" a loud cough and more blushing from Draco interrupts Potter at that. "-and try to find your magic."
So that was the Chapter! Tell me what you think. Also any suggestions or constructive criticism will be taken into account and highly appreciated.
It was Potter and he was a sight to behold. His hair was even more messed up than usual, standing up on every end. Bags were prominent under his eyes and his eyelids were drooping but his eyes were alert and at the moment, they were resting on Draco.
"It indeed is me Mr. Potter. I apologize to have disturbed you when you were so obviously sleeping or had a- rather- long night." She replies.
Harry already knew that Malfoy was good at potions, second only to Hermione, but seeing him on this list was definitely astounding.
"Okay then. We'll come and when I do, I won't be leaving if anyone asks me to." Potter stood up and stormed off. Draco had no idea what that meant.
Harry groaned as he felt another tug on his hair. He had stayed at Ron and Hermione's, giving in to their insistence and was now awake an hour earlier than normal because Ginny had come over and had wanted to see him.
I can only stare with wide eyes as Potter lowered his face to mine and kissed me again. The feeling of his lips, his soft and plump lips, on mine is so amazing that my eyes close involuntarily and my toes curl in my shoes.
Draco could only stare at them until Kingsley's voice brought him back to reality. "Go ahead." He gestured towards the bodies and stepped back.
With a nod Kingsley continued, "You see, Mr. Malfoy, we, Aurors, have a rather...challenging and significant case to solve." Draco had no idea what  that had to do with him but he didn't interrupt. "I have selected my most able auror for the case but we need your assistance. It has come to my knowledge that you are a brilliant potioneer and you have knowledge of the Dark Arts; both of which my most capable auror doesn't master in. We require both of these expertise to solve this case." Kingsley finished.
Harry left him alone with his thoughts and went back to his parchment where he had been scribbling; "Possible Evidences and Suspects". So far, he had managed to write the following:
He sat at the chair at the end of the table; the chair of the Head of a Family while Narcissa sat on his right side. Draco helped himself to a generous helping of the shepherd's pie the house-elves had cooked.
"Keep your voice down, Potter! This is a library, for Salazar's sake. And to answer your question, I did find something. I think this book might be useful." Draco held up the thick leather-bound textbook.
Potter held it in a way so that the snake couldn't see the wand. Then he said something in Parseltongue and his face was so full of anger that I flinched. Potter barely noticed, though. He was talking to the snake, practically hissing in anger.
Harry turned around to see who had entered his office and was surprised to see Malfoy. It was too damn early to deal with him but Harry had absolutely no choice.
"Its no problem, Malfoy. Now that I am er- helping you, we will hopefully make more progress." Draco nods then sits at the sofa, feeling exhausted.
Harry sighed and let go of Malfoy's arm, sitting back on the desk. "I'm sorry. This whole thing...it's just agitating me." Harry muttered.
Harry cringes at Ron's disbelieving shout. When Harry had told him that Malfoy couldn't perform magic anymore, he sounded gleeful, too gleeful but when he come to know of how Harry had agreed to help him, his reaction wasn't the best.
He reached in front of a wooden door with a sign "Do Not Disturb" on it. Draco frowned, Kingsley had said that the guy was expecting him so he ignored the sign and knocked on the door. "Come in!" A deep voice answered. Draco took a deep breath and opened the door.
For a few seconds they stared at each other, then Potter spoke, "Let's not talk here." With that he turned around in the direction of his office.
"It is called a hoodie, Malfoy." Potter says through his laughter. Then he pulls the piece of fabric hanging on his back over his head. Draco can't help the blush that rises on his cheeks when sees Potter's extremely cute ridiculous grin that causes his eyes to sparkle and laugh lines to appear on his face and his face looks so adorable in that hoodie and Draco just wants to- Draco cuts his thoughts with a deep breath before he does something extremely mortifying like kiss Potter and rolls his eyes halfheartedly.
He laughs loudly at that but soon stops when a slow, romantic song starts. Potter sways in time to the music and I start moving too. We dance in complete silence until he breaks it.
At first Draco's mind blanks but after blinking at Potter for a few minutes like a moron  he replies in the most embarassing voice possible, " Ummm.. No.."
"You could go without a date." Draco didn't know why he even bothered with dignity anymore. His mouth had a mind of its own and was stubbornly compelled to mortify him at every chance.
Or maybe he was just too foolish and arrogant to accept the fact that someone could outsmart or overpower him.
The demolished house on the end of the street was always off-limits. Innocent little children were forced to stay in their houses, wizards were not able to roam freely in the streets, all for fear of the monster that lived in House 248.
"I…my head!" He gasped, looking up at Draco with huge blood-shot eyes. Draco walked towards him slowly, trying to figure out what was happening. It couldn't be the Potion since Draco wasn't feeling anything.
He was about to panic when he caught the sheepish and embarrassed look on Potter's face. Draco raised an eyebrow as Potter's stomach gave another loud growl.
Harry frowned, his stomach lurching as he thought of why Shacklebolt, the Senior Head Auror wanted to talk to him. He wasn't worried or afraid of Shacklebolt exactly, they had a perfect relationship with mutual respect for the other but Harry was afraid his team had reported his episode on the last mission to the Head Auror.
Our lips move in sync as everything and everyone around us is forgotten. For now, it's only us, me and him, Malfoy and Potter, Draco and Harry. I smile into the kiss. I'm now Potter's, Potter is now mine.
"This is so much harder than brewing Amortentia and that's saying something." Draco had muttered lowly, forgetting for a second that he had company.
After a little while of dating, they had decided that their relationship clearly wasn't working. Ginny's profession as a Quidditch player and Harry's job as an Auror clashed together rather negatively, where neither of them had enough time to be together. So they had called it off and remained great friends; Harry would go as far as to call her one of his best friends.
Harry had no idea what had come over him. He knew he should've told Malfoy where to aim the Reducto but he had been so distracted by his feelings and Malfoy's tight jeans that he had completely forgotten. And when he had seen Malfoy aiming the Reducto at his precious gift, the gift Charlie Weasley, the only person who could truly understand him, even better than Ron or Hermione,he had completely lost it. It was hard for him to control his anger, even though he knew it wasn't Malfoy's fault but when he saw Malfoy crying, actually crying, he had calmed down. Malfoy looked so bloody terrified of him. As though Harry would Avada Kedavra him any minute.
"Potter?" It was Malfoy, an uncertain smile on his face. He clutched the decaying book they had issued from the library.
The place was dusty and damp like every other shop in Knockturn Alley. Shelves, holding a wide range of mysterious looking magical objects; daggers, jewellery, wand cases, cauldrons with glimmering diamonds, lined the walls covered with peeling wallpaper. Harry paid the objects no attention but moved forward with resolve. He had one reason to be here and he won't be distracted.
The statement activates another train of thought similar to the previous one and Draco feels himself become redder but he does as told. Taking a deep breath he tries to banish the images his mind had so kindly supplied him with.
"Do you think-" Draco was about to ask Potter how he knew whether this man wouldn't be the next Voldemort but his words were interrupted when the door of Kingsley's office opened and he entered, looking sombre.
When he did open his eyes, however, instead of his Patronus, he saw Harry. Saw the pride and ecstasy in Harry's eyes but more than that he saw what Harry had probably always kept hidden. Harry's emotions were now unguardedly displayed on his face and Draco's heart raced when he saw them. There was so much affection, so much fondness, so much love in Harry's eyes that before Draco knew what he was doing, as though in a trance, he ran towards Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, burying his face in the crook of Harry's neck.
"Guys, it's me! Harry!" He shouted desperately, his voice cracking. This time there was a reply but not from someone Harry wanted one from.
"Why are you giving me chocolate?" Draco asks but takes it nonetheless, he could never refuse chocolate.
"Its okay. Not many wizards or witches can find their magical cores at the first try. Now I want to see whether your magic has completely vanished or is very little. Since you can't find your magical core yet, we have two options. Either you take your time and find your magic, if there is any within you, or let me enter your mind and find it for you." Harry says.
Draco closed the book with another sigh. He had searched almost every book he owned but apparently, jewels weren't a very common ingredient for potions.
Also, I saw a bunch of posts about how Draco fans justify his wrong actions and I really wanted to address that in this; the fact that redemption is truly a thing.
"There's something you're still hiding." Malfoy stated. It was said with such conviction, Harry was sure Malfoy had somehow performed Legilimency without him knowing.
, give you any information about him. You are wasting your time, Auror Potter. I do have a little piece of advice for you, however; be careful, the man's dangerous, he intends to avenge the Dark Lord's death. What better way to do it than destroy his Lord's killer?"
He reached a dark wooden table and stopped walking, his knuckles rapped loudly at the furniture, the sound echoing eerily in the quiet shop.
Draco's eyebrows rose. 2000 Galleons was a generous amount and was definitely a plus but Draco's reason for accepting Kingsley's offer was still mainly to make up for all the devilish things he had done.
After her, Harry had dated a few girls and to the surprise of the entire wizarding world, all except Hermione and Ginny, even a few boys.
I feel embarrassed. I knew it was Pansy's birthday and she had helped me so much that I had to get her a gift she'd remember for her whole life.
Harry frowned. Draco was never nervous. Well he was nervous on their first date, and the first time they went to the Burrow but he mostly acted like this when something was very wrong or bothering him alot.
Just as he was thinking that it couldn't get any worse, he started hearing something. It was not the sharp ringing that had been buzzing in his ears before, no this was something different, something so much more terrifying.
"Okay, I wanted to enhance your beauty so-" She suddenly stopped speaking and her eyes widen as her mouth drops open.
"Okay, then. I uh- discovered something. We have a lead." Malfoy grinned brightly, his eyes sparkling with happiness and Harry couldn't look at that open expression for a second longer. He looked away.
Draco opened the potions book he had issued from the library and started to read the pages he had marked; A Blinding Potion made with sapphires to temporarily blind a person, a Zone-kill Potion to instantly kill any muggles who smelled it made with onyx, a potion consisting opals and pearls to melt the bones of any man or woman who consumes it. All kinds of dark and deadly potions but none that would relate to the one Draco had conceived from the dead bodies.
"Potter, you need to tell me what's hap-" Draco's words were cut off by another pained moan from Potter.
After some minutes, Potter had eaten his own food and was eyeing Draco's in what he thought was probably an inconspicuous manner. Draco had to admit, he was too full to eat anymore of his dish so he had no objection to giving some of it to Potter.
"Alright, sorry. Harry, I agree with Hermione. You defeated the Dark Lord, you are the Boy who Lived, you can ask a Slytherin git out, for sure."
After Harry had passed out, he had woken up at the same place with his team surrounding him. They had already captured the man, struggling against the ropes that were binding him. They were asking him a few questions, but he had dismissed them. Tentatively, they had nodded and didn’t fret over it.
Draco does. After what feels like hours, he feels the cooling sensation in his heart. He says the incantation, does the wand movement and opens his eyes.
The man was breathing hard, his stale breath tickling Harry's face but Harry paid it no notice. The words he had just heard were freezing the blood in his veins. Memories flashed behind his eyes, words echoed in his ears; the pain he had experienced that night, the hissed words in his ears,
“It hasn’t moved for a while now. I think it’s asleep and I’d rather it stay that way for a while. It seems to think my bladder is a punching bag and every time I get hit there, I have to rush to the bathroom.” Harry softly replied as one of his hands joined Draco's.
“You’re at St. Mungo’s, young man,” Healer Mendes replied. “I’ve checked you over, and other than the headache you seem to be just fine. However, I’d like to keep you here just for a few hours to be sure. I’ll get you in a room.”
Finally, when Harry was about ready to give up, it felt like something gave way and a few seconds later, the cries of a newborn infant filled the air.
“Wait, what?” Harry was baffled. “But… b-ut I’m… I’m.” He stuttered, then quietly and quickly added, “I’m
“No, they’ve already been woken up once. Let them sleep.” Draco replied. He then spotted the unfamiliar person in the room. “Who’s she?”
“How are you feeling?” Ethan asked Scorpius when the small family was finally left alone with little Olivia sleeping in a bassinet near the bed.
“Harry.” Draco called, as the brunette man had jumped up from the bed and dashed back into the bathroom before he could even ask him what he was doing.
“We’ll always have each other.” Draco murmured and ran a hand down his husband’s cheek. “Besides, five kids is a big family. And it’ll only get bigger when the girls, Elliot, and James grow up and start having kids of their own.”
After poking it with his wand a couple of times to make sure it wouldn’t explode, or worse, he picked it up and unfolded it. It was a note written in vaguely familiar hand writing but he couldn’t place it.
“Mr. Weasley, what is your relationship with Mr. Potter?” Dumbledore asked once the veritaserum was administered.
“Well… um… we’re not just seeing each other.” Draco said instead of answering the question. He took a deep breath and finished, “We’re getting married.”
“I suppose, but it won’t be the same. We haven’t been apart for a single day since before Christmas.” Harry whispered miserably. The couple held each other for several minutes that passed by as mere seconds.
Oliver held out his arms in a silent plea to hold the child. “Hi, Olivia… Wood?” He questioned as he took the girl.
“I promise. It’ll be tasteful. Nothing more than a mention of trauma to introduce your current relationship.” Anna explained carefully.
While that was going on with Draco, Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey had knelt next to Harry and started checking him over.
Harry took a deep breath and sighed. “I’ll have to tell you about what happened yesterday as well and… I don’t know if I’m ready to talk about that yet.”
Sirius let go of him but didn’t back away. He looked back over his shoulder to see Harry getting out of bed. “Harry, lay back down.” He said softly.
Anna gave him a gentle smile. “Alright then. Shall we continue?” She asked as she picked up her supplies once more.
Harry and Draco exchanged a smirk. They knew the blonde boy was anxious because he was still waiting to hear about his punishment.
“Harry's fine but it’s not over yet. He’s just fully dilated so we’ll probably start hearing screaming soon.” He replied dejectedly. “And Pomfrey kicked me out.”
Harry trepidatiously took the hand Draco extended to him and carefully pulled himself off the floor. He could feel most of his body protest against the movement. As the dark haired boy started moving forward, the hand still holding his tighten and stopped him.
Harry giggled at the sight before him as he entered eight year old Lily and Emma’s bedroom. Draco was sitting on the floor while the blonde twins applied make-up to his pale face.
however manage to get a job at a fast food place for a while, until someone else working there found out about my side job and I was fired.” He grumbled.
By the time the kiss ended, Draco was fully on top of Harry and he had divested them both of their sleepwear.
Once he’d found the bottle he was looking for, Ethan returned his attention to the body splayed before him, specifically the hard cock that was waiting for his touch. He wrapped one large hand around the appendage and gave it a few strokes, earning him a soft moan.
Once Harry's crying turned to sniffling and hiccoughing, Draco asked, “Would you like to talk about it?”
Several more weeks passed before Draco had any contact with “Harlot” whatsoever. Not a single glimpse of that reddish-blonde hair or the sound of her voice. He once thought he heard her giggling only to dash around the corner and see it was just the Weasley chit.
To say the ride to platform 9 ¾ seemed short would have been an understatement. Both teenagers had changed out of their school clothes, Draco into normal robes and Harry into muggle jeans and t-shirt, before the train had even left Hogsmeade.
“It’s a simple, outpatient procedure. From what I’ve gathered, they make a small incision in the scrotum, pull out one of the tubes, cut it, tie it off, and put it back.” He quickly described. “You can read about it, if you’d like.” Draco handed the pamphlet over.
“Yeah, I could have. I applied to loads of places and after every interview, they always said it was promising that I’d receive the job. Then I’d get a call a few days later saying the position was filled, but I know it was Lucius. He was having me followed and then ruining all my chances at finding jobs.
“Harry,” Draco started as he walked into the nursery. Said man was currently putting little James and Baby Olivia, who they were babysitting, down for a nap. Elliot was currently sleeping in his own room. “I think it’s time we had a talk.”
“I didn’t touch him!” Draco shouted as he struggled to get out of Snape’s grip. “I did that to Weasley but he hurt Harry. He’s been beating and raping Harry for over two years!”
The small, chair-filled room was so quiet upon the man’s entrance; everyone in there heard him approaching and looked up at him. No one said a word.
“There is such a thing as Healer-Patient confidentiality but because you were technically not her patient yet, there was nothing stopping her from telling me anything. If you sign that, you will become her patient legally and magically.
“Oh.” The blonde boy was still a little confused but decided he didn’t really want to think about it. “When will the baby be in your tummy?” He asked.
“Yeah?” Ethan asked, then said, “I’ve wanted you pretty much since we met. But I had to wait until you were sixteen.”
"Then how did it get here?" Draco asked. He was pretty sure who was behind it, the same Dark Wizard who wanted to kill Potter but why leave the book in a library?
"Well now I am here so shall we get started?" Potter reached in his auror robes and took a roll of parchment out, opening it.
"I have recently made a deal with the Ministry. With the Aurors, to be specific." Draco spoke calmly but he wasn't feeling that emotion, instead he felt anxious. Not because he was worried what Mother would say. He was now an adult; he could make his own choices without caring about his parents' opinion but he
"Yes, now. So tell me Potter, what are your intentions with my friend?" I ask and watch in satisfaction as his eyes widen.
"Whatever you say Malfoy." Potter says and the idiot has the nerve to wink at Malfoy. With these actions and the effects they caused on Draco, Potter leaves the room with a simple "I'll bring tea." As if he didn't just made Draco go redder than he has ever before.
"Yes it does have to be fish. You agreed to eat something I chose and I'm choosing salmon," with a final furrow of the brows and squint of the eyes, Draco made his way out of the house, leaving Harry to follow behind him. He couldn't help but to let out one final sigh of frustration, realising that compromising, even just once, was going to be painful.
Draco strolled out of the bar door, phone in hand as he prepared for the ten minute wait on his taxi. The biting cold was unexpected, yet not completely unwelcome after the sweltering heat of the bar he'd been stuck inside for hours. He had finished a little earlier than usual, so the wait time was longer than he had anticipated, and with no coat or jacket, he found himself huddled against the wall to stay as warm as possible.
"It's alright, I don't mind sharing," his voice was deep and husky, but there was a warmth to it as he spoke to Draco, ensuring him that there was no bother in sharing the item. "I'm glad I could stop you from falling, I couldn't imagine it would be any fun landing on the ice."
"Well hello there mysterious stranger, it's nice to see you again," he spoke softly, knowing the man would be able to hear him as he threw on the hoodie that he'd stuffed inside his bag earlier that day. It came as no surprise to Draco that once again, his saviour was waiting for him, although this time Draco didn't have the time to loiter and chat, he had to hurry home to work on an essay due the next day.
It had never occurred to him that Harry would go first, struck down by an unknown curse while chasing a new batch of wickedly dark and evil wizards. Draco had never believed he would have to face a future alone, sat by his husband's bed side, watching as he slowly faded and the final wisps of his life force slipped from his body. It was ridiculous of him to think that Harry was safe from the clutches of death and that Draco was safe from the ever growing reach of loneliness.
"I didn't know about the whole feud thing when I refused to shake your hand, I just thought you were being a snob. I apologise for those actions, and really would like to end that feud and try to work towards being civil with one another," Harry was earnest in his explanation, hoping that Draco would take it well and understand that Harry had not meant for things to turn out the way they did.
Draco struggled across the slippery ice coating the pavements as he made his way home. It had been a long night at the bar, and he was too exhausted to be dealing with the slick and dangerous concrete. Fumbling in his bag, Draco took his eyes off the icy path before him, searching for his phone in an attempt to silence the continuous buzzing from within. As his hand finally clasped the device, his foot made contact with a patch of unnoticeable ice, and he felt his whole body begin to fall as his ankle jarred from the contact.
"Shut up Potter," he paused for a moment to rake in the gift, "it's truly exquisite. I still don't understand why you decided to give it to me though," there was confusion in his voice as he fingered the soft material with a contemplative look upon his face, questioning the intent behind such a gift.
"Draco, by the way," he startled the man as he climbed into the taxi. "The name's Draco." As the taxi pulled away from the curb, he could see the man smile as he mouthed his name, all in all, Draco counted it as a small win for the evening.
The pair had attended intensive therapy before they even reached the point where they felt comfortable being in public together as a couple. There had always been a mutual attraction, but they needed to know that they now felt the same way regarding the world. Draco was willing and wanting to change his beliefs, if they could even be called his, having been taught from such a young age, he knew nothing else. Neither of them had expected such a backlash upon surrounding their decision to date, even with the obvious and noticeable changes in Draco's personality, thoughts and actions. Everyone thought that Harry had been forced into it, that he had somehow been strong-armed into dating his childhood enemy. The amount of rumours that circulated posing the question of whether he had Imperiused Harry was astounding.
He had been clueless as to what had been happening, not only to Harry and their relationship, but to himself and the way he was changing. He had lost his way, he didn't know who he was anymore, what he was doing with his life or where he was going. Surely the only thing that was left was downhill, he needed to make some changes, because he couldn't continue on the path he was heading down. He knew that if he did, Draco would end up penniless and alone, his fake friends having fled for someone with deeper and richer pockets, while those who truly loved him would have been pushed away some time previously.
"They were different types of chicken Draco! You said you wanted a roast too, so I don't see why you're complaining," Harry had reached the point of whining, he wasn't ashamed to admit that he just couldn't be bothered to deal with the argument anymore, even if they did need to desperately go food shopping. He tried to put the image of barren cupboards to the back of mind, unwilling to give in because it was hard.
"Ew, fish. Does it have to be fish?" It was impossible to not let out the moan of disgust as Harry imagined a big pink fish, flopping about on his plate. He could guarantee that it would be nothing like the crispy cod and salty chips he preferred at the local takeaway, soaked in vinegar and oil.
"Do you mind if I wait with you?" it was the same husky voice from the night before, and Draco knew that when he looked up, he would be greeted by the same vivid, emerald green eyes.
The journey was swift, taking only five minutes to reach the dingy flat Draco owned, deep in the sprawling streets of the city. Wrapping the cardigan tighter around himself, Draco prepared himself for the short run to his front door, key in hand and ready to run.
Draco sashayed down the stairs, trying not to allow the hangover to take over his body, his head throbbing and beginning to quake as music billowed out of the radio. It had been a long night of singing and partying, along with an overabundance of alcohol, leaving him with an outrageous headache and a throat as dry as the desert. Burying his head further into his dressing gown, he creeped his way into the kitchen, intent on following the distinctive scent of bacon wafting its way through the house.
"It's all a part of the mysterious and intriguing persona I'm trying out, I don't want to give too much away," the smirk on his face was a change from his usual soft smile or slight frown, Draco found it endearing, cute even.
"Alright, hurry up boys, it's leaving in just a few moments," Regulus faffed, quickly making sure their trunks were piled onto the train and that both looked their best. With a swipe of his wand, clothing smoothed down and their hair flattened, any attempts at taming Harry's curls failed, but at least the pair looked more put together than before. The pair hurried inside the compartment they had claimed as their own, rushing to the window as the whistle blew loudly.
Once again, Draco was hurrying out of the bar, this time the snow was already falling in thick sheets, and he could barely feel his feet from the numbness that had started to spread throughout his body. His uniform did not provide the warmth that he desperately wished for, instead the thin material of his trousers and t-shirt welcomed the shill as he wrapped his thin cardigan around himself as tightly as possible.
“All the money I had, I spent on him. I only ate enough to keep myself alive and relatively healthy and I didn’t waste money on anything unnecessary, like television. My outfits were all either given to me or… stolen. I didn’t spend a cent on myself if I didn’t have to.” The blonde explained.
Harry turned onto his back and smiled up at his boyfriend. Then he wrapped his arms around the other’s neck and kissed him soundly.
Taking that as his cue to move things along, Harry pulled his fingers from the tight warmth and got onto his knees. Draco reached into his bedside table for a tube of lubricant. He popped the cap and squeezed some into his hand before tossing the bottle to the side. His hand reached down to apply the gel to Harry's prick.
After a few passes around the room, Scorpius had found no one he knew or anyone he would be interested in talking to. Bored, he decided to sit at a table until dinner was served.
Upstairs, Harry found Lily and Emma sitting in the same bed looking at a puzzle book. “Did you girls brush your teeth?” Their raven haired father asked. The pair nodded in unison and flashed their pearly whites. “Good job. I’ll be back up at 9:00. You can stay up until then. And just in case you’re already asleep when I come back…” Harry made his way to the bedside and gave both of his girls a goodnight kiss. “…I love you both very much.”
“Bloody hell, Malfoy!” Harry finally registered exactly what was going on and pushed the taller boy away as he spoke. “What, in Merlin’s name,
Draco blanched slightly. “The answer is gonna sound pretentious.” He replied. “Tradition. We can’t exactly have a baby out of wedlock, now can we? And I thought it would be easier to get it out of the way during summer holiday than trying to deal with school, pregnancy, and planning a wedding.”
Harry thought about it for a moment. There were many questions he’d had back when he was pregnant the first time but there was one that really stuck out.
“That’s correct, Mr. Potter. Now, this conversation is not going in the direction I had intended.” She looked at the headmaster and then at Draco. “Albus, Mr. Malfoy, if you would please excuse us, I would like to give Harry a pre-natal exam.” The two men nodded and left; Dumbledore to his office since he didn’t really need to be there anymore and Draco to wait in the corridor.
“Of course, sir. Just let me change into something more suitable. I’ll be there momentarily.” Madam Pomfrey replied.
Kingsley smiled supportively. “Of course, that is completely understandable. Now, who are these beautiful young ladies and the… gentleman behind you?”
By the time our Savior left Hogwarts for the year, Harrison knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Harry and he was sure the other felt the same for him.
Forgetting everything he’d learned and practiced with Madam Pomfrey, Harry began to panic and hyperventilate, suddenly wishing he’d gone to stay in the hospital wing. As his breathing sped up, his head started to swim from the lack of oxygen and he fell back onto his pillow, unconscious.
“Mr. Malfoy, be useful and keep applying this. I need to get you a pain relieving potion. The one thing this salve doesn’t do is make the pain go away.” She said softly.
With an amused shake of his head, Draco made his way back to Harry and climbed into his side of the bed. “I’ll stay until you fall asleep. Will that make you happy?” He asked as he settled in behind the other boy.
“I missed you so much.” He practically sobbed into the taller boy’s chest as Draco put his arms under Harry to hold him up.
Finally, Sirius shook his head and rubbed his eyes. “Have I died and gone to hell? And my eternal punishment is to see my loved ones paired with people I hate?” Sirius asked incredulously.
“You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.” Draco began, “We don’t even have to finish what we started if you don’t want to”
The first thing that ran through his mind was the same thing every time: how glad he was that this room hadn’t been destroyed in the war. After that his thoughts turned to the war itself. Harry couldn’t believe it had been nearly a year ago already. It didn’t feel that like long and he didn’t feel any different. And yet, he felt completely different at the same time.
“I wrote a very good friend of mine a letter and I haven’t heard back yet.” He lied. “He probably hates me since I didn’t tell him about the wedding myself.” His voice held little to no emotion in it. He’d have to learn to be indifferent if he wanted to stay sane.
“Have a seat.” Ethan offered as he moved a few articles of clothing from the full size bed to his pile of dirty clothes in the corner. The raven-haired teen plopped himself down and got comfortable while his host tidied up a bit.
Harry's eyes met Draco's with a pleading look in them and the blonde took that as permission to continue. So, he leaned forward and captured the other man’s lips in a heated kiss.
Ten minutes passed and Draco returned with pizza. He walked into the kitchen where Harry was setting the table and put the two boxes on the counter.
“Me? Are you sure?” Draco asked, wanting to be sure Harry was absolutely positive with that decision.
“It’s only a month, Harry.” Draco said as he wrapped an arm around said boy’s shoulders and pulled them together. “We’ll be together again soon enough.”
Before Harry could even finish his last statement, the line went dead. Head hanging, he sobbed harshly and mumbled, “I need you to come home.”
At the same moment, another contraction hit him and Harry started sobbing again. Draco had let go of his hand for a second to pull up a chair and was back by his side instantly.
kid did that to dad?” Scorpius looked like he might cry as he spoke. “And why had I never heard of him?”
Harry flashed him a quick smile and replied with, “Yup.” Then he picked up Scorpius, who had successfully made it onto his stomach, and turned him around so that he was still facing them.
Skeptically, Harry took the mirror that was offered to him and gasped when he caught sight of his reflection. Was he looking at Harry Potter? Yes, he was. But it certainly wasn’t sixteen year old Harry Potter.
“Trauma? What could possibly be worse than what I’ve already been through?” The man asked, curling in on himself.
“Ah yes, that’s generally the first thing people ask me. I am a muggle-born witch and I find muggle clothing much more comfortable than robes.” Emma replied happily.
“Shhh. Too early.” Harry mumbled and snuggled deeper into the warmth of the blanket and the blonde’s embrace.
Draco got up as well, picking the blanket as he did so. The small family then made their way into the nursery to put the infant to bed.
For the umpteenth time Harry tried to tear up the piece of parchment. But the magic in it prevented any damage from being done. He drew his wand and tried to set it on fire. The flames danced around it for a few seconds before dying out as they had nothing to burn.
Harry quickly downed the liquid and set the empty vial on the nightstand. “Will you lay down with me?” He asked before the potion started to affect him
“After a while, I decided to try my hand at parenting without a partner and one of my friends suggesting becoming a foster parent. It’s worked out well so far.” He finished with a small smile.
Once he was in the hall though, Draco realized he had no idea where they would be. If they were in Gryffindor tower, he wouldn’t be able to help Harry. ‘Don’t think that way, Draco.’
They only had penetrative sex one time other than the first so far though. Not that they didn’t both enjoy it, Harry just felt… awkward about it and he was still rather afraid he was hurting Draco more than the blonde let on.
Every eye in the room turned to the young teen positioned in the middle of the couch. “What do you want to do, Scorpius?” Harry gently asked his pregnant son.
“Why’d she ask so much that didn’t get used in the article though?” The dark-haired boy asked, taking a sip of orange juice.
After a few minutes of leisurely thrusting, Draco pulled Harry's arms from around him, slid their hands together, and intertwined their fingers. He then moved so that their lips were just a hair’s breadth apart. “Kiss me, Harry.”
“Thanks.” Harry said hastily as he jumped out of the car, the rain starting to fall just a bit harder. He hurried to open the back door and unbuckle the small child from the car seat without waking him.
Almost instantly, Scorpius’ small, pale body stiffened. His hips bucked up and he came with a strangled cry of, “Ethan!”
Pressing his fingers against Harry's prostate again, Draco watched, transfixed, as the brunette boy’s hips lifted off the bed and ground down harder on the intruding fingers. And the sounds Harry was making nearly made him come.
pregnancy, Mr. Potter, not the history behind it.” Madam Pomfrey interjected before another question could be asked.
Harry nodded and watched the boy happily run off. He sighed in relief that his curious son didn’t have any questions after that. After all, he had a cute blonde man that needed de-stressing.
“You should go before I decide to just apparate us away from here.” Draco murmured and forced himself to take a step away from his future husband. Harry nodded a little and turned to grab the handle of his cart.
A few seconds later, she was screaming in pleasure as he thrust into her and started a pace that could have been called harsh considering it was only her second time. But Draco couldn’t care less because it was obviously exactly what she wanted.
Harry looked at the other with mirth in his eyes. “You have a waterbed!” He exclaimed disbelievingly. “So not fair.”
Harry's thoughts were completely jumbled as he attempted to figure out a way to contact Madam Pomfrey or anyone at this point. He was screaming names of everyone he knew; hoping beyond hope that one of them would somehow hear him, but he knew it wasn’t possible. People didn’t just appear when they were called.
Nervously, Harry said, “I was having sex with my boyfriend, not Malfoy, and we were trying something new. It didn’t go to well.”
Draco remained firmly in place. He had to know what The Chosen One was crying about in the middle of the night. Besides, he wasn’t completely heartless. He couldn’t let the other boy get caught by Filch or Snape in that state.
“Of course.” She said with a kind smile. Then she went to out to the corridor to retrieve the blonde father-to-be.
“Is there anything in particular you want to try?” Draco asked, almost lazily stroking Harry’s awakening flesh.
Crossing his arms angrily, Draco replied, “Yes, I do. She’s the same mind-healer Harry had when he was sixteen. One of our daughters is named after her. He knows and trusts Emma. She’ll come. Just get her,
“I can only hope that I never experience such a thing and that you’ll never have to go through anything of the sort again. And even twenty years from now, it would worry me more if it
The added stimulation sent Harry over the edge almost immediately and he came with a hoarse cry of, “Draco!”
It was nearly an hour later that a much more painful contraction ripped through him and brought him back to consciousness. When it was over, he was panting and clutching at his distended stomach, silently praying for it to stop.
Now Dumbledore addressed Ron. “Are you going to let Professor Snape give you the potion?” The old man asked wearily.
Harry fell back onto his pillow. “He can’t hear me.” He cried. The man lay in his awkward position, on side his, his legs still over the side of the bed and his arms still bound behind him, as he wept.
“Five centimeters.” Madam Pomfrey announced once she had lowered Harry's gown. The boy in question groaned in frustration, remembering that that meant he was only half way dilated.
“Harry! It’s ok. I’m not going to hurt you.” Draco said firmly over the noise of Harry's splashing. “Harry, Ron is not here. He can’t hurt you anymore.”
Snape then walked out the door, slamming it hard enough behind him that one of Dumbledore’s many trinkets toppled off a nearby table and smashed on the stone floor.
Harry was astonished. He couldn’t remember the last time Draco had something so inconsiderate. Finally, he recovered from his shock. “I grew up without parents… so I’m a slut. Is that what you’re saying?”
“Draco! Oh Merlin, Draco! I need to come!” Harry tried to wiggle one of his hands free but Draco's grip was just too strong.
“There’s no way you could’ve done these. You’re hands are even smaller than mine.” Draco said. “Are there more?”
“Harry.” Madam Pomfrey said, gaining both of their attention. “Just like before, I need you to push on the next contraction.”
Before replying, the blonde boy set his lit wand on a dust covered desk and raised his hands to chest level, showing Harry he wasn’t there to harm him. “She’s not coming.” He said at last. “I—”
Taking his hand, Harry softly explained, “I went home while you were in surgery and took them to Ron and Hermione’s.” He thought for a moment then added, “I know it’s only five in the morning but I can go get them if you want.”
One of Draco’s hands found its way around Harry’s dripping cock and began stroking it. And after only a few pulls, ropes of come sprayed out over his hand. The tight channel surrounding his manhood clenched impossibly tighter and Draco found himself spilling into the hot space.
The dark-haired boy started at the suddenly shouting. He slowly turned around to face the light and his father. “Am I really that late?” He asked, his voice cracking as he looked at an imaginary watch on his wrist.
Finally Draco just decided to get their minds off of it and broke the silence with, “You said you can feel it moving now. Can I?” He asked, putting a hand back on Harry's belly.
Now standing directly in front of the boy, Draco stated, “You can either hand it over willing and get to keep it in the end, or I’ll take it from you and you’ll never see it again.”
The blonde man scrambled up from the bed and ran to the bathroom to relieve himself, leaving the door open in his haste.
Without replying, Emma laid her head on his arm and looked down at the sleeping blonde baby. The three of them sat like that until Harry determined that James was asleep enough to be put in his crib. He then kissed the sleeping three year old on the forehead before taking his daughter’s hand and leading her out of the room.
“You see, Harry.” Draco started as he climbed out. He turned to help Harry down. “Everyone’s happy for us.”
After a minute to let his stomach settle, Draco stood back up and rinsed his mouth out. Then he checked himself out one more time before heading back to bed.
Tentatively and awkwardly, Draco wrapped Harry in an embrace, lowered them both to the floor, and allowed him to cry.
“Perhaps I was wrong in making you leave.” She started. “Harry seems to almost be resisting now and I believe it’s because you’re not there to share it with him.”
The two of them watched as the baby tried to wiggle his way forward to get closer to his parents. After a few failed back and forth rocks, Scorpius turned his attention to flipping onto his back again. Once he was face up, he reached out toward Harry and giggled at the upside down image.
Harry followed slowly behind them and went to stand at his mark to wait for the music to begin with no small amount of trepidation.
Draco hurried through the winding halls of the dungeon, silently praying that she would still be there. He dashed around one last corner and was relieved to see his strawberry-blonde beauty sitting on the floor along a seemingly blank stretch of wall.
Carefully, Draco pried Harry's arms away from his midsection and kissed the skin below his navel. “You’re not fat, Harry.” He sighed. “I would have a problem if you
A few hours later, Harry woke up, trembling from a nightmare in which he stared at his dead baby boy, Ron's maniacal laughter in the background.
“You’re going to be just fine, Harry.” Madam Pomfrey said reassuringly. “But there’s one more thing I want to check before I let you go.”
Sirius couldn’t hold in a short, bark of laughter. “Oh you’re right Malfoy; Harry's going to kill you.”
“Dra- Malfoy… are you-” Harry started, but was cut off when a hot, wet mouth descended upon his burgeoning flesh. “Holy! Fucking! Shit!”
“You know, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were a five year old girl right now.” Draco teased.
As he neared the door to the rarely used bathroom, Draco could hear sounds of a struggle and he quickened his pace.
Draco couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face as he put an arm around the smaller boy’s shoulders. The bewildered look on the other two’s faces didn’t exactly make him want to frown either.
The other man continued to sob for a minute or two before he managed to compose himself enough to speak.
“I have a little while yet.” Draco replied. “Madam Pomfrey went to make sure breakfast gets sent up here for us, well you anyway. She’ll be back in a minute. Then she wants to check you over again.”
Harry strained his ears trying to make out what was being said but it was made impossible when Dudley’s thunderous footsteps were heard coming down the stairs. He turned back to the stove and used a fork to flip the bacon.
After a little while of cuddling and kissing Draco asked, “Hey, how about we go on our first date on the next Hogsmeade weekend?”
Instead of backing down and apologizing for his mistake, Hagrid turned his gaze back to the blonde boy.
Realizing the room had gone deafeningly silent, Scorpius looked up to see everyone was staring at him. He stood up, nervously scratching his forearm. “I’m… I’m going to bed.”
“Did I hurt you?” Harry asked. Draco shook his head stiffly, a few droplets of water flying off his hair.
A minute passed as Ethan continued to dry hump the boy beneath him. He finally had the sense to stop and ask, “Do you want to keep going?”
“That’s it, baby.” Draco lightly bit the side of Harry’s neck and the latter screamed his name as his cock spurted its load into the bed beneath the pair.
Harry gave a sly smirk and replied, “No.” Both boys immediately deflated. “I thought about it… but then I remembered that’s where you two little monsters came from.” He ruffled their already messy hair affectionately.
Shaking his head, Harry whispered, “Terrified. If they knew… I knew the same thing that happened last time would happen again. I don’t think I could take it.” Draco pulled Harry back into a hug as tears started silently streaming down his cheeks.
Together, both males reached into their robes to pull a ring out of an inner pocket. Harry’s hand grazed the contract as he did so. He always kept his copy on him, just so he could check and see if it was destructible yet.
“Hey.” Draco softly said after a few moments of silence. He brought his hand to Harry's chin and tilted his head up so they were looking at each other. “I love you.”
Draco finished tearing off the wrapping paper to reveal two sets of knit baby booties. One done in Gryffindor red and gold, the other in Slytherin emerald and silver. Hermione’s knitting skills had greatly improved since fourth year and Harry stated as much.
Draco's face betrayed his confusion. “What are you on about?” He asked. He’d only ever had one best friend before and he had been imaginary.
Just a couple of minutes later and Draco deemed his partner ready. He moved up the tan body below him and kissed him with bruising force.
Harry turned his attention from the door to his boyfriend. “No. I’ve heard you can become dependent on that stuff if you take too much of it. Merlin knows
Finally, Draco rushed around the bed, nearly tripping on the body he didn’t know was there. He looked down at the redheaded man and sneered before turning softer eyes on Harry.
Draco put a hand on either of side of Harry's face to capture his attention and gave him another kiss. “I love you.” He said with his forehead against the other’s.
Harry tried his best to ignore his lover’s ministrations, but the attention and naked body pressed against his back was getting to him.
The short brunette could practically hear his uncle’s mustache bristle in anger. He was a man who thought it was extremely rude for someone to interrupt a meal, especially dinner or Sunday breakfast.
Despite its color, it didn’t taste too bad. It almost had a chalky flavor to it. She took the empty vial back and replied, “Two. But they’re all grown-up now and have kids of their own.”
“The trauma you’ve experienced seems to have reverted you back to your sixteen year old self.” She replied, jotting some notes down as she did.
Harry could hear footsteps echoing in the corridor and he tried to wake himself back up, he’d always fall asleep quickly here once he’d settled down there. His brain and body didn’t seem to be connected though, and he was out again.
be alright. Maybe not right away, but it will get better. I’ll make sure of it.” The blonde said softly.
The now twenty year old ran a hand through Scorpius’ hair as he began pushing again. “I’m so sorry. It took forever to get someone to cover my shift at work. No one wanted to come in and the owner only finally took over for me when I threatened to quit over the birth of my child.”
Harry managed a few more hard thrusts as the muscles clamped and convulsed around him. He grunted his husband’s name before erupting inside him, every last drop being milked from him.
Draco was shocked at Harry's second curse word. He couldn’t remember ever hearing him swear before… and he really liked it.
“He s-said it wouldn’t h-happen again, Harry. We got passed the first trimester th-this time. It wasn’t s-supposed to happen again.” Draco cried into his chest.
Five minutes later and they were still trying to catch their breath, only now they were on the floor with Draco kneeling between Harlot’s still spread legs, panting against her collarbone.
“They’re cute.” Harry said as the blonde set the booties aside. “My turn.” He picked up another present from the baby pile.
“It might take a while but I’m going to do my best to get back on my feet. Until then, I think Scorpius will be happy here.” Draco smiled sadly. When he turned back to the door, a hand gently grabbed his and stopped him.
“Hurry up, boy.” Vernon demanded once the check arrived. Harry noted that he’d only spoken to him twice so far and it was the exact same words both times.
After a few thrusts in Draco's hand, Harry leaned down and captured his lover’s mouth in a searing kiss. He prodded the other’s entrance before slowly pushing his way past the tight ring of muscle.
Harry huffed and threw the book he was trying to read on the floor. He was even grouchier than usual due to the fact that he was feeling extremely restless but could hardly move to do anything. His body was also achier than normal.
The blonde quickly climbed out of the pool sized bathtub, hurried across the room and grabbed a few fluffy, white towels off a shelf. He wrapped one around his own waist before going over to help Harry out and get them all dried off.
Draco gently cupped his husband’s face with both hands and forced him to make eye contact. "What do you remember?”
“W-wait” Scorpius cried. The older boy complied immediately, not wanting to scare or harm the boy during what was obviously his first time.
Draco reached into his bag, pulled out a cloth, and used it to start wiping make-up off of his face. “Yup, that’s me.” He replied nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t acted like it was a huge mistake just seconds before.
“Of course it’s necessary.” The werewolf replied with a slight growl. “Harry has been through a terrible ordeal and needs help to recover.”
“Sort of.” Ethan replied as he stood back up. “We actually thought about naming her after you, dad, but that’s sort of off the table. We had talked about the name Olivia if it was a girl though. What do you think?”
“Other names?” Remus asked. Draco quickly explained the James situation to them, during which Madam Pomfrey emerged from her office.
“Well, there’s bound to be one the day of and/or after the wedding. Plus when the baby’s born.” The slightly older teen said. “They probably just wanted to save some information for later.”
“I didn’t want you to worry about me, especially since there’s nothing we can do about it.” Harry explained.
“Actually, we uh… we broke up.” Harry explained. “She wanted the famous Harry, not the Harry I really am.”
“Here, let me just…” Ethan scooted behind Scorpius, placing a leg on either side of the smaller body. Before getting started, he took a quick swig of the whiskey still on his nightstand. He offered the bottle once more, but was turned down.
There was a brief pause before Draco closed the space between them by bringing their lips together in a kiss. Harry stood there in stunned silence, trying to process what his school rival was doing to him.
“He’ll be asleep for a couple more hours but you can go in now.” She said to Draco. She stayed behind to talk to Professor Dumbledore as the blonde boy went in.
Draco held up the ring. His index finger was pressed against the ruby. “They have a charm on them.” He said as he let go of the red gem. Harry looked down at his pendant and watched as the glow faded and the vibrating stopped.
“What protection? Neither of us had any diseases and he’s a muggle. So what of it?” Ethan asked, thoroughly confused.
An hour later, and the two boys were stowing their trunks in a compartment on the familiar scarlet train that was the Hogwarts Express. The pair sat on one of the bench seats and made themselves comfortable as the whistle signaling the trains departure blew in the distance.
There was a short, awkward silence. “So… do you know anything else about him? His last name?” Harry finally asked, returning to the subject.
“It took about a year for that to run out and when it did…” He trailed off. “Look, I would do anything for my son and if this is it, so be it. It’s not like I’m a drug addict along with it and I’m always safe. I absolutely refuse to be fucked without a condom no matter which one of us is being penetrated. I won’t even give head if he’s not wearing one.” Draco sighed and attempted to hold back a small sob. Harry still heard it.
As he contemplated his current predicament, a familiar cramping sensation hit his lower abdomen like a wave and he froze in panic.
“I’m sorry Harry. I just wanted to spend more time with you. I wish we were in the same house.” Draco said as they walked toward his room.
Harry just stared at his husband for a long moment. “Scorpius, take this…” He took the antiseptic from Draco and handed it back to the boy. “…and go to bed. We’ll tell you your punishment tomorrow. Your father and I need to have a talk.”
The woman quickly removed her hand, which she thought had been comforting. “Look, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, we have everything under control here. Why don’t you take your family to the hospital to be with your husband?”
“You. Little. Slut.” Eric raised his arm in a clear attempted to back hand Harry, but Draco reacted faster and punched the man in the mouth.
“Are you sure you’re alright, Potter?” Draco asked with a raised eyebrow, almost genuinely concerned.
Sometime after 8:00 pm on Christmas, after Harry's godfathers had left, Draco looked up from the book he was attempting to distract himself with to see the object of his thoughts standing at the opposite end of the couch. In his hands was a box wrapped in shiny, red paper with snitches zooming around.
Harry’s demand was immediately complied with. The hard cock inside him slid out slowly before returning just as slowly.
Harry's legs came around Draco's waist as the older boy began rocking his hips. Their lips parted so Draco could trail them across the other’s jaw and down his neck.
Draco stayed with Harry through the rest of lunch. All too soon though, the bell rang and the blonde reluctantly left Harry sitting there, alone, again.
“Are you going to tell her about the other thing? Or do you want me to?” He gently asked the younger boy.
“Yeah, but I didn’t think that meant I’d have to bottom constantly until I was actually pregnant.” He hissed softly when a second finger slid in with the first.
“Oh.” The dark-haired boy gasped. Gradually, a second finger was added to the first and they began to pump in and out at a gentle pace.
“Oh, what is it?” Draco curiously. He knew the Weasley weren’t the richest family around and wondered what they would’ve gotten them.
A creak from the opening door had Harry cracking an eye open to see who was coming to bother him now. He sat upright and smiled when he saw that it was Draco carrying a plate full of food. Classes must’ve been over with already.
Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, has found true love at last in the form of one Eric Harrison, 28. Not much is known about the wealthy squib, as the happy couple has yet to be interviewed. But Mr. Harrison gladly provided us with a summary of his relationship with the young Potter.
Immediately, Draco's muscled clamped around Harry almost painfully and pulled him into the strongest orgasm he’d ever experienced. For a moment it was as if he didn’t even exist anymore.
“I have to say,” Draco started with a cool smirk in place. “If this is how all of our meetings will go, I hope we meet more often.”
“It’s a mood-evening potion. Usually it’s for pregnant witches or wizards, but Eric is afraid you’ll become emotional during the ceremony. So he’d like you to take it.” She explained in a rush.
For a few moments Draco just stood there staring at Ron, his chest heaving as he tried to regain his breath. Then he remembered why he beat the ginger into unconsciousness.
“If we never do anything more than kiss for however long we’re together, its ok. I don’t need sex. Just being here with you is enough. Now that I’ve got you, I don’t intend to lose you.” Draco said lovingly as he wiped Harry's tears away with his thumbs.
About a week after that embarrassing debacle, Draco was sitting in History of Magic, doodling on his parchment in an effort to stay awake, when a neatly folded paper airplane landed on his desk. He glanced around the room to see who it might have come from but there was nothing indicating that any of them threw it.
“This is our son.” Draco said as he walked around the bed to place the sleeping infant in his husband’s arms.
“Thank you. What would you like to know first?” Draco asked as he started wiping up the semi-dried blood.
The blonde folded the paper and returned to his own breakfast. “I asked her to make sure it was short when I walked her to the door.” Draco responded.
However, Scorpius hadn’t gone a single step when a hand grabbed the back of his collar and yanked him backward. “Insolent, little… Potter?” The sneer in the man’s voice was enough to tell the teen he’d disturbed the wrong person.
“You left. You don’t care about me at all.” Harry sobbed into his pillow. He felt the bed dip under Draco's weight and a hand start to comfortingly rub his back.
“I gotta go.” Draco said as he stood up and then slung his bag over his shoulder. He looked down at the miserable Harry. Then he leaned over and gave him a quick peck on the cheek. “I’ll be back as soon as my last class is over, I promise. Sooner if I can manage.” He said quietly.
“Harry, you don’t have to get in if you don’t want to.” Draco said as he turned Harry around so he could look him in the eye.
Draco looked around at all the faces staring up at him. Remus and a very pregnant Sirius were seated on his right, their five year old girl, Lyra, asleep on the former’s lap. His mother was sitting across from him with a small pile of blankets and pillows at her feet. Elliot was sleeping there. On his left, were Scorpius, Emma, and Lily, both girls were perched half way on their big brother. Only one appeared to be asleep. Standing in a back corner was Lucius, surprisingly still there.
The blonde man pulled a pamphlet from his pocket. “There’s this muggle procedure that’s picked up in popularity in our world. They call it a vasectomy.”
The blonde man stared at Harry with narrowed eyes for a moment. “Fine.” He answered and stomped toward the passenger side.
Harry quickly glanced in the rear view mirror to make sure the toddler in the back seat was still asleep before responding to Draco.
“You’ve really thought about this, haven’t you?” Harry asked, surprised his intended had put so much thought into their future already.
As Draco stood up straight to toss his underwear on the tile, Harry’s face redden more and his cock started to harden while he watched the other’s muscles ripple under his skin.
“Can I talk to Harry for a few minutes before he takes the sleeping potion?” Draco asked after a few moments of silence.
Harry ran both of his hands through his hair in frustration and sighed. He had to know if it was real and make the other remember. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself down a little more and said, “I was your best friend once.”
“I had it for a week before I even read it. I was too afraid that it was rejection from you. When I finally did read it, I immediately started looking for a solution and completely forgot about writing you back.” Draco explained.
The next morning, Harry woke up feeling extremely giddy. Everyone was giving him strange looks except Ron. Ron was confused and angry that Harry could be so happy after last night. He’d thought that he’d taken care of that.
With a thumb, Draco pulled the abused flesh from Harry teeth and rested his forehead against the brunette’s. “Of course. I’d never do anything to hurt you.” He replied with a reassuring smile.
A moment later, the pain that was becoming all too familiar to Harry began again and he was pushing with everything he had.
“Harry, you can’t just let him keep doing this to you. You need to tell Dumbledore and if you won’t, I will.” The blonde said as he stood up. “Come on. I’m going to take you to the hospital wing.”
The blonde had desperately wanted to argue but he held his tongue because he didn’t want to upset Harry anymore.
“Ok.” Harry said sadly. He really didn’t want Draco to leave right now but he did have to go to class. He watched the blonde leave the hospital wing and just stared at the door for a few minutes after he left.
Draco’s smile faltered a smidge. “Unfortunately, no. We talked about it, but never settled on anything. However… I did have an idea that we hadn’t discussed because I was too afraid of upsetting you.”
Harry didn’t know what he was going to do. He was home alone with a small child and his hands were currently bound. But before he had any time to really dwell on that issue, his phone rang. His head snapped up toward the sound and he saw ‘Draco <3’ displayed on the screen.
Draco opened the door to the infirmary to see Harry curled up and Hermione failing miserably at making him feel better.
“I knew I recognized you that day at Diagon Alley when we were eleven.” Harry said sometime later. “And then again on the train. I’ve been in agony for eight years trying to figure out where I’d known you from.”
Several terrible things ran through Harry's head in the few seconds he had before hearing the rest of what she had to say.
The younger boy attempted to do what he was told, but he was too nervous to fully relax, despite the ministrations being applied to his body.
Immense relief filled Harry when Madam Pomfrey finally told him he was just about ready to start pushing. But that happy bubble was quickly burst when she added that Draco had to leave the wing.
“I was in class on the third floor.” Draco said with a soft smile. “And I’m extremely glad I was.” It was then that Harry realized they had reached the fourth floor and were approaching the hospital wing.
“Yeah I’m fine.” He replied as he walked to the sink. He cupped his hands under the faucet and gargled the water. Then he washed his hands.
Draco felt a sense of déjà vu as he pulled Harry's shirt up to look at the damage Ron had done. He winced when he saw the state of the other’s chest and stomach. There was more purple, blue, and black than fleshy pink.
Draco dropped his bag in the empty chair next to the bed, sat down with Harry and asked, “How are you feeling?”
Harry turned from the doorway to see the top of Draco's face peeking over the back of the couch. “Yeah?”
Draco thought about it for a moment. “You couldn’t have apparated. The muggles would have noticed your suddenly disappearing and you would have gotten in trouble. Astral projection is the closest thing I can think of.” He explained.
The sudden movement of Draco sitting up forced Harry to follow suit. He put a hand on either side of the brunette’s head and held him there so that he couldn’t look away. “Harry, what happened to you was a horrible, horrible thing that I would never wish on anyone.
Trying to keep his eyes off the other boy’s naked torso, Scorpius shrugged. “I don’t know. Listen to music, maybe.”
“They’re fine.” The blonde man answered, managing a half smile. “You guys have a baby brother, by the way.”
Draco stifled a small sob over his husband’s predicament. “Ron came back.” He replied, a more than sufficient answer for the older woman who knew the whole story.
Madam Pomfrey immediately took Harry to his reserved bed and lowered the stretcher onto it before vanishing the unneeded item.
He got up and carefully placed the mirror on his bedside table. He opened the drawer and pulled something out. When he came back, he was holding a gift for the other. It was a very small box wrapped in shimmering blue paper.
A tinge of pink adorned his cheeks as Harry said, “It’s your Christmas present.” He handed it to the other with lightly shaking hands. “I hope you like it.”
Harry nodded and then maneuvered them so that they were lying down together. He held Draco and listened to the occasional sniffle or sob until the other was asleep.
Harry sputtered and choked on his early afternoon tea. The owner of that voice wasn’t supposed to be home right now.
Harry was looking past Draco, thinking very hard about the decision he was about to make. He knew he didn’t want to disappoint Draco but he didn’t want to do it just because he wanted him to either.
The Slytherin returned to his place between Harry’s thighs and began removing the clothing of the younger man beneath him.
The blonde picked up a small, rectangular package wrapped in silver. He quickly opened it to find a fairly interesting potions book. “Mum’s not great at shopping for other people.” He muttered and set the book aside.
“Speak for yourself.” Draco suddenly interjected, earning himself a glare from his husband. “We had an incredibly long discussion about sex and protection with you. Then there’s also the fact that Hogwarts finally added a sex education class several years ago. So, how the hell did this happen?!”
The Dursleys, being the evil bastards that they are, had found a sort of “reimbursement” for all the money they had to spend on their “good for nothing” nephew. They sold him, sold him to a man, a muggle no less, who somehow knew all about the Wizarding World and magic. Harry suspected he might be a squib.
Harry smiled sadly. He knew how it felt to be violated and no amount of soap, water, potions, or spells could make you feel clean again. He voiced these thoughts when Draco asked him what he was thinking.
“Draco, what are you doing here?” A flustered Narcissa asked, nearly dropping the book she was reading in surprise. The blonde man quickly crossed the sun room and deposited a sleepy Elliot into her arms.
“Mum went into labor early and the healers couldn’t stop it. He was stillborn. It’s been a while so I don’t exactly remember what happened; just there was nothing they could do about it until they got him out. When they finally did, it was too late, even with magic.” Draco morosely explained.
Once they were outside, Harry's eyes widened and an excited smile stretched across his face. “You came in a limo!” He shouted. “But what about your anti-muggle BS.”
asking to take me.” Draco softly teased. Harry shook his head and gave him a half smile. “Then what?”
Moonlit glinted off of white-blonde hair as Draco Malfoy headed back to his dormitory after a midnight stroll. Somewhere in the distance, the sound of soft crying permeated the air. He rolled his eyes. ‘Probably just some chit crying over her latest breakup. She’ll be fine.’ The blonde sixth year thought.
Draco appeared outside the door to their home not two minutes after his son told him of the situation.
“Sir, just to be sure Mr. Malfoy wasn’t lying about the… sexual abuse, I examined Harry's rectum and found sites of tissue damage, most overlapping others, which, I'm afraid to say, suggests that each wound had time to heal before the act was repeated. I did the best that I could to heal any and all injuries I found but there is a chance of permanent damage.” Madam Pomfrey added.
“When we learned of your first pregnancy, it was very obvious you didn’t know it was possible and you were in shock. Because of that, I decided to wait until a later date when you had fully processed the information. That’s why I gave you that book.
Gray eyes rolled in their sockets. “Potter, if this was an ambush, I think one of us would, at the very least, be unconscious by now.” Draco’s voice held its usual bite, but he wouldn’t look the other boy in the eye anymore. He started fidgeting as well.
“Harry!” She nearly shrieked as she rushed to his side and knelt beside him, immediately conjuring a stretcher beneath him. “How long have you been in labor?” She asked as she spelled a nearby pair of pajamas onto his naked body.
When Sirius finally let go of him, Harry could see unshed tears swimming in those gray eyes. He felt tears build in his own green ones.
The blonde had the decency to look ashamed. “I guess not. That was more your thing with the girls than mine.”
Scorpius angrily crossed his arms. “Good, my dad’s a great person. I’d rather be like him than like your snobby ass.” The man scowled at him and his right hand grabbed the top of his cane.
The blonde had been hoping to get a rise out of the Gryffindor. He was again surprised when Harry just sat there and continued to cry.
Draco quickly took off his robe. “Here.” He said as he wrapped it around Harry's naked waist. “Is that better?” He asked as he started to soothingly rub the other’s back.
Harry dropped the parchment in disgust. He’d been dreamily reading it all day and it was from Malfoy! Why would he pretend to be Ginny?
Ginny smiled as well and laughed a little, glancing between to the boys on the bed. “Although, I have to say this explains why you never picked up on my advances.” She said, loosening up a little.
“Thank you very much for telling me.” Harry helped her jump down from the counter. “When Papa gets home with dinner, we’ll see what’s up with him, ok?”
In the back of his mind, Harry knew the medi-witch was doing something involving the afterbirth and cleaning him up, but he didn’t notice. The only thing that existed was the wriggling infant that Snape was currently wrapping in a blanket.
He smirked triumphantly every time Harry sucked in his stomach when Draco pressed his tongue into the slit. When he’d run his tongue from the base to the tip, Harry would moan loudly, causing Draco to release a moan of his own.
When they headed up for breakfast, they stopped in an alcove near the bottom of the stairs that went up to the entrance hall where they shared a last kiss just like every morning.
Harry sat on the sofa next to Draco once he was back and snapped open the box. “I’ve got bandages, anti-bacterial cream, alcohol swabs, medical tape, and probably anything else you might need.” He stated as he pulled out a few items. “I also grabbed some paper towels and got some wet. Now, talk.”
“So when did Mr. Ma… Draco's first pregnancy occur?” Healer Janus asked once they were seated on the other side of the empty bed in the room.
“I suppose that’s something but I still don’t think you should do what he tells you to.” Draco said heatedly.
Immediately, both boys scrambled up from the couch and each clung to one of the blonde’s legs, beaming up at him.
So for nearly two days the blonde sat in his room, brooding. Every so often he found himself chuckling at the thought that he had gotten so close to the wonderful brunette. Also that he even missed Harry as much as he did. It was a completely new feeling for him.
“Can I stay here with him?” Harry vaguely heard Draco ask Madam Pomfrey. It was only then that he realized they had reached the hospital wing.
Before replying, Harry locked the door and cast a silencing charm. Then he quickly told them the story of how his uncle sold him to this man.
When Harry didn’t pull away, Draco decided to take it a little further. He added his tongue to the mix by lightly licking the seam of the other’s lips.
Nearly forty-five minutes later, Madam Pomfrey emerged from the infirmary. Her operating robes were covered in what Draco knew was Harry's, and probably the baby’s, blood.
Harry jerked awake from the sudden screaming. In his sleep fogged mind he couldn’t quite comprehend what he heard or if it had even been real. Then there was a thump from the bathroom. He sat up so he could see over the footboard of the bed and saw his husband’s prone form on the tiled floor.
“I spent weeks in the library trying to figure what to do so you could contact me if you needed to. I wanted it to be inconspicuous but not something you’d forget. It took me several more days after that to get the damn charms right.
Draco chuckled. “I’ve always wanted to be your friend, Harry. Maybe not for the right reasons at first, but later on I really did just want to be your friend.” He answered.
“Okay. Okay, you can stay. But one word or action I don’t like and you’re gone. Do you understand me?” The blonde asked, slightly irate.
“He’s just a little nervous.” Eric explained to the crowd with a playful smile. A few people laughed.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, exasperated, when they reached the table the girls were occupying.
Harry was about to join him when he glanced at the huge bed across the room. He got nervous again. “Um… can I… um I mean I… just want to see…” Harry stammered out quietly.
Draco noticed the pendant clutched tightly in Harry's hand. He glanced down at his right ring finger to see that he wasn’t wearing his ring. He immediately knew where it was. It was sitting on the sink in his bathroom. He’d taken it off before he got in the shower that morning and forgot to put it back on. Of all the days to do so…
“So what did you do these past two weeks, that you haven’t already told me?” Harry asked as he snuggled into the blonde’s side.
As she passed it to the traumatized, younger man, she said, “Tell me, do you see a sixteen year old?”
“Everyone agreed to act like he never existed around you kids. It wasn’t something you needed to deal with growing up.” Draco replied softly.
“Now, we wait for Professor Dumbledore and Mr. Malfoy to arrive. Then, we’re going to explain to you how a male pregnancy works and answer any questions you may have.
When Draco closed the door behind them, he said, “Harry, you’re welcome here anytime you like.” Then he pointed out which three stones made the knob appear.
Draco couldn't believe that this was what Harry wanted to discuss, the future that they could have shared together, if not for Harry tearing those dreams apart when he broke Draco's heart. Draco too had dreamed of their future together. He had envisioned them both living in the refurbished Potter Manor, giving them the freedom to be who they wanted away from everyone else. Harry would go off to work every day, most likely as an Auror, and Draco would stay at home exploring both he creation of potions and rare manuscripts, something that had always interested him, but he'd been unable to dedicate any time to. He could see them both being the doting and loving parents that their adopted children would need, bringing them into their home and showing them they deserved to be loved, accepting them for who they were no matter their differences. It hurt even more to hear Harry talk about the possibilities with such longing in his voice, knowing it was no longer a feasible plan.
“Draco and I… we’re in love.” He stated simply. Then he explained the true nature of his relationship with the young Malfoy, though he chose to leave about the bit where he got pregnant. He didn’t want to put his friends into shock.
“Wow, everyone’s being so nice.” Harry marveled as Draco helped him into their carriage. Behind them, Neville, Seamus, and Dean climbed in.
Harry turned to look into the blue eyes of the other. “That was fantastic.” He panted. “I’m just a little disappointed my plan didn’t work.” A small pout formed on his lips and Draco couldn’t help but kiss it softly.
Hearing footsteps, Harlot snapped her head to her right and jumped up from the floor. She seemed happy to see him at first, but then she got a little angry. “You’re nearly forty-five minutes late! I would have left if I wasn’t so unbelievably horny!” After her short tirade, she immediately calmed down.
It was nearly a week later that Draco triumphantly held the messy, hastily written letter from Harry stating to be at his house at six o’clock the next evening. It was messy because Harry had been afraid if he didn’t write it quickly, he would chicken out before he even signed it.
Harry nodded against Draco's shoulder. “That’s all it was and it was even better than what anyone had told me.” Draco said.
Draco reached his son’s side. “Don’t tell me not-” The blonde man was cut off by the sudden realization of the person his son’s altercation was with. “
Once he’d managed to pull himself together, Draco backed away from the slightly worried man and wiped his face of the drying tears.
With the one year old held tightly in one arm and Elliot’s hand grasping the other, the dark-haired man left the room, leaving a flustered Draco behind them.
Harry ignored his godfather and moved as fast as his body would allow to stand between Sirius and his boyfriend. He put his hands on the man’s chest and forced him to take a few steps away from Draco. Sirius was confused, to say the least.
When he didn’t receive any response, Draco moved so he could see Harry’s face and was surprised to find that he was on the verge of tears. “Harry, are you alright?” At the same moment, Draco noticed the object clutched between Harry’s hands, eyes widening in realization as he gazed upon the red and gold fabric.
The two boys jumped so bad that Harry fell off Draco's lap and landed on his arse on the hard floor. He hid his reddening face behind his hands while Draco watched him in slight amusement.
“Yeah, I haven’t exactly told anybody. I didn’t think it would be a good idea to give the Slytherins anything else to make fun of me for.” Harry replied hastily.
After an agonizing wait, the curtain disappeared and he jumped up from the bed he was sitting on to stand next to Harry. ‘I’m turning soft.’ The blonde though.
Draco chuckled lightly. “Please, my last name is such a mouthful. Call me Draco. And no, I haven’t. I was with Harry waiting for him to wake up since I didn’t want him to be alone.”
Harry gently removed the paper from the item in hands and gasped when it was revealed. It was a tiny onesie of green and silver stripes. Nearly identical to the one Draco had given him last year. His breath caught in his throat.
“Homosexuality wasn’t quite as accepted then as it is now, though more so than the muggle world, but they came to the conclusion that males should have the ability to bear children. It took several years, but they came up with a ritual that would make all future conceived wizards able to carry a child. Every little bit helps, that was their thinking.
When Draco was fully seated with his balls against Harry's ass, he waited, panting at the feeling of pressure surrounding him. “A-are you alright, love?” He asked in a slightly shaky voice.
Without taking his eyes off of the bundle in Snape’s arms, Harry reached for Draco and simply said, “Glasses.” The blonde immediately grabbed them from the bedside table and handed them over.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” The blonde asked, still attempting to get close to his boyfriend… until Harry smacked him across the face.
Harry suddenly stood up to be closer to eye level and put his hands on his hips. “And how old were we?” The question was obviously completely rhetorical.
Harry took a deep, calming breath before answering. “When I was still pregnant, I thought about what it would be like raising a magical child and how much different his childhood would have been from mine.
Madam Pomfrey began waving her wand in complex patterns directed at the image of the fetus. As she finished, the bubble of light began to fade into nonexistence.
Harry attempted to laugh, but ended up yawning instead. “Y-you are old, grandpa.” He said with a sleepy chuckle. “Now shut up and give me my baby before I hurt you.”
Ethan quickly divested them of the rest of their clothing before settling on his knees between pale thighs.
A moment later, Madam Pomfrey returned with a vial that she handed to the injured boy. He drank it gratefully and sighed as nearly all of the pain melted away.
The Slytherin completely ignore the other’s outburst and pulled Harry back into another kiss, trapping him against the wall again as he did so.
Aside from that, Harry had no problems with frotting or handjobs. He even started to enjoy being on the giving end of a blowjob when he decided to wake Draco up that way one morning, something he became quite fond of doing and did nearly every morning that he woke up before the older boy.
Blue eyes rolled in their sockets and the teen replied, “Well, too bad for you.” Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a twitch of the man’s gloved left hand and noticed a decorative cane topped with a snake head tightly clutched in it. His eyes widened minutely and he had a feeling the blonde had wanted to hit him with it.
Harry could hear someone calling his name, telling him to wake up. He didn’t want to wake up though. He didn’t want to face the tragedy his life had become.
“I am a very wealthy man, Harry.” He had said. “I need, and would like to have, an heir to pass my business and wealth to but, I find myself in a very awkward position. I’m gay, so obviously marrying a woman is out of the question and I absolutely refuse to raise a bastard child.”
Harry let go of his trunk as well and wrapped his arms around Draco's torso, resting his chin against his chest and smiling up at him. “I doubt she’s half as bad as Mrs. Weasley. So I think I can handle it.”
Harry pulled his son back into a comforting hug. “You aren’t alone. Your father and I are right here with you. Plus, Grandma Cissy, Grandpa Sirius, Grandpa Remy, Grandma Molly… everyone. No one is going to leave you alone with this.”
Labor seemed to be going much faster than what was normal and even though he had been warned it could, and most likely would, happen that way, he was on the edge of panicking again.
The pile of ash on his desk drew his attention for a moment. He’d written a letter to the ministry asking them to get him out of the contract. But apparently, they thought it was a good idea. Harry thought they were just afraid of him and wanted to keep him under control somehow. This was the solution they had been looking for as restrictions would have to be placed on his wand since he was marrying a non-magical being.
Before anything else could be said, Madam Pomfrey stood from her place at the end of the bed and said, “You can put your legs down now, Harry.” He did so and with assistance from Draco, managed to get himself in a more comfortable sitting position.
“Draco, hush.” Harry admonished, but he copied his husband’s movements on the other side of their son’s head, catching sight of a second earring there. “What were you thinking?”
Downstairs, Emma found Harry in Elliot and James’ bedroom putting them down for a quick nap before dinner.
Before anyone could reply, Oliver stood from his chair and marched into the kitchen. It was silent for a few seconds before the three Potter-Malfoys heard a shout of, “Get your arse home, NOW!”
“Struggle all you want, Harry. You’ll never get free without help.” With that, the man turned away and began undressing.
“They told us that after my miscarriage and Draco's first.” Harry said with a sigh. “It doesn’t really help.”
There was silence and Draco didn’t let up on Harry until he was sure the latter wasn’t going to panic.
Draco was panting and moaning against her neck as he pumped into her harder and faster with every passing minute, despite having been exceedingly close to the edge since the moment he entered her.
The confused Hagrid looked back and forth between the two boys for a moment and asked, “Am… am I missin’ somethin’?”
Lucius chuckled darkly. “What a pity. The boy doesn’t even know his own grandfather, a high-standing member of society.”
“Keeping them clean, turning them daily… don’t you remember anything from getting Lily and Emma’s ears pierced last year?” Harry asked, flabbergasted.
“Congratulations Mr. Potter-Malfoy, Mr. Wood, it’s a girl.” Healer Carter announced as he held the small bundle of joy, still connected to Scorpius by the umbilical cord, up for both men to see.
get out of your grounding for the little stunt you pulled at my birthday party at the Weasley’s after catching that snitch?” Harry asked him, disappointment evident in his voice.
“Hello?? Earth to Draco. Are you going to continue or what?” Harry asked as he poked him with his foot again. Draco retaliated by hitting that spot again.
“Damn it.” He muttered as he pulled out his wand. A moment later he was stepping into his living room.
Harry moved toward the pair of males on the other side of the room. “It’s a muggle thing for preventing infections.” He explained. Then, suddenly worried, he asked, “Are you hurt?” He moved his wand up and down his oldest child’s body, looking for wounds in the light.
Finally he came to the conclusion that it was the way it had happened and that he didn’t know her name, or anything about her at all. In fact, he was starting think he may have fallen asleep and dreamt the entire scenario.
“The next time that prick touches you…” Draco held the pendant for a moment. “That’s all you have to do and I will do whatever I have to stop him.” He said heatedly.
Emma smiled at her patient. “That is certainly some better news. You’re here because you’ve just had a baby. You’re fifth, actually.”
Harry looked up from the baby in his arms and smiled. “Hey, Princess.” He made some space on the rocking chair he was sitting in so the young girl could sit with him. “Do you need something, Emma?”
A breathy moan passed through the sleeping Harry's lips and Draco had to stuff his free fist in his mouth to stifle a loud groan that surely would have woken Harry up and ruined his fun.
His fingers stilled as it suddenly occurred to Harry that Draco might not be as ready for another child as he wanted him to think. But he wouldn’t go so far as to secretly be using a contraceptive charm, would he?
With a quick nod to each other Professor Dumbledore left for his office and Madam Pomfrey went into her own office to change.
Draco dropped his trunk once they reached the drive. “Fine, my own mother scares me.” He answered, flailing his arms a bit as they waited for an empty carriage to pull up.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Eric started as he took a seat on Harry’s bed. “You seem happier today than usual. Excited for tomorrow?”
“You’re afraid… of being pregnant?” Harry guessed. Draco nodded and Harry tightened his hold around him. “Then why did you tell me you want to know what it’s like to have a baby?”
Draco wrapped his arms around the other and held him until they were both nearly asleep. At that point, they moved their cuddling to the bed and fell into a peaceful sleep.
Once they reached the hall, Harry stopped outside of Elliot’s bedroom and turned to look at it. Then he turned a fearful look on his blonde husband.
Realizing the stupidity of his mistake, Draco pulled Harry into his arms and spoke softly. “I am so sorry, Harry. I’m such an idiot. He wasn’t my child and I didn’t have any feelings or attachment to him. I wasn’t thinking.”
“Anyway, I have to go.” He gave his mother a swift kiss on the cheek, tousled his son’s hair, and left.
Carefully, Harry slipped his arms under Draco's knees and behind his back and slid up the wall into a standing position. He shifted his hold a bit before stepping out of the shower and into their adjoined bedroom. He laid his lover on the right side of the bed and then walked around to his side.
Draco kissed his nose before taking his hand and leaving the bathroom. He led Harry to the bed and made him sit down on it.
“I love you and I want the world to know it.” Draco replied and gave Harry's hand a small squeeze. The smile Harry gave him was dazzling and made his heart skip a beat.
The trip from the dungeons to the fourth floor seemed to last an eternity to Harry. In that time, he had three more contractions and managed to stay quiet through the first two.
Hearing his name, Draco groaned loudly and tightened the hand around Harry, stroking faster. He started kissing his way across Harry's neck when the raven tilted his head back some to look at him.
“Congratulations, boys!” The Patel twins chorused as they vacated their own carriage and walked passed the married couple.
“Alright then.” Draco gave him a bright smile as he got off the bed. He quickly kicked off his shoes and stripped down to just his shirt and boxers. Harry, already wearing hospital pajamas, scooted down the bed so he was lying down and waited for the blonde boy to re-join him.
Harry didn’t respond and left his trunk where it was without unpacking it. He purposely had put all of his clothes on top because he wanted to be ready when Draco came to get him. Then he set Hedwig’s cage on his desk, opened it, and then opened the window so she could fly if she wanted to.
In the hall, the pair ran into Narcissa and the three girls. Lyra was now asleep in the woman’s arms. Draco quickly explained the situation to his mother before they parted ways. He also asked her to put the girls to sleep with Elliot. They then continued on their way to find Healer Carter.
When he sat back up, the blood rushing from his head started making him dizzy. Nausea kicked in and he sped toward the bathroom to empty the contents of his stomach.
Draco slithered back up the lightly tanned body beneath him and resumed a playful dance with their tongues.
“’Cause, I had to go potty, but he was already in there and he was throwing up and then he started crying.” Emma explained in a rush.
Harry crawled up to what had become his side of the bed. “Stop acting like one and I won’t call you one.” Draco stuck his tongue out at him.
