The sound of a jingling bell pulled Harry out of his thoughts. He followed Draco into the tiny space. Instantly, Harry felt a whole lot warmer.
Dumbledore let Sirius rot in Azkaban instead of handing Harry to him. That was no one’s fault but his. Yet there was no sense in blaming the dead. “The stars look awfully beautiful tonight.” He says instead.
Draco looked up to meet the striking green eyes of one Harry Potter. Of course, he should have expected the man to be here. Potter was practically a Weasley, even without his hanky panky with Weaslette. Ginevra.
Draco was still asleep. More comatose than asleep, really. Madame Pomfrey agreed to come to look at him the following afternoon. “Till then, let him rest. He’ll wake up when he’s ready.”
After an aeon-long staring contest, Narcissa sighed. “May I see my son?” She handed Teddy back to him.
Harry decided at that moment that whatever happened, he would get on the sled and he would make Malfoy ride it with him. Not that the other male had any choice in the matter. What with the potion and shit.
“Like you did.” He mumbled, and he could somehow see it. Malfoy huddling in a dark corner, on the brink of death and oh so very stubborn.
“Trying something new,” Harry shrugged. Death by avalanche didn’t seem that bad, actually. Not when Malfoy was going to die with him.
The pebbly road that led to the lodge was badly lit. And very, very cold. Harry felt glad for the parka. Malfoy-gifted or otherwise.
Harry couldn’t see that happening though. Lucius and Narcissa would never willingly let their son sleep in an alleyway. Did Malfoy run from them, or from something else all-together.
He flicked his eyes towards the changing area, where Sirius was criticizing the outfit Malfoy had chosen. The black turtleneck and a green jacket, unzipped partway. He’d paired it with a pair of black slacks that Sirius was trying to replace with ripped jeans.
“I’m here to offer you protection from Death Eaters. I’m offering you shelter, food and somewhere to sleep without worrying about maggots.”
whole years there and came out fine. Draco, on the other hand, could hardly speak a word without bursting into tears. All his emotions were in shambles. He found himself flinching every time someone came near. The Dementors weren’t there anymore, but he still relived every bad thing he’d ever done. Soaked in guilt and sweat every night until he passed out. A part of him knew he deserved it. But that didn’t mean he still didn’t hate it.
“We used to have Shakshouka often, when you were little, Harry.” Remus says. “We lost a lot people in the last war, Harry. Your father didn’t do well, when someone passed. He grieves and grieves. The only things that could cheer him up was Shakshouka, and you, Harry.”
He shrugged, ’Cissa’s boy. “I think I’d rather die at my cousin’s house than an alleyway. Now let’s go before I change my mind.”
She was clearly in her element, twirling around to put her meat in one pot and seasoning the other. Molly turned to put something in the freezer when she caught Draco loitering near the entrance.
But before he could carry out any not-thought-out Foolish Action, Malfoy’s eyes fluttered open and they were suddenly as far from each other as they could get without the nausea.
Draco having a heart-to-heart with Molly because I want to get the awkwardness out asap to MAKE WAY FOR THE FALUFFF
This has been an absolute pipedream. I can't even believe I-  First fic I've ever stuck to till the end. Whew.
“I wouldn’t go as far as to say Knife Monopoly gets you laid, but yes, Knife Monopoly gets you laid.” Says Draco, coming over to rest his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco swallowed. One of the conditions of his host family was having a child his age. He really didn’t want to spend four years with either Morag
“I suppose there are exceptions here and there.” He drawls in reply. “You know Potter just as well as I do, Ginevra.” There’s a feral, knowing look shared between them that terrifies the fuck out of Harry.
Shakshouka is a family favourite and my go-to comfort food, so thought I might include that since my Harry's kinda Indian kinda Middle Eastern type idk. Also I was too lazy to find a song.
It took them a good ten minutes to get Ron away from the alcohol and get him cleaned up. He kept crying about how unfair it was that the one time Ron went to Bulgaria, Krum was in London. “It’s like they don’t want us to see each other.” He told Draco.
They were always, always shaken up by the ‘what ifs’. Possibilities weren’t something they dwelled much on after James passed.
Even after Neville leaves, Harry continues to stare down the dormitory door. He hoped that if  he stared at it long enough, maybe it would disappear. But it didn't. Which was unfair because Magic.
The owner, an elderly woman, made no move to greet or show them around. She had her face buried in an erotica novel Harry was embarrassed to admit he recognized.
Hermione and Ron came to sit with him, and Malfoy had turned to speak to Blaise. There was no one around to save Harry from his friends.
“Why are you saying all this to me? Just say thank you. It’s not hard y’ know.” Harry couldn't help it. He
“All right. All right. That’s about enough arguing for one day, don’t you think so boys?” Said Sirius, looking amused. “Draco, would you be a dear and put some pastries in the toaster?”
"Wait," Harry said, realizing something. "So what happened to those chocolates? The ones  from before?"
Harry got Ron a special seat to Krum’s New Year special match. He hoped for a fun reaction from his best friend.
"Right. That is exactly what happened." Harry stalks into the room and flounces on the hideously Home Alone themed bed that obviously belonged to Kevin Entwhistle.
Which means you will see him all the time but never actually get to ask him out because he's  mourning the loss of his beautiful wife and you're just his son's best friend's dick dad."
Fleur and Bill curled on a settee with the twins and their significant others in chairs near them. Charlie’s in a heated argument with Tonks over who gets the last chair.
he returned it. Harry thought miserably, because what were the odds Draco would want to see him again?
Harry could tell it was driving Remus up the wall too. Because Sirius wouldn’t stop blabbering about how he’d never get a toaster that fine. That everything reminded him of the toaster…
And that’s when Harry noticed something. Malfoy was straddling him. Oh Merlin, Malfoy was straddling him and Harry was enjoying it and he kind of wanted to kiss the frown off his face and all these realizations were hitting him on the head like a bell going gong, gong. It hurt his head. Or maybe Harry really had hit his head.
Harry grinned. “That’s a turtleneck. I think it might suit you.” He froze, thinking of what he had just said.
Sirius and Remus had asked all their guests to give them a bit of cloth during the wedding. After, they sewed them together to make the most amazing quilt of all. Harry’s mum and dad gave them a piece fabric with the pattern of a deer and doe charmed to jump from seam to seam. Baby Harry gave them a gift too - white cloth with tiny, colourful handprints on them.
Her voice is soft, but stern. She sits next to him, not quite touching. Molly Weasley is a comforting presence, though.
Sirius shakes his head. These were the morals drilled into their brains before they could walk. The morals that hunted them. The morals that kept them up at night.
Draco tries. He tries to look at him with those wide, mismatched eyes, but he looks away at the last minute.
“I would like to see my son,” her face wore no expression, but her eyes gave her away. “Please.” Desperation. Raw and painful.
Sirius let go, running that hand through his hair. He liked to consider himself a man of economic movement after all.
At least, Jacques, Marcel and Abram weren't arseholes. But unfortunately, that just added to  Malfoy's appeal.
than sleepy, but still. Mrs Weasley had asked him to help out. And since he was so susceptible to doing favours for matronly figures, he just had to help out.
There was nothing Harry could say to make him feel better because Harry didn’t know. He’d never had parents. He’d never needed to live up to impossible expectations. He’d never…
Had Draco a wand he would have Disapparated right there and then. Fuck his pride. But since he hadn’t, he was forced to smile when Mrs Weasley greeted him.
“Molly, please. And just thin enough you can still taste the crunch if you would. Ron doesn’t like it when they're too thick.”
“No, but we still need those clothes.” It was probably better not to question Parv. She could be very snappy when she wanted to.
"Hullo Draco," he said, wiping something off his cheek. "I hope you don't mind me borrowing this kitchen for a while. It's not like Sirius makes anything but toaster pastries anyway."
Then the Floo flared. “Oh, that must be Arthur. Won't be a while now,” she patted his shoulder before rushing out.
Sirius sighs. “I promise, you won’t have to wait twelve years, Prongslet. He left to protect us. He said he doesn’t want to be the reason any of us get hurt.”
Malfoy made eye-contact with Harry who turned back to bitterly sorting through sweaters. This was going to be a long day.
Great. Once Harry had feelings for someone (and figured it out) his brain would stop at no ends to make him look like a blubbering fool. Like when he liked Cedric and Cho at the same time and fucked up with both of them.
Or it just might’ve been the fact that Harry expected there to be more talking and teasing between them. Even after the whole potion fiasco.
.” The words felt foreign on his tongue. Sirius wouldn’t admit it, but he was hoping Andromeda had something to do with the alley boy.
And all three of them looked at Harry, and he realized they were waiting for his answer. He’d been a bit shocked by Draco’s whole ‘queer aunt’ thing. He wondered if he meant what he said, or if it was just more forks and spoons. Metaphors and riddles weaved together to boggle Harry’s mind.
Remus sat on the ottoman across him. There were hours left until the sun would even set, get his husband looked as ghastly as ever.
Guest entry by Shakshouka and a tacky old quilt full of memories. Also Jamie Oliver and the Cradocks XD
"Yes." Potter laughed again. "Oh." Draco felt a bout of unwelcome warmth bubble in his chest. Oh, Merlin. He thought he’d gotten over that stupid crush years ago.
Everyone was starting to dance again, so Harry and Draco decided to go out on the veranda for some quiet. Except-
She hugged Harry when he came near. “You look awesome Potster. I’m so glad you decided to wear that after all.”
"I'll get it," announced Ron, taking a handful of peanuts. "You think owls like nuts?" He goes to open the window.
“I find the best way to get rid of your Wrackspurts is to face them head-on. They’re quite nice once you get to know them.” Luna had advised sagely.
Harry never really knew where he stood in Malfoy’s life. Just that  he’d sent one of those paper cranes to Harry, almost a week after they started eighth year. After a week of dodging each other like bludgers.
Dean, Neville and Ron bust into the room. The latter of which was covering his eyes. "Harry, I hope you're decent."
Harry nodded. It had been weird. He tried to think of Hermione and Ron’s reaction. It didn’t look good.
And here he was now, head buried deep into a thick tome. Sitting cross-cross on the carpet. Ghost of a smile on his face.
Needless to say, when Sirius finally stumbled into the kitchen, he was not happy to find the remains of an explosion instead of his favourite muggle appliance.  Oh, and he did not laugh at the burnt toaster pastries stuck to the ceiling like they hoped he would.
"You're pretty good at this doorman thing, Potter." He hums approvingly. "Aren't you coming  in? Weasley told me you and Longbottom got kicked out."
It was just the skull now. The snake had receded into it the moment Voldemort died. Draco tried to convince himself it was gone. That this was all a bad dream.
Draco who was not speaking to him. Draco who was probably revolted by the kiss. Draco who was only standing next to him because of the potion.
"Then don’t ask him to help, Harry." Says Ron, dragging Harry towards the door. "Leave  Dean to deal with his soppy love life and you and I can go down to the pitch. Ginny's  waiting." He adds.
“Good.” And somehow that single word was worth more than all the praise he’d ever received. “If you’ve managed to earn dislike, you can earn everyone’s love too. I want to help you learn from your mistakes and grow up to be a better person.”
Malfoy yelps and leans back. All of a sudden, they were tumbling off the hill - also faster than the latest Nimbus model. The sled had long disappeared and all Harry could see was snow. Snow spinning around him as he and Malfoy rolled down, smushed together inside a gigantic snowball.
Yet hearing from the mouse is easier than from the lion. Because the axe tells a different story than of the tree’s.
“Excuse me, what?” Said Malfoy, who hadn’t spoken a word after they left the infirmary. Harry imagined it was because he missed the gauzy pillows. “Boycott Christmas? Why would you want to do that?” He sounded genuinely concerned for Padma’s mental health. Which was funny because Padma looked a bit miffed by it.
"Right." Ron's ears are red enough to be mistaken for hair. "Thanks Harry. I'll see you?" The  way he left the room could only be described as 'skedaddling'.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Potter said softly, going around him and pulling his hair into a knot. Draco felt the ribbon being tied securely around his hair.
She practically glowed. “You bet your fine arse I did!” Ginny plops herself down on the floor, lying down with her head on Luna’s lap. The latter immediately starts braiding.
Zabini plops down behind Neville, and snakes (ha!) a hand around the Gryffindor’s waist. He  rests his chin on the shorter boy’s head. Neville smiled like a love-struck idiot. Because he
“Potter.” Draco decided to play it cool. “Fancy seeing you here.” Yup. He was playing it cool. Definitely not raking his eyes over Potter’s physique. He just so happened to notice that Potter was wearing the ugliest purple shirt ever. Play it cool. Play it cool.
And there was a real, proper sofa, and a real, proper mop of white-blond hair peeking out of a real, proper blanket.
His body moved of his own accord. Like his mind had been shoved aside to let his heart take the reins. Sirius scoffed. As if that ever lead to anything good. Gryffindorism had its downsides.
“Don’t worry about that,” Draco whispered back to him, his breath hot on Harry’s neck. It made the hairs on his neck stand.
Sure enough, the french doors that were supposed to lead them to solitude were lined with mistletoe. And Harry had a feeling it wasn't the normal type either.
Draco opened his eyes, blue and grey eyes sparkling. “Of kissing you? No.” He looked down, pressing Harry’s hands between his. “I’m afraid of what’s going to happen after.”
“Accio Christmas every girl and boy.” Mrs Weasley and Potter sang in chorus. Potter spun him around a couple more times. Mrs Weasley shook her hands from side to side. They were laughing, having fun.
“He’ll forgive you.” Says a voice from behind him. Luna, thankfully not upside-down this time, smiles at him. “He thinks he was protecting you. Don’t let his sacrifice go to waste. Go talk to him.”
The bruises kept forming faster than Sirius could heal them. Impacts from dark curses, constant falls and accidents.
Harry felt arms wrap around him, and then a thank you whispered into his neck. He felt moisture next. Tiny droplets wetting the crook of his neck.
The aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts left the old school reduced to a pile of rubble. Harry was one of the students who offered to stay and help with repairs.
Harry considered closing his eyes and screaming his head off until they reached inevitable death. But then he realized that Malfoy was
Remus had a lovely glow and Sirius looked terribly smug. Harry could already tell they’d be great parents. “Yeah, he’s with his mum until we can fix this place up for him.”
either. Stupid, self-centred bastards. Eying him up with their slimy little eyeballs, like they would like nothing more than to drag him into Azkaban in shackles. Which they'd already done, mind you.
Draco crinkled his eyes in the widest smile, but there was something else in his eyes. “He’s lucky to have you.”
“Right.” She says, still smiling. “I’ll get the paperwork sorted now. And remember I’ll be dropping in to check on from time to time. If I’m not available, it’ll have to be Wimbledon I’m afraid.”
.” He insisted as Sirius cast charms over him. “I just slipped.” He muttered, smoothing his shirt. Wait, no. That was
“Its okay,” Harry says, the same way Sirius did when he had nightmares. He’d place an arm around him and sit with Harry until the shaking stopped.
It was weird to be sitting on the floor of his room, folding clothes with Malfoy. Weider still, was walking into the Great Hall with him. Having Malfoy sit with him at Gryffindor. Him eating his potatoes like it was the most natural thing to be doing right now. Well, it sort of was, considering it was dinner time but- why wasn't he panicking over the whole potion thing?
Ron laughed, reaching for the bowl of popcorn. "It is if it's you we're talking about, mate. Boy Who Lived and all that shite tend to get in the way of things like 'normality' if you know what I mean."
“You don’t use forks for soup.” His breathing was haggard. Harry thought he might faint, from the way he stumbled and teetered. Forks and spoons and soup and magic.
He was more like a book than ever. Appealing on the outside, yes, but the true wonder to be found within its pages.
Draco went back to chopping. He only had a couple more carrots left. It was calming, to say the least, this chopping of carrot. It reminded him dearly of potions class. Something familiar he could hold on to.
Sirius almost didn’t recognize her. Her blond-and-black hair was pulled up in a half-hearted bun, mixing the two colours. Her normally youthful face had wrinkles and dark circles around her eyes. Dressed in all black. In mourning.
Remus whispered the name to his ear, like they were sixteen again and sitting together in the Gryffindor common room. Sirius could almost see that red armchair. It never quite fit two, but they sat in it anyway. They often whispered like that to annoy James, who hated being left out. It was just pointless murmuring back then.
" Ron replied. "Don't worry, I'll let you kiss his arse a couple times after I win." It was a bit scary how like Malfoy he sounded then.
“It’s hard to find out something you’ve been taught by people you love is wrong. It hurts when the real fork comes back to stab you.”
“So,” Draco said, leaning back against Harry - a bit like they did that morning, except they weren’t sledding down the hill of death this time. “What exactly do you and the Patil twins do in your little… Indian club?”
“There.” The man has the ugliest smile. He’s addressing the court, very much like the villain in a play who monologues his greatest achievements. “The boy is guilty. Should be put in Azkaban with the rest of them.” Put
Draco took a deep breath. “I can’t do this anymore. Being so close to you these past days has only made it worse. I thought maybe it would go away but it didn’t and I really can’t take it anymore.” See? Draco hated him.
“I’ve got to get some shopping done.” Harry agreed. He needed to get something for Draco. It would be rude not to give your Significant Annoyance anything for Christmas. Especially after you somehow manage to develop feelings for them.
Harry runs a hand through his hair. It's one of those very rare days he managed to convince  Dean to go outside for 'nature sketching' or some shit. And here was Ron, wasting precious no-Dean time. "Do you have a better idea, Ron?"
Narcissa left at the stroke of midnight. “I must go,” she had said, voice a winter draught once more. “Thank you for letting me see my son.”
The bite might have been part of the reason Draco decided to leave. Lucius and Narcissa might have been horrible people, being Voldemort’s disciples and all, but they were Draco’s parents. Ones whom he loved more than life. Their son not being pureblood anymore might have been a hard blow for them.
Draco didn’t wait for any comforting words. He scurried up the stairs and locked himself in Weasel’s old room.
Sirius made sure Narcissa wasn’t going to try anything before he went and picked up Teddy from the highchair. The baby’s hair immediately changed from teal to black. Sirius smiled at that. He looked just like baby Harry.
The rain made his hair stick to his forehead and Sirius couldn’t help but wince at the fresh cut on his lips. They were turning blue from the cold.
Draco rolled his eyes but still followed Harry out of the makeshift infirmary Millicent had set up on her side of the room. She was very committed to becoming a Healer, it seemed. Enough to set up a mini-hospital while on a ski trip.
Harry half-expected to see tuffs of blond hair peeking under the tacky quilt. There was no one in the living room, though. It hurts him more than it should.
Sirius wanted to strangle whoever made this boy so brutally cynical in the worst way. “There’s no catch. I just... I just want you to…” Live a happy life? Not have to look back every step? Was this Sirius seeing himself in the boy and selfishly wanting to rescue him to make up for his lost childhood? He faltered. Where was his Gryffindor bravery when he needed it?
He shrugged and walked to the hot tub, Harry following, stunned. Draco Malfoy, not putting up a fight? This week just kept getting weirder and weirder.
When they made it down, they nearly crashed into Pansy and Lavender. The two girls were in the middle of a glaring match because they were both wearing the same sexy santa dresses (which even Harry was sure did not count as semi-formal. Maybe).
The boy, it was starting to get difficult to call him that, pursed his lips. “You understand me, don’t you? No, it’s okay, don’t leave.” He dragged long fingers through the fur, almost tugging. A silent beg.
Madame Pomfrey said they could leave that evening with the very comforting assurance that the potion would wear off after around 6 days. Which would make it the day after Christmas. AFTER.
“Hey, Harry.” Ron had grinned at him. “I managed to convince Mrs. Dabney to let us bake in her kitchen.”
Draco seems to be staring him. Harry doesn’t acknowledge the look. “I didn’t know about magic until Hagrid kicked down our door and handed me my letter. My aunt and uncle always acted like I was a freak. At least I finally knew why.”
“The inventor of toaster strudel will hear about this. Yes, yes, we know the drill.” The price of interrupting was Harry being pelted by magical throw-pillows.
The memories come to him in patches, and not in the proper order, like he’d had one too many bottles of firewhiskey before bed.
that struck his heart though. Someday could mean tomorrow, but it could also mean thirty years later. Harry didn’t think he wanted someday to come.
"Actually," Draco dragged his hands along Harry's robes. "I was thinking of something more fun to pass the time."
Draco leads them to the Rose Bedroom, on the topmost floor. The only thing above this floor was the rooftop, where Harry liked to climb when he had nightmares.
Draco snorts from beside him. He crosses his arms, hiding the ‘D’ Harry knew to be on his baby blue Weasley sweater. “This Christmas party is so cliché.” He drawls.
“Must you stride so fast?” Harry said when he caught up. He didn't have much far to go but still felt like whinging a bit. Just to get under Malfoy’s nerves.
It didn’t look odd, Draco sitting on the floor with them. The three of them huddled around the coffee table, which was just a pallet box turned upside down. Remus enlarged and thrown one of Walburga’s lacy coasters onto it to make it 'look pretty'.
Harry slipped his orange Chudley Cannons sweater (courtesy of Ron) over his shoulders and shrugged his trousers off. He folded them neatly before stepping into the warm waters. Wearing those swim trunks over his pants that morning was the best decision he’d probably made in like, ever.
There was a silence, Malfoy hesitating. Thinking before he leapt. "Can you help me? Please?" He added for good measure.
Harry saw Seamus and Dean sneaking out to hang some of the biscuits on the tree (the ones where the glass bit looked like penises) and Hannah running after them with more normal-looking ones.
Harry had made little snowflakes and tiny trees on his. They looked colourful, if not completely unintelligible.
Draco was always lovely. Always svelte. Gossamer-like features softened by pale, cloud-like curls. Eyes that Harry could never figure if they were blue or grey.
Harry didn’t regret staying back to help repair Hogwarts. It was his first home. In a way, he kinda owes it to the place. He does, however, feel bad about not visiting his godfather.
Draco glared up at him bitterly. “Come to hark at me, have you? I’m in your life debt now. D’you want me to get on my hands and knees for it?”
Thanks for sticking with me. This was a rollercoaster of procrastination and feverishly looking up the wiki at 3 AM. Hope you loved this chapter as much as you did the others ❤︎
Right now, Draco’s pressed behind him, arms hugging Harry's middle so tight he could barely breathe. Harry thought it would be a nice way to die. Death by hug. He'd succumb to that sort of end willingly.
“Sit down here,” she leads him to sit on the thankfully orange-free bed. “Listen here, Draco. And listen carefully, okay?”
Sirius and Draco knew the names of each and every room; The Rose Bedroom. The White Hall. Magnolia Alcove.
Harry, who was the one trying to sleep in the first place, had a much harder time falling asleep after that little episode. But he tried very hard, seeing as they had a whole bus ride waiting for them near the Cairngorms. Whose idea was it to go somewhere that far anyway?
The hair? The air of aristocracy they carried? Was it their looks? Well, whatever it was, it helped Sirius figure out that the shivering boy huddling in an alleyway was a Black.
Lavender passed by and whacked Harry on the head. “You still plan on doing those heteronormative Christmas stuff, Harry darling?”
“But I’ve already cut the all,” Draco said woefully. He looked up to find Potter had vanished. Probably gone to tell Weasel so they could laugh- “Ack!”
Beside him, Draco grumbles something about not wanting another prank gift from the twins. Last year, Fred and George gifted him a bottle of Sleekeazy's. It made Draco’s hair go a bright, Weasley ginger. It was their best prank so far.
Harry nearly had a heart attack when Draco’s face sneered at him from Ron’s shirt. “What the fuck, Ron?” He glanced at Draco and Hermione who were trying to hold in their laughter. Then he noticed Blaise Zabini near the french doors, wand pressed between his lips like a cigarette. Apparently Zabini thought he looked very cool when he did that.
Harry grins widely. "You're dating Blaise!” He exclaims. “Of course, you are. Who else would love both Herbology and Quidditch?”
The next morning, Draco had yet to wake up. Remus’ explanation did little to help ease  Sirius’ conscience.
And now, Draco was asking Harry to help make it, for Moony and Padfoot. Because they deserved nothing but the best.
In the meantime, he should probably work on an escape plan before he got spotted by any redheads. Really, he’d be doing both parties a favour by leaving!
Harry huddled deeper into his (Draco’s) baby-blue-with-tiny-sheep jacket. He glanced up from inside it, making sure to protect his nose from the unforgiving cold.
About the rage that bubbled in him when they hauled Draco at his feet. The way the blond seemed to be breaking apart. Tearing at the seams. The all too familiar dissociation in his eyes when he looked Harry in the eye.
the wrong house, why would that terror of a portrait of Mrs Black be hanging right over the fireplace? And was she
"It's not really a sleepover, Seamus." Harry grits his teeth as his shin was attacked yet again. He made a mental reminder never to sit next to Dean. Ever.
“You can't expect to become a saint as soon as you find out you're on the wrong path. Think about this;
He pulled Harry’s trunk close and sat down on the floor, flabbergasting Harry. Malfoy looks up at him. “Well?” He raised an eyebrow. “Make yourself useful and fold what I give you. We don’t have all day you know.”
When his torso started to rip like literal ribbons, Sirius hardly noticed. Draco’s white shirt was soaked in blood, covering every inch until you couldn’t call it a white shirt anymore.
“Ernie and I just had a lovely soak in the hot tub.” Blaise Zabini said conversationally. “It’s just there on the deck, under the stars. It’s warm, Draco, and so, so
“I know this isn’t the best time, but you’re going to be leaving in a couple of days and we… Remus and I… we’d like you to be his godfather, Harry."
The sound of leaves rustling outside lulled him into a dreamless sleep. Better, perhaps, than what you get from the potion. And believe Draco when he says he’s had plenty of those the last few years.
Harry could tell that Draco was going to launch into a full-blown Hermione-style lecture with the addition of Potter-bashing, so he gave in. To his impulses.
Sirius cleared his throat, never one to enjoy silence. “The dog that’s been helping you… he’s err... he’s my dog.”
“-can’t believe the both of you!” Sirius, now cleaned up, thank Merlin, dragged a hand down his face. He lifted the spells off them.
"I was going to insult you but right now I'm really interested in whatever this knife monopoly  is," Malfoy said.
Dean doesn’t reply, but Harry knows he’s probably smothering a laugh. Harry thinks this is a good chance to ask Dean again. He figures another try wouldn’t hurt. Much.
It put him in a new light. He wasn’t the prat Harry liked to complain about anymore. He seemed less and less like a stick-up-arse bigot, and more and more like a
by Josephine Lyson.  “I’ll have you know I spent two hours sucking up to a hundred-year-old witch for this.” He’d told her. “All for Rosie.”
Harry didn’t know how, but he knew Malfoy just looked at him the same moment Harry did. They were knee-deep in huge trouble.
Harry sighed. The last time he and Malfoy had been in a lavatory together, Harry cut him into ribbons and let him stain the floor red. Now, it was the walls that bled. His mind started to wonder if Malfoy really wasn’t bothered by the bathroom and the blood, or if he’d been pretending.
Harry drags a hand across his face. His heart pounds against his chest and something pulses in his head. He doesn’t want to feel this pathetic.
Yes, it was dysfunctional. Yes, Draco used to be an absolute dick but now he’s trying to differentiate forks from spoons, and he’s got a beautiful way of expressing gratitude.
"Is it true you went down on Krum after Fleur’s annual Fête Nationale party?" It must be a  trick of light, because Malfoy looks fairly pink-cheeked.
“Now,” Sprout waved a bottle filled with the draught in a gloved hand. “We absolutely cannot let it touch your skin. Otherwise-”
Harry remembered how he was in sixth year. Paler than a poltergeist and colder than death. Apprehension was always in his eyes. Always skipping meals and staying in the library until sunrise. Taking the company of a ghost.
Harry pulled the snowglobe out, hoping it would be enough to convey the words that had died on his tongue. He watched with bated breath as Draco tore the paper, and then with his hands clenched as the magic did its thing.
, but it was just a hastily scribbled “I’m OK.” Like that made everything better. It made Harry look like a huge jerk is what it did.
“I knew it was a bad idea – watching Mean Girls.” Draco grumbles, struggling in Harry’s grasp. “Quit it Potty. I’ll throw actual toaster strudel at you.”
Sirius remembered to lock the door behind him before he changed back. He smelled ironically enough like a wet dog. He hoped he’d be able to shower and sneak out again before Remus woke up.
Harry almost replied with the same thing, when he remembered Draco told him his family celebrated Yule. “Happy Yuletide.”
“Seriously, Potter.” Drawled Malfoy. “Unless you plan on getting concussed, I suggest not bringing swim trunks. The lakes will be frozen over, you know.”
Sirius wondered what his godson’s reaction would be if Draco was gone by morn. Gone like a dream. A dream that turns into a nightmare when you wake up.
When he got no reply, Draco turned around and froze, dropping a smoking stick on his arm. He winced and Sirius had to physically restrain himself from pulling the boy close to him.
Harry stared in wonder as a tiny little baby giggling in Sirius and Remus’ arms. A woman stood at the side, grinning at the couple.
Harry blushed - partly because Ron was right and partly because everyone was staring at his sweater now. It was the Chudley Cannons one Ron gave him for his birthday and Harry thought he'd got rid of it, but somehow it ended up in the bottom of his trunk. Draco had used a sticking charm to attach a mirror to the front.
Harry and Dean were alone in their dormitory – which was something that happened way too  much, considering how many others they shared the room with.
Harry nodded vigorously, half curious and the other half wincing from how tight Sirius was gripping his shoulder.
Sirius found the boy huddled near the unlit fireplace when he came down to get milk for Teddy. He was muttering something about not being able to say goodbye. He looked so terribly distressed. “I do Sirius. I do need to thank you, and I need to give back.”
“Harry!” Teddy giggles when Harry swoops him up. Remus gives him a grateful smile, glad to have his ankles back.
When he walked back to the living room, the blonds hunched over a herbology book. Their eyes puffed red and Remus sniffled a bit, but Sirius decided they were okay.
At least he got to see Malfoy gawking at all the muggle stuff. He’d had to drag him away from the traffic light because
"Relax Ron," Harry hiccupped. Even in his drunk state, Harry was not about to let Ron blurt out his not-so-big secret. "Malfoy and I are just playing a- hic- good old game of -hic- knife  monopoly. Right Malfoy?"
He knew what the soup with fork part was, Draco’s impossible task, but the knife? What was he trying to say? Did the death eaters hurt him? Was Draco not one of them after all?
And Sirius had replied so kindly, telling Harry he and Moony were glad he was okay. That Teddy missed him very much. That they understood that he needed space and that their door was always open for him when he was ready.
"Hey, Harry did you find Krum's- oh my gods what the bloody hell is going on. Which one of  you killed the other?" Ron screamed. “I knew this would be a bad idea! What with your crush on-“
The other side of the room was tamer. A single poster of the Weird Sisters was hung above the bed. Well, their faces were replaced with those of the seven Weasley siblings, and Potter right in the middle.
“Draco disappeared halfway through the party. We thought he went up to play with his friends, but all of them were downstairs. They hadn’t seen him. We looked everywhere, and I… I found him in the basement.”
“Alright, enough of that.” Sirius interrupted them before a major row could commence. “If I have to punish someone, I’ll be punishing the both of you. Right now I gotta focus on finding some light.”
It was a medium-sized room with two beds on either side. One half of the room was covered from head to toe in bright orange Chudley Cannons memorabilia. Even on the bloody
"Well, if not straight, Seamus is probably taken." Dean babbles. "I mean, who can resist an arse like that?"
Ron had been remarkably calm about the entire ordeal. “She’ll get over it.” He’d said sagely, patting his shoulder. They talked no more of it after.
Sirius was in the living room, bouncing Teddy on his lap. Remus was in the kitchen, making Shakshouka.
Somehow Parvathi and Lavender managed to convince Mrs Dabney and Luanne to spend the night at their relative’s house. Obviously so they could throw a party.
“You go first.” Harry said weakly. He’d rather have his heart crushed first, rather than lay his feelings bare and have them walked on.
Harry could hear his heart doing somersaults inside his chest, ever so often crashing against his rib cage. The old Draco Malfoy wouldn’t do that. He’d probably recite a stiff ‘thank you speech’ memorized age 5.
All the others were already on the hills, just tiny figures skating or skiing or sledding. If they figured it out so easily, why on earth was Harry struggling? Malfoy too. He was supposed to be the smart one in this relationship. Oh Merlin, maybe Harry’s obliviousness was rubbing off on him.
Hermione waved them over to the snack table. “Can you guys watch Ron for a few minutes? Millie asked me to dance with her.” Mione was wearing a sparkly red dress that ended just below her knees, paired with heels that had Christmas lights twirled around her legs. There were some lights braided into her hair too.
Harry pressed his lips against Draco’s, gently at first, but then his emotions got the better of him and suddenly Draco was kissing back with just as much enthusiasm.
Harry choked. Hermione should be banned from making jokes. Especially ones related to testicles. It just wasn’t good for Harry’s poor heart. Not good at all.
Sirius makes a face and goes after them, and by default, Remus does too. “Good riddance,” Tonks says poshly when Sirius leaves. She’s doing a spiffing impression of him. “That man’s worse than a PTA parent. Worst co-parent of the year.” Then she shudders. “Oh Merlin, he
What Harry is going to do this time, is not going to be stupid. Because it’s going to work. Operation Deamus was a go!
He snorted. “I’d ask my godfather what the fuck was going on. You know, like someone with half a brain would?” Like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“Mum have you seen…” The music stopped dramatically when Ginny Weasley walked in. Draco froze, eyes wide as the girl turned hateful eyes at him.
Mind made up, he went into the kitchen. The packet of homemade chamomile and lavender tea caught his eye. Sirius knew Moony liked a cup of that after a particularly depressing day, or a bad full moon. It helped with anxiety and insomnia which Sirius knew his beau had a bad case of.
“I am not my mother, and I am not my father either. I’m sick of being told what to do. Made felt like everything I say is wrong. I didn't want to be defined by their actions… blamed for their mistakes...So I ran away.”
He smiled tentatively. Draco’s face was a soft pink, probably from the cold. His hair was mussed up from wearing the hat, and his lips were just a little blue. Harry wished he could’ve stopped that happening. He found himself wishing he could prevent winter from giving Draco the shivers.
Harry didn’t want to think about Draco, because thinking of Draco made him think about Malfoy Manor.
Of course, the resemblance was uncanny, even though ‘Cissa only had blonde hair because of albinism. Pureblood breeding did that sometimes. It created a motive too, for the boy to run away. Lucius Malfoy being a Death Eater and all.
“I mean, don’t you think it’s a bit excessive, calling each other by our last names? Especially after this particularly life-threatening event.”
Dean chucks Neville's Hippogriff-feather pillow at Harry's head. He's good at throwing,  which Harry thinks is really unfair, for someone who doesn’t play Quidditch anymore.
They were working on repairing the first-floor bathroom, which turned out to be a more difficult ordeal than Harry would’ve expected. Even with magic!
“Move over losers, I have a Gryffindor to snog.” And boy, did Zabini know how to snog. Harry almost wished he was Neville.
“And you’re a git. What’s new?” Harry grinned. This, he could handle. “It's getting dark. We should head back inside.”
“I don't mind at all!” Harry said, a bit too loud. Pansy and… was that MacDougal? snickered from a corner of the room.
of all people, were building a gingerbread mansion, while Padma, Ron and Theo were squirting icing on some of the biscuits. Harry imagined they were in around the same state as the stained dick ones.
“Harry!” Molly Weasley pulled Potter into her chest, effectively depriving him of oxygen. Potter looked utterly squashed by the time she let go. “Here to help out?” She asks, eyes twinkling.
It probably was. Harry really needed to learn to think before he leaps. Or yanks blankets in this case. Impulses. Impulses.
He tiptoed over to the figure, accidentally got mud on the new-looking burgundy rug (which he felt pretty bad for), and pulled (more like roughly yanked) the blanket off.
The rain drizzled on around them as Sirius watched the boy eat his meal, one hand stroking his sleek black fur. He was so much like Harry. They were probably around the same age.
Longer than usual chapter for y'all because I love you. Also I can't believe I wrote three chapters without a single curse word in them? Amazing. Well, two actually, because Sirius swore in this one. Still a record for me.
The memory of helping a half-asleep Draco into his pajamas was next. Harry could feel the other boy’s milky flesh even then. Draco’s head on his shoulder as Harry tired his level best to unbutton his jumper from the awkward angle. The smell of salted butterscotch and chocolate that occasionally drifted from Draco’s skin made Harry too delirious to focus anyhow.
…Not have time to figure out an alternative and stand there looking like a quacking duck. Of course, he went with option B.
“You're right. What you did cannot be excused. You did earn the hate.” Every sentence made him want to bury himself six feet under. “You’ve been punished for what you have done.”
“But what if I keep going back and saying the things I’ve been saying. I still find myself thinking the bigoted things my father drilled into me and it makes me feel so awful…”
It bubbled, steam curling in the frosty air. The tub was empty and it looked so, so inviting. The warm air seemed to swirl around Harry - beckoning him. It was tantalizing.
Seamus' eyes lit up. "Oh, okay. It's fine then. Bye." The Irishman scampered away faster than Neville did when he got owls from You Know Who. Harry cringed. Probably should have stuck with ‘Mystery Boyfriend’.
Draco finally spoke. After what felt like eternity and a half, he’d said, “What are you doing, Harry?” It was barely above a whisper, and the words turned to clouds of vapour in the winter air. They disappeared into the night sky, as ethereal as the person who’d spoken them.
It’s tempting, because Ginny often has brilliant ideas. But at the same time, she was also one of those who knew who Harry liked. There was no doubt Ginny would try set them up again the moment Harry came within a ten feet radius of her. Thus, Harry was avoiding her, for now. You couldn't hide from Ginevra Weasley for long.
Sirius pulled him in for a hug. Worry was an emotion they felt constantly. It may be for Harry. For their relationship or even the war.
The snow-capped towers of Hogwarts were fast asleep. All except the tallest, of which a single window shone bright with orangey light.
) she’s been hanging out with him. And well, it’s not like she’s bad company. The opposite, actually.
Presently, they walked down one of the snow covered streets. Warmly lit shops illuminated the otherwise monochrome district. There were wreaths on every door, and ornaments of every colour. Christmas lights hung from door to door.
If there was a word for someone who did things without proper thought, then that would probably describe Harry right about now.
That afternoon, Sirius took them shopping because ‘Harry dressed like a granny and Draco didn’t have a change of clothes’.
Harry nearly hugged him. But he didn't. Because Draco was in the shower and was most assuredly naked and Harry didn’t like to think what would happen if he saw a fly naked Draco. “Merlin, you brilliant creature!”
“You got that right, ‘lil Red.” and judging by the look on Ron’s face, he did not like the new nickname.
Nineteen-year-old Martha Archibald cast Imperio on two muggles and forced them to kill each other while she watched. The one to cast the second Imperio was found to be her father, Luther Archibald.
It felt a bit like cutting dragon liver if he was being honest. A bit more orange, and with less blood.
Draco appeared, hopefully, to stop them before one of them ripped the other’s arms off, which Pansy threatened to do. Among menaces such as using said arms to hit Blaise on the head. Multiple times.
His cousin sat at the edge of the bed. She brushed a tentative hand against his bandaged cheek. Draco stirred, but didn’t wake. Narcissa let out a choked sob. “I’m sorry, darling.”
Harry sighed and went to pick up the package from his trunk. He tried to ignore Malfoy hovering behind him and tore the paper away. The green fabric was soft to the touch, with a faint shimmer to it. The edges were lined with golden thread and there were intricate spirals drawn across the whole thing.
Neville is sprawled on the floor, surrounded by Quidditch manuals. Apparently, his mystery boyfriend was really into the sport.
Ron leaps up and starts throwing stunning spells at Harry, shouting something about how he should be on Ron's side. Ernie watches the two best friends, mouth a thin, disapproving line.
Y'all. I know it's been thirteen days, but I admit I didn't start writing this chapter until yesterday, lol. Enjoy?
“What’s this?” He fingered the baggie, looking at Sirius expectantly. Like he should start talking any minute now.
Draco followed the red-headed woman down the path, all the while trying not to collapse under the weight of Ginny’s shopping. The cheating bint was Levitating his trunk, and therefore had no trouble of the sort.
Come to think of it, James would be fuming right about now. About Dumbledore’s stupid plans that put Harry in near-death situation and the likes.
Harry knows that sort of dramatic behaviour always made his friend smile. Even if Dean  wouldn’t admit it, he loved theatrics as much as Harry did. It was one of the things they did  on Harry & Dean Nights… along with boy talk and baking cupcakes.
“No chocolate until after dinner,” Remus and Andromeda say at the same time. They both start laughing.
After a bit more shopping (during which Draco forced him to buy a frame for his glasses. “Consider it an early Christmas present if you must.”) they headed back inside. Ron told them Hermione had disappeared with Mille.
Remus didn’t have dark circles around his eyes anymore. He didn’t look back after every step and he didn’t mind when Sirius jumped on his back whilst cooking.
"Sorry Harry, but it’s really important I find out exactly what the etymological root of the word 'Quidditch' is." Neville doesn’t look up from the tome he’s reading.
He tried to sound nonchalant, but Draco’s voice cracked at the end. He lowered his head as tears of shame threatened to escape.
“Draco,” Harry said, trying to get rid of the funny punching feel in his gut. “It’s so much fun to say. Draco, Draco, Draco.”
“I believe everyone deserves a second chance.” Says Molly Weasley. “Yes, even the worst of people should be allowed to better themselves. And I don’t think you fall into the ‘worst’ category.”
He’d been given a chance to start over, with a family that cared for him. Why should Draco be any different? Sirius was sure his parents would have been part of Voldemort's little coterie had they been alive. Would that have changed anything to the Marauders? He liked to think not.
Draco’s face was a deep red, probably from staying under the hot water for too long. “Still want me to fuck off?”
It was always warmer in the corners, he remembered Lily telling him once. Or had she meant something else by 90 degrees?
The sock part was true though. Ron might find sweaty Krum stockings if he dug deep  enough. They weren't hard to miss. Very radioactive green with purple polka-dots type.
The reasons might be a bit obscure at times, like why Draco promptly collapsed on him when Sirius opened the door, but they always reveal themselves. All in good time.
Harry points at the mini Snape figurine perched on the Christmas tree, and then to Pansy and Blaise, who seemed to have come to a compromise. They were hanging the lights over the fireplace. “Still think this is a cliché Christmas?”
Sirius watched in horror as three great claw-marks scratched themselves on Draco’s arm. The work of a Hippogriff, no doubt.
“I can’t be sure.” He’d said, barely above a whisper. “It doesn’t look like him.” Speaking seemed to pain him.
The carrots had a leathery texture. Draco always though they all came smooth and round. They also had these long, green stalks protruding from their heads. Perhaps this was a different type of carrot. He tried to push the knife into it, but the dratted vegetable kept rolling away. Draco held onto one end of the carrot and pressed the knife into it. Yes! Finally.
Malfoy believed what he was taught because they’d been taught to him by someone he trusted. Someone he’d looked up to.
He wondered what Draco was doing and turned to look, only to find that Draco, red faced as usual, had taken his own sweater and slacks and was sitting at the edge of the pool.
“Be brave, Draco.” She says, already turning back to the pile of paperwork on her desk. “I know you’ll find happiness.”
“It’s not your stay with your godfather that bothers me, Harry.” She muttered, though Harry could barely hear her from inside her crushing embrace. “It’s what comes
Harry thought, but didn’t say. He daren’t wake the blond, whose breathing had evened the moment his eyes fluttered shut. He’d fallen asleep as quick as the seasons changed from autumn to winter.
about Regulus’ old room. It had royal blue walls with swirls of yellow. The same willowy curtains as the Rose Bedroom’s hung above the cypress bed, but pale white, like night-time clouds.
Girl Weasley… ahem… Ginevra was totally not buying it. Merlin, the woman was openly glaring daggers at him. He dares say Draco wanted to shrink into his black robes. But he relented. Because he was a Malfoy.
Luanne harrumphed. “Just sit down,” Harry enjoyed the way she practically forced him to sit on the little sled. Thankfully she had the good sense to put Malfoy in front. That way Harry could get minimal brain damage. I mean, why damage an already faulty product? Malfoy could do with a little shaking in the thinker.
He winked. This time at Draco. It made Harry feel… odd. And no, he wasn’t about to have a Long Think about that right then. That could wait for later.
Harry smiled goofily. Yeah, he definitely needed to get his head checked. “Since you’re calling me Harry now, can I call you Draco?”
Before sixth year, he was a patchwork of lies and pretences. Never once showing who he truly was on the inside. That might’ve been worse than when the mask finally slipped, because not even Harry was ready for the boy underneath.
Mrs Weasley spots them at last, and Harry smiles apologetically when she steers Draco towards the kitchen. Possibly to stuff him with Christmas pudding.
Azkaban doesn’t cure people. It strips you of every good thing that’s ever been part of you. Turns you into a monster.”
“Since when are you a professional sledder?” Harry shouted, ducking his face behind Malfoy to avoid windburn or whatever it was. “You said you’ve never sled before.”
Except this was Malfoy, and he definitely didn't want to kiss Harry. Clarisse might've gotten her dream snog, but Harry's was going to stay a fantasy. Well, Harry hoped not.
They had crashed and burned and broken. And here they were now, frantic touches and tentative kisses. Whispering apologies and consolation.
"Or we could stop him from ruining his life by getting him together with his one true love?"  Harry tries, putting an arm around his best friend. He tries doing the thing where they gesture  at the air in front of them and the other person just
“Did you,” drawls Wimbledon, smug bastard. Hadn’t a hair on his head, he. “Or did you not take the Dark Mark.”
“If you must,” Draco sighed, his cheeks getting pinker as he held a hand to help Harry up. It must be getting really cold.
in Draco before he could see the boy underneath the decorum and falsified-bigotry. Because even with his glasses on, Harry was too blind to see that when he was only ankle-deep in Draco Malfoy.
“Watch where you step, watch where you go!” Pansy shouted, giggling. “Harry and Draco are under the mistletoe!”
He caught sight of Ginny staring at him with the bannister in a death grip before he apparated from the Burrow. She’d been the only one not to say goodbye.
If this didn’t work, Dean was going to hand Harry’s pickeled head over to Hermione himself. And Harry did not want to see that day, thank you very much.
“Darling. Draco needs you more than I do. Now go make a cup of chamomile tea. I have a feeling Draco might need it when he wakes up.”
The matriarch seemed to be humoured enough. “None of that.” She tuts. “Call me Molly, dear.” Her voice is so
He’s convinced he won’t survive a minute at The Burrow, and they’ll have to ship him off to the Maestroes or something. But seeing the joy on Della’s face made him want to try.
“You forget that Moony is a werewolf. You forget that he is one of the kindest people in the world. You forget that he would die for a
“Draco used to pull on my hair when he was little. I’m quite used to it.” Sirius hoped his look conveyed,
“Ha ha. Very funny.” Zabini threw a charming smile at Harry. He was indeed soaking. And wearing a towel around his waist. Harry didn’t think he’d last much long. “The lakes are all frozen over, Draco. Surely you know that.”
He rolls his eyes at the pining Gryffindor. "Dean, no one straight would stare a hole in your trousers. Believe me, I'm gay."
“Not at all!” Harry said. In fact, he just might find something special there, right? In a lot of the books he’d read, antique shops held a lot of significance and-
Over the week he started looking better. His face gained colour and while his eyes still sunk in, they didn’t look as ghastly as before. No more blue lips, thanks to the blanket Sirius remembered to bring.
Then, in a rush of madness, Malfoy summoned a fork. “What is this, Potter? What do you- what do you call this?” He brandished it in front of Harry, like a sword.
Harry was sure the fact that she was doing a handstand and painting the ceiling with her feet when she said it wouldn’t affect her judgment.
Now Zabini was clearing his throat loudly. “Now, if that’s everyone, Hannah and I would like to proceed with the judging.” Then he turned to Draco. “Draco, babe, I’m going to need you to step aside for a bit - your glamour is ruining the uglies.” Seriously. What was with Slytherins and their pet names? Sooner or later someone’s going to think they’re all dating.
"Are you…" It was funny how easily Ron's face went green. He really was like a lanky, overly freckled chameleon. "Is that knife real?" Ron pointed at the knife Malfoy was holding.  The blond was running his fingers over the tip.
The knight drops his sword and then gets on his knees. He lifts his helmet and presses his lips against the dragon’s forehead. The snow swirls around them both and when it recedes, it reveals a prince in the place of the dragon, blond and beautiful. It had been hard to put Draco’s features on the tiny figure, but luckily the books in Draco’s trunk had been about the very thing.
“May I?” Harry almost forgot about Malfoy, until he asked to touch the kurta. “”I’d like to have a look.”
Harry whose head went south almost instantly, before realizing what Draco meant. “Of-of course!” He stammered.
"Actually, I just said that because I didn't know you were lactose intolerant, and I didn’t want to offend you.” Dean covered his face. “And Harry made me get you chocolates and I panicked." Seamus grinned and kissed his hair.
Harry turned to Ron. "Sorry, mate. An eye for an eye and all that bullshit." They locked the door in his face.
Draco lies on his chest, fingers tangled in Harry’s hair. At some point, his eyes flutter shut and a warm quilt is draped over them.
The way Draco shivered when Harry cast the warming charm would remain etched in the back of Harry’s head for a good while, he was sure. It was just so… so innocent yet- yet tantalizing. Harry licked his lips.
He’d never fucked up apparition before. Then again, he was more or less sure this couldn’t be the gloomy, cobweb-ridden living room of No.12 Grimmauld Place.
“It’s okay,” Remus said soothingly. “We let you in knowing fully that they might have marked you. It doesn't change what we think of you.”
Draco and Remus covered in flour after a particularly sticky bake. They’d been inspired after a Julia Child binge one afternoon. The bake-fest lasted till midnight.
His mind drifted to what Sirius had told him, about Malfoy running away. Something big must have provoked it, because Malfoy adored his parents more than anything. It must be something to do with his impossible task. Surely he’d be punished for not killing Dumbledore. Maybe he’d shamed his family, and couldn’t bear it.
“What… what do you mean?” He asks. This felt like one of those instances where Curiosity would kill the cat. And yet, the cat goes into the den anyway.
“I don't know, Harry,” Draco grinned cheekily. “I still think you have a chance. All your sweaters are ugly.”
Sirius was taking care of himself more. It was as if his health had a direct effect on the house. If he was gloomy, the house felt gloomy. On a good day, it might as well have fireworks, which is much better than it sounds.
“Yeah.” Draco shrugged. “What’s the catch? Do I have to take an unbreakable vow? Must I be your personal slave for the next century? What is it?”
Draco flopped on the bed as soon as she closed the door. He didn’t even bother taking his robes off. Just toed off his shoes and socks.
Harry found himself begrudgingly led downstairs. In the kitchen, Remus was feeding Teddy. He waved at Harry. There was a new scar on his chin. It looked fairly recent.
“I made us tea!” he announced loudly. “You have to try some, Draco. It’s Moony’s special recipe.” “And what are we eating with that?” Remus asks dryly, already knowing the answer.
His trunk followed them, floating close to the ground. It occasionally kicked him in the shins. Draco gritted his teeth and ignored it.
Sirius told him about how James had been a total arsehole but at the same time the fiercest, most caring person of all.
Millicent told them that it served them right for "going skinny dipping right after diving headfirst into snow" and that it was mild enough that she wasn’t even going to help them. “Deal with the effects of your mistakes yourself, sweeties.”
Some would say that it wasn’t lying at all. Half-truths. Leaving out the bits that don’t matter. Except those were things that
“Oh,” said Harry, leafing through his notes. He tried to ignore the heat in his cheeks, and the eyes of a certain blond (hint: it’s not Neville).
She had been sentenced to house arrest and her wand broken. Widowed and banished from magic forever.
Harry panics. Seamus had explicitly told him not to mention his flirting to the oblivious  Gryffindor. Harry was stuck in between the two pining bastards, not able to say a thing. "I said he's always ogling you, you big dunderhead." Nailed it.
Sirius waited until Malfoy was out of earshot before putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Harry, love, I know the both of you don’t get along-“
Malfoy looked like he would very much like to strangle Harry. Which was a more welcome Malfoy than the blushy one that gave him parkas and made Harry feel things he’d rather not.
Draco looked thrilled. His face brightened and there was a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Yes! That’s it.”
Kids didn’t need to see Father Christmas to believe in him. They did it because of the stories told by those they loved.
“Yeah, what’s so funny?” Malfoy grumbled from beside him. Apparently, he’d been hogging Sirius’ sofa for a while. And the turd had the audacity to act offended.
Bathroom time was probably the most awkward. Both of them were badly in need of a shower, and the bathroom was far too small. They tried staying outside, but as soon as Malfoy closed the bathroom door, the horrible feeling of emptiness, a kind of pain that wanted him to throw up, washed over him. Malfoy opened the door, looking green, and they sat together, against the wall for a while, to feel better.
"Way to wingman, mate," Ron whispered from his other side. Harry retorted with a smack on the ginger’s arm.
If you liked this chapter, let me know! Also I am not sorry for procrastinating for thirteen whole days and then making y'all cry (I hope?)
Harry might only know these things because Parkinson liked to tease Draco about it in the hallways, but he found that vehemence – that burning
Why had he not figured out that Draco was in turmoil the moment Harry saw him in Myrtle’s bathroom? Of course, he had to go and rip him up into pieces like a daft, impulsive thing he is.
“Looks like you’ve got yourself a replacement.” Remus laughed, nudging Sirius. The shorter male just sulked until Remus kissed his cheek.
“I do.” Draco smiled, and it was more beautiful than any magic. More special than any snowflake. More magical than any mistletoe.
“But you were at the other end of the hall,” said Harry, finding an opportunity. “So you must’ve had to be listening to have heard that.”
“Anyway,” Hermione said loudly. “Ron and I are going down to that little village down the mountain, for his date.” She smirked at Ron, who made a face at her. “Want to join us?”
Surprise as the first rays of light filters through. A bit of terror when blotches of colour start appearing. He closes his eyes, taking comfort in the familiarity of the dark. Then he opens them and takes in the wonder of the world. And he thinks, this is what I have missed all this time? I shall treasure this for what is left of my life.
Malfoy pointed at the toaster and then shoved the Toaster Strudel box at him. "I don't know how to put this, in that."
” The last part was hissed, of course. Wimbledon still needed the court to think he was a fair, just prosecutor, after all.
Harry couldn’t remember much about what happened after that. Just that there was a shout and then the sound of something shattering and something touching his forearm. He remembered thinking that
Harry remembered the Harpies were playing their semi-finals today. If they won, they’d be facing Puddlemere in the finals. Then again, the Harpies were facing the Magpies this time…
Anyways if you enjoyed reading this chapter as much as I did writing it, leave a comment or kudos :D
“What’s the occasion?” Harry asks, instead of where Draco was. He didn’t think Curiosity would kill this cat. Probably
Then, another bright idea flashed through his mind. Lily would have been proud of all the thinking he was doing today, Sirius decided as he wrapped himself around the boy as best as he could. Sharing his body heat with the shivering old thing.
“Yeah?” Harry answered though he sounded two octaves higher. Like a schoolgirl. Okay, that was stupid of him. Like a dunce then.
They exchanged dirty looks and Harry stuck his tongue out at him, feeling petty. Draco did not get to look so fit and embarrass Harry at the same time. It was just too unfair.
“Do you- would you mind terribly if I took… if I tried out the hot tub?” Harry practically begged Draco, who was frowning at the night sky. Really, what had the stars done to offend him? Not that Harry was complaining. Draco leaning on the railings was also Draco giving Harry an eyeful of arse.
Malfoy was still staring at the toaster like it was a twenty-headed Hydra or something. "Mmm. I think I got it." he mumbled, like he was in a trance.
Sirius closed his eyes, awaiting the unavoidable ‘you escaped from Azkaban’ or ‘murderer’ that always followed his name.
sleep with Krum, did you?" He grips Harry’s shirt, something scary in his blue eyes. Harry had only seen that type of look in his adoring fangirls. Thankfully Ron’s wasn’t directed at him.
“Here,” Harry said, not entirely disagreeing with the existence of a 'secret method'. “I’ll do it. You man the cooking station.” He quoted something he heard from an American restaurant show. It was about food trucks.
Moony would have told him he shouldn’t have wandered out in the first place, but in Sirius’ defence, spending so much time cooped up in No.12 Grimmauld Place (and it was grim when Moony wasn't around) made him feel sick.
Teal walls with gold accents instead of charred black ones. A fully equipped, sparkling kitchen stood where Sirius’ little impromptu one should.
“Someone convinced Padma it wasn’t such a good idea.” Parv winked at Draco and went to help her girlfriend distribute the gifts.
Instead of what should have been the Dark Mark was a deep bite mark. Scarred beyond repair. What looked like claw marks spelled out the most sickening of words. There was no mistaking who did this.
He sounded amused - like he couldn’t believe the both of them were fooling around in the kitchen again. Harry couldn’t quite wrap his mind around it either, this weird relationship he’d formed with Draco. What he did know was he would protect this bond with everything in his heart. It was stupid and Gryffindorish. But that was Harry - the lord of all things stupid.
Sirius glanced at Draco apologetically. Draco just reached out and gave his hand a squeeze. “Don’t worry Sirius,” he was grinning, canine-like teeth displayed. “I’d be more than happy to be that queer aunt that shows up late to Thanksgiving in drag.”
Soon it was time for them to board the train. Harry looked back at the castle. Really looked at it. Looked at the stone walls and those large, wooden doors. He tried, as he always did, to memorize every detail of the structure. Every crack, every bit of grime and every cobweb.
Neville was doing an apprenticeship under professor Sprout, while Luna was doing the same for Care of Magical Creatures, under Hagrid.
Yes. Harry could see it. Between the four of them (and Tonks) Teddy was going to be the most loved baby in the world.
“The wolf within him is faint but powerful. It will do anything in its power to break free on the full moon. Even if that means ripping him from the inside out. Even if it means he’ll have to go through each injury, every curse he’d suffered all over again. Until Draco is too weak to hold the wolf in.”
He had a trophy, this young Black tramping around muggle London. A stale loaf of bread that he held like it was one of Walburga’s distasteful but expensive china teacups. Sirius wrinkled his sensitive nose at the greenish tint on it. It was probably weeks old. Not suitable for consumption at all.
dirty socks.” Harry smirks. “I think I've got a pair of Krum's in there from when he and I got randy after Fleur's party."
Hermione seemed to be having trouble with hers, so Harry busied himself with helping her instead of wondering what on earth Draco could be up to. Well, to be fair, he did think about it, even when talking to ‘Mione.
The snow on his cheeks was cold enough to be real, and so was the sound of his classmates enjoying themselves inside. Harry didn’t think his heart could beat as fast as it was, had he been dreaming.
“Molly!” Harry blushed. “I'm staying with Sirius. Not gallivanting around with Voldemort.” He joked.
Harry felt his obstinate heart hammering against his chest. Do it. It says. Where’s your Gryffindor courage?
Draco watched as Potter cast a spell, and the sides of the carrots peeled away. They even dropped into the waste bucket!
. I do try. I try to call it a fork. But- but when you’re told it’s a spoon for so long, it’s difficult to call it something else.”
Sirius remembered Remus telling him about a student’s boggart being his parents’ disappointment. Perhaps this was that particular student, huddled in Moony’s arms. Being comforted and patted on the back more times than the Malfoys probably did in a year.
Blaise is yanking at a string of fairy lights, with Pansy mouthing the occasional obscenity while pulling back. In other words, they were being their normal, snarky selves.
What wizards did with magic, muggles did with technology. They replaced magic with numbers and circuits and voltage. Harry thought there was something inherently beautiful about that.
Batter splashed on the floor as Potter and Molly danced around. Draco yelped when Potter took his hand and twirled him around. He’d been more than okay just enjoying the scene from afar. “Come on, Malfoy. Sing with us! Accio Christmas…”
Instinctively, Harry hit the snowglobe under his sweater. “Yeah. Yeah, I have, actually.” He smiled in what he hoped was an innocent way. “You done?” Harry motioned at the pile of books under the Slytherin’s arm. They all looked the same to him. Ugly and torn.
Sirius snorted. “Actually, James invited her home and they shagged and he made her breakfast that morning.”
Then all of a sudden, Draco was crying. Well, he was tearing up, but still chopping away at the vegetables. Worry bubbled in Harry’s throat. “Shit, are you alright?” Did he cut himself? Harry should’ve known better than to have-
“Neville cried,” Luna confirmed. She looks very pretty in her leather boots and sky blue jacket. There are harpies painted on the back, for her girlfriend. “Ginny’s coming straight from the game.”
Third class of the day and Harry was trying very hard not to act like a disaster gay. Which was very hard considering he was a disaster gay. Also, Malfoy and his pointy arse decided to sit right. There.
Luna sits on the floor. She pats the place next to her, for Neville. They both looked tired but happy. Probably because they were staying at Hogwarts.
Heck, he’s living in a Victorian-era house hydro-dipped in dark magic. He’s got a dog and a werewolf for parents, a metamorphmagus godson, friends who fought over movies and Christmas lights and a godawfully poncey boyfriend. Life really couldn’t get any better than that.
“You don’t have to hide it, Harry,” Hermione whispered, brows furrowed as she tried to ice one of the shortbread biscuits. “It’s obvious you like him.”
Draco engaged in avid conversation with said wizard, something about the virtues of alchemy over potions. Sirius didn’t bother keeping up.
“Wizegamont had an early trial for Lucius.” She said crisply. Gone all business-like again. “I have no reason to believe I won’t be next.” It made sense. The black clothes. The dark circles. Lucius Malfoy was given the death trial.
"It was nice knowing you, Harry." Nev shrugs. He was back to being a stonehearted troll again, it seems.
The darkness made him worry. Alleyways made for the perfect place to pull heists or illegal drug trafficking. Muggles were very particular about their nightly recreation. The boy risked getting killed here.
“So,” Ron grinned ear-to-ear. “You’re going to have to spend Christmas with Malfoy as your personal cocksleeve. Puts one heck of a dent on your Christmas plans eh, old chap?”
Then he remembers carrying Draco back to their room after he’d fallen asleep in the lounge. The feel of Draco’s hands clutching his shirt and his sleepy warm breath against Harry’s face and neck. Mostly importantly though, the way Draco cracked an eye open and gave him a secret smile. Well, it
“It’s okay, Draco. I’m here. You’re here. We’re both here and we’re okay. We’re safe. We don’t have anything to worry about. Safe, Draco. Safe. It’s okay to feel vulnerable sometimes.”
Wimbledon made a show of stuttering and protesting, but even he, the ever insolent fool, had to give way to the ferocity that was Della Archibald. She was the only reason they were conducting a proper trial instead of just extending his sentence.
Ron and Draco in the middle of a heated chess game (which Draco won, mind you). Harry in the background with nothing but his pants on.
“Hey!” The boy rasped. “Give it back. That’s my supper.” He made a grab for the loaf of bread but otherwise didn’t put up much of a fight. He was too tired for it, it looked like.
"Yes, Dad." She rolled her eyes. "Cute dorks. Now go away, I'm trying to sleep and your bedtime story didn't even help. What even was the moral? Playing knife monopoly and  watching an unhealthy amount of soap operas finds your soulmate for you?" Trust a Ravenclaw to try find the
The living room, with its tacky old quilt, where they watched 3 AM movies. The kitchen, Shakshouka and the toaster incident. Astronomer’s Room had Draco’s constellation right above his bed. Harry would never be able to go on the roof without that kiss burning the back of his eyes.
Malfoy sighed heavily. He looked weary. All the excitement from before had left his cheeks flushed but his shoulders heavy. Drained. “What if, for all of my life, I’ve been taught that this is a spoon? If-if everyone around me has called this a spoon.” He stared at it strangely, like it might turn into a snake and strangle him.
She’d given him a pair of self-cleaning dragon hide boots. “Because you never know when you need to go stomping around the Forbidden Forest,” she winked.
At the very middle was a heart, made from the same material Moony and Padfoot had their wedding robes stitched. It was the best quilt ever.
There was nothing wrong with giving back, but giving back because you automatically assume they’ll take advantage of you is toxic.
And their lips pressed together again, and all was good. All was perfect. He could spend all eternity like this.
“Oh, shit, sorry.” Ginny said when she saw the kids. And then she slapped herself on the forehead rather dramatically. “My bad.”
"Now can we play or what?" Neville bristles, clearly disappointed Harry figured it out. How could he not? Even Harry wasn’t that oblivious. Most of the time.
There was no way he was letting this boy eat that kind of food. Especially not a Black. Especially a Black
“It’s time for presents!” Said Parvathi. She was wearing a beautiful green and beige saree with lace that looked like delicate leaves.
Malfoy grabbed him by the elbow before Harry could storm out of the house. “Potter.” His voice was tentative.
After all, Sirius and Remus have been Messrs Lupin-Black for nearly 16 years. They deserved all the happiness in the world.
“Figured that’s the part you’d fixate on,” snorted Ron, walking into the infirmary with Hermione. “And before you accuse us, Pomfrey only let one person enter before and
Harry laughs, wrapping an arm around the blond. “You say that every year. Last year we just hung ornaments on the Halloween props.”
Draco leaned his head back and Harry once again got to admire his glittering blue and grey eyes. They were like two pools in the middle of a cornfield maze, the sky reflected in their glassy waters. His face was a labyrinth Harry wouldn’t have minded getting lost in. Eyes oceans he wouldn’t have minded drowning in.
Hannah, from her spot on the yellow sofa the Hufflepuffs adopted as their own, giggled a little. She had a large magnifying glass and notepad beside her, which was odd. But not by Hannah standards.
"Bye Harry." Neville all but runs away, but not before giving Harry a quick hug. Perhaps he wasn’t as heartless a troll as he made out to be.
Harry peered into every window, looking for something, anything, that he could buy and present to Draco. As a token of their new-found friendship, he could say. Or perhaps…
The blond was lying on the sofa, face ashen. There were a few bruises on his face, but nothing too serious. He had yet to wake up.
the only one that calls it a spoon. Everyone’s telling me that I’m wrong. That I should call it a fork, not a spoon. But when I’m home, they tell me to call it a spoon and-and by then I know this is a fork and my parents and their friends are
“I didn’t know you supported the Ballycastle Bats. Or is it perhaps the Butterbeer that got you so hooked?”
Draco flicked his wand, the not-Hawthorn, and a pale violet cloth draped over their table. Two plates floated on followed by a pretty vase filled with Gardenias and Spring Gentians. Then the cutlery arranged themselves by each plate. Glasses and a pitcher of water were the last to go on.
The explosion that broke out was immediate. Within seconds Hermione and Blaise were brawling on Mrs Dabney’s polished floors. It gave Harry a chance to look at Hermione’s get up. She was wearing a patchwork jumper - and get this, the colours actually
“And here I thought you were actually doing something worthwhile.” Harry turned around to find Malfoy holding a tray of toaster pastries and tea.
Sirius saw that in the way Remus wouldn’t meet his eyes. He could see it in the way Remus flinched when he pushed a finger under his chin and made him look. In the way his shoulders slumped in relief when Sirius kissed him slow.
Sirius turned and fled, wanting giving mother and son some privacy. In truth, he didn’t like seeing that sort of affection. It reminded him of Walburga. Teddy drooled on his shirt.
“That’s… might actually be rather sensible, Malfoy.” He was lying. Harry would bet his wand and his broom and his favourite socks Malfoy was lying. There was no way Malfoy could say something like this of his own accord. No way.
“Right, Voldemort. Happy now?” Malfoy shuddered. “As I was saying, (before I was rudely interrupted) I refuse to spend my Christmas with a long face just because I have to spend it with you.” He declared pompously.
“And that’s how you did, basically.” Luanne, the owner’s daughter smiled at them. “You understood, right?”
Draco lets out a painful howl just seconds before the full moon had risen. Sirius hears a different howl echo from the other side of the house. He bites his lip, keeping his eyes on the shaking figure.
His eyed widened. Draco could hear sirens blaring in his head. Oh, Merlin, he’d messed up already! “You have to peel them?” He whispered.
"Kudos for your use of 'normality' Ron. Maybe there's a bit of brain under all that ginger after all." Harry dodged a rather well-thrown barrage of popcorn.
This changes nothing, Draco. How dare you think it does?” How dare he think that being bitten makes him any less human? Any less himself?
Sirius felt awkward, standing there, not being able to do anything. This was something he could only stand and watch. Giving support from the side-lines. The revelation opened many of Remus’ old wounds. Sirius would be the one to stitch those up. For now, he let Moony take care of the broken boy before them.
Then a trickle of blood flowed from the side of his head. “Fell from the staircase,” Draco muttered.
"-as head of the boys dorm I simply must insist you take your… rebellious streak down a notch." Ernie told them off. Then, in a lower voice: "You're making me look bad in front of Lavender! I cannot afford to lose to her-"
Hermione shoved him. “You didn’t have to make it sound so vulgar!” But then she turned to Harry expectantly. Oh great. She wanted to know too.
Harry asks when it goes oddly silent. He never did well in silences. They made his heart hammer. Harry didn't think he liked it much, when his heart started hammering.
This was nothing like it. It was still musical and lilted, but not in the bright, summery way it used to. Narcissa’s voice was sorrowful, cold like the winter draught she’d brought in with her.
They’d managed to fix up the living room, kitchen and Sirius’ bedroom that week. Harry wondered if he and Malfoy would have to share the other bedroom, or if Sirius would let one of them use the third floor. There was no way Sirius would let either of them make the sofa permanent residence.
Sirius is standing on top of a ladder, frowning at the humongous Christmas tree. He seemed to be trying to choose between a creepy-looking angel figurine and a badly chewed star. Remus is holding onto the ladder, with five-year-old Teddy is clutching his trousers.
Harry sits on the bed, peach sheets clenched in his fists. Whatever Draco had to tell him, Harry meant to take it well.
“You’ve done nothing but give, and give, and give, even though the rest of my family did nothing but hurt you. You looked past all that, and you saw me as me, not the Malfoy heir. Not a stuck up prat. Not a death eater.”
The Gryffindor kept looking at their entangled arms,  and back to Seamus’ glowing face. Like he couldn’t quite believe it just yet.
Remus frowned, eyeing the marred flesh, red and purple. The burn mark from before stood stark against the fainting bruises. “Were you ever going to mention someone hurt you?”
He smelled like apples. Apples and snow. Harry was aware how crazy he was acting at that moment. But the important (and perhaps shocking) bit was that Draco had made no attempt to move away. No attempt to push Harry away.
Harry asked if they too could make and eat Shakshouka. Like a family. Like James and Lily and Sirius and Remus and Euphermia once did.
Draco flushed, but this time he didn’t look angry. Just kind of embarrassed. “I think a simple ‘thank you’ wouldn’t suffice. I’d like you to help me… make something for him. And Professor Lupin.”
“So, Potter,” said Malfoy, nearly two hours after the triad left. Madam Pomfrey was keeping them because... actually, Harry didn't know why she was still making them stay. “How long do you think we’ll be stuck like this? Because I don’t think this would be very ideal for that perfect Christmas scheme of yours.”
“I haven’t given you my gift yet.” Harry said instead of the thousand other things he could have said that would have been less insensitive.
He handed it to him wordlessly, and then watched as Malfoy marvelled over the intricate patterns. It was nice, if not a bit jarring, to see Malfoy with such open expression on his face. Harry wondered why he thought the Slytherin looked much better smiling. People don’t think that sort of thing about their former arch-nemesis. Actually, Malfoy was more arch-pain-in-the-arse than nemesis.
“If you want a reason, just think of it as me seeing myself in you. And wanting to sort of thank James for what he did for me. It’s all very selfish you see?” Sirius smiled. “I am but a selfish man who wants no debt from dead people on my head.”
Fake geese. Mafloy woke him up to watch fake geese. It could have been because they’d reached the resort, or maybe even because the train was being hijacked by an evil megalomaniac and they needed to save the world. But no. It had to be fake geese.
Harry stared, bewildered. “No. I’d tell you that that is in fact a fork.” Because even someone as daft as Harry would know a spoon from a fork.
have five feet, Pomfrey really didn't have to put Malfoy that close. Not that Harry was complaining or anything. It was really easy to admire him when he was this close, and you know, not yelling or sneering. He looked pretty, actually, when he wasn’t trying to glare Harry’s head off. Not that he did that a lot these days. Just a lot of blank-faced staring and-
It hurt for Harry to hear this. It hurt him to think that Malfoy was afraid he’d say the wrong thing, and had to replace them. With forks and spoons.
“I just think alchemy has a lot more potential than just the Philosophers Stone,” Draco said, dipping his bread into the shakshouka. He had to roll his sleeve up to stop any getting on them.
Harry hears a scoff from his left. Draco. “You have the exact same view from the Astronomer’s Room.”
The smell of fresh biscuits was so much more magical when you made those biscuits with people who you love.
“Yeah, okay.” Harry pretended to understand what she’d said, but he was pretty sure he sounded as lost as Malfoy looked.
And that’s when Harry realized something very, very important. If he couldn’t be five feet away from Malfoy that meant he was… “Oh my god, Malfoy is sleeping next to me.”
Hermione and Millicent (??) had slipped into one of the tiny shops, leaving Harry and Draco in the rear.
Draco joined him in the tub, sighing softly as the water rippled around them. He ducked his head under. He lifted his head, water from his hair dripping on the otherwise calm surface. Draco shook his head, making the water go everywhere.
Remus glares at him, face green. “I’ll be fine. Remember when he left?” He gestures at Draco. “It was a few days before the full moon. There’s more to that bite than Draco lets on.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. They’d already tried every single spell they knew and Malfoy’s even dug around the Library of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and came up empty. The walls just wouldn’t stop bleeding.
Something bubbled in Harry’s stomach as his mind pieced the information together. Harry recognized it as pure delight. “Shakshouka!”
Harry could only imagine how sexy he’d look, covered in a sheen of sweat. His pale blond  hair sticking to his face. Fucking ethereal.
(Harry had no idea what the bloody hell that was). There was egg in it. Professor Lupin added tomato paste.”
“Her son, Delaney grew up in my care. I always felt guilty for sending my daughter away. Luther made me out to be a monster. Said I was taking revenge for Martha having a child out of wedlock.”
“Like, he would always be dusting or making sure we had our coats on and shit. And one day he invited us to his place. It was the first time. James and his mum – that’s grandma Euphemia, Harry – they made us this poached egg in tomato soup. It was brilliant!”
“Consider that your punishment,” Sirius had grumbled, still mourning apparently. He’d even ditched the tacky violet bathrobe for a black one he’d charmed to say ‘You warm my heart, Toasty’.
Harry reached out and grabbed his elbow, just like Draco had. But he held on, unlike Draco who had let go immediately. He hoped Draco would understand what he was trying to convey with that gesture.
The Auror pushed him again, and Draco glared daggers at Potter until they reached the atrium. Back to Azkaban, then.
Draco interacting with muggle appliances is my favourite thing ever so I just had to, okay? Even if the toaster thing's kinda common.
Well, it didn't look like Harry was going to get an answer more explicit than the forks and spoons and knives and soup. Might as well suck it up.
“I'm sorry.” He was saying, voice remorseful. “I don’t want to leave, but I have to. I have to because I don’t want you guys getting hurt because of me. I don’t want to be the reason you feel pain. It’ll kill me.”
“I just… two people who constantly have their wands at each other’s necks… they see each other and then… they fucking screech like-like little schoolgirls.”
magic. Like all old Victorian-era things, Grimmo had magic seeping right through its floorboards and furniture. Wouldn’t be wrong to say the house was alive.
