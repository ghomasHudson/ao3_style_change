Harry stares, then glances over to the window. Malfoy seems to be immersed in his book. “So... does that mean that Malfoy—”
“I have to ask again—Harry. Do you... do you understand? Do you know what just happened?”
“Oh, for the love of—Harry, you have got to put your foot down and tell Chandra not to bother you on your breaks. If she wants to work through her lunch, fine, but—”
at the end. He shrugs as he dries the last plate Malfoy’s handed him as they clean after breakfast.
“He’s probably just been stunned,” he says to the doctor who comes running towards them as soon as they land.
When Draco swallows, it occurs to Harry that he probably isn’t as confident and unconcerned as he looks. That puts him at ease just a bit. But his voice is steady when he says, looking straight at Harry, “Like why you’ve been looking at me like that all these weeks.”
“They found another body.”
“Why’d you wear those damn Muggle clothes to the Ministry?” Harry hisses at him. He almost instantly regrets it, but Malfoy’s sudden, sharp gaze on him propels him on. “If—well, you bloody well knew people were going to stare anyway, didn’t you? Why make it worse by
Harry remembers what Hermione said a few days ago about rightful anger, sheds no tears, and moves on with his life and his cases.
“Ready?”
“Malfoy,” he says, dread growing heavier and heavier in his stomach, “he was supposed to wait for me here, but I can’t see him, what if something’s—”
And that seems to be the theme of the day: Malfoy seemingly trying his best to avoid looking at Harry, only ducking out of his room to go to the bathroom or to get himself a glass of water, then reluctantly sitting at the kitchen table again, once Harry knocks on his door to let him know dinner is ready.
“I—I didn’t want to be a bother,” he says, voice small and clearly embarrassed.
Just when Diego jumps in front of Manny to save his life, and Draco gasps like he hasn’t just admitted he’s seen the film at least ten times, a loud knock coming from the window startles them both.
“And you ate it.” Harry still stares at him, and he can’t stop, because Malfoy’s ears are getting redder and redder by the second.
And then he wouldn’t go anymore, and he did his best to keep the smoke out of his own space. But now it’s here, sitting at his shitty Ikea table, turning his whiskey glass on a cork coaster with nervous, jittery movements that are so difficult to react to accurately in the face of what he knows Malfoy to be, or, well—used to know him to be, really.
They eat in silence in the morning. When it’s time to Apparate to the Ministry, Malfoy tilts his face up for Harry to glamour him, then holds out his arm wordlessly. The one time he speaks to Harry is in the lift, ears red and voice quiet, asking if he could stay with him for the day.
Quote at the beginning of the chapter—from the letters of J.R.R.Tolkien
It doesn’t have to be heavy and serious, though. “So,” he starts, not even knowing where he’s headed, just that he wants to go somewhere, “what about the music, then? Have you always had an interest? I didn’t know.”
Half an hour later, they still haven’t got anywhere. Harry is sitting with his head buried in his hands when a soft voice comes from behind him.
He feels silly and embarrassed, and he doesn’t know what to do with himself. He knows that these feelings will grow legs and run away from him, and he doesn’t want to be hyper-aware of himself around Draco; he’s positively afraid of it.
He lets out a breath as he realises something. “You know, I haven’t even really caught on to the full magnitude of this, like—Aliyah Pittman, for instance. She hasn’t done anything. But what if she was going to? What if she really was going to start her own little blood purity movement and Mr Diggory targeted her to prevent that from happening, to rewrite the future—”
The next morning, Malfoy looks mildly disappointed when Harry tells him that despite it being Saturday, he has to go to work. He can’t afford to rest the entire weekend, not while he’s working on the biggest case he’s had probably since he’s started at the Aurors. Chandra and him are planning to pore over the forensic reports of the victims once more, see if they maybe missed something the first time.
Malfoy belongs there, with those memories, those feelings in that corner, doused with the water of Lethe, never to be disturbed.
After a long time, Draco rolls off him. Harry instantly misses his warmth. Draco props his head up, facing him. Harry's heart gives a little squeeze when he takes in the flush on his cheeks, the redness of his swollen lips. “So,” Draco says slowly, “are we going to talk about—the thing?”
“Anyway,” Harry says, “the point is—you couldn’t have known. But you do now.”
And he doesn’t need to ask what Draco means by
Harry notes the subtle shift in Malfoy’s speech. How he seems to round out his vowels more, slip back from his fake London vernacular to his posh accent just a bit. He’s tipsy. “Returning the favour?” Harry echoes.
Malfoy shrugs, but Harry doesn’t miss the tense set of his shoulders. “But then, when my father left that time, she called me into the dining room where my father played his classical music, and told me to sit. Then she pulled out a record, hidden behind some books on the shelf, and put it on the turntable.”
“I haven’t found anything yet. I’m working on it, but—nothing yet. Sorry, Harry.”
Harry deflates at once. “Of course,” he says, and sets out in the direction of the cafeteria bathrooms.
“Professor Snape and Headmaster Dumbledore are dealing with Potter. We are going to talk about you.” McGonagall interrupted him.
Malfoy took a deep breath, before barging on. “The treacle tart flavour...I-” His eyes shifted away from Harry’s face to a dildo shaped indent on the floor. “I made it because of you. For you. I meant to- Well, I meant to bring it to you. For weeks now. But I just...couldn’t. I was scared.”

“This entire conversation. I’m going to fix it and come back with an answer that doesn’t make your face do that.”
in faded green with a drawing of a man holding a stethoscope against a smoking laptop. In front of the building a slate sandwich board blocked the pavement, advertising the shop’s reinvention into
“Exactly,” Harry moves closer, nudging his nose against Draco’s. “We’re in a library, Malfoy. Far too much talking. What would Madam Pince-” Draco cuts him off, chasing the words from Harry’s lips and valiantly rejecting all thoughts of Hogwarts librarians and dragon tattoos.
“Hm?” The black scales, the hint of a wing, it had to be a dragon.
In which everything's comin' up Malfoy.
“What a delightful image. Time to be unconscious now.” Gentle hands tucked the duvet around Harry and Hermione’s voice faded away.
“You need to eat something.”
“Not really.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Think we might, er, think we might be, er, splitting up.”
“Draco…” Blaise’s expression had melted back into the mask Draco was used to seeing. “Listen to me Draco.” Blaise stepped closer, dropping his voice. They were almost the same height. “I am not
“Right.” Harry felt himself grin, tried to smooth a hand over his own mouth as he turned to the screen. It didn’t work and he smiled harder, repressing a giggle as Draco huffed at his own onscreen antics.
Harry stares at him. “Why not?”
Then the next murder happens a week later, and Harry and Chandra are called in.
Harry wakes up to a strange noise. His eyes are heavy with exhaustion and his mind is too groggy to register the sound at first, then—running water. His bleary confusion gives way to a jolt of realisation when he recognises it to be the shower.
Robards nods. “Boreas Rookwood. Some teenagers found his body by the High Street in Hogsmeade last night. Portkey next to him.”
He just has to push it back out, where it’s been lying for years. He’s done it with so many things, people, places, memories—he can do it again. Focus on work, be professional, solve the case, don’t let anyone else die. Don’t let Malfoy die. That’s all he has to do.
And Harry does; he sees him.
“How are you so cool about this?”
“How is
Malfoy shrugs. “I don’t know. You’ve always been—you’re still how you are, in the ways that matter. Ways that make the... the core of you.” He fidgets, then, tries to tuck a non-existent lock of hair from his face behind his ears. “But you’ve also become… something else.” He flicks his eyes up at Harry. “I think you’ve just grown.”
Draco looks up, and oh—his whole face is red. “You really are daft sometimes, you know that? Why do you think Diggory went after you?”
Harry tries to laugh. He tries to laugh against the flickering pulse on his throat, and says, in as light a tone as he can manage, “Never thought I’d see the day Draco Malfoy gave me a genuine compliment.”
“Now,” Harry says. “The plane tickets are last minute.”
Harry explains the cryptic reason Diggory gave for why he was going to kill Draco. Draco stares at him, expressionless at first. Then his cheeks fill with colour, and his mouth falls open.
Harry looks at the greyish strings hanging precariously off Hermione’s outheld fork, imagines it’s overcooked chicken, and quickly bites it off.
“What do you mean?” Malfoy asks quietly when he doesn’t continue. Harry looks at him. He looks interested.
Chandra nods. “Take him to St Mungo’s just in case. Okay? Can you do that? I’ll handle this,” she nods her chin towards Mr Diggory’s unconscious body.
“Yeah,” Harry whispers.
Chandra laughs, sharp and startling; she hasn’t spoken up in so long Harry has nearly forgotten she was in the room. “Leaving without discussing the details of your temporary entourage?” she asks.
“I’m sorry,” says Chandra.
come out of your mouth at that age, Merlin.”
He turns to Malfoy. “Hungry?”
It’s true that he’d spent plenty of time glaring across the Great Hall at Malfoy at Hogwarts, and he makes a silent, triumphant
And when Harry dwells on that a bit, he realises that Draco’s probably never opened up to anyone like that before. And it sends his mind reeling, makes him want to reach out and squeeze him into a hug so tight and so long they both come out of it breathless and a bit more full of this thing Harry feels charges the air between them.
Harry thinks, limbs heavy with emotion,
Harry’s breath stutters, and he gets a bit annoyed with that, scolds his silly, giddy brain—he doesn’t want
“Oh,” Harry says.
They sit. Harry throws back his drink and pours himself another, then gestures at Chandra with his glass. He feels slightly deranged. “Go on,” he says.
“What do you think it means,” Draco starts slowly, softly, still trying to search Harry’s face patiently, “that a future version of Diggory went after—went after me like that? To punish you, or, as he said, to make you feel the pain he’s feeling—losing someone prematurely?”
“Welcome back,” he says with a lopsided smile that he hopes is laid-back enough to convey how it’s really no big deal that Malfoy is back, even if it might be. Frankly, Harry has no idea how people will react to seeing him after thinking him a cowardly recluse for so long. Which he probably is, regardless of where he’s been all these years.
He didn’t consciously think about the hundreds of mornings he’s seen Malfoy stir two teaspoons of sugar and a generous splash of milk into his tea. It just happened, like muscle memory. But Harry feels that would be odd to admit. Even if he wasn’t
Harry’s stomach flips. He takes a big gulp of his wine. “Would you like me to?” he asks in the end, senseless. Of course he does; he just asked.
And God, Malfoy doesn’t make it easy. He strolls up next to Harry, puts both his forearms on the countertop like he owns the damned place, and when he realises what Harry’s making, his entire face lights up so much that Harry swears his eyes look a shade closer to blue.
“See? You’re not that daft when you use your brain just a bit.”
A sudden knock comes from the front door. Harry rises without thinking. It’s Chandra.
“In London,” Narcissa replies. She looks at him for a few seconds, wordless, mouth slightly open like she can’t bring herself to continue. But she eventually does, and adds, quieter than before, “Muggle London.”
he thinks, even though he doesn’t know what that means.
“But you’re safe now,” Harry rushes to say. “Chandra’s got him.”
Chandra snorts. “That you are. It’s more of a hunch than a sure thing. Rookwood and Nott—neither of them could be considered the worst of the worst, if we were to take account of everything, really. Their biggest sin was arguably that they were born to the wrong parents. It fits the vigilante pattern. To lose a child produces the maddest sort of grief of all.”
“Sir,” he says, slowly, “if I may—if you could please kindly consider my history with Malfoy and realise I am the
As soon as the door closes behind him, he realises the music he initially thought to be coming from speakers is actually live, an acoustic concert performed by a single guy sitting on a small stage by the window in the far right corner, playing the guitar and singing. The tables are surprisingly packed for a Tuesday night.
And Harry is not blind, okay, he knows that. He’s known that for a long time. He’s known for a long time that the low burn in his stomach he used to feel whenever Malfoy was around wasn’t just hatred.
And Harry feels the tremors of something new in its wake, something stunned behind his ribs, but he can’t dwell on it now.
“That’s okay, Padma,” Harry says, even though it’s not. It’s not okay at all, and he’s such a useless wanker—Christ, how could he be that stupid? How did he not think to conceal the fact that Draco was living with him?
In the beginning, after the War, they would gather with everyone at the Leaky, hoping that ordering Firewhiskey by the bottle would help them forget for a few hours. But all it did was fill the gaps of silence with heaviness, until someone eventually said “do you guys remember…” and someone would croak out a “yeah”, and loss would settle like smoke over their table, so heavy Harry had felt like his lungs gradually filled up with nothing but sadness every single time.
“I mean, I—I think, considering the unusual circumstances—were the killer to attack Malfoy in Muggle London, the best case scenario would be that a lot more resources have to be put into obliviating potential witnesses and cleanup,” Harry starts. “The worst case scenario would be... well, endangering or even killing Muggles. I don’t think it would qualify as preferential treatment to put an Auror or two on him. Outside his house and wherever he goes to work. If he does work. I have no idea of his circumstances,” he finishes awkwardly. He chances a look at Chandra, but he can’t tell what she thinks at all.
he thinks.
“Stop,” Chandra says, voice firm. “Stop thinking about it. I know it’s hard. The only thing we can do is keep guessing, and that's a very dangerous game to play with the future. We don’t—we can’t think too much about it. You can’t think too much about it. Understand? If he told you anything—I strongly suggest you try to forget it.”
Harry frowns. “I’m not—”
Draco’s head whips around to him. His eyes are wide, and the colour spreads from his cheeks; almost like he wasn’t expecting Harry to call his bluff. And if anything, that makes Harry feel more confident; like he isn’t the only one whose heart is about to beat right through his chest.
—he just
“What thing,” Harry says. He’s stupid and fucked out, but not enough not to know what Draco means, not enough not to have it in the back of his mind constantly. But he tries. He turns towards Draco, mimicking his pose. He takes a deep breath. “Do you—do you want to?”
Quote at the beginning of the chapter—Teach Me To Forget by Mona Karel
He feels like an indecisive child; one moment, he looks at Malfoy, his familiar face and his forearm, always covered—and he sees the person who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, was at the forefront of it all. He sees how something like that could ruin someone to the point of wanting revenge, wanting blood.
“What do you mean?” Harry asks. He can’t feed the embers of desperate disdain in his stomach now; his confusion overrides it.
At lunchtime, Harry brings him food from the cafeteria, and pulls up a beaten plastic chair to sit with him.
Malfoy looks at him. A slow type of amusement pulls up the right corner of his mouth. It’s a rare thing, now—one of the expressions on Malfoy’s face Harry knows from before. It fills him with a mindless sense of anticipation.
And even though Harry’s first feeling is annoyance, there’s something much stronger blooming under the surface when he sees the sneer on Malfoy’s face. It nearly sends him reeling with a dizzy sense of relief—
After all the things he has learned about Malfoy in the past couple of days, this is the last straw.
“He said—” Draco starts, but Chandra raises her hand.
“Cafeteria, then.”
Harry exhales, nervous tingles beginning to emerge along his spine.
While Harry is busy resting his hands on his stomach after his pie, Malfoy sets down a bottle of wine on the table.
A change in atmosphere is crucial; an atmosphere in which Malfoy trusts Harry. But he suspects that neither he nor Malfoy possess the mental tools needed to make things less tense between them, which brings him to the obvious conclusion that they need to get drunk.
“—so I can’t help you with that, but… if it’s any help, I’d say consider anyone and everyone associated with Death Eaters and their sentiments in danger.”
He reads the rest of Chandra’s report in silence. They discuss a few possible directions to go in, decide who to interview in the following days, and make a list of people to put under light surveillance.
Diffusing tension is Hermione’s strong point, but Harry pays attention sometimes. So he goes inside and gets them both a glass of water; they’ve drunk nothing but whiskey the whole time, anyway. Malfoy follows him in, carrying the scent of smoke with him.
the mean part of his brain asks helpfully.
. A happy
attention to yourself? You make no bloody sense, Malfoy.”
Robards nods. “That’s the one. She was found dead this morning. Murdered.”
When Malfoy settles by the window in the office, it feels so natural that Harry has to catch his breath over it. It’s been less than a week, what in Merlin’s name is wrong with him—
He wanders behind the kitchen island and tries to recall Malfoy’s eating preferences. He conjures a memory of jam on toast and porridge with fruit over sausages and eggs almost every single morning, and doesn’t dwell too much on how he remembers that after all these years.
that he doesn’t want this moment to be.
Harry’s heart stutters in his chest. And even more so when Malfoy’s expression changes, something more serious. “But you’ve changed, too, Potter, did you know that?”
Malfoy doesn’t answer. When they get to the alley, he wordlessly holds his arm out. Harry notes his continuing neutrality—a matter-of-fact, silent acknowledgement of their state of affairs, in which he has to give temporary control over to Harry.
“I didn’t say it
Harry smiles. “Brilliant. Let’s go, then.”
Harry’s heart stops. “Draco!” he screams.
For the love of—didn’t he
Harry steals looks at him when he goes to sip his tea: he’s sitting with one of his legs drawn up on the chair, socked feet hanging off the edge of the seat, head bent above his plate, picking at his toast and chewing slowly, like he’s waiting for someone to berate him.
“It’s my favourite wine,” Malfoy says.
He waits for Malfoy to say something, searching his face, but he just stares. The front door opens. It’s Katie, Malfoy’s flatmate, and Harry wordlessly takes down the
“No,” Harry says. “Not at all. It’s like—it’s like we’re chasing a ghost. I’ve never had a case that—where there was such a complete lack of anything. Everything. There’s nothing.” He huffs out a frustrated breath.
Harry looks at him and doesn’t dare say anything. If he thought it would lead somewhere, he’d ask him,
at your living quarters, exactly?”
Out of all the things Malfoy could be wearing on this ugly grey London day, he’s wearing a big white shirt, down almost to his mid-thighs, top two buttons undone. Nothing else. No poncey silk pyjamas, no forest green bathrobe, no socks. Harry notices with a little thump of his heart what is definitely the edge of a tattoo peeking out from under the baggy shirt on his thigh. It looks like the tail of a dragon.
When the lift doors open, he turns to Malfoy. “Don’t leave my side for a second,” he says, then starts towards the glass doors of the Department at a swift pace. He wishes he didn’t have to walk across the entire Department floor to reach Robards’ office, but he has no such luck.
They sip their water. Harry cherishes the calm silence that settles over them. Malfoy stops shaking. When their glasses are empty, he wordlessly takes both his and Harry’s, washes them, and walks to his room.
He thinks about all the moments that have led here—him sitting at his kitchen table with Draco. He thinks about how he didn’t see any of them coming, but he didn’t need to. The present was enough. Being there was enough.
Draco’s mouth takes on an amused tilt, and Harry feels himself getting even redder—is he laughing at him now?
“Hey,” he says, soft and calming. He reaches out a hand and squeezes Malfoy’s arm. Malfoy’s eyes follow the movement. “I think that’s enough for now. Thank you for telling me.”
I was wrong, I wouldn’t have. I wouldn’t have said those things. Done them. Thought them. I wouldn’t have thought those things.”
“You’re reading Hesse,” Harry notes.
Though it’s clearly meant to be part of the back-and-forth they’ve always had, a playful counterpart to his similar enquiry a week before, Harry’s eyes darken. “Because she handed me over to Voldemort during the War, with the rest of Fenrir Greyback’s merry pack of bounty hunters. And despite the testimonies of several people, including me, she never spent a day atoning for her sins.”
“Oh for fucks sake!” Harry exploded, hands reaching up to grip Draco’s biceps and give him a gentle shake. “If that made me uncomfortable then why would I agree to be on Bog Crawlers with you?”
“Will that really work?” Harry was rather surprised at how mild his question sounded. He was still fuming. His head hurt and the blood in his chest felt like it was swishing back-and-forth at an alarming speed.
Groaning quietly, Harry sunk his face into his hands. He listened as Hermione and Ron’s voices rose in volume.
“Still do.”
“Right.” There wasn’t any way to explain that Draco, that Malfoy, has always felt different, been different. Thinking of it in those terms made Harry shiver and reach for his hoodie.
“You don’t even work for the Ministry.” Millicent pointed out as Ginny did some elaborate and—in Draco’s opinion—overly sexual warm-up stretches.
“A weapon! On Hogwarts grounds!” Umbridge was practically vibrating with glee. “Needless to say, I will contact the Ministry immediately.”
“My brother does it every year.” Angelina had said, bouncing from foot-to-foot as Draco inspected the leaflet. “It’s like an obstacle course but muddy.” Long practised at wiggling out of team bonding events in the least worm-like way possible; this was the moment when Draco should have politely but firmly declined the offer to squirm around in the mud.
*~*~*
“Draco.” A small fly had become stuck in her lipstick and it waggled it’s legs feebly at Draco. He struggled not to feel a certain amount of kinship. “Do you know what I do with little boys who lie to me?”
“Why don’t you clear out the spare bedroom then?” asked Hermione. They were sitting in the living room, balancing a book the size and weight of a generous tombstone across their legs. Harry was fairly sure that his primary function was to act as unreliable, slightly sweaty furniture, but it was nice to spend time with Hermione, just the two of them.
“You wanted to to kiss me.”
“Sure mate,” Harry backed out of the room, holding up both hands in the universally recognised gesture for ‘I promise not to try and do you job for you, unless it’s really obvious who the killer is and Draco goads me and we run out of biscuits.’
“Hey, Draco.” Harry leaned forward to wave his hand in front of Draco’s face, grinning at the horrified double-take this earned him. “Can I show you something?”
“And I stand by it! I want to have fun, ok? I want to go out drinking with our friends and I want to make out with Ron, my boyfriend, remember? Who I didn’t see for weeks because I was stuck in that flat playing emotional midwife for you and Draco. And I want-” she raised her voice to speak over Harry’s protest, “to be able to do all that without you looking miserable. Draco is coming over. We are going to talk this out.”
“No-” Whatever Harry was going to say next disappeared as Draco let out a muffled shout of frustration and took one last step towards him.
Potter put down his phone and opened his mouth to speak.
"And he's agreed to it?"
“Fuck you, Potter. You’ll pay for this.” Draco stormed away up the street, raising his middle finger when Harry called after him. It took two blocks for Harry to catch up, dodging past late-night shoppers and cursing Draco all the way.
It looked like Ron, a zealous proponent of the fair mere hours ago, was starting to realize that he’d signed up for his biggest nightmare. After all, there was nothing Cormac did better than public embarrassment; Cormac McLaggen
“Harry, mate,” Harry felt Ron’s comforting hand on his shoulder. “Are you ok?”
“Aesthetic.”
“You missed that one,” he said pointedly, mainly because if he had to do this, he would be as mardy about it as possible.
“Here’s good,” Harry interrupted.
“He’s fine,” said Ron. “Your Dad just needs a minute. How about you fetch your mum, Albus? Scorpius, go with him and then see if Mr Bumblewhack is still giving out hot chocolate-” he gestured to a small ‘Bumble’s Bouncing Beans’ coffee cart, parked further up the street “-get one for each of us.” Ron waited until the boys had disappeared into the crowd before turning to Draco and taking him by the shoulders. “Right, I know this is all a bit much but Scorp-” Draco winced at the nickname, then remembered that Astoria had gone through a phase of calling their son “Puss” and reconsidered his wince. “He’s worried about you, mate. Kept saying you’re all he’s got. So you’re going to take some deep breaths and put this melt down on tomorrow’s to-do list. Yeah?”
ferret,” Draco interrupted her. McGonagall gaped at him. “Oh! Oh you meant the Black family!” Draco tried to backtrack, realising that he had verbally confirmed that he was an illegal Animagus. “Well, yes I can imagine that that would be very... you know...” he fumbled with the doorknob. “You know in a theoretical sense-”
“But...” They were almost nose-to-nose, Draco’s eyes were a lovely grey blur, and Harry really just wanted to get to the snogging.
“Right,” said Fred, back to being frozen in the narrow space between the two beds.
“Well it’s not quite that bad,” said Potter. “Not for me, at least.”
“I’m not that bad.”
and realising that they were connected, Snape had invited Hermione and Malfoy to hide out in the world’s grimmest flat. Then, somehow, it became clear that Harry was also a target. Rather than just tell him he was in danger, Snape, the cape swisher, Malfoy, the drama queen, and Hermione, the woman who once ranked being expelled as worse than death, had decided that they should kidnap Harry first.
“Unbelievable!” Malfoy smiled his fake smile again. “Potter guesses something again. Who would have thought that after two encounters with death any of his taste buds survived!” The crowd laughed, but Malfoy continued without waiting for the laughter to die down. “That is it for today, thank you for your attention, and remember with SlickEasy’s everything slides easy.”
“Yep, that’s it,” said Harry, ripping open the mini eggs and trying not to breathe too deeply. “They really should pack it in.” He raised his voice. “Otherwise someone might hex them.”
“Scorpius doesn’t remember half the children who were mean to him at nursery,” Draco hurried to explain. “I, however, might as well have their names carved on my heart.”
“Beg to differ,” Malfoy interrupted him. “I suppose I should thank you,” he continued, sitting up slightly. All the better to loom over Harry. “I never expected to hear the mating-call of the Snargaluff in the wild and yet you do a remarkable imitation.”
penises and
“Oi!” A sweaty, sweary Tonks appeared to erupt out of the pavement between them. “Oi! Sodding-” she held up a hand, sucking in great gasps of breath. “Just... alright gimme a moment.”
Because that was what he wanted, Harry realised as the bottle started to slow down. He wanted to kiss Draco again. He wanted to twist his hands into the front of Draco’s jumper. He wanted to suck Draco’s tongue and then slip his own tongue into Draco’s mouth. A gentle fizzing sensation whispered across Harry’s palms and he watched, wide-eyed, as the bottle stopped in front of Draco.
The moment passed and Blaise turned his head, looking up towards the 31st row. There was a small smile on his face and a plain silver stud on the collar of his robes. It was extremely discreet and if Draco hadn't seen Blaise less than 10 minutes earlier he might have overlooked it. For the first time since their conversation by the popcorn cart, Draco thought to wonder how Blaise had managed procure Ginny’s help. And whether those same tactics would work on Potter.
“Meh, I’ll catch you.”
“Tell me anyway.” She was trying to keep him close, Draco realised as he started pointing out the different players. Lucius was talking to Fudge, towering over the Minister like a newspaper about to swat a fly. The other occupants had already taken their seats, a horn blew to signal that the warm-ups were about to begin. Draco scanned the front few rows, looking for messy black hair. Nothing. Feeling vaguely dissatisfied, he sat back, only to realise that Lucius and Fudge had stepped forward and were continuing their discussion directly behind his chair.
“If we are no longer the people the prophecy mentioned, then the prophecy cannot be fulfilled.”
“What, um... what is this “thing” that you’re referring to?” Draco asked, his voice came out much lower than usual.
“I tell you I was framed,” Malfoy insisted as he and Harry did the washing and Hermione and Snape read in the living room. Despite “the transformative power of forgiveness,” they had all agreed to leave personal growth on the back-burner and focus on ways to speed up the Animagus charm. Harry knew that he was happier with any arrangement that passed the research onto someone else, but he was a bit surprised that Malfoy had agreed to do the dishes.
from the wonderful fleamontpotter and realised that I must have subconsciously absorbed her brilliance and claimed it for my own.
“Oh, no it’s alright.” Harry hastened to reassure her. “I’m just going to-”
“What on Earth is going on?” Professor McGonagall and Madam Hooch were standing in the doorway, wands drawn.
As soon as his tongue touched the dildo, he knew why. Malfoy stood frozen in front of him, his eyes fixed on something behind Harry’s left shoulder.
“What? How is that fair?” Oliver protested, glancing fearfully at Katie and Alicia who had darted over to stand next to Angelina, arms folded. “Cassius is the one who suggested we do the Muggle version.”
“You invited Draco.” Harry realised.
A third otter appeared.
“Hello.” Hermione beamed, dropping a kiss onto the top of Ron’s head. “Busy tonight, isn’t it?”
“Listen to me.” Draco fought to keep his voice under control and the fur from sprouting behind his ears. “I don’t know what or who,” he eyed Ginny, “you are involved with, and I want no part of it. Do you understand me? I am not “trying” anything and whatever you are “trying” to do with this blood traitor may well get you killed.”
“Yeah?”
“Because you love yourself?” he asks, voice cracking.
“But you know nothing about us,” Draco argued, prodding at the mush.
“Er, thanks,” he said, accepting his role as the groups’ official Muggle translator. “Thanks for... you know... er... having us.”
Harry laughed, and reached out to take Malfoy’s hand in his. It was a simple gesture, but somehow clutching the pale hand in his clammy palm, feeling Malfoy’s pulse under his fingers was enough. It was enough because now he had time to love.
“I’m not sure about this,” said Minerva, snatching up a crumpet and starting to pull it apart. “It seems a little... sordid, does it not? Offering myself up as a-”
“Harry—”
“I assumed.” Draco’s shy smile loosened something in Harry and he smiled back.
“This is rank too. Fucks sake. Who thinks of these things?”
“Yeah.” Harry nodded along, wistfully thinking how much easier all their lives would be if he could just transform Malfoy into a ferret and have it done.
“What?”
checked he and “Potter” weren’t
a bit distressed.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. The plan tonight had been to get a bit pissed, chat about the Canons’ chances in the League qualifiers; and then maybe stop off for a falafel on the way home. He wasn’t really prepared to talk about the dark, sour things that pressed in on him whenever he thought about Draco. “Look, can we just…not?”
dildos?” Harry felt queasy at the thought.
“Great!” Rolanda climbed back onto her broom, “I’ll get Chris to send over the details. Wood! Get that Quaffle out of Flint’s mouth before I demote you from co-Cap to Ball Boy!” She zoomed off towards the pitch in a flurry of robes.
“But I wouldn’t mind kissing you,” said Harry.
was the one who had insisted that they spend the afternoon rolling around in freezing filth.
“You said-”
A faint banging was coming from the kitchen.
“What?” Potter smiled, shaking his head. “No this is definitely my table.”
In the back of his mind, Draco realised that they were both slipping into the kind of dramatics usually only heard on Wizarding Wireless Soap Operas. Judging by the small smile pulling at Ginny’s lips, she was making a similar comparison.
“Malfoy. Alright?” Potter’s startled jump had caused his glasses to slip down his nose and he nudged them back into place with a stubby finger.
“Thank you, Professor,” he said, standing quickly and attempting to push the chair back into place. It remained bolted to the floor and he gave up, nervously smoothing his hair as he edged towards the door. “I do, um, I, thank you. This is, thanks. Are you, um,” he felt himself compelled to ask the question, even while his brain screamed to get out and back to bed immediately. “Are you saying that there may have been other students who, um, who...”
“Better not let Chrissy hear you call it that,” said Katie.
Good to know they were still equally stubborn.
“You’re dropping the team?” Draco asked, climbing up after Harry and very carefully not thinking about being called a sex god, even as a joke. It took a while for the second platform to swing close enough for them to jump.
Hermione’s mouth opened, and then closed.
The owner of the sharp voice was a very pale man, only a few years older than Harry,sitting hunched in a plush, dove grey armchair that matched his eyes. The pale man blinked slowly.
“Why is the kitchen spinning?” Harry asked, pulling out a chair.
“Wow, you really do get a thousand times posher when you’re on the back foot.”
“Obviously there’s been a mistake, I am here to meet a man called Liam.”
Harry and Draco would need to be in the same room as each other and as far away from Lucius and Narcissa as they could get without having to leave the country. Nevertheless, Harry was determined to be a good boyfriend to Draco. Even if that meant having to delay slowly sucking Draco off while Draco—
“Well then let’s go find Draz, and you can tell-”
“Etcetera, etcetera,” Snape finished, eyeing the three of them.
“Potter. Psst. Potter.” A bony finger lodged itself repeatedly in the soft flesh of Harry’s armpit. “Potter!”
Malfoy glared. Harry gloated.
A thousand apologies for the diabolical length between posting chapters. I've spent the last 18 months opening and closing this doc, then today, much like using chocolate milkshake in your cereal, I was inspired.
“Careful, little girl.” He hissed. “Spreading rumours-”
“No. Why do you hate me, then?”
“So you think the Chasers are in it for the glory?”
Seeing the murderous look on Malfoy’s face, Harry almost snorted out loud again. If there was anyone Cormac would annoy more than Harry, it was Malfoy. Harry was willing to pay just to listen to them talk for fifteen minutes.
“Oh!” She smiled even more. “Well
“Here, let me just...” Harry reached over and tugged at Draco’s shoulder until he was lying on his side, facing Harry. “This was your suggestion,” Harry huffed as he lifted Draco’s limp left arm and wrapped it around his own waist. The change in position brought their faces too close together. Harry could feel Draco’s breath against his chin.
“Nothing.” Draco felt himself sway slightly, leaning into Harry’s space. Sleep-deprivation, that’s what it was. Harry smiled.
“Well, no...even the most wiley seductress would struggle to get that team away from Rolanda,” said Poppy, laughing again at whatever Minerva’s face was doing now. It felt as if it was going bright red, but that could’ve been from the fire. “Why don’t you just try smiling at her a bit more? Maybe accept one of her invitations to the pub.”
“That’s... was she alright with that?” Potter had a rather odd expression on his face.
Sitting on the top step, Draco watches as Harry tries and fails to wrap up the call. For another minute Harry continues to mouth apologies, then something changes and he stills, an eyebrow quirked.
Taking a deep breath and one last scan of the crowd, Draco followed. Long strides quickly caught him up with Ginny and she turned, a grin pulling at her lips.
In which Draco asks important questions about girls.
Nodding earnestly, Janice waited until the door closed behind Umbridge before addressing the rest of the room. Her cheeks pink with pleasure.
“Best leave them to sort it out, eh?” said Ron.
Ron and Hermione froze, their eyes darting towards Harry as if he were going to do anything other than curse the day he met them.
“Wanker.” Harry grins.
“It’s alright.” Tonks sat down, nodding her head to the other chair. “Sit. Now then,” she rubbed her face, gazed at Draco for a moment. Slowly, her hair flickered back to neon pink and she lowered her wand, leaving the recording charm unfinished. “Right, first question.” She leant forward, a grin spreading across her face. “How long have you fancied Harry?”
“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realise that sitting in the Minister’s box meant you had to surrender your eyeballs.” The Weaselette smiled sweetly. “Well if you do ever regain your sight please point Blaise in my direction.”
“You did sign it,” Hermione spoke, head still bent over the crossword. “Twice.”
Madam Hooch had disappeared as soon as the Portkey delivered them to the Travelodge toilets, and now half the team was watching Fred and George Weasley try to steal the tampon machine (“Dad’ll love it!”) while the other half asked Harry annoying questions about toilet brushes.
While Millicent was gagging and chugging Dr Pepper, Cassius’ second spin landed on Katie. The mist turned green, and Harry and Draco added their voices to the catcalling as Cassius sat down next to Katie and gave her a gentle kiss on her bright blue mouth. She grinned - showing off her blue teeth - and offered him one of the Nerds she’d been refusing to share all night. Cassius declined but he stayed on the twin’s bed next to Katie, which resulted in Angelina and Fred switching over to Harry and Draco’s bed.
“Did you drink straight from the bowl?” Draco asked.
“Hello darling.” Narcissa greeted him, reaching up to smooth his hair.
The realisation that he could say whatever he wanted to Potter without worrying about it being used against him sank into Draco’s mind like a dollop of butter into a hot jacket potato.
“I… Ok, yes, I did say that.” Draco reached up to fiddle with the hair curling behind his ear, immediately regretting the move as something cold slithered down his neck and into his collar. “I’m a problem solver.”
the only one to be raised by Muggles, it was unanimously decided that he was responsible for how shitty Sheffield was.
“Harry, Draco,” the otter said in Hermione’s voice. “Some of us are trying to sleep.”
“I...” Draco opened and closed his mouth, then shook his head, causing a few waves of white hair to fall into his eyes. “Salazar,” he stretched again, rubbed his hands across his face. “I think you might be right.” He stretched again, the movement kicking some dormant part of Harry’s brain into gear.
“Oh.” Draco reaches out a hand, catches his fingertips on the edge of Harry’s belt as he asks: “Does it hurt? Can I…” He wants to ask if he can touch it.
Ron was now rubbing soothing circles on Draco’s back as he used his teeth to rip open one of those plastic cellophane Mini-Mungos-Medi packs. They didn’t really know each other well enough for Ron to kidnap Draco from a date and then start petting him like a Kneazle. Then again, Draco was feeling a bit wobbly and the back stroking was rather nice.
“What’s a consent charm?”
“No,” Harry protested.
“That’s because I hate you.”
“Hmm, and that’s all it took?” Cocking his head, Harry let his eyes travel across Draco’s face. He was still smiling, but it wasn’t the sweet, fond thing it had been a moment ago.
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry nodded his thanks as they reached the front of the queue and a sullen wizard handed over their portkey. It was a piece of toast. “Let’s just get this over with.”
“Voldemort,” he whispered, whipping a handful of suds into Harry’s face.
“I know how to fucking suck cock, Cormac!” Harry yelled back. Great. He had just handed the
“Shit.”
“You know better than to eavesdrop,” she said, speaking low enough that only Draco could hear.
“So to speak.” Harry echoed, his mind racing through everything he’d read in
“Right; watch this.” Harry turned to examine the path in front of them. “See that flower pot? The one that looks like a cock?”
“You... you think that would convince her to let me coach the European Cup Team?”
“No we will not be-”
“Oh, that’s... okay.” Harry tipped his face up slightly, brushing his lips against Draco’s. “S’good,” he murmured, thrilling at the way Draco sighed against his mouth. “Do you want to, um...”
“We rather thought that the best way to break the prophecy might be if we were all to forgive each other,” Malfoy spoke in a rush.
“Mr Scorpius’s Dad?” Albus was back, holding up a cardboard cup of hot chocolate. Scorpius was standing next to Ginny Weasley, looking like he was brewing up a fresh batch of tears.
and to Draco not giving a damn about Harry’s crumbling heart. Harry wished to every god he’d ever heard of for the ground to open and deliver him into Voldemort’s scaly arms.
Unwilling to interrupt, Draco lingers on the top step.
“Pizard?”
“Yeah, it’s alright.” Harry’s fringe was in his eyes, knocking his glasses crooked. He thought about pushing it out of the way but then the corner of Draco’s mouth twitched.
“No,” Malfoy protested.
Across the room, the twins were snoring as one in that creepy, twinish way that they were bound to deny when awake. Oliver was grumbling in his sleep; Harry caught some mention of “Marky,” which was enough to propel him out of bed. Groping around on the floor, he found a pair of tracky bottoms and one of his own hoodies. His trainers took a bit longer to find, and he acquired numerous snubbed toes before finally making it out of the room.
“I beg your pardon?”
“Do what? Point out that you’re a dickhead? Because that’s not exactly a secret.”
Laughter also brought out the creases around Potter’s eyes, making him look older and more touchable at the same time. The observation sent a thrill through Draco and he leant forward, resolving to have another go at asking Potter a few consequence-free questions.
“Come here then,” he muttered. Harry had just enough time to notice that Draco’s eyes had grown to nearly double their normal size and then he was kissing Draco. On the mouth. With... tongue? Apparently tongues were in the mix as Draco gave a muffled squeak and parted his lips.
The sound of Tori Amos singing
Reaching down to adjust himself, Harry glanced at Draco. Did he like Draco? Or was it just a while since he’d had a snog? Draco was sitting very still, his back straight and both hands folded in his lap as his eyes tracked the flying Quavers. He looked miserable.
“No, my date reserved–”
“Drink?” the waitress still seemed a little suspicious of Draco’s Liam-ness.
“Wha-” Harry looked down to realise that he was now
“Going to be fast-forwarding the entire thing then mate.”
“Indeed.” Draco thoughts were racing as he continued walking towards the tent. “Of course. Indeed.” He sat down next to Scorpius, absently wrapping his arm around the boy’s shoulders and resting his chin on soft white hair. “Absolutely, makes perfect sense. Rewatching the tapes. Of course. All of them. Indeed.”
“Answer the question, Potter.”
Potter screwed up his face and squeaked “”Malfoy’s up to something!”” that’s me in 6th year,” he continued in his normal voice, beaming across at Draco. “Always following you around, asking what you’re up to. Remember?”
“Are those...”
of my grandfather’s Sleekeazy’s line of hair potions!” He hissed, glad that he remembered to keep his voice down so that the audience couldn’t hear his outrage.
“No, I know, but...” Harry didn’t really know what else to say. The mist was starting to disappear. His chest felt all tight and pressure was building behind his eyes. It wasn’t fair, he thought. Everyone else just knew this stuff; they knew who they did and did not want to kiss. They knew the rules to this stupid game. Or even if they didn’t - his eyes darted to Mafalda as he realised that at some point, someone must have explained it to her - at least they didn’t have to find it out in front of loads of people.
No matter how his heart protested the idea that any of the Muggleborn students present at the Battle could have a magical core strong enough to raise Voldemort, Severus reluctantly began to suspect that Granger’s kidnapping was no random attack. Especially when combined with the story tucked further inside the paper, on page 19 to be precise: a throw away reference to the attempted mugging of the Malfoy heir: Draco.
In which Draco hears some home truths.
“Don’t know.” Ron shot an uneasy look at Harry and Draco. “The oven is definitely on but—”
“Really.” Draco’s eyes darted to Harry, his tone sharp. “He was rather fit, didn’t you fancy a cheeky snog?”
“Not really much point, is there?” Harry stretched his arms above his head, joggling the book.
“Did you?” asked Harry, trying to remember if he had heard Malfoy complaining specifically about Lockhart—-he’d definitely been complaining about everything else.
Draco was so distracted by the delightful way Harry’s mouth dropped slightly open that he almost missed Harry’s reply. Of course, “almost” is a very important word here because, as we have already established, Draco Lucius Malfoy was no fool and when Harry James Potter says that you can kiss him, you grab your chance and you bloody kiss him.
“Not me.” Ron held his hands up. “I said it might be alright. That’s hardly an endorsement.”
Although he very much doubted that a nice chat and a selfie — perish the thought — would be enough to escape the time loop, Draco nodded. “Very well. Tell me, how are your children?”
“Both, my fifth-year self would be utterly appalled at this turn of events.”
“Right.” Harry blinked back. “So... so wait a minute. You went on a date with a stranger, while knowing that there was a ghoul hunter out there with a hard on for you?”
“So,” said Potter. “Why are you worried about me hurting myself?”
“Did you know?” Draco interrupted, spinning around and crowding into Harry’s space. “Tell me.”
“But what about Harry-”
“No, it’s just that, ah... Scorpius, he...”
“I let you sleep on my sofa.” Draco grinned, taking a sip of tea. “Next to my lovely cat, and I made you breakfast. Some would say you were lucky to have me.”
When they passed from the entrance hall into a hall full of stands, Harry’s first thought was, “Maybe this won’t be so bad.” The stands by the door all looked rather innocent. Some displayed handcuffs, some had erotic massage oils made from magical herbs, some sold sexy lingerie (
“Fuck’s sake.” Harry rubbed his hands over his face. “I told him I was having a quiet night in. How long before—” He was interrupted by the rush of the Floo as Draco and Hermione appeared. Waving cheerfully, Hermione wound her way through the crowd. Ron gave a limp wave in return while Harry sank further into his seat.
"But the chance to practise with a Nimbus 2001." Flitwick's voice rose in agitation, the sound filled Draco with glee. "That will give Slytherin a great advantage over the other teams. Lucius Malfoy may hold sway with the Ministry but surely Dumbledore-"
All the petty humiliations Draco had thought he'd managed to keep hidden. He didn’t sleep that night. Instead he listened to the other boys breathe and seethed with humiliation that their conscious thoughts might be full of how poor the Malfoys really were. Did they know about his robes? He pictured them laughing to each other about his shabby trunk (“a family heirloom”) and the elderly Malfoy owl.
“And now you’re in my way.”
“I did.” Malfoy still wasn’t looking at him but the set of his shoulders was determined. “I do. I want to. Spend time with you. Not just for sex. I just…” Malfoy finally looked at Harry. He shrugged, a laugh escaping him. “When I woke up, hungover, with crumbs and golden syrup on my favourite shirt, and realized I didn’t even mind because I was with you, I knew I was fucked.”
Malfoy’s eyes flew to his, inquiring. “Was that a suggest-”
Now despite what Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort, Aunt Bella, various Death Eaters, his Professors, some of his old school friends and even his own reflection might say: Draco Malfoy was no fool. He had read Scorpius’ favourite book:
“Why?” Potter’s face moved from concerned to alarmed.
Turning to Cormac, Harry narrowed his eyes. “Why is it not for me, specifically?”
“Oh.” Hermione seemed to be biting the inside of her cheek, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “He didn’t tell me he was going to do that.”
“Maybe you should go and check on him.” Hermione smiles encouragingly.
“Why not just snog them?” said Marcus. “That’s the Muggle way. You have to snog whoever you get.”
“Huh.” Harry abruptly lets the t-shirt drop, stepping around Draco and making for the stairs. “Interesting.”
“Afraid so.” Harry scrubbed his hands back and forth across his face. Fuck. From the ten seconds he’d seen of Draco he was looking just as pointy as ever. Pointy in that smug, posh boy way that set Harry’s teeth on edge. Although, his teeth seemed to be slacking recently as they were no longer on edge so much as mildly clenched. Other bits of him were proving to be dangerously alert but—
“It’s actually called-”
“But there must be something better than this. What if we went and found the kidnappers? We could trick them into thinking we want to take part in the ritual and then—-”
“No, I think we’re done,” Harry said, glaring at Hermione. “Got it all covered. Thanks.”
In which Blaise is very popular and Draco is decidedly less so.
“Who the fuck buys a used dildo?” Harry was pretty sure his expression matched Ron’s. He could feel his mouth turning into a grimace. “That’s disgusting.”
“No,” Potter hedged, taking another swallow of his drink and grimacing as a Cheerio bobbed against his nose. “No, I know that Slytherins... are... nice... I’m just saying that you’re wrong, Hermione is a good friend.”
“I suppose it wouldn’t hurt,” piped up Katie, tipping her head back and emptying a fourth (fifth?) packet of electric blue Nerds into her mouth. “We could make it so that if you don’t want to kiss someone, you’ll have to duel them instead and-”
“You can’t let them go just because he’s a Slytherin.” Janice folded her arms.
“Right,” said Harry, not completely sure what was going on but ready to give it a go. “Shall we go and get breakfast, then?”
“Thanks.” Harry grinned back. Just thinking about that morning still made something happy and hopeful swell inside his chest. The way the early morning sunlight had brought out the golden freckles that dusted the bridge of Draco’s nose and how Harry had—
“Alright,” Potter fumbled for his wand, pointing it at Draco under the table and muttering the spell. Nothing happened. “Are you going to tell me what’s going on?”
Malfoy turned to look at him. When their eyes met Harry realized how close they were. “But those are the rules of the game, Potter.” Malfoy faked innocence, while the mirth in his eyes betrayed his diabolical intentions.
“Almost.” Draco winced. “They recently transferred their, um, allegiance to me. Not that I have a cause to align to!” He hurried on. “Usually they keep their distance. This is the first time I’ve seen one of them in the flesh, so to speak.”
“What?”
“Well,” Draco shrugged. “Pansy did know Liam-”
“A bit, yeah. Sorry. Didn’t know you were, you know.” Ron mimed slicing his own throat in a gesture that was both overblown and completely accurate.
“When did you realise you preferred men to women?” Not the most subtle phrasing but if the time loop was coming to an end — and the matching cereal bowls suggested it was — then Draco had no interest in faffing about.
“I do not give a frigging fuck,” said Hermione, hand tightening on her wand. “Talk about the prophecy or not at all, otherwise I’m telling Ron that you called Severus ‘Mr Snape.’” Turning on her heel, she disappeared. Harry gaped at the empty doorway. It had been a while since he’d seen Hermione so worked up.
“What do you see?” Harry’s breath is coming a little fast, and it’s almost enough to distract Draco.
All of this was confusing enough and then, with exactly the kind of terrible timing Draco had begun to expect as part of his lot in life, Dumbledore’s Army were discovered.
“Right,” Draco pulled out his phone, groping unseeingly for his drink as he did so. Pansy and Granger had been friends ever since they got talking at a Magical Menstruation Board Meeting but apart from a few awkward dinners there had never been any real attempt to merge the two groups. Pansy had said that she’d like it if Draco and Potter could spend more than 15 minutes in the same postcode without getting into an argument but she would never... she wouldn’t have...
-+-+-+-+-+-
“It wasn’t really kidnapping,” Hermione had protested. “We just knew you wouldn’t have gone with Severus if you remembered who he was, and we needed to make sure that you didn’t go running off to the Aurors.”
“Ron isn’t an imbecile,” Harry said, sternly ignoring the fact that Malfoy had kind of, sort of, complimented him. “Covering old ground means that nothing gets missed.”
“You have to admit that it’s a bit shit,” Draco said to Harry, cocking his head as if he was being a reasonable person.
“What is happening?” asked Harry, still struggling to close his mouth and glancing wildly between Ron and Draco. “Did you just fist bump him? Did he just fist bump you? Why are you doing that? What is—”
“That’s it? That’s the grand plan?” said Harry. “We sit around here holding hands.” He watched as Malfoy tucked his own hands primly beneath the duvet. “And making friendship bracelets in the hope that it will stop the kidnappers from rooting around in our magical cores?” It was the worst plan he’d ever heard and, judging from Malfoy’s pained glance at the ceiling, Harry wasn’t the only one who thought it was crap. “Will that even be enough of a transformation? And how will they know we’ve changed?”
“This isn’t quite as horrendous as I thought it would be,” Draco’s eyes were still fixed on the bottle, which was now hissing a green mist. Harry hadn’t seen who Astoria was supposed to kiss so he let his head flop to the left and peered up at Draco.
“Of course it matters.” Draco blinked rapidly and swallowed. His throat clicked. “Granger lied to you and-”
“Fuck’s sake, come here.” Harry sighs as he reaches out and hauls Draco in by his lapels. “Wasn’t complaining, just working out the ground rules.”
“Been here before, then?” Harry asked. “You know,” he nudged Draco’s shoulder with his own. “On your dates with all those firemen.”
“That’s very kind of you but...”
The only drawback to bounding around the castle in ferret-mode was that the moving staircases didn't register his presence, leaving Draco to lurk behind tapestries and under armories until one of the patrolling Professors triggered the stairs. The stairs from the Dungeons to the Great Hall were fine, but the swinging staircase from the entranceway was stuck on the third corridor for so long that Draco was seriously considering turning back into a human for a few minutes.
But they haven’t hooked up in months. They haven’t hooked up since it got weird, and Harry spent every day trying to not fucking think of Malfoy’s stupid pointy face and his stupid splotchy chest, and his stupid hot palms and his stupid, stupid kisses.
“She didn’t fucking lie, alright?” Finally, Potter was looking as angry as Draco felt. If Draco kept needling him Potter would probably leave and Draco could stay, drowning himself in cheerio-cocktails before going over to hex Pansy for getting his hopes up.
“When I realised that you two are still doing that creepy couples’ code thing and decided to drown myself in the bogs.” Harry announced, glaring at them both.
Lucius did have hyperbolic tendencies when it came to the written word (and most other words, too), but Draco was slowly learning to tell fact from fantasy and it seemed that, despite the flowery prose, Lucius was telling the truth. Being a Malfoy would not protect Draco from a life lived in obscurity or the Dark Lord’s censure.
“You’re not ready.” Potter’s shoulders slumped and he sat back. “Ok.”
“Every day since the 2nd of May,” he’d croned to her, frowning when she didn’t smile back. “2nd of May 1998, to be proper.”
“The Aurors failed to catch the ringleader.” Draco rubbed his mouth again. “They told me that one of their sources had hinted that the ringleader might have a very specific interest in me.”
“Of course.” Draco nodded. It was flattering to be confided in, maybe Umbridge wished to ask for his opinion of the best way to imprison Potter and Granger while-
Firmly setting aside any questions about how Scorpius would have formed an opinion of Harry after only glimpsing him across a crowded crime scene, Draco owl’d his consent for Scorpius to watch snail sex and then, vibrating with nerves, he penned a second note.
“It’s the woman in the blue headphones.”
“Exactly!” Rolanda interrupted. Behind her, the Weasley twins started cheering as Potter and Malfoy crashed mid-air. Minerva decided not to mention it, just yet. “So they’d do the trust-building exercises in the morning and then train in the afternoon.” Rolanda was still talking, her enthusiasm making her eyes shine. “My sister runs a Travelodge down in Sheffield... not as swank as the Muggles footie teams go for, but she says she can get us a discount and use of the conference rooms.”
“I’ll go,” Justin Finch-Fetchley said quickly, he looked around at Draco with a pointed look, “Never have I ever been a Deatheater.” He held the bottle out to him with a smug smile on his round face.
Draco wasn’t exactly sure why he did it but it was strangely exhilarating. The bottle was finally passed to Harry, who drank deeply, trying to shake the warm feeling that built in the pit of his stomach when Malfoy had looked at him. If he didn’t know better, he would have called the look in his eyes...Lust.
“Where were you this morning mate?” Ron asked, “You weren’t there when I woke up, we thought you’d left for breakfast already but you’re late.”
He plopped down between Hermione and Ron in a daze, and smiled into his goblet as he took a large gulp of pumpkin juice. He was distracted, thinking of the way Malfoy's whole face lit up when he talked about quidditch. Harry hadn't realized how much Malfoy loved the game, during their previous years at Hogwarts it had seemed as though Malfoy was just doing anything he could to one up Harry, and while that might have been true, Draco loved the game. He loved the strategy of it and they had spent a whole hour this morning discussing one of Draco's favorite strategists and the different plays that he'd designed.
“Oh well.” She shrugged and took a hearty swig from the bottle and passed it pointedly to Draco.
But tonight, in the warm firelight and the happy atmosphere and under the influence of firewhiskey his thoughts drifted to the way Malfoys blond hair gleamed in the blaze of the fire, and the way his genuine smile was so much sweeter than the callous smirk he so often wore. And the more he thought, the more obvious the thought that he had so often dismissed became, he fancied Malfoy.
The Slytherins took in the group and assumed they weren't welcome. That had been the precedent set at the beginning of the year, the Slytherins were treated as outsiders as so many of them had been on the wrong side of the war, some of them had only come back to Hogwarts as a requirement of their parole. So they started toward their rooms when Harry called out, “Malfoy, why don’t you lot come join us?”
Dean grinned and passed over the bottle, Draco took a hearty swig and the conversation started back up again. As everyone chatted on about classes and the new drama going on in the halls of Hogwarts Harry found his mind wandering to thoughts he had avoided for a long time, with the a war going on there hadn't been time to entertain such notions.
Harry coughed, “Who’s turn does that make it now?” His voice came out a little strained.
What on earth does that mean? Harry thought, Did Malfoy like blokes too?
Draco grinned, this was good whiskey. If he’s being honest with himself, he really wanted Potter to say that it was him, who he fancied. But Draco knew that he’d been on the wrong side of the war, there was no way the The Chosen one could possibly fancy him. But hey, a guy can dream right? “Yeah maybe I would.”
“Harry, there’s nothing wrong with you fancying boys. I love you just the same and your parents would have loved you no matter what, I'm sure of it…” she had paused and smiled, “But don’t you dare lead Ginny on!”
Draco was pulled out of his reverie by the sound of his stomach growling. The sky was still dark, breakfast wouldn’t start for another couple of hours. He sighed and started out of his room toward the kitchens.
Draco took it reluctantly but paused before putting the bottle to his lips, “You do know it isn’t you I fancy, right Pans?”
Ron looked placated but Hermione still looked suspicious.
“Huh?” He asked, Ron and Hermione looked at him expectantly. They had obviously been asking him something and he’d been too deep in his thoughts of asking Malfoy if he’d like to play quidditch with him sometime to notice. “Sorry, “ he ginned sheepishly, “what did you ask?”
“Honestly Potter, if you were any slower you’d be going backwards. That’s what I said isn’t it?” Draco smirked without malice. “You drank too, Potter. Who is it that you fancy?”
The room got quiet again, “That was out of line mate.” said Harry in a dark tone. He thought Justin might have been trying to make a joke, but he thought Malfoy might be sensitive about it, so he tried to catch his eye but he seemed to be intentionally avoiding his gaze.
Harry reached for the bottle but it had already moved to Dean who was blushing with his whole body, Harry hadn’t seen that one coming. It was then passed to Pansy, who didn’t look embarrassed at all. Harry reached for it again but was intercepted but Malfoy, who decided, with a little help from the alcohol, to maintain eye contact with Potter while he took his sip.
“Uh...I woke up early and decided to go for a walk. I must have lost track of time.”
“Problem solved. Who’s first?” asked Seamus,
“It’s fine Potter, I was one.” Draco fixed Finch-Fetchley with his best Malfoy sneer and without breaking his gaze took a deep drink of the fire whiskey.  “Guess that makes it my turn?” He asked, then without waiting for an answer, “Never have I ever killed someone.”
Everyone laughed at that, and the game continued well into the night, Harry and Draco sneaking glances at one another when they thought the other wasn’t looking and verbally sparring whenever the opportunity presented itself. The ice had been broken between the Slytherins and the rest of the returning eighth years, there were still miles to go to build a bridge that had never existed in the first place, there were still many apologies to be made. Draco decided that night that he wanted to befriend these people, to do that he would need to work very hard to gain their trust, he'd started that process with Potter already.
He moved as quietly as he could into the common room that he shares with everyone who came back to Hogwarts for their eighth year, there was already a fire crackling in the hearth and he saw a dark figure emerging from a door on the other end of the common room. They locked eyes for a moment before Harry coughed quietly to break the silence.
The statement was a calculated one, no one was supposed to drink, the room was supposed to remain silent and it was supposed to impress upon the group that he was not a bad person, just a kid whose only options had been to join up or die. Draco had miscalculated however, as soon as the words left his mouth there was a sharp intake of breath from Granger and his eyes found Potters. He glanced around the room and noticed that everyone else was also staring at Potter, he coughed in an attempt to draw the attention away from Potter and opened his mouth to apologize but Harry cut him off.
“I forgave you a long time ago.” Harry glanced over at Malfoy, he looked shaken and his face was drained of all color. “You were just a kid, Malfoy. We both were, we both had so many choices thrust upon us at such a young age,” Harry’s voice rose as he spoke, the words spilling out of his mouth before he could process what he was saying, “and they weren’t even choices. As if you had a bloody choice Malfoy! Voldemort was living in your fucking house! As if I had a bloody choice ‘Oh, sorry I don’t really feel like sacrificing my life so the bloody Dark Lord can be killed and ensure the safety of the entire fucking wizarding world!’ right! We were only kids.” The last statement coming out in barely a whisper, Harry gasped for breath, his face was bright red and his hands were shaking with barely contained rage.
“Harry!” Hermione snapped her fingers in front of his face.
Harry, well under the influence now, took the bottle from Malfoy and asked, “Fancy? As in you currently fancy someone in this room?” He took his drink and passed the bottle onto Hermione and Ron.
The eighth years get a little tipsy
They walked the rest of the way to the kitchens in a comfortable silence.
Draco Froze,
Harry thought it was funny really, that anyone could forget that he had killed Lord Voldemort. He wanted to laugh until it hurt, but no one else would get it, they would think he was crazy.
Harry chuckled, “I could ask the same of you, Malfoy.”
He let his mind wander as he looked over the grounds, he thought back to his trial, he still can’t believe that Harry Potter, the actual savior of the wizarding world himself, had testified on his behalf at a time when Draco didn’t believe he deserved to be defended, if he’s being honest he still doesn’t think he deserved it. He kept both Draco and his mother out of Azkaban.
