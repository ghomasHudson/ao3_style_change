"I don't know what you're talking about." Draco said. But he had frozen, and his fork hovered in mid-air over the fillet of salmon hiding amongst the lettuce of his salad.
“You saved a man's life.” Draco pointed out.

“There’s kids here.” Seamus finished Neville’s thought out loud, “He’s gonna kill a load of kids?”
"Good party this evening."
Warning for scenes of an overt sexual nature.
Thanks for reading you wonderful people.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry just shrugged, and went back to watching Draco who was still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that the groundskeeper was a certifiable madman.
Also. I apologise. But with the bad comes the good! So hold onto your chickens cause it's not all doom and gloom.
Draco had chosen a table in the Library that was as far away from the entrance as possible. It was nestled right in the corner, between the brass grill of the Restricted Section and the shelves containing Alchemy research. Barely anyone came this far down for a table so he knew he wouldn't be disturbed. He had a lot of work to catch up on. When it came to the Fifth year curriculum he only needed to revise the subjects he had chosen for his NEWTs, which made a few things a little easier. He had set himself a target of learning all of the theory for the spells from Charms, Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts before Christmas. After Christmas he was planning on revising all the Potions, as well as catching up on Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. He had more time next term so he was saving the more challenging subjects for then. He just wished he had full use of his magic so he could actually cast the spells. He hadn't approached any professor about it just yet, he knew he'd have to soon though, he would fail his practical exams if he couldn't figure it out before the end of the year.
“Third row, last aisle.” Harry said as he scanned through the last couple of books in his pile before placing them to one side, “These are useless too.”
“Do you respect Moody?” Draco asked pointedly.
Just an update to let you all know that
“It’s not impossible, but it’s difficult. It definitely depends on how powerful the original memory charm was in the first place, I think the mental connection you have will help a lot.”
“I did something.” Harry said, but he didn’t expand. He hadn’t wanted to tell Draco of this at all, he didn’t want his Soulmate to look at him like he was turning into something dark and evil. The way Hermione had looked at him when he had done it.
“I know, everything looks so normal.” Harry replied, knowing exactly what Ron was hinting at without him needing to say anything more.
“Wha?” Harry breathed out. Dazed from being ripped away from Draco’s soft mouth.
that he didn't even know if he could take a date. Would Potter expect them to go home together? There was never anything formal uttered between them. They never made promises of coffee, or lunch, or a drink. They just fucked from time to time. Which surely meant that Draco was single?
.” Draco watched as Harry pulled out a piece of parchment and spread it out flat on the bed, he leaned over Harry’s shoulder to read the cursive words that were scrolled across the parchment, copied out by a magical quill somewhere in the depths of the Ministry of Magic. He hadn’t known that Harry had a copy.
"Harry!" He looked up to see Cho running towards them with a small group of terrified Ravenclaws in tow. She allowed her Swan to flicker and disappear as she entered the protective circle. And then Harry had a terrifying thought.
I don't like it when the trio just happen upon solutions to their problems, I like to make them work for it just a little bit haha.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Quite. A good turnout I think." Draco said as he tried to ignore how close Harry was standing.
Harry was sitting in front of a semicircle of pamphlets. His eyes moved from left to right, looking at each of them one at a time. He had collected them from the common room and had taken them to the library where Draco was studying. His eyes were being constantly drawn back and forth between the blue Auror pamphlet at one side and to a green pamphlet at the other side. The green one sported a Snitch, two Bludgers and a Quaffle zooming back and forth across the front along with the caption
"Didn't peg you as a cheater Potter." Draco had said when Harry's mouth moved away from his own and dropped down to kiss and bite at the pale skin of his neck. Draco could have kicked himself, what kind of idiot cockblocked himself by reminding his imminent shag about his wife and kids?
And Draco’s heart soared out of his chest. And his hands grabbed at Harry’s shoulders. And his body arched into Harry’s hands. And everything was right and lovely and wonderful.
"How should I know? You both got yourselves into this mess."
“Fuck. Draco, love.”
*Spoiler alert*
“It’s about my Dad.” Harry said. Sirius’s face fell, the grin faded into a haunted frown and his eyes started to dart around the room as though he was looking for an escape route. Harry didn’t want to make him talk about this but he needed to know the truth, he needed to understand what he had seen.
The evening came to an end, and Draco had spent it coming up with excuses to escape from Harry's small talk. Every time his conversations ended Harry was at his side, offering him a drink and continuing their previous conversation.
(See the end of the chapter for
The game dragged on. The score was ticking higher and higher in favour of the Huffepuffs, the Slytherins had managed a few goals but they were outmanned and were being outstripped by the Huffepuffs. He needed to catch that Snitch now. Another goal by Zacharias Smith, the Hufflepuff Captain. Time was ticking and still Draco hadn’t seen even the faintest glint of gold. He took a moment to glance down at Harry, once he realised that he was once again on that side of the pitch. Harry grinned at him and clapped in his direction.
Basically, he was torn.
"Don't know why you risked your life for the Ferret, too noble for your own good."
(See the end of the chapter for
He almost skid on the ice as he turned the corner to run down the next street. Draco's pale blonde hair seemed to almost shine like a beacon in the dark. The Dementors were swooping in one by one, taking their fill of every happy memory he had ever had while he lay prone on the floor in the centre of the street. They were draining him of everything good. Draco being such an easy target was probably the only reason Harry wasn't being overwhelmed, but he could still hear the traces of a scream echoing in his ears. Harry gripped his wand in his hand, he didn't have access to his magic. But that didn't mean he wasn't about to try. He thought of Draco.
Educational Decree Number 27 was created after breakfast was over. Harry just laughed at the sign stating that anyone in possession of the Quibbler would be expelled. The students of Hogwarts weren't so easily swayed when it came to Harry Potter gossip. Throughout the afternoon a slew of charms started making their way through the student population, all of which only made it easier to help the students pass around the Quibbler.
“Jesus fuck.” He hissed under his breath and Draco’s laugh was light and airy.
Apart from that. I have to say that I love each and every one of you. You've stuck with me through two and a half massive fics and supported my fanon from the beginning. You're all wonderful, the kudos and the comments have pulled me through to the end and motivated each and every word from A Forgotten Promise onwards.
“I guess you’d better speak to Sirius then, and Dumbledore.”
"Brilliant." The sarcasm wasn't lost on Draco.
"I have a room." Potter said and he sounded almost as breathless as Draco. As though Draco was affecting Harry as much as Harry was affecting him.
The man next to him was bent low over his arm, his movements were measured and hypnotic, with all the surety of someone well trained in his profession. Harry couldn’t really see what he was doing from this angle, but he could feel the rhythmic pushing and pulling of those fingers on his skin. The scratch of his needles, the drag of his paper towel. Harry relaxed once more, he closed his eyes so that he could re-focus on the unfamiliar music, and he settled in for the long haul. What he had asked for would take a little while to complete and if he was late back then he would take another lecture from Moody quite happily, this was worth it.
They had promised each other no more. In fact, they had promised each other no more after every single night of drunken debauchery. Yet, Draco always found himself with his legs wrapped around Potters hips and his tongue inside Potter's mouth. They'd always blamed it on the alcohol. Ministry Galas, Charity events, Christmas parties, New Years parties, they always came with an open bar (keeping the alcohol flowing always added zeros to the charitable cheques) and blaming it on the alcohol had always been so much easier. They both knew that they had stopped being blackout pissed drunk by at least the third time.
Harry didn’t enjoy being in that part of the Library, he was completely surrounded by shelves that towered above his head, each one covered by a thick layer of dust. He was surprised that Madam Pince would allow her precious books to get into such a state, Hermione had said that some of the books were so fragile and sensitive to outside magic that it was impossible to use cleaning charms around them, and Harry was happy to defer to her expertise on the subject. Their continued presence in that part of the Library was only indicated by the trails they left in the dust as they pulled out book after book. By this point there were whole shelves that had been dusted off by the continuous dragging of heavy tomes in and out of their places, and the centre of the aisles they had visited were trodden clean by their constant up and down pacing. It made it easy for them to see where they had been and where they needed to go next, without the need to place any kind of marker on the shelves.
“We weren’t perfect, Harry.” Remus said. And Harry knew that. He really did. Sirius took the mirror back.
“Dad!” Harry tried to jump back as Albus appeared at the top of the stairs, but he must have forgotten that they were standing in a cramped hallway because he knocked his head on the wall behind him with a sharp crack.
Hardest chapter to write ever, big battle scenes are really difficult to keep everything clear and keep the plot moving at the same time. I hope you can all forgive me from taking this from Draco's point of view and skipping all the most difficult parts to write haha.
“You saved us a lot of hassle.” Harry said, “We weren’t getting anywhere with the RAB clue.”  Without a list of everyone who had ever been allied with Voldemort, of which there were a lot, Harry didn’t think they would ever have been able to work it out.
I adore all of you :) thank you all so much for reading!
“Well, I destroyed the diary with a Basilisk fang.” Harry said, “Dumbledore, well he didn’t exactly-” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed that he hadn’t even thought to ask about the most important reason for finding the Horcruxes.
"No, but the rest of the Village is being swarmed. I don't get it."
“Parseltongue?” Ron suggested. Harry wondered why he hadn’t thought of that before, of course it could only be opened with Parseltongue, and Tom Riddle’s ego was once again foiled. Thinking that no one else could find the Room of Requirement had lost him the Diadem, underestimating their Soulbond had lost him the Cup, and now, forgetting that more than one person could speak Parseltongue, would lose him the Locket.
Aaaaannnndd ... I'm sobbing. So I hope all of you survived that because I certainly didn't.
“As a date?” He asked, and Draco could tell that he was just making sure that he was reading the situation correctly. Draco nodded, and Harry began to lean down to him. As always, like a magnet was controlling his movements, Draco’s chin tilted upwards and he found himself taking that tiny step forward, closing the small gap that had previously been between them.
Things are about to get exciting :)
“You have to mean it!” Harry shouted above the buzz of Hogwarts students casting Stupefy on each other, “Remember the movements, keep it fluid. Duelling is all about being fluid, the end of one spell has to form the beginning of your next spell.”
"If you despise them so much, why do you go to each and every one you're invited to?" Draco asked as he tilted the glass to his lips once more in the hope that his hand would hide the flush across his cheeks. He very much knew why Harry continued to grace the events with his presence, and it had nothing to do with his public image.
“Yeah, I’d like that.” Harry smiled as Sirius grinned once again.
“Oh dear.” Came Remus’s voice, out of frame but still hanging around in the background. Sirius’s face paled and his jaw clenched. This was not a conversation he had been looking forward to.
*spoiler alert*
“You sound like Ron,” Harry grinned at her.
"Go back up to Gryffindor if you want. Don't need to wait for me."
“I guess there’s no need to rule anything out this soon.”
"You can't-" Draco was already halfway to his feet when Hermione spoke, "He's taken the week off, home troubles I believe, he didn’t say in so many words but Ginny seems to be circling again, sorry for what she did or some rot. Sorry to burst your bubble." She smiled at him in a way which meant that she wasn't at all sorry.
He's got one opportunity left this week to find out what Malfoy's up to, and
“Your someone is a bloke, too?” Harry asks, eyes so goddamn round behind his glasses that they could rival the moon now, as it hangs high above them in the dusk.
Entirely satisfied with himself, Blaise sits across the library watching Potter watch Draco, both of them totally unaware of his personal seat to their special kind of sport.

Draco sighs, relieved, at finding the bait to lead Potter away from his endangered heart. “Of course. Who wasn't, honestly? The fucking Hufflepuff was gorgeous.”

Draco forces his breathing to slow and rubs his his eyes.
His brain stirs when the obvious idea hits him, and finally,
Draco feels Zabini grow uncomfortable next to him as the professor's gaze continues to move along the Slytherin crowd. The only positive effect of her doing so is the discomfort has entirely spooked away whatever was in his system, and his embarrassment has softened, making him silently grateful for it.
Draco sneers at him with a scoffing, “No. I need it on

Potter grins.
However, Potter earns his own extra points, too.
Green eyes lift up. They're definitely not entirely sober, but they're still sharper than Draco expected them to be.
One magnificent eye roll has Potter rolling his, too. Draco waves his fingers at the idiot. “Potter, there are women that throw themselves at you simply for your name. And there are women who will do so because you're you. No reason to worry, so just...just get that stupid courage of yours back and talk to her already.”
“Unfair trade. For all I know, you could have some obsession with Warbeck and have been writing her secret fan letters for years while I pour my secrets to you for

Draco glares. “Thought I came out here to get you out of your head, Potter, not let you in
Draco can't help it. He laughs. The fucking gall Potter has, even without knowing it.
Beyond ecstatic, curious, and turned the fuck on, Harry Potter follows, rushing a little in the cloak to make it just in time.
“What?” he asks, curious at that stare upon him.

It's clear Potter's up to something. It's likely Potter believes

Draco snorts with Blaise, both of them shaking their heads along with every other Slytherin in the room. The Ravenclaws seem curiously skeptical, the Hufflepuffs are all watching the girl helpfully, and the Gryffindors are a mixture of teasing one another and glaring at the Slytherins.
he know? Who else studied Potter for years? Who else stared at him enough, even after the War—especially after the War—to be sure the beloved Hero was functioning?
Regardless, Potter, there's one last thing you should know is true:
Draco's not seen before.
He's managed to avoid the Chosen One as much as possible the last couple months of this strange term mostly because he has no answers to questions he knows Potter wants to ask. Draco doesn't know why he spared him at the Manor, and he doesn't know why he tossed the idiot his wand in the end, risking his own fucking neck in a rash of Gryffindor-like courage that
. Fucking Aurors.
“I admit, not his best idea. Grawp’s mostly harmless though, he’s big and a bit slow on the uptake but he’s not mean. A somewhat gentle giant.”
The next night Draco arrived a little later than expected. But the American was stood waiting at the door and he politely waved off Draco’s apologies. He smiled charmingly and tucked Draco's arm into the crook of his elbow as they walked in together.
“No. But Draco...He kissed me.”
“I don’t think being good in bed has any relevance on the purity of a soul.” He said, but he accepted the leg that Draco was throwing over him and he guided Draco’s lithe body down into his lap.
Thanks for sticking with me so far.
“I guess I just didn’t really know what to think about it all.” Harry shrugged.
"What are you doing?" Potter cornered him at eleven o'clock, when his date had left to use the restroom.

“Here,” He pushed a stack of mismatched notes towards Harry, “Potions. I know how rubbish you’re doing, and you’ll need an O to continue with Snape.”
Scenes of a sexual nature
“I can’t believe she had it.” Hermione said quietly, reminding Harry that he wasn’t the only one in a state of shock over it.
“That depends on what you want from this.” Harry shrugged. He sounded casual, but Draco could tell that his shoulders had tensed up, and there was a subtle clench to his jaw that spoke louder than words.
Draco asked, realising that he really hadn’t gained any information from his current line of questioning.
“Harry, for Christ's sake, Harry!” Hermione was tugging his arm even harder and was hissing his name in his ear to pull his attention away from the retreating Slytherin, “What the bloody hell was that about?”
“We are getting ourselves into a whole bunch of trouble.” Draco said, continuing his protests as he allowed Harry to move even closer.
Thanks for being wonderful and sticking with me.
.” Draco sobbed dryly at that, he could never be happy without Harry in his life.
“We grew up Harry, and we grew up really quickly. The war was starting to really kick off, we had a new Minister who leaned towards darker alliances, the Wizarding world was changing and we had to grow up to adapt. By the time we got to seventh year Voldemort was wreaking havoc and he was more powerful than he ever had been before. I’m not telling you this to get any kind of sympathy or to excuse our actions. I just want you to understand what happened to us. Your Mum, Lily, would never have accepted James had he not changed.”
“Right,” Ron’s hands dropped to his side once more, “Obviously, of course there would be spells on it.” He shook his head at his own thoughtlessness, “Do you know how to get past them?”
Draco reached out with that same long finger and nudged a pamphlet titled Apprenticeships. Harry looked at it for a second before looking up at Draco in confusion. He hadn’t even looked through the information, he’d only grabbed it because it was on the table with all the rest of them.
"Fucking Slytherins." Harry muttered. Out of the corner of his eye saw Draco open his mouth to argue, but he quickly snapped it shut again. More than aware that Harry may have a bit of a point there.
"Yes, please." Harry's hand landed on his lower back to lead him towards the bar and Draco's cheeks flushed as he remembered what those hands had been doing last time they had seen each other.
"I don't know, I'm sure it'll be really competitive."
rules!” He says.
"Don't hold it against me, I'm usually much funnier than this."
“Everything alright?”
He sits up all of a sudden.
“I hope you change your mind.” Robards says, and Draco reappears dressed as he had been the first time Harry had seen him this summer, black shirt and tie, trousers, jacket and shoes.
“Take the lotion, you coward!” Malfoy jeers, leaping onto the bed to straddle Harry’s chest, making his hands even harder to fight as Harry tries valiantly to keep him at bay.
Harry breathes a sigh of relief when Hermione doesn't press further.
“Draco-”
Draco rubs his temples, like he always does when he can’t remember things.
“Merlin.” Harry says. “I should write her and apologise.”
“No, I’m being a good guest. I’ve thrown a party or two in my day and I despise when guests take off after making such a mess.”
Grey eyes lift up. The sneer habitually crosses his lips.

, I'm rather inclined to believe her,” Draco retorts, then pops the top of the bottle open, inhaling the powerful scent in an effort to help clear his breathing.
“Shit. Hope no one else noticed.”
Instead of walking
Draco Malfoy glances back to him and smiles that happy way that Harry's seen nonstop in his daydreams and leaves Harry standing there, open mouth gaping and heart thudding harshly, as Malfoy walks confidently away to the Slytherin dorms.
He holds up a palm. “No, no. So you're seeing someone, or you want to see someone?”
Harry laughs softly, warmly, and the hand on his hip shifts direction, moves southward until it's warm and heavy over Draco's hard cock and trousers. “Good.”
“All right. So what, then?” Draco pushes, stretching casually and inwardly cursing his nose as he tries to suck in more air so he doesn't have to gulp through his mouth like a goddamned fish.
For a moment all he sees are random clumps, and he is strangely left disappointed.

When Malfoy slowly slides their legs apart and shuffles his things back into his bag, Harry almost chokes on his breath, unsure of what to do next. His foolish courage had gotten him that far, and Harry knows he needs more than that to keep going.
“Have something to insinuate, do you, Zabini?” Draco questions, hoping to throw his friend off while Trelawney finishes setting up some display with everything she's gathered despite continuously babbling to the Hufflepuff.
“Fuck off,” Draco whispers, heart racing. “Why? If you and she genuinely parted without problem, and you're here today fully supportive, why the
Trelawney summons a Ravenclaw down to try the tea, explaining to the class that this kind of reading involves special teas and special symbols that can be difficult to decipher as they're related to a specific person tied to the viewer.
Draco starts suspecting Blaise is acting strange when at breakfast the next morning Zabini sits across from him instead of beside him, blocking his usually open view of Potter.
And Harry,
Draco Malfoy sits trapped alongside a mixture of other third years in a hot room at the top of a tower, all with a professor who strikes him as a woman several galleons short of a proper Gringotts account.
His hands fist in the cloak and Potter's hair, his lips opening to the demanding tongue stroking them, and Draco's legs start to buckle slightly with him hunching in the tight space. He kisses back, snogs Potter with everything he's held inside of him for fucking years of torture, and barely restrains a moan when he feels insistent fingers slide down his sides to grip his waist.
Potter followed him earlier, likely in his cloak. He figures Potter has followed him there already at least once before. But he also knows there's no way Potter has any idea what he's doing in the wall when he vanishes. It's a Slytherin secret, and there's no fucking possibility that it's been shared outside of tight circles within his House over the years.
“Professor Trelawney,” a Hufflepuff politely calls from his far left, hand in the air.
But he

His grey eyes dart about more than usual in the afternoons a couple days a week, and he disappears between classes where he'd once been easy to track straight to the library.
Blaise sits across from him, and just before he settles into his new spot, Draco briefly catches Potter staring at Zabini with something new. Something not just frustration at being thrown off his game, but something

“I hope they don't,” Harry admits, shuddering. He shakes his head, too, one arm leaving his knees to gesture as he explains. “And no, I'm not seeing a muggle woman. I met with one to buy some furniture, and someone followed me, clearly.”
“What?” Potter asks, frowning behind his sexy black rimmed glasses.
Blaise drags Draco with him through the dungeons, ignoring the bitching at his back from the posh git demanding to be let go, and he stops only when he stands before the magicked bit of wall. Zabini pulls his wand out, mutters the secret incantation taught to him by his uncle, and the alcove shows itself.
It might even be Draco's own fault for never speaking with Potter after the Battle here and answering questions Potter had tried asking and gave up bothering him with since.
Draco smiles in the dark, kisses up Harry's cheek and nuzzles Potter's throat.

already cast upon it. Potter's chair is far to the side, mostly away from the eyes, and Draco takes a second to glance up at the full moon starting to move up the sky, unobstructed by clouds and enhanced by the last bit of sun.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Trelawney speaks his name, and Draco sighs, attempting to look unimpressed and unmoved. “Would you care to volunteer?”
And he settles into his seat more with a contented sigh, wishing he had some fucking food next to him to finish the arena's image.
“Point is there's no reason for you to be nervous over someone as such,” Draco grunts, mood souring more with his swallowed heart, stuffed nose, and a reminder of his own standing in society. “Besides, I understand. Personally.”

class, he knows he can break later in the Slytherin alcove, hand around himself and lips parted in a moan, mind running rampant with images of Potter being the one to touch him, of Potter shoving him into a wall outside the Charms room and kissing him senseless.
Armed with the Map in his pocket, Harry decides to try something different this time. Instead of following him to the library in hopes that Malfoy will give some sort of clue up then, he's going to follow him right after their class.
He'd been so fucking excited to trail Malfoy today. He'd felt so
Stalking after a possibly plotting Malfoy is excusable, but going after a Malfoy who might be doing nothing harmful at all makes him feel wrong.

to have to think about me, too.”
Harry's reclined on a lounge chair, hands going from holding his head to sliding down over his face for the briefest of moments. And that's all it takes for him to suck in a breath, square his shoulders, and shove his own feelings down to his gut where they belong.
If he's honest, taking Blaise's suggestion wouldn't be so far fetched. After all, Draco's already been sneaking such moments very late at night in the dorm bathrooms when he wakes from dreams of dragging Potter into empty classrooms and screaming everything in his tortuous heart and mind at the idiot before throwing Potter over a table and snogging the life out of him.
“Still sounds awful, anyway.”
Potter laughs loudly, startling him. “Yeah. He was. I felt...I felt so bad for trying to help him, only for him to fucking
upon him more than any other.
“Bastard. Always thinking the worst,” Draco admonishes and pushes at Potter slightly in retaliation.
Ignore the way I look at you, Potter, don't hear the way I speak.
Blushing furiously, he sits up as much as possible and brings his wand out with a soft
He also knows what Draco Malfoy feels like to kiss, knows what the Slytherin tastes like and how smooth and hard his long cock is in Harry's hand. He knows what his dream self had always known would be there, and Harry succumbs to that tie between them, lips meshing with Draco's as he palms that heated hardness in his hand with desire.

Draco has been using the alcove late at night to avoid Potter, and it's worked perfectly. He's had to use it almost nightly now with Potter being so bold and daring, weaving their legs together in the library twice a week without fail and following Draco to and from the Great Hall a few times a day.

Draco holds his breath, heart lurching bizarrely in his chest. He ignores everyone else around him, doesn't hear the soft discussions of curiosity, just zones in upon Potter's face as he watches Potter stare into his now empty cup.

Nervously, Harry tilts his face, feeling with the tip of his nose and guiding his hand full of Slytherin cock until they touch and his warm breath teases smooth skin. Draco cries out, nails dig into Harry's scalp, and for

. Draco brings the bottle to his lips without looking, sipping a little more before he shoves it away, overburdened. He feels Potter take it from him, their fingers brushing warmly together, and he fights the shiver that threatens his entire body so close for Harry to witness.
The look is still in Potter's gaze when the two Slytherins get up to leave the Great Hall, and Draco believes he knows what it is then.
Harry can't see Malfoy in front of him, but he hears his fast breathing.
Blaise had only started following Draco here
Harry feels immediately slighted, disappointed, and vaguely rejected in a different way than usual, but he sees the object of his confusion stop in the mixture of cross traffic.
Blaise only smirks and cuffs his shoulder as he leaves, and Draco tells Goyle and Crabbe to go on without him, moving slowly down after another crowd from the far left of the room to funnel out together.
Potter snickers against him, but angles his face for a kiss, fingers moving to grip at his hip. “I've spent
Potter stares at the bottle, and Draco barely notes that it's hardly half full at this point between the two of them. Harry drinks a bit more, contemplates something for a moment, then whispers, “Draco? Promise me you won't...won't....”

Potter sheepishly swishes the bottle a little. “I honestly don't know. Ginny and I had been sort of expected to be together, I think. And Cho was attractive, but...I got more out of that for having any more reason to be jealous of Cedric. People thought he was perfect.”
he shares with Potter, Blaise simply nodded and marked it, not needing to push Draco anymore than that.
“Really?” Potter asks, sounding at once curiously excited and somehow disappointed.
As Harry runs for the library, hoping Malfoy will show within the hour there, he remembers Zabini changing his usual spot at the Slytherin table this morning.
Draco taps his fingers upon the desk, wondering just what the bloody hell
Teeth gleam as Harry smiles again. “Fine, fine. Okay. Um.”
Draco stomps Blaise's foot as he hears Weasley's snickers from among several Gryffindors chuckling lowly, and he turns, noticing that the professor is smiling at him and gesturing for him to step on down to her table at the front.
Draco folds his fingers together over his expensive jacket.
“I think that is supposed to tell us.” He nodded at the single memory vial that was out of place in the middle of the neatly made bed.
"It's probably about the interview Professor."
They deserved their ending. And I got the chance to tell you all what they went on to do with their lives. This was just thrown together over the past few hours and posted straight away, so forgive any rough editing. It meant more to me to get this out there than it did for it to be well edited haha.
“He’s Hagrid's brother…Half brother.” Harry looked slightly confused, and a little bit disgusted at the idea of a Wizard having sex with a giantess.
"Potter!" Fuck. Umbridge was striding towards him in all of her pink-ness.
"You can." Potter said, and his words were so full of trust and blind Gryffindor faith that he had Draco almost believing that he could.
He hurried up to Gryffindor tower, using every shortcut he knew so that he could shower quickly and still make it down to the Great Hall without everyone suspecting he was up to something. He hurried through the common room and climbed up to the dormitory, almost running head first into Ron in the open doorway to their shared dorm.
“No. I’ve kept the one with all the origins of Obliviate, I think that might have some use. But apart from that I’m not seeing anything here that applies to what we need.” Harry picked up the two books he had discarded and followed Hermione down the rows so he could slot the two books back into their places.
He twisted around to see who could possibly be talking about him, sounds tended not to travel that far in a Library so whoever it was had to be close. He listened for a few more seconds as the stranger's conversation continued. They were talking about memory charms and Obliviate, and he had no idea why. He had lost his memory through a Quidditch accident after all, and as far as anyone else knew he had been at St Mungo's for the entire duration of his time away from Hogwarts. He was the only one who knew that he’d only been in St Mungo's for a week before being collected and taken to the Dark Lord's side.
Meanwhile Draco clutched at his broom, the leather of his fingerless gloves creaked slightly as his fingers tightened on the black wood. He stood behind the rest of the team silently, waiting for their cue to fly out into the centre of the pitch and take their starting positions. He glared slightly at Montague and Pucey who were standing closest to the pitch entrance (and the furthest away from him) but he kept his tongue in check. No matter what he thought of his team mates, he really did want to win this game, and they were already one Chaser down. He found himself smiling slightly at the cheers and hollers from the crowd on the other side of the curtain, he was pretty sure that seventy five percent of the school would be cheering for Hufflepuff, but he still let himself get lost in the excitement. And not to mention, Harry would be out there, cheering him on. That in itself was enough to keep his spirits up. .
Harry was silent for a few moments. Remus nudged Sirius out of the way and took the mirror for himself.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. He knew this memory held information that Harry needed to know, he just wished that Harry had felt comfortable enough to share it with him. Hermione had never let go of his wrist, there had been so much to process that he had forgotten, but the fingernails piercing into his skin were a stark reminder.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes." Potter said with a small nod and he leaned even closer to rest his forehead against Draco’s.
“Step one complete.” Ron said as they started up to the seventh floor corridor at a jog, taking the first shortcut from the Entrance Hall up the first few floors of the Castle.
“I think I’d prefer that.” Draco flushed again at Harry's simple answer and averted his eyes back to the flagstone floor in deep thought.
People have been asking and I tried to find a way to shoehorn it in but it just didn't fit anywhere, Pansy's Mother was the one to save Harry. I wanted so much to get it in this chapter but it was all from Draco's point of view and it just didn't fit.
"We were supposed to-"
aren't anything, Potter. We fuck. And then we regret it the next morning. I apologise for wanting to spend my evening with someone who actually wants to say more than
The look that Hermione shot him from across the room made his skin crawl and his stomach roll. That wasn’t a look that said ‘all is well’, that was a look you gave someone when a family member had just died. Draco apologised to the two former Ministry employees and excused himself from their discussion about future policy reform after the war was over. He hoped that Hermione’s problem wouldn’t take too long for them to solve, it was almost lunchtime and he knew he couldn’t be late to this lunch date with Harry. The way he looked when Draco had left the room that morning had worried him to no end. He knew that Harry had watched Dumbledore’s memory, it had gone from standing on the edge of the desk next to the Pensieve, to tucked away in Harry’s bedside drawer. He hadn’t pushed so far because he knew Harry needed space to process, but it had got to the point where he needed answers. He needed to know what had caused this mental rift between them and he needed to know what Harry was thinking of doing. He wanted to be able to help Harry with his problems.
Harry had come to terms with this moment over the past months. His final hour, literally. He had come to terms with having to walk to his death. Leaving his friends would be hard, but leaving Draco was harder. He knew how his death would affect Draco, and more than once he had wondered how different this moment would be if Draco weren’t in his life. If he had remained no more than a school rival. And then Draco had turned to smile at him, or had kissed him on the cheek, or wrapped his arms around his waist, and Harry quickly realised that having Draco in his life over the past three years was much better than not having him at all. He could die knowing that he had loved with all his heart and had received that same strength of love in return. Many would die tonight, and how many of them could say they had loved with every fibre of their being?
“I think it’s obvious that I want you.” Draco replied, he was avoiding the question, he knew it and Harry knew it. He wasn’t a Gryffindor; he wasn’t about to lay down his thoughts and feelings for Harry to just shoot him down. “What do you want?” Draco asked Harry.
"Pleeese Mr." Albus added, when Draco turned back around the two boys were leaning so far out of the doorway that they were having to hold onto their Father's belt loops to stop themselves from falling out onto the top step. Draco found it utterly charming.
Thanks for being wonderful and happy reading <3
“I want you to tell me everything.” She grabbed his arm and pulled him along to Gryffindor tower so that they wouldn’t miss the curfew. Harry started telling her all about how Malfoy had joined him for his Quidditch practice. How they’d laughed as Malfoy had tried to copy Harry’s Wronski Feint but landed on his face instead. His moaning, wailing more like, about how his face was probably ruined now, his nose probably broken and misshapen, how Harry had cast a quick cleaning charm at Draco’s face and told him not to worry because he was still pretty. And how it had developed from there, moving from the pitch and into the broom shed when Harry had put away the Snitch he had been practising with.
“Think you can help?”
Harry looked at the shimmering surface of the golden locket. He could almost feel it calling to him and his scar prickled uncomfortably in return. He thought about how his magic had reacted to Draco the first time they had allowed themselves to feel more than hate for each other, the way it had prickled under his skin desperate for the touch of his Soulmate. It made Harry queasy to compare the two, their Soulbond was nothing like the dark magic that Voldemort had used.
Thank you to all of my wonderful, amazing, supportive readers. You've made this such a pleasant experience. I've never written anything as monstrous as this trilogy and I massively look forward to sharing the next one with you. Unfortunately it's yet to be finished, and I prefer to finish my fic before posting so that I can keep a daily schedule. It won't be another 140,000 word behemoth though, it'll be shorter and will hopefully be a nice little closer to Harry and Draco's story.
“Wait!” Harry caught Ron’s wrist as he went to lift the glass, “Protection spells.” He explained when Ron raised an eyebrow.
"Continue." Draco tried to sound like he wasn't begging. He failed.
“Ah, will you call again when he’s with you. Narcissa would like to talk to him.”
"You got your magic back?" Hermione asked as the stag continued to pace back and forth in front of them, "Both of you did. Wow, Malfoy…" She gave the swooping owl a look of appreciation and Draco practically preened under the unspoken admiration.
Hope you all had a lovely Christmas and I mentally toast you all to the end of a truly fucked up year.
“You were mean. You were... arseholes!”
Completed and updated daily (as much as possible).
A great ear-splitting grin had been plastered across his face. His previously stupid blonde hair was windswept and feathered across his forehead, having broken free from the spelled confines of its usual perfectly manicured appearance. There had been a streak of dirt smudged across his cheek and collected under his fingernails and around his nail beds, he had been chasing the snitch so close to the ground that when the snitch darted out of his reach at the last second he caught nothing more than a handful of mud. Luckily he was more successful the second time round, his fingers had closed over the snitch in a vice like grip and in that moment Harry had seen the human side to Draco Malfoy. And he was the most beautiful person Harry had ever looked at. So he had called over to Draco to release the snitch, and bet him that he couldn't catch it again.
“Before dinner, I was looking for you, I found a couple of spells that I thought we could try. I thought they’d be good for the group to learn.” Harry glanced around at the other students still milling around, waiting to leave.
“You know I do.” Harry answered honestly.
All porn, no plot. Literally, wall to wall porn.
"EXPECTO PATRONUM!"
“Not yet...I don’t...kn-” Harry stammered as his vision darkened and his balance failed him. The searing hot pain jack-knifing through his forehead was secondary to the hissing voice that had forced its way into his mind.
“Let’s get the Snape and the Death Eaters out first, then we can start fortifying the castle and I can get into the office.” Harry said. This had been Ron’s rudimentary plan while they had been walking through the tunnel and it had sounded so much easier then.
“I can’t find Ron.” She was wringing her hands together and Draco had to reach out and pry her fingers apart to stop her from fidgeting.
“What do we do now?” Draco asked some minutes later, as he looked down at the stone flagstones.
“Oh, yes of course. He’s probably about finished actually. We hadn’t planned to hang out tonight but I’ll go and find him. Call you back in a bit?” They said their goodbyes and Harry left the conversation feeling significantly lighter than he did going into it.
“I suggest you move away.” She glared at him, he returned it with a sneer. But he turned away and went back to his table anyway, it wouldn’t do to draw attention to himself.
“The fact that it was a Horcrux talking to you should be enough for you to know that it was wrong. But yes, it was wrong. You could never be dark Harry, you’re just too good and too noble for that to ever happen. And as for your soul...well, since it is equally mine as it is yours I think I would be able to tell if it was fractured.” Harry turned his body halfway onto the bed so that he could finally look at Draco. The contact between them was broken, but under the scrutiny of those pale grey eyes Harry didn’t find himself missing the feeling of having Draco plastered against him.
Madam Hooch blew the whistle. And the match began.
“Is this Dumbledore’s memory?” She asked, it was the first time Hermione had seen it and she looked down at it with careful consideration. Her earlier franticness was forgotten in light of the mystery that awaited them. Draco just nodded as he leaned over the side of the bed to pick it up, “I thought Harry hadn’t watched it yet?”
He spent the rest of the evening talking to Sirius and Remus about what had been going on since Christmas. They tried to suggest some places where Harry could take the DA meetings but they all weren’t really suitable so Harry just put it to the back of his mind once again, he was pretty sure they wouldn’t be able to do anything with the DA for the rest of the year, as much as Hermione had tried to convince him otherwise.
“Yes, I do.” Draco answered. While he did so he took the plate that Harry was handing to him, sliced chicken with mash potatoes and broccoli, simple but hearty and it also smelled delicious. Draco had no idea that Harry even knew how to cook. Actually he didn’t know very much about Harry at all. Their usual conversations were based around small talk and barely concealed innuendos, as they tried to work out the fastest way to fall into bed with each other.
“I’ll be back in a minute.” Draco squeezed Harry’s hand as he walked past him to leave the office.
“Ready?” Draco asked. He looked to Hermione who was already nodding and holding onto his wrist. Without allowing himself a second thought Draco leaned forward and plunged his head into the Pensieve.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m studying Potter.” Draco said, but he didn’t exactly say no, so Harry persisted.
“And Hagrid thought…that the best place for him…was a School full of students?” Draco said slowly, he looked horrified.
"Yes, Professor?"
He turned back to Draco, who was rising to his feet along with a few other Slytherins, Crabbe and Goyle being two of them. He turned to look at Harry briefly before exiting the hall with his peers. Harry allowed himself a private silly smile and scarfed the rest of his dinner before the plates cleared.
“Great bat.” Sirius sneered, and Harry was once again brought back to that memory and his Godfather's cruel words, ‘
." Draco was trying to work out whether Potter had said that out loud or in his head.
"France." Draco said honestly. He had apparated into the country that afternoon specially for the Event and hadn't had the chance to get in touch with any of his friends or colleagues. "Oh." Potter said and then after an awkward pause where Draco's hands were still fisted into the material at his shoulders and his legs were still wrapped around Harry's waist, Harry said "Do you want to keep talking about my ex-wife? Or can I fuck you now?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“We were young,” Sirius began, “That’s the first thing that you have to remember. We were young and we were stupid.”
"Kids are with Ginny tonight." Potter announced. To any bystander it was a perfectly acceptable conversation, but Draco knew better. The kids are with Ginny, my house is empty, my
“I’ll be up in a minute! Tell him I said he had to share!” Harry called up.
“Ex-excuse me?” Draco stuttered. His eyes were wide and his mouth had fallen open from shock.
“But- How? How has no one noticed?”
Draco hovered overhead for the majority of the game. Every now and then he would shoot over to one side of the pitch, making Summerby believe he had spotted the Snitch, only to start drifting about once he had made it to the other end. Even throughout his strategy of throwing off the opposite Seeker he kept both eyes peeled for the Snitch, he needed to catch it quickly. Being one Chaser down was already starting to take its toll on the overall score. All of the Slytherin plays counted on there being three Chasers to pull them off, so Montague and Pucey were left to figure it out between themselves. Draco watched as goal after goal was scored by the Hufflepuff team. His jaw clenched. Once again he noticed Summerby starting to zone in on one area of the pitch, as though he had seen something, so Draco bent low over his broom and shot straight forward, brushing by the Hufflepuff and knocking him off balance, causing him to lose sight of whatever had caught his eye.
“You’ve always been my Brother.” Ron said once they stepped back.
"I just think everyone might expect me to be an Auror."
Scenes of a sexual nature in the first half of the chapter
“She’ll definitely be with us. You should see the way she looks at Snape, it would almost be funny if it weren’t so serious.” Seamus said with a half smile. Seamus always was the easiest one to crack a grin.
“You can’t be without your wand Harry.” Ron replied as Harry tried to hold it out for him to take.
“You two, teeth, faces, pyjamas. I’ll be up in a minute.” Harry half shouted up the stairs, loud enough for his sons to hear him, but not loud enough to wake the sleeping baby. Draco sidled past him and showed himself to the door but Harry followed.
He was torn. He'd probably make a pretty good Auror, his grades weren't quite there but he wasn't so far off that it would be unfeasible. He liked the idea of catching bad guys and putting them away but the idea of putting himself on the front line for the rest of his life might just be more than he could handle. Not to mention the paperwork he'd have to deal with. Quidditch on the other hand, he was good at. He was brilliant at it, actually. And he truly loved being up in the air and chasing after a Snitch. But…was he good enough to play professionally? He was good at Hogwarts but out of Hogwarts he was a little fish in a big pond. Not to mention there was only ever one Seeker per team, it wasn't like being a Chaser where you had three times the opportunity. He was sure there would be a lot of competition, and he didn't quite know how he would feel about stepping even further into the public eye.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, Sirius.” After seeing his happy expression Harry suddenly wasn’t so sure that he wanted to bring his spirits down by talking about his dead best friend. He knew how hard Sirius was finding being stuck inside the dusky house of his ancestors and he didn’t want to drag his down even further.
"Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini all came to the Village today. Has anyone seen them?" His question was met with silence, "Anyone?!" He shouted over everyone's heads.
“Not yet.”
“He’s just a little giant.” Harry thought for a second, “In comparison to other giants… apparently. Not that I’ve ever seen a giant.”
“He’ll do whatever it takes to claim Hogwarts.” Harry replied, he tried his best to keep his expression blank. He needed to be strong right now, especially in front of the younger students who were casting glances to him out of the corner of their eyes.
"Has anyone seen the Slytherins?" Has anyone seen Draco he wanted to ask.
*Spoiler Alert*
"Weasley." Hermione corrected, as she always did when Draco fell back into calling her by her former last name.
Thank you all for the lovely comments! I read every single one of them and I'm replying where I can, each one brings a smile to my face and makes my day just a little better.
(he didn't run as a general rule, and he was regretting that decision immensely right now). He couldn't believe he had to waste precious time pacing back and forth in front of a goddamn blank wall at a time like this, and by his third turn his pace had slowed down immensely but
“Why were you all like that in the first place?”
“I need to think... I think.” Draco’s brow wrinkled in thought. Everything inside him was torn between accepting Harry and rejecting him. Harry sensed that the conversation was over and he stood up straight, stretched his arms above his head and motioned towards the door.
“You’ve been through so much, Harry, you were forced to mature quickly in order to get through everything that you’ve been faced with. Your Dad and I, we didn’t have to come into that maturity until much later in life. I’m sorry for what you saw.”
“Would you like to go out for dinner? Sometime?” Draco blurted out. It had definitely not been in his plan. But he found that he didn’t have time to regret it, because Harry’s confused expression transformed into a shy grin.
“I don’t mind.” Draco said quickly with a glance behind him to meet Harry’s eyes, green green eyes, “You don’t have to call me Mr. Draco, just Draco is fine.” Draco wasn’t around children very often, and he hardly knew how to act around them or speak around them, but no matter what relationship he had with Harry he wasn’t about to be cruel or mean for the sake of it.
"They left you?" Harry said in disgust.
Harry’s nose was full of the unmistakable smell of sterile equipment, he almost felt like he was in the Hospital Wing, and Madam Pomfrey would come by any moment to give him another dose of whatever Potion he needed. But there was no hospital and no magic in sight, the room was full of electronic equipment. A radio playing the music which was drifting overhead, a TV showing the news with the sound muted and the subtitles turned on. It was as Muggle as possible. That’s why he had chosen this place. He could have gone somewhere magical of course, but everyone knew who he was, and half of those people probably wanted to kill him.
Draco was hovering over the Locket, panting heavily and holding the fang limply in one hand.
“Yeah, sorry about that. Anyway, dinner?” Harry unlocked the door with a flick of his wand, he ignored Draco’s indignant outrage and laughed off the Slytherin’s spluttering behind him.
“So what else has been going on?” Sirius asked. And Harry jumped right into telling him about Draco being his Soulmate, about their brief split, about Warrington and his transfer, and how Umbridge had blasted her way into the Room of Requirement. It was nice to talk to him. Harry tried not to think about how much he had missed out on by not having his Mum, his Dad and his Godfather in his life. He had never been able to just sit and chat to an adult. The Dursleys had always preferred him to be as silent as possible, he didn’t even know what Vernon would have done if Harry had tried to sit and talk to him about his school work. Whenever he saw Dumbledore there was always something more pressing to talk about than how he was doing in school. And he would never be able to ignore that Mr Weasley was his best friend's Dad, even though he was sure that he would have sat down with Harry if Harry had requested it.
Only a few chapters left now and we're starting to reach the final battle! The next few chapters were, by far, the hardest to write out of all 3 Fics, I hope I did it justice :)
“Come on Harry, you can’t possibly think that he’s in his right mind? He brought a giant to a school!”
"Ginny and I are getting a divorce." Harry said, suddenly serious for the first time all evening, "It's been in the papers all week, where have you been?"
"You're okay. Fuck, you're okay. Thank Merlin." Harry held his hand out and helped Draco to his feet. He was paler than usual, his skin was cold and clammy and he was shaking slightly, he tried to hide it by stuffing his hands in his pockets but he wasn't fooling Harry.
"I know it's Harry. I've known all along. He's not very good at hiding things either."
I look forward to posting the next chapter in 2021 and seeing you all on the other side :)
“You are good Harry.” Draco raised his hands to cup Harry’s jaw gently, “And together our soul is whole.” Draco pressed their mouths together in a soft kiss, “Don’t think on it anymore Darling. It was a desperate piece of a broken soul wanting to cling onto something.” Draco peppered Harry’s mouth and cheeks with a series of small kisses, “Fortunately for me, you’ve already promised me your soul.”
“We should go back to the castle anyway. It’ll be dinner soon and I need a shower. The tower is a little further to go than the Dungeons.” Malfoy looked up at him sharply.
"No, he isn't a stranger. This is Draco, he's...a friend."
"Draco." Harry whispered, and looking into his green eyes, feeling his hands upon his skin, it was almost possible for Draco to forget that they were about to have their Souls sucked out of them.
Harry decided, while Draco’s hands were teasing his shirt up his body and trailing across the now healed dragon tattoo, that he would defer to Draco’s knowledge in this area. Draco said he was good and whole, so he would accept it and allow himself to forget about the doubts in his mind. At least, until proven otherwise.
“I look a mess. I bet my hair is all over the place, you had your hands all over it.” He pulled out his wand and spelled his hair back to its usual coiffed appearance.
The response to the last chapter was phenomenal. Thank you all so much! Please keep commenting I honestly live off them and I try and respond where I can.
"Okay." Draco whispered at the end of a breathy exhale. Then almost immediately he was being folded into Potters arms and his mouth was being taken with a ferocity that only came from being denied for an entire evening. Draco felt Potter twist on the spot and then he was being apparated.
“You know, I hadn’t ever considered what I would actually do after Hogwarts.” Harry peered out of the window next to them and looked over at the lake and the forest below, “Actually living through my teenage years was a bit more of an abstract concept to me.” Draco kicked him under the table, and glared at him.
“So we just need to worry about everyone else?”
Another short one I'm afraid. But we're gearing up for a little bit of drama, so hold onto your hats! Haha
On the off chance that they had made it to a bed Potter would almost always flop over to one side after they both had finished, he would lie across the bed at an odd angle, resting wherever his body had fallen. No doubt at least one leg would always be still tangled between Draco's. His hair would be a bird's nest of impossible softness, mussed up by Draco's hands running through it and tugging on it to get Potter to do what he wanted. His chest would be rising and falling rapidly as he struggled to catch his breath and Draco wouldn't be much better off. Breathless, spent, and only a tiny bit sore. It was in these moments, between "
“They found me out.” She replied, “I didn’t want to tell Draco, he wouldn’t be very happy about me staying in the Castle if he knew.” Harry nodded sadly, he hadn’t heard anything about the Parkinsons through their network. Maybe Voldemort was sensing how low his Death Eater count was and had decided not to kill them, “I’m the best at healing spells, I’ve been useful.”
“Among other things.” Harry muttered as his eyes drifted closed under the physical and emotional onslaught of love that Draco was forcing onto him. Draco chuckled against his skin breathlessly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fortifying the castle?” They looked at him sharply, their jaws had slackened and they were staring at him with wide uncertain eyes. Harry tried not to look either of them in the eye as they simultaneously came to the same conclusion.
"Hello Sir."
“No.” Draco met her eyes head on and brought himself up to his full height, he wasn’t about to be chased away like some first year.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can't do it! I've tried but I can't." Draco was panicking now. The Patronus was protecting them from the front but there was nothing to protect their backs, and the Dementors were closing in.
“For the time being. Not just for Malfoy’s sake either, Voldemort wanted him for something.” Hermione moved onto the next row down and she passed a couple of books over to Harry to put to one side, “Whatever he wants Malfoy for is important enough to take him from Hogwarts and alter the last year of his life.”
Next chapter is a good one! I hope haha
"You're welcome Draco." Harry rolled his eyes. But he knew as well as Draco that his insults were lacking any real heat behind them, he was merely going through the motions until they were on more even footing, "We need to get back to the group. Where are your friends?"
Harry walked down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Dean, Seamus and Neville, it was the day of the Slytherin v Hufflepuff match and Harry was excited to cheer on his boyfriend, even if it meant he was having to support the rest of the Slytherin team in the process. Hermione had opted to stay in the castle, making use of the empty library to monopolise the revision materials for their OWLs. Although she had promised to come meet them after the game so they could all go down to visit Hagrid together, just as they had promised. The half-giant hadn’t been looking his best since his return to the Castle and all three of them were concerned for his well being so they didn’t want to miss this chance to question him properly.
.” Draco bit his bottom lip to stop himself from making any noise, every word from Harry’s mouth was precious to him now, “
A short yet important chapter.
“Harry!” Came the delighted exclamation from Sirius as his gleeful face filled the mirror.
“He just, well he could have done anything to me. We were in there for quite a while. We, you know, did THAT," Harry raised his eyebrows a couple of times to get his point across, "But we chatted for a bit too. And I wanted more, he’s the one that stopped us.” Harry stopped them just outside the common room, the fat lady looked down at them in anticipation, “Will you please trust me Hermione. If anything starts to feel shady, I’ll let you know, but I think this is real.”
Follow the link to the Series or the link posted below to find A Forgotten Promise.
"Yeah, okay, might go drag Hermione out of the library too. That girl needs some serious downtime."
“What did McGonagall say?”
"I can't Potter." Draco said and if it sounded like he was pleading with Harry then he could always blame it on the alcohol. Harry drew close. The street was deserted, and they were late leaving the Gala so there weren't many Witches or Wizards left in the building to follow them out, for all intents and purposes they were alone. Harry's hand landed on his hip, warm and firm over his layers of clothing.
“Malfoy. Shut up.” Harry murmured, any former heat that would be behind his words must have been stored in his cock cause that’s all Draco could feel as he leaned forward and met Harry's lips with his own. It took them both a second to situate themselves. Their noses bumped together awkwardly, and Harry’s neck was tilted at a weird angle, but once they had it figured out it was awesome. Fire bloomed in his lower stomach as Harry’s tongue licked its way into his mouth. Turning their kiss from awkward to downright filthy in a matter of seconds. Draco wouldn’t like to exaggerate his own skills, but he’d kissed his fair share of people, men and women, and he was pretty damn good at it. But Harry had skills. Skills that had Draco gripping his shoulders, stopping himself from collapsing to the floor when his knees failed to support him. One of Harry's arms clamped around his waist like a steel band (obviously sensing his current knee predicament), while his other hand cupped the back of Draco’s neck and tugged lightly at the hair at the base of his skull. His tongue was doing dastardly things and Draco was following his lead, pressing as close as was possible with the layers of clothing still between them. Their bodies moved together. Hips grinding against hips. It was only when he could feel himself climbing towards climax that he put both of his hands against Harry’s chest and pushed away.
“…The book mentions swords specifically but I’m sure there’s other things, knives maybe.”
Or it would have been too much, if Draco hadn't cleared his throat and asked. “What if…” He trailed off, and summoned any and every ounce of Gryffindor courage that might have been buried deep inside, “What if that turns out to be a very long time?” He raised his eyes to meet Harry's.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I won’t need it anymore, and I like knowing that it’s going somewhere safe.” He wouldn’t need to put up a fight when he came face to face with Voldemort.
“Has that ever been done before?” Harry asked, remembering the Memory wing of St Mungo's and the confused face of Gilderoy Lockhart who resided there.
(See the end of the chapter for
Without a thought to what he was doing Draco found himself standing in front of Harry’s Pensieve with the vial uncorked and hovering at a tilt over the swirling surface. And then he stopped himself. This was incredibly private, it could be something that was meant for Harry’s eyes only, that would certainly explain why he had been so silent on the subject all these months.
"Drink, Draco?" He asked and they made their way around the dancefloor. Stopping now and them for Draco to cordially introduce his date to his co-workers and other higher-ups in the Ministry.
“Are you even bothered?” Draco asked, as his chest finally pressed fully against Harry’s and Harry’s firm thigh found its way between his own. His mouth hovering only inches away.
“Ron!”
“You have a great fucking mouth, I know that for sure.” Harry replied., but he took Draco’s words to heart and let his arms fall away so the Slytherin could take a step back. Harry was panting slightly, and a sheen of sweat had sprung up across his skin from the heat that had fired up between them. Draco watched him lean back against the closed and locked door of the broom shed. His trousers still tented slightly, and Draco tried not to eye him up, dragging his eyes away every time they drifted down towards Harry’s straining fly. He then swiped the hem of his shirt across his forehead, lifting his shirt a few inches and giving Draco a sneak peek at his stomach. Tanned abs told Draco two things, that Harry regularly had his shirt off outside in the sun, and that he was really, incredibly, fucking fit. He must work out on a regular basis because there was no way abs like that came from Quidditch alone.
“The war?”
“You have white hair.” James pointed out.
I just couldn't leave it as it was. I felt like my boys and all of you needed a proper ending.
“Good point. Yeah, let’s practice those before the next lesson. I think we should finish stunners next and I think move onto Patronus after that. I think that one will take a few weeks to learn and it’ll give everyone the motivation they need over the Christmas holidays.”
“Sure thing.” Ron left the dormitory and headed down to the common room, leaving Harry alone amongst the red and gold decor. He grabbed everything he would need for a shower and set himself up in the furthest stall from the door.
“On?” Ron prompted when it looked like Harry wasn’t about to clarify exactly what he meant by that.

Harry, with Draco’s green and silver scarf draped around his neck, laughed and joked along with his friends as they pushed and nudged each other on their way down the grassy slopes to the entrance of the stands. He didn’t hesitate to push his way through the crowds to get to the last gap in the front row, Ron managed to squeeze in by his side and the other three boys had to huddle together on the row behind them. Even though he was wearing a Slytherin scarf Harry had promised them that he wouldn’t cheer any of the Slytherin goals (like he would anyway, Pucey and Montague were no friends of his) as long as they let him cheer Draco on when he went for the Snitch. He stood against the barrier and hollered and whistled along with the crowd cheering for Hufflepuff but hoping for the Slytherin win, and just let himself get swept up in the joviality of the Quidditch bug that permeated through the school every match day.
He had never had the chance to explore the downstairs area of the house. The hallway from the door leading to the front sitting room and the kitchen was lined with photos. Harry, Hermione and Ron in some, Harry and the Weasleys, Hermione and Ron's wedding day with Harry stood between his best friends wearing formal black robes with a rose pinned to his chest, looking youthful and happy. Then Draco noticed that there were some gaps in the frames, Harry and Ginny's wedding perhaps? Removed from the wall after the little adulterer finally came clean and left Harry and the children, only showing up once or twice a month to take them for a night or two. From then on nothing but baby pictures, a small child growing up into a toddler, the addition of a second and then a third, up until the present, the three children and their Father dressed in matching Christmas jumpers grinning up at the camera with a large decorated Christmas tree in the background, taken just a few months ago Draco presumed.
"Tell me you don't want me and I'll walk away. I won't bother you again." Draco opened his mouth to say the words, but they caught in the back of his throat and his lips and tongue refused to move around the syllables. He did want Harry. He wanted him so much his heart ached. But Harry wasn't ready for another real relationship, he was still healing over what Ginny had done and Draco was too old to spend the next few years waiting for him to be ready. The best thing for both of them would be a clean break, so they both could move on.
“James had grown up with the same prejudices as every Pureblood on the light side, he had been told that Slytherins were evil, and he was jealous that Snape was so close to Lily, they used to be best friends. And I was so busy rebelling against my family, trying to make a name for myself away from the Black family that I was rejecting every reminder of the Slytherin House, Snape was an easy scapegoat since your Father already had something against him.”
The voices were coming from behind him, from the Restricted Section. He tried to peek through the bars but whoever was there, was completely hidden from view by the tall bookshelves and the darkened depths. The voices were moving away from him now. He wanted to ignore them. Every part of him was telling him to keep his head down and not get involved. But he found himself standing up, and skirting down the metal barrier, following the muffled sound of voices as they moved down the aisle. There were only a handful of people who actually said the Dark Lord's name and Draco had a sneaking suspicion that he knew exactly who was on the other side of the gate, but that didn’t mean that he was about to let the subject lie, he needed to know if they suspected anything else. If his cover was blown then he would need to leave the school immediately. Draco’s hand was on the gate before he could even stop himself. But a loud clearing of a throat behind him stopped him in his tracks.
*Spoiler warning*
"Huh?" Potter asked, pulling back slightly and looking at Draco in confusion.
Falling in love with Harry Potter, how could he have been so stupid? He had realised it two months ago, after another night together. Harry was splayed half across the bed, his arms thrown out on either side of him and the lights overhead made the sheen of sweat on his chest glisten. Draco had said very firmly that it was the last time, that he was an adult and he needed to get on with his life. He couldn't be Potter's rebound forever. Potter had shrugged and said, okay. A month and another event later Draco was dragging himself out of Potters bed once again, "
Months of Draco trying to cut it off. Half heartedly. Because the truth was, he never felt more alive than when it was Harry
“But how do we destroy it?” Hermione asked from the other side of the desk. Harry had a feeling she was trying to keep as much distance between herself and the locket as she could, even Draco hadn’t leaned closer or tried to touch it.
“How do you know?”
” Harry looked up and smiled, and though he couldn’t have known where Draco would be standing, it almost felt like Harry was looking directly into his eyes.
Harry palmed his own wand in one hand and the fang in the other hand. With nods of assent from the other three he took a deep breath and flicked open the tiny catch on the side of the large golden pendant. He jumped back with baited breath, expecting dark magic to explode from the small piece of jewellery and wreak havoc . But nothing happened. He looked up at them all again and reached forward once more to open the locket but it was tightly sealed. He looked over at Hermione, Ron, and Draco in half-desperate confusion, if he couldn’t open the locket should he try to destroy it from the outside?
Would like to wish you all a Happy New Year. I hope 2021 brings with it happiness to you all.
“Hagrid said that all the other giants were bullying him, because he’s only a baby.”
“He’s coming here.” Neville said, and he didn’t need to form it into a question to know the answer. He looked away from Harry, and at the students around the room. Some were as young as first year, they were chatting away among themselves, their energy revitalised by the healing potions and by seeing Harry and Ron returning.
"You asked someone out because they were
“This is so fucking dumb.” Draco murmured under his breath as he was pulled a few inches closer by the hand buried in the front of his robes.
Harry carefully passed the sword over to Ron, just like he had promised Draco. Ron took it sombrely. He knew the situation, Harry had filled him in as they walked through the passage to Hogwarts. Use the sword, kill Nagini, destroy the Horcrux. He also knew that this was almost the end of the road for Harry. He hadn’t wanted to believe it, and a part of him still fought against the inevitability. But he knew nothing he said would convince Harry otherwise. Harry would always put the fate Wizarding World above himself, that’s just who he was.
“Thank you.” Draco said with a small smile.
.” The darkness continued to swirl, carrying with it the whisper of Voldemort’s soul. Harry shook his head desperately, trying to drown out the lure of the whisper. He had a One already, he had Draco, his Soulmate.
“Blaise?” Harry asked.
“What do you need from the office?” Neville asked.
He didn’t particularly want to.
“Well done today.” Harry said finally with a cheerful grin and he nudged Draco’s knee with his own under the table.
His world spun around him, making him dizzy and disorientated, all he could rely on was the hand that held tightly to his wrist, reminding him that he wasn’t alone in this. When he finally landed on his feet he had to take a couple of seconds to regain his balance and to check that Hermione was standing solidly next to him. Then he allowed himself to turn and look at the scene they had found themselves deposited into.
Scenes of a sexual nature, just a smidge of it :)
“You did it.” Harry whispered. Draco dropped the venom tipped tooth onto the rug, it dropped like a weight and landed on its side at their feet.
"Draco," She said with a long sigh, that really seemed to emulate her suffering, "Have you even asked Harry how he feels?"
Draco felt sick, and he felt dizzy. He wanted to sit down somewhere, just so he didn’t have to concentrate on keeping his balance anymore. Luckily Hermione was acting like a wonderful crutch right now, if she weren’t here he wasn’t sure he would be able to keep himself together. All he wanted to do was grab onto the stony faced Harry who was standing as a ghostly figure next to him, but he couldn’t, this Harry was no more real than the two figures pacing the Headmasters office in front of them.
“It sounds to me,” Draco’s voice was soft from behind Harry and he spoke slowly just in case anything he was about to say triggered Harry’s fleeing reflex, “Like it was a piece of magic that sensed it’s end and was desperate to cling onto the only person available.”
The big reveal?
Ron climbed down the short ladder first, at the bottom he caught Ginny in a hug and did the rounds, shaking hands, slapping people on the back in solidarity. When Harry descended he went right to a very nervous Pansy. Something was wrong there and he had to do right by Draco by checking on his best friend first.
Harry motioned to Ron who had been hiding at the other side of the room and together they skirted around the house tables, ignoring the points and whispers that followed them as they went. They left through the double doors just as McGonagall ordered for the remaining Death Eaters to be taken to one of the dungeons.
"Fuck them. What do you want to do?"
And just a little summery to keep you interested...
“But we- “
"It's a nightmare Hermione." Draco cried to her three days later as he sat on the sofa in her office and ate his lunch while she worked, "I'm in love with the sod and it's all for nought."
Warning for a dialogue heavy chapter. I lost the first version of this one and I really struggled to re-write it, so it became a bare bones type of chapter. Hopefully it still gets the plot across.
“You stupid, stupid man,” Draco whispered to himself.
“No, one more. But I don’t know what the last one is.” The Diary, Ring, and Diadem had been destroyed, leaving them to destroy the Locket and the Cup, with one left to find.
"James! I told you not to open the door, it could be danger- Oh, Draco?" Draco stood speechless as he tried to take in the sight before him. The child that had opened the door, James the oldest, was soon joined by another boy, Albus Draco thought he was called, and they were both looking up at him with wide eyes and big grins. Harry was tall and wide, he seemed to almost fill the doorway with his broad shoulders but Draco was sure that was just his imagination. His hair was messy, his glasses were crooked, there was a stain on the front of his sweater, and he had a beard. Draco had never seen him anywhere other than at work and at the very formal parties they were both mutually invited to. Both of which Harry was clean shaven and well presented, but it seemed that on his days off he didn't bother to shave. The scruff on his chin was dark and even, a massive contrast to Draco's which always grew in uneven patches, he would never be a man who could pull off a beard. Unlike Potter. Who looked simply phenomenal. Rugged and sexy and Draco just wanted to rake his fingers through the scruff of hair that covered the line of his jaw and the curve of his cheeks. He wanted to but he wouldn't, because of the two boys who were still staring up at him and the small sleepy baby girl who was snuggled into her Father's shoulder, Lily, Draco's mind supplied.
“Nice one.” Ron said simply.
“He didn’t tell you.” Draco scoffed, and he sat down in the large wing-back chair with an incredulous chuckle, “No, of course he didn’t. Because why would he want to make your life easier?” The subject of Dumbledore was always a sore spot for Draco, he had never really trusted the older Wizard, and sometimes Harry’s gullibility had him trusting people he shouldn’t.
“Ready?”
“What is it?” Draco probed, he could feel Harry’s regret and despair.
Harry’s fists were clenched at his sides, his back was covered in sweat from the trek through the long humid tunnel, and he was sure he had brushed his dirt covered hands across his face more than once. He supposed he looked a little like Ron did at that moment, sweaty and dirty, and only a little bit out of breath from the veritable hike that took them from the Hogshead to Hogwarts. Aberforth Dumbledore (who’d ever thought the old barman was Dumbledore’s brother?) had led them to the painting of Ariana Dumbledore without asking any questions. Being Harry Potter made one or two things a little easier.

“We’ll need to rally the students.” Neville said, “But most of them will be willing. The Professors too.”
Just porn, no plot.
“When are you going down?” Ron chose to say as he reluctantly took the Holly wand from Harry’s grasp.
(See the end of the chapter for
” Harry smiled sadly and Draco dashed away the tears that clung to his cheeks as he held himself back from trying to reach out for Harry.
“It’s not anything like that. It’s not bad. It’s good. Really good. Seriously, really fucking good.” Harry grinned widely.
“Of course not, not since we found each other.” Draco wanted to touch him, but he had to let Harry make the first move.
So, this one had about three re-writes haha
?” Snape had said.
My apologies for missing a couple of days, some Covid restrictions in England are being dropped so pubs and non-essential shops are opening Monday, which means back to work for myself and my Hubby. So I've had to get used to taking care of a Toddler by myself now that the Hubby is back at work prepping for his pub re-opening. Crazy times we've been living in.
A little Interlude perhaps?
On another note.
Emerald.VS.Silver
“Maybe he was going to show me how, when he asked me to meet him?” At the top of the Astronomy Tower, the night Snape had killed him, Harry thought to himself. He didn’t need to spell it out for them, the others knew exactly which meeting he was referring to.
“Fine! Fine. Fine.” Draco batted his hands away and packed up his things. Passing his bag over to Harry who took it without complaint.
"Interview? What interview?" She was glaring at him, without even bothering to hide her distaste behind the usual thin veil of sickly sweetness.
“Fine... Okay... Erm.... Don’t tell Ron. Not yet anyway. I will tell him, but it needs to be at the right time because he will absolutely flip.”
Draco looked back at him, and with a whisper that didn't seem befitting for such a complicated and powerful spell Draco cast, "Expecto Patronum."
"Malfoy." Potter followed him, "Please."
“Harry?” Hermione questioned. Her steps quickened to keep up with Draco as his frantic pace turned into a jog.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You can't say it, because it's not true." Harry leaned in close and almost like they were magnetized together Draco could feel his head tilting up in response. Offering his mouth to Harry like a gift wrapped present on a silver platter, "Come home with me?" Harry murmured as the space between their mouths decreased steadily.
True to his word Draco apparated right to the boundary of the wards that surrounded Harry's house after he had finished his work day. He hadn't been very productive. He spent more time thinking about his confrontation with Harry than he did his work and he was sure he had filed at least three things incorrectly and signed off on one or two things that would definitely come back to bite him one arse at a later date. He stepped through the wards before he could second guess himself and walked right up to the red front door. Of course it was red, with a shiny gold door knob and a knocker in the shape of a lion's head roaring in suspended animation, bloody Gryffindors.
“I sent Ron in to speak to Harry. I thought he might have been thinking...But I asked him to wait-” His sentences were short and cut off as they jogged through the manor.
“Your hair looks sexy when it’s a bit messy, makes you look approachable.”
"Maybe you scared them off." Draco suggested.
“Harry Potter!”
“Why would someone need a knife if they have a wand though?”
“I don’t know. He was torturing Conners, the Wizard you healed-”
“The sword is in the Headmaster’s Office.” Harry said, he still couldn’t bring himself to call it Snape’s office, to him it would never belong to Snape.
Just a quick note to say thank you for all the Kudos and Comments so far. I honestly live off it and it makes me so happy to get those notifications.
"You jerk off or something mate? That was the longest shower you've ever had." Harry laughed and punched him in the arm before grabbing himself a helping of everything nearby.
By Draco's calculation they had been fucking for three months by the time New Years Eve rolled around. Even though they only ever got together during parties and events Draco was starting to find it difficult to keep track of all of their encounters, the Christmas season never passed by without at least one Ball every weekend. There were always multiple parties to attend, one at every Ancient Wizarding Manor, and multiple charity galas that leaned into the spirit of giving that everyone seemed to feel around the holidays. As well as the formal Holiday Ball at the Ministry, which saw the invitation of foreign dignitaries and important British contacts, and then an informal Ministry staff party held at a Wizarding hotel. So suffice to say by New Years Eve Draco's sex drive was well and truly fed.
I hope you'll all forgive me for taking a few days out of posting. It was unexpected or I would have warned you in the last chapter, but I got a little overwhelmed with this being my first Christmas with a child, and finally being able to see family after a long year of little to no contact (Fuck you Covid). But posting should be back to daily from now on, perhaps a couple days off for New Years, but we shall see :)
"Where's Hermione?"
A Forgotten Promise now live!
“I’ve offered him the Orders protection. If he wants it.”
"Potter." Draco whimpered because they were still appearing behind him. They were constantly pushing forwards towards Potter, filling the gaps the Patronus was making, and he couldn't carve a path for them both, there were too many. It was as though the entire army of Dementors had known that Harry Potter was on this street, but Draco didn’t know enough about them to know if they could remember someone’s Patronus form, or even if they had enough sense to target one particular person. Draco always thought that they were only drawn in through strong happy memories, the happier the memories the more of a target a person was.
too well. The more alcohol Harry consumed the more handsy he became. The more handsy he became the more Draco melted into his touch. Until Draco, equally drunk, was following Harry into the lift.
Draco took the champagne flute with a steady hand. Holding it by the stem in the proper manner and tilting it towards his lips for a slow slip. If he was ever to resist Harry he needed to take it slow on the alcohol. Harry seemed to have no such intentions, he held the glass firmly around the middle and took a long deep gulp. Draco watched his throat move as he swallowed, he followed the bob of Harry's Adam's apple and tried not to swallow in response. He could feel his cheeks already starting to flush, a visceral reaction to Potter’s presence that would not be stamped down no matter how much he tried.
"Let's get back to the castle. Make sure everyone's okay." Harry turned to walk toward the shack with Ron and Hermione at his heels. Draco paused. He wasn't part of their little group. He didn't belong.
"Yes of course. A date would be lovely." Draco smiled at him and quickly gave him the information for the Gala.
“You really should Harry, he might have told you how he had destroyed them.”
"Surely not. I find it's nice to have a bit of space every now and then."
Just a short one today, I felt like this should be a stand alone chapter before *things* started happening haha.
"With who?" Hermione asked lightly, and shifted the files on her desk so she could find her wand.
“Oh. Do you want Remus to go?” He asked. His expression was obvious, ‘please don’t make me do this by myself.’
Potter's house was modest, although to Draco most houses were modest. He was far too used to Malfoy Manor with its cavernous ceilings and large ballrooms. Harry's house was actually kind of lovely. From previous visits Draco knew that it had four bedrooms, a full suite bathroom and an en-suite attached to Harry's room. Upstairs each door had the children's names plastered in bright foam letters across the front, the boys’ in greens, blues and reds and Lily's in pinks and purples. The first time he had seen it Draco had commented that it was awfully sexist, what if she liked the colour blue.
“Black market?” Ron suggested, “Whoever that RAB was might not have been able to destroy it before You-Know-Who killed them, and their belongings might have been sold off.”
One of the hardest chapters to write and I think I re-wrote it a few times. What was in my head was refusing to be translated into words haha. But I hope it all came across okay. After a few re-writes it starts to get tedious haha.
“If this is real then he’d be daft not to.” She smiled at him and then spoke the password to the Fat Lady and led the way into the Common room.
But Potter holds firm to him and kisses him once more, admitting, “I know. I'm sorry. But I don't anymore. I even got...worried, when Zabini got in the way.”
He hears the thrashing, knows Draco is deeply asleep, but try as he might to smother himself to death with his pillow to not hear Potter's bloody name being
Malfoy is able to circumvent the Map's power but also
The bartender holds his hands up to indicate no offense meant, then slides the bottle as requested. Draco goes behind the crowd, able to avoid people much easier as he's not quite as beloved or personally known by them as Potter is, and he pauses by the long window.
“Unless you're afraid it's literally
He believes Zabini. His fucking face is
“Maybe. Maybe I got tired of thinking about you all the time and wanted
More like...like his own face, still red from Zabini's snark.
Draco can conceive of why. The papers and coverage of Harry Potter as a topic haven't dimmed over the years since the War; they've simply changed focus on him from a child to an adult, digging into speculations as to his personal life and covering the times he is public.
Draco's reaction is instantaneous. His hand slips from Potter's brow, grabs that fucking sexy hair, and jerks that handsome face even closer for the hottest kiss of his fucking life. Harry moans into his mouth, and Draco tastes the Firewhiskey between them, strokes Harry's tongue with his once, and pulls back enough to get more air through his stupid nose.
He feels one of Harry's palms slip down from his shoulder and rest over his heart, too, and he hears the soft possession when Potter also says, “
, thank fuck. And when Malfoy had come to him later that night in the dorms, asking quietly to be penciled in twice a week after a class that Blaise
They pant in the tight space that feels even smaller now, darker and with less air between the two of them gulping loudly. Harry briefly kisses the tip of Draco's very nice cock before resting his lightning scar right to Malfoy's chest, right to Draco's heart.
Draco sniffs. Instantly half of his sinuses get blocked as expected.
The Thing Between
Draco finally lets go of him with a soft sliding squeeze, and then arms rest upon Harry's back, holding him close. Lips brush the back of his head. Fingers stroke along his neck and shoulders.
It only works for seconds at a time, and he rolls his eyes and takes a large swig of it, gasping as the fiery feeling courses through his throat.
“You know, that might actually work on your other friends, but it doesn't me,” Draco begins, and Potter's head swivels to stare at him in surprise. He nods, using the bottle as an accentuating physical object for his point as he tips it Harry's way. “You've come out here, Potter, because you've a thought in your Gryffindor brain that won't leave you be. When you genuinely are bothered by something, you often hide it. You mull over it like this, alone, so you can be stuck in it with no one nagging you or mothering you to death.”
“You know, the woman in the papers.

That smile won't leave his thoughts. The softness it had brought to Draco Malfoy's face had almost entirely changed the Slytherin's appearance. It is
Malfoy's up to something, his brain keeps screaming, refusing to think about anything else.
Harry instantly pulls him half-off his chair and over Potter's own body, snogging the life out of him with unrestrained need.

But then his eyes focus, and it's there. A single symbol made out of the bits of tea.

for something as pathetic as love, Potter. We marry for name and galleons, and we usually demand something grand in the bedroom if we're to endure one another and produce offspring. So in school girls only considered me for my name. And eventually...well. People might treat me better than Father, but I know the truth. You're beloved. I'm still a suspect, a possible snake that might poison someone.”
At first the routine for this new development seems to be restrained to the same two days a week when Malfoy would disappear in the afternoons before. Over a brief spot of time, though, Harry sees the amount increase until it's almost nightly.
Draco nods, too, feeling both empowered and scared for his life, and he waves his wand with a
“Draco.”
“That's a lot for a shot, mate,” the bartender says with surprise.

One particular match Blaise awards Potter victory because Potter manages to rattle Draco well enough by plopping down outside near where Malfoy and Blaise had sat on the weekend, both bickering about N.E.W.T.s. Blaise pretends to not pay a lick of attention while Draco grows continuously uncomfortable from Potter's blatant staring before the idiot Gryffindor walks past with a likely unconsciously sensual strut and a smirk.
“This is fantastic. What a day,” Blaise sighs, sounding very amused indeed.
It's working.
So what if he'd managed to go out of his way after breakfast to trip Potter in the hall, and so what if that's why Potter is
with him, he has to follow after him again, but with Malfoy going at random points throughout the nights of the week, Harry has to use a little magic. A little divination luck of his own.
Draco tries not to let the disappointment show, forcing back his own tangled emotions for the bloke next to him, and he sighs, too. His eyes are sympathetic as he hums, “A someone, mm?”
Blaise's brow goes up before his smirk follows, and he grabs for his notes next to his bed while his friend changes into pajamas, marking a large tally next to Draco's name and circling it with a smile.
He hears the
of all people in the fucking library. Harry calls it luck that the Slytherin didn't fight him, didn't hex him right then and there and instead played back until both of their legs were threaded through the other's beneath the table's surface.
The watch ticks away for a full five minutes, and then Harry gasps as Malfoy's feet reappear in the
Rather than examine it, Harry turns on a cold, alerting shower, and later that morning awkwardly glances towards Malfoy's table at breakfast, green eyes taking in the fresh look the snake seems to have about him as he retorts something Zabini's just said. Malfoy looks healthier than he has, thankfully, and Harry just
“How'd you know?” Potter asks instead, adjusting over his chair to view Draco better.
And then Draco Malfoy appears in his vision standing before the solid wall, dressed not in night clothes but in his clothes from earlier that day. The Slytherin seems to pause a moment, head cocked as if listening and hearing Harry's heavy breathing.
“Cheer up, mate. He's staring again. You know, I never noticed how much he does it. Always thought it was
It's not easy. There's lots of people trying to talk to him in the way, and Harry politely tries to weave through them, green eyes solely focusing on the tall pale Slytherin elegantly walking down the hall away from the crowd dispersing from class.
Draco takes a long draw from the bottle, downs it, and closes his eyes. “There's...someone for me, too.”
, and he's grown quite sick of having to
Some people would tell him to take the reprieve. Years ago, he'd probably even tell himself so.
selfish.”
Draco chokes with embarrassment, scowls, and slams the door behind him as Blaise falls back to his bed in relief.
Harry's been lost since he'd seen that brief glimpse of Draco's flushed, gorgeous face in the light of his wand. Hell, he was likely gone to it all the second the wall had shut them in with the magic.
When he spells himself clean, zips up, and exits the magical alcove, Draco shakes his head, smiling and briefly wondering if Potter will be using another random book in the library as an excuse to spy on him again today.
It's maddening. Surely whatever was so important for Malfoy to be doing and Zabini to be in on as well didn't just...disappear, too?
His lips part over the head of it, and in his mind he sees what he's doing in the darkness just like he had in the one dream. Gently he moves back and forth, taking a little more each time before withdrawing briefly for another lick and even a kiss to the side of the shaft still in his now slippery fingers.
He can feel the depth of his emotions for Potter. He has for some time. But like always, he's hidden it from everyone, including himself, to keep his ego safe. To keep his image safe.
He wants the sighs, the sounds, the music Potter makes with his voice and breath.
Harry almost looks sad next to him, but he nods quietly. “I...me, too, I think. Not just fear of them rejecting me, but...being in the way.”
“Why did you leave her, all those years ago?” Draco asks, the burning need to have that question answered having haunted him for-fucking-ever.
“And what would that be, my dear?” Trelawney asks, eyes magnified behind her giant glasses. Honestly, the woman always appears to be a sentient mass of wiry hair, robes, and eyes. Terrifying.
“If I were planning on killing you, I doubt I'd bring you to a place of enjoyment first,” Blaise mutters and points. “This is a House secret my uncle taught me, a...special...hidden spot passed down from Slytherin to Slytherin among certain circles.”
word in all of that spoken thought.
He tells himself it's because Malfoy is clearly up to no good, as usual.
Potter put that fucking cloak on and tail Draco down the hall?

None of it, that's what.

, obviously.
“Ahh,” he gasps out, catching his breath. Harry smirks down at it, then at Draco. “All right, Malfoy. You tell me why you've been alone all these years, and I'll tell you what's in my head.”
Malfoy waves his wand, mutters something quietly, and the wall begins to shift.
How he manages to make drinking fucking tea into something sensual, Draco doesn't know, but Potter manages to do it perfectly. Draco's teeth gnash his lower lip, his fingers grip the desk, and he feels himself harden a bit again, terrified but unable to do a damn thing about it.
“Harry, I'm not bothered by...I won't judge you for it being a bloke, all right?” he manages to spit out, those fabled butterflies making him almost nauseous. “It's fine. Just surprised me.”
Two days later, though, Blaise rolls his eyes when Potter is in the library, watching Draco and casually following him back out and down the halls.
cup of that awful shit.”
Relief goes through him, but he hides it. Draco tries to sniff again. “Oh.”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco quietly says. “Alone each time except for now.”
Draco waits until Potter steps all the way down, refusing to get closer to him if possible. But when Potter does pass by and Draco takes the steps right after him, the energy around Potter is as thrumming, as
But he relaxes back into the chair, scowling as he drinks more and feels the alcohol really start to take effect. “Well, Potter, it's complicated. Father wants me to marry among a certain circle of people, even tried to arrange something between Pansy and I. She's...a sister to me, for one, and for two, she only cared for me in such respect in school. She's grown out of it, thank Merlin, and we both refused the arrangement. And it wouldn't...wouldn't matter anyway.”
feel better, as awkward as that is to consider.

He hears the steps grow closer, sounding so
“Hey, you fuck.

He makes one stop at the bar and drops a handful of galleons onto the wood. “Firewhiskey.”
The dinner is just as beautiful and delicious, and he partakes of the five course meal alongside everyone else, sandwiched between Longbottom and Lovegood. While Neville chats away with Ron to his left at the wedding party table, Draco notices Luna staring at Potter up from them.

might mean, when he hears Trelawney repeat herself and gaze his way.
Oh, Merlin.
see what Malfoy's doing in there by going in after him.
Draco nods, refusing to look at Potter in that instant. He knows if he does, it'll all be right there in his eyes for the Chosen One to read and interpret, and then all that change he fears will happen. He'd
Harry's smiling again and to anyone but apparently he and the Ravenclaw, it would be entirely convincing. A second later Luna looks to him right at her side, and the message is clear.
And it's only when Draco sits down to Charms and catches that hot, determined green gaze on him that Draco remembers feeling watched last week, and he suddenly
So Draco smiles to himself as he goes to dinner after dropping his things off on his bed, Zabini at his side as usual. They enter the Great Hall, and Draco at once feels the hot green eyes on him with almost
He's got to fix it somehow, got to do something to spare Draco the backlash of the final match coming lest it destroys his mate's soft emotions hidden from even Malfoy himself.
So there's a House secret he didn't know about, a special
Harry eyes him sideways, curled into himself there on the chair. “A whole bottle?”
Potter startles next to him, jerking slightly at the sudden sound and demand of his voice. Green eyes blink in the evening lights of pink and red, orange and purple, and Potter shrugs, naturally, with a deflective, “Nothing.”
, and then he'd immediately frowned and gotten almost

going on, something jumping back and forth between them that uses glares and smirks to express itself, that pushes them to physically touch one another now in odd little manners like elbow shoving and ankles sliding up calves.
Merlin, what trash.”
so he can see how tight the space really is. He imagines some brave students carved the niche for themselves long ago, and that that is why it's so awkwardly shaped, and it doesn't cross his mind that its outline might be made for another
It's...different.
“How?” he asks his empty dorm room, entirely confused.
Potter catches his frustrated sniff, smiles, and almost shyly glances to him as Harry sits up more in his seat. “Um. Just...something. Got reminded of a...thought I've been dealing with, is all.”
” Draco stares after him, surprised and defensive.
The thing he's been waiting for finally shows itself one night when he cannot sleep yet again and is staring at the Map in bed with his curtains drawn tight.
He wants the physicality, the touch, the taste of Harry Potter.
And Draco gives back, leaving kisses all over Potter's jaw and throat before capturing those lips again, taking everything given even if he
of his bizarre, silent feelings for Potter.
Later that afternoon when Draco enters the dorm, looking a little more relaxed, Blaise rightly assumes his friend's gone to his new scheduled time in the alcove, and he only nods to himself, hoping that maybe Potter will chill out on his trailing after Draco a bit and go back to his glaring.
all bad, just like Harry has considered for quite some time.
Draco takes the hit against his leg and tries one more time to get Potter fleeing away with a higher smack of his heel, very uncertain of just what the fuck is even happening anymore between the two of them.
“So, why haven't you dated this person?” Potter quietly asks him.
But he knows as soon as he nears it this time that he isn't alone.
Malfoy quickly looks to him, finally, stares but a single second, and as he faces forward again, he sends an elbow right into Harry's side and pushes past quicker into the condensing flow of students.
, became
He wakes yet again upon hearing the dorm door open and close, and he knows Draco's come back from using the alcove for the third time that week. The poor sod's been sneaking out at nearly one in the morning to do so, likely hoping to walk to it in peace without looking over his shoulder for Potter's suspicious face.
But it seems a new one, a different one than any before, has begun.
implications, to fate and Potter's will. “
Inevitably, though, it would all be interrupted by something drastic, something affecting the entire school and not just the two for his amused observing, and then his House would often get punished for the unrelated problem. Lots of people blamed his mate for it. Half encouraged his riling at Potter, and the other half were annoyed with him because couldn't he just grow up already and stop costing them House points with their squabbling?
As he eats dinner quietly, Draco thinks. Debates.
Harry can barely swallow without choking as he shifts back enough, feeling Draco's physical accompanying response to that moan slide down his throat safely. He tightens, everything within him tightens, and he bursts, relaxing only when he feels Draco keep hold of him, as if trying to claim every bit of Harry that releases.
“Could always Apparate. There's a muggle pharmacy not far from here. They've got decent medicine for that sort of stuff.”
Potter folds his knees, wrinkling his suit a bit as he hooks his arms around them on the chair. “I want someone, yes.”
He doesn't understand what's going on, but he believes Zabini knows what Malfoy is up to and has been doing all this time. Zabini had been standing exactly near where the spot was, as if he knew its precise location, and likely also its purpose.
He doesn't expect anyone to be standing near the steps up.
He can feel it in his gut.
And when Draco and Potter both stare at him in mild surprise before turning to look at one another across the room in what is at first mutual relief before it becomes glares covering bared egos, Blaise understands.
“No there wasn’t.”
“You’ve been cursed with a Malediction on the back of your right arm. You’re currently numbed, but experiencing severe blood loss as we speak. We don’t have much time before your arm will not recover.”
Harry doesn’t have anything to say to that, and he looks up at Malfoy hesitantly.
Goyle appears with Mrs. Malfoy in a corridor, and Malfoy lifts Crabbe’s wand to point at them.
“Oh my god.” Rebecca says, though she doesn’t leave his mind. Harry scowls at her. Serves her right. He hopes she never forgets what she sees in Draco’s mind. He certainly won’t.
The man Draco’s with moves again, starting to fuck into Draco more. Taking his cue, Draco starts riding him.
Malfoy sits up a little.
“It’s disruptive.”
"Fine. I got some piercings. The muggles said it would take 1-3 months or more for them to heal but I think I can make it much faster."
A moment later, Malfoy takes the dress and the cloak, so Harry turns back.
“Please,
want to be humiliated and
“Dear god, she’ll be the death of me.” He mutters.
But instead…
“Draco!” Harry called, catching Draco as they left the hall.
Oliver rolls his eyes laboriously.
"Uh, it's called efficiency." Blaise shrugs.
“Okay. We’ll go to a muggle shop first to get you some pants, then some shops in Diagon Alley to get you some other clothes. Is that okay?”
“Hey hey hey, why are you crying?” Harry asks as gently as he can, feeling like he wildly fucked up again somehow.
“I did, last night. Hello, table for two please?”
“But… but you didn’t punish me. You have to punish me.” Draco repeats, getting more upset.
“I thought you were going to do something about this.”
“Merlin, they loved them! I think yours were the biggest hit, you’re such a thoughtful gift-giver.” Harry says, and Draco blushes.
He’s already holding Malfoy’s wrists, and he gives them a tug until Malfoy falls into his chest, crying silently.
“I don’t have a clock or a wand to set an alarm, I wake up when I wake up.”
“I don’t typically date. I have a bad habit of sabotaging any romantic entanglements I find myself in the midst of.” Draco says. “And it’s been difficult for me to find people who want to date me with my history. Shagging is easy, long-term is hard.”
“You do
“No you won’t, you need the manpower.”
Harry frowns.
“Being talked about… or treated like he’s… I don’t know, incapable. Or like he’s not listening. He’s always listening, by the way, anytime he’s in earshot. Might not seem like it, but he is.”
“I doubt it, I just don’t know anyone who is. Besides, I figured I could trust you. You’re very good at keeping secrets.”
“Like what?”
“Lights off was for sex.” He says, frowning. “But we are outside, there’s no sex outside.”
Harry whips out his wand and sends a Patronus to Ron.
"How sweet of them."
“I don’t, I’ll go.” Draco says, rather pleased at the way this is turning out for him.
Malfoy’s lips twitch.
He could barely sleep that night. The next day seems to crawl by, Neville asking him a couple times if something’s bothering him.
“Alright, I’ve struck a nerve. It gets the job done, though.” He says, gesturing to their food.
“Have you tried slapping it very hard on the face.” He suggests flatly, and Fred snorts.
“Malfoy’s fine, actually.”
Harry looks at the new eyes. They're still grey, but much larger than before. They're oversized and unbalanced on Malfoy’s face, making him look a bit too innocent and just a tad unhuman. The irises are huge, taking up most of the space and swirling with silver, like a pot of boiling metal.
“No, well, not just because of that. Because you worked so bloody hard to give the perfect gifts to everyone, things we never would’ve even thought of because they
“No.”
“It’s alright, Draco, it’s only a bump. You’re safe here, you’re with me now. It’s okay, you’re okay.” Harry coos, continually petting his arms to soothe him.
The bench on Draco’s side of the bed opens up, but Harry doesn’t usually store anything more than a few old jumpers and other random things that he doesn’t want just lying about in his room.
"How could I forget?"
Holding himself above Malfoy on his elbows, Harry works himself in, the squeeze nearly enough for him to come like that. Malfoy’s hands push Harry’s shirt further off his shoulders onto his arms. Malfoy grips Harry’s biceps.
“Oh, the last healer taught me a numbing stasis spell so I could contain injuries until I was able to be treated. And I dropped a crate on my foot.”
“And then the papers find out I’m here. Write about it. Suddenly you’re here.”
“Yes.” Draco looks up from the pillow. Harry can only see his eyes and nose again, the rest of his body is wrapped up in his soft red blanket.
Draco taps his fingers to Harry’s wrist, his wide eyes watching for Harry’s reaction.
“Well.” Harry says flatly. “She did leave here crying. So.”
“Of course not.” Ron sighs. “Well, I’ll talk to you later then. Ring if there’s any trouble.”
Back to the bookshop
"Saved my life on many occasions."
Oliver appears a moment later, looking peeved.
Ron gestures with his head at the corner where they’d once spotted Dean and Ginny snogging.
Theo, feeling considerably less prone to homicide, talks with Pansy and Blaise as Millie holds Draco, occasionally murmuring softly against his hair.
Alpha walks up, looking between Harry and Draco appraisingly. Draco squeezes Harry’s hand.
thing?"
“Absolute ponce. The question is, how pissed will you be when I inevitably tear that shirt?”
“This isn’t so hard.” He says carefully, not taking his eyes off the ground.
“Yes.”
There’s an anxious pause as Harry wonders what sort of face Malfoy’s pulling.
“It is a draft. I never finished it.”
Backup arrives before he’s able to do so, and he barely manages to hide Malfoy’s wand and cast a notice-me-not on her before they burst through the door.
Meredith finally wakes up silently from the floor off to the side, and Harry subtly holds out a hand to indicate she should stay down. She slumps back quietly.
“You’re the heir to all this, are you not? All the Malfoy wealth?”
Harry stands beside him.
"Oh yes. That's the only part I actually like. If you look into them for too long, you'll become… suggestable. But don't worry, it doesn't work if I blink and I'm not good at keeping them open long enough."
Potter laughs under his breath.
“Thigh holster?” Harry suggests weakly, but Malfoy gives him the same look he’d give if he was wearing his own face. It’s refreshing to see the familiar expression on the new face.
Narcissa puts her hand on Lucius’ arm, smiling tightly.
“I slept late.” Draco says apologetically, following the Prince to the throne. “I prepared as you asked.”
"Cast a Patronus." He orders.
Harry laughs a little.
“I don’t remember him.” Draco says, but starts a new page. It’s pretty much just the name.
“Potter!”
“Oh hello! How’s your cat?” One of the employees who had helped Harry the last time asks him cheerily.
“Greg mentioned you had something you wanted to talk to me about.” Draco prompts as he drapes himself over Blaise’s lap.
Snape and McGonagall cut down more of them, but there’s too many.
“Okay.”
A few minutes later, Draco starts back up again, working Harry’s cock as much as he can from his position, and once Harry’s gripping his arms tightly again, Draco stops suddenly.
Harry snorts.
“They’re not the Grangers?” Draco guesses.
a girl who I’d be comfortable kissing, it should’ve been her. Do you think you might be gay?”
Malfoy hums, leering down at the students preparing for their entrance into Hogwarts.
“We’ve got to stop meeting like this.”
“You can call them Ron and Ginny.”
So when I started writing this I set the date of their bond beginning as Draco’s birthday, Thursday, June 5, but then when I googled the calendar for 2008 (the year the story is set in) and found that, June 5 was on a Thursday that year, so that was completely unintentional but worked out well lol.
“What I’ve said to you since you came to live with me, you seem to remember everything I’ve told you really well.”
Draco is held down while they hit him. Spit on him. Push things inside him. His eyes are shut tight, and even when he’s moved onto something else, a table, maybe, he doesn’t open them. He doesn’t want to see any of it.
“Transfigure myself?”
“Things that Blaise would say aren’t for new boyfriends.” He says very, very quietly.
"I think I could pull this off. The right amount of scary and sexy?"
“Sit down, Harry.” Ron says with a slightly condescending smile. “Do you remember how things went with Cho?”
“What? What does that mean?”
“You didn’t say go!” Harry yelps, shooting after him.
“Hermione.” Harry whispers. She wipes his tears from his face with her jumper cuff.
"What of it?"
“Very well. That’s all, gents.”
A shiver runs down Malfoy’s back, and he squirms again.
Time went on, and despite Hermione and Ron both working for the Ministry, Harry’d heard nothing of his rival. He spent most of his days gardening in Neville’s greenhouse, decidedly
“Yeah, make yourself comfortable. I’ll be right back.” Draco says, leaving the room.
“Heads.” Ashe calls. “I asked him who the most pretentious person present is.”
if Malfoy came up behind Harry in Potions and whispered in his ear about how hard he came last night on his big glass cock… truly
Luna is there already, beaming from where she stands between them, and with a wave of her wand, the plants nearby swish away to reveal wooden benches. Fairy lights twinkle above them. The birdbath is filled with pink carnations floating on the water with small candles.
“By now, you’re all aware of our absurd blunder which has rendered the two of us matrimonially bonded.” Draco begins. Goyle whispers something to Astoria, who smirks. “Which is why you’ve all been invited this afternoon.”
“Thank you?”
George looks impressed, opening the notepad.
Then again-
“Withdrawals?” Harry asks.
“But it takes you
Harry would likely not enjoy seeing me eaten alive by whatever the hell is in there.”
“Okay.” Draco agrees.
Draco pulls Harry into his bedroom, where he takes the new, neat leather notebook from the desk.
Harry slapped his cheek, and Malfoy’s hand came up to touch it, staring at Harry.
By the end of the trip, Malfoy had spent quite a lot of money.
“Holy shit, am I a bad friend?” He asks himself.
“I suppose I survived being target practise in the halls before, I’ll get used to it. I didn’t have you to talk to before, either.” He says. It does feel less awful than if he’d been alone as he was earlier this year.
“I’m Head Boy, I know where all the dorms are.”
“Harry Potter!” He shouted, crushing Harry in a tight hug. Harry wheezed out a laugh.
“Yes. Big nose man. He looked at me like he recognised me. I don’t- He wasn’t supposed to, nobody has recognised me. Blaise. Blaise er… Zabini?”
“I’m aware. I’m quite fond of it.”
“What would you like to do?” Harry asks.
“It’s a start. Hurry up, the body’s getting cold.”
"Okay lamb. Step back so I can come through."
“Oh that’s not true.” Harry laughs. “You flirt everywhere we go to get faster service. Whether it’s intentional or not is a different question.”
They wait, the earpiece their only way of knowing what’s happening.
“Dumbledore is dead.”
Harry braces himself for a long night of such subtlety.
“I’ve got nothing else to do while I wait.” Harry says. Malfoy tilts his head slightly, looking up.
make a good addition to my blood-traitors-only club.”
“Look.” Jack says seriously. “I did what I could. I wish every moment that I could’ve done what you did.”
“Oh.” Harry says. “It’s- It’s a crane, you used to fold those in school sometimes. Do you remember?”
“Draco- Draco! Stop!” He says sharply.
Harry shakes his head.
very least I can do."
“Yeah.” Harry grins. “I do.”
“Yeah, probably. He ended up dead either way, so I suppose it didn’t matter all that much, though I am glad Sirius died innocent.”
“I’m sorry.” He doesn’t look it, though. Harry laughs.
“You don’t think I went through the same thoughts after the war? Putting my friends and my family in danger? For leading the fight to them? You think I’ve never blamed myself for people’s deaths? Because I
Harry and Draco spend Christmas together
“Followup!”
“Are you alright?” Harry asks as they pause in the doorway for Draco to regain his balance.
“Don’t insult my spellwork, I told you I’m a necromancer.” Malfoy mutters, flicking his hair back.
“Harry?”
“You’ve been very unpleasant.” Draco continues. “So we won’t be visiting much. If you don’t make Harry feel welcome and comfortable, we won’t be visiting at all. You know how to reach me. Pansy’s having a party tonight and we’re going to go get sloshed and snog in her closet.”
“No.”
“I like when you call me different things.” Draco says.
“Dear me, do I.” Sirius laughs. “He’s my cousin who torments you, yes?”
“Whatever, Potter. It is what it is, and there’s nothing I can do about it. Let’s just go.”
The next time he’s there, at the shop, he’s a few minutes later than their usual meeting time, so the Twins arrive first.
Frowning in concentration, Malfoy drags the brush across the air, and the thin paint stays where the brush had touched, like he was painting on glass.
“Tell me what to do.” Hermione says.
“Are you completely ignoring the wings?” Malfoy asks, twisting a bit to show off the little leather angel wings attached to the back of the harness he’s got on.
“Hm.” Potter says, mockingly thoughtful. “I really don’t know. I’ll have to consider and get back to you.”
“Flirt.” Draco repeats.
. They named Ginny godmother to Hugo.”
“Is that alright? I mean, we kissed before, so-”
“Potter!” Draco shouts.
“I didn’t hate you!” Draco cries, pacing the room. “Blaise said I fancied you!”
But idk, I might later write one from his POV in current time, see what he really thinks of Harry? Idk, is that something you'all'd find interesting?
“I want to have more nice memories with you.” Harry says gently. “I want you to have
“And you don’t really need to work anyway.” Harry says.
“Yeah, this guy killed Greyback.” Harry mumbles. “You know him?”
Draco doesn’t bother denying it, he’s known for a long time that he’s very fond of Greg in a bit-more-than-friends way.
“I did not like it.” Draco says. “Blaise showed me my room. I don’t want to live there again. It feels… incorrect.”
“They haven’t been this bad in a long time, obviously something’s wrong.” Harry points out, taking his hand again. Draco sighs.
“No, but I read about it once. You can probably find a book about it somewhere if you want to understand it better.”
When the man comes, he pushes Draco out of his lap.
“Malfoy-”
After grabbing his wand and making sure he’s out, Harry turns back to his partner.
Harry’s heart is pounding as he looks into Draco’s scared face, completely at a loss of what to say to him.
“That’s not a very good deal for you. You’d make a rotten Slytherin.”
Dean’s brother, who wasn’t gay but very supportive, had organised the event and invited the whole group of groomsmen. Dean himself was due to arrive at any minute, blindfolded by said brother.
Malfoy huffs, sulking a bit as Narcissa smiles and continues to work.
Draco thinks for a long time. Harry waits patiently. It wasn’t a question, so he may not get an answer, but he also didn’t want to have to punish Draco again.
about that one, he didn’t want
“And what can I do for you?” Draco asks lowly. The man blushes more.
Draco huffs a shocked laugh. He's still on his hands and knees in front of Harry, but with a tug, easily allows himself to be cuddled on the floor.
“I vill fight you for Draco.” He says.
“No. It’s okay. It’s nice when you’re here.” Draco says as he turns on the water. He looks over his shoulder. “Not so hot, for you.”
” Harry asks before he can stop himself.
He starts the water and tugs off his pants, wincing as the fabric drags over his cock.
Draco receives a response almost right away, and Harry wonders if Blaise carries parchment and quills around all the time just in case Draco owls him.
“And I got to see Greg and Astoria, so that was lovely.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron’s laughter from behind him only makes his skin burn hotter.
“Okay.”
Unable to hold off any longer, Harry came over his own fist, muffling his groan with his free hand as he splattered the tiles with cum.
Harry arranges Draco to be curled in his lap, head resting on Harry’s shoulder and still completely covered by the blanket. Draco sighs slightly, leaning into Harry’s warmth.
Mrs. Devoe releases Draco with a thin smile.
Draco’s call summons Peppy into the bathroom directly, and she doesn’t look very surprised about it.
“I’m 100% certain he’d still post stuff like this whether or not he’s being regularly shagged.” Harry says. “In fact, I would be surprised if he
“Sure, why not?”
When he opened the door, everyone’s eyes landed on him, and Draco
“We shagged, Pansy, will you leave off the theatrics for once?”
“Shut
“And he’ll be okay with touching tomorrow?” Harry asks.
“You’ve always been a shit liar, Harry. Did you go back for Malfoy? Are you hiding him here? Actually, don’t answer, I’ll have to arrest both of you.” He grumbles, dropping into a chair.
fuck.”
“I- everything. I like when you spoil me when you’re happy.” Draco says with a frown. “You’re not happy today. You’re spoiling me because you’re upset.”
A few minutes later, Harry pulls away. Marion stands casually leaning against the counter, watching without expression.
Harry decides to ask questions (such as
“I can’t imagine what else you’d be referring to.” Draco shrugs.
The four of them settle around the table, and Blaise pours the tea.
Harry sits up on his elbows when Malfoy’s voice is nearby again, but he’s gone before Harry spots him.
Scarrow has some rather nasty burn scars that Draco can sympathise with, but no one sees all of Draco’s scarring thanks to the neat glamour work Pansy had taught him.
After Harry casts his spell in the Room he finds that, sure enough, Malfoy’s aura isn’t torn, but it’s a bit ragged around the edges.
Potter turns, flexing as he points to a spot mid-back.
“If you’d like to write something that isn’t to remember, you can come in here and use some parchment. Like if there’s someone you want to write a letter to, or if you want to write down something you’re thinking about.”
“No.”
“How’d he get out of prison, anyway?”
“Yeah. We had been friends a long time. You were my favourite of the group, you were always really funny. Everyone liked you, you were very popular outside the Golden Circle.”
“You are not permitted to speak.” He hisses, and if his other hand’s fingers weren’t twitching and shivering in Harry’s hand, he would have believed Draco was not afraid.
“And you’re in Slytherin.”
“Alright, please follow me to the exam room.” Marion instructs, waving her hand and walking off.
“No, you prat, the notes you’ve spello-taped to the mirror that now won’t come unstuck.”
Sure enough, Malfoy appears in the darkest corner, barely visible even after dropping the disillusionment.
“I never claimed my father makes
“I’m sure you’ll be a showstopper. Nipple piercings are almost universally lusted after.
“No. They came out here a couple times right after I started, but after… oh, four months or so, they made excuses to not visit.”
In short… if Harry doesn’t leave immediately, they’ll both be expelled for indecent exposure.
“Which one’s mine?” Draco asks.
“I’ll shower when you’re done.” Harry says. “Would you like me to give you some privacy?” He offers, reaching for the door handle.
“Yes.” Draco says, unbuttoning his shirt.
Ginny hoisted him up, waved her wand at his things, which packed themselves into his bag, and slung it over her shoulder.
“How did you do that?” He asks.
She asks. Robards nods, walking back to his table to drink water. Harry’s skin crawled with how casual he was with Draco’s life.
He leaves, and the warmth from his hand stays.
“Fuck is right, now please tell me
“I would’ve agreed with you before Seventh year. But now, I think he probably would’ve gotten me out in a much smarter way, I’m sure he wouldn’t have left me there. He’s not as evil as we thought he was.” Harry answers. “I don’t get him, but I’m starting to.”
"I suppose. There's an awful lot of Nargles around lately, don't you think? I feel them especially."
“You okay?” Harry asks.
die. Neville was sticking to the coffin what looked like a handcrafted wreath made of the crawling vines she was usually surrounded by.
"Why not?"
“That’s absurd.” Draco says. “You start conversations all the time, you don’t need to ask who I’m shagging or how or when in order to ask one of your ridiculous questions.”
Harry sighs.
Hermione wrinkles her nose, giving Harry an amused look.
“When have I
To their credit, Lucius and Narcissa both maintain very neutral expressions.
Harry learns a new way to fly
“You buy from Neville? Now I’ve heard everything.” Harry laughs. Draco scowls at him.
Draco passes Harry a muffin and very delicately takes the wrapper off his own, trying to not ruin his nails.
“I should’ve put you through my training programme.” Blaise murmurs, hand groping over Draco’s stomach to pull himself closer, chest to Draco’s side.
“It was great!” Potter says, and Draco uses his foot to knock Potter over.
Harry realises suddenly that Malfoy just… doesn’t wear shoes. There’s a self-cleaning rug that Malfoy wipes his feet on, and the Twins do the same as soon as it clears the dirt away. Harry copies them and enters the room.

Marion makes a face.
If he also wanks in there, that’s not for Malfoy to know. Though he probably assumes anyway.
Harry knows denying it won’t convince Draco. After all, Mrs. Malfoy had saved his life too. Of course he’d look after her, make sure she’s alright. Draco didn’t even need to ask. He would’ve even if Draco wasn’t...
Harry shows up to the Manor again Saturday midmorning, though not invited.
Draco snorts.
The man doesn’t show any sign of recognition to Draco, and doesn’t speak much. Draco’s hands gesture faster, and the man shrugs.
Ron and Harry bring Draco to another floor, where they pick a bed and lay Draco down on it.
“Caught the morbs?” Harry asks teasingly as he approaches Draco.
“I asked Ayla to show me how to plait. Her hair was down when you met her, but she usually has it plaited.”
It was raining on the castle again, heavily. Draco had a textbook out in front of him where he lay across the bed, but was too unnerved by the noise to really be learning anything.
“Yeah. Fair.”
He does pause, though, after the wall closes up.

Potter sighs. “It's...a someone, more than a something.”
“We broke up because of him,” Harry admits, taking the silence away.
Draco looks to his friend, the love of his life, in shock. “She knows?”
Because not only has he made his strange admiration and want of Draco Malfoy known to his old rival with their seeking legs and constant hall presences, but he thinks Malfoy is telling him something, too. He thinks that Malfoy wants him to figure it out, wants him to

helping.
When the pair kisses, laughing at the same time, cheers erupt in the crowd. His gaze immediately moves to the face he always keeps aware of in any room he ever enters; he's done it for years now. Green eyes light with the smile that touches upon the thinner lips, but there, just there in the off-shine of the glowing candles against that emerald, is a hint of something.
“Of course he would,” Blaise says for him, more pleasant and mannered than the bastard's ever sounded in his fucking life.
Here he reclines next to the one he'll never have, the one he'll forever pine over, with half a functioning nose, whiskey in his belly, and a fuzzy head as he tries to sort out people in his fucking memory that might throw Potter off of his very private trail. He goes with diversion, tossing out a fast, “You fancied girls in school, didn't you? Are you...?”
He hates Zabini, the fucking shit. Locking him in here with magic in some sort of spelled space, and for what? His own amusement at inducing claustrophobia as Draco cannot even stand upright?
Blaise Zabini lies staring up at the canopy of his bed, now feeling a mild sense of guilt for his part in possibly making Draco's situation worse. Because while he'd always imagined Draco to be attracted to Potter in their rivalry, he's
“I fucking hate that I love you,” Draco whimpers, dead asleep, and finally goes silent.
But now by night he watches the Map, marking the days and times when Malfoy's little feet go adventuring, disappear, and return to bed.

“Well, but of course!” she hoots.
“As if they'll be more than a clump of crap for her,” Crabbe mutters under his breath, and Pansy shakes her head, getting Trelawney's attention off of her before Draco watches Pansy jerk Crabbe by the ear and bark something horrible into it.

Harry shifts, rolls to his left shoulder to stare right at Draco's profile. “Why haven't you told him?”
Oh, he's up to something.

have to do what he must in order to get out of the alcove.
“And what do you do?”
Harry eyes him a little longer before exhaling. “Okay. I'll...say as much as I can.”
Draco extends the bottle wordlessly, and Harry takes it, downing a bigger sip than his past ones.
His excited grey eyes take in Potter's round green stare, notice Potter glance about until the Gryffindor comprehends how tight a space they're in and just silently nods.
To be fair, though, Draco's not sure what Potter

“Draco,” Harry murmurs, licking his lip so hotly again.
Draco collapses into the chair opposite hers, well aware of
“Meaning?” Potter inquires, eyes suddenly quite sharp on him.

Draco seems to try to shake off whatever has got him in its grip, but the stupid, dazed smile is still there as he thinks about it nonetheless.
After following him for almost a fucking month, Harry is growing desperate.
, bringing them together with his cleverness instead.
Draco steps around him, pale eyes standing out against their slight spots of purple around them, and he peers into the dark hole with a sneer. “The bloody hell is that? Are you planning to throw me in there and kill me, finally, or what? Don't think I haven't caught onto your annoyed looks lately.”
They're forever trapped in their roles, and that's simply that.
And Draco conjures up Potter's questioning gaze and submits, groaning and hoping the magicked hole in the wall is as silenced as it is invisible.
“I've been...trying to say this, and bless you, you've been trying to be a good friend during it,” Potter whispers near his lips, gaze so open that Draco finally sees the words before he hears them. “You're my someone.”
He waits in the spot he remembers being the first time he saw Malfoy disappear, the cloak covering him head-to-toe in the dark with only torches for light in the dungeons.
a sort of personal regret. Some type of self-directed longing and frustrated acceptance, and instantly Draco understands the behavior, though not the entire root of its cause. He knows Potter, better than possibly anyone might suspect.
Harry grins against the warm skin and soft pressed shirt. “Okay.”
A few weeks of adjusted routine have let him find release in a mental and physical way he never had much before, and Draco now walks down halls a little less annoyed and a lot more confident, gaining his old stride back.
He definitely doesn't expect it to be Potter.
Trelawney waves her hand over the table as she finishes her preparation, smiling at him. “Now, go ahead. And remember, think well. Concentrate. Imagine a tie of energy from you to someone out in the world, a tie of destiny and love, and wish for a symbol associated with them to appear for you now.”

Just out of spite, he reaches for the cup. He hears the gasp of the room, smirks, and with a steadied breath dips the top to peer inside.
Harry pauses between rows, glancing about to be sure no one nearby is paying any attention to him as he yanks out a random book to pretend to peruse. He exhales quietly and steps closer to the shelves in front of him, green eyes just level enough to peer above his cover and spot his prey sitting alone near a window, parchments and Potions texts out before him.
