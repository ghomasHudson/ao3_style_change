Malfoy leaned back and cursed. Harry watched him sit up but didn't move himself. He felt as though he were made of rubber and could only imagine the mark that had been left on him.
“Not that I need to explain myself to you,” he added quickly, almost defensively when he saw that Harry did not react to the statement about his father.
Maybe it was the topic (the usefulness of a Stinging jinx), but Harry was able to watch him write with a thoughtful, soft look on his face.
“I have instructed Malfoy to be tutored by you.” Snape said this without looking up. He was scribbling profusely, grading papers. Harry noticed a number of failing grades.
“You need more than just passing to get a decent job in the Ministry,” Harry tried to muster, but it came out stammering and weak. “You said that’s what you want to do.”
“So—so, yeah!” Harry said feebly. “Just shut up about all the nonsense, and just talk to me about what is going on. I want answers.”
“So you think we’re a couple,” Malfoy cut him off in an accusatory voice. “Well, that’s where you’re wrong—“
“I’m teaching you Defense Against the Dark Arts, not grammar,” he quipped. “I don’t want to hear it.”
Harry realized with some mild amusement that Malfoy’s arrogance and cockiness would refuse to ever  budge and that alone made Harry want to curse him.
Snape stopped mid-sentence, as if he just noticed that Harry was the only student besides Malfoy leftover from class, and said, in a cold voice, “May we help you, Mr. Potter?”
Malfoy was beginning to bristle now, no longer smirking. “I’ll do as I please, Potter!” he said. “You’re not a prefect and you can’t tell me to do anything.”
“I’ll see how much of you I can handle,” Harry added, trying to match Draco’s heat and feeling a bit idiotic at his weak comebacks. He was shaken by the fact that Malfoy would even approach him for a favor, a favor in public nonetheless.
Somehow, Harry managed to get back into his dorm. He closed the door a bit loudly and Ron sat up in bed. His hair was a wreck and his eyes were only half open.
Malfoy froze and Harry pulled his hand back as if he had been burned badly. Malfoy’s face was pressed together in confusion, his eyebrows drawn together, his mouth in a quizzical frown and his nose scrunched.
Glaring, Malfoy fumbled with his robes. "I said that, didn't I?" He seemed to realize that if he wanted Harry to reciprocate, he would have to not be so rash; for him, this would be difficult and Harry knew it. "So, yes. I like you, alright? Want me to say it aloud again?”
She looked quite proud of herself. "It creates the emotion of love. It’s not real love, but it feels that way in the moment."
“Very mature, Potter,” Snape said sarcastically. “Unfortunately, I may not have been direct as I should have been.”
Ron shuffled in, looking disheveled and exhausted. His hair was spiked up and his eyes looked red and tired.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, came up behind him and grabbed his hair. He pulled on it.  “So very funny and observant of you, Potter. Smart Potter always has his quipps, hmm?”
Malfoy’s cold look suddenly turned plotting. “You know what I mean,” he continued, daring to drag a hand down Harry’s front before resting at his belt buckle. “You want me inside of you again, fucking you raw in an empty common room while everyone is at dinner?”
Malfoy glared at him. "Oh, shut up. Like I said. So fucking full of yourself. Harry Potter, so high and mighty. The stupid Chosen One.”
“You’re afraid,” Harry said matter-of-factly. “Afraid of liking me, afraid of what your father will say—what your friends will say. I don’t care. Don’t come and try to act like nothing is going on, when you clearly have feelings—at least some feelings—for me.”
Harry kissed Malfoy again, which he certainly didn't argue with. His fingers found his hair and pulled him closer, still trying to manage to shuffle forward.
“I’m tired of this,” Malfoy complained, looking up as he paused from his work along Harry’s neck. “I’m bored. Entertain me.”
He found himself waiting outside the Slytherin common room, waiting for a particular cocky Slytherin to emerge. He was unsure of how he came to this point but he, almost possessed,  Harry busied himself by pretending to lean against a window for light to read his Charms textbook.
Harry continued to look at him blankly, but instead of Malfoy taunting him further, he came over and cupped his face. He crouched down. “Would you like to stay with me?”
“I can’t believe you have to spend your entire evening with Draco Malfoy,” Ron moaned when Harry finished his story, flopping back onto his bed again as he tore open another package of Chocolate Frogs. “Hermione’s studying for finals in the library, so I have positively nothing to do tonight.”
Harry proceeded with lessons as usual. He was even feeling better about Malfoy over the next two weeks as the thought of him eventually seemed to Disapparate from his mind entirely. He chose to not mull over the thought of him anyway and, instead, was grateful to have one less thing on his plate.
“I’m trying to check your homework, Malfoy,” Harry said back with equal annoyance, but he could still feel Malfoy’s eyes on him. “You did just ask me, after all.”
Harry felt Malfoy gasp against his neck, running his hands down the front of his chest as he pushed into him again with more rigor.
Harry licked his lips self-consciously. “Well,” he repeated. “Are you going to tell me now? Are you going to tell me why you kissed me? Tell me how much you hate me? Tell me how much you hate kissing me? Why you—”
Malfoy whitened and stepped forward, until he was nose-to-nose with Harry. To his own resentment, Harry felt himself glance down at his lips—briefly, Harry reasoned with himself— then back up at him. “Don’t,” Malfoy spat. “You even dare.”
Ron shook his head. “He’ll notice, knowing him,” he said in a low voice. “He’s got eyes in the back of his head.”
Snape’s mouth twisted into a cruel smile, one that Harry knew admittedly all too well. “Glad that we are, for once, on the same page, Potter,” he said. “If I hear another any other… skirmishes… I shall drop your grade—maybe two if you give me another reason to even breathe a word to you.”
“No,” Harry said quickly. He did not particularly want to get into a fight in the Slytherin dorms where he would undoubtedly be outnumbered and widely disliked. “I’ll be leaving.”
Eventually, after what felt like ages, Malfoy whispered to Harry, in a voice that was less gentle now, “You want to touch yourself?”
Harry shot a glare over at Draco. “Yes, we’re dating, for your information.” It was not true but everyone thought they were. Even Ron knew this. But Harry said it anyway, in part just to spite Malfoy and in hope to get him to walk away.
Malfoy waved a hand lazily. “Project. Figures, I get paired up with this useless one here,” he jabbed a finger in Harry’s direction.
Harry, mindlessly, leaned forward and pushed away the piece of Malfoy’s hair. Harry realized how stupid he looked almost immediately after he had done it. Of all the ridiculous things he had done, this was at the top of the list—and now, to top it off, his cheeks were burning.
“Turn. Around,” Harry said through his teeth. “I’m trying to help. And I’ll speak to you any way I want.”
Instead, Harry stood, until he was almost nose-to-nose with the blonde. “It’s none of your concern who I’m sleeping with,” he said, and then dropped his voice so low only the two of them could hear it. “Isn’t that right, Draco?”
Harry stood up and headed out, holding his breath as he wandered down the hall. It was late but not late enough for Filch to get on him for being out of bed.
Harry winced, knowing at once what this was about. Hermione and Ron also seemed to catch on as they began to collect their belongings, looking a bit embarrassed to have to leave him behind. Harry could not blame them.
Malfoy turned so he was in front of him then. Harry watched as his eyes trailed over him, suddenly feeling awkward and uncomfortable despite having just been ravished by the Slytherin. He had never seen the other look at him with such unmasked curiosity and thought.
Malfoy was being stubborn, and Harry was tired of turning thoughts over in his head throughout the day. He was beginning to have a headache and, besides that, he has never felt such a level of confused anxiety.
Tears rolled down his face. Harry pressed two fingers against Malfoy’s lips and the blonde happily opened them up to allow Harry to enter. The blonde sucked on them happily.
Harry’s face split into a grin. Relief washed through him as he watched Malfoy’s guard slip. "Like what?"
“Zabini?” Harry heard a drawling voice. “What are you doing? Who’s there? Is it Goyle with my food because I’m positively starved—oh.”
Malfoy covered his mouth again, more forcefully this time. It drowned out a lot of his noises but it did not stop his small grunts each time Malfoy re-entered him.
To his surprise, he could easily feel Malfoy’s pulse under his fingers. Harry looked down, feeling rather stupid at the way he was just holding Malfoy’s forearm.
Only a few others glanced in their direction quizzically but seemed to just go back to their potions when Malfoy returned to his chair by force.
Malfoy gave an uncharacteristic whine—Harry almost did not recognize the sound as it came from him—and leaned close. "But I want to kiss you."
She grabbed his sleeve desperately. “Oh, come on. You know us girls. We have to know all the latest.”
“How kind and gracious,” Harry remarked. He also went quiet and continued to watch him write. He then leaned forward, hand on his fist, and said, “You’re also a good kisser.”
Malfoy tensed and he also grabbed his wand. For a moment, they were eye-to-eye with wands extended and pointed at each other.
Ron continued to stare at him, but now it was disbelieving; not sleepy. "Yeah, right. It's Malfoy. Something happened."
“This time,” Harry began, before Malfoy could say anything. “You’ll listen to me. This time, you won’t just goof off, and not pay attention, or–”
The Slytherin’s face was pink with anger. “Or so help me,” Harry continued, feeling hot with frustration and—Harry’s pants were suddenly tight as he watched Malfoy squirm and curse at him with a loathing stare, “I’ll turn you around myself, bend you over, and fuck you right here on this floor.”
At last, the room went quiet. The awkward feeling remained and Harry felt as though he was unsure of what to say.
Harry was very aware of Malfoy’s eyes on him as he left the room. Feeling stupid, he tore out of the Slytherin common room while ignoring the judgemental, suspicious eyes on him as he left.
Harry, who did not wait for him to question him uncomfortably, unleashed a miniature rant (not directed at Ron, he reassured his friend) about Malfoy’s proposal courtesy of Snape.
“What? Oh. You go ahead. I’ll catch up,” Harry said, not looking away. He had not even noticed when Ron gave him a funny look at his hasty disregard for meat-filled bread, said his goodbye, and walked out in the direction of the dining hall.
“Mm,” Malfoy shrugged and drew a finger over Harry’s lower lip. “I’m just looking at you, Potter. Against the rules?
"Thought you didn't want to talk to me, Malfoy," Harry said accusingly, unable to suppress the glow of pride. “What happened to that? Just couldn’t stay away, could ya?”
Harry moved forward so their knees brushed slightly. "If it's so disgusting then I guess it would bother you if I did this," Harry said, finding himself placing his hand on Draco's arm.
“Potter, Potter,” Malfoy drawled abruptly, giving Harry a small start. Harry looked up, annoyed, to see the blonde staring down at him condescendingly with a more-than-noticeable smirk. “So good to see you.”
Malfoy's reaction surprised Harry. Instead of being his usual pale self, a bright pink washed high into his cheeks. He coughed slightly, purposely turning his head and trying to twist his mouth into a scowl.
“I just didn’t hear you come in,” Harry said again quickly, trying to ignore his off-putting nerves. “I was just thinking about…. homework.”
They both grew quiet. Harry shuffled a bit closer to try to get a better view and, as a result, Malfoy tensed immeasurably.
"Potter..." he said, his voice just above a whisper. His eyes had a glazed, distant shine about them. “You are just so nice to look at.”
Harry grinned up at him, feeling slightly better now that he had been able to talk about the situation. “So I suppose... studying for finals is not on the table?”
“Damn you,” Malfoy mumbled. He ran a hand through his hair, disrupting the gel that had it in place. “Stupid Potter.”
Malfoy exhaled heavily. “You don’t mind yourself with that, Potter,” he sniffed, and put his nose to the air. “Run off your little troll of a girlfriend.”
Malfoy threw his hands up impatiently. "I don't know, Potter! That's just it," He said, and looked down. “I hate you, I want to fuck you all day every day, and I like you. I don’t understand it.”
Harry just grinned. Malfoy looked a bit younger now, hopeful, with a small trace of a smile in his expression. Malfoy’s eyes were wide, curious, and his face was looking less pointy.
Harry almost felt as though all of his movements were sluggish. It seemed as though he were watching from the outside as he slid closer to Malfoy, leaning over him in the armchair.
Harry stared, enjoying the way Malfoy was looking after their, er, activites; he looked messy, tear-stained, and soft-haired. The lines around his face vanished and his grey eyes seemed brighter.
He had his neck craned and his arms crossed irritably again. The room was only vaguely lit by candlelight. They made his features look more prominent, his scowl set deep and his eyes slits,
Malfoy went from angry to suddenly looking understanding, looking over his shoulder. “You’re right, I don’t think this is the place for something like this.”
“You forgive me?” Harry said, now not even genuinely wanting forgiveness but instead wanting to put Malfoy on the spot. He was also bothered by Malfoy’s response, which seemed as dismissive and nonchalant as ever.
Malfoy almost looked amused, eyeing Harry as though he were a challenge. Harry did not like the look in his eyes.
Ron relaxed, leaning back into the chair. "I got you, mate. No worries," He said, and offered an encouraging smile.
Harry babbled on, speaking hurriedly as if the faster he spoke, the faster this would be cleared up. After he finished, he swallowed thickly as realized how dry his mouth had become.
Harry looked at his desk. He awkwardly pulled at his collar again while Ron continued to poke at him to get his attention.
It was mostly empty except for a few first-years and Hermione, who was sitting at a table with a book.
Harry watched as the Slytherin merely slouched further into his chair, eyeing everyone enviously as he trailed out of the classroom. He then faced forward, a scowl on his mouth, to glare at Snape coldly—he looked betrayed by the fact that the Potions teacher had broken their unspoken truce.
Before Malfoy could walk away, Harry drew his eyebrows together tightly. Suddenly, he felt very confused.  “Malfoy,” he said, not coldly in that moment but instead curiously. “You said—Snape suggested this to you?”
“Move, Potter,” Malfoy said coldly again, but his voice sounded a bit creaky as though he were recovering but a particularly bad cold. “Your—shadow, hard to see my paper.”
Harry held his cold stare, hoping he looked more resolute than he felt. He put his hands in his pockets to ensure Malfoy could not see them shaking from the confrontation.
,” Malfoy said in annoyance. “I need a tutor. Because I’m failing it, and I’d rather my father didn’t find a failing grade on my report card,” the blonde remarked, as if everything he was saying was entirely obvious without any sort of explanation. “I’ll pay you of course.”
Harry had known that his friends would not let the Malfoy matters go. Hell, he wished he himself could let the Draco matters go.
Harry returned it half-heartedly. "I'm going to get a snack before lights-out," He fabricated. Malfoy and he were not meeting at their normal time and, frankly, he did not want Ron nagging him further on the topic of Malfoy. "Want anything from the dining hall?"
“I’ll make sure to remember that,” Harry said in amusement, grabbing his Defense Against the Dark Arts notebook and textbooks. “Honestly, Ron, I think Snape enjoys torturing me. After all, it was his idea for me to tutor Malfoy.”
Harry paused. Malfoy—did he like Harry? That had to be the only explanation for all this strange behavior. But, there was just no way, Harry convinced himself.
Malfoy just flicked his wand. “M’not the settling down type,” he said. “They all would rather just get in bed. I’ve got a hundred girls just dying to take my last name, though.”
“Testy, Potter,” Malfoy drawled slowly. “I’m paying you, don’t forget. I’ll waste as much of your time as I damn well please.”
He then turned and said, “You said you didn’t want to talk, and I’m fine with that. I already apologized anyway, so I’m okay.”
“I should have known, though,” Malfoy went on. “I figured that you would not dare marry into a blood-traitor family like them.”
Harry, not turning his back on the other as though afraid he would jump him, collected his belongings and rushed out of the Slytherin common room as though Peeves the Poltergeist were chasing him down the corridors.
Malfoy was still eyeing him curiously. “Well lucky you,” he said at last, throwing down his books. “I’d like to make this a quick one tonight, quite honestly. I’ve had such a day and I’m over it.”
“I just can’t do it,” Malfoy continued to complain. “This is absurd. I’m tired of this and I’m tired of being around you.”
“Was I unclear?” Snape cut him off in a voice so callous that Harry did not dare argue but instead gave Malfoy a dirty look.
“Make a move, make a move,” Harry began to pace again, before asking aloud, “How the hell am I supposed to do that?”
“Because, what started out as you picking up some extra change has turned into an addiction for my cock,” Malfoy said, each word enunciated with a press of his lips to Harry’s neck. “But, if that’s what you want… So be it.”
Harry almost went for his wand on instinct but decided to push through on this. He was tired of being pitifully confused and disoriented.
“Because you and I are not,” Malfoy continued, not seeming to notice that Harry had not objected to this. “So, I can see whoever I like.”
Harry realized that he had stopped talking. He had his book open but suddenly the words on the pages looked rather jumbled together. He blinked.
He told himself that he did not like Malfoy. He couldn’t; but hell, Harry would be lying if he said that he couldn’t stop thinking about their urgent, needy kisses. The way Malfoy touched him just above his—
Castle was still. Almost too still. The only thing audible at the moment was his own cold, bare feet dancing on the floor, and the obnoxiously loud heartbeat that seemed to vibrate the walls.
"Shut up, will you?" She looked him straight in the eye, and whispered harshly. "What happened to staying under control? Shouting in the middle of a packed arena is a dead giveaway. He'll be fine."
"Why are you looking through my memories," Draco said. "Those are private. And shared between your Dad and I."
"I know we're young," Draco started, trying to make sense of why Harry was looking at him the way he was, but Harry cut him off before he could even think of a valid excuse.
This wasn't the Plan to Seduce Potter. This wasn't a silly little game with an end result of humiliation. This would be murder.
Harry took a swig of pumpkin juice, trying to suppress his burning anger as he looked at the door, then to Pansy and Blaise, who wore guilty faces. "Thrill of competition."
The ache replaced the anger. The yearn to share the small things, like hearing how Harry's day was and telling the mundaneness of his own; bringing each other interesting foods to try; seeing his smile; knowing that Draco put it on his face—all of it crumbled the wall Draco put up bit by bit.
"I expect no less of him. Don't underestimate him too much, though. He'll do whatever it takes, even the things you couldn't think of."
Harry stared back at him, but couldn't really see him due to the water leaking from his eyes, before sitting down on the blanket, and Draco did the same, still staring at him, begging for an answer. "I was once told before that the happiest man in the world would look into the Mirror of Erised and only see himself. I was never by myself, even when we were dating. You were next to me. But that's what I think I will only see: us two because what's me without you?"
Draco realized the flaw in the logic. "No, you wouldn't be doing it out of aid to evil, you'd be doing it for a good cause."
A brick fell through Draco's stomach and his eyes welled. A woman in the back of the room stood and walked down to the stand. The memories of her flashed in his head, her on the ground, her face bent in fear.
Harry looked away but Draco pulled up his chin to ensure that they were looking each other in the eye. Then Draco started to slowly fill the footlong gap. He closed his eyes and just stood there waiting with his lips parted.
"It doesn't matter if I do or don't. Not with this war. Besides, I'm sure two death eater families binding together would please the Dark Lord, and isn't that our job as Malfoy's, the great family name. We're nothing more than clowns for him."
All the friends just stared as if they were watching him sacrifice himself. The only person who had an excited look on their face besides Ron, was Harry. The others instead had fear on their features. This was Draco Malfoy you're talking about. And of course, they were all excited to see it happen, but the aftermath was a different story.
“You are so demanding,” Draco shouted with a smile on his face as Harry stopped spinning them, but still his arms were draped around his hips. They were so close, Harry’s chest was up against Draco’s back and he could feel the curve of it, and the blonde could feel his lover’s speedy heartbeat. He pulled him closer, his chin stabbing into Draco’s neck as he snuggled up to him. “How do you want me to kiss you?”
Harry wanted to roll his eyes, but everyone around him seemed mostly excited, except for Ron and Hermione. Harry couldn't take those words to heart; all he could think about was Draco and what he said on the train.
"Draco," Harry almost mouthed he spoke so softly. "Draco," he repeated a bit louder. He took his other hand and cupped his cheek, stroking the peach fuzz on his face with his thumb. He didn't want to move his muscles. "Draco."
"We don't need to talk about this now. We can pretend it never happened until morning. How about that?" Draco stroked behind his ear, calming him down.
"No wonder you're failing half your classes. Your in-erudite recuperations skills are that of an ignoramus."
And could see it in his face at dinner, and during classes, and all the time in between. But he could see no one was helping him, and he'd kill just for a moment to talk to Harry and make everything okay. Or to at least wish him luck and reassure him he'd be fine.
"The way that I've designed your Common Room is to both allow for privacy but also help from a friend should you need it. You have been put together with your closest friends, however, in between each bed is a curtain which allows for privacy when needed. Your initials are on your doors. It would be so kind to speak with you all individually before you go to bed, so please remain in your dorm rooms."
Draco cocked his head to the side and smirked, turning to him. "How is it you always manage to start off the year with pissing me off one way or another?"
"That's because I'm in a nightmare and in about an hour I'm going to wake up back in the forest with you and Harry and he'll tell me about who he actually dated."
"Like I said, it's not that simple to just spit it out. It's got to be careful and modest and precise."
Harry laughed. "I think I did okay," he said as Draco took a trip to the bathroom. Harry hadn't realized he brought a bag with him.
Draco realized that he was fighting with him well beyond the scope of Plan DBR because in the absence of fighting, he had to face the fact that he felt sorry for Harry.
Draco waited to tell Harry about detention until he came back from his first week of treatment. He didn't want Harry panicking and leaving early.
"I say we should kill the ferret first," Ron bit, "it's his fault! And besides I made a promise that I'd kill him if he hurt Harry."
"He's going to kill you. He's going to kill me." Draco leant back against the stone wall, heaving, with tears pouring down his cheeks. His chest was so tight, it was like his organs were being held behind prison bars.
“I-I…I don’t think so...” He didn’t break Harry’s gaze, and his stomach set on fire. “What happened with his face?”
Then, Draco rolled back out of the embrace so he could pull his sleeve up, which he was also so shocked he could do. There was once a time Draco went to the greatest lengths he could to ensure Harry didn't see this, and here now, he was voluntarily showing it to him, not expecting, but still preparing for, him to walk away.
"Please explain to me you two go from using... interment romantic practices to physical abuse in a matter of one day. " Draco was in Snapes office, all healed, while Harry was in the Gryffindor commons room.
Then, Draco took him down to the lake, so close they could feel the spray and their force caused a trail of water to follow behind them. Harry laughed in Draco's ear, and it still amazed Draco to this day how it was his most favorite sound in the entire world.
When he released the button he saw the sparkle of Draco's necklace, and he hooked his index finger around it. It was warm. Draco had been wearing it long. Draco eyed him as he did so, a shy hint of a smile on his lips.
Harry grabbed Draco's arm and after they turned the corner, Draco sneered and pushed him off. " You didn't need to help me."
"Thank you for having me. It was sweet, how you pulled all those strings." Draco gave him one last peck, then opened Harry's door and walked out of it. "I'll see you in a few days."
"At least your cucumber shit has character. One day you'll switch to my Brazilian brand and you'll never go back."
"And I didn't want our relationship to get lazy. If you knew and I knew then we wouldn't have, I dunno, fought as hard. We would have not... the fact of us being soulmates would have a lot of weight and we'd start being with each other because 'he's my soulmate' not because 'he loves me.'"
Harry started laughing and he grabbed Draco by his waist and picked him up, his feet barely hanging off the ground slightly. "Harry, Harry, Harry! What are you doing," Draco flung his arms around him in scarce to keep his balance.
"I'm not tired at all, actually. In fact, I'd love to play quidditch with you." And then Harry frowned. "But I can't. Umbridge took my broom."
"You don't see any of our other professor's sneaking their spouses onto campus and finding the nearest broomstick cupboard."
Madam Pomfrey rushed behind him. "Potter, a calming draught," she said, handing Draco a vial. Harry didn't move. "We can try, but no potion in the world is going to override grief like this."
"Right, let's get hypothermia together before you go," Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry moved to Draco's shoes and untied them for him.
"Look at me." Draco did. "I wouldn't be with you if I didn't want to. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. You don't have to say it back." Draco took a tight breath, but Harry still leant his head against his shoulder. He pressed a gentle kiss to Draco's neck and then hid in the crook, trying his best to keep warm. "Really. Don't say it back."
"You are pretty handsome if I do say so myself," Pansy said and Draco smirked. "It would be easy to convince him, he's gullible. Drop the snob act for a month, suck it up, and while distracting him, humilate him in the process!"
“Yes,” she bit. “Is there any other?” Draco went up to the door, but Pansy blocked him. “There’s no way in hell I’m letting you see each other.”
Draco shook his head the smallest amount that was visible to him, before checking around to make sure no one else was looking. As a diversion, Narcissa wound her arm to cast a spell, most likely a decoy to distract the others, but then Dobby snapped and took it.
"Hug him goodbye? Hug him goodbye! Am I a Hufflepuff, Pansy! Have you no sense of Gryffindor-Slytherin Rivalry?"
"Harry, no one wakes up and chooses to have an eating disorder like it's picking the color trousers you're going to wear for the day. The Dursley's misguided you—"
Draco lunged forward, crawling over him and pushing him back. As he got up, so did Harry, and he chased him up to the latter, and they tousled and wrestled to get on it, pushing each other to the side, but Harry got the upper hand and started climbing. Due to his larger size, Draco could step around him and he pushed Harry off, knocking him back into the bouncy mess, and Draco made it to the top.
Harry pushed past him and went back to the elevator, taking one before Mr. Weasley could catch up. He chose the top button, Minister's Office. The ride couldn't have gone fast enough. He nearly broke the door when the elevator slowed to a stop. The walls were fancy, and the floor was carpeted, in contrast to the damp and darkness of the cells.
Class came to a close and everyone started packing up their things. He and Potter hadn't said one word to each other.
Harry didn't. He stayed there until Ron and Hermione woke him up hours later. He sat on the edge of Draco's bed, holding his hand, so that Draco could feel him and no one could see him. So Draco knew, in this mess, in this war, he wasn't alone.
"But then I came back to life- do you know how exhausting that is?" Draco shook his head with his eyes wide at Harry's outburst. "Didn't think so. And then I killed a vicious almost-dictator after months of sickening trauma, which, who knows how the hell I'm not at the verge at a mental breakdown right now-"
"Draco... Draco, we aren't alone...What if your mother- oh Draco!" The blonde made his way further and further down and dragged his tongue all the way down and up again.
Draco brought another basket for dinner, this time, steak and kidney pie. It was more toned down, which Potter seemed to notice.
"Really?" There was a certain light in Harry's eyes. He looked so hopeful and almost childlike. "Right now?"
"We are going to learn how to make out if it kills me, Potter," Draco shoved a laughing Harry on his back before crossing his arms. "Surely you can beat a Dark Lord and somehow kill a damned basilisk, but the second someone starts to shove their tongue down your throat, you go into a giggle fit."
"Today," she said, and only said, and then repeated it in lower and higher octives, various tones and voices. "Today!"
"I'm not! You're the one obsessed with me, Malfoy!" Harry grabbed a pie and hit him straight on the chest, and then Draco took one, however before he had a chance to splatter him, Harry grabbed Draco and wrestled him to the ground, pinning him.
He tried to change the deep groans coming from Potter's throat into squeals of pleasure from Astoria, but he seemed more turned on when he heard Potter's deep rumbles. Draco also tried to imagine breasts in place of Potter's chest and yet they did nothing for his ingenuity. Nothing of Astoria's did.
“It could be that the two are under a scandalous relationship as well, though. Stolen secret moments involve kisses and touches when thought to be alone. It has been known that the two have hated each other since their first days at Hogwarts, but the two could have over come that hate, however Pumblechook disagrees.
"I want to be there for you when you're having a hard time, not stress you out more. I reckon worrying about me is causing you more heartache than the actual marriage and I don't want to do that to you. I have support. You don't need to fear hurting me on top of being devastated yourself. You don't want to be in an arranged marriage. You don't want to marry anyone at all."
He grabbed her chin and placed his lips onto hers, but he immediately felt like gagging. All he needed to do was wait for Harry to notice…
"But," Harry started again, his face full of horror. He couldn't handle any chances of being let down, not now.
Then, Potter tried stepping in front of him. "No no no. My broom, my rules, get in back, Wonder Boy. If you wanted to drive, you should have brought yours."
No, Harry. Don’t. Don’t honor me. Disrespect me. Beg for me to take you back. “You deserve so much better than me. I hope you find some one who treats you right, and I’m sorry this has to end like this. It’s about time, huh? Almost two years.”
Harry had sweat drenched all over him and he was shaking extensively. His covers were god knows where, and his pillow knocked over the articles on his nightstand, replacing them on the cherry-wooded table.
Which was dumb, because Draco had seen his body in the shower a week ago. But demons didn't leave so simply.
Harry swallowed hard, and his hand shook as he placed it to Draco's cheek. His eyebrows furrowed and he found himself searching Draco's eyes too thoroughly. "Where did we have our first kiss?"
"It's easy for you to say. You've never been starved. You've never been denied food for most of your life as if it wasn't a natural right, as if it was a luxury for people who were good enough and there was always something wrong with me."
Kingsley looked a though he'd been hit in the face with a beaters bat. No one could deny that was a damn good opening and it blew the other out of the water. The arrogant arse prosecutor wore an ugly smirk and Harry felt disgusted with him. Just his mannerisms drove him extreme.
"I don't even know where to start. I don't know whether I want to punch you or hug you. This is the first time we've seen each other properly in five weeks. Not four.
The death eaters walked closer, and visible was their leader: Lord Voldemort. There was a giant walking next to him with a bundle in his arms.
"Hi there," Draco said, hugging her back, and Blaise approached, too. "Nice to see you." Draco smiled, and they knew it was him. "It's good to see you. It's good to be back."
"I'm not going to! Why can't you just deal with the pain like I am?" Harry ran over to Draco and pushed him up against the cabinet in a ball of fury.
"Are we supposed to hang out now?" Astoria stood in her uniform already, her hair up in a tight bun.
Harry knew he could taste victory soon; but when Minister Shacklebolt asked any further analysis, the man called Draco back to the stand.
And therefore more easily broken into. Harry took a deep breath. "Draco's smart. He'll work with the lawyer. What's the name?"
"I knew you wouldn't of. But yeah, we should be friends...sort of... well I mean I have been particularly nasty to you lately... We'll have to ease into it."
They were extremely close, dangerously in Draco's point of view, and the way that Harry looked into her eyes drove the Slytherin mad. He had his hand on her waist which also seemed alarmingly low, even if it was her midback in which his hand was. It should have been him in those arms, not that stupid girl.
"It's better than my cucumber shit, apparently," Harry gave a hint of a smile. He tried distracting himself from feeling so embarrassed and weak and ugly.
"Because I'm thinking about what it feels like for you, and how my touch affects you. All I think about is how lucky I am to have you."
"Kreature, we're so sorry," Harry rushed his face red. "We're so sorry, you can leave. You weren't meant to be here. Oh my God, we're so sorry. Please leave."
"Is having sex with your soul mate for the last time not good enough for you? Is knowing that no matter what, we'll never be together not good enough for you? Is the fact he's engaged not good enough for you?"
Draco met Potter out by the lake as promised, wearing a pair of trousers and a black button up. He gelled his hair back a certain way that was 'proper yet playful,' and even Blaise winked at him as he left the Common Room.
The next time Harry tried to leave, Draco wasn't there. Harry peaked behind the door and surveyed what he could see. He crept out of the room with his fingers wrapped firmly around the handle of his wand. Step by step, his cautiously walked down the empty corridor with the hair on the back of his neck standing tall. He didn't feel like he was physically walking as he did so. His body felt numb, except the constant pull of hatred and deception at his stomach.
"I just... I've never been kissed like that before." Draco bit his lip whilst he drowned in insecurities. Harry eyed him with a blank expression before he lay down next to him, so close their bodies were aligned and Harry leant his head in the crook of Draco's neck.
“You got that bitch PREGNANT!” At first Draco cowered but then his frown turned to a smirk, and then almost a laugh. Harry just looked at him as if he was a piece of meat, his eyes wide and piercing.
"Have you ever thought about the first time two people tried to make out," Harry asked, a smile on his face as his laughs went away, but they came back the second Draco started laughing. "It was probably better than this!"
They didn't speak as they made their way back to their common room, not disconnecting their limbs once. Once there, Harry laid down on it and then Draco laid on him, burying his head in his neck. He wasn't crying, but Harry expected him to. Draco was having flashbacks from his childhood, he was sure of it.
"That also isn't my point," Draco bit his lip. Harry didn't say anything, but sat up a bit and turned his face so his eyes could lock with his. "Every date we've been on in the past month and a half, you've fallen asleep one form or another."
"What was that for?" He broke out into something that wasn't a smirk, something so foreign to him, while Harry laughed. The laugh coming from Harry's throat was like Angels singing to Draco's ears. There wasn't anything in the world that would make that note more beautiful.
Draco nodded. "Yes. One day. But right now, let's just see where it goes. No pressure, no rush. Just touching. Just introducing that concept."
Again, they chatted about the war like it was a story, and found exploding snaps to play, which they did most of the day, eating strawberries and pasta later on.
"Treatment," Harry remarked, though he and Draco both knew that spending a few hours each night in the Room of Requirement probably shouldn't take precedence over their exams.
Not a lot, but spare moments after classes or during lunch to brew more. It gave them an excuse to be with each other, even if Harry had to lie to his friends more than usual about it.
Harry reached out and held his hand, thankfully his right one. "You haven't been monster food yet. So far so good."
It was all too overwhelming. These were walls that housed him as he grew up. He both earned his life there and lost it. Every essence of who he was stemmed from his love of Hogwarts. Part of him felt that it was home, but another part of him felt he'd outgrown it, that he didn't fit there. At least not now.
They stayed there for a while, letting their tastes combine as their tongues met as if they were starving for each other, moaning in arousal. They pulled apart gasping for air, sweat barely forming on their brow.
But Draco looked down. In the parental spot, Narcissa had signed, along with Lucius and both of the Greengrass parents. Draco was about to tell her to fuck off, but then she noticed the slightly red hue to her cheek.
"So did your father, and your aunt. And I almost killed you and now we are happily married and have two kids."
The Manor was dark, eerie, but something else had been added: sheer loneliness. There was no warmth, there wasn't a fuzzy feeling that he became so fond of over this past year. There was not happiness. This was not home to him anymore. His home was a green eyed, black haired, round glassed Gryffindork.
And something about the thought of safety made Harry run through the halls until he found some towels in a closet a floor above them, and by time he returned, he'd thought Draco would have been in the shower, standing behind the privacy of a curtain, but instead he stood naked and vulnerable, out in the open with the shower running and his clothes on the counter.
"Close your eyes." The female of the two said, and Draco heard footsteps walking in the opposite direction. He took this opportunity to look at the second of the pair. He maneuvered himself to a different pile of junk to get a better view, and there stood Harry. His Harry. Just standing there with his eyes closed.
"Oi, it's okay. I was provoking you." Obviously, Draco didn't understand the weight of the situation. Harry immediately hugged him, more scared of himself than anything else.
Draco stayed almost petrified. He was too afraid to move, too afraid to see it himself. He was lucky he got to wear long sleeves all day and night, and he'd come up with a way to avoid it in the shower and in the mirror. "Harry," Draco whispered with a quivering lip.
"She told me the night before he went off to war, they talked about the sky and the stars, and how if they ever missed each other, they would look up at the stars because in theory, they would be looking at each other." Potter swallowed. "After two years, he fell and broke his rib and it pierced his heart. The last thing he did was write to her. He told her to look up at the sky because he would paint it every morning and night for her, just so she knew he was alright."
It was a week later when Harry was studying with his friends on the old seating arrangement. On Monday, which is two days later, they would be leaving for Holiday vacation.
"Shut up, you cocky bastard." Harry caressed his chin and played with the sensitive skin on his neck. "Don't make me give you another hickey." He put his thumb over the fading one. "This one looks like it's going away."
"Okay," Draco breathed, but he mouthed it, those three words, hugging him tighter. Ron and Hermione saw it.
"You know exactly what I mean." Still Draco's eyes narrowed. "Go talk to him. He probably has a good reason. Potter makes one mistake and suddenly you turn into a drama queen."
The best part of it all was the reactions that escaped Potter's body. In potions he could feel Draco's gaze on him like a the darkest cloud in a hurricane. The Boy-Who-Lived would blush, shake, and get sweaty as the beady grey eyes would pierce into what felt like his soul.
They waited about an hour before the jury came back. It was well past eight o'clock at night. Harry checked his pocket watch. 1372.
"Fine by me." Harry released his arms and let his body free-fall on top of Draco nuzzling his face in his neck, receiving a grunt from the other boy. That's gotta hurt. Harry began to bit his neck and lick it over with his hot mouth.
"Harr—" Draco breathed, biting his lip and enjoying the feeling of it. "Fuck, I'm casting the stamina spell."
"How were you selfish?" Draco had to swallow down his anger just to keep himself under control. "By sacrificing yourself? You walked to your death--"
"Awh well if it isn't little lover boy coming for his little death eater boyfriend," she taunted as the smell of stale smoke filled the air. Confusion twisted Harry's face.
Everything hurt. Every bone and muscle ached with the same burn of losing Harry. His toes hurt as much as his chest did. His arms hurt as much as his toes did. His fingers hurt as much as his head did. Everything.
to like you. It's miserable. I wish with every fiber of my being that it wasn't you. But it is. And I expect nothing from you. I just want you to know that I'm sorry and I really mean that. And I don't want you to get hurt. I'm sorry for what I had to do to realize that."
Hogwarts was the next topic, how the barrier kept the Death Eaters out, thankfully in Draco's opinion and unthankfully in everyone else's, with no falter. That was when Draco readied himself, because the question he was anticipating came next, but he'd never had to do it next to his father.
"Harry Potter, you have completely destroyed me. You have completely obliterated my wake and ripped me to shreds. You have torn me to pieces and abolished my thinking. You have broken my heart with four eradicating words and made it whole again with three simple ones.
Meanwhile, Harry was sprinting through the halls in hopes of finding Draco's room. The place they booked really was elegant, however Harry had no idea how the hell to find him and couldn't even pay attention to the detail and classiness. He caught sight of a random worker.
Her words didn't console him. He swallowed and shook as he did. Everyone around him was chatting, laughing and waiting all together for the champion of the tournament. It was sick.
"So what, you've never been in love. I get it. I haven't either. It's not that difficult. You're in love or you're not."
"Yeah, I mean I've planned this for a while," Harry said low, pulling out the correct number of galleons.
Harry on the other hand had on classic pair of black robes with a classic white dress shirt and inky black bottoms. His hair was combed back with the left-over gel from Hermione sticking it in place. His glasses were cleaned to shine and his teeth were whitened by a simple charm. He looked great!
The wind muffled all the cheers from the crowd as Harry got closer and Draco caught up to be side by side, meters above the ground. Draco and Harry pushed one another in hope to stall their chance at catching the snitch.
Then, he slowly untangled himself and went to the bathroom, cleaning off his Dark Mark of any extra residue and wrapping it in three bandages, because apparently two wasn't enough.
But as soon as Draco started looking through the piles, digging through junk, a voice so warm and smooth and lovely made Draco melt.
"Harry. I don't care what you look like. I already know and I'm already not judging you for it. But whatever makes you the most comfortable."
"No," Draco beckoned abruptly. He obviously was a shaking dog, rather a rattle snake. There was a pause as Harry moved his hand down Draco's wrist and locked their hands.
Harry blinked. "I know you think I'm a Golden Boy, and I am good, or at least I try to be good for the sake of being good, but... yeah. I am capable of feeling hate. I just don't like feeling it. Because then I'm bitter and I'm angry and I can't sleep at night. I lose the most when I hate someone. How can I enjoy moments with you and my friends if I'm spending it hating someone all day? How could I like being at Hogwarts if I just obsess over this maniac? He's stolen everything from me. Even my own thoughts. While I have them to myself for now, I'd like to try to live my life. I should hope if I win, the greatest revenge is living a happy life without a single one of my thoughts being of him." He licked his lips. "I just want love. I just want to feel love and I can't do that when I think about him."
"No, she saw us holding hands and we went to the room of requirement when you were really upset one day. We were really going at it, even took our shirts off-"
Harry frowned. "If you went—you're not—but if you went to Azkaban... How long of a sentence do you think you'd have?"
Oh yeah, Potter lived with filthy Muggles. "Oh no," Draco said, actually being truthful, "It's nothing like that here. The only reason I don't want my father knowing is because he's strict with me carrying on the Malfoy name, passing on the genes and whatnot. Wealth and bloodlines. We have cousins who are gay and that's not a problem. I have more pressure on me though to keep up the line since I'm an only child. I don't know what to tell him yet. I'd really prefer this stay secret if you don't mind."
"Oh she's worse that awful! She's pure evil! I don't even think I have to worry about going home this summer; stupid Umbridge'll already prepare me for Voldemort! Ugh! I swear I'm going to kill her!" He kicked his wardrobe, causing the wood to dent, although it's not like he cared. Suddenly it got quiet. "What," he bit.
Harry reread the sarcasm over and over. He knew Draco wasn't a romantic, and he himself wasn't either. He loved their relationship at this stage.
Harry then explained the Department of Mysteries, losing Sirius, and then he passed it off to Draco. By then, the kids had tears in their eyes. They knew of Sirius. Of Lupin. Of Snape. They knew they were dead. But they never knew the traumatic details.
"Dear Scarface," she read in a pompous tone as Harry snatched it back, "is that what you call each other? You don't have real nicknames like baby or babe?"
"I wasn't planning to sleep until I saw you, but to we fair we went really hard. Tried napping, but I had an awful nightmare."
When they entered the Room, it was the same as it always had been, ceiling high windows that showed off the night sky, couches, and a large four-poster bed, except the light on the fireplace was much dimmer than usual. They set their brooms against the wall and then looked at each other.
Quickly, Draco gripped a small teaspoon full of flour and threw it back at Harry. They then started grabbing more and more and before Harry ran behind a table and took cover, he grabbed a fist full of white powder.
Harry smirked, however then broke into a smile, "Get out of here, Malfoy." Draco wanted to hate it, but even the use of last name made butterflies dance in his stomach.
Harry met Draco at the stone circle, taking his arm just as Draco first did. He was wearing a suit without the jacket and Draco wore a silk button up.
It was true. Draco's sweater vest didn't fit him as well, even after having it tailored. "Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Eating fine."
They were even so confident that Draco let go of his shirt and hair and wrapped his arms around Harry's back so their chests could press together. And Harry threw his arms around Draco's shoulders so he wouldn't fall.
Draco bit his lip and he choked, pressing his forehead against Harry's, sighing at the thought that their pain was over. He didn't have to hate himself anymore. Harry was safe. Draco was safe. They were going to be okay.
"Shhh, Harry relax, if you don't want to go you don't want to go, it's okay, we won't go. You know they're nightmares, or are they flashbacks?"
Harry spun behind him and sought for Draco, who was on top of a pile of failing furniture. He was eagerly searching the sea of flame, his voice hoarse and dying.
Harry went over to him and began unbuttoning it. He kissed off some of the frosting on his face. "Darn."
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed the pastry in his hand. "Always happens." he took his final bite, his voice dropping lower. "Don't they know I only have a few minutes a week to hang out with my secret boyfriend?"
Draco dipped his head as Harry headed towards the castle, but Draco stopped him by grabbing his arm. 'Hug him!' Pansy shouted in his brain. He spun Harry around and wrapped his arms around him only so that their chests were touching. Harry didn't react at first but then slabbed his arm around Draco as well. It felt.... weird.
“It’s not as extravagant as our last first date, but it works. You really outdid yourself there, I have to say.”
"He's alive. But he sustained several injuries and the Dark Lord possessed him, as we guessed he would."
"Then who does she think she is?" Again, Draco grabbed his wand. "She can't kiss you! She didn't work hard enough for it! Bloody hell, I had to fake my way into your heart then get a bloody nose before you even kissed me, and she walked right on up to you and just did it!"
"So why would he be- oh Arthur, it couldn't be-" All he did was shake his head in response. "Let's get him inside."
Draco got off of him and picked him up by his arm, and once he stood, Draco had him suffocated in his own embrace.
“It hurts so much,” Harry cried, letting the tear fall from his eye, and of course, Draco did his duty.
“Yes,” Harry answered. He took a breath, backed all the way to the door and sprinted along the length of the platform, only to jump over the latter and free-fall to the floor where he landed on his stomach, was absorbed, and sprung up again like a child on a trampoline. He laughed like one, too. “Draco, come on, try it! It’s like you’re flying, but you’re not!”
Draco took a three fingers, although shaking, and shoved them in Harry's face. "Lick them." Harry obeyed and encased his mouth around the fingers, sucking on it, and the heat made Draco's cock twitch and he realized he wanted Harry's tongue on him again.
When he returned to the table, Ron patted his back. "Mate, I don't know why you're so upset about this. We'll be a shoe-in for the cup." Ron needed the encouragement more than Harry did.
"Yeah but if I wouldn't of been my Malfoy self and stopped.... You wouldn't of kicked the crap out of me."
"You did most of the work," Harry called back. Draco just smiled and climbed off the bed, kissing his forehead on the way to the door. "Don't you want some clothes?"
"What do you want to do," Draco looked deep into his eyes, as if what he was saying was the most important thing in the world.
The two headed towards the library, not knowing that Blaise and Pansy had been hiding behind a statue in the main dungeons hallway, listening to their whole conversation.
But Draco attended the next lesson, too, and seeing him made Harry's heart skip a beat, but also made his stomach drop. Draco's eyes had dark circles, as they were during Sixth Year. Harry knew what pain he was in.
"Some time," Pansy questioned. "He has to get married by the end of they year, he's going to propose before Christmas and it's already going to be November next week."
Draco was sprinting through the dark halls as fast as he could, just trying to find the right room. The night gave St. Mungos Hospital an eerie and abandoned feeling, even though there were plenty of nurses around. They all wore the same face, looking at him in utter dismay.
"Yeah, we have flourless pancakes," Draco smirked, leaving Harry to laugh with a bright, happy smile.
"So why don't we just be naked if you're looking for speed here? We could get right to it if we didn't wear anything at all."
The group walked up numerous passageways, corridors, and stairs before they reached their final destination: a wall. That's it. A wall. Draco was utterly confused as he loosened his grip slightly on the Chang girl, whom he had dug his nails into the whole walk, probably resulting in bruising.
"I wasn't actually going to pay them. Fuck abusive arseholes. They don't deserve it. If it would've been a good family, I would've done it no problem, but they're shitty."
"And I know that no matter how hard I try to move on, I won't. I've already tried," Harry looked off into the lake, "I mean people have told me it will get better with time, but sometimes there's just too much that time can fix."
Draco walked through the vine ropes only to hear a crack of a twig. He looked around the field to find it empty, and since he'd already been late himself, he wondered if Harry was even going to show up. He took a step forward, hearing another crack and immediately he disregarded it as the branch beneath his foot. However, what he wasn't anticipating was the upside down Harry suddenly swinging in front of him to block his path, although Draco was too frightened to move anyway.
"PANSY!" It was before first class and Draco was in his room, already dressed. He was the happiest man in the world. Somebody loved him.
"Yes, and I'm fine! Now would you just shut up before you wake up the entire goddamned school!" Draco opened his mouth to argue back, but Harry spoke in a softer tone than what he was using before. "Really, Draco, I'm okay. Look, I have chocolate." Harry gave him a half smile. Draco didn't return.
Pansy closed her mouth. "I'm sorry. But he has to do what he has to do to live. I can't speak about it."
He spat as he walked out the door. When it clicked shut, the chains burst free, and all Draco could do was stare at the only friend he had at the manor. He wouldn't help, couldn't help, lost the ability to.
Harry would only admit that it was fun talking about Quidditch with him, especially since Ron and him weren't on speaking terms.
And without thinking, Draco draped an arm around Harry's neck and buried one in his hair, pulling on it, because fuck it felt so good to. And Harry was so warm and safe and
Draco put on his "Harry Potter Fan Club" button and flipped through the Polaroids of them together. Then he opened the book he made as a child with the list of things he wanted to do with Harry and flipped through it. However, on the last page, there was entirely new writing:
"So we will be running on no food, no sleep, and no sex all day." Draco smiled slightly at that, a half-smirk so to speak, before frowning oh so faintly as he massaged Harry's head.
"Fuh, Harreh," he bit down hard on the tie. It was so hard not to grip anything, and he couldn't necessarily look back at him either. All he knew was that he was
Harry took several steps back. “Y-You tell Voldemort my secrets? You talk, you have conversations with him about me."
Harry sat up for more. "During one of our fake dates, I nearly fell off my broom. That's when I saw his eyes change colors. Even if Draco loved me, and didn't know it, it's not like in that moment he was going to spare his life for mine. Hell, he probably wanted to drop me. He didn't love me then."
"Okay, which one of you punched him," Dr. Barmer asked as he took his seat. They were in a small conference room which held four chairs, but only three were filled. Draco was laying in his bed, sedated as they fixed his nose.
When he opened the door he found himself in a room filled with so many books, he couldn't see. His task was to put them in alphabetical order, but he knew that wouldn't happen within the night. He got to work, filling up shelves and clearing the piles.
"I love you so much," Draco said, pressing kisses to his lips as he gave him long, luxurious strokes.
Ron stretched. "Well we have Potions next. Maybe he'll be back to his usual arrogant self by then," he concluded.
Harry had just stopped thinking about whatever Snape had been talking to Malfoy about, sitting alone at the dining hall as he had missed dinner with his friends, when an unwelcome reminder approached him.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry noted a wild dash of red move in his direction. The red was paired with a freckled face, and long limbs.
He looked offended. "Didn't think it would affect me, Potter. I like to think I’m stronger than a little love potion,” he said. “Don’t insult me.”
Malfoy’s eyes, momentarily, lost that sense of dreaminess and instead hardened. It was gone almost instantly, though, when he said smoothly, “I just say and get what I want, and you don’t like that about me.”
“Only a couple lessons, that’s it,” Harry cut him off. He definitely did not want to do it and he was growing more wary by the second, but it was money and Harry could use it for over the summer.
Rather, he was back to enjoying quality time with Ron on the Quidditch field and accompanying Hermione to the library to work on some of their essays.
He then kissed Harry. In a different way. Not his usual, hard and needy one. He kissed Harry softly, in a way that made his stomach feel light and fluffy instead of hot and tight.
Malfoy both seemed to push Harry away but also pull him closer, finally deciding to let him go with a disgruntled noise.
He hated how he was acting; it was sheerly embarrassing. Harry reasoned with himself, trying to tell himself that it was just a kiss and nothing to get worked up over. They had both agreed
Ron rolled his eyes. “He can handle himself, Mione. If he wants to get his ass kicked again, he can.”
There was a pause where Malfoy’s cocky look suddenly disappeared again. His face was unreadable and, for a moment, Harry worried that he had misinterpreted everything. He worried that Malfoy’s sudden softness, his allowing Harry to sleep with his arms around him, his gentle kisses on the forehead, had all been just customary.
Harry was pacing in the Slytherin common room. His head was hurting so bad he thought it might explode. He was used to this with his scar, but feeling so stressed over a person that his head was pounding relentlessly, that was foreign to him.
In class, Malfoy made sure that he kept his eyes resolutely on the professor and, the moment class was over, he would leave flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. It was impossible to get him alone.
Harry leaned back, observing Malfoy. He had a slight flush on his cheeks and his white-blonde hair was frizzy. "Quite," he said at last. "I mean... I thought you hate me."
Harry did not know what to say. He felt, if anything, even more offended. He felt disbelief rising up in his chest—it was his turn to be angry.
The two looked away hastily. Harry began to busy himself with writing his name on parchment over and over.
Harry was intent, however, on flipping to the correct pages in the textbook. “You said it earlier Malfoy, let's just get this over with, shall we?”
Malfoy was evidently taken aback, mouth slightly open, and refused to meet Harry’s eye. He seemed as though he were trying, and failing, to find the proper words.
For once, he was extraordinarily relieved to have heard Snape’s voice as it silenced Ron and Hermione and sent Malfoy sauntering back over to join his friends. His face, Harry noticed, was screwed up with great annoyance.
Harry was unable to hide any reaction now. He looked at him still, more dubiously now as he waited to see if there were any trace of a joke in this. However, Malfoy’s expression remained rather stone-like.
Harry found himself back in the Slytherin common room, then began to meander through the king halls of their dormitories until he came to Malfoy and Zabini’s door.
It wasn't just him looking more cheerful. Maybe it was the influence of just being around the potion, but the class seemed far more mellow and the pairs appeared to be sitting closer. A pink haze seemed to have set over the room.
Harry shrugged, watching Malfoy turn an even brighter pink—almost as pink as the potion—at his passiveness. “Okay.”
“Now you’re sounding like my mother,” Ron tossed a piece of chocolate wrapping at Harry, narrowly missing his head. “Let me know if you need any backup with Malfoy. I can always hold his arms behind his back.”
“Why not?” she shrugged. She was still looking at him questioningly. Her eyes were glowing with excitement. “Oh, come on! Just give it a try.”
When Malfoy did finally pull away, he managed to immediately slant his eyes away and clear his throat awkwardly.
He slid his fingers into his hair, giving a tug a bit harder than he intended. Instead of flinching away, though, Malfoy let out a soft moan around him—almost as if he liked that. So Harry did it again.
Harry was watching Malfoy intently though, and was only able to manage a little hum of acknowledgement.
Malfoy grudgingly jotted some of that down, not looking up from where he was half-heartedly scribbling.
Harry looked up and, to his surprise, so did Ron and Hermione to look at him eagerly. For once, they looked just as curious as Malfoy. He could have sworn he saw a couple of the other Gryffindors glance over in their direction too.
Harry wedged his way between the two, who were practically inches apart and still cursing and spewing venomous insults.
Malfoy stopped rocking his hips, putting his hands on Harry’s chest. “We both know that won’t happen,” he said coolly, looking unbothered. He continued after a moment.
Malfoy stepped away suddenly. His eyes revealed nothing. “So, you’re not my tutor anymore,” he said. “I won’t require your services.”
"—But I was wondering if you knew something about... Malfoy?" Ron asked, trying to sound casual but evidently worried he might set Harry off. "I mean, he has been acting a bit odd. Didn’t you notice?”
Harry continued to rock his hips absently until his orgasm died down, and then became aware of Malfoy whining desperately. Harry had continued to stroke his probably-overstimulated cock, which was still covered in white.
He also mentioned how Snape threatened him with his grade (“Oh, no!” Hermione had exclaimed at once).
“That isn’t fair!” Harry protested, leaping out of his chair. “It’s not my fault he’s struggling in class!”
Malfoy, finally, smirked. “Enjoy that, did you?” He asked, sounding very proud of himself. It was the last thing he expected him to say. “Thought you would.”
Facing forward again, Harry raised his eyebrows and felt his cheeks grow warm. It was strange to hear the word love with Malfoy boring holes into him with his eyes. Harry could not read his expression, besides the sneer that was plastered on his mouth.
“You’d rather not go to class?” Harry challenged. “Then don’t act shocked when you get failing grades and need me to tutor you!”
Malfoy’s own face was unreadable. His features gave away nothing, which made the situation even worse. Harry’s stomach twisted
Harry let out a quiet noise that sounded like a cross between a gasp and a cry. “No!” he pleaded, trying and failing to not sound miserably needy. “Just come on and do it, Malfoy, please. You know I’m a whore now, okay? So just do it.”
At least, Harry said to himself, Malfoy showed up to this session. They were both cold and short with each other. It was almost worse than when they first began.
Thinking about this for a great amount of time, Harry was silent again. Why had he chosen to go about it that way?
“You can still kiss me,” Malfoy muttered. His arms were crossed and he was studying his shoes suddenly, as if they were very interesting.
Harry flicked his fingers in annoyance. “No, you have to finish going over your essay,” he said and pushed Malfoy away, gently as he could. “It counts as a big part of your grade. If you want to pass this class, you’ll have to do decently well on it.”
“You are such an ass,” Harry said, shoving him roughly. “As if I didn’t have enough on my plate and there are plenty of decent tutors out there, you had to nag Snape to get on my case. Can’t you afford the best?”
Harry found it hard to focus in class that day. His mind was elsewhere, still running through the scenario repeatedly in his head. He found himself exceptionally confused on a number of levels.
Harry pushed his shoulders back, puffing his chest out a bit ridiculously as he approached Malfoy. “Hello,” he attempted in a controlled and cool voice. “I’m ready to begin when you are.”
“Merlin, you love this. You told you didn’t like cock or me, but suddenly it seems like you like both,” Malfoy said as began to build a constant pace. Each thrust forced Harry back against the desk. “Right?”
Even Potions seemed to be only moderately frustrating, with Malfoy choosing to sit on the other side of the room with him. This allowed Harry to draw in ink on his parchment while Snape went over notes, with Ron beside him watching and Hermione on the other side taking notes meticulously.
“What the hell indeed,” Harry agreed, voice so low that it took even him aback. “Good luck on your final grades. I won’t be helping. Hire a different tutor; like you said, you can afford the best.”
“I’ve been tutoring Malfoy in the Slytherin common area, you know this,” Harry snapped. “His preference not mine. Also, not very clever of a password. Sea serpent? Quite pathetic.”
Jeering, Malfoy crossed his arms over his chest. "Why would I want to talk to you?" He asked, loud enough for half the class to hear. It certainly earned him some wanted attention.
“Oh?” Hermione said, then spoke quickly as if she were reciting lines. “I thought Snape wanted you to work with him til the end of the semester? He said he’d drop your grade, Harry!”
Malfoy eyed him for what felt like five long minutes before returning to his spot among the Slytherins. Every once in a while, Harry would see him glance over at Harry suspiciously.
Harry regarded him wearily. Malfoy was now looking far more confident than he was comfortable with. His throat felt cottony and dry. “What?”
Harry exhaled slowly. His heart was thudding and he remembered just how stubborn Malfoy could be, so decided it would be best to just give in and get the talking over with.
Harry froze, eyes flying open suddenly. His body went stiff as a board. He could hardly believe it. His head was swimming and all he was aware of was Malfoy’s warm, slightly-chapped lips against his own.
Harry quickly threw his cloak on the floor. "I'm fine," He lied. He crawled into his own bed, his face still warm.
His head was foggy. He knew that he had perhaps jumped the gun on walking out on Malfoy, but Harry had his own studying to do, and Quidditch to practice for, and something of a social life, and-- and he was making excuses for Malfoy’s behavior. Which he did not need to do.
Harry allowed his head to fall forward, cocking it slightly. "And how does that even work?" he inquired.
Harry looked up to find that Ron and Hermione had already scooted close together. Annoyed, he thought he would go to Neville but he saw that he was crouched together with Luna. He turned around.
However, thirty minutes into the lesson, Malfoy was trying to touch Harry’s neck, his hair, and tried to distract Harry by kissing along his neck open-mouthed again.
Surely not anybody else on the staff? Dumbledore never was too interested in his and Malfoy’s arguments and would have nothing to gain from pairing them up.
“No need for a reminder,” Malfoy looked positively annoyed. “I remember how distinctly boring you are.”
Malfoy’s mouth turned into a scowl and he began to dust off his robes. He made a point to look disgusted.
She eyed him suspiciously and, after a moment, folded her book and put it aside. Her eyes were now glowing with delight.
“None of your business, Potter. Contrary to what Snape says, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, looking down at Harry in disgust. “I was better on my own.”
He had told the two that he wanted to talk with Dumbledore and, to his relief, neither of them seemed like they wanted to inquire further on that matter.
Harry, at the feeling of him tightening and moaning through his fingers, craned his neck and came inside of Malfoy.
It almost took Harry all of yesterday to comprehend that, yes, that had actually happened. When Harry returned to his dorm, he had to blow out the candle beside his bed to hide from Ron his glowing-red face.
It was about midway through the lesson. Harry had just finished explaining to Malfoy a powerful counter jinx for—for something—Harry was not thinking straight because Malfoy was biting the end of his quill.
Harry sat up abruptly too. “I don’t know why I even bothered,” Harry said. “I really don’t. I knew that Snape would have just had it in for me.”
Sitting up straighter, Harry leaned into Malfoy without getting too close, mind you. He had to lean away quickly though because suddenly Draco’s cologne seemed very, very strong.
“Malfoy,” Harry said more firmly before his mouth could travel further. He found himself to be distracted easily when in Malfoy’s presence.
Harry could not understand what Malfoy was going on about. Again, his mind was racing and he asked, in genuine confusion, "What's wrong with me looking at you?”
Harry kissed him. He didn’t know why he did it. He had never exactly considered it, but it was quite nice. He had soft lips at least, Harry noted to himself, though a bit dry. Tasted like coffee. He smelled like woodfire.
“Bloody brilliant,” Malfoy murmured, casting his eyes away from Harry and turning his body away pointedly. “Let's get this over with.”
At least not until Draco leaned forward, attempting to push himself onto Harry. Harry, trying to push him back, was unsuccessful. Grabbing onto him to keep his balance, it caused them both to fall out of their chairs.
Immediately, Harry knew it was the wrong thing to say when Malfoy sneered, “No, Potter, I’m not here to have a lively little chat with you about my day,” he said harshly. “I’d rather just do what I’ve paid you to do.”
Harry scowled then, nerves vanishing suddenly and wondering how he thought that he could have possibly had a thing for Malfoy.
Malfoy was evidently pleased. “I know,” he said, and pushed inside of him in a single methodical thrust.
Malfoy kissed him, hands finding his chest—Harry’s hands stayed lamely at his side for a minute until he nudged forward, inches apart from one another.
Malfoy had settled himself in now. He was looking cozied up in the chair, his wand in hand, and he looked very impatient. “Well?”
Professor McGonagall held her breath, looking as though she wanted to interrupt and put Snape’s demands to bed. At last, she spoke. "Severus, I don't find that appropriate..."
He walked away with a taunting look, waving comically. He looked slightly amused at the ridiculous look that was inevitably bewildered.
The next tutoring session was filled with fury and snide comments. They began by insulting each other, and Malfoy was quick to go after Harry’s dead parents—with Harry retorting that at least they had never been a follower of You-Know-Who.
Carefully, he watched him writing, making corrections every once in a while. He pointed to areas in the textbook that he felt may be helpful and, for the first time, Malfoy seemed to be interested and diligent in his work.
He turned back to his work. "Now. As I was saying, get into pairs and we will begin creating amortentia, one of the strongest love potions. Even one sip will affect someone strongly," He said, pausing in the front of the room. "Into pairs. Go."
“I don’t know why I like this so much,” Harry admitted in such a rush, he immediately felt winded. “Why I like you, kind of.”
Harry saw Malfoy in the hall the next day. He was laughing and joking around with some of his fellow Slytherins, who were looking at him with something of admiration that Harry himself could not begin to understand.
Ron grumbled but pocketed his wand, very slowly albeit. He continued to glance between the two, balling and unballing his fist as though that were his preferred weapon anyway.
She was still fretting over his eye. “You’ll be all bruised up tomorrow,” she scolded. “Honestly, boys are just so stupid sometime. Fighting!”
“You two are on equal playing fields now,” Harry said, instantly feeling guilty for bringing Neville down in the meantime. “How does that feel?”
Yet, recently, there had been a sadness in his eyes that Harry could not deny being curious about. And they had been fucking for almost two months now without any sort of label.
Harry’s head would explode at any moment, he decided, and his heart was beating so hard that he was positive Malfoy could hear it. His whole body was stiff with shock.
“I don’t care, okay?” Harry ran a hand through his hair, wondering why he was even telling Malfoy this. “Why do you care so much about this?”
Harry stuttered, unsure, as Malfoy just smiled. He knew that he was doing this to just get a reaction and yet, Harry could not help but provide him one with a look of bewilderment.
Malfoy grew angrier, his own wand still half aloft. “Call your ginger friend off, and let’s go discuss next week’s assignment. I find it will be easier if we clear things up.”
He trailed off as Malfoy pressed his hips against his own. He began to rock them absently, making Harry clutch at his robes. He could get used to this, he thought, as his head leaned back and hit the wall painfully.
“Fancy to show off my handiwork this morning, did you Potter?” Malfoy asked quietly, tracing his hand along the bruise on his neck.
“Then, we need to talk about your tutoring,” Harry retorted, choosing his words extraordinary carefully. “Now. And I’d like to not put it off.”
It was growing dark very late now. Only then was the sun beginning to dip lower beneath the tops of the mountains, a gentle golden light filling the Gryffindor common room. The late sunshine and warm rooms were making all students feel at ease.
After a while, they pulled away and sat in silence. It was awkward, but it was also just them trying to understand all that was happening. It was confusing.
“The Room of Requirement!” Harry mused. “Nobody else will be able to get in. We can just say that we need a place to meet," He supplied quietly.
Harry attempted to enjoy his last couple nights of freedom but his mind was unwillingly plagued with Malfoy and Snape and cursing whoever had decided it was okay to put him in this predicament.
“I think you truly wanted that. I could tell. You’d been wanting it for a while,” Harry said, his chest suddenly swelling with confidence. His heart began to beat quickly. “Why else would you have done that? Give me a reason.”
Harry returned to the dorms to talk to Ron and Hermione briskly, explaining breathlessly that Snape had said that the orders were not his, that the wishes for Malfoy to tutor Harry were not his own. However, Harry could not figure out who else would put him in this sort of predicament.
Malfoy pursed his lips. “Is that a yes then? You don’t have to, I don’t need you,” he sneered, almost as an afterthought. “Snape mentioned it. But there are plenty of other half-decent wizards who would be more than  pleased to—“
“Honestly, Harry,” Hermione said, and Ron and he exchanged looks before Hermione went off on a tangent about how their grades were important for their future careers and… and then Harry’s thoughts began to wander.
Harry sat down in Snape’s class the next day, the presence of Malfoy behind him almost mocking. The two had parted the day before acting as though not much had happened, other than some absent-minded flirting that Harry wrote off as Malfoy attempting to diffuse the tension; that, or a few well-timed insults.
Hermione gave him a sympathetic look and Ron mouthed apologetically to him as they left, evidently taking their time as if hoping to get an earful of what was going on.
“I said turn around,” Harry repeated, more coldly now. He stared at Malfoy’s mouth unwillingly. He was grabbing Malfoy’s sides and trying, to no avail, to get him to listen.
Harry snorted. He couldn’t imagine why, but the thought of a hundred girls trying to get at Malfoy made him feel bothered. Made him annoyed, made his cheeks flush red, and his throat dry. He exhaled, trying to push the thought away.
Harry took a breath. He could barely bring himself to look at Malfoy without feeling somewhat embarrassed. “I’ll tutor you again.”
They were soon sitting with the textbooks in front of them as they finished out the lesson. Their hair was in disarray, the room smelled of sex, and their scarves nearly got swapped. It was Harry who quickly had to grab his Gryffindor scarf before Malfoy had.
Malfoy just opened up his book and grabbed a quill. Admittedly, he already looked more studious and attentive tonight.
Zanini opened their door and immediately bristled. “Potter,” he said sourly. “What are you doing in the Slytherin dormitory? Who gave you the password.”
Harry rounded on him for a moment but then realized his eyes were gleaming with good humor. Again, Harry felt guilty for the second time that day.
When Harry put down his quill, he touched his finger to his lips. He could not fathom that he had kissed Malfoy. Or, Malfoy had kissed him, he corrected himself quickly.
“I—I just thought that was best because I was copying you,” he said, knowing full well how absurd he sounded.
Zabini looked taken aback, going from looking interrupted to purely offended. “Potter, if you don’t find yourself out of here, I have the nerve to go straight to—“
Snape was sitting at his desk, not looking up from where he was as he wrote determinedly on parchment. He was frowning and gave Harry a disapproving, withering stare as he approached his desk. Harry tried not to appear as timid as he felt.
“It’s okay, Ron,” he said, but Ron cast him an anxious look. “I think it was just a misunderstanding.”
Ron ducked head down and whispered to Harry in a voice so low, he had to lean in also to hear him say, “You shack up with someone, mate? You got a girlfriend?”
At last, he spoke: “No, I want you to admit it,” Malfoy chided in a decided tone. “Admit you want me. Admit you aren’t doing this just to tutor me.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Wanted to,” he said, and uncharacteristically, leaned forward to kiss Harry on the cheek. “Problem?”
Harry swallowed thickly and said to Malfoy, quite curtly, “Come on, I’d like to begin instead of having you make small talk with others from your House.”
“Don’t you blame this on me, Potter,” Malfoy hissed, trying to elbow him. And, when Harry tried to dive for him again, he was held back this time by McGonagall.
Harry breathed out and put his head in the crook of Malfoy’s neck. He always forgot how significantly taller Malfoy was by comparison to him. He smelled quite good, Harry noted to himself; he would never admit this to him, though.
Harry nodded slowly, still not speaking. He still did not understand but did not want to interject again.
“‘Fraid so, if I’d like to keep on passing Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he simpered. He patted her, almost degradingly, on her head. “I’ll have more free time tomorrow, thankfully.”
He cleared his throat, shaking his head a bit. He refocused his eyes on his textbook for Transfiguration; the words, however, seemed fuzzy on the page.
Malfoy nodded curtly. "I think that should work," He said, seeming to be acting much more amiable than usual. He seemed much more cheerful now, almost grinning. “This way we will be alone.”
Harry must have turned red with anger. “Maybe if you tried to be a better student, you wouldn’t have been failing in the first place.”
Snape began to pass around their exams from the week prior and, at first, Harry did not give them much thought. He thought he did moderately decently. But then Snape placed a test, folded, on Malfoy’s desk.
Malfoy and his friends laughed wildly. Crabbe and Goyle banged their fists obnoxiously on the table while Harry delivered a scathing stare to Malfoy.
"I don't know what my own thoughts are. It's like having a second brain tells me that getting better is the worst thing I could possibly do for myself. It wants to kill me. My own brain wants to kill me with something I've been tortured with my whole life."
And then a tightness and wonderful pressure began to build and Harry couldn't help but let out a moan. Then, he gasped and covered his mouth, though he was too caught up in the feeling to worry too much.
"Yeah Hermione," Dean joined in, "Don't ruin it. We could be noted as the friends who got the perfect couple together!"
"Harry, I'm not good enough for you and you know it deep down so why don't you just admit it to yourself and we can move on with our lives?"
That was the first time Harry's stomach dropped around Draco. Something didn't feel right, and all this time, Harry passed it off like he was crazy. He told himself that everything felt the same between him and Draco.
"But this was so much more fun," Draco did the same, taking a big bite of eggs, "Besides," he mumbled through the food, "he provoked me."
"This one says that memory loss is only permanent when the means of the spell caster seek permanency. What does that mean? There are memory spells that only temporarily make someone lose their memory."
The heartbreak was written on his face. “No. I’ve never thought about that.” Harry took a step back but he choked up as he said, “It’s you and me. Harry and Draco, Draco and Harry. It’s—we’ve been together for almost two years. How could I ever not want to be with you? I
"You're not allowed a wand. We can return it to your families when they come by," the nurse said, and Harry didn't want to let go of Draco's wand, but he did.
"You're so beautiful," Harry cried, and it didn't do him justice. It didn't do any of the experience justice at all.
"Draco, stop it," Harry begged, yanking his hand from Draco's grasp, but Draco just gripped his shoulder and kept his hand there to hold him in place.
"These events have affected them differently than they have affected you, so I must advise you don't compare your recovery to theirs."
“Yes she did,” he swallowed with the help of pumpkin juice. “She said I was a horrible fiancé and that she could treat you much better. I imagine she’d bring you flowers and bow down to you because you’re Harry Potter.”
"Later, I have more important matters." He broke away from Snape and went to the food table, grabbing a plate, and as he expected, Harry came over too. “Hey you,” he whispered. Harry grabbed a plate but not necessarily food.
Anxiety/Depression: There is not one specific chapter that I can point to that has this, but it is definitely in there, especially in a sixth year on, and even in fifth year, too. Seventh year and eigth year both have deep-dives into these subjects, with both feelings and thoughts described in depth.
And then Harry pulled back. "And now we get to go to class holding hands, with no reservation. No fear. No hiding. No feeling guilty. We can actually say that we made it."
"I've tried every day. Harry, you're freaking me out." Ron nodded, a concerned look on his face. He squeezed Harry's shoulder before getting up and leaving. Harry didn't move or even look at him. "Can I borrow the cloak? Don't want to get caught skipping class." Hermione handed it to him.
He took a deep breath. "I'm not allowed to date. The Malfoy family always has arranged marriages into wealthy families. The plan is that I have to find someone to marry by my seventeenth birthday and we have to be married within the year. I'm not allowed to date before that, really."
However, Harry always respected when Draco said no. He was a good and decent person, which, during the Plan to Seduce Potter, was something Draco used and would have to start using to his advantage. Almost give it to him and then take it away.
"Well, more than that. He looked at her a lot. You know, those lingering glances that you two used to have?"
And he might not be good enough for the train to his right. But Harry was on it. And he wanted him so much.
"You guys don't even fight properly. You sound like an old married couple," Seamus raised an eyebrow. Harry thought to himself 'not there yet, but that's the goal.' He couldn't wait to grow old with Draco. He imagined them together, waking up on Sundays and sleeping all day, or going to cafés with him and eating all the scones, or raising a family together.
Late, he rushed to his first class, which was almost over, so instead of going inside, he waited in the hall for Blaise.
"Ah," Harry smiled despite the pain. "Weirdly painful but in a rewarding way." Still, Draco reached for his wand, and cast a spell. Relief overcame him. "You and your safety spells."
“You need to stop being such a goody-goody, Lily.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and Draco squeezed it so hard, Harry’s knuckles went white.
"Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends."
"Fuck yes, it does, Harry!" Draco dug his nails into Harry's back again, trying to hang on, but Harry's voice... his voice...
Searching to get his mind off of the lack of romance he himself was having, he turned to Hermione to find her leaving. Curiosity drove him to follow.
While looking for the illuminated snitch, Harry "mistook" a firefly for the object instead, and headed for the trees outside of the arena. He was now hanging from a tree, his broom stick laying on the dead branches beneath him. "Could you go any faster!"
"Too bad that I love them." Harry stood and went up behind him, pressing his chest to the blonds back. He wrapped his arms around his waist, leaving Draco to smile and lean back on him, his head fitting in the crook of his neck.
When he turned around, Narcissa was behind him. She grabbed his hand and rushed them back to the drawing room, where Granger lay, twisted and crying, Mudblood carved into her arm.
He always debated whether or not these calls were better than when he went on missions for the Dark Lord. Either way, he had to hurt people, break the law. But at least out there, he watched the torture of people instead of did it himself. And he hadn't had the order to kill anyone yet.
He lay in a bed, the covers up to his neck. His shoulders shook and chokes echoed throughout the empty wing.
"Good. So... erm... here lay down." Draco switched with him so his back was against the pillows. He too realized his nerves, and it was if he couldn't move because of them. Harry did as told, and lifted his legs so his arse was in the air... sort of... He was shy and Draco respected that. "Here," Draco got an extra pillow and put it under his lower back, "More comfortable?"
Draco wasn't expecting anything, but received a famous Weasley sweater with 'D' stitched on the front.
Draco walked to it, picking the flower up and stroking the petals while Harry stood and watched him. "You did all of this for me?"
Harry's saving grace was the calming draught—though it only worked so much, and as weeks passed, he found himself having to take a higher and higher dose in desperation.
'Hey you,' was all it said. Draco inked his quill to write back, but Pansy stopped him, giving hand signals.
When Snape told everyone to pair up with their partners for the second half of the Calming Draught project, Draco couldn't keep his heart from leaping.
"I... I don't have an answer for you... I don't," Draco gulped, "I don't really know why. I can't explain it," he looked off into the lake. "We've grown, times have changed. We have," he put his hands in his pockets and bit his lip.
"Yes, we only have major ones." Draco rolled his eyes. "Wait, we had that fight before the holiday about how much you hate my father?"
Draco sat on a rock. It was a big rock, good enough to make a seat, by the sand on the edge of the shore. "Nice face, Potter." He watched the calm of the lake fold over itself, remembering how much he really missed this place,the calm serenity of it all, the beautiful sky, no Dark Lord running amuck, teaching how to kill, how to commit crime and murder. Well, any place without the Dark Lord was a good one.
Dean and Seamus set up a new game of chess while the rest lounged on the couch. Neville sat and watched as Ron and Hermione cuddled on the love seat.
Suddenly Draco couldn't breath. He loosened his tie and rounded the corner to the second floor corridor. Harry's soul. He could just feel it. His soul, just so pure and good and genuine and authentic and fuck this hurt so bad...
"Fine with me. I enjoy masks." Harry's hair was soaking wet and stuck to his face. Draco reached into one of his drawers and grabbed a green headband. He pulled out his wand and duplicated it, handing one to Harry who just stared at his, and putting one on himself. Harry shorted at the sight of Draco's usually well-kept hair sticking out in frays. Draco transfigured a hand towel into a luxurious bathrobe that matched his one that Harry was wearing. "Laugh all you want. You're the one who always says I have soft skin. You washed your face, right?" Harry nodded. "Good."
... And my hips are too small. I have ugly feet. You know how you look at yourself in the mirror when you're alone?"
"We're selling the estate. I need your signature," Draco said bitterly. He held out a stack of parchment, the first title reading
Draco didn't realize the horrible caveat to Plan DBR. For some stupid reason, he only planned up until Dooms Day. He didn't even think of what was supposed to happen after he broke Harry's heart. Now that Harry knew he was a Death Eater, he had to actually
It was back to snarky comments and dull remarks about the homework. A bizarre feeling had settled over the room.
Malfoy grabbed his wrists and pinned them over his head. For a minute they just stared, mouth parted slightly, at the other, as Malfoy worked Harry open. His pace, Harry noticed, was careful but needy.
“Fine,” Harry said shortly. “But you’re to take me seriously this time. I’m not doing this for fun and neither are you.”
Now, Malfoy looked indignant. “Wait a damn minute, Potter, what kind of insinuation are you making? Pansy may have a thing for me but we are not involved.”
It was at that moment Draco Malfoy stood up and sauntered over. Harry sat, silently praying he didn’t start anything, but his prayers were not answered because the Slytherin stood right in front of his table.
When he sat down in class, he was unaware of the people gaping at him until he saw that Ron had joined in.
“I’ll show you, Weasel!” Malfoy snarled, “Don’t you dare talk badly about my mum, or I swear you will suddenly find yourself unable to have children.”
“I just wanted to shut you up and a punch did not seem fitting at that time, so I just did what I felt was right—which now I realize was not right,” Malfoy added the last bit, almost as an afterthought. “Right now a punch seems more accurate—“
Harry was never in a relationship with anyone besides Cho and Ginny, and both of those ended quickly. Besides, he was never with another man. Shuffling, he moved a bit closer to Draco cautiously.
“I’m warning you!” Malfoy snarled, and pulled out his wand. Harry, for some reason, did not feel too worried.
It wasn’t until Harry had been walking down the corridors after class, mindless as his thoughts were elsewhere, when two hands grabbed him by the neck of his robes. He felt his throat tighten as his tie was forcibly yanked into a side-passage.
Snape tapped the desk with his wand sharply. "Potter," He said. "Ten points from Gryffindor for daydreaming in my class."
In response to this, the blonde arched an eyebrow. He added, as if it were a great privilege, “So? You do want to do it, right?”
Harry had been wearing a scarf for two days in a row, but on that third day, he woke up late for class and rushed to Snape’s without it. His hair was untidy, in a disarray, and he barely had time to button up his shirt.
He could already hear Hermione chiding in his head to leave it alone. He could also hear Ron cursing Malfoy under his breath and trying to get Harry away from him.
Harry knew where this was going. He ground his teeth together, prepared for the name that was evidently floating to Ron's lips.
Ron raised his eyebrows. "Him," He jerked his chin at the Slytherin table pointedly. "He usually never shuts up or misses a chance to call you out."
"Hey you," the all too familiar voice said. Draco got up from his spot and went to greet his love. Harry immediately accepted him in open arms, wrapping his arms around his waist and kissing him chastely.
"No. Don't talk. You're supposed to be in a cellar right now, and I'm taking you down there, I just want you to... I don't know why I have you here, but I'm not letting you get hurt and she just... I'm sorry, okay! Fuck you! I hate it when you look at me like that!"
After a few moments, Harry surrendered and relaxed, resting his head against Draco's, though not hugging him back. That'd look plain weird and would be absolutely unexplainable. "I know."
They didn't know who kissed whom, but all they knew was that their lips were together and the snitch fluttered between both of their fingers.
But as he tossed it into the pile, a photo fell out. It was the picture of him and Draco laughing, staring right at each other. Fuck this.
The problem with tragedy is that it's sneaky and deceptive. It hides in the normal, flat glass of a calm ocean.
But Harry had forgotten that he was a celebrity now, more than before. Hogsmeade was packed. Parents with their children pointed at him, teenagers, adults, even the elderly, all were surprised by him. Gasps came as he entered a shop, and left, whispers which weren't really whispers.
Rolling his eyes, Draco then bit his lip, thinking. "Last year I told Trelawney that I had a philosophical dream that her death date was Friday the 13th, but I didn't know which year, so every Friday the 13th, she'll flip!"
But being with each other was as easy as being theirselves in their most honest form, like coming home, like taking off the mask. Like remembering the true beings that rested in their cores.
"Yes they were," Harry replied. "We used to make bets as to who would win in 5th year before he got us banned from it."
But, thankfully, she'd given him a triple dose of the highest amount of calming draught he could take, and it numbed him enough to survive the following days and let him think through the plan.
"Please Harry," Draco gasped. Harry let him out of his mouth just so he could breathe a bit, and then he took him back in, bobbing and making an easy pattern for himself, almost taking him completely in. "Nghahh!"
"Clearly," he dropped his quill and folded his fingers together. "And you followed us into the Room of Requirement. And you watched us do...
"I don't want you to get hurt. You're more important than me. You have to live, so you can kill him. There was a reason for my suffering, it wasn't pointless." Draco swallowed. "I talked to Snape. I'm not allowed on missions anymore. I have to do private training with him instead."
"They're nice, by the way," Harry said in honesty, though he did blush, too. "Surprisingly comfortable except my arse is hanging out."
Draco sniffed. "I just don't want you to ever be scared that I'm going to hurt you. There will always be a part of you that's on guard because of what I did to you and to others, and you don't deserve that."
All they could see was Lucius's eyes widened and mouth word 'avada' before Harry apparated them away.
She was right, their paths, his and Harry's, were alike, except the missing links from his paths in Draco's. "Were these memories missing with Mr. Potter," Madam Pomfrey asked.
Then Hermione hugged him sweetly, and then went to Harry. Ron stood there and eyed him, only to have Draco raise an eyebrow at him.
He just wanted to talk to Harry about this whole situation. That's what he needed. There was one person he told everything to, and that was Harry Potter. Not telling him this killed him. He needed his best friend and his boyfriend to know, to be there for him. Just to even say, wow, that fucking sucks. Just to have his shoulder.
While Neville ran to get a few pies while they got started. Seriousness rang through the air. There was no joking around when it came to chess, and even when Harry would try and joke with him, he would just get a "Shut up, Potter."
“Draco, why haven’t you talked to me since before the ball, which you refused to go to without a solid reason not to, which you so have not told me. I have a right to know, since I am going to be your wife, shouldn’t I know everything?” She put her hand on her hips. Harry just stared at her like she was utter prey. He automatically hated her. She was disgusting in his eyes. Clingy and annoying, a daddy’s girl, a snotty aristocrat that got whatever she wanted. “Why won’t you even look me in the eye? And why are you hanging out with Potter?”
Hermione frowned. "I'm sorry. I wish I could say something to make it better. Do you want me to take the locket? It's my turn."
"Unless you want to hang out with them." Draco's jealousy ripped inside him as it always did, but instead he held himself.
"Umbridge. She banned me from quidditch... forever," his voice broke, as he couldn't hold back the tears that formed in his eyes. It sparked a fire inside of Draco.
The sorting had been done, the rules had been explained and the feast had been set., but Draco hadn't payed attention to any of it. Something had just been missing. A whole In his heart was as empty as a Gringotts vault owned by a man in poverty, yet, he didn't know why and it was biting at him.
Harry bit his lip and looked down at him. Then he leant down and brushed their noses together. "Maybe that's why you Slytherin's can't play fair. You have to be sneaky because you'd lose all the time. Though, you already do lose all the time." Draco couldn't help but laugh, though there was weight behind it. Tension.
"I'll end up dead, anyway. You heard her. I'll probably be dead within the next few days. I've done too much damage to myself. With the time I have left, I want you to be free. Because if I die and we don't break the bond, then your memories will come back. You'll be stuck like this for the rest of your life and no matter how much I despise you right now, I can't let that happen to you. It's my dying wish that you get fixed however you define that. I have a few days left. Get the fucking surgery if that's what you want."
Draco cast a cleaning spell wordlessly. Their breaths were heavy as Draco rolled off of him, but Harry made sure to grab him and pull him so their bodies were together, and Harry cuddled him, digging his face into his chest and wrapping his arm around him, rubbing his back.
"I gave the recipe to a house elf. My mother used to make these. Try it," he egged him on. Harry took a bite, and it was warm and gooey and chocolatey and reminded Harry of Draco.
Draco had never been so red in his life, if fact he was almost purple in spite of it. Harry had completely buried himself in his arms on the table and Draco finally covered his face with his hands.
"Wanted you," Draco said, dragging his fingers along Harry's hips and back under the hem of his shirt. They kissed shortly, however passionately. "Maybe a little of both. You?"
"Of course. Only if I play Weasley," Draco demanded. Ron stared at him, wide-eyed. "As I recall, you aren't an owl, Weasley. Yes, I said you. Harry tells me you're quite the chess player. I want my go at you."
"I forgive you. I mean it." Still, Harry shook his head. "If I could see your heart, I'm sure there would be scars there, too. Of how I hurt you."
"I used Legilimency on Harry Potter, and when I searched his memories, I found some rather interesting ones involving you. To my surprise." Draco thought he was going to vomit on the table. Merlin, which ones? "It's quite funny, but I remember, in particular, several instances that pointed towards a formal, courting relationship with him. Care to elaborate."
"Stupid Pumblechook is not my biggest concern right now, and neither should he be yours. You are sick, and I am here to take care of you."
Yes. "I dunno. Hopefully not." He knew Harry hated that answer. "But I just can't leave her alone." A silence passed. "Are you staying at the Weasley's?"
When the train finally lurched to a stop, and students unloaded the trolley, Draco remained in his seat and Harry smiled in his ear.
Draco untangled them and went to the floor, reaching under his bed. He brought out several boxes, all wrapped in shiny paper, and a final cake stand covered in a dome. He lifted it as Harry sat up, revealing a chocolate birthday cake. It read
"Potter-" Draco cringed. Hearing it was so unnatural, so painful. Because he couldn't possibly be loved.
Harry frowned, ashamed. "I don't remember. Maybe the morning after the hospital stay." So three days. "I'm sorry."
"That's not enough," Draco said. "Don't you get it. Nothing is a good enough excuse for this. I'm a coward."
When he finally cleared them, two kids stood in front of him. Draco furrowed his eyebrows, initially confused. "Hello?"
Bellatrix looked bloodthirsty. "Now, if this isn't who we think it is and we call him, he'll kill us all. We have to be absolutely sure."
"STOP CALLING ME THAT!" Draco let out an aggravated groan. The entire class had been causing him to have a headache. He opened the door to reveal Harry leaning against the frame. "I hate you."
Harry climbed onto the bed and Draco followed suit. They were close enough to feel each other's energy, but not their touch. "So I was truthful on my evaluation form instead of lying since that's what I did when I went to St. Mungo's, and, er, I'm really fucked up." Though he ended the sentence with a laugh. "Surprise, surprise."
"Yes. I am going to put you in Azkaban. Because that's where Death Eaters belong. Because my parents deserve every Death Eater off the streets. And if I can't put you there, you're going to put yourself there."
"Yeah." Their noses brushed, and Potter opened his eyes. "I can't believe that you make me feel this way." Draco's face fell slightly. "In a good way. I mean... we've been enemies for years. If someone told me in First Year that we'd even sit this close to each other..."
"That's okay," Dr. Barmer said. "Usually, the memories before your incident are the ones you remember last. They should appear in a few days."
"They told me how brave I was to bring him back, Cedric," he swallowed, "But I didn't consider it that brave. It made me feel, sort of, unwanted I guess. If I didn't participate, he wouldn't of died. And-"
Draco backed up a bit so he could look at Harry in the eye. God, his face. Harry was gorgeous, truly, but sick. So sick. The skin around his eyes was dark, and his forehead had wrinkles from stress, crowsfeet, and worry lines. Tears ran down his face, his cheeks puffy and red and pale and
Draco paused and smiled. "You're right, we do." He pecked his lips. "Wait, we did have that fight before holiday about how much you hate my father."
Silence took over the stadium, hearts beating for the champion to return to the arena, but neither Cedric nor Harry appeared. Draco's mouth went dry and the blood pumping in his vains stopped. Where's Harry?
"It doesn't matter if it was my fault or not. I helped form it. Because of me, everyone in that room is going to have this." He held up his fist and pointed at the scar on the top of his hand.
There was a certain magic under his skin, and to the Dark Lord, it was the greatest currency in the world. Thousands of Death Eaters would kill to be so close to him, to spend a moment with Harry—it was oddly obsessive. And Draco got to sit next to him in his bedroom. Kiss him. Touch him. Harry was interested in him, wanted him. Allowed him to. Felt safe with him.
"What were you saying," Draco breathed hotly in his ear and Harry visibly shivered. Draco went up to kiss him again and Harry's head cleared a bit only to realize what his main objective was. Harry pushed Draco off of him- although he was having an excellent time- and went for the furniture. Draco, a little slow due to the fact that he thought Harry was flipping them, finally recoiled and as Harry knelt next to the drawer, about to open it, he grabbed him by his waist and threw him away from it. "Harry!"
Draco didn't realize he let out a whimper, and that Harry was staring at him with a smirk. And that's what brought him back to reality. There was an open pot with pink liquid oozing from the top, air above it swirling in a magenta tornado.
Last night, I was informed that Lucius passed away in askaban yesterday. I was told that it was due to starvation, and he went one of the luckier ways, and I guess I agree with that."
Draco nodded. "It's just so nice to talk to someone about it. To talk to you. B-Because I was always so scared of how disgusted you would be of me."
Then Potter started laughing. It was so weird being so near to such a thing, someone laughing happily. "Snape had to teach you to dance."
Draco scoffed, rolled his eyes, and rushed out of the room, Harry ready to follow, but Hermione flung herself from the table and stepped in front of him before he reached the door, though she couldn't keep Harry's eyes from watching him leave.
"Merlin, Harry! You could have give me a bit of a warning," he clutched his chest in attempts to calm his jump-started heart. "And possibly a heart attack."
"What about him? He's right here," Draco squeezed him. Seamus just furrowed his eyebrows. "Oh you mean my other one? She doesn't know. No one does. So what that means, Finnegan is that, yes I guess your intelligence is within average range, however tell anyone, we'll kill you."
"Harry stop it." He kept kissing him. And Draco couldn't deny he wanted more but these OWLS were important to him. "Harry, go away." He lied. He never wanted Harry to leave. "Harry stop, please. Harry... Harry...
"I guess if it's with the savior of the Wizarding World, how can I be angry about you two... getting to know each other in such an intimate way, which is usually saved for the wedded couple?" Narcissa blinked, though there was a small hint of a smile, and a larger hint of
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and took his hand, guiding him to their usual broom closet for safe solitude. The hallway, due to their hidden nature, seemed to expose them.
"It's up to him. He won't leave his bed, he always tells us to go away. He won't talk to anyone about anything. He wants to be alone." She paused. "But then again, he always said that on Fridays, when you two hang out. His definition of 'alone' might be different than mine."
"I'm cute all the time!" Draco tried pulling him up a bit. Harry wasn't heavy, but angle wasn't good to pull him. Draco was already laying on the broom, trying his best not to fall over too. His arm stretched and his shoulder started to burn. "Did you plan on helping at all or are you in a some dream where you think you're invincible?"
and he lived. Harry Potter doesn't—he can't!" Draco stood and paced. "This is a nightmare. This isn't real. It's not... There's no way."
"Wow ferret, I'm pretty sure that Moaning Myrtle could do better than that!" Ron butt in giving Harry a second to mouth to Draco come on, stop being afraid. Draco just stood there like a deer in headlights, when Harry finally pushed him.
Draco swallowed. "I made people do silly things just to control them. I made them say mean things to the people they loved. I made them say things that would make the Death Eater's angry so they would then retaliate. I would make them destroy their favorite things. Twice I made someone hex their loved one. In the context of Katie Bell, I had her take the cursed necklace to Dumbledore, though that failed, and she touched it herself."
“Welcome, family, friends and loved ones,” Kingsley boomed, signaling that he was going to do this damned ceremony if people were listening or not, “We gather here today to celebrate the wedding of Harry and Draco. You have come here to share in this formal commitment they make to one another, to offer your love and support to this union, and to allow Harry and Draco to start their married life together surrounded by the people dearest and most important to them. They thank you for your presence and ask for your encouragement and life-long support in their decision to be married.”
“He’s helping them all cause more mischief than they did when than they were alive,” Lily groaned with her head in her hands. “It’s driving me crazy.”
I mean, on Fridays we'd skip dinner and meet up in the Forbidden Forest, but that was one day a week. We'd find a broom closet or an empty alcove to talk if anything we had was dire, and if we ever got caught we'd play it off like we were fighting. It was frustrating.
He stopped in the center if the room, taking a deep breath. "I am incredibly excited to educate you students. To start off with: rules. Erm, no talking while I am, respect others, and you probably already can guess the rest, you all are far too old. I'm sure you will all be pleasant, and I look forward to teaching you.
They continued up the stairs. When they reached Sirius's room, Draco said, "I had a great time. Thank you for letting me come. Thank you for getting me out of the Manor. I was drowning there."
"We just work well, very well, together. I don't know if it's chemistry, or if it's just compatibility, or just us being blind fools, but... I don't know how to say this," he bit his lip, "It's simple because we make it simple, and dragging friends into it would just be complicated. We don't want that now. There's a spark that I hadn't anticipated but it's there, even after four months. We're trying things out and if it all burns down in flames, let it. But for now I want to keep this between me and he-her Can you respect that?"
Harry looked up at him, a nasty look on his face. "That's rich coming from you, considering you didn't know anything for the past five months. You were literally degrading and laughed at my face when I tried to point it out at you."
Draco took another deep breath before they met the other Weasleys outside. Ron, Ginny, George, Charlie, and Arthur were all on brooms, though Arthur hovered close to the ground. Ginny and Ron were at the forefront of it, though it looked like Ginny was winning.
He crawled for his wand, but it was so far from him. She smirked down at him. "Potter lovers always get what they deser—"
Harry looked at him, and then did so, as if his brain had slowed down and he was comprehending the echoes. Draco unbuckled and unzipped his pants, throwing them to the side. He took several blankets and put them over him, using a heating charm, and Harry looked at the ceiling.
"It reminds me of not being with you. It's torture. Who could ever separate people who are completely in love like this?"
“We’ve had sex how many times,” Harry asked, and kissed his length, and licked the tip of it, which leaked with precome.
"It's possible," Hermione contemplated, trying to get Neville off track, "but not very likely. If anything, someone who needed help, rather a friend."
"Because I promised you I would," Harry said. He honestly forgot that Draco forgot. He felt like he was in another fight with him, something they could buffer out.
“Then what is it Harry,” Draco retorted. “Please tell me I’m not obligated to caring for my sou- boyfriend.”
"Don't care, it was our last shot," Draco mumbled into his neck, kissing up to just below his ear. "If they don't like us now, they never will, and besides, who cares."
"I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done any of it," Draco said. "Well, we learned what happens when we don't plan out a fight."
"'Where are They Now: War Hero Edition. While Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger immediately contribute to the Wizarding World, becoming an auror and the latter filing into the Magical Justice Department, the star hero, Harry Potter takes a few years off from any duty whatsoever and finds himself in morbid embarrassment in attempt to slow dance in front of muggles,'" Draco laughed.
"Draco," the desperate whisper broke the night, and Draco couldn't take it. He removed his hand and rolled on top of him, staggering his hips. Their bulges were pressed together, begging to stay like this.
They weren't on vacation. They weren't living their best lives, stowed away from the bad world. They were fucking dead. Before they died, they were in pain. They were taunted and tortured by the cruelty of the world.
"Don't," Draco said. "We don't have to kiss all the time. We're taking things slow." Again, Harry snorted. "
"We bring to the stand, Draco Lucius Malfoy whom is accused of the murder of Albus Dumbledore, housing multiple Death Eaters within the confines of his residence, and performing practices against the benefit of the Wizarding World, along with bearing the infamous Dark Mark as a minor," Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt read from the parchment that lay in front of him. "Now that there are no witnesses-"
"It's not that type of pain, Draco," Harry reached out and smoothed Draco's damp hair out of his face, admiring it. Harry moved his other hand over his chest and Draco watched him. "Here. It hurt's a lot here. It feels... strange. Like we're... like we're connected." His eyes watered at the thought of their previous times.  "I don't want you to-"
"Draco," Harry whispered involuntarily. It hurt so bad, looking at the sight in front of him, remembering the exact joke they were laughing at. It was Trelawny, Friday the 13th: the very beginning that started two years of complete, laughable bliss.
"You were in on this too! He's going to hurt us! He's going to kill us! How could you dad?" She grabbed Scorpius's arm and ran, only to have Draco chase after her.
“Are you kidding me Harry? I’d give her a four just because of the make up, a three because she’s slept with every guy in her year, and a two because she doesn’t have an arse.”
"You don't know what it was like during the war, Lily, you don't know what either of us have been through. He didn't have a choice."
She placed a hand on his cheek where it was bruised and he held in the pain it was bringing him. “What happened?”
Harry finally had the strength to get up and sit next to him. Draco just gave him a death glare. "What?"
“Shhh! We have until October,” Harry dived into Draco’s neck, kissing it. Draco shut his eyes and relaxed.
He closed his mouth, having to let go of any newfound rage that formed at learning of her betrayal. He was taught how to do it from Potter. "How did you know?"
"Yes, he's your soulmate who has been traumatized, and has an extremely damaged heart. We need to start feeding him, we need to get his health stable until he is capable of meeting with you."
"Yes. They're your damaged memories. It looks like you had two different types of memory spells cast on you at the same time. One ended abruptly because of the other, and it damaged all parts of your memory."
"I wish there was some book on what to do after a war. I feel guilty for not... not falling apart but... I've just been miserable for so long."
And they grew close again, though they knew it was a bad idea. They shouldn't be doing this, given the risks, but it was sometimes the only thing that got them out of bed in the mornings. Being able to see each other in the ways they could.
"I let you do this too long. I'm sorry. I was selfish. I just needed a friend. I shouldn't have found it in you."
"I will," Harry smiled, but not at their kindness and (somewhat) respect of privacy (hey, at least they weren't begging for a name or house); he smiled at the fact that he wouldn't be needing any girl advice whatsoever.
And then they all said simultaneously, “And you like your sandwich toasted with ham and swiss cheese, light mayonnaise, and two slices of tomato.”
Draco did what he had to do. This was why he didn't off himself. This was why he put up with everything he had. This was the light that got him through the road of hell.
"It best you do well tomorrow, Potter the second task might be worst than the first one," the teacher warned before telling the class they were dismissed. Harry completely forgot about the second task the next day. He had been studying so much that his brain was malfunctioning, and of course, revenge on Malfoy was always fun.
Draco melted at the way he said it, and he stroked behind his ear to calm him down again. "You don't need them."
That was what helped the most. He felt he could get a grip on the darkness and his rage after a few weeks of healing, deep sleep.
"Merlin, Harry. You could have given me a bit of warning!" He clutched his chest. "And possibly a heart attack."
"It's the longest we've been apart since you lost your memory," Harry said miserably. "Well, the only time we've really been apart for over a day."
With wobbling legs, Harry left to go to the Gryffindor Tower, not being able to comprehend what he had just heard.
“Th-that’s because it’s s-o-o-so cold, so v-very c-c-cold,” Draco tried to speak but only small squeaks came out. Draco paddled his way harshly through the water to Harry, his hair clinging to his skull that reminded the Gryffindor how he used to wear it in first and second year. He looked like a lost, wet dog.
Malfoy looked at him like he was sorry for him. It was the first time that Malfoy had given him any kindness. But still, it felt like he was a stranger.
"I-I don't care about m-me," Draco struggled to talk at the sight of the bag breathing for Harry. It was like it was all fake. Like he was dreaming. "What's w-wrong with Harry?" They didn't say anything initially. "I'm not leaving his side!"
"Pansy!" Once their date ended, Draco sprinted back to his dorm and pounded on her door with his fist.
"What, I know I'm sorry, it's just I haven't seen you in so long, and I don't wanna kiss you because there could be cameras or someone could walk in," he said rushed. Harry was shaking and so excited. Draco pushed him away and gave Harry a look that one would give to a three headed scorpion.
Instead of getting mad, Draco took a deep, shaky breath. "Harry, you won't see me on the train in September if you forget to eat because you won't be here. This isn't negotiable. Absolutely nonnegotiable."
They boy didn't even open his eyes, rather, he just grunted. "Harry," his voice cracked. "What is it?"
“I know,” Harry leant his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Speaking of shallow, how do you think Pumblechook took the news?”
Andromeda frowned. "Initially. The first set of letters was about that. But then it changed. There were a few panicked ones. What happens when my soulmate doesn't like me?"
In an attempt to take his mind off of it, Harry looked around the room, a glowing, shiny object catching his eye. The silver disk oh so familiar from last year floated in the corner of the room.
"Try me," Harry smiled, kissing his neck, and despite his efforts to keep composure, Draco found himself melting to his touch.
"Shh, Harry," he kissed his forehead again. "I'll be here tomorrow. We can go to the forest and hug all we want."
"Then suck it up and handle it better. I couldn't handle seeing you every single day, not remember me. And now I have to worry about you all the time, worry about you being taken from me again and again and again. I get to stay on this Ferris wheel of misery again and again, because that's what being with you is like."
Fuck. That did nothing. That helped nothing. Because Harry would have to know they were soulmates for the bond to break. Or, to get to the point he would break it, he would have to make Harry hate him first, and then Draco himself would have to purely hate Harry.
But it was still difficult. His stomach cramped because it wasn't used to the food, and he was exhausted from digesting it. And, of course, he felt guilty.
“No,” Harry told him. Draco’s face morphed sad. “Relax, I’m kidding, yes you can!” He patted the spot next to him. Draco walked to him, looking absolutely stunning. Harry was breathless. His hair was gelled back, but not too much, just enough to make him stunning. He seemed to be glowing in his suit of black. He fingered his robes were still in his room. “Y-you look incredible.”
“Think about it. Me, the ‘eye candy’ according to you, of the Wizarding World, and baddie Draco Malfoy turns out to be a teddy bear and their both completely in love with each other. Surely girls obsess over things like that and I mean, who could blame them, if I was standing on an outside point of view, it would be like a dream come true- what?” At this point, Draco just stared at him, stopping all listening as he focused on one statement.
The big part was coming up next, and Draco felt as though he swallowed an elephant, since he was going first. He wanted to kiss Harry first, although he kept himself from it.
Harry turned to Draco and just had the biggest smile on his face. "They said thank you for taking care of me."
He swallowed and spent most of the night trying to avoid the thoughts, memories, and dreams as much as possible. Draco regretted not taking the kiss. Probably if he would've kissed him, he would've been able to sleep.
Harry moved to the middle of his chest, except instead of a hand, two fingers found themselves on the start of Draco's scars. "T-This was the worst d-day of my life," he choked. "I'm so sorry."
They were only in that state for a matter of seconds when they heard people from the opposing hallway and they broke apart completely. It was Harry's followers, of course. Peasants.
Draco looked at Harry once he realized where they were. Harry wrapped an arm around Draco's bicep and held it as they walked towards the graveyard.
"What was that?" They both said simultaneously. Draco stepped back behind the barrier and silently begged the two wouldn't check out the noise.
"I was desperate," Harry said. "I just wanted the contract broken. I couldn't see him go back to Azkaban."
Suddenly a wave of courage flowed over him. He wasn't going to die. Period. He's going to be there for him, protect him if he can. He knew what side he was on.
"Actually, it's chocolate," he kissed his cheek and then licked it again. Draco shoved him away and wiped the extra saliva with a napkin.
"Good for me. My mind, my emotions, and my spirit are broken. Everything about me is broken, actually. I have a range of disorders. Would you like one? I have some to spare."
Harry didn't say anything until Draco tilted his head, expecting an answer. "Better than before, but—"
The heavy gavel banged against the mahogany and echoed throughout the hall. Chatter and gossip ceased abruptly and every member of the Wizengamot turned their heads to the center of the room where a body was raised in the chains and brought to the iron cage confining them from the rest of society- like an animal on display at a zoo.
Neville, Dean, and Seamus all took a seat, and so did Draco and Harry, though they tried not to sit too close.
Draco snorted, pulled a face, and rolled his eyes. "Right. Me and Potter together." He faked a gag. "I'd rather kiss a Blast-Ended Skrewt. Besides, I'm engaged to Astoria Greengrass."
He froze completely, and felt the blood rush from his face. He unfolded the paper to see a gigantic picture of him and Draco making out. His eyes widened as he looked up to see every face in the room staring at him with disgust. He turned to Pumblechook, who had the most malicious smirk on his face.
Detention was equally as horrific. They were practically shouted at the entire time and if they spoke, it would cost them a month of scrubbing the room with a toothbrush. And even worse, Draco refused to speak with him, even look at him.
Draco began reading the introductory chapters. The first one was explicitly on consent and what that meant, and dictated how important it was.
"Because I don't think it's right for us to do. I mean I don't... I dunno if I'm ready to go all the way."
Draco swallowed, the need to scratch his left arm itching at him. "Are we still on for after dinner," he rushed, putting his arm behind him.
"I never wanted this to happen," Harry cried, "Never. I never wanted to have my parents be killed. I never wanted to move in with my aunt and uncle. I never wanted to burn off Quirrell's face. I never wanted I kill Basilisk, or even talk one for that matter. I never wanted to be put in this Devil Tournament."
“I want you to marry me, Draco Malfoy. I want to annoy you until you can’t bloody see anymore. I want to piss you off every single day until I die, and I want to wake up next to you every single morning because I am in love with you and I cannot physically see my future with out you. For the past five months, let’s face it, I’ve gone practically insane. That might have to do with years of abuse at the Dursleys crashing down on me; that might be because I’ve been running from a killer my entire life and I don’t know what it’s like to not be scared; that might be because I have lost so many people that I just wish I could have saved, and I deal with the guilt every time I breathe and they don’t, but damn it! It’s because of my stupid boyfriend that is so hard to get a hold of.
"When the mentor you've looked up to since you were eleven years old grooms you to hate your life to the point you willingly want to sacrifice yourself... yeah. That sums it up. It's like he made my life miserable, this whole situation miserable, and I didn't die and it's like I'm still stuck in this miserable life and I lost you. I just don't see how it's not going to stop being miserable. When I was supposed to be happy, I became even more miserable. It feels like life is just pushing me out and I wanted to beat it to the punch."
