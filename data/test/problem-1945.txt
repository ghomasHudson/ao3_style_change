back at me. I snickered quietly as he slid the page between two pages of his textbook. Soon after, the bell finally tolled and we began packing our things back into our bags.
As I propped myself up on my elbows, I was suddenly distracted with how good he looked between my legs. My face must've betrayed my appreciation, because Harry frowned at me.
Whatever had passed between Harry and McGonagall had clearly set him off, but I was the last person to pry into other peoples' emotions, so I simply followed him in silence.
he barely uttered, a pleased pink creeping into his cheeks. I pressed my lips together and tore my gaze from his face back to my work.
‘Harry’ he began his reply, casting a sharp glance up at me. ‘You ACCIDENTALLY Legillimens me in my sleep. You should give yourself more credit’
Harry beamed at me, but suddenly, behind him, one Dementor had taken an interest in us. Seeing the fear on my face, he whipped back around and drew his wand.
The muscles in Draco's face fell completely slack. I gnawed my lip anxiously as I awaited his response, but his reaction told me enough, if I was honest. His mouth clicked closed, but he just stared at me silently. I braced myself for his walls to come up, for his defense mechanism to kick in, for the rage I'd expected from the beginning, but he was just… Quiet. When he finally spoke, it was barely a whisper.
I hadn't expected no response from everyone else in our year. To be quite frank, I had expected a load of blow-back. Seamus in my ear, saying
It was Rodolfo, of all people. I froze. Harry cast a curious glance back at him, gesturing for him to enter.
He'd fallen asleep in what couldn't have been a comfortable position, but seeing him so serene was a surprise. His only movement was the subtle rise and fall of his chest.
Warmth spread through my cheeks as I stared down at my hands in my lap. A strange frustration knit my brow, and I realized I was annoyed that I wasn't angrier. Harry's persistence ticked me off, but I wanted to be irritated enough to tell him to fuck off. I found that I just couldn't do it.
"Suppose just being with me is enough to ward off any bullies?" I asked as I turned back to Hermione, who shrugged.
"Sure, darling. I will have Winky get you when he has arrived." Narcissa thought about what could possibly be haunting her son. Though she knew he liked Mr. Potter more than he liked to admit to himself or anyone for that matter.
After what seemed like an eternity, Draco observed Harry. "Potter, I mean Harry, does this mean we are friends now?" He asked nervously.
Draco folded the letter and placed it into an envelope. He handed it to the owl and she gently grabbed it with her beak. When the letter was secured, she flew away.
The salesperson chuckled softly. “I think I have the perfect collection that includes those things you said. Just give me a moment while I collect the items.” She walked away.
When everyone landed back in Grimmauld Place, Harry called for Kreacher. “Master Harry, what do you need?”
Harry casted a tempus charm and was astonished at how late it had become. "Ohh my you're right. Wow I've been here for hours. But it didn't feel like it at all. Time flies when you're having fun, I suppose. Don't worry about my friends regarding my time with you. When I left the Weasleys, none of them were worried knowing I was coming for afternoon tea. Believe it or not."
Severus opened the letter and he smiled. Hermione wanted him to come to Grimmauld Place and have tea with her. He promptly responded with a yes. He left his laboratory to look presentable to Hermione, the witch who was stealing his heart. He never thought he would ever love someone like he did Lily but he was proven wrong when the brightest witch of her age waltzed back into his life. He could not deny that he was falling in love but this time it seemed the object of his affection felt the same way as he.
Draco nodded in understanding. "You like me too? I never in my wildest dreams I would have thought this was ever true. And it makes sense we let our friends get used to us getting along and see that we can be friends. I am not upset by your idea of being just friends for awhile. Surprisingly I agree. It would be just weird that we are suddenly dating after despising each other for the last seven years. It is better to ease them into the idea of us being together." He blushed again thinking about dating the great Saviour, Harry Potter.
Hermione took his hand and squeezed reassuringly. “Of course I want to marry you someday. When I was still with Ron, I never thought of taking his last name but with you it feels right. I would be honoured to be Hermione Snape. This is most certainly not a rash decision. I am the clearest I have ever been in my life. There is no doubt in my mind that I want to be tied to you forever.” She said with such conviction.
Severus was in deep thought. "Thank you for looking into the spell. I appreciate it. At least I know how he performed the spell. I still do not understand why he would want to bring me back though." He sighed.
Harry reluctantly got off the sofa. “Let’s freshen up.” He slowly walked out of the room and Draco followed.
Hermione smirked. “It is simple. Magic.” She said cheekily. “And as for when I would like to move in with you, anytime would be good. I would have to discuss it with my parents but I know they will support my decision.”
Minnie walked over to her floo and opened it so Hermione could come right through without announcing herself first.
Harry gave him a contented sigh. “Good night, love.” He murmured as pulled Draco impossibly closer to him.
Hermione looked like she could kill someone. “James, you have no room to talk! You have not been here for all of Harry’s life! How dare you for judging someone falling in love with someone different when you do not what awful shit Harry has been through. You were not here to raise him! Your wife’s side of family treated him like a fucking house elf! He did not know he was a wizard until he was eleven years old! Sadly, he never knew kindness until getting to Hogwarts. The Weasleys helped to raise him and showed him the love he deserved. Draco and Narcissa too for that matter! Narcissa lied to Voldemort’s face about Harry being alive. It gave our side an advantage. Draco lied to Bellatrix about recognising Harry when we were captured. Severus became Dumbledore’s double agent. His love for your wife won out in the end by doing his best to keep Harry safe without compromising his position as a spy! So do not attack Severus, Draco or Narcissa. Yes they have made terrible choices but all three eventually changed and did the right thing. I think we can all agree we are all guilty of making bad decisions.” She looked at everyone thoughtfully. “Besides I doubt Harry would have fallen in love with Draco if he had not changed into a better version of himself. Harry can be daft but not that daft for crying out loud! And I never would have given Severus a chance if I did not think he was a good person.” She took Severus’ hand and squeezed it. “James you need to get over your prejudice or you will lose a chance to know your son. Are you really that selfish? How very Lucius like. He disowned Draco for choosing Harry and for being gay. Narcissa has been nothing but loving and supportive, as surprising as that is for you to understand. The question is, do you want to squander your second chance or actually be a father and love your son no matter what? It is your choice. Though, I doubt your wife will want to give up being in her son’s life so you would lose them both. Personally, I think there has been enough conflict for many lifetimes. Harry deserves peace. We all do. Do you not agree?” She gave him a steer look.
Blaise could not hold in his laughter anymore. “Bloody hell! I do not think I have had this much entertainment since before Voldemort was resurrected. It is never a dull moment when there are Gryffindors around. And Hermione it is a pleasure to have you in exclusive snake club.” He also winked at Hermione.
As embarrassed as I was, I couldn't deny I was intensely curious to know who could've deflowered Draco. Thankfully, his teasing finally ended as his face turned bright red. He looked down at his lap.
As we were packing up our things and making neat stacks of the books we'd checked out, I realized where we were headed next. Draco must've already arrived at that realization, because his face (usually so pink around the cheeks and ears) was blanched.
I growled internally at the hypocrisy of not wanting to be labelled a hero and yet occasionally pulling the hero card. Sure, I still had the same common sense of any 18-year-old, but I killed Voldemort for chrissake! That didn't count for nothing.
'Not necessarily. I wish she'd worry about herself, though. I worry she's avoiding her own well-being with mine.'
I glanced back at his grin, and once again, the sight of him naked and reclining nearly stopped my heart.
If I was honest with myself, I had been a little afraid I'd lose friends over this. But now, I realized that was silly. I knew my friends better than that, and they wouldn't see me any differently for something this petty. Anything anyone else had to throw at us, let them.
She eyed my outstretched hand warily as she sniffed. She wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her robe before hesitantly reaching her hand back toward mine. Once I’d clasped it, I hoisted her to her feet.
The swiftness with which his quill came down to reply to me was encouraging, but I still anxiously awaited his response.
As he came to face me again, he slowly approached me, took my hand, and pressed my palm to the most prominent scar across his chest.
"I'd like to ask you a favor, Harry." I was shocked to hear her use my first name, but realized whatever she was about to ask was important.
"Gonna have to have the talk with the lads at some point, though," Ron continued through a mouthful of food. I grimaced.
A pale peach was creeping into the sky when I opened my eyes. Draco’s evenly breathing chest was pressed to my back, with one arm slung over my waist. In the brief moments before he joined me in consciousness, I snuggled back into him, cherishing the warmth and comfort. Whether it was this movement or nature, he stirred, groaning against the back of my neck.
Draco's steps faltered, but he pressed on until we were walking into Charms together. He awkwardly tried to maneuver to a secluded desk, but I followed to sit next to him, ignoring the curious stares I got for it. He was purposefully not looking at me, and the ungodly pink in his cheeks made me want to press him, but I left him alone.
A flush stole into my cheeks as I entertained the unlikelihood that he felt the same way about me as I did about him.
As I smugly slid this message back onto his desk, I settled my chin back into my palm and glimpsed his red face out of the corner of my eye. Instead of writing back, he muttered
My dorm was just a hallway, a staircase, and another hallway away, but as I was turning the corner from the top of the stairs onto my floor, a ruffled-looking Hermione was returning to her own room.
Draco swallowed and ducked his head to watch his fingers tug at his sleeve. He sat, lost in thought, as the sorting ceremony commenced.
It was probably just because of the obstruction of the bandages themselves, but part of me wondered if I'd just had fewer reasons to be anxious lately?
"I assumed we'd just have some of the herbs we'll be talking about as visual aids and just talk about what we've learned about antidotes."
Once showered, shaved, and clothed, I left my dorm with my book bag slung across my body. It was quite a bit later than I'd
"You know, I could really see you and her becoming good friends. She's a great listener, and annoyingly perceptive, maybe a bit of a busybody but she means well."
" I commented. With bright red cheeks and a resolute expression, he began unwinding the bandages around his hand, which I saw extended up his forearm. As they fell to the floor, I understood.
My saliva dripped down to wet my fingers, and I sought a goal even further down. He seemed to tense as my moistened appendages slid between his cheeks, but his '
'Blood' that is the only thing I think as I dragged a small razor against my wrists. Well, that and the fact that I was invited to go back to Hogwarts for an 8th year. At first, I burned the letter and acted like I never got it, but then more letters came. But then, my mother saw the letters and she begged me to go, so that I would be away from my father.
"RONALD!" She scowled. Alex gave him a sad smile and said, "Draco has been through a lot.. more than you could ever imagine. You guys should try to get along." With that she left. Hermione looked at Harry and Ron. "She is right you know. We should talk to Mal-Draco and get along better." she said "I ran into Pansy while in Dragon Alley. She is really nice when you get to know her." Hermione said looking at Ginny, then blushing slightly. (Should Pansmione be a thing or not?)
I sit up on the cold cobblestone floor in the boy's bathroom. Everyone was still in the dining hall enjoying the first meal of the year. Me on the other hand, I was throwing up the little food I ate like the useless fat death-eater I am. I was suddenly grabbed by the collar and dragged upwards, coming face to face with a tall, muscular ravenclaw boy, behind the boy were two hufflepuffs. One girl with purple hair dyed from the roots, and a boy with blonde hair. The boy looked nervous, while the girl was smirking at me.
There will be ABUSE,RAPE, AND OTHER TRIGGERING SUBJECTS, SO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! I also need to remind you that I do not own anything in this fanfic other than Alex and other characters I chose to add, and I also am tErRiBLe at writing... so I apologize.enjoy!
Several times throughout the monotonous transfiguration class, I caught myself scratching at my bandages.
‘You came back to school’ he began. I rolled my eyes at this, but he continued. ‘You held the most powerful wizard of our age at wand-point’ This, I winced at. ‘You survived living with Lucius, you survived living with Riddle, you lied to Bellatrix’s face, you risked your life for me, you apologized, you owled your mum, you’ Here, I reached over to still his hand. My heart couldn’t take another word as his paragraph of text slowly disappeared. Before I could think of a reply, his hand started moving again under mine. ‘You should give yourself more credit’ was his final, messy inscription before he passed the note back to me.
"Maybe… But if I hadn't… W-what would you… Want from me?" His fingers trailing my scars inched downward, and I turned my gaze toward him. When his eyes raised to meet mine, I swallowed.
"I find it hard to believe myself." His humor suddenly sobered as his cheeks flamed. He dropped his gaze to his lap and continued quietly, "Having you beside me… Emboldens me, somehow."
First with one eye, and then both, he peered up at me. As my eyes locked with his, I took the opportunity to
Sure, I knew him as Scarhead, the Boy Who Lived, Saint Potter, but what about his childhood? What kind of environment shaped him? What were his nightmares about?
Draco lifted his head to offer me a curious expression, and my cheeks warmed as I realized what I'd just implied. Instead of shying away this time, though, I quirked my eyebrow back at him.
"I've… Never really had much game… I guess…" Memories of the nightmare that was finding a date to the Yule Ball resurfaced, and I winced.
"I get it. Bullying the bullies perpetuates the cycle, the healing process has supposedly begun, I heard your speech. But
"That's dark," but neither of us stopped laughing for a few moments. "Not nearly as dark as my dreams usually are, though… This is very strange for me. Is it really so tame just because
My lungs expanded to their capacity, and I couldn't exhale. A few kisses were pressed to the insides of my thighs, and just when I thought the anticipation would kill me, he finally took me in his mouth. Suddenly, I
"Well, you don't have to consider me your problem. I don't know who asked you to reach out to me, or why you're even doing it, for that matter, but I give you full permission to leave it. I'm fine on my own."
"Too bad you're not on the Wizengamot. I'm sure they'd be very interested to hear the opinions of two teenage wizards."
His shitty handwriting was WAY worse when he was writing so quickly. I struggled to make out what he'd penned before it disappeared.
"Oh. You can't?" He shook his head. "Ah… Well… Probably? I mean, wouldn't you rather ask a professor?"
Hermione pretended to be hurt as I turned back around to my dresser, this time withdrawing a tie that I fumblingly tied around my neck (as always).
As we exited our compartment and made our way toward the door, Hogwarts came into view. The entire train was now empty except for us.
My arms hooked under his knees, forcing his legs further back, and I saw stars. Harry's back arched, and I couldn't help but climax. What I could only classify as a glorious, three-part scream nearly deafened my left ear as I came inside him.
No sooner had these words left my lips than several Dementors flooded the hallway, dragging my screaming father back to hell. I actually
He pressed on, nearly jogging down the corridor until he turned a corner and descended the stairs into the courtyard. I trailed behind him, feeling an increasing sense of panic.
already have. The only game you lost was because you were attacked by a Dementor. They don’t make the regular team members tryout again every year.”
‘You’ve really thought this through I see’ Harry’s darkening cheeks spread pleasure throughout my nervous system. Before sending the note back to him, though, I continued. ‘And you call ME insatiable’
apologize." I calmly informed them as I took a bite of chicken. A certain smug satisfaction glowed in my chest at the shock now evident on everyone's faces. I wanted them all to feel the shock I had felt, and…
He stared down at the blank sheet, twiddling his quill between his fingers for a long moment. His quill lowered to the surface twice before he finally wrote back and returned the note to me.
Thank god, Hermione and Ron were next. She, of course, did most of the talking about how planting certain herbs in different types of soil affected the herb’s usefulness. They’d even done their own experiments, and presented several potted plants to the class.
"Draco!" He came to kneel before me, prying my right hand from my left wrist to pull up my sleeve. "Just breathe, this isn't real, he can't hurt us."
He hadn't just scraped his palm that first day. There were months-old scars, as well as fresh scratches concentrated over his Dark Mark. Self-inflicted, if I had to guess. As he rotated, his matching back scars were exposed to me. His entire torso was
"Do you clean this room every day?" It looked like a hotel room, I could hardly believe anyone lived in it. Draco sat on the edge of his bed as he watched me.
“‘S fine,” he assured me as he blinked up at me. Upon further inspection, it did seem like he was fine, and I breathed a sigh of relief.
When Harry didn't respond, I clicked my tongue and grabbed his hand. He didn't resist as I started walking toward the Herbology classroom.
A mental sensation similar to being woken up from napping on a desk by a large book being dropped on said desk made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.
"M-my parents… Said they were proud of me… And I asked if dying hurt, and… Sirius said it was like falling asleep. I guess he was just trying to encourage me, because I quickly discovered what a lie that was. Still, prophecies are no joke. Everything happened exactly as it was predicted."
"I know." With a grimace, I forced as much of the pink fluid down my throat as I could manage. I was beginning to feel quite light, and my inhibitions lowered significantly. "We should get to bed soon."
We walked in silence together to the Astronomy tower, and I had to slow my pace exponentially to keep stride with him as we approached. We were bringing up the trailing end of the class, so no one saw when he paused outside the stairwell. I waited with him in silence as he mustered his courage.
"I wonder if there's something here we're meant to find?" Harry wondered aloud as he dropped my hand and headed toward the changing staircases ahead of me.
“Your friends already know, why hide it?” As he pulled his shirt back over his head, he continued. “In fact, why even hide your neck at this point?”
"I really don't know. We haven't been… Communicating much since the war ended. I think she's… Lonely."
I rolled my eyes as I went to my wardrobe to pick out my robes for the day. Turning my back to her, I resigned myself with another sigh.
"Mister Malfoy?" I couldn't contain my wince, but right as I was about to launch into an apology, a silent voice spoke into my mind,
"Shut up," I retorted as I shoved my hot face into the empty pillow next to Draco's. With a chuckle, his fingers touched my bare back, stroking up and down the length of my spine. Despite the initial shiver this contact caused, it was very calming. I could almost fall back asleep, but then he leaned over and pressed a kiss to my shoulder.
Draco's hand carefully reached onto my desk and stole back the journal page, interrupting my internal monologue.
?" He gave a shaky laugh as a tear streaked down his cheek. "Speaking from experience, fretting about
Severus chuckled. “I am glad you contacted Molly and I am sure she will set him straight if she has not already. She can be quite frightening when she is angry.”
Before anyone else could say anything, Draco collapsed into a heap on the floor and started sobbing uncontrollably. Harry dropped to the floor and manoeuvred Draco’s head onto his lap. He started to soothe him by caressing his hair.
Harry held his boyfriend. “Dray? Love, please look at me.” He pleaded as pulled away and wiped the tears from Draco’s cheeks.
Draco really liked holding Harry's hand. Very soft and gentle Harry's hand was. He never wanted to let go. Ugh again with ogling Harry and having inappropriate thoughts about his Saviour.
Lucius sneered at his son and started to rage. “You, perverted deviant! You are no son of mine! I can not even look at you! I am ashamed to know you are of my blood! Get away from me!” He yelled and the guard was about to come for him but Harry held his hand up and the guard stayed put. Draco had tears going down his cheeks due to his father’s words and Harry wiped the tears away.
When Harry awoke the next morning, he was being pecked by none other than the Weasley's owl Errol. He tried and failed to push the owl away. It just kept pecking him and staring at him. It was quite unnerving.
Hermione gave him a knowing smile like she knew he was holding something back but thankfully she did not say anything.
Hermione laughed lightly. “Way to ruin the lovely, romantic moment, you soppy git!” She teased. “I quite like the softer side of prickly Professor Severus Snape.” She smirked.
Severus looked at her. "Minnie, I am not sure I am suited to continue as a professor any longer. The sole purpose of my post here was to be a double agent. Now that Voldemort has been wiped from existence, I see no reason to continue the charade. Plus, I know for a fact that three quarters of my students despised me for the most part. I think it best for all involved that I retire from teaching." He smirked at his former students.
Pansy scuffed at the exchange. “Sucking up to our Golden Boy already, Blaise? Is that really necessary?” She sneered at Harry.
Harry nervously gulped looking at Snape and Narcissa. "I, umm, thought after Draco had some nightmares, it was best if he didn't sleep alone. I was worried he may have more if he didn't feel safe. And thankfully he didn't have any more nightmares last night so my idea worked."
Draco nodded and sighed. "Of course you are right yet again. Harry has never cared for the press or their impression of him. I just want him to get hurt because of me. It would not seem right for him to get punished for my past." He looked down sadly.
When Draco and Severus arrived back at Malfoy Manor after flooing into Hogsmeade and apparating to the manor's gate, Severus looked at Draco. "Well, I am pleased to be among the living as Minnie put it. I can finally live a life I had dreamed of." He smiled. "And though I am astonished that you and the Boy Who Lived Twice are together, I am happy for you, Draco." He hugged his godson.
Harry blushed a smidge. “You didn’t forget because we weren’t planning to visit but earlier today I proposed to Draco.” He down at his feet. “Ooofff!” Narcissa unexpectedly hugged him.
After Saint Potter defeated Lord Voldemort, the trials began which terrified Draco to no end. He feared that he would end up locked up in Azkaban for the rest of his life. But to his utmost surprise, the great Harry Potter saved Draco and his dear mother. He could not for the life of him figure out why he saved the family from prison. He obsessively tried to solve the mystery that was Harry Potter's brain and he always came up empty.
As Harry returned to the kitchen, Hermione gave him knowing look. "Uhh, Draco I don't know how to say this but it seems that the press are camped out waiting for you to emerge from my home. I'm really sorry. You could use the floo to get back to Manor." He smiled reassuringly at Draco.
Narcissa hugged her son. "Draco darling I think it is best if you stay elsewhere. Perhaps with Harry? After going to Hogwarts and Severus returning, it seems to me that it brought back bad memories and I think it would do you some good to get away for a bit." She smiled softly at her son.
Severus noticed Hermione staring at him and looked at her oddly. "Is there something you want to say to me, Miss Granger?" His eyes bore into her.
Molly looked at him. “Oh nonsense Draco! It’s all in the past. The moment I knew you made our Harry happy, that’s all that truly mattered. Anyone Harry cares for so deeply as he does you, must be good at heart. There is a reason our dear Harry here spoke at your trial and your mother’s. He never thought ill of you. He knew you and your mother were in a difficult situation throughout the return of Voldemort and the subsequent war. So you and Harry have our support with whatever you may need.” She smiled sweetly at Draco.
You may come to the Manor tomorrow at 2. We can have afternoon tea if that is acceptable. Though I can not imagine what property of mine you could possibly have.
The three of them walked to the new jewellery shop, Evermore Trinkets. As they entered the shop, the salesperson greeted them. “Welcome, how can I assist you today?”
Draco was not sure how to respond. "My father was upset I was not into women in general since he wanted to continue the Malfoy name. He always said he did not raise his son to be an abomination. He wanted to force me to marry a woman and have, at least, have one child with her. I guess I should thank you for not helping him during his trial. Otherwise, I would not be able to live my life the way I want to. My mother never took issue with my sexual preferences. She just wanted me to find love and be happy. And it was not Diggory either. Though he is also easy on the eyes." He said at ease.
Harry sighed in relief. “I am very pleased you weren’t alone. Anyway, what was said during this meeting and what does it have to do with me?”
Minnie chuckled. "I suppose you make a good point. Though, it means I have to find professors for both posts which will be a delightful experience I am sure."
Harry filled her in on what happened after she left. Hermione looked positively pleased at what she heard. She hugged Harry tightly. "I am so happy for you both! Truly I am."
Draco started laughing. "Pansy?! She is just my best friend much like Granger to you. She is actually dating Blaise Zabini. And truthfully she is not my type. Well, more like not the gender I am interested in."
Draco sighed "I am guessing even if I refuse you will still make me eat. You are as bad as Mother, Winky." He rolled out of bed. Why did he agree to letting Potter come for tea today?
Severus strolled into the sitting room. “Narcissa, what is with all the commotion?” He looked around and saw the Potters, Sirius and Remus. “Bloody hell! Narcissa, what did you do? Did you take your Gryffindor pill today because you look like you have gone ten rounds with a dementor?! How reckless! This is something I would expect Harry or Weasley to do, not you. What were you thinking? You know how risky blood magic can be. It is bad enough when you bring one person back to life but four? Have you lost your mind?” He sneered at James and Sirius. “And you bring back those two? Do you not recall how they bullied me?” He fumed.
Draco hummed in contentment. “I have a better idea.” He smirked mischievously. He scooted closer to Harry until their noses were inches apart.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco. "Most definitely not rubbish for your information, Malfoy. Some day I'll show you the memory if you need proof your Saviour was almost a Slytherin. You can also ask Hermione as well about my almost snake status. Regarding my ability to speak in Parseltongue, I had become an unknown and unintentional horcrux the night Voldemort murdered my parents which meant I had a part of his soul in me. That's why I had some dark abilities and was able to see into his mind and experience his activities through his eyes in my dreams. It was quite disturbing. And yes I still have the ability to communicate with snakes but that's the only ability that remained. I'm actually glad I retained Parseltongue because I enjoy speaking with snakes. Strange, I know but ever since I frightened my cousin Dudley at the zoo by speaking with a snake, I've come to love the language and snakes."
Hermione looked at him with watery eyes. “Oh, Sev!” She kissed him deeply and after a few minutes she pulled away. “You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that. I love you with all my heart.” She rested her forehead on his.
Hermione looked at him. “I really do wish that with all my heart. I want to make a life with you if you will have me.” She blushed.
A couple of hours had passed since breakfast. In a flurry of excitement, an owl came flying into the sitting room and left a letter. Narcissa recognised the writing. It was Hermione Granger. She smiled to herself, thinking about thrilled she was for Severus. He deserved to find love and one that would reciprocate his feelings. She left the sitting room to give Severus the letter. As she approached his potions laboratory, she softly knocked and heard a faint “come in” from Severus.
Dumbledore's portrait acknowledged their presence first. "Ahh if it is not young Mister Malfoy and Mister Potter. I see you two have put the past behind you. Bravo, boys. What brings you here?" His eyes twinkled as he smiled at both boys very fondly.
Draco shook his head. “Just tell her we will be there so that senile owl leaves. Plus I really do not want to miss Molly tearing into Ron especially after hearing her howler in second year.” He laughed.
Severus decided to share more with her. "You were asking me why I was cruel to you or rather why I was being nice. Honestly, you remind of Lily so much. Your wits, intelligence, your muggleborn status, your personality, how you love research and books and various other aspects of you all make me think of her. Every time I saw you, it brought me back to the days of Hogwarts and how I was bullied by James and his friends. It was one of the lowest parts in my life. After Lily was sorted into Gryffindor, it was the beginning of the end of our friendship. You made me think of her and how she stopped trying to fight for our friendship, though it was partly my fault for doing some pretty awful things and the moment you stepped into my classroom with your know-it-all mentality I took all my frustrations out on you. It was wrong to do so. But it did help with being a double agent. It showed how I treated a muggleborn. Despite being a spy, my attitude towards you was unacceptable. I am sorry for what I put you through. At least I have a second chance to prove I am not the monster society has deemed me to be even if I was always on Dumbledore's side."
Hermione placed her small hands on Severus’ face and looked in him the eye. “Sev, I honestly felt the same when I saw you again. And just so you know I am in love with you too.” She placed soft kisses on his face.
Harry removed his wand from pocket and said "expecto patronum" which produced his stag patronus. It walked up to Harry and bowed its head. "Please find Hermione and tell her to come to Hogwarts and floo into the Headmistress' office immediately." After he relayed the message, the stag bounded out of the office and disappeared.
Harry avoided Draco's gaze by sipping at his last bit of tea. He cleared his throat before speaking again. "I need to tell you something and it's a bit personal but it needs to be said. I told Hermione about our kiss and how it made me feel like fireworks went off in my head. I've never had that incredible feeling before. It was so exhilarating and can't wait for a repeat. Honestly, all of my intense feelings have always involved you whether they were negative or positive. I never thought I could feel so much for one individual. Now I know how my parents felt for each other. Sirius told me a bit about their relationship in the early years. I always thought that kind of love would never happen for me but now I realise I may have been wrong. I'm sorry if I'm getting too serious. I don't want to scare you off. I really can't lose you, Draco." He looked at Draco tenderly.
Hermione had tears in her eyes. "Severus, I am sorry you lost Lily twice. Her friendship and her death. It must have been devastating. I can not imagine what you went through and still are going through. Honestly, I do not know what I would do if something were to happen to Harry. He is my best friend and I am just happy to know he is still alive after fighting Voldemort. Thank you for talking to me and sharing. I appreciate it." She smiled softly.
Severus and Narcissa exchanged worried looks as their unexpected guest looked like she was about to have a panic attack. "Severus, we need to get her out of this room. Remember when the snatchers captured Harry, Ron and Hermione? My sister did something so abhorrent to that poor girl." She whispered to him with tears in her eyes. His eyes noticeably widened.
Draco walked back to the sitting room and approached the bookshelf. He choose his favourite book, Dracula by Bram Stoker. He sat down and attempted to read the book but was unsuccessful due to his thoughts. He could not stop smiling. All his thoughts about Harry Potter kept distracting him from reading.
Harry giggled softly. "You're kinda cute when you're nervous." He blurted out. He then felt his face heat up quite a bit. "I mean to say I'd like to stay longer. I enjoy your company surprisingly."
Draco took a few moments before answering. "I think I would rather sleep next to you, Harry. You make me feel safe and maybe you will keep the nightmares away."
The salesperson emerged from the back with a tray of rings. “Here are all the high end engagement rings. I assume he’s a Slytherin so prestige is everything.” She smirked.
Hermione chuckled lightly. “Sev, please just spit it out. You look like you are in agony.” She smiled encouragingly at him.
His mother watched her son squirm. "Darling, he would never do that to us. He knew how bad things were for us during the war. Please stop making accusations regarding his visit today."
Sirius chuckled. “Understatement of the century, James.” Remus elbowed him in the ribs. “Oww!” He made a face.
Draco had tears in his eyes. "Harry, you really mean that? You want to be mine? And you would rather not wait? I enjoy kissing you too. Nothing would make me happier than to be yours. Severus said that I should not have to hide my feelings for you. He was right. We should not have to hide anymore. I want everyone to know that you are with me." He squeezed Harry's hand and brought it to his lips and kissed his hand. He blushed a little bit.
As the tea whistled, Harry stood in front of Draco and smiled encouragingly. "You really shouldn't worry so much. Everything will work out. Now let's have some tea, shall we?" Draco nodded.
Severus did not know how to respond so he responded the only way he could. He kissed her with everything he got and she responded just as fervently. After a long while, they pulled away breathless.
Harry blushed once again. "No one asked you. Oh wait I did ask you. We could talk about quidditch? That's the only thing I know we have in common." Harry fidgeted nervously.
Draco's eyes went wide. He never heard of such a potion before but he knew Granger could and would find something like that. "I really do not know what to say, Potter."
Harry immediately took her hand and smiled widely. “Friends, Pansy. And apology accepted. Ever since I realised that I had feelings for Draco, all I wanted was for him to be happy and I wanted to be part of that happiness in some way. To my surprise, he shared his thoughts and feelings towards me and the rest is history.” He blushed a bit at his admission.
Draco pulled back a bit. "Merlin, it is good to see you again. I assume Mother and Severus told you what happened. I really appreciate that you are willing to let me stay with you. Thank you, Harry."
"Do you have any idea why Potter saved us from Azkaban? It is driving me insane because he has no reason that I know of to due so." Draco said.
Harry watched his boyfriend intently. “Love, you are so worthy of everything involving me and happiness. You are so incredible and beautiful, Draco. There is no one else in the world I want to spend my life with. And yes I said life, not time. You haven’t a clue how much you truly mean to me. I know it hasn’t been very long that we have been together but it feels like a lifetime and I can’t imagine my life without you. What I’m trying to say is that I’m hopeless in love with you. I know it seems early in our relationship but it seems like we’ve been building up to this moment for years since the beginning when we met at Hogwarts. I wanted to let you know how I truly feel about you. I couldn’t hold it in any longer.” He kissed Draco quickly and pulled away smiling. “I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry perked up a bit. “We don’t have any Polyjuice on hand so I guess just change my appearance enough so no one recognises me.”
Both Harry and Hermione ushered him into the hallway. Harry reached out and held his hand. Draco looked nervously at Hermione. She looked at their joined hands and smiled at them both. "Come on you two lovebirds. Let us get Draco safely to the apparation point."
When Hermione heard her first name, her eyes flitted to Severus and she nodded. He went over to her and she leaned most of her weight onto him as he wrapped his arm around her. Severus guided her out of the room that held such terrible memories for the witch. They entered a room lined with bookshelves. Severus placed Hermione gently onto the love seat. "As you can observe this room is the library. I thought it might calm you if you were near something that you hold close to your heart. Books." She gave him a small smile. "Also, I summoned a modified calming draught. It will not make you fall asleep. It just takes the edge off of your panic attack symptoms." He handed her the vial and she gulps it down without question. He saw her visibly relax and she sighed in relief.
Draco was finally ready for breakfast, but not ready for Potter. He needed to calm down before tea time or he was going to make a fool of himself. And Malfoys do not make fools of themselves in front of enemies.
Both Harry and Draco were blushing ferociously at what Severus said. Draco sheepishly looked at his godfather and sighed. He finally got the courage to speak up. "I do not bloody well need anyone's approval. I have done what has been asked of me time after time and I am done. Harry makes me happy and I am not about to apologise for finally accepting myself. You know as well as I do that people can change and happiness does exist."
Winky, the house elf, announced that lunch was ready. They all went to the dinning room and sat down. During the meal, they chatted to one another.
When Harry arrived back to Grimmauld Place after his visit to Malfoy Manor, he was immediately assaulted by the presence of Hermione and Ron who looked like they'd been waiting for hours. Both gave him a suffocating hug simultaneously. He huffed out a laugh.
Both Narcissa and Severus apparated away and Harry looked at Draco sadly. “Dray, my love, let’s move to somewhere more comfortable, okay?” Harry helped Draco stand up and they slowly made it up the stairs and into their bedroom. He laid his boyfriend on their shared bed and climbed in next to Draco.
Minnie cleared her throat loudly to get everyone's attention. "It is getting rather late. Severus, how about you go home with Draco? I am sure he would love to catch you up with everything and Narcissa will be pleased to see you again. Harry and Hermione, let us call it a day and you can come back to find more about James, Lily and their friends at another time. It has been an eventful day. We could all use a good rest." She smiled at everyone softly.
Narcissa called to him "Breakfast is ready, darling! Winky is getting impatient. She is going to come get you if you take much longer."
Severus spoke first. “Honestly, I never thought I would ever have a chance at a love that was not unrequited. For decades, it has only ever been Lily and I am sure you know what happened. I did not get the girl and our friendship was broken forever as I have said. I always regretted what I had done to her and unfortunately I never got the chance to apologise for my appalling behaviour.” He looked mournful but continued. “It was not until I was resurrected when you were watching me. That was when I knew that everything would be different. I could feel you looking at me. I mean really looking at me. And when you came to the Manor, speaking with you felt so right. I was astonished by how easy it was to converse with you. And at the risk of embarrassing myself, looking into your eyes and being with you felt like coming home. I do not want to rush into anything with you because I want to savour my time with you. I just thought I would tell you that the feeling is mutual, Hermione.” He said shyly.
I know we have never gotten along in the past but I'd like to change that if you're willing to work on our issues. Also, I'd like to return something to you that I borrowed during the war. I was wondering if you would allow me to come to the Manor and return your property. Please let me know when you're available.
Harry looked at Ron and Hermione. “That was quicker than I had expected it to be. Thank Merlin for Hermione. I would’ve been agonising over what rings to get. And now I don’t need to search for wedding bands. I’m all set.” He smiled thoughtfully.
When Draco arrived back at Grimmauld Place, he found Harry staring off into space. He smiled at his boyfriend. “Love, how was your day?”
Sirius continued to rant. “Remy, how could you be so fucking calm? We are in Malfoy Manor and our Harry is canoodling with a Malfoy? Do you not see the issue with this? Because I certainly do!” He stared holes in Draco.
Harry hugged back. “Thank you for coming with me. Both of you. It meant the world to me to share this with you.”
Ron grumbled under his breath and let out a frustrated sigh. He nodded. "Just don't expect me to be friends with his ferret face! He's been bloody awful to me and Ginny. Harry, you can't possibly believe he has changed and forgive him. Even with his Death Eater father rotting in Azkaban. We're your family. Do you know how my family is going to feel? Probably betrayed!"
Severus smirked at the witch. "Of course you were researching. I am hardly surprised. What did you find?"
Severus walked over to Draco. "Be sure to take care of each other. And Potter if I hear that you hurt my godson you will be very sorry. I will see you soon. Rest up, boys." He sneered at Harry and smiled at Draco. Harry blushed.
Severus blushed a bit and sputtered. “I am having difficulty forming the words, Miss Granger.” He gave her an exasperated look. “IaminlovewithyouHermione.” The words just came rushing out.
Draco felt nervous about tomorrow. He did not know why though. He told his dear mother about tomorrow's afternoon tea guest. She smirked at him knowing why he was nervous and he look at her curiously. Narcissa bid her son good night before he could ask her why she was smirking at him.
Hermione stands up and kisses Harry on the top of his head. "I understand. I need to get back to my parents anyway. I want to have dinner with them. Sweet dreams, Harry. I love you." She smiled at him.
Minnie smirked. "Harry is quite right. Hermione was quite the stickler when it came to pronunciation and would not let you hear the end of it if you were to say something wrong."
Hermione squeezed his hand. "You two should not hide your feelings for each other, Harry. Though considering everything, I understand why it needs to happen this way. But it still does not seem fair."
After they got ready for bed, Harry reached for Draco and held his hand. "Why don't you get in first Dray? Get comfortable and then I'll join you." He smiled sweetly at his Draco.
The salesperson nodded. “Yes you do. If that’s something you’re interested in. You can buy everything separately but I can’t guarantee this price later on. It’s up to you, sir.”
Potter rolled his eyes once again. "There's no need to be nasty about it. I just thought I'd return your wand to you and see how both you and your mother were doing. I want to start over with you, Draco. Why can't we just get along? The war is over and we're not longer enemies. I thought that much was obvious when I spoke at each of your trials on your behalf. I actually want to be your friend or at the very least get to know my ex-rival. Would that be so horrifying for you?" Harry looked hurt that Draco was not responded how he had hoped.
Narcissa chuckled and smiled. “Oh Harry you are too precious. I am certainly not naive and I do know you will never hurt Draco, at least not intentionally. I believe you two will get married some day and I will get to call you my son-in-law in the near future. My Draco will one day be a Potter, of that I am certain. Honestly, I already think of you as my son. You are quite dear to me and you have my unending and unwavering support.” She gave him a watery smile.
Hours later, Harry and Draco woke up. They were tangled up in each other’s arms. Neither moved or looked away. Harry kissed Draco slowly and softly. When he stopped, Draco whined playful. “How do you feel, Dray?” He smiled.
Remus smiled fondly at Harry. “Kindness does go a long way even with house elves. That was incredibly thoughtful of you. Hermione must be proud.” He chuckled.
Draco hugged Minnie and said goodbye to her. Severus nodded and said his farewells. They both entered the floo and disappeared.
Pansy snickered. “You are quite spot on, Severus. Weasel here has been nothing but beastly since he arrived. He is next level crude and that is saying something coming from me. Oh and welcome to the snake club Hermione.” She smiled at Severus and winked at Hermione.
They all nodded at him. Harry looked at Ron. “I speak for everyone. You will need to earn our trust and forgiveness. Nothing half arsed and if you step one toe out of line, that will be the end. No more chances.” Hermione, Severus and Draco all nodded in agreement to what Harry had just said. “Oh and it’s Severus. We’re no longer his students so we are all on a first name basis from now.” He smiled at Severus who nodded to him but he sneered at Ron.
Draco observed his mother curiously once again. "To be honest, I had hoped I would never see him again. I guess I am not very lucky since he is gracing us with his presence later on today."
Narcissa chuckled softly. "Harry, I believe you embarrassed my son by calling him Draco. I do not think you ever called him by his first name." What his mother said made him blush even harder and he averted his eyes.
Harry thought about Draco and could not wait until he returned from visiting Severus and Narcissa. He thought of what he was going to say as he proposed to Draco. He felt like he was vibrating, that’s how excited he was for tonight.
Draco looked at the box confused. "What is in the box, Potter? I do not want to touch something without knowing what is in it."
Hermione looked at him. “You speechless? That is quite unheard of.” She teased. “I suppose you will need to leave shortly since it is getting a bit late. I am sure Narcissa is impatiently waiting for you to return.” She smirked.
Sirius laughed. “Bloody hell! I have missed watching you bicker in real life! Never a dull moment with you two!” He was shaking with laughter.
Harry pulled Draco close. “Love, please talk to me. I’m worried about you.” He kissed his boyfriend’s head softly.
Draco shook his head. "Vaguely but nothing clearly. I think it was during the war and when Voldemort was living here at the manor."
Harry cracked a smile. "Hermione you're bloody brilliant! I'll definitely take Draco with me. I can't wait to see Snape's face when he sees that his godson is friends with me." He chuckled.
Severus smiled when he heard her say his first name. "We all have our moments after a great trauma. No need to feel embarrassed. It is only natural to react that way." He sat next to her and gathered her hand in his.
Draco looked at Harry. “I really do not know how I got so lucky to have you in my life. You are always saving me from danger or myself.” He leaned forward so their lips touched and he deepened the kiss ever so slightly.
Sirius interrupted the sweet moment by opening his mouth. “So group hug everyone?” Everyone just glared at him. “What? It is a legitimate question. Don’t get all judgy.”
Draco just stared at the letter. He wasn't sure how to respond. Eventually he thought of the perfect response.
He walked over to Dumbledore's old desk. Minnie spoke. "After your arrival today, this arrived. It is a letter from Albus. It is addressed to you, Draco." She handed him the letter. He wasn't sure what to make of Dumbledore writing to him.
Severus huffed. “That is all well and good but she never consulted with me. She should have come to me. I am sure she had a bad reaction to the spell she performed. I could have given her potions to help.” He gave her a worried look. “Not to mention, that Lily is now here. Even if I have moved on, it is still a bit painful to look at her.” He sheepishly looked at Lily. “No offence. I, too, was brought back to life not too long ago and I just recently found something I never thought possible for me. Requited love.”
Harry awkwardly stood up and followed Draco out to the terrace and down the stairs to the garden. They walked side by side to the bench in the garden. As they walked, their hands brushed. Both felt shocks which was unknown to the other. They finally got to the bench and sat next to each other in silence.
Both Harry and Draco blushed and nodded at her. Hermione carefully opened the front door. Thankfully, the protective barrier prevented the press from getting too close to the house. Both Harry and Hermione sandwiched Draco between them as they started to descend the stair to the pavement. There were lots of flashes and people bombarding them with questions. All three ignored their questions and walked by them. Thankfully none of the reporters tried to invade their space while they were walking by. As soon as Harry, Draco and Hermione crossed the street they sprinted to the apparation point. It seemed no one followed them. As they arrived at the apparation point, Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek. "Thank you Hermione for helping us out." She nodded and they waved at her as she vanished.
The Azkaban guard sneered at Draco and nodded at Harry. “Lucius Malfoy has been transported to the visitors section for you, Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy. Just follow me. And I suggest you conjure a patronus once you are inside the premises and I presume Kingsley mentioned bringing chocolate for yourself and the prisoner to get a proper visit.” Both Draco and Harry followed the guard.
Potter blushed a bit. "Oh right yes I did. Draco, I brought something that once belonged to you." He brought a long box out and placed on the table.
When Draco heard his name being mentioned, he looked at Harry. "Is everything okay? I heard my name." He told Snape he would be right back.
Before anyone could reply, Kreacher returned. “Kreacher cleaned and set up two bedrooms for your guests, Master Harry. Kreacher will show you to your rooms if you would like.”
Severus smiled a bit. "No need to apologise or thank me, Miss Granger. What I did for our world was the right course of action. And it was my mission to be the loathsome Potions professor so loyal Death Eater families would not question my allegiance and suspect me of betrayal. Though, to be honest, I am rather dastardly and off-putting even without a mission of subterfuge. If I am spot on with my memory, Albus always teased that I was an acquired taste." He wistfully smiled at Albus' portrait who nodded and chuckled. Severus looked a little sad but as soon as he noticed others staring him, he once again looked stony faced.
Draco ate a sandwich and drank some tea while waiting for Potter's reply. He smirked smugly because Potter was still trying to figure out what he'd say back.
Harry blushed a bit. "Dray, I'm really happy to know that you didn't have any more nightmares. And I feel just as lucky as you feel, having you by my side." He moved even closer and softly kissed Draco.
Ron’s eyes bulged a bit. “Blimey! So soon! Are you sure about this? I’m not one to judge or interfere but you just got together with Malfoy.”
Draco pulled Harry back into bed and Harry rolled over to face Draco. “If you would like we could get some more sleep.” He caressed Draco’s cheek.
It seemed that Draco left Harry speechless for a bit. It looked like his eyes glistened as if he had tears in his eyes. Harry made a watery sigh and took both of Draco's hands in his which startled Draco. "I never felt I had a home until Hogwarts and the Weasleys but you have proved to me that a home can also be just one person, not just a place or a big loving family. So thank you. Deep down I always knew there was something extraordinary about you. When I was younger, I was in extreme denial but the end of the war changed me so much. It's why I contacted you. I wanted to make things right between us and hoped something more than friendship would happen. I have to tell you I regret never shaking your hand. I keep wondering if I had, things would have turned out differently but at the same time I can't go down that rabbit hole of guilt. I'm just relieved that you were open to speaking with me. You have no idea how delighted I am that you're in my life but in a positive way."
Harry chuckled. “Bloody hell is right! Dray, I literally have no words for how I feel.” He pulled Draco closer and kissed him softly. “I love you so much, Dray. More every day.” He smiled.
A couple days had past since Draco saw Harry and he could not decide on what to say in his letter about getting together again. He kept pacing which in turn made Winky very nervous and of course Narcissa found it quite amusing.
Harry responded eagerly to the kiss. He gently pushed Draco down onto his back. As he deepened the kiss, Draco moaned and kissed him with everything he had.
After Draco found Winky and told her about their guest, she scurried off. He just reminisced the day's events as he found his back to the parlour. He was just happy he had his godfather back. And over the moon happy that he supported his relationship with Harry. His last thought before rejoining his mother and Severus for tea was Harry kissing him in front of everyone. He smiled at the sweet memory.
Draco was finally able to speak again. "If you do not regret anything, neither do I. I am looking forward to the insanity that we just caused across the wizarding world. This also means I need to pay my father a visit far sooner than I had originally planned. I hope you are up for travelling to Azkaban. I can not do this alone. I need you there with me, Harry." He looked at Harry hopefully.
Severus walked up to Narcissa. "Apparently crafty old Albus had a gift for Draco when he arrived at Hogwarts. He interwoven my essence with a doe figurine and an incantation to be spoken. Miss Granger, I mean, Hermione was the one who activated the doe and brought me back. And Minnie suggested that I stay with Draco rather than returning to Spinners End."
Once they recovered from apparating, Draco pulled Harry closer to him. "So where is my proper goodbye? And what does it entail?" He teased.
Draco watched his mother leave and suddenly realised he would be alone with Potter. That thought just made his face heat up once again.
Narcissa spoke. "Darling, no. Sorry for alarming you. I told Kreacher to invite you both for lunch. I guess he never mentioned lunch. He really is dastardly at times."
The guard moved forward. “I think that is enough for today. Let’s call it a day, gentleman.” Both Harry and Draco nodded. They stood up and followed the guard without saying goodbye to Lucius.
A couple of hours later, Potter's owl flew through his bedroom window once again. Draco opened the new letter. A simple phrase of "see you tomorrow" was all it said. He shook his hand and smirked. Once he gave a treat to the owl, she flew off.
Harry slowed down a bit because he wanted to savour the last moments of their first time. Draco looked a little irritated. “You said you wanted to make love, Dray. And this isn’t it.” He smirked.
Harry had tears in his eyes, not knowing what to say. He was about to respond when Hermione entered the room. He smiled at her grateful.
Severus gently kissed her and pulled back slightly. “Hermione, you deserve the world and more. Ron is a wanker for not seeing you for who you truly are. Though, what is his loss is my gain so I can not complain.” He chuckled a bit.
Harry straightened himself out and huffed in frustration. “I am nothing like my father. Yes I believe he was a great man but he kept many prejudices. I refuse to be like that. Our world needs someone who can bridge the gap between houses and blood statuses. And I would like to think that I could be that. I mean I’m actually friends with Slytherins and I’m dating a Malfoy. You and I have put most of our differences aside. We are all just people at the end of the day after all. Why can’t everyone just get along? It’s bloody frustrating!” He sighed.
Molly watched them fondly. “Honestly, I never would have imagined a Malfoy would be a part of our family but stranger things have happened in this world like you and Harry getting together. Both of you were quite horrendous in school to each other.” She chuckled when both boys blushed.
As tea started to wind down, guests started to leave. Of course Molly hugged each and every one of them goodbye. Draco and Harry were the last to leave. They chatted with Molly a bit before heading out. They were going to say goodbye to Ron but he had vanished. Probably licking his wounds after being attacked by everyone, though rightly so considering how he treated his supposed friends. Again Molly hugged them tightly and kissed them on their cheeks.
Hermione chuckled. “Here, here! As much as I love this, I am absolutely knackered once again. Bloody Ronald and his idiocy! Severus, let us go home.” She hugged everyone as Severus nodded to everyone. She pulled Severus towards the floo. They waved goodbye as they vanished into the floo.
Harry pulled away slightly and looked into Draco’s eyes. “Dray, I need to see you. I need to see all of you.” He waited for his consent.
Draco had tears in his eyes but smiling brightly. “Ohhh Harry, really? Truly? I can not believe the man of my dreams is telling me that he loves me and is in love with me. Honestly, I have been waiting years to hear those words. You have always been important to me since first year believe it or not. I wanted to be a part of your world since day one and you never gave me the time of day, albeit for a very good reason. The day that you came to the Manor, I never thought this is what would happen with us. I was just happy you visited me. Though, I definitely can not complain about how our relationship evolved into this happy accident since I have dreamed of this moment. And what I am trying to say is that I am just as hopelessly in love with you as you are with me.” He mimicked Harry’s actions after his confession. “I love you too, Harry Potter.”
"Fair enough Pottah." Afterward, we didn't speak anymore and I watched out the nearby window that shined a deep moonlight outside. It was somewhat peaceful to watch; although I was still trying to get used to being here in the first place, after all I lived in a cupboard for most of my life without thinking of having magic even once.
"I never thought I'd ever have an Owl for a pet, I think I'll name you Hedwig. Do you like that?" Hearing the bird make some sort of chirping sound, I began to pet her head ever so gently while smiling at her. Giving her a little bit of food out of the palm of my hand, I winced a little bit beacuse of the sharp peck of her pointy mouth.
"That sounds absolutely terrible, I wouldn't know what to even remotely think if that happened to me. Thankfully; you two have separate classes today, he's in defense against the dark arts while you're in Charms with us." She told me while looking quite pleased with herself. "By the way Harry, my name is Hermonie it's nice to meet you."
"You were forced to kiss that jerk Malfoy?!" I could hear my friend yell at me which instantly made me want him to shut up or the entire school will hear about this. At the same time that girl from before came up to us while holding a book close to her.
"Finally! Class is over, we can go back to our dorms." Getting pulled by the neck, she dragged the two of us to our next lesson which was Potions with a deep sigh to herself. "Oh c'mon, we've done enough for one day."
"Right..." Finally releasing my collar, I straightened my messy black hair before watching him storm off. Afterward my friends came up to me demanding to know what he said, but in all honesty I had nothing much to say beacuse it only lasted a few seconds. "All he said was not to tell anyone about last night."
"Teacher's pet." Getting knocked on the head by the book she held in her hands, I couldn't help bursting out laughing beacuse of what happened. "Harry!" Trying to stop my laughter, we finally arrived at our Charms Class and went inside; still rubbing the bruise on the back of his head, we took our seats.
It's Potter's first day at Hogwarts and he is definitely excited to start. The only thing he wasn't expecting was to encounter the boy that he completely hates and is now stuck in the same Hogwarts House with him. Trying to understand eachother is like night and day; finding love they can't accept is even worse. (Harry Is In Slytherin House Instead Of Gryffindor And There's A Tsundere Draco Malfoy)
"Does the legendary Harry Potter think he deserves all the credit, I don't think so, instead I'm going to do it and everyone will know what a slacker you are." Finally trying to grab it out of his hands; the two of us were arguing about the situation until it finally fell onto the floor and that idiot landed ontop of me.
"I'm sorry, but unless you want to teach this class I would suggest you quit complaining and think about how you will fair in your next lesson." Giving me one last stern look, I watched him leave to order the rest of the students about our homework assignment.
"Alright here are our supplies; we only need to add the powered root together with wormwood." Grabbing the items out of my hands he started to add them together himself. "What do you think you're doing Malfoy?!"
"I still can't believe you had to deal with that in the first place, maybe it's the punishment you get for fooling around instead of focusing on your project instead." Hermonie said, which only made me roll my eyes at her and the three of us continued walking to our next lesson effortlessly.
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco. "I guess you're right but we don't have to do anything right this moment. Let's just enjoy each other's company, okay Dray?" He softly kissed Draco's forehead.
As he walks into their bedroom, he hears whimpering. “Dray, are you okay?” He snuggled up next to him. “I have a surprise waiting for you downstairs, love.”
Hermione got the hint, he didn't want to talk about Lily, being called a hero or the war any longer. "Well, I have been researching about your resurrection and what the process was to produce the doe figurine. I found some material on the subject and thought I would share my findings with you. Unfortunately in the excitement of wanting to tell you, I did not realise where I would end up landing in the Manor. I am still embarrassed."
Both Draco and Harry took the rings out of the box and slid them on each other’s fingers. Both were crying happy tears as they kissed each other with more passion and love than they ever had before.
As they drank their tea, Harry recounted the afternoon with the Malfoys. He did not tell his friends everything that happened for obvious reasons.
Harry kissed Draco’s neck softly. “Love, ready for sleep?” He felt his boyfriend nod into his neck and chuckled. “Turn around, Dray.” Harry gave him one last kiss before Draco had his back to him.
English translation of Narcissa's incantation: I implore you to bring back those lost, I implore you to bring back those lost, I implore you to bring back those lost. With this sacrifice bring forth Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. With this sacrifice bring forth Lily and James Potter.
Harry wasn’t sure how to respond. “Pansy, I know, there’s bad blood between the two of us. I truly love Draco. He makes me incredibly happy and makes me feel loved which I’ve never experienced before, at least not romantically. For his sake, you and I need to put the past behind us. I am willing to if you are.” He smiled softly. Both Slytherins were surprised by what he had said.
Harry looked at him. “Nev-ve-er, Dray.” They gripped each other tighter and picked up the pace a bit more. Harry continued to hit Draco’s sweet spot. “So cl-cl-ose, Dray.” He could feel Draco tighten around him. Suddenly, Draco panted Harry’s name as he came so hard all over their chests. Harry came just as hard inside Draco causing them to both moan. Harry was panting so fast trying to catch his breath. Once he got control, he slipped out of Draco and collapsed in a heap next to him.
Draco looks at the owl trying to figure out who her owner was. He gave up and opened the letter. He scanned the letter and at the end it was signed "Saint" Potter. He snorted and chuckled. He noticed that Potter's owl was still sitting next to him and muttered "I guess you are waiting for my reply."
Harry nervously chuckled and stared into Draco’s eyes. “I never felt like I belonged anywhere until I found out that I was a wizard. My relatives were abhorrent people and their house never felt like home. The moment I entered Hogwarts, I knew I was home. It’s funny how you think nothing would feel right especially since you live with people who hate you with every fibre of their beings. But after meeting Hermione and Ron, I finally felt like myself and didn’t feel like a freak. Then I met Ron’s family and they took me like I was their own. I had a family and people who loved me and not for my fame.” He paused for a moment and took Draco’s hands in his own. “I always thought home was a place but it can also be people. The Weasleys are my family. Hogwarts is still my home but I now have another home and it’s not a place. It’s a person. It’s you, Dray.” He smiled. “When I first met you, you were such a prat and I just couldn’t stand you. As the years went by our rivalry just escalated and we were always competing and keeping score. Then eventually we became enemies. By some miracle we both survived the war and the day I visited you was the beginning of everything.” Harry got up and pulled Draco up with him. He knelt down on one knee and looked into Draco’s glassy eyes. “It hasn’t been easy for either of us. Before and after getting together. But I wouldn’t change a second of what has happened. Everything that happened was always supposed to bring us to this very moment.” He kissed the top of Draco’s hand. “I never thought our tug of war with each other would become this but I couldn’t be happier that it did. After Ginny, I didn’t know I had it in me to love so fiercely but I’m so in love with you Draco it almost hurts. I can’t imagine a future without you in it. I want to spend the rest of my days with you, Draco.” He pulled out the ring box and opened it. “Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you do me the honour of one day becoming my husband?”
Hermione pulled Harry and Ron out in the open and it seemed like the Polyjuice worked. No one was rushing up to them for autographs.
One day, Draco decided to ask his mother about why Harry Potter saved the Malfoy family from certain doom. He just needed to know why he was spared.
Severus was at a loss as to what to do about Hermione. He thought of what they discussed and how they teased each other. She truly reminded him of Lily which caused his heart to clench. Lily Evans was his always throughout most of his life and he never saw himself recovering from losing her but he also could not disregard the new bond he seemed to be forming with Hermione. The mere thought of seeing her again sent his heart aflutter. Maybe Narcissa was spot on regarding his happiness and he should take a chance on love again. But just the thought of moving on from Lily terrified him a bit. Though he had to admit, perhaps it was for the best to start anew.
Harry looked at her. “Of course I’m sure! This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever been this sure of something. I love him, Hermione. I can’t see myself without anyone else but Draco. And if that’s the case, why wait? I don’t see the point in waiting after everything we’ve been through. I want my life to finally start on my own terms and Draco is everything I never thought I could have. Not too long ago I thought I wasn’t going to survive the war and I did. After Ginny, I thought I was destined to never find love and actually keep it. Then that fateful day I visited the Manor happened and all of my doubts fell away. And it was all because of Draco. I know I sound like a mad man but this is literally the first time I’ve felt truly happy.” He continued rambling.
