They pull out their wand, pointing it at the bed. Something with… Harry can’t even come up with the first word of the spell.
“Any hint of pureblood, bigoted bullshit, especially to the Weasleys, I turn you right in to the Aurors,” Potter warned when he reached Draco.
“Dare.”
“I see you two boys have learned how to act cosy together.”
Draco just gave him a soft look, then turned towards the bathroom. “I’ll shower first.”
“What’s the furthest you’ve gone with Weasley?”
“Still enjoying rooming with Malfoy?” Ron asks as they tear into their food.
* * *
Potter laughed again, and the tension in the room eased. “The metaphorical closet existed separately from the cupboard, which was quite real.”
“I fancy you too,” they tell him. “If you were wondering.”
Ron wisely kept silent for their ride, and stayed one step behind Harry as they walked as fast as they could to Gilbertson’s office.
A bell goes off, and Malfoy and Harry start their hobble to the first obstacle. Harry steps over with his right leg, then they pull over their connected legs, and Malfoy brings his left leg over. Next, there’s a line of cones to navigate around. They’re moving slowly, and the old men to their right are overtaking them. Malfoy’s grabbing onto Harry’s arm, and Harry’s doing his best not to move it around too much.
Ron and Hermione stop over that Saturday for lunch, Ron with bags of takeaway in his arms.
“Hence... the boat.”
“Nonsense, I insist. We’ll leave after breakfast. Harry, you can help Arthur with the back garden, the gnomes are at it again.”
“Yes, I read them. At first, because I had nothing better to do. And then because I actually was learning things.”
“Do I have a choice?” Draco drawls.
Draco crinkles his eyes in amusement, then looks at Harry seriously. “Did it make you feel uncomfortable? Hearing ‘he’ pronouns used for you?”
“What did the Muggles do to you?”
It was this flaw that led him to keep tabs on Draco Malfoy during his three years of Auror training. Malfoy had donated his obscene wealth to charity, stayed in a shitty, studio flat during his Potions mastery, and he’d even volunteered at Hogwarts for the rebuild. Overall, Malfoy was not only annoyingly good at Potions but also becoming an annoyingly non-bigoted, not-evil wizard.
“Actually decent?” Ron snorts. “Are you in there, Harry? Is that you? Who is this man, and what has he done with my best mate?”
“Not really. You’ve both always been hyperfixated on each other. I’m glad you were able to work through your pasts, though, you seem really happy together.”
Draco didn’t respond. But after a few minutes of silence, Potter spoke again. “What’s your tattoo of?”
“Er, yes, sorry, I won’t.”
It’s just past seven, and it’s definitely too early to go to bed. But Harry doesn’t care, they just want to avoid the situation. The situation that they created by fucking up what was becoming a perfectly good friendship.
Harry James Potter is not without his flaws. High among these flaws, if you happened to ask him, is his inability to let go of things that bother him.
Malfoy’s still smiling as he picks up Doris and leaves.
“My mother is sick, Potter.” Draco pushed away from Potter, who barely budged. “The trials took too much out of her. The war took too much out of her. She’s on probation for three more years. She wouldn’t be able to visit me if I’m outside the country, and I need to be there for her.”
“You shouldn’t be wasting those lips on anyone else but me.”
“Stop, Draco, it’s fine,” Harry cuts him off. “No problem.”
“You have to,” Goldstein retorts.
“God, Malfoy, and here I thought you’d gained an ounce of self-respect after everything—”
“Really?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “What am I allergic to, then?”
“He’s right, you know,” Draco said softly. “You really could get sent to Azkaban. It’s not worth it. You’re not getting anything out of this.”
“Harry,” they reply.
His mother had found him lying on the floor, passed out in his own blood. She rushed him to St. Mungo’s. When he came to, his left arm was nothing but a mess of torn skin and drying blood. The Healer had been kind to him. “It’s going to scar,” she said. “I will do my best, though.” And she had. All the others could see now were the scars. Not a trace of the Mark. And as gruesome as it looks, Draco’s relieved to have the snake gone.
Malfoy comes in the next week too, and makes another appointment with Dave for ‘right now.’ He brings in Dorothy, a Canadian Rain Cobra. There’s nothing wrong with Dorothy.
“You don’t like me,” Harry tells him. “You… think I have a punchable face. You were miserable at the ball-”

, but Harry needed the distraction and the proximity to the bar. And really, Draco was only being stubborn for the hell of it.
They don’t laze in bed all morning like they might like to; they need to get up for breakfast and figure out what to do for lunch. Luckily, the hotel offered packed lunches, so they picked out their sandwiches and crisps, paid for them in advance and left their names for pickup before going to breakfast.
Everything was actually going very well, in Harry’s opinion, until they arrived at their room for the night.
Harry devoured the works on art history the same way he devoured the stories of hobbits and pirates, his appetite for escape voracious.  He learned techniques and terms, practicing and doodling and drawing whenever he could—between classes, late at night, whenever he had a free moment to sit somewhere far from the little house on Privet Drive, away from Dudley and Vernon and chores and housework.  He could reimagine the world around him, capture it on paper, in ink, in lines and details and relief—and he would be someone different in this paper world, someone outside his hunger and bruises and baggy clothes and no parents.
“Bigger the fool me. I’m going to explore the grounds—if you aren’t at the bus in time for departure, I’m having the driver leave you behind. I could use the extra space; there are some lovely little shops here and I’m sure Mother and Aunt Andromeda would both appreciate a small token.”
The coach deposited them at the hotel with a reminder about both supper time and the departure scheduled for the next day, then they were free.
The afternoon in Waterford began at Waterford Crystal. The store was filled with crystal baubles, figurines, and glassware. Draco picked up a candle holder for Hermione, that he and Harry could give her for Christmas, and matching vases for his aunt and mother. He also bought a lovely crystal owlet for Harry, as a surprise for his birthday.
And while he thought and planned and worked and drew and tattooed himself and others, and researched and sketched, and went to Hogwarts to capture the destruction left behind and help with the rebuilding, there were still teas with Narcissa at the Manor, and with Andromeda in her flat, and lunches at the Burrow, and Grimmauld Place to clean and order and make liveable.  By the time he had moved into Grimmauld Place completely, and Narcissa and Andromeda were having tea there, together, with Teddy, and Draco Malfoy was finished with his house arrest, and was coming to tea, too, and Ginny and Dean and Seamus were all together, Harry knew what he wanted to give Draco.

Look forward to the bonus chapter :))))
And nothing planned.
“Oh, fuck, coming up to twenty years soon, isnnit?” Harry checked.
“Right, that’s at the very back, gents,” the driver told them. He was maybe ten years their senior and had a slight Welsh accent. “We’ve just got three more pick-up points, then we’ll be heading for the ferry! Head on up to your seats, and don’t forget to buckle up.”
Before Draco could become uncomfortable with the silence or lost in green eyes, the professor (whose name he should have made a point to learn already) called back the attention of the class.
“What do you need, Harry?” sighed through a mobile is the response he gets when Harry's done peppering his best friend with praise (although all of it is true).
“Oh, we aren’t married,” Draco responds, but he gives the man a pleasant smile. “We've been dating for six years, though.  Although,” and here Draco laughs and Harry knows what’s coming.  “Harry here, being the dolt he is, didn’t know we were dating for the first year, even after we moved in together.  So I keep changing the anniversary date, because there isn’t really an official one.”
“At least I didn’t propose during sex,” Harry whispers to Draco between kisses.
It was in this year that Harry learned about Blood Quills, and was reminded again of Quick-Quotes Quills, and he swore to never use either, and even now he doesn’t know which is actually worse.
Harry books the last two seats on a coach leaving Cardiff for a week in Killarney.
Not everyone joined the cruise, of course, but Draco practically dragged Harry onboard, claiming spots on the bench at the stern of the boat. Harry smiled as Draco giddily pointed out interesting sights on the islands they passed, including the ruins and herds of “deer? Elk? Potter, help me out, you should know this.”
Ross Castle, much like Blarney Castle the day before, was more ruined fort than the magnificent luxury of Cardiff Castle—but it was easier for Draco to enjoy them that way, Harry knew. And Harry could admit to feeling similarly.
“Lorraine is our eldest granddaughter and is actually a mother of two already. She’s why we moved to Wales, you know. She wanted to get away from Yorkshire after her divorce but didn’t want to separate the boys from all the rest of their family—she really is a wonderful girl, and such a caring mother, I don’t know what that fool of a husband was thinking, messing about on her—and she asked us if we wanted to join her. She had found a company that had a lot of locations in West Glamorgan, and a lovely cottage in Mumbles, with a neighbouring house also for sale, and we agreed to cross the Severn with her.
He learned that trips, even impromptu accidental train journeys, need some preparation, even if it is just a handful of pounds to buy snacks before rushing through the platform before the train departs.
Getting settled, it turned out, was different from getting comfortable.
Draco enjoyed exploring the castle grounds, the ancient parts of the castle he could enter, and the small walk of tourist shops full of Royal Dalton and Irish knits. He ended up buying a quaint chintz tea set for his mother, and a set of tea mugs in a similar pattern for his aunt.
Harry had never felt better about his choice to switch fields to Mediwizardry.
“Your loss—I’m going to the Stone.”
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
Draco’s reaction did not disappoint. “Your… room?” He sounded absolutely flabbergasted, which was always amusing for Harry. “But… but… the Aurors?” Harry just smiled and shook his head.
Harry stops drawing after the Astronomy Tower and the funeral and the Goodbyes and the parties.  He reads books in the tent with Hermione, after Ron leaves.  He tries to think, tries to piece everything together, tries to search for clues, tries to stop himself from looking through that book filled with hundreds of copies of Draco Malfoy’s face and eyes and blood, which he somehow managed to keep on his person through all the different flights and fights and trials.  But then there was Christmas at Godric’s Hollow and the nightmares are worse and Harry starts to draw again.  He draws Dumbledore in his youth, the smiling face of Grindewald, the body of Bathilda as it crumples to the floor, the face of Draco Malfoy as he is forced to torture or be tortured.  There is no colour in these images, and no charms to bring them to life—Harry doesn’t want them alive, he wants them out of him, wants to escape the pressure they create in his head, in his chest.
As soon as Professor Snape was gone the four came out. They looked at each other, and then at the door once more.
An hour later Gryffindor found the snitch and the game ended, with 120-200. The teams flew to the floor and unmounted their brooms as quickly as their sore hinnies could. Draco had the odd experience of high fiving the Gryffindor's and knowing a few of them enough that they could congratulate him personally. For example, the Weasley Twins, who high fived him and grabbed his hand like they were holding hands. They proceeded not to let go until Draco said the magic word, which happened to be Merlin.
“And the Philosopher’s Stone.” Hermione followed quietly.
that if I ever needed you, you would be there for me." Harry explained. Hermione smiled a little less watery that time.
"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there, like lightning." One of the twins, likely Fred, said.
He stared up at the two who watched him with heartfelt smiles. He’d never seen these people before in his life, but it seemed like they knew him. The woman was beautiful, with long red hair and green eyes much like his own; while the man was tall, his black hair was untidy around his hazel eyes, which bore glasses not too different from Harry’s. He watched them as the pieces fell into place, and he could see them grow sad. He knew who they were.
Harry laughed, because after everything else he'd seen, this didn't surprise him. Still, he made a mental note to find out where the 'third floor corridor on the right hand side' was so he could safely avoid it at all costs. Along with a note to see the forest, so he knew the parameters of the area he could walk during his free time.
"I thought I was when I saw Professor Snape... It would have been ok though," Draco answered. Neville glowed under his words even if he still grimaced at the thought. A few of the Slytherin's bristled around him, which Draco saw. He continued, "Private tutors would be much better than this school."
"Harry." Neville whispered, and Harry was brought back to his main mission.
to fly by reading books and was very out of her element in this setting. She lectured all of them about the etiquette to Quidditch and flying from "Quidditch Through the Ages", which Neville clung to like it would save his life. Considering how many times Harry, Hermione, and Draco had had to catch him thus far in and out of class, it was a valid concern.
A few of the students, those familiar with ghosts, nodded to the haunts. The Fat Friar grinned at the group.
The countryside that was flying past the window became wilder. The neat fields had gone; now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.
"I won't ask it of you to choose us over your house. You should do what makes you happy," Harry explained a bit more. Maybe Draco hadn't understood what he meant. "That's not to say we don't want to be your friends, we do, but if it causes you strife we don't want to-"
On the cue, the door burst open, which let in a cold breeze as Professor Snape stepped into the classroom. He swept past the students quickly until he reached his desk, at which point he stopped and turned to face his class with a callous gaze. He began to take roll, and like Professor Flitwick he paused when he got to Harry's name. Unlike Professor Flitwick, he didn't fall off a pile of books.
"What's charades?"
"Wow." Ron said, and sat back with an awed expression. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.
Professor Dumbledore bid him goodnight and closed the portrait. Harry quickly wrote three letters out and put them in a cubby hole to dry for him to send out the next morning. He laid in bed after that, and fell asleep.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." Professor McGonagall finished. The first year body stared at her a little dazed at the information for a few short moments. Her eyes pinned down Neville's cloak, which was clasped under his left ear, and then at the smudge on Ron's nose.
Harry was sure he was in a nightmare then. In the room they now hid in was a massive beast; a black monster with three dog heads, and each one was focused on them. It got worse once the dog rose, and now he filled the whole room. It took one look at the three heads growling for Harry to decide he would choose Filch over death.
"Like this," Sir Nick said irritably. The ghost raised his hand, grabbed his left ear, and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell to his shoulder as if on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him but had not done it properly. Sir Nick flipped his head back onto his neck once the students had gotten a good stare. He coughed and said, "So, new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable. He's the Slytherin ghost."
Harry piled his plate with all the foods he wanted, and nibbled along all of it. The tables were rather quiet at the moment from everyone eating, and his eyes would drift over to the Slytherin table every so so often, where he swore Draco stared back just as often. Eventually a ghost drifted into his vision, and he looked up at the failed jester once more.
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always forgets I don't like corned beef."
The first years ducked into the stalls as the troll came tumbling down, and only as the rubble settled and the troll stayed down did they leave. To see Professor McGonagall, Snape, and Quirrell.
Harry got up from the floor and turned to the door just as Professor Dumbledore walked in. Harry tried to cover himself up as quickly as possible, but Professor Dumbledore had seen him. The Headmaster stared at where Harry was, and Harry thought he was in trouble. Surely he was. He was out after curfew with an invisibility cloak in front of an unknown mirror.
Harry and Neville skipped lunch to find Hermione then, because their friend never skipped a class. They went to the common room first, and then went their way down the halls. Eventually Lavender and Parvati was able to point them in a direction- the girl's bathroom. After knocking on the door for a few minutes, because neither wanted to go into the
Transfiguration was taught by Professor McGonagall, the one with the emerald green robes that sorted them. Her personality matched her exterior: stern and clever. Precisely when class was supposed to begin, she told them exactly what she expected from her students.
“It is the Mirror of Erised. Or, the Mirror of Desire. It shows what you truly want, and for many, they’ll die to see it.” Professor Dumbledore answered. Harry’s lips parted subtly in surprise, and he saw his parents once more, in a different light. They smiled and waved, and he wanted to be there, but now he didn’t trust it. He had no idea how long he’d stood there before Dumbledore showed up. What if it had been most of the night?
?" Draco asked. Some of the people from his group finally noticed he'd disappeared, and two bulky looking kids came back their way. Harry wondered if his time was limited with Draco then.
Draco and Harry considered it, and the longer they thought, the more they believed it. They'd seen Professor Dumbledore do incredible things, like make food appear on all the tables with random words. He was also wickedly old, and the Chocolate Frog card Harry still had mentioned he'd found uses in dragon
“So... Halloween night?” Harry asked, and it clicked in Professor Snape’s head that that night was probably what started their hunt for it all.
"Mr. Malfoy," Professor McGonagall began. She stared at the Slytherin first year for a long moment. "That was a very brave thing to do, to help a classmate with his rogue broom. Ten points to Slytherin for your fast reaction."
"All right, keep your hair on." The twin said.
"We're changing her," Neville whispered conspiratorially. The other two nodded, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
a friend yet, and only hung out because they were in the same house. Draco was entirely different; he was in a different house, and Harry had just asked.
“We know about Fluffy.” Neville was the first to say boldly, which broke the reign of silence, and therefore the fear of speaking.
He suddenly wished very much that he could feel his mother’s touch. She still grabbed his shoulder, and yet he felt nothing. He watched them avidly, unwilling to look away for fear he’d never see them again. He took in all he could of them before he had to leave, which came too soon at the sound of quick feet.
The only time this pattern broke was Friday. They had a double period of Potions in the morning, and the afternoon free. It was the first time that week they had a free afternoon.
“You might be,” Professor Snape answered blithely. “Hope that Mr. Quirrell didn’t hear you.”
"You are here to learn the subtle science and specific art of potion making," Professor Snape began. He spoke quiet enough that the back of the class barely heard him, but they all caught every word. Similar to Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape had your attention with every word without having to try. "As there is less wand-work in here, many of you will not see the magic within this craft. I don't believe you will truly understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even place a stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads that I usually have to teach."
Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so; all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.
The second part of the identical duo appeared, and he was the spitting image of the first twin, right down to the last strand of hair. Together they helped Harry with his luggage and carried it for him to his chosen compartment. Once it was nestled away in a place it couldn't hurt anyone, Harry turned to the twins and grinned.
"You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach, liver, and tripe. George said he had a booger flavored one once."
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. He continued. "His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a Prefect, but they couldn't aff- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
"So this is Dumbledore!" Harry said.
"If he's expelled it's my fault." Neville whispered to Harry and Hermione once thirty minutes had passed. They tried to comfort them as they could, but there was little to say. It would be, technically, Neville's fault, and they couldn't say Draco wasn't expelled.
"Malfoy, Draco!" Professor McGonagall called out.
"No," Ron said. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."
The next morning Harry woke up bright and early alongside with a few other members of his dorm. Neville Longbottom, who was too anxiety ridden to not wake up before six; and Dean Thomas, who was used to getting up early naturally. Seamus Finnigan and Ron Weasley slept in until Harry was done in the shower. Neither of the boys asked for them to wait, so Harry walked off with Neville and Dean in a blatant, sad attempt to find the Grand Hall from the night before.
The rest of class was exceptionally tense while they made boil cure potions. It seemed like Professor Snape was looking for anything to say to deduct points from Gryffindor, but never successfully found one. Harry was sure if Draco hadn't purposely worked with him, Professor Snape would have been hounding him as much as possible.
The instant their hands came in contact, a worm of joy settled into the back of Harry's head, which he poked at before it could fade away, and recieved what could be considered opposite to the feelings he got from Ron. A wash of acceptance and excitement flooded in to pool around Harry's brain, which made his mind feel as if it was submerged in a sea of warm sap, but not uncomfortably so. A blanket of sympathy and comfort would often find a way into their relationship; friendly love turned into it's brotherly counterpart; the thrill of adventure swamped around - Harry could've sworn he felt an echo of cheerful laughter in there.
“Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.” He whispered to himself. It wasn’t anything he’d ever learned, and he wondered what it meant.
"What are these?" Harry asked Ron. He forewent the brought upon emotions in favor of still talking to him for now, and held up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. "They're not really frogs, are they?"
"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?" Said the twins.
“This is muggle money?” He asked as Harry handed it over.
"Slytherin isn't your home, it's your house?" Hermione said in confusion.
“Don’t tell me you fell for his trick, Draco.” Professor Snape drawled teasingly. Draco flushed as all the pieces clicked into place. All the teachers were suspicious in their own ways, because all of them had things going for them that proved they were the ones after it. Quirrell had been so under the radar none of them had questioned it. He had been
As a unit the six students began to make noise. Harry and Neville shouted at it to keep its attention, and it wobbled its head back and forth as it listened to both of them. While they did that, Hermione and Pansy were attempting to take the club away from the troll by using the levitation spell they'd learned throughout that day, and Blaise and Draco used the fire hex they'd learned from Herbology to get him to back away and keep him from attacking.
"N-no... You seemed eager back there." Neville said quietly. He flushed to his forehead not soon after.
Blooper:
"It doesn't matter what you focused on, Severus Snape would not purposely cause his students harm to get me on the field. He didn't want me on the field to begin with, he just knew my father would hear about it if he didn't, and when it comes to what I want, my father is very picky." Draco explained to them. That clearly put a damper in their thoughts about his head of house, and he would admit he was a little peeved they even went there to begin with.
"Maybe. I wouldn't go alone." Harry responded. Draco pursed his lips at that, and he narrowed his eyes at Harry. It felt like a ploy to get him to visit the giant, but Harry seemed too genuine for that to be the case.
Harry stared at the professor who had so sharply asked him to answer a question that seemed impossible to answer. Was that supposed to be obvious? Was it common knowledge? Was it something in the book he had yet to read?
Draco shook his head fiercely and walked back to his starting position at the director's word.
Professor Snape "tossed" away the thing he was gnawing on, brought out his pocket watch, which he twirled in his hands. He whisper-mimed some words that some could decipher as "My precious." but none were the wiser to what on Earth he could be charading.
Harry only noticed when there was slobber on his shoulder. He didn't need to look up to know it was the dog. He'd seen the dog drool last time.
"Want a hand?"
"There's a troll in the dungeons, we should be leaving." Hermione whispered to them.
Harry mentally jumped when the hat began to talk to him.
Harry, thankfully, knew who that teacher was because some of his classmates had already had the experience to meet him. Most of them came out alive, but the few that didn't did not like Professor Snape or Slytherin's thereafter.
(See the end of the chapter for
"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort-" Harry continued. He stopped when Ron gasped.
"I never learned. I never wanted to until now, but it's not like it's easy to talk to him during school." Draco responded.
potions homework to get to that night, so they all simultaneously agreed to leave the bathroom to see what was taking so long.
"Coming, Mum." They chorused loudly, and then turned and left like they were on fire. Harry took a breath, closed the door of the compartment, and wiggled his way into the corner, next to the window. Hedwig hooted from beside him, and he subconsciously stuck his finger through the cage. She nipped lightly at the given appendage, and he responded by brushing his finger over the top of her head.
Almost like clockwork Draco walked over to them, alone mind you. He didn't say anything as a greeting, but pushed Harry a bit so he could sit down with them. He didn't take any food from the table, which made them think he had already eaten. Still, it was a welcomed occurrence.
"Yeah. Don't all wizards have it?" Harry asked. When Neville shook his head in bewilderment Harry felt dread fill his stomach. Oh no, that wasn't normal. He just had to be weird even among the people he was supposed to be the most similar to.
He looked down once the line stopped, and they watched as Professor McGonagall set down a stool with a hat- the one Neville had likely meant- on top. The hat looked old, patched, and frayed, and was definitely something Harry's Aunt Petunia would have never allowed in the house.
He then made the mistake of opening the Chocolate Frogs and a frog got loose. Harry spent a few minutes trying to catch it, and when he finally sat back down -with a mouth full of frog-, Ron was finished and looked over Harry’s packages.
"Not Slytherin?" The hat echoed. "Are you sure? You could do great things from there."
"No we won't," She said confidently. She pulled her wand from her sleeve and pointed it at the door. "Alohomora!"
“But- we were trying to help.” Harry said, flabbergasted.
He stared at the Headmaster a little differently after that. He hadn’t considered the wizard would be a big piece of his life, just a background figure. But according to what he felt, which had never been wrong before, Professor Dumbledore was much more of a piece of Harry’s future than he’d imagined.
"Uhh," Draco said, causing the cast to collectively groan. "What am I supposed to say again?"
"Neville... You're not dumb. You lack some bravery to be smart, but you're not dumb." Hermione told him. Harry smiled between the two.
"Ask Hagrid what it was. He likes Harry." Draco told them.
Along the way towards one of the larger staircases, the two boys tried to slip by a group of Slytherins. By try, it means Harry bumped shoulders rather painfully with one of them, and was brought around quite suddenly to face Draco Malfoy. The two stared at each other for a good long second, and Harry watched as emotions danced across Draco's face. Disbelief, anger, surprise, a glitter in his eye, and immediately it was all put behind a mask. Harry was impressed by that last part.
Following DADA was Herbology with Ravenclaws. Professor Sprout had a name and style that screamed "plants", and was spirited enough that Harry questioned why the word spirited meant energetic if the spirits of Hogwarts tended to be apathetic. She gave attention to each student, helped them in the practical tasks of caring for plants, but also challenged them with questions. Neville perked up noticeably in this class, more confident and at ease. He seemed to know what he was doing, and Harry had a feeling that he'd end up asking Neville for help in the future.
He got off the floor and continued his way to the front of the room. The classroom was full of muffled laughter.
"Longbottom, Neville!" Professor McGonagall called out. Neville passed Harry a willful smile, and walked up the stairs with a face as red as tomatoes. He sat down and the hat was placed on his head. And continued to sit with the hat on his head for many multiple minutes afterwards. It was clear Neville was aware of the time passing too, because he kept growing redder and redder as time went by.
“Miss Granger, I’m not letting students, let alone
“What do we do to stop him?” Hermione and Harry asked as one. The two looked at each other and shared a friendly smile.
"Yes. He was the one who took me to get my stuff back in August." Harry explained. Draco's face twisted into a weird expression Harry had learned was distaste.
"I thought I would have to choose. Between you and my home. It's all my housemates ever said." Draco said quietly. It was then that they realized that Draco had been facing this the last two months of school, and not just the last two weeks he'd been avoiding them at all costs.
"Well, if you're sure, better be: GRYFFINDOR!" The hat shouted aloud.
"What was it?" He asked.
Everyone was following the quaffle, so no one but Draco -probably- saw that Brook was having trouble with her broom. She kept scooting farther and farther up her broom, and he could still see the worry take her features. Seconds after it began Brook was dangling from her broom with one hand as it shook violently. Draco could hear Lee Jordan try to call attention to her as she began to jerk the broom closer to the ground, so if she fell it wasn't one hundred feet above the ground.
The next morning Draco did sit with them at the table. Space was made easily for the blond Slytherin, and none of the other Gryffindors questioned it verbally. At least, not for the first day or so. After about a week of congruent sitting with them it did raise questions, but none of the Gryffindors in first year would explain it. He was a friend to Harry, Hermione, and Neville, that should have been reason enough.
“Or put it on each of the things put up by teachers? That way you know when someone goes through them?” Neville offered immediately after. Professor Snape watched them answer to make sure they weren’t about to try this out for themselves. None of them looked ready to jump out and practice what they preached, so he sat back. The first years, to his great humor, all breathed in as one when he did.
"I wanted to. He was hardly fair to attack you when Ron was whispering to Dean behind us." Draco answered after so long Harry had forgotten what he'd even said.
"What has your house been doing?" Harry asked as a sinking feeling entered his stomach. Draco looked at Harry once more, and then wiggled to help Neville from his endless sliding to the floor.
"Bye." Harry said and Ron with varied degrees of enthusiasm. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them, and disappeared farther down the train. Harry saw Ron's fingers tap at his knee, and he relented himself for the soon to be questions.
They stood on the outside of the door and waited for Filch to catch them. No one was there though, they were safe. Filch had left because no student was supposed to be behind that door. Because of the
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. His eight foot figure dwarfed the tiny first years.
"I'm Harry Potter." Harry responded and thrusted his hand out. He then mentally slapped himself, because the ghost probably knew who he was.
"Yeah, I did." She answered as she casually flipped her bushy hair over her shoulder. The other three watched her like she was crazy, but she didn't care.
That's exactly what they did too. They only had to wait about thirty minutes, which Harry and Neville used to boost Hermione's confidence, and then they left for flying class. When they arrived they found the person they'd been looking for the night before wasn't there: Draco Malfoy.
Of course, it also woke the dog because it creaked loudly when he opened it. Not that Harry knew because he was staring down the long tunnel that was under the door. Hermione and Draco did though, and they tried to catch his attention without making too much noise.
Silence bit at the air like poison. Harry was deathly aware of Hermione waving her hand in the air, that Draco was uncomfortable, that Neville was even more terrified, and that the rest of the room was still. It was just him, and the professor who glared at him.
The rest of class was exceptionally tense while they made boil cure potions. It seemed like Professor Snape was looking for anything to say to deduct points from Gryffindor, but never successfully found one. Harry was sure if Draco hadn't purposely worked with him Professor Snape would have been hounding him as much as possible.
“His family are... dark. It could really be anything.” Ron explained cautiously. He was aware of how the four friends stood up for one another, he didn’t want to make Harry mad by saying the wrong thing, but he didn’t want to hide the truth from Harry either.
The group of four students and one teacher walked quickly through the school. They were behind Professor Snape so they had no idea what he looked like, but every student they came across in the hall practically flew out of the way when they saw him. The reactions from those around them made the four think they were in massive trouble, but they were moving too fast to get enough breath to ask anything.
“This one is from Neville,” Ron said, and pointed at a square shaped gift to divert the attention from the cauldron.
"Heads down!" Hagrid yelled as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to take them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
"N-no," He said quietly, then with a bit more air in him, "But I did find someone else who was willing to help."
Draco never sat at the table with them after that Friday. In fact, if anything, he seemed more distant than before. In classes he was great, and he still boasted whenever he got points or gifts, but he didn't seem too enthusiastic to hang out with the three Gryffindor's. Hermione mentioned it was probably because he lost a house point for a Gryffindor, and that put him on the Slytherin hit list for a while. It made Harry sad to think Draco was punished for helping him, so he never pushed it when Draco didn't hang out with them outside of class.
Harry handed over the rest of the frogs, and turned over his card and read:
None of the houses fit, and he wondered if he'd be cast out, because he didn't fit. What if he was already a failure in the community? It hadn't even been one day.
Well Harry didn't think he was anything. He wasn't brave or daring, or ready minded and well learnt, or cunning or patient. He liked to think himself loyal, but had never needed a reason to put that to the test, and while he wanted to find real friends, he remembered everything Hagrid had said about Slytherin. Every bad witch and wizard that ever came out of Hogwarts was a Slytherin.
"Keep quiet, maybe it'll walk by." Hermione whispered. As one, the group faced the entrance of the bathroom, each with a wand out.
" it read, "
"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" One of the twins asked.
"We went looking for you after." Harry backed. Hermione's face twitched between sad and happy, and Harry walked forwards to wrap his arms around both of them.
Ron grumbled when he looked at their timetable, "We have Slytherin with double potions."
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost- I say, what are you all doing here?" A second ghost, one that looked like a failed jester, took notice of the grouplet.
"I can promise that. No more hiding." Draco responded easily. Hermione let go of them, and they began to creep in farther away from the bathroom. At splitting point, where Gryffindors went upstairs and Slytherins went downstairs, they stopped and said goodbye to one another.
"I'd never heard that." Harry said.
Except... The woman placed her hand on Harry’s shoulder. In the reflection, his shirt crinkled, but in real life, nothing happened. He reached up and placed his hand on his shoulder, over her fingers. He felt nothing. They weren’t really there, it was only an image in the mirror.
The director sighed.
"Why does he hate Neville and me?" Harry asked. Draco shrugged quite exaggeratedly at that.
Harry overheard to conversation around him, but had grown too tired to really enthuse such talk. He looked up to the teacher's table to see how likely they were to be let go soon so he could sleep. Hagrid drank from his goblet as if in a drinking match, though no one was playing with him; Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore; A wild looking professor with frizzy hair talked to a squirrely looking professor in a turban. Harry had seen the man in a turban at the Leaky Cauldron, over a month ago, and could swear his name was Professor Quirrell. On the other side of Professor Quirrell was a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin, overall an unpleasant looking teacher to say the least.
Harry looked over at Draco, and then turned his head to him. He made direct eye contact with him. Draco looked up to the stars in exasperation.
"Thank you." Harry finished. Draco paused mid movement while turning the fire off. He continued the rest of the move and turned off the fire, and then he waved to Harry to put the porcupine quills into the concoction. Harry did it without a question. Draco hadn't led him astray thus far.
"W-who would put a dog where student's c-could so easily wander?" Neville asked with a shiver.
Harry and Draco did sit next to one another, much to the rest of the class's surprise. Neither boy cared much for the looks they were given, they were both happy with the situation in their own way. Neville did sit on Harry's other side though, with Hermione next to him, not so surprised with the arrangements. The rest of the students sat on either side of the Slytherin and Gryffindor duo, in correspondence to their houses. Seeing how much the two houses divided themselves asserted just how much they were estranged. It made Harry grateful that his two friends appeared to accept his wish of being friends with Draco.

Harry laughed and pressed a quick peck to his cheek. “You love me for it,” Harry grinned.
Draco wasn’t sure he liked any of the implications of that statement, even if he had perfected his wandless warming charms over the course of last Easter, after Potter had taken his wand. There must have been a look on his face because Potter quickly lost his smirk and he began to flail and apologise.

It is during his time at Shell Cottage that Harry runs out of parchment and begins to draw on himself.  The images swirl across his skin, bend in the creases of his arms, twist across the panes of his stomach.  It is difficult to draw on skin, to find the pressure that will transfer the ink from the quill without hurting him or cutting into him.  And the angles are awkward, and the images change with his movements, with his breath.  But the ink washes off with his sweat, when he bathes, and it isn’t permanent.  Sometimes he wishes it was.
“Right! It’s so fucking magical here.” Harry did not understand why they were both so drunk. They clearly were, however, so maybe it didn't matter how it happened. He just didn't normally swear in front of older people. He wasn't
They were served a full Irish breakfast in the dining room the next morning. Draco had to pass on the blood sausage, but he helped himself to the porridge with Bailey’s and brown sugar. Harry, of course, ate everything including the blood sausage. Draco refused to kiss him until he brushed his teeth.
Their first real trip together was an accidental train journey from York to London.

“I refuse to wait in line to kiss a semi-magical stone just for a little bit of luck and a very good chance of getting some sort of lip-herpes.”
When they joined Maude and Elin at their table for breakfast, both women greeted them with cheerful grins and playful ribbing.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Even knowing how bad it sounded, Harry was glad the trip was basically over. He couldn’t wait to be back home with Draco, away from all the people. No matter how lovely they were, they were still right there, all the time, and Harry was looking forward to locking the world out from tonight until he had to leave for work on Monday. Just him and Draco, at home together. They could visit with their friends and family throughout the week and over next weekend.
It was during his fifth year that Harry began to draw at school.  He learned the strokes and pressures needed to commit the castle to parchment, the angles and strokes of quill, the weight of inks and parchments.  He learned to prepare his own inks, to create blends of different pigmentation and different textures.  He learned about different parchments, different quills, different charms to animate images.  He studied different styles and techniques and periods of wizarding art.  He learned about portrait making, and the magical processes involved, and how portraits interact with each other, and why.  But even as he learned more about oil and canvas, he stuck with parchment and quill and black ink.
Harry has always loved to draw.  Okay, that’s not quite true—Harry has always loved to escape.  Hiding in the school library from Dudley and his gang, reading fantasy novels that weren’t allowed in the house because magic, imagination, anything even remotely “unnatural” or “not normal” were expressly prohibited and seen as dangerous by his relatives, eventually became enjoyable to Harry; it offered him access to a different world.  When he found the superhero comic books and the worlds of men and monsters, heroes and villains, good and evil, he learned to love drawing.

He learned to read Muggle rail maps, the map for the London underground, and even actual road maps.

“Potter,” Draco greeted quietly, no venom in his tone, just bland politeness.

For a while.

“No ma’am, I haven’t had the pleasure yet. We went straight to Cardiff from London and didn’t stop in anywhere on the way.”
"Er, yes, I think so," Ron said. "I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
"Are all your family wizards?" Harry asked. He found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.
“Yes. I taught him years ago. He’s much more than the quivering mess he portrays.” Professor Snape sneered. The teacher could remember the old Ravenclaw well.
“I see socks,” He said finally. Harry wondered if he was lying, because it sounded like a funny want. “Long wool socks of all colors and shapes. You can never have too many of them.”
He looked down at Harry, and his eyes did a little dance. Harry looked down and saw he was still see-through.
The present was a shiny silver that seemed to move, and probably did. The top of it sat a bow, and what held the box together was a wax seal of a very important looking insignia. It was green and black with a large ‘M’ on the banner, and around it all were dragons and snakes. It read words in Latin he had no hope of figuring out.
“...I’ll see what can be done.” Professor Snape agreed stiffly. The time frame they had was almost nonexistent. At most they could put one alert in, but they wouldn’t be able to go through the whole thing in two days without being suspicious and including Professor Quirrell. In fact, trying to include any of the teachers could be quite difficult because of how many actually knew about it.
Harry smiled and held out his hand, "I'm Harry."
"What if he did kill it?" Hermione asked.
"In order for him to know the counter spell he had to of heard the actual spell, so it had to be a teacher near him that is also versed in curses." Neville said imploringly. They pondered that information for a good long moment.
Their time with Hagrid was interesting. They arrived on the dot at 3 pm, and Hagrid had a shifty time getting them into his home because of his dog, Fang. He lived in a one room hut where everything was displayed for them to see; from the kitchen to the living room (what little there was of one), to his bedroom. Still, he chatted with them happily, even though he and Draco had been hesitant of each other in the beginning, and fed them rock cakes - which were about as edible as they sounded.
"I did? I did! Thank you Draco." Neville said as he got up. He snatched the Remembrall out of Draco's hand, which stunned the blond, and the normally clumsy boy began the long trek back to his dorm before first class. Draco looked between Harry, Hermione, and Neville, and then took off to follow the Gryffindor with a 'wait, don't go alone!'.
The three of them were happy to forget about the dog, but remembered which hallway it had been in. They retired for the evening, and vouched to get to Draco the next day, on Halloween.
"He's coming now." One of the twins said. There were several moments of silence Harry took to mean they waited for Percy.
"Wait,
"You know that black-haired boy from the barrier?" Said one of the twins.
"Did you guys ask Hagrid?" Draco asked. Hermione peeked from behind her hands.
The Remembrall turned red, and the company stared at it.
As he passed one of the pasties to Ron, he got his first brush with Ron's hand. A sense of distrust rose in the back of Harry's mind, which he latched onto. It warped around itself into betrayal and estrangement, and pressed down on his brain heavily enough that it felt like it would physically push him to the ground, even though he knew it was all in his mind. A few soft wisps of childhood happiness laced the emotions, but it was so vague he almost didn't notice it.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked. “Wait, you know this is my father’s cloak?”
"It s-stopped when you got on the field, though." Neville said finally.
They stood in front of the opposing door for a long time, with all their hearts pounding painfully in their chests. Hermione and Harry because they knew what the dog looked like, Draco because he had no idea what to expect, and Neville because he might just lose all his friends in one fell swoop. All of this seemed like a good enough reason to turn back, for all of them.
"Our entrance is in the middle of a busy staircase, there's no way we could remain hidden if that was the case." Hermione said.
"It's ok if it means we helped a friend. We can go out for flying." Harry said easily, and then grinned at the idea. He loved flying, and was going to try out for Quidditch that next year.
"One." Neville whispered shakily.
"They're turning on me for being friends with you. All except Blaise and Pansy." Draco told them as he helped Neville back into a steady standing position.
"Because you set a fire in the teachers' section. That doesn't mean it was Professor Snape." Draco told them.
going to reward them and detention was the ruse?
The student whose name was called walked forward, and with that the flood of emotions in Harry disappeared. It was the platinum blond boy he had stood behind when they walked in. He swaggered up the stairs to the hat with a smug look across his face, and had barely sat down with the hat on his head before it shouted, "SLYTHERIN!"
"Quidditch will probably make it worse than." Harry introduced the topic casually. Draco shrugged, because that was the least of his worries with Quidditch.
"You don't want this, it's all dry," Ron said. "She hasn't got much time, you know, with five of us."
"We went down the hall a month ago trying to find you and saw what was behind the door at the end of it." Neville said in a rush. The other two looked at him like he'd betrayed them, and he shrugged. Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," The other one said.
"All I know is it's not Professor Snape. It has to be someone else." Draco said, as if that finished that. The other three didn't have anything to say that hadn't already been said, so it did finish the conversation.
"Ah, yes. Harry Potter," Professor Snape set his sights on the offending person. "Our new celebrity."
Harry looked at the beds in the dorm and wondered which one was his father’s once.
“You got one from Draco,” Ron said with a tone Harry couldn't pinpoint. He took the package up from the ground and looked it over. It was a bit bigger than anything else either of them had gotten and had a strange symbol on it. Ron explained, “It’s the Malfoy crest.”
" he whispered to the hat, both in mind and in voice.
Professor Snape stood from beside the troll with a slight limp, and stared hard at the six. He had a look of disappointment for his Slytherins, and a look of discontempt for the Gryffindors. Professor Quirrell watched them from behind Professor McGonagall.
Ten minutes early became fifteen minutes late for the teacher himself, and the class became rowdy. The door burst open, which let in a cold breeze as Professor Snape stepped into the classroom. He swept past the students quickly until he reached his desk, at which point he stepped on his cloak and tripped.
“What do you see?” Harry asked. Professor Dumbledore didn’t answer for a long time. He tilted his head and aahed at the mirror for a good time.
Professor Snape's black eyes landed on him, "Potter!" he barked. He made his way along the side of the room to the back, with his steady gaze, "What would I get if I added a powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
." He heard Hermione whisper from behind him to another student. Harry found such a thing hard to believe, but there it was, right before him on the ceiling.
"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," Ron said. "He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again, and I've got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting."
"It cost your house points," Harry said. Draco looked over at Professor Snape, who was at his table and staring at the first years like a hawk. He seemed very hesitant to speak.
"Is he your friend?" Draco asked. Harry tottered his head on his shoulders for a few seconds, and finally decided to shrug. When he'd shook hands with Hagrid the night they met, he discovered that Hagrid was a trustworthy relationship, but there was a
Blood rushes to Harry’s cheeks. And to other places. “Ah,” he says, leaning in across the table. “That sounds vaguely familiar. I believe a reintroduction may be in order, though.”

Harry grins. “It’ll be our fourth date, though, right?”
Tuesday morning, before Harry leaves for the clinic, an owl taps on his window and drops off a parcel. There’s a note, a pouch that clinks when he sets it down, and something else wrapped in tissue paper.
“What are you—”
“He’s… he’s doing me a big favor.”
Hermione is clearly holding in a laugh. “We thought it was both, Harry, sorry for not being clearer.”
Harry stares at him, waiting for someone else to say anything in dissent, but no one does. "Wrong," Harry grins. "I'm an excellent cook, though."
“Well, she’s a snake, Malfoy.”
“Roommates are assigned by gender,” Padma explains. “I’m the only one here with no gender; thus, I have no roommate.”
“Yes, I read the letter, thanks,” Draco replied. “I’m on my best behavior, Potter.”
those verbal sparring matches.
“Sorry – it’s not obvious, I guess. Just a weirdly deep topic for the two of us to get into, isn’t it?”
“Please just leave me alone.”
Malfoy extricates the snake from his neck and Harry finally gets a good look at her. “She’s
Draco pays for lunch- again- and when they make it to the apparition point, Harry wants so badly to kiss him that he has to look at his shoes when he says goodbye.
“And you got caught?”
The front door opened again, letting out a beaming Molly Weasley. She looked exactly as she had when he met her back in second year, though with maybe a few more wrinkles around her eyes.
Harry’s lying down in St. Mungo’s, bruises creeping up his neck and onto his jaw.
that-”
This Friday’s charity gala benefits children orphaned by the war. Hermione’s written up a speech for Harry, since he’s Britain’s Favorite War Orphan (capitals courtesy of the Daily Prophet, in their pre-gala column).
“I know,” Potter says, almost kindly. “And I should apologize too… I was a dick to you as well. And I’ll never forgive myself for almost killing you.”
“And he doesn’t like me like that. But he’s going to get
Harry’s jaw drops. “Now?”
“No, that about sums it up.” Draco’s smirking. “I do some potions consulting every now and then, but philanthropy is a full time job.”
And yet something about… being something
And Draco seems totally at ease. Totally fine with having lunch together as friends.
? The dinner cruise lasts
“Sure, Molly, come in,” Harry called, as casually as he could. He scooched closer to Malfoy, trying to settle in a way that would make it look like they were comfortable with each other. Malfoy put his right arm around Harry’s shoulders, catching on to the plan to look like a couple, but it felt stiff and awkward.
“Blimey, I’ve heard of those!” Ron exclaims, mouth full. “Charlie was studying fossils in South Africa of some extinct dragon and they came across a nest!”
“Mate, are you good?”
Harry heaved Draco onto the rescue boat. The crewmate helped them make it up the ladder, and the second they made it to the top, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and clung to him.
Harry turned to Malfoy, who had paled five shades. He looked at Harry with wide eyes, then turned to Molly. “Yes, thank you so much,” he told her, voice sounding strained.
Breathing hard, Harry looks up at Draco's face. Draco bites his lip, then sits down on the bed and gestures for Harry to join him.
“In fourth year, you wouldn’t shut up about how fit Cedric Diggory was,” Ron says softly.
Malfoy's jaw drops slightly. So do a few others. "You're as Gryffindor as they come, Potter," says Parkinson. "You must be shitting us."
they messed up.
“Potter, get
“Yes, I do.”
“Do you remember that day, when Dave walked in on us?” Harry asks Draco over dinner, after he and the snakes are all moved in.
And if he doesn’t like ‘they,’ then he’ll know. But it doesn’t hurt to try.
“Could you stop staring at me, please?”
“Harry, that’s not pathetic, I-”
, but he’s not sprouting shit against marginalised groups. Which, like, yeah. I guess the bar really is that low, but it’s Malfoy, isn’t it?”
“I don’t— Ron, I think I like him. Like,

Or maybe the boat was getting to him, too.
They blink their eyes open, realising there are arms wrapped around them. They slowly turn their head, and Draco’s there, head resting against Harry’s shoulder. His face is peaceful. Soft. Beautiful, even.
“Are you
“I- that’s not- I just- for competition reasons! He was in better shape than I was!”
“What are you talking about?”
The snake’s name is Jean, and she’s a Maltese Fire Python. She’s just as large as she looks, maybe a few feet long, though she looks tiny in the gigantic exam room (
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with Jean. Malfoy flushes a bit when Harry tells him this.
Harry likes everything about Draco. His laugh, his sarcasm, that glint in his eye when he’s making fun of Harry. He listens to Harry, and cares about his snakes, and he’s probably the most beautiful man Harry’s ever seen.
“No comment on being the war orphan at the war orphan gala?”
“On a Sunday evening?” Harry sighed. Draco just stared at the floor.
with you, Dave, is there?” Malfoy huffs. “I’m wearing the clothes, aren’t I?!”
Draco is edging into dangerous territory. He and Potter sit on the common room floor chatting nearly every night. And instead of snapping insults at each other, they’re snapping… well, they’re still snapping insults, really. But it’s lighthearted, and it makes Draco feel warm inside every time Potter calls him a tosser.
It’s not a particularly big clinic, only a few examination rooms, the lobby, and Harry’s office. That’s all he really needs with a practice so specific. Harry still rushes to the lobby, though. If he has no appointments, then this must be an emergency walk-in.
Harry had not been aware. But at this point, he didn’t care. Not after Draco nearly drowned. “We’re engaged for real, Gilbertson.” He turned to Arthur. “I’m sorry, Arthur. I know why you don’t believe us. But we’re getting married. Tomorrow. Now, we’ve had a rough day, and could really use some hot showers. See you at the wedding.”
Harry inhales sharply. He’d only just started to realize he felt confined by gender, and hearing that word already gives a sense of freedom.
“Thought it was a sleeping potion,” he replies slowly.
There was a bathroom attached to the bedroom, and Molly left them for the night. The Burrow was nicer than Draco had expected, but, well… “You can take the floor,” Draco said, half-joking. “I’ll sleep on the bed.”
, he named his practice. And now, sitting in his private office, plaque on his door, he’s... happy.
for Harry again. And again.
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione answers softly. “Although, if we’re being honest, it was probably before then.”
Draco picked the restaurant again, a Mexican place in downtown London. Harry ordered enchiladas and they’re brilliant.
“She’s going to be fine,” Harry begins. “Her last shed didn’t quite finish off properly. If you could raise the humidity in her enclosure, I’m sure that will help get the last of it off.”
Harry huffs a laugh. “Fair enough. Yeah, I finished training a few months ago. Went on my first mission. They were all excited to send me out into the field.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked after a while, through his own chattering teeth.
Draco’d had a year to get himself ready for his trial. But even after all that waiting, and all the days of the trial itself, judgment day still came too quickly.
Harry peeks in the pouch and sees it’s filled with Galleons- Harry has no idea how many, but it’s certainly more than he charges his clients. Although, to be honest, he totally forgot to ask Malfoy for payment in the first place. He moves to unwrap the other item, and finds a throw pillow inside.
“So you and the Malfoy boy are getting married, I’ve been told.”
“Matian Gilbertson. Your dad killed his, so he’s got a bit of a major grudge against you.”
Draco’s brows furrow, and then he remembers the bathroom. He chuckles. “Water under the bridge. I did try to use an Unforgivable on you that day. Plus, after saving my life, I think we’re even.”
“How’s the roommate, Patil?” Malfoy asks.
Harry feels exactly like he did when they told him he was gay. He sits down on Hermione’s bed in shock. “Oh my god,” he says. “Have I liked Malfoy since sixth year?”
“I know. I do. I’ve done some, already.”
“Thank you, Peter,” Harry said. “We really appreciate it.”
Harry, though, had a lot more trouble choosing a career. After deciding he was done flirting with mortality, he rather thought that being an Auror was out of the question. He did nothing for a while, just stayed at Grimmauld Place and refurbished it into something passable for a home. But he got bored quickly after finishing that project, and Kreacher was less than thrilled to have Harry home all the time.
“You could be a potter,” Draco says with a smirk.
It’s Potter’s turn for Truth or Dare, and he picks Draco. Draco’s eyebrows raise; they haven’t picked each other in any of these games since the night of the tripping. The night they started becoming friends.
And then, because Draco’s mouth betrays him and he’s too used to snapping at Potter, he says, “Scared, Potter?” And he instantly regrets it. Because Potter glares at him, and says “Never.” And now Potter’s coming across the circle, curly hair wild, crawling on his knees towards Draco with a look of determination, and Draco doesn’t even have time to back away before Potter’s hand is behind his neck and he’s
Draco rolls his eyes, but he’s smiling. “Excellent job of pointing out the obvious, thanks for that.”
want,” he continues.
“Sure, Harry, what’s going on?” Hermione looks concerned.
“More than big, I’d say,” Weasley replied. “As we’re his best friends, we supposedly have known about your relationship the entire time. We’re friendly. We call you Draco. You call us by our first names.”
Draco looks like he’s got a biting comeback, but he settles with, “Don’t you have money to throw at the
“Harry, I-”
“Wasn’t that rather the point of you sending them?”
Ginevra gave Draco a kind smile. “Of course. We’d be happy to have you.”
