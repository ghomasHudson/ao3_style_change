Harry was writhing again, moaning incoherently as he tried to rock up against Draco, his body trembling from the onslaught of pleasure. Draco leaned down onto his forearms, all the while continuing to fuck leisurely into Harry’s willing body.
Strong hands stopped Harry from rolling his hips, a smirk ghosting over Draco’s lips as a loud whine of disapproval echoed through the room.
“Oh, god, Draco,” Harry panted, shuddering as nimble fingers danced along his aching cock. “Yes, yes, I liked it. Loved it.”
Slowly, Draco allowed his hands to wander, trailing soft touches over Harry’s sides and back, rubbing soothing patterns into any skin he could find. Harry was putty in his hands, letting out a happy hum as nimble fingers started combing through his hair.
A never-ending stream of appreciative moans accompanied his words as he mouthed along Harry’s jaw, littering the skin in teasing nips and bites. A trail of glistening marks was left in his wake, his teeth grazing and bruising, all but claiming Harry as his own.
He loosely took a hold of Harry’s dick, letting his lube-covered fingers ghost along the entire length before firmly cupping his balls, coating them in the slightly scented lotion.
He had half a mind to blindfold the git for that. Just to be petty. But a larger part of him wanted Harry to see him, wanted Harry to know who was doing this to him, wanted him to watch as Draco
He could feel Harry quiver against him, could sense the tremors against the tips of his fingers, and with barely maintained control, Draco pulled away again.
“Draco,” Harry whined needily – his usually authoritative voice reduced to nothing more than a quiet plea for Draco to bask in.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry mewled eagerly, trembling against his restraints as the cold seeped into his skin, his dick jerking up wantonly.
And now, after hours of wearing it, the lube must have seeped into his walls, coating them in a nice, thick layer and making him all wet and slippery inside. Gods, Draco couldn’t wait to plunge into the scorching heat.
Breathing became almost irrelevant as Harry’s tongue twirled against his. He let his nails scrape against the back of Harry’s head as he licked his way deeper inside the other’s mouth, eager to explore and claim it as his own.
He slowly let his eyes trail over swollen lips down to the splattering of wax on Harry’s heaving chest. The white dots marked the heated flesh, and if Draco had his way, those wouldn’t be the only marks left on Harry’s skin tonight.
Humming, Draco tangled their legs together and let his arm fall around Harry’s waist, intent on keeping the other close. He nuzzled into Harry as the words kept coming, all but melting into the warm embrace.
“Nh. Nh- ah,” Harry shuddered as Draco’s other thumb stroked across the sensitive flesh where his inner thigh met his groin, teasingly close to where he knew Harry yearned for it the most. His cock twitched in a valiant effort to demand attention but Draco bent further down over Harry’s chest, ignoring the dripping length and the puddle of precome collecting beneath it.
“Ah, mmh, y-yes. I did,” Harry moaned brokenly. His skin was flushed now, sweat beading on his forehead with the effort of remaining completely still for Draco.
Harry had all but collapsed onto the bed, an exhausted yet blissed out expression adorning his features. His chest was still heaving from the exertion of his climax, but his eyes were closed contentedly. He looked complete and utterly boneless, still deep in the throes of subspace.
“And how eager you must have been, for me to come along, drag you out and finally impale you on my cock.”
Plus, he had plans for tonight. Plans he intended to follow through. And imperative to said plan was the tiny little item nestled in his front robe pocket.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted softly, finally realizing what the issue was. “You were perfect. You gave me exactly what I needed, exactly what I wanted.”
Shaking his head, he righted himself and stepped back. “Not yet. I’m not quite done with you,” he promised darkly.
He was panting now, shifting his angle ever so slightly, filling and refilling Harry’s tight arse over and over again, making him moan and keen.
With a smile Draco let his fingers trail softly over Harry’s sensitive flesh, every touch evoking more beautiful sounds from the writhing man in front of him. His hands ghosted over Harry’s straining length, feather-light over the blazing heat, collecting another bead of precome on the tip of his finger before licking it up with a filthy moan.
“They would surely appreciate a good show. How I’d pound into you, over and over again, until you’re so fucked out that you couldn’t even walk straight anymore.”
Grey eyes raked shamelessly over the naked form of Harry Potter, writhing wantonly on the aforementioned bed, his hunger no doubt all but poorly concealed. He let his gaze trail slowly over the lithe body wrapped so prettily in the emerald, silk bindings. Bindings that Draco had conjured - at Harry’s behest, even. And the mere reminder of that; how
He slowly spread the lube over Harry’s nipples and then let one finger trail down to smear some beneath the tip of Harry’s cockhead. Just a small dollop, wouldn’t want to overdo it so soon.
“That’s right, Harry. It’s me who’s doing this to you. Not some nameless ‘sir’ or ‘master’. Not Malfoy.
Draco’s eyes flashed. Heat surged through him, and he had to swallow hard to not get distracted by the wanton display, focusing instead on keeping his voice steady, low and sultry, just how he knew Harry liked it.
Stepping forward, Harry jerked slightly as Draco wrapped his dry hand around Harry's length, gingerly sliding the cockring into place, securing it tightly around his balls and ever careful not to spread the lube all over Harry’s shaft.
He watched as Harry greedily gulped down the water, a few small droplets escaping his eager swallows and trickling down his chin.
Little gasps and tiny mewls were all the indication Draco got at how pleasurable and tantalizingly teasing his actions were, so he kept it up, alternating between a loose fist around Harry’s cockhead and letting his fingers dance and glide over the glistening ridge.
Harry’s breath hitched. He let out a soft, little whine, and while Draco usually loved the sound, right now he needed words.
Draco clicked his tongue in fond exasperation. “Harry,” he echoed, one pale eyebrow raised pointedly. He almost couldn’t believe the shagged-out-look was doing it for him these days.
He flicked his wand again, reversed the effects of the lube and watched as goose bumps spread all over Harry’s body.
The pet name slipped past his lips almost like second nature these days, and it elicited the exact same reaction he’d gotten the first time he’d accidentally used it all those months ago. Harry’s eyes closed in bliss, a pleased, little whimper escaping him as a tremor jolted through his body.
He loved edging Harry. He loved to watch him fall apart beneath his hands, loved to reduce him to tears as he begged for his release, wanting so desperately to be filled with Draco’s cock. And how responsive he was. So beautiful. And all for him. His own dick twitched at the thought of what Harry would look like when he was done with him, completely blissed and fucked out.
“She’s g-gone, father. And it’s my fault, it’s all my fault. It should’ve been me, should’ve been me...”
“Why should I let labels govern my life? I say, liberate the salad from its “side dish” status. Let it be a full salad.”
Until one night, he took his invisibility cloak and decided to go after the mysterious boy-only this time, it wasn't just him being nosy. He was genuinely concerned for him. It was time for dinner, and Harry had told Hermione and Ron that he grabbed a snack earlier. Said he wasn't feeling well, that he was just going to rest. Said he'd see them in the dorms. Harry quickly found Draco on the Marauder's Map, then apparated around the corner from him. Throwing the cloak over his shoulders, he watched as Draco glanced over his shoulder nervously and summoned the Room of Requirement.
She just nodded and wiped her hands on her apron, shooting Harry a sympathetic look but not bothering to stop her husband. The man’s gaze snapped to Draco.
The glamour he'd cast faded away, revealing the bruises all over his face and shoulder, which peeked out from under his sheer sweater.
“Don’t do this,” is all he said and the wizard’s eyes followed him back to the sofa, where jovial conversation waited an awkward minute to begin.
"Bathroom," he muttered in his ear, and walked hurriedly to the lavatories, breaking into a desperate run for the last eight metres.
"Don't let it get to your head, Potter. But...it's true that I don't seem to be going anywhere. And I know I definitely could. Go places, that is. We should go places. The two of us."
In front of him was an ivory-plated chair-more like a throne-with a pale blue velvet cushion and plush leather arms. Arms, which were stained rusty red, dried up rivulets that had streamed down the legs. What alarmed Harry was the splatter. Sure, drips were one thing. Drips could’ve even been a nosebleed. But splatters? Parts of it looked like someone had taken a spray bottle and misted the stuff on. His face was stricken when he turned back to the slytherin, who still held the case aloft. It was heavy and the muscles in his arm had begun to twitch, but it was as if he’d hardly noticed. Finally, Harry broke the quiet.
“Then who is!?” Draco shouted, finally raising his voice. He tried not to notice how Harry flinched. The boy’s eyes dropped to the ground and a nearby rock the size of a cat cracked in half, the stress visibly leaving Harry’s body. It wasn’t nearly enough, though.
That was a lie. Twenty-three, that was the number of times he’d seen the inner working of his wrist and bathed the attic in blood. Twenty-three times he’d lain gasping on the dusty floorboards, lungs punctured and sight blackening as he desperately tried to fix his father’s mess, cursing him with every
And so it continued. They made a habit of pairing up for potions and Slughorn made no effort to separate them, though he tended to rotate the other students. It was an unspoken thing they shared. Yet the odd things continued as well. Draco absent from study halls and most meals. Harry watching the doorway expectantly. Draco disappearing into thin air, leaving Harry staring quizzically at the wall.
Draco allowed himself to be hoisted to his feet and disrobed, his last shred of pride dissipating as he fumbled with the belt buckle like he’d forgotten how it worked.
The blade was in his flesh and the breath left his lungs. It stung, burned, until he forced himself to enjoy it, rolling his head back on a limp neck. His bloodied arm reached for the knob to the shower and he turned it, swaying dangerously when he stepped onto the cobbled stone floor and let the spray coat him.
His hands were replaced with Harry’s, and he realised that it was far more practical this way, given that Potter wasn’t functioning like a man whose muscles had atrophied and had developed Parkinson’s over the last eight minutes. He seriously pondered this before coming to the conclusion that neither Parkinson’s nor severe muscle atrophy occurred in that short of a time span.
He wiped sand from his eyes and followed Harry down to the breakfast bar, where Hermione pushed two plates of pancakes toward the stools and gestured for the both of them to sit. He thanked her and she just nodded, headed off to the couch to sit with Ron, who was eating-
“I wish. But the people who own the building have cameras on the front step. My father had to obliviate the entire security staff one time when he locked me out and I’d used my wand to open the door.”
The pale wizard stopped his pacing just to sit in the elegant caned chair that was skewed away from his desk, bouncing his leg and rubbing a twitching finger over his cleanly-shaven jaw.
He ruffled Harry’s unruly mop and stalked off to take care of his little ‘problem’, and the gryffindor clamped his hands over his ears to block out the noise in shame, hastily throwing the pyjamas he’d borrowed back on and burrowing into the covers, dreading the coming conversation.
He wrapped a towel around his waist, then took the biggest one he could find and draped it over his shoulders. Luckily, if he fanned it out, it covered up most of the damage.
Bruises, in varying stages of healing peppered his skin, his long, lithe arms under his short-sleeved shirt and through the holes in his distressed jeans. Draco blinked back tears and a burning lump in his throat and recast the glamour.
He started crying now, feeling like a helpless child again. Draco held him and they stayed there, but the contemplative look on his face remained.
“It’s not that simple. Of course I’m going back. There’s a bunch of complicated muggle bullshit that comes with being a legal guardian, and I’ve got to save Hedwig.”
“Well, it’s always sour, and it doesn’t always change completely. Ron once tried to turn a rock he found outside into an iced bun, but...well, that’s how he chipped his tooth.”
It was clear he wasn't going to fall asleep any time soon. Cautious not to wake his slumbering roommate, Harry stepped into his slippers and crept downstairs, invisibility cloak tight around his shoulders.
"But you know what, Draco? I was a kid. We both were. I hate myself for hurting you, but hurting myself won't change anything."
Harry looked over to Draco now, who tenderly felt the ridges of his orbital bone like it still hurt.
Harry just sighs and starts healing up the wounds. The injured wizard feels a strange tingling, an itching sensation when he gets to the big one, yet he remains perfectly still. Harry muttered a cleaning spell and Draco shimmied back into the grey Henley, using his own wand to vanish the bloodied socks.
Harry sighed and looked around. The only other customers were on the other side of the room, hungover graduates.
His eyes adjusted to the light, and there was a picture of himself at five years old displayed on the screen.
“Well, now we head to my family’s-well...my flat back in Canary Wharf. Then I’m taking you to New York for Christmas, and we’ll head back to Hogwarts a week late because a), fuck school and b) I need to speak with someone regarding my parents’ wills, and he won’t be back until the third.”
The bellman arrived with their luggage only two minutes later, apologising for the wait. Apparently there was some sort of a mix-up...it wasn’t important. He helped them remove their things from the cart and went on his way, and Draco put their cases in the closet. He’d unpack them later.
There was a muffled noise and for a moment he panicked just a bit, but he found Harry sprawled on the bed on his stomach.
He crossed the room and sat at the foot of the bed, catching a square of chocolate Draco had thrown at him.
It was dusk when Harry awoke and he found Draco going through old pictures on his phone. He panicked just a touch, recalling the time Dudley stole it and dropped it in the toilet, jeering him about his texts to Hermione. Harry told him she was just a friend and ‘I actually know girls. Unlike some people, I’m not desperate to try and fuck each one I meet!’. He still felt the fracture in his orbital bone from that day, and worse things in other places from that night.
Harry sniffled and pressed the heels of his hands into his sockets, sniffled, and regained his composure remarkably quickly. Too quickly for comfort.
"Erm...okay so...powdered slug...and then..." Harry talked to himself subconsciously, not acclimated to having someone stare at him with such silent intensity.
Draco felt a twinge of disgust in himself as he realised that he should be sad. The man who brought him into this wretched world and who cared for him up until the ripe old age of six…
Draco nodded and rubbed at his eyes, then burned them without looking in midair with a smokeless fire, collected the ashes in a Ziploc bag he’d found in the kitchenette. He sat down heavily.
There was something dangerous in the way Harry’s breath grew shaky, but his grip on the fragile cup between his thumb and forefinger broke it.
A muffled whimper and the distinct sound of Narcissa’s heels on the ceramic floor sent shivers down Harry’s spine. The children looked at each other nervously, and Hecatia put a hand over Draco’s.
It’s more complicated than a single-sentence answer. You’d need an eight-page essay and a few paintings just to explain the sentiment. But I think...I just...I feel like I deserve it, y’know?”
“No, it wasn’t. Finchley, Harrods.” he called, and Harry noted the way he rubbed uncomfortably at the scars that lay beneath his shirt, how his eyes clouded over in a tortured reverie.
The two crept down to the Room of Requirement, the only room with a fireplace in the school-apart from the teachers’-that didn’t have flooing restrictions. Pulling a small pouch of the powder from his satchel, Draco sprinkled it over them and said the words, and off they were whisked to the Malfoy Manor.
Draco looked up slowly, the most menacing glare he could manage pointed at Harry. Who started laughing.
"I'm s-sorry father...I didn't-you were right. You were right all along. Disappointment. I'm glad you left me a reminder."
Draco rolled his eyes and Harry remained a respectful distance away, fumbling through the recipe as per usual. Malfoy wasn't helping at all. He stuck to bemusedly watching Harry attempt to not fail the class, staying remarkably taciturn. The gryffindor had expected at least a dozen profane admonishments.
Draco struggled to battle the Lucius inside him, his sneering and violent whispers, reminding him of what he was waiting for when he got home, when this was finally over. He thought often about what he’d do. He could run off with Harry, be flatmates, as the two had not-so-jokingly joked. For a moment, he contemplated how upset he was going to feel about being disinherited as he knew he would, but then he remembered.
Harry ran up the stairs and was blocked by Dudley, who was flung into his room with the mutter of a spell from Harry’s chapped lips. The doors slammed shut and locked him in.
Harry's eyes were glassy, the damage in front of him overwhelming. Draco sighed, regaining his strength.
Harry was led to the base of the staircase to a closet, where Draco fished out his own raincoat and deliberated over the others.
“Yes! That.” The slytherin grinned obliviously and threw another rock into the river, and Harry thought that maybe his stomach churned even more than the water did.
Harry emerged from his room in jeans, a polo and a fleece, thundering down the stairs and walking up to give Hermione a hug. She whispered something in his ear, and Draco narrowed his eyes.
“I wouldn’t be so sure about that. I deserve something, some way to pay the consequences for what I’ve done. I suppose this is all I’ve got, for now.”
The small blade dug into his abdomen as he retched, and it just made the whole ordeal that much more miserable. Of course, it wasn't long before Harry walked in.
“No, Harry, you did. You did, and you never should have. You thought I was someone else and I think I know who.”
“Oh my-he told me it happened when he took on a troll in the dark forest one night, when he and you had gone to collect bark for a potion. He said you were attacked by some...creature. Said he got it protecting you.”
Harry stayed there, faintly smelling Draco’s cologne in the fabric. With a deep breath, he placed a kiss against the soft blue velvet and set off to console his boyfriend.
“Right. Well, you can’t exactly wear your school robes in the muggle world and I simply won’t be seen in public with you wearing
The wizard smiled, remembering the film he and Harry had watched the night before, the one about the man encased in metal, the one who fought hard as a hero and twice as hard to deny that he was one.
The great thing about the manor was that it was just big enough that three people could exist within it without having to confront each other’s presence for weeks at a time, but those nights...
He stumbled to the bathroom, shedding clothing as he went until he shut the door behind him, breathing heavily and having done nothing.
Harry groaned as the curtains were thrown open and buried his face in Draco’s silken pillows. He was more frustrated at the fact that there was no light coming through the window-the sun hadn’t even begun to rise. And here he was, conscious.
Harry sat on the other boy's bed, earning a glare from Draco when he walked out in chinos, cashmere socks and the poshest sneakers Harry’d ever seen. He left the top of his shirt unbuttoned, the loopy tops of the
The slytherin just sighed and leaned against the island awkwardly, feeling guilty at the small green puddle on the floor. He didn’t bother trying to clean it up; he wouldn’t have been allowed to anyway. He heard the tap turn on and Harry wiped the mess up quickly with a damp napkin.
They cuddled up wordlessly and it wasn’t until Harry started carding his fingers through Draco’s hair that he realised.
"That'll be very appreciated. Thank you," Draco muttered his thanks, a little embarrassed all of a sudden.
Green eyes squinted into slits upon seeing a huge, extravagant house in the distance. The building stood tall and regal, with red roses and white marble peacock statues running along the base.
Magic tingled against his skin, at where his and Draco's touched -- only separated by a layer of clothing in between. It was truly breathtaking, none of that Harry had felt before.
"Oh, Harry! You're back!" Hermione chirped enthusiastically. "Hey mate, how was it?" Ron greeted him with his usual grin on his freckled face.
Harry frowned, curiosity very evident across his features it emitted a low chuckle from the blond Malfoy.
A drop of water fell from the sky, wetting Harry's cheek. Having caught by surprise Harry jolted, then brought a hand to his cheek and looked up.
A foolish smile graced Harry's lips as Draco stared at him with something misleadingly close to being interpreted as adoration.
Harry gaped at the sight he was met with. Draco looked down at him through wet blond lashes as they fanned against his pale high cheekbones -- a sight resembling that of a prince out of a muggle fairy tale that Harry used to come across in his picture books.
"I promise." Draco grabbed Harry's belt loops to pull him down for a kiss, but he still seemed distracted. "Harry?"
Draco picked at the hem of Harry's shirt, trying to break off the loose thread with little effort. "I guess it never really occurred to me how bad it had actually been. It's not something I like to dwell on, and frankly it had just been the way life was for so long, it became my normal."
"After using the- after punishing me, he would-" Draco swallowed harshly and cleared his throat before trying again. "If I collapsed to the ground, it was worse. He'd step over me, grinding his cane into my thigh, but if I stayed standing, if I took the curse 'with the dignity befitting a proper Malfoy man' he would simply knock me off balance after with his cane and leave." Draco tried to ignore the shaking in his hands, he had never actually spoken about this before. Even now, years after his father's death, he was still trying to ignore the little voice in his brain telling him to shut up, to stop shaming the family name. Instead, he continued with his explanation. "He'd use that blasted cane to punish the house elves. The first time Hermione got top of the class, putting me right behind her, I came away covered welts across my back, one for every class she was better than me in. Malfoy's do not come in second to filthy mudbloods" he sneered, imitating the phrase he heard his father say whenever grades arrived by owl. He always dreaded his results.
Draco was quiet for several more minutes, letting himself truly relax for the first time all day. "I know, it's just," He sighed, struggling for words. "I don't want to be my father."
"I believe you are familiar with Frank and Alice Longbottom, correct?" Healer Emilia began "They are an example of what happens after being crucio'd for a long duration of time. This however, is due to the cruciatus curse being administered for shorter lengths over many days or months. The leg spasms we see here are most common in abuse victims, but we have never seen any this severe. It's an unpredictable side effect, as the cause of the spasms is typically random. It could happen from pinching a fried nerve, some have said bad weather brings it on, or while just sitting on a couch. Regardless, when it happens, the best way to deal with it is to remain as still as possible, letting the spasms run their course. You will most likely find your leg quite stiff and uncooperative for several days afterwards, but that is normal. If you had to guess, how often have you been on the receiving end of the curse?"
"Mr. Potter sit down. As we have said, his case is severe, and you should have just called for a healer and left him where you had found him. Moving him anymore than he already has been is inadvisable. As it is, I can't promise you that he will be walking completely normal after this incident, and incidents like these are bound to happen throughout the rest of his life if he strains himself or hits the wrong nerve. Our staff is doing the best we can, but if you are going to continue to impede his healing we will have to escort you out immediately. Are we clear?" The healer's quiet voice got considerably more stern and her eyes sharpened. Harry merely nodded his head and did not say anything more.
"Would I be correct in assuming this was your father?" Healer Emilia asked softly, replacing the cloth Harry had been holding with a new one while Healer Isah began to line up a tray of muscle relaxant potions and salves and handing the first to Draco, who remained silent, dutifully drinking the potions.
Harry scooped the man up easily, laughing as they headed up the stairs towards their bedroom and placing him gently on the bed. "Promise you'll let me know when you're hurting?"
Entering the house, he could hear the sounds of a struggle, something crashing to the ground and shattering. Harry whipped out his wand so fast and bolted towards their study, the worst possible scenarios flashing through his mind. He threw the door open and his heart stopped. Draco was lying on the floor, crying. It had seemed the lamp had been thrown. "Draco?"
Draco could hear Harry puttering away in the kitchen, grabbing things from the fridge, opening drawers and closing them a little more forcefully than usual. They had spent their entire childhoods bickering and fighting each other. When they first became friends years after Hogwarts, they still argued constantly, but it lacked the poison their childhood taunts held. Eventually their bickering became flirtatious, and taunts were backed with love rather than hatred. So Draco hated when they argued. But he hated admitting that maybe Harry was right even more. So he simply continued his silent treatment, ignoring the scorching pain radiating all the way up his leg and through his hip from walking down the stairs. He was hurting and really just wanted to be wrapped up in Harry's arms to make him feel safe, and he absolutely would not cry about it, dammit.
The blond man tried to shield himself from Harry's view, not wanting to be seen in this state, but knowing it was too late.
Dinner was a quiet affair, neither having anything to say to the other at the moment. It wasn't until after dinner when they had settled down on the couch with their respective work that Harry finally sighed, unable to take the tension and putting his lesson plans down. He pulled Draco's legs onto his lap and began massaging the tense muscles. "I'm sorry, I know this must be really frustrating for you, I just-" Harry's voice broke off, full of emotion as he willed his tears away. "I just really hate seeing you in so much pain when there's something that we can do about it."
"What's wrong? -and don't even give me that look, I know there's something bothering you and you just don't want to tell me because you're the big, strong Savior of the Wizarding World and you're supposed to keep everyone safe, because that isn't how relationships work. You need to let me help you too." Draco turned to face Harry who had undressed and crawled under the duvet with him.
Harry hopped gingerly off the bed and stretched, heading downstairs. Three younger Slytherins were waiting outside the door, greeting him with confused looks. They raised an eyebrow at his dishevelled state.
Draco announced that he wanted to leave but Roache insisted he spend the night, to which he agreed reluctantly. Roache said he wanted Harry to stay behind, told Draco he needed to make sure he was good boyfriend material. He watched the blonde’s retreating form and felt a cool puddle of fear gathering in the pit of his stomach.
Harry hopped down from his perch, retrieved the spoon and dug it into the ice cream without missing a beat. Draco made a face.
Hermione looked understanding and the stupid grin on Ron’s face fell. The only evidence he’d seen of how truly broken Malfoy was the little episode with the fireplace screen, but he seemed to know that there was more.
He shrugged and took a tentative bite, then another, and another after that until half the sandwich was gone, and all that remained were a little pile of chips and the croutons from his salad. Harry eyed him and Draco dipped a chip in brown sauce and held it up before crunching it down and pushing his place away as if to say
He disappeared again and a slightly rattled Harry crept up the sprawling staircase to find his partner.
He was all of those things, but it was nothing new and it did not stir anything deep inside of him. There were no flashbacks of his parent’s wedding photos or his mother helping him tie a Windsor Knot. Just a sort of creaky, aching feeling in his chest as the emptiness was once again realised. Grief wasn’t at all cinematic, and Draco was thoroughly disappointed.
“Not after what he did to you. I cannot, in good conscience, allow it. I’ve half a mind to kill him.”
The condo was spacious, but surprisingly cozy. It had soaring ceilings but the rooms were smaller, and Draco’s room had a loft bed. Everything was creamy white.
"That's...that's nearly perfect, actually. Consistency’s a little on the thick side, though. Well done, gentlemen."
With that, the boy stood shakily and limped to where his shirt and robes sat, shakily buttoning the former.
When he looked back down at the pale skin that stretched across his skeletal hand, he saw that capillaries had arranged themselves in the shape of a flower.
“Or...you could summon them. And destroy them. And I wouldn’t need to see them at all. If you want.”
"Don't you see? I'm defective-I could never hurt him...I tried, father, I did...I could n-never...I'm supposed to hate him, I know I know I know...but h-he's just...gah!”
Lucius bent down and whispered something in Draco’s ear that made him stiffen, then he jumped up and ran to the other room. He returned with plates and laid them out on the table. Returning to his seat, he got a cuff on the head from his father.
“No, no. But if I did end up bleeding out, it would’ve been a erm...what does that man call it? The painter?”
The pale boy just stared at Harry. His unruly hair, his wiry glasses. He reached up to touch the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, making him flinch in fear, then shiver pleasantly.
"I'm sorry," he choked, his voice muffled. Harry just carded his hand through his soft blonde locks.
The Malfoy family was on-screen now, looking youthful. A cake floated onto the table and a little girl blew out the candles on a small chocolate cake. Something was odd about her, though. Her hair was as bright blonde as any Malfoy, but it was black at the roots, as if it had been bleached, or the charm keeping it blonde was wearing off. Lucius stood stiffly behind Draco, a hand on his shoulder. Narcissa helped the girl cut her cake, just the way muggles did. Lucius obviously didn’t approve but he watched as the girl and her mother’s hands both held the knife and cut it unevenly.
Soon enough, she’d gotten all the dry ingredients from the pantry swirling through the air and into a bowl, mixing themselves. She took a handful of walnuts and transfigured them into eggs and milk.
Harry led him downstairs to the mess hall, and was glowered at by 90% of the paintings that hung on the walls. One of them even twirled knife at him.
The elf’s anger seemed to radiate from him, and the drapes erupted into flames less than four feet away. Harry quickly muttered a spell to put them out.
He was broken out of his reverie by something heard off-camera, and quickly magicked the blood out of his clothes. He turned to the chair, but left it dirty. The camera was left rolling.
Harry gulped and reached his hand across the table, to the cuff of his crisp white shirt. Well, it used to be white.
"Oh do get up from there-it's really uncomfortable after a while. Thanks for cleaning me up, by the way. I'd have rather you hadn't, but...oh well."
The wizard stiffened at the mention of Lucius, but just cleared his throat and swirled his fingertips in the velvet of the couch.
be the reason you do it. I try to make sure you feel like you don’t have to. Feeling guilty would be pointless. But I do feel bad that I wasn’t there for you before like I am now.”
The pale wizard slumped over, fiddling with his hands. Harry watched him from the line in front of the counter.
Harry frowned, but Draco handed him the container and he took a few bites with his own, normal-sized spoon before leaving it on the ground between them.
Casting a silencing charm under his breath, Harry ran up behind the boy and barely made it into the room before the doors swung shut behind them both. The Room was dark and bare, and he watched from the corner as Draco shrugged his robe off and sat on the floor. A platter of food floated down to him from the ceiling, but he waved it aside.
“They’re horrible, horrible people I know, but they raised me. At the very least, I owe them a goodbye.”
Draco was in bed on Harry's phone, and he walked up with a shit-eating grin plastered across his face.
Ron told them all about the squirrel he met while he was skipping arithmancy class, and the arithmancy professor himself who was walking by smacked him in the back of the head, then kept walking.
The camera’s view was partially blocked by a cupboard door, as if Roache were hiding. He probably was.
It was dinner soon enough, and for once, Draco was animated. Lively. The wizards strode into the mess hall hand-in-hand and sat across from a stunned Hermione and Ron.
“I can’t-“ he managed to get out before running to the toilet and heaving up bile, tea, and half of a scone. He emerged looking like shit, smelling like mouthwash. Harry had his shoes off and his legs folded under him.
“If at any point you need me to close my eyes or leave, or explode the tapes on a remote atoll in the Tropic of Cancer, let me know.”
Draco was older now, lying on his bed, bleeding. There was blood on the floor and the covers were only halfway on the bed from where he’d dragged himself up. He looked like shit, his nose bent at an awkward angle and his body peppered with bruises. His cheek was so swollen, he could hardly see out of his left eye.
"I don't need to listen to anyone, Golden Boy." he said, but his tone was void of malice. He tried not to notice the throbbing of his pulse, hand still clamped inside Harry’s.
Draco tried to ignore them both, focusing instead on the steady burn of the fireplace screen mesh on the back of his hand. The flames were weakening as the Everburn incantation that kept it running needed to be recast. Hermione filled a cup and put a biscuit on the side of the saucer, knowing full well it wouldn’t be eaten, hoping nonetheless. She walked up and made sure she stepped on that one creaky floorboard so as not to startle the wizard in front of the hearth. “
All Hallow’s Eve had come and gone and now they were sat on the train home with Hermione, Ron, Luna and Blaise. He was trying to get along with the others. Blaise was practically the only Slytherin who didn’t peg Draco for a traitor at present.
“I can’t do this,” he choked out and slid down the ladder, bumping his elbow on the way and twisting his ankle at the bottom.
But his mother...she was something else. She married Lucius, knowing the full extent of his vicious temper and sadistic tendencies, and then had a child with the man! A fucking child! It was probably the only instance where Draco knew he had been wronged and was actually upset about it. She put up with his abuse, even went so far as to pretend she enjoyed it. It sickened him, and so many times he remembered his father’s roaring, the broken glass and the anger in the air. His mother sauntering in and taking it all for him, with a smile and a sultry, and
“Well, in a nutshell, he asked me how you were and how bad you had gotten, told me your father was an arse and threatened to skin me and feed me to the gargoyles if I hurt you.”
Draco tossed his head, changing angles and staring into the mirror in a mixture of mischief and seduction. He just laughed at himself cynically and gave it up.
Draco gulped and his hand on the arm of the sofa grew more active and he started tearing embellishments off nervously, and without thinking, Harry took his other hand and grasped it gently. Roache noticed, but said nothing.
"I don't know, just-graduate, move somewhere, get a job that has a positive impact on the world and use that to repay. Hurting yourself won't help anyone."
The wizard took a sip of champagne and looked up to find a distraught looking Potter in his field of vision.
Draco cried, and the defeat in his eyes made Harry crumple. He promptly stood up and walked around to the other side of the bed, plucked the chocolate from Draco’s grasp and wrapped him in a hug, the pale wizard sobbing into him for the second time that night.
“Hey you guys, uh...I’ve been trying to give you space so you guys can sleep in me and Ron’s room but umm...I don’t really know how to say this without sounding like a jerk-I mean, I know I’m not being a jerk, I just-“
“Well...what if I hadn’t? Did you even have a plan? I mean, you could’ve died, and you put that all on a hunch that I might be in the room.”
He folded his trousers and robes from earlier and dropped them on the other bed, and turned out the lights with his wand, casting a quick spell to repair the stained glass window.
"It's...it's called a gaming console. A muggle thing. They play games and it shows up on a TV. Except instead of tapping the screen they use remotes. And the games are better."
"You didn't do anything. You were gone for three minutes, for Merlin's sake. I could have fought back," he murmurs, twirling his delicate unused wand between his fingers.
Harry’s hopped off the bed and is ruffling through a drawer of Ron’s chest, coming back with a long piece of parchment from his own. He lays it flat on the lapdesk that sits next to his pillow and holds a muggle ballpoint pen, waiting, hovering above the page.
“So Draco, what the hell is going on? Where are your parents? Why haven’t they been back? I mean, not that I’m complaining, you know how your father is, but is everything alright?”
Onscreen, his eyes fluttered open and he winced at the crusted-over wounds. Draco yawned and lifted his wrist from where it was plastered to the chair. The sudden movement must have torn something because blood sprayed from a particularly nasty cut and he swore, quickly closing it up. It left behind an ugly scar. They all did.
“Well, what can you do.” He muttered and pulled himself to his feet with the ice cream in his hand. It fell to the floor once he reached about seventy-percent of his full height and he immediately thrust a hand out to meet the cold countertop, bracing his weight against it until his head no longer felt like it had up and floated away.
The screen cut out again, and the next thing the boys on the couch were shone nearly sent both of them running.
She continued crying and Draco maintained his stoic expression, ran a hand comfortingly through her hair.
She just grimaced and shook his hand as quickly as she could before storming after Harry, who she found pouring himself a glass of chocolate milk.
He grinned. Draco opened the freezer and retrieved half a gallon of ice cream and two spoons from the drawer next to it.
The pale wizard sipped his coffee thoughtfully, letting the bitter taste engulf him. The steady scraping noise of Harry’s silverware stopped and he looked over.
The broken wizard walked to the centre of the room and sighed, wand in hand. He wriggled out of his shirt and levitated it wordlessly to where his robe sat, and Harry noticed the scars on his back. They formed a large X, like someone had flogged him with a spiked whip. His chest was already littered with bruises and scars, and it looked like someone had...like someone had carved words into his skin. It was impossible to make out what they said, though, in the dimly lit room.
Draco nodded slowly and gulped, desperately trying to force the lump in his throat down. Tears pricked at his eyes and Harry realised he’d been slowly backing away from the chair.
“Draco?” He called, after having paced the long corridors and finding a second sitting room upstairs, almost as big as the other-and
Harry nodded, and ran quickly to Draco's closet to get him an undershirt to sleep in and sat on the floor next to him.
It was barely light in the room when Draco’s owl woke Harry up with a screech that reminded him far too much of Hedwig. Draco himself was nowhere to be found.
A strangled sound died in his throat, and without thinking, Harry pulled him close in a tight embrace.
“Do you want me to tell him?” Harry asked gently, and the nod he felt against his damp chest told him to proceed.
“Uh, who cares? They’ll report you missing and go on with their lives. And we can just break in, steal back Hedwig, hex the whole family, curse the house and get out. ”
Harry looked at the ground, clenching his fist and shuddering, like he was panicking and hiding it badly.
“You are severely lacking in social training and entirely heedless of the acceptability of your actions. And I find it extremely endearing.”
He was relieved to find Draco still fast asleep, and he took a moment to admire him before sitting down next to him and gently jostling his shoulder.
"Oi!" Harry shouted, seeing all three boys surrounding a bleeding Malfoy. They looked reasonably shocked.
The boy took it gratefully and the two of them left, Harry holding the large umbrella over Draco’s head while he locked the doors with muggle keys.
He shook, a single tear slipping down his porcelain cheek. They were flushed now, pinkish capillaries and ashen skin. He wiped it away vigorously.
Harry just sat on his bed, staring at the floor. Ron always showered in the evening; he took his in the morning. The wizard stripped, slid a pair of sweats and a shirt over his wiry frame.
Eventually, the old professor made it to their table. He sniffed the concoction, swirling his wand around in it.
He obliged and was immediately enveloped in the conversation. After the battle, the eighth year students had all taken to sitting together during meals. Except for dinner. The professors allowed it-especially after they'd all been through, though he suspected it might have something to do with the student dynamic. The eighth years had seen some shit and there were new students. Best not to scare them.
she murmured, and the flames roared back to life The already searing heat in Draco’s hand worsened. With a great deal of self control he resisted the urge to pull back his hand, and it was going great until Hermione snatched it away for him. He just stared at the coals that had fallen underneath the andiron.
Harry sat down next to Draco and watched the elf cautiously snatch a biscuit from the platter on the coffee table between them and plop unceremoniously onto an overstuffed wingback with surprising nonchalance.
She wept, and heart-wrenching guilt displayed itself on Draco’s face. When she looked up it was gone.
Harry was not allowed to see the check at the end. Finchley popped the trunk and helped them load up the bags, and within a matter of minutes they were at the condo’s doorstep, where they got out and Finchley started carrying the it all inside. Draco insisted on helping. He left a single bag behind,  basically his way of trying to make Harry feel less useless, but also
The wizard smirked, holding back his hatred for muggles and for the briefest second, reconsidering it.
He'd been pressing his thumb into the wound, pushing the blade in deeper and deeper. Blood bubbled to the skin.
Harry heard a sharp inhale on the other side of the door, and something small and metal falling to the floor.
And the guilt that came crashing down on Draco was like a mantle of cinder blocks. His resolve nearly crumbled.
buttons on a device you don’t know how to use, and instead of waking me up, or, better yet, just ignoring the damn thing, you chose one because it was your favourite colour?”
“No, it’s fine. I’m a mess right now, my magic won’t be very accurate. And we really don’t need to accidentally summon
Harry grabbed the supplies they needed from the counter, levitating the rest over to the far end of one of the Slytherin tables, where Draco lurked in the shadows. He flinched away immediately.
He flooded his mouth with water and swished and spit so many times that his tongue tasted like chalk, then followed it up with a fast brushing that left him with bleeding gums.
Draco slid a pair of tinted sunglasses on and headed down the stairs, briefcase in hand. They walked out where two cars were waiting for them in front of the hangar.
He balanced it on his finger, inspecting the ornate carvings. It was an expensive one too. More importantly, it worked really well, and was excellently weighted.
“Anyway, I thought it’d be a good idea to sleep in my room tonight. I just...nothing against Slytherin, you guys are great but it’s so...gloomy. And you are too. Are you alright in there?”
He nodded numbly and slid the stained shirt over his back, leaving it in his lap with his gaze, unmoving. Harry gasped audibly. The makeshift sock-bandage had already slid down, allowing the wound to bleed freely.
"Draco shut up. I'm here, whether you like it or not. And I'm sorry for letting that man get to you."
By the time the boys arrive, the sun has slipped downward in the heavens and little ivory flakes drift down from above. Draco shivered under his own jacket and Harry’s old Burberry scarf wrapped tightly round his neck. Draco offered to replace it on multiple occasions, but he’d refused. It had been his mother’s. He didn’t like to talk about it. Draco did, though, insist on using a reweaving spell to fix the moth holes.
Blaise had taken their relationship surprisingly well, and they’d spent the rest of the train ride watching old Pewdiepie videos. They boys bid the others goodbye and Happy Christmas. Draco had their muggle chauffeur-a kind, mid-forties beanpole named Finchley-drive them to a restaurant in East London that Draco remembered from his childhood. The food was excellent and Harry remarked upon it numerous times, and every time, he got this look from Draco as if he were a five-year old expressing how awesome he thought tea sandwiches were. Draco paid with a muggle credit card that he’d never gotten to use before and they rode to Privet Drive in a comfortable silence. Harry had slipped into a brief food coma on the way there and had almost forgotten where he was going and exactly who he was about to visit.
He sipped his brew in peace and watched as the girl’s eyes skimmed across the page impossibly fast, then nearly spilled it when she snapped the book shut briskly-though not angrily-and leaned back in her chair with her legs drawn up to her chest.
“How could you say that? Harry, I did this. I knew what I was doing. It’s my own problem, and you needn’t have any part in it. You can always back out, if it’s too m-“
He nodded and slid down along the dishwasher to the flagstone floor with his legs folded beneath him and the ice cream in his lap. He sent a spoon flying at Harry, but it only bounced off his chest and back onto the floor with a clatter that made him wince.
“Harry shut up,” he smiled. “If your can’t right now then you can’t. But we are going to talk about this later, alright?”
Draco was waiting beside the brewing tea whilst Harry was fumbling through a box of tapes he’d found in the bookshelf. Hairs stood on the back of his neck and he didn’t know why he felt such dread.
powerful; he could hurt Draco from anywhere, using the boy himself as a tool. The wizard shook his head to rid it of the thoughts, starting slightly at a warm hand on his shoulder.
They were still walking hand-in-hand when the large oaken doors opened just wide enough to admit them, and the boys headed up to the Gryffindor common room.
They headed for a little pub on the east side of the town, the broomstick screeching loudly as they pulled into the lot at a speed far beyond unnecessary. Harry just rolled his eyes at Draco’s smug grin, passersby murmuring because it’ not often that a stupidly fast broom like his was seen in a small town like Hogsmeade. The pale wizard hovered the sleek transport into one of the ports on the side of the building, setting an extra ward on it so if anyone tried to steal it, they’d turn an abhorrent shade of yellow for-oh, about an hour. They made their way to the front doors which open automatically, and an elven host showed them to a booth by the window.
“They call me a hero, and I believed them. I believed all of it, that I was meant to save the world, that I was
Grinning, he leaned in and planted his lips on Draco's. Harry picked Draco up and tossed him into their bed. Hanging over his head, he came in close and whispered.
“Erm-yeah, I downloaded it from all the family pictures that were on a disk drive from my old house.”
The kind elf ambled over to him and knocked his wand to the floor, wordlessly healing the wounds and wrapping gangly arms around the boy’s torso.
In an instant, their lips smashed together awkwardly. It got easier, though, and soon Harry straddled the other wizard, slowly unbuttoning his shirt.
The door shut firmly upstairs and Draco felt something smooth and cold against his skin, looking down to see a gilded cup of tea on a saucer. He glanced up, and Hermione had never once broken eye contact with her tome.
He handed the wizard an earbud, and levitated the phone so that they both could watch, casting a growth charm so that the screen expanded to the size of a television. It didn’t work quite the way he’d wanted it to, since it still had the same number of pixels and the result was a shitty-quality video. The blonde didn’t seem to mind, though, and much to his chagrin, Draco soon found himself laughing at the buffoons on screen.
“Er-because you’re acting like you’re on heroin. It’s quarter-to-five in the morning and you’re fully dressed. You usually wake up at half-past.”
Tinges of pink spread across Harry's cheeks and then, he pretended to contemplate hard. With a finger scratching his hairless chin, Harry mused out loud.
Harry clicked his tongue in annoyance and mumbled "Son of a bitch pickpocketed me on the street," Harry hated how closely that sounded to a whine, but he found that he had run out of tosses to give.
Draco crossed his arms against his chest, a blond eyebrow arching as he asked Potter a question he randomly thought of. "How's Weasley and Granger?" he said, trying to make a conversation. He'd figure that Potter's lackeys were a safe topic.
"So, so? How was it?" Hermione barely held down a squeal and clapped her hands impatiently, looking as girly as Harry had ever seen her, aside from when they attended the Yule Ball.
Thankfully for him, Hermione was right -- she always was anyway. Draco Malfoy indeed turned out to be a better person after all, as of how he quickly looked out the window -- that was charmed to look like there was a beautiful landscape outside -- and bit the inside of his cheek in an effort to not laugh out loud like Harry could tell he wanted and pretended as nothing happened.
As if on cue, a shout to his left caught his attention -- it was from Flourish and Blotts. A large over-decorated sign with huge hand lettering was his answer. "Osvaldo Riggs is in town! Get your book signed!" was what was written.
What an unexpected turn it was, that it was Malfoy, who appeared as his ex arch-nemesis, to be the one who stepped into his life once again and brought back the happiness he hasn't had felt in these dull and tedious years.
Grey eyes widened upon hearing that from the other male -- as he had previously thought he would be too shy and very much caught in a haze at the moment to be able to clap back a proper retort, how Draco forgot for a moment that this was Harry Potter, the prat he once shared a deep rivalry with.
If only they had already started eating, he could then accuse Draco of spiking something into his food, which would explain why he feeling this way.
Harry hung his head, staring down at the floor, blushing heavily. Unbeknownst to Harry, Draco had a smile of satisfaction adorning his aristocratic face as he eyed him with full interest.
Jolting in surprise, he felt a slight brush of Draco's pale hand against his collarbone as the other man continued to worked the stain off of him. Harry forgot how to breathe.
Draco said nothing, and let the coin-filled fell weightily in Harry's hand. Draco spun on his heel and walked back towards the alley to apparate back home.
Startling the living lights out of him, a hand touched the messy black mop he called hair, ruffling it about. Out of instinct Harry's head snapped up to be met by a gorgeous being by the name of Draco Malfoy, who had a slight smirk on his elegant visage.
Harry waved a hand in the air as if physically shooing away his cloud of thoughts and smiled a thin-lipped smile when Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry felt his heart pounded hard. He was never one to believe that it could be so easy to just forget all those years of hatred -- although he was willing to try -- but he was now proven wrong.
Taking that as a yes, Draco encircled the cute dark-haired male with strong arms around his waist, and pulled him impossibly tight against himself.
"T-thanks," he managed, still not having his words back to him after having them taken away so suddenly by the blond's action.
Harry then eagerly -- and carefully -- took the glass of hot chocolate and took a sip before yelping as the hot liquid made contact with his tongue, burning it in the process.
An embarrassingly more-than-audible growl interrupted Draco's short conversation with the waitress. The waitress' hand that was holding a glass of water stopped mid-air.
Drops of rain dangled at the sharp edges of Draco's darkened and dampened blond locks, one slid from his forehead down to the curve of his nose -- as Harry's eyes followed -- and to his jaw, then down his jugular and disappeared behind the collar of his shirt. His white shirt that was soaked in the rain and was now basically a see-through top, showing off the toned muscles hidden underneath.
A sigh went out of the witch's lips. Her face suddenly picked up a stern look that Harry knew all too well not to oppose a single thing she's about to say.
Harry fought his way through the sea of people, he couldn't help but think of what had invited so many people here on a usually calm Saturday afternoon.
Harry's eyes when slightly wide at that. "Uh...huh? Don't you have t-things to do?" he suggested lamely.
"Finish that sentence I dare you, Potter. You'll wake up with a bollock missing," Draco shot defensively, his face twisted into a glower -- a spitting image of his spiteful younger self.
Unexpected it was, but not unwelcomed. Moreover, Harry decided that Draco could be a fine addition to his uninteresting life.
A jovial grin stretched Harry's lips so wide, you could count every single tooth on both rows of perfect white teeth. Harry clenched his right hand against his chest, his heart beating quickly in exhilaration under.
A loud pop cut Harry off and now stood a house-elf before the two men. "Tinky greets Master Draco Malfoy and his...companion."
"Well then, my answer is -- absolutely, Harry." The blond's voice was deep and rich, it sent electric waves throughout Harry's body.
Draco walked away, now several feet in front of him before turning back to shout for Harry to walked faster.
Harry continued to mop, mourning for the loss of his beloved pouch. His finger absently drew circles on the table.
The bushy-haired witch from across him shifted, putting her book aside and throwing a leg on top of the other. She cleared her throat.
A soft scoff tore out of Draco. "Not at all. In fact, it's only another opportunity for me to be close to you again, Potter. An honour really, to be serving the Chosen One."
Harry let himself fell back against the chair, lower lip jutting in a pout as he let out a puff that blew his bangs upward. His eyes narrowed when a snicker was heard from the opposite of the table.
He followed shortly after Harry and they both were later found inside of the manor, wetting the grand foyer's previously clean floor.
Harry merely cocked his head to the side with an innocent smile playing on his pink lips. Draco scoffed and turned his gaze back on track.
"Your red face is quite a sight to behold, you know that Potter? I look forward to seeing more of it in the future."
"Malfoy, how did you discover this place? This is amazing," Harry questioned in an airy tone, similar to the one Lavender Brown used to use upon fangirling over hot Quidditch players and models.
There was that glance exchanged between his two friends again, but this time Harry didn't find it all disturbing as his joyfulness over-weighted it.
"Haha. Of course, you don't, you daft git. A person could've immediately tell where we are from a single look." Draco snorted.
They stood there in the rain, caught up in each other's presence. Who was it that insinuate it first, it didn't matter as they both leaned in and brought their faces to one another. A magical and world stopping moment it was and as they were about to get close enough for their lips to touch, a thunder roared.
The lady offered him a kind smile and nodded before introducing herself to him as Adrienne, and leading them to their table.
Blushing to his ears, Harry spluttered incoherently. He looked down to avoid the steel grey eyes that were still looking at him down. The embarrassed man writhed in the blond's embrace, struggling to get out of grasp, but to no avail.
"N-No-! I didn't-! That wasn't what I meant...I just... But, well, I mean- if you want-!" Harry felt like slapping himself across the face. He gripped the sides of his chair extra tightly.
The waitress' eyes darted from Harry to Draco, confusion drawn across her face as to who would be the one to pay in a non-heterosexual date.
Harry bit down a sigh, he didn't want this to end. Funny how just hours ago he was whining about regretting his decision and all to his friends. A tug lifted the corners of his lips at the thought.
He let out a high-pitched yelp when Draco made an abrupt turn into a dark alley and pulled him close against him that Harry's face smacked right into his sturdy chest.
Just then, a sigh of pure bliss escaped his lips before he could even stop it. Completely unnoticed by him, Draco who was silently and peacefully chewing on his food stiffened in his seat at the sound.
A cough brought him out of his reverie. Draco leaned back on his chair, throwing his leg over the other, creating a perfect image of a wealthy pureblood wizard.
Emerald eyes shyly meeting the other's gaze from behind the dark lashes, Harry replied, "Yeah, and I'm going to blame you for it if I catch a cold."
Harry's eyes were wide open as saucers, his body went numb, only Draco appeared to be the only thing his mind and eyes could focus on.
A shiver down his spine, Harry's eyes gawked comically, not expecting the use of his first name. If he was being honest with himself, he might admit he actually liked the way his name rolled of Draco's tongue.
Harry turned to look at the ground, watching his feet as he took another step in front of the other. An image crossed his mind, he thought maybe it could be quite a fun activity to be on a horse, riding his way around the vast field, through its peaks and valleys as he basked under the warm sunlight in the afternoon.
