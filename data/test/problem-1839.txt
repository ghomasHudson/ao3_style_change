He liked running, it wasn't one of the sports wizards usually practiced, but for a while he had been with a Half-Blood who introduced him to running, using the magic words: since you quit Quiddicth, you are becoming less muscular.
The shop windows were full of decorations and there were people laughing everywhere.
today is Christmas Eve. I don't know if this letter will reach you before you leave for your journey, but I wanted to tell you that I feel better.
Of all the nasty things he had done to him over the years ... and there had been several ... that was perhaps the worst. Harry thought for a few moments. No, okay, maybe the time he got him and George out of the Quidditch team was worse. But in any case, even making all England believe that he was gay was at least on the podium of bullshit.
"Ginny! We two were together! " he snapped, gesturing with one hand.
A dark, cold January gave way to a rainy February and Harry had somehow managed to get Malfoy out of his head, binding him into a corner he never opened.
Unfortunately my elves and I are very busy with the preparations for Christmas Eve and I cannot reply to all the correspondence I receive. I assure you, however, that I read all the letters of all the children of the world.
"He was…"
Harry reached out and opened the drawer. He moved a couple of things, until he intercepted a tube.
"There would still be a ticket for speeding with the Nimbus ..."
"If you slide off a crevasse, I could counterbalance and pull you up," Malfoy replied, continuing to examine the equipment without looking at him.
"Oh, that's for sure," she said, pulling out her wand. She turned towards them one last time, standing in front of the threshold. The lips again posed in a severe expression. "I expect to see your family too, Draco," he reiterated, before leaving.
Thanks for everything, Santa.
God how handsome he was. I tremble all remembering it.
"I need your help. I don't know how but I think I hurt a person, ”he said as he retrieved two clean cups.
Harry darted his tongue over his earlobe as the former Slytherin backed towards the stairs.
"You're perfect…"
"Potter," Malfoy exclaimed, snapping his fingers. “Stay focused. F-o-c-u-s!"
Draco's skin was warm and pale.
"Thank you," he whispered in a low voice, abandoning himself against him. "I'm serious, Harry... thank you ..."
He covered one of Narcissa's hands with his own, squeezing it slightly. She smiled, tilting her head to one side.
"Always too few ... And you haven't seen the shoes yet," Draco replied, while Harry let out a groan and buried his face in the hollow between his neck and shoulder.
Harry led him out of the study and sat him down on the living room sofa, turning on all the lights with a flick of his wand. He ordered the Aurors to call the coroners for surveys and not to touch anything. He thought for a moment whether to turn on the fireplace to dampen the cold that gripped the house but decided to let it go. Malfoy was still, his gaze on the floor, his hands clasped between his knees. He was trembling.
After years and years of catastrophes, Harry Potter was able to recognize one when he saw it.
Harry knew they should go down to the cabin. He took a quick look around to make sure there were no boats nearby. He would fuck Malfoy there, on the deck of the sailboat, under the lush Fijian sky.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes slightly. Harry could sense his icy fury before his expression relaxed again. “We will talk about it at another time. Now we have to ... "
I returned to the table dejected. I make him sick.
He turned off the water when he heard a groan coming in the bedroom.
Pansy frowned. “Don't you remember if Harry Potter has a big cock? Come on, Malfoy… we're talking about Harry Potter! It's your erotic dream from ... "
"Nothing ... I lost a second in my memories," he said, calling the waiter to bring him another glass of wine.
Harry frowned, looking back at her.
“Don't worry, Harry. If you end up with the gentleman, I'll go ... "
He took out a new card, handing a cookie to the owl, who was trying to peck him. He dipped the feather and left it suspended until some ink dripped onto the wooden shelf. He crumpled up the note and sent the owl away with no answer. He finished the last work of the day and told Karen to go home. He was about to turn off the lights and leave when a second owl landed on his desk.
"Undress," he said in a slightly hoarse voice. The idea of disobeying did not even touch my cerebral cortex. My fingers ran to the buttons of my shirt and started undoing them.
Draco
Dear Santa Claus,
Malfoy shrugged as if he didn't care. “Anyway, I needed a fake boyfriend to get rid of him and you're the first person that came to mind. I told him that we are together, that we are very happy and that you will break his bones if he only tries to get closer to me "
"Well, you killed Voldemort. You are not extremely popular at the moment. People have to forget it."
"I see"
I caressed his chest slowly, while I was completely welcoming him into my body.
"No, thanks," he mumbled.
Harry frowned, examining the back of the parchment on which was printed a rose adorned with an inscription that read the name and address of a shop.
I have a clue: Potter is single and even his best friend thinks he needs to fuck badly.
"If I were, I would tell her, but I'm not"
“What do you mean Malfoy doesn't want to break up with me? You cannot be together with a person against his will "
Luckily there was Blaise who is always a guarantee during the holidays: half drunk and very acid. With him I don't have to pretend to be happy or have fun and above all I can abuse alcohol and other illegal substances.
"Can't you just let us visit Harry for a few minutes?"
Please bring me Harry Potter!
“A couple of days off… won't it be too much? Why don't you go back and get some more curse off you? " Draco commented unable to stop himself.
"Do you like roast?" he asked, without even turning around and Draco thought absurdly that he just wanted to wrap his arms around his waist and lean against his back. Stay there, clinging to Potter for the rest of the night.
Draco frowned. "Really?"
At least until he saw him with someone else.
Harry swallowed a knot of disquiet and slowly wrapped his arms around him, as if he were afraid to break it.
Draco shrugged, nervously nibbling on his lower lip. "You're the first person that came to mind," he replied as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
Harry turned so fast that Malfoy nearly ran into him. "And no more comments about my dick" he hissed angrily, feeling his cheeks roast with shame.
They certainly wanted his autograph. One with two dark ponytails pushed the cute one in his direction, making her emit an excited squeak.
"But I am"
“You won't even have to spend time with me. It is enough for you to say nothing ... "
(See the end of the chapter for
And especially
Harry looked at the woman's hand in horror before looking up again. This was far worse than when she believed Hermione was his fiancée.
“Excuse me,” he said, hitting the knee of the boy sitting two seats away as he passed.
Draco
Draco nodded enthusiastically. "Or you could bring me the bags," he offered conciliatory.
Harry smiled, taking his wine glass again. "No. I actually said I was going to see my uncles… who wanted to reconcile with me for Christmas. " he replied, making a small grimace. “Hermione didn't believe it, but she didn't insist. Can you get some more wine please? I've never had a completely sober Christmas in the past twelve years. "
She pursed her lips in a thin line. "I'll call the professor," he said just before walking away to make a phone call.
"Maybe ..." he whispered "Or maybe directly on the grass ... I couldn't stop looking at your ass while you were on that fucking broom," he murmured, while Draco ran his fingers through his hair.
On Christmas Eve I was supposed to go to Pansy's house, since my parents are on a Caribbean cruise and I really hope they will stay there. I wasn't in the mood to go to a party. Pansy's parents have a nasty habit of feeding me carbohydrates and Pansy is still with Stephen and the two of them coo like two pigeons in heat.
"Let's pretend we're not home," he whispered, nibbling his earlobe. After a moment his cell phone started ringing. "Fuck" he exhaled checking the display. A shock crossed his mind as he watched Hermione's name flash on the phone.
"No," Draco replied, pursing his lips in a grimace not to smile.
"Mom, that is done with cups of tea ... not with glasses of white wine"
They wanted to take him to St. Mungo's but he refused. He had come home, sending Ron and Hermione away as well. He covered his face with his hands, feeling a sob squeeze his chest.
"Oh Jesus," snapped a voice. Draco started to retreat quickly, but Harry's hands held him. Weasley walked into the kitchen, Auror jacket unbuttoned, hair more tousled than usual. "I'll never get used to this," he muttered, opening a cabinet and retrieving a bag of chips.
"I'm going to pee," Hermione said quickly as she walked out of the room as Harry slid his arms around Draco's waist.
"How is he?" she said finally.
And of course, I was thinking about him as I pushed the glass door into the building I work in when I heard his voice calling my name.
"I'm sorry they called you," Harry said, shaking his hand convulsively. He laughed, it sounded more like a bark. " It was my fault ... I didn't see it. "
Santa Claus
"Bullshit," she replied, continuing to nibble on her brunch. "How was it? Did he fuck you from behind? "
Pansy slapped him on the arm. "Are you stupid?"
Draco lowered his head, nodding slightly. "I'm not afraid of what can happen ... we could hurt each other, but it would still be worth it ... even a minute of what we are experiencing would have been worth it ..."
"I was running ..." he replied, pulling off his belt buckle.
"Do you want to stay married to me?" Harry asked him. It was the second time he had asked him that question in a few hours.
"I was thinking ... about the documents ..."
"So I brought him home. I wanted to stay for the night…you know just to be safe ... but he told me he can handle it all by himself and he kicked me out” he continued, gesturing with one hand.
Harry frowned, Draco's fingers slid lower and caressed his upper back. Why did Malfoy know what his team was?
Harry froze, looking at Hermione's startled face.
Potter spoke to me! Of his own free will! Really! I am not joking!
Potter hesitated just a moment before pointing to the cancellation papers on the desk. “Will you sign them? We only have one week from the wedding date to ... "
Draco's eyes widened a bit, tightening his grip on his hand. "Where are you going?"
Ginny just shrugged again, making a small grimace. "I'm sorry, Harry," she murmured.
No! He hadn't promised this! He had promised to keep quiet!
"You did it," he hissed, pointing a finger at him. The cheeks of the former Slytherin quickly lost that little colour they kept, while Harry advanced threateningly towards him. "It was you! You're the anonymous source very close to the couple "he exploded, waving the newspaper as if he wanted to use it to skewer him.
"You heard right"
And then we went to the bathroom and we fucked. Or at least I think, this part is still confusing.
"Oh," said the former Slytherin. "I always believed so"
Bring me Harry Potter, I swear I'll make him happy. Please, Santa Claus.
You would have every reason not to give this letter a second look and throw it away.
"I'm not scared," Draco retorted automatically.
“Do you want to fuck behind a bush? Or maybe leaning against the fence? " Draco said as Harry wrapped his arms around his waist. He pretended to think about it, kissing his jaw softly.
If you like, leave me a comment, please :-) See you next story!
He was about to give up and go home when an owl flew into his office and landed on his desk.
"Malfoy?" he replied as I walked into his office and closed the door behind me. Harry stared at me, not entirely sure what my intentions were. Maybe he was afraid I'd attack him or throw a stinging potion at him,
"Come in," he replied to Karen's discreet knock. He did not take his eyes off the document as the woman handed him a bundle of papers. “Leave them aside, I'll look at them later. Tonight I plan to finish late, but you go ahead, ”he added. He looked up only when Karen stood at the desk in an exceptionally tense pose.
“I saw Roger last night. I went out to get some air ... I don't know how he managed to get into the garden "whispered Draco in a barely audible voice. His shoulders trembled. And Harry hated the surge of protection he felt immensely.
And then Malfoy was riding him. His hips moved decisively. The nails digging hot paths on his chest. Harry dug his fingers into his thighs, indulging his convulsive movements and just wishing he would make him cum.
Somehow his fingers worked their way through Draco's clothes, freeing him of the shirt that slipped to the floor with a rustle.
If you like, leave me a comment, please :-)
Harry grabbed her by the arm, looking at her unable to figure out what to do. "I'm not alone," he whispered softly.
"Have you seen the newspaper this morning?" he barked, walking in large steps towards the table positioned in the corner of the entrance. Here it is, another copy.
Draco nodded, clapping his hands to summon the house elves. "You go away," he growled in their direction, putting his arm around Harry's shoulders and leading him into the living room.
The Burrow was festively decorated, with a long table set outside. Draco had expected long minutes of silence and suspicious looks, but George had proposed a Quidditch match with a reduced lineup. It had all boiled down to a few thrusts and a broadside that made Draco totter on the broom.
Harry pursed his lips in a perverse smile, stretching his arms back.
For a moment I hoped he would reply that he couldn't wait to find out the other things he didn't know about me, but obviously he didn't. He put the check in his pocket, looking away. Cheeks flushed with shame. He noticed that I was flirting. Even an asexual would have realized this.
He found him in the kitchen. He was wearing the denim shirt that Draco loved. He was preparing a vegetable extract. "Do you want some'?"
"He came to my house!" he suddenly realized. It had to be the guy who was part of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff and whose name was supposed to start with M or S. Or maybe it was C.
If he hadn't known her well, Draco would have thought she was embarrassed. "They were delivered in person," she said in a neutral tone.
She cocked her head to the side. The blond curls that fell over her shoulders. "Really?"
Harry slowly moved his neck. At some point he must have fallen asleep. He turned over in the duvet, absently wondering what time it was. Malfoy was gone. Before he left, Malfoy had covered him with the quilt and left a note on his pillow.
Draco exhaled deeply, moistening his lips with the tip of his tongue. He glanced in the direction of the door, before gesturing for Harry to precede him in the living room. There was a fireplace and a good scent of clean and lavender impregnated the whole room.
"Someone ... yes. It seems like a great idea. I have the right person. In an afternoon he will fix everything” Draco replied, accompanying his words with the affirmative nods.
"Deny ... mh mh," Malfoy replied, but Harry didn't even hear him.
"There's nobody home," Draco murmured, pulling off his sweater and then licking his jaw.
He shuffled to the bathroom and then clung to the sink.
He headed for the bar and… oh you should have seen him! Confidence… that subtle streak of arrogance, totally unconscious… every gesture Potter makes screams: dominant, dominant… and I just want to be his eager little bitch.
"Can I keep this?" he said to the girl.
"I'm tired," Malfoy piped, putting his lower lip into a small pout. Harry craned his neck a little to check where he was. He still lacked the whole part on poisons and antidotes.
Did Ron know? He certainly didn't know, otherwise he would have started calling Malfoy
Draco groaned, his fingers buried in his messed up hair.
Harry woke from the numbness in which he was immersed. The living room sofa at Malfoy Manor was comfortable. Especially if he had spent the last two hours of his life having sex with Draco in every dirty position his mind suggested.
What if that guy was more handsome, smarter, and nicer than me?
He took off his elegant jacket, placing it on the back of the nearest chair. Potter's apartment was extremely large, but at the same time it had that atmosphere of intimacy that is difficult to recreate by an interior designer. Worn-out armchairs, a good scent of books and spices. Dense carpets to dip your bare feet into. Just a couple of pics with Potter and The Two Losers he was backed up by.
"You have the amazing ability to point out the obvious," Potter replied, tightening his grip. He leaned slightly towards him to touch his lips. A light kiss with open eyes. "I haven't heard you say I do yet"
“Get ready,” he ordered, his chest rising and falling quickly following the rhythm of his breathing.
But if I dropped to my knees at his feet and begged him to give him a blow job, would he say no?
If only his hands hadn't shaken so much he would have tried to caress him. "Let me see, I have ..."
"I'm busy all weekends of my life," Malfoy replied as Harry slipped his hands under his shirt and stroked his back.
“I don't have time for breakfast. I have to shower and go to the office, ”Malfoy replied coldly as he entered the house. Harry followed him up the stairs to his attic. Malfoy's apartment was brighter and more minimalist than he expected. White walls, white sofas… just a few touches of color expertly placed here and there.
And we finally got to sex! I hope you enjoyed this chapter ... I know that the story started out a bit complicated, with a very difficult theme to deal with.
He turned in the duvet, looking thoughtfully at his profile. Would he be able to kiss Malfoy?
Potter was still at the bar, the sleeves of his sweater rolled up over his arms. Oh God, his forearms! I just wanted to lick them. And then get on my knees, unbutton his jeans and pull his dick out. There, in front of everyone.
"What do you want?"
"Honey"
Harry looked down again at the page, where there was a picture of him. A photo of him next to a photo of Draco Malfoy.
, he thought, getting lost in that damp, wet paradise.
Harry closed his fingers on the glass, one elbow resting on the bar. They hadn't sat down yet since they entered the house. Part of him wanted to say yes right away, but it seemed important that Malfoy asked him explicitly.
Malfoy nodded vigorously. "As you wish, Harry," he said smoothly.
“Sorry, I had a little setback,” he said, realizing that he was short of breath and that he was having trouble breathing normally. For an instant his vision darkened. He struggled not to lose consciousness, leaning against the door jamb.
“My parents got divorced. She is somewhere in France…” he said, slightly shaking his head. “It… it doesn't matter. I can go to the hotel for a while "
"And they're so sexy together," Pansy added, her lips curling into a perverse smile.
"Get ready," he ordered, before stealing another quick kiss. "I'm looking for a condom," he added, before walking away. Draco looked at his back, pulling off his pants and boxers. She moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue and slipped her fingers between his buttocks. He hadn't even considered the idea of not obeying him. He prepared himself slowly, widening the ring of muscles. Potter had hardly touched him, yet there he was, moaning, his penis hard to hurt.
"It's nothing," Malfoy said quickly, lowering his head and heading for the lit fireplace.
"What do you want, Malfoy?"
"You are the most overrated seeker of all time," Draco replied.
"Stay here. I'll take you,” he murmured, starting to walk away when Malfoy grabbed him by the wrist,“ Potter, ”he murmured, then looking up at him. His eyes were veiled with tears and so sunken they looked like two pieces of ice embedded in his skull.
Harry stood still, his arms at his sides. He didn't say anything when Malfoy pulled away. He watched him go. Whatever he said, it wouldn't stop him.
I had the checkbook automatically materialize in my fingers, pretending it had always been there. Potter was still watching me and my dick was hard to hurt.
Harry's hands dropped to the ex Slytherin's buttocks, they were warm ... incredibly inviting ... and he just wanted to touch him everywhere.
Anyway, let's go back to last night.
"Thank you very much Malfoy, I'm sure the children of the orphanage blah blah blah blah ..."
Draco
"Harry," Hermione called out, running up to him. She wrapped herself more tightly in the sweater, walking beside him.
"But I'm not!" Harry replied, his voice slightly shrill with hysteria.
"In fact ..."
The nurse told him to go up to the second floor, in the curses department. She couldn't tell him what condition he was in. Draco swallowed hard, praying with every fiber of his being that Harry was okay… he just wanted him…
"It is the first Christmas without my father. You are the only person I can tolerate, "he murmured, before opening his eyes. For a second Harry thought Malfoy's eyes were amazing, so full of thoughts, so alive.
He glanced in the direction of the stairs, looking for Malfoy.
"A beer, Alf," Weasley said, unbuttoning his Auror jacket and placing his straight backside on a stool not far from mine.
"Kreacher" called Harry, slipping his wand into the back pocket of his jeans. "Take him outside," he ordered, no longer deigning the stranger a single glance.
Harry thought he was about to say he preferred to leave, but something in his tone made him desist.
after the holidays you spent together? "
"The Christmas guy," she replied quickly, closing the file she was examining. "How much did you hurt him?"
"Harry," Hermione peeped carefully.
No articles in the newspapers! No articles in the newspapers!
"Are you scared, Malfoy?"
Harry shrugged. "Yes, but that's not the point ..."
Hermione looked at him, the writing I already knew was reflected in her irises.
After a manicure and a hairdresser's appointment, I went to a low-level pub, where the air exudes carbohydrates and frying oil. I sat at the bar, I knew I didn't have to do anything but wait.
He tapped his fingertips on the wooden desk as Karen walked out. Harry entered in shortly after, a half smile on his face. He wore the Auror uniform. Draco painfully thought he was going to get fucked on the desk by Potter dressed like that. He looked his strong shoulders, the way the Auror jacket wrapped around his chest. Dangerous, Potter was dangerous.
Draco turned to him. He seemed on the verge of saying something very mean but had to think again because he closed his lips with a snap.
"Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?"
Ron made a disgusted grimace and for a moment he looked like he was going to cry. Harry smiled, rubbing his forehead with his fingers. He should have censored certain thoughts. At least in front of Ron.
"Mrs. Weasley ..."
Harry let out a low growl, passing across the table to try and grab him and hurt him as much as possible, but Malfoy was incredibly ingenious when it came to slipping away from someone's clutches.
Weasley bared his teeth in a snarl, taking a step forward. It towered over him nearly his entire head, but Draco was calmer, more controlled… Weasley was not going to win that fight. Even the former Gryffindor knew this.
He could see the urge to send him to hell in Potter's face, but eventually he stepped aside and invited him in. Draco looked at the collection of empty bottles and half bags of potato chips left on the table. Judging from the appearance of the room it must have been a bad night for Potter.
Draco put his arm around her waist and dematerialized to reappear shortly after in the hospital. He hesitated for only a moment before passing through the secondary entrance. The Magicians' hospital was one of his customers, he knew how to move quite well within the structure. Surely, they had taken Harry to one of the less accessible wings so as not to leak the news that he had been injured. Although he kept a low profile after the war, the newspapers never stopped chasing him.
All that talk from Hermione and Mrs. Weasley… and Ginny!
"Feel free to come and get me," he murmured, kissing him softly. And Draco loved the way Potter's body still clung to his, the way he let himself go in his arms. The way his scent stayed on him.
Then his hand snapped and closed on Draco's crotch. The palm pressed down on his penis, rubbing it roughly over the fabric of his trousers. Draco tried to stifle a groan as his penis hardened under Potter's caress. He hated his hypersensitive body and hated Potter even more, the devastating effect it had on him.
"I don't know ... your jeans ..."
Narcissa studied him for a few moments, the blond curls framed her still fresh face. “You are handsome. Did you change your cream? "
Draco whispered the name so softly that Pansy had to ask him to repeat it.
"Draco Malfoy is my boyfriend"
"What have you done?" he asked "It seems ..."
Harry hadn't deciphered his expression until someone recognized him and yelled an insult. Harry had hesitated, too worried that someone would read his face… When he saw the ashtray fly towards him, Harry had put his hand to his wand and blew the ashtray against a wall without hurting anyone.
After preparing breakfast, I went back to my room. Harry was awake, lying on the pillows. Obviously, it was beautiful, and I was ready to do it again.
"I have my sources," he replied, appearing behind the table again. “Listen, one week. I get rid of Roger and ... "
Thanks everyone for reading the fanfic up to here. I hope you have had a good vacation and see you in the next chapter :-)
Harry stifled the urge to cover himself being caressed by Draco's intense gaze.
"As you like," he finally said, setting the bottle down on the table. He dimmed the lights a little so that the room took on an even more intimate look. Draco wished he hadn't. He wanted them to approach everything as a clinical experiment, not as something personal.
Draco Malfoy… he was talking about Draco Malfoy.
"Don't you want to deny it?" Hermione asked, following him. Her voice was a little shrill.
I recovered the lubricant from the bedside table and poured some on my fingers. Harry looked at me as if he wanted to tear me apart, I was subdued by his gaze. I brought two fingers to my opening and slid them inside. I wanted it immediately inside of me. I had waited so long… I didn't care if it hurt me. I just wanted his cock planted deep in my ass.
Harry moaned in pain, they had to decide quickly. He wasn't going to be able to stay that way much longer. Draco asked Granger where she had parked the car. "That's the one over there," she replied, pointing to a blue sedan.
"Where were you supposed to be?" Malfoy asked, pouring them both more white wine. He had also taken off his shirt, remaining only with the men's swimsuit. His shoulders were broad, his arms strong as if he were used to doing a lot of outdoor sports. Harry had a trained body from years of training, but Malfoy had a slim, sleek body. Without imperfections. Free of the scars that dotted his here and there.
He hid his face in the hollow between Malfoy's neck and shoulder, stifling a snort of laughter. He would stay that way forever… with Malfoy under him… his dick no longer hard, still halfway deep inside him.
He would explain that it was a misunderstanding, that the newspapers could not be trusted ... and he would go back to being Harry Potter, the heterosexual.
She smiled that disarming smile of his. “Don't we all deserve to be happy? At least a little ... if he makes you happy ... "
"What is that?" Draco asked, peeking over his shoulder.
Potter arched his eyebrows, not quite sure he understood his words. Draco took a few steps, he couldn't sit still. He ran a fingertip over the book covers, before turning to the former Gryffindor.
"I have my sources," Draco replied hastily. "Can I come in?"
Harry shook his head, pouring a large dose of coffee into the two cups. He handed one to his friend, then sat down in the chair in front of her. "I do not know. A lot… I think. He left last night ... "
He wouldn't have imagined the same florist reporting every word to Rita Skeeter.
And then Potter had undressed him ... again ... slowly ... he had taken off one item of clothing at a time, covering every inch that was discovered with his lips. They were naked on the living room carpet, Harry on top of him. Their sweaty bodies. Fingers intertwined. They had had sex slowly, devoid of the searing frenzy of the first few times.
Harry mouthed a thank you. “He and his fiancé take you to Starbucks for breakfast,” she added loud enough for Malfoy to easily hear her from upstairs.
"What happened last night at the stadium?" continued the young witch, casually casting a spell, which crashed at the feet of a gnome making him make an Olympic leap.
"A week," Harry finally snorted. He looked up, intercepting the expression of pure joy painted on the face of the former Slytherin. “A week and then we break up. In fact ... I leave you because you cheat on me! "
He hadn't needed to follow him to find out that he had gone to Green's house to check that he wasn't really there. Roger had a couple of friends out of town and had agreed to disappear for a while ... long enough for Malfoy to die of fear and guilt.
He moistened his lips, turning back to Ron's mom. He just had to be calm and assertive. It's reasonable.
He gave in to his instincts and slid his hands along his chest, feeling the softness of his skin and the solidity of his muscles. Harry took his hand and put two fingers to his mouth. He sucked them greedily, leaving them covered in saliva.
"Yeah, well ... if you came here to tell me you're not gay and you didn't like what ..." Draco interrupted defensively.
He looked at the guy for long moments, trying to trace his name in the dark corners of memory. Hogwarts. He was sure of that. Maybe a couple of years younger than he is. Hufflepuff .... No, Ravenclaw. He was almost sure it was from Ravenclaw and that his name began with M.
Harry closed his eyes, reaching over the cushions. It was almost pleasant ... going around aimlessly, the sensation of a body next to his, the consistency of the other's shoulders under the arm ...
I understand that I am moving in the right direction.
Harry hunched his head between his shoulders, feeling a deep shame digging holes in the center of his chest.
“Stop giving yourself flowers with my money! I've never even given them to Ginny ... why should I give them to you? "
"If it was just a fuck it would be easier ... but if it were, I wouldn't have ... let him in ..."
"But do you like him?"
He watched the girl's cheeks turn incredibly red, as if she were on fire.
"Forget it. The newspapers can say what they want ... I'm not interested in their lies."
"I didn't do anything," Harry replied loudly enough for Rose to turn to him. He suggested how to beat her brother at the game they were playing, before returning to look at Hermione.
He placed his hands on his hips, but the former Slytherin's fingers suddenly tightened on his wrists, making them move onto the pillow next to his head.
"Forget it ... I'll go ..." Harry offered, but Draco pushed him back badly.
“Servitude is truly gossip. You can't ... "
"Why does Mrs. Weasley think I'm gay?" he said. His heart beat like he was climbing Mount Everest.
Thanks
He walked away silently, internally exulting at not having to face Weasley again before dawn. He poured himself a cup of cheap coffee when he felt a presence behind him. He glanced at Granger before pouring some sugar into the cup.
Both had a big communication problem: Draco because he came from a highly dysfunctional family, where silences were much wider than words, and Harry because he had always had a tendency to withdraw, to brood and eventually, to do as he wanted. without listening to anyone.
"Why should I say something that's not true?" exploded, while Malfoy was looking for something else to throw at him.
Worried?
He got up and opened the window panes, letting in a chilled owl.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco dug a hand into his hair and kissed him more deeply. Draco bit his lower lip hard enough to make him groan. He pushed him onto the mattress, making him lie down again, moving his lips down his neck. Potter's skin had a familiar smell, the smell of their bodies ... Draco ran every inch of his chest with his mouth, savoring it, imprinting it in his mind. He buried his face against his abdomen, slowly following the trail of dark hair up to his groin.
Years of loneliness and fear had scratched even his mother's adamantine will.
Draco bit his lower lip to keep from laughing. "Maybe" he conceded, before getting up and stopping in front of him. "Now go away, one of us has a real job to do"
"Potter ..." exhaled the former Hufflepuff, as if he were facing death himself. The tongue darted between dry, cracked lips to moisten them. "He told me ... that ..."
Draco froze, suddenly wide awake. Harry Potter was standing in front of him. Very disheveled. Very naked. It took Draco's brain less than a split second to register the inviting dark line of hair on his well-defined abdomen. The veins in evidence on his arms. The messy hair. And the eyes that looked incredibly green without the glasses.
A stylet of pain crossed his shoulder, reverberating throughout his body. Harry bit his lower lip to hold back a groan, until Malfoy was done medicating.
"Or maybe I liked the idea of spending Christmas in Fiji with an undeniably attractive guy ..." he whispered, leaning over him and placing a kiss on the shoulder. "I wanted to understand ... if he would let me lick his tattoo ... I've been fantasizing about it since I saw him without a shirt for the first time"
"You are crazy if you believe that I won't say anything!"
She rubbed her belly, it seemed bigger by the hour. "I don't know how you did it ..." she began, "but if you make him suffer, I'll tear your testicles out and give them to my cat as a present ..." she hissed, before smiling amiably in the direction of Ginny who was walking back to the table with others. bottles of wine.
"What the fuck ..." he growled, instinctively throwing himself to the ground, while another spell was trying to get an eye out.
Okay, he would burn those damned jeans!
Draco shrugged. "Why not? Can you get me some speeding tickets with the Nimbus? "
"So it can't be me," he remarked sourly, throwing the blankets aside and getting out of bed.
"Yeah ... pure fantasy ..." Draco hissed sourly.
Draco stopped thinking when he recognized the street where Harry lived.
Draco arched his lips in a hot smile and lifted his hips so that he could take off his trousers. Harry felt a new wave of excitement flood him as he realized that the former Slytherin was not wearing boxers.
"If I had had to choose someone for my Draco, I would have chosen you," he whispered and Draco felt his stomach sink. He avoided turning so as not to have to hold Harry's gaze. "You are brave enough to protect him properly"
Harry did his best not to observe his sculpted abdomen, his barely protruding hipbones, which made an inviting V. He watched a few drops of water slide down his abdomen, follow the inviting pattern of the muscles, then go to die on the edge of the costume. Harry licked his lips, looking away as Malfoy lay down beside him.
“Why don't you take a seat in the living room? Unfortunately, today the servants have a day off, you can't even find staff ... "
"You are," Potter muttered, his fingers locked around the bars of the headboard. His face and chest wet with sweat.
She pulled her hand away from his arm. "But yes ... it's really that simple"
Harry just licked his lips as his shirt slid to the floor.
"Whose?"
I took a deep breath and walked over, elbowing through the crowd.
"Don't talk," she told him immediately, arranging the sheet better.
“I participated in a beauty contest. I've become ... Mister Little Mermaid. Yes, I know… it's humiliating, but I needed the money for Christmas. But my girlfriend would leave me if she found out ... "
Draco smiled, lifting only one corner of his mouth. "Thank you" he replied as if it were information known to him.
He let out a low moan, giving in to his instincts and slipping a hand into his boxers. He was already hard ... just the thought of Potter was enough to get him excited. He masturbated furiously, bringing out the image of Potter's back ... of that damned trail of dark hair along his abdomen ...
Malfoy's expression remained unchanged, not a hint of pity or anger. Nothing. If only he had reacted, Harry would have asked him to leave, but somehow he knew that the former Slytherin would not have done it ... that he would not judge, he would not put any more emotional burden ...
"Okay ... okay ... I have a boyfriend"
She exhaled deeply, looking for something to say that didn't support her hypothesis. Eventually, he just shrugged again. "It can't be a part of my life more than that."
“Worried about me. I know. It's not a good idea to hang out with Malfoy, but I can handle him."
"Harry?"
"He didn't come home tonight," she reported with a sly grin, which was immediately reflected on Ginny's lips.
"I kicked him out of my house"
Draco wanted so much to run and run away, but eventually he climbed the steps and entered the house. Molly set the pan on the table and then turned to them, hands on hips, expression pissed. For a moment Draco wondered if he would send them out to do their homework.
Lunch with his mother and spending the night at Potter's had upset him more than he wanted to admit. He'd tried to focus on work, ending up looking at the same things over and over again. In the end, he pulled the cancellation documents out of the drawer and signed them.
"Is it coffee?" Harry muttered, not quite sure he was fully awake.
"No, it never did"
"Have you done it again?"
"With brown hair," she said.
"But I'd like to see how it goes," he added.
“Okay, I've decided I don't want to see them. Let's start fucking again, ”he said, nibbling his neck.
He hurried down the steps, opening the front door. "Hey," he greeted them, as Ron said he was going to check if he had anything to eat as Hermione was raging against his shirts and stopped him from having breakfast so as not to be late for the wedding.
Roger Green lived in a north London neighborhood with his family. After about half an hour of stalking he saw the former Hufflepuff leave the house and start walking fast on the sidewalk.
He thought he caught something he couldn't read in Malfoy's gaze when he pulled away a little, but every thought was erased by Draco's next words.
"And you broke up with Ginny"
"... without my being able to stop you"
Draco brushed his hair back, grabbed a glass of water and brought it to his lips, helping him take a few sips. "No, it's you who can't bear the pain," he added, before turning his head towards the door.
"I would like to tell you that your check has been deposited and that it will be enough to restore the orphanage library. They would like to name it after you "
"Hello" I greeted him, stopping on the threshold.
"I don't know and I don't care ... it's a relationship based on utility ... We don't see each other, we don't write to each other and we don't even feel the need to see each other. Sex was ... "
Harry and I are together.
Harry thanked him with a nod, glancing in Hermione's direction. Where was the speech that would have convinced everyone? Why weren't she and her very high IQ brain intervening?
"Maybe next time" I proposed full of hope and fragile dreams.
Harry's stomach was now in free fall.
Sign of assent. Smile. Sip of tea.
Harry felt a powerful shiver go through his back as he hugged Draco and kissed him deeper.
He reached out and touched Malfoy's back, running his fingertips along his spine.
I swallowed hard, my dick getting hard as granite in my pants, while Potter's gaze caressed me everywhere. He would have torn my clothes to shreds with his eyes.
Harry hated that smile. It was the mom smile.
The same Draco Malfoy who had set up all that little joke just to make fun of him!
Please, help me. Please. I will never ask you for anything else. I'm serious. I know I wrote you the same thing when I was five and wanted a pony.
"I think I remember what happened" he replied, before shaking his head "And you won't like it"
It wasn't working.
He kicked off the sheets and got to his feet, unsure if he was going to throw up on the parquet. He inhaled and exhaled deeply. His temples pounded painfully from the headache.
Malfoy shrugged, returning to wade a path that he could now reconstruct only with memory. Harry waited for him to complete the sentence, but Malfoy didn't. “We are almost there. Let's go on ”he said, starting to walk again.
He had hoped Harry would catch up with him, but he hadn't.
He swallowed empty. "What ..." he peeped before finding his voice again. "What the fuck are you doing here?"
The young witch blushed violently, chirping a little
"This way, I'm unarmed," said a voice. Harry felt his stomach twist as he realized it resembled Draco Malfoy's.
"Exactly. So why are you all mad at my ... "
"It is too dangerous to move him in these conditions"
“Besides… the potion doesn't do anything you don't really want. It's just like a colossal hangover that lowers inhibitions and makes you more ... free "
He closed his eyes, trying to recall the events of the previous evening. He remembered everything up to the moment of cutting the cake. Pansy had organized a pharaonic party in Nocturne Alley. She had invited all of his friends ... had hired a deejay, had ...
Harry walked up the steps two by two, wand in hand. He tried to open the bathroom door but found it blocked by a spell.
"I feel so safe with you," Draco whispered in his ear, pressing his palm against Harry's groin and causing him a low moan.
"Merry fucking Christmas, Potter," Malfoy said, sitting up, before turning to look at him over his shoulder. Harry laughed softly, giving him a look.
"It's Potter, now"
Draco wanted to ignore him when a third owl entered his office.
Preparations for Christmas at Malfoy Manor had finally been completed. A house elf had been buried by a mountain of red banners - which had been carefully made to disappear - an indecent sum had been spent on candy canes.
“A Muggle cell phone. Hermione gave it to me "he replied, while Draco slipped it out of his hand to examine it better." It is used to talk even at a great distance, to send instant messages ... photos or videos "he added, starting to remove the shrimp from the grill. He glanced at Draco as he kept touching the screen, he was clearly fascinated. "Do you realize it's a Muggle invention?" Harry asked, taking it from his hand again.
Malfoy just shook his head, giving him a look. A corner of his mouth flickered into a wry smile, making him suddenly plunge back into school years. "Scared, Potter?"
Hermione just looked at him with the friend version of Mrs. Weasley's comprehensive expression.
"Twice," Potter commented and if only Draco hadn't already hated him with his whole self he would have started now. "I always thought you were a slut"
By now the whole of London seemed to be covered with it. Harry unfolded the newspaper, sensing a river of lava running down his veins. He would kill to Rita Skeeter, the publisher, the owner of the newspaper ...
You brought me the pony and the following year I wanted a Nimbus.
"Mom, please ..." Draco interrupted, placing a plate of fresh muffins on the table. From the floral decorations, Draco suspected his mother had made them. "The war is over and I don't need protection"
Harry let himself go a bit against him, allowing him to escort him into the bathroom and let the shower run. Then Malfoy's hands were on him again. They grabbed the bottom edge of the shirt and pulled it off his head. Harry looked up until his eyes met his and knew he could say it… that he had to say it or he would go mad.
"Harry."
"I think I remember what happened" he replied, before shaking his head "And you won't like it"
Harry crumpled the newspaper angrily.
Harry froze with his jeans in hand and turned to face him. Even your ego… even his ego, as well as his stupidity? Or even his ego as well as the stupidity of Draco's elusive crush boy.
He licked his lips, watching Malfoy's expert fingers disappear between his own buttocks. He opened the condom sachet with his fingers, unable to look away. For a second, the play of light on the former Slytherin's face took his breath away.
He untied his legs from his hips, lying motionless and sweaty as Potter slumped on the sofa next to him. Breath interspersed. Draco watched him put his arm to his forehead, his gaze pointed at the ceiling.
obscenely big.
"But you two have sex." It wasn't exactly a question.
"What?"
"Harry Potter," he murmured a little more audibly.
"Maybe I'm as crazy as you are ... but I liked it"
That moron! He had to stop it before ...
And nothing. Not even the slightest reaction. I licked my lips and moved closer to him. Our arms brushed for a thousandth of a second, giving me a series of sparks, but Potter seemed not to even notice.
And his jeans were in his closet by mistake. Maybe they were even from Dudley.
Harry had gone upstairs and inspected Draco's room until he could locate Roger's compromising photos. He had thrown them into the fireplace and then lay down completely naked, waiting for Malfoy to return.
Harry turned to the house elf, while Hermione finally calmed down.
Draco considered the idea for a moment, before nodding. "I'm going to wake Ron up and…" she said. She started to add something, but in the end she just pressed her lips together in a thin line and walked away.
Draco rubbed his jaw with his hand. He had no idea that there were also dwarves. He grabbed Pansy by the arm. "But at the party ... when I left ... did I go away with someone?" he repeated again, pronouncing the last words well.
Draco Malfoy's boyfriend. Hearing it aloud was much worse than reading it on the pages of the newspaper.
"I have a plan," I retorted. My plan, for the record's sake, would be you, Santa Claus.
"Your mother told me if we want to take the coat of arms and hang it over the fireplace ..."
For me he is gorgeous. He is strong, courageous. He has spectacular green eyes, which make my stomach twist, and messy black hair.
Why look at others when he is breathing a few meters from me?
I was wearing my spectacular new pearl gray coat. I had just been to the hairdresser and my hair was shinier than usual. I felt I was the master of the world. I was fine, I was in love and beautiful.
“I will say that it is all true. I have proof "
"What's this for?" Harry asked, then watching Malfoy form a knot in the middle of the stretch of rope between them.
The thought sent him a wave of excitement directly to the lower abdomen, increasing the urgency of the thrusts. Harry lifted himself up slightly and slipped his hands under Malfoy's knees to place his calves on his shoulders. Malfoy was bloody tall. And above all, damn gorgeous, as he let himself be carried away by the waves of pleasure and indulged in his movements without inhibitions.
he shouted, sending the guy's wand flying off.
He stood still as Harry pointed his wand to his temple again, one side resting against the island. Fingers still hooked to the elastic of his trousers.
He didn't quite know where that protective instinct towards Malfoy came from ... maybe it was caused by the ex-Slytherin's irremediable inability to look after himself, by his innate predisposition to get into the worst situations, by his total lack of common sense … Maybe it came from all these things put together.
He grimaced, watching Draco's blond hair spread across his chest.
What if he was… oh my, what if he was his boyfriend?
"In these cases, the best thing is to resort to Muggle vehicles ... my car is parked in the back"
Or at least give me some advice.
I can prove to him that I am the love of his life, if only he would give me a chance.
"Don't make me ask," he whispered and Draco realized that somehow it was important to him… that he would hurt him if he just walked away. He gently patted his shoulder.
"Do you really think it's possible that ..." he whispered, but his words were cut short by Ron's voice coming from the hall announcing his return.
there are two days left until Christmas and I'm going to be completely smashed by New Year's. So I have to field heavy artillery.
He looked at the words on the paper, as if they could give him an answer. He also crumpled up that note and threw it into the fire. He moved his head from side to side, feeling his neck ache. All the nervous tension was concentrated in the muscle bundles of the neck and shoulders. He massaged himself with one hand before taking a long shower. He would go to bed. Alone. And he would forget everything he remembered or didn't remember. He lay back on the mattress, observing the strange play of shadows on the ceiling. Had he done the same while Potter fucked him?
“Hey, Weasley…” she said, lifting both middle fingers.
Draco shrugged. "Because ..." he murmured, looking at Harry who was helping Molly wash the dishes. He felt his stomach tighten a bit. "Because there is so much between us ... that it could not have started any other way ... there have never been half measures ..."
“I can't go alone. Could you please accompany me? I don't know who else to ask. "
He smiled when he saw Potter standing across the room. The cup of coffee in a hand. He had quickly regained his calm, even if the erection was still visible under the fabric of his trousers.
He leaned against the wall with one shoulder, trying to control his breathing. His side hurt like hell. He ran a hand through his hair, removing even the last fragments of dust.
"Stop for a second," Harry whispered, taking his hand with which he was slicing an apple. "Look at me"
"The two of us sitting at a table having dinner," Malfoy replied angrily.
Draco
"But there would be nothing wrong with that if you ..." George said showing an evil expression.
Malfoy opened his lips more, taking in as much of his erection as he could and sucked. For a moment Harry thought he was lost, then regained control, digging his fingers into his hair and making him lift his head. He stared at those iced eyes for a moment, before reversing positions and letting him lie down under him.
He needed it not true!
He snapped an arm around Malfoy's waist, pulling him against him.
Draco handed him a glass of white wine, which Harry sipped slowly as he cooked. At that time he should perhaps have been at the table with The Weasleys ... perhaps it was time for gifts ...
Molly folded her hands dreamily. "A beautiful wedding ..." she sighed before turning serious. “But you got married in secret. Young man, does your mother know? "
Harry laughed too, setting the beer down on the table and folding his arms across his chest. "I was with a ... friend," he replied, unsure what word to use to define Malfoy.
Before he could stop her, Pansy walked out into the alley. She confidently walked the distance that separated her from the reporters and then slipped into the group. After a moment Draco saw her firmly grab a reporter's buttock.
I don't sleep anymore, I don't eat anymore.
There are exactly nine days to December 25th and I don't want to spend another Christmas without him.
Hermione stared at him for a long time, before biting her lip and looking away. She had slightly shiny eyes. "Stupid pregnancy hormones," she whispered, shaking her head slowly.
(See the end of the chapter for
After two more pints, I had become Ronald Weasley's best friend.
"That's not true," Draco muttered, pulling his hand up to his cheek. The thumb lightly caressed his cheekbone. “You were with me on one of the worst nights of my life. And today you came here, with me ... I could not have imagined a better greeting for my father, Potter. I will not forget it. "
Narcissa covered her mouth with her hands, taking a step back and then falling into a chair. She began to cry. Not the subdued and dignified crying that Draco had seen repeated over the years, but a sprawling cry with big tears running down her cheeks and her chest sobbing. Draco had never seen her react that way.
Draco reflected that years of war had made his sleep light. He kissed him without even opening his eyes. It was an intimate, lazy kiss… like they had all the time in the world.
I raised my eyelids, strands of my hair brushing his forehead. "I've been dreaming of doing it since the sixth year"
Draco
Harry distinctly felt a shiver of fear mixed with disgust trotting down his spine. "No, I'm not," he replied, sinking his head between his shoulders and sinking his hands into his pockets.
"How far is this frozen lake?" he asked, making a small grimace.
Last chapter! Hope you like it :-)
, he told himself.
What orphanage? What library? Which check? What the hell is he talking about?
And for God's sake why was Malfoy touching him?
"No," murmured the former Slytherin. "I'm serious ... let's pretend it didn't happen ..."
He was unleashing a series of uppercuts when an owl landed on a bench. Harry unrolled the note recognizing the handwriting.
"Thanks," Harry replied, settling himself against the pillows and leaning over to kiss him lightly.
I wanted to get close and say hello, but I was afraid. What if he found me uglier than the guy?
"That way"
Malfoy didn't answer right away, just shifting slightly on the towel. An arm folded under the nape, a hand softly resting on the belly. His face turned towards him, his eyelids still lowered.
"Can I have your autograph?"
This didn't help me. Potter is not fine alone, he is fine with me, his Draky. He just doesn't know yet.
Draco's eyes widened and he was forced to lean back in his chair so as not to collapse to the floor. His face was completely devoid of color.
Keep your fingers crossed!
It wasn't the violence or the blood. He was used to that. It was the boy's eyes that made him collapse. They were so ... young, scared. As soon as death came, he had seen the transformation dissolve and give way to the true form of the werewolf: he was a ten-year-old boy. The stupeficium launched by Harry had hit him in the chest, throwing him back into the empty stairwell. He had broken his neck. Harry wanted to stay for ... he didn't even know what for, but his captain had sent him away instantly.
"Don't cut him out ... he's here to stay, not to stay hidden in the attic," she whispered in his ear before moving away. Harry looked up as Malfoy came downstairs, an indecipherable expression on his face, but his back was straight, his shoulders weren't hunched as he often did when he was tired or injured.
Draco arched an eyebrow in the most pathetic of his father's aristocracy imitations, but Harry didn't give him time to utter a single syllable before grabbing him by the arm and pushing him into the house.
Weasley turned to me, frowning, a symptom of some pale activity inside the skull. He struggled a bit with himself before articulating my name.
"Oh, no, I'm sure you would approve," he mused darkly.
"Get your things," he growled, lacing his fingers with Draco's.
He brought his fingers to his temples, which were battered by a fierce headache. He inhaled deeply, trying to quell the murderous instincts ... at least for the moment.
It was a bloody conspiracy. He could almost hear Fred mess with laughter in the grave.
"You were saying ..."
"The Weasleys and my mother didn't find it so absurd"
Dear Santa Claus,
"I have to admit it, Malfoy," he said. His fingers worked their way under the fabric, stroking the bare skin of his leg. And then they slowly climbed up ... inviting ... possessive ... "Last night I discovered that you can do things that I would never have imagined with that damn mouth"
"That they got absorbed by the vest," Harry said, pulling the jacket back to reveal a protective vest he was wearing underneath.
Draco just nodded. He recognized the curse, it was not very common in England due to the material from which the wands were made ... it was mostly used by armed gangs in South America. European woods were not suitable for that kind of spell.
Somehow, he had pissed him off. Again. It was amazing how they quickly understood each other about the most important things and how they constantly argued about everything else.
And Harry laughed.
Harry pretended to think about it. "Nah ... I prefer to watch you while you prepare all the summaries and screens to pass the exam from ..."
Draco rolled his eyes, setting the kettle on the fire. "My apartment is fine," he replied automatically. He picked up some cups as his mother grabbed Harry's hand and led him to the kitchen table. She stroked his bearded cheek, looking at him as if seeing him for the first time.
My fingers searched for his as the pleasure increased and finally exploded in tortuous streams that ignited every part of my body. I clung to the headboard, Harry's teeth marking my neck as he came with brutal thrusts. My seed on his abdomen, his sweat on me.
Harry nodded to him and led him into the house. It was bloody cold. He lit the fireplace and took two glasses from the cabinet, after taking off his Auror jacket.
Harry trapped his fingers in his own. "I'm fine," he assured him. "They gave me a couple of days off and ..."
Thanks for your letter.
"There is nothing wrong, dear. We love you anyway" Molly said, covering his hand with hers.
Harry burst out laughing, picking up his beer and taking a sip. “Yeah, we slept together,” he replied, looking back on vacation days with Malfoy.
Malfoy grabbed him by the hair, slowly lifting his hips to meet his movements. "Fuck me… I've been expecting you to fuck me for years, Potter… it was…" he whispered, sliding his hand between their bodies and lowering his boxers to his hips. Harry's erection rubbed against his abdomen, the tip moist with pre-orgasmic liquid. "The longest fucking preliminaries in history ..." he said, then brushing his jaw with his teeth.
Harry had been mulling over most of the afternoon: is the invitation for the evening still valid or not? After all, he didn't mind going to a Quidditch game and Malfoy had surprisingly shown that he could stay good and quiet without poisoning his life too much with his insipid presence.
"For the moment, nobody," Harry replied. His face had a beautiful color again, only a shadow of a beard darkened his cheeks. Draco studied him with a clinical eye, then undoing a button on his denim shirt to check his chest. The purple stain of the curse had been reabsorbed, there were not even faint yellowish traces.
Malfoy stopped. The long coat made him appear even taller. "You can not"
"I'll take you to the car," Harry said, breaking free from Draco's embrace, who held him back by imprisoning a hem of his denim shirt between his fingers. “I'll take Granger to the car. It is better that you do not go out yet ... "
Harry ran his fingers over his rough beard jaw. “I am gone, I think. But he didn't write to me either. "
Dear Santa Claus,
Harry rumbled when he saw the title of Rita Skeeter's article:
Harry claims you didn't bring him, so I'm writing you this letter to tell you what happened - although I'm sure you already know.
After ten o'clock in the evening only bad news came. It was an inescapable astrophysical law.
The first thing that struck him as soon as he woke up was the knowledge that he was not in his room in Grimmauld Place.
"I don't want to know"
“Nothing… a trifle… sorry, I'm late. Can we go now?"
Harry bit his lower lip, writing a dedication on the page.
"But…"
Draco broke free from his embrace, retrieving the cup. "It's the effect of the curse ... You risked dying and now …” Draco said.
He found Malfoy in the kitchen preparing a fruit and vegetable extract. His hair was damp. Even from a few steps away he could smell the scent of his bubble bath. "How long have I slept?" he murmured, rubbing his face with one hand.
Harry unbuckled a glove with his teeth and then tossed it aside. “Look, Malfoy, I pissed you off. It seemed like a nice gesture to apologize, ”he replied. In one part of his brain Hermione was yelling at him. As soon as he looked up at the former Slytherin he realized he was furious.
Harry exhaled loudly, swallowing a couple of insults. "Okay," he finally said. "I send an owl to Hermione and ask her to stay here with you ..."
“Let's go, the Aurors will seal the house. You can't do anything here"
"To be gay" he replied in a faint voice.
Everyone was staring at him except Ron.
"Why on earth would I be gay?"
Harry felt the features of his face twist into an outraged smirk.
Draco gave her a little nod, hoping she wouldn't kill Weasley.
"It matches the color of your eyes" observed the former Slytherin, adjusting it around his neck.
The line of dark hair on his abdomen. His fingers buttoning jeans.
"The point is ..?" Harry asked pinning him with his eyes.
He was pretty sure that Ron carefully avoided the topic of "favoring Draco Malfoy" and Hermione had disappeared the day before for one of her retreats at the library.
He grimaced, looking at a majestic bouquet of gerberas and tulips, placed in a vase.
"Do you think I don't approve?"
And it had been wonderful. Harry felt happy. For the first time there was nothing that ...
Potter doesn't want me. Well, it's not a tragedy. Of course I feel bad now, but with a little time I think it will pass.
Unfortunately my elves and I are very busy with the preparations for Christmas Eve and I cannot reply to all the correspondence I receive. I assure you, however, that I read all the letters of all the children of the world.
He nodded, waiting for Harry to join him. The valley of snow and ice stretched out below them. Harry had never seen anything like it. If the snowy meadows around Hogwarts had something magical, the Alps between Switzerland and Italy possessed a wild and rugged charm. "There is a long tradition of mountaineering in England. Wizards and Muggles challenged each other from the mid-nineteenth century to the second half of the twentieth century to conquer the highest peaks on the planet ... it didn't really matter who among wizards and muggles reached the top first ... the important thing was that he was English ... " Malfoy said, fixing his gaze on an indefinite point in that sea of white.
“Oh, come on! You get fucked by Harry Potter and then you come up with the I don't remember shit. Bring out the hottest details "
"Indeed ... maybe it would be better to rely on a specialist, someone who can handle this kind of thing"
Harry shrugged, biting into a cookie.
"That's why I got you a takeaway breakfast," Harry replied, setting it all on a table. Then he walked over to him as he was taking off his running shirt. He touched his spine with his fingers and felt him shiver under his touch. "And I'd like to invite you to dinner on Friday"
Malfoy's lips were curled in a half smile, his eyes filled with a mischievous light as Harry slipped a hand into his bathing suit and closed his fist on him. Malfoy's cock was long and hard. "Did you expect me to do this?" Harry growled, accompanying his words with firm flicks of the wrist.
"The drawer ... of the nightstand ..." he murmured between kisses.
"I'm sorry, honey," Pansy murmured, her knees pulled against her chest, a fake pout curling her lips. "I swear to you I had no idea it was illegal"
As soon as he returned to the living room he noticed that the bottles and empty bags of chips were gone. Potter had dressed too and was making coffee. Somehow the atmosphere had changed compared to just before.
"I was always torn between the desire to fuck you, get pissed off and punch you ... but somehow the last two always won over the first"
I retrieved my coat and Apparated to Malfoy Manor. The house was immersed in the quiet Christmas silence and the lights that the elves had placed shone in every room, immersing the whole villa in a magical atmosphere.
Harry snapped his tongue, nodding in encouragement.
"The two of us. Fucking "I repeated, while the humiliation grew out of all proportion. The more Potter didn't understand, the more I felt like I was dying.
I've done it! You can even call me a genius if you like.
His whole body was shaking uncontrollably. Harry gently stroked his hair, letting him continue sobbing and screaming until he was hoarse. He never knew how long they stood there on the cold floor. Harry was just trying to cover Malfoy as much as possible to keep him from getting cold… to squeeze him as much as possible to keep him from falling apart.
"…rude"
Harry spent the next day thinking about what he should say or do, but he couldn't find an answer. He also wrote several letters, but tore them up one after the other. At work he was so distracted that he kept making trivial mistakes. In the end, he said that he felt unwell and that he would go home a little earlier.
There were books piled up in the living room. And in the bedroom. Even in the bathroom. Nonetheless, Hermione kept saying that she had been shamefully left behind in the homework during the year they had spent fighting Voldemort and that she absolutely had to pass exams, otherwise her whole life would have been a complete failure. Or something like that.
there is nothing wrong with being gay"
Hands touched, caressed… sneaked everywhere.
The cold evening air descended into his lungs, wiping the sweat from his face. He climbed over the fence that surrounded the garden and began to walk the gravel path that climbed up the hill. The breath condensed in front of his mouth in small clear clouds.
Santa Claus
He avoided London more and more often. The war had left him disillusioned and tired; the prison had brought him to depression, draining his will to live and have any social contact. His mother had asked the best doctors for a consultation, had done everything possible to keep him alive… to keep him with them. She carved out small portions of happiness, dedicating a morning of shopping and a lunch with her son.
"Sure, go ahead" he said and the chubby girl walked away happy.
And I must say that nothing smarter could come out of a Weasley's mouth. I smiled amiably, putting a handful of galleons on the bar.
Harry wished he were more sober. "Did I hurt you?" whisper. He started to touch him again when Malfoy turned to him. On his face he had an expression that he had only seen a few times. The horrible feeling of having done something wrong closed his stomach.
Getting fucked by you, you piece of idiot. But at the moment I'm content with just making conversation. I was about to say it, but I held back. I actually didn't know what to say. I stood there, looking for something that could make me stop being hated by him, when Potter took some money out of the back pocket of his jeans, leaned over the bar, retrieved two beers and left the money in place.
Malfoy had looked at him, a long, hateful glance before hurrying out of the pub. Harry wanted to follow him, but he was too drunk ... Better to tell himself he was drunk, rather than admit he didn't want his fellow Aurors to know ... rather than see him with someone else ...
He was about to turn off the light when a barn owl landed on his windowsill.
"I know," Harry replied, surrounding him with both arms.
Harry shrugged. “I don't know, but he doesn't want to see me anymore and I have no idea how to convince him otherwise. And then ... then he is right. There is a whole part of my life that he cannot be a part of. Can you imagine it here ... with the Weasleys at Christmas? " “Harry?”
"Had he ever tried ..." he murmured, hating himself for that, but he had to make sure it was suicide.
Dear Santa Claus,
His announcement was greeted by a chorus of mockery that he could not stand alcohol. Harry shielded himself with a vague wave of his arm. He still hadn't been able to figure out what to do, but his mind couldn't rest. Malfoy's expression ... his words ... the former Slytherin he knew would never admit that he had hurt him ...
“You never mentioned his name. You were careful not to provide any clues about the mysterious man apart from one: it was the first Christmas without his father. Last year you officially handled nine homicides and three suicides. None of these involved a person we know. But ... there is a fourth case.
"I want to give you the opportunity to invite me to tonight's Quidditch match. Wasps vs Cannons. Obviously, it will be a massacre for your team "
Three seconds had passed. And Hermione still hadn't answered. Why hadn't Hermione answered yet? "Why does Mrs. Weasley think I'm gay?" Harry yelled accusingly, taking a couple of steps into the room. Hermione jumped out of bed.
Not only had he fucked him over and over ... it was Potter who had the idea of getting married. He was the one who said I do. Harry widened his eyes a little, placing his hands on his shoulders. "What?"
"I've always done what others expected of me," Harry replied, placing his hands on his hips. His expression was serious and intense, so much so that Draco was afraid of it. "If for once ..."
She laughed, punching him in the arm. “Why did you say that? I'm not going to stop thinking about it now. ” She blurted out, getting to her feet as Ginny walked over to her and said something about the baby girl dresses Molly was making and wanted to show her. Harry waited for them to leave before dragging Draco to a quiet corner of the garden.
Harry thought about it, there was something deeply wrong with this whole story. He just couldn't figure out what.
He silently dressed and then retrieved a paper and a quill from his desk.
How could he have been so stupid?
And with no need to add anything else, Malfoy's fingers undid one of the jacket's buckles. The pain flared up blazing, causing him to collapse in the arms of the former Slytherin. His breath came out in harsh gasps between his teeth. He tried to get to his feet but a stab of pure pain pierced his chest.
On the other hand ... when a nice girl asks you something you can't refuse, can you?
He was a good person. Courageous. Who always tried to do the right thing. Why did God, Merlin or destiny ... decide to put Draco Malfoy on his road?
Harry arched his head back, giving him free access to his neck. Malfoy's tongue followed the line of his throat and then his head moved down. Malfoy closed his lips on Harry's nipple, sucking hard enough to make him gasp.
Harry was deathly pale, his skin covered in cold sweat. He held a hand on his chest where a purple spot throbbed as if it were alive. Draco watched the tentacles of infection spread over his body, purple and yellow streaks. As soon as Harry saw him, he gritted his teeth, trying to stop screaming in pain.
"In the Burrow," Harry replied, returning to focus on what he was doing. He flipped the prawns, checking the cooking.
The mirror gave him the image of a pale and hollow face. A shadow of beard on the cheeks. A purple bruise on the neck. He turned on the tap and cupped his hands. He threw cold water on his face, without feeling better.
"It's nothing," Harry whispered, feeling his heart foolishly speed up.
Hermione rolled her eyes before returning to her files.
"Yup?"
Malfoy's diabolical plan continues, Harry is increasingly convinced that his jeans have nothing wrong and strange thoughts start to pop into his mind ... strange thoughts regarding the blond guy ...
"If I were you, I'd be quiet," Draco muttered darkly. Pansy closed her mouth with a snap, settling herself cross-legged in the chair. Draco jumped to his feet, starting to pacing the room. The effects of the potion on memory could last for several days. He had already tried to distil an antidote, but he had only recovered fragments of memories ...
“Because you're an asshole, Harry. I should have made you spend a lot more. Now go, I have work to do, ”she said, dismissing him with a wave of her hand.
“Because that's how she is. Sometimes I think that no matter how much I do, I will never be able to be enough for Hermione.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy nodded his head, biting his lower lip. "Promised," he whispered, before Harry went down the steps and dematerialized, unable to convince himself that he was not crazy like Malfoy.
"Because ..." Potter replied, lifting himself up on one elbow "If I don't fuck you right away, I'm afraid I'll come in my pants"
We have reached the end of the story. I hope you liked it ... if you like, leave me a comment :-)
"Nothing, I saw you go talk to Potter ..."
"I do not know. What if he treated me well and he was a bank robber? Or worse ... if he treated me well and was ... "
Eventually, Malfoy narrowed his lips to a thin line, giving a small nod. “You can use the bathroom upstairs. Why don't you take a hot bath? "
Harry placed his hand in the center of Malfoy's back. After a moment he reached his hand up to his shoulder. Malfoy didn't grow tense at his touch. Harry got the feeling that the former Slytherin was indulging in the caress of his hand. Harry just squeezed his shoulder as the former Slytherin turned towards him. "I'm sorry for your father, Malfoy"
The wand materialized in his hand, even before his brain was able to decipher what was in front of him: the two glasses of butterbeer spilled on the floor, Draco pressed against the wall... Roger standing in front of him ...
"What does it have on you?" Harry asked suddenly. Roger blushed up to the hairline, hunching his shoulders a bit as if hoping to disappear.
“I know, Malfoy. Put your hands down,” he said gently. He put his arm around his waist and helped him up. "Come ... let's get out of here"
He closed his fist on Malfoy's erection, brutally masturbating him until he felt his semen dripping between his fingers. Then Harry grabbed him by the waist and threw him onto the mattress, slamming his cock into him in the frenzy of the last thrusts. His vision darkened for a moment as he dropped onto Malfoy's sweaty back.
The scent of Malfoy's skin on him, like an impalpable inscription on his flesh. Harry covered his forehead with his arm, trying to calm his breath.
The girl shrugged, pouring herself some pumpkin juice. “Yeah…” she confirmed “You're cute together,” she added as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
"Malfoy," Harry exhaled in a low rumble.
And it had never worked.
After Pansy fixed me up and after I downed the rest of the drink, I got up and made my way through the dancing people.
Potter was undoubtedly naked. One arm folded under the head, the other hand placed on the abdomen. Draco had tried to get himself to leave after dinner, but then Harry had made some very stupid comments about Quiddicth and he had had to prove him wrong.
I passed the Quidditch store when I saw a stand of losers collecting offers for the orphanage. Now. Everyone can choose to spend their time as they want. Personally I'd rather lie in bed with Potter and fuck in every conceivable position, but who am I to judge?
"Fuck," Draco exhaled. He was retrieving the memories too slowly. He had no idea where he and Potter had gone once they left the club, he hoped they'd just reached his apartment where they'd fucked again, but Draco wasn't so sure.
Draco stood still, his lips frighteningly cold beneath Harry's. "Don't ..." he murmured, watching him in fear. "You're not serious, are you?"
"You wish. I'm just wondering if you didn't arrange everything to kill me "
Draco
His tongue could do magic on his skin.
"I'll never get you to cancel a ticket, Mr. Potter," Harry replied, kissing him again.
"You particularly liked that ..." he commented.
"I see it," replied the former Slytherin, unbuttoning his uniform jacket. He slid it off his shoulders and then tossed it to the floor. Harry grimaced in pain, moving his shoulder slowly. He didn't even know where he hit or when. Malfoy gently brushed his hair back, carefully examining his scalp to see if there were any injuries there either. "Let's clean up all this blood," he muttered, sliding an arm around his back.
He stroked his forehead with his fingertips. "I know you're scared"
Harry closed his eyes for a moment as he thought back to how wonderful the sex with Draco Malfoy "…unexpected."
She updated him on the extension of the greenhouses, on the orchids, on the horses, on the white peacocks, on how much his father hated the new gardener. Draco smiled recognizing the usual dynamic between his parents, the usual talk. They must have loved each other very much. What had happened to their family could have destroyed them, but they had found themselves even more united.
And Draco was really convinced that nothing had happened until he went back to his apartment and saw the note lying on the pillow. The sheets had been changed, but somehow he realized that he had passed a point of no return… he would never be able to look at his bed again without imagining Harry Potter lying there.
Draco swallowed a lump of excitement, preventing himself from focusing on Potter's bare feet on the parquet. They were long, thin. He started to ask him to leave again, when Potter's lips curled into an indecent smile.
It was the first clause of their relationship!
And it was again with that Auror who had made him laugh.
"Well, I
"What do you know that ..."
Draco leaned on his elbows, Pansy waved to be seen by the barman who was bravely ignoring her. He stopped her in time when she pulled out her wand and started to curse him.
He could hear him breathe on the other side.
Draco was about to reply when the veracity of that statement petrified him. The beer, the damn beer Pansy had given him. She had recommended that he drink it before he went to talk to Potter ... and afterwards he felt good, he felt so free ... so uninhibited ...
"Yeah…" Harry replied in a sigh, closing his fist on his erection. Draco groaned his name. Again and again. Clinging to his shoulders and sinking his fingers into his skin so hard that it left marks.
a boyfriend," continued the former Slytherin, completely unaware of Potter's reasoning. "Except that things have become a little ..." he continued, waving his hand as if to help himself find the right word.
Pansy just arched an eyebrow. "I didn't think you were that traditional ..." he said in a tone that made Ron's ears go red.
"It's Malfoy now," Harry replied, leaning over to give him a quick kiss on the lips. Draco slid his hands down his back.
“Mh?”
He kept his eyes on the wizards until he was sure that the former Slytherin was far enough away not to notice his gaze following him.
Pansy lit up as the coffee finally began to take effect. "What a bitch ... who did you fuck?" she asked, pulling one leg up against her chest. She lit a cigarette, which Draco hastened to put out. Then he made her lower her leg.
Harry felt his stomach twitch slightly. Malfoy was also thinking about him. To that afternoon.
"You should have. You are my boyfriend "
“I book. Now go away "
I threw my coat on the chair and poured myself a whiskey. I just wanted to drink until I was dizzy. This was the plan, but when I entered my bedroom, I saw him.
Malfoy stopped in front of him, adjusting the collar of his jacket better. He had lent him all the equipment, adjusting his boots with a spell that were very wide and his trousers too long.
He looked at Pansy standing in the doorway. The smile on her lips for once wasn't sarcastic or contemptuous. She mouthed that she was going to tell the Aurors how Harry was doing and then be back.
Harry felt his throat go dry, his gaze plunging into the vision of the boy's pale chest. The narrow hips ... the well-defined abdomen ... there was not a single portion of skin that he hadn't covered with his tongue.
"What?"
"Thank you," he said when I gave him the check. My bank account was crying. Potter's eyes widened. Okay, I admit I was blatantly generous, but I need him to fuck me.
"Cognac Jenssen Arcana ... it was my father's favorite," he said, getting to his feet. He pulled up his glasses, looking at the landscape. It looked like an alien universe. The sky was incredibly blue and the cold sun made the snow glisten.
"I didn't know you were doing charity," he added at the end.
"Are we talking about the friend you called ... that night?" Hermione encouraged him. Harry hated her for always being so intuitive.
"There were no cats ... and you mind your own business, Parkinson," he replied in a voice higher than an octave. Pansy leaned back a little, giving him a look that could have set fire to a forest. "Or what…?"
Harry couldn't even find the strength to lift his eyelids when Draco crouched beside him.
"It's decided," she cut it short, then pausing in front of Harry. Her expression suddenly softened. She stroked his cheek looking at him with so much affection that Draco was forced to look away. "Some things have to be celebrated in the family," she whispered. Harry hesitated just a moment before hugging her tightly. She gave him a couple of pats on the back, then popped a kiss on the temple.
"Sixteen hours," replied the former Slytherin, putting a cup in his hand.
Hermione just arched an eyebrow. "I see it," she replied, holding his gaze for a moment before bursting out laughing. “Oh, come on, Harry,” Hermione snapped. “I know you weren't with your uncles. Be good ... throw me a bone”.
And there was not even an insult. Not even a little little one.
He stopped in front of a shop window, looking at the new Nimbus model. Aerodynamics, the tail made with the best saggina wood ...
“I give up, Malfoy. Open your legs so at least I can fuck you again, since I can't make a serious speech "
"Malfoy," he called aloud, his heart pounding hard in his ribcage. "Malfoy," he repeated, leaning with all his weight on the bar of one of the outer doors.
"Fuck…" he whispered, tightening his grip on the sheets as Draco's movements became more urgent.
Draco looked into his eyes, feeling something writhing painfully in his chest. He brushed his cheek with his thumb, realizing it was all he had ever wanted… he had longed for years for Potter to look at him as he was doing right now.
"I wouldn't have flirted with Hannah Abbott!"
He knelt on the deck of the boat, between his legs, enjoying the wait ... the exciting vision of Malfoy, naked under him. His incredibly strong and elegant body.
Harry took a sip of beer, leaning with the base of his back on the island in the middle of the kitchen. Hermione was very good at that kind of manoeuvre: she had invited him to dinner, making the excuse that they hadn't seen each other at Christmas, then she had sent Ron and the children to get the pizzas, even if they could have them delivered to their homes, and finally she had thrown in there a seemingly harmless comment about her skin having a nice glow.
Harry shivered. His hands were still caked with blood and he couldn't stop shaking.
Potter grimaced, picking up a pair of worn jeans from the floor.
Hermione preceded him out the door as Harry sank back into sleep.
"He wanted to convince me to come back with him," added the ex Slytherin without looking at him.
Harry shrugged, grabbing the kettle, and filling it with water. Kreacher must have gone out shopping.
Harry arched an eyebrow, glancing at her.
He stared at me, lips curled in a grimace.
"Fuck" he growled, grabbing the wooden jamb with his fingers and unleashing a powerful kick that collapsed the frame and rotated the door on its hinges.
“This is why you never listen to me, Ron! Even Rose knew it "
What could I order to not look like a jerk? "A beer"
"I'm not going to sign it," Draco replied, giving him a frustrated groan.
"And in any case, everyone will keep his surname"
"I have no scratches," he replied.
She gave him an impatient look, taking the hot cup of coffee. She sipped it slowly and Draco waited patiently for the magic of the drink to take effect. When Pansy's eyelids returned to reveal their dark irises, he pulled his chair closer to the table. He was so agitated that he couldn't even keep his legs still. “What happened at the party? Did you see me go away with someone? "
"No ..." Draco whispered, slowly licking his lips "You're mine, Potter"
Draco walked over to her again, taking the teapot out of her hands. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting guests," she said, without looking at him.
Now, Harry didn't expect his ex-girlfriend to take up his defense, declaring before her whole family that he was an absolutely heterosexual stud stud ... but ...
Not to mention that all of this happened before… the night of the girls and the werewolf and you assured me that night that you called a friend and that you were not alone.
I was returning to my office after a particularly boring lunch. I hate clients, they should all be wiped off the face of the earth. The only thing that keeps me from starting to shoot unforgivable curses is the equation clients = money = lots of good things for Draco.
"I have activated a function on your phone so I can always see where you are"
"…that makes you Uninhibited, I know," Potter interrupted, holding out a sheet of paper in his direction. Draco took it and quickly read it. Blood analysis. They found traces of the substance in Potter's blood. So it was true, that damned fool had drugged him.
Draco just nodded. “First time in Azkaban. With the sheets. My uncle Rodolphus and I took him down before The Dementors…” he whispered, biting his bottom lip hard. Something stirred in the depths of his gaze, but Draco was quick to choke it.
He squeezed a generous dose into the congested skin, starting to massage it.
Maybe Dudley was the gay one.
He tore his fingers out of his body as Potter stepped between his legs. Potter's hands slowly ran along his thighs in contrast with the frantic gestures of earlier. He took his time to study the expression on his face. When he smiled at him, Draco realized he was being screwed.
Harry was about to reply that for him yes, there was a big difference, but Malfoy took a few steps closer. Once again his intense and intelligent eyes nailed him. "Let's not make it any more unpleasant than necessary," Malfoy whispered, brushing his cheek with the back of his fingers. "Find a nice Gryffindor who loves you and get married, Potter" he murmured, leaning over him to touch the corner of his mouth with his lips.
Dear Santa Claus,
Hermione put a hand on his arm, stroking it softly. "I know. Talk to him ... if it goes wrong, he casts a spell on you. "
"Former Death Eaters," Harry whispered, wetting his lips with the tip of his tongue.
Malfoy was lying in the bathtub. He was covering his face with his hands. Some water had fallen to the floor. And on the carpet beside the tub gleamed a razor blade from his cabinet above the sink.
“Unfortunately, no, his body has to dispose of the poison. The next two hours will be hellish ..."
If he had laughed, he would have died of shame.
I need to get fucked by Harry Potter. I need it so much that my skin always seems to be on fire. If only I could I would rip it off me.
He watched Molly stuff the roses into a large vase and then continue gazing at them. They were so beautiful that he hadn't been able to throw them away, but at the same time he didn't want to keep them at home. He raised his head slightly as Hermione went to sit next to him by the fireplace. The children were playing quietly on the carpet.
you are a genius. I'm serious! Being good works! It really works!
"The one at the end of the corridor, but I don't use it anymore ... I settled in the one next to my father’sto keep an eye on it even at night." Draco replied. Harry watched him walk into a sparse room and mechanically fill a bag with essential items.
crossed his mind before his tongue stroked the tip of his erection and caused him a deep wave of arousal.
“He knows Roger's death is a bluff. He's waiting for you to run to the Ministry to stop him. "
Malfoy just laughed, a sound so unusual for him that Harry turned to glance at him. "Didn't you want a family Christmas?" he replied, running his fingers through his hair. Eyes closed. Harry took a second to look at him, feeling his hands tingle with the desire to touch him. Mafoy must have noticed, but stood still. The chest rose and fell slowly following the rhythm of breathing. The sailboat pitched, driven by the wind. The sound of the sea was hypnotic. Everything seemed to conspire to make him forget who he was ... who he was with ...
Sex had swept everything away, as if they tacitly agreed not to get involved ... as if sex and intimacy were too much to manage ...
“It was on
"I'd still prefer you to do it sober," he added, when Potter took another sip.
Draco had greeted him with the warmest and most false of smiles, especially aimed at the lenses of photographers or the eyes of his ex-boyfriend, who could be crouched in the shadows.
It is my concern to inform you that your actions are punishable by the XXXXX legislation, aimed at protecting the victims of stalking.
, he thought, starting to punch again, but he was distracted. The ears attentive to every little noise, the muscles tense. He was feeling fifteen again when he was still trying to be straight and chasing Cho in the corridors of Hogwarts. He lost his rhythm when he finally heard footsteps approaching.
Six weeks had passed since the night of the slaughter of girls. Harry had been suspended from duty and then reinstated after his therapist had given permission. Autumn had turned into December and Harry had found himself immersed in the Christmas mood before he could fully realize it.
"It's a precaution for when you disappear and I don't know where you have ended up ..."
"Why did you stop?" Draco whispered with broken breath. He didn't even know anymore if he was excited about what he had just relived or about Potter half lying on him. His hand in his boxers.
"Wake up ..." whispered the fatal voice. A finger crossed the bridge of his nose in a gentle caress. He lifted one eyelid, laboriously bringing the face bent over him into focus.
Malfoy stopped. His eyes were invisible hidden behind the heavy glasses that protected him from the glare of the sun on the snow. "My father was the expert"
Thanks for your letter.
"He is my husband. We got married last week "
"Besides, I enjoy having a little slave," he confessed.
Draco looked back at her. "You really are an old lady when you get out of this kind of phrase."
"And have sex," he agreed. Now we agree. We have sex and we agree.
And in those few words everything was summed up: it's done. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, thinking about the signed cancellation papers. Harry hadn't sent them yet but they still had time, they still could ...
"Okay, let's go," he surrendered, turning and reaching the door.
He took a deep breath, remaining standing. "What do you think Dad will say?" he asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
"So, I'm the one who disgust you"
his brain screamed hysterically as he gathered enough dignity to push Malfoy away and sit up.
"Lucky for you, Malfoy ..." Harry continued, leaning over him and tearing his fingers away from his body. A few drops of salt water fell from his hair. Harry grabbed Malfoy's hip, digging his fingers into his skin. His mouth so close to his that he could breathe his breath. "I chose to go to Gryffindors." Harry growled, pushing inside him abruptly.
"To Mary," replied the girl, while her friends melted into another chorus of giggles.
Draco settled himself better against the pillows, starting to laugh.
Potter nodded, glancing at him.
"Where have you been? Even if ... "the girl said, taking another star-shaped cookie from the plate" I think there is no doubt "
The next morning, Malfoy made sure Harry didn't need him and then left. Without a comment. Without a proposal to meet again. Harry was fine with that.
Harry shifted his weight from foot to foot nervously.
I took the letter and put it in my pocket as I left the office and headed to Diagon Alley. I still had to buy gifts for Pansy and my mother and I had absolutely no idea what to come up with this year.
And she wasn't referring to ... anything! She wasn't referring to anything, right?
"The trousers. And the boxers" he ordered.
"And then?"
Molly pursed her lips in an outraged expression. “You…” he exhaled “how could you have given this pain to your mother too? Your mother ... who lives for you. You get married and you don't tell her "
Draco sobbed loudly on his mouth as his orgasm popped out of nowhere, waves of pleasure running through his body, stealing his breath away.
"They'll find out ... please take me home ... the photos after the war ... please ..."
Above all he could not believe he was with Malfoy, in the crystal clear sea of Fiji, on an eight-meter sailboat. As soon as he had proposed it to him, he had thought it was one of his usual pranks that were only meant to embarrass him and make him look like an idiot. But then Malfoy had shown him the tickets for an intercontinental portkey, the receipt for the charter of the sailboat… he would have gone without him too.
“Yes, it's the same friend. He didn't want to spend the first Christmas without his father and wrote to me. That's all"
Draco arched an eyebrow. "Are you asking me out?"
"Did you ..." he hesitated "did you see Roger?" the former Slytherin asked him, his voice vibrating with nervousness.
Harry just arched an eyebrow. “Do you really want to start with the recriminations? Because you know you can't win ... "
thinks. I don't want people who think. I want people who know.
"Do you come here often?" i tried again.
"No ... if you make me a coffee"
What should I do? Please, Santa, help me.
"Put on your pajamas," he ordered, leaving the room to wash his hands. Harry got rid of the towel, wearing a pair of comfortable pants and a shirt. He ran his hands through his still wet hair, trying to quell the tremor that kept shaking him. He could hear Malfoy moving into the other room, opening and closing lockers ... His light footsteps on the floor.
“Do you realize that you are already considering this? If it was just a fuck, you would have enjoyed it until you lose interest or get bored ... "
Hermione sighed, settling herself better on her back. "Yeah ... you've always been explosive ..." she also looked at Harry for a few seconds. "He's happy" he murmured "I don't know how that is possible, but you make him happy ... I've never seen him like this ..."
The fresh evening air, the smell of grass ...
Even after Draco got tired of him, the running remained. It freed his mind of any thought: work and especially those damned cancellation papers that had remained locked in the top drawer of his desk.
They talked quietly, before they resumed walking, Harry continued to follow them at a safe distance. After a few minutes, they stopped in front of a shop.The girl kissed Roger again before entering the store, leaving him waiting for her on the sidewalk.
Pansy laughed so hard that some heads turned in her direction. Draco paid the bill and then forced her to get up and follow him out of the restaurant. He bundled up in his elegant coat as Pansy hurried after him down the busy streets of Diagon Alley.
"You would have done the same," he replied, taking a sip of coffee before setting the cup on the counter. Harry ran his hands down his back and Draco realized how tense he was still. He narrowed his eyes as Harry's hands began to gently stroke his tense muscles. He had only slept a couple of hours, always ready to run to Harry in case he needed him.
"It won't give you any trouble," he declared, his voice slightly hoarse.
Harry closed his eyes, his nose in his hair, his hands on his back. He whispered empty words, which could not ease his pain, but which had been repeated to him on several occasions. Harry didn't think they really had an effect, but Malfoy's screams were so heartbreaking that he would have done anything not to hear him scream like that.
I nodded, I was the portrait of understanding. “You should do something for her. Something special. Like a romantic vacation somewhere "
Only when the former Slytherin gave in to a silent and exhausted cry, Harry dared to make him lift his head.
As much as he hated Muggles, he had to admit that they were great at making running shoes. Since moving to Asics, his knees no longer caught fire every time he crossed a certain number of kilometers. He stopped and bent down to drink from a fountain.
"I've been to Malfoy's," Harry replied, ignoring Ron's moan.
He hugged him, his tongue brushing his lips. Potter's solid body, his sweat-damp skin, his intoxicating scent.
Draco had chosen a bright, modern apartment in central London. He had taken the last of the family's savings and invested them in a small company that made potions. After years of hard work, he was starting to make some profits… it wouldn't make him rich (for that, the investments his father still had were enough) but it was still a start.
He swallowed empty, abandoning himself with a barely audible sob against the girl.
The features of his face distorted and that sort of pre-vomit grin reappeared on his lips.
"Did you go to Malfoy's last night?"
"He'll be fine," he said. He didn't know if the reporters would do as well.
"He knows," replied the young witch, taking a small sip of tea.
glance before passing him the Gazzetta.
"What do you want?" the former Gryffindor attacked him, standing on the threshold. He was wearing just a pair of very soft looking pants and a shirt from some other band that Draco didn't know. "How did you know where I live?"
“No, you will come and get me. The florist has already had instructions for delivering flowers to me. ” Malfoy rattled, reaching the door with quick and elegant movements.
"Mrs. Malfoy ..." he said and Draco loved him for at least trying.
Hermione turned the screen towards her. "Where have you been? Call me as soon as you can! We are opening the gifts ”she said. In England it was evening and it was snowing.
Hermione's words had somehow crept into his brain, because in the following days Harry was about to write to Malfoy to ask him if he would like to go out for a beer. When something funny happened to him, his thoughts went to the former Slytherin ... Harry imagined what he would say about a situation with his witty sense of humor, the way he would look at it ... the way he would curve a corner of the mouth. He felt like an idiot.
"I'll take you home," he murmured, wrapping his arm around his waist. Draco's grip on his shoulder was surprisingly strong, but his whole body was shaking.
Draco smiled to himself. His folks would also be horrified about something else.
He scanned him with his eyes to see if he was hurt. "I'm fine," Harry whispered, his lips dry.
"Eventually I went back to the stadium to see if I could intercept Roger, but the bastard was gone"
Thanks everyone for reading the story so far. I hope you enjoyed this chapter :-)
"You won't like it," she warned him, without being convinced to give him the offending copy.
If he kissed him, would Malfoy throw a punch at him? Or would he blackmail him to continue the play indefinitely?
Harry only managed to nod, continuing to walk, until Malfoy stopped. The former Slytherin pulled out his wand and muttered a spell. The snow began to melt, revealing a thick sheet of ice, which cracked and then broke. The water began to fill the cracks. Dark and cold.
It wasn't a one night stand! Harry wants to be with me, be my boyfriend! Boyfriend, understand?
My quarry arrived about twenty minutes later. Dull look, slouching walk of those with too long legs and a too small cock.
As long as they were fucking or swimming or climbing a mountain everything was fine.
Draco lightly brushed his lips, slowly sliding his hand into his pants. Potter was not wearing boxers. Again. He closed his hand on his cock feeling him react to the contact with his palm.
"Fuck, Malfoy ... you talk about him like he's a horse"
He reached the beer stand, but no sign of Draco.
"For dinner ... you mean ..." he said, biting his lower lip.
"Malfoy!" he thundered. His cheeks burned incredibly.
"Maybe someone hurt me during the fight with the journalists for ..."
Harry stared at him for a matter of seconds, his brain completely unable to connect fully.
"Great," Harry whispered before kissing him again.
Harry frowned, looking at a purple spot on Draco's jaw. A bruise. It was surely a bruise, which stood out in a dangerously sad way on his diaphanous skin. He approached him, but Malfoy instinctively took a step back.
"Okay," Draco murmured, taking a sip of white wine. "You don't get married to make your partner suffer ..."
After half an hour Harry was about to ask Malfoy to stop again, but the former Slytherin turned towards him, indicating a dip.
"It's two in the afternoon"
Maybe that was a date, maybe Potter is in love with him.
"You blackmailed Roger Green, you made the whole of England believe that I was gay ... you told Ryta Skeeter that I have an obscenely big penis ..."
"I have to… ask you one favor… another, in fact," Malfoy muttered, uttering each word as if he were making a huge effort. Harry could trace deep suffering barely concealed by the pallor of his face and the dark circles digging into his cheeks.
Draco shrugged. "No ... what ..."
It was a cold, dark night. The rain hadn't stopped falling for a single second.
Draco clenched his fists even tighter as Pansy lightly touched the back of his hand with her fingers. The doctor finally met his gaze, visibly relieved. "Oh finally, Mr. Malfoy, we've been waiting for you," the woman said, waving him over.
"Apart from Roger Davis, who has been in China for almost two years, only one other Roger comes to mind ... Roger Green, but it can't be him"
Draco groaned, covering his face with one hand. Harry's arm always around his waist. He felt Harry sink his face into the hollow between his neck and shoulder and laugh softly. He slowly turned his head, stroking his hair with his fingers.
"Maybe. Well I like him. "
Harry was about to say yes, but he held himself back, sensing that it wasn't the right answer to give right now. Malfoy had to guess something anyway because he frowned instantly. His hands supported him by the shoulders, so that he could look him in the face.
"Relax," Potter whispered as his hand unfastened his pants. After a moment, Draco felt Potter's strong hand close over his painfully needy erection. He started to ask him how the fuck he thought he could relax when suddenly he found himself at the club.
"I thought you were exhausted after tonight," he grumbled, pulling him over.
"In my opinion you are a beautiful couple"
Ginny shrugged. “Well the Roger I remember would never do such a thing. He looks a lot like Neville ... "
“I'm Potter's husband, so you have two choices: either you let me through, I'll go see how he's doing and then I'll tell you or you'll have to use some spell with no justification. You will be expelled by the Aurors and I will see Harry anyway ... only it will be much longer ... "
"Maybe I am too," Harry murmured, stroking his jaw with his thumb. "It doesn't seem to me that fear has ever stopped us"
"Because he can't mix with my friends, with my family ... be a part of most of my life," he replied, running a hand through his messy hair. "Because he's not someone I want to hang out with ..."
Memories of the previous night came back to his messed up mind like an avalanche.
"I just want you to stay here ... tonight ..."
I stood there staring at him in adoration, with a painful erection, before Pansy woke up from her rant and noticed my condition. It took her seven seconds flat to figure out who I was looking at.
"You could spend all your time having sex," I suggested. Weasley's big red face lit up. He pointed a slightly shaky finger at me and said: "You're a good boy, Malfoy"
He stopped abruptly. "What should I do?" he said, avoiding looking at her. Draco had to admit that she didn't start laughing again.
He gripped his wand in his fingers, lazily turning a spell in the direction of one of the gnomes that haunted the Weasleys' garden. He grimaced when he scoffed at him and dived into a hare's den, disappearing from his sight.
Draco cursed himself for every disgustingly mawkish thought that crossed his mind right now. "Did the neighbors see us?" he whispered against his temple. He felt Harry's chest jump against his with a low laugh.
"I know there would be nothing wrong, but I'm not gay."
He buried his fingers in his hair and let himself be carried away by his movements.
"Believe me ... you don't want to know," Harry muttered, before gripping his wand more firmly. “Okay, we have to move forward. Weasley, Carter and Smith on the right. The others cover. I'm going to take a diversion. ”Harry yelled, coming out and running. He deflected all the spells, then attacked the steps leading into the bank.
He took a deep breath, making large steps towards the door. He had to get out of there. Immediately.
Potter groaned slightly, parting his lips.
Malfoy was naked. The boxers abandoned in a corner. His body was perfect. The narrow hips, a light blonde hair under the navel, the long, straight cock ... Harry felt his mouth fill with saliva from the temptation to lick it.
He looked up when a second owl joined the first. He quickly untied the note from the animal's paw, sensing a bad omen making his stomach twist.
"Is that okay with you?" Hermione interrupted, studying him thoroughly. “Actually no… that's not okay with you. You've decided it has to be that way, "she said and Harry suddenly remembered why she was the brightest witch of their generation. Or perhaps, simply, the person who knew him best in the world.
"Sorry," Harry muttered, hunching his head a little between his shoulders.
"We can sit here and make out ..." Draco said, nibbling lightly on his jaw. Harry would be purring. He lifted his chin a little in order to facilitate the cuddle-a-Potter operation and slid his fingers down Draco's back. He was too dressed. Definitely too much… too much dressed.
"What the fuck do you think I'm doing here, Malfoy?" he replied, nodding to the unmade bed.
Three days later Harry received a package with a bottle of whiskey in it and two tickets to the Cannons game. There was no note. Harry was about to write to Malfoy if he wanted to go with him to see the game, since he had paid for the tickets, but in the end, he decided to ask Ron.
He locked himself in the bathroom, washing himself briefly. He tried to ignore the stupid smile the mirror sent him back.
The feet tilted outwards were the first thing he saw that through an open door. He went on quickly, stopping on the threshold of what looked like a study. Lucius Malfoy was lying on the carpet. A belt tied around the neck, The ghostly face, The hair scattered on the carpet. His snake-headed cane leaning against the desk. An overturned chair. Harry dropped to one knee, placing two fingers on Lucius' carotid, just above the purplish and black mark left by his belt. His skin was cold. Harry exhaled deeply, before turning to Draco.
I bent over the table to fill out the check, my fingers didn't stop shaking for a single moment. "Who do I sign it to?" I asked.
"Why? Aren't you? "
"I should arrest you and whoever put that in the bottle," he said in a low grunt. He brought the face close to his and Draco could see deeply into those green irises. "Pray this thing deflates by itself ... or I'll make you pay for it, Malfoy"
Narcissa and Pansy refused to let him go alone. Her mother was soberly dressed, she had brought a cake and a bottle of wine, trying to be less of an ice queen… Pansy wore shorts, round glasses and combat boots, she seemed ready for a war or a rave party in equal measure. Ron had not been able to take his eyes off her bumps and had risked crashing to the ground several times.
"Are you OK?" he asked, kneeling beside Draco. A trail of blood dripped from his nose and smeared his chin and scarf.
Immediately. First of all. They had to go to the Prophet's Gazette and ...
He parted his lips, welcoming him into his mouth. Potter arched his back on the bed, groaning softly. His fingers in his hair. Draco thought Potter had been right on the first night: he could go on forever ... only with Potter naked in bed.
Harry shrugged, not having a better answer. Malfoy's expression softened only for a moment, before he returned to stare at empty space. "Yeah ... you are the hero of this story. I'm just the mediocre villain. "
The noise of the feather that was broken in half seemed to awaken him suddenly.
"I don't miss him," Harry retorted automatically. He rubbed his forehead with his fingertips. “I mean… I don't know. Over the past two months I've often thought about writing to him… you know when something funny happens to you during the day and you think Oh, tonight I have to tell Ron… just that he wasn't there and… "
"I'm going home," I said, kissing her on the cheek. "stay a little longer. We haven't even drunk the midnight chocolate"
"Offer him a drink," she said, pricking me with her elbow. "You'll never get fucked if you sit here," added Blaise, continuing to browse through a catalog of mountain cottages.
"Ssssht, whatever you have to tell me, you will ..."
"Wait," he whispered, her fingers digging into his skin. He stepped back as Lucius's corpse was carried away on a stretcher, hidden by a dark gray sheet.
The girl shook her head, her curls moved like a stormy sea. "Either you want to be with him or you don't want to be"
"I didn't want to cancel our first date," he whispered, feeling his strength begin to abandon him.
"Why?"
Harry groaned, trying to focus on something moving in the tall grass. More than an English garden, the Weasleys' garden resembled a jungle.
He had the appearance of a kind of cherub, with sunlit hair, aristocratic features ...
“Don’t mind it. Skeeter would write anything just to sell a couple more copies, "said the girl trying to give him courage.
Draco
"Isn't there really something else you would rather do?" he whispered on her mouth, before engaging him in a long kiss.
when I wrote you the previous letter I still didn't know how beautiful your gift was.
"I know you couldn't tell me that you like me ... I would never have considered you"
"No," he replied. "Tomorrow we can fight, but second thoughts, no"
Harry raised an eyebrow. "There would be nothing wrong if you were ..."
What the hell was wrong with it?
"For six years," Draco added. He opened the fridge and examined its contents. "And omelette be it, then" he decreed, starting to take out the necessary items from the refrigerator.
The doctor must have sensed something because she hurried to open the door of the ward, beckoning him to follow her.
I left him there together with his peers and went home to write to you.
He saw Potter bend down to lay a kiss on the top of Hermione's curly head and Draco wished he were anywhere else. He stood up and asked who he should kill to get some coffee.
"I never liked Harry Potter"
Harry nodded, taking a few steps towards Draco. "I did something more," he said in a low, modulated voice. He saw suspicion curl across Draco's face and his hands shake slightly. "I killed him"
Harry felt anger boil, a volcano in full eruption filling his stomach with liquid fire. He would find Roger. He would find it and tear it to pieces.
"You're almost there?" sighed the former Slytherin on his lips.
," she whispered.
She widened her eyes a little. "But I thought that ..."
Feel free to bring me the gift you prefer, I trust your good taste.
(See the end of the chapter for
It had been three weeks since they had decided to try dating and Harry had realized how difficult it was to be able to reconcile their explosive characters in everyday life.
I am breathtaking. I'm wearing my bespoke black pants, a silk shirt that makes my eyes appear even more intense and gray than they are, and a coat that's worth more than the Weasleys' house. I'm beautiful. Sure of me. I am a god.
Hermione flattened herself against the pillows, her eyes full of panic, the wheels of her highly intelligent brain spinning at full speed.
Draco's eyes widened, glancing in Harry's direction as Molly wiped her cheeks with a handkerchief. "I'll put on some tea," he announced, starting to walk away, when Harry grabbed him by the arm. "You don't move from here," he hissed through gritted teeth.
"My usual luck," Harry muttered, summoning his patronus. He told him that he would be a little late and that he was sorry. Then he sent him to Malfoy.
“I stopped counting them to Ron and Hermione's second child. The others… I don't know, I confuse them. I buy too many gifts, generally for children of different ages ... so somehow I always manage to please everyone. " Harry replied, accepting the second glass of wine as well. It was good and fresh. "Where were you supposed to be?"
"Why did you send me flowers?"
His mouth found a point in the hollow between the shoulder and the neck and sucked the sensitive skin, leaving a mark. Harry tilted his head back, staggering towards the entrance. Their clothes scattered on the stairs.
Malfoy didn't look him in the eye, hiding behind his slightly long hair. "Let's get off the floor," Harry whispered, helping him to his feet. He led him into the guest room, then made him sit on the bed. For a moment he wondered if he wasn't becoming catatonic.
"In my duffel bag," Malfoy replied. Harry stroked his sunburned cheek and was spellbound for a moment. "Don't move," he whispered, getting up and rearranging his costume to go below deck. Harry opened the duffel bag and retrieved the lube and condom before going back upstairs.
Harry exhaled deeply reaching out for her to get the newspaper delivered.
She stared at him for a moment, unsure whether to answer.
She nodded, following him down the hall. He stopped in the doorway staring at Harry. His cheeks had regained some color and his breathing was silent again. In the worst stages, Draco had heard him emit a sinister hiss, as if one of his lungs was about to collapse ... he was afraid. A lot. Hermione sat in the same chair that Draco had been sitting in all night. Her long fingers touched Harry's arm in a light caress. Immediately the former Gryffindor opened his eyes. He blinked a couple of times, trying to focus on his friend's face.
"Um ... there was no time to ..."
“We are here, you know? Can you stop talking about us, as if we weren't? " Harry intervened who was promptly ignored.
The former Gryffindor froze as Narcissa Malfoy hugged him. "Welcome to the family," she said. Harry didn't have time to give her back the hug that she walked away. "You'll take the surname Malfoy, won't you?"
Ah, his name was Roger.
There was a girl with a stupidly nice face. "Would you like to make an offer, sir?" she asked me pointing to a red bucket. Inside there were pathetically few banknotes.
"Holy shit ... you fucked Harry Potter!" she screamed, knocking over the coffee cup. Draco took his wand and cleaned up the mess mumbling to repeat it a little louder because the editorial staff of the Daily Prophet hadn't heard it. Pansy sat back in a composed manner, her features twisted with surprise.
His voice broke for a moment. “I couldn't leave him there. I made sure he was dead and then I called you. I didn't touch anything "
He tied a rope as the boat lost speed. Malfoy dropped anchor and pulled his glasses over his hair. Her skin tone was less pale and sickly. His hair was lighter, softened by the sun and salt. "Now you can take off your life jacket," he told him, pulling off his. Harry complied, then tossing him aside. He lit the grill and placed the prawns on it.
He placed his hands on his back, making his palms adhere to the fabric of the shirt and stroking it more firmly. Draco's trembling seemed to subside as his touches tightened. Harry's hands slowly ran down his spine and then two fingers positioned themselves under the former Slytherin's jaw to make him lift his head.
"Mom, it is not used between two males"
Since I don't get help from you, I turned to Santa Pansy.
"I'm not gay," Harry repeated for the millionth time. “Well .. I would have noticed! I wouldn't have liked Cho; I wouldn't have dated Ginny! "
"Come here," he murmured, leaning more comfortably on the pillows. Draco erased the distance that separated them, bending over to his knees in front of him.
“Fuck, Malfoy… don't scream. My head is about to explode ... Jesus ... "
Draco
"Guys…" Hermione whispered, shaking her head and then helping him get Harry into the car.
Draco did as he was told, a veil of fear hovering over his face, but there was also something else ... something that sent a shiver down Harry's spine.
Harry leaned over to him, their noses brushing. Draco's sweet breath breaking on his upper lip.
Harry brushed his cheek and jaw with his fingers in a light caress. "No more blackmail"
"About what?"
"We must deny the news!"
"Those where ..." he articulated, advancing threateningly one step. Malfoy hastened to make them disappear and then moved to a safe distance.
"Undo my pants and suck it"
Draco's fingers traced a fiery trail from his neck to his chin, then back up to his lower lip. "Realizing that I liked a guy"
"No, they don't disgust me, and I have nothing against gays ..."
“To find Roger. You will give me his address and I will make him pass the desire ... "
I crossed my legs as Weasley took his last quart of beer and went limp on the bar. I stared at that spectacle of human degradation for a few seconds before unleashing my flirty tone.
"Just a few purchases," she replied, then pointing to some bags from Diagon Alley's most exclusive clothing store. "I got you a couple of cadeau"
Draco reached out and retrieved two bottles of beer, leaving behind some bills.
The second was a naked body, asleep and close to his. An unmistakably masculine body.
But Draco kept kissing and touching him and he didn't understand anything anymore.
Draco rubbed his lids with his fingers.
And Potter was still staring at me. He raised his hand in a wave of greeting and then I realized that your method really worked.
Draco would have given anything to avoid this argument, but he was in dire need of coffee. The pain had finally subsided, leaving Harry completely exhausted. He had fallen asleep, his fingers loosely intertwined with his. Draco had waited to hear his breathing deepen before he left the room.
"I've had so many pains in my life, Harry ... I lost a child ..."
Draco took a sip of hot coffee, examining her with his eyes.
The pedestrian gate of the villa was open. Some windows were lighted. Harry expected to see The White Peacocks spinning around the garden, but all was quiet and eerily calm. He pulled out his wand and walked to the main door.
Harry looked away, something stirred in his chest.
"Exactly. I don't want to go out with you. I want you to move here ... or I can move in with you ... and start from there "
Eight months later it was the night of the slaughter. A werewolf broke into a Muggle house where a girls' sleepover was taking place. He had slaughtered six of them, plus the hosts.
"You shouldn't have," Draco said, taking a seat in front of her.
They were sitting in a pub, facing each other. And Potter looked so comfortable, so incredibly charming as he plucked chips and fecal bacteria from the bowl.
Instinctively he tried to open it and the door slid smoothly onto its hinges, revealing a large hall. Scent of fresh flowers and floor detergent. Harry glanced at the keys lying on the coffee table next to a bag containing food. He touched the bag, cautious, his senses on alert. It was all cold. A cloak and a man's jacket hung on the coat rack in the entrance. He reached out and touched the elegant fabric of the coat. It was only slightly damp.
“They are beautiful, Harry. Thanks”, he added as if he was purring. He hinted at the attempt to take him by the hand but stopped by sensing that it would be too much.
Harry fucked him hard, changing the angle only slightly each time the Malfoy moans grew louder. He just tilted his head back, his mouth ajar on the hot breath, trying to send it back again ... to enjoy it as much as possible ... but he was lost when Malfoy buried his fingers in his hair and abruptly pulled him towards him, reaching orgasm with a strangled sob.
With love,
“Yeah… well… so merry Christmas, Malfoy,” he said. Two weeks to Christmas and I expect to discover his post-orgasm expression before that date. I have to succeed. I can't survive one more day without getting fucked by him.
"I see in your future ... a handsome and rich boy," he said in a fake cavernous voice.
"I didn't even take into account that you didn't come"
"What happened?" the former Slytherin asked, closing the double doors. Harry could almost feel his heart beating wildly. He ran a hand through his hair, which was slightly damp from the snow, as he approached the fireplace. He let the silence fall between them so that Draco had plenty of time to think about the worst things.
Glare from the barman. Perhaps no one calls him a barman, especially flicking his fingers to get his attention. They all look so manly in here.
"But it's true?" the girl stammered in a low voice, getting a little closer. It smelled of vanilla.
"Don't stain your jacket," the witch shouted after him as the children ran towards the living room.
Hermione raised the cup to her lips. Harry could almost hear the cumbersome gears of her brain creak.
Draco thought she looked much younger, her skin bright and fresh, her eyes sparkling. He hadn't seen her so full of life in years. She kissed him on the cheek twice before approaching Harry.
“Not even a little… and how much do you have, Potter? How afraid are you that your friends will find out that you married
Harry glared at Malfoy Manor's door and then finally decided to knock.
Assertiveness was a big bullshit.
Draco wanted to touch him like he couldn't on his birthday night… or like he didn't remember doing. He would have preferred to undress him and study every inch of his skin with his mouth, but Potter seemed to be in a feverish urge as he pulled off his shirt and closed his lips on his nipple.
Harry pushed inside him one last time, his heart thundering in his ears and temples, as he reached the peak of pleasure so violently that he gasped. He supported himself on one hand as he maneuverer the former Slytherin's legs to bring them down.
Harry took off his mask, then ran a hand through his hair to get rid of the excess water. He wrapped himself in a towel, shivering slightly and lay down on a bath towel. He closed his eyes letting the sun warm him. He felt strangely rested and exhausted at the same time, his skin smeared with salt and reddened by the sun.
Hermione would have said something highly intelligent and sensible.
The former Slytherin was about to get up, but the sight of his father's lifeless feet glimpsed through the open door sent him back onto the sofa. His face turned an alarming white and Harry wondered if he was about to pass out.
Harry bitterly regretted saying yes, watching the barely-trodden path climb the mountain in front of them. He buried his chin in the coat, wrapping his arms around his body. The icy wind whipped his face, his beard was already flecked with snow and his lips had become dry and numb. Although he had often gone camping, he had never been a lover of winter sports or high-altitude trekking.
"No, Potter We're not going anywhere ... you need a doctor"
"Don't think about it," he cut the conversation quickly before dematerializing.
Malfoy shook his head, his hands still sinking into his pockets. "Does it make a difference?" he answered quickly.
He straightened his back a little, stopping in front of the door of Malfoy's apartment. "You're late ..." he was saying when the former Slytherin realized his condition. Harry tried to cover the gash that crossed the shoulder of his uniform, as if it were the biggest problem.
"What did you tell them?"
“The house,” she said. “You can't live in your apartment, honey. It's too small. I've always told you it's too small "
Harry squeezed his hand for a few moments. “They won't do anything to him. I promise you." he assured him. He left to speak quickly with the Aurors who had accompanied him. He ordered them to take the body to the St. Mungo morgue and to guard the entrance. Whatever happened to Lucius he would hold them responsible. The medical examiners confirmed that on initial examination nothing suggested anything other than suicide.
"Molly"
I figured you might have met the mystery man in a gay club ... but you don't talk about personal things with your occasional sex.
"What the fuck?" he came out in a strangled lament, opening the page of the newspaper completely with an abrupt gesture.
"No, but I like to see your shocked expression"
Please, please, Santa Claus ... make me his little bitch.
"I hear you thinking from here again." Harry said, glancing at him.
He wasn't flustered, he'd already had sex… in the past… a long time ago… with Ginny. Which was very different from Malfoy. "I'll do it ..." Draco said, taking the tube from his hands and opening it.
"Sure," he replied, taking the feather she was holding out to him.
Draco smiled faintly. He took a note and wrote quickly
Draco looked away, feeling his heart begin to beat faster. "It's crazy"
"You ... idiot ... England thinks I'm gay!" Harry cried.
" said Hermione from the top of the stairs, making the guy harmless. Harry gave her a brief nod of thanks, getting back on his feet.
Draco shook his head slowly. If only he hadn't known her well, he might have thought that Pansy wasn't crazy enough not to know. He rubbed his face with one hand, feeling the weariness of the day weigh on him. He took a sip of whiskey, slumping back into the chair. The shirt a little untied.
"How lucky I feel to have the honor of inviting you," he muttered, still half numb from sleep.
"Malfoy," Potter muttered, my own urgency harboring in his voice.
Harry stroked his shoulder with his fingers, inhaling his scent. It was becoming familiar to him now.
"And did they believe it?"
She stirred her tea absorbed for a few minutes. "Are you sure you're not doing it just because he dumped you?"
Draco swayed, his face was deadly pale again and his eyes looked bewildered.
"What the fuck ..."
No note in response to what he had sent him.
it is useless to lie: I know that in recent years I have not been very good.
“I don't know what you might be pissed about! We keep arguing and I don't even know why "
He said "ah" to me.
For a second I thought he didn't even recognize me. In fact, what the hell is the son of a former Death Eater with an enviable pedigree doing in a pub frequented almost exclusively by Aurors? Try to gather information to fuck Harry Potter, that's what he does!
Then Hugo ran towards him and climbed up on his knee with a book to be read and the subject Malfoy was never touched again.
"I'm just ..."
"Mind your own business," Harry muttered, unable to wipe the smug expression off his face.
"Can I buy you a coffee?"
I can not believe! You did it!
She looked back at him as if she were seeing him for the first time. "Why did you get married?"
"It was a sudden thing ... we don't ..."
"I'll kill you" he growled, trying to catch him, but Draco was faster putting a table between them.
You really did! You brought me Harry Potter! I love you, Santa Claus!
Harry froze as he felt Draco's fingers slide slowly through his hair. He whimpered as he attempted to become an integral part of the blankets, Malfoy's fingertips dropped to his sensitive nape.
Potter looked at his outraged expression and burst out laughing. He quickly slipped in a couple of converse, hopping on one foot. "Out," Draco hissed, grabbing him by the arm and dragging him to the door. The fire of shame burned his cheeks.
Potter smiled that cheeky smile of his, pausing with his hands on his hips. He tugged him a little towards himself, making him lie down on the pillows he had placed behind him.
She went out with a guy named Stephen for a while and he's an Auror in the fraud section.
"On your knees," Harry murmured, settling himself better against the pillow.
Harry nodded, brushing his lips with hers. "Thank you ... I'll wait for you over there ..."
Harry just raised an eyebrow as the little creature scrambled to his feet and went back to work.
, he realized, his eyes lingering on her belly. She followed his gaze and subconsciously stroked her belly.
"Tell me what happened" he whispered.
Draco smiled. "Good night, Harry," he replied, before leaving.
It is not the only penis on earth, you know?
"Come here," Harry sobbed and Draco couldn't think anymore.
Harry squeezed his hand for a moment before leaning back against the pillows.
Draco took his hand and squeezed it in his. He would do anything not to see him suffer. Draco gently kissed the back of his hand. "A couple of hours. We can't move you now "
“It will be you who will want to stay married to me…. Mr. Malfoy, ”he whispered into his mouth. He slowly ran his tongue over his lower lip before removing his hand from his pants. He turned his back on him and went back to the living room to retrieve his coat. He wore it over his elegant shirt, checking his reflection in the mirror at the entrance to the apartment. As much as he tried to get his hair straight, he still looked like someone who had just been fucked.
"Molly, don't ..."
I fantasized that he would show up at the office with a bouquet of red roses.
“Look, the potion doesn't make you do anything you don't want to do… it just makes you less…”
"Hi" I replied, taking a few steps closer. I felt stupid.
"In France, with my mother and her second husband. He is a French Pureblood and is twelve years younger than her," said the former Slytherin, taking a sip of wine.
"Relax," he whispered. His hands slowly ran down Draco's thighs in a reassuring caress. Draco tensed even more.
Harry scrupulously followed Malfoy's footsteps, treading his footprints. The former Slytherin walked without hesitation, moving with elegance as if he was not making any effort and stopping only from time to time to allow him to catch his breath.
"And since Voldemort is dead, I'm the only one left," Harry muttered, folding his arms again.
“Out now, or we'll be late for the wedding. Hugo, never let go of Uncle Harry's hand. Rose, you are in charge. Ron, stop eating! " she screamed before marching out the door.
I really, really need him to fuck me. "Wow ..." he sighed.
Harry smiled faintly, slightly squeezing his fingers in hers.
Harry grimaced, hearing his cell phone ring. He pulled it out of the back pocket of his costume, watching the video Hermione had sent him. There were many red-haired heads, children running all over the place shouting Merry Christmas, Uncle Harry.
Habit of the Parkinson family indeed very questionable.
"Why are you doing it?"
The trembling voice, the teeth nervously sinking into the lower lip.
"Hi," he said and his lips curled into a smile that pulverized my stomach.
We have reached the end of the story. I hope you enjoyed it and that it excited you. I loved Hermione in this story, she issmart and funny. As for Harry and Draco, I loved  to explore how difficult it could be to make a relationship work in everyday life.
After a few minutes, Draco closed the door with a thud and slipped an arm under his. "Here we go?" He proposed.
Before thinking about it, he tied the note to his barn owl and watched him fly out into the early summer night.
Harry threw himself down on the bed dead weight, his eyes glued to the ceiling.
Harry decided it was time to finally face Roger.
A moan formed at the bottom of his throat as Draco stroked the tip of his erection with his lips. He was incredibly talented.
"What are these?" Malfoy said in an annoyed tone.
Draco shrugged. "No," he replied, finishing his wine.
See you next story :-)
"Exactly," Harry replied, stretching out on the sofa and devouring the last piece of cookie. Eventually he had made him believe that he murdered Roger Green and threw his body into the lake at Hogwarts. He continued to play the part of the psycho boyfriend, until Draco, trembling with fear, said he had to go get breakfast cereal and literally ran away from Malfoy Manor. Obviously after two great blowjobs.
repeated Harry's mind as he meekly slipped a finger between Draco's buttocks.
"I was saying ... I had a boyfriend, but things started to go wrong. I can't get rid of him anymore, he lurks outside my house, he sends me cards and flowers and ... he realized the fantastic person I am and he doesn't want to let me go for any reason in the world "
He had to speak to Mafoy. Immediately. They would have taken the situation in hand, they would have denied ...
