“Now, when I tried to teach you Occlumency at school last year, things did not go as planned. Would you agree?” Professor Snape questioned.
“Yes. Yes to the first, and yes to the second. I still don’t have a firm grasp on nonverbal casting, and I need to in order to take part in whatever training Severus has planned for me.” Harry said.
“I’m going inside, Mr. Potter. I imagine dinner will be soon.” Snape stated, grabbing his robes and walking away.
will forever be in your debt.” She finished.
“I do not think I would label it ‘sentient.’ It is more, I think, a collection of magic left behind by previous generations of your family. Somewhat of a connection to the people of the past, if you will. Family rings have been known to carry protective spells, runes to prevent harm, etc. There is nothing to be lost from putting it on, but perhaps you should think about it. There is no harm in waiting.” Dumbledore said.
“SHUT UP! YOU KNOW NOTHING! I ASKED YOU FOR HELP BEFORE GOING TO THE MINISTRY, BUT YOU
“I will admit, I am partially to blame for this. Let’s say forty percent responsible. I did not try as hard as I should have to help you close your mind to the Dark Lord, and it led to the death of your Godfather. For that, I am sorry…” Professor Snape paused to let his words sink in before he spoke again. “However, with that being said, you must never allow him inside your head again. And now that your house is under the protection of a Fidelius Charm, you have to be doubly careful.
The next thing Harry knew, Draco was on top of him, tickling him in places Harry didn’t even know were ticklish. Harry was gasping for breath in no time, but Draco didn’t let up. Draco continued his assault until Harry had tears streaming down his face.
“Why aren’t you in bed? I figured Severus had stolen you away, again.” Draco questioned.
“I don’t know, it just seems like you’ve been avoiding me.” Harry said.
The pair still needed to find his mother, and it had to be getting close to dinner, but Draco wanted to show Harry how much he loved him, and he knew a perfect activity for that.
“I’m afraid that we have located your uncle.” Severus said.
“I’ve told you before, mother, it’s fine if you leave. I’m not a child that needs to be constantly looked after… Besides, even if I was worried, your name hasn’t been in the paper, and I knew that if you
Both tried to say at once. They looked at each other and shared a chuckle.
“I will do anything to keep Draco and Narcissa safe. And I refuse to stand by and do nothing to help you. I love my wife, Severus, and my son, but you have a place in my heart that has never been filled, and I won’t lose that.” Lucius said passionately.
“Go to Hogsmeade, my son. Floo there and I will be right behind you.” Lucius said, giving him a small, reassuring smile as he offered him the floo-powder.
“Hey.” Draco said, running a finger up and down Harry’s stomach while the other boy leaned against the glass, apparently still recovering. “Are you okay?”
“Oh, uh, just a splash of milk and a lump of sugar. It’s no big deal.” Harry replied, feeling a bit uncomfortable.
*pop*
Draco spoke to him softly after a few moments of silence.
Draco held his breath, waiting for Harry to start pushing into him, then realized that all his muscles had tightened down, and he forced himself to breathe, doing his best to relax. He knew that Harry would stop if it was too much. He knew he had nothing to worry about.
“Thinking hard about something, Potter?” Draco asked with a sly smile.
“Yes, I should think that would suffice, as long as you can hold it in place. Concentrate for now, we’re going to continue.” Snape said, before casting again and again, trying over and over to find a weak point in Harry’s defense; he kept this up until Harry was panting from exertion, and parts of his thoughts were starting to leak through. Finally, Professor Snape seemed satisfied and relented.
“Let’s go for a walk. I’ll bring you up to speed.” Harry said, gesturing for Remus to lead the way, following as the man started walking around the edge of the lake.
Taking a calming breath, wincing slightly as the move made his ribs expand painfully, Harry started off with “Well, Professor, I’ve been at the manor for a few weeks. I came here from my relative’s house following a … row, with my uncle. I had heard about this place in a letter from my mum- she mentioned she thought I’d like it here, so I figured I had nothing to lose. I took the Knight Bus, and when I got here, I was met by Meemy and her siblings, who’ve taken the most amazing care of me. I have spent the past few weeks exploring the manor, learning what the rooms are and have to offer, where things are located on the grounds…” Harry was saying, before being cut-off by Snape.
“It’s no big deal. I understand, to be honest. Whenever I tried to grieve for Sirius and Ron, someone always popped up to make sure that I was ‘okay’.” Harry said. “I usually replied with something along the lines of ‘obviously I’m not bloody okay, now fuck off’. Seemed to do the trick.”
find her.
and so perfect.
“Potter! I need you conscious for this, at least for a moment. You need to drink this, and then you can sleep. Do you hear me? POTTER!” Snape lashed out at Harry.
He found no sign of anything else, but the feel of dark magic still hung in the air. Whoever had captured Vernon had made him suffer; tortured him for who knows how long before taking him back to the Dark Lord. Severus shook his head and returned to the hallway where he met Dumbledore coming down the stairs.
Harry stood as well, watching as his teacher walked to the door and opened it. He thought the man was going to leave, but he turned around and spoke once more.
“I- is Master… Is Master Harry okay?” Meemy asked, eyes swimming with tears.
He heard Draco gasp by the sink that he was leaning on and he looked over at him. Draco’s expression was one of shock and his hand seemed frozen in place, half way to covering his mouth. Harry walked over to him and held his face in between his hands.
They would have to move as soon as possible, but Severus needed to reach out to the Headmaster. He was almost sure that Dumbledore would offer the remaining Malfoy’s refuge, but if he was wrong... well, he would go down that path later.
“Of course!” Harry replied.
Harry took longer than a few seconds to answer this time, but he finally replied, “If that’s what you require, Professor, then I vow to be silent.”
Hello everyone! It's been (almost) 3 months since I uploaded, and for that, I'm terribly sorry. I was moving from Alaska to California, and I cannot even begin to describe how much of an adventure THAT was. Short chapter here, only about 2k words, but I should be able to keep these coming (I do start a new job on Wednesday, so we'll see) but I will not be abandoning this fic. Thanks for reading, and thanks even more for those of you who continue to leave comments and kudos. I love you all!!!
It was silent for a few moments as everyone waited to see what happened. Harry was the first to break that silence.
And so Harry explained. He explained from the time he left Hogwarts, to Privet Drive, to the attempted rape, to the Death Eaters in the little town, to Severus, and Draco, and Narcissa all coming to live with him, everything that had happened in two months. And Remus listened. A few times he seemed to almost want to interrupt and ask a question, multiple times especially when Harry was explaining things that happened at his aunt and uncles, but he ended up shaking his head and listening again. And when Harry was finished, he himself was surprised at how much had happened in such a short amount of time. And it was also oddly therapeutic, talking to Remus, someone he knew he could trust without a shadow of doubt, not that Draco, or Severus, or Narcissa weren’t to be trusted, but this was R
“How would you feel about doing this outside? Perhaps the western lawn would suffice?” Professor Snape queried.
“You have my undivided attention, kiddo.” Remus said.
“Sure thing, Nipsy. Thank you” Harry replied.
“Alright.” Harry said.
“Where did it go?” Harry asked.
Draco slowly dragged the pillow off his face and said, “There will be payback, darling. Sleep in fear!”
“But, Professor, I-“ Harry started to say, before he caught the slight shake of Snape’s head. He stopped speaking and let out a sigh before continuing again. “Fine. You have my word.”
Harry was unsure as to what his professor was thinking, as the man had said only a few words in the hours that they had spent together. Finally, though, his teacher spoke his thoughts.
Severus scowled.
” Alecto screamed.
“Would you like me to tell you about it?” Dumbledore asked softly.
Severus liked many things in life, though you wouldn’t know it by his attitude or looks. For example, Severus enjoyed it when someone understood a complex potion in his class and was able to recreate it with no help. He enjoyed it when he could spend all day in his potions room and brew until his back ached. He enjoyed being able to read the Prophet while he had a cup of tea before the sun was up. But he especially enjoyed tormenting Potter whenever the boy presented the opportunity.
They cautiously approached the house until they reached the front door. Dumbledore raised his wand and made a sweeping pass over it, checking for any kind of booby trap that might activate when someone tried to open it. He signaled to Severus that it was clear and opened the door with another small wave of his wand.
“The secret of any good Occluder is the way they choose to hide their true memories and feelings, while providing a fictional train of memories. I personally choose a memory that has some truth to its base, and then twist that memory to suit my needs. For instance, the memory of me torturing the Dark Lord. Everything was real up to the point of me casting a curse at him. From there, I substituted my own reality.
to put it on.” Dumbledore explained.
“Can you tell me about the grounds? Better yet, can you tell me about everything? It’s absolutely beautiful here!” Harry said excitedly.
“I’m truly glad to meet you two, as well. I am actually quite happy to be here.” Harry said, small smile breaking across his face. Harry was slightly perturbed, however. They all looked strikingly similar.
Severus was surprised, thinking he would have to talk the boy into letting him learn what happened. But he quickly hid his shock.
“Yeah. See you…” Draco replied.
“Yes. I find myself using it when I have need of a constant supply of fresh air in the potion's lab. It’s particularly useful when pranking unsuspecting teenage boys.” Severus replied, giving him a grin.
The group had now been talking for about fifteen minutes when Dumbledore clicked his tongue, and suddenly the people around the table started singing.
“Thank you. Let us proceed inside.” Dumbledore said.
Snape went over to Narcissa and Draco, stooping down to help pick the distraught boy up and bring him into the safety of the manor. They crossed the wards effortlessly, and Harry was aware that he could now feel their presence in his head. It wasn’t invasive, it was just…
Harry let go of his wand and was shocked when, rather than falling to the ground, it shot to his forearm and disappeared. Harry looked at Draco and noticed that he was wearing a similar expression of awe.
His wand snapped into his hand a second later, eyes scanning the water for any sign of Severus. He waited and waited until he was finally rewarded with a ripple, too big to be caused by a fish or bug, and cast his revenge.
“Oh… I’ve just been thinking about some things. I apologize if I’ve come off that way.” Draco said.
Harry stuffed his glasses on his face and sat up.
“Severus, the Dark Lord will surely know that we helped you escape. Will Dumbledore offer us protection?” Lucius asked.
In the meantime, Narcissa and Severus battled two versus one against the enraged Alecto.
The table all raised their glasses and drank before Dumbledore sat down. He swished his wand in Harry’s direction, and suddenly there was a small pile of presents where his plate had been moments before.
“You’re no longer that skittish, malnourished boy from the fifth year. You’ve grown into this incredible person that is kind, and passionate, and powerful, and we all love you so much. I love you so much. Just remember that, and remember to keep being productive with that anger. Harness it and make it work for you. Everything else will fall into place.”
“But, how? How was that so…
Draco didn’t say anything, almost like he was frozen. Harry looked up at him and saw that Draco had tears streaks down his face, but he wasn’t crying anymore. Harry saw his face go from angry to sad before Draco seemed to realize that Harry was looking at him. He pulled Harry into a tight hug.
The voice that spoke from next to him just seconds later did not cause him to almost drop his wand, and it most certainly DID NOT cause him to scream like a girl, thank you very much.
Harry tore the wrapping off and saw an expensive-looking box that he gingerly opened. Inside was a bottle with a dark amber liquid that he assumed was cologne. He was proven right when he took the cap off and sniffed lightly at it. His brow furrowed as he had smelled this before. This was...
“Would you do me a favor, Harry? I’m going to make a trip to see a relative of mine, one I have not seen for many years. Would you inform Draco in the morning where I went? If things go well, I should be gone for a few days… If things don’t go well, well… let’s just hope for the best.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
“I can’t wait to go pick one out. Hopefully we are able to go before school starts.” Harry said.
They started slowly, both feeling the nerves and excitement at crossing over into new territory. Harry positioned himself behind Draco and started kissing and sucking on his neck, one hand on his hip, the other snaking around to wrap around his straining erection. Draco didn’t even try to hold back the moan he uttered as Harry stroked him off. He lost track of time, enjoying the embrace and feeling of Harry touching him, but he was close to the edge and felt the need to warn Harry.
“Let me see one of your hands.” Harry said.
will be able to endure the curse on his mind for long, but I think it’ll be long enough for you to get a good head start on thinking about what you’ve done to Harry. You were supposed to take care of him but you treated him as nothing more than a
“Is that… Mr. Malfoy?” Remus asked. His eyes traveled down to their clasped hands, and it was almost comical to watch his brain go into overdrive.
“We’ll start as soon as you’re presentable. Take a shower, eat some breakfast, and as soon as you meet me on the west lawn, we will begin.” Snape said, standing to leave.
“No trouble at all, Harry. I was able to accompany everyone on their shopping to ensure there were no issues.” Dumbledore said,
him, there was actually no pain at all and Harry slid in much easier.
“Master Harry! What can Nipsy be doing for you?” Nipsy squeaked.
“I know you... dislike the taste, Potter, but the benefit that it’s having on you is obvious to anyone who has seen you in past weeks. You need only continue them for a short while more.” Severus said.
“I was worried about you. I heard you in my bathroom and then you left... I hope I didn’t cross any lines or make you feel uncomfortable.” Draco said.
Harry was shocked, to say the least. He figured he was in for rounds of questioning, but Remus apparently didn’t need to ask. He was willing to take Harry at face value, even if it was obvious from the state of things that Harry wasn’t exaggerating, it still meant something that he didn’t press him.
He finished drying himself off in his room and tossed the towel to a corner before sliding under the covers. He grabbed his wand from off the bedside table and with a small flick, the flames in the lamps died out. He lay on his side, staring out of the window at the night sky and waited for sleep to claim him. It had been such a tedious day, but Severus couldn’t help but feel this was meant to be.
“Harry if you wouldn’t mind telling us the location of your home so that we could proceed inside? I’d rather like to sit down.” Dumbledore said.
Harry gave himself a mental kick for watching Draco as he walked away. He was obviously attracted to the young blonde, but it wouldn’t do him any good to pursue those feelings, especially when he had so many responsibilities. Besides, he highly doubted the other teen felt the same attraction, and even if he did, Harry was sure that Draco wouldn’t let it be known.
“I... thank you, Severus. It means a lot to me.” Harry said.
“Perhaps we should retire for the evening? You are undoubtedly exhausted and we have much to discuss tomorrow.” Severus inquired.
***Smut warning (end of the chapter) for anyone who doesn't want to read it***
“Oh… um… my aunt and uncle used to have me do this for them. They always used to complain I never did it right, but I guess it’s not too bad?” Harry replied.
They quickly reached the end, and Severus was met with a door to his left and an archway to the right that led off down another short corridor.
Two other sheets of paper were in the envelope and he quickly set aside the acceptance letter and list of books, his breath catching slightly when he finally saw the O.W.L. results.
“My father’s history, I presume?”
Harry flashed a quick smile at everyone before he picked up the first gift. The wrapping paper had tiny golden snitches on it that evaded his fingers when he tried to touch them. Draco leaned over and whispered, “From me.”
“That would be stupid, honestly.” Draco had said one night. “Anyone can see how much we would be limiting ourselves. Eventually, inbreeding would destroy the wizarding community, and then what? Besides, there is too much emphasis put on blood purity. Like, being a pureblood makes you superior. It’s rubbish.
If Severus was truthful with himself, he would admit that he was more shaken earlier than he seemed. Thinking of how close Harry had come to death caused Severus to give an involuntary shiver, a feat considering how hot the water was. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that Harry needed help, that he needed someone to guide him. By the time the scent of his earthy, deep-woods smelling soap hit his nose, Severus had resolved himself to fully helping the boy with whatever he needed.
Draco looked at Harry for a moment and his expression softened.
“I told you I would be back, did I not? Do you think me a liar?” Severus asked, looking down his nose at the creature.
“I understand and thank you. Just a bit longer, anyway.” Harry mumbled out.
Harry went inside and up the stairs to the bedroom, followed by Draco. Both needed a bathroom to freshen up and agreed to meet in the kitchen.
Dumbledore sat quietly for a moment. He seemed to be making a decision, but Severus was impatient. His nerves were already on edge, and he could feel the layers of the wards being obliterated by the Death Eaters who were currently attacking his house. He didn’t have time or patience for the older man’s usual stoicism.
Harry had a wide smile on his face ad he said, “You really didn’t have to get me anything. I hope it wasn’t too much trouble.
Harry gasped as all the light from the house suddenly swarmed and engulfed him. He shut his eyes, trying to escape the blinding, bright light. All of his muscles were tensed - somewhere deep inside him, he could feel the spell taking root. It felt like it was being latched onto his very being, his arms, his legs, his mind, and then suddenly, it stopped.
“Now, though… I lost my best friend, Severus lost his lover, and Draco lost his father. The fact that you are doing your best to ease the pain, whether it be a distraction for Severus, a quiet place for me to mourn, or companionship for my son, I will forever be in your debt, Harry.
Dizzy soon joined them with the burgers that looked to be cooked perfectly. Harry could see the juice that was oozing from each patty and his stomach gave a loud rumble that got a laugh from Draco.
*Graphic retelling of an assault
He was going to make a BLT, something that was light, but would hold him over until dinner. He set about making it, using a simple household charm to clean and chop the lettuce and tomato while he cooked the bacon. He was about half way through the cooking process when he heard the door open behind him and heard someone shuffling their feet across the floor.
“Is everything okay?” Harry asked.
When they finally emerged from the bathroom some 20 minutes later, they both had pruned hands and feet, and Harry was certain he had never spent that long in the shower before. But he wouldn’t change a single thing.
Harry nodded and left the room, quickly making his way to his parent’s old room. He stripped his jeans and shirt after making sure that he didn’t have another visitor waiting for him and threw them to the corner of the room; they vanished as soon as they hit the floor. Harry gave a brief smile – Merlin he loved magic. He walked towards the dressing room and looked around for a moment before finding a pair of jet black pyjamas. He pulled them on, noticing that they were a bit too big for him; definitely his father’s, then.
“I never want to see these clothes again, please. Vanish them, burn them, I don’t care.” Harry said turning his back to the elf as he did so. He couldn’t bring himself to look her in the face, knowing he was weak for not doing it himself, but Meemy didn’t ask questions.
“As much as I would enjoy snogging you senseless, I don’t think it would be wise to keep Severus waiting for too long.” Harry breathed out.
“No, I’m just really, really surprised. I didn’t think I was going to do so well.” Draco replied.
This time, the quick, small intake of breath was enough to reveal him.
“O…kay.” Harry said, confused.
“Good.” Draco said, and his tone softened. “For the rest… Merlin, Harry. It is not stupid or childish to want to speak to parents you never had the chance to meet. I still dream of getting to speak to my father, and I actually got the chance to know him. Being angry about all of this is a good thing, believe it or not, so long as you channel it productively, and if I’m being honest with you, babe… There isn’t a person who can say that you haven’t been doing just that. You’ve made leaps and bounds this summer.
He let out a shaky laugh and breathlessly said, “This is amazing!”
Harry couldn’t tell if it was stone, or metal, or what, but the box was surprisingly heavy and for some reason, Harry yearned to put the ring on. It was almost like he was in a trance, and he jumped slightly when Dumbledore spoke. He found it hard to drag his eyes away from the ring to look at the man.
“Professor, could I not just be my own Secret Keeper?” Harry asked.
“Now, you said when I arrived here with the Malfoy’s that the Death Eater’s had already found you here. What happened?” Dumbledore questioned.
“Ron was a good kid, and Hermione still is. They both saw their friend in anguish, despairing that his godfather was being tortured under the hand of
Alecto stopped laughing immediately and dropped to her knees. She reached for her throat, desperately trying to stop the blood from flowing. She let out an involuntary cough that sprayed blood all down her front and continued to struggle. It didn’t take long until she had fallen over and stopped moving.
He took his time walking around the lake, eventually shedding his trainers and socks so he could dip his feet in the water. He ended up sitting down on the bank, occasionally throwing a stone into the water and watching the fish that jumped every now and then. When he felt that he was relaxed enough, he closed his eyes and started breathing deep and slow. He slowed his thoughts down and when he had total control over them, he tried to visualize the cracks in the shield around his mind.
“First things first, Harry. You have got to stop bottling your emotions up. I know Severus taught you how to occlude, and it is such a helpful tool, but it doesn’t replace the inherent need that we, as humans, need to express ourselves or talk about our feelings, or just rage at something! Even if it’s not me, and I do not mind one bit if it IS me, you’ve got to talk to someone. Promise me!” Draco said firmly.
The next thing he knew, Draco had stepped into the shower with him. His night clothes were instantly soaked, probably ruining what was an expensive silk outfit. Draco sat next to him with his back to the wall and pulled him into his arms. Harry leaned his head on Draco’s chest and wrapped an arm around his torso.
Draco, however, truly broke down this time. He slumped to his knees, sobs wracking his lithe frame. In a flash Narcissa was down beside him, cradling him as best she could from her position.
“Headmaster?” Severus queried.
“Draco, we cannot stay. We can bring Lucius with us, but we must go
Harry hesitated before speaking.
“Yes, Professor. It’s the first thing that came to my mind. Will that work?” Harry replied.
Harry did.
“Through the door, please, sir. If you is needing anything else, please call for Meemy.” Meemy requested, pushing him through the door as she spoke.
Harry nodded, and the professor continued.
Draco yanked hard and pulled him off balance, causing Harry to land on top of him.
“Surely-.” Severus tried to say.
.” Snape said coldly, glancing over his shoulder at Harry as he did so.
They drifted lazily along until Meemy appeared on the bank, shouting for Master Harry.
“Sorry. I just called you a house elf. That was rude.” Draco said.
Harry could feel him staring at him, watching his reaction. He couldn’t help the smile that broke out and met Draco’s eyes.
Harry thought to himself.
“Then we shall begin.” Severus said.
Beautiful green eyes locked on his, and he wasted no time.
Severus smiled, something Harry had only ever seen a handful of times before he became somber again.
After the brief feeling of being squeezed through a tube, he was indeed greeted by Dumbledore and two visitors. Narcissa and Draco stood regally behind Dumbledore, though Harry noticed the fresh tears in Draco’s eyes and slight cracks in his composure.
A few minutes later, with his hair still dripping slightly, Harry was at Draco’s room. He pressed an ear against the door but didn’t hear anything, so he figured that the other boy had already finished with his shower. He knocked lightly and heard footsteps coming to the door. It was opened to reveal a freshly showered Draco, dressed in the same bottle green pyjamas that Harry had seen the other night.
Harry complied, focusing again on the wards. He could swear they were practically humming with energy, waiting for a command from their master.
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus stopped shortly after getting through door, actually leaning back against it once it had resolidified. He was breathing heavily and almost cursed Lucius when he spoke from the desk at which he was working.
“Narcissa, uh.... this is incredible. You really shouldn’t have. I- I don’t know what to say. Thank you, truly.” Harry said.
“Draco, my darling, come with me. Severus will bring your father with him, but he’s right, we have to leave.” Narcissa said.
“I’m sorry, I should have-“Harry started to say before Draco cut him off.
Harry was dreaming of flying at school. It was something he dreamed about a lot, seeing as Quidditch was one of his favorite things in the world. He was seeker for the Slytherin team and he was damn good. It was something he inherited from his father, who was legendary in his time at Hogwarts.
Harry took a few breaths, and slowly got up from his knees, doing his best not to jostle himself too much as the pain in his side was almost blinding now. He pulled off the remains of his shirt and started trying to stifle the bleeding.
“I- I need- Professor Snape. Can you- find him?” Harry struggled to get the words out. He was in serious trouble and he knew it. But rather than have Meemy call for someone else, he had made the decision to call for Snape. He didn’t know why, but something told him this was the right decision. Maybe his mother’s last wish had affected him more than he thought.
The second group of papers was on official Gringotts letterhead. It listed just how much money his parents had left him, and Harry had to read it twice to make sure he hadn’t added a zero or two. It also listed all other items in the vault that he would inherit when he turned 17, and it seemed to go on forever. It appeared that this was everything that previous Potter’s had owned, and that, Gods willing, he would someday own. Harry blanched at the thought of Uncle Vernon finding out just how much money Harry truly had, and vowed that he would never find out.
The door opened behind Harry and he turned to watch as his elves brought out a cake that was formed to make a 1 and 6. The icing was what drew his attention, though. It looked like it was shimmering with a thousand different gems, the same colors represented in his ring. It was breathtaking.
“No crossed boundaries.” Harry said before kissing him.
Severus cast a lightening charm on Lucius as soon as they had flashed away and carefully picked him up. A tear fell as he walked over to the Floo, but he angrily brushed it away with a swipe of his shoulder. Someday he would have time to mourn, but today was not that day. He stepped into the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo powder, ready to leave this place behind.
“That would be this one.” Meemy said, opening the door that Harry had first seen. “Will Master be needing anything else?”
” He thought.
Harry blushed lightly, unused to the compliments, especially from Severus and Dumbledore.
“And?” Harry managed to squeak out.
“We need to move. The Dark Lord is here and he has begun attacking my wards. They will keep him out for a short while, but nothing more. Finish your tea and meet me in the study. I will be right down.” Severus said, ignoring the worried looks that the Malfoy’s had, and headed out of the kitchen and up the stairs towards his potions room.
He walked quickly to his study, intent on moving the Malfoy’s as soon as he got a message to the headmaster. He froze when he walked through the door, however. His eyes were locked on Narcissa and Draco. Narcissa was sitting up so straight, Severus had to wonder how she did it; her face betrayed no sign that she was anything other than cool and passive. Draco was doing his best, and failing slightly, to imitate his mother.
“Merlin, Potter, it’s hot. Haven’t you heard of cooling charms?” Draco said.
He watched as Narcissa scanned the letters with an impassive face. She couldn’t hold the smile back, however, when she got to their O.W.L.’s.
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted when the shower door opened. He turned his red, swollen eyes to the door and saw Draco. His breath hitched when he realized that Draco was seeing him totally starkers for the first time, but Draco wasn’t eyeing his body. In fact, his face showed nothing but concern.
He followed Draco through the house up the stairs before the two stopped in front of Harry’s door.
Draco stopped when he reached Harry and fidgeted for a second before taking a seat next to him.
With a gasp, Harry went to his knees again.
“I will have to remember in the future.” She said. She seemed to be waiting for him to join her, and as soon as he sat down, she lifted her cup, taking a small sip.
“Yes, Master Harry?” Meemy replied.
“Who is your master? Tell me!” Snape ground out.
Harry was suddenly looking down at a much younger Snape, and he realized with a shocking jolt, his mother. They were at Hogwarts, maybe first or second year, down by the banks of the lake. His mother was laughing at something Snape had just said.
“That would be a bit hypocritical of me.” Harry said.
Harry thought idly.
Draco. He took a deep breath and exhaled before he finished the rest of his fruit, thinking about his feelings. Was it
“Actually, there is. You are probably one of the few people who can say they know what it feels like to lose someone they care about. In fact, I imagine you can say that a few times over.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
“Professor?” Harry whispered quietly.
They had her, and she knew it. Alecto was a good duelist, but she was no match for both of them together. She looked desperately around for anything that could help her win, and saw Lucius with his back turned, helping Draco into the fireplace. She smiled viciously and turned her wand on him.
“For the life of me, I can’t remember what.” Harry said.
“Wear something comfortable.” Severus said over his shoulder, talking barely above a whisper.
idea how close you came to dying? Has that brain of yours ever served a purpose other than to get you in trouble? You will explain to me
They spent the morning together, choosing to go over to the newly refurbished stables once they had made it out of the bedroom and out of the kitchen. Harry had only seen them once: when they were covered in cobwebs, and had missing and rotting boards, and had thick dust that coated the surfaces and air.
“Well, at least I’ll have some privacy here.” Harry thought, trying to keep his reservations about what he was doing in the back of his mind.
“What my son does and who he does it with is his own business. I would not deign to interfere with whatever was, or wasn’t, going on there. However, I do wish to caution you. He is struggling with the loss of his father, and I would truly hate to see you get hurt by the fallout of that.” She said.
Dumbledore stopped and looked back at Harry.
It was agonizing minutes later that Draco remembered Harry was waiting for him to tell him to speed up, and he wanted to slap himself. His dick was leaking pre-cum and he was shaking slightly from the feelings Harry was producing in him.
“Words do not describe how I feel about this, Harry. You must know that I would
” He tried the feather-light charm; only one way to know if that one worked.
“I don’t know for sure, but I think they wanted to make sure it stayed in the family. I can’t think of any other reason they would have kept it secret. But then again, my mother did invite Severus here before. So I’m not sure, exactly.” Harry replied with a shrug.
“Yes, Master Harry. We are siblings. Meemy is being the oldest, followed by Dizzy and Nipsy. We took care of your parents. You remind Meemy so much of Misses Lily.” Meemy said a little sadly.
Draco just smiled and shook his head. He leaned his arm on the wall and rested his head on it, much more relaxed than he had been previously. He felt Harry tentatively rub his now greased up fingers in between his cheeks, briefly pausing to tenderly rub at his opening. Draco’s erection had waned a little after feeling the cool oil hit his back, but it had returned in force and was now achingly hard.
Remus tightened his hug.
Harry looked at him and noticed he did look a little wobbly on his feet.
He still harbored contempt and resentment for his aunt and cousin, but it was nothing like what he had for Vernon. Perhaps one day he could sit down and have a civil conversation with them – without Vernon present. Harry was sure that he’d never be able to be in the same room with the man, let alone have a conversation with him. Even with Occlumency, he’d never be able to control himself.
Harry looked quickly at Draco, surprised that he hadn’t given a second thought to who was about to see them in bed together. Maybe he didn’t care? Harry didn’t have a chance to agonize over it, though, because the door opened and Narcissa walked in. If she had a problem with the sight she was being faced with, she hid it well.
When he arrived, he quickly made his way through the room, packing only the rarest ingredients and easy to transport things into a chest. He had finished in minutes and he shrank the packed trunk and put it into a pocket of his robes; with a last sweeping look of the room, Severus spun around and went back down the stairs.
Harry was drying himself off when Meemy approached him.
pushed up against the door.
Meemy said nothing, but instead answered by grabbing Harry’s shoulder and apparating him into the study, where she helped him settle into the chair. With a snap of her fingers, there was a roaring fire in the fireplace.
*pop*
here, and then another 15 arguing about why I couldn’t go in there and see you.”
extreme, just enough to break a sweat and get your heart rate up. This will help increase your stamina and I think this should be the next area we really focus on. I’m satisfied that your reflexes have improved to an acceptable level, but we shouldn’t stop working to improve even further. It would not do to face the Dark Lord underprepared.
!” Severus snapped and reached forward to pull Draco’s head up. He was successful and waited until the boy had focused on him before he spoke again.
The rest of the morning was spent on idle chatter. Dumbledore had switched from planning the visit to Diagon back to being festive in the blink of an eye, and he soon had the table laughing as he told tales of his most memorable birthdays.
“Of course, Professor.” Harry said.
that you have shown you can be. I don’t have any questions. I trust what you are telling me, and anything left out I am sure I will learn about in the future. My wand is yours to command.” Remus stated.
. Harry’s eyes raked up and down his chest. He had almost-pointy shoulders that led to pale white biceps and noticeably muscled forearms. His chest was well defined with pecks that had just started to form; his nipples almost translucent. He had a six-pack that was barely detailed, but still there; his belly button an outie that seemed to complete the whole package.
Harry quickly bounded off the bed, heading for the loo. He stopped short when he walked into his father’s closet, noticing that it smelled faintly of dark, musky patchouli. He inhaled the slightly intoxicating scent for a moment before pressing through the wardrobe, locating the bathroom directly through the next door. He looked around, stunned at the massive bathroom. He observed the huge, detached bathtub, and a stone-tiled shower that could easily fit 6 people. The bathroom was set in a sharp white color, with ebony cabinets, and beautiful, grey ceramic tiles on the floor. Harry stood looking for a moment, stunned by how well designed it was.
, but this was not the time discuss it.
“So uh… that happened.” Harry said.
“Maybe later. I don’t honestly know if I can say anything about it. It’s not really my issue to share. But thank you for being there for me last night...” Harry said.
“Sure, babe. I’d love to.” Draco replied with a chuckle.
Harry chuckled and cracked an eye open at Draco.
He quickly diverted his attention to the fireplace and re-set the Floo connection so that only a select few people could come through. He guessed that the Dark Lord had heard where he was going, and he didn’t want to leave him an easy way in.
The nights with Draco were amazing. After dinner, they would usually go for a walk or swim in the lake and would end up collapsing in the grass for a hearty snogging session. That usually led to a dual hand job that would end in an explosive orgasm. When the two would head to bed, they could spend hours talking. Harry was constantly surprised at how well he got along with Draco.
“Why the sigh, Draco?” Harry asked.
am not the one abusing my nephew.” Severus spat out at her.
“My uncle tried to rape me. He spouted some crap about me failing to respect him, and now that Sirius was dead, he was going to show me what would happen if I continued to disrespect him. He had my pants off before I managed to incapacitate him and decided to leave. You see, my aunt had given me a letter from my mother earlier that day that listed this as one of the properties that I owned, so I came here. I didn’t expect to find the house or the house-elves still here. I made it my new home.” Harry finished.
“Severus? To what do I owe this great pleasure?” Lucius inquired.
Draco reached up and adjusted the temperature to a
“Do you understand so far?” At Harry’s nod, he continued. “Good. Now, the incantation itself is fairly easy, though the power needed to cast such a spell is great. You must understand that this is extremely potent magic, Harry, and you might feel uneasy or even sick while I am casting the spell. This is normal, and it should settle quickly.”
“I doubt you’ll know this, but Lucius was attracted to men. In fact, he was devastated when our parents arranged for him to marry me, and it wasn’t until after we married that I told him I knew where his attraction truly lay. He, of course, was worried that I would cause an issue over it, but nothing could have been further from the truth.  I told him to seek whomever he wanted, so long as he produced an heir first.
“Uncle Vernon, please. I’m sorry for disrespecting y-“ Harry started, only to be stopped when his uncle wrapped his meaty hand around his throat.
He just nodded as he turned around and sought out Draco. The blonde was standing near the door, trying very hard to look like he wasn’t attempting to eavesdrop and failing miserably. Harry smiled softly and shook his head as he walked over to him.
This chapter has potential triggers. You have been warned.
“Just try to stay relaxed. Easier said than done, I’m sure, but I promise to be agonizingly slow until you say otherwise.” Harry said, lining up behind Draco.
“Severus... So
Harry sighed again, suddenly very emotional. His eyes started welling with tears, but he brushed them angrily away.
By this point, Harry was achingly hard, and if the thing stabbing into the front of his thigh was any indication, so was Draco. Harry dragged his hips forward, making sure to cause as much friction as he could, and again, Draco moaned, this time a little more throatily. Soft hands came up along Harry’s sides and back before they firmly held on.
Draco grinned and ran his hands up and down Harry’s thighs. He took one last look at Harry as he positioned himself in between his legs before he dropped his head and gave a teasing swipe at Harry’s cock.
“Merlin yes, please don’t stop.” Draco replied.
“As you wish, master.” Pipsy said before disapparating.
“Umm... Narcissa told me about you and Mr. Malfoy... I just want to say thanks for taking the time to train me, even though I’m sure you’re in pain right now... It can’t be easy when the loss is so... new” Harry said lamely.
“Pray tell, Potter, why you didn’t call for your house-elves the moment the fighting was over? Tell me why you chose to walk, Merlin knows how long, back here. More so, why you didn’t call for them the moment you realized you were in trouble? I assure you they would have come, and they would have gotten you out. This is the same recklessness you displayed at the end of the school year, rushing off to save your godfather. What did that accomplish, Potter? Nothing! It got him
Harry could sense Snape in his mind and redoubled his efforts to maintain the steel around his mind. He could feel the Professor poking around, trying to find a spot that he could attack, but after trying for a few moments, he gave up and broke contact.
Still, Draco was getting lower and lower, going ever so slowly, until he made it to the thick bush of pubes around Harry’s hardened cock. He stopped for a moment and looked up at Harry who had been watching him almost the entire time.
. And I was absolutely enraged… but none of it at you. I will admit, I should have waited to make sure you were alright before leaving, but I will not stand by while that piece of
The memory switched and Harry was now in a room with Voldemort and Snape. They were having a somewhat heated discussion, and then all of a sudden, Harry watched as Snape cast a
“I don’t want to sound like I’m accusing you, but… I thought you said there were only two floors? Why can’t I open this door?” Harry inquired, curiosity burning in his voice.
“Merlin, I didn’t forget did I? I could have sworn it was tomorrow.” Draco said hurriedly.
“Hi.” Draco said.
Severus knew that his spell would only stun the dark lord, but he didn’t care. He needed to get out of there. The Death Eaters along the walls were shocked still, obviously not expecting
“Naturally, Harry, I will do my best. I have a great many questions for you, but I think most of them can wait. Did you learn any more information in your latest…
“Are you ready to go?” Severus questioned.
Harry didn’t know what to say, especially because he didn’t know why she had offered all that information. He watched, though, as she brought her wand to her head and suddenly everything in Harry screamed at him to stop her.
“That. Is. Wicked!” Harry exclaimed.
“Merlin, Draco, that was… amazing, to say the least.” Harry said.
"Well, not a
“Something inside me snapped upon seeing those memories, Harry.  A rage that I have not felt for a long time flared up and I reacted as I saw fit. I doubt you will find anyone who would be saddened to hear of what I did to Vernon Dursley and his wife. I will not apologize for my actions today, and I won’t have you shedding a single tear for them. They do not deserve your pity.
Severus stumbled out of his own fireplace, nearly falling in the process. He recovered at the last minute, maintaining his grip on Lucius all the while. He took a deep, steadying breath as he brought Lucius to the couch in front of the fireplace. He carefully set him down, removing the featherweight charm as he did so. It almost looked as if he had fallen asleep there, and once again, Severus had to fight tears of sorrow.
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time he was finished reading, Harry had tears streaming down his face. He quickly read through the letter, once, twice, three times. He couldn’t believe it. His mother’s hand writing was… beautiful. And, though he was pretty sure he was imagining it, he could swear it smelled of a sweet perfume. Harry read the letter once again, this time not really taking in the words, just looking at his mother’s writing. He had to have been dreaming; a quick and angry pinch on his leg, which was sure to bruise, proved otherwise. Harry laid his head back against the wall, closed his eyes, and took a deep, shuddering breath.
His question was answered when Snape appeared a few feet behind the group of visitors, face and arm bloody, eyes swimming with emotion.
“Meemy?” Harry called out.
Severus’ heart stopped for a fraction of a second before asking, “Is he okay?”
“Remus, perhaps?” Dumbledore replied.
Harry threw his hand out and caught the letter with ease. He shot Draco a grin before he tore into his letter.
“But you look so… so…” The man struggled.
“Come, have a seat, my boys.” Dumbledore said.
“I thought so.” He said, moving forward and crushing his lips against Harry’s. They “fought” for dominance, and Draco decided then that he didn’t care which of them was dominate, actually. He stopped fighting Harry and let him flip them around, so it was now
; Harry held his breath as the death eater got closer.
“-sense the dark magic? Yes. Best to take it slow, Severus.” Dumbledore said.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug and kissed his cheek before he whispered a, “thank you” into his ear. When he pulled away, he hoped no one could tell that his eyes were a little watery.
Harry did as he was told, and opened his eyes. Seemingly nothing had changed, so he asked, “Did anything happen?”
Harry took a deep breath and shot his hand forward as his brain supplied the disarming charm. It took a bit of restraint to stop his mouth from shouting the words, but he managed to keep his mouth shut as the spell echoed in his mind. “
Draco meant so much to him that it was hard to believe they had only been together for such a short time. A sudden realization seemed to smack him and made him stop chewing. He
.” Severus said, simply.
And with that, they spent the next three hours planning. They would start at Gringotts, allowing ample time for Harry to check his vaults (Remus gave him a strange look when he said he wanted to go) before heading to the various shops needed to gather their school things, a quick stop at Quality Quidditch Supplies so Draco could look at purchasing another broom, and then finally Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. Both boys had grown over the summer, Harry especially so, so they would definitely need new school robes and casual wear. It was a solid plan, and with any luck, they would be in and out before lunch, and well before anyone noticed they were there.
believe that Dumbledore would leave him here if he was in even the slightest bit of danger?” Severus nearly shouted.
think it was a good idea to put that bloody ring on? I can feel the dark magic radiating off of it and it’s five feet away.” Severus said, stout anger noticeable in his voice.
“I promise. I’ll stop if it hurts, or for any reason, okay?” He said gently.
“Yes, sir?” Meemy asked curiously.
“Severus, this is too much. I can’t accept something like this. It’s- it’s-” Harry started to say.
“I thought about it, Professor. But, I thought you would make me stay there anyways, due to the protection offered by my mother’s blood.” Harry said quietly.
They had gone down to the lake after lunch to do some swimming. Dumbledore and Narcissa were reclining on the beach while Draco and Harry were in the water, swimming close together and occasionally sharing a kiss when the group received a big surprise from Severus.
“Lunch is being ready soon, Master Harry, Mr. Draco.” She informed them. “Please be washing up before then.”
Harry mulled this over for a few seconds. On one hand, he really didn’t want to stick his nose where it didn’t belong. He hadn’t dealt much with Draco over the years, and when he found out his father was a Death Eater, he had wanted even less to do with him. But on the other hand, he didn’t like the fact that someone in his house was suffering so terribly, and he potentially
“Really, Petunia. There is no reason to harbor such hatred for
“Look at me, Potter.” Severus almost whispered.
Draco let him lead them backwards until they were under the torrent of water, and then wrapped his arms around his waist and rested his forehead against Harry’s, sighing.
“What do you mean?” He asked.
“I would be lying if I said I wasn’t upset, Mr. Potter, but I am not concerned about myself. In truth, I am far more worried about Draco. He is taking this extremely hard. His father was everything he aspired to be, and to see him murdered in front of him was… upsetting, to say the least.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
“No training this morning?” Draco asked with his scratchy morning voice,
Again, Harry got a scowl, “Does it matter?” His tone was cold.
Hagrid stared at the blond. It was hard to not have compassion on him. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days, and he was skinnier than should be healthy. He was small. And his awful posture didn’t help with that fact. He shuffled closer to the fire and added another log to it. Harry would probably be waking up cold anyways.
Harry’s eyes widened. Was the man dumb?
And then he would remember and reach for the flask in his pocket and take a drink. He tried to not flinch in front of harry but Merlin it was painful. Harry frowned every time he drank it, almost as if he knew what it was. But Draco chose to believe that he didn’t know what it was.
Hagrid looked Draco in the eye.
“Since when do you call me Draco?”
“Do it, you already got this far.”
“In all of my life, I have only truly regretted one thing. And that one thing, was not taking your hand that day. I messed up. I caused you pain. I turned you away.” Harry’s voice dropped “All I can do is hope, that maybe one day, maybe, you will be able to forgive me.” Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes. The calm grey stared back at him with so much hope. “And you know what, this tea is the best I’ve ever had.”
Draco set the flask down.
They sat there until Harry’s arm cramped and he decidedly couldn’t hold himself up anymore, so he didn’t, choosing instead to collapse his weight onto Draco. He rested his face on the chest of the blonde and made himself comfortable between his legs. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s torso, hands meeting in the gap between his back and the couch. Draco let out a soft laugh and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair.
Draco ran a hand through his messed-up hair. He looked at the potion in his hand before taking a dose. He sealed the flask before slipping it into the pouch at his waist. The potion was starting to burn his throat. He threw his head back and forced it down. No, he’d rather endure the burn than the dreams.
Draco:
Draco forced himself to keep his hands to himself, but oh how he wanted to brush the hair out of his face. He looked so soft and almost like… no, no he was not safe. The concern Draco felt was only because he saw the stupid idiot collapse. Not for any other reason.
Draco flashed across the room and knelt down at the bed, “HARRY”
“Harry. I, don’t really know what to say.” He shuffled on the couch,
-------------------
He shifted his arm on the mantel and leaned his head against his hand. He had spent the last few nights in the same position. Standing there for hours. The portrait above the fireplace was a portly man in a suit of armor. Draco could tell portly man didn’t approve of his nightly habits, but what could he do, he wasn’t causing any problems. There was no rule that students had to sleep. He wasn’t leaving the common room, and he certainly wasn’t causing any problems.
“Are you ok?”
Harry huffed, but didn’t respond and Draco let out another laugh.
Hagrid:
Those eyes popped open again and Harry surged forward with a smile.
He shook harder.
He shuffled a bit, “Usually he’s already here. Knows when its going to hit, but not this time, must have come on too quickly for him.”
Draco flushed a bit, of course he knew that. Nevertheless, he stayed silent.
“What about them?”
“Bloody Merlin Harry, what have you done.” His voice was hoarse from the earlier shouting. He couldn’t control himself. Shaking and trying desperately not to freak out, Draco ran through the events of the evening again, he couldn’t understand it. What had caused this. Either way, he needed to get Harry to warmth. He looked around; they were close to the forest. It would be a long trip back to the castle trying to carry an unconscious Harry that probably weighed 50 pounds more than he did. The panic rose in his throat and he let out a sob.
He decided to be honest, might as well, he already blew it. Draco leaned back on the sofa and brought up his legs.
His eyes closed again but this time, only to stave off the tears that were slowly gathering on his waterline.
“Really?”
“Draco…” Harry’s voice was soft, gentle, as if he expected the other man to break.
“You haven’t slept in a week and a half?”
Finally, he felt the cool outside air hit his face. He gasped. Desperate for the air. He needed to breathe. He had too. He was choking.
“No!! No no, outside, its… pt. Its. Please, fuck.” Hagrid eyed him, as he smacked himself in the face and looked up.
His legs were long past numb, but he really didn’t want to move from his place by the fire. It was warm. Really the only warmth he felt these days. His eyelids were heavy and dry. Blinking brought a burn to them and he blamed it on staring into the heat of the fire for hours. Yet he knew, in reality, what he was doing to himself. He knew, but did he really care?
Harry turned and scooted closer to him on the couch. Draco turned to look at him, the man looked positively giddy. Oh, what had he just done? He had seen the hurt in Harry’s face and panicked, wanting to do anything to soothe it. So, he said he wanted to be friends. But no, he didn’t want to be friends, the way he felt, that was not friendly.
What the fuck Harry.
“Are you ok?”
“Yes Draco, I wouldn’t lie to you.”
“Beautiful, so very beautiful.”
And ohhh boy. Draco found him very attractive. Harry’s skin was tanned and he had small dark freckles on his arms. How he wanted to trace patterns in them. If he stared too long, he’d fall off the edge of this cliff he was standing on.
“We had a weird conversation, and he seemed off, and I snapped at him, next think I know, he’s stumbling the down the stairs like a drunk.”
“Ah well, I guess I was thinking harder than I thought.”
“Harry isn’t the same kid he used to be. Things changed. Dying will change you.” There was a soft silence in the room, broken only by fangs harsh breathing.
It was almost like every failure, every pain he had caused, everything in his life he struggled with had lodged in is windpipe. He was drowning in his own mistakes. Golden boy or not, they were many. Regrets from the years of his life he could barely remember and the pain of being the savior of the wizarding world. It was all over, why couldn’t he let go?
“I can’t live without it.”
“Draco… are you sure you’re ok?” Concern flooded his senses and he took a step closer.
Maybe even more so.
Harry knew he was staring at him in complete wonder but his love was sitting here telling him, telling him that he was loved. He was accepted, the person he was, was ok.
Thank you for sticking it through with me! I love you all. Draco is a soft boy and he deserves some sleep. No beta, all mistakes are my own! Enjoy!
It was at that moment that Draco realized that Harry was indeed still behind him. He should have asked for some tea for him as well. He shifted and turned so he could look for the man only to be caught in those eyes. The firelight shone in them and they were staring right at him. Or through him. His breath caught in his throat. He had caught Harry staring at him. But, how could he be mad when those eyes. Those EYES. They were the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Staring at him as if he were the sun and Harry had lived in eternal winter.
Draco wanted to believe it. Wanted to ignore the effect of Harry's words, his voice. But he couldn’t. The hand cupped his cheek and tilted his head upward. Eyes opened he stared at the man in front of him. Harry shifted on the couch, putting his book off to the side and moved towards him. He leaned forward until Draco could feel his breath. Harry stared at him for a moment, eyes running all over his face. And Draco? Well, he fell off the cliff.
“People look at me like I’m going to whip around and hit them with an unforgivable. That’s my life now.” He let out a small sigh.
Hagrid shook his head and sat down at his table.
“What were you thinking about?”
He never expected to return to Hogwarts after the war. Heck, he hadn’t expected to survive the war, never mind be acquitted of his crimes and then return to Hogwarts. He wasn’t quite sure what had happened during his trial, but he had heard that Harry had testified in his favor. Harry had been the only reason his mother, Narcissa, hadn’t ended up in Azkaban with his father. He had prevented Draco from the same fate. He wasn’t sure if he was grateful.
Draco hadn’t slept in well over a week, afraid of the night terrors that would keep him up anyways. But laying in the warmth of Harry's arms, he wasn’t afraid. His body was reacting to the effects of the potion wearing off and he knew he’d have one hell of a time getting through withdrawals, but this feeling, was worth it. He was ready to let himself sleep.
Draco nodded. He took a deep breath to steady himself before forcing himself to say his next words. “I want to thank you, Luna, for this opportunity. I know my family did you wrong during the war, and—”
Neither of them moved or spoke, simply staring at one another. Then it was impossible to say who moved first, holding each other in their arms as their mouths met in a passionate kiss.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. Even though Harry had referred to Draco as being his friend several times now, the word on Harry’s lips always had Draco’s stomach fluttering.
Harry felt his chest tighten, his stomach fluttering at the pet name which was
"What are you doing here?"
"It's hardly kooky considering I went there," Harry said crossly, causing Malfoy to roll his eyes.
Draco was about to tell Harry how stupid that sounded, when Harry switched the device on and Draco instantly cringed at the loud static noise that blasted out of it.
“It’s to record sounds underwater,” Potter explained. “Anything unusual could be the sounds of Nessie. Can you get the camera ready? Take photos of the scenery, but keep your eyes open for any disturbances in the water. If we could get a magical photo of Nessie it could be game-changing.”
"Almost. I would have been done earlier, if I had a partner who did his fair share of paperwork," Draco said, finishing off his final comment on their most recent closed case. He blew gently on the ink to help it dry.
“Fuck, your arse is perfect,” Draco ground out, and Harry opened his eyes to see Draco’s reflection looking hungrily down at his cock disappearing inside Harry. “You’re taking me in so wonderfully, Fuck, I bet I could get every inch inside of you before we’re done.”
“There were at least five of them, and I don’t much fancy dying today,” Draco responded shortly. “I’m going to call in for backup, so try to keep yourself occupied before you die of boredom, alright, Sweetheart?”
“Careful, Darling,” came Pansy’s sultry voice from beside him. “We wouldn’t want Blaise to burst into flames, but he may very well do so if you continue glaring at him so.”
It took only moments for Harry to come as soon as he got his fingers wrapped around his cock, stroking himself until he was utterly spent.
As if summoned by Harry’s thoughts, Draco popped his head into the small office they shared.
Summoning all his Gryffindor courage, Harry eased in the rest of the way and pressed their lips together. He melted almost immediately at the touch, pleasure bursting through him at the feel of Malfoy’s soft mouth moving against his own. Malfoy drew Harry’s lower lip between his own and nibbled ever so slightly with teeth, and Harry’s knees almost buckled at the sensation. He realised belatedly that the reason they didn’t was because Malfoy’s arms were around his waist, holding him firmly.
He’d made it a few chapters in when he heard the door to the room next door creak open, followed by voices. Draco was back home, and it appeared he’d brought Pansy with him.
Harry smiled. “Italy inspired me. It turns out I can paint just as well when I’m happy as when I’m depressed.”
“Fancy that, with you being in a toy shop,” Malfoy quipped, and Harry felt his face flush.
The weather was too glorious to stay inside, so he retrieved a book from his room which he could read outside. He chose his very battered copy of
“Don’t fret, Potter, I’d never take you to the kind of restaurant where you’d embarrass me so easily. That being said, I couldn’t stand by and allow you to eat Pansy’s cooking. She’s absolutely dreadful, the poor thing. She insists on trying things without house-elves, but the truth is she should just leave those jobs to the ones who are supposed to do them.”
Harry managed a smile. “Thank you. God, you fucked me good. I enjoyed it, but I’m going to be hurting for
“That isn’t quite a rejection of my offer,” Draco pointed out, raising his eyebrows teasingly.
“That’s a big word for you to use,” Draco retorted, opening his eyes. “But sadly no. That might make my life easier.”
“Because you’re coming with me,” Draco said plainly. “You can’t come all the way to Lake Como and not swim in it.”
“I’m going to go for a dip in the sea,” Harry said, making Draco jump. He’d been so focused in his gazing that for a horrified moment he thought he’d been called out for it. “Are you coming?”
“Me too, but I suppose they thought defeating Voldemort was the only check I needed to pass. Do you want to wait here while I check in? There are probably seats inside if you want to wait in reception.”
“Just thinking about how much I love you,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s hand.
Draco crinkled his nose in disgust. "Pub quizzes just end up with me and Granger doing the all the work while you and Weasley get pissed. Let's go to
With more lube added, Draco worked in a third finger. Harry felt even more full now, and he pushed back against Draco desperate for more. This was what he loved, being spread open and stuffed full.
Potter didn’t seem at all bothered by the weather, sitting back as their oars moved them towards the middle of the loch. He and Draco both had their hands on the oars despite the fact magic was moving them, just to look less suspicious if any Muggles looked over and saw them moving on their own.
Blaise Zabini knew how to throw the wildest parties.
“Thank you,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “We finally got over our shyness, I guess.”
Pansy shook her head, her sleek dark hair bobbing at the movement. “You know Blaise; he has a new lover every month or so. They look good together, don’t you think?”
“Fuck off, Blaise,” Draco answered without malice. “How many people have you fucked this week?”
"Oh," the man said. "You're noble. I don't meet many people like you; my name's Draco."
“The past is the past, Draco,” Luna interrupted, waving her hand dismissively. “There’s no point lingering on things that hurt us. Besides, your actions now mean far more than any words of apology ever can.”
While the chauffeur retrieved their luggage from the boot of the car, the front door of the villa opened and a tall, handsome couple stepped out. Both were blonde, and dressed in elegant black clothes which fitted their slender forms perfectly. The woman had a dazzling diamond necklace around her neck, while the man carried a black cane with a silver snake’s head attached to the top.
Draco’s eyes widened at her incredible perception, and he shared a glance with Harry who’d gone bright red.
Draco reached out and grasped Potter’s wrist without thinking. They both froze. Potter’s skin was softer than Draco had imagined.
It was ridiculous—
“Just, you’re really sexy,” Potter said, lips turning up into a semi-smirk. “But I don’t do one-night-stands. I know we had a pretty volatile relationship when we were kids, but I think we’re both grown up enough now to put our pettiness aside and maybe have a serious go at things, if that’s what you want.”
“It’s a way of communicating with spirits and those on the other side,” Harry explained. “It’s a board with letters and a few words on it, and we touch a planchette, which a spirit will move to spell out answers.”
“No, I’m just making sure I remember this forever,” Harry answered, his voice just as soft. He lowered his head, feeling his hair fall forwards to tickle his skin. He paused just above Draco’s mouth, heart pounding in his chest as he realised he was about to have his first ever kiss, with a man far too handsome for his own good. It felt like a fantasy, or a dream, and he could scarcely believe it was happening.
In the light of the moon, Harry Potter was ethereally beautiful. His midnight black hair framed his face, his vibrant emerald eyes looking into Draco’s with a look of pure adoration and desire.
First of all, the hotel was clearly a budget place. The carpet was a mucky brown colour and the walls a faded beige. The front desk and the keys behind it looked like they had seen better days, and the receptionist was a tired-looking middle-aged woman who seemed to wish she was anywhere but there.
Harry was in his room, cross-legged on the bed listening to his walkman. It was only when the music went silent between songs that he could hear voices in the room next door. He paused his walkman and pulled his earbuds out so that he could hear better.
His words were dry, but Harry could tell it was a joke. He wondered if Draco had always just had a twisted sense of humour, and Harry had been unable to read it properly.
And if Harry didn’t want Draco...well, Harry would go home horny, but he wouldn’t jump on Draco just because of proximity. A bastard, Draco was, but he wasn’t a rapist.
Harry opened the limoncello, the metal pull releasing with a click and a hiss. Though the drink was no longer ice cold, the tart lemon flavour was refreshing. He pulled his knees to his chest and rested his book against them, turning the pages with one hand and using the other to sip his drink.
“Yes, yes, I’m ready,” Harry said, breath hitching in his throat as Draco finally pushed inside of him. “Fuck, you feel so good.”
Draco froze for a moment as Harry’s thigh pressed against him, but he relaxed as he felt Harry stiffen in response to his reaction. Acting far braver than he felt, Draco stretched his arm out on the back of the sofa, as close to Harry’s back as he could without touching it.
“I was a bit of a wild child right after I left school, but I swapped my drinking for painting. It’s a much healthier form of therapy,” Harry said. “I could probably handle drinking wine in a snobby way like you, though.” He grinned, to show Draco he was joking, and the conversation moved on to their very different upbringings.
“More than ever,” Harry said pleadingly. “Fuck me, Draco.”
Dobby looked amused. “I’m named Toby Dobbington, but Dobby is a nickname that stuck. My best friend is Winkerman, but we all call her Winky, so I think I got off lucky. If you need anything, don’t be afraid to ask.”
It was the deposit and furnishing an apartment that was his problem. While he desperately tried to save up some funding, he was forced to continue to intrude.
“She’s, uh, not my type,” Harry said, and his blush deepened as he continued to look up somebody who was
“What I’d give for a villa with a swimming pool right now,” Harry muttered. “If it wasn’t so damn lovely here, I’d charm the campervan into an igloo and go and sit in there.”
Harry snatched the flask from Draco’s hands, took a sip, as directed, and promptly spluttered as his mouth and throat burned. His coughing disrupted his balance and his head dipped under the sea, salty water filling his open mouth and causing him to splutter more as he resurfaced. He felt very much like a drowned rat in that moment, with his hair sticking to his face.
"What's there?" Ava said, panic now etched into her tone. "What? No! No!"
His gaze finally fell away from Draco when the sound of a roaring motorbike came up the gravel driveway, close to where they were seated at the patio for breakfast. The driver pulled to a stop, stood from the bike, and like a beautiful knight in a movie, removed his helmet and revealed a stunning face.
“Lower your shorts for me, Darling,” Draco said hotly into Harry’s ear.
Harry grinned. “Lavender will be happy to hold him while he weeps, I’m sure. Thanks, though, Gin, for thinking of me. I don’t especially like your underhanded Slytherin tactics, but it was nice of you anyway.”
It was worth sharing his food just to see the look on Potter’s face. Almost as soon as the haggis touched his tongue, his face screwed up in horror, but like the bold Gryffindor he was, he swallowed his mouthful.
“I don’t think the Loch Ness Monster eats anything, because it’s hard to eat when you don’t exist,” Draco said blandly, making Potter roll his eyes. “Just throw everything in, but be prepared to attract all the birds and fish in the area. Actually, don’t put meat in the water.”
Draco shrugged. “Pizza is a rather Muggle food item, and not a high class one, either.”
“Tell me about it,” Draco said, glowering. “What are you doing? Did you know you have paint on your face? Here, let me-”
“Hey, Pans. Am I okay to stay here for a while?”
“You’re so desperate for this, aren’t you?” Draco purred, pressing the tip of a fourth finger against Harry’s rim. “Can you take one more, do you think?”
Draco shook his head. “No. I have standards, you see. Blaise is lucky I even turned up, knowing my thoughts on this kind of
Draco wasn’t sure when Blaise had started dating Potter, but it made his stomach twist uncomfortably just looking at them. Potter was wearing tightly fitting leather trousers and a strappy, bondage style top, and had clearly been dressed by Blaise. No doubt Blaise just wanted Potter as his pretty little famous accessory, and Potter was probably only with him rumours had it that Blaise was excellent in bed.
Harry’s cheeks flushed furiously but he nodded eagerly. “I do. After we’re done, maybe I’ll tell you about all my other fantasies too.”
The last few minutes before Harry arrived dragged and the itch of need beneath Draco’s skin grew ever stronger. He’d been so patient and so methodical up til now; Harry was the final piece of the puzzle. Harry was wild, like a whirlwind, but soon he would be under Draco’s control.
So when he'd received a letter from Headmistress McGonagall asking if he'd consider switching his role as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Durmstrang to Hogwarts, Harry had readily agreed. Although he loved Durmstrang, it wasn't home.
Draco pulled his fingers from Harry’s hole and leaned down over him, his mouth just over Harry’s ear. “I want to see your face as I spread your arse around my cock.” Harry groaned loudly, almost coming at the
Harry also found himself watching Pansy through most of the meal, but it was for entirely different reasons. Pansy was gorgeous, had a witty sense of humour, and appeared intelligent, and Harry hated her for it.  It wasn’t even the poor woman’s fault, and she’d done nothing wrong aside from being close to Draco.
Harry’s prick twitched with interest beneath his shorts, and he inhaled against the material again.
Determined very much not to look like his father, Draco did decide to put some effort into rocking his hips in time to the music, but he absolutely refused to throw his hands in the air like Potter and Blaise were doing. Draco’s gaze found itself drawn to the sway of Potter’s hips, and the plump curve of his arse in the leather.
So Pansy had a girlfriend? That was good to know, and meant Harry no longer had to glare at the poor woman every time he saw her with Draco. Although Harry had no right to glare at her anyway, given that he had no right to Draco or any kind of ownership over him. Harry was simply a teenage boy with a crush on an older man, and he’d have to endure the appropriate heartache that went along with that.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “I kept getting in trouble for being too impulsive and not listening to my superiors. Plus Luna needed help with
One glass was all Draco needed.
“How would you know what the Slytherin common room felt like?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes.
“Oh,” Harry said dejectedly. “Can I sit with you? I’ll read my book and be quiet.”
And not only did Harry already feel like he was missing Malfoy's company, he was going to miss looking into those steely grey eyes. He had grown to enjoy Malfoy's snark and wit, and the easy banter they shared.
Draco nodded. “My friend Blaise is throwing a party, and as Blaise knows absolutely everybody who’s rich and famous--myself included--I couldn’t miss it for the world.”
“Then I eat PB and J sandwiches,” Harry said, grinning weakly. It soon fell from his face at Ginny’s disapproving look, which she’d clearly learned from her mother. “You don’t need to worry about me, Gin, I’m doing fine, honestly. Or, I’m doing better, at least. Marigold is really pleased with how I’m progressing.”
“Don’t be arrogant, Potter,” Draco said, but it was without malice. “I quit for
“You don’t need to. I’m not going to intrude on your holiday with your girlfriend and be your tag-along third wheel. I’m sure you’d enjoy a holiday a lot more if you didn’t have to worry about your sad friend.”
He and Draco had tracked down a suspect to a Muggle farmyard, and in the ensuing fight had ended up covered in some rather unpleasant materials. Harry had been happy with a Cleaning Charm to keep him going until he could get home for a shower, but Draco had insisted on getting a change of clothing the second they got back to the Ministry.
“I believe in magical theory, not fairy tales,” Draco said. “However, as childish as I think you sound, I’ll still be happy to join you in producing these articles.”
“Morning, Sweetheart. Robards wants to see us immediately; he’s got some new information on the Selwyn murder case.”
“Draco, I’m letting you go,” Niles cut in bluntly. Draco felt his heart drop into his stomach.
“You don’t really think your cousin’s so stupid he could manage to book us two double rooms in a row?” Draco asked.
“Do you know who Tom Riddle is?” Harry asked, so quiet that Draco had to strain to hear him.
“Yes, but I doubt your ability to stay quiet,” Draco stated, though he looked like he was fighting a smile. Harry flashed him a grin, and Draco shook his head in defeat. “Fine. Stay. But I won’t be afraid to change my mind if you annoy me.”
“He’ll be delighted to meet you too, I’m sure,” Narcissa said, speaking up for the first time. She gave Harry a look he couldn’t decipher the meaning of. “We’ll give you a proper tour of the villa and the grounds tomorrow, but I imagine you’re all worn out from your travels. Our butler, Dobby, shall show you to your rooms, and will retrieve you in an hour for a light supper.”
It seemed like Harry wasn't going to give in easily, however, and Draco wasn't a patient man. He'd had enough of playful flirting, and even blatantly hitting on Harry hadn't been enough to get him to give in to what Draco wanted. Alcohol, evidently, wasn't as powerful a tool as Draco had hoped it would be.
Draco nodded. “Better than whatever the fuck a burger is.”
“Don’t sell yourself short, Potter. You’ve already get enough of that going on in your height.”
Draco smirked. “Excellent, I’ll take the side nearest the window.”
with Harry. Thoughts of pleasing Draco soon left the realm of Auror partnership and entered strictly sexual territory, finally reaching a point where Harry’s cock would twitch each time Draco called him sweetheart.
“And here is your room,” Dobby said to Harry, opening the door on a mid-sized room. It was tastefully decorated, with hardwood floors and mahogany furnishings. The window was large, and presumably looked out onto the garden, though it was too dark to see anything out of it now. “I’m afraid you’ll be sharing your bathroom with Draco; I hope that won’t be an inconvenience for you.”
“Is there anyone in here with us?” Harry called out to the room instead, choosing to ignore Draco. “Can you push another book from the shelf? Or you can knock something off the desk, if you’d like.”
“Have you ever had a burger?” Harry asked.
Potter rolled his eyes.
Pansy took his hand and gave him a kind smile. “I’m pleased for you, Draco. You deserve this.”
Draco found his thoughts drifting to fantasies of sitting with Harry, doing a jigsaw of puppies together. His eyes fluttered shut as he grimaced, wishing his could stop his traitorous mind from throwing cutesy images of Harry at him.
Luna beamed brightly at him, which made Draco feel slightly better about the chaotic nature of the place. Rainbows and animals weren’t his scene at all, but he supposed selling bats hadn’t been either.
“You’re not a peasant, Harry, you’re not sleeping on the floor,” Draco said bluntly. “We can manage a couple of nights sharing a bed. Unless you’re scared of me.”
Draco huffed. “Merlin, your sad childhood makes it so hard to make fun of you properly. Fine, we’ll just share the damn bed.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Nice to hear you all still gossip about me. But yes, I do enjoy my job. I’m getting paid good money to go on holiday and do incredibly easy work for Harry. The hunting for imaginary creatures part is ridiculous, but—”
Harry heard him mutter a spell, and then the wall in front of them was transformed into a mirror. Harry could easily see his utterly ravished looking reflection, his hair sticking up in directions that shouldn’t even exist, his cheeks flushed bright pink and his pupils blown. Draco stood behind him, his prick standing proudly out in front of him.
as an assistant journalist.”
“I could leave you alone—” Astoria began.
Sat on a raised platform at the back of the club, in a black, iron throne, no doubt charmed to be more comfortable than it looked, sat the birthday boy himself, surveying his party like a king observing his subjects.
“Thanks for being such a hero,” Harry said dryly, but it was also forced. He could still feel Draco’s touch on his skin. “I’ll clean the paint off our bed before tonight, don’t worry.”
“He split his soul before he died, and as a result he’s never able to move on. He has no soul left on Earth to return to our world, and not enough left him to go into the next plain. I guess he still watches over me from wherever he’s stuck.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “Maybe. Or maybe there’s been a long line of Nessies.”
It looked like there’d be no arguing with Pansy over their restaurant choice for the night, but Harry wasn’t one to pass up the opportunity for pizza anyway. Lunches at his Muggle primary school had always been brighter when there was pizza on the menu.
“‘M fine,” Harry croaked out, willing himself to pay attention to Draco’s intel on the potion smuggling gang.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Draco said, coming up behind Harry. “I like being this high, and looking at things below me. It reminds me of flying.”
“Look!” Harry cried excitedly, pointed at a book which had fallen off a shelf in what appeared to be a home office.
Harry had no intention to go to university, but he figured he might as well play along with his uncle’s game so he wouldn’t suffer his wrath.
“I thought maybe my flies were open the first couple of times, but you’re definitely perving on me,” Draco said dryly, raising an eyebrow. “Stealth really isn’t your forte.”
While the class filtered out, Ava hovered near her desk, arms folded over her chest and her gaze cast down to the stone floor.
Both of them shucked off their clothes urgently, leaving them in a crumpled heap on the floor. Finally, the only fabric that remained on either of them was Draco’s boxers, which were tented with a promise of the huge erection inside it.
“He was a sullen little thing. He thought because he was rich he owned the world, and treated other people like he was beneath them. As he became older he thankfully began to realise that the world wasn’t going to give him everything he wanted unless he worked for it, and pushed his focus onto his studies.”
Vernon let out a grunt of displeasure at the concept of Harry being considered one of his ‘boys’.
“Your dad peacocks roaming your front garden, and not just any peacocks, but albino ones. That’s an unusual sight to see, even in old, posh manors with a history of evil deeds.”
And Draco would be lying if he hadn’t thought about dating Potter; he had those gorgeous green eyes and just-fucked hair, but Blaise needed somebody willing to party all night and sleep the days away. They just didn’t make sense together.
“Both,” Ginny said without shame. “As I said, Pansy knows that Draco’s been smitten with you for a long time, and you were always far too interested in his coming and goings than schoolboy rivals should be. Besides, the two of you make a cute couple.
Once the chauffeur had loaded their suitcases into the boot, he got into the driver’s seat and set off towards Lake Como. Harry rested his head against the window and closed his eyes, a smile on his face.
“Me too, Harry,” Draco said softly, a crooked smile twisting the corners of his mouth as Harry’s eyes took on a strong, silver gleam. “Now, how about you be a good friend and come ride my cock?”
“Good,” Luna pressed on. “This job will involve travel across the UK and the world, but your transport, board, and food will all be paid for, and of course you’ll get a monthly wage of 300 Galleons.”
“We are going to have some time in the sun though, aren’t we? Not working, I mean,” Draco clarified. “I don’t mind going on a coyote hunt if I get at least a little bit of sun and relaxation afterwards.”
depths.”
The sun was beating down hard, so dazzlingly bright that Harry had to charm his glasses into sun protectors. The walk to the beach already had him sweating, and the idea of cooling down in the beautiful waters was too good an opportunity to pass up.
"Well, at least we know where she is," said Malfoy.
Some of them stood around smoking, others chatting at tables, while others danced and groped one another on the courtyard that doubled as a dancefloor. Harry sat at a table on his own, watching jealously as Blaise and Draco danced together.
Harry shot Draco a quizzical look. “You think we can’t take Muggle burglars?”
Harry shot Draco a grin. “Nice to know you’d save my life I started to drown.”
Pansy smiled wickedly. “Everyone’s here now,
Malfoy nodded. “It is the best place. I ensure I craft every single toy with perfection.”
There was nary even a second for Draco to register the cool air on his cock before it was replaced by the hot wetness of Harry’s mouth.
Draco’s eyes darkened. “Yeah? You want me to fuck you, Sweetheart? So needy for my cock you’d take it here and now?”
“So where are you two off to next?” Astoria asked loudly, gaining Draco and Pansy’s attention.
"Wow," Malfoy said, staring wildly at Harry. "Your eyes! You're...they're glowing."
Venice had been their final stop on their road trip, and the city had been, like all the others, beautiful, but the many canals and waterways made it stand out above the others. It was scenic both in nature and architecture, and of all the places they’d seen, Harry could envision himself living in Venice above the others.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “
Harry shook his head and smiled. “I have lots of regrets, but this won’t be one.”
Ginny looked moderately happier at the mention of Harry’s therapist. “Good. And you know I don’t mean to nag you, Harry; Morgana forbid I turn into my mum. I just worry about you. Actually, that was part of the reason I popped round here.”
“Are you going out then?” Harry asked, as Draco pulled on a shimmering, sequined jacket from his wardrobe.
With one last look at the door to make sure that there were still no customers, Draco left the counter and made his way over to Niles. Niles’ face was set in a grim line, but that was no different to how he usually looked.
“I think I do. It should be considered a public service, in fact, helping you leave the Dursley household.
“You look like a child seeing Honeydukes for the first time,” Draco commented, his words only partially mocking.
of it,” Potter said. “It’s like venison. My dad was a stag Animagus, so I can’t touch the stuff.”
“Well, Potter, will you join me?”
him, but was too good and noble to act on it. Draco didn't care about good and noble, though. What he did care about was getting Harry in his bed, and Harry would feel the same way as soon as he stopped giving a damn about doing the 'right' thing.
“But why are we going to look at ghosts?” Draco asked, looking away from the parchment to give Harry a quizzical look. “I thought you only searched for nonsensical things, and it’s a well-known fact that ghosts exist.”
“They aren’t usually used for torture, but I can’t say a campervan by itself won’t be torture for you, Draconis,” Ginny said, clapping Draco on the shoulder.
Malfoy smirked but said nothing, and no further words were exchanged between them after the game started.
“Yes, but you’re both much better people now,” Luna added softly. “You’ve grown out of your cruelty, which takes a lot of strength.”
“What the fuck is the Loch Ness Monster?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes again. "Must be a lonely life if you're trying to get approval from your students. Let's just see which of our teaching methods garners the best results at the end of the year."
Harry swallowed heavily. Malfoy looked
“Yes, and if you insist on me being my usual self, then I’m going to make sure that I’m the best fuck that you’ll ever have.”
The campervans were magically altered inside to make them wider than the usual Muggle ones, and there was no steering wheel or pedals--apparently they moved with magic rather than manual power.
"Yes, please more," Harry begged breathlessly. "It's so good, Draco."
“I doubt it,” Harry grinned. “The way most attempts on my life go, I’d probably survive to tell the tale.”
Dudley looked up at him blankly, and gave him an innocent smile. “Can I help you with something, Draco?”
“You’re right,” Draco deadpanned. “Coyotes are real, I forgot. Do you speak any Spanish?”
“Good, and I’ll prove it’s not nonsense,” Harry said, placing a board on the floor and gesturing for Draco to take a seat.
Draco considered him for a moment. “I’ll take you; we can go by bike. I’m not usually so generous, but I need to post this letter. Find Dobby and ask him to get out mine and my mother’s bike--she’s around your height so you can use hers. I’ll be finished by the time you come back.”
He came far too soon, muffling his cries of pleasure with his hand as he spilled his release over Draco's fingers. Draco finished soon after, kissing Harry urgently as he came inside of him.
“Er, okay,” Harry said, his breath hitching in his throat as Malfoy moved round the desk to be closer to him. Malfoy was taller than Harry realised, having a good two inches on Harry. Harry would have to lean up to kiss him, to move his lips against Malfoy’s own, plush, red, plump ones.
She was right; Draco did choose to wallow in self-pity because it was what he knew best. Life had been hard for him for years, but finally—
It was mostly because he and Draco had taken any and every opportunity to make out, like they were randy teenagers again.
Harry grinned despite himself. "You're on."
“It won’t,” Dudley called out behind him. “And I hope the two of you had a great time!”
"Well, I was told good luck was coming my way, and then you wandered into my shop." Draco caught Harry's wrist between his elegant fingers, looking down at the owl tattoo Harry had that. It was a simple design, a small outline of an owl, but it meant a lot to Harry; it reminded him of the snowy owl that sat on the branch outside his bedroom window every night, his only friend at the lonely house he shared with his aunt and uncle. "I like this. Do you have any others?"
He let out another loud whimper as the head of Draco’s cock hit his prostate, and Draco smirked in satisfaction. He grasped Harry’s hips, using them for leverage as he began to build up his pace. He slowed down every so often, edging even more of himself inside Harry until finally his balls were resting against Harry’s arse.
. And that someone seemed liked somebody out of reach if Blaise was so eager for his friend to move on. Harry’s gut twisted in jealousy again.
"How do you know it's to do with Ava?" he asked, trying to focus on the matter at hand.
good at puzzles. Get on your knees, Sweetheart, and we’ll figure it out.”
Harry rested the guitar gently against his legs, and his gaze met Draco’s again. Draco inclined his head, and his eyes studied Harry so intently that Harry had to look away. He could still feel Draco’s eyes on him, and he felt his face flush under the scrutiny. It felt nice to have Draco’s attention, though.
Draco resisted the urge to bury his hands in Harry’s hair, to fuck his face. Draco liked control, in and out of the bedroom, and though he usually liked to have hands-on control, it was nice to just lie back and have Harry worship his cock.
“They’re not so bad.” Harry shrugged, and shot Draco a grin, knowing one thing Draco wouldn’t be aware of yet. “We’ll always have a place to eat and sleep, at least.”
“Muggles are pretty good at making food, I’ll give them that,” Pansy said. “And I asked Millicent to ask Granger where the best pizza shop in Naples was, and she said it was
He smiled at Harry's sleeping form. He'd never thought his long-standing crush on Harry would come to anything, and had resigned himself to a life of heartache, until miraculously Harry had allowed Draco into his heart. Harry was so kind and caring, witty, bold, and just plain lovable. Draco loved nothing more than holding Harry's hand, or seeing his smile.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat at the familiar voice, and he turned around to see Draco cycling furiously towards them. Draco jumped off the bike before it had even come to a full stop, sending the bike crashing into a tree.
now. The awareness of that was as bewildering as it was delightful.
eccentric,” Draco corrected. “You might lack style, but your clothes are a least relatively normal. What are you doing anyway?”
“I saw it!” Harry blurted out. “The day we fought that potions smuggler on the farm. I accidentally walked in here while you were still getting changed and well, uh, you’re
Potter gave him a confused look before he grinned. “I have so much to teach you. Aliens aren’t our focus today, though. We’re going to be looking for the Loch Ness Monster. It made sense to stay relatively local for our first article.”
But Malfoy wasn't looking at him; he was instead looking at the figure of Lucius Malfoy who was standing smiling, with his arms reached out. Both his arms were bare of the Dark Mark.
“It’s alright, Harry,” Draco cut in, flashing him a wicked smirk. “I’m flattered, actually. And I’m quite taken with your arse, which is a lot easier to perv on without being caught.”
Even though Potter had told him that countless Muggles believed in the stories, it was bewildering to Draco to see so many of them excited and eager about the Loch Ness Monster. Muggles had always felt entirely un-magical and dull to Draco, but here they were, embracing magic—a make-believe, fantastical type of magic, but a type of magic nonetheless.
Draco tried not to let his surprise show at that amount. He’d barely made half that in his previous job.
Twice now he had caught Malfoy’s gaze, but Malfoy had never shied away when Harry caught him; only smirked and licked his lips hungrily. Harry wondered if his face was going to be in a constant state of flushing from now on, because that was how it felt.
Draco’s eyes glimmered playfully. “I
“Clever trick,” Draco said, nodding at the bag. “I assume it’s not your handy work.”
Harry raised a brow. “Should we be drinking if we’re doing paperwork?”
Draco would do anything if it made Harry happy.
“What? No!” Harry protested quickly.
Harry smiled despite himself. “You’re rude, but it’s refreshing. Take your spot, then, I’ll find somewhere else; not like this garden’s lacking in nice places to sit.”
“Vivaldi, actually,” Draco retorted. “Italian composers are among the best in the world.”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry in response, but kept his eyes locked on Luna as he mouthed ‘yes, and it was great.’
"The Mirror of Erised is nothing more than a cruel and dangerous trick," Harry said quietly. "I almost fell for its charms a long time ago, and many a witch and wizard has wasted away in front of it. You don't need to be sorry for falling for its deception, Ava."
Potter nodded, his pale cheeks staining red despite the confidence he was trying to put across. “Yeah, I do. You’re hot. I think you’re a bit of a twat but I really like that about you.”
Draco was the first person he saw, writing a letter at the table on the veranda. He looked up when Harry approached and gave him a wry smile.
He sighed. “Do you want to try a bit?”
“Hmm,” Draco smirked. “The jury’s still out on you. Still, if I had to share my entire days and nights with any of Ginevra’s friends, I’m glad it’s you.”
"It sounds like you're having a lot of fun." Harry's thighs felt soaked with the amount of lube Draco was using as he pressed in the third finger. "You're all blissed out."
“So you met while watching your ex-girlfriend play Quidditch? That’s certainly...interesting.”
Harry shook his head and raised a vial of water in one hand, and threw a large cross at Draco who caught it easily.
’s reception room was the kind of thing that people saw when high.
Ginny had promised that Italy would be sunny and hot, and said he needed to dress for Italy rather than Britain. Still, he couldn’t help but feel self-conscious until he finally arrived at the International Portkey Department and found himself amongst similarly clad holidaymakers.
“Oh yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry said. “Can you get a photo? Good girl, Gertrude, he was probably watching you until me and Draco spooked him off.”
"Hmm," Parvati murmured beside him, hiding her grin with her glass. "Looks like this year should turn out to be an interesting one."
“Are you afraid of getting your hands dirty?” Dobby asked. “Using the tips of your fingers mix the egg a bit at a time into the flour until it’s all combined, and then knead it. You have to be quite tough when it comes to kneading, and keep going until the dough feels smooth to the touch.”
“Did nobody tell you it was rude to eavesdrop?” Draco countered, and Harry felt his face flush.
The more time that went on, the more Draco started calling Harry sweetheart, as if it was completely normal. Draco never made a deal out of it, saying the word like he would Harry’s name, and seemed entirely casual about the whole thing.
There was a lot to love about Auror work, like the thrill of the chase, exhilarating battles, and bringing criminals to justice. There was also a lot to hate about it, namely obnoxious lawyers and the mountains of paperwork.
Draco had never used drugs, but he imagined that the
Harry found himself yearning to lick those drops of water away, and he wondered how Draco’s lips would feel against his own.
“Well, what if I just read my book and stay quiet? That’s almost like me being asleep.”
Then Draco lowered his head and swiped his tongue over Harry’s hole.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You’re still a prat, I see.”
“Morsmordre. Yes, the very exclusive school run by supposed criminal mastermind, Tom Riddle,” Draco added, seeing Harry’s shocked expression. “Riddle’s rumoured out-of-school activities may be terrible, but he’s an excellent scholar and teacher, and it’s thanks to his personal tutoring that I got into Cambridge. My father says you went to Smeltings?”
“May I?”
T - O - M - R - I - D - D - L -.-
The realm inside the mirror was dark, the floor beneath their feet like the blackest marble. As his eyes adjusted to the dark, Harry could see tiny, twinkling lights speckled through the air. He was almost shocked at how clearly he could see Malfoy when he turned around, the white-blond of his hair almost luminescent.
Draco dropped his hand to grasp Harry's thigh, prompting Harry to gasp and give Draco a wild look.
Draco grinned wickedly. “Yeah, good luck with that.”
“Demons? What are they? A form of poltergeist?”
“Do you?” Draco asked, his voice hardly more than a whisper, but Potter heard him nonetheless.
It was too early to sleep, and the sticky, humid air would have made it nearly impossible anyway. The ceiling fan gave little relief, and Harry stripped down to his boxers, lying on top of his covers with a book in hand.
“Fine,” he said with a sigh. “Tell Lovegood I’ll accept her offer. And thank you, I guess, for everything. I can’t imagine I’ve been pleasant company for any of you.”
“Good for them,” Pansy agreed.
Draco had also made an antidote to the potion, which he’d already taken. Harry was an Auror, so he was sure to find it suspicious if they were drinking different wines. So now Draco could pour them glasses from the same bottle, and only Harry would be affected, none the wiser to what he was drinking.
“Your mouth is exquisite, but I want to come in your arse. Bend over my desk for me, Harry; I’m going to open you up, and get you wet and ready for my cock.”
“My age doesn’t mean anything,” Harry said hotly. “I’m old enough to decide who I want, and who I want is you.”
“Mmhmm.” Pansy looked Draco up and down skeptically. “You’re so transparent, Darling.”
300 Galleons a month really had to be worth it.
“Goody,” Draco said dryly, trying very hard not to smile at Harry’s ridiculous enthusiasm. “I do hope I don’t get lost in the woods with you.”
Draco ignored him, pressing his thumb against Harry’s hole as his other hand reached the lube he’d hidden behind a sofa cushion in preparation. Squeezing a generous amount onto his fingers, he moved them to Harry’s entrance and pushed one inside.
Draco swallowed heavily, the sweat on his palms no longer from the heat of the crowd. He never got nervous when it came to dating people; he was known for his cool and suave attitude, but something about Potter broke Draco down to his basic self, and it was pleasantly refreshing.
“I hope we are,” Potter said, offering his hand to Draco. “Maybe we could even start using each other’s first names. What do you think,
“She’s a peaceful fantasy story, you mean,” Draco corrected.
He chose a toy soldier in the end, painted in vibrant shades of red, green, and blue, with a glimmer of silver on the delicately drawn sword. He took it to the front desk, and watched, transfixed, as Malfoy’s long, elegant fingers wrapped the soldier up in wrapping paper. Harry wondered what those fingers would feel like brushing against his skin, or exploring him in intimate places that Harry had only considered in dreams in the middle of the night. He shivered at the thought.
He jumped when something soft brushed against his leg. Looking down, he was surprised to see a fluffy white cat nuzzling its head against his jeans.
It wasn’t even like Draco was a prude. He’d had plenty of sex, but it had always been with partners he’d hoped he have a future with. Needless to say, all of the men had failed to live up to Draco’s standards and their partnerships had fizzled out, but Draco had always had basic decency with the situation.
Draco’s lips curled up into a smirk. “True. Now you’re awake, you can kindly leave me in peace.”
Draco laughed, bewildered that he was actually having a pleasant conversation with a Muggle for the first time in his life.
Finally, Draco selected a restaurant, a pretty orange building decorated in vibrant green vines, and which smelled so tantalising that Harry’s mouth was watering as soon as he stepped through the door.
"I can just imagine what she'd say to that.
He looked back to Potter, who was waiting on Draco’s response.
Harry couldn’t even pretend to be happy for his aunt and uncle, and snuck out of the room without being noticed. Being around happy people wasn’t something Harry could handle right now.
“I really don’t want to kiss you right now,” Harry said, as quietly as Draco had done.
The water splashed gently against their boat, making soothing music. The setting sun cast a fiery orange glow across the canal, Draco, and the buildings around them, bathing them in warm light.
“No, you can’t claim this as Chupacabra evidence,” Draco said as he snapped a photo of the gruesome animal remains. “Anything could have killed these things.”
Pansy cackled loudly. “Some orgy, with two lesbians and a gay man! Though you’d enjoy it either way, wouldn’t you Harry?”
“There you go,” Malfoy said, his fingers brushing against Harry’s as he pushed the wrapped toy towards him. Malfoy’s skin was soft, and cool to the touch, yet somehow Harry’s fingers burned from the touch. “I’m sure your godson will love it. Perhaps you could tell me about his reaction over dinner sometime.”
“I’m aware of that,” Potter said dryly. “Any of the sightings of photos may have been of different creatures, so there may well be more than one.”
Draco hadn’t left his room all morning, and Harry was getting both bored and lonely. He didn’t know how long migraines were supposed to last, but it had been twenty-four hours now and he couldn’t imagine a headache lasting that long.
"I'll look forward to it," Draco said, his fingers still wrapped around Harry's wrist in a gentle hold.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "No wonder they kicked you off the Auror force, Mr Lone Wolf. I am perfectly capable of handling myself, you know, not to mention my intelligence levels exceed yours and I was the one who helped you find this damn mirror in the first place."
"It's Hell," came a small voice. Harry recognised it at once as Ava's. "Well we're not dead, but we may as well be. Everything good in here turns to ash."
Well, technically he did know why. Not only had he wanted an opportunity to stealthily ogle a shirtless Harry, he did enjoy sitting in the sun. He remained ever-pale, because his skin burned unless he wore a healthy coating of anti-sunburn balm, but that didn’t stop him from welcoming the pleasant warmth.
“Just under 11 inches,” Draco said, pride all too evident in his voice, but Harry was too busy salivating at the thought to care about his ego. He ran his hand across his crotch, pressing down hard enough that--finally--Harry was able to see the thick, bulging outline through the material of his trousers. “I wonder if I’ll be able to fit it all inside you. Do you want me to try?”
With his friend’s support--which some would consider nagging, Draco included--Draco had finally decided he needed to tell Harry who he really was.
The streets of Naples were narrow and crowded, and as a result Harry found his arm brushing against Draco’s as they pressed tightly together to avoid other tourists and the whizzing Vespa motorbikes which zoomed down the streets.
Draco inclined his head and raised his hip flask. “To being the sad friends who need lesbian babysitters.”
Draco laughed loudly, managing to stay neatly afloat throughout. “It’s almost tragic that nobody taught you how to handle your whiskey. I imagine it doesn’t taste so nice with sea water mixed in.”
It looked like Draco was going to have to allow Harry this Ouija Board as being a valid communication device for spirits. He was sure the spirits were simple ghosts, though, rather than the demons Harry had been talking about earlier—he couldn’t allow Harry to be that right.
Potter’s expression dropped, and he waved his hands in front of him wildly. “No, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m glad you’re still here! I know our history isn’t the best—”
He took the stairs up to his apartment, not wanting to take the lift that stank of piss. He walked briskly past peeling wallpaper and stained carpet, coming up short down his hallway as he saw his landlord pinning something to his door.
“Yes, Draco was a brat as boy,” came a new voice.
By his third drink Harry's eyes were bright, his cheeks flushed pink, and he seemed to find a reason to smile at
Dudley’s expression darkened. “No, it was me that got that. If I made Harry’s childhood miserable, it’s nothing compared to what my parents did to him.” He trailed off, glancing around to make sure Potter wasn’t coming back. “I shouldn’t even be telling you this. It makes me sick thinking about what my mum and dad did to him, but I still love them because they’re my parents. It’s definitely made my relationship with them a lot more complicated.”
"We get on really well now, don't we, Harry?" Draco said softly. "I feel like you
He was rock hard, his prick throbbing with need, and he was being offered what he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about for weeks. Besides, it had been so long that he’d been fucked into oblivion, and he desperately wanted Draco to do that to him.
Lucius’ lip curled upwards slightly, as though he, too, caught Vernon’s mistake, but he masked his features into one of indifference as he said, “very commendable of you, Vernon. Shall we adjoin to my sitting room for some brandy?”
His hole burned pleasantly as Draco slowly worked in his fourth finger, the lube dripping down Harry’s cheeks and thighs as Draco moved into him, opening him up for Draco’s cock. Harry’s own prick was achingly hard, throbbing with need, and he desperately needed Draco in him so that he could finally touch himself.
“Do you want to try something different?” Harry asked after they got back to their hotel room, leaning against the door with a casual air.
“I love big cocks,” Harry said loudly, without thinking, and resisted the urge to bury his now flaming face in his hands. “The bigger the better, honestly, and yours is the biggest I’ve ever seen.”
Francesco grasped Harry’s hips and pulled him flush against him so that they were front to back, and Harry could feel Francesco’s dick stirring against Harry’s back. Harry didn’t intend on going any further with him, no matter how handsome he was, so he tried not to grind too enthusiastically against him.
Harry cleared his throat and tried again. “You keep looking at my arse?”
It was only half four, but the sky was already pitch black, and the howling wind whipped icy snow over every inch of Harry's exposed face and arms. His fingers barely worked as he sent a text to his friend Ron, asking him to pick him up ASAP.
"Not recently, though it was a good thing you clarified. God, you were an arsehole at school. I always knew people can change though, either for better or worse. Hell, look at Snape; I thought he was the worst man in the world at one point, and he turned out to be one of the biggest heroes of all."
Harry grinned. “Always.”
“Such a lovely arse,” Draco said breathlessly. “The things I want to do it...I promise, Sweetheart, as soon as I can I’m getting you to a bed where I can take my time tearing you apart with pleasure, but I think we don’t have much choice to do anything but quick and dirty at this current moment.”
"Don't be a prat," Harry retorted. "Go and get our drinks. I can already feel the glitter fusing with my soul."
Their fingers joined together as they kissed. Draco’s lips were sweeter than Harry had imagined, and rougher too, but it was infinitely better than in any of his fantasies.
Without even thinking about what he was doing, Harry crossed the room and picked up the swimming briefs, still damp from the lake earlier. Unable to resist, Harry pressed his nose against the fabric and inhaled deeply, smelling the saltiness of Draco and the crisp aroma of the lake water.
“When we get out of this damn closet, I’m going to hold you to those words. We barely have room to stand, let alone get you on your knees to suck my cock. Fuck, I bet you’d look gorgeous on your knees with those pretty lips wrapped around it.”
Draco:
Draco sighed.
“I’m… I’m sorry.” His voice was thick and breathy. What had he just done? Oh no.
He got raveled up in his thoughts until a soft voice caught his attention.
He had chased Harry away. Harry hadn’t even attempted to answer his question. Just whispered a response full of such remorse and then ran. When he had first turned around, he could almost have sworn that Harry was crying. But that would be ridiculous wouldn’t it? Why would Harry be crying?
“But I would like to try.”
“Its Wideye.”
Harry blinked back slowly. “That’s me.”
Harry scooched up a bit to look him in the eye.
Hagrid stiffened.
Hagrid.
Draco frowned a bit, “How do you know that. You don’t even know what it is.”
No beta, and yes, I know im obsessed with eyes, sue me.
What had just happened?
He stood up and turned back to the fireplace and chose to forget his heart and lost himself in the fire once again.
His body felt fuzzy, like he’d just been high. Everything tingled. He could hear the soft sounds of people talking and the crackle of a fire. He felt calm, at peace, ignoring the black smudge on his mood from the events of the night. He slowly opened his eyes.
She smiled at him, “Of course sir, do you need anything else?” Draco shook his head, “No, thank you Dimsy, I should be done at the same time as usual.” The house elf nodded and apparated back to the kitchens.
His favorite sight, the beauty that laid in the depth of blues and greens highlighted by a roaring fire. Oh, oh no. He was doomed.
“Draco, I..” He shut his mouth. Something in those eyes had changed. The pain was back.
“Got heartburn Potter?” It came out sarcastic and almost mocking, but there was an undertone of something else in that comment. Harry shook his head and proceeded to take a seat on the couch in front of the fireplace. It was warm, and he couldn’t think of a better place to sit and read his book, and ponder on his new feelings than the couch from where he could watch the interest of said feelings without being caught.
“Are- Are you sure?” He pointed a small finger towards Fang who was staring at him intently.
“Uh, I like it sweet. So, plenty of sugar and cream please.”
Draco pulled himself out of his trance and felt for his flask, he pulled it out and lifted it to his lips.
Hagrid shut his eyes, “Im sure I don’t need to tell you that isn’t healthy and you're probably killing yourself.”
Draco took a step back and turned so his back was facing Harry. His arms came up and hugged around himself.
“Draco? Are you ok?” The concern slipped out before he could catch himself. He could see the surprise on the other man’s face. The open emotion clouded into confusion and then stubbornness.
“Then ask.”
And then he felt the brush of lips on his.
Harry:
Draco punched his hand into the frozen grass surrounding them.
Harry:
-----------
“Ahm, it’s a potion.”
The man was a cherry. And Harry, if he had to state an opinion on that, liked it very much.
Draco blinked; he hadn’t expected this at all. Never mind that, Harry continued anyways.
“Hagrid told me what you did last night. I guess I wanted to say thank you, and. And... that I’m sorry.”
Draco lived everyday in fear. Fear of his past, of his mistakes. Fear of his peers and what they thought of him, and most of all, fear of those dreams. He’d always been good at potions, so one night, he spent his sleep-time in the library, scouring the shelves for a fix. And he’d found it. In the bottle. A potion bottle that is. It was the opposite of Dreamless Sleep. It kept him awake. And he had been taking it religiously every since.
He relaxed and drifted off.
“Draco.” Harry let out a breath and wiped the mans tears once again.
“Potter,” Came the curt reply. “What are you doing here at 4 am.”
Draco shook his head.
Draco scowled at him. Its not like the daft boy would understand. He probably had nothing better to do than to annoy him.
He stared at the sleeping boy in stunned silence. Harry had barely made a coherent sentence, and then he looked straight at Draco and called him beautiful.
Nothing.
His brain couldn’t function. Who were these eyes?
“You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen in my life. Your eyes alone make me forget who I am. Your incredible, indescribably stunning, your blush makes me fall on my knees. Your heart is soft and sweet and I would do anything in the world to deserve a place in it.”
“I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t mean it.”
“You aren’t weak. You are strong and brave.”
His room was colder than he remembered. The book in his hand forgotten as he flopped onto his bed.
“Draco please, I’m begging you. Don’t.”
He side-eyed the blond for a bit more when he saw him pull out a flask and take a deep drink. He shuddered and then put it away.
Harry woke up after five hours, warm in the embrace of another man. Draco. He smiled; Draco was sleeping heavily. He was so relaxed, his face was soft and squished and he had a small string of drool running down onto Harrys blankets, and he was the most beautiful man Harry had ever seen in his life.
Harry opened his eyes and looked up at Draco’s face, pointedly not moving from his spot.
“Draco, I love you.”
“So…”
“All these years, all I wanted was to be allowed to love you, and here you are, lying in my lap, begging me to do so.”
And holy Merlin. Harrys lips were chapped and demanding and he could lose himself in this feeling. He was warm and content, and, tired. He was tired. And OH no, he needed to not be tired.
The hurt that was hidden behind those words felt like a thousand pounds on his chest. He couldn’t breathe. He turned over and sat back up. He couldn’t breathe.
“Because. I… Because I’m weak.”
“What you just said. I want to keep it forever.”
Harry sneered, “Wideye…”
So, its been a month, and I am sorry. I have the worst time management skills possible. But again, thank you for reading. No beta, all mistakes are mine, you are free to correct me in the comments. Much love <3
“Come in. Yah.” His voice was gruff and more than a little bit cold. The blond looked up at him.
“Got heartburn Potter?” The quip came out almost before he could stop it. The man looked up at him and shook his head, letting his hand drop to his side before retreating out of Draco’s vision. Draco heard him settle on one of the couches in the commons and figured he wouldn’t be alone anymore for the rest of the evening. He considered leaving, but decided against it. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him. It felt weird, like he was being scrutinized. Watched under a microscope. He couldn’t help but wonder what those eyes would look like staring into the fire.
Draco let a small smile grace his face and that pretty, pretty blush returned to his sharp cheeks.
“Potter?” He looked up right into the face of a very confused Draco Malfoy.
No response.
Somehow, the blush deepened on his face.
---------------------
“Who’s killing themselves?”
“What is it then.”
Hagrid looked up at the two, then leaned back in his chair and stared into the fire. Wideye. The ferret had been drinking wideye for over a week now. That was not going to go well with a normal human body.
He left his room and walked down the hallway to the stairs that led to the small common area. It wasn’t as nice as the Gryffindor commons but he was almost glad of that. No house colors to feel pride for, no competition. Just students living and doing their best to survive their last school year. None of the 8
He just stood there. Staring into the fire for hours. Sure, it probably wasn’t good for his eyes, but when he was left alone with his demons, this was the only thing that stopped him from simply ending it all. But now, all he could think of was the brunet man sitting behind him somewhere. His heart ached. Why of all people, did he have to start longing for Harry Potter.
Harry shook his head and pointed to his book resting open on a side table, “I came to get my book.”
“Ey boy, drinking aint allowed for students.”
What was he supposed to do with this turn of events? He had to do something, anything. If he did nothing, Harry could die out here. Hypothermia was a bitch. He hung his head in defeat. But as he did so, a light caught the corner of his eye and he whipped his head back up. Of course. There was one person that would be able to help.
“HARRY”
He blinked, and the eyes blinked back as he slowly descended to this plane of Earth again.
“Harry!?” His voice was shrill.
He started, “That’s me”
“Well, I came down to, well, see you, and you were stuck in this trance or something, staring into the fire. I touched you and then you looked at me and then you collapsed.”
He glanced at Harry, who still had his eyes closed. The pain was evident in the scrunch of his eyebrows.
“…you're probably killing yourself.”
Draco turned around caught his eye. He looked solemn.
How had he managed to offend him so badly?
“The war didn’t just effect you; you know.”
He wiped his face a few more times before managing to get his emotions back in check. He turned back to the book in his hand, knowing that he would never be able to concentrate.
Draco smiled softly, “Dimsy is a special elf. She is the only one that isn’t afraid of me.”
Draco stared at him incredulously, he really was daft! He was sitting here apologizing for something he most likely couldn’t control. He opened his mouth to speak but Harry held up a hand with a sheepish look on his face.
“What, what did I do? What did I say? Draco…?”
No, the answer was no, and he stood by the fire until he thought his legs were stone because no, he didn’t care. He didn’t care about anything. The only thing he felt was the flame. The harsh heat of the fire he stared into for hours on end. How could he not? It was fire, deadly and dangerous and the most beautiful… no. Not the most beautiful. Nothing could be more breathtaking than that vibrant green. Those eyes, with the deep navy rim, no, nothing would ever move him as much as the sight of those eyes. Ok, maybe he was dramatic.
“What?”
Draco laughed a breathy laugh. Smiling.
Hagrid turned towards him.
Harry blew out a puff of air.
Draco froze.
Draco:
“I need it. The nightmares…” he shuddered, “I wouldn’t be able to sleep anyways, I’m just saving myself the pain.”
The eyes widened.
“No, please, I get it.” He moved his hand to the back of his neck in a move that was ridiculously endearing. “No one wants me to apologize. But I know I made you uncomfortable last night before everything, I know that there is probably no way for us to ever be friends, but I guess I was stupid enough to try and I hurt you and Im sorry.” His form drooped, “Im sorry you had to see me like that, Hagrid said you were a bit shocked.” Harry closed his eyes and Draco frowned deeper.
They did this for a couple of days. Draco would stand by the fire until Harry walked down the stairs and then he would join him on the couch. Sometimes Harry would read and sometimes he would doze, and if Draco was very lucky, Harry would read out loud. His deep voice echoed in the meaning of poetry Draco didn’t understand. He would sit there on the couch, shoulder to shoulder with Harry and listen to his honey voice. It almost made him want to fall asleep. Almost.
Harry looked up at him, “You don’t need that.” His tone was firm and there was a glint of determination in his eyes.
He took a sip of the cup of tea. Damn. It was perfect. He’d never had a better cup of tea. Of course.
Draco looked at him and then looked away quickly, “Ah, um, never mind, it’s not important.”
He moved from the fireplace and followed the other man through the door to the main part of the castle.
Draco:
He wished he had it in him to comment. Of course, Harry liked his tea sweet. The man was practically starved for sweet. Personally, he liked his tea bitter. He liked the bite, and the weird aftertaste. He handed the cup over to the man sitting in front of him, a small hope that he had made it right, and then poured his own.
How could one burn and drown at the same time?
Harry waited.
Draco met his eyes, even more startled.
“Your eyes.”
For the record, he knew this was self-destructive, but sitting here with Harry all night felt safe. Safe in a way he shouldn’t be allowed. He was sat on the couch back to the armrest staring at him. Harry hadn’t seemed to notice and was completely lost in his book. Draco couldn’t help stare. Harry had grown out his hair on top and had managed to not slaughter and undercut. Maybe he had gone and got it done. The hair on top was slightly curly, like he had stopped forcing a brush through it. He had also grown a lot. He filled out his t-shirts and put on muscle since the war.
He wasn’t watching where he was going, too caught up in his thoughts and his direction to really pay attention and nearly ran over the blond standing in front of the fireplace.
Draco:
Hagrid scratched his head, “Wonder what set it off this time.”
Harry fell quiet again as Draco eyed him.
How could one interaction with Draco set this off.
“Draco please, you don’t need it.”
“Uh, I don’t actually know.”
“Please Hagrid, its Harry. I’m afraid…” He trailed off and then turned around and started running in the opposite direction.
He stumbled to his knees, legs giving out. He gasped staring up at the night sky. The dawn was soon coming, but here he was, alone in the dark. The open world was almost worse than the silent walls of his room.
Draco showed no emotion, he didn’t know how to react.
Draco:
NO ONE POV:
Draco smiled, “Why did you kiss me.”
For a moment, Draco stared into those green, unblinking eyes in fear. He was caught. But then something changed. His heart started hammering and he felt the cliff edge cracking.
The question was petty, he knew that but honestly, he thought he had been so obvious about his feelings for the other.
Hagrid turned a bit, “Come.”
“I know people are afraid of me. I know what I did.” Draco clasped his hands, “I did what I felt I had to do to survive.” Harry opened his mouth to respond, but Draco continued.
Harry was stumbling, searching for something, rushing. Going so fast Draco had to practically run to keep up with him. He was out of breath but something in him pushed him to go faster. To try harder. He had to catch up to Harry, Merlin knows why. He watched Harry stumble out the doors and he felt the rush of cold air blow by him. Neither of them were dressed for this temperature. It was almost winter. He shivered. What on earth was Harry doing?
Since when did Harry Potter call him Draco?
He paused for a second, the black-haired man in front of him was not hearing him at all. And heading straight towards the forbidden forest. And muttering something about water? He wrapped his arms around himself and rushed forward again. Faster. Faster. Faster.
Harry shook his head, “You won’t.”
“I will protect you. So, sleep with me.”
He looked up at the silent man standing in front of him. Of course, Draco would be sensitive about it. The last few years had been hell for him, just as much as it had been for Harry.
Harry:
And since when did he call him Harry?
Harry felt his arm reaching out to touch him when he heard the watery response.
His hands shook as he poured the tea into the cups provided. He gave a small nod when Harry, no, Potter, replied.
When was his last breath?
“Oh, ok.” Harry didn’t really know how to respond to that. He stepped around the boy leaning on the mantel of the fireplace and retrieved his book. He looked up at the slim figure Draco made in the firelight and felt his heart skip.
Harry stared up at him like he had grown a second head. “Yes Potter?” Harry’s cheeks blushed red. Oh, that was a sight he could get used too.
“Ai, lad what is it. Come inside!” He stepped aside but Draco shook his head frantically.
“Oh.”
Draco shuffled and leaned forward on his knees.
“Last night you said something, and well, I guess I wanted to know if it was true.”
“Fine.”
Hagrid grumbled under his breath at the unconscious Harry in his arms. “Again lad? What set yer off this time huh? Was it the blond ferret boy?” He shook his head; this was the fifth time this month Harry had suffered one of these panic attacks. He shoved open the door to his house with his shoulder and pushed past Fang who was quietly snuffling. He laid Harry down on the bed and turned to get him a warm rag for his forehead.
Draco was lost in thought, deep enough to not notice the man walking down the stairs. Didn’t notice him stand beside him at the fireplace, and didn’t notice the stunning smile sent to Sir. Plenty on the mantle. But he wasn’t dense enough to not notice the soft hand on his shoulder. His head moved and then, there they were.
The blush burned harder and Draco curled into himself a bit more.
“You and I, well, I don’t know if we were ever destined to be friends.”
Questions swirled through his head as the man walked past him to retrieve his book. He stared into the flames and tried to avoid watching him walk. He heard a small gasp and looked up only to see Potter standing with his hand over his heart with a look of intense pain on his face. Was he hurt?
Harry knew he was moving too fast, but the vulnerability in Draco’s eyes had brought him here. Crouched over the smaller man, kissing him.
Draco stayed silent, so Harry kept talking.
Harry:
He had done it.
Draco smiled softly at the wonder in Harry’s face, he was happy. He was feeling things. A burn that even the fire couldn’t replace. The cliff edge he had fallen off of was not a cliff at all, it had been a prison, and now he could feel himself flying. How could the goofy man in his lap do that to him. Make him so free. He licked his lips. He wanted to kiss him again.
Fuck.
He felt higher than a kite. He wanted to pull the man next to him into a giant hug, but he knew he wasn’t allowed to do that. Just because Draco said that he wanted to be friends, didn’t exactly mean that they were. But honestly, any relationship with the man was better than none. So for now, he could be content with what he had. But if he was honest with himself, he would never be content until Draco was his. He pushed the selfish thought away and pulled out a book of poetry he had been trying to get through for the last few days. Muggle poetry was surely something weird. It lit a fire in him, making him feel things he couldn’t through magic. He had found his own way to ground himself. Being the center of the magic world his entire life made the wonder of it fade. It had its cracks and dirty places, but here, sitting next to Draco with the fire and his favorite literature, he could pretend his world was perfect, even if the illusion only lasted a few minutes.
Draco let his eyes close once more, blushing under the intense stare. Waiting, until he heard it.
He stumbled forward into the grass surrounding the castle. He had no specific direction but just kept walking. Maybe, if he walked long enough, he would hit the lake and lose himself in the deep water. He couldn’t see.
“What happened?”
His hearing came back first, then the feeling in his legs. And he gasped. His legs buckled and he felt strong arms around him. He felt, warm. He blinked the fuzzy from his head and realized he was sitting on the couch. He looked up and around until he met eyes with Harry.
Harry blurted it out.
“Yeah. I think so.”
Harry smiled the biggest he had yet. He slowly moved off Draco’s lap and gathered his things before extending a hand to Draco. Standing there in the firelight, flushed and hair mussed, he looked intimidating, and beautiful. Draco took his hand, and didn’t let go.
He bent over and shook the still figure. “HARRY!?” His voiced got louder.
“No.” A breath. “Please stop Harry.”
“Harry?” The words slipped out, laced with concern.
And that brought him back to the original problem. He couldn’t sleep. For the first time in his life, he didn’t even have Voldemort in his head to keep him company. He was completely alone with his own demons, and Merlin knows he couldn’t deal with them. So, he got up. He paced for about an hour before giving up on the thought of sleep. He looked around the small room for his book before realizing he had left it by the chair he’d occupied earlier that day in the lounge. He sighed and ran a hand over his face. Guess he would be taking a short field trip.
Hagrid stiffened, what had that blonde idiot done to Harry this time? He booked it out the door and followed the wispy figure of the Malfoy until he watched him drop to his knees in front of a dark mass on the ground. Hagrid groaned.
Harry liked his bottom lip, pulling it into his mouth for a moment before nodding, “Yeah” it came out as almost a whisper. Draco’s eyes widened and he forced himself to look away. Damn, he could stare into those eyes for the rest of his life. He heard a sharp pop and then a small falsetto voice.
Draco’s mind was a mess. Who knew that reading so much poetry could make you so romantic.
“It does to me Draco.”
Harry smiled, Oh man. If he thought he was doomed before, having that smile aimed at him sealed the deal. He blushed.
Harry was shocked. He did what? Moon eyes. Oh, now he remembered. He let a smile creep back on his face.
Harry felt tears welling up in his eyes. Wait what? He was crying? He brushed his hand across his face and wiped away the tears falling down his cheeks. He felt his nose start to get stuffy and he did everything in his power to not sniff. He knew that if he made a noise Draco would know exactly what was going on. And he didn’t need that. He didn’t want pity.
“Huh?”
“Draco, I just meant… agh, I don’t know what I meant. I’m sorry.” Draco ran his hand through his hair before kneeling in front of the table.
“Yeah. I think so.”
He drew back and watched a dopey expression come over harrys flushed face. He lifted the flask That was still in his hand to his lips only to have it grabbed from him.
He looked down at his hands holding the book. Oh yeah, he was in big trouble. Draco just barely consented to be friends and here he was admitting he thought he was the most beautiful man in the world.
“Draco, what part of ‘You’re so beautiful’ do you not understand?”
“No. Don’t apologize.”
“Sleep with me.”
“Why?”
Oh no oh no oh no ohonoohooononohoononononono.
Harry smiled a bit.
The words rang cold and crisp in his ears.
“But Harry, you already have a place in my heart, and there’s nothing you could do that would make you undeserving of that. “
