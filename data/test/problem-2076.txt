“Well, I don’t remember that, do I?  There’s something about him, though.  It’s like I can’t look away.”
“I make myself do it,” Draco said.  It was the first time that he’d really spoken about his compulsions, and he was surprised that Harry had noticed.  Then again, when had Harry
by her that I realize that, whatever’s happened in my life, this woman sees me as hers.  The husband, Arthur, is close behind her, a man who seems to be permanently bemused.  His eyes, so much like his son’s, are warm as they fix on me, and he shakes my hand, saying “Alright there, Harry?”
Harry sighed with relief.  “Thanks Dean.  I’m not trying to hide anything, but you know how they like to run with a story, and it’s not just my privacy at stake anymore.”
It seemed that taking stock didn’t provide Draco with any immediate solutions.  Well, regardless of how he was going to fix everything, leaving Harry in a pool of sticky beverage wasn’t going to solve anything.  With a sigh, Draco went to where Harry was snoring into the puddle and lifted his head.  He summoned a flannel, and washed the disgusting mixture from Harry’s face.  If he paused for a moment to smell the crook of his neck, where Harry most smelled of vanilla, and sunshine, and some sort of innate Harry-ness…well, nobody was watching, were they? Draco managed, just barely, to avoid licking that selfsame spot, and instead picked up the snoring Wizard.
been potioned, it would have been unconscionable to have taken advantage of that.  And if I’d told him the truth about how I felt while he was under the influence, he would have done everything in his power to win me over.”  Draco took another sip of his coffee.  “Merlin, that’s amazing.  Muggles are very clever when it comes to coffee.  Anyhow, obviously he doesn’t see it that way, and he can’t find it in himself to forgive me, but that’s something that I can’t change.  If he’s not willing to give me a chance to apologize, or to start over, or…well, if he’s not willing to give us a chance, then I suppose he didn’t really like me as much as he thought he did, and there’s nothing I can do about that either.”
He regards me for a very long time, searching my face for something.  Finally, he says, “Not weird bad.”  It isn’t much to go on, but it’s a start.
“You should have gotten clothes that fit you,” Scorpius said indignantly.  Harry was about to answer, but Scorpius continued, “Can you come to my party?  It’s Saturday.”
“Seven miscarriages.  Before Violet.  Seven desperately longed-for babies that I wasn’t able to carry to term.  Seven children that I lost, and grieved, and-”  Her words cut off in a bitter little sob.  Harry was filled with enormous compassion for the woman.
“Well, Healer, I’m a Malfoy.  I’ve been trained since birth to behave with decorum.  I’m afraid if you could see how I was feeling inside you’d be disappointed.  I’m devastated I that have to face this, but I appreciate the kind words”
Draco holds out his hands, palms up, as if to say, ‘what did you expect?’.  Blaise continues, “You know, we all thought that you were playing some sort of long, drawn-out game.  Otherwise, why would you keep him on the hook for so long?”
So it was no surprise that as the night progressed, it was him, Dean Thomas, Cho Chang (real dark horse, that girl) and Harry Potter still perched on stools around the island, while the rest of the party had left or passed out.  Harry still hadn’t spoken directly to Draco since their awkward  encounter when Harry had come home, but Dean and Cho were compensating for the tension by being extra friendly.  Draco was inventing a new drink with spiced rum and some Muggle lemon soda.  It was delicious, even if the strength of the mix resulted in Cho sicking into a plant and being taken to bed by a wobbly Dean.
“That’s what I’ve been standing here trying to sort out,” Harry answered.  “Draco, you know I’m crap at expressing myself, right?”  When Draco nodded stiffly, he continued, “Well, I can’t figure out if I just did a bad job of telling you how I feel, or if you did understand, and you’re angry with me.  Draco, would you look at me for a second?”
That night, whether it’s in poor taste or not, they go to a Muggle dance club, and under the flashing lights, with the bass thumping deep in their chests, they jump and writhe and Harry watches as the lights turn Draco’s white-blonde hair pink and blue and he thinks that might be alright.
“Of course, Master Draco.  And Master Draco was getting an owl this morning.  Kattie has put the papers on your desk.”
“Yeah,” Ron muttered.  “That’s why I don’t think it will work.  If you have any contacts in the potions industry who might know of someone dodgy, I’m all ears, but that’s going to take forever, and I don’t know what we’ll do to keep her away from Harry in the meantime.  She’s already getting suspicious about Harry’s ‘undercover mission’.  I had to get Kings to send her an owl today, telling her that Harry was away on his orders.  Still, it won’t hold her off forever.”
“Yeah.  Just some plans that fell through.”  I try to hide my disappointment, but her smile is sympathetic.
“You pointed out that you’d never been given physical affection as a child, and noted that Harry hadn’t either.  You mentioned that your adolescence was stilted by your inability to confront your sexual orientation.  I wonder if you worry that your attraction to Harry in his adult form will somehow create a compulsion to take advantage of him.  I wonder if your opinion that you ‘can’t be trusted’ somehow extends to your fear that if you touch him, that someone will interpret it incorrectly, or that you will truly do something reprehensible.”
Harry’s face broke into a wide smile, and he turned in the direction of the voice.  Hermione was elbowing her way through the crowd, intent on reaching them as efficiently as possible.  Behind her, Ron’s bright red hair was visible, trying in vain to make his way politely in their direction.
Scorpius nodded again, but remained stoically silent.  Stifling a grin, Harry said, “I understand that something happened in your class today.  One of your classmates got a little sting, and I’m sure that it was confusing and upsetting for everyone.  Do you know what happened?”  Scorpius nodded.  “Great, I’m so glad you can help.  Tell me what you saw,” Harry said encouragingly.
There had been another, less confusing but equally tragic moment on the first night, when Harry had awoken screaming again.  Draco had torn into the room, heart pounding.  Harry wasn’t properly awake, but was sobbing, “Sorry, sorry,”  Draco sat on the edge of the bed, uncertain whether to wake the child or not, but, after arguing with his unresponsive arm for a few minutes, had managed to awkwardly rub Harry’s back.  Harry had stilled for a moment, gone silent, and blinked sleepy eyes up at Draco.
This morning, he was roused, not by his usual alarm spell, but by an urgent little voice in his ear saying, “Papa.”  His eyes flew open, and he stared, a little blearily, at his four-year-old son.
“In a strop?” Draco was coldly incredulous.  “In a str-Astoria, I have a daughter!  A daughter who has been living Merlin-knows-where, and I’ve only just learned that she existed today.  I’m in more than a bloody strop!”  Cass was watching him very closely again, her eyes narrowed.
“Alright.”  Draco’s heart thudded swiftly in his chest.  He could feel a pleased little smile curling his lips.  Slow.  Take it slow.
When they were settled with tea, Draco looked out the window into the back garden.  A pair of house sparrows were hopping about in one of the flowerbeds.  One of them flew into a hedge, and the other quickly followed.  As a third sparrow joined them the original two reacted with fury, and flew at the interloper, who quickly returned from whence it came.  The pair flew back into the dirt, and one took a dust bath while the other watched, alert, for predators.
So Harry did.  “The first thing you need to know, is that Draco and I were enemies the whole time we were at school.  We were two sides of the same coin.  Both of us had adults telling us what to think, and the older we got, the higher the stakes were.  It was an awful time, kiddo, and neither Draco nor I had the maturity or the support to deal with it.  It’s a lot more complicated than that, and someday I’ll tell you more, but for now, all you need to know is that Draco and I were set up to hate one another.”
“I’m fi-” he huffed in frustration, gave her a look, and finally, quietly, to his chest, said, “I’m struggling because…” He huffed another breath and said, “I’m struggling because I’m not comfortable without receiving validation when I do something difficult.”
sexual tension?”  They look at me a bit strangely, and I say, “Did you not know anyone else who fought like cats and dogs and it turned out that they just really, really wanted to shag?”  They exchange a bit of a look at that, and I inwardly applaud myself for guessing right.  These two are chalk and cheese, and her being as bossy as she is, and him with that temper, there’s no way that they weren’t a living example of the same bloody thing.
“No,” I laugh, “You don’t understand.  I have absolutely no skills, other than being someone that people like to stare at.  I don’t want payment.  Well, I wouldn’t turn down free ice cream, but I’m very lucky that my parents were able to provide me with some financial stability that allows me a bit of freedom.  And you’ve been so welcoming.  I’m happy when I’m here.  I doubt I'll be any good at this, but people will certainly come to look at me, and they'll buy ice cream while they do.  I’d also like for you to hire some more reliable help as well.”
“You don’t know what you’re saying,” Weasley said with a moan.  “Hermione is going to have questions, hundreds of them.  And then we’re going to have a fight.  And only then will she help me come up with a story before she disappears into a library to do research.  I don’t have time for all of that.”
“Alright.”  Harry was pleased with how rational he sounded.  He also thought he deserved particular praise for not falling to the floor and begging Draco not to take his daughter away.
“Yep.  All yours, little duck.  Your grandfather and his friends would be pleased that the newest little Marauder will wreak havoc through the halls of Hogwarts.  One thing though?  Don’t let Auntie Min know that I gave it to you.”
Things happen very quickly after that, and before I know it, we’re standing in a stone room with symbols etched onto the floor.  There’s a golden chalice, wrapped in Scorpius’ baby blanket sitting atop the symbol in the centre.  I spare a moment to observe, a little pettily, that we
Draco tensed.  He hadn’t seen or spoken to any of the members of the golden trio in years.  He and Granger (
“Cassiopeia Narcissa Potter, I love you with every single fibre of my being.  I can truly say that each decision I’ve made since I learned that you existed has been made with your welfare in mind.  There is nothing that I wouldn’t sacrifice for you, and no matter what happens in the future, I will love you ceaselessly, for every moment of the rest of my life.”
“I don’t know, Hermione!  It’s not like when she was little, and she’d go off to the fort when she wanted to be secretive.”
“I think I know,” Hermione says, and her expression is furious…and guilty.  “He’s in the Department of Mysteries.  It’s the only place he could be.”
been on watching Draco.  Probably the first time in his life that he and Draco had shared a room and Harry hadn’t been obsessed with what he was up to, he admitted to himself.
She isn’t ready to be touched, so Harry just stands there, as her breath comes fast and harsh.  Finally, she says, “It was over, Harry.  We won, and it was over, and we were going to get to move on.  We were going to stop
I nod, giving him a beaming smile.  “That’s exactly why I’ve realized it doesn’t matter much, what I do.  They’ll spin it in whatever direction will sell the most copies, so it’s a license to do as I like.”  He frowns, and I hasten to add, “Provided it’s legal, of course.”
“What’s that?” Draco wondered, taking a sip of the excellent coffee he’d bought at the Muggle shop with the unrealistically beautiful mermaid on its sign.
The following morning, Draco awoke to raised voices, and raced out of his room, wand in the air, and terror in his belly.  He was surprised to find Kreacher and Harry engaged in a spirited standoff in the kitchen.  “It isn’t proper, Master Harry,” Kreacher was begging, his gravelly voice betraying his discomfort.
Harry could have sworn that Draco looked relieved.  “Oh, yes, that’s fine.  Good.”  He looked uncertain for a moment, and then took a breath, and said, “Better than good.  I’d…hoped…that we could get to know one another again.  I meant what I said last night.  I don’t think I ever got over you.”
“No, I suppose that’s true”  It was a mistake to come home, Draco realized.  Too much time had passed, and he didn’t think that he’d be able to bridge the enormous gap that had formed.  “I am sorry, Pans.  You know I couldn’t stay”
“Have I?”  This guy clearly doesn’t know I’ve lost my memories, so as long as I play along, I’m sure it will be fine.  What could possibly go wrong?
“I’m glad to hear it.  I wanted to thank you for doing this.  I’ve seen such an increase in Amy’s confidence since she’s been coming here.  She was a bit timid before.”
The minute I lay down, the room starts to spin, and I’m panicking that I’m going to throw up in Draco’s bed, after being specifically instructed not to.  He’s back by my side right away though, and hands me a vial with a bright pink liquid inside.  “Drink this, Harry.”
“Sorry,” I say, but I’m smirking.  “Got distracted.”  I’m intrigued to see that he’s panting, the heavy breaths causing his chest to rise and fall beneath his jumper.  My eye, inexorably, travels down to his crotch, where I confirm the evidence that he’s not unaffected by my little fantasy.
“I wasn’t sure if I should.  Minerva said you were happy where you were, and we considered leaving well enough alone, but it felt too big to make the decision for you.”
“Okay, well, I guess the first thing that you need to know is that this information is about your Papa, your other biological father.”
“No it isn’t,” Harry said.  “If I had a Mother like yours, I’d do anything in the world to protect her.”  He gave Draco a cheerful little smile, and went back to his toast, watching Draco from under his long lashes.
“No.  It isn’t.  But you and I have been together a long time.  When we first got together, in school, you were never interested in anything physical.  I thought that you were just immature, or maybe just stressed because of the war.  But then,” she says, and she’s playing with her hair again, “afterwards, when we got back together, you still didn’t want to.  I have to be the instigator, every time.”
Kreacher looked gobsmacked.  In order to forestall a vigorous bout of self-punishment, Draco said hastily, “Thank you Kreacher, we’re fine.  No need to punish yourself, just go back to Grimmauld for a bit.  Get things tidied up for Master Harry when he returns.”
“Harry,” Lara said simply, and Draco inhaled a gulp of the hot beverage.  When he’d finished coughing, and cleaned the front of his robes, she smiled at him.  “Sorry about that.  You were hoping that we’d never bring him up again, weren't you?”
Draco hums his acceptance and returns to his work.  Potter watches him intently, his eyes bright and green, a half-smile curving his lips.   He wears his hair longer on top now, closely cropped on the sides.  It suits him, suits him better than Draco wants to admit, but Draco misses the chaotic mess that it was in his youth. “Did you listen to the Quidditch on the wireless last night?”
“Harry," Miriam smiled at him, and the kindness of her eyes, and the gentleness of her face was too much.  He looked away, ashamed.  She placed two fingers on his wrist.  "I think that you’ve been keeping it together for a long time now, and your mind and your body are telling you that you need to take care of yourself.  I’ve met Cass, she’s wonderful.  You’re doing a great job, and I’m certain that, very soon, you’ll be back to continue where you left off.”
I find my way to my desk after a confusing wander of a floor that seems to contain nothing but identical offices, and when I finally arrive in the Auror pod, Mill is sitting in the desk opposite mine.  “Hey!”  I’m glad to see her.  I want to ask her whether I actually like my job or not.  When she looks up, her eyes are red rimmed.  “Mill?  You okay?”
Draco has had enough.  He’s nearly undone, with Potter’s constant visits, with the tiny, stupid bolt of hope that ratchets through his body every time Potter flirts with him.  With the ridiculous notion that Potter might be serious before Draco realizes that of course he isn’t.  With the embarrassment of the intensity that he wishes that Potter
Draco doesn’t push him for more details, and more importantly, whatever pity he feels for Harry isn’t acknowledged.  He just says, “I can see why it would be hard to expose yourself after being independent for so long.  And I know what it’s like to feel like it isn’t safe to be vulnerable around anyone else.”  Draco looks at him from under his fringe.  His eyes are pretty, Harry notices absently.  “You know all of the worst things I’ve ever done, and we’ve still ended up as friends despite it all.  If you ever did feel like you wanted someone to talk to, really talk to, I…”. His glance falters and he flushes before he says, “I could be that person.  No pressure or anything, but no judgement.”
Kreacher stalks off to sulkily bang pots and pans in the kitchen.  “Dinner won’t be long,” I say.  “Want to sit?”
Kreacher gives me a sly look.  “Master Malfoy is the daughter of Narcissa, and is the last remaining relative in the Black bloodline.  Were it not for the filthy traitor, Master Malfoy would have been inheriting Grimmauld Place and the Black family fortune.”
“Sure Draco, of course you will.  But you don’t have to be alone tonight.  Come upstairs, Merlin knows it’s already late.  Catch a few hours of sleep next to someone who once meant something to you.”
“Thank you darling.  But please, listen to me.  You need to talk.  You need to be honest with him about your feelings.”
There’s a couple more pictures in the album.  A startlingly poignant one of Hermione, perched on a huge rock, beside a lake, a thick book open on her lap.  She looks up and smiles, but goes immediately back to her reading.
“The timing isn’t great, but I figured you’d rather see, mate.”  He reaches into the pocket of his robes, and pulls out a shrunken newspaper, which he returns to normal size and passes to me.
Turns out that this is a tiny little chapter, so I'm posting two today, that way you won't feel cheated.  Happy Sunday and thanks for reading.
It was July, almost two years after they’d started dating, when Harry had begun feeling strange.  Not ill, exactly, just…weak.  His magic had begun acting funny, affecting the way that the wand wood reacted to him.  And he was exhausted, all the time.  He had dismissed it as a reaction to the heatwave that had struck, at first.  Garrick had looked concerned, told him that he should have it checked.  Once Draco and Hermione had also joined the chorus of persistent concern, Harry had made an appointment with Madame Pomphrey, who had continued treating Harry after the war.
I half-heartedly consider coming on to him, but I’m tired still, and he looks exhausted, so I just snuggle into the curl of his arms and lie there, languishing in how warm he is, and how comforting he smells.
The owl returned more quickly than Draco would have imagined.  Harry likely wrote his response the moment he got Draco’s.  Anticipation roiling in his chest, Draco felt weak as he unwrapped the parchment.
“No, probably not.  I think that Draco was sort of like an asteroid.  When you’re sitting there, looking up at the night sky, and suddenly you see this brilliant shooting star, it’s wonderful, you know?  And you feel so lucky to have seen it, like it’s a special gift from the heavens, just for you.  And it burns out quickly, of course, and it’s gone, but you don’t feel sad that it’s over, you focus on how amazing it was while you saw it.”
“Myrtle’s bathroom.” My voice is slurred, but I’ve clearly remembered right, because she starts to sob.  Ron, who has appeared in my field of vision, pulls her into his chest, and she winds around him like a vine.
I shake my head.  “No, of course you wouldn’t,” Narcissa says.  “The story of the Enchanted Ring tells of a Wizard who has accomplished much, but is always searching for more.  He is restless, unable to settle, and travels the world in search of more learnings, more treasure.  Deep in a hidden cave, he finds a ring, guarded by a spectre.  The spectre warns him that the ring will bring true enlightenment, but that it will be fleeting, that wixenkind is not meant for such knowledge.  The Wizard thinks carefully, but the lure of the ring is too great.  The spectre weeps, begs the Wizard to consider what will be lost but the Wizard places the ring upon his finger.  For a moment, he is filled with all of the knowledge of the universe, but, the knowledge is too much for him, and his spirit breaks free from his body, which crumbles into dust.  His spirit moves to the nearest living thing, which is a yew tree, where he stays for eternity, knowing everything, but unable to do anything with it.”
“Mr. Harry, will you come home with us?” Scorpius asked.  “Just to make sure things are okay?  My dragon is calmer when you’re with me.”
Purebloods.  That sounds astonishingly unfair.  Are you the sole arbiter of which Purebloods are the good ones?”  I look at a framed campaign poster that adorns his wall.  It proudly proclaims, ‘Unity is Might’.   His gaze follows mine, and I feel a small sense of satisfaction that he quells, just a little.
Papa helped her to start up the laptop, and navigate to the email.  “I’ll just leave you to read your email in private,” he said, and Cass looked carefully at him.  She could feel a prickle in her forehead that meant she’d scrunched her eyebrows together into her thinking face.  Papa was uncomfortable.  Something had happened, something between her fathers.
It was still late summer, but the wind carried a bite.  Harry pulled his collar up around his neck, and walked a little faster, but by the time he reached the school, his nose was red and he was sniffling. He entered through the front doors, and popped his head into the office.  Sarah, the school secretary, smiled in greeting.  “Hi Harry!  Isn’t this weather ridiculous?”
“You know that I don’t like it when you look at my thoughts. I know that you feel like I keep things to myself, and I respect your opinion, but this isn’t the way to get me to open up more.  Imagine if I read your diary without permission, and then told your family something private.  I was embarrassed as well, Cass.  Listen to me carefully, sweetheart,” Harry said, putting his arm around his daughter, and bringing his face in closer to hers.  “I know that you’re absolutely convinced that what you’re doing is okay, because you’re doing it for the right reasons.  And I love that you care so much about me, I do.  But you have to trust me on this.  It isn’t right to read someone’s thoughts without their permission.  And, it hurts my feelings especially, because, growing up, I had a lot of people who allowed me to be put in danger, and hurt because they felt that there was a really good reason for it.  It makes me feel like I don’t matter, like my wishes aren’t important.”
“Alright.  I studied with the Doctor who’s running the trial.  I can have his file and bloodwork sent over today, and get you an answer quite soon.  If he’s approved, though, the process to gain Ministry approval can take quite a while.  They seem to be chronically understaffed in that Department.”
After the hangover potions, they’re beginning to feel almost human again.  Kreacher presses eggs and toast on them, and they manage to eat a little, companionably drinking tea and watching home decorating shows on the telly.
He chose a nearby Wizard restaurant, and when they were seated, and had ordered drinks, he regarded Harry across the table.  “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you,” Draco said.  “You look good.  Healthy.”
And so he did.  He fell through the floo, frightening a House Elf, who gasped, and then fetched his Mother.  She appeared in the floo room with a concerned expression on her face.  “Darling,” she said softly, “what’s happened?”
“Thanks.  I’m thrilled for me too.  How have you been?  It’s been ages since we caught up.  How’s Ron, and the rest of his family?”
“Oh,” Harry said, noticing Draco’s tears.  “Oh.  Oh, Draco, here.  You can have my dog.”  Draco laughed wetly, which prompted him to start crying in earnest.  Harry nudged Hank over towards Draco, and the dog leaned his length against Draco’s leg.
“Yes, of course I know.  Go, Harry, before the Greengrass family comes with shotguns.  We’ll owl you when the heat dies down.  I love you too.  Go.  Be happy.”
Draco’s breath was coming in frantic gasps, and his skin crawled.  But the baby continued crying, and pulling at Draco’s arms.  Before he knew what was happening, Harry had somehow managed to insinuate himself against Draco’s chest.  His wails stopped after a while, and only the occasional shuddering breath gave any indication of his earlier upset.   Soon, Potter fell asleep, a busy day of lab destruction, de-aging, and tormenting Draco, rounded out by a bout of hysterical crying, having taken its toll.  Draco quickly transfigured a stool into a bassinet, and popped the baby inside, grateful for an opportunity to address the destruction within his lab.  The moment his back touched the bassinet, Potter’s eyes flew open, and his lower lip trembled.
“Because I wasn’t nice to you before.  And maybe I’d like to know the Draco who’d be nice to me back.”
“Harry, please.  Can we go to your place?  To talk?”  I’m about to say no, but I hesitate.  I’ve been watching for an owl from him for days, even as I was telling myself I didn’t care.  He isn’t looking at me; his feet are obviously fascinating.  He looks vulnerable.  There’s no future for us, but I wonder if there will be some sort of satisfaction in confronting him.  I just want to know why he thought it was okay.  Did he think that I’m the sort of person who’d enjoy being a bit on the side?  Even though I’m a bit nervous about being alone with him, I finally nod, but he’s still not looking at me.
came back.  In fact, he’d never really left her, not in all the years she’d been alive.  So she wasn’t sure  why her instincts were alert, watching for something undefinable.  For the first few days after the strange thought came to her, she dismissed it as nothing, but something about the way her Dad’s jaw was set when he said goodbye made her uneasy.
“I am looking out for my family,” Andromeda snapped.  “Don’t forget, Draco, the Black family, your family, wanted nothing to do with me when I became a Blood Traitor.  Harry is my family.  And I will keep him safe at any cost.”  She leaned in very close to Draco’s face, and her black eyes were so devoid of warmth that Draco shuddered.  “You might recall that my little sister Bella had a rather creative approach to protecting her interests.  You should know that I taught her many of the things she knew.”
As Harry stood to leave, Draco had grabbed his arm.  “Wait.  Do you really think that?  Is that how you think I see you?”
“Hello.”  Harry didn’t know how to begin his apology, so he decided to just let her have a go at him first.
“But Harry, that doesn’t make any sense.” Draco felt his frustration rising.  “This isn’t how it was supposed to end at all.”
“Where do you want to go next?” Draco asked, once Scorpius’ broom had been wrapped up and they were again in the Alley.  Scorpius was dragging his mother in the direction of the Magical Menagerie, and Draco knew that they’d be there until his son’s fatigue ended the outing.
Harry still slept in a tight little ball, Draco noticed, but he’d kicked his duvet off and so Draco took a step into the room.  Harry seemed more vulnerable in sleep, his eyes moving rapidly below the lids, his mouth moving soundlessly.  Draco pulled the duvet back over the sleeping boy, and allowed himself the luxury of brushing Harry’s messy curls off his forehead.  Harry sighed in his sleep and leaned into the touch.  A part of Draco wanted to stay, to watch Harry sleep, to keep him safe through the night, but eventually, he managed to persuade his unwilling legs to carry him to his own bedroom, where he eventually drifted off into fitful slumber.
“Whether something else is at play that makes him think he wants Ginny.  You suspect an attraction potion?”
“He was a member of your Order of the Phoenix, Harry.  You fought next to him in the war.  It’s only natural that you’d want to believe him.  And then, more recently, you came to me, said that you wanted to help.  We’ve been investigating the Auror office and the Probation and Rehabilitation office in secret.”
Laying a ghost of a kiss on Harry’s lips, Draco extricated himself from the covers, stood in the doorway watching the only person he’d ever loved, and then, finally, stole down the stairs and out the door.
, my brain supplies joyfully, and I desperately, furiously, command it to shut UP about the fucking horses. He’s…hopeful, or something, though, and I sense there’s a part of him that sort of wants to believe that I’m not making fun of him.  But it’s clearly a huge gamble.  I calmly look him straight in the eyes, and wait for his answer.
“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured, removing his hand and standing up.  Perhaps it was better for him to just leave.  He’d obviously caused enough damage, to Harry’s heart, and, it seemed, his liver.
“Until you got in a giant strop one day and your accidental magic went after the lot of them!”  Ron seems delighted at the memory.  “They’ve left you alone since then, unless you do something really noteworthy, like shag a Malfoy, but I imagine that if you took this to them, they’d ignore the bigger stuff and instead write something about how you’re a conspiracy-theoried nutter.”
“Well, it only makes sense,” Wendell says.  “Bad blood will out.”  For some unfathomable reason, this sentence fills me with unsurmountable rage, but Ron catches a look at my face, and places a restraining hand on my arm.
“Listen,” I say softly, trying to diffuse the situation, but all the time I’m thinking that I’m going to go truly mad if I stay in this insane society.  “I appreciate that you’re trying to help me, I really do.  But you can’t just expect me to supplant my own thoughts with your opinion, right?”
“If you like.  Grand-Père isn’t well.  He sometimes gets confused, or upset.  It might even cause him, in his confusion, to say something unkind to you.  If you think that it will upset you to see him, I’ll ask Grand-Mère to make sure he stays away.”
“I intend to claim her as a Malfoy.”  Harry thought that the words had an ominous ring, and he resolved again to make sure he spoke to a lawyer.  If he were lucky, he’d be able to come see Cass on vacations, he thought, without much hope.
“Partly, yes. I never wanted you to be part of the spectacle.  I hated the amount of attention I got, especially since it was for no good reason.”
Unexpectedly, she grins.  “Well, Draco Malfoy gave you a weird feeling every single year at Hogwarts, and look where you are now.”
“Yeah, we aren’t going to make the playoffs anyhow, and they understand family.  They know that I need to be here with you.”
It’s just nearing dinnertime, and so the pub’s mostly empty.  I sit at the bar, and a woman who looks around my own age smiles in greeting.  She’s pleasant looking, with an open, cheerful face, and wide-set blue eyes.  Her hair is plaited down her back.  “Hi Harry!”
He looks up from his bookings list, and I see that he recognizes me. “Mister Potter, sir.  Of course you’re not an…my goodness, it’s wonderful to see you here!”
They groaned good-naturedly, and sent him a suggestive leer as they stared interestedly at Harry.  Draco didn’t bother to introduce them.  Not until he knew why Harry was here.
“Do you regret it?”  The question was stark, and it took Harry aback for a moment.  It shouldn’t have, really.  He’d asked it enough of himself, when he was half-starved on the Horcrux hunt, or attending one of the endless funerals after the war, or when the press was lambasting him for what they saw as one of his transgressions.
“Oh, Cass, yes.  I loved him more than I loved myself, and for a spoiled brat like me, that’s a lot.  For a while, once we started dating, things were good.  We were hidden away from the world, in Harry’s Godfather’s house.  While we were insulated like that, it was perfect.  But life doesn’t allow you to stay hidden away forever.  Harry wanted to tell the world that we were together.  He’s not afraid of anything, you know?  He didn’t care what the consequences were.  But I’d watched the newspapers, and the stupid people in our society rip him apart for one thing or another since he was eleven years old.  I knew that they wouldn’t stand for their Hero consorting with a Death Eater.”
The Department of Magical-Muggle Relations was located on the fifth floor of the Ministry.  Scorpius looked wide-eyed at the memos swooping through the corridors as he clung to Draco’s hand and skipped along beside him.  The door to the Department Head was guarded by a stern looking older woman who peered over her glasses at the two of them.  “Do you have an appointment?”
So, it was a shrieking baby, and a sweaty, puce-faced Draco, that met Weasley and Granger when, promptly at seven, they exited the floo.  “Harry!” Granger cried, and crossed the room swiftly.  As she attempted to pick him up, she discovered the sticking charm, and she raised an eyebrow in Draco’s direction.  He was about to explain himself, but she merely said, “That’s brilliant.  I’d never have thought of that,” before cancelling the spell and retrieving Potter.  Potter, the disloyal little shit, burrowed his filthy face into her robes and immediately stopped crying, furthering the insult by opening his mouth like an obedient baby bird when Granger took over.
“I think we’re reaching the outer edges of how many times the Obliviators are willing to intervene,” Harry replied, his voice gentle.
“Yes, I think the last time we spoke I was in your basement.  I got your owl though, afterwards.  Thank you for sending it.  And thank you for taking such good care of me while I was staying with you.”
“Nah, not my style, really.”  Harry grinned at Draco, and for a moment, the breath caught in Draco’s throat.  He was so beautiful.
“I suppose because I wasn’t aware that I was in his way,” Draco replied.  “It does seem surprising that Harry wouldn’t have mentioned it to me.”
“The fu—-ah....” Harry said, realizing at the last moment that Hugo, who had taken to parroting his every word was listening avidly to their conversation.  “That’s very wrong of her, indeed,” he said with a knowing frown.
“But how do you know?” Harry asks, feeling the familiar pull of a problem to solve, someone to help.
The girls all started yelling body parts, and when they were done, Harry grinned, “Well done.  We’re going to punch in the throat, or the nose.  We’re going to poke eyes.  We’re going to kick knees, shins, or places that are normally covered by underwear!”  This prompted hysterical giggles from the girls, and Harry blushed.  “I know, it’s funny, but we want to hurt them, surprise them, make them let go.”
“Three weeks?  If you don’t take it, we’ll have to find someone else who’s suitable, and time isn’t on our side.  But Harry, there’s
by this.  I will never be the same.”  He takes a step towards the door.  “Is that what you wanted to know?”
“No, I wouldn’t imagine so.  I think that quite a lot of the time, you wear battling wear.  Dragonhide pants, spellproof vest, that sort of thing.  These are used for when you have meetings, to be in court, or at ceremonies.”
“Well, not eliminate,” he said, ill-at-ease, “but this does help you to resist it.  I’m glad that it does.”
Harry’s face turned panicky at the idea that he’d be further away from the room where his daughter slept.  “No, thanks.  I think I’ll just stay here.”
This time, his tears were a lot more plentiful, and he wept into Hank’s back for several minutes, his shoulders shaking and his pain so tangible that Draco felt tears sliding down his own cheeks.  He stayed where he was, uncomfortably perched on the edge of the sofa, desperate to reach out and take Harry into his arms, but a glance at Miriam warned him not to interfere.  He clenched his fists, feeling his nails biting into the skin of his palms.
She winks at me, and I ease my way into the crowd.  It’s a sea of bodies, and I allow myself to be tossed along through the throng.  I get groped a few times, and I’m pleasantly half-hard by the time I find a little pocket of space.  The music is Muggle, complete with thumping beat, and it isn’t long before I’m gyrating along with everyone else, my drink gone and the glass banished to the bar.  The alcohol has made me feel sort of floaty, and I lose myself in the sensation of heat, and close contact with bodies that are a bit dewy with exertion.  Despite my carefully controlled attempts to avoid doing so, I cast a quick look around the club, seeking out the distinctive white-blond hair, and I can’t decide if I’m relieved or disappointed when I don’t see him.
Draco smiled.  “Well, yes, among other reasons." His eyes on Harry were warm, which was confusing.  "I’ve always regretted the way our relationship ended, Harry, and I’d hoped that we could use this as a chance to get back on friendlier terms.”
She grins.  “You’d think so.  This is my parent’s shop.  I’m the eighth generation of Fortesque to work here.”
“I know that it’s terminal, that you’re managing her pain and comfort levels.  I know that it would be…imprudent...to hope for a cure.”
“Salazar, Potter, does she even have a parent?”  The words escaped Draco’s mouth before he could stop them.  He was completely unnerved by this new, mature Potter, who didn’t rise to his bait, who seemed to care so little about Draco that he practically ignored him.  But, he reasoned, Potter didn’t care about Draco, obviously, since he was able to walk away and start a new life, without a backward glance.
“Is that so?” Hermione said, and Harry could hear the frustration in her voice.  This was something she’d been carefully not saying for a while.  “I have no idea?  Honestly, Harry, anyone who’s got a set of eyes knows that you project yourself into every kid you meet, desperate to give them the childhood you didn’t get.”  She suddenly went silent, and Harry could tell that she’d not meant to go quite that far.
Draco smiled as he put the wordy parchment aside.  Hermione wrote exactly as she spoke, and it was lovely to imagine her voice.  He couldn’t help but marvel that he’d grown to like her so much.  If his eleven-year-old self could see him, he’d be mortified, but twenty-two year old Draco was proud that such a smart, kind girl could see good in him.  He still worried about screwing things up, and having her realize how unworthy he was of her friendship, but he resolved to enjoy it as long as it lasted.
Harry’s cheeks flamed, and he seemed a little overwhelmed.  “What first?” Draco asked.  “We could have tea, or I could show you around inside, or we could look at the gardens.”
Papa smiled.  “Yes, I have two jobs.  Three, if you count being a Father, I suppose.  I’m fortunate that I can do most of my work from my office here.  Primarily, I manage the Malfoy holdings, which are a bit complicated, and take up a lot of my attention.  I’m formally trained as a cursebreaker, and so from time to time, I take on projects, either from Gringotts, or from families who have cursed objects.”
“Merlin,” Harry gasped into his mouth, and before Draco knew what was happening, Harry’s hand was on his cock, and the pressure there, along with his tongue in Draco’s mouth made Draco whimper.
“There was a bit of damage to the building,” Harry said, exchanging a glance with Draco that suggested that ‘a bit’ meant ‘quite a lot, really’.  “I’m sure that the response team has fixed that all up now.  The more important part is that Scorpius’ magic responded so violently that he is now suffering from magical exhaustion, and that, because of some flying glass, he was injured.  It’s not Scorpius’ fault, and fortunately, he’ll easily get better soon, but it’s a little dangerous that his magic is so…spirited.”
Weasley rolled his eyes.  “Figures you’re the one he’d finally find his manners for.  Anyhow, looks like you’re sorted.  I’ll pop by with Hermione later.”
He stands in that spot, his memories of a younger, more hopeful self bright in his mind.  He remembers how he was relieved, that, if nothing else, it was going to be
The parchment attached to the owl’s leg contained just a few lines, but Harry’s instinct pinged a little.  Having learned over the years, that instincts were fine and good, but worrying about them would solve nothing, he scribbled a few lines onto a fresh parchment, affixed it to the owl’s leg, and sent it on its way.
“She doesn’t have one.”  This prompted a few murmurs, and Harry steeled himself for what would happen next.
Harry beamed, and then Draco’s mouth, free of any intervention from his brain, said, “Well, of course she is.  She was raised by someone who didn’t know what it was like to be a child.”  The chorus of gasps around the table was Draco’s first indication that he hadn’t expressed himself well.  He cringed, unsure how to recover from his faux pas.  Harry’s childhood was very firmly not spoken of.  It had taken many nights when they were together, complete with vast quantities of Fire Whiskey, and full body snuggling on Draco’s part to pry the story from a tearful Harry.  Draco had merely been remarking upon Harry’s unique parenting style, that of raising a self-confident young woman, but clearly he’d phrased it badly, as a criticism.
“It’s okay, we’ll wait for it to make you feel a little better.”  Again, Draco wiped Harry’s face.  Harry looked so young while asleep.  Draco longed to take him in his arms.  He smoothed a hand down Harry’s back.
“Thanks,” Ron said.  “It’s marvellous, really, when I’ve gotten enough sleep to appreciate it.  Where’s Kreacher?”
“We’ll find a way to help channel her good intentions into something less intrusive,” Draco said.  Harry allowed himself a moment to bask in the idea that he wasn’t doing this on his own, that Draco and he would parent Cass together.  Then, he willed his disobedient hopes back in check, and took a sip of tea.
Despite not having any tears left to cry, his body shakes with sobs.  When arms surround him, he tries to fight them off, and only stops struggling when he sees a flash of green that he’d know anywhere.  He stills.  “Draco.”
“Stop stereotyping.  Why don’t we go to the Leaky Cauldron? I owe Hannah an apology, and I’ll buy you dinner.”
“You’re lucky you aren’t going to this stupid thing, mate,” Ron says, through a sandwich as he emerges from the kitchen, Rosie perched in one arm.  Hermione slaps his arm and he says, “What?  It’s going to be bloody awful.”
“No!  He’s institutionalized, his people have been enslaved for so long that they don’t even realize that they can live in other ways.”
“No!” Hermione’s voice was shrill.  “No,” she amended, more calmly, “let’s see how you and I do first.  Ronald, could you keep Harry entertained?  Maybe he could use a bath after he’s done eating.”
“Yes,” Draco whispered.  “Of course she is.”  He was gazing at her in awe, and Harry was so ashamed he’d robbed him of this for nearly ten years that his nails bit into his palms within his clenched hands.
A week after Harry leaves, Draco is desultorily tidying his workbench and sees the amulet that he’d made for Teddy.  He looks down at it for a long time, and then he takes a deep breath, and apparates to the address that he’s known, but been terrified for ages to visit.
“Harry, I know that the press has always been somewhat predatory about you, and that your privacy hasn’t always been well-guarded.  In the past, I believe that you’ve learned to keep a tight control on your behaviour in public, but with recent events, I think I may have been remiss in not warning you in advance.”
“And she doesn’t know anyone who would have a potions lab?” Draco said.  “A friend from school or something?”
“Never mind, Potter,” a voice from behind me says.  “I didn’t for a moment assume that you’d think ahead to book something.  Reservation for Malfoy.”  He directs the last sentence to the host, who looks so relieved that he won’t have to turn me away that he amps up the fawning as he leads us to the table.  He spends a distressingly long time ensuring I’m seated in my chair, and pats the napkin onto my lap with great care, which is embarrassing.  Draco watches the production with amusement, his beautiful eyes dancing.
Draco followed more slowly, wondering what Harry meant.  There had been something a little wistful in his gaze since the night they’d shared a drink in Draco’s office.  When he caught anyone looking, he’d quickly smile, and jump back into the conversation, but something was on his mind.  As he neared the ground, he allowed himself to hope, just for a moment, that Harry was also wondering if there could be a future for them.  Now that he'd banished his initial anger and hurt, Draco could admit to himself that he'd surrendered his heart to Harry, years ago.  He'd done his duty, produced an heir, even built a life with Astoria and Scorpius, but a part of him remained Harry's.
Concerned that something was amiss with Harry or the baby, Draco dismissed the owl without a reply, told his Mother that he’d return shortly, and apparated back to the Tonks Cottage.  He didn’t expect that his Aunt’s floo was open to Malfoy Manor.  Feeling a sense of trepidation, Draco politely knocked on the door.
“Good game, Malfoy,” The goalie yelled after him as he and Harry left.  Draco raised an arm in acknowledgement, but didn’t turn around.
“I want to suck you,” Draco whispered into Harry’s mouth.  “I want to taste you.”  Harry’s answering gasp was all the invitation he needed.  Draco fumbled with Harry’s flies, and when Harry’s cock sprang free from his pants, Draco wanted to weep.  “So beautiful, Harry.  Can I?”
“Of course not,” Draco said, relieved.  He extended a hand to the dog, who sniffed him curiously before his tongue lolled out in a delighted doggy grin.  Draco scratched his ears, and the dog’s tail thumped against the side of the sofa.
I knock on the door, and hear, “Enter,” barked curtly from the other side.  I push the door open, and there he is.  He’s looking at me suspiciously though, his dazzling eyes narrowed.  “Potter.”
“Has he changed, then?  I seem to recall that he was a superior little shit in Hogwarts, if the stories you tell are even remotely true.”
As the hours passed, Harry fell into a fitful sleep, but Draco stayed awake.  Harry was clearly dreaming, and at one point, he issued a single, heartrending sob, but didn’t wake.  Draco considered nudging him out of the dream, but dismissed the idea.  Things were too fraught, Draco’s emotions too tangled, to risk any further emotional exposure.
Harry was immediately forgotten as Malfoy knelt in front of his son.  “Oh, darling.  Come here.”  He gathered the child into his arms, and held him tightly.  “Are you alight?”
Molly is at the kitchen table, sitting across from George, holding one of his hands with both of hers.  She is speaking quietly, and George is nodding, tears flowing unchecked down his cheeks.  “Molly,” Arthur says, trying to summon some of his usual good humour.  “Look who’s here.”
Draco paced the floor of the drawing room, hoping to dispel some of the tension that threatened.  He’d already lost his lunch more than once throughout the afternoon, but, since he was prone to doing the same thing before a game, he wasn’t that surprised.  Usually, a bout of pre-game nerves gave him a precision focus that ensured he played well.  Today, he just felt a lingering queasiness, and his hands shook no less than they had when he woke up.  The house elf who seemed to be in charge popped into the room, and, with a serene bow, pressed a calming draught into his hand.  It seemed as good an idea as any, so Draco downed the draught and gratefully passed the vial back to the little elf, who disappeared from the room again.  Suffused with potion-induced calm, Draco ran a now-steady hand through his hair and straightened his robes.  It felt strange to be wearing Wizarding clothing again, but Draco comforted himself by wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with a grinning wolf, the mascot of his team back home, under his jumper.
Harry gaped at him for just a second, before remembering who he was speaking with, and promptly closing his mouth.  He gave Snape a nod, almost a bow, and went upstairs to bed.
“Luna, my Mum used to sing this to me,” Harry had replied, a bit frantically.  “I remember my mum singing this to me.”  She had pulled him tighter and together they listened to the lyrics:
“But he could do himself a danger!  Weasley, you can’t play around with these sorts of things.  What potions is he on?”
“But why would you lie?”  Harry’s voice sounded so hurt, that Draco felt like crying.  “Why would you tell me something that wasn’t true?”
“I didn’t imagine I’d ever hear myself say these words, Draco, but I honestly think that you’re in a healthy enough place that, if you still wanted to pursue it, I can’t see any reason why it would be unhealthy.  I can’t imagine why you’d want to, when there are easily ten dozen men who would be less work, but…”
While he was gone, Draco tried to think of something to say, and eventually settled on “Your gardens here are lovely.  Do you enjoy horticulture?”
Her face darkens.  “Vi’s Dad was a Death Eater.  He was captured and killed before Violet was born.  And we weren’t together.”
He’s sitting in the staff room one morning, completing a requisition for new student brooms, when a Portrait nearby clears its throat.  Harry looks up, surprised to find that Snape himself is standing in the frame.  Harry has ignored Snape’s portrait in Minerva’s office since the day it was installed.  Then, he’d politely and privately thanked his Potions Professor, and apologized for his many transgressions.  Snape had seemed a little surprised at his humility, but had accepted his thanks, and his apology, congratulated him on his accomplishments, and they’d both silently resolved to avoid one another, which had been successful so far.  “Sir,” Harry says, standing.  He still feels uncomfortable with Snape, who is no less imposing in the frame of a sunny meadow, which he’s entered, seemingly, to speak to Harry.
Harry fucks him slow this time, his cock plunging in, inch by excruciating inch.  His eyes never leave Draco’s and Harry thinks he may lose himself inside the sea-storm depths of Draco’s gaze.  He makes love to Draco with everything he has, and when he spends himself inside him, leaves behind traces of his heart.  His orgasm triggers tears, which Harry quickly swipes away so Draco doesn’t see.
Harry’s lack of adult companionship was a topic discussed more often than usual between a father and his nearly ten year old daughter.  Harry knew that he treated Cass more like an adult than was strictly necessary.  He reasoned that, not having had a stellar childhood himself, he wasn’t sure how to relate to a child that hadn’t grown up surrounded by darkness.  On balance, though, he figured that the two of them made it work.  Cass certainly was the cleverest, most well-adjusted child he knew, even if he were slightly biased.
“And the fact is that the reason they’ve been able to do it all is because they've used secrecy, blackmail, and vague laws that people don’t understand.  So what if we remove the secrecy?”
By eight that night, Harry had barely spoken a word, and hadn’t left Cass’ beside, not even for a second.  Draco wondered that he hadn’t wet the bed, but he understood.  Scorpius had been disappointed that his sister hadn’t awoken, and was petulant and cranky before he finally dropped off to sleep.  Astoria kissed them all soundly, and said she’d return in the morning.
He didn’t wait for her to say anything else.  He stumbled into the back yard, and apparated home.  Kreacher, who was dragging a bit of string for Gimple to pounce on, jumped to his feet. “Something has happened to Master Harry,” he said in concern.
“Did you…” Draco decided that today was a day for risks.  “Would you like to have lunch with me?  If you’re free?”
Her words hurt Draco terribly.  He tried to keep his voice still and even, but he could tell that it sounded young, fragile.  “Well, Aunt, I appreciate your opinions.  How kind of you to look out for your family.”  He did everything he could to infuse a sneer into the statement, but it fell flat.
“Harry, Harry,” Draco says, as his thrusts grow harder, more erratic.  I cant my hips back to meet his, the only sounds are our breath and slapping skin. I’m seeing spots, and it’s so good, everything I dreamed.  “Draco,” I gasp.  “Gonna’ come.”
"When I woke up in the shack, she wasn’t angry anymore.  Gin…she’s the youngest of the family, and the only girl.  She’s well used to being able to talk people around.  If they don’t listen to her persuasion, she has a temper that usually gets everyone to comply.  She talked for a long time, about how our relationship was good, and how I’d grown to love her once, and I would again.  She talked about how I had finally gotten the family that I wanted, in the Weasleys, and all I had to do was say that I’d stay with her, and this could all be forgotten.”
After Draco leaves, Harry removes him from the wards.  Then he gets spectacularly drunk and destroys his library.  He wakes the following morning, sticky dried blood on his face from shattered glass hitting him in the face as he smashed and rampaged.  The snake had come in sometime in the night and lies curled around him.  Harry pets the snake on the head and tries not to think of the future.
“Oh?” Draco asked, surprised.  Lara rarely brought anything up anymore.  Usually, Draco was the one driving their sessions, as he talked, stream-of-consciousness about the things he’d done, and learned, and how funny he thought that some of the Muggle things he’d seen were.
It isn’t a romantic declaration of undying love, and, to be honest, I’d have no idea what to do with one of those anyways.  But, it’s honest, and for now, that’s enough.  “Alright then.  So we’re doing this?  We’re…together?  Even though I’m an emotionless shell of my former self?”
Everyone turns to look at me then, with varying expressions of gobsmackedness, which I wasn’t expecting, because for me, it’s perfectly reasonable to prioritize.  Even though Ron vindicates me slightly by muttering, “Fucking Wendell.”
I shrug, which has him doing his whole ‘blink at me strangely’ routine.  He’s posh, clearly I’m not posh, it just makes good sense to work to our strengths.  Hopefully I’ll soon figure out what mine are.  He seems to mentally shrug back, and then obligingly opens the menu.
“It’s almost a relief, Mother,” Draco whispered, once again sitting by Narcissa’s bedside.  “Of course, it’s not, really.  But seeing him, knowing that he isn’t mine anymore, it’s awful.”  He opened the book of poetry and began to read.
“Alright.  Here’s the hard part.  I don’t want you to tell me any of the reasons why you can’t have it.  If you feel really strongly about doing so, you can, later.  Right now, all I want you to do is just name it.  Name the thing you most want in the world.”
But, I realize, I’ve reached the end of my patience.  I don’t think that I’ve been much more than a pawn, all along.  Certainly, to hear of the way Dumbledore used me, I fell into my role without much reluctance, as an impressionable eleven year old.  And then, fresh from a War, a War during which I willingly walked to my death, Kingsley and his Ministry must have seen me as ripe for the picking.  With a quick apology to my former self, who will no doubt be furious with what I’ve done with his life, I say, “Minister, I’ve a number of things to do today, and I’m certain you’re a busy man as well.  Shall we get straight to the heart of the matter?”
“Harry.”  Something in her voice made him look up.  “You weren’t a joke.”  Her brown eyes were filled with sincerity.  Harry shrugged, uncomfortable.  “Alright, no sneering.”
“Honestly, Potter,” Draco was impatient.  “I’m merely asking whether you want me to observe any specific rules.  Bedtime, behaviour, that sort of thing.”
The day dragged endlessly on.  His Mother would go long periods where her exhaled breath would finish, and no further inhalation happened.  Draco would tense, thinking this was the end, only to hear her gasp another agonizing breath and begin the cycle again.  He looked around the empty room.  This was the last of the Malfoys.  His beautiful mother, dying in a room with a son who’d disgraced her, nobody else here to notice, or mourn, or bide.  Everyone who had been anyone to them was gone, either dead, or imprisoned, or had fled the country after the war.  What a stupid fucking waste, Draco thought.
When his body had finished changing, Draco wanted nothing more than to run away.  That was, frankly, the most terrifying experience he’d ever lived through.  More terrifying, even, than the sight of the adult Potter’s still body being carried back from the Forbidden Forest (Draco didn’t bother exploring why he still called the adult version Potter, while the child remained Harry) and the notion that he’d failed, and the Dark Lord had won.  Somehow, this tiny child under Draco’s care, still and unbreathing, was so much worse.  Draco’s breath was coming in painful gasps and his entire body trembled.  Hermione took one look at him, and at Harry’s tiny form, and said, “Draco, go.  I’ll get him into some bigger clothes, and we’ll see you soon to cast the diagnostics.”
I think for a moment.  I see the way the sun shone through his hair as he flew, the way he looked at his son with reverence, the way that he looked at
She crinkles her forehead.  “Yeah.  We went to Hogwarts with him.  He’s in Rehab and Prob now.  Bit of a prat, if I recall correctly.  Why?”
“Thanks,” he said roughly, and he summoned a hoodie, shoved his feet into a pair of ratty trainers and disappeared into the night.  The minute his feet hit the steps of the porch, he started running, and he didn’t stop until his lungs felt like they were on fire, and his t-shirt was soaked with sweat.  He turned and started walking back, but as he passed a park, he diverted, and sat on one of the empty swings.  Not far away, he could hear laughter and talking from a group of kids.  Teenagers, likely drinking underneath the bleachers near the baseball field.  He pushed himself with his feet, feeling the wind cooling his sweat-soaked hair.  He closed his eyes for a minute, pretending that was yesterday, before this had happened.
“I think it’s possible.  There isn’t a lot of study of how magic develops and increases as we age.  Harry is the most powerful wizard I know, and yes, he’s demonstrating powerful accidental magic, but if his magical core was as concentrated as usual, I’d expect him to blow up your flat every time he had a tantrum.  His core has to be smaller now that he is.  I’d never even thought of that!”  She disappeared up the stairs, and returned a few minutes later.  “Kreacher says that dinner is ready.  And Harry’s magical core is nothing like it was.”
Suddenly, there was a firm hand on his shoulder and a vial thrust under his nose.  “Breathe.”  Given that it was a biological imperative, Harry saw no reason to disobey.  The smell was pungent, bracing.  He blinked, looked closely at the face in front of his.  “Well done, Harry.  We’ll work with you to develop some coping strategies to help you stay grounded when you start to disassociate in the future.  Do you know what triggered it?”
Draco sighed.  “As a child, I…well, you know full well how I was.  A lot of it came from ignorance.  When Scorpius was born, I wanted things to be different.  I didn’t want him to make the same assumptions that I did.  I wanted him to be exposed to all sorts of different people.  I bought this house, in a Muggle neighbourhood, and, by the time he was ready to start Primary, he had friends.  It just made sense.”
Violet’s father put a protective arm around his daughter.  “Officer, I don’t really know how to explain what happened.  It was very strange, but I’m sure it’s not Violet’s fault.”
“Draco, don’t,” I say wearily.  I want to go home. I don’t want to have this conversation while tipsy and smelling of sex with a stranger.  Maybe I don’t want to have the conversation at all.  What is there to say?
“Idiot.  You’re my person.  You’re my family.  Besides, we’re wizards.  It’s not like we can’t get Portkeys anytime we want.”
“Okay, time for a skate.”  Draco led Harry to the rink, and into the small room he’d converted into a facsimile of a locker room.  He was just training today, so he didn’t need equipment, but he sat on the bench and pulled a knee support onto his right leg.
Minerva patted the seat next to her, but Harry shook his head a little.  He gathered his legs onto the armchair and wrapped his arms around them, resting his chin on his knee.
This happens sometimes, though, so he simply snuggles in tighter and tries to warm the cold body.  Finally though, a deep voice in the darkness, sounding as though the world has ended.  “My father has set a date.”
“Oh?”  Hermione was used to this.  To any listener, it would appear that he was changing the subject, but Hermione had long been his sounding board, and he relied on her.  If he was careful, he could tell her things without
“The psychologist and I developed a theory.  We thought that the trauma of your childhood, and the way your Aunt and Uncle treated you had overdeveloped your super-ego.  Once you got to Hogwarts, it only got worse, because Dumbledore fed that narrative and positioned you as this hero who had to sacrifice himself to save humanity.”
“Oh, Narcissa,” Harry sighed.  “I’m so sorry that you found yourself in that position.  I doubt it makes you feel any better, but I have no doubt that your intentions were good.  Besides that, to regret not speaking up would be to regret Astoria and Scorpius, and I know how much you love them.  Who knows whether Draco wanted anything different at the time, but I have no doubt he is happy with his family.”  He pursed his lips ruefully.  “We’re quite a pair, aren’t we?  Both of us live with the shame of knowing that we’ve wronged Draco in some way.”
Scorpius ran over to give his sister a hug, and then bestowed a similar embrace upon Harry, who smiled and said, “All ready Score?”
After a few hours of catching up on gossip, Harry excused himself to the kitchen to prepare dinner.  The chatter continued from the living room, but Harry relished the opportunity to work, alone with his thoughts, for a few minutes.  He chopped vegetables, and made a stew methodically, allowing the repetitive movements to soothe him.  He loved Minerva as much as he would have loved his own Mother, but having her here, in his home, left him feeling unsettled.  She represented the world he’d fled, and when it encroached on the safe space he’d created for himself here, he was left feeling panicky, threatened.
Cass watched him for a long moment, her eyes appraising.  “Team Canada’s doing well,” she finally said, and it wasn’t much of an olive branch, but it was something.  Harry’s smile widened a little, and Draco quirked his lips at Cass, a silent sign of support.
“It’s wonderful here,” I say.  “I can see how hard you all work, but it’s nice here.  Comfortable.  You’re lucky.”
And so the day passes.  Luna Lovegood and Neville arrive, bearing a plant, and an enormous jug of Dirigible Plum Brandy.  Harry continues in the kitchen, pressing soups and hearty breads on the Weasleys any time he can make one of them sit down.  Hermione spells a load of laundry on.  Luna and Neville de-gnome the garden.  As sundown approaches, Harry summons the brandy, and pours everyone a healthy measure.  McGonagall arrives at some point near dinner, along with Hagrid, and they adjourn to the garden where Ron and Hermione (but mostly Hermione) start a bonfire.
Harry smiled.  Of course Andromeda would know who he was talking about.  “Did you know that he has a little boy?”
Harry looked at Draco then, as though he was asking permission.  Draco tried to smile.  “You’re welcome to stay here if you like. I will do my best to take care of you.”  He secretly hoped that Harry would want to go with Hermione.  He didn’t know the first thing about taking care of a small child, and this one was so fragile.  Draco was certain he’d somehow end up getting Harry hurt.  Harry stood then, and slowly crossed the room to where Draco was stood.  Slowly, as though afraid he’d be chastised for it, he reached out a tiny hand and took Draco’s.
“Fine, Papa, but I know I have to go.”  Scorpius’ tears were lessening, as he calculated the exact moment of Draco’s capitulation.
“Thank you, Kreacher.  You must be tired.  You’re welcome to stay here, or, if you prefer, you can return to your home, and come back tomorrow.”
I stifle a groan, but luxuriate in the imagined sensation, his tongue swirling around the length of my cock, the way he sucks hard and the feel of the head pressing against his soft palate.  I imagine those grey eyes looking up at me, his slim, clever fingers caressing my balls, whispering along my perineum, ghosting across my hole.  That’s when I realize that there’s another presence in my mind, watching alongside me.  I picture myself gripping that soft blond hair, pulling just enough to keep him present.  He pulls out of my mind abruptly, reeling back physically, and sitting on his haunches.
“But I couldn’t get you out of my head.  I don’t even remember what you said to me that day, but I know that I spent all night trying to figure it out.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but something changed for me that day.
There’s an office right in the centre of all of the desks, and the plate on the door says ‘Gawain Robards’.  I peer inside with interest.  Robards sits at his desk, a pile of parchment in front of him.  His jaw is set tightly, and I wonder if he ever unclenches it.  He’s holding his quill so firmly that his knuckles are white.  I note, with interest, the bags under his eyes, the sea of wrinkles around his mouth.  He looks old, worn out, unhappy.
“Yes.”  Harry could barely breathe.  The tension that gnawed at his chest grew steadily more intense.
“At some points in the session, Harry or I might ask you some questions directly, but unless we do so, I’d like you to try to primarily listen to what Harry is saying.  If you react strongly to what he’s telling you, we can take some time to explore it further, but where possible, this isn’t a session for you to rebut or invalidate what Harry is telling you.  Does that make sense?”
“Bollocks,” McGonagall says pertly, and Harry grins in spite of himself.  McGonagall is a few fire-whiskies in, herself, it seems.  “You did beautifully, Potter.  No one could have asked more of you, and I won’t allow you to minimize your sacrifice.”  Harry doesn’t know what to say.  “Do you feel left out?”
“You never tell me anything!” Cass cried, and threw her napkin onto the table.  “Excuse me,” she said to the family at large, and stomped from the room.
“Why did my Dad fall in love with you?  If you hated him, and fought along with the man who wanted to kill him?”
“What the fuck is wrong with this place?” My voice cuts through the room sharply, and everyone jumps.  “You did all that, you took away my life because you wanted to
As I sit in my flat, feeling a bit sorry for myself, I resolve to go out, get blinding drunk, and sleep with the hottest man I can find.  I war with the ennui that comes of being so disappointed and the motivation to lash out and hurt the one who hurt me.  It’s a fool’s game, though.  Draco obviously doesn’t care if I sleep with someone else, and he’s the only one I want.  A knock at the door interrupts my brisk bout of staring out the window, and as I stumble to the door, I’m surprised that it’s already getting dark.  It seems that I’d spent a lot more time than I expected, lost in my thoughts.
He grabbed his hockey bag and his stick and made his way outside, where the Quidditch pitch had been transformed into an Olympic sized rink, magically cooled, regardless of the temperature.  It had been a long-distance gift from his mother, a blatant bribe to entice him to come home.  “You can still do your sporting here,” she’d said.  Lacing up his skates, dumping the bucket of pucks onto the ice, skating drills until he was drenched in sweat, this made sense.  He could do this.  When he skated, he forgot.
“Picture it,” I say.  “Midnight, a dark warehouse.  I’m sneaking through the shadows, because that’s what I do.  At my job.  Sneak, and vanquish evil, that sort of thing.  I’m looking dashingly handsome, of course, in my dark green robes-”
left.  And now four years had passed, and somehow Harry hadn’t married Ginny Weasley, and he hadn’t gotten his happily ever after.
Minerva and Severus exchanged another one of those cryptic looks they were so good at.  Harry wanted no comments from either of them, so he continued, “And, most importantly of all, we need to be sensitive to the people who remained here after I left.  People who knew me, and were fond of me.  Ron and Hermione.  Neville.  Luna.  The Weasleys.”
At the end of the following day, Harry returned to fetch Cass in time for dinner, and had responded to Astoria’s owled invitation to join them.  He crossed the floo and was immediately overwhelmed by the gangly arms and legs of his enthusiastic daughter.  He seemed equally excited to see her and Draco tried to ignore the pang that struck his heart like a gong.
For a split second, Draco thought that his mother would continue her path to the floo, to escape another confrontation.  Then, she turned, and Draco could see a hesitant, hopeful smile on her lips.  “He’s really quite a beautiful baby,” she remarked.  “Mister Potter is a handsome man, but I somehow never pictured just how lovely his features would be in miniature.”
“I know, sweet one, and I’m sorry, but I need to go and help a kid.  I’m sure that Mum will help you with your divination,” Harry said, prompting a look from Hermione that promised future retribution.
“If we could just talk, you’d understand, Harry.  I think you’re confused, maybe someone’s cursed you, but you love me, Harry.  We’re together.”
“Scorpius, you are good,” Harry said firmly.  “There’s absolutely no question of that.  None of this is your fault, and I promise you that I’m here to protect you.  If there’s anything going on in your life that makes you frightened, or upset, you can tell me, and I will believe you.  I promise.”
Harry’s smile was brilliant.  “You’re so good,” he said in wonder.  “I’m so lucky.  Did my cousin Dudley go to magic school?”
He looked up a Draco now, and his eyes, still tear-filled, were so green, and so desperately pained.  “Of course it didn’t work like that.  I chose to return to England, and I did have to admit that I’d gone about things in a terrible way.  And when I saw the custody papers, it reinforced everything I’d been telling myself for years.  That freaks aren’t allowed to ask for things.  That saviours aren’t allowed to want something, especially if it takes it away from someone else.”
“And I don’t know what to tell you.”  He kisses me gently.  “Do you think that maybe you should watch the memories?”
“Draco?”  Yanked back from his thoughts, Draco looked up.  Harry’s eyes were incredibly beautiful.  Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen such a lovely shade of green in his life.  “Are you listening?”
When he returned, Minerva was preparing to leave.  “I’ll see her in the morning when she’s awake,” she said firmly.  Her words seemed to galvanize Harry, and he squared his shoulder and managed a watery smile.
“Oh,” Harry said sadly.  “So it’s my fault then, that they’re dead.  How come he didn’t kill me then?”
“I’d like the dragon story, this morning,” she announces, her tone filled with the assuredness of a child who often gets her way.  I stare at her blankly for a minute. I don’t
“I’m irrevocably gay,” he’d said.  “I know that my parents insist upon an heir, and I’m willing to do my duty to the family, but I won’t lie to you and tell you that we’ll have a normal marriage.”
“You watch Drag Race?”  The show was Draco’s secret guilty pleasure, stealthily hidden from his teammates.  They knew he was bent, but Draco made sure not to make a
Which is why I’m standing on Hermione and Ron’s porch after my shift, feeling awkward and unsure how to deal with all of this.  I wonder, briefly and futilely, if I would have been better at this with memories intact.  Hermione answers the door, and looks at me warily.  “Hi,” she finally says.  Her voice is small and unsure, and I’m terrified for a moment that she’s going to cry.
Hermione’s eyes flashed in panic at Draco, and he said, “Weren’t you afraid that you’d cause an almighty fuss if you told your mother?”
Draco had stroked his cheek, just once and said, “I don’t think you’re stupid, and I find it really freeing that you don’t insist on obeying every single Pureblooded social convention.  I pick at you because I’m a stuffy spoiled control freak and sometimes I’m terrified that you’ll realize that I’m not good enough for you.”  And, just like that, Harry had been in love.
“Not exactly, Harry.  Although,” Hermione cast a fairly helpless look at Draco, “I guess there were times when you felt a bit bullied.”
His glare in return is filthy.  I wonder briefly if she's calling him a bastard for the kidnapping or the sandwich.
Then the floo chimed again, and Weasley stepped out, followed by Potter, who stumbled over the hearth and just barely missed cracking his head on the marble counter.  “Malfoy,” he said,  attempting to sound professional, his face going red.
His face is grey, and lined, and his hair is like something I’ve never seen.  I imagine he’s been pulling at it.  At the sight of me, he dissolves into tears, and despite my feeling about crying, I hurry to his side.  “Draco,” I say, pulling him close.  He weeps into my neck, harsh, barking sobs that seem to go on forever while I stand, awkwardly patting his back.  He gains control of himself eventually, however, and produces a handkerchief which he uses to mop his face.  He looks over at Pansy, and his expression hardens.  “Pans, I told you not to.”
“Thank you, Pansy.  For helping me with all of this.  I don’t give a fuck what happens to my reputation, but I appreciate you doing everything you can to protect Cass and Draco.  What do you want me to do?”
, Draco thought, dragging himself out of the rocking chair.  His back and neck ached from sleeping in the rocking chair.  Harry’s hands patted Draco’s cheeks gently.  “Pottah,” Harry said.
As he followed the house elf to Astoria’s room to drop off his things, he suddenly realized that he could have had something similar.  If he hadn’t run away, perhaps he could have shared the easygoing sense of family that Astoria and Draco had.  If he hadn't been so reactive, running away without exploring the facts...
“That’s enough,” Harry snapped.  Even years later, the word triggered a visceral reaction.  He removed his wand from his pocket, looped it in a lasso-ing motion, and incanted, "
There’s something awfully close to grudging admiration on his face, and I can’t help but bask in it a little.  “That is…surprisingly well reasoned,” he finally says.
When Draco Malfoy was a child, such was his dislike of waking early in the morning, that the house elves used to squabble about whose turn it was to rouse him.  When any of the elves misbehaved, his Father would grimly punish them by assigning them the duty of waking Master Draco for a week, and it was a far more effective behaviour modification than any other.  However, things change as people grow older, and, despite his continued hatred of mornings, Draco was no longer the spoiled brat he’d once been, and he considered this a significant marker of his personal growth.
“God, Draco, of course,” Harry said.  “This is the best present I ever got.  This is better than the pictures of my parents and my invisibility cloak combined.”
“It’s some form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, right?”  Hermione’s voice was matter-of-fact.  Draco stared at her for as long as he could bear, and, seeing no other option, nodded.
“Mill told me.  She said your mates from Slytherin who weren’t marked, but had Death Eater parents were all put on probation, but it’s indefinite, and the probation officers seem to have a grudge.”
He’d fallen into a fitful sleep when his charmed Galleon warmed.  Blinking his eyes blearily, he straightened his glasses and read the message.
And that, it seemed, was that.  Lara trusted him.  Draco marvelled at the notion, as Lara continued, “And don’t worry too much about whether you’re able to provide physical affection to Harry.  He won’t suffer without it, at least, no more than he did the first time around.  Trust your judgement, do what feels right, and call me if you need me.”
“For what it’s worth,” I say, stroking her hair a little, “I’m really sorry that you’re hurting.  I’m pretty sure I would never hurt you on purpose.”
“Of course!  It doesn’t pay to alienate the girl who doles out ice creams.  Especially since you’ve been here both times.  Do you live behind that counter?”
“Of course I get attached, mate, she was the most talented of the lot!” Ron kicked a cushion in fury, prompting Hannah to give him a filthy glare.
Cass wasn’t sure, looking back, when she first started to suspect that her Dad wouldn’t be returning from Canada in a week or two.  The idea, at first, was stupid.  Her Dad
“Oh, um…” Harry examined it.  The bruising had gotten worse, but the bleeding had stopped.  “Fine, thanks.”
The article’s full of speculative bullshit.  I’m relieved to know that Ginny refused to comment, and Hannah barred the reporter, Skeeter, from the Leaky, but despite anything other than a blurry picture, Skeeter manages to discuss, for several paragraphs, my sexuality, how susceptible I am to becoming a Dark Lord, and what my current mental state is.
“But I don’t want that.  I don’t really know what I’d like to do, but if I don’t have something to keep me busy while I figure it out, I’ll go mental.  I want to work somewhere that I can make people happy, where I enjoy the people I work with.  I’d like to work here sometimes, if you’d allow it.”
Ultimately, though, Harry had coped well with his new circumstances.  He was still very quiet and withdrawn, and tended to shy away from new situations and people…the Weasley-Grangers had caused him to hide in a corner for over an hour.  The true success, however, had been late on the second afternoon, when Draco had been conjuring wisps of coloured smoke that whirled and danced around the room.  One had taken the form of a hippogriff, and when it bowed low in front of Harry, he’d reached his hand out and smiled.  It was the first time Draco had seen anything other than a frown or a blank, stoic face, since Harry had turned three.
Draco felt his arms encircle Harry, one of his hands carding through his hair.  It was incredibly soft.  Harry’s tongue was in his mouth, and without thinking, Draco sucked it.  Harry’s groan went straight to Draco’s cock, and he was instantly hard, straining against his tight Quidditch pants.  He pulled Harry closer, and ground his erection into Harry’s thigh.
I’m waiting in the queue for the teller when something catches my eye.  To my surprise, it’s the bloke from the club.  “Draco,” I say without thinking, and it must have come out louder than I expected, because he turns to look.  When his eyes land on mine, one side of his lip curls up in a smirk.  I wink, and he looks startled, and then turns and scurries away into one of the offices.  I can feel Ron watching me, and so I let it go for the moment.
“No, I have.  It’s just that his emails are short, and he isn’t saying anything.  I think that something’s wrong.”
“I feel like I’m being sent to my death,” Draco says bleakly.  Harry knows that feeling.  He nods, crouches between Draco’s knees, looks up into his face.
“She is,” he agreed.  After tea had been served, and Cass had lugged Minerva’s carpet bag up to the spare room, Cass was full of questions.  “Any new ghosts?”
Draco had gotten used to how Harry reacted to the potion, but it was still frightening to see him stop breathing.  Draco theorized that the sudden flood of two years worth of memories were simply overwhelming him.  This time, it seemed to take an excruciatingly long time for Harry to come back to himself.  When he finally opened his eyes, he blinked for a moment in confusion.  His eyes lit on Hermione, and he seemed to relax a little, despite his disoriented expression.  Then he spotted Draco.
“Yeah, basically," Astoria said, with a smile.  “Draco and I are both Slytherins, always thinking about what every single thing
“I don’t think I have a choice, do I?”  Harry was tired, which was ironic, since he’d, apparently, been asleep for a week.
He made his way to the potions cabinet, finding a hangover remedy and returning to the sitting room.  Harry had been sick again, and Draco vanished it quickly, casting a quick mouth-freshening charm.  “Here, drink this,” he whispered, again holding Harry’s head up and uncorking the potion.  Harry took a few swallows before shaking his head.  “Can’t,” he murmured.  “Going to sick again.”
“It wasn’t a test,” Cass said sharply, and Draco longed to correct her, to warn her that she was breaking Harry’s heart every time she rejected his attempt to connect.  “Just review with my tutor.”
“I’ll miss you, but not too much. I want you to get to know your Papa.  You have a lot of his mannerisms, you know.  You need some time to get to know him.”
Startling awake, Draco’s eyes flew open and he found himself staring into Harry’s.  The eyes that had captivated him, laughed at him, danced with mischief, they were so familiar that Draco felt a throb of loss. Looking around, he realized that only he and Harry remained in the sitting room.  “Sorry, I must have dozed off.”
“Harry,” Weasley said.  “Can you say ‘Kreacher’?”  Potter tilted his head for a moment and his lips moved, suggesting he was yelling, but the bubblehead prevented them from hearing the words.  Impatiently, Draco cancelled the spell, and Potter looked thoughtful before sneezing three times.  Draco cast a freshening charm while Weasley said again, “Harry, say ‘Kreacher’.”
Draco smiled as he put the note with the others that Harry had written him, but the anxiety that filled his gut rose and twisted like a terrified animal.  Harry wanted him to visit, and Draco desperately wanted to see him.  But how could he?  Other than the trip to the Manor, Draco hadn’t left the house in so long.  The notion of being out there, where unimaginable danger lurked, was unfathomable.
“Blaise,” Draco’s voice sounded croaky, but oh, Merlin, it was so good to see him.  Awash in homesickness, Draco was unsure what to do.  And then in an instant, Blaise closed the distance between them and wrapped strong arms around Draco, lifting him up in an exuberant hug.  Draco returned the hug, blinking back unexpected tears.  “I’ve missed you.”
”  He knew it would be difficult, and that Harry wouldn’t blame him in the slightest for wanting to stay within the protective wards of his house, but this might be the last time that Harry looked at him with anything other than scorn.  “Would you like to see where I grew up?”
Ron looked delightedly back.  “Fuck me,” he breathed, “I never thought I’d see Harry’s first steps.  Well done, mate!”
“Well, we don’t have to decide right now.  How about this…you have a birthday in a week.  We’ll stay until then, and we can decide what our plans are after that.”
“What if you regret this?” Harry asks, his voice small.   “What if you resent me for robbing you of your family?”
Harry’s brow crinkled for a moment, considering.  His lips parted, and suddenly, there was a fire in his eyes.  “Fuck it,” he declared, before launching himself at Draco and kissing him.
Harry flinched, but looked hard at Draco.  “Really,” he said flatly.  “Nothing more than friendship?”
Obviously Ron had seen that look before as well, because he backed down, muttering, “Well, he’s got some fucking nerve showing his face here.”
Harry thought for a moment.  He’d never spent a night away from Cass before, but it would be good for her to spend time with Draco.  He stifled the disappointment of missing out on seeing her experience the places of his childhood, and managed a nearly-genuine smile.  “Yeah, of course, Draco.  I’ll speak to her tonight, and I can have Greg bring her over in the morning.  If anything comes up, I’ll owl you.”
Draco looked accusingly at Harry, who tried his best to look innocent, raising his hands in an ‘I swear this line of conversation has nothing to do with me’ gesture.  “Yes, Scorpius, I actually did know that,” Draco said with dignity.
“I get that.  It’s hard for me to adjust, because you never used to want to decide anything.  I got into the habit of telling you what to do.  I guess I just didn’t expect that you’d suddenly stop wanting that.”  She smiles at me.  “It’s good though.  I wanted…want you to be more in charge of your life.”  She stands up and throws her arms around me.  She might be bossy, but she gives amazing hugs.  As she sits back down, I can see the glimmer of tears in her eyes.  “So I heard that things didn’t work out with Malfoy.”
We settle back down, in the beautiful sitting room that’s cold, and looks expensive.  I feel so unprepared to face this.  I’ve reassessed my relationship with Hermione at least three times since I woke up without my memories, and I hate the thoughts of doing it again.  Why is this friendship so complicated?
“I’m ready.” Cass looked nervous, Draco realized, but completely convinced of what she was about to do.
“I hated it up here, after,” Draco continues, crossing the floor and coming to stand next to him.  Draco looks out across the silent grounds, and Harry’s grateful Draco doesn’t look at him.
Blaise glares at him.  “Well, if this was part of some elaborate scheme to destroy Harry’s confidence, I wish you’d let Pans and I know beforehand.  We’re actually friends with him now, and you’ve made things awfully awkward.”
He cuts me off, “I don’t have any right to ask for this, especially after I pushed you away, but, would you sleep in my room with me tonight?  I really don’t want to be alone.”
Arthur’s eyes moisten slightly.  “You’re so good,” he says finally, his voice breaking on the last word.  Harry drops the carrier bag on the ground, and allows himself to be wrapped in a hug.  He feels the shaking of Mr. Weasley’s shoulders, and clings tightly.  After a moment, Arthur composes himself, and pulls away.  “Come through,” he says.  “Molly will be delighted to see you.”
“During our sixth year at Hogwarts,” Draco says finally, “I, as you have heard, was set an impossible task.  The stress was unbearable, and the consequences of my failure was on my mind constantly.  I began to dissemble, and if it wasn’t for Severus, reminding of my training, I…well, who knows what would have happened?  At any rate, Severus did remind me, and I made use of my occlumency shields, to protect me from the worst of my emotional turmoil.  At first, I only occluded when necessary…in classes or during meals, times when I would be watched.  By the time the year began to wane, I was occluding constantly, which is dangerous.”
“Oh, yes of course, and then you go home and you and your girlfriend laugh at me.  So funny, let’s humiliate the poof, the
“Yes, that’s him.  And then there’s Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley.  She’s six, and he’s three.”  Harry carefully watched Draco’s face, and was satisfied that his expression didn’t change at the surnames.  “And then there’s Violet Powers.  She’s seven.  Muggleborn, just learned about magic a few weeks ago.  I think she’d be a brilliant friend for Scorpius.”
It had been ten years ago, when Draco’s Mother had begun seeking a match for Draco, and Astoria’s parents had been seeking out a wealthy suitor for their daughter, that he’d first really gotten to know Astoria.  She’d been two years behind he and her sister Daphne at school, and had been so quiet and shy then, he’d barely noticed her.  Since her graduation, she had come into her own.  She wanted no part of marriage.  She wanted to be a lawyer, not a trophy wife who hosted dinners and served on charity boards.  But, since the Greengrasses were quite poor, a law degree was unattainable.  As they endured the ceremony of a ritual courtship, Draco had been nothing but honest with her.
“In a nutshell, yes,” she says with a smile.  “But that’s exactly what I mean.  Why did Voldemort gain any followers, if he was as mad as that?”
“Bertram Higgs, yes.  He’s been working with Scorpius for a little over a year now.  I think you’ll like him.”
“I don’t know, Cass, but they do.  It’s stupid, but people have always been interested in me, because sometimes weird stuff happens to me.  Like the Parseltongue, and the way my mum saved me.  Then, I left with no warning, and of course the stupid newspapers made a big deal about that.  It only stands to reason that they’ll be intrusive now that I’ve returned.”  Harry gave her a reassuring smile.
“Well, then it seems that he isn’t ready for dating.  Damnit, if it wasn’t for that stupid postcard, I’d have already given up.  Why is he so hard to understand?”
“I could never be tired of Hogwarts.  It’s brilliant.”  She said the last sentence in her mocking impression of Harry’s accent, and he smiled.
Cici’s face was kind.  “Honestly Draco, I’m very optimistic that she’ll wake up.  I just can’t promise you.  If she isn’t awake by tomorrow morning, we’ll discuss next steps.  It’s entirely possible that she’s just a bit more susceptible to sleeping draughts, and her body needs a bit of time to recover.  Do you think that Harry would take a calming draught?  Do you want one?”
“Remus?  I’m frightened,” I say.  Then, I realize.  “Oh!  I’m frightened.  I haven’t felt that since…”
“Mm,” I say, distractedly, as a man I don’t know steps through the floo.  “That needs watching, I’d say.”
“Yeah,” I say, and I can’t help but huff a little laugh, even though it’s the farthest thing from funny.  “If it’s that important, then I agree.  I wish it could be different, but I’m not the Saviour anymore.”
As his worry for Cass grew, he conjured his Patronus, which had changed to a fox after Cass had been born.  “Go check on her,” he told it, and it twitched its nose and disappeared through the wall.  It reappeared a few minutes later, looking wretched.  Cass had clearly blocked its entry to her room.  “It’s okay,” Harry reassured it, and it seemed to consider curling up at his feet, but instead, paled and faded out.
, and then I decide to keep on risking my life for the same people who called me a looney in the newspaper?  When I was an actual
“It could be a lot of things,” Harry prevaricated.  “In some cases, the child hasn’t fully accepted that he’s magical, or has been made to feel like his magic is something to be ashamed of.  Sometimes, they’re having trouble adjusting to living in the magical and non-magical worlds.”  He shrugged his shoulders.  “In rare cases, the child is acting out because he’s being hurt by someone.”
Where, just a minute ago, he was panting, now it seems like he’s barely breathing.  I move my hand to the back of his neck, my thumb stroking gently.  “Draco, will you fuck me?  Please?”
“No, not exactly.  I just was overconfident about how I fit in.  It hurt to realize that I didn’t measure up…again.” Harry’s voice trails off at the last word, as the truth of the statement hits him.  He blinks hard to combat the unexpected tears that have welled up.
Draco was just putting his book onto the nightstand when Harry entered the bedroom.  He sighed huffily.  “Oh no, Harry, you always do this!”
Ron smiled at the structure fondly.  “Yeah, well, Charlie and Bill helped Fred and George quite a bit, and Dad helped with the magic.”  Again, Draco wondered what it would have been like to grow up here, surrounded by others, amidst noise and chaos, and people who hugged, and yelled and laughed, and teased, and just…loved you.
“He’s tied up outside your gate,” Ron admits.  “We didn’t want to bring him through the wards, but I couldn’t think of what to do with him.  He’s been stupified, and there are so many incarcerous charms that we may never totally untie him.”
“So what happened then,” I ask, more to dispel the spirited discussion that’s likely to spring up between Draco and Hermione than because I actually feel ready to hear it.
He continued to rock the baby, letting his thoughts drift, watching as Harry fell properly asleep and had little baby dreams. Some time later, Draco’s rest was interrupted by a blinding flash of pain as a set of chubby fingers investigated his eye.  “Merlin!”  Draco opened the eye that wasn’t sluicing tears and found a set of curious green eyes watching him.  “Fuck, Harry, that’s not the way to wake someone up.”
Until, that is, they crossed the threshold into a crowd of people huddled around a blender on the counter.  That was when Draco realized that he’d walked into a lion’s den.  Literally, if the sea of Gryffindors were an indication.  “Guys, Draco’s here.  Be nice to him,” Pansy said airily, grabbing one of the red plastic cups from the island and stuffing it into his hand.  In unison, all of the faces turned to look at him, and Draco could feel heat rising up the back of his neck.
“Arthur, I told you not to answer the door when you’ve been into that elven wine,” a scolding voice said from behind Mister Weasley.  He looked momentarily shamefaced before beaming at Draco, and patting him soundly on the shoulder.  Mrs. Weasley shooed him back into the house before regarding Draco.  “Hello there, dear.  It’s nice to see you again.”
Harry’s embarrassed by the tears that spill down his cheeks, but Ron isn’t.  “C’mere, you daft old softy.”  Ron’s strong arms make him feel safe in a way he hasn’t felt since…ever, maybe.
“Listen, don’t worry about me.  I’m glad that you’ve told me what you want.  I can’t necessarily stay here forever, I have a business and our house will need a little attention as well.  But we don’t always have to be in the same place.  You could stay longer, if you wanted.”  Harry was proud that his voice remained even while he said this.
“Thank you,” I say softly.  His eyes are glazed, his pupils so enormous that I can barely see the grey of his iris.  “That was wonderful.  I’ve given you a lot to think about, I know, and if I keep kissing you, I’m going to get carried away, embarrass myself.  So I think I’ll say goodnight for now, and await your owl with your decision.  Is that alright?”
“You were sometimes, unintentionally, very destructive.   There are a few areas of the Ministry that still aren’t the same.  People noticed, and they started to get concerned.  Everyone knew that you weren’t doing it on purpose, but it wouldn’t be long before one of your outbursts got someone hurt, and that would just contribute to the cycle of you feeling responsible.  There was concern about the Public finding out, and jumping to conclusions.”
“Is that what I did?”  Harry knew he should be more upset about this.  He also knew, that when the adrenaline wore off, he would be, so he decided to enjoy this part while it lasted.
Harry flicked a glance towards Violet, who was watching the interplay, rapt.  “Mostly, yes.  When push comes to shove, parents generally want the best for their kids, yeah?”  He resolutely does not think about the the parents (or aunts and uncles) who don’t want the best for their kids.  “Now then,” he said, “I’m sure you have some questions about the literature that I left with you?”
He waved his wand in the direction of the shelf, and all of the stuffed toys tumbled to the floor.  One by one, he meticulously arranged them, before spelling them all back down and doing so again. And again.  He was about to do so for another round of three, when a noise behind him startled him, and he whirled around to face his adversary.  Only to find Harry, looking mortified.  “I’m so sorry,” he said lowly.  “I was going to sit down, stay out of your way, and I bumped into the wall. I didn’t mean to disturb what you were doing.”
It’s too much.  The stress, and loneliness, and grief take hold, and Draco sobs again, and angrily batters at Harry with his fists.  “You stupid, brainless, selfish git!”
If Harry needed to destroy him in the process of gaining closure, well.  Hadn’t that been what he thought he’d been doing the first time he ran away? Resolved to his fate, Draco vowed to let Harry do whatever it was he wanted.  Then, after, his Mother…well, after, Draco would return to Canada and see if there was anything left of him.
“Cleaning,” Draco muttered.  Potter had awakened a half hour earlier, and Draco had left him floating, but cast a bubblehead charm to protect his tiny lungs from bleach fumes.  The baby was entranced by the shield, and was poking his fingers at it with wide eyes.
“You don’t exactly have the best relationship with the press, Harry,” Hermione says.  “They published all sorts of terrible things about you in school, and they hounded you like crazy after the War until-”
One shelf, piled with a number of plush toys that had been Draco’s since he was small looked wrong.  The chimera was too close to the Hornback.  “Someone’s been in here,” he said, not registering that the words had been said out loud.  He quickly scanned the corners for shadows, and pulled Harry to stand behind him.
The ratios were perfect.  Draco knew this.  He’d checked and rechecked them so many times, that even Hermione got impatient.  “But if we just trialed it on one more rat,” Draco said.
They drank in silence for a while until Harry finally waved his cup at Draco.  “Good, this”, he muttered.
Hugo arrived, was greeted by all, and the Weasley-Grangers left soon after, having promised to meet Rose for dinner.
to defeat that snake-face arsehole only to keep allowing stupid things from the past to divide us,” Harry answers grimly.  He notices, with some approval, that Neville has spent most of the day clinging to Ginny like a limpet.  He hadn’t known that they were together, but it makes sense, and he is surprised that he isn’t jealous in the slightest.  The night ends on a surprisingly hopeful note, the group agreeing to meet at the Hog’s Head for a get together the following month.
“There you have it.  You seem to have no trouble in separating the child who needs protecting from the man who draws conflicting emotions.  I honestly don’t think you need to worry about this, Draco.  That’s my professional opinion as well as my personal one.  I still think that you’re needlessly making your recovery difficult, but I trust your judgement.  If this is the right thing for you, then I support you.”
I wonder again what foolish, hero Harry Potter would have done.  By every indication, I would never have let this baby Death Eaters thing go.  I would have had an enormous fight with Draco about it, and then I would have made Mill uncomfortable by all of the publicity over her sacking.  I can’t say that what I’m doing now is better…it’s certainly not helping people like Pansy Parkinson, but I don’t even remember her.  Why should I lose things in my life, things I like, for the sake of people I don’t even know?
She waved a hand cheerfully. “I have to eat anyhow, and Ron will be pleased to hear I’ve left the office for a change.”  Her smile dimmed a little.  “Draco, I wanted to let you know how sorry I am to hear of Scorpius’ illness.  It must be so difficult for you all.”
“Yes,” Hermione says.  “I just don’t want you to do anything drastic.  You’ve experienced a bit of trauma, and we don’t know how long before you’re feeling more like yourself.”
of this.  I can’t believe how much awful shit has happened to me.  Do you suppose I’m cursed?  Like, born under a rotten star or something?”
“And what do you expect him to do?” Draco demands, his face pale and angry.  “Ride into the Ministry on a Dragon?”
I don’t remember flooing home, but I must have.  I don’t remember whether I gathered my glasses and my wand, or my clothes, but they’re sitting on my lap, so I obviously did.  It takes me a long time to realize that I’ve been sitting for a while.  Long enough that I’m cold.  I crawl into my bed, and pull the covers around me.  I lay in the dark for a long time, the plaintive wail of a baby echoing through my head.  I don’t know much about baby ages, but certainly the child isn’t old enough to talk, right?  Otherwise, it would call for its Daddy.  Or Mommy.
Draco followed Harry into the hallway, and looked at him expectantly.  Harry smiled.  “I’ve been speaking with Cass, and she’s not ready to go home to Canada.  She’d like to stay a bit longer, if that was okay.”
Healer Cici’s owl arrived just before Draco was about to go to bed.  He untied the parchment from the unassuming owl’s leg, and it hooted once before disappearing back out the window.  The letter was short:
Harry shrugged miserably.  “It was the first thing he said.  She’s family.  You know how he is about that.  And my position is indefensible.  I didn’t tell him he had a daughter.  He has rights, Pansy.”  He stood.  “I’ve been waiting for this to happen for ten years.  At least I got some time with her.  I remember a lot from the first ten years of my life, I’m sure Cass will too.” Saying the words made him feel so suddenly lonely, that he said, “It’s been an awfully long day.  Are we finished for now?”
“Honestly, Ron, you have no sensitivity,” Hermione hisses.  Her tone wakes the snake, who has decided to come along and keep Harry company.
“I think she hopes that it won’t be required forever.  She’s desperate for Harry to propose.  I think, after the wedding, she’d planned to come clean, and hope that he’s grown to love her.”
“Not at all, Harry.  I’m pleased to help.”  He stands to leave, but stops when she continues speaking.  “For what it’s worth, I think that they meant well, even if they know nothing of subtlety.  I hope that you find it in yourself to forgive them in time.  They do love you.”
Cass waited.  Here’s the part where her Dad would ask her if she was doing okay.  If she was lonely.  What her number was.  But of course, Papa didn’t know about the numbers.  And, it seemed, that fancy people like the Malfoys didn’t talk much about feelings.  Rather than wait around for him to figure it out, she decided to fix things for herself.  “I’m a bit lonely for my Dad.  And since I can’t see him, I was hoping I could see someone who loved him.”  This seemed to make Papa look sad, but Cass was getting tired of trying to figure out what was going on with these people who never seemed to say what they were feeling.  “Could I visit my Auntie Hermione?”
“Off with you,” she waved a hand impatiently.  “I’d like to know exactly what you’re feeding my Goddaughter.  She’s so tall!”
“Just a little one,” I say, “but I don’t really want to take it over so much as burn it down.  I’m not fussed about what replaces it, though, so long as I don’t have to get involved.”
“I’m sorry, Harry, Cass has likely already gone home, but yes, you may leave if you want,” Miriam said.  “I’d like to speak with Draco for a little while anyway.”
“I’ll tell you a secret,” I say.  “I got cursed, and I’ve forgotten more than I remember.  It’s nothing personal.  I’ll remember you now.”
“I imagine it is,” Narcissa agreed.   “Tell me, is that Harry Potter being tended to by my Auntie Walburga’s house elf?”
Draco kissed his Mother’s cheeks, and sat to pour a cup of tea.  “Do you think she’ll be alright, with Lucius?”
“And how could I persuade you?” Draco didn’t mean for the teasing question to come out sounding suggestive, but once it was out there, he felt bold for a moment, and didn’t retract it.
“My blood has broken parts, and so it doesn’t make the right colours.” Scorpius was pleased to add to the conversation.
“Well,” he finally said, “since we’re best friends, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell anyone else.  Promise?”
But that wasn’t everything.  Certainly Harry had been humbled by his recent setbacks, but there was also a fundamental shift, somewhere at his core.  He was a little less accommodating than he once was.  He considered more before he spoke, and sometimes, if he wasn't sure, he’d simply decline to comment at all.  At his base level, however, he was still the same funny, quirky man that Draco fell in love with, and it was hard to watch him as he eked out inconsistent progress, week by week.
Draco set him to work chopping potions ingredients one afternoon.  Harry cheerfully said, “This is way more fun than making stew,” and applied himself with a diligence that Draco had never seen at Hogwarts.  Draco wondered whether Harry would have been as abysmal at potions if Snape hadn’t been so hard on him.  From what he could see, Harry blossomed like a flower under the faintest of praise.  When Draco corrected the way he was holding his knife, then said, “Good,” when his technique improved, Harry had given Draco one of those slow smiles and Draco had had to hold the edge of the table, his heart hurt so much for this child.
“Hermione seems very fixated on restoring your memories,” Luna says.  I’d suspected that she’d come to discuss this with me, but I don’t especially mind.  I’m curious about what she’ll say, if I’m being honest.  It will either be shockingly insightful, or completely mad, and I’d be glad of either.
He’d waited nearly a week, thinking it over, and deciding what he wanted to say.  When he finally approached the teacher, he was a mass of nerves, stumbling over his words, and unable to look her in the eye.  As he finished his stammering explanation, he chanced a look up through his fringe.  The teacher was looking carefully at him, and Harry allowed himself to feel a tiny thread of hope.  “Thank you for telling me this, Harry,” she said.  “I will look into it.”
“The super-ego works to control the id's impulses, especially the ones that aren’t considered socially acceptable.  It persuades us to do the right thing, even when no one is watching. It also has the function of persuading the ego to turn to moralistic goals rather than simply realistic ones and to strive for our ideal self.”
“No choice,” Astoria answered, shrugging.  “Also, we drink.  Quite a lot.”  Her smile demonstrated that it was a joke, but her eyes were sympathetic.
, Harry.”  Ron’s manhandling me through the club, and I am pretty sure that he and his wife are going to lecture me.  Ooo, but Malfoy’s following us, so maybe all isn’t lost.  We get out onto the street, which is deliciously cool, compared to the club.  I lift the tail of my shirt to mop off my brow, and Malfoy is looking at my stomach, and if I’m not mistaken, he’s back to being interested again.
Pansy’s face softened, and she pulled Harry into a hug.  “And I’ll deny saying this, but you’ve always been something kind of special, and you shouldn’t go trying to change who you are.”
“No, not in the slightest.  We’ll also hire a security firm who will ensure that they deal with any intrusive photographers or fans.”
“‘Course.”  Hermione is leafing through the book, and Draco is peering over her shoulder.  They go over the ritual together, and Hermione says, “I assume you have a ritual room?”  Draco nods.  “Alright, well, if you want to show me where it is, maybe Parkinson can help gather the things we’ll need.”
“My Grand-Mère,” Cass said, crossing the room to stand in front of Narcissa.  She smiled at her, and said, “My dad made me a photo album when I was little.  Your picture was always my favourite.”
“Yeah, Auror Administrator, and general all ‘round twat.  He couldn’t cut it in the Auror squad, so he bought himself his job.  But he’s the slipperiest of slippery bastards.  Very ‘by the book.’  It’s impossible to prove that he’s breaking the law, and the current bias against Dark families means that nobody would care about the way they’re being treated.”
When she returned to her seat, she took one of Harry’s hands.  “Harry, I’ll never be able to thank you for this.  I can’t begin to tell you how grateful I am.”
“Maybe,” Cass admitted, tousling his artfully arranged hair.  He glared at her, but she ignored him and said, “Dad, Auntie Min stopped me before I caught the train.”
I nod.  “I may regret it, but I just don’t fancy fighting anymore.  I want to do something that makes me happy.”
Harry rose, excused himself, and then stood by the floo, and waited, his face a bleak mask that revealed nothing.
“And how long will I be under investigation?” Draco asked, and he didn’t look angry, like Harry would have expected.  He looked defeated.
“No hits.  We don’t hit anyone here, Harry.  Nobody is going to hurt you here.  And if you get scared about something, it’s okay to ask.  You’re safe.  I don’t make promises easily, Harry, but I promise I’ll keep you safe.”  Harry considered this, but continued to watch Draco warily.  “I’d really like some company while I eat my lunch.  Do you think you could show me how well you eat?  Do you think you could eat two chicken nuggets?”  Harry finally nodded, and awkwardly climbed into the chair again.  He eyed his plate skeptically, and looked to Draco, but when Draco simply took his knife and fork and started to eat, he carefully reached out and took a chip.  He examined it for a long time, and watched Draco some more.  “It’s good.  I’d like you to try it,” Draco said conversationally.  When Harry finally started eating, Draco considered it a victory, even if one tiny hand gripped the edge of the plate as though afraid someone would snatch it away.
Harry managed a smile.  The time passed slowly, and Harry grew more and more frantic.  Astoria seemed to realize that Harry needed distraction, and before Draco knew it, they were playing a spirited game of ‘Fuck, Marry, Kill: Hogwarts Professor Edition.’
“Yes, Kreacher is Magical, just like you and I,” Draco explained.  Harry seemed confused by this, but, uncertain about how much a toddler could understand, Draco didn’t bother explaining.
Before long, Harry was making wobbly strides around the rink, but was already getting frustrated.  “How long before I can go fast?”
Of course, Harry didn’t answer the floo.  Instead, Neville Longbottom’s earnest face appeared in the flames.  “Malfoy,” he stated, less of a greeting than an observation.  Draco hadn’t remembered his face being so closed, so adult before.  Maybe this was just his 'Draco' face.
“You didn’t, Mother,” Draco hurried to reassure her.  “Even if you hadn’t been encouraging me to arrange the betrothal, I would still have left.  I wanted Harry to have the sort of life he deserved.”
The results, were, if anything, more discouraging than they were three days ago.  Harry was five years old, even though he was terribly malnourished, and his body bore traces of some suspicious injuries.  Nothing especially ominous, but a dislocated shoulder, and a large scar on his belly, which the scans helpfully pointed out were from a badly ruptured appendix.  He was in the fourth percentile for height and weight, which was supported by the fact that he was still tiny.  Draco didn’t spend a lot of time with five-year-olds, but even he could see that Harry was smaller than he ought to be.
Ron heads straight back to bed, and, with nothing to do and all exits, presumably, watched, there’s nothing left for me but to go to my own room, where I lie under the quilt, remembering silver eyes and a sexy smirk.
I feel myself grinning, heat climbing my neck, and clearly that’s a typical response, because Hermione just huffs, and says, “It’s time to go to the Burrow.”
, his mind corrected) had reached a point where they could politely interact in those strange years after the trials, but then…later, he’d gone out of his way to avoid her.  His mind started to go down the rabbit hole, remembering the past, and the things that Draco resolutely
“Oh.  Sorry.”  I kiss him on the end of his nose, and he smiles at me, and it’s so breathtaking that I can’t help but squeeze him tight.
“Yes you bloody were!” Ron shouts, and I’m a bit surprised, to be honest.  Ron seems so laid back that this seems out of character, and I’m wondering if he’s a homophobe.  That’s disappointing.  But then I remember that this bloke is that girl’s, Jenny or whatever, sister, and, alright, I suppose he’s a right to be annoyed.
“Harry.”  Ugh, why had Draco called him Harry? In a situation like, this, where all he wanted was to preserve some semblance of his dignity, the correct address was 'Potter'.
Draco was watching her intently, his eyes searching her face, her eyes, her hair, her hands.  “Hello Cass,” he said softly.
Feeling the tears threaten again, Draco wasn’t sure if he could, but after a tense silence, his looked up into Harry’s deep green eyes.  They were filled with uncertainty, and there was something that looked like dwindling hope.  “So do you?” Harry asked softly.  “Do you realize that I was trying to tell you that I’m in love with you?”
“Sure.  Ron told me that I used to have nightmares, and I don’t, anymore.  I don’t think I’d like being able to remember how many people used me as a weapon.  And with my memories, I’d have to relive killing people, and having people die.  It’s like a clean slate.”
“If you’ve convinced yourself you don’t need to be happy, fine, but did you really need to take Harry down with you?”
Harry instinctively stepped back, and Draco gaped at him for a moment.  “What are you doing here,” he finally asked.
“I am,” Harry says, and he rushes to his quarters, and wards the doors, and that ends his habit of seeking answers by wandering Hogwarts at night.
He escaped to the shower then, and stood under the steaming water with his head against the tile.  It was there, behind a silencing charm, that he finally gave way to the the wailing, grieving animal that had taken up residence inside of him.  He cried until the water went cold, and even then, as he turned off the faucet and sunk to the cool floor, his tears fell unchecked.  For a single, childish moment, he longed for his father.  His father, who, after finally being released from Azkaban wasn’t really himself any longer, and could certainly do nothing to help fix Draco’s child.  Then, he towelled himself off, and went to check on Scorpius again.
One of Harry’s thumbs went into his mouth the minute Hermione let go of his hands.  He didn’t look up, but quietly whispered, “Hullo.”
Harry flung himself onto the sofa on the opposite end from Draco, before roaring “Hannah!” and flinging every throw pillow he could reach onto the floor.  “Your fucking cushions are procreating!  This has to stop!”
“Excuse me, are you Harry Potter?”  Harry’s attention is diverted by a girl, no older than thirteen, a bit squat, acne riddling her cheeks.  She reminds Draco a little of Pansy, before she learned glamour charms and grew into her curves.
Harry blinked at Ron for a full twenty seconds.  “Well, it was fairly easy,” he said, “because kissing her made me feel scared and grossed out, and, messed up as I was then, even I knew that wasn’t supposed to happen.”
“Why are you doing this?” He asks a bit desperately, and the pleading tone in his voice startles him.  He notices that Ron and Hermione are watching him carefully, and as Luna and Hermione conduct a conversation through exchanged glances, he knows without question that this is part of some sort of unified effort.
And for a few months, that’s that.  The owls are repelled, the visitors are refused.  Harry stays in the castle, except for visiting Teddy, and Andromeda learns not to bring up Harry’s friends.  He knows that he’s being unfair, refusing everyone when Luna is the only one who actually spoke to him, but it’s not like nearly every single one of them hasn’t raised it at some point.  Harry’s tired of justifying himself, and he’s had enough of being pressured to do something for anyone’s greater good, even his own.
With a sigh, Harry climbed the stairs once again.  He crept to the side of the thin mattress again and said, “Malcolm?  Are you still awake?”
He seems to have lost most of the prickly formality that he was wearing like a cloak.  Emboldened, I continue, “So that’s where you come in.  I want your help in removing the curse, Draco.”
As he knocks on the door, he notices that his hands are shaking, but it doesn’t matter.  The woman who answers it is startlingly like Aunt Bellatrix in appearance, but has infinitely kinder eyes.  “Draco Malfoy?” Her tone isn’t welcoming, exactly, but it’s not angry either.
“So what does this have to do with my angry baby magic?” I ask, getting impatient.  Ron grins at me, just as invested in getting to the point.
Mill looks around with a truly apprehensive gaze.  “We can’t talk here, Harry.  Even if my spell is strong, I don’t know if there are listening spells in the Ministry that can override it.  It’s not safe.”
Jesus fucking Christ.  Why was this version of Harry so much more astute than the one Draco knew?  Maybe this was the sort of Harry you got when he wasn’t being abused, or stalked by a Dark Lord.  “In a way, yes.  My brain works a bit differently than most people.  I worry about people getting hurt, and sometimes I get a bit carried away.  It causes me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t ordinarily want to, in order to convince myself that they’re safe.”
But, it was watching her interact with Scorpius that gave Draco the most joy.  Scorp had accepted Cass’ inclusion in their family easily, and he followed Cass around like a duckling.  On the occasions where he was intractable, she could easily talk him around, and, since he’d recovered from his condition, he was finally able to learn to ride the broomstick that had become his most treasured possession.  Cass patiently flew with him, staying close to the ground, and correcting his form with loving encouragement.  She never grew tired of his incessant questions, and Scorpius had benefited from her dedication to schoolwork.  His own study habits had improved dramatically.
Draco steadfastly ignored the voice clamoring in his brain to warn him about what might happen to someone if the coffee pot wasn’t clean.  “Sure, if you like.  I’m just going to go tidy myself up a little.”
“You’ve always challenged me, Draco.  You drive me mad, and fascinate me in equal measure.  It wasn’t a conscious decision, but looking back, I can see that it kept me alive.  It took me ages to realize that I was in love with you, but once I did, I committed to it with every bit of myself.  I was determined that, if I just tried hard enough, I could win your love, and have a reason to live.
He hesitated before unrolling the (much smaller) parchment from Harry.  He know that it might be full of Harry’s vitriol, and he wasn’t looking forward to any of the much-deserved criticism that Harry might be levelling on him.  Eventually, though, the anxiety of not knowing grew too great, and with a sigh, he unrolled it.
“Excellent, Draco.  That’s amazing progress.  I wondered, though, what does this have to do with Harry?”
“Ron and Rose and I were going to go home to our house.  We have plenty of space for you, and Rose would love to play with you.  Would you like to come with us?”
Draco glares at her.  “This is an abomination of a research study, and an abysmal violation of Harry’s human rights.  How could you possibly be a party to this?”  I don’t think I’ve seen Draco look so furious, and so sad, and considering what’s happened so far today, that’s saying something.
It’s almost over, Harry tells himself.  He’s decided to renovate the top floor of Grimmauld, and the sheer amount of dark objects he’s unearthed has him at a loss.
He was so immersed in his actions that he didn’t hear the door open, and it wasn’t until Harry’s voice said his name that he realized he wasn’t alone.  Without thinking, his heart leapt, and he smiled at Harry, before realizing that Harry wasn’t his to smile at any longer.  He felt the expression fall from his face, and grabbed a towel from the pile next to the treadmill.  As he scrubbed himself with the rough material, he battled the paradox of Harry being so here, but so distant.  As he managed to get his features cooperating, he banished the towel to the laundry and tried to produce a more normal facial expression.
Draco has never been to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, but Harry keyed him into the wards over a year ago, telling Draco that he was welcome anytime.  At the time, Draco had thought it another stupid joke, but the door opens easily, and he realizes that Harry has been going to so much effort to prove to Draco that things were different, that he trusted Draco.  The thought makes Draco want to weep with shame and guilt, but he tells himself that he’ll indulge later.
“Papa, I was hoping that I could take Harry into the back room, and let him try the newest flavour.”
“This is mad.  We’re never going to be able to see things the same way.  If you insist on believing that you didn’t take the coward’s way out, I don’t really think we have much to talk about.”
Draco’s eyes widened.  “No!” Hermione rushed to continue.  “No, nothing like what you’re thinking.  The opposite, in fact.  We had a lot of time to talk, and one night Harry confessed to me that had some questions about his sexual inclinations.”
I bend over him, my hands skirting down his sides, as I lick the side of his neck, suck on his earlobe.  “I want to taste you,” I breathe into his ear, my breath hot.  It takes no time to kiss and suck my way back down his body, unbuckling his belt and popping the buttons of his denims.  As I peel open the placket, his cock is hard, the head peeking over the waistband of his pants.  I can’t help but lap at the precome at his slit, and when I prod with my tongue, he whimpers.  I don’t have to tell him to lift his hips, and I peel his jeans down to his thighs.  The room is quiet, and I can hear him panting, his breath roaring out of his chest.  I feel powerful, and, for the first time since all this stupidness began, like I’m in control of what’s going on.
“I did try a new thing.  I tried not shouting at you for climbing the cabinets like a monkey, and look where that’s gotten me.”
, Cass, by everyone who ever meets you.  And you are going to live, because I can’t even understand a world that doesn’t have you in it.  I’ve died before, and if I have to do it again to drag you back here, I will.”
“I’m sure I don’t know,” I reply.  “I’m probably the worst person to ask, really.  But I can’t imagine that the person we’ve invested the most trust in should be allowed to continue leading us.  Not after he’s turned a blind eye to the unfair suffering of children in Dark-aligned families.  And the Department of Mysteries needs an overhauling.  We can’t allow that sort of power to go unchecked.”
“Shut up, Potter, I’m thinking,” Draco says crossly, and immediately regrets it, since Harry’s face falls, and takes on an expression that Draco hasn’t even seen before.  And then Draco realizes that he doesn’t
“You may as well call me Ron, since we’re in this up to our necks.  I’d say he’s about 15 months or so.”
“You realize that I’m not exactly impartial?”  I nod.  Draco steps to the pensieve and removes Hermione’s memories before raising his wand to his forehead and extracting a silvery strand, which he places in the basin.  “Come,” he says gently.
“Things got worse, as time went by.  I decided that it wasn’t worth pretending anymore.  I went to Diagon, intending to get some poison on Knockturn.”  He looks at Draco, his eyes impossibly green.
“I’m good, Draco,” she confirmed.  The question-and-answer confirmation (“You good?”, “I’m good”) had become a coping strategy that the entire family had used throughout Scorpius’ childhood.  When he’d been born, so tiny and fragile, and as he’d coped with so many little illnesses and frailty, the reassurance that they were okay gave them courage.  As he’d finally been diagnosed last year with the disease that threatened his life, Draco hadn’t been prepared to become an expert in rare blood disorders, hadn’t been prepared, after having feared for his life throughout his adolescence, to now know a terror so much greater.
He was nearly finished collecting potion residue when the owl arrived, a shrunken bundle of baby supplies tied neatly to its claw.  Draco unpacked the supplies gratefully, and spelled a diaper immediately onto the sleeping form.
He moved on to Mrs. Sanders, and, once his suspicions had been validated, he proceeded to make a series of complicated wand movements that would transfer the memories directly to the recording cube.  The couple was watching him intently from their places on the sofa, terror obvious in their expressions.  Harry ignored them, methodically calling for an apprehension squad who would take them in for more extensive questioning, and, if required, proceed with legal actions.  Harry then conjured his Patronus and smiled thinly as Prongs erupted from his wand, scanning the room for danger.  “Lu,” Harry said.  “I’ve one for you, tonight if possible.  Let me know.”  Prongs bowed his head and bounded through the nearest wall.  Presently, a shimmering hare bounded through the wall and said, “I’ll put the kettle on, Harry.”
“It’s still very new, Andy,” Harry said with a soft smile.  “You’re actually the first person we’ve told.  It’s going to be a bit of a surprise.  Draco and I weren’t exactly friendly during school.”
From the hallway, Draco could hear a disgruntled, but slightly familiar voice lamenting, “…but why does she only bloody wake up when I come in?  It’s like the old bint
It had been, frankly, a terrible few days, and Harry was feeling the strain.  He hadn’t really prepared himself for being here.  He’d known that the press would be terrible, and he’d feared that his family would hate him.  They hadn’t, of course, but the relationship was strained, different.  It was impossible to resume as though things were the same as they'd been a decade before.  He hadn’t expected to find himself in legal trouble, even if the reporter had been happy to settle for a written apology and a generous payment for pain and suffering.  The medical procedure had been the worst, obviously, and if he allowed himself to think too long about how close he’d come to losing Cass, his knees got weak.
I know I need to decide what to do next.  Why would I want to stay in the Magical world, a place where I’m feared and watched with suspicion?  Where my best friend makes poorly researched decisions that affect my future without giving me any input on them?  There are things that I like about the magical world, and there’s nothing like the heady buzz I feel when the magic runs down my arm and through my wand.  But the people here seem to see me as nothing more than a tool, a symbol.  I wonder if the old me enjoyed the fame and attention of being the Boy who Lived.  The cabin in the woods is starting to look more and more like my only option.
“Yes, Potter, I slipped, and I’m sorry.  I feel completely stupid, and I’d give anything to undo it.”
When everyone had regained their composure, Harry made sure they all had a seat, and some tea, and said, “I know you likely have a lot of questions for me, and I’ll answer them all, but there’s someone I want you to meet.”
Cass looked confused, and Harry jumped in to say, “Cass and I live in Canada, and the school system works a little bit differently there.  Cass is nearly ten, and so she’s in grade five.  Children in our district stay in the same school until grade eight, and then move on to secondary school.  She goes to a neighbourhood school, and she is doing very well.”
I throw him a grateful look, and say, “Yeah, alright.  I’ll just…” I wave vaguely at the direction of the spare room, and go throw on a pair of trackies and a t-shirt.
Mrs. Powers made a strangled sound.  Harry sighed.  “I know it’s hard, and I know you’re frightened, but your choice is simple.  Not easy, but simple.  You can accept that Violet has a gift, and support her as she learns it, or you can try to suppress it, and risk losing her completely.  Violet wants her magic, and she’ll feel conflicted if she knows you don’t approve.”
Molly was a little indignant that her tea was being refused, but George said smoothly, “Settling a bet, back in a tick,” and shepherded them through the kitchen and out the back door as quickly as they’d entered.
, needs him like air, and sunshine, food.  Deciding that this isn’t a productive line of conversation, he finally shakes his head.
Stir craziness sets in after a few hours.  I debate calling Kreacher back, but he’s not the best conversationalist, and a quick poke around confirms that I haven’t any alcohol in my flat.  I need a drink, and I need to be distracted from the unpleasantness.  I shower and dress, and find myself at the apparation point in Diagon before an hour has passed.  The Leaky Cauldron is right there, and I can’t be bothered to try to find a different pub.  This one has drink, I’m certain, and that will do for now.
There didn’t seem much more to say.  Somehow during the telling of the story, they’d sat on the floor, leaning against the foot of the bed, not looking at one another.  Draco sat silently, finally unburdened of the terrible reasons that had chased him halfway across the world.  He felt empty.  It didn’t fucking matter.  Harry knew now, that Draco hadn’t wanted to leave, but Draco
“No, I can’t imagine that it will either.  But I have to try, even if it’s just to let you know that…well…I don’t know…”
“Not really.  I still think that this is the right thing to do.  He seems shocked that someone would take him in, actually.  I think his Muggles abused him.”
“It’s your choice, of course, but I had to promise Pansy that I’d hide out in the Castle for the next few days.  If you were with Papa, you could go to Diagon Alley, spend some time with Scorpius.  Maybe he’d take you flying.”
“Harry, no.  Is that what they told you?”  Harry nodded, a wrinkle appearing between his fine eyebrows.  “No, Harry, your mum and dad were really good people.  They weren’t drunk, I’m positive.  I don’t even think they had a car.”
“Harry,” he said, looking down at his hands, trying to be kind, despite the disappointed voice inside him that was wailing in dismay “I…” He sighed, examined his hands again, and tried once more.  “I care about you so much…”
,” Harry said, his tone turning a bit pleading.  “I didn’t want to wreck things for you, and Cass and I, we would have complicated things so much.  I know that I didn’t fit in to your image rehabilitation plans, and I told myself that Cass didn't either.  I mean, I didn’t really think of much, right then.  I was a bit...upset, but I’ve thought about it since then.”
“Bill and Charlie built it before they went to Hogwarts, but we all used to play there.  It was just over the hill, beyond the orchard.  By the time all of the boys were big enough to ride brooms, we forgot about it, but you know how Mom was.  She wouldn’t let Gin fly until she was nine, and even then only on a training broom.  So Gin adopted the fort as her playhouse.  Made Dad ward it so that no boys could get in.”
For a moment, Draco felt a jolt of panic.  Unable to read the tone from the brief note, Draco was fearful that he’s read the situation all wrong.  Maybe Harry was eager to banish all of Draco’s property from his home.  But then wouldn’t he have just wrapped up the jumper and sent it to the Manor without the note?  Also, Draco wasn't even sure he'd been wearing a jumper that night. Well, regardless, an invitation was an invitation, and, whether it was folly or not, Draco was committed.
“Yeah,” she whispers.  “Yeah, I do.”  She looks down at her tiny little hands, and bursts into tears, which are, thankfully, short-lived.  I pull her close and hold her until she stops.  “Fuck,” she says, half-laughing, and sniffs a bit wetly.  She’s one of those girls that looks pretty when she cries.  “Did we just break up?”
It wasn’t long before Rose got cranky, and Hermione had to get her home to nap.  Draco sat, finishing his tea, and pondered the situation.  That was when the idea came to him.  He’d give it one last try, and if it didn’t work out, at least he’d know.
His smile is molten gold, and I can’t breathe.  I feel myself step closer to him, and I can’t help but touch him.  I smooth his hair away from his face, and grip the back of his neck, pulling him in to kiss him.  The friction of our tongues is bliss, and I think I might die if I don’t get his naked body against mine.  I don’t hear the spell he uses to remove the clothes from our bodies, but that's now two spells I want to ask him about later.  Later, when I’m no longer sucking a red mark on his beautiful, pale neck.  I pull him close, apparate us both to my bedroom, and push him down onto the bed.
“Can’t I just come to say hello?”  The look on his face suggests that, no, coming to say hello is unwelcome.  “Alright, fine, I’m here because I need your help with something.”
“I’m fine.  You worry about you, okay?  Get strong and healthy, and enjoy getting to know your family, and think about what you’d most like for your birthday.”
They barely look at one another as they stumble into clothing.  They both know that this is goodbye.
“Yep, I’m fine.  We’re safe.  A promise is a promise.”  Harry’s smile was brilliant.  Very slowly and gently, Harry raised his hand and touched Draco’s cheek.  “It’s okay, Draco, I’ll take care of you.”
“It’s pretty.”  Harry reaches a tentative finger towards the delicate crystal amulet, and Draco slaps it away.  “Sorry.”  He grins sheepishly.
to stop hugging Cass.  His normally tactile child was getting uncharacteristically irritated by how often Harry was holding her hand, or kissing her forehead. But every time he looked at her, he saw her, tiny and still, in her hospital bed, and he needed to remind himself that she was fine.
Draco quickly made tea, and handed Harry a cup.  “Is there somewhere we can go where we won’t be interrupted?”
“You’ve had time to find a suitable wife on your own, Draco.  I don’t have to tell you that a great deal is at stake.  You’re a man now, and it’s time for you to meet the responsibilities of your family.  You’re a Malfoy, my Dragon, and it has never before been so important for you to marry well, marry respectably.”
At precisely ten to seven, I arrive at the Golden Cauldron, belatedly realizing that I should have made a reservation.  I smile at the host, and say, “I’m an idiot.”
“If you want someone to listen,” Hermione offered.  She’d conjured some bright yellow birds, and they were flying just out of Harry’s reach.  He was laughing, and trying to catch one.  As Draco looked on, he stared at his feet for a moment, then looked back at the birds.  He bounced on his heels, but, when that didn’t have the desired effect, his brow wrinkled, and he levitated off the ground a few inches, just enough to snatch one of the birds out of the air.
He looks wretched.  “The more people who know about this, the better chance they’ll do something awful to Scorpius.”
Of course he sees.  “Harry, I can’t do this to you.  We’re breaking our hearts, doing this.  It’s never going to be easier.”  He stands, spells himself clean with a harsher than needed Scourgify.  “I can’t come back, Harry.  It’s too hard.”  He stops for a moment at the doorway, his face immeasurably sad.  “Be happy, Harry.”
“Ah shite,” I say.  “This bloke probably doesn’t know that my memory’s gone.  Now he’ll think I’m ignoring him.”
“Saved by laziness,” I respond lightly.  “I get why this is such a jarring difference, though,” I finally continue.  “That bloke in the memory, he’s nothing
“Yes.  Your dad saw the paperwork, and I’m sure that he thought that I’d been trying to trick him all along.  I don’t know for sure how that made him feel, but I have a good idea.  I think that he was already afraid that he wasn’t doing a good job as your parent, and when he concluded that I planned to sue you, he signed the papers, and he left.”
“Kreacher is understanding.  Kreacher will be creating the most romantic dinner, and Master Harry can woo his new paramour.”
“Freud thought that much of mental life happens beneath our awareness, and that past experiences, especially in early childhood, shape how a person feels and behaves throughout life,” Draco says.
“So it keeps us from wanking during long meetings,” Ron supplies.  Hermione cringes but nods her head.
“What’s going on?” Draco asked.  He was still uncomfortable at the way he'd lost his composure during his panic attack the day before, and didn’t really know how to get past it.
“So you going all 'red mist' on someone who makes you mad isn’t something you did when you were younger?”  Greg was grinning now.
“Tell that to Katie Bell,” Draco replied.  “Or Vincent Crabbe, or Albus Dumbledore, or Madam Rosemerta, or Ron Weasley, or…”
“Either.  Both.  I took myself to the Leaky Cauldron yesterday, and got too drunk.  I felt awkward about calling you guys to get me home, so Hannah called Draco.  He took me to his house, and I learned, at an inopportune moment, that he has a family.”
“Oh, Harry.  I need to tell you something really important,” Draco said.  “Your Aunt and Uncle were wrong about a lot of things.  Little boys shouldn’t have to make breakfasts, and they should have a nice comfortable bed to sleep in.  And,” Draco said firmly, “they shouldn’t ever be hit or treated roughly.”  A little indrawn breath confirmed Draco’s suspicion.
“I did.  And it took me a long time to realize that it wasn’t my fault.  She didn’t hurt me because I was bad, or deserved it or anything.”
.  “You’re an excellent Auror, Harry.  You have natural leadership abilities, and a strong moral compass.  You’re being hired based on your merits.”
“Yes.”  The hawk is still soaring in the sky, and we watch it in silence for a while.  “Did you know, Mister Potter, that Draco’s favourite story, as a child, was the story of the Enchanted Ring?  Do you know that one?”
“They have.  But I was under the impression that he stood trial, and was absolved of his misdeeds.  I thought that I myself testified to his actions, ones that directly impacted the outcome of the War.  Is there a case being built against him now?”
The pizza arrived, and soon, they were sitting at the table.  Cass had outdone herself with pizza ingredient selection, and Harry was looking at it in consternation.  “What are these little strips?  Why do they look like fish?”
He blinks at me a bit, and then huffs in annoyance.  “Fine.  Seven tonight.  I’ll owl you the address.”
“Could it be the spell?” Ron wonders out loud.  “Maybe it’s like a love potion.  Remember Romilda Vane?  That potion had me convinced I was mad for her, and I’d never even met her.”
“So now what?” Hermione said expectantly.  “You’re, I assume, no longer a prisoner in your own home.  What will you do next?”
“Well, it’s not bad, but a little unexpected.  Cass is a bit bigger than Scorpius, and I’d expect her to metabolize the sleeping draught more quickly.  She’s never had one before, correct?”
“I just got defensive.  I don’t like feeling like an idiot, and I don’t think she sees me as capable.”
Still, he was acutely aware that time was running out.  Draco feared what would happen when Cass’ birthday was over.  He knew that Harry had an entire life in Canada, but he wanted them to stay.  Draco had passed up on the chance ten years ago, but he was becoming despondent at the idea that he'd miss this chance.  If Harry went home now, Draco was pretty sure that he'd be allowed to maintain ties with his daughter, but it wasn't enough.  He needed Harry to stay, to give them a second chance.  He just didn’t know how to ask.
“There’s something else,” I say finally.  “Separate from all this, I want to start up a scholarship program to give young people more opportunities.  I found out that there are kids living in Knockturn Alley who don’t end up going to Hogwarts because they can’t afford books.  And I know someone who wants to go to university, but she isn’t sure if her parents can afford the fees.”
As Draco massaged the potions onto his Mother’s temple, he heaved a sigh.  It was a thoughtful gesture, so like Harry.  Narcissa sighed, and Draco thought that the tight lines around her eyes eased some.  Granger really was a clever witch.
