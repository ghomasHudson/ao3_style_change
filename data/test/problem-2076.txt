“As you wish.”
Draco had realised he’d never stopped caring for Harry when Bellatrix asked him to identify him under the stinging jinx. By then, he also knew he needed to keep Harry alive if he was to have any chance of surviving and seeing an end to the Dark Lord.
Draco couldn't help the smile that spread across his face. “Wonderful. All right, I’ll go and book the function room now.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Can you perform the counter jinx me or what?"
Harry leaned across the table. “What do you think you're doing? Put that stuff away now. You can't use
With Draco still pinning his arms in place, Harry used his legs and hips to find the most pleasurable positions for rubbing their bulges together. When Draco couldn’t take it anymore, he turned Harry around and pinned both of his arms above his head with one hand, while he used his other to unzipped Harry's jeans and pushed them, with his underwear, down past his knees. From there they proceeded to fall to his ankles.
“Is that a challenge?”
“I would like to be informed when Harry makes contact with the Office while he’s away,” Draco said, getting straight to the point.
you requested
“Okay,” Harry agreed.
“Yes. Really. Now, turn over,” Draco ordered, pushing at Harry’s shoulder. Harry readily obeyed.
“So, why did you want me here exactly?” Potter asked when the bartender was out of earshot. Draco noticed he had removed his accessories as well and unbuttoned enough of his coat to reveal the top of a blue knitted jumper. “If you brought me here just to show off, I can tell you now I’m not that impressed.”
Ankles crossed atop his desk, Draco lounged back in his reclined chair and reflected on a successful end to his latest assignment.
Better not pout
Harry sighed. "I'll try." He blinked and Draco was gone.
“Oh, right. Like this.” Harry placed each of the mini speakers in his ears. “I'll work the MP3 for now.” He removed the buds from his ears and offered them again to Draco. This time Draco accepted them, casting a quick cleaning spell over them and fitting one bud into each of his ears just as Harry had.
“You’re serious?”
“A week,” Potter exclaimed.
"Told you," Hermione said with a smug grin.
“He might… if the seats aren’t in a corporate box. Although then you would need to go incognito…”
By the end of November, Harry had given up trying to ask Draco directly and decided he would try to obtain some answers from McGonagall instead.
“Yes, it is.”
“So you
Harry turned his head to look at Draco. His green eyes were piercing and his expression stern. “You know I can’t talk about it.”
“It’s almost as if he knows.” Harry half-whispered the words behind his tea before he drunk some of it.
Draco hardly paid any attention to what Harry was saying. He had been admiring his figure instead. He still couldn’t get over how sexy Harry looked in his black and purple Auror robes and how the purple played with the green of his eyes, even in the growing dark. They’d been Auror partners for a couple of years. But only a few months had passed since he’d taken the courage to make the move he had been sure Potter kept hinting at but never followed through with. He hadn’t been disappointed.
“If you wouldn’t mind. Otherwise you are quite welcome to leave.”
"I'd prefer to wait for Healer Malfoy."
“If you’ll wait here, I’ll be back in a few minutes,” Amelia said.
Draco picked up the menu and looked for dishes that were the same or similar to the function menu. “I’ll have the rib-eye and you should choose between the fish and the chicken.”
Gwen thought about it for a few more seconds before moving the tray towards Harry. “Thank you,” Harry said as he lifted the tea and made a direct line for the table at which Draco was seated.
“Yes,” said Granger pointedly. “It’s addressed to you, isn’t it?”
“Apparently he wasn’t there.”
“Maybe I should go check on the wards,” Harry said to Draco as they sat on a park bench down the road from their suspect’s storage shed. They were both under disillusionment charms.
"I'm not sure Narcissa does. And Draco's doesn't mean much if he was coerced or brainwashed into accepting it," Harry replied.
She had a good point. “So where is Ron?”
Seeing Draco on Platform 9 and ¾ before they boarded the train to return to Hogwarts had surprised Harry, but he soon realised they likely had similar motives for returning. One of them being a means to escape the media and most of the public scrutiny that was so prevalent after Voldemort's death.
Draco goes to glare but remembers he's talking to Nott, and settles for a very pointed look. "We were both in the hospital wing."
"Do you know who's staying and all that?" Ron asks.
After a series of Potter/Malfoy insults spoken right over their heads during lunch, they were quite wary. Theo was starting to loathe the headmistress with a passion.
Blaise's head pops up from behind Theo. He snorts, going back to his meal. "He and Harry made up."
The eponymous Madam walked in a few moments later carrying two rolls of fabric, one dark grey and the other white; the Falcon’s colours. “Stand on one of the platforms please,” she requested.
“I thought you put a
“You really don’t want to help me, do you Granger?”
“Surely if you can't tell me about your new case and your best friend's are trying to-what?” Harry had kicked his thigh and Draco could see his narrowed eyes above his mug as he drank his tea slowly. “Alright, fine. Lionel called in sick, so I had to man the shop by myself. Which would normally have been okay, but the owls must have delivered the Hogwarts letters yesterday because I had at least thirty students in for new robes or alterations. McGonagall really needs to start warning the shop owners in Diagon Alley about when she is sending those ruddy things out so we can make sure our shops are adequately staffed.”
Harry lowered his eyebrows at Draco, but did as he was told and made himself cough.
“But-”
“Ready to head back to the office?” Harry asked, returning his empty cup to the table.
“Wonderful.” This was far easier than Draco had expected. “Would we be able to see the room, please?”
Draco shrugged. “You don’t seem disgusted by it. You actually seem to rather enjoy going along with it just as much as I do At least, you never try and stop me, or try to correct them for that matter.”
Draco felt Harry wrap his arms around his waist and drew himself in so he was flush against Draco’s back. “Hermione and Ron are getting to me,” Harry said with a sigh and rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
“How could they send him away alone at this time of year?”
“If I must,” Snape sighed.
Harry made himself look away from Draco and the other wizard and back to Ron. “No, it's okay. We can finish our tea.”
Harry knew he needed to stop thinking about Draco being so dismissive of him when he was only trying to help, but it was hard when the prat was standing on the other side of the room. When he thought about the robin’s transformation into a mop, his mind kept going back to his broom and the feeling of Draco holding onto him for dear life as he flew them to safety. Did Draco have to be in mortal danger to accept help from him?
helped put him there. So really, I don’t know why I’m even bothering to be your friend at all." Draco tried to walk away, but Harry sidestepped to block him and pushed him back.
“But… that means Hobson wants to have the celebration next week. How am I supposed to organise a non-magical celebration for wizards and Muggles in a week? And by myself?”
Harry folded the paper and placed it on the table, then turned in his chair enough to wrap his arms around Draco’s chest. Draco felt his warmth and instantly melted into Harry, abandoning his breakfast for the moment. He turned his head and was met with Harry’s lips on his. The heat in their kisses, even after four months together, still surprised Draco. Harry pulled away sooner than Draco would have liked, but he knew there would be more where that came from later that night.
“Narcissa saved me given the opportunity. I don’t think Lucius would have done the same. He deserves whatever he gets.”
“That is weird,” said Albus. “My dad’s barely said a word about yours. Don’t think he wanted people to know because he was surprised when I mentioned it before.”
"I believe you mean, Malfoy."
Harry finally shifted his gaze from Draco to his best friend. “Yes?”
“It’s hard to say.”
As Draco started to unbutton Harry’s shirt, he felt familiar hands starting to explore his own clothed torso. Stopping what he was doing, Draco combed his fingers through the thick black hair back and leant forward for a quick snog before slapping the wandering hands away. “If you won’t tell me anything, you don’t get to touch.”
The healer left, Harry assumed, in search of Draco as he waited patiently cradling his arm. He had his head down and eyes closed trying to concentrate on breathing and thinking of anything besides the pain that was radiating from his dislocated shoulder.
"We are talking about Draco, right?" Harry scanned the room until he found the grey eyes staring at him. They only stayed on him for a few more seconds before Draco looked away, pretending to read his textbook.
“Oh, that’s right. It’ll be your first Christmas together since you became a couple, won’t it?” She enthused.
Harry was determined to give evidence at the Malfoy trials. He had saved Draco from the fiendfyre for a reason and he wasn’t about to let him wither away in Azkaban because of his parents choices. Harry believed actually becoming a Death Eater and seeing first hand what it entailed had changed Draco’s perspective on the propaganda Lucius had filled his head with while he was growing up.
“It would be unusual,” Harry stated.
“Thank you,” Harry said before returning the gesture. Draco placed a hand on Harry’s neck and deepened the kiss. He felt Harry maneuver his hand under the bottom of his trouser leg and start caressing the bare skin at his ankle.
Draco shrugged. “You looked tense and it was an easy place to start?”
“Well…” Draco said, sounding a little breathless. “Should we make our way up to the Great Hall for the feast?”
The music changed again.
As the week progressed, Draco began voluntarily entering into small talk with Harry before and during classes. They never spoke about the trial or the outcome, generally focusing on things happening at Hogwarts.
“Arms out, dear,” directed Madam Malkin.
Harry thought for a moment, then said, “Hermione could look after the music. She works in your department.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry replied, smile seemingly plastered on his face.
Harry looked up to where the past Headmaster’s portraits hung and was glad to see Snape was present in his, looking down at him with his usual scowl. He hesitated before stuttering, “Hh-hh-hi Professor Snape.”
“Doesn’t mean I want the responsibility.”
to do it,” Harry admitted. “But, I would
“Right.”
“Aren’t you going to explain what you were talking about with the Muggle woman?” Draco replied as he replaced his scarf and gloves, watching Potter do the same.
“Oh, did she now?” Harry’s tone was such that Draco was sure this conversation would get back to Hermione. “And what about her experience? I’m sure she would be much more useful than me. Plus she actually works in your department.”
Draco started, his eyes widening and his head turning to look at Harry. What? Had he heard that correctly? Their eyes met.
“I felt like a nice lunch out, and this place isn’t really Ron’s style. I thought you would appreciate it, even though it isn’t run by wizards. And you should know that Ron and I are followed in the Alley just like you and Harry are, we just don’t do anything newsworthy most of the time. So it’s much more relaxing when you don’t have to worry about being watched while you eat lunch.”
Harry sighed and sunk further into the couch, flopping his head back on the cushion. “I got a new case on top of the five others I’m currently working on AND the application for Head Auror is due at the end of this week.”
“Hello Potter.” Malfoy tried for an even tone, but the habit of spitting out Harry’s last name was too ingrained. Then Draco remembered the first time he had ever met Harry, right here in this shop, not knowing who he was at the time.
Hermione gave him a pointed glare, then shook her head and turned sharply on her heels and walked out.
“Thank you Professor Malfoy,” Eoin said and rushed for the door, bumping into Harry's side in the process. The boy turned back with a frightened look on his face. Harry smiled down at him, watching recognition wash across Eoin’s features before he returned the smile and continued out the door and up the hall.
“It's okay, Eoin. No one did it perfectly and you're still learning.”
"No, it's his day off."
Harry let out a small chuckle. “That would have been more creative. The latest stories have been a bit dull. They seem to have toned down on the more outlandish ones since Hermione had that ‘chat’ with the Editor. She really didn’t appreciate the article that insinuated we were romantically involved with her too.” It hadn’t even been that much of a scandal, the Wizarding World had an odd lack of prejudice against who or how many you slept with considering how worried they all were about blood purity.
"Does this mean you have a break for Christmas this year?"
“Well, we can’t always have everything the way we like it now, can we?”
Draco nodded. “Thursday.”
Harry glared at Ron. “What?” His friend responded.
“Are you able to tell him I’m here though?”
“Would you like one?” Harry immediately wished he could take that offer back.
“You don’t have to, Professor.”
Harry felt as if he could kiss him, but didn’t think he was ready to do that just yet. Instead, he leaned down and whispered in Draco’s ear. “Thank you.”
going to put that application in then?” Draco asked as he began to disrobe.
“I better do it since we have to use Muggle money.” Harry pushed his chair back as he stood, then strode over to the bar.
Draco found a small, empty examination room and the instrument to calibrate his wand for the scan. The procedure involved an up close and personal whole body scan with the wand, which left traces where there was significant build up of Dark magic residue, either from exposure or use. Harry was glad he was wearing loose robes or he was sure Draco would have noticed what his close proximity, as well as his pulsing magic, was doing to him.
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco as the blonde poured his tea. “You mean…”
“To eavesdrop? I'm sure you didn't, but you did anyway. I really thought we were past all this.”
The owls arrived with the mail at breakfast as usual and Harry felt the lump in his throat as he reminded himself that Hedwig would not be among them again. The beginning of their make-up Seventh Year had been a big adjustment after the end of the Second War as everyone tried to go back to normality. But how was Harry supposed to do that when he was even more famous than before.
"Oh…" Harry said, disappointed Draco was leaving so soon.
I’d been studying from Snape’s personal library since they finally let me move into his home after the Ministry closed their investigation.” Draco paused, looking down for a moment before raising his head again and focusing his steely grey eyes on Harry. “Then there is you. I don’t think you even realise the effect you have on people… the effect you’ve had on me.”
"You don't remember?" Theo smirks.
comments, kudos, and bookmarks completely brighten my day, so thanks if you did any of them! there's only the epilogue left! :)
"I woke up, nearly naked, in my bed, with a shirtless Ronald Weasley only a meter away from me on the ground," he moans, "and I've no idea what happened."
"Of course I didn't tell her!" Theo exclaims. "But somehow she already had a vague idea. I've no idea..."
bought him that shirt not even a week ago, with an anonymous note saying:
"Because he's a sadistic bastard, and would love to see anyone desperate, even his best friend," he says, offhandedly.
Luckily, Theo knows that both of his dorm mates are in the dorm.
"I'm a Legilimens," Malfoy says, seriously. Harry recoils, swiftly, and Malfoy rolls his eyes. "I'm joking, Potter." His eyes narrow, mischievously. "But what have you to hide?"

By the time they return, Theo's ready for his shower and his nightly visit to Blaise's.

"How the bloody hell did he finish so quickly?" Blaise gapes at the clean common room.
But all they wanted was for him to be engaged in the Dark Arts so he can become a little Death Eater like them, then join the Dark Lord's ranks, then have little Death Eater children with some pure-blood wife that was probably a Death Eater, too, but all that got him was a bad reputation and them a life sentence in Azkaban.
Draco huffs, but a small smile is on his lips. "Yes, Theo.
"Really? Hmm. Thought I was one of the few," he trails, looking back at Ron, who hasn't looked away.
Davis spins it, and, ironically, has to snog Gryffindor Dean Thomas, who looks a little dazed but the game continues. Finnegan sulks.
"Homophobic," Potter finishes, smiling, weakly. "Not at all."
It's quiet in their section of the common room for a while before everyone except the former rivals start buckling over with laughter.
Harry blinks even more before nodding a million times. "I— I will. I will!" Even when he's out the door, you can hear his calls. "Malfoy! Malfoy!
Hermione chuckles. "Yes, Pansy and I are dating."
Pansy sees them first.
Blaise then visibly perks up. "Okay, Ron. Spin my shiny, long, beautiful wand."
It was so blunt, Hermione — who always sees everything — would've never approved of the approach, because of all of the possible reactions.
"Oh. Well, tell him all the luck, and that I can't come over tonight because 'Mione and I are doing... something." Weasley clears his throat.
Theo snorts. "Come on, Longbottom. You're a handsome guy! You've got those good... Gryffindor traits, and girls are falling over their feet for you!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's still a stupid name, and it doesn't even qualify for this conversation," Ron mumbles, then speaks clearer. "Obviously, 'Mione. Harry's confused and Malfoy probably thinks that he's acting that way because he found out."
His father was locked up, now. He didn't have to worry about being...
Harry shuts his eyes and feels Ron's comforting hand on his shoulder. "He's gay," Harry whispers, throat dry.
Theo rolls his eyes and glances at his clothes. His grey shirt and tight, Muggle, denim jeans that Blaise bought him look nice. He doesn't look too shabby, though he's never considered himself very attractive.
Hermione glares at him and huffs. "I don't look
" She licks her lips, once, quickly, and Harry raises his eyebrows but doesn't say anything.
"How's Harry?" he quires.
"I'm doing fine, Parkinson. How're you?" Harry offers a confident grin, and Parkinson rolls her shoulders.
take me to the Chamber of Secrets! Don't listen to Hermione, I
The Ravenclaw suddenly catches eyes with Theo, and his books tumble to the ground. Theo arches and eyebrow, and, flushed, the boy leans down to pick up all of the volumes.
Theo stares at Potter, dumbfounded. "O–Okay?"
As per usual, Blaise Zabini strolled down the corridor he knew he'd find one Hermione Granger, and one Ronald Weasley on a fine Saturday morning. He was planning some quick, silly flirting he could send Ron's way without pissing off his very talented girlfriend, and he was reciting them as he reached his destination.
Blaise sighs, wistfully. "Oh, it is, but he and Abbott have been eyeing each other too much to be comfortable with, honestly. I don't see a drop of homo in him. Used to," he adds, "but unfortunately not anymore."
"Must I, Blaise?" Harry groans, yet already settling in between Ron and Hermione. The students all laugh, most beaming at their Saviour. Theo grins when Draco pretend gags jokingly at him.
He pulls out, gives a sloppy grin to a smiling Draco Malfoy, then retreats to his spot.
"What, Blaise," he asks, shortly.

"Honestly, what do we talk about besides

Potter suddenly becomes exceedingly interested.
Theo looks away, finding the ceiling very interesting.
Blaise nods, not glancing at his best mate. "Why did you help them, anyways?"
As they walk over to the girl's dormitories, he looks to Longbottom who still beams at Hannah while walking. "Uh, hey, Longbottom, how are you?"
things, while on their quest to accompany Theodore Nott.
"Hello, Blaise, Nott," Malfoy gives his trademark smirk in Theo's direction, and Theo has to think back to when it started looking appealing. Blaise greets Malfoy back, and Theo does, too.
"And no," Theo continues, stern but exasperated, "I will not tell you anything
They all stare at him.
"It's because of my trustworthy vibes I throw off," Theo said, earning a laugh out of the other boy. "I'm just alluring."
They all look at Potter.
Theo couldn't say he disagreed.
Nonetheless, Harry responds, coolly:
Ginny growls but leaves him alone. Ron, who just sat down after him, chuckles.
Harry nearly explodes. "Why in the hell am I awake, then?! I thought we were-
He looks at Ron, pointedly — who sits avoiding eye contact and is very flushed. "Ronald..."
Draco rolls his eyes. "I don't fancy him."
Harry swiftly grins to show that he was indeed listening to him, before speaking. "Okay, so a romantic theme. How long will you take to get to the dorm?"
Potter was the first to look up. He was polishing his wand, slowly stroking it, and he gave a smile that was probably supposed to look genuine but just looked sinister.
Note the nudge to Harry's side at the blonde's presence, Ginny laughs, giving Malfoy an approving smile. Malfoy looks bewildered but merely flashes his infamous smirk. Ron smiles at his eggs, and Hermione huffs.
potion? Seriously!"
Theo snorts. "Most likely. They kind of attract trouble."
They turn to him, mid-argument. "Harry?" Hermione arches a brow. "Aren't you supposed to be pursuing Nott?"
Harry's eyes widen. "You knew, too?! What, was there a meeting telling everyone Malfoy's sexuality that I wasn't invited to?!"
Theo is handing everyone a potion before leaving to the Great Hall, and is happily basking in the praise he receives.
“Brilliant,” Harry said, though his voice was much closer than the other side of the room.
“Oh, what are they reporting on?”
Draco laughed. “How long it would take a Gryffindor to pluck up some courage. And I really thought I wouldn’t be waiting more than a couple of days after I first sat next to you and told you you looked pathetic.”
“I would recommend focusing on something sentimental.”
“I hate to say it, but she has a point.”
The next morning, Harry made sure to don the invisibility cloak before getting into the elevator to go down to the courtrooms. He wasn’t sure how much more evidence still needed to be heard. As the day unfolded, Harry began to understand just how many people were aggrieved with Lucius Malfoy. He watched as the fight in Lucius slowly withered away while Narcissa and Draco seemed to be preparing for the worst. By the end of day four, the Chief Warlock declared they had heard from all the parties that had come forward to testify and the Wizengamot would adjourn to give their verdict the following morning.
Draco cringed slightly at the use of the name, but he was slowly starting to get used to hearing it spoken aloud so casually, especially around Harry and Hermione. “Mmm, I suppose such a public high profile outing would draw unwanted attention. But what am I supposed to get him?”
“Thank you.”
Harry carried the drinks back to their table and placed one in front of Draco before setting the other in front of himself. Draco wanted to asked what the bartender had said to Harry to make him laugh, but decided against it. Instead, he chose a more pertinent question. “Did you choose the fish or the chicken?”
It was when he finished his dinner alone that he couldn't take it anymore. He grabbed his wand, shrunk Harry's present, put it in his pocket and then Apparated to Hogsmeade. He instantly regretted not putting on a cloak but he wasn't going back home without seeing Harry. He made his way over the snow towards the Shrieking Shack.
“Can you sit up?” Draco asked.
Over the first few months at Hogwarts there didn’t seem to be much change to their friendship, apart from establishing a clear boundary between being professional in front of the students and other colleagues while keeping it casual during their irregular private catch-ups. However, each time Harry found an opportunity to breach the topic of why Draco had kept his appointment as Potions Master a secret, Draco either immediately became evasive in his answers or would make some excuse about needing to do “something important”.
“Maybe I could ask around?” Harry suggested.
“I presume so. I told you, I know as much as you.”
Harry started to head for the door to leave. “Umm, Harry?”
The next two weeks before the Christmas break went by slowly. Harry went to visit Snape’s portrait a few more times. Classes dragged on as everyone was looking forward to the break. Draco only spoke to Harry when he had to during classes and even then he was to the point. Harry decided to take Hermione’s advice and just let him be until the trial. It was unlikely he was going to be in any mood to talk with Harry before it and he hoped the outcome might eventually improve their relationship.
Draco picked one of the gold ornaments and transfigured it into a five pointed star with a wire spring at the bottom to place over the top most branch. A quick swish and flick and it was floating to the top of tree where it gently settled down. “Done,” he announced.
Santa can you hear me...
Harry let out a small chuckle. “I won’t stop you from trying.”
Ron narrowed his eyes at Draco. “Why were you looking for me?”
The next morning, Draco was still no closer to figuring out what he should get or make Harry that wasn’t overly expensive or useless. The whole present thing just seemed unnecessarily difficult so he decided to pay Avalon Ainsworth a visit.
“Unless there was something else you needed?” McGonagall continued.
He supposed Hermione had apparated him here with Draco while he was still unconscious.
Draco looked back up at Ron’s face, trying to read his expression. “Unless there actually has been and I’m just being kept in the dark because of course we can’t tell the ex-death eater anything.” Draco caught Ron’s eye, “I just want to know if he’s ok,” He pleaded.
The crowd erupted with applause and cheers. Harry had to stand to see Lucius slump back down onto the bench with his family, the consequence of his beliefs and actions slowly sinking in. Narcissa was visibly sobbing into Draco's shoulder and Draco was trying hard to console her. Harry didn’t need to see any more.
Theo laughed, genuinely. "Just remember: not all Ravenclaws are total arseholes, either," he joked to Draco, who rolled his eyes, fondly, in response.
Theo glances at her. "They can't get more astounding than that, Pansy."
"Don't you know?" Theo arches an eyebrow.
me to her?" he snarls, intimidating aura and all.
"I'm only guessing," Theo shrugs, non-committedly. "I mean, you can't blame him. Ever since you found out, you've been so...
"What?" The two Slytherins snap.
He looks at Harry. "Go cheer up Draco."
"He's... gay?" Theo splutters.
Theo looks horrified. "No way!"
Theo crawls back to his spot, ignoring the cheers, and watches as Harry tickles a random sixth year — which is a very strange desire — and it goes on from there.
"Okay," he says.
"We're great dorm mates!" Potter protests, pouting. Draco very pointedly looks away from the full, bottom lip.
"Why are you sniffing Ron's pillows?" Theo questioned.
Theo rolls his eyes, sliding in next to him, but pointedly avoiding his dorm mates' eyes.
As he crawls to Harry, Blaise throws a cup at his arse. He turns and glares at his best friend. "What the bloody hell was that for?"
"I don't." Blaise shrugs. "But my radar was beeping when he sat next to you earlier, and I think he likes the prospect of sharing a dorm with people other than his best mates."
(See the end of the chapter for
Parkinson laughs.
Weasley cracks a smile. "Sorry, mate. Don't know how to. Tell him I'll be over in a second, though."
"Yes."
"Hey, Hermione and Pansy," he greets, sliding into the third chair at the round table.
"You convinced
"Everything has to be perfect, Theodore," Blaise snaps, conjuring a mirror for the millionth time tonight. "How do I look from behind?"
Harry smiles at him. "Yeah?"
Theo doesn't spare them a glance for fear of bursting out in laughter. He looks to the blackboard in the front, absentmindedly tapping his fingers on the desk.
Theo catches on and gapes. "I am not — !" He grows quieter at Pince's glares. "I would not be the bottom."
Finally, the other two had caught on. Malfoy's eyes widened and he looked in a mixture of distressed and disgusted, and Potter just about exploded.
Malone Rogers and Elizabeth Tonn were among them, and Theo remembers Tonn walking from Potions in a Slytherin green jumper.
"Why not?" Blaise frowns. "You're not a bad looking bloke."
"Okay, everyone, quiet down!" Blaise's voice sounds over the large chatter as he stands next to Theo.
Hermione goes to comment on that, but Harry cuts her off. "Now, not to spoil you getting away with it, but why are you looking like you just came back from a pornographic movie?"
He let his eyes settle on Potter's bed. They scan over the boy, appreciatively. His shirt rode a tad, displaying a sliver of tan, smooth skin covering obvious muscles. How did Potter even pack...
Ron rushes after him, and Pansy huffs. "Drama queen. Come on, Draco. I think Greg has a couple of drinks in his dorm." Draco, dazed, follows her out.
"DRACO MALFOY!" Pansy shrieks in his ear.
"Are you... Are you
"EVERYONE KNOWS THE WITCH WANTS TO GET IN POTTER'S PANTS!" Draco explodes, glaring.
Theo furrows his eyebrows. "That Ravenclaw?"
It was very nice, and Theo enjoyed it, but wasn't as allured as he probably would've been before seeing Harry's increasingly hurt face.
Not from work (that all comes easily to him) but from his two new, bloody dorm mates.
"Hi," he says, dumbly, grasping his nightclothes, tightly. He watches as Malfoy rolls his eyes, and Potter looks a tad amused.
"Nott, we weren't expecting you so early," Potter says, still stroking his bloody wand.
"Macmillan and Bulstrode," Hermione confirms through giggles.
you," He shakes his head, index finger and thumb pinching the bridge of his nose. "I just happened to have a...
, I may add."
" he casts, and Draco seizes up from where his hands were a centimeter away from unzipping Harry's trousers, and he was on his knees.
"They needed a push," Theo shrugs, smiling. "Like I need a drink. Keep each other company!"
Blaise smiles, charmingly. "Of
"Theo," Blaise says, cautiously. "Remember what happened last time."
"Would you uh, would you like to sit down?" Theo momentarily wonders why he's the least smooth Slytherin in Hogwarts history.
Harry stutters before nodding and stepping back, eyes scanning the room again.
Honestly, Harry didn't think it was a big deal.
"Oh, but blunt is good," Blaise sings, swinging an arm around Theo. "Nice one, Nott. If Draco acts like a prat anytime soon, I've got material for months."
"...and then his parrot said, "I like geese!", and then there was a hybrid of two Muggle creatures standing right in my dorm."
"Gross, they're kissing," Blaise Zabini says, leaping, gracefully, down from a tall shelf.
The same went with Draco, as well.
Hermione rolls her eyes, fondly. "When did you get so cunning, Theo? Before this year you were such a sweet, innocent boy."
Blaise breaks into laughter. He chokes. "Draco – Malfoy –
Harry looks horrified before opting to shove his face in his pillow. "I was drunk, Theo. I didn't mean anything I said."
It might've been odd to see the stony Slytherin wailing, but everyone knows there's a difference between drunk crying, and
Theo laughs. "Yeah, I'm trying."
They watch the dark-skinned man hightail out of the corridor.
In a wide span of the room, you could see that the only two empty seats were the ones directly next to Theo, who sits at the front. Harry's usual spot beside the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio is filled by Pansy. And Draco's — where he sits next to Theo and Blaise — is empty, but as is Blaise's, for the dark-skinned boy sits next to a flustered Longbottom (no doubt because Blaise couldn't stop flirting).
"As Mister Potter already knows — given that Miss Granger was a large part of it — we are promoting inter-house unity to an extreme for our returning... eighth years, as you will," she continued, "All of the eighth years will be taking residence in the East Tower."
Streams of light go to his wand, and the word is chorused in unison, and Blaise is seen muttering the spell for the completion of the game.
Theo looks at Slughorn who was indiscreetly watching their table, and acts worried. "Slughorn is looking this way. Can't you two idiots just sniff the damn thing?" he hisses, mentally congratulating himself on his acting skills. "I actually care about my Potions NEWT this year, okay?"
"Theo — Harry — Draco — After you!" He pants.
Because who is
Theo sighs.
The three boys were flushed, and Theo groaned, once again.
Theo stutters. "What?! No- I mean, when could I? We only — "
Draco glares. "I don't know exactly what happened last night, but I know I'm not a pretty drunk."
doing everything. He just needs a little of my... influence on Headmistress McGonagall."
The others snort and chuckle, and Draco thinks back to a few weeks ago when he and Potter were chasing Theo together.
party is in full swing is because of house-unity. So let's appreciate it, alright?"
Theo rolls his eyes at the two in front of him. It's really not fair. They're both considerably taller and more muscular than him. And he gets easily intimidated.
Theo bites his tongue. He doesn't like pushy people. His parents were pushy people. Weasley is just trying to be a good friend to Potter, and Theo isn't gonna press him.
Harry blinks. "Don't you want to sit next to... Greg and Bulstrode?"
Theo had looked distastefully down, Potter was bright red, and Malfoy was grimacing in an unattractive way.
Blaise swoops around the room, mingling and being charming as always. Then his eyes zoom in on something, and Theo has to catch him before he falls.
Theo sighs then bites harshly into a breakfast sausage. "I don't," he responds, sullenly. Malfoy continues to study him.
Draco nods, knowing how long her education rants go, and what happens when you interrupt one with your own thoughts.
He really likes it a lot.
do my work."
"Yet you see some in Weasley?" Theo glances up.
He listens in, and at Harry's confession, he unintentionally laughs. Giving away his viewpoint, as well, and causing three highly skilled wands pointed at him.
Harry furrows his eyebrows and ignores the excessive elbow hits to his ribs. "What about?"
Potter accepts the challenge and looks to Nott. "Look, I know we haven't been properly introduced, and haven't gotten to know each other, but I'm sure we can become friends here."
Theo, now, glares at the back of his best friend's head as Anthony Goldstein snogs him. Theo doesn't exactly know
Theo stands, slowly. "I'm quite sleepy, as well. Think I'll accompany you, Draco."
Then talks. "Can't blame you, O' Saviour of ours," Blaise now winks at Harry, "and sorry for startling you, but I couldn't help but hear... Did you
he's feeling so much anger, but he is, and he hates it. He also glares at Ron Weasley who has a mixture of emotions on his face, from embarrassment to anger to confusion. Serves him right for desiring Blaise like that right when Anthony spun the wand.
Potter follows Theo's order without hesitation, but Blaise — who isn't fighting for Theo's friendship — glares at him. "It's hurting my reputation as gossip queen," he sniffs. "What about you, Potter? You got a fancy?"
"Sure, Theo," Harry had grinned, and unknowingly had said Theo's first name for the first time.
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy stand, entire faces flushed, in the entrance to the dungeon, hands clasped together. Draco clears his throat.
(Especially Goldstein, who flushed, impractically, and accepted it with a few mutters of thanks and a cute, small smile.)
The circle laughs louder than necessary, and Theo flushes red.
Indeed, both boys were decidedly shirtless today and were studying on their beds.
Theo sighs, then goes to sleep, shutting his curtains.
," she dismisses, and the Slytherin winces at the pronoun and gender emphasis.
"What did you do to him, by the way?" Theo asks, curiously.
Not like Ron is all that observant, anyways, so it's wasted.
"Well, uh... Thank you for... clearing that up for me," says Draco, studying a portrait where the inhabitant is gone. "I'm glad you're not..."
"Not anymore," Theo says, cautiously. "But I still have the box,
Draco rolls his eyes, speaking, haughtily, "Friends? I'll never be friends with Potter."
"What?" Draco nearly whines at him.
Blaise pulls away, and despite being drunk, looks apologetically to Theo, who he knows has a small fancy on Anthony. Theo rolls his eyes but gives a reassuring smile.
Theo hesitates. They weren't
"Still, Theo," Hermione sighs, but a small smile is on her lips. "You're much too blunt."
Spinning around, his eyes land on a crying, blonde Slytherin. Theo, Anthony forgotten, rushes to aid his friend and roommate.
"Now, that's settled!" Slughorn exclaims. "Now, we'll be in groups of three like the tables are in now. Firstly, we'll be trying them, then you'll all make the opposite potion to smell the difference, despite — Oh, Mister Malfoy,
"Apparently I didn't get the message," Theo stumbles back, but then sees an angry Harry.
Theo gnaws his lip. "They're being quite vicious with each other. I'm almost scared to fall asleep in a room with the two of them."
"Of many," Theo winked.
Draco stares back.
dorm. When she saw who it was, she pushed the things in his hands and fled — most likely getting ready for Harry.
"Wait for me, Harry," he calls after him, barely catching him outside the door. His mind raced for a story, and Harry arches an eyebrow.
"Doesn't Blaise have any idea?" Hermione asks, exasperated.
Theo shrugs. "More or less."
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron is a burning red when he stands. "I've got to use the restroom," his voice is very high-pitched.
Moon recoils and Laney wraps an arm around her, whispering something in her ear. Davis sighs.
"Aw, come on, Nott," Potter says.
Draco glares. "No."
"The Dark Lord couldn't have been
Instead, he answers:
"Malfoy. It's just... He's — " Harry groans, and he is quite confused. He has multiple feelings rushing through his veins and penetrating his mind, currently, and he's never been one to enjoy the feeling of vulnerability.
He opens the door, causing them to fall silent.
Theo had very obviously made acquaintance with the both of them, yet they still tried to win over his favor. On top of that, and this was surprisingly much more annoying, but they were so blatantly avoiding each other!
Hermione and Ron shrug, and Harry
"Oh," Draco says, lamely. He then tilts his head. "Then why are you — "
" Theo winces. "I wasn't getting anything in return."
"Confirm what?" Theo moves away from Blaise's soothing fingers, instantly regretting the decision.
Theo groans. "Thanks, Blaise." He swishes his oatmeal around in his bowl for a way of ignoring the set of eyes on him from Draco's seat at the table.
Potter rolls his eyes, but neither of his best friends miss the way he smiles softly at the blonde's back.
"Neither of them did, though," insists Theo, expression looking puzzled. "I befriended them at nearly the same time."
Honestly, they need to get their priorities straight.
Well, fuck that.
for him, and -
, Theo thinks) across the room, heatedly.
"I insist," Malfoy says in his ear, once again.
Theo laughs, looking at the dopey Gryffindor in a new light.
Theo flushes a deep red. He slowly pulls himself up from his library seat to face a terrifying Draco Malfoy and a sick-looking Harry Potter.
"Why does everyone even care?" Draco asks, slumping in his seat. "And why are you all calling him Harry? I thought he was Potter. He
Theo nodded. "Yes, of course. He's just kind of worried that nothing will go back to the same, and you know how he is — so awkward, he'll never be able to start a conversation."
Ron clears his throat, looking at Draco. "You're quiet. What's up?"
"Merlin's beard," Blaise whimpers, "he's actually worn it."
Pansy glares. "I
Theo arches an eyebrow at him, his mind rushing through this year.
He quietly stretched and cracked some tense muscles. He wiped a hand over his face before wiping the curtains away to have sunlight stream through.
Though I thought he'd be with you, honestly."
Theo rolls his eyes, grunting at the prospect of yet another class with Potter. Of course, most of the eighth year's classes would be the same, since their group was quite small, but he had one class where Malfoy didn't attend, and he was hoping that it'd be the same for Potter.
like that, and there are only four returning Ravenclaws because they're smart enough to not come back. We're not
"I said that I will not be getting up until my head feels like it's back in its seams, and that my existence is erased from the universe," he drawls, flipping onto his back.
"Oh," Potter pipes. "How's Ron?"
Blaise groans and Theo turns red. "Ron!"
Harry slides a hand through his hair. "What should I do?"
"Cheeky," Draco drawls, but Theo could've sworn there was a hint of a smile.
His family had seen Potter after the trials, and with Aurors and Ministry guards around them, Narcissa hugged him, thanked him, and spoke, fervently and quietly, with him. After the war, Potter consistently had a darker expression on his face but when he talked to Narcissa, the skin around his eyes softened a tad; he seemed to be seeing someone else. Nonetheless, Lucius was too guarded to give anything but a nod. Potter accepted it, anyways.
Harry finished filling his suitcase and gave his wand a final flick making the lid close and click shut. He turned around to address Draco properly.
The tea sommelier looked at Draco and back to Harry. Harry read their name badge. “Look Gwen, you know who I am, right?” She nodded. “Well, I’d owe you one if you let me do this.”
Following his somewhat unusual encounter with Draco, Harry found himself venturing down to the tea house for a couple of hours each day. He was hoping the blonde would show up again and that he, Harry, might return the supposed gesture. He tried to keep his mind busy as he waited by bringing down some of the paperwork that had been piling up on his desk for months. He even visited the tea house during his weekend off, but Draco didn’t come back. Didn't even walk by the window from what Harry saw.
Draco started to make short teasing licks under the waistband of Harry’s pants as he slowly pulled down the trouser zip. He leaned back from the trapped bulge and he gripped the top of both the trousers and pants to pull them down and free the erection beneath. Harry lifted his hips to help as Draco ensured the clothing was out of his way but noticed the hips stayed up. Noting the silent plea, he moved to stand beside the couch and only then did Harry drop his arse back down to the couch cushion as he eyed his blonde partner.
“Because
Last night I took a walk in the snow
“Why? Don’t you trust me?” Draco asked.
He had no idea how he was going to get inside the Shack or let Harry know he was there without giving away Harry. Draco studied the Shack for a while then a small gust of wind blew across his body and someone grabbed his hand and side-long Disapparated with him.
“I knew you’d have to know something.”
“Feel free to start decorating the tree while they finish off the tables. They’ll be happy to assist with any other decorations you need put up as well,” Amelia informed him.
Surely Harry hadn’t forgotten their exchange in the bathroom during their sixth year? Draco still berated himself about not letting Harry in that day. Maybe he really could have helped like he seemed to have wanted. He still had a scar on his side from that day, Snape hadn’t been able to get to him quickly enough with the counter curse and so a reminder of the event remained. Long afterward Snape had informed him that Harry hadn’t known what the curse would do which had helped Draco forgive him, he didn’t have the energy for grudges anymore anyway.
“You're going to give us away if you keep doing that.”
"Yes, Potter?" Draco asked, stopping to look back.
“But you didn't leave the room,” Draco pointed out. He lent back against his desk, looking particularly righteous in his fitted robes.
Draco captured Harry’s lips in a long sensual kiss, while moving his hands up Harry’s shirt, feeling his firm torso. He felt Harry hands grip the top of his hips, pulling him closer. It wasn’t enough for Draco, so he walked Harry backward until he was against the wall and Draco was able to push his hips more firmly into Harry’s, rubbing their members together and feeling Harry moan into his mouth as they kissed.
“I have a lot of Muggle Christmas carols on here,” Harry said. Draco looked at him skeptically when Potter offered him the buds on the end of the wire. “You can listen. Just put those in your ears.”
On Wednesday, Draco confirmed the final numbers of the party guests and worked on the seating arrangements. When he left the Ministry in the evening, he still yet had to hear from Harry. He had promised to tell him by Thursday morning who would be in charge of the Christmas music and Draco trusted he would keep his word.
“Here,” Draco said, offering him a vile of headache cure from his own potion stores. Harry took it and drank.
“Hello Malfoy,” Harry said calmly, seemingly not phased by the sight of his childhood enemy, then went to stand on the platform across from Draco as the Madam directed.
"Ron was saying you kept requesting him as your Healer and, well… you were obsessed with him at school."
Harry stopped to look back at Draco. Had he just used his first name?
“That is true, but I was never formally informed of your relationship with Mr Potter.”
?" Harry asked. "A lot of people stare at me, Hermione."
“I’m surprised you didn’t go to Granger for this counter curse.”
"Can't we at least try?"
“What?... Oh no.” Harry shook his head. “I'm not going to do it for you.”
“Ouch,” said Draco, placing a hand to his heart in mock pain. “No need to keep bringing that up. I wasn’t asking for details, just what’s in the paper.”
Draco turned to face him then, but didn’t seem surprised… more amused. “You really are pathetic, aren’t you?”
Hermione just smiled.
The measuring tape continued recording his dimensions when the bell connected to the door of the store chimed. “Oh, that must be Mr Potter. Excuse me, Mr Malfoy.”
“Well, I was there and it wasn't a date.” Draco walked off. He didn’t not want to debate the matter with Hermione.
“But tomorrow is Saturday.”
“What did she expect was going to happen after she kissed us both in public?”
“Hmm… That’s not such a bad idea. He does owe me for covering his arse, after all. Since Weasel would be useless in this case, I’ll have to think of another way for him to pay me back.”
From their lunch, Harry knew Draco was working the following day. Arriving at the hospital in the late afternoon, he asked for Draco at reception and was told he was working on the Third Floor. Harry needed him on the Fourth, but he made his way up to the Third Floor in any case.
“Err, you probably won't want to play
“I’m not sure,” Hermione said. “You should probably talk to the family liaison officer in that department. If I remember correctly, it’s Avalon Ainsworth.” Draco repeated the name in his head to help remember it as the waiter came past to collect their plates and Hermione asked for the bill. “Oh, and I’d suggest you don’t follow me back.”
“Well, then there’s nothing to discuss.”
“Yes please.”
“What, and you think Hermione or I might have told him?” Ron scoffed. “Thanks mate.”
“We’d like to enquire about the availability of your function room,” Draco stated.
“I can't think of anyone not in my department who I could ask to do it, besides you.”
“So it
By now there were only two days left before Christmas and Draco was desperate to know if Harry was okay and if he’d be home soon. He had hoped it wouldn’t have to come to this, but he had to try.
"Ravenclaws!" Ron huffs about Sallis, after positioning Harry on his bed. "A
Theo rolls his eyes. "You aren't."
to do?" Hermione questions, eyebrows furrowed.
He nears us and we huddle around the box. He points to the fine print.
"Ron knows where it is, don't you?" Hermione asks, smiling.
Blaise takes a deep breath, then looks to Theo. "Now, remember: We are the champions of our success."
Theo almost whines at the sensation. "I'm f-fine."
"No, you don't," Ron says, pitifully. "If you did, then you would be leaving well enough alone."
"You know how to quiet a room," Potter comments after his laughter dies down. Draco avoids looking at him since he knows Potter is already looking at him, and he does
Harry lowers his wand, and for the second time, he says, "Sorry. Old war habit."
Gryffindors are here because they feel it's a duty. You Hufflepuffs... are just
"Presume they're still in
Harry looks, once again, immediately relieved. "Great. I mean, sad, but... Wait, I didn't... say any
"To get Draco on his good side again. Mind you," Theo adds, "I hate them chasing me around, but I hate them being awkward with each other even more."
Theo nods, motioning him to his abandoned table. The other student looks even more flustered but nonetheless follows him. Theo wonders how such an attractive man can be this flustered with everything Theo does.
The two seekers were staring at him, and he felt incredibly self-conscious.
Draco feels his whole body shake and he's abruptly filled to the brim with happiness.
, so he didn't even have to deal with it, to be honest. And news, as always, spread fast.
He shakes his head to himself. "Stop talking about them! I am trying to wallow in self-pity!"
"Oh!" Theo feigns innocence. "You're together, are you? Never saw that one coming. Congratulations."
his inner thoughts remind him, and he scolds that stupid part of his brain.
Ron had given a short, awkward wave and a grunt, which made Theo reevaluate who woke up first.
Hermione sighs, turning and walking out of the room. "I'll be back shortly."
"That's your problem. You shouldn't want to break the rules so much," Greg informs her, very helpfully, and biting into a mysterious orange fruit.
Hermione rolls his eyes. "
Theo's eyes roam over the large circle. Nearly the entire eighth year is participating in the highly anticipated Spin the Wand game, and a lot of the braver younger years join in, as well. The other people at the party linger around, watching instead of playing.
this is so cheesy every time i read it skngkdn i hope it's good though!
truly awful with his handsome looks.
Blaise rolls his eyes, smiling, wickedly. "Yes, the little nerd is staying, Theodore. Nearly everyone in the year is staying," Blaise adds.
gay. I'm not even being stereotypical, he just doesn't try to hide it," Ron chuckles back, and if anyone notices the use of Malfoy's first name, no one announces it.
The others besides Greg and Theo look confused, but Draco quickly stands up. "I'm going to bed. Tomorrow is Friday, and I'm going to be well-rested for that Runes quiz."
Theo shifts. "That's the one."
of my dorm mates. How lucky."
At that moment, both Professor Slughorn and Mason Jones walked through the door.
"You were much more approving," Blaise reads his mind and smiles when Theo raises his eyebrow. "If I told fifth year Draco Malfoy that I was pansexual, he'd sock me out, probably speaking rubbish about pure-blood importance. He, along with Parkinson, Goyle, and the whole school, knows now, but I still prefer you over them. We're just platonically compatible."
Blaise stares at him.
Theo looks over his shoulder to see a dashing Draco Malfoy in a long, tight-fitting robe. His hair is styled to perfection, as always, and he throws off waves of sexy confidence. Pansy shortly follows in a black, not-so-appropriate dress. Her pale legs seem to go on forever in lacy tights. Greg, the silly boy, comes out last and looks surprisingly handsome in nice robes. He appears nervous and is clinging to Pansy's side. But after Pansy whispers something in his ear, he beams then wanders off.
"They're waiting for me in there!" Theo whines as he closes the door of Blaise and Weasley's dorm.
Theo has to stifle a grin. "Well, he did say something... Oh, what was it? Oh, yes — 'I'm not trying to sabotage their relationship or anything, but I'm fairly certain Hermione is a lesbian'."
It'll be the first Christmas his Mother has had without his Father. Something no one talks about is the Death Eater trials. The majority of the returning older Slytherins' parents are in Azkaban or are dead by the Kiss. His mother and he got away. No doubt with the help of the boy next to him.
"You love it." Blaise winks, then the door opens to reveal, indeed, a shirtless Ronald Weasley.
The two stare at the normally quiet boy, for a while, and Theo grows self-conscious.
is not a nice party game. So, of course, you have to answer the question, as well."
Even though it was drilled in his mind when he was younger that he would marry a nice, Pureblood wife making little Pureblood babies, Draco Malfoy was not afraid of it.

All of the Slytherins wear either a grin or a grimace.

"Hey, Zabini." Potter waves a little.

Granger says in his mind.
Theo breathes, deeply, nodding and pretending to listen to Blaise blabber on about Weasley's freckles or something. They sit at the Slytherin table, grabbing their breakfasts.
than you," Malfoy drawled. "And look, Nott – "
So, although they were somewhat "companions", Harry was certain on this fact:
he's better than them all.
Malone Rogers, an eighth year Slytherin, discreetly covers his private parts in remembrance, but Blaise notices and sends him a wicked grin.
Theo shifts. "Not too bad. They're not teasing me like they used to, though. And they rarely talk to each other."
It's the night of the party. Considering that this will most likely be the last party in Hogwarts for this particular group of students, most people in the year are hidden away in their dorms, getting ready, swiftly.
Draco and Potter had done some...
Hermione swings in, her hair looking even busier than normal, and her face flushed. Harry notes that her lips look a bit swollen. "Yes, he did. I saw him leave Theo's. Are they dating, Harry?"
Theo hums, quietly, to himself as he cleans the fireplace mantel. And Blaise is narrowing his eyes, about to ask why he's so chipper when a voice comes from the common room doorway.
"Draco, please, let me pleasure you!" Next thing Theo sees is pink lips descending to his.
He grunts before sliding out of bed and casts Tempus. He always woke earlier than the other boys, and this was no different. He glanced at Malfoy's closed-curtain bed, then to Potter's whose curtains were only closed halfway.
. One, two, three,
He feels... strange, and so relieved and happy, and he can't identify
some students choose to take.
Theo nudges Harry, ultimately breaking the Chosen One out of his dazed state. He blinks at Theo. "What's wrong, Harry?"
The three glance at each other.
, exactly - " Ron gets cut off.
"Cute," Blaise laughs at the two women, though looks confusedly, at Ron. Theo has to stop himself from banging his head repeatedly against the wall at his best friend's obliviousness.
Blaise nods, smiling. "Mighty fine, aren't they?"
Theo stifles his laughter, as Ron flushes, going to spin the wand. It turns and turns before landing on Parvati Patil. She proceeded to having her hair sniffed, then she landed on Tracey Davis, a Slytherin, who received the first truth.
“Dammit Draco. Did somebody put you up to this?”
Keeping his eyes on Harry’s face, Draco lowered his hands from the solid shoulders and began the removal of his lover’s clothes. Undoing the clasp on the cloak, he threw it off Harry’s form and let it land on the floor. Next, with two hands, he grasped the base of his jumper on either side and ripped it up over Harry’s head, almost knocking his glasses off in the process. They were the next thing to go, although Draco took care to place them neatly next to their drinks.
His two best friends relax beside him, but he still feels Ron's tense form.
"Three months," Blaise offers. "The saddest thing is that you haven't even made a move."
Hermione grimaces. "Sorry, Theo. You were with Draco at the time. Weeks ago, Harry ran out of the dorm after Draco and you came through, according to Harry."
"Everyone in position, Ron and the subjects will be coming in soon!" Theo speaks over the excited chatter in Professor Slughorn's classroom.
He was rather glad they weren't looking around anymore. As required for the lesson, each and every student in the room were either sniffing the bottles like idiots, are dazedly scribbling down what they smelt. Ivan Crawley was even smiling, fondly, at a flustered Mason Jones.
He hums quietly to himself, but then, not even a minute later, someone walks into the library.
i had always planned to write a chapter dedicated to show the rest of the blaise/ron story but i never got to it. please comment if you think that i should try to pursue that, or if you have anything else to say about the story!!
He awoke early, as per usual, but when he came down to the common room, it was as messy as when he left it the night before.
unsuspiciously.
"Theo, I'm queen, of
"Who?" Theo asked, eagerly.
"Harry Potter, get over here right now!" he yells, and Theo chuckles. "You are
"I think it's a good idea," Harry Potter's tone is defensive.
But no one noticed the way they were
"Saturday breakfasts? I don't usually..." he trails at the look on Theo's face.
He hears silence, then approaching footsteps. There's ruffling and a few grunts next to him before Harry is seemingly pushed down in the seat next to him, his entire body rigid.
"Should we sit down?" Her tone is tired, but Theo could've sworn he saw a bit of a smile on her lips.
Theo and Blaise chuckle at him, leaving Potter, and Malfoy, confused.
Theo wonders how the hell house divisions are being so shamelessly corrupted this year.
Then, Theo smiled. "Oh, I know what Harry'll have to do."
Harry spins, angrily and lustfully to Theo, but the boy already cast the spell again.
"O-Of course, you don't," Harry says, avoiding eye contact, then leaving the room.
Blaise graces a smile. "Okay. Wands at mine, and remember: quick jerk to the left and the spell
Blaise groans, pitifully, and sinks in his seat.
"That's crazy!" Hermione chokes out.
Theo snorts, and she glares, playfully, at him.
"Harry wants to take Draco on a date," Hermione says.
"Okay," Theo smiles at the redhead. "But do you know how to get past him without him seeing you?" Theo halfway jokes.
Harry shrugs. "He's the boss."
He chuckles, releasing his wand and closing the door behind him. He shrugs. "Old war instincts."
"You're a genius!" Ernie MacMillan sings to him.
Theo, quick to remember his last mistake, says, firmly, "No, I'm not Harry. I'm Theo and I'm taking you to bed."
They rush out of the room, and Draco drags Theo to a secluded corner around the bend. Harry follows, shortly.
Theo liked boys. A lot. But
"Anyways, I see Hermione coming down, now. Talk to you later," Neville goes to leave, but then stops. "And uh, thanks. I think I'll go for it. For the first move."
"Don't be so sure," Blaise mutters, and I shake with silent laughter.
the bottom!"
Theo had the fortune of his past classes having only two-person seats, or one. But of course crazy, old Slughorn had groups of three working together, because three is just Theo's lucky number.
"'Course not." Theo smiles at Malone Rogers who takes the potion, making a dramatic grateful deal about it. "But his little, Gryffindor heart doesn't need to know that. I'll just tell him that I need to save up for my little brother's birthday in a heartfelt manner."
frustrating Theo.
"Theo?" Harry arches an eyebrow at Nott's first name. Ron merely shrugs. "And bloody perfect," he rolls his eyes. He sighs. "How did you do it, eh? Make him like you, that is."
Draco's face is impassive.
Draco sighs.
Blaise stares at the tabletop. Then stands. "I need to... go to the library."
something he noticed. They hadn't had kissed.
"That you're their friend," she shrugs. "They're two extremely stubborn boys. We've all noticed how you three are on friendly terms now, but they refuse to stop until you tell them who won."
dating Pansy, then?" he asks, still staring at the ground.
Anthony Goldstein seems to be trying to, very discreetly, fend off a shit-faced drunk, Tracy Davis.
"Excuse me?" Draco arches a blonde eyebrow.
He didn't look to Draco, back then. He didn't even notice him until Draco struck out a hand. He shook it, wordlessly, before saying goodbye to Narcissa, and leaving.
Harry rolls his eyes, snapping, "No, but maybe Luna will, tonight, don't you think?"
Ron rolls his eyes, then turns to Hermione. "Anyways, why'd you think Theo and Blaise were dating?"
"We're not getting married," Harry says, exasperated at all of the students. "And, well — we'd like to thank you."
"Are you done? The vial is here, and I already wrote down what I smelled," Theo said, dismissively.
"Now, before we start, I know there have been some... past events that may cause you to desire pain upon some of our members." He clears his throat and the entire crowd silences. "But listen to my every word: I didn't prepare and throw this amazing party for someone to get hurt, so if one of your desires is to inflict harm on someone here get the fuck out, or get it out of your bloody brain. If anyone gets a violent dare, then I will figure out who desired it, humiliate them, and end the game. Don't try me. Understood?"
As Draco walks away, he hears Potter mutter, "Fucking hell."
"I can't believe he shouldered me," Ginny glares at her eggs.
"Don't think so highly of yourself, you only shagged your fist," Theo says, dismissively.
"Neither of them will bother," Blaise says, briskly, pointing to Ivan Crawley, Mason's boyfriend, who glares at anyone who glances at the empty seat next to him.
Theo looks up.
that, Gregory."
Theo's death. Harry's death. Harry vomiting. Harry finding Draco then vomiting on him, etc.
They all continue eating and chatting because that's something Greg would usually say.
So, Theo left Leo, his brother, with his aunt and uncle with the intent of passing his NEWTS, getting a job, and raising Leo in the exact opposite ways of his parents. He'd be accepting, caring, and actually useful.
to conceal his grin.
They were waiting for him!
was he supposed to 'hold back' the most powerful wizard in the world?! He defeated the Dark Lord for goodness' sake! Theo stood no chance.
"So you mean he's a Slytherin?" Harry quirks half of a smirk.
"How do you even know that?" Theo frowns.
Theo wonders why he's so deeply comforting a drunk man. He wonders if he's attempting to comfort himself.
The entire class is eighth years. Potions were required after the war, for some reason that Theo doesn't have the care to remember. It's their only class where all twenty-nine eighth years are present.
Really, do the girls stay cooped up there right after dinner is over to
, what I'm trying to say is that you have to be blunt enough so that it's obvious and can be backed up with... facts! That way Harry will know, and Draco won't run away with his tail between his legs."
Harry looks up, his expression joyous. He looks to Theo, who offers an encouraging gesture. He clears his throat. "Yeah, er- I think that one statement meant to..."
Malfoy snorts, and Potter chuckles. "Okay. Thanks."
Theo chuckles. "Blaise has a fetish for heroic Gryffindors."
But still, did he
Harry blinks, rapidly. "I guess I already did, but... Why does everyone know each other's sexuality except me?"
Hermione bites her lip. "The same with Ron and Blaise," she leans forward, "I've never seen Blaise so...
Hermione flushes, and Theo laughs. Pansy arches an eyebrow with a smirk. "Have you heard what people are saying about you?"
Theo shivers. "Okay,
Theo gapes.
Theo sighs. "Draco, no one cares. You were forced, and we understand that. Harry, Ron, Hermione — they all don't care. They went through hell and back in the war, and I'm sure they'd just like to forget. And when you, and I, and Blaise, and Pansy, and Goyle, when we're nice and friendly — it helps them. Harry doesn't think you're neither vile nor disgusting. He sees you as Draco Malfoy — his friend who changed after experiencing a tragic life."
Draco groans quietly before rushing up to Slughorn's desk. Harry splutters then goes to follow him, but not before glancing down at Draco's parchment. He stops.
Theo sighs, then flips on his stomach. Ever since they figured out that he knows about their obvious mutual love for each other they've been avoiding him like the plague. They'd even rather be together than with him. Maybe he shouldn't have been so blunt.
Theo takes the empty vial from him and tucks it into his bag. He watches as Harry talks, animatedly, with Ron about last night.
it reads,
Theo looks up, fondly, at his best friend. "I'm not
"No one!" Hermione rushes. "But I think he'd look good with a certain someone."
Theodore sighs as he trudges — along with his luggage — across his new dorm to the bed in the middle since his new dorm mates decided his fate for him as they went to the opposite walls.
Potter and Malfoy stare bewildered at the scene before them. "How on Earth..." Malfoy mutters.
" Theo smiles conspiratorially at Ron. "I see where you're coming from."
And as if all of his meaningful words meant nothing, Draco erupted into tears at the mention of Harry.
Theo shrugs, and grins. "What are friends for, right?"
i hope you liked this chapter, it's truly my favorite! also, harry and draco's relationship changes drastically after this so... ;)
"Hey." He takes in their appearance, and flushes, but still jogs over. "Uh, sorry to interrupt, but after you... say your farewells, would you mind dropping by Hermione's and waving her down here?"
"What?"
(And the dislike doesn't stem from the rumors of her and Malfoy dating, at all. Why would they?! Are you accusing Harry of something?! He doesn't even care about Malfoy's love life! Sod off!)
thanks so much for reading, and with love, d <3
Blaise glares. "What was that?"
So, since now he loves chaos, he walks over to them to annoy them. (He really wonders when he became this way.)
The boys don't spare a glance at each other's parchments and go to grab their respective papers out of each other's hands, but Slughorn does as rehearsed.
He spins around. "Yes?"
Harry feels a small touch of happiness deep in his body at those words.
" He had neared a shriek, and McGonagall looked on disapprovingly. He ignored it. "Professor, look; I respect you, fully, and I know you're brilliant, but
Ron shrugs, but his face is a dark crimson.
"Oh!" Theo visibly brightens up. "Yeah, I totally remember that. Ever since then the two have been acting strangely."
"'Mione?" Ron shouts, shocked, as he helps Harry up onto the seat where he and Hermione were arguing.
For a few minutes.
Ron shoots him a miserable glare. "And where is that?"
No one will molest you without your consent."
"Nothing more than usual," Weasley mumbles. "And I honestly don't know what he's planning. All I know is that they've come to a... an agreement."
The students stand and Blaise gets in the middle of the circle, wand raised high. Everyone follows his movements with his wand.
Theo moans. That psycho Gina Sallis was apparently more interested in Harry in bed.
He had known Harry could quicken things up with his powerful magic, and surely enough, by the time the Headmistress arrived, the room was clean. Even hovering Padma Patil had found her dorm with a Hangover Potion in hand.
He rushes towards them. "Mione! Ron!"
Hermione gives him a measuring look.
Draco's eyes widen.
I like where you're coming from, Weasley."
"Next is Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott – " she sends Theo an apologetic glance " – and Harry Potter."
Theo stands and looks over to Draco who is gaping at the scribbled words in his own hand.
Blaise rolls his eyes, but smiles. He suddenly whips his head around, then turns again, jabbing his finger to the entrance of the hall. "There's Weasley, Potter, and Granger. Think they're gonna almost get murdered again, this year?"
"Just pass the message, will you?" Weasley asks, crossing his arms self-consciously.
Ron picks up the chocolate box, examining it. Then his eyes widen, but amusement is laced in them.
"Firstly, everyone will put their wands to — who? Okay — Blaise's wand, and say
"We're just trying to be civil," Malfoy adds.
Joan Laney, a relatively quiet, Slytherin girl, smiles to Moon. "She's just being negative."
over and over on your parchment isn't going to — "
Theo sighs as he opens the door to his dorm one last time. Although considerably easier to drag up the stairs to their dorm (Theo truly misses the simple dungeons), Draco was not the horny drunk — he was the crying drunk, and Theo didn't know which one was worst.
Theo knows she used a glamour to disguise the real name of the chocolate, and chuckles when Harry says, "Sallis' Sexy Solutions."
After his talk with McGonagall, he thought he'd drop by the dorm to get his supplies for the library — his solitude. But then he walked in, and... and...
Then he pouts. "No fair you got Potter looking your way. I wish Weasley would even glance at me. He's too preoccupied with Granger and their secret talks."
“Do you need time to think or have you already made up your mind?”
Harry tried to follow her gaze, but it could have been anyone in the hundreds of magical folk celebrating. “What makes you so sure?”
Make the situation more awkward, why don't you, Draco thought. Though, if Harry was feeling awkward, he didn't show it.
“You have to make a choice, Malfoy,” Potter said as they exited the last pub.
He was sitting in his usual spot at the tea house on what was a busy Friday morning when he next saw Draco. He watched him walk in and straight to the counter to order his usual before going to sit at the window with his back to Harry.
Draco shook his head. "Get some rest and then stay out of here for a while."
When he reached Avalon’s desk, she was already with someone so he stayed back a few paces, remembering the etiquette his mother had taught him. It was only a few moments before Avalon noticed him and spoke up. “Hello, Mr Malfoy. I’ll be with you in a few minutes. You can take a seat across the hall to wait if you wish.” She went back to the conversation with her current client before Draco could respond. Rude, he thought, but went to sit down as directed.
It took him a few minutes to realise Draco was still holding his hand. Harry gave it a little squeeze and Draco squeezed back. They heard the local church bells toll midnight, then the fireworks display began. Harry didn’t get to see any of it before Draco placed his free hand on his side, turned him so they were facing and started their New Year with a complete and utter snogging.
“You’ve had a larger caseload before. What makes this new one so bad?”
A few minutes later, he heard rustling coming from the grass. He looked down to see indents forming and disappearing in the shape of footsteps. Harry was pacing.
