Ginny simply muttered something about Hogwarts and Malfoy before laughing to herself. “Oh, Harry,” she said, pulling him in for a hug.
them, but as they were the best agents, he begrudgingly respected them and treated them as such. He'd never understood how two owls so different in nature could work together so well while still sniping at each other any chance they got, but as long as they did their jobs, he'd give them their dues. “You're here, finally. Would you like to inform us of any progress you've made since the last meeting?”
It took Harry a second to realise he had his hands held uselessly at his side and he nervously started to slide them up Draco's arms. As the kiss deepened, Harry's hands slid around Draco's back, only for Draco to break away suddenly. Harry jumped back, an apology on the tip of his tongue.
“That's it!” Harry said, looking between Ron and Hermione. “You're the third person to mention Malfoy. Am I missing something? Is he gay, too?”
Working with Malfoy after spending his nights with Draco was extremely difficult. He loved Draco, he knew that. He loved kissing him; he loved having sex with him. But, as Harry was beginning to realise, he also loved Malfoy. He loved spending time with Malfoy. He loved the nights where he told Draco not to come as he was joining Malfoy and the others in the pub. He loved working with Malfoy. He loved it when Malfoy made fun of his trousers or his messy eating habits.
“He knows.” Pansy walked up to Harry and hugged him close to her. “He knows he royally fucked it up. He knows that you wouldn't do that. Really, deep down, he does. What would you have done?”
Draco couldn't help but nod. Despite the circumstances—and the consequences—he had slept better than he had in a long time. Maybe it was about time he found himself a boyfriend.
If it wasn't for G, this fic would just be stuck on my computer, half finished. As always, she has been my biggest supporter and my partner in crime.
“Harry, look at me. Really look at me. Does the me you saw earlier today look like the me sat here?”
Harry was taken aback by the vehemence in Draco's answer. Did Draco really think that little of him?
“Ah, yours are not the only plans that fell through. If it were up to my father, all of that would probably be true.”
“What's this about, Harry? I know there's nothing wrong with the kids and we just saw each other at Mum's the other day. Why did you—”
Darius stood up a little straighter and glared at Hedwig. “I dropped Pig off easily enough, but Miss Parkinson saw me in the Slytherin common room and wanted to smooth my feathers. It would have been rude to ignore her.”
“So,” Hermione said, turning her attention fully to Malfoy, “I heard you had a big date last night? Tell us everything!”
“To us!” Draco repeated, clinking their glasses together. “But I think we'd better do what the fuck we want tomorrow. It looks like we're about to be kicked out.”
“Hmm,” Draco moaned as Harry removed Draco's cloak and started kissing across his neck. “Stop that. You wanted to talk? You go first. Yours looks like good news. I could do with some of that.”
When Harry walked into the lab one morning after a particularly spectacular night with Draco, the sight of Malfoy's smile and cheerful 'Good morning' had Harry realising what had been niggling him for the past few weeks. The pit in his stomach, it was the most obvious thing in the world, now that he thought about it. He was feeling guilty.
Harry threw the closest thing to hand at her; it wasn’t Harry’s fault that that happened to be a treacle tart.
“Of course. See you at breakfast.” Before she walked out of the door, she turned and gestured towards Harry's perfectly made bed. “Only needed the one, after all.”
The first thing that hit Harry as he stepped off the plane was the heat. He didn't know how to describe it, and he was sure he had never felt heat like it before. Harry was sure that it had a different name. Humidity, or air pressure, or something. All Harry knew was that it was hot. And he loved it.
“Yes,” she replied, popping her head around the kitchen door. “Are you finished yet? The girls need to know—”
When asked about his own experiences, Draco didn't know what to say. He didn't know himself where he and Harry were heading, and he definitely didn't want to share any of it with strangers. Looking at Harry, Draco simply smiled and told the women the truth: it had helped immensely.
A few rounds of pints, maybe too many shots, and some much needed chips later, talk turned from the general catch up to the teasing and bantering that only came from a group of friends that had been together for years.
“I'm only taking the piss,” Draco insisted, throwing his arm around Harry's shoulders. “Harry's got no reason to look anywhere else. I happen to know that his right hand does the job perfectly well.”
Harry growled. He was fuming, and Malfoy thought he could just turn his back on him and finish showering? “What the fuck, Malfoy?”
to go on holiday with you. Honestly. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to rub suntan lotion on your back by the side of some pool somewhere before scandalising the neighbours by having sex on the balcony. But I have to go away.”
It was hotter than Harry ever could have imagined. The clink of the heavy metal buckle against the clasp caused his cock to give another twitch, but the sight and sound of the leather sliding through the loops of Draco's trousers made him kneel up on the bed and move towards Draco. He needed to watch the rest of Draco's impromptu strip-show closely.
“About what?” Draco asked, genuinely confused. Harry was always doing that, starting a conversation as if Draco had the first clue what he was on about.
Harry guided the pamphlets into the drawing room and rolled up his sleeves. He had another idea. Picking up the first brochure, Harry smiled at the golden sands and tanned young men pictured on the front before walking over to the wall and pinning it right over where Tonks' name used to be embroidered.
Entering the shop, Harry immediately felt out of place. The well-dressed sales girl looked him over with something akin to disgust on her face. Harry idly thought how ridiculous it was that she was judging him on his clothing—especially if you considered where he planned to go on holiday. Harry didn't care one little teeny weeny bit about his appearance. All of his clothing was new—well, newish—but it was simply comfortable instead of stylish.
There had been no problem in the retrieval of Paul and Janet's memories—it was Hermione's spellwork, at the end of the day—but they had simply found themselves new lives. They had a beautiful home, jobs and a few close friends. They were happy.
Granger—Hermione—she was a lot easier than I ever thought to get along with. I'd always thought her an uptight little witch who knew too much for her own good. She did, of course, know too much, but she used that knowledge to help her friends and I'd never met a more fiercely loyal person before. I grew to like her very much, as did Daphne. Apparently, they had the same problem with their hair or something. I don't know what it was exactly, but they bonded over whatever it was immediately.
Hermione ignored them and threw some Floo powder into the flames. The rest of the group waited in silence for her to finish whatever she was doing.
“Excuse me,” Harry calmly said, after all, no use making enemies on the first day. “I think you must be mistaken; I claimed this lounger earlier. My towel and lotion were on here.”
Harry was mistaken—tennis was not a bloody good plan. It was a bloody brilliant plan. After an awkward moment where Harry had questioned Draco's knowledge of the game—
The glass had been cleared away, and glaziers were already on site, fitting the new windows. Harry was saddened to see the not-so-small group of guests waiting outside in the courtyard, luggage in hand. The manager was with them and Harry could hear him trying to persuade the upset group to stay. Harry wished they hadn't been invisible last night; maybe they could have deterred the bigoted bastard from causing more trouble.
Draco and Harry placed their car at the top of the ramp, and with a whispered 'Good luck', let it go. It sailed down the course, egg securely on board, but it slowed quickly and Draco thought that Grumpy and Frumpy had it in the bag. Draco could hear Harry muttering, 'Come on, come on' under his breath and, sure enough, their car inched past Grumpy and Frumpy's to take first place.
It was a simple enough plan, but I was confident of its success. Ignoring Potter just seemed to encourage him more, and there was no way I was going to actively engage with him, so that left me with one option: I would annoy the hell out of Potter until he gave up and left me alone.
Draco wasn't here. Harry was here and unpacking the sparkles. Messy, clumsy Harry was going to be putting up Draco's sparkles. Dog barked a laugh. This was going to be good.
“No,” Malfoy said, advancing on Harry, showing no attempt to cover his glistening, wet, naked body. “I won. What is that phrase Weasley keeps saying? Fair and square, that's it. I won, fair and square. No cheating. Just skill and a fuckload of practising. While you were off investigating your little crimes and staking out your little criminals, I was out on the Quidditch pitch daily. I've worked for this, Potter, and I've worked bloody hard.”
So instead they talked. Harry thought he knew Malfoy. He'd been friends with him for months. They worked together every single day. But the Malfoy who suddenly appeared in his kitchen at night was different. He opened up. He told Harry his innermost hopes and dreams. He told Harry things that Harry had only wished to know. Harry learnt about Malfoy's relationship with his mum. He learnt
They always revere me. Every week a new statue or street name or fucking park is being erected or named in my honour. I could do without the twelve foot brass statue of me standing smack bang in the middle of Diagon Alley, but no. I have to walk past it every single day. I could do without the huge plaque outside my own fucking house, stating that 'this is where the great Harry Potter plotted the downfall of Voldemort' as if I did it on my own. Every year, there are dedications and celebrations and bloody carnivals in my name. To celebrate my name.
“Harry! It's so good to see you!” She wrapped her arms around him. “But you are an absolute idiot!” She stepped back and slapped him across the cheek.
he shown Harry around all of the crap houses first? That thought went out of his mind when Draco suddenly turned, grabbed Harry by the shoulders and kissed him fully.
Harry's suit fit him perfectly. Harry wasn't sure about the whole 'matching his eyes' thing, but the girls had sighed when he had first put it on so Harry assumed it was a good thing. Green was green in Harry's book. Apparently, he was missing the point—well, he was still missing the point. Girls were crazy.
“Ah, Harry and Draco. You're late; having a little too much fun in your room?” Glinda—and Draco decided he didn't like her much anymore—winked at them, and their fellow guests laughed.
Darius cleared his throat. There was nothing that had been handed to the two of them that they hadn't cleared up promptly, or at least delegated to someone who could. “Excuse me?” he asked in a manner reminiscent of his owner. “What are you implying? Are you questioning my—” Hedwig pushed him again. “—our abilities?” he finished without skipping a beat. Draco would be proud.
The small wave of nausea that Draco felt upon his arrival had absolutely nothing to do with his Apparation and everything to do with the sight that greeted him. He automatically held his hand out to steady Potter—the stupid git still couldn't Apparate without stumbling—and took a good look around.
had I been so insistent on annoying Potter? It definitely wasn't because I wanted to see him without his clothes. Weasley was way off the mark, there. I didn't
Not that Harry was very materialistic; he thought he had had a fantastic birthday. He just expected his friends to get him
“Don't I just. Well, if you've stopped acting crazy, shall we go and heal some hapless wizards and witches of their ailments?”
“What?” Harry shouted at the guard who was now stood in front of him, blocking his way. “I need to see someone.”
“Welcome to your first session here at Holding Hands,” Glinda said once they were all seated in one of the larger rooms. “For the next couple of hours, we're just going to talk. There will be no gimmicks or tricks, just us as a group letting our feelings out. My colleagues, Shelley and Howard, will be sitting in on this session, as they'll be taking some of the groups and I'd like you to get to know them. Any questions before we begin?”
Harry was slightly apprehensive; he hadn't actually socialised with any of the other guests—besides Draco—since he'd arrived. Pulling himself together, Harry stood up and joined the small group heading towards the tennis courts.
A closer look at the dreaded pamphlet had put paid to his usual plan. Draco hadn't thought that the weekend could have any more bad points until he'd spotted the three little words in a jaunty script at the bottom of the description.
Trying his best to ignore them, Draco finished Harry's back and turned for Harry to repay the favour. Harry started rubbing it into his shoulder, and Draco moaned. Mortified, Draco quickly shuddered.
Hermione had taken the time to explain—with diagrams and props—the complexities of floo travel over great distances, but Ron had switched his brain off halfway through the explanation of the Floo Network Authority and their work with their foreign counterparts and only knew that it was impossible. Ron had managed to talk to Harry over a crackly phone line a couple of times, but Hermione always moaned about the cost, and Harry complained about Ron shouting in his ear.
“Thank you, Gwilliam. I have some very exciting news for you, dear listeners! The moment we've all been waiting for! The trailer for the new Captain America film has been released and it's as amazing as you've all hoped.
The small pop of Grenville appearing in the living room had Draco jumping and spilling some of his whisky.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry said, pulling Draco to him, “I'm sorry. You know what I'm like with Quidditch. And there was a lot riding on this game.”
Before he knew it, Harry was facing the usual lunchtime rush. Harry had been expecting Draco to come in, as he had said as much in his note—the note that was now safely stashed with the rest of Harry’s favourite things in the second drawer down in the kitchen—but he hadn't yet. Thoughts of Draco were put aside, as the café was busier than usual. Harry barely had time to stop for a breath; he had no time whatsoever to actually
“Why do we have to be here,” the first policeman had asked, the look of disgust clear on his face as he said the last word.
Picking up his quill, Harry started to write. He wrote about his feelings for Draco, and the depth of the love he had for him. He explained exactly what had happened that night, and how Zach had just climbed into bed with him, mistaking it for his own. Harry wrote about how he thought it was Draco, otherwise he would've thrown him straight out of the bed. He told Draco of how he hadn't seen Zach since he'd thrown him out.
As he sipped his tea, Harry opened and read his cards. There were cards from all his friends, but also from the wizarding world at large. Apparently, his fame hadn't waned in the years since the war.
After a tense visit with the elder Malfoys—who knew nothing of Draco's whereabouts—Harry had Apparated back to his house, hopeful that he'd find Draco sitting on the sofa waiting for him. Of course, all that Harry found instead was a living room full of his friends—and no Draco.
“Oh, fuck. Again?” Harry said as he tried to sit up. “Sorry, I must have drunk more than I thought.”
“Dog!” Harry moved forwards, as if to take the tree back when he stopped and looked thoughtful. “Hang on.”
Not that he particularly wanted to go around holding Potter's hand, but the thought of not fighting day in, day out was extremely appealing. Maybe it
After delivering the morning post (Hedwig was often relieved that she wasn't Draco's owl whenever she saw Darius struggling with the latest box of goodies from his mum), both Hedwig and Darius stayed at their tables. It was their job, after all, to watch their charges, and nothing at all to do with the free bacon.
.” Draco gestured to the empty space at the side of the table. “I'll just move this—oh, I'm so sorry!”
Harry entered the dining room and his mind was still swirling, attempting to make some sense of the fact that he was about to sit down willingly to have dinner with Draco Malfoy. Spotting Draco sitting at a small table near the large windows, Harry waved away the waiter and moved towards the man.
The letters were admittedly quite severe by this point, but it was in public, for Merlin's sake. What was the worst that could happen. We had our biggest fight to date, right there on the Ministry steps, with the world and his crup watching. I was certain that it would end up in the papers, but I didn't really care. I just wanted to get away from my insufferable boyfriend, so I did just that.
To let his boyfriend off the hook, more than anything, Harry let loose a spluttering laugh. The awkwardness broken, Draco quickly joined in before Ron sighed—Harry assumed in relief—and also burst into laughter, Hermione not far behind him.
Of course, his letters were full of happiness and funny stories, but Hermione knew how well Harry could put on an act. Harry had Molly to feed him and look after his general welfare. She had mentioned in a few of her letters that she had had Harry and Draco—a 'lovely boy so well-mannered', according to Molly—over for dinner, but Harry had no one else. His relationship with Ginny had dissolved completely after the war, and Hermione couldn't see Harry going out and finding himself another girlfriend.
I successfully avoided everyone but Blaise and Theo the first day. I just wanted to settle back into school; I could face the mutters and stares another day. We had no classes so it was pretty easy to do. Everyone else was catching up with their friends and enjoying the sunshine. All I had to do was stay in my room and organise my bookshelf.
“Of course. You can sleep in the room next to mine and Draco's. Draco made it look nice; he'll be glad that someone is getting some use out of it.”
“I didn't realise your problems were so bad,” Glinda said, finishing with a small shake of her head. “I'll have Milly and Tilly replace the double with two singles; will that help?”
By the end of the night, Harry was, and he couldn't even blame alcohol, starting to believe Draco. He'd even started calling him by his given name. Harry couldn't help it, not with the bloody git correcting him every time he said Malfoy.
Of course, Potter being Potter, nothing ever went as planned. I was ready for the usual 'We'll get you next time' and 'Lucky catch', and the very original 'CHEAT!' that Weasley, girl Weasley, and the rest of the Gryffindors were shouting.
Hands covered his eyes before Harry could react. “Don't panic. I don't want to lose my eyebrows again.”
Not wanting to risk Apparating and not fancying the prospect of the tube, Harry hailed a taxi to take him to Heathrow. As he arrived at the airport, Harry realised he owed Hermione a
Potter seemed to revel in it. Not content with simply talking about the Animus Charm we were working on, he'd talk my ear off about any mundane subject he could think of. I heard all about his struggles to keep up with his Potions (which wasn't entirely news), Weasley's lovey-dovey relationship with Granger (ew, ew, ew), and his plans for after school or the weekend (invariably Quidditch and a trip to Hogsmeade. Exciting stuff).
“Woo! Go me!” Harry stepped back from the now-assembled, but still wonky tree and looked at Dog. “I didn't say that. Shush.”
Draco looked confused and Harry couldn't blame him in the slightest. He'd never been very good at explaining himself.
I barely heard the cheers of my house-mates, nor did I feel my team-mates clapping me on the back. My mind was set on one thing: finding Potter and rubbing it right into his smug face. I'd waited years to do that, and nothing was going to stop me. I had my winning speech going over and over again in my mind on a loop. I was ready.
Harry kissed her on the cheek and ran out of the door. He ran through Diagon Alley, ignoring the calls and whispers that followed him. He ran without stopping, bumping into people and not caring. He just needed to get to Draco.
“As far as anyone could tell,” Harry said, climbing into bed with me, “Smith fired Avada Kedavra at you and you flew backwards with the force of a spell. I ran up there as quickly as I could, and found a pulse. I only remember telling people to move the fuck out of the way.
“I just wanted to talk to you without that lot,” he said, pointing at the house, “poking their noses in.”
WIMP test: negative. No wizarding infections of his mental processes. Brilliant news. WIMPs were hard to get rid of and would've kept him in the hospital for weeks.
Harry swivelled his chair around and pulled Draco down onto his lap. “Take my mind off Goblin Wars of the 1500s?”
Flopping back down onto the pillow, Harry had flashes of what had actually occurred the previous night. Had Malfoy really claimed to have come from the future? And, Harry thought with a stomach-dropping feeling that had nothing to do with his hangover, had they actually
Loud chatter broke out as the crowd clamoured over each other to get out of the restaurant. Harry didn't follow, he simply looked at Draco and frowned.
After unlocking the door, Harry showed Draco into the living room. Harry barely gave Draco time to appreciate it before kissing him again. “Drink?” he asked once he paused for breath.
“Darius, Hedwig, I know it's customary to have a few days off once finishing a case, but I'd like you both to make a start on this as soon as possible.”
“Now,” Weasley continued, “Harry wouldn't take on any other cases; he was obsessed with finding out who wanted to hurt you. Even invoked the name of the Saviour, he did.”
“I'm gay,” Harry said, interrupting her. “Or bisexual. I haven't figured it out yet. This is nothing to do with you, I promise. I don't regret what we did and oh, Merlin. Please say something...”
But now, as he stood beside the pool with the sun beating down on his uncovered body, he felt a pang of panic. He was going to burn. Badly.
Both he and Hermione had tried to go back to Harry's to talk to him, and after literally being blasted back to the Burrow, they gave up. They had even tried to send quickly-penned owls, simply saying how sorry he was, and asking to be given the chance to explain, but when the owl returned with singed tail feathers, they decided to wait until the morning.
Accepting the drink from the barman, Harry nodded his thanks and followed Draco to a table in the corner of the pub. Harry took his cloak off and folded it over the back of his chair.
Draco nodded and smiled at the man before standing and leading Harry into the hotel. “We need a holiday.”
After tossing and turning all night, trying to figure everything out, Harry decided it was probably best if he went into work early and quickly ran some tests before his shift started. Before he started accusing Malfoy—or showing himself up, more likely—he needed to make sure that he wasn't
I hadn't slept well, and it showed. Even my mother, who, despite not leaving the house for years, still looked beautiful every day, winced at the sight of me over an unconsumed breakfast. I looked around desperately for Harry, one of my friends or even Helen. I needed someone to speak to; I needed someone to find Harry for me.
Harry awoke to a strange feeling; one he hadn't felt for a long time: the feel of a hard cock pressing  up against his arse. He tried his best to think over last night.
“What's so bad about the books?” Draco asked, confusion evident on his face. “And what's felching got do with it?”
“Yes.” Darius stood proudly next to his partner. That blasted bravery kicking in eventually. “We should have more for you by the end of the week. We've left two capable agents observing them as we speak.”
Yes, I was Harry with Ron and Hermione and Molly. I was Harry with my friends and family, but it felt different with you. We'd known each other for years, yet we weren't exactly friends. Not yet.
Barry was rushing between the warring couples, trying his best to do his job and keep the peace. Draco didn't think much of his chances.
“Lazy bugger,” Harry said, lessening the comment with a kiss. “It's only around the corner; we're walking. And I can't guarantee we'd get there in one piece if we Apparated. I'm told that Splinching on a first date leaves a bad impression.”
And that was the problem. He couldn't tell anyone. Draco hadn't said that he couldn't shout it from the rooftops, but who the bloody hell would believe him? And Malfoy. Harry couldn't even imagine what he would feel about it.
“Hm.” Draco nuzzled into Harry's shoulder. “So I thought I'd come and see if you fancied an early night.”
“Nearly the same way, except I pinned the brochures to the wall and sent a spark at one of them,” Harry admitted, blushing slightly. “When did you get here?”
Ron was embarrassed. It was hard to admit that, but it was only to himself, after all. He couldn't believe he'd said those horrible things to the best friend he'd ever had. If only he could tell Harry why he'd said them.
What? Draco's grin slid off his face, his first thought was that he was glad that Harry had chosen the lasagne as well.
Which is how Harry found himself lounging on his bed with Draco, plotting how they would 'Save Their Holiday From The Bigoted Idiots Who Didn't Know Their Arses From Their Elbows, Or In This Case, Their Perverts From Their Naturists'. Harry really wished he hadn't let Draco name the plan.
“I just didn't want to talk about it anymore. Nothing else. Can you just leave me alone for a minute?”
Harry moaned as he felt a fingertip gently pushing into his hole. No, not yet! He wanted Draco's tongue! But he was lost, he couldn't form the words he needed. “Please...”
The next few days passed without incident. Harry didn't purposely seek him out, but if he managed to run into Draco at the pool, well, it would be rude not to talk to him. For hours. And it really wasn't Harry's fault that he and Draco always managed to turn up in the dining hall at the same time. Despite his words to Ron and Hermione, Harry found it was nice to have
Harry did as he was asked, bracing himself against the still-cool tiles with his hands, water running down his back. Malfoy started at the nape of Harry's neck, kissing his way down his back. Harry gasped as Malfoy pulled at his arse, opening him up. He could feel the hot water between his cheeks, knowing that he wanted
“But,” Fawkes said, and the group sighed, “we do have one more problem. The young Mr Weasley is not expected to follow his friends, even with the prompting of Miss Granger. We need an agent to take on the case.”
Well, Draco couldn't argue with that fact, but still. “Iron Man,” he said, throwing a cashew at Ron's head. “He was the one who risked his life to close the portal. He—”
On the other hand, Harry loved getting presents. Christmas, birthdays, he didn't really care. He just loved the anticipation of holding the gift in his hand and knowing it was his. Harry didn't need Hermione's words to tell him that it was also due to his deprived childhood, he'd worked that one out quite easily for himself, thank you very much.
Once the main course was finished—and Draco had to laugh a little at the state of his fellow diners; poor Bear had more food in his beard than the man could have possibly eaten—the desserts came around, thankfully served up individually. Without even looking to Harry for confirmation, Draco grabbed the server.
A growl came from the bed sheets. I squeezed Harry's hand and he calmed slightly. I could only imagine where the story was going.
“It sounds like it's doubles,” Tony said. “I haven't got a partner, anyone care to pair up with me?”
Hermione tended to humour Ron as he ranted on about some subject or other. It was usually concerning the 'cheating bastards' in the local Quidditch game or the quality of the Australian wireless programmes, so an 'ah' here and an 'um' there covered it perfectly fine.
“Draco,” Harry said once he had followed Pansy's order and resumed his place behind the counter. “What can I get you? Or are you just here to harass the staff?”
And so it continued. Potter never wasted an opportunity to say hello or nod in greeting in the hallway. Charms was the worst. We were—not of our own choosing, of course—sat next to each other and, for all intents and purposes, partners for the year. We were encouraged—
of their friends—he had determined that it was much too soon in their relationship. Zach owled almost hourly with brochures of houses and developments. Harry was overwhelmed, but he needed to make a decision, and soon.
“Not expecting to lose. How typical of you.” Malfoy's fingertips gently teased Harry's hole and Harry pushed down, trying to get more. “Luckily for you, I did come prepared.”
Harry nodded and they finished the rest of their meal in comfortable silence, until Draco had to remind Harry to hold off on the custard. It was quite quiet all around the dining room, the silence only being broken by Frumpy randomly making 'choo-choo' noises as she fed her husband.
“Merlin, Harry,” Arthur said, patting him on the shoulder. “You look like a condemned man. I didn't mean to scare you.”
Harry broke away from Draco, smiling widely. “I'm kissing my boyfriend. What the hell does it look like I'm doing?”
“It's why I didn't bother bitching about it when we found out,” Harry said. “He's a sneaky bastard and he'd only be mad if we left. Not that we could have, but you know. What about you? Why didn't you kick off?”
“Are you still sick? I thought you were just having a night in to have a wank or something. Shit, are you actually ill? Sit down; I'll run some tests.”
“Are you going to tell me about the thing? Or do I have to wait until the grand unveiling?” Harry asked.
As the song finished, Harry stood up and walked up to the cake, ready to berate his supposed mates—and rescue the poor man trapped inside it—when Ginny grabbed his arm and put her fingers to his lips.
“Sign in, and weigh your wand, and then you can get to wherever it is you're in such a rush to be. It's not as if you're the Minister.”
So, with the sun beating down on his and Hermione's front garden, Ron threw the door open and grinned.
“I...oh, fuck it. I don't want to talk any more. I need a lie down before lunch.” Harry started walking again, and Draco just followed silently, wondering what the hell had just happened.
It was amazing. A few days earlier, Draco had been fighting—as usual—with Harry and worried about his stay at the retreat. And now he was sat opposite his...well, he didn't know
When Ron told her that Harry had got himself a dog, Hermione was surprised. Not that Harry wasn't a dog person—on the contrary, Harry had loved dogs since he'd spent time with Sirius—but because she simply didn't see Harry as responsible enough to take care of another living thing. He was still young, and Hermione worried about him all the time. She had no clue how he was coping without her.
Apparently not, as the next time I saw you, I was in Diagon Alley with Pansy, clutching my Hogwart's letter in my hand and shopping for my school supplies. I could cope with the stares and mutters that followed me everywhere I went. I deserved it, after all. I just hoped that people could see it in themselves to put the war behind them sometime soon.
Quickly changing out of his Healer's robes—horrible, itchy things that they were—Harry threw some jeans and a t shirt on and went to give Brewin some food.
“Happy birthday,” Draco whispered. “Do you want some cake? Pansy made it. It might be a little big, but you know how she gets.”
Draco didn't know why Harry's words hurt him so much, but his head hurt too much for him to care. “Don't worry about it. Gah. I need a headache potion. And a toothbrush.”
Hedwig looked at Bob as if he'd grown an extra head. It wasn't that many hours ago that he'd assigned them the extra agents himself.
Ever since Al and Scorpius had become close, Harry and Draco had also become somewhat friendly. They'd moved past the polite 'Potter' and 'Malfoy' greetings, at least, and Harry had no issue with looking after his child for a little longer.
“To Draco!” Ron called, lifting his pint in a toast. “May he have a quiet night,” he added with a solemn nod.
Stumbling into the bathroom, Harry found a hangover potion, sorted himself out and went to look for his boyfriend.
“Hermione,” Harry whispered into his friend's ear while the others were busy watching Neville down a pint of something green, “I don't want to sound, erm, greedy... but I was just... wondering...”
“Bollocks, Harry. I popped out to pick this up this morning and skimmed it. It's basically us. Our sex life, there in black and white. You promised me—”
It didn't take them long to finalise all the finer details of the divorce. Ginny was making good money from her Quidditch so it was just a matter of who got the house and where the kids went. The house was easy. Ginny loved Grimmauld Place. She'd spent years decorating the house to just how she wanted it—long gone were the house-elf heads and screaming portraits—and Harry didn't really care about it. He instead bought a new house in a nice wizarding area with a lovely park nearby.
“No, it's okay. I need to talk to someone about it.” Harry's face brightened. “And seeing as how you asked, you can bear the brunt of it.”
“Oh, fuck off. I wanted to talk to you and that useless group of crap don't need to be around to hear it. They can get it on Monday.”
. Harry had made the simple mistake of telling Ron during a night out in the Leaky last week that he had decided to actually take a break. The following morning Harry had realised his mistake. He had woken up to what seemed to be a thousand owls, carrying what seemed to be a brochure for every wizarding and Muggle holiday spot in the world. He had vowed there and then that he wouldn't talk in public again without a
“I have some gossip for you,” Draco said casually, taking the steaming mug from Harry and taking a sip. “Apparently, the great Harry Potter is cheating on his gorgeous, rich, well-endowed boyfriend.”
After a leisurely breakfast, a relaxing swim, and more than a couple of chaste snogs, Harry was feeling a lot better. He only had a couple of days left on his holiday, and he intended to enjoy each one of them. Draco had been—
Their friends joked and teased them about all the years of hatred turning into a different type of passion, and Harry found it hard pressed to disagree with them. He and Draco had talked about it early on in their relationship, discussing what it might have been like if they had been friends in school. They had finally admitted that neither of them would've changed a thing, as they wouldn't be the people they were without the lives they had led. Draco had insisted that he wouldn't have used so much hair gel in his younger years, but that was about it.
“I've seen your bottom drawer, you know. Remind me to get you a Rubik's cube when we get back; you'd love it.”
—and huddled behind a bush. Looking over towards the man in question, he knew Draco's plan hadn't worked.
“What's the point? It's not like it would help with anything. I like you. There, I said it. You don't like me, so can we just drop it?”
Harry's heart warmed as Draco as good as admitted that he was also nervous. Draco gestured to the barman for two more drinks, so Harry took the time to look around the small pub for an empty table. Harry had thought Draco would've booked a table somewhere with menus written in French and prissy waiters. Instead, they had met in a pub Harry was familiar with—it was the same one they usually met in to start off their Friday nights outs. Harry didn't know how to feel about that.
Regardless, a few quiet words in everyone's ears and they all seemed to back off. Harry was a grown man. He could find his own man.
Darius and Hedwig tried to come up with a plan of action on their way to the castle, but couldn't think of anything that might even come close to working. Thinking back to their training, they decided instead to stick with the old faithful of observation and hope something sparked an idea.
“Certainly, we can look at that now for you, sir.” The shock was replaced by disbelief on Marie's face. “We can also look into some other resorts, if you'd like. When would you like to go?”
I spent the entire dinner time hiding behind Pansy, pushing my stew around the bowl and thinking about Potter. I had thought that he was genuine with his defence of me an my fellow Slytherins, but with his more recent actions, I had to wonder.
“She told us where to find Smith's flat. Dingy little place, with a small room absolutely covered in pictures of you. It looked a bit like Harry's trunk when we were in school, to be honest. OW! Sorry,” Weasley said, rubbing his arm where Harry had hit him. “Bad joke.”
Darius, too, was having the same thoughts of hopelessness. With all the huffing and glaring from Draco directed at the Gryffindors, Darius knew Draco's father would be 'hearing all about it'. But Darius also knew, not that he'd share it with anyone, that Mr Malfoy didn't actually know anything, and if he did, he thought himself far too important to deal with any school yard arguments.
“Anyway, like the master criminal he is, Smith wrote everything down in this creepy little diary—from each letter right down to his plan for your little speech thing.”
“No, it is. You didn't ask for it.” Harry removed Draco's shirt completely before throwing it off the bed. He lifted Draco's left arm and placed a gentle kiss on the wrist. Draco gasped as Harry ran his tongue slowly up his forearm.
“First of all,” Hermione said, squeezing his hand slightly, “no, I don't think many people use gay for happy any longer. It fell out of use in the early twentieth century, although I'm sure I heard Professor Dumbledore use it in that way a couple of times. But, anyway. Now I'm babbling.” She took another sip. “So, you think you're gay. Okay. Why is that?”
The Prophet—or any other of the gossip-mongering sycophants—didn't leave us alone completely though. No, they stopped printing hateful words and instead found a new angle. We were now a hot topic and, in the words of Finnegan, the new 'It couple'.
Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco was leaning into him and kissing him, pushing Harry against the back of the sofa. The angle was awkward and Harry's elbow was digging into Draco's ribs, but with a few subtle shifts, they were flush together and Harry knew that finally—
Harry stopped his attempts at Draco's buttons suddenly and his mouth opened in shock. How the hell could he be so lucky? A strip-show from the man he'd been gawping at for months? Harry had to resist the urge to pinch himself; he was sure he must be dreaming. At Draco's gentle nudge, Harry released him and climbed onto the bed, propping himself up against the pillows. He was damn sure not going to miss a second of it.
“If you feel like you have a serious problem with this, please come and see me and I can see about trying something else. The last thing I would want to do is make you uncomfortable.”
As Harry opened the shop, and wondered whether Pansy would turn up today—it was a Monday, after all—Harry was startled by the tinkle of the bell above the door. It was too early for customers—the
“Oh.” Draco blushed slightly. “I was ready, so I thought I'd come and...” Draco trailed off and gestured to his drink.
“Hey, now, you know the rules. No details about what you two get up to, and I don't tell you about the time Hermione—”
Harry stopped talking at the sound of laughter coming from behind him. Very familiar laughter; laughter that Harry hadn't heard in six months. Moving slowly, Harry turned to face him.
After deciding that the life of an Auror was not one for him, Harry had left the Ministry and walked to his favourite tea shop for a pecan pie and a cuppa. When he had reached the run down shop that had been happily serving him without fanfare since he'd left Hogwarts, Harry was aghast to see the '
Draco had never had a more awkward breakfast in his life, and that included the time his mother had popped in unexpectedly while he was
“What are you doing?” Harry squeaked as Draco sat down beside him and took Harry's head in his hands.
You told me to call you Draco. We'd gone past the pettiness of our youth. We were grown men and if we wanted to talk to one another, we should use our given names.
not the case, Nott.” Draco waggled his eyebrows and put his arm around Harry's shoulder. “I highly doubt any book could stand up to what we get up to in private. For instance, the other day, Harry surprised me at work. Never thought a potions store room could be a turn on, but Harry did this thing with—”
Draco put his hand out and Harry fell back onto the sofa. “No. I thought my boyfriend found me irresistible enough that he couldn't wait till we got home. I thought I'd hit the jackpot. A boyfriend who was creative in bed and hot as anything. Never had better sex in my life, and now I find out it was a lie? How much of you is just copied from a bloody two knut knicker-wetting book?”
In pubs and workplaces all over the country, the latest films were the hot topic of conversation. And The Avengers had a whole generation of witches and wizards enthralled.
The chorus of 'Doubles!' made Harry's smile drop. He didn't have a partner; looking at Tony, Harry shot him a frown.
Harry and Draco sprang apart as the horrendous sound reverberated through them and the unmistakeable noise of thousands of shards of glass falling to the floor echoed in their ears. The two jumped to their feet only to see the shadowy figure fleeing into the dark and the massive front doors of the hotel scattered around the courtyard.
“Because you can tell us,” Hermione continued, obviously oblivious to Harry's discomfort. “We're your friends and we support everything you do.” Hermione finished by putting her hands over Harry's.
Harry nodded, so maybe it did. “I've got this,” he said, handing Draco a tube with a large number 50 on the side. “Hermione made me pack it when she looked to see what I needed to bring. I don't burn, but she started wittering on about getting ill and stuff. It was just easier to bring it.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, a tendril of hope rising up. “You're the best. And Hermione, it really is good to see you home.”
Harry groaned as cheers sounded all around him—including Ron's. People were leaning over each other to pat Harry on the back, and Harry gave Kingsley a look that he hoped showed his irritation. Kingsley must have taken the hint as he cleared his throat and once again called for silence.
Draco coloured slightly but snootily stuck his nose in the air. “It was a perfectly good name, if I recall it correctly.”
As Harry listened to Draco ramble on about how he'd been an idiot and how he wished he hadn't started it all and how he was so sorry, he realised that he didn't need to hear it. Harry
to see that film. Draco, had not particularly given a shit what they saw—he had just wanted to see some stuff blowing up—agreed. Big mistake.
“I've been in Wales with Mother and Great Aunt bloody Gwendolene. Potter,” Malfoy said as he studied Harry's results. “Are you sure you're not ill?”
I told you about my time with Ron and Hermione in the tent. I talked about the dragon and the vault. I told you how your mother saved my life.
Draco was still in shock as he walked down to the dining hall for lunch. The house-elves had replaced their bed for singles, so that was something, but not nearly enough. They had, of course, tried to leave, but every time they'd reached the front gate, Glinda, a house-elf or a one of Glinda's assistants would be there to explain how they were stuck until Monday.
? Had Draco visited him as well? Or, Harry thought with horror, had Malfoy just been playing a joke on him all along?
“Pansy,” Draco greeted calmly as Harry tried to covertly clean himself up, “how nice to hear your dulcet tones this afternoon. Harry.” Draco looked at him with warmth in his eyes. “Hi.”
“Oh, get over yourself,” Draco said before Glinda could speak. “This is what you always do. I'd be perfectly happy to just get on with you; I have tried to be your friend. But you have to go and start with the insults. It's getting fucking old.”
Harry didn't know whether to be relieved or worried that the three most common causes of 'episodes' had been ruled out. Running every test on himself that he could think of, Harry had only one diagnosis: he was the healthiest person he knew. No infections, his brain was working normally, he hadn't had any magic performed on him. Nothing.
Dog wasn't thinking rationally though, and after an unsuccessful afternoon of trying to torment Harry, the risks were outweighed by the thought of finally seeing Harry annoyed. Creeping over to the fireplace while Harry had his back turned gathering all the boxes, Dog pushed the penguin with his nose.
“What?” Harry asked quickly. He was glad he didn't have a drink at this point as it would now be tipped into his lap. Beer and cocks did not mix. Unless...
“How do you know what I'm thinking?” Harry, knowing that Draco couldn't see him, stuck his tongue out and silently congratulated himself on his irrefutable logic.
Harry didn't give a shit what Draco loved, all he could think about was Draco's cock in his arse. But he loved Draco's voice in his ear, telling him how much he wanted him. It made him—if it was possible—more turned on.
He couldn't have been more wrong. “Aaargh!” Harry screamed as every single brochure came flying towards him. Some even had staples.
There was no other way to describe it, Dog was simply bored. If there was no one around to annoy or play with, he thought he might as well have a sleep. Yes, he thought happily, snuggling into the sofa—the nice, white sofa he wasn't allowed on when Draco was about—a sleep would be perfect.
Following the small group into a thankfully shaded area, Harry took a proffered drink and sat down to listen to the man talk. He wasn't the most comfortable he's ever felt; he'd never felt over-dressed before.
Ron and Hermione had sat there, dumbfounded, as Ginny ripped them a whole new one. She told them, in no uncertain terms, that she wasn't stupid, and she'd seen the way they'd been acting. She'd seen the eye rolls and polite grins, and, perhaps most tellingly, she's heard them outright bitching about Harry and his new boyfriend.
Harry couldn't do anything but ask Malfoy for a pint to apologise for breaking into his—and Harry was more than a little shocked to discover that Malfoy had bought it—shop, and Harry fully expected that to be it.
The waiter—obviously not wanting to get in the middle of a domestic—nodded once and left as quickly and quietly as he'd arrived.
Draco, too, had confided in Harry that he was out of touch with his own friends. Pansy and Blaise had been pressured into marriage immediately after the war, and were travelling around Europe, enjoying the company of the—in Draco's words—'beautiful people'. Harry took that to mean 'rich'. His other friends from school were either locked up in Azkaban, dead, or simply hiding in disgrace.
Thanks to McGonagall's speech—which I still wish I'd been present for; it sounded amazing—not only were we not going to prison (except Greg; trying to curse the wizard sent to remove your tracking charm is never a good idea) but we were actually going back to school.
“Well—” Ginny blushed slightly before straightening her shoulders. “—they're, for lack of a better word, porn. More specifically, gay porn. And quite graphic. Hence, Mum wondering if I knew what felching was.”
Flitwick's classes had become quite relaxed, especially for our year. We were, in the professor's own words, more than capable, and he trusted us enough to practice on our own once he was sure we had become adept at the basic charm. It wasn't unusual to see previous lessons' charms popping up in the classroom, as students practised charms they weren't so confident in.
I laughed. I couldn't help it and I definitely couldn't stop it. I laughed until Harry lifted his head to look at me. “Protego?” I said through the laughter. “How the fuck did you thing that was going to help?”
“I won't pretend to know what has exactly happened between you and Ginny, but I will say that we—myself and Molly—have noticed that things haven't been right between you for a while now.”
Harry noticed the slight blush colouring Draco's cheeks and was sure his own were a matching colour.
you almost shouted when you reached me and I couldn't help it—I grabbed you and hugged you. I was so happy for you.
“Fuck, I've wanted to do this for so long,” Harry whispered before raising his lips to kiss Draco fully.
“Mother organised it. She's been on at me for ages to 'find a respectable young wizard' and finally got tired of waiting, so she went ahead and organised a date with that French bloke that was at her tea party. Remember him?”
“Um, no, I don't think.” Something niggled at the back of his mind, and he realised that he did have something he wanted to say. “Actually, I have something. Yesterday, Harry talked about hoping to find that people can change. I wanted to just say that I was only a child back then—”
knocked his full glass of wine over the table. The red wine splashed right down the front of Zach's suit.
After a soak in the bath and more tea than he'd thought it possible to drink, Harry couldn't take it any more and called for his owl. He needed to find out what the fuck had actually happened and there was only one way to do that. He needed to talk to Malfoy.
The room erupted in noise, everyone shouting over everybody else. Someone muttered, “Not again,” but Draco wasn't sure who. He just knew he had to make his voice heard. Words merged as his friends shouted their views to anyone who would listen, but one sentence struck Draco and his temper flared.
“As Draco pointed out, there are perfectly valid trust-building exercises, but they are mainly for trusting somebody with your physical self. These,” she said, gesturing to the objects in front of her, “are to help trust someone with your heart.”
At his words, Kingsley gestured to his side and Dean Thomas stepped onto the stage, to cheers and calls from the crowd. Dean winked at Harry before bowing slightly. Harry resisted the urge to poke his tongue out at his friend; he was on stage, after all.
“Come on,” Draco said, taking Harry by the arm and leading him towards the bar. “If we have to be here, we are not staying sober. Come on, Weasley. Let's leave the girls to it.”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, still unsure of what the bloody hell was going on, even if it seemed he wasn't about to be killed by his soon-to-be ex-father-in-law.
And Malfoy talked. For hours. He talked about potions and spells and research. He detailed exactly how he'd managed to 'come back from the future'. He talked about how it was a recent—for him—development, and he'd been the one who offered to test it. Malfoy talked about how it was going to be used to look into people's histories and see what was making them sick, or which spell they used.
Harry smiled. A game of tennis was just what he needed. Yes, he hadn't played a game since he was ten, and no, he didn't relish the thought of his willy flapping in the wind as he ran about but it sounded like a bloody good plan. Nothing like naked sports to keep you fit and take your mind off your confusing thoughts.
They'd barely got halfway through the list when Draco finally snapped. His team was useless. One had the spatial awareness of a drunken teenager. Giant was so uncoordinated, Draco seriously worried that he was going to hurt himself or somebody else. Frumpy had the extremely annoying habit of screeching whenever they found something on the list, and once or twice, something that wasn't. Beauty seemed to think that everybody else was there to serve her; he could finally see where the Bear got his troubles from.
It was actually Ron who finally persuaded him that it was about time he found himself a girlfriend. Well, Ron, being Ron, didn't quite put it like that. It was more along the lines of: 'you can't keep slumming about our place in the evenings; we need some space'.
“Do you fancy a walk to the beach?” Draco finally asked. Harry was pleased to see the twinkle had returned to his eyes. “If you're lucky, I'll top up your sunscreen. The Muggle way.”
With a flick of his wand, Draco smiled happily and put Dog back on the floor. Dog looked at his reflection in the blank television. Perfect, gold. Now he looked even more like an idiot.
As beloved pets, the members of BAHAHAHAH had intimate knowledge of any small conflicts arising in the castle, and they would bring them to Bob, who in turn would decide on who should take the case. It might be simply re-routing mail from one recipient to another, or it could be finding whatever object might be causing an argument and placing it where it should be. Peeves was an ongoing case for them, as it involved a member always shadowing him and keeping him away from the general populace. It was, by Bob's own reckoning, his highest achievement to date.
“Yes, you all know about the belt thing. What you don't know is that our dear Harry here has a thing for—” With a flourish, Draco lifted his sleeve up. “—this.”
They were obviously romantically involved, if the holding hands and small glances were any indication. And when One smiled at Ten, Draco could see how happy they were. He couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing at the retreat.
want Kreacher dealing with them. The old house-elf had lost his barb over the years, but he seemed to have replaced it with a burning need to tease and humiliate Harry every chance he got.
“I can't wait,” Draco said, his fingers picking up pace, a third soon joining the other two. “I've been dreaming of collecting my prize. I'm going to enjoy this.”
Harry spends his days working with Malfoy and his nights with Draco. Confused? Not as confused as Harry.
Harry kept his face covered as Draco waved his wand over his groin, the warmth of the healing spell surging through him. Acting on impulse, Harry cupped his balls and sighed in relief as he felt no lingering pain. Looking up, Harry was shocked to see a strange look on Draco's face. Harry leaned almost imperceptibly forward.
“The ladies sitting over there sent it over for you, sirs,” the waiter explained, gesturing to a small table on the other side of the hall. “With a message: I apologise, and we'd love you two to join us.”
“Seriously,” Harry said, crossing his arms across his chest. “He's brave, strong and selfless. And he also saves the world. All without being a complete arsehole in the process.”
I was pleasantly surprised; for a fraction of a second I'd thought that maybe he wouldn't want the hassle. The look on Harry's face will live with me forever, though. It was pure devastation. He thought we would be okay.
” Harry gestured to the papers in Hermione's hands. “—literally happened on my desk last week, can you imagine his reaction to my writing this crap? He likes the fact that I write the books the kids are studying from these days.”
“Um, well.” Hedwig stood up straighter and ruffled her feathers. Not that the animals were sorted into houses, but she'd spent more than enough time in Gryffindor to pick up a few traits. “We've been observing the subjects and have a few plans in place. It's much too soon to expect any real results.”
It wasn't a long talk, nor a particularly exciting one. Draco had said: Let's get through this as best we can, and Harry had agreed. They had no other choice, so what else could they do. The rest of the hour was spent peacefully reading. Despite all their differences, they had never had a problem being alone together. Actually, Draco realised, Harry only tended to insult him when there was somebody around to hear it.
Draco sat quietly as each couple in turn spoke to the group. He had no idea what he was going to say when it came to him and Harry, and he definitely didn't relish Harry speaking up. He'd have the room hating him before the session was out, and Draco was enjoying having people treat him like an actual person for a change.
“Morning, Potter!” Malfoy cheerfully called as he barged into the lab as he did every morning, the door slamming into the wall behind him. “Are you feeling better?”
Draco nodded and yawned before turning over. Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist, squeezing slightly so Draco back was flush with his chest. Harry’s wet cock slid into the slippery crack of Draco’s arse and Harry groaned.
Harry was a nightmare to feed. The man simply could not stop laughing. Draco knew it as probably from nerves, but that didn't make it any easier. It was like trying to hit a moving target.
Draco thought that Harry had cheated on him. And it pissed Harry off. After his third failed visit to Croatia, Harry decided something: enough was enough. He had tried everything he could. His friends had tried everything they could. If Draco couldn't—wouldn't—listen, then Harry was giving up.
Dog knew exactly what was in that box and he wasn't sure if he wanted to risk playing with it. Draco's porcelain penguin. More loved than—if Harry was to be believed—Dog, Cat, Owl, Teddy or even Harry.
Harry also wrote under the nom de plume Joshua Starkweather. And Joshua Starkweather didn't write textbooks. He wrote erotic fiction. To be more precise, highly pornographic stories about two twenty-something wizards and their incredibly exciting sex life.
“Ahem,” Neville interjected suddenly, “so was Hawkeye. Also someone without superpowers. Just him and his bow, if you'll recall.”
Harry made his way through the crowds to his check-in desk and he noticed something. Not one person took more than a second glance at him. Harry could've gladly stayed there forever. Here, he was just another traveller, making his way. He liked being the only wizard around. Harry couldn't wait to see if his entire holiday would be the same.
Harry had even resorted to talking about his birthday in an effort to distract them. He took Hermione into Flouish and Blotts and showed her some titles he would quite like to read. He took a Portkey to see Ginny to ask her outright for a new Quidditch jersey. Harry had taken Ron to WWW and pointed out exactly which new products he liked the look of.
They needn't have worried. It seemed as if the entire school was gathered in the entrance hall, some even hanging precariously over the banisters to get a closer look. At the centre of the group, as expected, were Harry and Draco, but they weren't fighting. Not at all.
To Harry's horror, he found he didn't mind. And to Harry's utter shock and—though he hated to admit it—relief, Ginny felt the same way.
would get me a copy. Pansy summoned one off a timid looking Ravenclaw and glanced at it quickly, a growl rising in her throat as she, too, moved towards the Hufflepuffs.
in bed. I was asleep. I would've kicked him straight out if I'd have known. It was just a stupid mistake. I don't see him about any more; he's made himself scarce for some reason.”
Really, as angry as everyone was at him, Smith was lucky to get off with only an expulsion. According to Granger, selling Hogwart's secrets was incredibly frowned upon. She did quote—at length—an old case involving some students from many years ago, but I was too busy seething at the time to listen to the details.
Harry and Draco had already started on some of the upstairs rooms, but the downstairs hadn't been touched. Zach, Ron and Ginny had been a great help, coming over to the house every day after work to help Harry paint. Pansy had been over to 'help', but as her help consisted of shouting out orders and something she called 'delegating', Harry told her she didn't need to come over as often. Blaise had proved himself to be a brilliant tea maker, so Harry told him to come over whenever he wanted.
Ron and Hermione, as it turned out, didn't have a problem with Harry being gay, or the fact that he had a boyfriend. They assured Harry that their response to Harry's 'dog' still applied, and that they were simply glad that he was happy.
Harry sipped his champagne and laughed and joked with Draco. The sun was shining and Harry thought he'd never want to get out. He would have to get a jacuzzi for his house.
Even the thought of Lucius Malfoy walking around in his pyjamas was not enough to dampen Harry's arousal. “Ready?” he asked.
“You're more than powerful enough,” Draco blurted out without thinking. It was true; if anyone could see how powerful Harry was, it was the man who watched him using magic all day, every day.
. Harry knew the damn words by heart. The volume of his voice rose as Harry washed the dishes—by hand; it was so much more satisfying than magic—and he must not have heard the tinkle of the bell above the door.
Of course it was bloody worth it. He'd tried his hardest to get where he was, taking actual blood and tears to get there, and it would take more than a weekend with Potter to get him to leave.
A small 'humph' sound caused Draco to look up, straight into Potter's grumpy face. Why the hell did their desks have to be directly opposite one another? As if they didn't see enough of each other in the field. Curse their 'compatible magic' and all the hoo-ha that went with it.
Harry didn't have an awful lot of wandless magic, but this was one spell he had practised and practised until he had it right. “
Despite this, it was weeks before he let Draco kiss him again. Harry wanted to make certain that it was what he wanted before he got too involved. It wasn't for the lack of trying on Draco's part, though. He had apologised for being so forward the first weekend and kept his distance, but he didn't stop his flirting.
Draco smiled. “There was talk in the office of a grand piece of art to be unveiled tonight. It was going to be a statue or a portrait of you. We thought that you probably wouldn't like it. They were also worrying about how they were going to fund it, so I offered to pay for it, as long as we had the final decision on the subject matter. Hermione used her place as your best friend for clout and Dean offered to do the actual painting.”
, they all laughed and said your name as if... Well, I don't know why. I just assumed it was because you were gay and that's why... Oh, I don't know. Can we—”
It was amazing. People didn't want to talk to me about the war. Of course, they praised me and talked about me 'winning' the war. They didn't want to actually discuss the war.
Malfoy's right eyebrow raised in question. Harry smiled and answered by pulling Malfoy back to him, their hard cocks sliding against each other. Malfoy laughed and flipped them, Harry's back slamming against the tiles.
Their first attempt was pathetic. The wheels fell off as soon as Harry placed the egg on top, which caused the whole car to fall to pieces. For all his bravado, Draco had never actually built anything with wheels before, and Harry was simply useless.
More drinks were handed out and, thankfully, talk soon returned to the normal bantering and teasing. Mainly about Ron and Hermione's upcoming holiday and just how sunburnt Ron was going to get.
So, that would be a no on the sharing their problem, then. Draco, blushing profusely, simply sat down and set about pouring his and Harry's teas. Harry, also a little red-cheeked, simply ignored the titters and added some sandwiches from a passing tray to his and Draco's plates.
At the sight of a dripping wet—and bloody hell, Harry appreciated the view—Draco climbing out of the pool with a smirk on his face, Harry knew he hadn't.
Draco threw the shirt in his hands onto the already towering pile on the bed. Giving up, he called for his favourite elf and handed him the leaflet. Grenville would know exactly what he'd need for a weekend in hell.
The Minister for Magic, having worked with Muggles before, had started adapting a few Muggle ideas for the wizarding world. One of these was the Muggle tradition of placing a blue plaque on the wall of 'houses of interest'. With the new blue plaque attached beside his front door, Harry's house price had shot up and, unsurprisingly, so did the number of actual buyers.
“Firstly,” Glinda said as they walked into her room. “I see that your partnership might have progressed?”
Harry didn't know if it was with hope or dread that he reached a hand across the bed to see if he had slept alone, but he knew he felt stupid when his hand only met cold, unruffled, obviously not-slept-in sheets.
Well, that didn't really help Harry figure anything out. “What the fuck is going on? And tell me exactly so I don't misunderstand
*  Potter would plead to be assigned to a new partner. This, Draco silently agreed with. But it would be a warm day in Scotland before he'd speak up in support of anything Potter had said.
“No, Draco, no. It was me, I promise. All me. I find you irresistible all the time and can very rarely wait to get you home. I want to give you all the best orgasms and it's just me. All me.”
Dog rolled his eyes. Why Draco liked Harry was beyond him. He was a numpty. Yeah, he gave good scratches and would walk him for miles, but he was a numpty. But never mind that, he had a plan to put in action.
“Fuck.” Draco sat up fully, but didn't climb off of Harry's lap. “Yes. I meant to talk to you. You know, before we got this far. I didn't know this would happen. We got carried away. I'll—”
“Like this, then?” Malfoy asked, wrenching his head up, fingers digging into Harry's arse, edging towards his goal.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, knowing full well what she meant. He still would prefer to talk about it in private, so he kept quiet.
Hermione shook her head. “It's written into his contract that I don't discuss him in public. No specifics, anyway.”
Harry couldn't see Draco's face, but he assumed that the wry grin he had so enjoyed seeing was present.
love you. Both of you.” Harry rubbed his temples. “Why didn't you just fucking ask me out, like a normal bloke?”
“Yes, he's been on the bestsellers list for an entire year. His sales have helped our mortgage to be paid off.”
“It's hot as hell. Hermione, I don't want to hear a lecture about how 'it's fetishising gay people', okay?”
Harry waited for the last remnants of dizziness to disappear before opening his eyes and looking around the room to find out where he'd be holidaying.
“I'd love to, but Zach is coming over. He said he'll help me decorate. He has a flair for it, or so he says.”
“Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!” both Harry and Draco whispered at the same time before looking at each other and grinning.
“Don't act like you don't know what I'm on about.” Draco pointed a finger accusingly at Harry. “That bit Pans read out seemed a bit too familiar. Me and you in the pub toilets not six months ago. You said those exact words before you gave me one of the best orgasms of my life.”
Of course, Harry being who he was, and Draco's father being what he was, the press soon found out about their relationship and Harry and Draco found themselves plastered on the front of every wizarding publication.
After shaking both of their hands, the woman gestured around her. “We've been waiting for you. I'm Glinda, the owner and brains behind the operation. Welcome to Holding Hands. Have a cup of tea; we'll be starting in a minute.”
“Just say it; whatever it is.” Harry bit into a Rich Tea, starting to feel a little annoyed at his friend.
Harry turned around and wiped ineffectually at the blood pouring from his nose. He felt his cheeks flame and wondered how there was any blood left in his body to cause his cheeks to flush. Grabbing a towel off the rack, Harry tried to stem the flow.
Weasley smiled and I couldn't help but sigh in relief. My chest throbbed slightly to remind me where I was.
When Draco was on a mission—and that's what he saw their little treasure hunt as—he was used to Harry being there with him. Harry, with his perfectly honed skills. Harry, who flew through the air like a ballerina—not that he'd ever mention that to him—when in hand-to-hand combat. Harry, who helped Draco and knew exactly what Draco wanted. Harry, who didn't make stupid annoying noises that would make Draco want to strangle him.
Harry finally emerged from the little changing room, his body strangely glistening. “What's the matter?”
Yes, Weasley was probably doing it for the benefit of his girlfriend, but Potter seemed to be genuine in his indignation.
Pansy's question drew Harry out of his thoughts and straight back into his—thankfully customer-free—café. Harry had been talking her ear off all week on the subject. They were sat at the counter of the café; the teatime rush had been and gone and they were enjoying the last of the warm summer with the door open.
Between Mrs Norris' mutterings about how she could do better, Trevor and Crookshanks' apologies and the groups general chatter, Bob could feel a headache coming on. And having as big a head as he did, that was no laughing matter.
“Fine,” she said, rolling her eyes and putting the book away. “Draco, you can have it when I'm finished.”
All around the hall, the gobsmacked looks of the students and the members of BAHAHAHAH were echoed in even the professors' faces. It certainly hadn't been what anybody—animal or human—had expected to see.
Harry rested his head on her shoulder; he could feel the wetness on her cheek and he hated that he'd made his friend cry. “If I was honest with myself, probably the same thing. What am I going to do?”
makes you happy then we will stand behind you through it. You will always have a place here, understood? Now I'm going to stop talking before I say happy again.”
Draco didn't say anything as he trudged back to their room. It was only once they were at the door that they realised that they were holding hands.
Draco couldn't even think Harry's surname. It was Harry or nothing—or was it? “Git!” he shouted loudly. “Sorry,” he said, “just testing.”
Ron shook his head—well, he did have a huge slice of battenburg in front of him—and Hermione held her cup out for a refill.
“Yes, they're on the table,” the man said without moving. “The sun was much better over here. Don't worry, I won't be long.”
Harry had been nervous about Draco coming in for his lunch. Which, he knew, was silly. After all, Draco had been popping in on a daily basis for weeks. Everything seemed different now; a good different. Harry now knew that Draco had been in to see him, not Pansy, and that thought made Harry tingle just thinking about it.
We were protected while we were at school. Reporters did try to gain access to us through our Quidditch matches or other days when the school grounds were open to the public, but Professor McGonagall made certain that we were left well enough alone for the most part.
Harry was pleased to see—not that he acknowledged it—Draco's look of horror at the waiter's words. The waiter easily popped the cork and poured both Harry and Draco a glass each.
“I'll just get the wine,” Draco said, standing up. He obviously tried to glare at the man who had dared to interrupt them, but the smile on his face diminished it considerably. Harry thought it best not to say anything.
Hedwig had never been more grateful for Harry's habit of not sealing his letters than she was at that minute. The look of suspicion slowly slid from Darius' face as his beak opened in surprise.
, he's dropped his wand in shock. Malfoy, in turn, obviously startled by Harry's unexpected appearance, had stunned him. By the time Harry came to, Malfoy was talking to Aurors who soon left after establishing what had happened and if Harry was all right.
Silence reigned as someone—Draco didn't have a clue who—abruptly turned off the wireless. One second stretched into two before all hell broke loose.
it before. Maybe it was the fact that Harry wasn't constantly insulting or sneering at him, Draco didn't know. He just knew that rubbing the lotion into Harry's back was giving him butterflies in his stomach.
They thought he'd got lonely and bought a dog. And that he was so messed up that he'd named it Draco. What the fuck?
The members of BAHAHAHAH dispersed, many offering consoling pats on Darius and Hedwig's wings and some (Mrs Norris) sniggering at their likelihood of failure as they passed, yet Darius and Hedwig didn't move. They had questions they needed the answers to, and only one squid who could give them.
Harry had never seen so much of Draco as he had in the past few weeks. He was used to Draco popping in once or twice a week on his way to work for his morning coffee and a quick chat, and Draco usually dropped by on a Friday to see what plans he and Pansy had for the weekend. But recently, Draco had been in the café nearly every day. Harry thought that Draco might be getting a slight caffeine addiction. Harry had tried to talk to Pansy about it, but she was no use at all. Unless you counted an eye roll and the usual '
As the weeks turned into months, Harry grew gradually more annoyed at Draco. Yes, he was caught in bed with another man, but he was innocent. As his annoyance grew, it turned into anger. If Draco had such low trust in him, then why had they been together originally? If the tables had been turned, Harry was sure that he would've at least heard Draco out.
Scoffs and laughs echoed around the group, many not believing what they were hearing. It had to be a joke. It was impossible. Darius thought there was more chance of Mr Malfoy taking tea with Mrs Weasley at the Burrow.
Harry dragged himself out of the pool and went to dry off naturally in the sun. Draco had had a quick swim first thing and buggered off, citing a desperate need for a massage. Harry didn't like the thought—or the thought that he wasn't liking the thought—of some nubile young woman running her hands all over Draco and was doing his utmost to
Even if I could have gathered some courage to talk to you that day, it would have been impossible. I don't think any one of your friends would have welcomed my presence. And, of course, me being dragged off by the Aurors probably wouldn't have encouraged anyone to let me anywhere near you.
“Ah, is it too bright? How about this?” Harry flicked his wand and the bright white turned to a shimmering gold.
Harry winced. He dreaded to think what Ginny could come up with for her 'big one', but the thought of Molly fussing over him made him grimace. He loved Molly, but she was a force to be reckoned with. She'd been bad enough at his first wedding. As nice as it was to have someone mother him—and he did love it—he was nervous enough without her making it worse.
Apart from a trip to Wales months ago, Harry and Draco hadn't been on a 'proper' holiday together, so Harry was determined that it was about time they did. He had gathered as many brochures as he could find, and had them all piled up on the kitchen counter for when Draco finally got home. Surely they could find
Hermione had been stupidly happy when Harry had told her he booked a holiday, and was determined to find out where he was going. Harry, while not embarrassed by his choice, didn't feel the need to tell her. He'd told her that he was going away for some peace and quiet and didn't want, or expect, any owls.
with you. I mean, if you want to, I do have some—” Harry blushed and Draco coughed. “—but I did just mean sleep. I haven't slept as well as I have the last couple of nights for a very long time.”
“No, I'm not sick,” Harry said. “Of course not. See, healthy as anything. Just must've had too much to drink at the weekend. You know me and wine.”
A groan came from all corners of the room. Draco obviously wasn't the only person that was unhappy about that little statement.
Harry groaned again and gripped me tighter, raising his head to kiss my arm again. I was sure I could hear the word 'sorry' over and over again.
Harry blushed. He could be so stupid at times. He searched for something else to ask, but Malfoy laughed suddenly, interrupting his train of thought.
So, when Ginny suggested that divorce was the next logical step, Harry was stunned and, if he was completely honest with himself, maybe even a little horrified. He wasn't to know that it was to be one of the best things to ever happen to him. He wouldn't have been so hesitant if he'd known that it would lead to him being the happiest he'd ever been.
Draco was pretty sure she'd forgotten no such thing. The bloody woman was grinning like a Cornish pixie.
Hedwig hit him with her wing. “I know, but we need someone to keep an eye on him while we figure something out. Do you have a better idea?”
All the thanks and Christmas goodies for G for her help with this. As usual, it wouldn't have a title or a summary without her ♥ Written for
The day I rounded a corner to see Potter and Weasley, of all people, defending a second year against the snide comments of their dipshit of a friend Finnegan, I knew something had changed. Something good.
Hedwig quickly swooped down and gently grabbed Arnold and brought him to the group. Crookshanks rushed forward to check him over and Pig gathered a few drops of water for him in his wings.
Bear was practically growling at Beauty as he forcibly rammed the plastic rods into connectors. Ten and One weren't even at the same table any more, each building a separate car and glaring at one another. Grumpy and Frumpy were working on the same car, but the language they were using on one another wasn't exactly romantic and caring.
Today, though, Draco was out—work, he'd heard him moaning about—and Harry had been up in the attic for ages. Teddy wasn't visiting this week and the other animals were up to something. No good, probably. Owl was out flying with her owl friend. She denied it vehemently, but Dog knew they were more than friends. Cat was out doing whatever the hell cats got up to. Dog was just glad he was out. Cats smell. But they were fun to torment.
“Breasts, Harry. Boobs, knockers, funbags. Any number of the lovely euphemisms I've heard in the common room.”
After assurances that it was definitely okay, the boys excitedly went about sorting spare pyjamas and toothbrushes and said goodnight. Harry smiled at their antics and held up the bottle Draco had brought.
Malfoy still had his back to him. Harry tried his best to concentrate on his anger and not the water running over Malfoy's arse. He
Harry didn't need to be told twice. Taking Draco by the hand, Harry led him into his bedroom; he only hoped Kreacher had thought to tidy up after the girls makeover session.
Glinda walked around the room, handing out pieces of parchment and pens. “Again, once you have shared, you'll burn your partner's parchment, and reiterate that they can trust you implicitly. And please, feel free to share as much as you want.”
“Harry and I are simply Auror partners. Nothing more, nothing less. There's been some misunderstanding and we'll just be going now, thank you. Sorry for wasting your time.”
I didn't know where Potter was and I didn't really care. All I cared about was getting the snitch and when my fingers finally closed around that perfect little gold ball, it was the happiest I'd felt in a very long time.
Zach quickly ran out of the door before Ginny could let off her first hex. The friends were all quiet, looking at Harry and Draco.
Harry had to stop himself from laughing. “You went to see Draco first thing; he wouldn’t tell you anything so you thought you’d try me?”
“Yeah,” Ginny said, “but no one else was subjected to it, so we don't know. But there's no way Thor would have fallen for it.”
Dog waited patiently. As much as the branches tickled his mouth, he was very much enjoying the game.
Yet all of that didn't make up for the feelings of guilt and hurt when he thought about his best friend stuck—all alone—at home.
The only time that Hermione had tried to sit closer to him than she usually did, Ron accused her of being drunk and had taken her straight home to bed.
“No!” Draco looked aghast. “None of that. Fuck, is that what you think? No. I just didn't want to ruin our friendship. I thought—stupidly—it was a good idea, to see if you actually liked me. I
After Harry had worked himself open, Draco quickly slicked his own hand, pulled Harry's hand away and pushed his own fingers into Harry's pulsating arse. “You'll have plenty of time for that when I've gone. It's my turn to play.”
I always initiated conversation. Week after week, you talked more. You answered my questions with more than one word answers, but still—I talked and you answered. The routine was the same. I walked into the pub, whether alone or with Ron, and you were sat at your table in the corner. I'd either wait for Ron to go home or, if I was alone, I'd walk straight to your table. Without fail, by the end of the night, I found myself plopping myself and a couple of pints in front of you and saying,
“And what about you?” Darius asked, picking up the pygmy puff in his claws. Gently, of course. He didn't want to know what Bob would do if his favourite member got mangled.
“Now that I think about it, I'd better get home and give him something to remember me by.” Draco winked at the group and Harry started choking again.
“Please, ladies and gentlemen,” the manager called loudly, “I apologise for the disturbance. If you would like to move towards the other bar, my staff will bring you all some drinks. On the house, of course.”
I knew I had a matter of minutes before we were face-to-face and my brain whirled as I wondered what to say if you'd even talk to me. As we approached, I turned to Pansy to excuse myself, only to see her face hard and determined. Before I had a chance to say anything, Pansy walked up to you and started talking about how she had been scared and was sorry for her actions.
Reaching the door to the chapel, Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek before leaving to find her seat. Another door opened, and Harry was overwhelmed at the sight of his almost-husband in his suit. Harry had to admit that puce was now his favourite colour, seeing how it looked against Draco's skin.
“So,” Ginny said once everyone was once again settled into their seats with fresh drinks. “What do you think of the Falcons using illegal players?”
No! I didn't make it up. I promise. I just knew what a stubborn bastard I was and I didn't want to waste a moment. I know I like you and I'd hoped you liked me, but I didn't want to ruin our friendship by saying something so I left it. And then, things happened and it was too late, and I thought...”
When the girls proclaimed him to be completely ready, Harry looked at the clock and noticed that, even if he walked to the pub, he would still be half an hour early. He stood up at the girls' urging and slowly turned around. Pansy had a gleam in her eye, Ginny was pretending to swoon and Hermione looked as if she was about to deliver a 'be careful' speech. Pansy must have noticed it as well, as she grabbed Hermione by the elbow and pulled her towards the door.
Glinda handed the box now full of wands to the tiny elf from earlier, and Draco felt a momentary spark of panic. He didn't feel complete without his wand, and hadn't been away from it since Potter had given it back to him after the war.
So Draco listened. He heard about Bear and Beauty's worries over their starting a family. About Bear's insecurities and Beauty's 'ticking clock'.
Harry needed more. The feel of Draco's cock inside him, the feel of Draco's fingers digging into his skin. It wasn't enough. He wanted Draco deeper. Harder, faster. Harry pushed himself back as Draco picked up speed. Yes, yes!
Harry was surprised to see not only the usual crowd, but his friends from work and Quidditch were there, along with Ginny and Neville. Harry was touched that they would both travel back to celebrate with him.
Harry doused the small flame and peeled the brochure off the wall. Drying it with a wave of his wand, Harry reeled back in shock at what he held in his hands.
at her and mollified her slightly. Ron had sat up straighter upon hearing that Harry was 'going Muggle' but, thankfully, had not gone further than that. Harry wouldn't have even told them that much—he didn't know why exactly—but Hermione was the only person he knew who had actually visited an airport.
Draco had planned on talking to Harry more about what was going on with them during dinner, but he found himself having a great time anyway. He had a lovely conversation with Frumpy, where he heard, happily, that she and Grumpy had really seemed to fix their problems. Mouse was similarly sure that she and Giant had a happy future, and were even thinking about coming back to Holding Hands again. He hadn't even needed the wine; he was having quite a pleasant time.
Ron grinned and kissed Hermione to shut her up. He'd had the perfect idea. What could be better than a trip to the cannons and a couple of pints to fix their friendship?
over. Finally, thankfully, over. I could've cried with relief myself. We barely had a proper childhood thanks to that noseless bastard, but it was done. Finished. And it was thanks to you.
Ron just wished that it was possible to connect a floo from Australia to Britain. He wanted to see for himself whether Harry was actually happy, or just putting on an act. It wouldn't hurt to say hello to his mum as well, but that brought up images of her 'popping' over to see them three times a week, and Ron wasn't sure he wanted
Harry smiled. He and Draco had finally declared their love for one another, and Harry had to suppress his glee at the causal way that Draco said it to him now.
The Mouse told them all how she hoped the weekend would help The Giant realise that she didn't care if he had two knuts to rub together, she just loved him. The Giant wanted to be sure that she wasn't just rebelling against her father.
The rest of the family also were surprisingly fine with his announcement—Harry suspected his ex-wife had something to do with that—and his friends didn't care. As long as he found himself someone soon and stopped acting like a 'third wheel', they were happy.
Harry didn't sleep much that night. He tossed and turned, wondering if he'd done the right thing. His gut instinct told him he had. He wanted to
Harry looked so happy while he and his fellow dancers pretended to spray deodorant and run around with their arms in the air being 'Superman', Draco couldn't help joining in. He blamed the wine, but deep down he wanted to be as free as the rest of them.
“You know,” Draco said quietly, “when I woke up this morning, I didn't know if yesterday was real or not. Did Harry Potter really spend the day chatting with me?”
Dog dropped to the floor. Bloody hell. Why did Harry have to spoil his fun? Dog's one cheery thought was that of Draco's face when he saw the tree moved from its rightful place and chucked haphazardly in the window.
Harry subconsciously moved closer. Draco had only ever touched on the war and its after-effects. Harry was glad to hear him talk so freely; maybe the fact that they were invisible was helping Draco feel comfortable talking about it.
Draco did know. The therapist his mother had made him visit had told him that his sudden penchant for brightly coloured plastic toys was due to longing for a childhood or something along those lines.
They'd had good food, great whiskey and their usual mix of witty banter and debate. The wireless had been playing good music—another thing the wizarding world had thankfully adapted from the Muggles.
“Yes,” Draco said, thankfully interrupting his babbling. “I'm gay. As they come, actually. And damn proud of it. But I don't think that's why your friends reacted the way they did.”
He stabbed at his lettuce and glared at Harry opposite him. Harry, for his part, simply sat there and ate his sandwiches without a sound. He hadn't spoken to Draco since they'd gone back to their room for Harry to take his nap. Draco had woken him when the lunch bell chimed, and Harry hadn't even looked at him before dragging him down to the dining room.
Upstairs, their—thankfully en suite—bedrooms could be found, and Draco was mortified to see that he and Potter were expected to share. His horror only grew once he and Potter were ushered into their room. There was only one bed.
Ginny was grumbling under her breath about twats taking liberties, and every couple of minutes stood up, raised her wand and promised to make sure that Zach never had the chance to climb into anybody else's bed. Harry was inclined to let her; Hermione wasn't.
The group's chatter about what they had just witnessed was silenced upon reaching the lake. The majestic sight of Fawkes standing beside Bob (and a fully recovered Arnold) most effective.
Harry was frozen in his chair as people ran about to get away from the flying glass. Harry had to grip the tabletop tightly to keep himself from pulling his wand out. A quick glance at Draco told Harry that he felt the same way.
The morning after, Harry woke up and figured he had two options. Ignore the fact that he'd discovered kissing men was as—if not more—enjoyable than kissing women, or go and talk to the one person he'd discussed the important stuff with since he was eleven.
“And this one?” Hermione shook the papers in her hand. “The people are desperate for more Anthony and Steve.”
“It was great,” Draco said, trying to decide between the chicken al fredo and the mushroom gnocchi. “Iron Man was bloody brilliant. He's got to be my favourite. I wouldn't mind seeing it again. We'll have to see if the gang would be up for it.”
“Us? Finally getting a clue?” Draco clinked his glass to Harry's. “Or we could just toast the great Harry Potter's belt kink.”
*  Kingsley would say—shout—something, usually including the words: 'Supposed to be adults', 'Partners', 'Support structure', and—Draco's favourite—'If you didn't work so damn well together...'
“That's not all,” Weasley said, wiping his eyes and taking something out of his cloak. Placing the paper on the bed, he walked to the door. “You're a lot more famous now. I really don't think the papers are ever going to leave you alone.”
“Okay. I know—well, I've realised—that it wasn't just you. The fighting, I mean. I know it was both of us.”
Draco incinerated the notes that had arrived in quick succession after that incident. The look on Harry's face told Draco that it was either the letters or the—damn Harry and his wandless magic—owls themselves. Don't Avada Kedavra the messenger, his mother had always told Draco, and he wisely chose
After spending his formative years believing that divorce was the worst thing that could happen to a family, Harry was positively shocked to discover the opposite to be true. He was happier than ever; he felt free, as if a weight had been lifted off his chest. The family seemed happy too; no one seemed surprised by the news.
Yet, after Ron stumbled back into the floo, holding his bloody nose, Draco took it all back. All he could do was hold Harry and wonder what the fuck had happened.
Draco, Harry. I'm the man who kissed your neck and and made you scream. I'm also your friend. The man you've worked with day in, day out. I'm real, Harry. I promise you.”
Harry let out a laugh at his friend before turning his attention back to the man in front of him. “Why? What? How?” was all that he could say.
“Hermione!” I called over the small crowd of politicians and Ministry workers, all reciting their speeches and presentations.
“You two are the best I've got, and I have faith in you. If you two can come together and work as well as you do, I don't see why your owners can't.”
“Oh, yeah.” Harry had the good grace to blush; he could be so stupid at times. “Sorry,” he added to Draco.
Harry had had to hold Draco back from hexing the men. Harry was only doing so to stop himself from hexing them on principle. Law providing was only for people who acted 'normal' apparently. Bigoted bastards.
Harry waved Ron and Hermione off as they left for the village, ignoring the pang of jealousy that flared when they happily linked hands. Enough
a fucking idiot. Hermione's sorting out a Portkey. I need you to looks after this place. Will you, please? And will you let Ron know where I've gone? I'll just take some cash from here; I'll sort it—”
Draco put his arms around Harry and hugged him. “It's only six months. What's that in relation to the rest of our lives?”
Well, that answered my question. “I, erm, stayed with Mother last night; I was looking for Harry myself.”
After a quick lunch at the café adjacent to the beach, Harry and Draco had started walking back to the hotel. Their hands were dangling loosely at their sides, neither one willing to move that extra inch. Harry could see the hotel coming into view and knew that it was now or never. Or tomorrow. But he couldn't wait until then. He took a deep breath and moved his hand over slightly, brushing Draco's.
“That's for one week. On the sole condition that I tell her every sordid detail. But that's beside the point. How is it a holiday if you have to work? Will you at least be home at the weekends?”
Harry sighed as he shuffled through the brochures, stopping every now and again when a sandy beach—it wasn't the guys in shorts, honest—caught his eye.
“Yes, we'll be here,” Pansy answered. “Honestly Harry,” she added once the door had closed behind Draco.
Yes! It was that time again. Dog couldn't stop himself pawing at the box. He loved Christmas. It wasn't the presents—a new squeaky bone was lovely, but it was the same thing every bloody year. It wasn't the food. Dog was more well fed than any dog he knew all year round, thanks to Draco. No, Dog just loved the sparkles.
The three of them had sat around the kitchen table till the early hours as Ginny explained exactly how lost Harry had been when they'd first decided to move abroad permanently. She—in great detail, to Ron's horror—described how great Draco had been and what he'd done for—
“So he didn't tell you that I was coming home. He wangled an invite to stay, and then climbed into bed with you; knowing that I was expected home by morning.”
Neither Harry nor Draco seemed to be able to leave a room without giving the other a kiss—whether it was a peck on the cheek or a full blown snog depended on the time of night and how much alcohol they'd imbibed. The two of them sat so close together on the sofa that Hermione had difficulty discerning whose limbs were whose.
“This doesn't concern you,” one of the men sneered at Harry and Draco. “Take your little boyfriend and take a hike.”
“I would like you to call me Draco. I know we tried it before and it didn't work, but it's different now. I call you Harry; why can't you call me Draco? And it would help you distinguish between the two of us.”
As Harry took all of Draco into his mouth, he heard a crack against the wall. Draco must've banged his head, but Harry couldn't bring himself to care. Harry knew there was nothing like having a thick cock in your mouth. The feel of your lips stretched open, the weight of the cock on your tongue, filling you up—Harry couldn't get enough of it.
He'd had an owl from Draco, saying that he was stuck in work, but he could ask his mother to collect him. Thankfully, thinking back, Harry quickly replied that it wasn't necessary and that the boys were engrossed in some comics and to come by when he as able.
, and one short interview—including one picture of Harry and Ginny together, post-divorce—and they were left alone.
“I think you'll find it's 'Man-Who-Lived', thank you,” I said, still staring at the paper, it not quite sinking in.
“Of course. Wouldn't miss it. It's not often we're all in town at the same time. It'll be good to see everyone. And Draco said Theo and Ginny are home from America, so he's looking forward to catching up.”
Silence reigned, and Harry was pleased to note that it was not an awkward one. It was the kind of silence that Harry enjoyed: one you shared with friends.
“Yeah, and who's going to stop us?” The woman laughed as her friends bent to pick up the bloodied man.
“Welcome,” the man said once everyone was seated. “I'm Barry, and I'll be leading this afternoon's session. In front of you is a Muggle building toy. The aim of this activity is simple: I want you to build a vehicle that will transport these—” Barry walked around the room, handing out eggs to each table. “—down that ramp and along the track.
“I don't think you're evil,” Harry said, his speech slurring a little. “Evil people don't play with children's toys. Well, maybe when they were children. I don't know. I think I'm drunk.”
Harry felt the cold rush of air across his skin and was surprised to see himself stark naked. He was definitely going to have to learn that spell. He stepped forward and pulled Draco down for another kiss, a sigh escaping his mouth as his bare cock brushed the soft fabric of Draco's trousers.
Harry sent an owl to the hospital, requesting a couple of days absence. He was pretty certain they wouldn't turn him down as he hadn't missed a day of work all year and he wasn't the only person qualified to run the ward. It didn't matter, anyway. He wasn't going in and that was the end of it.
I hadn't realised that my plan had solely consisted of ways to get Potter to undress. It most certainly hadn't been my intention. My plan was to annoy the hell out of Potter and get him to leave me alone. I wanted things to go back to how they should have been, with me and my friends against Potter and his cronies. Not in a 'my blood is better than your blood'-Voldie way, of course, but in a general, good old 'Gryffindor versus Slytherin' way.
Draco simply smirked, placed his hands on either side of Harry's face and kissed him. Harry couldn't move; he just stood, unmoving, until Draco stopped kissing him, and stepped back. Harry hated the look of sheer horror on his face, knowing that he caused it.
“Hey!” Harry jumped backwards. Every cell in his body was telling him to shut the fuck up and carry on, but Harry steadfastly moved away. “What are you doing? You make all of this up, just to kiss me? You could've just
“I don't think so,” Draco said, breaking Harry's thoughts. “So, you're the bastards who think we're all pervs?”
No, the thing that Draco found disappointing was set up along the wall near the kitchen: a bloody buffet. Draco didn't think of himself as a snob—not a huge one anyway—but there was something he found extremely unsettling about buffets. The thought of so many people touching his food was the least of it. Germs, insects, airborne viruses. Eurgh.
Malfoy grabbed Harry and kissed him again. Hard. “Does that feel like a bloody hallucination to you?”
to be folded at a page with something he fancied was printed. Ron was easy: Harry simply mentioned a product from George's shop that he might like.

And he did. Draco trusted Harry Potter with his life and had never once felt unsupported or at risk when with him out in the field. It was true about their 'compatible magic'; it seemed to become one when the two of them fought side-by-side. It wasn't only the magic though.
“No,” Weasley said quickly. “Nothing like that. She wasn't trying to hurt you; she didn't send the letters. She didn't actually know that she was doing anything wrong. You see, she had a secret boyfriend she didn't want anyone to know about. Zacharias Smith.”
All trainees had undergone vigorous tests to determine their best fit in partners. Horribly, and unbelievably, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were, in the words of Kingsley, a match made in Auror heaven.
Harry knew he shouldn't have left work. He was pretty sure that his patients would be fine. There were no tests planned for the afternoon and the assistants were more than capable of dishing out medicine and keeping an eye on the ward in general. Besides, Harry thought, he'd left Malfoy there.
Falling from the ceiling was a red velvet curtain, hiding the entire left hand area of the stage from view. Harry wasn't worried about the curtain, no. That was just a curtain. Harry was worried what was
I spluttered and tried my best to come up with an appropriate response as Granger, for some unknown reason, started smacking Weasley on the arm. Potter, for his part, looked absolutely horrified. I couldn't talk. The only word I could come up with was 'No', so I simply shouted that and did what I could.
“Hmm, I have to disagree,” Hermione said firmly. “The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, they all have reasons why they have power. They were given to them—they're false.”
Not wanting to drag it in case he chickened out all together, Hermione had barely taken a sip of her wine before Harry blurted out, “I think I might be gay.”
No, Brewin was soon found to be cuddled on the lap of the person once again drinking his tea and eating his biscuits. Draco bloody Malfoy.
Harry decided to floo straight home after work, so he could get himself organised and work out exactly what he was going to say to Draco. He'd just finished making the tea—and putting out Draco's favourite chocolate digestives—when the kitchen door opened with a slam.
Thankfully, Harry arrived at work with only seconds to spare, and he barely managed a 'hello' before they were besieged by hapless assistants and more patients than he could count. It was ten o'clock before he had the chance to stop for a breather.
Harry grinned at her, shouted goodbye to her and Hermione and dragged Draco towards the door. He had a
Harry and Draco worked diligently, making sure their egg was secure before building the rest of the car.
The article was just the beginning. Within days, the Howlers and hate mail started arriving. Professor McGonagall, who was fast becoming one of my favourite people, was extremely quick with her wand, banishing the offending red envelopes before they made it anywhere near us students. Any she missed, along with any hateful letters, were deftly dealt with by the quick wands of Granger, Ginny, Blaise and Theo.
As soon as Harry turned back to the boxes, Dog once again took a hold of the tree and dragged it across the floor.
“Write him a letter,” Pansy repeated. “He won't see you, or talk to you, but he might read a letter.”
Both Harry and Draco looked forlorn at the interruption. The booming voice came closer and Harry reluctantly sat back in his chair, still holding on to Draco's hand. Zacharias Smith had tried his best to ingratiate himself with Harry and his friends recently. He had taken over from his uncle's estate agents, and kept trying to persuade the group to buy a new house. He was nice enough, but slightly over the top at times, as evidenced by the fact that he was wearing a white three piece suit.
Hedwig flapped around the meeting place, more than a little impatient at having to wait for Darius. He was supposed to drop Pig and Arnold off and come straight back. He was probably off preening himself in front of the girls in Slytherin again. The pompous git.
“Don't worry,” Harry said, earnestly. “I haven't heard them. I was going to suggest Scorpius stay for the night.”
Writing textbooks was simply gathering information and collating it into words that wouldn't bore children to tears. After all the research he had done with Ron and Hermione in school, it came easy to Harry, and he enjoyed the feeling that the kids in Hogwarts wouldn't be stuck with the terrible books he had had to study from.
I had no excuses on the second day of school, though. Professor McGonagall had welcomes us all back to Hogwarts and warned the entire school that Hogwarts was no place to air any leftover grievances. The war was over, she'd insisted, and it was time for us to try and move past it.
Harry ignored the meaning behind that statement and latched onto the chance to ignore his feelings for two minutes. “Do you remember what you named the plan?”
“I know. But then he handily got himself sent to prison, and my mother is just glad we made it through the war alive, so she is perfectly happy for me to live my life as I want to. It means no more Malfoys, but I'm not sure she cares.”
After a cup of tea—and whatever potion Molly had slipped in with it—Hermione calmed down enough to rationally think about the whole situation. It wasn't the fact that Harry had a boyfriend, not really. Hermione didn't
“I think I could ask you the same thing,” Harry said coolly. “How the fuck did you get into my house?”
“Again, welcome to Belle Playa. My name is Tony, and I have been working here for ten years. I love it here and can guarantee you will enjoy your stay! Before I show you to your rooms, I have to inform you of some of our rules.
Harry fully expected to walk into his house afterwards to see Malfoy sitting at the kitchen table, eating his biscuits. He was very surprised to find himself feeling disappointed upon seeing only Brewin waiting for him.
“Oops.” Harry finished his drink and stood on shaky legs. “Thank you for a lovely evening; can we do it again?”
mind. He just had to think of something to say. Ignoring the looks of shock on his friends' faces, Harry walked onto the stage.
Bleary eyed, but determined, Harry arrived at work early, wanting to get there before Malfoy. Harry didn't know what he was going to say, or even if he was going to say anything that day, but he wanted to get in early to calm his nerves before Malfoy got in.
was stupid sometimes. The many visits. Draco always sitting next to him in the pub. The talking. The smiles. The touching of Harry's arm. Pansy's eye rolling made sense now.
Harry couldn't think. His brain was trying to process the words 'six months' over and over again. “Six months?”
Harry swished his wand, turning the volume on the wireless up as he cleaned around the café, righting tables and chairs and setting the brush to sweep the floor. He sang a song that had been played to death on the wireless; a song about having
As my plan progressed, I found myself having a lot of fun. My friends simply rolled their eyes whenever I mentioned the plan. Pansy even patted me on the hand once as if I was a child. I had no idea what that was about, and I was too busy with Potter to figure her out. The rest of my ideas were going swimmingly.
Before Harry dropped off to sleep—thanks to another Malfoy special—Draco elicited a promise that they would meet with Ron and Hermione to see what the whole fucking mess was about.
She didn't look too concerned, though, and sure enough, Harry was back within seconds. Instead of sitting back down, Harry strode purposely over to Draco, took his hand—and not in the way they'd practised; Draco knew his hand was going to hurt later—and dragged him out of the door.
“That's it. Not too bad, is it?” Glinda chuckled and everyone let out a collective sigh of relief. “Oops! I forgot the most important rule!”
Harry was torn between screwing his face up in disgust and laughing out loud at the towel rule. It made sense but he really didn't want to think about other people's sweat on the loungers.
Harry gasped as Draco's fingers slipped from his arse. He didn't have time to mourn their loss as Draco's cock slid in, causing them to both cry out at the same time. Harry braced himself against the tiles and pushed back, forcing Draco deeper.
was overwhelming. So Harry gently pushed Draco against the wall, placed one last kiss onto his lips and slowly sank to his knees.
I spoke up for you. That'd be creepy. And I promise I won't just attack you in the showers. I just wanted to let you know. Just in case.”
“Is that so?” Bob pulled himself closer to Mrs Norris. He didn't like being interrupted at the best of times. “Did anybody else witness this altercation?”
“Soon,” Harry replied. “I've arranged for Pansy to look after the café. You've been working so hard; surely you can take a week off.”
As a result of their new found fame as the 'in couple' of the wizarding world, Harry and Draco had been hard pushed to find somewhere to go out for dinner in peace, and Harry's house had been turned into a no-go area. After all, how was anyone supposed to have a nice romantic evening with the press camped outside, banging on the door or ringing the bell every five minutes? Harry had threatened them with the Aurors, but they had had the nerve to laugh at him. Apparently, there was no law against ringing a doorbell. Harry thought he might have to do something about that. Draco had hexed the damn thing, but apparently there
Harry thought long and hard about what to write in his note to Draco, but in the end settled on one word:
Harry was gratified to hear the crack in Draco's back as he moved towards the sink. Harry had been worried he was getting old.
Harry Transfigured a cotton bud into a toothbrush for a grateful Draco, and as they stood side-by-side at the sink, Harry was hit by how—there was no other word for it—right it felt. Harry smiled at Draco in the mirror and couldn't resist the urge to take Draco's face in his hands and kiss the life out of him.
According to Harry—and reiterated by Granger when she saw my disbelief—the Weasley family were equally pleased that Harry had found someone that made him smile. The Gryffindors tended to leave us alone if we spent time in the Gryffindor tower, which, to be honest, was most of the time, as Gryffindor House just did what they always had done: whatever Granger told them to.
Harry laughed as he fixed Draco's drink. Draco always moaned about his job at the Ministry, but Harry knew full well how much he actually enjoyed it. Apparently, the Undersecretary to the Minister for Wizard-Muggle Relations was a thrilling job to have. Harry didn't think that he could cope with working with Hermione, but Draco seemed to love it.
Harry turned his head and gaped at the sunrise emerging from behind the mountain. “Beautiful,” he murmured at the breathtaking sight. Reaching for Draco's hand, Harry smiled.
“Ah, I think I'll take my leave now, and let Bob here work out the details. Thank you again for your wonderful work. Keep it up.”
Despite his best efforts, Harry could feel himself starting to come within minutes. Draco must’ve noticed this as he sped up his movements, causing Harry to speed his hand up. Draco came with Harry’s name on his lips, shooting pearly streams over Harry’s hand and chest. Harry finally let himself go; moaning loudly and filling Draco’s arse with his come.
“What the fuck is going on?” Draco asked, pulling Harry to a stop. “And, ow!” he added, swapping their hands to a more comfortable position.
Shrubbery and fauna of every description surrounded the small courtyard. Draco assumed it was supposed to look pretty and welcoming, but he found it anything but. The garish colours mingled with the harsh scents and Draco found his eyes watering. Small groups of people were stood—awkwardly, Draco was pleased to note—around, their cups clattering on saucers as hands were shaken and greetings offered.
The members of BAHAHAHAH dispersed as they  reached the castle doors. The students and teachers might find all of their pets gathered together a little strange, even for a school of magic.  The owls took to the rafters to get a look while the non-flying animals hid in nooks and crannies and between legs. Mrs Norris, of course, didn't bother with that, sauntering right into the centre of things. Bloody show off.
They always know me. I want to smile. I want to talk to someone. I want to shag someone against the wall in some back alley somewhere, but I can't. Because they always know me.
Draco recognised the man speaking from the dining room, but hadn't spoken to him before. He didn't know his name; Draco just thought of him as Baldy.
Hermione nodded and blew him a kiss. Pansy winked at Harry before the three of them left him alone. Harry waved them goodbye and slumped down on the bed. He quickly jumped up and sat up straight as Pansy's words—'
“What?!” It hurt to shout so I settled back onto my pillow, hoping an explanation would be forthcoming.
Harry gaped as Draco left the café. His mind was in a daze. He knew one thing for sure, though. He was going to fucking
For Harry, it was difficult working with Malfoy, day in, day out. It wasn't because he was holding onto a lingering dislike for the man. No, that had gone away within weeks of them being partnered up. Working together in the small ward, they'd had to put their past behind them, and it hadn't been long until they were friends.
Since its inception, BAHAHAHAH had strived to maintain a semblance of peace at Hogwarts. Outside influences (that Voldie fellow that has people scared, for instance) and major conflicts (every member, especially Crookshanks, refused to get involved with Miss Granger and her crusade against house-elves) were out of their jurisdiction, but the day-to-day running of the school, that was the job they had undertaken for themselves.
Which was how Harry found himself lying in the sun—albeit on their favourite lounger—waiting for Draco to finish getting his frustrations out with a swim. Maybe Draco would forget about last night in his anger?
“You know,” Zach answered with a blush forming on his face, “saving the best until last and all that.”
As much as he was proud of his sales, Harry was slightly worried about what Draco would think of his other job. Draco had mellowed incredibly since they were in school, and wasn't so high and mighty, but he still had an air of pride about him. Finding out his boyfriend wasn't just the respectable author of history textbooks, but peddler of what was basically porn—he might find that difficult to stomach. And that wasn't taking into account that it was
It was all Harry's fault, of course. It was Harry who insisted on 'date nights'. It was Harry who had planned that date. It was Harry who had chosen the bloody film. It wasn't Draco's fault that Harry was delusional. Draco couldn't blame Harry completely, though. He could see why he would think it, yet it didn't make him any less wrong.
Harry poked his tongue out. “It was one time! And it was months ago,” he said, giving Draco the address anyway.
Draco smiled, nodded, and tried his best to think of an excuse to get out of the Golden Trio's re-bonding exercise.
The date with Derek—or The Broom Bloke, as Pansy called him—was a disaster, but that didn't stop Harry. He dated many men; he just couldn't seem to find one he liked enough to see twice. When the group of friends went out, Harry was no longer found sitting in the corner, nursing a pint. Harry flirted with man after man, acting as if he was having the time of his life. Of course, deep down, he was simply miserable.
. Letting loose a burst of speed, and a very uncharacteristic giggle, Harry took the lead and all but dragged Draco towards the lift. He had to walk quickly—he knew how frowned upon erections were, and his was about to cause a scene.
Harry dropped his head into his hands. Why did he have to ask? Why did he have to rock the boat? What the
Brewin's incessant mewling finally got him out of bed—Harry didn't need to be scratched by a hungry cat on top of everything else—so he gathered all his courage and dragged himself to work. Besides, Harry remembered, Ron and Hermione were meeting them for a quick tea break to talk about Pansy's birthday party. He couldn't miss that. They'd have him in charge of something horrid if he wasn't there.
I was determined to prove my worth and prove it I did. Just under forty minutes into the game, with Slytherin trailing 70-10, I caught sight of the snitch just to the side of the commentary box, the early winter sun making it sparkle ever so gently, and I went for it.
No, the reason it was so hard to work with Malfoy was the simple fact that Harry spent all day fantasising and reminiscing about what they had got up to in bed the night before, and Malfoy didn't know anything about it.
One drink turned into two, which turned into Merlin only knows how many. Every one of the group had work the next day, but no one seemed in a hurry to leave the pub. Sometimes even the most impromptu of nights out turned into great evenings. Pansy was in the middle of recounting one of her tales of a weekend with one of her boy toys, and the entire table was laughing at her story. Harry couldn't help but join in the laughter as she described—through her giggles—the poor boy's love of her feet.
Draco and Harry sat opposite one another, so close that Draco could see himself reflected in Harry's glasses. They held hands as they usually did, but Harry's thumbs rubbed across the top of Draco's in a maddeningly gentle way.
“What?” Malfoy asked innocently. “You can talk; I can hear you perfectly well over the noise of the shower, don't worry.”
Draco could only gape, not knowing what the fuck was going on. The look on Harry's face was one Draco didn't like at all. It usually preceded something bad.
As soon as they cleared the fireplace, Harry collapsed onto the sofa and closed his eyes. When the expected bump of Draco joining him never came, Harry opened his eyes to see Draco standing with his arms crossed and a strange look on his face.
They looked at each other and it was an odd moment, and one that Harry wouldn't have been able to describe to anybody else. Harry didn't know why he felt calm, but he did. He was enjoying spending time with Draco and he planned on continuing to enjoy it for as long as it was possible. It felt nice to do something for himself for a change, without the constant scrutiny of his friends and the entire wizarding world. It was simply—Harry couldn't think of a better word—nice.
“Right,” Draco said, “squishy. But getting back to the matter at hand, I don't know what Ginny's talking about, to be honest. Your kissing was fine. Good. No problems at all.”
“Now that Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter are friendly—” Fawkes pointedly ignored the sniggers from around the group, “—their respective groups should follow suit.”
Harry gestured for Draco to follow him into the kitchen, not sure what to say. Draco obviously had no such worries. They'd barely made it to the kitchen when Draco started rambling.
They played volleyball—stupid, unrefined sport, according to Draco—and splashed in the sea. Harry had caught himself staring at Draco many times and marvelled at the fact that he
The paper cranes were just one prong of my many layered, well thought out plan. I'd spent quite a long time when I should have been sleeping—who knew nightmares could be so useful?—thinking of new ways to annoy the hell out of Potter.
Harry did, unfortunately, remember him. Six foot of gorgeous with perfectly coiffed hair. Pierre? Pedro? Something beginning with a P anyway. Harry looked down at himself: not even close to six foot and hair that looked like it had never seen a brush. Fuck.

Word of Harry’s date with Draco must’ve spread around their circle of friends. Ginny, Hermione, Blaise and even Ron had popped into the shop throughout the morning, each trying their best to get some information out of him. It seemed that Draco was more tight-lipped than anyone had given him credit for.
It was after an evening where Harry and Draco had had one of their 'pity parties', and after drinking an inordinate amount of whiskey, that their relationship changed forever.
As Harry dried off he faced an even bigger dilemma. To dress, or not to dress? He'd been so comfortable in his nakedness the entire duration of the holiday, both with Draco's presence and without. But was it different now? Had anything changed? His internal questions were answered quickly.
Despite the attention, our lives moved on at a steady pace. We started our jobs; Harry training to be an Auror and I followed my father's footsteps and joined the Ministry. Not entirely like my father, I decidedly avoided the Minister's office, but rather chose a low level position in the Department of Magical Transportation.
“S-s-sorry,” Harry choked out, not knowing what the hell he was apologising for. “Sorry!” he said louder as Draco slipped down to his knees again.
After a rather large tumbler of whiskey—laced with a potion of Draco's own design—Harry was calm enough to listen. Draco, as much as he wanted to simply lock the floo until the two of them fucked back off to Australia, wanted to talk to Harry about
didn't want to find out any more about his and Hermione's relationship than he already did. The image of the two of them
“Oh, well this is surprising. This has never happened before. Because of the nature of the retreat, we make certain that guests are sure they want our help.”
“Actually,” Trevor cut in, hopping over to stand beside Mrs Norris, inwardly cursing his small stature, “I heard that they were comparing their most recent notes on the case.”
Draco counted eight other people—not counting Glinda—and everybody seemed to be in couples, which was unexpected. Draco assumed there would be some groups at this type of retreat. Scrutinising each couple in turn, Draco tried to determine what had caused them to attend the course. Surely they couldn't all have dreadful, overreacting, unreasonable bosses.
“Haha, not even you could unseat Wilson; she's on fire at the moment. I've never seen a better Seeker.”
Harry smiled and picked up the cuppa, taking a sip. Harry had to wonder how Draco knew how he took his tea, but then he realised that Pansy’s gossiping probably ran both ways.
Harry had never felt so lonely. It had been three weeks since Draco had gone back to Croatia. Harry hadn't seen or spoken to him since that fateful morning. Draco had even sent a very apologetic Blaise to the house a few days later to pick up Draco's things. Harry had taken the first Portkey to see him that he could, but Draco had refused to see him. He wouldn't allow Harry anywhere near him, and wouldn't listen to a word anybody said about him. He honestly believed that Harry had cheated on him. Harry couldn't blame him; he was sure that if he'd walked in on Draco in bed, wrapped around a naked man, he'd feel the same. It wouldn't stop him from trying to get through to him though.
“Of course. Let me just put my bag away and grab a cuppa and I'll be right there. Do you want a cuppa?”
The last couple looked more unhappy than any of them to be there. He had a face like a smacked kneazle—or wanted to smack a kneazle—and she dressed as if she were a seventy year old Muggle woman instead of an at-most thirty year old witch.
They had, of course, tried to ignore the pangs of hunger and hide out in their room, but again, a house-elf had turned up to remind them that, “Sirs be needed at lunch.”
“Bloody hell,” Draco exclaimed. “It's worse than we thought. They're attacking people now? Are you still up for the plan?”
Harry showered and changed, and within minutes was back downstairs. “Was that Draco?” Harry asked Zach, noticing the man standing up from the fireplace.
Draco was yawning widely when they reached the room, and he looked at his empty suitcase with a frown. He didn't want to be rushing in the morning, but he also didn't want to pack; he just wanted to sleep.
I didn't have a clue what he was playing at. Unless it was his evil plan to turn me into a blubbering buffoon who talked about his toilet habits in public, in which case he'd succeeded.
A small group of dark-clad people were crowded around a shadowy figure cowering on the floor just outside the gates to the hotel. Harry looked at Draco and raised an eyebrow in question. Receiving a short nod in return, Harry took out his wand and crept forward.
Draco almost squealed in delight as he and Harry entered the allocated room after lunch. The room was set up much the same as the dining room, with tables for two dotted about the place, but with trays of brightly coloured plastic instead of cutlery.
Conversation with you was easy. I don't know why, but it simply flowed. We'd discussed and put behind us the stuff from school. We talked about our lives now. You talked about your job and your friends and your life. I found myself enjoying hearing about it.
It all made for a, quite frankly, amazing final year of school. We studied, socialised, played Quidditch and generally enjoyed ourselves and it wasn't long before we were saying goodbye to the castle for the very last time.
Harry unfolded it and scoffed. “Tell me something I don't know! You wear a different pair of shoes every day of the week.”
Potter had just caught up to me on his way to Transfiguration, and with a nod and a genial, 'Draco', his trousers dropped, showing off a rather fetching, obviously new, pair of pants. Potter simply rolled his eyes and pulled his trousers up, but Weasley had other ideas.
“Yeah, you lot,” another of the men shouted out. “Walking around showing off everything—nothing more than an orgy. You
After checking out his room and unpacking, Harry undressed and, remembering his towel, made his way down to the pool. He did have a quick panic when he wondered where to put his room key, but on noticing what he thought was simply a decorative band was actually a wrist strap he relaxed. The hotel really did think of
After all, the problems only occurred in the office. Draco smiled as he thought about exactly what to say the next time they were called in for a 'meeting.'
The dining room was the same as it was at lunch, with the tables set for two, with only Glinda and her staff the exception. That didn't worry Draco, though. He was used to eating with Harry, and for all his bad habits, his table manners were impeccable.
Everyone at the table gaped at Ginny and Theo. Draco silently pushed two more shots in their direction.
Their second attempt was slightly better, as in the wheels stayed on, but the egg rolled straight off its carrier and only Draco's quick reflexes stopped them from having to go to Barry and beg for another egg.
Draco and Harry, being the fully trained Aurors that they were, emerged from the scrum first, plates stacked with fat baked sausages and thick cut chips.
Harry stood up and let the two owls in, instantly recognising Hermione's tawny and, to his great surprise, Malfoy's own eagle. “What?” he asked again, ripping open the notes.
Ginny arrived, right on time, and looking more radiant and happy than he'd ever seen her. After telling her so and taking her coat, Ginny shook her head and sat down, patting the sofa beside her.
Harry was feeling pleasantly tipsy, and with every sip of wine, he felt bolder. As he looked into Draco's smiling eyes, Harry knew that he wanted to do nothing more than kiss the man right there in the middle of the pub. Harry reached out a hand and entwined his fingers with Draco's. Draco leant forward and Harry was seconds away from fulfilling his dream.
“Ron,” Hermione said, elbowing him in his ribs. “I don't think it's a love potion. I know the side effects, and Harry doesn't have glassy eyes or increased perspiration. It must be something else.”
Knowing that it would be easier if he just sat back and let them do their work, Harry did just that. Following the girls to his bedroom, Harry sat back in his chair and waited for them to work their magic.
Dog couldn't even be bothered to mess with Harry as he transfigured bits of tinsel into gaudy, multicoloured plastic baubles. Harry was making enough of a mess of it on his own.
Draco drained the last of his whiskey and readily accepted the top up from Ron. It had been a brilliant night; Neville's birthday always was. Harry felt odd about celebrating his own birthday, so their group tended to go all out for Neville's.
Neither Harry nor Draco had the first clue what they were doing, with both admitting to being virgins. With a fair amount of lubrication spells and some quick thinking, though, they soon figured it out. And when Draco finally fucked him right there on his living room rug, Harry couldn't imagine it getting any better.
Apparently, my mother and I had saved Potter's life on several occasions and should have honour and not scorn. I couldn't fathom why—or when—my mother had saved him, and the only time I hadn't actively tried to hurt him was when I didn't identify him to crazy Aunt Bella at the Manor that day. (I wish I hadn't, by the way. The git thanked me by stealing my wand. No, I don't mean that, but still, the git stole my wand.)
It was all extremely mature, I thought. Of course, we copied it from Hermione and Weasley, but that didn't it make it less grown up.
“Firstly, the villa is just fine; thanks for enquiring. I just thought that if we could just get along, Kingsley couldn't force this shit on us.”
Feeling quite energetic and refreshed after his drink, Dog bounded back into the living just as Harry was carefully taking the baubles out of their boxes. He didn't mean to do what he did. Really, he didn't. He knew how much Draco loved his sparkly baubles. He couldn't help it, though. He just couldn't stop in time.
From the moment Harry had come running into his shop, waving a note in his hand and happily proclaiming that his fears were unfounded, Draco had thought that he'd had Weasley wrong.
“No, it wasn't!” Neville looked uncharacteristically pissed off. “Anyone could have fallen under his spell. The scythe—”
“But I would classify this as a major issue,” Darius said, trying a different tact. “Out of our jurisdiction. Their rivalry is too great. It's a fact of life. It can't be done.”
Hedwig and Darius nodded and took flight. They hadn't got far when they almost fell out of the sky at what they saw. Arnold was running across the grounds as fast as his tiny legs could carry him. The poor little mite looked about ready to drop.
cock it was, then quickly remembered the holiday, the champagne and The Plan. The fact that both he and Draco were fully clothed helped his racing heart calm down considerably.
“Thanks, it's one of my favourites; I got it from this shop in— Not the point. It's not the clothes; it's the holding hands thing.”
The insults and looks didn't stop when Draco finally became a fully-fledged Auror. On the contrary, Draco faced the worst of the insults and the dirtiest of dirty looks from the one person he had to entrust his life to: his partner.
“Don't you 'what the hell, Pans' me, Harry Potter. We gave you the perfect opportunity to tell Draco everything; to get everything cleared up. And what do you do? You walked away.”
“Ah, there you are,” Hermione said, grabbing my arm from behind. “I've been looking for you. Have you seen Harry? I can't find Ron.”
“I know,” Ron said, copying Harry's wince. “I wouldn't worry though. She just mentioned something about the summer holidays.”
It was nearing time for dinner and Harry found himself torn between returning to his solitary holiday and not wanting to bring an end to one of the most pleasant days he had had in a very long time.
Harry got up from his chair to grab the holiday brochures off the counter and handed them to Draco. “I want to go on holiday. With you.”
A couple of nights later, Harry managed to keep his dick to himself, so he and Draco actually got to the pub to meet everyone before the crowds. The only person already at their table was Pansy and she didn't even notice their arrival. She was too engrossed in her book.
A niggle of dejá vu hit Draco, but as Harry took his hand and entwined their fingers together, he forgot all about it.
*  Finally, Kingsley's eyes would drop in resignation and with a muttered, 'Get out of my sight,' Draco and Potter would be free.
Harry was quite aware of the problems his friends faced on a bi-yearly basis, so he had come up with a solution. After another year of Ron and Hermione literally dragging him to Quality Quidditch with a stern, 'Just choose something, Harry. For fuck's sake', Harry had started dropping hints.
I asked you to meet me in the pub after work for a celebratory drink and you invited Ron and Hermione to join us. It was amusing to see them both repeat their nodding from the second before. I'd never seen Hermione so quiet.
“Huh, what?” Malfoy looked up at Harry. “Yes, sorry. Morning, Potter. I have to finish at three today, so I came in early to get my whole shift in. Most of the prep work is done. I'm about ready to go out on the ward. Are you all right with that?”
“So,” Pansy continued, “you will either get behind the counter and start brewing, or you can get out.”
As Ron listened to Hermione talk—plot, plan—in bed that night, his mind drifted back to what he'd walked into. The sight of Harry ... doing that—it was shock, nothing else. Yes, he wanted—needed—nothing more than to talk to Harry. He just didn't have a bloody clue what he was going to say.
“Actually,” Mrs Norris stepped forward, an unnatural smile gracing her usually pinched face, “I observed Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy fighting in the fifth floor broom cupboard at morning break time. It was quite physical. It looks like the owls' plans aren't progressing well at all. Pity.”
“She knew—well, how could she not know—that you were gay, so don't panic; she won't be doing anything about it. She just liked the way you stood up for us. At the trials, I mean. We all did.”
“We were in school together. I don't know if I need to go over what happened when we were in school.” Draco looked to Harry for the okay to continue—he knew how much he disliked talking about the war—and he saw that Harry was wearing his 'I don't know how to say this' face.
Draco silenced him with a kiss. “I know; don't worry. It won't stop me from leaving you with a fantastic memory though.”
“And now,” the tinny voice on the radio announced, “your weekly entertainment update from Oswald Day.”
Draco couldn't think of a better idea, so searched his pocket for coins. “Heads,” he called as he tossed the knut he'd found in the air.
Harry had just finished cleaning up after serving a very fussy customer, who had caused him to spill coffee all over himself, the counter and the floor, when Pansy’s screeching “Draco!” made him want to run to the nearest door.
“Was that a hint of a compliment? And yes, well done; you beat a schoolboy in a school team during a school match. I'm surprised Puddlemere aren't beating a path to your door.”
Draco smiled brightly and Harry thought very soppy thoughts that he knew he would never utter out loud.
“He was twisted. He'd developed an obsession with getting Harry away from you. He sneaked looks at her diary and found out where you'd be and when. When he couldn't get to you at those places—because he couldn't risk hurting Harry, he resorted to the letters. He staked out places you were known to go and then yesterday...”
Harry had to laugh at the irony of it all. He'd broken things off with Draco because he was feeling guilty about having a secret affair behind Malfoy's back, and all the time he'd been seeing them both. Harry just had to get his mind around the fact that they were the same person.
Harry, unfortunately, had just taken a gulp of his beer, and he struggled to swallow it instead of spitting it all over Draco. “That's enough about that,” he said laughing. “I'm sure you've got a kink in there somewhere.”
Zach had promised that Grimmauld Place would be sold within the week. He had mentioned bidding wars or something, but Harry hadn't taken much notice; Draco had been eating a banana at the time. Harry had a couple more houses to look at, and then he was giving up. He'd have to sleep in the shop; he'd had enough.
Weasley glared at Harry and he shut up. “As I was saying, you were brought straight here after...afterwards. We didn't know if you were hit, or why you'd gone down. It all happened so fast. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself,” he said, taking a seat. “Let's start at the beginning.
Harry cut Draco off by leaning forward and kissing him back. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's back, Draco responded by snaking his arms around Harry's waist. Harry never wanted to stop kissing him again.
“When I fire-called that evening as planned, you were out. So I told him to let you know I was coming home for the weekend. He said he would.”
“I knew writing text books wasn't that lucrative. I didn't know what it was you were doing. I never imagined it was this! How could you keep this from me? I could have helped!”
So, they ate in silence, their only interaction was Harry passing Draco his cup of tea. Draco couldn't help but feel disappointed. After the success of yesterday, he felt as if they'd taken twenty steps back.
“Harry. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.” Draco shifted his chair closer to Harry's and took his hand. “We're going to be gone for six months.”
And so it continued. Harry's days were spent working with Malfoy as usual, and most of his nights were spent with Draco. As Harry started to get closer to Draco, he found himself becoming closer friends with Malfoy. Harry found himself asking more questions about Malfoy's personal life—even though he knew the answers—and enjoying listening to Malfoy talk about his family and childhood.
The biggest surprise for me was Weasley (and he will always be Weasley, as I'll always be Malfoy to him; it's a thing). I anticipated him being the biggest hurdle for me to overcome to a successful relationship with Harry, even with him being basically the reason we got together in the first place. I was wrong. His relief wasn't only due, as I originally thought, to Harry's incessant chatting, he actually was simply happy that Harry was happy. Even if it was with me.
The table erupted with laughter, apart from Harry, who was trying to make himself as small as possible in his chair.
“Nah. Just needed a few thousand hours more sleep. Where are you off to today? If you don't mind me asking.”
“Thank you,” Draco replied, the smallest of smiles gracing his face. “And if we're being honest, yes, I did fancy you.
Harry struggled to find words as Malfoy kissed his neck. Merlin he loved to have his neck nibbled on. Harry gripped Malfoy's hair, pushing his head into the crook of his neck. Malfoy bit and sucked as Harry dug his fingers into Malfoy's hair. Harry fully expected Malfoy to bitch about it, but he could cope with that.
wanted to grab Harry and go back to their room, but for some unknown reason, his face lit up at Glinda's words and Draco expected him to be jumping up and down in excitement within seconds. Taking Harry's hand, Draco tried to reason with him.
food. The small description of dinner on his itinerary intrigued him. He was very much looking forward to a decent meal. Draco loved Grenville, and his ability to organise a wardrobe better than anyone, but his cooking left a
“Come with me. You just said that Pans was looking after the shop. It'll be like an extended holiday!”
“What the pompous git is trying to say is that we discovered an old nondescript apology note written by Mr Longbottom in the Gryffindor common room.” Ignoring Darius' mutters about the state of said room, Hedwig continued. “The previous addressee's name was removed and the note was delivered to Professor Sprout. Mr Longbottom will now be allowed back into Greenhouse Three to attend to his shrubs and the case is closed.”
from his pocket and spread it out on the counter. Both Harry and Pansy immediately leaned forward to read it.
Wanting to keep his balls where they were supposed to be, and with Hermione's full backing, Ron found himself on the morning of their departure leaving his wailing mother with Hermione, and walking up the path to Malfoy Manor.
As she talked—about going to the zoo, of all things—Glinda and Barry held each other's faces softly. “Arms,” she called, as Barry started wittering on about the football.
Once they'd left the pub, Harry would always go home, say goodnight to Ron, climb into bed and dream of Draco. Harry knew that he wasn't fooling his friends; he knew that they noticed his small grimaces when a man ran his hand down his arm, or the way his smiles didn't reach his eyes. His friends were his friends for a reason; they were just there, keeping him company and trying their best to make him laugh.
“I know how to forge a letter; I just thought you'd want to stay and talk. Ah, here are some replies, I think.”
“Is everything okay here, sirs?” The hotel manager had obviously been summoned by the grumpy looking bloke behind the bar and was running towards them with surprising speed.
Harry grinned to himself as they walked the last few yards hand in hand, neither one acknowledging the fact.
Actually, that little fucker Zacharias Smith was the lucky one. I was about thirty seconds away from showing him exactly how 'evil' a Slytherin could be. After all, I'd had plenty of practice.
My mother, informed by Harry, no doubt, was adamant that I needed to take care of myself and report it, but I placated her by telling her they had stopped. For a time, I thought they had. I hadn't received any for months and no longer needed to look over my shoulder when out and about.
My name is Draco Malfoy and I am mainly known for two things. One, what happened on the sixteenth of June, 2000, and two, my somewhat tumultuous relationship with Harry Potter.
No wonder Arnold fainted. Hedwig herself nearly fell off her perch, Darius' wing the only thing stopping her.
There was no way Harry could face going into work. Firstly, he wanted to avoid Draco. Harry still wasn't sure what had happened, and he definitely didn't know
Harry poked his tongue out at her as well. He did take a moment to wonder when he had regressed to a child, but quickly disregarded it. After all, Pansy had started it.
Harry winced. “Sorry,” he said quickly, reaching for some tissues and handing them over. “I didn't, um, that is...”
Harry moved forward, taking Draco's cock in one hand, and steadying himself with his other. Bringing the hard cock to his lips, Harry licked the tip before sucking the length fully into his mouth. After only a few moments, Draco was already starting to pant, so Harry pulled off and held his hand out.
“I missed you when I called earlier, and we had the weekend free, so we thought we'd pop home for a couple of days.”
Draco smiled and did as he was told. Harry busied himself with making some sandwiches, still humming that blasted tune.
Harry looked around and found that Draco was correct. Apart from the waiter and a lone barman, Harry and Draco were the only people in the restaurant and most of the lights had already been turned off.
“So, that's it, basically,” Tony said and Harry's heart dropped. Why the fuck couldn't he concentrate for two minutes?
Harry's eyes widened and he couldn't help but grab Draco and kiss him hard. After all, it isn't every day your boyfriend
“I have a question, if that's okay,” Glinda said. “Have you thought how you're going to carry on when you leave Holding Hands?”
“Ladies and Gentlemen,” the manager shouted over the cacophony of noise in the dining room. “I apologise profusely for the disruption this morning. I sincerely hope that this will not mar your time spent here at Belle Playa. We will do our utmost to ensure that nothing like this will happen again. The pool is now open; enjoy your day.”
“I'm just confused and a little hurt and I think we've had too much to drink to talk about this tonight. You can sleep down here.”
Malfoy did just that, pushing Harry back under the hot stream of water. Harry loved to cede control during sex. He had realised long ago that it was probably due to him having to be in charge on a day-to-day basis, but with Malfoy teasing his arse with maddeningly slow caresses, Harry didn't care
It was easy after that night. I'd walk in—either with Ron or without—and see you at your table. I'd walk into the pub—either with Ron or without—and at some point in the evening find myself alone and plopping two pints on the table and sitting down with you.
“Excuse me if I'm out of line, but we don't get many, um...” She trailed off and wiggled her fingers back and forth between Draco and Potter. “Is 'partners' okay?”
Ron and Hermione had emerged from their room, obviously disturbed by the noise, and were horrified to learn what had happened. Hermione was insistent that they'd soon find Draco and clear it all up. Neither of them could believe that Zach would do what he did.
“I know.” Draco picked up the paper and read aloud. “Zacharias Smith, noted Estate Agent and Battle of Hogwarts veteran, has been spotted in the company of Mr Potter many times over the past few weeks. Mr Potter hasn't been spotted with his supposed boyfriend in the same time period. Mr Smith has refused to comment. Our source insists that Mr Smith is simply protecting his new love.”
Excitement buzzed in the air as people grabbed parchment and pens and settled into their pairs. The group then fell silent as everybody thought about what they wanted to share.
Once they were settled in the living room, Harry called Kreacher to get some plates and cutlery for Zach.
: 'Why holding hands will keep your relationship fresh' or such crap. Draco couldn't help but groan when he noticed those exact words printed on the pamphlet.
Kissing Draco was better than Harry could have ever had imagined. And kissing him against a wall was so much better than awkward kisses over a pub table. Their noses bumped and their tongues battled and it was fucking fantastic. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him close. Harry slipped one hand into Draco's hair and deepened the kiss; one leg sliding between Draco's. Gasping, Draco slid his arms down until his hands were resting on Harry's arse.
“Alright, alright; I think that's enough,” Harry said, cutting her off. “There might be kids about.”
“Simple. I couldn't give you up. I didn't want to lose you if you found out. I always meant to go away after persuading you to ask me—the other me—out. I loved you.”
a painting, and it was beautiful. Harry inexplicably found himself blinking back tears as he spotted the faces of the people he, and many others, had lost. His mum and dad, Fred, Tonks, Professor Lupin, Dumbledore. They were all there, along with so many others, many of which he couldn't identify. The plaque at the foot of the painting stated that the piece was called 'The Price'. Harry couldn't think of a more fitting name for it.
I didn't, but I really didn't want to show myself up. Instead, I asked what I'd wondered since the beginning of term. “Why did you defend us? Why did you stand up for us against the others?”
Harry flicked his wand and soon the room was bathed in a lovely white light. Draco would love it. Not if Dog could help it. Turning on his best puppy dog eyes, Dog whined loudly.
Running as fast as he could back to his café, Harry at least tried to avoid bumping into people as he ran. Flinging open the door to the café and not even looking at Pansy, Harry started talking quickly as he ran around the back of the counter  and started rifling through the till.
Leaving baby Jesus in his manger for the minute (Dog would enjoy having a chew on him later), Dog picked up a king and threw him in the air, catching it with his mouth. He did the same thing with Mary, Joseph and a lamb, too. He was having fun.
“They eat that shit up and you know it.” Harry sent a tiny stinging hex at his best friend and publisher. “And it's not Draco.”
Hermione knew he was doing well with his shop—selling Muggle bits and pieces to wizards seemed to suit Harry better than anyone could imagine—but she still felt bad that it was all he had.
He had to decide what to do. As comfortable as his house was, Harry needed to get out. To do that, though, Harry knew, he'd have to face reality. The reality that he'd been having a secret relationship with one of his best friends and he hadn't even know about it.
One morning after I'd cast the Jinx, I spotted Potter coming out of the fourth floor bathroom. He spotted me of course, and smiled before making his way towards me. The Jinx hit him just as he got out of arm’s reach, causing him to trip and fall flat on his arse.
School. I never imagined that I would be able to return to Hogwarts. I'd seen McGonagall at Severus' funeral, but she'd shut down my attempts at apologising for what had happened at school and I'd assumed that that was the end of it.
And Draco wore a belt. Not just any belt, but a black leather belt with a gorgeous eagle etched right into the silver buckle. Fuck, Harry liked that belt, and by extension, Draco. Well, if Harry was honest with himself, he liked Draco a little bit more than the belt, but not by much. It was a
“In this session,” Glinda continued, ignoring the mutters, “we'll be carrying on from what we did yesterday. But instead of sharing secrets, I would like you to share your hopes and dreams for the future. Your deepest wishes, if you will.”
Even though she was small in stature, the woman seemed to loom over him as he offered his hand in greeting. She was a mess of contradictions. Draco liked her already.
“Of course not,” Draco said, smiling. “I'd be pretty offended if you didn't fancy me, to be honest.”
“I guess I did,” Harry finally said, thinking back to his time at Hogwarts. “I was certainly obsessed with you.”
“What about you?” Harry asked. “I thought you'd be married to some perfect pure-blood by now, with your heir running about the manor and you off in the Ministry somewhere.”
“The only thing I can say,” Harry began after the crowd had quietened, “is thank you. Thank you to Draco, the Ministry and the artist—whoever it is. It is perfect.”
“All I knew about you was what I'd seen in school, and I'd built you up to be this bad man that ran from man to man. I didn't want to put myself in the situation where you
“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry or make you uncomfortable,” Draco said, reaching over and patting Harry's hand. “We can change the subject if you'd like.”
The group had run out of ideas, so, after a hastily thrown together lunch, had fallen back on the usual plan: getting pissed. Harry couldn't see how it could help; Ron had insisted that it couldn't hurt.
Slowing slightly to a springy step, Harry finally reached the lift and pressed the button marked seven. Harry waited impatiently for the doors to close and the lift to start moving. Had the lifts always been this slow?
From that moment, Harry made a decision. Draco was gone, and—according to Hermione's latest letter—he was moving to Europe for good. It was about time Harry moved on with his life.
Draco enjoyed the film. Of course he did. It had everything he liked in a film: Fight scenes, big bad guy and good guys prevailing. And the good looking actors helped. Yes; good, clean fun. It was when they went for something to eat after the film that everything changed.
“Um,” Trevor croaked, shooting an apologetic look at his friends. “I didn't see them in the cupboard, but I did see them getting physical with each other behind Hagrid's hut at lunchtime. I'm sure it was...” He trailed off, his brain not bothering to help him with an excuse.
Harry found himself perfectly happy with the fact that they were friends. You could never have enough good friends, and Draco was becoming a great friend. They spent almost every night together, talking, eating and drinking.
It wasn't all sunshine and kisses by the lake, with me and Harry. We were still two completely different people, with differing views on everything from Quidditch to the future of the wizarding world. Our fights were legendary, so explosive they would draw crowds. Wands were never drawn, though, and we never parted on harsh words. We didn't want to risk our burgeoning relationship on an unanswered offhand comment.
“Fine. I'm too drunk for this. I'm going to bed. You can come, but don't expect any sex. I'm going to sleep.”
Harry takes an unconventional holiday. He was expecting sun, sand and other things beginning with S. He was not expecting to see more of Draco Malfoy than he ever had before.
Harry reached into the cupboard and grabbed his last pack of chocolate digestives, swapping them for the Rich Tea in Draco's hand. “Only if you'll go out with me.”
Theo and Ginny were off on their travels again, so the goodbyes took longer than usual, but eventually, a slightly tipsy Harry managed to get an equally tipsy Draco through the floo and back home.
“Oh,” Harry said as the answer hit him. He gently pushed Draco back slightly so he could sit up. “Is it the—” Harry gestured towards Draco's forearm.
Harry didn't know what to say to that. He couldn't picture Narcissa Malfoy as the mothering type, but Draco's fond tone as he spoke about her told him different.
Professor McGonagall had a face like thunder as she walked past the Gryffindor table, but a small smile appeared as she stopped by Ginny. “Miss Weasley, twenty points to Gryffindor for standing up for your fellow students.”
Arnold shakily got to his feet. “I made a mistake. Accidentally hid in Miss Parkinson's bag. Couldn't find Mr Malfoy. And then dinner... Miss Parkinson screamed so I popped out to see what was happening. And...”
Potter stormed into the Wizengamot in a blaze of sparks and fire—I wasn't actually there, of course, and I'm sure the story has been exaggerated—to demand the immediate acquittal of myself, my mother and my friends.
Harry slid off his stool to go and fetch Draco a cuppa, pausing on the way past to snatch a quick kiss.
“What?” Harry asked, forgetting momentarily why he'd started this at all. “Um, right, Ginny. She said I kissed like a dog and that I was shy and wasn't paying enough attention to her...”
to concentrate on his anger now. He could think about Malfoy's arse later when he'd said what he need to say and found out what he wanted to know.
to marry Ginny and, as luck would have it, she didn't want to marry me. She'd moved on and who could've blamed her? Anyway, I did join the Aurors and I hated every minute of it. I'd done my fighting; I'd had enough of all that. So I left. And now I'm here; trying to figure out what to do next.”
Draco was shocked, taking his wand with a nod of sincere gratitude. He'd forgotten how good it felt in his hand. “Thanks again.”
Harry thought, more than a little smug— persuaded to add a couple of days to his holiday, and the manager— obviously grateful that they weren't leaving—had arranged for Draco to fly home with Harry.
Harry huffed and puffed until he had the tree back in its original position. “There,” he said, ruffling Dog's ears. “Leave it alone.”
You told me what it was like for you. You told me about the reality of having that noseless bastard in your house. You told me how you and your mother whispered in corners of the Manor that you didn't want to carry on with him—that you didn't know how you could make that happen. You told me how desperately you wanted your father to be on your side.
“We both agreed that if we wanted this—” Draco gestured between the two of them. “—to succeed, we were never to outright lie to each other. If one of us asks the other something, we can say we'd rather not answer, but under no circumstances were we to lie.”
Mrs Norris' growl of disapproval was drowned out by the whooshing of owl feathers as Hedwig and Darius took their places at the centre of the group. Spitting an errant feather out of her mouth, Mrs Norris slunk back into the crowd, not wanting to listen to the owls' witterings. She had no idea why the two owls were so revered. They had only been at Hogwarts for seven years and they had more responsibility than Mrs Norris could dream of. She'd been here for fifteen and hadn't had so much as a proper assignment, never mind an actual case.
Harry's first reaction to Ron and Hermione's reason for being surprised by his and Draco's relationship had been one of utter horror.
A murmur rose around the group. The only creature that Bob answered to was Fawkes. Outwardly, Bob followed the instructions of some of the more senior members of staff, but the group knew that was only to appease Fawkes. And if Fawkes was requesting assistance, it was
perfect—excuse for his reaction to seeing Harry and Malfoy sitting on Harry's sofa, so closely entwined that he couldn't tell whose limbs were whose. And when Harry finally talked to him again, Ron would gladly explain it.
help. He could sense Harry about to speak up, so he quickly put his hand on his arm and shook his head.
Harry was happily wallowing in his happy ball of happiness at being happily friends happily ever after. He didn't see the tight-lipped smile Ron had given as Harry accepted the invitation to the match on behalf of the two of them. Harry completely missed the polite head nod Hermione gave when Harry started listing their favourite restaurants and what he and Draco liked to eat.
