"I see you and Potter have decided to put your childish feud behind you." She says knowingly and Draco blushes involuntarily.
"Okay, I know you don't like me but you need to sort out your resentment cause you're upsetting Harry." Draco says as soon as he shuts the door and turns to Ron, and Ron looks surprised.
"If it's that you have a thing for him then I know." Harry's gaze snaps to Blaise and Blaise rolls his eyes with a chuckle.
An arm falls around Harrys shoulders and he looks to see it's Seamus.
"And?"
Harry walks out of the castle rather than up to his dorm or to the library, walking until he reaches the edge of the forbidden forest. He would usually sit against an outer edge tree and look at the view, but today he decides to keep walking deeper into the forest. He approaches a clearing and his breath catches in his throat when he recognises it. There's a lake right in front of him and he stumbles forward, to the edge of the water, suddenly feeling sick. He falls to his knees and takes a shaky breath in, placing his hand on the floor where he once stood to save Sirius and looking across the lake. He can see the exact spot where Sirius nearly died, and he can see it happening. The memory is playing over and over again in front of him and he can't bring himself to look away. After a while of watching that moment he hears a rustle in the leaves just to the right of where he's looking as a Stag enters the clearing and Harry can't help but breath a laugh as tears stream down his face at how much of a coincidence this is. Harry takes a few deep breathes, trying to calm himself down, before slowly standing up and making his way to the other side of the lake, lying down exactly where Sirius had done, and looking up at the darkening sky through the trees. There's a cold breeze blowing across him and it's making him feel numb as he's just wearing jeans and a t-shirt and he isn't sure if he cares enough to go back to the castle or cast a heating charm, so he just lies there.
"It's okay, I should have told you."
"You don't wanna share me?" Draco chuckles and Harry shakes his head.
"For what?"
"You can sit down, you know." Harry murmurs and Draco blushes before sitting in the chair next to Harry's bed. Harry tilts his head to the side, still feeling very dizzy and nauseous, but so he can see Draco. He looks worried and it makes Harry's heart flutter. Draco is watching him carefully, as if Harry is about to fall apart any minute. Harry whimpers after a few minutes and starts to feel overwhelmingly hot, and Draco frowns just as madam Pomfrey rushes over.
"So that's how you knew how to stop the tree?" Harry nods.
"Okay, mount your brooms and get airborne." Harry says and he takes off and hovers in the air expertly, watching as everyone takes off and hovers in front of him, looking for people that are weaker flyers. A bonus of flying around all summer is that Harry is better at quidditch than he ever has been before.
"Actually it reminds me that not every one looks up to me like I'm some sort of hero so yeah, when we're fighting too." Harry admits quietly and he opens his eyes and looks up at Draco to see his eyes focused on Harry. Draco feels trapped in Harry's gaze and takes a deep breath.
"Come to the party. I mean, I don't really want to go, but I can't get out of it, and you being there will definitely make it more bearable." Harry bites his lip.
"Mister Weasley I am afraid I must insist that you go to your next class." McGonagall says, her voice firm, and Harry prays that Ron listens to her and goes away. He definitely wont be able to go to his classes today, since he is now dizzy and he can't see right, but now he's kind of dreading going to any of them.
"What?"
"What's going on with you and Malfoy?" Rhys asks, half way to the entrance, and Harry frowns and glances sideways at him.
"Hi, Harry." Hermione sounds hesitant and nervous and Harry has to stop himself from rolling his eyes.
His friends, surprise surprise, still aren't looking for him, so he manages to make it back to the library without anyone trying to talk to him or lecture him. When he gets there, however, he isn't actually sure what to do. He can't read again, he's been doing that all morning and it clearly isn't helping anything, so he decides to draw instead. He sketches the way Malfoy looked when he entered the hospital wing, in pain but trying to look strong, like he still doesn't want to show any weakness. Which is understandable. But it still breaks Harry's heart because he hates seeing Malfoy so vulnerable. He was always so confident.
Everything seems meaningless. He assumed he'd be dead by this point, figured he'd die before he was old enough to legally drive or drink or do anything, really. Before he was old enough to live, like his parents did. But he didn't and now he has to think about a future he never in a million years imagined he would have. He doesn't know how to plan for anything further away than a few months, because more than that has never seemed plausible. Now he knows he could have 30, 40, 50 years, he's not even sure he wants them. He's given up entirely, and he doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what to do, so he just runs. He runs and he doesn't stop, even when the wind stings as it hits his eyes and the rain burns his freezing skin and the ground hurts his feet with every step.
"Oh, I haven't told you. McGonagall said they were going to call her Iris." Harry says and he's smiling and it makes Draco's heart swell.
"You've got yourself a good team there, Harry." He did notice Weasley glaring at him the whole time they were practising but he can't deny she's good.
"Oh, you're still up here. Hermione said she thought you'd left. Okay well I'll leave you two to it then." Draco says awkwardly and Ron looks at Harry before biting the inside of his cheek.
"But-"
Thank you so much for the lovely comments on the last chapter xxx
"What's with you two?" He asks, smiling wider because Harry looks happy and in love too and their hands are linked and he can pretty much figure out why they're both so happy on a Friday afternoon, talking into the space between them. Harry rolls his eyes at Blaise, squeezing Draco's hand when he looks down nervously.
"Er, yeah. Being forced to dorm together kind of forced us to." Draco jokes and McGonagall gives him a knowing look.
"Why are you so happy about it?" He calls after her and she turns around whilst continuing to walk.
Instead Harry just alternates between admiring the view and admiring Draco as he writes. They sit there for half an hour before Draco finishes his essay. He knows Harry has been watching him, and the way he's sat so close their shoulders are touching meant he could barely focus, but he wrote a probably average essay and that'll do.
"You're gonna freeze, Harry. Get back into bed." Draco says and Harry shakes his head, shoving the hoodie on.
"Hey." Draco says as he sits next to Harry. Harry's hidden himself in the library, and has been reading through his textbooks and getting all his homework done. He's not been avoiding Draco, he just thinks he should try and get used to not being with him all the time since he's going to have to go 2 weeks without him. Harry looks up from his Herbology essay to smile at Draco.
"That's my goal. I'll see you tomorrow, I gotta go tell a guy I love him." Harry says, kissing her grinning cheek and leaving the hall, feeling Draco's eyes on him. He runs up to his dorm room and grabs his wand, map and invisibility cloak, stashing the wand and map in his pocket and charming the cloak so it's smaller and putting it in his pocket, before he goes out into the quad and sits on a wall facing outward, so Draco will see him as he leaves the hall but also so he can enjoy the view.
"I used to say you were annoying and irritating." He whispers and Harry frowns. He wasn't expecting that. Draco sits up and turns to look Harry in the eyes. "But I've always thought you were the strongest person I've ever met." Harry's frown disappears slightly. "And that was without all the things in that book." He adds, raising a hand and running the pad of his index finger down Harry's forehead and along the bridge of his nose before cupping his cheek. Harry's frown disappears under the touch and he's left staring at Draco as if he personally put the stars in the sky. Draco never thought anyone would look at him like that. Like he's important. He kind of feels powerful when Harry looks at him like that. Feels like he belongs. Feels like he's where he's always meant to be. Harry leans forwards slightly and presses his forehead against Dracos, and Draco moves his hand from Harry's cheek to his neck, holding him close. They're sat like this for a while, just breathing each others air in the silence of the empty dorm room.
"Wow. I never thought I'd hear you agree with me." Harry rolls his eyes.
"I know that blush. That's a Harry Potter blush. Either you gushing about how hot he is and Pansy's taking the piss or something happened." Blaise grins and Pansy nods, grinning. Blaise jumps over the table and, after a yell form McGonagall not to set a bad example, he wraps his arms around both of them.
Harry won't tell Draco.
"Harry!" George calls when he see's him before walking over and grabbing him in a hug.
"You gonna come hang, Mione?" Harry asks as they enter the courtyard and Hermione shakes her head.
"Oh, er, Yeah sure." She says and Draco breathes a sigh of relief. Draco smiles slightly at her, figuring he can try and charm his way to the information.
Over the next few days more and more rumours spread, people trying to convince others they know who it is by saying they saw Harry kissing them in secret, and people betting on who they think it is, obviously that was started by Seamus and Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry?"
"I just don't want anyone seeing me this messed up." He says quietly and Blaise smiles slightly. He know's Harry doesn't mean 'anyone'; He doesn't want Draco to see him like this.
"I don't know what I would do without you." Harry mutters and they both grin.
"You're observant today." Draco knows Pansy can tell something is up. He doesn't know why he hasn't told her yet about him and Harry, but he knows the second he says something she's gonna make a big deal out of it and go all 'I told you so' and probably squeal or something because she's the one he's been talking about Harry to since before  he even knew he was crushing on him.
"Memories." Harry says, grabbing Dracos hand because his own are shaking. He's finally going to be able to know what his parents were like and the kind of mischief his dad and Sirius and Remus got up to. He's going to see a version that isn't jaded with hate like the one he saw from Snape.
"How so?" Harry shrugs, promptly ending the conversation and leaving Draco wondering what that meant.
"The worst." He says but he's smiling too and Harry sees Hermione roll her eyes at them before smiling.
"You need us to do anything in preparation, Captain?" Rhys asks and Harry rolls his eyes.
"You need extensive training." She clarifies and Harry almost rolls his eyes.
"You're kidding, right? I mean besides every single thing he does, he told me."
McGonagall smiles when Harry accepts the food from Draco. She's always known there was some thing between the two boys, some sort of connection neither of them understood. Granted she wasn't certain what it was exactly, but she knew they were meant to be more than just childhood rivals. She doesn't believe in fate, per se, but she knew the two boys would end up together somehow. They've always been the biggest factor in the other improving themselves. Granted for the most part it was because they were determined to be better than the other, but there's something in the back of McGonagalls mind that tells her that was definitely all just a facade. She's just glad they both realised the true meaning behind their connection and have done something about it. Draco needs Harry, just as much as Harry needs him.
So the next few chapters are quite short like I usually like to have at least 1000 words per chapter and the next few are around 800 but they end where it makes sense that they end so you know, you win some you lose some.
"Forget about it, Harry." Seamus whispers in Harrys ear, and Harry bites his lip and looks down at the table.
"Not entirely, however I am not going without you." He smiles, and Harry can't help but smile back, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
"He, erm, he told me he loved me." Draco says, still looking at Harry. He's smiling about something but it's bittersweet.
"No worries I'll get it." Seamus says, standing up, and Ron grabs his arm.
"I just had the best conversation I've ever had ever at all in my whole life ever." He says, not attempting to stop the almost grin on his face.
"Call me Narcissa." She replies before they pull out of the hug. "Who's for tea?" She asks and Draco and Harry glance at each other before nodding. "Brilliant. Draco, dear, why don't you show Harry around and I'll meet you in the kitchen in half an hour?"
"I was thinking about Quidditch. Like, your captain offer." Harry starts, and McGonagall nods, not saying a word.
"But is distancing yourself until he gives up really the way to go?" Blaise asks.
"So yours?"
"Something happened." Blaise says, sitting himself on Pansy's lap and Draco blushes harder.
"So why did you bring me here? What did you need to tell me?" Draco sounds nervous and Harry doesn't know if that's good or bad but he can tell Draco is trying to change the subject so he doesn't cry.
"Thank you." Madam Pomfrey walks over to her office and Harry sighs back against the pillow before sending Blaise a message that he can come back in.
"Yeah?"
"I have decided that you are allowed to go to your classes, on the premise that you return here and attend meal times in the great hall, and as much as you can I would like you to stay near Blaise, or Draco, in case your dizziness gets worse. This way you are not staying in the hospital wing all day, but we will be able to keep an eye on you." McGonagall says and Harry bites his cheek. He will be able to actually get up and leave the wing, but he will also have to go to meals and eat. That will suck. McGonagall must sense his reluctance because her face turns from 'determined teacher' to 'sympathetic mother figure.'
After the class Professor McGonagall asks Harry to stay behind so she can talk to him.
"You know, most people fall asleep after they fuck." Harry jokes and Draco blushes, burying his head further into Harry's neck.
"Who would have thought Harry Potter was actually adorable?" She grins and Draco raises an eyebrow at her because he's been saying that for fucking years.
"I'm so sorry, Jamie. I couldn't stay there." Sirius says, his voice trembling, and James wraps his arm around Sirius's shoulders and leads him into the front room, where a man and woman are sat. Harry guesses they're his grandparents.
"What is it?" Harry looks at the liquid wearily.
"Who's that?" Harry asks.
Also there's a very high chance I'll post twice this week cause on Thursday it's gonna be quite quiet at work :)
"Quidditch." He mutters, taking a reluctant bite of his sandwich. Hermione looks like she want's to say something else, but doesn't want to interrupt when Harry is finally eating something, so she keeps quiet.
"What did he say?"
"You ran into- what? You spoke to him?" Draco whispers and Blaise nods.
"Blaise! How did you not tell me that you got captain!" Draco exclaims as the two of them enter the library after breakfast. Blaise just smiles.
"Hey, Daniel." Harry replies and the boy looks over at Draco before looking back at Harry.
"Only because you're so pretty and they'll wonder how I managed to bag you." Harry grins.
"And what is that supposed to mean?" He asks dramatically and Harry chuckles when Lily rolls her eyes.
"It was definitely interesting, but I got my work done." Harry says before he takes a bite of his sandwich, looking down at Teddy, letting the guys chat around him, occasionally paying attention. Harry notices Teddy's hair changing from pastel green to a nice bright turquoise and wonders if Teddy knows he's doing that, but judging from the fact that his focus is completely on the bear he assumes he doesn't.
"All of it." Draco says nervously and Harry smiles slightly. He wasn't that drunk last night so he remembers everything he said.
"Anti dizziness potion."
"Eh, they did worse than that I'm just not really... Basically they just liked to make sure I was aware of just how unwanted and unloved I was." Draco can't bare the look in Harry's eyes so he surges forwards and pulls him into a hug. He wants to know just how bad it was, but he also knows that this is hard for Harry to talk about and he probably doesn't feel like talking about it all right now.
"Go to my office, Potter. This is not a discussion we should have in front of the whole school. I'll have a house elf bring you some food and a warm beverage." She says and Harry nods, shoving his hands in his back pockets as he walks back out of the hall. He starts to walk up the staircase when Blaise calls out to him. People are starting to leave the hall, and Blaise is stood at the bottom of the stairs with Malfoy and Parkinson either side of him.
"Thanks James."
"Mister Harry Potter should be in the great hall for dinner, sir." She says confused and Harry shakes his head as he gets a glass of water.
"Thank you, Potter." Harry rolls his eyes slightly before sighing.
Guys I've just written chapter 45 and I love it!!! Sorry to tease you cause it's weeks away but I love it and I'm so excited for you to read it!!! Honestly though I really like the next few chapters too so I'm excited for you to read it all :D
"After an hour and a half of flying?"
"I'm fine." Harry says, but it's the first thing he's said in a while and his voice doesn't sound right. Malfoy looks at him for a few seconds before shaking his head slightly.
"Oh, I er- I actually have plans tomorrow." He doesn't really, not officially, he has therapy and then he does plan on spending the rest of the day in Hogsmeade, he just wants to be there with Draco. Wants to take him on their first date. Wants to forget about the past and the future and just be teenagers for a while. Not sure he can do any of that without people figuring out they're together though.
"Jealous, Draco?" Pansy smirks.
"And the map?"
"I guess he'll tell us about that later." Blaise says before they walk to greenhouse 6. He know's Harry told him he died already, but he doesn't know anything more about it.
"Okay, well get some rest and eat some food." She says and when Harry grimaces she looks sternly at him.
"Tomorrow." Harry can tell Draco doesn't know what to say, but when he places his hand on Harrys and squeezes Harry smiles because he doesn't really want to talk about Teddy leaving and Draco is actually helping.
"And he initiated it?" She asks as they sit at the Gryffindor table. Harry nods, taking a bite of toast. Hermione looks at him for a second, then looks over at Malfoy, then back and Harry before shrugging and helping herself to some bacon.
"Sirius had it too. It makes sense, I guess."
"Are you?" He asks instead of answering, and Harry shrugs. He can feel McGonagalls eyes on him and he fears if he doesn't eat something she'll make him go back to the hospital wing.
Tell me what you think my loves :)
"But... But they know I was on the wrong side. I was on his side. I was marked."
Harry walks into the common room to see his friends sat near the fire and immediately makes eye contact with Seamus. Seamus raises an eyebrow questioningly and Harry nods slightly before making his way up to his dorm, knowing Seamus is following him. The second the door closes behind him Harry turns around and Seamus looks at him carefully.
"Wow, a Malfoy rendered speechless." He teases and Draco looks up at him, his eyes shining with what Harry is hoping is love, and his chest swells with joy.
So I'm going to Cornwall tomorrow with my family for a half term getaway so I'm not sure when I'll be posting next but I'll try and update whilst I'm there, if not it'll be Monday <3
"I know, I almost feel bad that we have to play against each other competitively." Harry says as he shuts the cupboard door. The two of them start to leave the pitch and walk up to the castle together and after a minute Blaise glances at Harry.
"I jerk off to you too." He breaths sensually before standing up and starting to walk up the stairs they're sat on. After a few seconds Draco's blood returns to his head and he stands up. Harry said jerk instead of jerked as in he still does and that made all of the blood in Dracos body go straight to his dick.
"I thought you liked your team?"
"Well someones gotta look out for your pathetic arse." Draco mutters and Harry frowns.
"Thank you."
"Yeah baby?" Harry asks, admiring the way Draco is looking at him.
"It's fine, Harry. It was set yesterday. You do not need to write it."
"Potter are you okay?"
"So you just said you love each other and that was it?" Pansy asks and when Draco nods Blaise' eyes widen.
. This view, of the stars and the trees, is what keeps Harry where he is, with limbs numb from the weather and covered in goosebumps and a body aching from the solid ground beneath him, until 7am the next morning. Because 7am is when his friends finally found him.
"He's gonna be fine." Blaise says and he's sure Hermione, Ron and the other Gryffindors are listening to him.
"Next weekend then?" Rhys asks and Harry bites his lip. They're only a few feet from Draco now and he can almost definitely hear them.
"I, er, saw you and your team practising again the other day..." Blaise says quietly whilst he stirs the potion and Harry pauses before continuing to measure out the syrup of hellebore. He stays quiet and lets Blaise continue.
"But I still owe you that ice-cream." Rhys says, smiling slightly, and Harry shakes his head.
"So you're going out with your team tomorrow?" Blaise asks after a while, having not thought of any ideas.
An hour after they woke up Draco decides they need to get up and go to breakfast so they reluctantly pull themselves out of bed and get dressed. Blaise wakes up half way through the pair getting dressed and gets up too, raising an eyebrow at the smile on Draco's face but not saying anything because whatever it is, he's sure Draco will tell him eventually.
Reunited and it feels so goooood!!! We have a Harry/Ron reunion people!!! We've gone from a code red to a code blue!!! Yes I do realise this means we have to change the light bulb ;)
"I'm joking, love, don't worry." He says before realising what he said. He panics for all of two seconds before deciding to just roll with it. He said it and they both know it, no point getting flustered about it. Draco on the other hand is blushing like mad because hearing Harry call him Draco was one thing, but hearing him call him love is completely different. They hear footsteps coming from the hallway at the bottom of the staircase and Harry steps back before grinning, getting an idea. He grabs Draco's hand and takes off up the staircase and down the corridor until he reaches the entrance to one of the secret passageways. He pulls Draco behind the statue of the one-eyed witch and Draco looks at Harry confused.
"I'm not." He denies even though he knows they all know he's lying.
"I'll be right back, Harry." Blaise says and Harry nods, slumping back against the pillows. Madam Pomfrey goes to find some sort of potion and Harry realises he's alone with Draco. Draco is stood awkwardly at the end of the bed and Harry has to stop from smiling at how cute he is.
"Okay firstly, don't kill him." Blaise jokes and Draco rolls his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uh, where are we going?"
"God no, can't think of anything worse. But you can't deny it would be really funny."
He misses dinner and he knows Hermione and Ron are going to complain but Harry doesn't care. He runs until every thought of the people he lost and the people that gave their lives are out of his head and all he can think about is the autumn breeze blowing through his hair and the fact that his legs are feeling numb and his chest is tight and he knows he should stop running soon but he's been running around the castle and to the quidditch pitch and through the forest and along the lake for nearly 3 hours and it's only 9pm and Harry doesn't know what he'd do when he stops running and has to go back to the castle. He thinks as he runs of what he could do to keep the thoughts away, and considers Seamus for a second before realising his legs are literally numb and he's exhausted so that might not be ideal. Harry settles on sketching when he looks up at the sky as he runs and sees the moon that reminds him of Malfoys eyes, feeling the urge to draw him.
"A walk?"
"Let us not live in the past, Mione." He jokes and she shakes her head.
"He's great, you'll love him. He's a metamorphmagus so he's always changing his hair colour. It's usually blue. He's always smiling." Harry says before grabbing his wand and summoning a picture of Teddy. He holds it so Draco can see it and he almost forgets how to breath.
"Nah, I really need to focus on actually passing this year, and we should give the younger years a fair chance." Ron grins and Harry rolls his eyes before noticing how similar Rons grin is to Freds. He sighs and looks back down at his almost finished essay. He just has to write a conclusion and then he has no more homework to do until he inevitably gets some on Monday. He goes back to writing, knowing Ron will probably leave, and sure enough a few minutes later he looks up from his finished essay to see he's alone.
"You alright, Draco?" He asks as if they've been friends for year and Harry smiles at him, glad George isn't making anything awkward.
Draco can't stop looking at Harry. It's been 4 days since Harry fell asleep with his head on Draco's lap. 4 Days since Draco saw the sketch book. It's all he can think about. Especially today. He saw Harry sitting in the corner of the library with the sketchbook open in front of him, and Draco is wondering whether Harry is drawing him again. Harry hasn't said anything since Monday; He's gone back to how he was when they first came back to Hogwarts. He's closed off and silent and does nothing but work and he goes on at least 3 runs a day. Draco can't help but wonder if it's because of him. Harry was getting better, and then he stopped that curse and fell asleep with Draco there and now he's like this again.
"So why did you tell him before Ron?" Draco asks, hoping Harry tells him about what happened between the two.
"Just a bit dizzy."
"I didn't plan this far ahead when I gave it to him."
"Of course I'll look after Teddy. I can bring him down to watch." She says and Harry grins.
"Nonsense Potter, we were just finishing up." She says before turning back to the students, who look shocked at actually hearing Harry speak for the first time since he's been back. "So are we agreed that Miss Ramsey will tutor in Transfiguration, Mr Haywood in Potions, and Miss Gibson in Astronomy?" She asks and the three students nod.
"Yeah but at least I could kiss you in public." Harry says and Draco blushes slightly as they reach the quidditch pitch to see Ron waiting by the entrance.
Quick note though, your comments from the last chapter made me so damn happy and I really bloody love you <3
"He's showing you that your dad and his parents were good people." Draco says to Harry and he nods, watching as Sirius and James sit side by side on James' bed, backs against the wall.
"He's not like he was before the war." Harry says and Ron nods, sitting at the end of his bed.
"Well I'm back in the dorm now, but it's awkward. I haven't really spoken to them." Harry says quietly.
"Told you you wouldn't keep up." Harry teases, trying to take the attention away from how fucked up he is, and Rhys rolls his eyes.
"But if I sit at the Slytherin table everyone will stare at me and I really don't want to sit at the Gryffindor table." Harry says and McGonagall thinks for a moment before seemingly deciding on something. She stands up and walks towards the door by the side of the teachers table.
"Harry, are you okay?" Seamus asks as he leads Harry through corridors. Harry sighs and shakes his head, wrapping his arm around Seamus' waist as they walk.
"Ca- Can you play one?" Harry presses his lips together to stop from smiling at how adorable Draco is being.
"I- saw him- with- I can't-" Harry chokes, not able to say any coherent sentences, and Seamus sighs.
"Harry?" He whispers, sitting next to him and running his hand through his hair. Harry forces his gaze onto Draco, who stops moving his hand through his hair and rests it on Harry's cheek, wiping away the tears with his thumb. He holds the spare hoodie up and pulls it over Harry's head, and he breathes in deeply, smelling nothing but Draco, before Harry leans forward and presses his forehead against Draco's, squeezing his eyes shut.
"So how are we gonna tell everyone?" Draco asks and an evil smirk appears across Harry's face.
Harry doesn't go straight to the common room, instead deciding to wander round the castle. He quickly cuts this short, however, when he turns a corner to see Malfoy and Parkinson standing close together, Parkinson's hand gripping Malfoys arm. Harry feels his heart shatter as he rushes back round the corner before either of them notice he was there. Harry didn't hear what they were saying, (if he did he would have heard Pansy teasing Draco for how pouty he was during dinner when Harry didn't show up, and Draco threatening her and trying to shut her up. Pansy was only holding Malfoys arm so he couldn't escape her teasing) but where Harry was stood it looks like something very different. Harry feels a stab in his chest as he walks back up to the common room. He knows he has feelings for Malfoy, he's had them for years, he just hadn't realised just how bad they were. Seeing Malfoy and Parkinson together was like someone had tied Harry's windpipe in a knot and left him struggling to breathe.
"What else did she tell you?" He asks, sounding defeated.
"Sorry." He says guiltily, and Seamus chuckles.
"I left it in the store cupboard." He says as they reach the pitch and he starts walking over to the cupboard. Draco has stayed quiet since they left the common room, and Harry can't tell what he's thinking and it worries him slightly.
“What’s wrong, are you okay love?” James asks, sitting up straight.
"He saw your tattoos and is still clueless?" She asks and Harry shrugs.
Harry wakes up at dinner time, and instead of going to the hall with his friends, he decides to go for a run. He knows his friends are going to be mad at him for missing dinner, and he knows going for a run, especially one as long as the runs Harry goes on, on an empty stomach when you're also dehydrated isn't the best idea, however he doesn't seem to care. Harry runs around the grounds of Hogwarts 3 times, and during his fourth he's stopped by Hagrid as he runs past his hut.
"The only time I've seen my parents alive was through Snape's memories and I'm not being funny but he was slightly jaded with hate for my dad and Sirius." Harry says and Draco nods.
"What happened?" Hermione asks.
Harry plays for what feels like hours. He feels closer to Sirius with the guitar in his arms and the jacket wrapped around him, and when he plays songs he remembers his parents singing to him he feels closer to them, too. Harry starts crying half way through 'Your song' by Elton John and when he chokes out the last few words he puts the guitar down and accios the blanket on the chair to his right, wrapping it around him, lying on the sofa and closing his eyes.
"What are you doing?" Draco asks, voice muffled and cheeks blushing bright because he's sitting in between Harry's legs, which are pressed against his on either side, and Harry starts rubbing his temples, applying the perfect amount of pressure to ease Draco's headache. Draco melts under Harry's touch. He can feel Harry's magic running out of his fingertips and all through Draco's body.
"No." He mutters and Harry grins.
"How are you gonna do that?" Draco asks and Harry smiles knowingly.
"You sure?" Draco asks just before they enter the hall, and Harry shakes his head.
"No but seriously, Harry. My mother never disliked you. She wasn't exactly happy about the fact that we would fight constantly, but she understood that kids fight sometimes. Besides, she couldn't hate you cause she's know I was in love with you for like 7 years." Draco says, blushing slightly at the last bit, and Harry's eyes widen.
"That's like your ideal job." He says and Harry nods.
"Thank you, Malfoy." Draco nods before walking back into the library.
"Not a fan of being stuck here." He mutters just as madam Pomfrey enters the wing holding a glass of something.
“It’s a girl!” She says excitedly and James grabs her in a hug.
"Thank you." Harry says, and McGonagall smiles.
"Well he didn't tell us." She says defensively.
Hermione is, of course, the first to realise something's up. They're sat at breakfast, Ron playing with Teddy, when she turns to Harry.
He enters the library and walks to the back corner, hidden by bookshelves, before sighing and collapsing onto a chair. He pulls out his charms homework and starts writing. He feels someone sit at his table at some point and glances up from his essay to see Seamus sat opposite him. He doesn't say anything, just pulls out an astronomy textbook and starts reading, so Harry gets back to his essay, realising that this is the first time he's been around people and they haven't tried to make him talk or explain.
He runs back to the castle and by the time he's back in the castle he's breathing heavily and has to slowly walk up to the common room. He showers and changes into some joggers and a soft hoodie before grabbing his sketchbook and a pencil and settling in a comfy armchair by the fire, starting his sketch of Malfoy and how he looked when he was looking at Harry earlier, glad that none of his friends are here to question him about why he missed dinner. Harry isn't sure where his friends are as he didn't see anyone in the dorm room, but he's so relieved that there's no one giving him concerned looks or asking him how he is that he can't bring himself to worry.
"Mind if I join you?" Harry asks, sounding no where near as nervous as he feels. Draco nods, moving his bag so Harry can sit and lean against the tree next to him.
"No fucking way? Who was the one that finally managed to stop you being such a whore?" Seamus asks in shock and Harry grins smugly.
"Why does he know that?" He asks.
"Well McGonagall asked if I knew what I'm doing with my life and I was like no but I ain't being an auror any more and she said I could work here teaching DADA and quidditch." Harry says and Draco smiles proudly.
"I know." Draco runs his thumb across Harry's cheek again and Harry reaches up and places his hand over Draco's. "But you're gonna be okay." Draco says again and Harry gets the feeling he's not just talking about having nightmares. Harry leans forward and presses his forehead against Draco's, closing his eyes as he does so, and Draco's fingers thread into the hair just above his ear, keeping their heads pressed together. Harry moves his hand off of Dracos and moves it to rest on Draco's side and Draco starts running his fingers through Harry's hair, and within minutes Harry's breath has evened out and he's fast asleep.
"Can we help you, Brandon?" Blaise asks, and Brandon raises an eyebrow.
"Remus taught me in third year. It's weird that I'm now using it to calm his child." He says and Draco watches his face as it changes to a sort of sad happiness.
"I missed you too." Draco whispers, like it's a secret, and Harry grins.
"Are you coming to dinner?" Draco asks quietly. They've been sat together for 2 hours and it's 5:30 now. It's quite early still so the hall wont be busy yet and Harry figures he might get away with sitting with Draco. Harry looks at him for a second before nodding.
"Thank you, Minerva." He says with a cheeky grin and she smiles as Harry leaves the office.
They've found a corner by the bar to lie low in, and managed to avoid conversation with anyone apart from each other for the past half an hour. They've had the odd one or two come over to try and talk, a few more walking past or standing near them and making snide comments at them, but they've actually managed to have a good time. That is until Brandon walks over with two other people.
"You're showing me your spot?" He asks in disbelief and Harry can see his eyes beginning to water.
Harry sit's back on the end of his bed when Ron leaves, and shortly after Draco, Blaise, and Pansy come back over and sit down. Pansy takes the chair by the bed, Blaise lies on the bed next to Harry's and Draco nervously sits at the end of Harry's bed. Harry's exhausted, and he yawns as they settle down.
"How can I help him? What can I do? It's not like I can sit with him whilst he sleeps every night." Draco says, genuinely asking for ideas. Ron presses his lips together.
“Not yet.” He says, motioning for Sirius to sit next to him.
"Well I wasn't hungry then either." Harry says, getting annoyed now. Draco just sighs.
"Doubt it." He says and Harry grins, leaning forward and catching Draco in a kiss.
"What's he doing?" He asks and Harry glares at Seamus when he smirks.
"That's for convenience. I only tie it up cause if I left it down when I was running or flying or writing I wouldn't be able to see." Draco rolls his eyes and Harry smiles.
"Malfoy you don't need to thank me for forgi-" He starts but Draco cuts him off.
"Harry, you still want us to keep the tattoo a secret?" She asks. They all know about it since they get changed in front of each other, but they don't know what it means. Harry nods.
"What?" He asks quietly and Draco shakes his head, pink dusting his cheeks.
"Don't worry, you take it." Blaise says and Harry smiles.
"That's a shame, Harry." Draco breathes a laugh as he follows Harry out of the dorm.
"I didn't, Harry." She insists.
This chapter's only short, I know, I'm sorry! But I'm making them longer from now on :)
"I love you too." He says quietly and Harry grins, grabbing Draco round the waist and kissing him fiercely, holding him tight, Draco's arms wrap around Harry's neck and he kisses back just as passionately. It's not long before Harry feels Draco's dick harden and he knows his is too, so he pulls Draco's body flush against his, so every part of them is touching, and moves his mouth from Draco's lips to his neck, starting to suck and nibble and lick, loving the sounds Draco is making.
"It's honestly nothing Harry, forget I said anything." He says and Harry frowns before sitting up and looking him in the eyes.
"Absolutely she does." He says before looking up at Draco, admiring how pretty he looks. Draco looks down at him and notices him staring.
"Why?"
He grabs Dracos hand and turns to the pensive before Draco pulls the lid off and Harry pours the memory into the pensive.
"I'm glad the curse didn't work, Harry." Draco whispers and Harry shivers.
"All he does is run and read. It's so boring! Like we get it you beat you know who and now everyone loves you and thinks you're some sort of god. Everyone thinks you're a saint and you can do no wrong. Wow your life must be so hard!" Ron mimics and everyone laughs.
"Great idea Blaise. Bring him into a room full of people who wanted him dead. What a great Christmas present." Draco mutters and Harry smiles.
"You're the only one that can do Legilimency here." Harry's lips twitch up in a smile and Draco smiles back. "So are you going to stop arguing and agree to stay with us tonight?" Harry huffs but nods and when Draco grins Harry can't help but smile, leaning forward to kiss him.
"Nearly 2." Harry nods before his eyes widen slightly.
"It's an invisibility cloak. Don't want anyone to see where we're going." Harry whispers, his face so close to Draco's. Harry grabs Dracos hand and pulls him closer to the tree, smiling at Draco's hesitation.
"Any time." Harry says genuinely as McGonagall and Blaise walk into the wing. Blaise looking pleased with himself as he sits himself back down on the end of Harry's bed. Harry eyes him nervously as McGonagall walks over.
"...Why?"
"I thought I told you to come straight to me when this happened." She says but Harry can tell she's worried about Malfoy, and now he's wondering how many times this has happened since they've been back at Hogwarts.
"Then they'd be whispering about how the great golden boy, saviour of the wizarding world, is fucking a former death eater." Draco points out.
"Because it's getting worse, Mione. I dreamt about him last night, and I feel weird when I'm near him and I blame you entirely cause you said people find guys more attractive if they're good with children and let me tell you yesterday in the library he was amazing with Teddy." He says and she smiles slightly.
"What does it feel like." He asks. He knows you can only feel someones magic if they are really powerful because it has a bigger and bolder presence in the person.
"I don't think so." He says softly and Harry sighs as his eyes close.
"I haven't seen you talking much about anything." Hagrid says and Harry shrugs.
"What you been doing?" He asks knowingly and Harry rolls his eyes.
"Okay fine I'll go with you." Draco mutters and Blaise smiles slightly.
"It's okay, Harry." She says and Harry looks up at her.
"Potter?" She asks and Harry can feel Draco and Blaise staring at him so he nods, despite the fact that he feels sick thinking about having to eat every meal.
Okay I'm still working and it's so damn busy so I know my upload schedule is non existent and the chapters are short and I'm a mess and I know I say this all the time but I know where this is going I just need to actually write it!
“It’s a boy!” She says and James and Sirius jump up and hug each other.
"That goes for you too." Brandon smirks when Draco immediately falters.
"You know, you're not that bad." He says and Harry chuckles.
"I have an idea." He says quietly and Hermione smiles as Harry explains what his idea is.
"Then?" McGonagall asks.
"I'd feel a lot better if you weren't sat on the edge of the tower." Draco says and Harry laughs through his nose.
Draco can feel his heart racing as he looks into Harrys eyes the whole way up to the bedroom, and when they get there Harry tugs on Dracos hands and pulls him closer before wrapping his arms around Dracos waist again, neither of them caring about the fact that they're both naked.
"He's not gonna want me in his shop." Draco says quietly and Harry shakes his head.
"Malfoy." Harry says before he walks to the hall.
"I assumed Mr Potter told you this." She says and Draco shakes his head.
"I don't want it so you have to have it." Draco says and Harry stares at the toast for a second before his eyes lift to meet Dracos.
"Either way, my mother doesn't regret saving you." Draco says and Harry sighs, resting his head on Draco's shoulder.
"You smell like fire whiskey." Draco mutters and Harry smiles.
"What you doing here?"
"Maybe he's gone for a run?" Dean asks and Ron shakes his head. He, Dean, Seamus, Hermione, Ginny and Luna are walking the halls of Hogwarts, hoping they find Harry soon. He's been missing since 7pm yesterday, when he left the hall at dinner. They're used to him going to bed after they're asleep and disappearing before they wake up, but his bed wasn't slept in and no one in Gryffindor had seen him.
"Okay sarcy, has something happened?" She asks but Draco can see Harry perfectly from where he's sat and he's talking to Hermione with the cutest smile and he's eating and Draco wonders what they're talking about but then Harry bites his lip and meets Draco's eye before turning back to Hermione and he doesn't have to wonder. He is worried why Harry looked so worried then though.
"I notice you're reading Jane Austen." McGonagall says and Harry nods again, watching with curious eyes when she stands up and taps her wand against a bookcase full of wizard books. The bookcase disappears and is replaced by a different one, and McGonagall looks at it for a while before picking up a book and bringing over to Harry.
"Harry, you saved me too." He says and Harry shakes his head.
"Mister Potter, Sir." Winky says as Harry enters.
"I knew Draco loved it!" Seamus says and Harry chuckles.
“You always smell like Draco.” Harry says and Draco smiles slightly,
"Hmm?" Ron is in the middle of writing his seemingly never ending essay for Herbology.
"I get what you're saying..."
A whole bunch of cuteness for you on a Tuesday afternoon :D
"Yeah?" Harry brings his gaze to Blaise and Blaise studies his face.
"It's also not safe." Harry feels his heart flutter at the fact that Draco sounds worried.
"I mean... My cousin was often rebelling against pure blood ideology, however you can't deny he looked good doing so." She jokes, and Harry chuckles, nodding. He can't deny that that is true.
Harry's confused as to how Draco knows this but then he remembers Malfoy talking to Hermione and sighs.
"What do you mean?" He asks softly.
"As are you to him, I am sure." Harry looks down. He highly doubts that.
"Party in room of requirement." He says excitedly, leading Harry towards the castle, Dean throwing his arm round Harrys shoulders from the other side. Harry chuckles at the two and wraps his arms around their waists, Ginny taking his broom for him.
"But what's that got to do with me?"
"I'm sorry." He whispers.
(See the end of the chapter for
"How do you know she was gonna be called Iris?" Ron asks.
"Yes, I sat in the kitchen. Ask Winky." He says and she nods.
"No they won't babe. You'll be under the protection of the chosen one. No one will fuck with you because if I can defeat Voldemort who knows how many times and survive the killing curse twice then I can curse a kid that hates my choice in relationships." Harry says before kissing Draco again.
"Hiding."
"No." Harry knows there's no point pretending.
Harry hurries down to the hall and sits with Ginny, Seamus, Ron, Hermione and Dean.
"Yeah it was. Madam Hooch thought you'd break your arm or something."
"Why would I be jealous? I get to sleep with him." Draco says casually, taking a sip of his drink, and Blaise snorts because he wasn't expecting that.
"If that's who you want to tell, then yeah." He says, giving Draco's hand a squeeze, and Draco nods.
"When I went to see Voldemort in the forest. He hit me with the killing curse, and it worked." He adds and Draco is looking at him in shock.
"No, really, use mine." He doesn't want to admit it but seeing Harry sleeping so peacefully was so reassuring that he doesn't want anyone to interrupt him, and Ron's sure he was so peaceful because Malfoy was there.
"You're the reason we're not in Azkaban with him." Draco interrupts, he stops walking and turns to look at Harry properly. "You're the reason I'm alive." He says, soft and caring, and Harry smiles slightly, looking into Draco's eyes.
"I've got you." He whispers into Harry's ear softly and he feels goosebumps appear on Harry's skin.
"Blaise and Pansy, Hermione and George." Harry says, knowing the fact that George knew before Ron will hurt him.
"I asked Professor McGonagall about her." Harry explains, shifting so he's lying on his back with his head in Draco's lap.
I'm engaging panic mode right now because I've only got one and a half more chapters ready for this fic and I have major writers block! I am freaking out! I don't want to miss a post cause I've been posting once a week for ages but I HAVE NOTHING!!! Send help! :(
"We have to go." He says, defeated and tired, and Draco turns around to look at the clock before sighing.
"Only 2. I want another one but haven't known what to get. Although I've recently had an idea." Harry says, standing up and turning round so Draco can see his scarred back. On the back of his shoulder blades across the top half of his back are two antlers, with vines wrapping around them and lilies placed across the antlers, the vines wind around like snakes and Draco guesses its for his mother because of the flowers. In between the antlers are a bunch of stars. They go from being just stars to having a line connecting some of them, showing 2 constellations. One is a constellation Draco knows well, as he was named after it. The other is the Canis Major constellation.
"You can't befriend him, Blaise! If you befriend him it will mean he notices you more which means he'll notice me more and I can't have that pressure on me!" Draco whisper yells and Blaise rolls his eyes.
"You have to tell George. I can't do it." Harry says, pulling away, and Ron nods.
They let the topic slide, moving on to talk about who knows what, and Ron joins them for a few minutes too. They talk about Christmas and their plans for the holidays, joking and messing around, before Ron says he has to go back to the Gryffindors' carriage. Blaise and Draco start talking about something or another, and Harry rests his head back against the cushioned wall behind him, getting lost in his thoughts again. When Blaise is snoring lightly, head resting against the window, and Pansy has her head in his lap, also fast asleep and breathing evenly, Draco turns and rests his head on Harry's shoulder, burying himself in his side.
After potions Harry heads straight to his dorm so he can change into some joggers and go for a run. It's 4pm, he has no more classes today and he doesn't want to eat, so he runs along the lake and down to the quidditch pitch before running into the forest. He knows it's still not safe and students shouldn't be in there but he can't bring himself to care, so he just keeps running. He finds himself running a familiar route, and almost chokes on his breath when he realises where he is. He's stood in the clearing he was stood in 4 months ago. The clearing where he was hit with the killing curse. The clearing where he died. Harry takes a shaky breath in and continues running. He can't think about that right now because he will break down and he does not want to break down in the middle of a forest. After a minute he feels something dig into his shoe and huffs, figuring it's a stone. He stops and rubs the bottom of his shoe against a tree and his eyes widen when he sees something fall. It's a stone, of sorts, but not a regular stone. He picks it up and frowns. He thought for sure he would never see it again.
"Well- I mean-" He stutters and they both grin.
"I know about the book." He says, wanting to punch himself because of all the ways he could have said that he made himself sound so stupid. Draco's eyes widen slightly.
"Harry," Ron says, as if he want's to ask him to stay or where he's going but deciding against it, and Harry just slings his bag over his shoulder and walks out of the library, not missing the way Malfoy watches him when he walks past.
"Th-thanks."
"Wasn't entirely false." Harry finishes and Ron looks pale.
"He's not alone!" Neville gasps and Ron jumps out of his bed.
"You smell like vanilla and a flower I don't know and some sort of wood, kind of like a broomstick but not quite, and a little bit like the air outside when it rains and you smell comforting and you smell like home." Harry says softly, looking down at Draco, and Draco is basically glowing.
"Harry James Potter you do not voluntarily fall off your broom." Harry hears and he turns around to see McGonagall walking onto the pitch. She's still head of Gryffindor and, even though he shouldn't have voluntarily fallen 6 foot he knows she's glad he won.
”He looks so sad. Like, all the time.” Draco says and Blaise rolls his eyes.
"Hey, Thanks Mione, I owe you one. Hey Teddy!" Harry says as he comes round the corner, obviously not noticing Malfoy sat opposite his bushy haired friend.
"Where would you like to begin?"
"You don't have to look so surprised, Draco. Gryffindors are actually nice people." Harry chuckles and Draco shrugs.
"Shut up, Blaise." Draco mutters, a blush spreading across his cheeks.
"I don't wanna talk about it Draco." Harry says. Draco notices that even when Harry is mad at him, when they're alone he still calls him Draco as opposed to Malfoy like he does during the day.
"Really, Draco?"
"You look great." He says, sounding a little bit nervous but a lot in love, and Harry walks closer to him as Narcissa busies herself with going to find her bag.
"You're so in love, man." He says softly and Draco blushes but doesn't respond.
"I'm sure it'll be fine." He says, trying to convince himself more than he's trying to relax Draco, and Draco laughs quietly.
"George is here? How come?" Draco asks, hoping this is the subtle opportunity he was hoping for.
Hermione finds Harry sitting by the lake alone and rolls her eyes at how bloody oblivious he is.
Harry waits until the last minute to get on the train, and he manages to find an empty compartment to sit in when he's finally said goodbye and thank you to Kingsley. He spends the entire ride to Hogwarts reading. He read a mix of both wizard and muggle books over the summer, and he's even read every textbook he needs for 8th year. Right now he's finishing Persuasion. Out of the corner of his eye he sees people walk past his compartment, looking at him as they pass, he see's his friends walk past, pausing outside his compartment as if contemplating whether they should enter, before continuing their search for a compartment. Harry knows how he looks. His black hair is still a mess, but it's grown and can now be pulled into a bun, granted its small and some of his hair falls out of it. He's lost some weight but gained some muscle because of his /probably excessive/ exercising so he now has an impressive 6 pack and some decent arm and leg muscles, so he knows his body looks good, but he has bags under his eyes that are darker than the onyx ring, passed down by the Black family for generations, that he has on his right middle finger. He is glad his friends didn't come in and try to talk, he doesn't know what to say to them anyway.
"See you tomorrow Malfoy." He says as Draco leaves the room, and the second the door is shut Harry gets started on the new tattoo. A gray wolf on his right pec, stood on a mountain with the full moon behind it.
"We played quidditch. He might have hit his head when we collided. But he said something about legilimency too." Blaise says and Madam Pomfrey sighs.
Thank you so much for being so sweet and understanding and supportive on the last chapter, and I'm so glad you're all sticking with me and this fic <3
"Hey Siri, come in, what happened?" James asks, grabbing Sirius' arm and pulling him into the house, taking his backpack and putting it on the floor by the stairs.
"Hi." He says, awkward because Malfoy is looking at him with slightly worried eyes and his eyes are a beautiful silvery blue and Harry doesn't want to look away.
"Thank you, Ron." Draco says and Ron nods before walking out of the classroom. He still doesn't like Malfoy, but he cares about Harry and considering Malfoy actually had a conversation with him without insulting him, he must do too.
"You gonna try out?" Harry asks quietly and Ron shakes his head, which surprises Harry.
Okay so here's the thing, I have 1 and a half chapters written so I can definitely post next week, and I have many ideas so I'm hoping I can get a few chapters written (if the ideas ever want to leave my brain in a way that makes sense) so I think I got my game back. Fuck writers block.
"Harry I'm not going anywhere until you're okay." Blaise says, crouching down so he's eye level.
"I don't see the point in pretending everything is normal. People died, Hagrid. I died. But I came back. Everyone else didn't. I can't look at anyone without feeling guilty. Every time I look at Ron I think about Fred and I just- I can't- I'm not okay. I don't understand how they are." Harry breaks. He can't keep himself together anymore. Hagrid moves to the seat next to Harry and pats his back.
"Merlin, Potter, how hot was your shower?" He asks in shock, and Harry shrugs, steadying himself before turning back to his clothes. He doesn't blush, it's not something he ever has done, but he knows if he did his face would mirror Malfoys right now. He's almost 100% sure Malfoy saw him naked. Malfoy drops his hand from Harry's arm and takes a step back, a bright red blush across his cheeks.
"Harry! You coming to Hogsmeade?" Will asks and Harry shakes his head.
"Not hungry." Harry whispers, glancing round the hall. He catches Ron's eye, who smiles slightly at him making Harry force a smile back, and when Harry looks over at the teachers table he catches McGonagalls eyes. Harry quickly looks away, afraid he'll see disappointment if he doesn't, and he quickly closes his eyes again. He squeezes Draco's hand, almost subconsciously, 3 times quickly, then 3 times for longer, then 3 quick squeezes again, and Draco looks down at him with a small frown.
"You're right Harry, it's getting worse. You're falling in love. But why is that such a bad thing?" She asks and Harry raises his eyebrow at her.
Okay so it's been like 3 decades since I last posted a chapter but I have some semi decent excuses!
"He has a love bite. Pansy why does he have a love bite?" Draco mutters bitterly, staying quiet so no one can hear him.
"So this is okay?"
"Well they're partnered in potions." Hermione says and Ginny shakes her head.
"Why would I watch?"
So it's 10:15am and I'm at work. Got in half an hour late cause I had a blood test this morning (big up the NHS). I currently feel so sick like genuinely could throw up any second and I've got an awful headache and I really want to go home but I feel bad going home cause we're so busy but I can't focus on anything so I decided to post a new update cause that makes sense. But yeah I really hope my manager clocks on soon and sends me home cause I am not doing good.
"No." Harry says immediately, a small smile on his face. "No, my mum was so accepting there's no way in hell she would have minded, that I'm bi or that I'm with you. My dad was the same, so he wouldn't have cared either. Sirius maybe." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow.
"As much as I despise the fact that you refuse to do anything that isn't self destructive, I appreciate what you did." Harry smiles slightly and turns his head so he's looking up at Draco, before frowning.
Draco easily gives in and allows Harry to control the kiss and when Harry moves his tongue against Dracos he can't help but let out a quiet moan that makes Harry grin into the kiss. After a few more minutes Harry pulls back slightly, just enough to look at Draco properly, and tries to catch his breath.
Draco sees Harry lying in Grangers lap and he feels jealousy bubble up inside of him. He can't hear what they're saying but at some point the conversation turned serious, if the small frown etched onto Harrys face is anything to go by. He sees Harry walk into the castle and decides they can talk later.
“You smell of broom stick wax and treacle tart and cinnamon and the forest. You smell comforting and warm. You smell like hope and light.” Draco says into Harry’s neck and Harry throws his arm over Draco’s waist.
"Where have you been then?" Ron asks quietly.
New update my lovelies! Can I just say I really love and appreciate your comments and your enthusiasm for each chapter <3 it makes me feel all warm and mushy inside :)
"I know. I'm sorry."
"Harry you're family to me and my family. You know that. And I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you." Ron says, walking closer. Harry presses his lips together.
"Narcissa, it's lovely to see you." Blaise smiles at her as Pansy greets her with a hug.
"Harry that's a mental image I did not need." He says, and Harry doesn't know if that's good or not. He didn't say he doesn't think Harry and Draco dating is bad, he just said he doesn't want to think about them snogging. Which is good, right?
"What's wrong?" Harry knows this is the best chance he's going to get to tell Draco about the book. He also has no bloody idea how to tell him. Harry sits, legs crossed, looking at Draco, his eyes skimming over every inch of his face, trying to come up with a way to tell him; to thank him.
"No offense but I kind of figured you were gay, and as for the Malfoy thing, ever since you started that silent revision or whatever the fuck you do in the library you've been a lot happier, also not to sound too much like Hermione but you've actually be doing work too. Sure I still think he's a prat, but that's probably because I haven't spoken to him since before the war. Besides, if you love him you love him, I can't change that, and it's not my place to say who you can and can't love." Ron says and a smile slowly spreads across Harrys face.
"But you love playing quidditch. And you can't tell me you haven't missed playing against Potter." He says with a knowing smirk and Draco shoves his arm.
"Oh, it didn't look like I was that high." Harry says and the boys chuckle as they reach the room of requirement.
So I know I usually post once a week and I posted a few days ago but It's my 20th birthday on Sunday (2nd June) so I thought I'd give you all a present and post a new chapter :D
"Yeah. I actually have something I need to tell you." Harry says and Draco looks at him because he didn't think he'd tell him now. He thought he'd at least tell him to sit down. Ron's eyes shine, like he's trying to hide a smile, and Draco gets the feeling Ron knows exactly what's coming.
"What's wrong?"
"Fucking Granger." He mutters and Harry chuckles.
I'll try and keep updating regularly but honestly my mental health is so messed up rn (despite your lovely comments that make me feel appreciated, seriously I love them and you) so I don't know what's going on.
"I do, just not when you're leading me into a death trap." Draco whispers back and Harry rolls his eyes. He gets his wand out and casts a spell at the knot in the roots, freezing the branches. He pulls Draco towards the almost invisible hole in the roots and whispers "trust me" as he pulls them both through the hole just as the tree springs back to life.
"Missed you." Harry admits quietly, and he can feel Draco's breath on his neck as he squeezes him tight.
"You coming?"
”Trust me.” He whispers and he slowly pulls Harry off the desk and presses him against the closest wall. Harry turns them around so he’s pressing Seamus against the wall and moves so Seamus’ leg is in between his, Seamus' thigh pressed to Harrys crotch and their bodies pressed against each other. Seamus is gripping Harry's hips tight, and Harry grabs onto Seamus' arms. Harry gasps when Seamus starts moving his thigh against Harry, and his head lowers to Seamus' neck, where he starts sucking and kissing because he feels slightly bad that he's not giving Seamus anything in return. Seamus responds to the neck kisses by biting Harry's neck and moving his thigh harder and faster, and it's not long before Harry is gasping against his skin. Seamus can't help but pull Harry's head back and kiss him as he comes undone. He's never even considered doing anything like this with Harry, not since they fooled around in fifth and sixth year, and he figured Harry hadn't either, but he can't deny that Harry is attractive and, sure this is just a friend helping another friend out, but it doesn't mean he isn't enjoying it.
"Why do you sit with Harry? Like I know you're not a bad guy and all that but you don't make conversation, you just sit quietly. What made you go and sit with him the first time?" She asks and he blushes slightly.
"Okay gentlemen. Take a seat." McGonagall says as she sits at her desk, and Blaise and Draco sit nervously opposite her.
"Who were they?" Draco asks.
"We're partners in potions." Harry says, picking up a book and sitting on his bed.
"Is what I'm wearing okay?" Kreacher looks at his suit, considering, before nodding.
"So we're gonna run a bunch of drills, but first get into groups of which position you want to be. Chasers there, Keepers there, and Beaters there." Harry says, pointing to each place the groups should stand, and the Gryffindors divide into their desired rolls.
"I get why us talking is weird, but what did they say? Why don't they want you around?"
"I think it might." He says and Harry doesn't like where this is going.
They walk in an awkward silence until they leave the castle, when Draco turns to Ron nervously.
"Potter." She says and Harry tries to give her his best puppy dog face.
"Harry you really shouldn't have missed breakfast." Hermione says once Harry has sat behind her, right in front of Malfoy. "You really need to eat."
"Where is he?" Ron nods towards the Whomping Willow and when Draco frowns he clarifies.
"Probably sit in the kitchen again."
"About?" Harry presses his lips together again, considering what he should and shouldn't say, but he's tired, mentally and physically, and he can't be bothered to lie anymore.
"So," Michael says, sitting in an armchair, "This first visit is just a general overview and get to know each other session."
"Yeah, but we just had a chat." Harry mutters and Seamus raises an eyebrow.
"You're impossible. Girls will automatically love a guy 50 times more if they know they're good with kids and if they love children. The second you sat Teddy on your lap your attractiveness went off the charts. You're the boy who lived twice and you love your godson, and you're not half bad to look at. Everyone knows you're the whole package and now they find you irresistible. More so than before." She explains as a group of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff 6th years walk past. Harry sighs, deciding he can't cope with this much attention, and Teddy shouldn't have to either.
"I was at the shrieking shack." He mumbles and McGonagall almost laughs because she remembers having this exact conversation with James.
Secondly, I know it's been a while since I posted a new chapter and I know this is kind of really short but, surprise surprise, I have writers block again. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING!!! I know where I want this fic to go and I know what I want to happen but actually figuring out how to go from A to B is SO DAMN HARD!!! I have the next chapter /mostly/ done but after that I'm like... who fucking knows what's going on after that... :( Also I've been sick again (what else is new) which didn't help
"Was it Weasley?"
"My aunt was your godfathers cousin?" He asks and Harry nods. Draco knew very little about his family too, apparently.
"Good luck with your essay, Draco. I need to get going but if you need help with anything or to talk and stuff, just let me know." She smiles before walking off and Draco smiles slightly. When did Granger get so nice. Has she always been like that?
"What happened, Harry?" Seamus asks and Harry rests his head on Seamus' shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You think?" Draco sounds happier, hopeful.
"Hey." He says, and his lips are slightly chapped and his hands are shaking and Draco frowns.
“Why’s he crying.” She asks Draco.
Harry isn't really coping well. He's spent most of the holiday so far at home on his own and he's not heard from his friends yet. Draco writes to him all the time, and they talk through the fireplace a lot, but he hasn't seen him since the day after holiday started. He's seeing him today though. And he's not sure he's entirely looking forward to it. Harry is going to Malfoy Manor so he can meet Draco and Narcissa, and they're going to head to the party together. Harry takes a deep breath, glancing at the clock. He has 3 minutes until he has to apparate over to the Malfoys, and he's starting to regret this. His stomach feels tight, and he's so worried he's going to fuck up somehow. He's standing in front of his mirror, staring at himself. He's wearing a black three piece suit, black tie, and white shirt. He looks good, and the suit fits him well, but he also isn't sure if he was meant to wear robes or not. The only robes he has are the ones he wore to the yule ball, which don't fit him anymore, and he didn't have the time or the energy to go shopping in Diagon Ally, so this was his only option.
"You're ruthless, Pans."
"He went home. Grimmauld Place?" Narcissa nods.
"Harry have you been lying in this cold for 11 hours?" She somehow understands what he meant, and Harry nods, gesturing up to the sky. Luna lies beside him, expanding the warming charm so she can stay warm too, and looks up.
A few more Gryffindors have arrived over the past 20 minutes, not all of them realising there was a Slytherin curled up on the sofa, but those that do took one look at Harry before realising that if they say or do anything they'll have to answer to the chosen one. Something that no one want's to do.
"I'm happy for you, mate." Ron says.
"Guys I don't think we're the people he want's to see right now. Not after what happened earlier." She says and Seamus shakes his head.
Harry goes for a run for the rest of period 3 and although it was only a 40 minute run he sprinted most of the time so he's panting and aching when he finally stops. He walks into the hall nervously, and walks straight to McGonagall.
Draco spends all of saturday looking out for Harry and trying to get him alone, and the first opportunity he gets is when he sees Harry walking into a classroom no one ever uses after lunch, looking a mixture of sad and annoyed. Draco gives him a few minutes before walking into the room. Harry is sat on a desk with his foot resting on the chair in front of him. He's staring out the window opposite him and honestly Draco has to remind himself how to breath because Harry looks so damn beautiful with the way the sun is shining on him making him look like some sort of god.
Harry reads the letter and frowns sadly at it, he only has one more day with Teddy, but he's seeing him on his birthday which is great. Harry wonders why Draco hasn't been writing home though.
Draco is walking to lunch when he sees Harry for the first time since potions. He's leaving the hall that leads to the common room as Harry enters the castle, and when Harry sees him he walks over.
"Who killed him?" Draco asks. He knew about the mass murderer who escaped azkaban, and he knew he died, but he was kept very much in the dark about what was going on. All he knew is that Voldemort needed some sort of prophecy to beat Harry and he needed Dumbledore dead.
"Yeah, we should. Maybe not yet cause I haven't told Ron yet and I'm not sure how he's gonna react but I'm planning on telling him today at some point so maybe some time this week?" Harry offers and Blaise grins.
"But how?" Hermione asks and Ginny shrugs.
"I can't believe you intentionally fell off your broom from like 10 foot up." Dean says and Harry rolls his eyes.
Harry praises his team, gives them tips or pointers, claps each of them on the shoulder or back as they leave the pitch, except Ginny, who is still being arsey with him, and thanks Rhys when he offers to help put the trunk of balls away. They grab a handle each, and once the chest is safely inside the storage cupboard Rhys and Harry make their way over to the pitch entrance. Harry can see Draco leaning against the entrance and presses his lips together to hide his smile. He didn't really think Draco would stay for the whole practice but he's glad he did.
"And you're a prick." He mutters but there's no venom behind his words, just love.
"Yeah. Mate you sure you're okay?"
Harry wakes up to something warm and hard under his head and something warm and soft in his hair and frowns slightly before remembering that he's lying on Draco's lap. He shifts slightly, turning his face further into Draco's thigh and takes a deep breath.
"Harry-"
Harry spends an hour sketching Malfoy, making sure he gets every little detail correct, down to the pain and fear in his eyes, before looking at the picture and deeming it complete. He closes his sketch book and takes a breath in before rubbing his eyes. It's 3pm and he's missed lunch. By now Hermione would usually have come and found him to lecture him about how he shouldn't miss meals, or Ron would have come to ask him if he's okay. Of course, they haven't. They've given up, it seems. All of his friends have. Harry doesn't know what he feels at this realisation; sadness, relief, anger. All he knows is that he feels like he's about to start crying. He grabs his bag and takes it to his dorm before leaving the castle, going into the woods. He walks deep into the forest before collapsing against a tree trunk and sinking to the floor. He pulls his knees to his chest and lets all the emotion in him show, bursting into tears that he can't even try and stop.
"Stared at the ceiling, stared out the window, played guitar, wallowed in self misery, all that fun stuff." Harry says with a sad smile, and Draco wants to wrap him in a hug and never let go.
"Something you need to tell me?" Blaise asks, nodding at Harry, and Draco rolls his eyes.
"So, I know Harry loves Draco." Blaise says and Ron nods.
"You alright?" Blaise asks, and Harry shakes his head, resting his head on Dracos shoulder. It takes around 5 minutes for people to stop watching him, and Harry closes his eyes and listens to Blaise, Draco and Pansy chat as they eat lunch.
"Good thing I came in here then, huh." Ron laughs and Harry rolls his eyes at his best friend and boyfriend, both of whom are laughing at his frantic state.
“You hear that, little one? You’re gonna have a sister!” Sirius says to the baby before they all grab each other in a hug, baby Harry in the middle of it, all of them looking so happy.
"Potter are you sure dreamless sleep would not be beneficial to you?" She asks and Harry shakes his head.
"Weasley." Draco greets before turning his attention back to Harry. He's been asleep for 3 hours and Draco knows he should wake him up for lunch but he's finally sleeping and he doesn't want to interrupt that.
Draco opens the door to their dorm and sees Harry lying in his own bed and he feels his heart break a little bit. What did he do to fuck this up? Harry's crying silently as to not let Malfoy know but he has some sort of radar when it comes to Harry so he immediately kicks off his shoes and walks over to Harry's bed. He lies behind Harry and Harry immediately wants to hold Draco close and never let go, but he's so confused and he needs Draco not to be here right now. "Fuck off Malfoy." Harry mutters and Malfoy responds by wrapping his arms tight around Harry and leaning close to his ear.
Harry and Draco stayed in the tower, just existing in each others presence, for hours. Draco eventually had to go to dinner, Harry flat out refusing to go with him, and when Draco had finished eating he saw Harry jogging around the castle and knew there was no way he would be able to talk to him for the rest of the day.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! or if you don't celebrate Christmas HAPPY HOLIDAY OF YOUR CHOOSING!!!
"Did McGonagall and I interrupt something earlier?"
"Alright fine." He says, returning his hand to Harry's hair. Harry's eyes immediately flutter shut again and he looks so peaceful that Draco turns that 5 minutes into 30.
"Thank you, by the way." Ron says and Draco stops walking too.
"You missed every meal today, Harry. You told her you wouldn't do that."
"It always hurts."
is written is identical to the writing in his book. Surely it wasn't Draco that gave it to him? But he does read these sorts of books. And this writing is identical. Harry glances at the book that is on top of his potions textbook and presses his lips together. He wasn't even talking to Blaise when he was given the book, so why would Draco give it to him?
"I'm being 100% serious, Harry." Harry just rolls his eyes before sighing and closing them.
Harry's not sure how long he's asleep for, but it's raining heavy when he wakes up and he walks over to the window to see a dark thundery sky. It's not late, because the sky is only dark because of the weather, not because it's night. He guesses it's somewhere around 3pm, maybe 4, but he doesn't care enough to check. He goes back over to the sofa and curls up under the blanket again.
"Harry, I made you seeker in first year for a reason. You are a great seeker, the youngest in a century, and the best I've ever seen. I made you captain because, not only does the team listen to you, but you are a great teacher and you help people work together. I believe you are and always will be a brilliant player and captain." McGonagall says, and Harry nods.
Harry and Draco follow Hermione into flourish and blotts and look around the shop whilst she buys her ink and quills, and when she's done they start their walk back to the castle, shopping bags in one hand and a hot chocolate that Harry insisted they all needed in the other.
"Course you do. I miss you to Harry." George goes to walk away but Harry stops him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where are you going?" He asks and Harry stands up and pulls on the joggers he was wearing earlier.
"Mister Zabini, Mister Malfoy, if you will come with me." She says and Harry watches as Draco and Blaise leave the hospital wing, both of them looking shocked at the information Harry just told McGonagall.
"Well just before herbology Seamus asked why I won't talk to them and I had a bit of a breakdown and shouted at him and I guess he told Ron." Harry explains briefly what happened and McGonagall nods.
"Don't be sorry, son. We'll always be here for you. We are so proud of you. Keep the stone, Harry. Use it if you need us." He says and Harry nods. He knows he can't keep them here for too long so he says goodbye. Just before he lets them go, however, Fred pulls him into another hug.
"Of course. Are you okay, Potter?" She asks concerned and Harry shrugs, shoving his hands in his back pockets. He knows the students wont be able to hear him even if they strained their ears so he just says it straight.
"And how do you feel about it?"
"Malfoy it's a dragon with silver eyes." Harry says and Draco blushes brightly.
"Not really. I told him I don't hate him. He said he didn't hate me." Draco mumbles before sighing. "I just don't know what I'm going to do, Blaise. He's so damn cute it makes me want to kill him."
"What?"
"Love you too." Draco pulls back, runs his hand through Harry's hair to push it out of his face. "You heard from Weasley? Or the other Gryffindors?" Harry shakes his head, squeezes Draco's hips gently.
"No Ron. Draco and I are kind of together now." Harry says and Ron freezes.
”Really?” He ties his hair in a ponytail all the time, and he does a bun often too, or just uses a headband to push his hair out of his face, but he’s never done any intricate hairstyles because he mainly does them for convenience.
"Well when does he see my writing, Blaise?" Draco snaps and Blaise chuckles.
"Are you okay?" Draco steps closer, turns to look at him, and Harry nods, pressing a quick kiss to Draco's cheek.
"Instructed by who? And why 21st?" He asks. It could have been Dumbledore, but what would he have to give him?
"I can't- I need to-" Harry grabs his bag and walks out of the classroom and down a corridor, sitting on a windowsill in a slightly hidden alcove, and within seconds Blaise is in front of him. His hands are shaking and his head is spinning and he is getting really fucking tired of his stupid brain being so fucking loud.
"Yeah mate?"
"Dunno. Never really feel hungry anymore. Eating usually just makes me feel sick." He says and as soon as he finishes talking the door opens.
"Cause somethings bothering you." Harry says.
"Honestly what am I going to do with the pair of you?" Madam Pomfrey asks, exasperated, as she walks over to Harry.
Harry continues to thrust into Draco, making sure he isn't hurting him, and Draco continues to moan loudly, which is making Harry giddy because they're the best noises ever.
"Yeah she told me and Draco." Blaise says as they walk into the classroom. Harry see's Ron and Hermione immediately and has to force himself to look away. He walks over to the back table and sits in his usual seat, Blaise sitting next to him.
"I've had a lot going on." He mutters and her gaze softens.
"You've only asked me one question." Harry mutters and Draco rolls his eyes at how fucking technical Harry is being.
"I, er, I don't talk much. Or at all, really. It's hard to talk to them. About anything, really."
"I don't know. I'm not even sure if you can." He says, his voice quiet and broken.
"Thank you." Harry whispers.
"You should have a cup of tea or some soup or something." Draco says softly as he stops warming up Harry's hands, and Harry bites his lip and shakes his head slightly.
"If what was true?" Draco asks even though he knows.
"Well I can tell you to fuck off if it makes you feel better." Harry jokes and Draco rolls his eyes and shoves Harry's shoulder. Harry grabs the hand that shoved him and holds it in his lap.
"You okay?" Harry nods.
"How about we just tell a few people? See how it goes?" Harry offers and Draco smiles slightly and it makes Harry's heart jump.
"What did you say?" He asks curiously.
The room is empty when they enter it and Draco leads Harry over to his bed, carefully sitting him down.
"Do I get the feeling your fears are somewhat to do with Mr. Malfoy?" Harry nods, looking up at McGonagall again.
"'s not a competition." Draco jokes and Harry rolls his eyes.
"You not coming classes today then?" Harry shakes his head slightly.
"I mean I'm the guy that bagged Harry Potter. People are gonna hate me. Then again they hate me anyway." He says and Harry frowns.
"I get you knew I'd react, well, how I did. I'm sorry."
"You okay?" Draco asks and Harry shakes his head before lying down, his head resting on Draco's lap. Draco's hand immediately finds it's way to Harry's hair and he starts running his fingers through it, trying to help with whatever is wrong. Harry sighs again, melting against Draco's touch. He'd definitely rather keep his emotions to himself and keep what he has here than say something that will mess up his preexisting 'friendship' with Draco. He knows he can't live without him, literally, so anything he can do to make sure he doesn't have to try to, he'll do.
"Yeah well what can you do." Harry smiles and squeezes Draco's hip.
"Twice." Harry adds, a cheeky smile on his lips, and he squeezes Draco's hand. "It's gonna be fine." Harry is trying to convince himself more than he's trying to convince Draco, but know he knows Draco is actually worried about it he feels protective of him, like he'll do anything to stop people saying or doing anything that will upset him. Draco smiles, squeezes his hand, and takes a deep breath.
"Is it working?"
"Hey, Harry." Will says and Harry nods.
"Thank you, Kingsley." Harry says and Kingsley smiles at him, patting his shoulder.
"Well I would quite like to eat." Draco says, hoping Harry will agree to go to lunch. Harry pouts and Draco shakes his head with a small smile, standing up.
"You wanna talk about it?" Harry shakes his head before pulling away and looking Draco in the eyes. He can't say it out loud, but he thinks he'll be able to let Draco read it. Harry reaches under his pillow and pulls out his notebook before handing it to Draco.
OMG ALSO I JUST REALISED THE NEXT CHAPTER IS SO CUTE YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT!!!!!
"Potter, how are you doing?" She asks and Harry shrugs, hoisting his backpack strap further onto his shoulder.
"Hey Harry." Hermione says as she sits next to him and Ron sits opposite.
"It's not as bad today." He mumbles as Professor McGonagall walks into the hospital wing.
"I was just about to leave but I thought I'd come say bye. You speak to Ron?" He asks and Harry goes back and sits just in front of Draco so he can lean against him, sort of how he used to sit with George.
"Wanna tell me what happened?"
"When are you gonna talk to him?" Blaise asks and Draco shrugs.
"We've had this discussion before."
"Need to see Madam Pomfrey." Harry says, leaving the library and rushing to the hospital wing.
"Anyway, I didn't do that. So I'm just gonna say it straight cause I'm not about the grand public gestures or cliche moments." Harry pauses and his eyes travel over to the Slytherin table and land on Draco, who is looking at him nervously. He nods ever so slightly and Harry suppresses a smile. The hall is dead silent, but Seamus and Dean are still standing with him and when Seamus knocks the back of his right hand against the back of Harrys left Harry snaps back to reality. Harrys eyes find Dracos again and he sees Draco take a deep breath.
"Specifically?"
"He's helping him."
"Legilimency." He breathes, his gaze fixed on where Ron used to be and his wand still raised. Draco carefully reaches out and places his hand on Harry's, lowering his arm.
At the end of the day, after picking Teddy up from Mrs Pomfrey after class and having dinner Harry heads to their new room. McGonagall said it would only show for Harry and people he specifies so he allows it to show for Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Malfoy, just in case he ever wants to come here which Harry doubts. The room looks similar to how it did when Harry hid here a few days ago, except it's bigger, has a double bed against the right wall and a crib next to the bed. The room is also now in Gryffindor colours and is full of not only Harry's trunk and stuff, but also clothes and toys and things for Teddy, and has a safety barrier around the fireplace. Harry puts Teddy down, letting him run over to a toy chest, and sits at the desk, finishing an essay he started for Transfiguration. At around 10pm he's lying on his bed, Teddy lying next to him with his hand gripping Harry's little finger, and a potions textbook open on Harry's chest as he struggle to keep his eyes open. Eventually he throws the book onto the desk and takes off his glasses, allowing sleep to consume him and he dreams about grey, almost silver, eyes and pale skin and a smile that could light a thousand darknesses.
"How you doing?" He asks and Harry pouts.
Harry sighs as he sits down for dinner. He doesn't understand why Draco comforted him instead of taking the piss. He doesn't understand why it was as if Draco could read his mind, saying he wasn't going anywhere the moment Harry thought Draco would leave if he let go. And he really doesn't understand why he can sense Draco's eyes on him. He does, however, know exactly why all he wants to do is go back up to his dorm and lie in Draco's arms forever. He's been in love with the prat since he was 14, and the fact that Harry is 99% sure he's the only person alive to see a soft side of Draco makes him think that maybe Draco feels the same way, but there's no way he's going to get his hopes up.
"Yeah. I'm totally gonna marry you one day." Harry says and Draco smirks his trademark Draco cocky smirk.
written on the top.
"And you lived with your aunt and uncle, yes?" Harry nods before going into a spiel about how his family treated him. How he winces if he spills anything, flinches if someone reaches out for him, even if they mean it in a comforting way, how he subconsciously prepares to pick up his plate to wash up after every meal, and how he naturally walks quietly because if his family heard him walking around they'd lock him in his cupboard. The fact that he still calls it his cupboard shows how badly it messed him up. Michael listens, like he did last week, only talking to ask a question or ask Harry to elaborate further. The session lasts an hour, and Harry feels both better for finally telling someone this but also worse as telling someone the trials and tribulations of your childhood is emotionally exhausting. Harry bids Michael goodbye before making his way up to the astronomy tower. It's 3 o'clock and there's no classes tonight so he can stay there as long as he wants and wont be interrupted. He reaches the tower and walks over to the edge, sitting on the wall and throwing his legs over the edge so his feet are hanging over the edge of the tower. Grey clouds cover the mountains and Harry watches as rain bounces off of the lake. It's peaceful, he thinks, sitting on the wall with the world below him.
"So where did you disappear to?"
"So you just... sit? And study?" She asks and Harry nods.
"You haven't done this before, have you?" Harry asks and Draco blushes again and shakes his head.
"Oh Draco I'm so happy for you." She whispers and he struggles to get out of her grip. When she finally releases him he rolls his eyes.
"Okay Potter." She looks at him for a moment longer before walking away. Harry makes his way to the hospital wing and sits down on the edge of his bed. He's not tired and he doesn't feel dizzy, he's just fed up. He misses Sirius. He wants to listen to Remus and Sirius tell him about his parents and the things they got up to, he wants to see his parents, he wants to hug them. He needs a hug. He reaches over the side of his bed, into his bag, and grabs the resurrection stone from the inside pocket. He lies back in bed, the stone grasped firmly in his fist, and closes his eyes.
"Oh my god Hermione!" Ron says in shock as he walks into the common room. Harry freaks out for all of 2 seconds before Ron continues. "Harry is actually reading! As in there is a book and it is open and Harry is looking at it." Ron says, clutching his chest and falling onto an armchair near the sofa. Hermione rolls her eyes and chuckles.
"During summer, just after sixth year. But Harry it doesn't mat-"
"Practice." He says and Draco raises and eyebrow, intrigued.
"You also saved so many people, Harry." And it's the first time Harry has ever heard Draco call him Harry and his heart skips a beat. Harry wants to believe him but he doesn't. He just stays quiet and continues walking with Draco next to him, their little fingers still linked.
"You're a disgusting man, Seamus." He jokes and Seamus chuckles.
"Please Blaise. I promise I'll go to Pomfrey if I need to." Blaise looks conflicted and Harry feels bad.
"Come in." She calls and Harry opens the door to see three sixth year Ravenclaw's sat opposite her desk.
"He really does love him. Like, I know they've got that huge past but-"
Harry walks into the great hall the next morning with Seamus and Dean on either side of him, Seamus on his left with his arm wrapped around his shoulders and Dean holding his right hand. He sits in between them, his eyes immediately finding Malfoy, who is sat next to Parkinson. Seamus follows his gaze before looking at Harry. Harry didn't say who he was talking about last night but he knows know that Seamus just figured it out.
"What's this?" Draco asks, looking at the plain black notebook.
"I interrupted something didn't I?"
"Oh my god how did it take me this long to realise?" She mutters before she grabs her book and stands up.
"Okay, don't touch anything for the next 5 minutes." Pansy says, finishing the last nail before sitting up. Draco turns his head to see how Harry looks and has to quickly turn back to the front because the thoughts running through his head are sinful.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Draco says, resting his head on Harry's shoulder and Harry smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
"See you at the game." Harry winks at Draco before leaving the room and heading to the great hall. Most students are already there, including his team, so he goes and sits with them.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I..." He's not sure where he was going with that sentence; he doesn't think he has an ending in mind.
"Yes." He says, and it's obvious that he's lying, and madam Pomfrey raises an eyebrow.
"She said she wouldn't let anyone in."
"Sorry." Harry whispers and Draco frowns.
"You weren't bad, Draco. You kept me grounded cause god only knows most people here believed the chosen one stories. And third year was when I found out I had a godfather. He was the one that wrote to me and stuff." Harry says, his tone bittersweet.
"Yeah, Draco's still in there. She wanted to ask us about you."
Harry shrugs and looks down at the table. He can feel Malfoys eyes burning into him and all he want's to do is turn and meet his gaze. But he knows that will just raise more questions and desires and emotions and he is far too tired to even attempt to try and pretend he isn't in love with the prat so he just looks out the window and hopes everyone leaves him alone for the rest of the lesson. Of course he's not that lucky.
On the bright side I started posting a new fic that is not Drarry but it is my first Hargrove fic so if you're into that then go check it out and if you're not then check it out anyway please thank you love you lots <3
, Kreacher. I'm going to bed, I think."
"Harry, I'm ready." He whispers and Harry leans down to kiss Draco on the lips.
"I'm leaving now." He says and Harry pouts, tightening his grip on Draco's shirt, suddenly looking nervous.
"You may go, Potter." Harry looks at her in shock.
"This why you brought me here?" Draco asks, his voice breathless, and Harry chuckles.
"You're kind of beautiful." Harry says, eyes full of love, and Draco closes the gap between them, and Harry immediately puts his hands on Draco's waist, feeling the soft velvet under his fingers.
"Good job buddy." He smiles at Teddy, high fiving him. Harry decides to actually get some work done and by lunch he's finished his DADA homework and sent the letter he wrote. He puts his stuff away and throws his bag over his shoulder, picking up Teddy but pausing before they leave and turning to Malfoy. Through the time they've been here Malfoy has been nice to Teddy, hugging and playing along and adding to Teddy's amazing imagination, and then threatening Harry with murder or pain if he told anyone after every cute thing he did.
An hour later both of the boys are done with their homework and the box, once containing chocolate wands, is now empty. Harry hasn't felt like this in a while, and even though he is no where near happy, he is closer than he's been in months. He also hasn't been this full in ages as all he's been eating is a mouthful of food each meal to keep the worried glances to a minimum.
"Yeah. Tired. You can, er, you can take the book." Harry says, pulling the book off the shelf and holding it out for Blaise to take, and Blaise knows he's lying and he also knows that none of Harry's friends are here and none of them ever manage to cheer him up, so he knows he has to do something.
Also I am yet again behind on chapters I'm sorry I am a mess my friends hate me and my life is literally falling apart. Also I'm still working. That's shit too.
"Yeah, maybe. Sirius used to say he was going to see a therapist at some point. Died before he could, but if he thought it would help him then it can help me." Harry says, a look of sad longing in his eyes, and McGonagall smiles.
"Shove off, mate." He jokes and Ron grins.
"Don't pretend like you don't know." Harry says, continuing to play with Draco's fingers, trying to show Draco that it's going to be fine, and when Blaise grins Draco relaxes slightly.
"Well you look great." Hermione says but Harry sees concern in her eyes. He nods slightly as a thank you and spends the rest of the evening silent. All through dinner he doesn't interact with anyone and spends most of it reading, managing to finish his book, and he knows people are watching him or looking at him with worried or concerned eyes, so it's really not a surprise when Professor McGonagall asks to talk to him after dinner.
"Lovely to meet you, Harry." Narcissa smiles, and Harry lets her pull him into a hug. "But seriously, I'm happy to see you. You're always welcome here." She whispers, and Harry smiles slightly as he hugs her back just as tight.
"They probably knew about the memories. Probably wanted you to find out from your parents' memory rather than from them." Draco offers and Harry nods, leaning into Dracos gentle touch as his hands run through his hair.
"We're so proud of you, Harry." Sirius whispers in his hair and Harry takes a deep breath before turning to hug Remus.
"Harry sir, would you like something to calm you? Tea perhaps?" Kreacher asks and Harry sighs, stopping his pacing.
"I think it's more he doesn't trust Draco. But what's important is that you do, and that he trusts you. Being in a relationship with no trust is like being on a rowboat with no oars. You can paddle with your hands but in the end you'll not get anywhere and you'll be exhausted." Draco smiles slightly, he does trust Harry.
"You're good too, Draco." He says and for the first time ever Draco actually believes him.
"Talk to me." Harry opens his eyes and blinks at Draco.
"Potter?" Draco asks nervously. He's standing behind Harry and sees him sigh.
"Seemed like you did." Harry mutters. If she's just going to lie he doesn't want her to be here.
"So you're free to come Hogsmeade with me after the Slytherin/Hufflepuff game tomorrow?" Rhys asks and Harry's eyes shoot up to meet Rhys'.
"I don't know why you bother arguing, Harry." Hermione jokes and Draco wonders how the hell they had an argument through looks.
"Well... Divination is gonna be fun next period." Blaise says and Harry smiles slightly at his attempt to lighten the mood.
"Yeah, okay, you're right. Positives outweigh the negatives."
"Hey, Winky."
"I love you too." He says and Harry smiles, leaning forwards and pressing a kiss against Draco's flushed cheek.
Harry tells her about the first time Draco comforted him and every night since then and how they use each others first names and about how Draco has nightmares sometimes too and how they act when it's just the two of them in their dorm room. The whole time he's talking he realises how weird it is to be doing all of this with Draco and how normal it all feels.
Draco's eyes dart to Harry as he enters the hall, his hair is still a beautiful mess but his eyes are no longer red. He walks over to his friends at the Gryffindor table and sits in between Seamus and Hermione. He looks really confused and Draco wonders whether it's because of him.
"I'm not hungry." Harry says. McGonagall frowns slightly.
"What you doing out here?" Draco asks and Harry smiles slightly.
"Potter you missed dinner and you were out in a storm." McGonagall says softly so only he can hear, sounding like she doesn't know what she's going to do with him, and Harry bites his lip. He hates upsetting or disappointing her.
"Ginny wanted some sugary food to help with revision so he brought some to cheer her up. I told him that I'd told Ron and that he didn't take it well and he said he'd talk to him." Harry explains and Draco nods.
"You could have stayed in Hogsmeade, you know." Harry says lightly and Rhys scoffs.
"Open the window." He says quickly, and Neville jumps up to open the window just as the broom flies through it at top speed.
"Not true. You've been going on and on about Draco since first year." Ron says and Harry chuckles when Draco blushes dark red.
“Did we miss it?” Sirius asks as the young harry grips his shirt.
"But they're not you."
"I just-"
"What?" He asks, confused, and Harry smiles slightly.
"He slept, Malfoy. With you. He slept when you were there. He slept peacefully. For the first time in months. When you were with him. No one else has made that happen." Ron says and Draco's eyes flash with realisation.
"Harry!" He calls and Harry stops walking and turns around. Malfoy looks nervous and awkward, blushing slightly when Harry looks at him, but Blaise looks concerned. Harry walks back down the stairs and stops in front of Blaise.
"I'm a mess."
"What the fuck?"
"Technically we're first cousins once removed, but yes, to make things easy we are cousins." Malfoy says, turning back to his work. He looks off today, I mean he's always in a weird mood but he seems different today, sadder maybe. Harry wonder if it's because of Teddy. He grins as he looks down at Teddy's adorable face, a face that could make anyone smile, even Malfoy himself.
"Us?"
"Thank you, McGonagall." Harry says and McGonagall smiles at him as he leaves her office and heads back to his dorm.
"Come off it, Blaise."
"I shouted at Ron. They don't want me around anymore cause apparently I'm always sad and bring the tone down." Harry mumbles but his voice is void of emotion and he's staring straight ahead. Blaise stays quiet to see if Harry wants to continue, and when he doesn't Blaise frowns.
"I love you too, Ron. But I've loved so many people. And it hurts so much. They leave, or they betray you, or they die, and it hurts. And every time it breaks you, and eventually there aren't enough pieces of you left to fix yourself with. I just don't think I can cope if it happens again." Harry says and he doesn't know when he started crying, just that there are tears falling down his cheeks.
"Yeah." Blaise looks at him for a second before smiling.
"It's just- I'm scared." Harry admits and Draco looks so far into his eyes that Harry is sure he's seeing his soul.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Literally nothing gets past you." Harry mutters and George grins.
"Thank you." Harry says and Draco frowns.
"Not that we're together, just that I've had the biggest crush on you since I was 12." Draco blushes and Harry grins.
Harry casts another silent wandless charm to clean them both up and Draco presses a kiss to Harry's chest.
"They weren't having a chat about the potion they made, they we're talking. Like actually talking."
"I know." Harry says softly, knowing there's no way Draco has a response. Draco just leans against his side and rests his head on Harry's shoulder.
"Okay, well, I will announce the quidditch captains on Friday at breakfast, and will let everyone know to come to me to sign up for Gryffindor, so you won't have to deal with the people that will use this as an excuse to talk to you and ask questions." She says and Harry smiles.
"Granger." He calls and he sees her sigh before she stops walking and turns around.
"You're fucked by the way mate." Ron says as soon as Harry gets to him and he raises an eyebrow, letting him continue.
"Go and wait in my office, Potter, I'll be with you shortly."
When Harry gets there he sits next to Ron in his usual seat and Seamus turns to look at him.
”Yeah, you look great Harry.” Blaise agrees, and Harry turns back to him and Draco. Blaise hits Dracos arm, and Draco clears his throat.
"What about it? Anyone got it right yet?" He asks and she shakes her head.
"I'm scared." Harry confesses, and Draco leans back slightly to look into Harry's eyes.
"What happened?" She asks.
"You poor little pure-blood. Ship is a muggle term, if you think two people would make or are a perfect couple you ship them. It basically means you think they're perfect for each other and you want them to be in a relationship." Harry explains.
He can't say any of this out loud, of course, so he just ignores his friends and stares out the window. If he looks careful enough he can make out Malfoys reflection and he can see him watching him and Harry just wants to turn around and - He's not sure what he wants to do but kissing him seems like a good option. He just sighs and turns back to the front of the class as the bell rings. He picks up his bag and leaves the class just in front of Malfoy, and the second he's through the door Seamus appears at his side.
"Mione!" Harry calls as he enters the common room, catching the attention of most of the room.
"Er... Oh! Grab me one of them quill things from George would ya?" Harry says before pointing at his bedside table.
"Dumbledore made them. I wanted to go and live with my godfather. Dumbledore would have gone mad, though, and Sirius was the ministry's most wanted so he was in hiding."
"Hi Diane, I'm good, how are you?" Harry exchanges pleasantries with his neighbour for a few minutes, and then she mentions Draco.
"They know. But it doesn't matter. Not to them. Not to me. The world isn't split into good people and death eaters, Draco. We all have both light and dark in us. What matters is the part we choose to act upon. You had no choice in the war, Draco. You did what you had to in order to survive, to keep you and your family safe. You're a good person, Draco Malfoy." Harry says, and Draco buries his face in Harry's shoulder.
"I know, Winky let me know. Well done."
Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Harry stand up and as they start walking he throws his arm around Hermiones shoulders as a way of silently showing his appreciation for her friendship. Harry sees some girls glare at Hermione as they walk down the table to leave the hall and Harry rolls his eyes. As if he's with Hermione, she's very much in love with Ron, and visa versa. Harry leaves the great hall and walks to the common room with Ron, Hermione and Ginny before grabbing his bag with all the thing's he'll need for his essay and makes his way to the library. He sits in the far back corner hidden by rows and rows of bookshelves and sighs in relief at the fact that no one else is there. He pulls his potions notes, textbook, parchment, quill and ink out of his bag before tucking the bag under the table. He doesn't know why he even bothers to attempt potions without Hermione here to help, it's without a doubt his least favourite subject and he's horrible at it.
"You can sit down, Potter." She says as she enters the office. Harry sits in the chair closest to him. McGonagall is silent as she walks round her desk and sits down before looking at Harry for a few minutes before sighing.
"You okay?" He asks. Harry doesn't know if he's ready to share his secret hideout with anyone just yet, so he smiles and nods before turning around and continuing down the tunnel, never letting go of Draco's hand. They reach the end of the tunnel, under honeydukes, and Harry raises the floor tile above him slowly. Draco watches as Harry removes the tile completely before pulling himself up and through the hole. Draco follows behind Harry, thoroughly enjoying the view of Harrys muscles as he pulls himself up, and when they're both out of the tunnel Harry replaces the tile. They walk out of the basement and slip into the main shop undetected. Hogsmeade is pretty empty today as it's Sunday and Hogwarts students usually go on Saturday. The pair walk through the town and Draco notices Harry looks uncomfortable when people look at him in that adoring or sympathetic way.
Draco leaves to get ready as he didn't bring any clothes with him, and Harry sighs the second he's gone. He knows being vague isn't going to help anything, but he can't bring himself to tell Draco outright what he's so afraid of, because if he does, Draco might realise he's right and leave him.
The finish the walk to the great hall in silence and when Harry sits down in between Seamus and Dean they both automatically start piling food onto his plate so they know he will eat. Harry grimaces slightly at the thought of eating any more but he forces himself to take a few bites to keep his friends happy. After eating around 3 roast potatoes and a tiny piece of chicken Harry decides thats enough. He stands up, slightly too quickly as he gets a bit light headed, and walks out of the hall. He knows his friends are watching him as he leaves and they're probably worried that he hasn't really eaten since he's been back. What they don't know is that Harry hasn't really eaten since he died. He ate a bit when Kreacher would make him food and practically force him to eat it, but he never made himself food and if it wasn't for Kreacher he would have died of starvation months ago.
"I'm in the same room as you right now." Harry says and Seamus smirks.
"I saw the look on your face when you saw what it did, Harry. You were scared."
"Sirius moved in with your father?" Draco asks and Harry nods.
"Hermione is gonna be back soon." He breathes, knowing he should get off of Draco because he doesn't really want anyone to know what just happened; he's not even sure what it means. The only problem is in order to get off of Draco he'd actually need to move and he doesn't want to move away from him.
"I spoke to Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Zabini last night, and it's really important that you tell me the truth, Harry. Did you redirect a curse?" She asks and Harry sighs.
“What’s that?” She asks, motioning to the pensive.
"Alright, to warm up you just gotta fly round the outside of the pitch and avoid the bludgers." Harry nods down to Dean, who opens the box and releases the bludgers. Harry watches and makes note of the people that have trouble flying or dodging, and after a few minutes he blows the whistle and lands by Seamus and Dean, everyone following suit.
"So glad you could come!" Blaise grins at them, hugging them both.
"Not now, Blaise." He says, voice solemn yet pleading, and Blaise knows that Draco can't do that and it's breaking his heart, so he lets it go.
"Are you saying he's in love with me? Am I in love with him?" He asks and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"You don't think I fucked it up?" Draco chuckles as Harry takes his hand, playing with his fingers.
