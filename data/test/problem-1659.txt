be only half past five, could it? Not on a Sunday! But yes, the clock was telling him it was just after half past five. Sighing, he sat up in bed.
He was prevented from continuing when Potter held up a hand. "Please, just – just let me do this, alright? I'm nervous enough as it is without you interrupting me."
Pressing the heel of his hand into his eyes, Harry took a deep breath. He didn't need to ask what was disgusting, as this was a conversation the two of them had been having for the past month or so.
The effect was immediate. Harry could see the softening of the lines in Draco's face as the words – and the sentiment behind them – took hold. Leaning back into the embrace, Draco's eyes closed.
Potter nodded. "Yeah. There were other things as well, like making me cook and clean. And my cousin Dudley. He was allowed to treat me however he wanted." Shifting in his seat, Potter shoved his glasses up his nose. "He was the school bully. He used to beat on various people, but I was his favourite. Guess I was convenient."
"Oh, right, yeah." Harry glanced down to his own feet, which were covered in muck from outside. Frowning again, he decided to change the subject. "How about a drink, then?"
Draco nodded silently, watching as Potter slid into the booth across from him and wriggled until he was settled. The first few times they had attempted a meet-up like this had not gone well. In fact, Draco was fairly certain he had almost gotten himself hexed on numerous occasions. The point, though, he figured, was that they had tried again. And again. They had actually tried multiple times over the past couple of months to find some kind of common ground. There seemed to only be one major thing they had in common, however: Quidditch.
Harry jumped on the opportunity Draco had presented before he could continue. Wrapping his arms around Draco's waist, he rested his chin on Draco's shoulder.
Draco was standing before the full-length mirror, as Harry had known that he would be. His hands were placed gently on the sides of his belly, rubbing small circles as he frowned at himself.
Malfoy seemed to consider this for a few seconds. "Well, my parents will occasionally have friends over after Christmas Day. People they want to impress if we're in Italy, and closer friends if we're in France. I am allowed to invite friends as well, but only for the New Year's celebrations." He paused to clear his throat, a slight tinge of pink entering his cheeks. "Mother has always said that when I find 'someone special', they will, of course, be invited along as well."
When Potter didn't respond immediately, Draco glanced up. He still held the napkin, but it was now tightly scrunched in his fist. Draco frowned.
this time. It was slow, and soft, and made Potter moan against Draco's lips, just as a first kiss should. Draco was smiling when he pulled back.
Potter was still waving the cinnamon stick. Draco watched as tiny flecks of chocolate – both melted and in milk form – flew over the table. He shook his head.
"Not really." Potter removed the cinnamon stick from his chocolate and waved it towards Draco, splattering chocolate on the table. "There's been Muggle football and basketball teams who have stayed on the top of the table for years. All it takes is the best players."
Harry nodded again. He watched Malfoy move off to the bar. As Malfoy walked, Harry allowed his eyes to drift slowly downwards.
Draco shook his head. "No, it's a natural thing to ask this time of year. And it's not like you were the one who imposed the restrictions on my family." In fact, it had been Potter's testimony in front of the Wizengamot that had kept both Draco and his father out of Azkaban, he was sure of it. "What about you? Are you going back to those Muggles you live with?"
Potter wasn't in the first two carriages. Shoving the door to the third carriage open, he thought he caught a snatch of conversation in a familiar voice. Taking long strides, he glanced into each of the compartments in turn before
These fits of self-doubt were becoming more and more frequent as the pregnancy progressed. There was no doubt in Harry's mind, however, of just how excited Draco was about this baby. His only real worry now was that, with the unpredictable mood swings Draco was also prone to, he would end up physically exhausted by the end of the nine months.
Shrugging as he trailed off, Potter returned his attention to his drink. Draco could only stare in shock. A
The tone to his voice hadn't changed one bit, but his posture told Draco that this was a sensitive subject. Still, his curiosity was piqued.
Shooting a nearby first-year a glare, Draco sighed. "I don't recall ever being that short and annoying."
Before Draco could even think of ignoring the request and speaking again, Potter rose up onto his toes and planted a kiss directly on Draco's lips. It lasted less than a second and when Potter pulled away, he was
you say when someone made that kind of revelation? It seemed that Potter didn't need him to say anything, however.
The slide of one of Draco's hands around Harry's waist had him grinning in response. "It's Sunday, Draco. I will happily spend the
"Here you go." A large, steaming mug thunked down on the table before him, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. "You can grab the next one."
Harry jumped, Malfoy's sudden appearance across the table from him startling him. He hadn't seen him enter the pub, which was quiet enough that he would have noticed. Glancing around, he frowned.
"Draco?" His husband was, of course, not in the bed beside him. A second sigh came, this one a little louder, from the direction of the bathroom. "Draco, what are you doing?"
There were objections, as Draco had figured there would be. Potter managed to extricate himself, however, with none of his hangers-on.
“Dance partners, Mr Potter. The champions and their dance partners traditionally open the ball. You shall be required to participate.”
“Luna Lovegood,” Draco sighs. “Ravenclaw, third year, a distant cousin on my father’s side. Most people call her Loony.”
Harry has caught himself tagging onto his descriptions of people on more than one occasion. He’s lucky it’s succeeded by instant horror and mortification at the learned, ingrained motion to single people out; it's not as if they’re actually much different compared to
Although undoubtedly better than the period immediately post-Great Goblet Debacle, Harry considers the next week a living nightmare. Neither can he find the courage nor drive to walk up to a girl and ask her out to the ball. Not even on Professor McGonagall’s pain of death.
“Not yet,” he whispers back. Fleur had come running up to him in a tizzy at breakfast, but neither Krum nor Cedric were anywhere to be seen.
“I’m proud of you,” Hermione says, tone much less excitable than her expression. Harry appreciates the attempt at subtlety, at least.
now, is it?” George asks, surprising Harry by poking him between the shoulder blades. “Potter keeping secrets for Draco, what a concept!”
“Aha!” Dumbledore says suddenly. “Unless I am mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons is fast approaching!”
“Nose out, or I’ll burn that for you too,” Fred says, waving his wand around. “Anyway, you lot got dates for the ball? I heard Miss Granger has an admirer!”
Harry bites his lip. “To cast the spell I need to have a clear idea of what I’m looking for; I need to think of the appearance, purpose or sentimental value. The wand movement needs to be a sharp flick backwards, as if casting a fishing line…”
“Didn’t see that one working out, either,” Draco says. “Cassius was never going to say yes if his mother had a chance of finding out… I wonder what happened.”
Harry laughs derisively. The sound ricochets off the stone. “You’ll be surprised by what people believe.”
Draco laughs. Actually laughs, and it’s not mean or anything. “Of course not, Potter. Ah, don’t they look like they’re having fun?”
Potter,” Madam Pomfrey insists. She bustles over and prods him onto a bed. “Now don’t move, I need to clean this.”
“Oh, you should’ve been there! It was—” Ron turns suddenly and claps both of his hands to her mouth, almost pushing her off balance.
Harry snorts. “Fred, I think you’re the only one other than Hagrid and Hermione herself to make that connection.”
They trade spells with lightning reactions and audacious flair, bouncing the audience’s attention back and forth like a taped Wimbledon match on fast-forward.
Harry eats what feels like enough for two and then some, and then the desserts turn up. Ron tries to attract Fleur over by placing pretty sweets in her line of sight, but she appears to be quite content with the multitude of desserts she has at the Slytherin table.
“Ah, ’ere you are!” Fleur says, hurrying up to them with two plates of food in hand. She hands one to Malfoy.
“Only a week away!” says Ernie Macmillan, several bottle cap badges gleaming against his Hufflepuff robes. “I wonder if Cedric’s heard… I’ll go find him just in case!”
“That was rude,” Harry says off-handedly, pretty sure that he’s just been called a variant of stupid, though he isn’t too sure of…
“Stop,” he says, almost hoarse. Moody doesn’t take any notice. “Stop!” he repeats, louder, just as Professor McGonagall comes running into the courtyard. “Stop it, you’re hurting him!”
Harry shrugs. He runs the handkerchief between his fingers. “Maybe I subconsciously took what you said to heart. Maybe I’m only being civil for the project.
“Oh, I had an idea about that,” Harry says. “We can split them up, right, and take a few every day. That way it isn’t so hard for one person controlling eight cats.”
Harry inhales deeply and presses his hand to the wood. Just before he pushes it open he has a thought, hurriedly unpinning his new badge and putting it in his pocket.
“Over here!” he yells, as if the horntail was going to let him out of her sight. She tugs and strains against her chains.
“Well, all of the school heads are on the panel,” Hermione tells him. All of them turn to look at her. She huffs. “Do none of you read
They wheel around and shoot back towards their friends waiting for them on the lawns. Malfoy holds the snitch out as they land, and his team cheers.
The horntail flaps towards him and shrieks when he dodges. Malfoy’s stupid stab does sound like it might be useful right about now, but then again, anything would.
“Yes, well. I’ve been made aware that we need to start smaller, to angle for appropriate pay, paid holiday, and the like.”
Harry’s one consolation is that his and Cedric’s plan had executed perfectly: no one at the Prophet is dedicated enough to their job to scrutinise the photographs too closely. At least not those of Harry.
“Whatever it is, we can work it out later,” Harry says. He heaves it onto a table by the dormitory stairs as everyone gets back into the swing of the party, passing around plates of food and calling loudly for each other’s attention. Someone switches on the record player and Harry happily allows himself to be twisted and turned between all of his friends for conversation and congratulations.
“I’m thinking I really might just take Ron and be done with it,” Harry grumbles. “McGonagall would be to blame for that, anyway.”
“Shit,” he breathes. The horntail tries to toast his rocky cover to, crucially, no avail. Harry thinks desperately of the largest non-magical snake he can.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow, finally falling into step and releasing Harry’s wrist as if his hand was never there. “Not so as you’d notice. And why would
“Here you go.” Harry reaches out and taps the star onto Ron’s cheek. It sticks there and smoothes itself onto his skin. Harry giggles.
“Er, yeah, of course,” Harry says. “I have one for you too, hold on.” It’s a complete lie, but he doesn’t think he could take Dobby’s kindness without giving something in return. He leans over the side of his bed and into his sock drawer, pulling out one of his least-used (and least holey) pairs of socks. “Sorry I forgot to wrap them,” he says.
“I am,” Krum says, and flicks his wand. The robes ripple and an ink wash of black flows over them. He flicks his wand again and Cedric yelps, twisting around to see his back. A large black H has embroidered itself onto his Hufflepuff robes, satisfyingly eye-catching.
“All right, all right,” Malfoy tuts, strutting over in tight grey jeans and a black shirt. Harry is horrified to realise how appealing it is on him. “Disappointed you could make it, Potter. Didn’t get caught, I presume?”
“Za—er, Blaise,” Ron stammers, swallowing hard. Harry stares between them, suddenly seeing everything fall into place.
It turns out that Ron is more than right—a full three days after the letter the best plans they have to clear the common room are to either announce dorm room parties, enlist the help of too-nosy-for-their-own-good Fred and George, or to drop a bag of stinkbombs. Harry hopes it won’t come to the stinkbombs. Filch would skin them.
“Never!” jeer Fred and George, grasping the high of success with both hands. Harry takes his seat and makes sure he still has all eight cats. Avennia mewls in his ear and tries to chew his hair.
“Blaise, you can stop acting like an upstanding member of society now,” Parkinson calls over. She lifts her wand and levitates the crates in their hands to the table Zabini had pointed to, unshrinking them as they go. Harry is distracted by her sharp-looking red nails, and how they match both her lipstick and very short skirt. She otherwise looks to be in keeping with the Slytherins-in-black theme of the night.
“It’s almost time for the ceremony,” he says shortly. “I’m not sure this is quite an appropriate place for an
“Wait, isn’t Cho Chang going out with Cedric Diggory?” says one of the girls. Harry probably ought to find out their names.
The champions are ushered over to either side of the doors to greet the parade of their peers. Harry and Parvati take the same side as Fleur and Roger Davies, who looks utterly floored by his luck and can hardly take his eyes off his partner. Harry returns Fleur’s pleased smile and looks across to the others, and at the girl in the pale blue. He hears Parvati gasp beside him.
“I don’t know!” he says instead. “Charlie was there—Ron’s brother. He says he thinks they have a death wish for us because the dragons were mothers. There were eggs, too.”
There’s a bang, and several twittering little birds shoot out of the end of the wand and flutter outside through the open window.
Something catches the tail of his broom and he goes spinning. He yells out, separated from his broom and falling, falling…
“Let’s go find a school owl,” he says. They both ruffle Harry’s hair as they amble past. He squawks and struggles away, but their arms are just too long to evade.
You’re already famous enough as it is. He doesn’t mention it, but of course he’s going to be upset.”
Cedric snorts a laugh when Harry explains the plan. “Sure, let’s do it. You’re great, you know that?”
“I didn’t know you were competing, Mr Bagman,” she snipes, but slips her hand in anyway. She draws out a moving figurine about the size of Harry’s little finger: the Welsh green. Around its neck is tied a seared wooden tag with the number two. She inhales deeply and stares down at it with determination.
Harry runs a hand through his hair, dislodging a small cloud of the stuff and making them all jump back. “Courtesy of the Weasleys.”
“What are you showing me?” Harry asks, feeling guilty about hiding Malfoy under the cloak. He hopes it isn’t anything to do with those skrewts, or any cerberuses or dragons he’s bought off a stranger in the pub.
History! Or A Highly Biased and Selective History, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School!”
“And now, Mr Potter if you please!” Bagman’s voice clamours into Harry’s awareness and he looks up and around. The stands, now shield-free, are so full they heave with life. Ludo Bagman is waving him over. They come to a stop near the middle of the stadium to look up.
“Oh, shit,” Harry whispers. The corridor is narrow, and Filch is likely only seconds from meeting them in the middle. “Be quiet.”
“Fine!” Malfoy sighs, throwing his hands up dramatically. “Meet me in the library after dinner and I’ll
Flummoxed and now in the arms of a Beauxbatons boy he sort-of recognises, he blinks and doesn’t argue at all when he automatically takes the lead.
“Your plans! It’s all madness! You fought a giant basilisk with just a sword, and you expect us to think that you’re
“Try to keep in step with me,” Harry whispers, wishing he wouldn’t notice the press of their shoulders.
“They have one for each of us, we saw them,” Harry says. “And Malfoy said your brother was fit, by the way.”
She laughs. “Thank you. Now, I saw some of your team heading out to play Quidditch, so give me the cats and you can go join in.”
Hermione drags Harry and Ginny away from their onslaught of raucous bickering, Ron in tow, the four of them sniggering and stumbling over the rocky lawns.
“Lovely,” she says. She tears the top piece of parchment and stashes it away into her bag. “So, Harry, what made you decide on entering the Triwizard Tournament?”
She closes the overlarge door behind her and takes his offered arm. Harry frowns, sharing a baffled glance with Malfoy, and they set off jogging after them. Hagrid can’t have wanted to show him Madame Maxime, that’s ridiculous, but their stroll doesn’t seem to be taking them much of anywhere and it is rather cold. He doesn’t particularly want to listen to their small talk, either.
“...and I need to think about having the object in my hands when I cast it, or it will struggle to gauge the intent.”
“Why do they move in packs?” he even asks Ron one day. “How’re you supposed to get on on their own?”
Disclaimer: To copy a message from my last 2/3 posts, I really didn't think I was going to post this at all. This was more a casual project of bursts of inspiration than anything, but I'm afraid all of that left after JKR started spouting vitriol over on twitter. I thought I would go ahead and post this regardless, just for the few people who may take some enjoyment out of it :)
Dumbledore promises the safekeeping of her horses, and she is soon leading her students into the castle, away from the very real threat of frostbite.
Malfoy puts his hands up in surprised surrender, backing off a few paces before returning to the Slytherin table. Harry looks from him to Hermione, who is back in her notebook and seemingly unconcerned.
He thinks of Hermione, how clever and sharp she is, how pretty she is when Ginny or Fred or Fleur makes her blush, and exactly the words Uncle Vernon would have for her if she were ever to have the misfortune of meeting him. Horrible ones, ones Harry had heard said so often and so cruelly about utter strangers.
There’s a sharp rise in noise as everyone’s chairs shriek against the stone and they scramble all of their papers into their bags. Lavender’s giggles have been joined by Parvati’s, and there’s a huge clamour of discussion about the ball.
“Yes!” Harry breathes, wishing belatedly that he’d paid more attention. “There’s one for each of us. A Hungarian horntail, which has a horrible spikey tail, and the red one… A Chinese fireball. A um, common green Welsh dragon? And, um, it was silver and began with… Oh—Swedish snot-shout! No, wait, short-shout.
Skeeter smiles sweetly. “I was merely suggesting the possibility that your views may be somewhat outdated.”
The song ends, and Harry is lost in a horrible churning of anticipation, nerves, and disappointment. Without him noticing, Draco has danced them right to the edge of the crowd. He drops Harry’s hand and waves down Parvati and Pansy, and, once Harry’s been reintroduced to his date, is gone.
A ripple passes through the students, in which the wake is as still as stale. Dumbledore smiles, and waves to Filch, lurking at the back of the hall. Filch scrambles to open the huge doors, and a tall wooden chest glides through. Dumbledore lowers his hand, and it sets itself on the floor in front of him.
Seconds later, a large, bright yellow canary stands in Neville’s place. The room roars with laughter, shuffling closer to see him hop around and ruffle his feathers.
Bagman tells them. “You’ll know when you see it. On the canon then, Mr Diggory!” He turns to leave but stops short. “Harry, may I have a word?”
“Well, anyway. I’ve a bet with my father, you see. He thinks you won’t last ten minutes in the Tournament, but I disagree.” He leans into Harry’s space, flicking his eyes over his frame once, up and down. “I think you won’t last five.”
Harry grins and unwraps the paper, pulling out two starkly mismatched woolen (surprise, surprise) socks. One is his house red and patterned with broomsticks, while the other is a deep green and covered ankle to toe in little golden snitches.
Harry watches Fleur climb expertly onto the shoulders of a boy he recognises. He stands up, and she towers over the crowds.
“He can’t apparate in or out, because of the wards,” Ron says. Hermione smiles proudly at him. He smiles back. “I doubt he could use the floo, either.”
“Good, all good,” says Mr Ollivander. He hands the wand back to Krum. “Last but not least, Mr Potter.”
ever made a fuss?” Malfoy says loudly, and half the table bursts out laughing. Harry tries not to choke, and Malfoy hides his small smile behind his goblet.
“I wouldn’t say that,” Harry hazards, focusing on cutting up his roast potatoes. Hermione chuckles and pats his arm.
“C’mon, he deserves a bit of a break,” Ron says, just as the card tower blows up and singes his eyebrows.
Harry frowns. “I didn’t actually think to check… Well anyway, I was hardly going to molest an eleven-year-old by going through her pockets, was I?” A nearby second-year gives him a very alarmed look as they go by. He rolls his eyes. “I was already trying to haul you over to the door, and Riddle was prattling on about his greatness, and then you were too busy sobbing when you woke up to do much of anything!”
Cedric jogs away down the corridor. Harry goes to find something to do until dinner. Maybe he’ll go to the library and look up those dragons…
Karkaroff, having been invited inside, calls him forward. He goes, and they lead the way into the castle.
Ron lifts his goblet of orange juice. “Hear hear. Let’s take that as it is and pretend everything’s fine.”
“Now, you won’t mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, will you Harry? It allows me to talk to you normally.”
“You know, he asked about you two a few times when we went to Egypt, but I didn’t really think much of it,” he says conspiratorially.
“The expert is upstairs with Dumbledore, right now, but once that’s all done there’ll be a little photoshoot,” Bagman continues. “This here is Rita Skeeter, she’ll be doing a small piece for the Daily Prophet.” He turns around to introduce Harry to the witch in bright magenta robes.
Harry spends half of History of Magic writing his letter to Sirius and the other half playing with kittens. He sneaks them out of the crate when Hermione isn’t paying attention and sits them on his desk, letting them sniff at his parchment and bat at his hovering quill. Rosanna meows loudly when she rolls off the table and into his lap. Binns, as expected, does not care in the least.
“Walking,” Harry says. He turns around to glare at Snape, noting the shifty form of Karkaroff clinging to the shadows behind him.
“Once?” he repeats. He daren’t even hope for anything less than antagonistic, but all Draco responds with is, “Once,” said even more quietly, and a small nod. Harry follows his gaze to his shoes and back up again.
“One champion will be chosen from each school. They will be scored on how well they perform during each of the Tournament tasks, and whoever ends with the highest score will win the Triwizard Cup.”
Harry sprints back up to the dorms to collect the map and some money. He leads Dean, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Seamus to the statue of the humpback witch. He checks the map for approaching witnesses and taps the statue with his wand.
Nott nods again and wanders off, his hands shoved deeply into his pockets. Harry sighs and finds a sofa to sit down and eat his chocolate frog, snagging a butterbeer while he’s at it. Davies taps him on the shoulder and compliments his flying, so he throws himself deep into a conversation about Quidditch plays. Ginny joins them some minutes later, tripping over the sofa leg and falling straight into Harry’s lap.
After a long moment, longer than the others, he conjures a fountain of wine and pronounces the wand fine.
“Yeah,” Harry says, wondering if he still knows any words with more than one syllable. “I don’t know. Have you been having fun?”
Several times, Harry finds himself gazing at Cho instead of scanning the field. Once, he catches himself watching Malfoy, and quickly shakes himself. It’s always been Harry who’s better at spotting the snitch first, there’s no need to mark him.
Harry folds the parchment, shoving it up his sleeve. He’s happy, at least, to know that Sirius is somewhere nearby. At least he won’t have to wait very long to hear from him.
“Yes?” He shoves a hand into a pocket and holds out another badge. Harry takes it and pins it to the front of his robes.
“Oh, look,” Malfoy says. “Give them here. It’s my turn tomorrow anyway, and Merlin knows you need your wits about you. Can’t have you murdered by a dragon after I put all that effort into helping you—people will begin to doubt my abilities.”
Harry isn’t really paying attention. He’s hyper aware of Malfoy’s hands on his shoulder and back, and his shaky breathing in his ear.
Harry shrugs, feeling his heart race in his chest even as he keeps his expression firmly impassive. “Makes things a bit easier then, doesn’t it.”
Ron and Hermione hand them some more money and send them off. It takes them just over a half-hour, in which time the remaining four hang around trying their damndest to look inconspicuous. Neville was quite smart to beg out, if being on the roped-in-friends end of breaking the rules is always this fraught.
“Mum reads her stuff sometimes,” Ron muses through a mouthful of chicken. He pokes a little bit towards Charlie in her new niffler-proof cage. “All sounds like nonsense to me.”
“Ignore the quill, Harry,” Skeeter tells him firmly. He snaps his gaze back to hers. “Now, tell me; why did you enter?”
“Of course I did!” Harry protests. “Hagrid brought Madam Maxime, and Karkaroff is bound to have been sneaking around. You’re the only one who doesn’t know!”
Sharing the cloak with Malfoy will mean close proximity. With Ron and Hermione it’s fine—he trusts them, they’re his friends, and he’s used to their contact. Malfoy… Not so much. Still, if they’re going to be stupid enough to do this, they both need to be under the cloak. He flicks out one side to throw around Malfoy’s shoulder and pulls the hood over both of their heads.
As soon as they finish eating, they race up to the Gryffindor Tower. Pig has long since been released to the owlery, but Harry retrieves the letter from where Ron’s left it on his pillow and takes it down to the common room.
Cedric Diggory smiles at him in the halls, handsome and kind as ever, but his jeering friends make Harry want to move to Hermione’s other side. Harry’d heard Malfoy making noise about his incompetence mere moments after his name had been drawn from the Goblet, and in the back of his mind he’d been rather hoping that people would believe him. Just this once. Alas, like his housemates, everyone seems pretty convinced that he had entered the Tournament himself.
Harry pulls the cloth down and stares at it. All around him there are people snickering, but Harry can’t help the smile threatening to break through again in the wake of Malfoy’s retreat. In his hand is a very fine cotton handkerchief, embroidered heavily around the edge and emblazoned with the Malfoy family crest and a very looping
Hermione returns to the Gryffindor common room just before lunch, sitting down and immediately putting quill to notebook. Harry sees several pages have been crossed completely through, and that someone else has also scribbled notes in several of the margins.
“Ah, yes,” says Mr Ollivander excitedly. “I remember this one. Containing a single hair from a rather majestic unicorn—seventeen hands, abouts, and it nearly gored me with its horn after I plucked its tail. Twelve and a quarter inches, pleasantly springy. It’s in fine condition, do you treat it regularly?”
At that moment, the gravity in the room seems to be drawing each and every person towards Professor Dumbledore.
Fleur and Viktor Krum, looking collected but a little anxious, are perched on two of four chairs by the door when they return. Fleur smiles when she sees them. She pats the chair next to her and allows her shoulders to drop, fractionally.
“Did you see Draco panicking yesterday when Viktor sat with us?” Feur asks the table at large. “It was very amusing, I think you would ’ave enjoyed it a lot.”
He’s falling. Freefalling so completely he can’t even draw breath, plummeting feet-first into the abyss that entrenches his home. There are rocks coming up to meet his flailing limbs. His robes are flapping and cracking in the wind. Above him the horntail bellows.
“Potter!” someone else calls. Harry sighs and looks towards the castle. Malfoy is gazing up at them with studied indifference, about fifteen feet away. Next to him stands very annoyed Slytherin Chaser Cassius Warrington, and they also have their brooms. There must be something in the air.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start? The youngest champion, you know… Just to add a bit of colour.”
“On such a note, I think it is time for bed. There shall be no lessons tomorrow, owing to the excitement of the contest. I bid you all a goodnight, and sweet dreams.”
Harry circles above, ducking her fire and rolling out of reach and trying his best to make a nuisance of himself.
The six artists and the choir bow graciously to the astonished faces of their friends and reclaim their seats.
Hermione smirks and stands up herself. She climbs onto the bench, mirrored astride the shield-tunnel by none other than Dra—
“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Harry tells her, and returns the tongue she sticks out at him.
Ron walks with Harry over to the tunnel. “Fleur’s was pretty impressive,” he says. “She shot this spell at it that made it wobble around a lot, vertigo, maybe, and then put on a light show to confuse it! All sorts of exploding sparks of light and fireworks—it was really cool. And then Krum came on and didn’t even think about flying! Imagine! He used a spell that did something to the dragons eyes and—oh, look!”
“Hello, my good friends,” he says, smiling. “I’m very glad you could join us for the third monthly committee meeting of the year.” He takes hold of Ron’s shoulder and leads them into the throng. “I do hope you’ll enjoy yourselves. Refreshments are over there by the tapestry of the banshee, and your additions are greatly appreciated.”
A few dozen older teenagers now stand, shivering, in her shadow. They all wear the same thin, silken blue robes, and Harry notices that they have a much higher proportion of students wearing headscarves than Hogwarts does. They stare at the castle, some impressed and others apprehensive.
Malfoy stares at the badge. Someone clears their throat and he blinks, hurriedly reattaching his usual sneer.
Through the crowd, Harry catches George’s eye. He waves, looking very softly pleased with himself, walking next to none other than Cassius Warrington. How he’d managed that, Harry would have to ask, though he notices they’re definitely not arm in arm. He can’t imagine Warrington giving in easily, even if he hadn’t been entirely disinterested before. Harry wonders what his family’s stance on a Weasley would be.
He feels a pull behind his navel and a very long Burmese python slithers forcefully into existence. He smiles, taken by surprise.
“I think your decorations are gorgeous,” Fleur says, driving them away from the more dangerous (dangerous for Harry’s heart more than anything else) territories. Harry lets their chatting wash over him, mostly, happy to sit out and panic uselessly in his own mind.
in Sirius’ heavier scrawl. The photograph falls out of the box and into his hand, and he can’t help the noise that wrenches itself from his throat at the sight.
Ron scoffs, indicating the trail of slobbering gazes. “I’m telling you, that’s not normal. They don’t make ’em like
“Are you going to let me go?” Harry asks once inside. Malfoy’s eyes snap up to his. His expression is truly unreadable.
Someone to Harry’s left whistles loudly, and the spell of silence that had descended over the welcome party shatters. They can see the silhouettes of people moving past each porthole to disembark, and soon the Durmstrang landing party has climbed the hill to great applause.
Harry, Ron and Hermione spy Fred and George at the end of the Gryffindor table and slide in to join them. Again, unusually, they are sitting apart from everyone and huddled over a messy piece of parchment.
that you do not try to enter if you are still underage.” Dumbledore looks out over all of them with an especially keen eye. “There shall be a line in place that you will not be able to cross. Entering this tournament means entering a legally binding magical contract. If you are chosen, you
Harry fidgets. Asclepius takes a swipe at last year’s Weasley jumper and gets two of his claws stuck. Harry disentangles him and puts him back in the carrier before he can wriggle free.
It’s well into December now, and Thursday's Transfiguration lesson has been over for at least five minutes. Harry looks up, wide-eyed at Professor McGonagall, shoving the rubber haddock his Weasley fake wand had turned into under the desk. Ron does the same with his tin parrot, both pretending they weren’t just having a sword fight with them in the back of her class.
“You know what I think?” Ron barrels on. “I think your father is cruel and horrid, and that you’re a right spoiled arse. You’re lucky I don’t always want to murder you anymore.” He grabs Harry’s shoulder and tugs him away. “Come on, we’re going.”
“In you go, you bloody Gryffindors,” he says, but nods appreciatively at the food they hand him as compensation. The wall slides back and, from the outside, it looks like nothing’s amiss. The common room is empty, fire roaring, and no noise whatsoever. They each step through, Hermione and Ron disappearing through a rippling bubble before Harry, who follows eagerly and—wow. Someone truly talented has given the place a makeover.
The dragon farthest away is a silvery blue, tall and thin and elegant, and is growling and snapping at its handlers. The next is green and stumpy, no smaller than the others, stamping around as if throwing a tantrum. It seems to be causing an earthquake with each footfall.
“Enjoy life as a ferret, Malfoy?” Seamus asks loudly. Most of the Gryffindors laugh. “Can’t have been much of a change!”
“There’s no time like the present, I suppose,” Fred announces, having cleared his plate of syrupy pancakes. He stands and bows deeply to Hermione, who watches him skeptically. “Would you care to accompany me, Most Wonderful Hermione Jean of the prestigious Grangers?”
“We thought we’d throw you your own party!” Katie giggles, sitting precariously on Lee’s shoulders. As soon as the portrait swings shut, complaining loudly all the way, several explosive booms fill the room. Fred and George are standing in the middle throwing Filibuster's Fireworks around the place, whooping and yelling and a catastrophe in the making.
“Potter,” Malfoy says, sitting down on the bench beside him. His voice lacks the customary unimpressed drawl, and Harry frowns very carefully at him. Maybe the Gryffindors are getting used to their mortal enemies turning up at their table, or maybe they just think it’s all a trick. Either way, the lack of glares and shocked faces has Harry worried for everyone’s sanity, despite his and Draco’s maybe-budding camaraderie. Maybe.
Harry licks his lips and darts his eyes around them before settling back on Draco’s tensed shoulders. “All right, well how about now?”
Malfoy scrambles to his feet and hides behind the nearest person, who just so happens to still be Harry. Professor McGonagall gives them an odd look, but quickly returns her ire to Professor Moody.
Snape frowns and turns his attention to Malfoy while the rest of the class files in. Malfoy stands at his desk and pretends steadfastly that none of them are watching him.
Harry makes a face and hopes it conveys his distress. By Cedric’s furrowing brow, it possibly just makes him look like he’s having a stroke.
“It’s true!” he shouts back down the stairs, and returns soon after with the cloak. They step out of the portrait, throwing it over their heads immediately. Ron hands Harry a small crate of Honeyduke’s poached from the stack and they giggle as they make their way down to the dungeons.
“Ron!” she huffs. She reads over the parchment and smiles too, sticking a gold star on Neville’s collar before passing it on.
Fleur rises gracefully and meets him in the centre of the open room. She presents her wand and he takes it reverently.
“Oh stop it, you two,” Hermione tuts. “Anyway, I wanted to say thank you again for your help with the Society.”
He gets up, puts his book down, and meanders over to lean on the back of the sofa she’s sitting on. He forces himself to calm down, but his heart hasn’t even stopped its percussion solo from two minutes ago.
“I didn’t know you were bringing her,” he says. “The champions aren’t supposed to know about this, and she’s bound to tell Delacour, isn’t she?”
“Don’t worry Potter, we have tissues!” someone shouts. He forces himself to swallow the last of his beans.
Harry himself gets more homemade mince pies than he can eat and a wonderfully green jumper from Mrs Weasley, this one with a large picture of a dragon; Charlie’s already told her all about the horntail, then. His aunt and uncle send him a single tissue; an all-time low, and possibly punishment for Fred and George’s Ton-Tongue Toffee trick.
Ron looks between Blaise’s proffered arm and his face and swallows again. He nods, and very cautiously tucks his hand into Blaise’s elbow. Harry can’t help the ridiculous grin that forces its way through. It probably makes him look like a lunatic, but Parvati is too busy giggling at Ron to notice. Blaise looks very pleased with himself, and Harry gets the impression that Ron is in good hands.
“Antidotes!” Snape announces. “You should all have found your recipes by now. You shall brew them in this lesson and then I shall be selecting someone on whom to test them.”
“Brilliant! Well done!” Ron cheers. He’s lucky that both Malfoy and Hermione have been persistent in learning sound-cancelling charms.
Flitwick congratulates Harry in Charms, much to his embarrassment when all of Slytherin roll their eyes and Gryffindor give him yet another round of applause. Snape sneers at him over his cauldron in Potions, no doubt ready to murder him at any point. It seems ages before the end of class, but when Neville manages another more than acceptable brew, all of their moods are bolstered near beyond belief. Snape doesn’t even growl when they accidentally slam the door against the wall on their way out.
A man with a large, slightly-smoking camera is skulking off to the side, watching Fleur and trying to pretend he isn’t.
Down the castle steps and into the cold, crisp night they go. The earlier fog has blown over, and the moon is sharp and clear in the sky. Several hundred students shuffle amongst themselves, shivering with excitement and anticipation.
She walks towards Dumbledore with a graceful smile, extending a hand laden with glittering jewellery.
“Oh! If the dragons aren’t going to be set free on the grounds, then wouldn’t it be best to take that advantage while we can?” Ron says. “These things are huge, if Harry, Malfoy and my brother are to be believed, so it probably wouldn’t be great to be stuck on the ground anyway. If we play to our strengths, then one of Harry’s most outstanding is his flying; it’s probably his best, actually, he’s incredible.
Finally she roars, leaping and clawing her way towards him. He grips his broom desperately, zig zagging away, and sprints towards the nest.
She smiles and takes a goblet from him. “It’s all right. I like this song though, are you sure you won’t ask me to dance?”
“You’re always hungry,” Hermione sniffs. She sends a red spark into the air, and very far away, Neville sticks his hand out of the window and probably gives them a thumbs-up.
“Harry Potter,” says Harry. Fleur disentangles herself from Malfoy to shake each of their hands. He looks satisfyingly put-out.
Theodore Nott, in very tight black muggle jeans and shirt, is leaning on the brickwork outside the Slytherin common room looking thoroughly bored. They take off the cloak a few feet away just to see him jump, and grin when he rolls his eyes at the stickers on their faces.
“Yes, I agree.” He flips to a page Harry could probably visualise in his nightmares. “Potter, read this paragraph, and then read it aloud for us, will you? Don’t worry about the talking part, just make sure you think the words through.”
“Fred saw Hermione sneaking away and thought we should follow,” Ron whispers. Harry almost laughs. Just like first year all over again.
“I shall be delighted to hear the reason behind the rudeness, but another time. The Weighing of the Wands is about to begin, as Mr Diggory has said, and we must be along.”
“Oh, go on then!” he yells back, making a face to complement his innuendo. George scrambles over and waggles the cracker in his face, and even though it looks just like all the rest, Harry holds it right at the end of his reach.
“Accio European dragon book!” he cries again, flicking his wand with more force. The book, stubbornly, does not move.
“Snape’s a right bastard, isn’t he?” Ron says, the Saturday before the end of term. “Setting us a test right before we break up—on antidotes! I hope he doesn’t bloody well want to poison us while he’s at it.”
It's a much more convincing argument to Harry when Malfoy is also sucking on his neck. Harry threads his hands into Malfoy's—extremely soft—hair to keep Malfoy's mouth at his neck and Malfoy is very obliging.
Draco knew that he ought to scold Harry for his teasing, but his defences were down. He didn’t want to make small talk, or watch bizarre films that he couldn’t follow any more. Draco felt the tug of Harry’s magic, almost imperceivable, and he leant in, kissing Harry in lieu of a reply.
, or whether the magical folk of Britain were just more forgiving than he’d ever expected. Either way, Draco felt humbled.
It was a stuffy, airless September afternoon when Greg returned from his long sojourn by the seaside. Draco was more pleased at the prospect of seeing his mate stepping through the Floo than he would have cared to admit aloud.
"Retribution. We're going to duel to the death, presumably mine since there's still a trace on my wand."
Escarole is lettuce's bitter cousin, which should be unappetizing, especially because it's been wilted and Harry usually hates hot lettuce—too slimy and rather too lettucey as well—but Malfoy's sprinkled it with parmesan and seasoned it somehow—"that would be salt and pepper, you poor soul"—and Harry is rather enjoying his plate of mashed broad beans and wilted bitter lettuce.
Draco lifted his bag onto his shoulders. “My mother and friend are convinced I’m having a girl,” Draco replied, laughing. “I’ve told both to stop prophesying. I believe my mother just covets a granddaughter.”
Around dinner time Harry tries to shake Malfoy awake but his eyelids don't even flutter. Malfoy is even paler than usual, and the tip of his nose and fingers are blue. Harry's heart skips a beat and he tries again, lifting Malfoy's torso but his head just lolls back and forth disturbingly. Then Harry's crisis training kicks in and everything narrows to the series of tasks he must perform: he Summons his wand, levitates Malfoy and flat out runs through the corridors of the Manor to get outside to Apparate.
. Draco shook his head. “What happens next?” he asked. He directed the question at Greg but really, he was asking himself. “What do I do now?”
Draco really hadn’t meant to kiss Harry, and now, looking into the other wizard’s wide green eyes, Draco wanted to curse the fool he'd been only one minute before. Draco wished for Merlin to strike him down where he sat, or for Potter to
Draco very soon realised that Harry hadn’t been joking when he’d stated The ‘Elfy Bakery would get sick of the sight of him.
As soon as Hermione was close by, Draco could see that the younger witch was truly anguished. The colour was high in her cheeks, and her eyes were set and angry. Draco braced himself for the verbal laceration that he assumed was sure to follow.
Harry leans up to meet him and then hears a soft gasp and pulls back. There's a gray-haired witch in a bright purple hat watching them avidly, mouth open. Harry waves awkwardly. "Er… hi," he says. The witch closes her mouth at Harry's words and hurries into the nearest aisle. Harry turns to look at Malfoy again. "I'll bet you ten Galleons we're on the front page of the
Today she wore sky-blue formal robes, her hair was tied back in a loose chignon, and Draco inhaled the familiar scent of her floral perfume. Mother led Draco to the settee beside the French doors, and bade him sit beside her.
Draco sets the glasses on the edge of the bath and bowl on the table and starts stripping carefully. Harry feels like maybe this moment is too much — not only seeing Draco Malfoy naked without him knowing, but this intimate moment between Draco and the Other Harry.
His memories of visiting there as a tiny child were blurred and fragmentary, coloured by the numbing fear that he’d felt for his Great Aunt Walburga. The idea of his making any noise had been intolerable, and she’d told Draco that he’d feel the sharp edge of her magic if he fussed. After that, Draco hadn’t really dared to look up from the floor. All Draco could remember from Grimmauld had been austere tapestries, screeching portraits, and dark corners. Now though, everything was different. Now, Grimmauld looked a pleasant, homely place.
Looking at his co-parent, Draco tried to make out if the other wizard was dissembling but Harry didn’t look like he was fibbing. Harry’s face was as open and as honest as always.
He decided to send Elianna back without a reply. Whatever game Harry was playing, Draco wanted no part in it.
“Merlin,” she said, spelling her tape to fly around his middle, and take his width, “what a splendid bump you’ve got already! How many weeks along are you?”
Get up, and have a glass of water. That was all he needed. Sliding down from his mattress, Draco padded towards the bathroom, but only got as far as the landing. The little wriggle changed then, changed into something that felt like a Cramping Jinx squashing all of the muscles in his lower belly, and fuck but it
Yip scrambles out of Harry's arms to bound after Malfoy, once again running circles around Malfoy as he walks, Malfoy's fancy shoes making echoing clicks on his fancy marble floors.
It's not just the sweatpants that's changed. Malfoy's hair is much longer, down to his shoulders, but instead of making him look stiff and austere like Lucius, he looks more like Narcissa, sort of feminine… it almost suits him, Harry thinks. Then he realizes he's thinking about Malfoy's hair and shakes his head to clear it. Just because Harry's only been around grizzled middle-aged Aurors and Ron since he started thinking about men doesn't mean he has to notice the first boy he sees, especially since that boy is Malfoy.
He breaks off several leaves of fresh basil he gathers from a pot on the windowsill into the sauce, and turns to Malfoy with a, “What have we got, then?”
Harry was quoted as saying in the front-page article. He and Cuffe must’ve enjoyed a long conversation.
thought come from? – but Draco smoothed out the quilt cover anyway. It was ridiculous to feel sentimental about Harry and his night together, but a silly part of Draco couldn’t seem to help it. They’d made a baby, so that made the memory of it sacred, surely? Bloody
Malfoy darts inside the main doors which open for him, calling out, "I wouldn't dawdle if I were you, the peafowl are quite nasty when denied entrance."
On Sunday they get another visitor. Luna Lovegood floats into Malfoy's hospital room, looking round with curiosity like she's in a museum.
Malfoy tips the chopped garlic, olives, capers and parsley into the pan which hisses and sputters as it hits the hot oil. The oil pops and burns the back of Malfoy's hand. He swears and sucks on the spot.
"It's nutty and a little sandy. It's a beautiful color. It's more nutritious than white flour and it tastes more complex and interesting."
“Oh, my sweet boy,” Narcissa said, sitting back in her chair. She sipped her wine, and Draco thought she was musing upon his words. “You’ve fallen in love with him, haven’t you? My poor, lovely darling. How long have you known?”
then, they've hardly written anything about all the work Harry's been doing, fascinated as they are with who Harry's dating. I'm sure it's difficult recovering from being a fascist state propaganda machine, but I would think they'd write something about rounding up the last Death Eaters. You really should subscribe to the
He looks at his dirty old kitchen with new eyes, now. He sees possibility. He sees a world in which Draco Malfoy smiles at him as if the sun rises and lies with Harry, a world in which he makes dinners with the Wireless on.
“Your next appointment is your official halfway point,” Hayes answered, closing Draco’s file, “and that means that you’ve got a decision to make before I see you next. Have you thought yet about finding out the baby’s gender?”
Harry might walk out and refuse to speak to him again. He might call Draco a fantasist or a fool, or say that a Malfoy with a Dark Mark wasn’t a fit parent for anyone. Maybe Harry would demand proof or refuse to believe that the baby was his. A heavy feeling washed through him. Maybe Harry would try to take their baby once they were born.
Draco had found himself weeping at the sight of his Mother’s rose garden – he’d played there when he was little – and he’d sobbed at the sight of his body after a shower. At nineteen weeks his belly was as round as a cauldron, and Draco had decided there and then that nobody (namely Potter) would ever fancy him, not ever again.
“And that is brilliant to hear,” Hayes answered. “As I’ve said to both of you gentlemen before, there isn’t a right or a wrong way to become parents, and all family shapes are equally valid. All that matters is that your baby comes first, and that is undeniably the case with the pair of you.” She paused, and searched through her sheaf, pulling out a parchment sheet with a triumphant flourish. “You’ll both be extremely happy to know that I’ve received the results of the tests that I performed on Harry. The pair of you have uncommonly strong magical signatures gentlemen, and ones which compliment each other very well. Basically,” she said, pushing the parchment over towards them both, “your little witch or wizard is likely destined to be a very powerful wix one day in the very near future.”
"Well just skip the rock cakes," Harry says, quite reasonably he thinks, looking around at all the food Malfoy has prepared, but Malfoy's face crumples.
“I certainly have,” Harry answered, leaning down to press a kiss onto Molly’s forehead. “I told him about your cooking,” he flirted shamelessly, “and then there wasn’t any keeping him away. Molly, I’d love for you to meet Draco. Draco, this is Molly. She’s the only mum that I’ve ever known.”
The red snapper is perfectly cooked, with a beautiful char on each side. And while Harry wouldn't go so far as to say oranges and olives together are "a revelation" he does have to admit they're quite good.
Malfoy gathers a few things from the cold cupboard and starts some butter sizzling in a pan, his back turned to Harry. He's taller than Harry remembers, and thinner, though it's perhaps because Harry's only ever seen Malfoy in Hogwarts robes, not the sweater and—sweatpants?—he's wearing now.
Harry seemed to freeze in place, and then, rapidly, he pulled away, his green eyes wide with wonder as he stumbled to his feet.
Those three little words would roll from his tongue like Veritaserum, and then he’d never be able to stop saying it, not for the rest of his days. Draco tried to hide his face in Harry’s neck, tried to disappear, but Harry didn’t let him. Instead, Harry pulled him back, and held him still.
Malfoy takes in the news with a blank face, still reading the parchment of discharge instructions. Ron clears his throat and Malfoy looks up.
Harry pulls over a chair for her and listens to a conversation about hanged men and knights and numbers and pentacles with confusion until Malfoy, perhaps seeing Harry's lost expression, says to Harry, "Tarot," before resuming with Luna. Harry still can't follow the conversation because he knows nothing about hermits, but he entertains himself imagining the absolute conniption Hermione would have if present.
That wasn’t what Draco wanted, not by a long shot. This was their new beginning, after all, and it wouldn’t work unless he, and Harry, both let themselves believe in it. He wasn’t there to play housemates, or formal co-fathers. “I want this to be
Perhaps everything wouldn’t be as dreadful as he’d feared. He was hardly the first wizard in the world to have a baby, and the commotion would hardly last long. With a bit of luck, Louis St Clare would do something stupid and knock him off the front page entirely.
Harry looked unsure, so Draco took his hand and placed it back where it had sat a minute before. Harry swallowed, and rested his palm on the curve. Magic coursed from him, and Draco felt the deep devotion and warmth of the other man deep inside his bones. Harry loved their baby already, there wasn’t a single shadow of a doubt.
"Sometimes my mother would bring almond croissants to my bedroom for breakfast on Sundays. Just her and me."
Which meant that, if the Curse-Breaking team was right about what the curse on the trunk entailed, Harry was somewhere in the future, the past or in a different timeline where a totally different Harry lives. Or doesn’t live. Merlin knows whose house this actually is. This is just what Harry needs on a Tuesday evening.
“None of that matters,” Harry said, sounding sure of himself. “None of it at all. I’ve thought about nothing else since Café Quendryth. I want to be a father to our child. I don’t give a stuff about the
Draco didn’t think that anything was going to be alright, not for a very long time. He was pregnant. He didn’t know anything about babies, and yet here he was, with one growing inside of him.
In reality, Draco had missed Mother terribly and he’d known she felt the same. It might have been different if he’d had younger siblings, but even though his parents had tried – an heir and a spare was
"Ah! Look at this one!" Malfoy starts cackling, "The flexing muscles! I can't even!" he wheezes out between bouts of laughter.
The walls were light, covered in a wash of creamy paint. The Muggle television was stupidly vast, and the settee in front of it was ludicrously squashy. It was covered in patchwork blankets of a similar design to those he’d seen on the Weasley bedcovers, and there were books and magazines and knick-knacks everywhere.
being there anymore? That idea was more terrifying than carrying his baby to term. It was time to step up to his decision.
Harry can't help the smile. He hates demonstrative pity about his upbringing, or lack thereof more like. He doesn't want pity. He just wants to be able to talk about his life without inducing tears in his listener.
He rolls the dough carefully and cuts it into generous rolls, happy with the spiral, and leaves the buns to proof for another hour or so. The sun is coming up now and Draco is contemplating a second cup of coffee. And maybe he should make some bacon to go with the cinnamon rolls.
Harry doesn’t dare get closer from his corner, afraid he’ll be caught, so he can’t quite catch all the pages they stop at and the things they point at, but an unusual silver vase, an emerald green velvet chaise lounge, and a mid-century bed are definitely mentioned.
Draco winced. He couldn’t tell Hayes to mind her own business. This was her job. “I haven’t told him yet either,” he answered. “That is- well- We’re not a couple. It was a one-time thing, and he told me he’s not looking for anything serious.”
Leading the way, exactly as Harry had requested, Draco couldn’t resist giving his hips a wriggle; tonight, he felt seductive and shameless. In only minutes Draco was pushing open the door of his bedroom,
Malfoy smiles too. "Yes, alright. I want to try Muggle sushi. Can we do Muggle sushi? I brought paper money."
Narcissa rose from her seat as Draco entered, and he greeted her with a kiss to the cheek as was his custom. Draco felt the warmth of her magic and love as she took his hand in her own. Mother had flourished in the years since the war, and looked more youthful than her forty-nine years.
Humming, Draco broke a couple of eggs into a pan, and set them frying with a tap of his wand. Feeling chipper and still rather randy from the night before, he switched on the wireless. Swaying his hips to the latest Weird Sisters’s song, Draco wondered whether Harry would wake soon, and what he’d say once he did.
“Harry kept smiling,” Arthur cut in, absentmindedly breaking his shortbread in half, little pieces of it skittering all over the plate. “Did his rehabilitation. Got back in the saddle; put on a brave face. Inside it was a different tale. It was as if some part of Harry that had survived the war, survived Voldemort had finally broken. The light dulled, and Molly and I? Well, we imagined that we’d lost our Harry forever. But that joy, that joie de vivre? It’s coming back. Ron agrees. Harry is brighter. Happier. He loves you,” Arthur repeated, every bit as sedately as if he were talking about the weather. “The feelings are there. He simply needs time to process them. Time to get used to the idea.”
"I was hoping I'd see you," he says in that strong commanding voice that led a rebellion. Harry'd be intimidated if he didn't also remember Neville crying over his toad.
Ron walks out of the hallway shirtless and scratching his stomach. He's got obvious sex hair and as he walks to the fridge for a butterbeer Harry can see he's got scratch marks down his back.
He sat on the settee, too keyed up to read his novel, and looked around. There were a dozen photos above the mantelpiece, and Draco gazed at them, drawing comfort from the familiar faces.
Harry and Malfoy end up at the same wizarding department store as before, which has about a million floors according to the buttons in the elevator. Malfoy presses the button for "Magically Manipulated Fibers for All Occasions."
Harry gave him a curious look. He took a sip of his drink before placing it back on the table with a small click. Draco watched as he slid his arms out of his jacket and hung it on the back of his chair. “
he finds in Malfoy's study. Malfoy sleeps the whole day through, not even touching the soup, which is probably a good thing because he'd likely never let Harry hear the end of it for serving him tinned soup.
Harry, entire Saviour and general golden boy, came bounding up the stairs a moment later. As always Harry was perfectly in character: his green eyes were wide, and he appeared dreadfully flustered. “Whatever’s wrong?” Harry asked, casting his eyes everywhere around the room, searching for a problem to be solved. “Is something wrong with the baby? Do we need to Floo to St Mungo’s?”
“Thank you,” Harry said. “Thank you for letting me be a part of this. It’s overwhelming, isn’t it? That this is our baby and that they’re growing inside of you right now. Feels like the most powerful magic in the world.”
"What's this on top," Harry says, swiping his finger through the creamy white frosting on the cinnamon roll and licking it.
"A spell does not know the weight of your egg whites, it can't tell what temperature they're at, or when to add the cream of tartar, a spell doesn't know the difference between soft and hard peaks, Potter. It's brainless, lacking both finesse and joy."
"They're lovely. All my dishes are spelled to wash themselves but I can't do the activation spell until my probation is over," Malfoy says forlornly. Then, his eyes light up as he says, "But you could do it."
"And then what? Let's say I dole out apologies to half the wizarding world, let's say there's even a single person who actually thinks the word 'sorry' makes it better. Then what? Have I 'taken responsibility' then?"
As he pulled the sheets over him, Draco heard the lyrics to that stupid, asinine song, over and over, a broken spell in his brain.
“When d’you think we should start telling people?” Harry asked. “Ron and ‘Mione already think we’re an item… Reckon that I’m sneaking off for a bit of afternoon delight when I Floo over to yours. Ron even asked when we were going to announce our sickly-sweet coupledom to the world.”
he kissed back? Hermione said it was more of a snog so he must have kissed back a little, unless Harry mauled Malfoy with his tongue. And what was Malfoy thinking when he kissed Harry back? Was it the confusion Harry feels?
The gate swings open as they approach and Malfoy starts shouting something of which Harry only catches the word "gate" in between the yaps and shrill cries of the peacocks now waddling with a purpose toward Harry like absurd guard dogs and Harry's too startled by the beady red eyes of the advancing peacocks to pay much attention to Malfoy's continued shouting, snatching his wand from his pocket and training it on the peacocks only to freeze when he realizes he has no idea what spell to use on
He feels a little dazed and he keeps looking up at Malfoy, at his eyelashes, at his cheeks, still rosy from the cold, his chin which is just as pointy as Harry remembers, but softened by the fall of his shoulder length hair.
had been cast and Draco soon understood why. The swirls coalesced into the picture-perfect shape of their baby.
Harry has his sodding toast. He plugs his ears as he takes his last bite and Ron and Hermione both start talking and runs to the bathroom to escape them. Harry takes a shower resolutely not thinking about Malfoy or kissing or anything else but getting the sweat-soaked hangover feeling off his skin.
Greg was the perfect distraction from his melancholy. He bounded through the Floo, his brown hair golden from the sunshine, and his face patterned with a thousand freckles. He’d put on some off-season weight, but still had his powerful Beater’s build and he grabbed hold of Draco, pulling him into a bearhug. Draco felt wayward tears threaten to spill, but his steely self-discipline kept them at bay. That was a good thing. Goyle would likely have Disapparated on the spot, had Draco started weeping.
"It's rough sometimes, mostly I wish there weren't so many late nights. But yeah, I do like it. Feels good to help. Feels important."
In the afternoon Malfoy gets an owl and starts arranging a full tea service. All the sandwiches and scones and tiny Lemon Cranberry Tart Tarts get set on tiered trays and Malfoy stands looking round the kitchen for a moment with his pleased smile until he catches on one last open cookbook.
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” she said, “and you too, Draco. I know we’ve had our issues in the past but nobody deserves this… Your private lives, spread all over the cover! I wasn’t sure if you’d know yet. I know you don’t get newspapers delivered, Harry, but- “
Images of the night before danced through Draco’s head. The pair of them sharing fiery kisses on his settee, Harry a hot, solid weight pressing him into the material. Their bodies entwined upon the bed, tangled, sweaty and sticky with ejaculate. They’d had a good time, hadn’t they? Enjoyed each other’s company and enjoyed the sweet relief of sex into the bargain. Draco didn’t believe he’d been taken advantage of, not in the slightest. “What are you talking about?” Draco asked, baffled. “Last night was brilliant.”
The first two facts weren’t any kind of surprise. Harry could always be relied upon for booze and laughter, and the dark-haired wizard stayed at Draco’s Half-Moon Place home on a regular basis. Whenever Draco needed cheering up, Harry was the first person that Draco Firecalled. The third fact was a good deal more surprising. Harry hadn’t ever made a pass at him, or even hinted that he’d like the two of them to be more than good friends before their lips had met only minutes before.
There wasn’t anything else that either Braithwaite or Draco needed to say. The Mediwix assured him that he’d owl St Mungo’s that afternoon, and that he could expect an appointment within the week. The three of them stood, and Braithwaite looked between Goyle and he. “You did the right thing,” the Mediwix said, putting out his hand for Draco to shake. “Many wizards avoid the obvious conclusion for far too long. There’s still a bit of a stigma, isn’t there, amongst professional sportsmen? You seem like a solid couple and- “
Harry shrugs. He's never really thought about whether or not he enjoys helping. He's always just done it, first because it was demanded of him and then, well, Harry supposes just out of habit. "I don't really," he says, and it feels good to tell the truth.
“Schoolwork wasn’t high on my agenda,” Harry answered, light and easy. “Didn’t seem all that important. Not the way you are.” He paused speaking, fingers scorching on Draco’s skin. “Braxton-hicks,” Harry repeated, sounding certain. “That’s all it was, and they’ve stopped now. Are you feeling calmer?”
Harry doesn’t feel guilt about it — he knows he’s not learning anything about his future that he shouldn’t. In his world, there isn’t any chance that he’d ever call Draco Malfoy “babe” and even less chance that Draco Malfoy would call him ‘love’ and ‘sweetheart’ like he does here. His eyes roam over the two shapes under the duvet, unable to figure out where one ends and the other starts.
Instead, Harry eases back into Malfoy's side with his cup of tea. It's a fancy spiced chai tea Malfoy got him and it's delicious with milk and sugar. It's hard to feel guilty about not participating more, with his warm drink in his hands and Malfoy holding him, rubbing small circles over his ribs. It's hard to feel anything but comfort.
“It is what it is,” Harry answered, the two of them stepping towards the Diagon Floo entrance in the St Mungo’s Atrium. “I’m not ashamed to have made a baby with you, Draco, and I’m not about to deny their existence, not even for a day. People aren’t stupid. They’ll know you didn’t make your baby all by yourself. I mean, yes, we might be wizards but we can’t change the fundamental tenets of magic-”
That would have been cliché and formula with any other wizard, but somehow the words seemed to suit Harry. Draco liked how good they sounded in Harry’s lovely deep voice, directed solely at him. Harry was beside his side in a flash, and the two of them linked their fingers.
“You told me to tell him about my being pregnant,” Draco replied, his voice posh and prickly. “So, I took your advice. Ergo, Potter knows he's going to be a father and so he wants to be involved. He’s been coming to St Mungo’s with me. Taking me shopping. We even had dinner with the Weasleys at their Burrow a couple of weeks ago. Place was an utter labyrinth of rooms but the food was nice… And Harry’s been good to me,” Draco finished, his description lame in comparison to how supportive Harry had been. “Nothing is too much trouble.”
Luna is quiet for a bit, brushing her fingertips over the rose petals as she walks. Harry glances back up at Malfoy but he's still a ways ahead of them on the path. The peacocks have wandered off but the giant cats are still at his heels and Harry watches as he bends down to pat one without breaking step. He looks so… human.
to open the door to the back garden, “but I was never allowed out here. Walburga was terrified of catching Muggle illnesses and she barely left the house. Oh, Harry,” he said, taking in a breath as he took in the breath of the space outside, “it’s fantastic.”
Harry mixes and then Malfoy dips a spoon in to taste a bit. He frowns and then hands the spoon to Harry who takes it without thinking and tastes it as well. The gherkins, or maybe the mustard, give the egg salad a tangy lightness. Harry thinks it's delicious but he doesn't say so, handing the spoon back to Malfoy.
He opens his eyes back up to Draco holding both of Other Harry’s hands to his face, slowly placing a kiss on each of his fingers, pinky to thumb on the left and thumb to pinky on the right. Harry thinks he is blushing, but doesn’t dare brings his hands to his face to check the heat on his cheeks.
having a baby,” Harry said, carding his fingers through her hair, “and you’re a clever little girl. The baby will come in December, not long before Santa Claus. The lady in the paper was wrong though. We aren’t boyfriends. We’re just very good friends that are having a baby together.”
He gave the smart-suited elf waiter an order for a chamomile tea and a coffee and rearranged the silk serviette in front of him, all the time keeping his eyes on the door in case Harry appeared through it. Café Quendryth had been a wizarding institution for over a century, and it probably hadn’t changed much over that time. It looked identical to the occasions when Draco had visited with his mother as a young child. Narcissa had much preferred Quendryth’s sedate, dignified atmosphere to the more plebeian Fortescue’s around the corner.
"D'you think a second year shouting 'you'll be next Mudbloods' actually wants their classmates dead? He probably thought he did and then the war. He saw what that actually meant. If anything could change a person's mind completely it'd be seeing the horrible shite we saw during the war."
“While on the subject of leaning on people. Talk to Ron and Hermione. Stop saying no to dinners and drinks. Go Muggle, if you need to avoid the press. Stop closing yourself off to the world just because you don’t think you’re worthy. Trust your friends. They need you just as much.”
Malfoy starts the oven and then begins chopping the potatoes into large chunks. He's wearing his sweatpants and button up combination again today which Harry is starting to find endearing, god help him.
Mille and Greg both laughed at that, because it was true. Pansy, always a mistress of reinvention, had styled herself as a paragon of saintly motherhood since giving birth to Cygnus six months before. She’d be entirely cross with Draco for about three seconds, before she decided it was the best news that she’d ever heard. Millie gave Draco a hug, and kissed his cheek.
the magazine and it landed in his hands. “I had the chicken,” he answered, opening the magazine on his lap. “It tasted okay to me. Maybe it was the sautéed potato?”
Greg rolled his eyes and stepped into the fireplace. “Then be careful,” Goyle finished, before disappearing into the flames.
“That’s pure-blood culture,” Draco replied, winding his way through the mid-afternoon crowds. “What’s the Black family motto, embroidered into the enormous family tree that hangs in your home?
Harry never wants it to stop. Despite his guilt, despite the fact he desperately wants to whip his cock out and wank to the scene before him and just can’t bring himself to, Harry never wants this to end.
Everyone exclaims over the cupcakes as they arrive. Strangely, as Harry repeats many times that Malfoy brought them, Malfoy doesn't preen but progressively shrinks back into the corner by the cold cupboard. It isn't until Luna arrives, delighted with the platter of vegan chocolate cupcakes, that Malfoy even makes eye contact with anyone. He's certainly not the Malfoy Harry remembers from school, acting out exaggerated swooning fits for the whole of the Slytherin table, encore after encore.
"These—" Malfoy says, pointing to purple iced cupcakes with a plant sprig, "are earl gray cupcakes with lavender swiss meringue buttercream. And these," he says, pointing to pink cupcakes topped with raspberries and pink sprinkles, "are rose and pistachio with raspberry swiss meringue buttercream." Malfoy moves to the other side of the table, "These are coffee cupcakes with a passionfruit curd filling and chocolate biscuit crumbles."
“Merlin,” Draco muttered, as Harry knocked on the door, “I’ve got Wrackspurts in my belly! This is more nerve-wracking than a bloody cup final.”
Harry didn’t share his reticence. The other wizard centered in on the most expensive model, and stoked his fingers across the level burlwood grain. Dozens of protective runes were carved into the wood, and Draco spotted the symbols for safety, love, and protection. It was a stately, imposing item, and the saleswizard stepped forward, his eyes flicking, ever so quickly to Draco’s middle. If he recognised Harry – and of course he did, Harry was the most famous wizard in England – he was too professional to acknowledge it. “That’s a very lovely model,” he told them both, his voice smooth and convincing. “Part of our premier range. A real heirloom item. Enchanted with a dozen spells to ensure that your baby will sleep comfortably and have happy dreams. We’ll deliver of course.”
Malfoy makes Harry hold his basket while he fills it with various-sized amber bottles with exorbitant prices per pound that Harry is pretty sure Malfoy doesn't even
Harry didn’t reply to his apology. All he did was sit there, staring intently at Draco, scratching the scruffy shadow of stubble on his chin. Draco tried his best to salvage his pride. “Go home,” Draco urged. “Please.”
. It would have been easy to sit there, in Harry’s company, and let the morning drift away, but there were questions that still needed to be asked.
"No! No, nothing like that. Threats sometimes. Suffice to say I felt it was safer to be a little less 'dramatic'."
Malfoy adds the kale to the pan and stirs everything together as the kale wilts. Harry watches, annoyed that Malfoy seems fine, not twisted up with anger and confusion like Harry is. Malfoy takes the pan off the hob and spoons up a bit of the mixture, blowing on it before tasting it and giving a satisfied little hum. "Are you still helping or would you rather sulk?"
Malfoy smiles, pink-cheeked, but can't resist Harry's change of subject. He'd swallow glass before missing an opportunity to talk about how good his cooking is. "There's no ricotta. People always put ricotta and it always gets dried out in the oven. I use a bechamel sauce."
He didn’t seem to, though. The other wizard got to his feet. He picked up the box of tissues that Draco kept on the sideboard, and then offered it to him. Draco pulled a few from the box, and he gave his face a wipe.
All in all, Draco couldn’t fault Harry. In the fourteen days since they’d brokered their peace, the two of them had fallen into a routine, and had been spending quite a bit of time together. Harry’s words – that he wanted to be at Draco’s side – hadn’t been a fib.
. This Other Harry really does look happier. The word that comes to his mind is “shinier,” almost as if he’s glowing. Harry makes a mental note to start moisturising, like Hermione has been telling him to for ages.
Sitting down beside him, Harry took his hand and Draco ventured to shoot a quick glance in his direction. To Draco’s surprise, the other wizard didn’t look perplexed or amused. Harry only looked kind, and that had the disastrous effect of making him cry harder.
That hadn’t been the answer Draco had expected. Truth was, Draco felt shamefaced about the way that he’d treated Harry’s friends back when they’d all been Hogwarts students, and he often tried to swerve the conversation away whenever the subject of them came up. His bullying, arsehole behaviour had been a combination of low self-esteem, parroting his father’s vile opinions and a crippling jealousy of the Gryffindor trio’s close friendship.
In his mind’s eye, Draco could see Harry frantically Firecalling Granger, wondering what Draco wanted, and how he could possibly get out of it. Maybe he’d pretend he was poorly. Draco snorted at that. More likely he had a hot date that afternoon with some good-looking hunk.
Harry ate for a while before replying. “Sorry,” he answered. “I've been fussing terribly this week, haven’t I? That’s me all over. Practical and passionate. Sending those owls. Buying that baby book. I came on a bit strong, didn’t I?”
“My apologies for wasting your time,” Draco answered, leaning wearily against the countertop. He let his hand come to rest on top of his bump. “I had such good intentions of putting in an offer today,” he continued, Harry coming to stand beside him. “And it isn’t anything to do with the houses that you’ve shown me. All three of them have been stunning… I don’t know. Maybe I’m not sure what I’m looking for.”
Harry wakes up thinking about Malfoy. About his soft hair and the tender way he touches Harry and his refusal to suffer. If Harry's honest, and he can be within his own head, he finds that refusal a little attractive. Malfoy says he won't prove that he's sorry through suffering. That people don't really want apologies, they want retribution. That he won't bend to other people's expectations of remorse. And something about Malfoy's defiant joy catches Harry. He wants it for himself. Increasingly, he wants it for Malfoy too.
Draco stumbled over his answer. “Nothing specific,” he said, his eyes flicking to Harry’s face. The other wizard was watching him intently, and Draco spoke his answer to him, rather than the Estate Agent. “Just a feeling. I know already that I won’t be happy here. It’s as if the place is already filled with bad memories, and doesn’t our baby deserve better than that?”
The food was stodgy, filling and entirely delicious, and conversation ceased entirely while the three of them were eating. Greg
“Bloody hell,” Harry swore, shaking his head. He looked absolutely ashamed. “I’m so sorry, Draco… Shit. I’m sorry. It said in my book that the
Braithwaite was as good as his word. After two days of hiding at home, and ignoring the rest of the world, an owl arrived, tapping on Draco’s kitchen window.
"Yes, blindingly beautiful, I'm glad you agree. Look at these, they're red," Malfoy says, holding up a bowl. "Gryffindors like red, I'm sure of it."
As they near the gazebo the cats come prancing out to greet Hagrid, the peacocks following not far behind and to start there's a lot of "Who's a good boying" and Luna's laughter as she tosses sunflower seeds to the peacocks and Yip runs in circles snatching them from under their beaks.
Harry hasn't taken to political reform the way Ron and Hermione have. They seem to have endless energy for compiling evidence against Umbridge, giving interviews in support of legislation and reforms, working to replace Professor Binns with a competent teacher and updating the Hogwarts history curriculum. Harry knows he should do those things, Hermione's talked to him a thousand times about the weight of his name and all the influence it carries, but when Harry thinks about doing those things he feels a bone-deep weariness.
Harry bends over, hands on his knees, adrenaline coursing through him, his heartbeat in his ears and shouts, "What the fuck?"
Malfoy stretches out his arms to Harry and Harry goes unthinkingly. "Look at this rat's nest," Malfoy says, running his fingers through Harry's hair. "It's even worse than usual."
Draco watched as Harry gave Molly a hug, squeezing Harry like he was still a small boy rather than a well-built sportsman of twenty-three. The witch’s eyes were sparkly, and she seemed delighted by Harry’s presence. “It’s been much too long,” she scolded.
He practically holds his breath until he gets outside, where Malfoy is waiting for him on the pavement. They walk to Harry's flat, both of them holding bunches of flowers instead of each other's hands. As Harry opens the door to the flat Malfoy says, "I think we need biscuits."
"You think you know about Muggle things. If you actually went to a Tesco you would be loudly and pretentiously confused." Harry puts on a posh accent and continues, "Potter, why are all these fruits wrapped in plastic? Potter, look at all these premade biscuits. I suppose without magic Muggles don't have the time to make their own artisanal biscuits. Potter, look, this milk comes in a paper carton, how bizarre."
"I'm glad you apologized to Neville," Harry says. "I don't know what to think about you doing it for me."
Moisturiser or not, Harry focuses back on the conversation, silently following Other Harry and Malfoy to the kitchen.
Draco made the decision to head back home to Half-Moon Place. What he really needed was a few days away from teammates, away from friends, and away from the ever-present risk of running into Harry Potter. The other wizard was a hard-working man – the under-21s had mounted a superb Quidditch season – but Harry was often to be seen in the canteen, or out on the Pitch, and Draco didn’t trust himself around him.
Of all the reactions possible, Draco hadn’t expected such tenderness from his mother. He seized her hand as she leant forwards, and knitted their slender fingers together. “But you suspected before?” Draco asked, wondering whether his mother was part-seer. “I’ve hardly told anyone. Only Greg, Millie and… I’ve told the other father too. He knows.”
"Actually it was Draco. We weren't sure at first, because of all the damage Voldemort left on the property but it's really ideal. Did you know Thestrals can digest dead plant matter?"
Harry finds Draco in the kitchen and he seems to be in an especially good mood as well, that pleased little smile of his hardly leaving his face. He asks Harry if he wants coffee and Harry declines so he makes Harry tea. Then he sets two bowls of unfamiliar yellow mush on the table.
Harry pauses, feeling like there's a right answer. And he wants to find the right answer, not because Harry's too tired to piss Malfoy off right now, but because he doesn't want to
“Hermione was overjoyed,” Harry said, finding Draco’s eyes. “She said that she thought that a baby would be the making of me.” Sitting back in his chair, Harry elaborated. “’Mione knows that I’ve always wanted a family – wanted kids of my own – but after the accident I stopped dating. She said that she’d gotten a little bit concerned that it wasn’t going to happen for me… I mean, she told me off for not carrying my own condoms, but that’s Hemione. She always needs to find something to moan at me about. Anyway, long story short, Hermione said she was pleased for me. Says she thinks I’ll be an awesome dad.” He quirked a smile in Draco’s direction. “And yeah. That meant a lot. Even when I was eleven, I respected her opinion more than any of the adults I knew.”
At that, new noise filled the room. It was a fast little pulsing; a steady whoosh-whoosh-whoosh that echoed subtly around them. Hearing it, Draco felt a small part of his stoic nature crumble forever into dust.
Harry gives a watery laugh, his eyes wet and his throat tight. As usual he's the last person who knows how he's feeling. "But—" he says, having trouble with the idea that anyone
Watercolours of magical creatures covered another wall; dragons, hippogriffs and phoenixes. Best of all, however, was the cot. If anything, it looked better than it had done in the emporium. The protective runes were carved deep into the grain of the wood, and as Draco ran his fingers over them, he felt the enchantment, protective and powerful. Molly Weasley had made a quilt, and Harry had placed it inside of the high wooden sides. It was apparent that Harry had done his very best to make everything just right for their baby, and the results were breathtaking.
“Hello my dear,” she cooed, warm and grandmotherly in a way that neither of Draco’s grandmothers had managed. “Goodness, but it’s a stiflingly hot afternoon, isn’t it? Merlin, but Cooling Charms are a wonder.” She put her quill down and focused her attention onto him. “Now, what is it I can do for you today?”
have the right to get angry anytime anyone brings up what a full-time wanker and part-time fascist you were. You don't get to go through life never owning up to that."
“Alright,” Draco agreed. “Frobisher’s, baby shopping and then dinner. Sounds like a plan.” He gave Harry a grin, and tugged him towards the Floo. “Come on, slow-worm. No time to waste.”
Draco felt a sudden wetness on his cheek, and it was only then that he realised that, quite unbeknownst to him, he had begun to cry.
Draco folded his serviette into his lap, imagining Harry sat with his friends in Fratelli’s, gossiping and laughing.
Harry took his hand as they strolled through the building and listened to the Estate Agent make her spiel. “Whitsand Bay is a charming place to grow up,” she explained. “Your baby will fall asleep to the sound of the waves, and you’ll wake to majestic sunrises. The house is equipped with the strongest of Wards, and there is a permanent Notice-Me-Not on the whole of the house so that you can freely practice magic wherever you wish in the grounds without being noticed by Muggles.”
Draco stood up. He supposed that people were staring, but he honestly didn’t care. He ignored Harry calling his name, and flinched away when the other wizard stood and tried to catch his hand.
Draco flushed pink and avoided Harry’s smug, fond face. He hadn’t even realised that the word had slipped out. He supposed there had been so much talk of daughters and little girls, that somewhere along the line he’d begun to believe it himself.
Harry made a small, surprised noise but he didn’t seem to mind Draco’s action and he kissed back, taking his time, and drawing himself in close. His embraces were soft and very sensual, not deep at all. “Is this alright?” Draco asked, pulling back, breaking their kiss.
"But you are quiet today, Harry," Mrs. Weasley says, returning to the table to clear what's left of the excellent pie.
Other Harry continues, “You know, you could stay home with me? Bedrest and all that. Anything to stop you from spending any time with that dickhead coworker of yours.”
He eventually does get out of bed. Harry doesn’t dare follow him into the shower even though there wouldn’t be anything weird about it (would there? It’s just… himself). He does follow Other Harry down to the kitchen, watches him prepare breakfast for himself and feed Petrol, after fussing with her a little, each “You’re a good girl, aren’t you?” rewarded with a loud purr. Other Harry eats a bowl of cereal with a steaming cup of tea on the side and makes what smells like the prep for a fish pie, leaving it in the fridge before heading out of the front door. Much to Harry’s disappointment, Other Harry grabs a leather jacket off the hook by the door, and Harry is still left to wonder which of them is the Healer and which is the Unspeakable.
“Circe save us from interfering mothers,” Draco said, feeling his cheeks flush at the idea of Molly and Harry having a conversation where sex was the subject, however obliquely it had been mentioned. “And yes. I think I’d like to find out. Not because of any of this pink-for-girls and blue-for-boys nonsense that all the shops seem intent on pushing. I’d just like to get to know them a bit better in the months before they arrive. Decide on a name, that sort of thing. If you’re really against it then we won’t do it. I don’t want to pressure you.”
Draco hadn’t really been here very often, simply because the further into his pregnancy Draco got, the more nauseating Floo travel was. It had simply been easier for Harry to come to him.
Twenty minutes later Malfoy walks in with a tray set with breakfast and tea and even a little vase with a flower. Harry is actually speechless. Aunt Petunia used to make up a tray with soup and tea and biscuits for Dudley when he was sick and carry it to wherever he was watching telly. It goes without saying Harry got no such treatment when he was sick. And here's Malfoy bringing Harry a breakfast tray and he isn't even sick. It's breakfast in bed just because Malfoy
Harry very nearly laughs. Weird. That’s exactly how he feels, too. He wishes he’d stayed. He wishes he could see them right now, the way Draco is no doubt holding Harry tight, or cradling his face, or caressing his hair.
Mediwitch Hayes looked at Harry, her face a perfect combination of confusion and approval. “Well that all sounds excellent,” she answered. “Wizard pregnancies are rooted in the magic of their two fathers, and it’s in the best interest of the baby that you are a strong partnership. Very few partners are so doting.”
Malfoys gathers up the last crumbs of his pie crust and wraps it up and tells Harry to put it in the cold cupboard. Harry is glad to get away from him, standing in the chilly cupboard. He feels odd. Odd and a little shaky and he can't think of a reason why he's standing in this cold cupboard hiding from Malfoy.
"Are you—? I'm sorry I think I might be having a stroke because it sounds like you're defending Malfoy."
The conversation ended on that observation. Arthur kindly asked after Draco’s mother, and his Aunty Andi while he scooped up the mug and plates, leaving Draco to sit alone with his thoughts.
a couple. We’re friends, having a baby together. A bond doesn’t have to follow a pregnancy, like night follows day.”
It seemed preposterous to Draco, and he couldn’t understand why the characters burst into song whenever they felt any kind of strong emotion. “It’s hardly realistic,” he complained, watching a man dance around with an umbrella. “I don’t think I’ll ever understand Muggles properly. This is supposed to be entertaining?”
Harry didn’t even let him finish the question. He wrapped arms tight around Draco’s waist and pulled him into a deep, fervent kiss. It didn’t take long for Harry’s hand to leave Draco’s back. They skittered around the hard lines of his hip bones and ended on the fastenings of his trousers. Draco was inordinately impressed with Harry’s speed at undoing the hooks, and decided, there and then, never to think about how the wizard had gotten so skillful in the undressing department. Harry hooked his thumb into the waistband of them, and pulled them down over his thighs.
“You're genuinely sure that you’re ready for this?” Harry asked, looking at first at Draco for conformation and then up at the rickety, tumble-down form of the Burrow stood before them. “We don’t have to do this now. We don’t have to do anything that you’re not ready for.
One word, and the two of them could have gone up the stairs, stripped off the remainder of their clothes and made love on Draco’s plushy bedcovers. Draco didn’t want to, though. They’d started like this last time, on the settee, and Draco needed their next time to be different.
"Do keep up, Potter." Perhaps a spell for repelling posh gits as well, preferably one that roughens them up a bit.
“Oh, yes,” Harry agreed, nuzzling the sensitive spot beneath Draco’s ear. “You’re right. The chicken smells good too.”
As soon as Malfoy leaves Harry starts worrying about if he sweats in his sleep and whether or not he should wear a shirt to sleep even though he usually doesn't, and are his sheets clean? He's in his pants smelling his sheets when he hears the floo. Harry throws on one of Dudley's old shirts that's still four sizes too big on him and goes out to meet Malfoy. Malfoy, who's wearing a long pink nightgown and a gray dressing gown with matching gray slippers.
"Neville helped me," Harry says, watching for Malfoy's reaction. He just yawns again, turning on his side to curl up.
Malfoy pulls out another bolt, this one with cartoon renderings of Harry holding a broom, a wand, a cauldron, an owl.
Neville sets his hands on his hips and it's then that Harry notices he's wearing a green apron with pruning shears sticking out of one pocket.
He doesn’t have long to focus on that, though, because his other self walks in after Malfoy, babbling away words Harry’s brain can’t quite catch because he’s too entranced by what he’s seeing. None of the things Harry is bewildered by are unexpected. Of course, he’s seen the pictures. He’s searched the house. Not unexpected, but not easy to take in.
Adorning the walls were some very nice pieces by very famous magic and Muggle artists, and Draco couldn’t help himself. He came to a full stop, examining a big, geometric canvas carefully. “Merlin’s beard, Potter,” Draco said, unable to keep the wonder out of his voice, “this is a genuine bloody
“Now, I know this has been your main question and I know you want an answer, and you’re not going to like that I’m not giving you a clear one. You need to hear it anyway. The job change? Go with it. Don’t force it. Things will change, and you’ll be lost and confused, but you’ll be happier after.”
, and polenta, and Sicilian chickpeas Draco read are creamier somehow. There's a bottle of olive oil and small decanter of aged balsamic vinegar that Draco tried a teaspoon of in the cellar with Andrea which was positively orgasmic. Draco uncorks the decanter and dips his pinky in, sucking off the syrupy vinegar with a pleased hum.
Harry just looks at Malfoy until Malfoy sighs and grabs a leaf. "Like this, separate the leaf from the stem. Some people eat the stems but those people are wrong. The stems are woody and inedible."
In the end, Draco decided to let Harry sleep on. After all, who was he to deny a fellow wizard a lie-in? Sundays were absolutely the best, most marvellous day of the week. Sundays meant no training, no Marcus Flint shouting in his ear, and the freedom to do whatever he wanted. Draco wondered if Harry and he might enjoy a shower together before they embarked on round two.
far from London,” Draco answered. “I’ve been in Cornwall for less than an hour but I’m already bored.” He shivered, despite the warmth of the day. He wasn’t sure why he disliked the place so much, but he just did. It felt like the facsimile of a home, felt fake. Something was missing, but Draco couldn’t put his wand on what it was. “It’ll be freezing come the winter and the salty air will ruin my hair,” he griped, “and it might as well be on the other side of the planet when our little one goes to Hogwarts. Besides,” he said darkly, “do you want your baby growing up with a Cornish accent? Might as well be born a Weasley.”
Malfoy stirs slowly melting chocolate over simmering water, adding a small measure of olive oil and once it's smooth and shiny takes it off the hob. He gingerly presses his fingertips to the cake, testing for coolness and pours the melted chocolate over the top of the cake, letting it drip gracefully over the sides.
"I couldn't agree more," Malfoy says, a glint in his eye. "You wouldn't let me starve, Potter, after all I've been through."
Harry wonders when was the last time he looked forward to something in the day, and the warm Italian sunshine fades a little as he thinks back on the last six months of Death Eater raids and being so tired that he's collapsed on the couch more nights than he's made it up the stairs to his bed. And before that the persistent terror of living in the tent and being actively hunted, a year on the run with no direction, no sleep, no food. It's been a long time since he's looked forward to anything.
"It's less like curse breaking and more like magical cleansing. The furniture in the Manor was all very traumatized. I'm sure you can imagine why."
Harry feels caught in the middle but the middle of what he doesn't know. "Ron said we're living in a post-war world. He's been testifying against Death Eaters."
"Because I have every right to be! If you think I'm going to sit here and try to prove to you why I deserve to be happy—"
Malfoy slides the kind of calzone into the oven and walks toward Harry like he's about to make the decision for him.
Surely there was no way that Arthur could be right? After all, it had been Harry, not he, that had presented the whole co-parenting deal and told their Mediwitch, and Molly, and anyone else that would listen that the pair of them were nothing but friends. That being said, Arthur had known Harry since he was eleven, and been the nearest thing he had to a father for all of that time. Perhaps he saw something that Draco had been missing.
Draco had loved his afternoons here. He had known for a fact that there wasn’t a more beautiful witch on the face of the Earth than Narcissa Malfoy. As they had eaten their Lemon Crème Tarts, Draco had told her, very seriously, all about the important goings-on between Pansy and him. Draco had felt very grown up, and very happy indeed.
“Oh, yes?” Harry teased, leaning back to kiss Draco’s throat once again. Everyone of Harry’s touches were maddingly slow, furiously teasing, and Draco half-wondered if he were playing with him. It was the same sweet expectation as when the Snitch was lively between them, frantic and fizzing, high in the sky, when Draco knew that the game was almost won or lost. Draco dearly hoped they’ll be two winners tonight. Everything so far had been splendid and he’d hate for the final act to be a disappointment.
The cake is made and eaten, the dishes are washed and dried, there's nothing left to do but kiss Malfoy.
Draco needn’t have worried, though. As soon as he’d finished hugging Harry, Ron stuck out his hand for Draco to shake.
Harry huffs a laugh, grateful someone's said it. "Maybe Umbridge will invite us for a game of pick up Quidditch next week."
"No I didn't," Harry says on instinct. Ron squeezes his shoulders, looking like he's trying not to laugh, and then goes to stand by Hermione, the pair of them far too amused at Harry's expense.
In bed, Malfoy rolls over and asks, quietly, “Did you notice today’s date?” and Other Harry hums his assent.
Draco didn’t know what to make of that, but he was gratified that Harry had been so prompt in making the appointment. Merlin, but he hoped that Potter hadn’t been spied buying a baby book. The
Harry unlocks the door with the spell Hermione created specifically for their flat and lets Malfoy in. The flat is still bare, except for boxes upon boxes of Hermione's books which she insisted needed to be put away according to her system
Some rogue spell work must have been at play – or perhaps Harry’s luck had simply run out – for their nearly-instantaneous Healing Charms hadn’t been as effective as they ought to have been. Draco elected to shake off his maudlin thoughts. Harry had eventually made a brilliant recovery. He’d become the finest Under-21 Captain in the Quidditch League, and didn’t seem to have any regrets. Well, maybe Harry did, but he hadn’t shared them with Draco.
meant Draco’s belongings could all be packed away into two trunks, and Ron and Greg had carried those through the Floo. All that remained was for Draco to do was collect his coat, his satchel and say his goodbyes to the place. He didn’t take long about it though.
Harry did what he was told, and Draco arranged the sandwiches on the plates, adding salad for garnish. He
Picking up his wand, Draco flicked it through the air, focusing on all his best memories, casting an
It smelt to Draco like burnt cauldrons, and Snape’s old potion cupboard, and he felt a second of pure panic when he looked around the hundreds of glass phials, and found that his brain didn’t seem to want to work. His armpits felt sweaty, even though the night was cold, and the withered old wizard behind the counter gave him a nakedly distrustful glance.
"Guilt is stupid, I told you," Malfoy says, his voice a little tight, but he leans into Harry and tucks his head underneath Harry's chin.
Narcissa was full of stories too. She’d enjoyed dinner with the Parkinsons, visited the Malfoy Châteaux in France, and worked hard for her sister’s charitable foundation. Draco admired his Mother’s steadfastness. Her work was all anonymous, an act of contrition for her part in the war. Excluding Andromeda, Draco was the only person who knew about it.
“Sorry,” Harry said, hurriedly averting his gaze. “Um, well. I thought you might need a hand. You look like you know what you’re doing.”
"Alright then. If you're done being weird," Harry says, "do you think you could tell me where to get some of those self-washing plates?"
Emptying his mind of ex-boyfriends, of crappy refs, and of nit-picking fans, Draco focused all his attentions on Harry. He was determined to enjoy himself, and he centred himself, letting his body grow lax and accommodating. Harry fumbled the lid from the lube, and lifted out a dollop. Draco hitched up his thighs in response, presenting his arsehole to Harry, sensual anticipation making him wanton. Cleverly, Harry warmed the lube with a blink of wandless magic, and then, with no further ado, he brought his fingers down to Draco’s bottom.
And that’s when Harry first sees Other Harry fully naked, noticing a few scars on his torso he doesn’t recognise, and a few new tattoos that make him smile. Other Harry climbs into the bath and sighs, contentedly.
Draco looks around the room as if looking for something he’s lost. Harry wonders if he accidentally misplaced something.
Malfoy whispers the words into Harry's cheek where he's nuzzling him, rubbing his nose softly against Harry's. Harry can now feel Malfoy's warm breath against his lips. Malfoy's hands move up Harry's chest, pausing to smooth over his clavicles, to rest at Harry's neck, cradling Harry's head. Malfoy scratches his fingers into the hair at the base of Harry's neck, sending tingles over his scalp and causing Harry to utter a small pathetic sound.
“Just looking at you, is all,” Harry replied, smooth and alluring. With that, Harry spread his palms over Draco’s shoulders, and pushed him down gently onto the seat. He hardly had time enough to squeak out a noise of enjoyment before Harry was positioning himself above him, all brawn and commanding strength as he climbed between Draco’s legs. “And I’m not going anywhere,” Harry finished, shifting his body downwards until his and Draco’s lips were nearly touching. “Not if you don’t want me to.”
Malfoy stops, looking a little embarrassed by his rant. "Well? Aren't you going to say asinine things about taking responsibility?"
pregnant, after all – when a small witch ambled over to where he was sat, and slid in the chair beside him. Her hair was Weasley-red, but it had a bright glow to it and her eyes were sky-blue. Whomever she was, there was an unmistakable Veela inheritance.
They’d never been the close confidants that he was with Greg or even Pansy. Their friendship had been mirth and it’d been banter. What Harry and he had since Café Quendryth was a new, imprecise thing, something they were still working the rules out of. Draco liked his odd new afternoons with Harry – liked them lots, actually – but he wasn’t quite sure how to describe what Harry and he were to each other.
Harry didn’t seem convinced by that answer, and what happened next astonished Draco. Harry leant forward, and caressed Draco’s bump, his hand skating over the soft cotton of his tee-shirt.
Not much surprised Greg, but Draco’s words actually seemed to. “Potter actually said that?” he asked, leaning back in his chair, the outlines of him shimmery in the green flames. “Look, you know I love you, matey. Snakes forever, and all that jazz. I worry that you’re going to let yourself get disappointed.”
“Mmm,” Draco moaned, relishing the entrée, and half-wondering whether it would be socially acceptable to order another plate. “Yummy. Can’t believe that I never knew this place existed before. The cuisine here is exquisite.”
Harry left, shutting the door behind him without a glance backwards. Draco didn’t know what to do with himself. All that panic, just because of a
Harry laughs, because it's true, Malfoy does throw his money around, but also because Malfoy apologized and Harry didn't even realize how much it meant to him that Malfoy make that effort. Neville can do whatever he wants with it, Harry doesn't need them to be best friends now.
It's on the tip of Harry's tongue to tell Malfoy he's competent enough to kill the most powerful wizard of the century so Malfoy can shove the condescension up his own arse but then Harry realizes how childish,
“She’ll love them unconditionally,” Draco answered, stepping forward and away from the book emporium. “Well, she will eventually. Once she’s gotten used to the idea of them. Mother is still rather tied to the old ways. She’d have been cast out of the House of Black forever for bearing an illegitimate baby. Her own family would have cut her off from her vault and changed the Wards to forbid her ever returning.”
“So, Draco, how has your pregnancy been?” Molly enquired, refilling Draco’s glass of juice with a tap of her wand. “Harry did tell me that you’d had a bit of sickness?”
“Racing brooms… Father of your child,” Greg smirked. “Same difference, really. You could never resist riding either. Now, be good, Malfoy, and if you can’t be good-” he said, breaking off the sentence so that Draco could complete it.
"Monkey!" Harry says, avoiding eye contact. They've only been kissing, Harry's not ready to talk about the size of his cock with Malfoy. "So what makes your lasagna better?"
Harry liked the encouragement. He swallowed even deeper, and then he lifted Draco’s legs onto his shoulders.
Harry pulled an odd face at that proposal – not disapproving as such, more quizzical – and looked very much like he was arranging his thoughts on the subject. He was about to speak when the same elf that has served them earlier called them back over.
The Trainee Healer bustles in after Harry with a tray of potions. Malfoy pouts for a bit when she tells him he can't have coffee with the potions he's on, but brightens when Harry tells him the filling in the kouign amann is lemon curd.
"Sorry, was a bit busy saving the world to become a wine snob like you." Harry says the spell and the cork shoots out of the bottle and hits Malfoy squarely in the forehead. "I'm a quick study though."
Harry takes a sip of tea. He doesn't know what to say. He stays quiet the rest of the afternoon while Malfoy digs through his cabinets judging all of Harry's premade food and tells him tomorrow they're buying Harry a spatula and a good dutch oven. And cutting boards, because Harry's plastic cutting board is "unsanitary."
After rubbing its soft fur against his legs until he gives into pets, Petrol walks over to the next cupboard door over and meows at it, rubbing its face against it. Not wanting to risk crossing the cat, Harry shuts the double doors with the albums and board games, and opens the small door.
He climbs up the stairs and stops on the landing, unsure about what his next step should be. His back twinges with pain just as Petrol comes dashing through his legs and jumps onto the unmade bed in the bedroom.
Draco was on the verge of agreeing to the plan – Angelica root was, after all, a notoriously tricky ingredient – when he heard Harry’s voice beside him. “Please tell your colleagues not to go to the trouble of Flooing over,” he said, giving the elf a small bow of respect. “Mr Malfoy and I understand that potion brewing is a difficult business, and you have nothing to reproach yourselves for. However, it is far too hot a day to wait; the pair of us will go Frobisher’s ourselves.”
It doubtless had something to do with the omnipresent hot-water bottle that was his tummy. There was clearly nothing to be done about that, and as he lay down on his settee, Draco decided the best course of action was to close his eyes and enjoy five minutes of Harry-Potter-themed day dreams.
Malfoy is staring down at the crinkled sheet looking like he's about to cry so Harry goes to sit with him. "Don't cry, yeah? I'll feel triple guilty if I make a sick person cry."
So Harry gets Malfoy thai green curry with tofu and brown rice. Malfoy only eats a quarter of it before his eyelids start dropping and he leans back into the pillow, yawning. Harry puts it under a preservation spell while Malfoy curls up, muttering about how the pillow is too scratchy and there aren't nearly enough.
Draco’s mind raced. He hadn’t expected Harry to ask that question, but he wanted to say yes. Had it been Harry who was carrying, he’d have wanted to get to know the baby before they were born. That was part and parcel of what they’d agreed. Make this fledgling détente work, one way or another.
Harry can't even make fun of Malfoy for using rich wanker cocoa and expensive cold pressed extra virgin olive oil in his Depression era cake because his mouth is pleasantly glued together with fudgy cake. He might even have to admit that Malfoy was right: cake first.
"You're right. You know, when I go to sleep at night I think, I should really be nurturing my hatred of Malfoy more."
Harry puts on a jumper and they leave on foot. There's a restaurant not far from Harry's flat that serves sushi, though he's never been.
Harry tries to sleep. He really does, for a whole hour even. At four in the morning he gives up, grabs his invisibility cloak and Floos to the Manor. His steps echo throughout the cold, empty Manor as he makes his way to Malfoy's rooms. He digs through Malfoy's magically expanded armoire to find clean pants and another pair of pajamas for him. Then he goes downstairs to make sure Yip has food and water. Yip simply lifts his head up from his bed and then flops down again when he sees it's Harry.
After a moment, Harry set the box and photo aside carefully, and begins ripping into the rest of the paper packages. Hermione gets him the newest quidditch dissect and Ron a large bag of dungbombs, and Hagrid has sent the biggest box of sweets Harry’s ever seen. It includes all of his favourites and few he hasn’t even heard of, and so he makes a note to give him an extra big hug when he sees him at lunch.
“No problem,” Angelina grins. “We all have our house pride, after all.” She jabs her wand towards Harry and he yelps as everything he’s wearing tightens to follow the lines of his body.
“I’m sure the song’s ending soon,” Draco says. “If they’re all refusing to switch until then, then we won’t have to wait much longer.”
“I can do all sorts of things,” he says, “but it’s not like you’ve taken the time to find out, is it?”
Neville has been persuaded to go back to bed, confused and apologetic, but the damage is already done. Harry stares at the
Harry ducks back under the cloak, inhaling sharply when he comes face-to-face with Malfoy. Malfoy studies him silently.
And really, Ron’s anger on his behalf is worth more than all the tens in the world. Harry pulls him back into the tent, smiling from ear to ear.
“No, no,” Harry says quietly. “We can’t send anyone that people will recognise easily. We could send Dean, I suppose. He’s quite tall, looks older than us.”
"Malfoy," Harry says rather tonelessly. Maybe he ought to be able to summon up some anger or annoyance or something but he just takes a scalding sip of tea instead, setting the cup carefully down on the only free spot on his desk. Harry's not messy, at least he doesn't think he is. He thinks he would be rather neat if he had the time to do anything more than collapse at his desk between raids.
He found Mr Weasley sedately dipping his shortbread into the remains of his tea. The older wizard offered him a bright smile. “See?” Arthur said. “Exactly like I said. The feelings are there. You just need to give him a bit of time, Draco, lad. Harry’s getting there.”
bedroom,” Draco answered him. “Your clothes can live in Sirius’s room if you wish, but not you, Harry. Not you. You asked me to take a chance on us. That’s what I’m doing.”
Harry comes closer and, taking Malfoy's hand in his, mutters a cooling charm. Malfoy doesn't say anything and Harry sighs.
Hermione ushers him into the kitchen, and suddenly gasps, almost panicked, “I have to let the Ministry know. Ron, you warm up the soup and make sure Harry eats! I’ll be right back.”
Draco very soon realised that he hadn’t needed to worry though. When he looked over at his co-father, Draco could see that Harry’s eyes were red-rimmed, wide and that his whole face was soft with reverence.
"You made Hagrid rock cakes so you wouldn't have to actually apologize for all shite you put him through."
He takes the pot off the heat, leaves the spoon in it, and wipes his hands on the tea towel over his shoulder, again. He flattens the piece of paper down on the counter numerous times, but it always folds back over slightly every time his hands leave the worn-yellow surface.
Tucking the book back into its place on the shelf, Harry crouches in front of the cupboards under. He rifles around stacks of board games and what looks like an album of a sailboat holiday with too many pictures of a (admittedly, very good looking) topless, sun-kissed, shiny with sweat and salt Draco Malfoy.
Harry's eating his second helping when Hermione comes home. She's wearing a bulging bag on each shoulder and carrying a stack of books the length of her arms that she sets down heavily on the kitchen table with a huff.
Somewhere along the line, his luck had changed, and he wondered, briefly, when that had happened. As Harry talked about their day ahead, about their lunch with the Weasley-Grangers, and the meeting with Marcus that he’d tried and failed to cancel, Draco listened. He looked across at Harry Potter, looked at the father of his child, and thought about losing to the Harpies. Draco thought about the night that followed it, and everything that had come afterwards.
Everybody was full of questions – ‘did they want a boy or a girl? Had Draco’s morning sickness abated? Had they felt the baby move yet? – but Draco never felt like their interest was prying or meddlesome. The Weasleys were enthusiastic and kind, and before he even realised what was happening, Draco felt some of the nerves in his belly begin to melt away. He didn't feel like a Kneazle on hot bricks any longer.
“You deserve nothing less,” Mother said, apparently satisfied by his answer. “Lucius, for all his faults, was attentive to a fault. Of course, he’d bonded with me only understanding that I’d beget him an heir. Even so, I cannot believe that all his small kindnesses were a falsehood.” Taking out her wand, Narcissa twirled it between the pair of them, and with a small sparkle of magic, their plates of Beef Wellington were returned to perfection. “Now, I’m going to have Adrianne go and live with you,” Mother continued, taking up her knife and fork, “and I won’t brook any disagreement. If you must insist in living away from your ancestral home then I will, at least, ensure you have help that befits your situation. Now please, eat,” she insisted, pointing down at Draco’s plate. “You must be famished, and I won’t have my granddaughter fed on nothing but croissants.”
