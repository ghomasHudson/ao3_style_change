"A sport," McGonagall answered simply. Remus wondered at her restraint. McGonagall loved Quidditch.
"Welcome tae Charming Chocolates!" a friendly Scottish man called out from the left, somewhere near the front counter. "We close in five, so get to it!" Remus nodded vaguely in the direction of the voice and shuffled through the crowd, heading for a more deserted back corner.
Draco felt something inside himself light up. He used his best quill, because his fingers deserved the best, and his third-best stationary, because Charming was a civilian chocolatiér and not a foreign dignitary.
"Just the boys?!" he squeaked (manfully).
"Testy as a pair of quizzicals," Blaise muttered, clearly basking in his not-cleverness. He crossed his arms and leaned against the tall lab counter on which Draco was working. The post would go out in twenty minutes and he wanted to be absolutely sure this lot was safe. He may not have been speaking to the Golden Git of Gryffindor, but he wouldn't see him dead. Again.
“What a fantastic addition, Mr. Malfoy!” Arthur nods, looking a little strained. “What are some other examples of diversity?”
Monty huffed. James supposed that was true. Harry had been the center of it all and he had come through alright. But all those others, the kids who didn’t make it…
. Everyone else has their own place."
He caught Ron's eye through the front windows of the shop and waved awkwardly. He was dressed in Muggle clothes but James saw the strap of a wand holster peeking out of his shirt sleeve. He was on duty. Apparently, now that the shop was slowly being discovered by more and more of the magical world, it was prudent to amp up security.
A bloke could get lost in those warm green eyes and capable brown hands.
"Okay!" he readily agreed. And then, before he processed what was happening, Draco tipped over in a deep, mocking bow, righted himself, and Apparated away. Harry blinked at the empty spot where Draco had just stood in the road, then looked both ways down the rural lane.
"I suppose your Weasley clan will be feeling it the most,” he says. “All forty-seven paychecks cut back at once. Pity.”
he said.
“When - ” Draco frowned, charming his mug to float over the coffee table. There were no coasters because James was apparently an animal. “When was I sick?”
, he was always such a sucker when his boys were upset. He stepped closer and wrapped an arm around Arty's shoulders, pulling the trembling boy to his chest as tightly as he held the blasted cat. "Th-they were throwin' bottles an' shit at her, she was m-meowing cos she was scared, am
He retrieves another pot of Dirty Dirt and Potter passes him the good trowel. They set to work in comfortable silence.
was different from the other parents of Muggleborn children. They always had loads of questions or theories to support their skepticism.
Unbidden, thoughts of his old friend Hedwig came to mind. She would've loved a roost up here. He hoped that, whatever had happened to her, she had lived a long, full life without him. Perhaps she was still out there, somewhere. Maybe she'd find him one day, if he stayed out here, free of the anti-owl wards of Blupin Frottage.
," Malfoy hissed, tucking an imaginary lock of hair behind his ear. James rolled his eyes.
"Then I'll have to infer that you're not a very good Healer, because he still uses that cane."
Draco lights upon a block of fudge, and Potter, meeting his eyes, parts his lips as if
it was one of those moments when he was remembering something. Which was fascinating, of course, but he wished he would hurry it up so they could get to the good part.
- but he shoved them away. James was happy, who was Draco to pick that apart with clinical terms?
"And mine," Draco added softly. "My heart and my brain. Also a blessing and a curse."
“What’s happening?” Draco growls, attacking the glass ferociously with the rag.
“I understand - ”
[enclosed: a vial of merfolk urine from Starr's Apothecary]
"Draco?"
"My what?" Was sign language so advanced that it already had a word for Draco?
This chapter took a long time (and a lot out of me) to write for many reasons.  There's so much conflict (James/Monty) and conflicting emotions (relationship angst/holiday fluff).  It's a tricky thing to write, to give weight to a two year relationship and seven year friendship without turning anyone into a raging supervillain.  I have a lot to say on their relationship, too much to type in the notes.  Dissect this chapter to your heart's content.  There's some intentionally squicky stuff I hope you'll recognize as Unhealthy Relationship Goop but also some gray areas I hope will confuse you, because real life is messy.
2 bed, 2 bath
he said.
"And do you remember how, when Kingsley sent a letter saying we could come out of hiding, you hid the message for another week so we could stay a little longer?"
"Draco..."
Draco opens his mouth to protest but Severus is already moving out from behind the counter. Unperturbed, Harry pulls a snack-sized container of Jell-O out of his cart and begins to dig in with a plastic spoon.
And just how the hell would they explain spontaneous flooding to a repair company?
Oh. It’s a tattoo. Yes, some sort of rune that was popular centuries ago.
Remus didn't know what was going on, but he knew he needed to recover this moment, and he needed some help.
"I suppose I could put in an emergency request for a pensieve today," she considered. "I should be able to get one before tonight… Will you pull out Harry's old photo album from the attic before you head off?" Ron nodded, not quite looking like he heard. "Can you secure his wand? The Aurors still have it, don’t they? That'll be the fastest way to get him to believe us - "
Better. The word winded Monty. He was better for James than some ruddy spell. He could help the doctor to understand James better than a magic wand could do. But James didn't trust him, even after all these years. After seven years, countless hours in each other's company, a hundred romantic and nutritious picnics for all three Charmings, new habits and rituals formed and broken and formed again around their excruciatingly slow-built relationship, James still fought tooth and nail whenever Monty offered his help.
"Jus' the reruns," Monty answered with a wink. Which meant no, they hadn't. They weren't really into the show, not like Alec was. Surely they wouldn't bother with it while he was gone. So who was sleeping on the sofa? "Yep, we stay up every night watchin' trash telly an' tellin' each other ghost stories, it's been a riot without you two!"
The pang in Draco's stomach was much less than it would have been if he had heard this comment ten years ago, but it still hurt, even from Blaise. And he wanted this conversation to end ten minutes ago.
Draco simply pointed at his bald, bald head. Weasel lost the battle and burst into loud, squawky, hoarse laughter, bringing Goldstein down with him.
"Record number of Muggleborn students this year," McGonagall chimed in somberly. "Because of what that boy did for us. He and his friends built a
James met Draco's eye before he went on forever. He moved his closed fist in a circle on his chest.
James jerked back in alarm, certain he was somehow crushing the animal, but Arthur just laughed.
"Happy to rearrange your teeth, just keep talking!"
"...you
"What?" she said, half laughing at the image.
the man's voice rang out in horror and Draco shot to his feet, hurrying to the back door to help. James reached out to grab the collar of his sleek blue shirt, but just missed him.
"He was never one for publicity," Blaise noted as he studied the Daily Prophet stretched out in front of his face. A small protest about werewolf rights had transformed into front page news thanks to Saint Potter's Gryffindor theatrics. Granger had clearly put Charming up to this stunt; this and the op-ed almost two weeks ago seemed like her brazen handiwork. "Unlike you."
If he was honest with himself, which he obstinately was not, he might've had to admit that he missed Charming, in a way. Missed his sass, his comically expressive face, his nervous ticks. The easy way his calloused, scarred, burn-covered hands could form a series of complicated signs like it was nothing, as easy as breathing. How Draco could almost understand what he was saying even without the charm's smokey translation; his expressions and his postures would combine with the more obvious signs to tell Draco what he wanted to say. It was like watching poetry, the way those hands moved. He wanted to see them make chocolate.
"Can you tell me what you experienced in that moment?"
medical issue. Before he could feel too silly for possibly overreacting in the fall, he launched into the tale. If anyone should have been witness to his pensieve memory, to his heroic defiance in the face of such danger, it should have been precious
Potter swears off sweets forever, which does the most in convincing his friends that
"Got a theory?"
"No!" Narcissa cried, throwing her arms across her son's unprotected chest. Arthur whined and James jerked forward as if to stop whatever was about to happen, but Alec was still clinging to him and he fell back once more.
"Remember the counter-charm when you're settled," Ron said to Arty, referring to his charmed appearance.
I remember now! This little farm started it all, didn't it? Started a whirlwind romance that has lasted three years only to land us right back here. Back on the farm. Yes. Might I remind you that I'm wearing my best jumper, as per your request? And you have me standing next to - " he ran a finger along the edge of the stone wall " - algae!"
"Oh, that's my walkie-talkie!" he says, patting his hip. There is no walkie-talkie. Draco's eye twitches. "Must need me in the back. See you round, Malfoy."
James shrugged.
"Sorry, Monty," Arthur Charming mumbled.
, James replied. He placed the wooden spoon carefully on the spoon-rest that was shaped like a cartoon owl. James had picked it up at an odds-and-ends store years ago, no doubt hearing Harry the Wizard in his head prattling on about owls.
"Idiot."
“They almost caught me! They
"Dragon, come now - "
James shoved it back across the counter. He wasn't hungry and he didn't want his damn muffin. Monty's frown deepened.
James signed in utter disbelief. What, were they first years again? Even Al and Ar weren't this petty.
"Brilliant!" Arthur grinned, sitting up on his tie-dye bedspread to listen in.
The wand!
"Now we wait for the other half of M & P to make this dream a reality."
"You can't be serious..." This wasn't happening. In no conceived universe could she have foreseen Harry Potter confessing so readily to his little crush on Draco Malfoy, even after an actual, literal, overt Valentine's date. Not only that, but wrapping the Slytherin ice prince in chocolate and calling him a truffle!
"Hogwarts?" Monty snorted, stepping aside and gesturing them inside. "Funny name for a school."
"A've invited the professors back," Monty finally said, his voice falsely bright. "An' some old friends, tha' Ron bloke an' his wife." James wasn't surprised in the least but he certainly felt a spark of something... Betrayal? This was Monty's computer research all over again, sticking his nose into something that didn't concern him. Yes, betrayed, he was feeling betrayed!
Apparently not. Potter says nothing as he draws the wire out and bends it in half. He bends one end into a little crook, tamping it down with his teeth before shoving the device back into the little shaft. Draco watches his back as he works. Even through his shirt, Draco can see the angry, raw wounds bubbling up on his once immaculate skin.
He was eighteen, crippled, and living in a homeless shelter; he had no family, no job, and a spotty education at best. She was twenty-one, a recent university drop-out, making a miniscule salary that wasn’t even enough to support herself, begging her parents to fill in the gaps. And her family had helped when they could, until she revealed the pregnancy in December.
was better than...this.
Then,
"Are you unhappy here, Harry?"
Alec stood nervously outside the blanket fort. The multi-colored lights looked much better in the blankets than they did on the tree, much cheerier. Dad blinked again and swallowed. He pulled his arm out of Arthur's grip, resting a hand on his shoulder instead. Arthur felt a gentle squeeze and nodded to Alec, who lifted the flap to let Dad in first.
"Blindingly so."
"Oh, it was urgent?" inquired Blaise, all innocence and wonder. "You urgently wished to make a public appearance on Harry Potter's arm?"
"Cocoa?" Arthur called out, shoving the game board aside to make room for Munchkin. Alec was still gloating as he gathered the cards, but Arthur would soon take his revenge. The hot cocoa would be put to good use - it always made Alec sleepy. That would throw him off.
It was true - even Malfoy had seen it, which was why he called an end to their sessions, because James was happy. Not because he had fucked up irreversibly...right? James shoved those thoughts aside - Malfoy had responded to a letter, things were improving. He just needed time to come to terms with whatever life-changing event had sent him spiraling.
. James scraped the ruined dinner into the bin and turned his back on Monty to wash the pan in the industrial sink. Monty sighed.
he'd started calling him James. Not Harry. Not jaybird. Not Mr. Charming.
"Ron makes a good teammate. I dunno what this job would be like without him - probably
With the lights off, the shop was shadowed and gloomy, but still warm. A quaint little street lamp just outside threw soft orange through the storefront window and he was just able to distinguish the familiar shapes and pieces that made up his shop. The displays were all recycled furniture he had spent an entire summer transforming into things he could use. A reclaimed manicure station was perhaps the oddest bit, but surprisingly versatile. It displayed their luxury chocolates in a series of little tiers that once held dozens of bottles of varnish, and its long sweeping counter was perfect for larger samples packed into gift boxes.
James hesitated, looking uncertain.
No one else ventures an answer and the seminar continues. Bellatrix reads from a manual for twenty minutes and then a television on a cart is wheeled in. The lights are flicked off as the training video begins:
"You knew my real name?"
He bid goodnight to the boys and turned in early, sloughing off his shoes and throwing himself diagonally across the bed he hadn't been in for weeks. Pressing his face into the pillows, he breathed in the scent of James. His jaybird. He curled up with the pillow, longing for the days before all this magic nonsense, when James could still see the good in him, when -
Draco inches off their safe little island while Potter subtly adjusts his angle. He can smell the rubber of Potter's soles melting into the floor as he huddles as close as he can get to the hot iron door. It's now or never.
Al and Ar left the room slowly but silently, staring with wide eyes as Monty and James glared daggers at each other. As soon as the door closed, James threw his cane in the corner of the living room and started signing.
"It's true, sir," Weasel interjected, catching his breath. "He helped Hermione's parents. Revolutionary, apparently. No one else came close to what he managed." Draco would have blushed if he were more modest. As it was, he thought the praise was well-earned and overdue.
his mind supplied bitterly. James didn't answer, only smiled at him in a vague way that looked more like a grimace before throwing the letter back on the table.
"Don't go to school."
“No!” Draco gasps, clutching a hand to his chest. “N-no!”
"Daddy?"
Monty stared at him like he was insane.
"Oh. Alright then..."
No, he could do this! He
, Harry, not just another case - and it healed some small part of him to know that. He was glad to have broached the usually-taboo subject. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as Kim had told him.
"You're gonna need to explain that one, mate."
"Yeah," Harry said, swallowing with an audible gulp. His scar was firmly covered by his cap, he reminded himself, and Malfoy hadn't seen Harry Potter since fourth year. He'd not been found out yet, surely.
"Yeah."
"They'll come to ours when they've finished giving their statements at the Ministry," came the eventual reply, though it sounded stilted, awkward. Draco nodded. Staying under the roof of an Auror was the best option, of course. "I should head back, actually. I only wanted you to know everything's - "
Harry's face screwed up in a telling way and Ron looked away. He desperately wanted to allow Harry some privacy but they needed his testimony.
"Please, I am a Mind Healer on the forefront of my profession," he said with his best scoff. "I wouldn't presume to judge someone who is happy."
Remus nearly lost his dinner. Harry was using sign language?!
"What?"
Kim waited, but Harry couldn't even shake his head 'no.' They actually reached the silo across the field today, which told Harry that Kim wasn't going to let this one go. Sometimes she extended their sessions when there was something particularly troublesome to unravel. Harry reached out and placed his palm against the dark, weathered wood which was warping slightly against the curve of the wall. He craned his neck back to watch the silo seemingly disappear into the bright blue sky.
A knock at the door and Alec damn near hurled the mobile into the closest desk drawer in a panic while Arthur flew to the wardrobe to stow the cat.
"I don't suppose you'd understand what that's like,” Potter sneers, his eyes bright.
"Well, sometimes they
Harry blanched, and Ron was quick to assert, "It didn't have that effect though, right, Hermione?"
, James said stiffly. But Monty wasn't finished.
No water.
Draco felt his face flush; his cheeks were hot against the frigid air. Harry was grinning again in that stupid smug way he had when he thought he'd bested Draco.
"And when will that be?"
“The same small circle for six months now, don’t you think it’s time to spread your wings, so to speak?” His voice was light and chipper, fantastically bland, and Harry almost wished for silence again.
"Did your Muggles neglect to teach you manners?" he asks out of the corner of his mouth, flashing a dazzling smile at the witch when she peeks up at them. She smiles back, revealing a shelf of rotted teeth. Draco shudders and Potter leans over his shoulder again.
"A student died in that Tournament, Mr. Potter," Malfoy snapped. "I hardly think it's something to bring up in a joking manner."
4:00 pm
of Pansy Parkinson. Pansy, like Hermione, had managed to grow into her look in such a fitting way that Harry had trouble recalling the pug-nosed girl from Hogwarts. They were all awkward, misformed teenagers back then, after all. Harry was only just now coming into himself.
"Four in ours, including me," he whispered, eyes darting around. "There are other groups, it's far-reaching. Bigger than Potter, really, but..." he trailed off, grimacing. "If Potter's back, it could be pretty far-reaching too. Draco, I'm just trying to smooth things over, I don't want to hurt anyone... It could all go to hell, for all of us."
, he went on, as if Arthur hadn't already been doing that.
that look and later he saw young Harry wear it in his third year as Remus scolded him for sneaking out -
James folded his pillow over his ears, feeling the hot anger in his chest begin to grow. He couldn't fight about this with Monty anymore - the man would have to come to his senses at some point. Malfoy wasn't even his Healer anymore, he was just a friend! Why couldn't he have friends?!
"I presume you'll catch up on the half-breed's lesson in private, then? You'll have to share your notes. I don't fancy failing my exams for a spontaneous jaunt through the woods."
James grinned. He knew what to do. Planning and renovating was hard, sweaty work, but he loved to cook. He hobbled back to the cupboard, hardly able to breathe for the pain, and dug into Harry Potter's old trunk. He had barely touched the trunk; for as long as he insisted he was James and not Harry, it felt like an invasion of privacy. But there was one thing he would need for this project: his old astronomy book.
"Fuck you," he said shortly, pushing his chair back and gathering up random bits of parchment.
“I think it would be good for you to begin socializing on a larger scale,” Remus broached delicately. Harry rolled his eyes, not bothering to hide it. He heard Sirius finally descend the stairs behind him.
“How old do you think we are?” Mr. Flamel asks challengingly. Minerva’s eyes widen slightly as she considers. The couple looks ancient. They seem to be competing for who can look more dead: frizzled white hair, skin so pale it’s almost blue, wrinkles on wrinkles on wrinkles.
James thought,
Harry remains silent as he snatches a paper bag labeled
Monty was laughing. Laughter did not fit in this moment at all. It was like trying to pick back up in his favorite childhood comic, The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle, but accidentally flipping to the wrong page and reading ahead. It felt wrong, out of place.
"Alright, alright," Ron grumbled as he noted the miniscule clues. "I get it, it's all a blur."
Harry simply blinked at McGonagall, his eyebrows lifted slightly in politely masked incredulity. No tension in the shoulders, no grinding of the teeth, no narrowing of the eyes behind those odd rectangular glasses. Just the same as the other Muggle families Remus had visited earlier that day; Harry was displaying all the mannerisms of a polite Muggle father who found himself entertaining a couple of nutcases for dinner.
Monty left James alone on their day off. He had a load of Christmas shopping to get done, but more than that, he didn't think he could bear to be around him right now. He wanted to scream more horrible words, to shake some sense into the man, to replay Saturday night and show James what an utter
Mr. James asked with his hands.
Draco looks quite pleased with this. He lets Harry linger in limbo for a long moment before finally giving in.
Hermione sneered down at the paper on her kitchen table, skimming the article once more.
“But the pale and cranky, that still stands?”
…thanks."
"He is crazy," Draco asserted, watching James's face carefully. "In my professional opinion."
Narrow, waist-high bookshelves were lined up strategically to create aisles that the customers could browse near the front, without overcrowding the already cramped space. Along the walls were a variety of "shelves," which were mostly made of planks of wood rescued from the cupboards that had been falling apart in the kitchen before it was refinished as well.
He shuddered, pressing his children tighter to his sides.
Malfoy was back to his clinical, painfully professional self. No jokes, no smirks, no sneers. For a cold, hard hour. But not even their initial meeting had felt as empty as this. That first meeting, there had at least been
, by Frida Macías. He had read it again over the past few weeks and seriously considered emailing the author to ask: "Summer camps and exchange programs are all well and good, but what if you're harassed into sending your babies away to magic murder school?"
"Put some sprinkles on fer me," Arty said, falsely bright, ducking in for a fierce hug. Something horrible pulled in James's chest when he realized he was about to go out for ice cream without his boys for the first time in his life.
“Gay,” Cormac calls out, leaning forward to send a not-so-subtle look at Draco, who carefully ignores him.
"That's rude." Ben frowns at him and the wrinkle between his brows deepens like a canyon in the desert, which Harry will never have the chance to see. "You've been quite recalcitrant lately, son... What's bothering you?"
smelled that before. He couldn't smell anything in regular dreams, this was real, or close enough to it. At some point in his life, he had smelled a real person burning up, had heard a real person screaming for their life before going silent…
“I’m looking for a whirlwind romance,” Pansy whispers. “Long talks, late at night. About anything.”
Alec's screams were still echoing in his mind and the waves were playing on loop. It was much too dark to push the image of the makeshift grave out of his head. He needed some light. Needed something to do. James scrubbed both hands over his cheeks, wiping away the wet tracks. He turned from the shop and headed into the kitchen, switching on the radio as he went.
Sirius gave a low whistle of appreciation. "Didn't see how you'd improve on my old space, Malfoy, but I have to admit..."
He took a breath, feeling as if he stood on the edge of a cliff. His hands started signing, almost automatically.
"I'll draw this one for you next to keep you warm at night," he whispers with a wink, resisting the urge to claw his own nipples off. Potter looks away, swallowing, and Draco smirks. Victory is worth a dirt-stained shirt, but he could do without the tightness in his trousers.
The words from years ago rang in James's mind as clear as if they'd just been spoken. He peered closely at the stranger in the room, only to realize that he wasn't a stranger at all:
"You're underdressed."
"So, Mr. Blue, can M & P Realty count on you for a good review?" Draco asked lightly. Harry turned onto his side and rested his chin on Draco's shoulder, inching close. Draco turned his head and met him halfway for a slow, sweet kiss.
Oh god, he was flying!
"What, shrink the head of Sirius Black? Can't be done, mate."
"It's not really sanitary, is it?" he asks one day over breakfast or lunch or dinner or whatever it is they are sharing at the little table in this room. Denny frowns at him. "Eating in the loo, I mean."
"Draco, be sure to clean those thoroughly," Severus demands as he stalks away. "I don't want customers complaining about sticky rings."
James clenched his jaw and for a moment looked as if he might throw the mug of hot tea at Draco’s face. An image of last night flashed in his mind - hurling chocolate at each other - but it was hazy, possibly just a dream.
"Orange cat?" Arthur spoke.
"Al's not afraid of her," he claimed. James gave him a good
With an awkward shuffling, they inch closer to the bed, dragging their island of clothes with them. Draco can feel the hot bricks through the fabric, through his socks. Carefully, ever so carefully, he leans over, blinking away the blackness that creeps into his vision, and reaches for his abandoned shoes. It’s a painstakingly slow process, but then his shoes are on again and there’s a nice thick buffer between his feet and the floor. Hunched over, Potter doesn’t even seem to notice his own singed feet—he’s too busy gutting the demon mattress, using his trousers as a protective glove—and Draco reaches out again to collect his shoes as well. A little voice in his head tells him he's quite the gentleman for it.
“I knew that, I just - “ he broke off and waved his hand vaguely in explanation. He was twenty-eight now, apparently. It would be weird to call him Professor Lupin. “Good to see you. Figuratively speaking,” he added, gesturing to his bare face. He regretted breaking his glasses now, but he stood by the point he’d made in doing it.
"LALALALA!" Alec sang, dropping his fork with a clatter to cover his ears. That broke up the somber mood well enough as their guests tittered and blushed.
An austere young man, wearing a sharp vest made of green silk and a gold name-tag that reads Draco M., snorts inelegantly and looks to the ceiling as if calling for divine intervention.
each other. You and I, we don't need each other… We can do just fine on our own, it's just we're better together. Like a team."
Charming looked about to say something, hands still hovering stupidly in the air, but then he seemed to fold in on himself. Gaze averted and a scowl tugging at his lips, he nodded, stood, and limped through the door.
"The truth!"
The silo had been refreshed nearly beyond recognition, but he knew it was his. The old, warped wood on the outside was now smooth and shining under so much dark stain; a single, impossibly long window spiraled up the whole thing like the red streak in a candy-cane; at the top rested a cabin built from whole logs, with a tiny porch hanging over the edge, cutting into the sky itself.
Harry dropped some truly foul language - on purpose! - which made Draco laugh louder than he'd ever heard. Harry got the feeling he hadn't done it right - the swearing - but he didn't mind because he did it and didn't feel sick afterwards...on the contrary, he felt on top of the world!
She came down a half hour later, hair done, face washed, even a bit of makeup making her appear more fresh than she felt. She found Ron leaning against the counter, phone off the hook next to him.
"Haz," Harry corrected. He loved hearing 'Haz.'
They pulled apart and Harry kept his eyes closed, unable to see what Draco was doing and therefore not sure if he was supposed to open them.
"Erm, Da'?" Alec said lowly. The table was far too quiet now. James turned to Al expectantly, trying to ignore the staring. "Er, Arty's not the one who's afraid of cats..."
"How far along is she?"
"What did it taste like?"
"I'll look into it. Thank you, Mr. Blue," Terry tipped their head in a little bow.
"Did you not mean it…? I suppose I can call you Harry, if you prefer." The way Draco's mouth twisted at his given name made it all too clear his thoughts on
forgotten it, he had forgotten it all. His wand, his magic, his Dudley, Seamus, Neville, and certainly his bloody Malfoy. And now that James was remembering, he forgot that Monty wasn't a part of all that old nonsense. Could never really be a part of it.
"Right, where's your - where is he?"
of seeing it.
This stuns Pansy to silence, but she rallies. Staring hard at the other woman, she uses her finger to push the notebook across the tall counter until it bumps against Hermione’s chest.
“ - helping you get accustomed to the world again, in a way that doesn’t cause undue stress - “
Harry practically threw himself into the hammock, which swung wildly toward the window before swinging back into the room. Sun shone through the angled windows in the ceiling and he beamed at the brilliant blue sky overhead and at his side.
Ben drops his disgusting smile and wraps his large hands around Harry's arms, hauling him back to bed. Harry squirms and jerks about, trying to free his elbows, which Ben has learned by now to hold back. He is held down by a single hand on his chest while Ben goes to cover him up again and Harry bends himself in half to kick him in the stomach. Ben hardly seems to feel it and Harry screams nonsensically.
Draco cringed.
Rachel had promptly vomited and nearly splinched herself as she tried to Apparate out of the anti-Apparation wards. Mrs. Malfoy assured them that the Manor had no such wards in place, so Rachel had Tony to thank for the Auror-level magic that nearly tore her apart in her panic.
Harry waited a beat, then gave a firm nod. Malfoy was an odd duck. Then he blanched when it hit him that sarcasm was not something one would say they
with cats. He left his cane behind and flew up the stairs, obstinately ignoring the roaring pain in his hip.
“Get. Your. Perfect. Arse. Out.”
"I'm looking for mallowmarshes."
It was still early afternoon and the shop was closed, which was apparently unusual if Weasley’s accusing glare was anything to go by.
He distinctly remembered pulling the door handle. Falling out of the cab was less clear, but he definitely hit his knees hard against the damp concrete ground before scrambling off through the tunnel. The ugly orange lights spun around him, someone was shouting, someone was grabbing him around the elbows and his own voice was hoarse and cracked as he screamed and his cheeks were wet and cold and he couldn't breathe -
"All our...shite back in school, and fourth year especially, and my dad..." Draco was looking ten times more uncomfortable than Harry, which he didn't think possible. "Y-you
"You really should start carrying your wand with you," Ron snapped. "All the time, I mean, not just for translating when we're around. You never know what could... Mate, it could save your life one day!" Hermione knew he was still running in circles trying to find out what had happened to Harry all those years ago. All those miscellaneous investigations were driving his partner mad, but Auror Goldstein had stuck by his side through all of it.
"Yet another example of unexplained phenomena," Draco said agreeably, as if he hadn't spent every early morning sneaking behind Harry's back to bribe the beasts with charred meat. It had all been a ploy, of course, to impress Harry later with his newfound courage and animal prowess.
"Next time," he agreed.
He seemed to have no control over his own actions. He watched his hands as they dug a makeshift grave for Arthur's transformed corpse. He kept digging even as he listened to Alec's screaming, wailing, howling, until all he could hear was the sound of the waves.
Draco repeated the full sign a few times.
James shook his head in disbelief and, still grasping Draco's hand, knocked it gently against Arthur's back in response.
"And how did you overcome your Obliviation?"
He heard all of those stories told by the others tonight and wanted to run away and also to hurl himself back into that world. Danger was abundant: dragons, giant spiders, merpeople holding children hostage underwater, unblockable spells that tortured or instantly killed. But the magic of it all was so enticing, so wonderful. He wanted to fly again, those were always the best dreams. He wanted to charm his shoelaces to tie themselves. He wanted his hands on some chocolate frogs. He wanted to throw a hex at that blond git that sneered at him in so many memories.
Bursting into the room, he found his son clutching an alien to his chest, staring up at him in triumph.
"If you found the letter, why didn't
The words could have been sarcastic but he looked disgustingly earnest, which caused Draco to choke on his spit.
"If the Aurors are through and Mr. Charming is feeling up for it, you may go at any time. We'll get you a fresh supply of your potions from our own stock."
“You don’t wanna know, mate.
Harry shoves away from the sink and flies to the door, pounding on it with abandon. A brittle wheezing sound reaches his ears - unmuffled - and dimly he realizes it's coming from himself.
Malfoy let the statement hang in the air - literally, as the gold smoke lingered for some time. He cleared his throat and moved to take a sip from his tall glass of water, only to send it careening off the edge of the desk and crashing to the wood floor.
But Monty had volunteered countless hours to keep the boys busy while James renovated the dilapidated kitchen, refurbished the second-hand furniture, and finished the floors. Together, they painted every room, installed heavy appliances in the kitchen, and planned and pulled off an opening day that brought in dozens of customers who would later become their regulars due to Monty's easy charisma.
night," Monty said. Usually one to avoid any serious confrontation, Monty sounded uncharacteristically determined today. "Get through dinner wae these people, let ‘em see their old friend again."
Dad hesitated, glancing at Arthur, who shrugged.
, of all things. He was mute. He used sign language and a cane. He had himself a Muggle boyfriend or husband or something, and twin boys who looked just like him. Like little first year Harry-clones. Something about a malevolent robot. Remus was fairly shaken up over the whole ordeal and promised to return with more information when he could.
"You're not Blaise. Blaise would never pronounce Charming like that.
"Does he want your help?" he asked sharply. Harry was nothing if not independent. He'd just escaped Monty's grip and Ron was hard-pressed to release Malfoy on him now that he was finally free!
More laughter and James could feel his cheeks begin to heat up.
he mocks. Draco rolls his eyes and looks up—cold blue eyes meet his through the slat in the door. "Potter!" he whispers urgently.
1 bed, 1 bath
, he signed, mostly to clarify to Monty. He remembered Fred on the floor of the Great Hall. He had never forgotten that.
"The forefront of my field," he agreed stiffly.
. Gross.
James signed excitedly as they cheered the Harpies' victory lap.
James asked, scrunching his face in uncertainty.
Monty cleared his throat. The situation was far too serious for his jokes and James was never in the smiling mood when he was in hospital. It was time to get him back home.
"Listen, he's still - I don't know - but he's fun, now," he protested weakly as they clung to each other, literal tears streaming down their faces. He didn't think it was
James felt exposed when using his wand in public like this, but they were in a relatively secluded corner of a moderately priced restaurant off Diagon and though it was packed, no one, Draco insisted, was staring at him.
Happy birthday, Draco Malfoy!
James went on, scowling.
"Well, we know that much, Sherlock."
As it was, he only needed it in order to test the spell with a few words and phrases. And it worked! And he owed Abbott a heap of chocolate!
this deep in the forest," Draco snaps. The sun is setting and it's so cold, he's not even feeling up for another squabble. His fingers are painfully stiff and he curses himself for forgoing mittens. "Ask Granger for a refresher on magical interference if you're really so thick as to—"
"Because of what Potter might say?" Draco pressed, knowing the answer. Blaise nodded jerkily, lowering the wand slightly. There was a pause. An almost mutually sympathetic moment between two people who might have once been friends, if Draco could place his captor's identity. Then: "How much did he see?"
But James was sleeping and eating and cleaning and smiling again, and Monty was happy.
"It all began seven years ago when a first met the dumb salad what jus' started work at the bakery." He winked at Al, who didn't even see it through his hands. "Worked the same shift, five tae five. He was a beauty, but skinny as a rail, so a brought him homemade treats to fatten 'im up. Ye know, like how a big strong bird woos a wee little bird tha's too stupid tae feed itself properly!"
"Potter, stop it—sit down."
It wasn't Ron's fault that Malfoy was a petty little shit. In retrospect, yes, it may have been better to make certain the twit knew about the breakup
"Left," he answered.
"Why do you not want your memories back?" The question took him aback but he seemed to consider it carefully, as he had many of the tougher questions in their therapy sessions.
Draco grasped his hand where it rested on Arthur's back. He didn't move it, simply folded his own inside and held it firmly.
"No." She sent him a stern look. "I'm saying it's only natural for your mind to assume the worst when someone advances on you during an argument. It's only natural for you to pull your wand, but...well, it may have made things worse. Monty's sensitive, you know, and I'm sure he was hurt that you thought he would do something to you. All those emotions running high… It may not have been as awful as either of you think."
A bit.
"I make observations about how you choose to present yourself, Mr. Charming," he sighed, looking pointedly at James's trainers. The sole was peeling off the bottom of one of them, but they were comfortable and he thought he might get a few more weeks out of them. "It's all tied into what we do in this program, I assure you."
"I don't want it to muck things up either," Draco agreed, and he broke into an uncharacteristic, nervous-looking grin. "At least not before I get to snog you."
and looking at him in that challenging way that told Monty he was now itching for a fight.
"Put the warrants out," he said, minding his tone this time. With another flick of her wand, Rachel sent six scrolls racing out of the conference room.
Engaged! To be married!
Arthur hadn't said much about it since that day, but Alec had taken right to Draco, and even Scorpius. Arthur hadn't tried to freeze him out, which was James's chief concern at first, but he hadn't really warmed up to him either.
. Her silver mane seems to glow brighter than any moon, and her stunning pale-golden hide is a study in radiance. The foal sports a wild tuft of a mane—as wild as Potter's, really—that twinkles like starlight.
James nodded quickly. It was a wise choice, as it turned out, because when Ron failed to cover up a long, drawn out snort, Malfoy flicked his wand. Suddenly Ron was swearing and threatening to arrest everyone while he clutched his foot. Malfoy seemed pleased and unaffected by the threats.
"Well," he said waspishly. "If he doesn't want my help, that's fine, but
, James said, grimacing.
He hurled the massive chocolate penis out the open window, into the large alleyway he shared with Marge's boutique.
James recalled fondly.
" - but he decorated all the cakes so they let 'im stay on. This one time," Arty broke off in a giggle and James knew he would hate whatever was coming next. "This one time, he fell asleep in the back durin' his break - "
Malfoy’s eyes darted down to James’s hip, though from their positions it looked more like he was eyeing his groin. He shifted, nodding, then continued:
Well, near enough.
"Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts," she answered in an accent that was suddenly thicker than anything Remus had ever heard from her.
"That Potter is really your Prince Charming."
Her brain fizzled to a stop.
“Voldecorp: Keeping your family pure since 1979."
James frowned. Why wouldn't he be serious? This was a serious issue!
he asked, panic gripping his heart and making it hard to breathe. Monty relayed his question and Hermione placed a hand on James's elbow.
he said with a scowl.
Witnesses had this to say:
Harry frowned and gave it a thought, before shrugging noncommittally.
"Yeah?" Arthur knew exactly where he was going with this. Twin thing. He darted out into the hall, sparing a glance for the pitiful sight in the living room, before retrieving the sheet and all the spare pillows from the linen cupboard. When he returned, Alec already had their mattresses on the floor.
"Oh not like that! Calm your tittering heart, princess! Lest you...titter yourself to death!" Blaise looked quite pleased with that one and Draco wanted to hurl the pitcher at his ineloquent mug. "Is the rumor true," Blaise started again, very slowly, as if he were an imbecile, "that Potter is the upstanding citizen behind Charming Chocolates?"
It was a combination of things that wore him down.
"It's just some of them aren't all that good."
He asked himself what he would do if Astoria - or someone wearing her face - suddenly turned on him with little Scorpius in the next room. He asked himself if he would ever be able to sleep in his own home again if the Aurors had failed him so badly. He asked himself how James's hip might hold up in combat.
) for
"Scorpius."
Draco made a whooping sound and pumped his fist in the air triumphantly before Arthur's lingering smugness registered. He retracted his fist with a squeak just as James peered across the room curiously.
"Nice face, Malfoy—do you want to keep it that way? …Did you seriously take the last piece of toast, Neville? Bloody well died for your sins, mate…"
“I really must insist these are found immediately, sir,” Mr. Flamel says, his brow furrowed in grave concern. “I cannot emphasize enough how far certain people would be willing to go to get their hands on these gemstones.” Albus lifts a placating hand.
"Keep—
He swallowed against the inner voice that was screaming at him to shut up, to keep James Charming pure and separate from the Golden Git of Gryffindor.
Draco bends to retrieve a rag and a spray-bottle of blue cleaning product from a drawer. He sprays Harry fully in the face to get him to back up before dousing the counter thoroughly.
"Yes, that one's more perplexing," Draco admits, considering the situation.
"You've got to fix this," she began. "This whole mess."
"Al, get yer bloody robot under control!"
Monty went to take the paper again but James snatched it back, flipping through it, searching for something. He slammed it on the table and drew his wand, giving it a wave. A steno pad and pen flew into his hand.
Magic. Always an answer for everything. Except for the James Charming conundrum, of course. Dr. Abbott had concluded, at the end of the physical, that there was nothing to be done for his lost voice and little to be done for his damaged hip. James had accepted the one month supply of potions, despite Monty warning him to look into the risks of painkiller addiction. James was a sharp bird, he just didn't have any common sense. Magical painkillers were likely just as addictive and dangerous as the normal stuff. And bone-strengthening draughts? Sounded like milk, if someone bothered to ask Monty. But no one ever did. Because Monty's opinions didn't matter now that magic was back in James's life.
Scorpius considered his answer, looking far too serious for his age. Then he nodded firmly.
"We don'
"It's not the same and you know it," Alec huffed, folding his arms across his chest. Arthur nodded and copied his brother. United front. That's what they needed to convince their father. It worked about half the time.
Draco smirked and pulled his arms back around his waist firmly. Enough with this unsettled nonsense. He liked those arms around him, just as much as he liked wearing the disgusting mustard-yellow hoodie and the droopy joggers. It felt safe. Comfortable. Exciting. A little mad, but the good kind of madness that led to dark lords being defeated and worlds being changed.
And finally,
Apparently growing tired of the dramatics, Draco showed up at Blupin Frottage (uninvited) and escorted (kidnapped) him to their next real estate venture. (Sirius was all Smirky McSmirkface and Harry began to wonder how much of a fight his traitorous godfather put up against this home invasion.) Instead of their usual round of soon-to-be-rejected properties, however, Draco enlisted the
Weren't therapists supposed to use their words? He felt like he was interrogating a toddler.
That did the trick to sober Ron up and Hermione went back to tracing the rim of her mug.
Draco felt a stab of blind panic - what if he'd meant to keep them private? He was snooping a bit, fine, but was this the same as perusing the bookshelf? Oh Merlin. Oh shit! He was doing exactly what he'd hated Potter for doing at Hogwarts, poking his nose into other people's private business! And he didn't even have a prophecy to urge him onto such half-baked shenanigans! Draco's head snapped back sharply, as if he were just physically assaulted with how stupid and hypocritical he was -
James hesitated, then went on.
Harry jolts in his seat before shooting a look over his shoulder at Hermione, as if asking for help or maybe just solidarity.
"Open..." Malfoy swayed in his seat. "Open invit-tation."
Arthur somehow managed to whip out a frisbee from the depths of his trousers.
, he said, praying his hands would remain steady.
"So did it work?" he asked, patting the wrinkled head of the hairless cat that was going to town on the can of food in his wardrobe. Alec didn't look away from the cat and Arthur raised his voice a little. "Al? Did ye get what ye needed earlier? Nearly broke ma leg falling down those stairs..."
It was strange to eavesdrop on people again. It seemed as if, since the dawn of time itself, he’d only ever heard two voices: his own screams, insults, and pleas, matched against his captor’s wheedling attempts to break him.

The door opened to reveal Dad leaning heavily on his cane, a sure sign of a long day. It was probably best his mobile was in Alec's desk drawer for now. He cast a blank look over the chaos of their room but didn't say anything against it. James Charming liked order -
"Noooo," Sirius breathed with a dismissive wave of his hand, but all Harry heard was
, that's exactly what you'll do!"
His watch read 6:55pm and with a panicked lurch in his stomach, Remus barged through the door.
Draco whipped out his wand and threw a stinging hex at his father's arm. Lucius immediately dropped the owl, which fell to the floor. Draco stooped low to gather it from the shiny marble. It was skittery and ruffled, hooting in outrage and panic. He cooed softly at it while Lucius retreated, ranting about traitors to the cause.
Hermione frowned and grumbled, ushering Scorpius and Rose to the opposite side of the box. Turning his head one way and another as the two went on, James wondered if they were still insulting the players.
,” he said mockingly. “I think I’d remember taking ill.”
His eyes caught Narcissa's again as she held her own addled son to her chest.
Harry signed something with stiff, jerky movements, avoiding everyone's eyes. Monty sent him a complicated glance before he translated slowly:
Handing over the letter meant the link could be made by anyone, even a Hufflepuff. Charming trusted Draco to keep their twice-weekly one-on-one arrangement confidential (there had to be a better way of phrasing that), and Draco just
"Trust a Gryffindor to make the noble choice," Nott said in that impossibly low voice, so at odds with his small chin. James's heart was racing as fast as his mind, thoughts flying by faster than he could hope to grasp. Fleetingly, he felt it was a waste of his final moments, to be unable to latch onto any coherent thought except
"It's a

, sort of way. Harry pushed through the entryway door into the dimly lit pub.
James deserted his empty mug on the coffee table and sat back, considering.
James pushed a hand through his hair, pulling at the locks in frustration. Twenty-four hours of pouting for being one hour tardy!
" - left us wae the nanny all day. When he woke up, he got all confused cos 'is watch said eight o'clock but no one was there. Thought it were eight in the
"Are ye?" he seemed delighted with the surprise. "An' what d'ye want wae ma boys?" The man lifted a section of the counter and stepped through, hurrying over to the door. In one smooth motion, he flipped the sign to closed and locked the door. Then he waved cheerily through the window at the disappointed face of a young woman on the other side. He was a stout man, average height with thick arms that were covered in coarse hair. Golden-brown curls on his head and rosy cheeks made him look like a child that had gotten hold of a wand and tried to disguise himself into an adult.
When the nightmares send him running from his bed, it's fifty-fifty odds that Potter will join him in the common room. There's something surreal about the castle in the dead of night. Years past, he spent countless hours under the glass windows of the Slytherin common room, watching the merfolk and dreaming of a simpler life. This isn’t like that. There's no soothing, fluttering green-blue light of the lake. Sometimes there's a fire, if Draco remembers to bring his wand. Other times, it's just Draco, the cold stone floor, the cold stone walls, and the windows looking out into a black sky. No merfolk passing by to remind him that nothing matters, that life carries on even while the world burns. Just him and an endless void of possibility. Of expectation. Of duty.
"You're recalling how to say it," Draco observed. "You remember this spell?" A nod, but those eyes went back to studying the cane again. "How do you feel about this spell?"
"Watch yer language, ye bloody bonsai tree!" Monty roared back with a huge grin. James snorted.
He couldn’t look up. He pulled and picked at the knit cap on his lap, working on a frayed edge.
With great effort, Mrs. Flamel opens her puckered mouth and tries to speak, but coughs instead. The coughing persists, her withered old face turning purple. At long last, she manages to swallow and catch her breath.
“My parents were driven out of business because of Voldecorp,” she begins. The room falls quiet, side conversations dropping off in a sudden hush. Bellatrix clears her throat pointedly, staring unblinkingly at the young woman. “They might return to India but if Voldecorp is just going to continue expanding globally, it’s hopeless.”
"Ugh, shut up," he said, his nose wrinkling at the thought of what had to have happened that led to their conception, which led to their birth, which led to Aarti Patel's death. "Tha's stupid."
It was his silo, with a log cabin on top.
"I'll open it, you grab her," he says.
Monty asked.
"Marge's retirin' from the boutique," Monty explained. "She's lookin' to sell and I've made her an offer."
The point being: Harry was back, more or less, and Ron was right not to give up on him.

, he said. Both boys' eyes nearly bugged out of their skulls; even Monty was dumb-founded.
There was an uncomfortable silence, the kind that made Monty's stomach hurt. Hermione's eyes were glistening in a horrible way. Alec had stopped scraping his fork listlessly around his plate, apparently frozen under so many stares. Monty cleared his throat loudly, coughed, then cleared it again.
Of course, as he will learn in the Days of Denny, it's his mouth that gets him into trouble more often than not.
This time, the silence seemed charged with tension. Alec and Arthur shared another look, feeling nervous. Dad didn't often lose his temper, but when he did...well, Helen was built mostly to explore the full electro-magnetic effects of James Charming's emotions. And she was already smoldering in the pantry. Arthur idly wondered if Dad had even pieced together Helen's true purpose or if he still thought she was just a mascot that Alec had built for a laugh...
Arthur said, gripping his hair in frustration. Dad opened and closed his mouth -
"Excuse me!"
"I'll never eat meat again," he says as Potter winds his trousers around his blistered hands and grips the metal wire. He crouches low so that the ventilation holes, the ones where a door handle should have been, are at eye-level. He inserts the metal wire and begins a long, arduous process that Draco can't even begin to understand. "Potter…?"

"The walls are solid and firm, stronger than any storm that might find you there. They're as tall as you'd like, and the windows fit snugly. Can you see if they're painted plaster, or stone, or something else?"
The old Harry Potter would've put the overbearing man in a Body Bind and left him in the pantry by now.
"Prism is a highly addictive illegal potion used as a temporary solution for a multitude of ailments."
It had been three-and-a-half days since James's kitchen revelation. Two nights of sleeping in the kitchen with the door locked so that no underage midnight snackers would catch on. Cushioning charms could only do so much to soften the wooden table, however, and now his back was in serious competition with his hip. He could hardly keep up with the boys that day, though he'd managed to keep them occupied in the kitchen while Monty worked the counter.
Harry stood abruptly, abandoning his tea and toast on the table.
“Draco!” Harry hisses desperately. “Draco, listen!”
But it doesn't come, of course, because Potter's too good for that. He lingers on the edge of the clearing, peering at Draco in a strange, indecipherable way as the half-giant prattles on about thestral maternity. Draco isn't sure he can stomach a double-period of this—another ninety minutes of Hagrid's rambling and Potter's staring and the truth of the thestrals screaming silently at him—it's all too much, too heavy, too empty and cold and unending—
"I think you did. Care to share? Malfoys don't mumble."
"Sarcasm."
"Don't patronize me, James," he snapped, dropping his hands.
Monty said with a strange glint in his eye.
Malfoy..." he grumbled, smacking the newspaper down.
"Brooms. I make brooms. Er, the flying kind. Obviously."
"No scam!" Arthur replied quickly, hands twisting in his obnoxiously yellow shirt. "I was helpin' Alec move some things around and - "
Harry flopped back on the grass and glared at the sky, and told her about Lenny.
James formed the letter D again and brought the curved part out, landing a few inches from his left pointer.
"You've chocolate on your lip," he says gently. Potter darts a tongue out, but misses. "Here…" He reaches out and grips Potter's jaw, brushing his thumb firmly over his bottom lip, as he did earlier. The bit of chocolate smears. He leans forward. Potter's eyes flick down.
The living space faced a magnificent stone fireplace that reminded him of Hogwarts - of the Gryffindor Common Room, in fact. He wondered if Pansy had paid a visit and filed that delightful thought away for a laugh later. There was a huge, deep green rug in the middle, and - the sofa from Blupin Frottage!
"Do you like school?" he asked, hefting him up a little higher.
A feral hiss and, seconds later, an ear-splitting meow rang out in the alley. There was a series of crashes and swears, and James smirked.
minutes."
he insisted.
Like it was yesterday, and it very well might have been, he remembers darting through the ring of dumbfounded Death Eaters, stumbling down the hill and into a Muggle village. He remembers hiding until dawn, hunched over behind a skip in his blood-soaked tournament uniform, ankle throbbing, drying sweat mixed with the grime on his skin like paste. And just as the sun came up, Danny found him. Offered him help, a clean towel, a phone call. Stole him away.
"She died when I was a baby," Scorpius reassured. "I don't really miss her." And that was...gods, that was somehow worse.
"From James," he said lightly. "I knew he'd send something."
It seemed to be all he could manage at the moment. James lived for that moment.
Potter's still staring at the ceiling (Draco assumes, as he can only see the back of that bird's nest) when he says, "We're locked in."
Malfoy paused, perhaps waiting to see if Harry was truly done talking, then said rather stiffly, "Certainly. Come on back to my office and we'll get started." He opened his arm in a gesture before retreating back down the hallway, and Harry followed.
, James thought, panic gripping him. This wasn't a gift, it was a trap. Was Monty seriously trying to spring this on him Christmas morning? In front of the boys?! He snapped the folder closed and offered a vague smile, trying not to let it slip into a grimace. Monty raised his brows expectantly but James didn't have anything nice to say so he said nothing at all.
"Their father."
"Did you choose it because it seemed familiar?" Remus asked. Harry screwed his mouth to one side and shrugged noncommittally. Remus went on, undeterred. "You can't see it in the picture here, but Harry had that same scar," he nodded at Harry's forehead, though the scar was obscured by his hair now. "He was the spitting image of his father, with his mother's green eyes. His friend Ron here," Remus pointed at the photo, "told me about that scar on your hand..."
James cringed. The Nighttime Incident. He hadn’t actually wet the bed, couldn’t they call it something else?
somehow.
“Oh my fuck!” Sirius croaked, crossing his forearms against his pale, scruffy face, and wailing with abandon. The swear jarred Harry for a moment, making him forget about his window. “Oh my fuck, Remus, oh my fuck! Oh my fuck!”
Potter's oddly calm now that Draco's entertaining his madness. Draco wonders if this is what he was like when he met the Dark Lord in the forest. It's not a good look, but if anyone can pull it off, it'd be Potter. Speaking of pulling off…
The Head Auror was no match for Hermione's rapid-fire questioning and that's when they learned about the collapsed house in Godric's Hollow, the six dead witches and wizards inside, the wand which
Montague was sentenced to one year, Vane ten. Both were talented potioneers - along with Nott - but Vane had a special talent and a long-time romantic (read, obsessive) vendetta against Harry Potter. She was the one who altered every single one of his pain potions last fall, leading to his close call after Helen's mauling. (Ron would forever treasure the memory of Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley explaining to the Wizengamot what a robot was and why it wasn't on trial as well.) Montague supplied the Polyjuice to disguise Anthony as Monty that winter, and they were only able to pin him with trafficking a regulated potion with malicious intent.
Draco caught the ghost of a smirk on James’s lips as Blaise sighed and left, taking his tea with him.
He threw the wand at the wall and the gushing sound broke off suddenly, as soon as the stick left his hand.
His Mind Healer had told him that another person's disapproval was not his responsibility. There was nothing for him to fix here, nothing he could do to fix it unless he backed down to make Remus happy.
Monty dropped the pot he was drying and it clanged to the tile floor, wobbling around on its rim until he stooped down to pick it up again. James squinted in
Charming. He had to call him Charming now. For as long as this legendary wizarding war hero preferred, he would be called Charming in this office instead of Potty. Potter. Draco would have to think of some new insults for him. Privately, of course; he was a professional, after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Monty pulled away and went to the sofa.
James signed to Abbott, who smiled indulgently at him.
Monty was worried. He was a worrier. A nurturer, too. And his nurturing side was telling him to fix James. His flighty bird was restless, he thought. Lucy was a quick and easy distraction, thanks to Hermione's suggestion. But while he was certainly fond of the Madagascar Red Owl (who he insisted on calling Anne) James needed something to keep him busy. From the moment he woke up in hospital twelve years ago, James was pushing, pushing, pushing himself. To walk, to work, to be a good dad, to stretch time itself to do even more.

"When did you change your mind?"
James saw on the telly once, years ago, a trashy daytime program that was pumping the studio audience full of wishy washy relationship advice right alongside recipes for Halloween treats. While James was taking notes on the recipes - nearly all of which ended up bunk - he idly listened to the host speaking with a woman in the audience who had recently divorced.
Dinner was shit. The whole day was shit. The stubborn arse must have slept on the floor because he came out of that bedroom just as tired and cranky in the morning as he had been last night, and it was making everything that much harder on Monty and the boys.
Charming frowned.
"Graham?" his new partner supplied flatly, obviously impressed. "Didn't you go to school with all three?"

He sneaked a glance to his other side, reaching out a quivering hand to find his dad, like he had when they had learned how to swim. But Dad was gone!

, that’s nice. Draco whines, then inhales sharply. He can barely feel the heat of the oven—the room—as he concentrates on building a rhythm. Potter’s panting and groaning is animalistic, filthy, degrading, and the sexiest thing Draco’s ever heard.
"Mine," Hermione practically squealed. "He's still around, his name is Crookshanks."
"No, Ben! No, I said NO! I'm not tired!" Harry manages to turn over on his stomach and tries to crawl out of the bed onto the floor again, but Ben just flips him on his back, catches both his wrists, and wrestles the blanket over him once more. "OFF! FU-- FUMP OFF!" Harry screams, trying the move again.
"It's

was the bastard?
Arty pursed his lips and James glared at him. It seemed to lose some heat through the traitorous tears.
That wasn't always the case, of course. Pansy was a disaster. Greg was an awkward experiment – he shivers just to remember it. But he began to hit his stride in Blaise.
They spent the rest of the evening eating luxurious chocolate and telling Harry and his family about themselves. Remus was quiet - Ron wondered if the story of Aarti’s passing was hitting close to home or if he was just overwhelmed by the chocolate - but Teddy forged a fast bond with the boys. George was their personal hero, it seemed, and Harry looked equal parts delighted and concerned about the inevitable trip to the Diagon Alley joke shop. Ron wondered if the twins knew yet that George himself had been a twin once, if there was some weird twin energy unfolding between them now.
Charming was funny! Potter had never been funny in his life, not once. Charming was witty and sarcastic and could be delightfully cutting sometimes. Potter was a blundering, semi-sentient Expelliarmus spell without an iota of humor.
"Draco, this is Lavender," Parvati says, leading a bright-eyed young woman over. "She's taking over Makeup so I can go back to Hair with Cedric."
The Muggle woman James had hired to mind the shop was around James's age and Draco chose not to torture himself over the fact that he was relieved to learn she was married. The Gryffindor ponce had enough gallantry in him that Draco feared he could get overly attached to a suitably sympathetic prospect, and six-months-along Beatrice had the same happy-go-lucky attitude that Gibbs had used to reel James in.
"Single bedroom? How many baths? Are you looking for something in the city, or - "
“Reckon they're from the Board?” Cho whispers.
Harry doubles back, the wheels of his cart squeaking louder as he approaches, eyes sparkling behind old NHS frames. Draco is glaring daggers into the drawer and Severus, like a bat, swoops over from Makeup to investigate.
Draco doesn't speak, but he steadies the moron when he slips on a frozen rock.
"Prism's a hell of a potion," Blaise said by way of explanation. "He's still in holding at the Ministry. Seeing as he hasn't been rushed to emergency, I suspect that's a good sign."
He didn't remember reaching behind him for his wand but it was in his hand now. The firepoker launched out of the stand like a bullet, rocketing at an upward angle through Nott's thigh. James threw himself on the floor and it sailed overhead. An awful wet sound, a nearly silent gasp, and then a heavy weight and a cold bar dropped on top of him.
It was one of his most treasured memories.
[scratched out ink]
But the story seemed to do the trick: James looked suitably impressed. Or was that panic?
Monty growled low in his throat, a sure sign of an impending explosion. Out of the corner of his eye, James saw Alec grab Arthur and make a hasty retreat down the hall with their books. He thought he heard Arthur mumble something about the telly exploding, but he could only think that he'd left his wand in the bedroom. If Monty advanced on him again, he wouldn't reach it in time… But this was ridiculous. They were two grown adults, they loved each other. He knew Monty wouldn't hurt him, just as Monty knew he wouldn't punch him in the face - however much he wanted to at the moment.
For years, that image would haunt Ron, whose fondest memories included bringing Harry home to the Burrow. Harry, his oldest and truest friend, the lad he followed into battle: slipping and writhing in a pool of blood on the floor of his parents' home. Dazed and disoriented, without even his name, but still just wanting what he'd come looking for that night, what he'd wanted his whole life.
“Take as long as you need - I’ll mind the shop!” he called over his shoulder. They listened to his descending footsteps and then James reluctantly set up his wand.
But Potter's not paying attention, the wanker. He's still standing, still staring with unfocused eyes at the locked door. Still clenching his perfect jaw, the picture of barely-contained panic.
"Dad, you're bein' a cunt!"
. Of course, that's when his brain caught up to him and he reared back, mortified.
"Does the mood ever strike you?" Kim asked.
Having the boys home for the summer meant feeling both on top of the world and perpetually exhausted. One year ago today, he'd celebrated his birthday with Alec, Arthur, Monty, and a comically huge box of pizza. He marveled at how much had changed in just twelve months. He was a new man. Literally.
Was Hermione right? Was he being selfish?
What was unusual were the extra chairs and place-settings crammed around the table.
Alec cooed dramatically as he unwrapped the series of hardcovers.
Monty's breath left him at the phrasing. 'Do not need you
“If your family knew what they were doing, they wouldn’t have been crushed by the competition.”
"Yer no' serious..." he said.
"You must have seen the
As much as it pained him to admit, he knew he owed so much of what he had to Monty's unending patience and support.
"Are ye foolin' round wae Malfoy?" he barked. James gritted his teeth. Not this shit, not after the hours he spent breaking his back to transform his shop, not today!
James settled in for what was turning out to be their longest appointment yet. He told Malfoy about hiding in his and Aarti’s flat like a hermit for a few weeks, paralyzed with fear, nearly forfeiting his job at the grocery. About learning how to strap both slings to him at once in order to safely carry both squalling demons to buy supplies at Tesco. About pawning off Aarti’s clothes in an act of desperation, earning enough to pay a girl in their building to watch the boys after school so James could get back to work. About the simultaneous relief and anxiety he felt when he left the boys with her every day.
"I died here."
He pulls away if Draco goes any further. Their perfect fit is left empty and cold as Harry oh so casually shifts to the other end of the sofa, kicking his feet up into Draco's lap and holding
He didn't think he could take it if they laughed at him today. It wasn't fair. He was giving them what they wanted. He was doing his best.
An hour later, the Aurors were called in.
"Yep," was all he could think to say. He was vaguely aware of another snort of laughter at his expense from the Muggle men across the room.
"It's the only room not made of gingerbread."
"Please, Harry," he whispered, eyes shining bright with actual tears. Ron cleared his throat and Harry saw him turn away, and suddenly his friend's embarrassment became his own. If he wasn't humiliated before, when he finally came strolling through the door of Blupin Frottage covered in mud to find he'd induced a manhunt, he certainly was now.
My eyes are crossing so I'll post this before my usual final proofread, and this whole story is unbeta-ed, so...enjoy some typos!
In a massive bookshop on the other end of town, he found an extensive business section. He spent nearly an hour roaming the aisles and pulling down books on entrepreneurial ventures and small businesses, accounting, even contracting and renovating.
"Well, fancy seeing you here!" Beatrice called out from the front room, full of energy despite just having come back from maternity leave that week.
James stared between the formal invitation and the huge vase of flowers that Draco's eagle owl had carted in at lunch. Weeks of trading stiff letters had led to this: Malfoy Senior himself, stooping low to fix what his sharp-tongued son had done. He could only imagine what conversation had prompted such an act of desperation.
Poor little old Marge.
“Remus?” Harry squinted at the thin figure standing off to the side. Sirius was still blubbering into his own arms, careful not to touch him. Harry felt a tad guilty about that and wondered if the Healer would go and tell her gossipy coworkers that he had snapped at his godfather. Wait… “Sirius! Sirius, you have to go! Now!” he whispered, lurching forward to seize him by the shoulders. Sirius froze mid-sob and peeked through his arms at him with watery grey eyes, not even breathing. Useless mutt! Harry turned to Remus. “Get him out of here before he gets caught!” he hissed.
"Bugger off, creton!" Draco snapped, rescuing his new box from those greedy hands.
I'll be putting together a oneshot sequel so we can see a very Drarry Christmas, in which James gets his first Arthur Charming Original Tattoo! I'll add it onto this story as part of a series so I think if you subscribe, you should get a notification about it...?

"The unicorn."
“Lemonhead?” Albus offers a bag of bright yellow sweets. Minerva abstains, but the couple accepts one lemon drop each. “What brings you here today, Mr. and Mrs. Flamel? I understand you are among the first participants in our new estate sale project?”
Dad used the white pencil to fix a mistake, surreptitiously checking to see if Arthur had noticed.
They landed in a tangled heap on soft, muddy ground, the overcast sky appearing as just a ring of light above. Harry swore and Draco whined, their voices bouncing off the surrounding stones. His jumper was most certainly ruined.
"I'm art."
"What now?" he says lowly out of the corner of his mouth.
Monty grunted in the affirmative. That was certainly true. James was sleeping at normal hours, eating regularly, and back to his obsessive cleaning. The shop, the kitchen, and the flat upstairs sparkled. More importantly, James was no longer pale and saggy, and they were once more enjoying their nighttime shenanigans. (And sometimes morning and afternoon shenanigans, now that the boys weren't underfoot.)
"Then we spent the summer recovering. Funerals, memorials...it was a difficult time, we were coming out of a dark period in our history and our world was rebuilding itself. Harry was just seventeen, but he was a legend. Not a person in our world didn't know his name. He'd always been famous, of course, but - "
“Don’t what, Harry?” Remus asked.
"She tries to put Hansel in an oven. To cook him."
" he said scathingly. "Yer bein' a cunt and I stand by what I said!" Alec gently deposited the letters in his hand back onto the table, but to his credit, he didn't back away. He was grateful to his brother. It was easier to face Dad's wrath together.
case? He was hoping for Hermione.
Monty was taken aback for a moment at the ferocity of James's signing, but reminded himself that the man had been through quite an ordeal that day. He was cranky and he just needed to get home and rest. They could fight this battle another day.
Monty nodded slowly, pasting a determined mask over his trepidation.
"Oh my god..." one of them whispered gleefully, turning away from the disaster that was Harry finding his old nemesis under a twinkling electric chandelier that was far too much for the kitchen.
she shouted back, hands coated in product as she twisted her hair into a desperate plait. She heard Ron groan - which meant it was a massive, melodramatic groan, seeing as he was on the sofa and she was up the stairs, down the hall, through the master bedroom, and in their private loo - but the phone stopped ringing a moment later when he answered it.
James shook his head firmly. No, he most certainly would not share a bed with him. Not until he figured some things out. Not until he'd had some
in his head, he went clammy and dizzy and sick.
"If you're concerned about your hygiene, we'll have to cover that in our next session," Malfoy finally said, his tone clipped and cold.
, Da'?" Alec sighed. "I mean, ye believe 'em, right? About Harry Potter?"
"Did you swipe the rug from Slytherin, or something?" he joked, peering over at Draco, who pursed his lips and didn't answer. Harry threw his head back and roared with laughter, his belly aching with the force of it.

it reads in purple ink. The calligraphy is well done, but there's no signature. She turns back to the gift, brow furrowed.
James sighed and reached over his head to get another pot down. He was preparing Monty's favorite ganache for the next round of chocolates and he always made a small batch just for him.
"No jealous," he defended, avoid James's glare. "Jus' think therapists need tae respect the boundaries. An' the lout broke yer nose once, James!"
"We want to learn magic," Alec said flatly. Neither of them were much in the mood to deal with their dad's weird issues. Arthur was 96% certain the other Muggleborns didn't have to worry about whether their parents would bug out and keep them home because of some dirty politics that went down a lifetime ago!
And James's wand was still abandoned in the kitchen after he was pathetic and stupid enough to be disarmed.
When Ron and Hermione visited the Charming household that evening, it was without a reply to her self-invitation. James seemed grouchy and unsurprised when they arrived at the front door, but he offered them tea, set up the translation spell, and began a fumbling explanation.
The mood turned somber, but James swallowed the urge to change the subject. Those words from the woman on the telly, long ago, rang in his head:
“He gave me potions to stunt my growth.” There, that shut him up. Sirius was dangerously close to devolving into another monotone chant; Harry just couldn’t take it, not when he was still waiting for the sun to come out from behind those stupid clouds. “Been stuck in puberty for over half my life now.” He forced a laugh. It sounded as hollow as it felt.
Thank you for your comments!  (I literally read them dozens of times throughout the day to inspire me.)
"The boots are nice, a perfect replica of his favorites, I'll admit."
The lamp flickered again and then stayed on, steady, revealing the full devastation of their room. The water was beginning to recede, escaping through the cracks in the door and floorboards. Fuck. This was going to cost a

“Mmm,” Pansy tries to moan, but it turns into a half-smothered laugh. “It’s a wet dream come true.”

Arvel Siddall, of Cardiff: "I'll wager ten Galleons that was a Muggle man with him. I can spot [Muggles] a mile away, see. Not that I have anything against [Muggles]! And if I didn't know any better, I'd've wagered his kids were Muggleborn too. But they were definitely his kids, couldn't be anyone else's. Might've been triplets with enough aging potion! Their first trip to Diagon Alley, I'd wager. [Potter] must have kept them far from the wizarding world in order to get that proper Muggleborn look on their faces. Can't say I blame him, that was a bit much back there, that crowd. Maybe the Muggle world is a simpler life for him, you know? Always struck me as the type who'd like a simple life. I can spot a kindred spirit a mile away."
"Aw, not Power Grid!" Arthur moaned, flopping into the seat beside Dad.
Because they were obviously in love, Harry and Monty. The Scottish man was loud, boisterous, full of a raucous energy that could only be compared to fireworks or a very close Quidditch match. Harry met him tit for tat, answering it all with looks, touches, and signs. He fed off of it, sometimes he signed back and seemed to push for more. Ron knew when someone was taking the piss, even silently and in another language, and Harry had plenty of practice with Monty and his boys. It was everything Ron had ever wanted for Harry: a family, a happy life, a noisy kitchen, plenty of chocolate.
She wanted to fix it all for him, to force the universe into alignment so everything was really was fine, so Ron was well rested and happy again. She felt useless. This was all Anthony's fault. If he weren't already dead, she'd drop him in the Forbidden Forest without a wand for what he'd done to Harry, and to Ron.
But, he did trust the man, so they signed the forms and went to lunch. The energy left fluttering in him from their meditation was dampened only by the knowledge that he couldn't bear to betray Draco's trust in
And of course, it

"Thought you'd like to know about Greg," his friend sighed. Draco spared him a glance before going back to his work.
"We're married," he whined. "You'd think you could just do me a solid now and again."

"Something's happening!" he hisses. "You were right!"
Finally, after reading the report three times over, Charming tucked it back into the folder and nodded, sliding the file back across Draco's desk.
Indian jewelry, we’ve got a massive inventory and the resources to stock this region,” Parvati says evenly. “All high quality, genuine. We were doing very well until you started installing jewelry counters in Voldecorp stores.”
"I think he'd'a still ended up working in the bakery," Alec sighed. "He worked there before we were born."
His mouth was downturned and sour, his eyes cast low.
Draco thought, disappointed.

"How about no."
Monty clapped a warm hand on James's shoulder but James didn't look up. George was screaming with laughter, Ron and Hermione were holding each other up through their tears, Teddy's hair was inexplicably white.
James blinked. Of course he was. If he hadn't been sure before, Arty's bug-eyed expression was proof enough.
"Your department's just you, isn't it?" Harry calls across the Beauty floor as he pushes his cart of Women's inventory toward the back room.

Corporate cuts back on employee hours, sparking a tentative alliance between foes.
"The witch who runs the post office in Hogsmeade caught me on my walk," Remus elaborated as he waved a sealed piece of parchment. "Haz Blue? The Blue threw her off, but Sirius has called you Haz around the village enough that she figured it was yours." Harry crouched and reached his hand down through the rungs of the bannister, and Remus stood tall on his tip-toes to hand it off.
Monty asked, tapping the top of the box. James waved him off, worried he would ruin the intricate decoration if he tapped too hard.
It was a long time before James responded but Monty was patient.
Draco smirked and James sent him a quelling look.
"Yes, but not enough to—to

“Your Weasels.”
"If that's all..." Harry braced his hands on the cushion beneath him and, at Remus's nod of dismissal, pushed himself up and made for the floo.
He opens his mouth to protest, but hesitates, considering…
James nodded.
Draco shivers, but the soft leather of the armchair is comforting. It’s of supreme quality. He bats Potter’s hand off the stain, aiming for another peek at the strange design as the old crone goes on. Perhaps it’s a tradesman’s mark?
"Prescribed by St. Mungo's and filled by Starr's Apothecary," she corrected as she sent the vials floating out of the room and down the hall. "We don't have much in the way of your family history, Mr. Charming, but it's possible you are susceptible to hemophilia given the wrong combination of potions. It's rare, but that's our working theory for now."
“You shouldn’t lean on the table like that,” is his only reply.
busy man, despite there being no customers in the vicinity.
After another half hour, the first workshop session came to a close and Arthur joined them, gushing about making some adjustments to his portrait. They made another round of the exhibits so Arthur could see everything - at least he could appreciate the strange, colorful pieces that fluttered through the air and scraped across the floor, even if Alec and Dad were starting to go cross-eyed - before calling it a day. Dad exchanged some brief words with Dean using his translation spell (facing away from the meager Sunday crowd, in case of reporters), and they went home.
In the Danny Days of Old, Harry is still finding his bearings. It doesn't seem so long ago that Voldemort was killed in the graveyard after the Third Task. When he closes his eyes, he still sees Cedric's lifeless eyes, still sees echoes of his parents blossoming out of Voldemort's wand. He still hears the awful squelching, tearing sound as his panicked

you!"
Alec nodded dutifully. Arthur sent him a grateful look before shoving past Dad and heading upstairs to get to work. Dad's standards for chores were ridiculous, especially when he was on a tiff.
“Of course.” He gestured broadly around the kitchen. “Think you can handle this room alone?”
Harry shook his head firmly. A spike of anger had him biting his tongue. Sirius reached out and Harry ducked away before he could do something tragic like
"You’re meant to hang it up when you've finished," she sighed, placing the phone on its wall-mounted cradle. Ron looked up and she caught the unnatural pallor beneath his freckles. "Ron?"
, Alec said vaguely. The others were watching curiously and the air was slightly tense.
Potter shuts his gob and the room is eerily silent. Those lips, still glossy with syrup, are pressed firmly together and his face looks oddly naked without his glasses. The little indentations on his nose make him look softer. Sleepier. Draco wonders if he can get him to sleep at all tonight or if even the mattress is too much for him now. He regrets snapping at him. Whether the danger is real or imagined, the terror certainly is.
"Let's get you thawed, my dumplings," the woman says, hobbling ahead.
Draco nodded, as if this was a perfectly valid reason to turn down a home. "Let's see if we can find something with ample light, then..." He began flipping through several files, tossing the rejects carelessly into another pile.  "Have any other preferences occurred to you since our last meeting?"
Monty grumbled darkly.
Just another reason to toss Blaise out on his cold, uncaring, perfectly shaped arse. "Good day."
your - you deserve it all. Without my input. But, you weren't granted any experience."
"And - and after I deigned to share my finest Elvish vintage with you - "
Potter is not shocked enough by the Muggle car that finds them in the depths of the Forbidden Forest. Surprised, certainly, but more relieved than outright shocked. Draco means to interrogate him, but then Potter drops this line:
Lunchtime came and went and the boys didn't leave their room. Dad didn't come to the door or text them. Arthur thought he might still be standing in the living room. It was dinnertime before Alec made the next trek out. He came back with sandwiches, said he'd left one for Dad, who was sitting on the sofa with his recipe notebook. Said Dad didn't say anything when he gave him a plate. Said Dad looked a million miles away.
He's wearing these childish clothes and wonders, but has learned not to ask, where they came from. Who they came from. The underground bunker smells like concrete and dust, not old sweat or - or blood. But perhaps there
"So you like it?" Scorpius whispered reverently.
.” He lends reverence to his voice, as if this is an auspicious position. “You’re sort of above all that, right? They can’t do anything to you...so long as you have a department to be manager of.”
Harry threw himself forward and back, forward and back, waiting longer and longer each time before he caught himself on the back-swing. Finally, he answered,
Draco blinks, baffled. Harry stands, scooping the bag from the table as his other hand darts under one end of the centerline gap. He pulls. A squeak, a spring-like release, and the table suddenly folds up, sending Draco crashing to the floor.
Dad asked after half an hour of loitering - er, appreciating. Alec shook his head, poking a replica niffler made of hippogriff feathers that was hovering near his elbow. This was more Arthur's scene than his and that was alright. Not everything had to be a winner. Maybe they could go to the fabrication lab downtown tomorrow.

Silence descended again and Remus watched Harry's face intently as this unspoken but definite line was crossed. He cringed, waiting for the inevitable explosion of Harry's infamous temper...
"My job..."
For now.
"Don'it 'sposed to get colder at night?" he wondered. Draco had an arm around his shoulders, slumping against him and making him go all tingly, and Harry had his arm around Draco's waist, which felt perfectly wrong. He couldn't say who was holding up whom, just that it was very warm and easy to laugh and easy to make
"You ever been smacked, Malfoy?" Harry shot back. The look on Malfoy's face was well worth this trip to the Dreary Poop Farm, but quick as a flash it morphed into something more playful.
"Sacked?" George asked, leaning around Alec's protruding elbow.
A familiar chorus of
Lupin said awkwardly. He was an awkward bloke in general.
“Yes…”
Draco cocked his head and waited, his silence urging James to continue.
"Sounds about right, for that one," Harry offered, and gods did he hope he was pulling off a casual tone. "The git can't go a few months without causing an international crisis."
He nearly leapt out of his skin when two arms encircled him from behind. The touch was more tentative than secure. He turned, looking down at James with a sneer automatically taking over even as his mind screamed words at him like
So they'd started interrogating their own - for who else could have gotten past the shop's wards to attack Harry? Who else could have broken into a guarded storage room and Vanished the blood samples that were collected from the crime scene twelve years ago? Who else could have planted and trained an eye witness that knew every detail of a confidential case? Tony was heading up most of the interviews between the Aurors and the rest of the Department, leaving Ron to tackle the Prophet-driven leads.
Dad looked down and then back up, smirking knowingly. Instead of answering, he offered him the ladle. Warm brown goop was dripping from the spoon and Arthur raced forward to take a sip.
An old metal cash register was just as good as a club, even if it was more delicate than a simple
still you, obviously, just…" Draco's shoulders rose while he searched uselessly for the right words. "This was easier when we were sloshed… Well. Regardless. We both agreed it was weird at best, and you assured me that my calling you by your given name would only lead to me finally seeing what an annoying twat you are - as if I could forget," he said with a smirk. "You weren't particularly precise with your words, to be honest, but new beginnings and...and all that comes with it, is what I gathered."
"Nobody invites their therapist out tae a game, James," he explained. "Ye saw 'im more like a friend than yer doctor...a think it was time he backed off. No' professional."
“Rachel?”
“And reduced hours, to boot. All this free time and no one to - "
, he signed, testing out the new spell. His own holly wand spelled out the word next to his head in gold smoke. In his opinion, the wand thoroughly deserved to be banished to a dark corner in his flat, but instead it was on a grand tour for the sake of these appointments. He kept it in his back pocket while traveling (he had written a whole three pages to the boys to tell them about the Knight Bus), only pulling it out once he had settled into the appointment with Healer Malfoy. He dreaded to think of what would inevitably happen when he was faced with another flashback while carting around a magic-conductor, but after the row with Monty, he wasn’t going to give in and bring him along to translate.
Harry grunted, then sighed. "It's just… When we first met, I had my hat on, and he didn't recognize me. So, I told him - " He braced himself to keep from throwing Ron off the roof for the impending humiliation. "I told him my name was Haz Blue."
"Yes - er, what? I mean, I'm - I'm looking for a house," Harry stammered out without even knowing it was true until he said it.
“But he won’ - ”
After an interminable silence, Sirius's eyes darted up to meet his.
Charming signed and Gibbs suddenly went watery in the eyes. When he spoke, it was choked and horrible and made Draco uncomfortable: "Ah...havin' a hard time wae the boys bein' gone. Ne'er been away from 'em. Can ye help wae that, doc?"
"We all know Aurors are the reigning experts on mental health," Malfoy interrupted in a clipped tone. He seemed to be preparing a long speech and Ron wanted to die.
Depressive episodes brought on by daytime flashbacks, they'd touched on that in their earliest sessions.
"Well," Monty said after an awkward pause. "Tuck in!"
do while commenting on how studious his little bird looked when he was hunched over the books.
"Your…your Muggle family didn't have enough?" Draco should've guessed why all those Weasley jibes were hitting so close to home for Potter: the boy who dressed in rags at Madam Malkin's shop.
"Whatever, mate, just tell me how they get the frosting like this?" Ron would -
“Er….” he said intelligently, drawing it out for far too long. He hadn't prepared for a wheelchair. Did that change anything...? No, right? No, of course not, but now he'd forgotten what he was meant to -

Unbelievable, that James assumed he would come back to bed now after he spent six hours lounging in the kitchen with Malfoy. He and Malfoy were arguing about
"The point, Severus," Arthur interrupts before Parvati can retort, "is not to see profits improve, but to see
His shirt has ridden up slightly and he has to peel his bare lower back and thighs off the brick before he can crawl to their island of safety. His palms are burned, much like Potter's feet, and he suspects there's a distinct brick-pattern seared into his skin if Potter's wide, staring eyes are any indication.
"Some spaces have the most exquisite angles the higher you look," Pansy the mad genius said. "What's up there? What lights up your space when the sun goes down?"
All in all, with the added Slytherin company, things were a bit strange tonight. Blaise matched Seamus one-to-one on shots of exotic spirits, which sent little Seamus babbling all night and left Blaise standing suspiciously still. Dean was poking through the comics, sketchbooks, and coloring pages stacked up on the kitchen table. Harry and Malfoy were seated on the other end in a heated discussion on something he couldn't read in the translation from across the room - if Ron's knowledge of sign language could be trusted, it was about either plumbing or footwear. And Ron was pretending to talk to Monty who was pretending to listen while he peeled the label off a bottle of Ogden's and watched Harry.
The last thing Draco wanted to do was to put a wand back in this man's hands. He knew personally how much damage that could bring unto
"I'm sorry."

"Is that - is that chair from the Burrow?" he asked incredulously. He darted over and sank into the familiar plush armchair he'd always loved.
Draco handed over the damn letter.
"That's to be expected..."
hormone potions."
It certainly doesn't matter to Harry, anymore. But he still wonders.
Ron snorted and shared a knowing look with Hermione. So maybe Harry had been just as clueless in his day... It was oddly comforting that James Charming's personality before July 1998 was not as mysterious as he thought it was.
Monty's eyes were shining brightly and he felt a tug of guilt.
"Humans are social creatures," she said, not for the first time. "It's not something we say for bits and giggles - " and Harry knew it wasn't bits, but rather shits, and he cracked another little smile at her insistence on playing along with his quirks, " - but pretty fast, without any input, the brain will start sending random signals. Firing off whatever it can to produce
“In her job?”
, a lifetime of it that others couldn't even begin to grasp - but Sirius looked at him in such a pleading way that he fell silent. Begrudgingly, he listened.
Magical security meant invisible wards. The wards on his shop were the opposite of what most of the wizarding world used; they were designed to repel witches and wizards, instead of Muggles. Several people were exceptions to this ward, including himself, his boys, the Weasleys, the Lupins, McGonagall, and a contingent of Aurors. Ron promised to escort the Malfoys through today.
Potter's status yields just two Ministry-grunts to check out the forest, and the pair finds nothing to corroborate their story. No gingerbread house. No cannibalistic crone. No leather and ivory furniture, no lamps pocked with nipples, no giant cauldron. No oven. No metal spring mattress.
"The unicorn?" It feels like he's talking about something other than a sparkly magic horse now, but it's cold and Draco can't be arsed to figure it out. Potter doesn't answer.
"You should keep your wand in a drawer or something instead of on the bedside table," Hermione suggested lightly, offering the wand back. James didn't take it and she placed it on the table. "Keep it somewhere close by, of course, but where you can't reach it while you're dreaming. Plenty of witches and wizards have found themselves sleepwalking with their wands..." She rattled off some story about a witch who wandered into a Muggle circus in the dead of night and released all of the animals, only to wake up the next morning without a clue.
"LET US OUT!" Potter throws himself into the iron door, bouncing back only to throw himself again, and again, and again, and—
Harry frowned. “What d’you mean ‘again’?”
Alec wondered idly.
"Spare me," he said, pulling a face.
he went on, pushing down all the complicated feelings that came along with the years of rejection that James had subjected him to.
Nott faltered as he reached for Alec, seeing something in James's face that gave him reason to reconsider. James felt mad with fear and anger. He wasn't sure what he'd do, but he knew in that moment he was capable of anything short of growing claws.
Monty grabbed the piping bag and cut off a large piece of the point.
He could work on that in their next session.
"I didn't ask ye tae actually
Harry Potter.
Draco takes pride in helping him find release. Honestly, he doesn't know how Harry would survive without him...the Weasels would probably come to drag him to Sunday lunch only to find him curled up in a solid ball of twisted, achey muscles. So Draco can't understand why Harry invites a touch to his neck, then an arm around his waist, even a hand gripping his arse, but not the icing on the cake. He settles into Draco's side, a perfect fit. He hums at the kiss to his ever-windswept hair. He closes his eyes and puffs a happy little sigh when Draco crooks his arm to card his fingers through his stupid hair.
, crashing into him relentlessly. Mum started cursing the family clock, cursing herself for not having added Harry's name. George had to physically restrain Ginny from running off to who knows where, wand drawn. Dad looked...utterly broken, in that moment, in a way Ron hadn't even seen at Fred's funeral.
he asked.
He decided, after much Inner Screaming, to ask Monty for help. The man was technically his employee after all, he could handle counting down the drawer and marking some notes. It took everything he had to sacrifice his pride, creep into the kitchen, and confess.
Each boy, despite dressing like buffoons on opposite ends of the buffoon spectrum, had the same warm brown skin and the trademark mop of black hair that Potter Senior sported. He wondered if their eyes were that same bright green too. It would be fitting, he mused, that Potter managed to come back from the dead (again) three times more powerful and annoying than before.
"Butter is good," Harry said. He was staring openly. Two men in the kitchen snorted in unison.
At some point, his anger shifts into something else entirely.
The effect of those words was instantaneous. James covered his face again and slouched over the table, looking defeated and exonerated all at once. She glared daggers at Ron and moved her tea aside, shifting closer to James to run a hand up and down his back.
The boys grimaced and Monty rolled his eyes. "You'll wan' James then," he said.
Alec floundered for a moment and Monty hummed in warning when he saw that bony shoulder start to lift in another shrug. Alec looked heavenward for a moment, as if praying for an answer that wouldn't rat out his brother.
He'd been training Harry to invite Draco out for drinks, but he hadn't considered (because Harry hadn't told him) that Draco only knew him as Haz Blue. So Hogsmeade, despite the locals' unwavering protectiveness of his privacy, was out of the question, since he was Harry to everyone there (except to Sirius, and now apparently the witch who ran the post office). And any wizarding place outside of Hogsmeade was ill-advised...he wouldn't try his luck with another Florean Fortescue situation.
His words, not mine."
His voice carries a note of finality and Draco falls silent. They stop bellowing the fire and it begins to peter out. They move on, warm and notably less prickly than before. Potter drifts from the path again. It's been at least an hour since they left, perhaps they should turn back—
"No! No, no, NO!" he screamed hard enough to tear his throat. He was yanking hard on his hair, desperate for a flash of pain to stand out amongst the rest of it. "I don't want this, I SAID
he hisses.
“The romance author. She has a whole series of medical rendezvous. I’m certain you’ll like her work.”
"No, not usually."
here for anyway.”
“He doesn’t stock my department, so he’s not mine to punish when he needs punishing. Which is a pity, because I’m the only one who stands a chance against those big green doe eyes…”
Dad ordered, giving the pot another stir. Arthur raced around the kitchen and collected everything onto a tray to bring upstairs to the others.
going on here, even if James refused to acknowledge it. He may not have even recognized it, always seeing the good in people. But Draco Malfoy would make his move soon. Being James's Mind Healer, the prat would know just how to manipulate him into getting what he wanted.
Ron, still managing to be bleary with sleep, was giving him some sort of significant look. Ever oblivious, Harry just turned his head, prompting her to continue.
James swallowed and wished he could feel as happy as he thought he would when he was imagining Monty's reaction to the surprise. He thought he would soak up Monty's joy and carry it with him to Christmas, when the boys came home. Instead, it felt like a cheap consolation prize after a stupid row in which nobody won.
Remus left the office with a happy flutter in his chest, browsing the rest of the list. He set an ambitious goal for himself: three visits in one day. That would certainly earn him a guilt-free box of chocolates from his favorite shop. A spring in his step, Remus set out to Kent to visit one
“It’s temporary but could turn permanent. She’s considering retirement.” Remus kept his voice carefully light as he waved his wand to pour fresh tea for them both. Harry heard a creak from upstairs; Sirius would join them soon. He stood and skirted around the table, fetching a third mug to buy some time.
, James thought.
"Would you?"
Arthur growled lowly as he stroked the cat, but when he spoke next, he sounded a little less antagonistic. "Al an' a found her wae some lads on the way home from school."
“Come on down, let them have some privacy,” Weasley ordered from the ground floor.
"Yeah, but you're an Unspeakable," her husband scoffed. "You're meant to say stuff like that."
"Da'?" Alec whispered from Teddy Lupin's borrowed form. "Alright?"
Regarding the chapter title:
Remus thought he heard the ceiling creak, as if someone were walking around upstairs right above him. He didn't give it much thought - there were at least two Charming children in residence, after all. Then the boy climbed to his feet and lifted his head, looking perfectly contrite, and Remus felt all the air in his lungs whoosh out at once. He had seen that look a thousand times, he himself had helped James Potter
"Yeah, just a measly little interdimensional postal service, just the one - "
"I don't remember any such story."
"Hermione!" Ron croaked from the sitting room, his voice still raw. "Phone!"
“Oh Merlin, Harry…” His view was obscured by a tall man with dark hair. The man fell to his knees in front of him, clutching his hands, wrists, and arms, as if he couldn’t quite believe he was solid, all while chanting his name over and over again. Harry felt a spike of unease in the pit of nothingness inside him; he pulled his arms back and scowled down at the man.

"Near enough. And if it's an oven, it'll get hotter."
"If you weren't mentally twenty-one after Azkaban, how can I still be fourteen in my head?"
This gives Severus pause and Draco looks between them, his anger dwindling to panic as he sees Harry's punishment slip away.
"I used to hallucinate," he offered speculatively. "In the bunker."
His stomach did a big fluttering flip, ten times more powerful than when Sirius had first called him Haz. Haz, not Adam, or Addy, or 'Adam Marcus Schmidt!' when he was in trouble. Haz was his very own, and it felt even truer than 'Harry' after years of screaming that that was his name.
"And then we're thrust back into the world with others and it doesn't know how to cope, I think, with actual sensory input. It's blingin' stressful."
as Charming. That would require some sort of mission or Ministry-sanctioned coverup. He was just a confused idiot.
"Yes, you're like all the others, I can…" She sniffs grandly. "Ohhh, I can smell it now… I was hoping you'd grant me a chance to explain. So eager to judge these days, even when—" her voice stutters and her eyes fill with tears. Draco feels like an arse. The nodding bobbles, shifts into something else, and she shakes her head instead, as if to clear it. "It's a lost art, you know. Cooking magic."
Harry nodded. Agreeing seemed the right thing to do.
"Mr. Lupin!" McGonagall hissed as a figure approached from the other side of the door.
His voice cracks,
Ron couldn't tear his gaze away from his partner. The firepoker stuck out on either side of his torso. He was slumped over in a grotesque angle, a pool of blood in the shadowed space under him. There was nothing left of his shoulder, just a glimpse of white bone and a severed arm out in the corridor.
Ron took a series of quick notes, cursing Tony for just standing there, pale and jittery, looking ready to keel over. Too far gone, the useless git.
"Dad, catch!"
Arthur translated easily, watching his dad as he went on and on:
"Come look!" Scorpius ran over, all bundled up rather adorably in a puffy Muggle coat and a wool hat. He grabbed them both, one little mittened-hand for each of them, and pulled them outside into the snow.
"But d'you remember..." Draco paused again to smother a small belch, "...Myrtle's bathroom?" Grey eyes met green like they had years ago...in a grimy mirror.
He opens it.
and he can - oh Merlin's beard, he can feel
, Harry began, resting his gaze in Malfoy's general direction. He was staring at the man's throat rather than making eye contact.
But Harry does answer, finally, and the answer leaves Draco wishing he hadn't.
“What’s wrong?”
“Appearances matter,” Draco says in a rather snooty voice. From behind him, Blaise places a hand on his shoulder, shaking his head minutely as if it say,
"You."
"I can hardly forgive you if I don't know what you've done."
He kept an eye on the little mirror next to the shop door from afar while he worked the counter, as if it were foe glass. He held entire conversations with Anne (albeit one-sided and in sign language) because he knew she was listening, just as Hedwig had.
He hasn't seen the sun since, but it hasn't been very long. He still has hope. He just needs to survive this lunatic long enough to escape.
"How exactly did you find me?" he asked softly. He'd never let himself linger on the details of his case or even his rescue for long. But he found the subject didn't make him quite so sick to think about what Ron and Hermione - his best friends, even after all of this - had to do with it.
"Your father was an animagus, you know," Lupin said a little too casually from across the table. James raised his brows, trying to appear less interested than he was.
“Stay here. Wand at the ready.” He nodded but didn’t pull his wand until she sent a stinging hex his way. He ducked, knicking his finger on the grater, and swore silently even as he whipped out his wand.
"Pureblood propaganda," she said dismissively. Harry - he insisted it was alright to call him Harry again - spared a glare for the newspaper as he worked to calm two-year-old Hugo from his tantrum. "Marietta Edgecomb is taking advantage of your situation to make Muggles look bad and Purebloods superior."
He heaved a great sigh and finally nodded, then turned to head for their room. He needed a hot bath. As he reached for the doorknob, he saw the white of an eyeball peeking through a crack in the door down the hall. Monty grinned over James’s shoulder and flashed a quick thumbs up. The eyeball widened and James frowned.
Ron drained his glass and set it aside, striding forward to haul Malfoy to his feet.
“Ms. Granger has suggested we try to recover lost memories of all sorts, both the banal and the dramatic. Is this something you’re interested in?”
"Him," he finally said, looking at Terry while pointing at Malfoy. Terry raised their perfect brows and Malfoy furrowed his. With the receptionist's question answered, Harry turned to Malfoy. "I want a house. Er, well, it doesn't have to be a house, I reckon, but a home anyway." As soon as he said it, however, he knew he detested the idea of a flat in a building shared with strangers. "A house," he amended, speaking over Malfoy's reply.
Blimey, when had the world got so weird?

"As we discussed, this is an old asper farm," Malfoy explained slowly. Harry's mouth formed a little "oh" shape. He had

Monty was watching him with that disappointed frown and James offered a nod.
"I knew it!"
"Well..." she began, eyes darting down to James on the bed. James blinked owlishly up at her. He was full of blood replenishing potions and still out of it. There had been so much blood in the sink… "Our other theory would mean calling the Aurors in. So let's hope it's just a bad combination. Either way, we'll get you fixed right up."

"No magic."
Draco recites.
Grinning like a loon, James opened a blank text to no one and proceeded to teach Draco Malfoy, the current heir to the Malfoy-Black fortunes, how to text.
"Saw that."
Monty contested hotly.
nonsense, we have children too, you know." James glared at the table. "He may have started it, but you finished it. You told him to leave. Do you regret that now?"
Shoving away the hands that dragged him out of hell, he throws himself to the ground. The ground, not the floor. The ground.
"They need tae learn anyway! All these weird accidents happenin', it's only gonna get worse - "
inviting him over for an impromptu boozy chocos night. But Harry and Malfoy wrote each other constantly, so how was Ron to know that he hadn't yet told the ferret about Monty?
"Er, what's happening?" Ron asked, looking over his shoulder at the door Arty and James had disappeared through on their way upstairs.
“Cramp! Cramp!” is all he can manage right now. Potter shifts under him, grunts as if in pain, and then his shifting becomes more urgent. Draco’s cock is enjoying the activity despite the pain in his leg, but Potter clearly isn’t.
While digging out the ladder to hang the new signs, he crashed his hip into the counter and had to sit down for several minutes. The pain nearly made him vomit and he cursed himself for forgoing the pain potion
- told him yesterday how excited Teddy was to practice a bit of Auror-sanctioned trickery.
It was a testament to Dumbledore's old drugged candy that Remus didn't fall to the floor in a dead faint at the sight before him. Harry Potter limped over to the other side of the table and began distributing plates, giving his guests a polite but vague smile. He was much older than when Remus had seen him last - obviously twelve years older, he was just about thirty now! His untamed hair was streaked with greys and his forehead creased into wrinkles as he took in their expressions. Harry shot a questioning look at Monty, who shrugged and made a quick, strange gesture with his hands in reply. Whatever it was, it must have made sense to Harry because he gave a careless shrug in reply and finished placing the plates.
James had never heard Monty like this. His voice, always loud but warm, was scratchy and hoarse. He was laying into the swears like they were fuel, like they were weapons.
"No," he said, unbridled joy evaporating.
"Are you thinking of me as a kid because I act like one, or - or because you're my godfather and you're always kind-of supposed to?" Harry suggested. Ironically, he felt like a fraud to be having this discussion with his godfather, a proper adult (more or less), but the silence was answer enough. He waited him out.
"You are complaining?" Viktor asks in a thick accent.
when?"
"There's two o' ye?" he cried in mock-horror. George grimaced and shook his head, but provided no explanation.
Charming shrugged noncommittally and signed. "Says, a jus' wanted the man tae get back, a dinnae want tae hurt anyone."
The mild glare slipped into something more neutral. He shrugged one shoulder. Draco noticed how he began tapping his rubber-tipped, brightly painted cane on the soft rug. Nervous energy coming from an uncomfortable man with dark circles under his eyes. Except for the world-famous scar peeking out from under a ridiculous knit cap, Charming looked like a typical new patient in the St. Mungo's Mind Healing outpatient program.
And that's it.
He wished he could go back and tell Draco himself before the choice was taken out of his idiot hands. "I

This was an awful idea. What was he thinking? He should have sucked down a lemon drop earlier, he obviously hadn't been thinking clearly when he went tattling to McGonagall, he had to fix this or Harry would hate him forever -
All the fight is sucked out of him and their fire turns to smoldering embers. No longer blazing but still hot and lethal, full of coy potential.
Harry nodded, ignoring the flicker of guilt that came from the knowledge that, somehow, Draco hadn't seemed to piece together his true identity. Harry chose to think of it as a minor miracle rather than consider the idea that Draco
“You’re coming home, Harry,” Sirius said, and Harry nodded again but didn’t know what the heck he meant. Hogwarts? The Burrow? Surely not the Dursleys; he didn't think he could stand a new set of bars over his old bedroom window.
In a way, it was their shop. As much as James wanted to claim it as his own, he knew he owed Monty more than a salary. Another twinge of guilt tugged at his heart, but a small part of him cursed his past self for allowing Monty to insert himself so completely when he could have done it all himself with a little more effort.
"Erm - " Remus hesitated. This could turn into a very long story. "Harry had a long history in the fight against Voldemort. He - Voldemort, that is - tried to kill Harry as an infant, but the curse he used rebounded and hurt him instead. So Harry became famous overnight, at just a year old. What would have killed anyone else...left him with just a unique scar on his forehead."
"I can afford anything if it's available. Box seats are reserved."
Harry shook his head once, meaning it to be an “I’m fine” sort of head-shake, instead of one that said, “I’m an idiot dumb failure who shouldn’t be allowed access to money or big decisions." Sirius didn’t say anything and took him gently by the arm, then corrected his grip to the shoulder after Harry flinched away. They stepped outside into the blustering early-December air. Harry automatically turned to his well-worn path towards the silo, but Sirius guided him the other way.
James wasn't sure what he did wrong, but he clearly fucked up.
"You'll know exactly which ones are yers," Marge was saying now as she unwittingly approached the scene of James's perversion. "Or rather, which are his. Those boys've done a lovely job painting up his bins, it's a real treat!" Little did they know, they were about to happen upon a real treat.

"Da', Monty?" Arthur called from the shop. "Someone's at the door, they won' piss off!"
) for her continued dedication as beta!
Draco had brushed him off last month, citing Auror threats and confidentiality clauses, when his friend came to him suspecting foul play. Blaise knew he was drugged to sleep on the fateful day when Draco had been robbed of his hair. He knew something had happened to Draco that sent him off to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, leaving behind his hair and a pile of luxury chocolates on the rug. After the Aurors (briefly) arrested him, Blaise knew the two incidents were connected. But as an Unspeakable, Blaise was rather accepting of Draco's excuses.
"Yes, right... Aspers. Er, snakes."
"I said leave it, Cedric - "
Mr. James blinked dumbly, glancing at Daddy for a moment before looking back at his host.
," Harry said, as if testing the waters. "We had our first kiss here..."
James simply needed to remember how good things could be when he let Monty take care of him a bit. He was going through a rough patch with the boys gone, there was no shame in that. Sleeping all the time, hardly eating, opening the shop late. He hadn't cleaned upstairs since August, hadn't put together a new variety box since July. Monty made dinner nearly every night, he took care of the mail-orders in his spare time, he even cleaned upstairs where the health inspector wouldn't look. Without a word of complaint. He was
She came to Draco two weeks ago and pleaded with him to take a mysterious new case involving amnesia of unknown causes. She insisted that he would want to take this one despite her not being able to pass on any concrete details. Given their tentatively friendly and beneficial history (post-Hogwarts, at least), he trusted that the case would serve to further his career as an up-and-coming Mind Healer on the rapidly expanding frontier of his field.
“What with your mummy always sending you care packages full of sweets—"
The silence that followed was suffocating and Draco dearly wished it wouldn't be so telling to gulp down the entire pitcher of water, or perhaps attempt to drown himself in it.
he thought bitterly. Monty went into the back to bake and James stood to ring up the customer.
Threatening to make some poor bastard's job more difficult just for spite -
"Oi, what's this?" Arty asked with a laugh, taking in the sight of the sitting room. The old sofa sat low to the ground as always. But now there were pillows on one end and blankets piled up over the cushions. A new quilt covered the back.
“Harry?”
"Are ye even giving them a
"Wanna see?" Ron asked, already pulling out his wand. James barely had time to wonder if the wizarding world had any sort of etiquette rules - if Monty insisted he took off his favorite cap, then he thought maybe
"Arty, you comin'?" Alec called from downstairs.
Just like before, when he spent years wooing and chasing his little bird, Monty knew they could build a future together if he only laid the groundwork.
"That lunatic was keeping a
"What d'ye mean an extension?" Arthur asked blankly. "What kind?" Alec leaned over to whisper in his ear and his eyes went wide with excitement once more. "Can a sell the donuts?!" he cried.
Monty dropped the whisk and finally faced him. "James, a' least give 'em a chance - "
“Isn’t that what got him jumped in the first place?” he said scathingly. “Aurors leaving their post, with their romantic ideas about privacy - ”
"Jus' wait til I tell Monty!" he said, brandishing the letter. "Yer mad at him cos he dinnae like Mr. Malfoy an' here you are, pushin' him off anyway! What's it all been for then?!"
He's not trusted to brush his teeth properly after his first "tantrum." Danny wields the toothbrush for him, jarring his jaw with the force of it.
, James said simply, face clinically blank.
"Yer just tryin' tae hurt yerself so I hav'tae do yer chores!"
"Introduce myself? Happy to! My name is Luna Lovegood. I like turnips and long walks on the beach."
“Sooo,” Seamus interrupts loudly, feigning a casual tone. “How ‘bout these paycuts, eh?”
Draco abruptly froze in his rambling, staring at him with something akin to horror.
James tore off the itchy knit cap, shoving it into his jacket pocket. He missed his old hat and wondered who had it now. Whoever snatched it off his head was a right cunt.
He spun his finger around his temple with a salty grimace.
"I'm trying to ease you into this," Blaise sighed petulantly, like he was doing him a favor.
"Yeah..."
"Spare me," Robards said, holding up a hand. "It's for the transcript." He scrubbed a hand over his stubbled face as he studied the stack of parchment that was the result of hours of questioning.
"Oh, he turned up," Draco assured. He went back to examining his files.
different. Entirely. Potter was a brooding idiot who couldn't dress himself properly outside of the Hogwarts uniform, and Charming - well, Draco couldn't say he was impressed with the Muggle jeans, jumpers, and knit cap, but at least his clothes came close to a proper fit. And the Malfoy family had always appreciated the style potential of a good walking cane.
He wanted that. Every night.
"You're being mean."
. Yikes.
Remus nearly forgot why they were there until he heard McGonagall gasp quietly next to him. She gripped her cane with white knuckles and stared over the head of the Thing as a man emerged from a large pantry, a stack of plates in one hand and a cane of his own in the other.

"There are ghosts at Hogwarts!" Arthur blurted out as Dad joined them, and the subject of the sofa was forgotten in favor of their school adventures.
"He's still a wanker, he's just - "
James ran his hands through his hair in frustration. He was shaking. They argued in circles, nothing ever got better! He either said everything wrong or Monty twisted it into something horrible.
"Or maybe I'm just not interesting enough to keep around," he dared to say aloud, choosing to focus on the way his breath formed in the frigid air.
were not top form for Draco, not anymore. He'd been breaking out into longer sentences lately. His vocabulary wasn't anything to brag about, but James thought he'd grasped the grammar much faster than he himself had.
"How many high-profile cases have you closed this year, Auror Weasley?" Zabini asked nonchalantly.
, he thought.
"That's not what this is about," he muttered, rearranging the quills in his stationary stand.
"Da' never actually said that," Alec replied. "Jus' said they weren't round anymore."
It was past lunch when he got Charming's enthusiastic reply, belatedly realized he'd forgotten to invite someone, and had to quill a letter to Blaise. On his fifth-best stationary.
"Do you need a Calming Draught?" she asked.
nice, but doesn't it just seem, well, cold?" for the admittedly attractive cottage built from brightly patterned, locally sourced stones.
"The war is over," he cried. The owl had stopped hooting, which meant it couldn't breathe. "I don't want to hurt you, please! Let it go!"
James thought viciously. Why were they trying to keep him from his kids? Wild thoughts began to fly through his panicked mind. Could he even trust these people?! What could Aurors do anyway? Would they really be willing to do whatever it took to protect the boys? They didn't protect Harry! James shoved past Ron and stumbled into the corridor, the pain in his hip screaming down his leg and up his back, stealing his breath away. He yanked open the door to the last compartment.
He was still overwhelmed with pride at Arthur's good sense and more than a bit ashamed that it had come down to an eleven-year-old child to lend his assistance from behind a closed door. He kept his wand on him at all times now, in his back pocket, and thanked the forces of the universe that Arthur had remembered the story of a young Ron Weasley facing off against a troll.
"That would be your old familiar, Hedwig." His heart was hammering in his chest. Complete amnesia, ha! Not bloody likely. Harry was still in there somewhere, he acted too much like himself to be anyone else, whatever name he was going by these days.
When Dad signed again, he sort of looked like he was about to sneeze.

James shook his head and smashed a finger against his temple again and again and again. His face began to crumple and he pulled his hair in frustration, curling up at the foot of the bed.
What with the bumbling social invitation, the inadvertently calling Girl Weasel a harpy, and finally the audacious gift of an original Charming Chocolates Variety Box, Draco was quite thoroughly distracted. And so he saw the signs, but paid them no mind.
This chapter features signing, character flaws, vomiting, swearing, backstories, themed chocolate, Quidditch, and James starting some trouble in a new but also not so new way.
An excruciatingly long pause, then Monty:
Arthur glared at Dad accusingly.
He was a bore, and a burden, and worst of all, somehow still a stranger to his loved ones.
"Never," Malfoy said with a smirk.

"Are you hooked now? One too many lemon drops?"
And it was spoken with such candor that Harry barely felt his heart skip a beat at the moniker. Harry offered a little smile, swallowed down all the conflicting feelings that were rushing to the surface - sorrow, serenity, panic - and nodded. He offered his payment again, praying for this to be over, but Florean closed the register with a wink.
"Why do you keep harping on about that?" he says shortly. "Because of the man-sized cauldron? I'll admit, it's rather sizeable, but that's no reason—"
In total, he wrote three pages detailing his opinion on the taste of each constellation, then tacked on another page waxing philosophic about presentation and shine, and in the name of Circe's left tit how did he manage to ship these in a Muggle box without the ganache freezing through?!
Draco went down under Tony's spell.
That wasn't how it went though. He let Monty help him eventually and so now he owed something to the man. Something more than his bed and his life. Just...Merlin, just not another shop.
"Daddy doesn't like that language, son. You are
He heard the bedroom door creak open and rolled over to find Monty peeking in. James grimaced and rolled his eyes as something crashed into the wall they shared with Al and Ar. Monty scowled at the sound and retreated down the hall. James paused.
“Don’t touch me!” Potter’s screech sounds muffled to Draco’s ears. It’s like the heat is so thick, it’s blocking sound now. He knows that’s not right, but he feels perfectly content to blame it anyway. Potter’s still yammering. “…worse! Move closer to the bed…can just get a spring, I might…”
and unending. The sun was still stuck behind the mountains, but its power painted his whole world in more colors than he could put a name to. How could such a view exist while everyone just went about their lives with their heads down?
he signed, breathing heavily. Alec was struck dumb.
At least, that's what she hoped. She would dearly love to view that memory in a pensieve because if Monty had actually intended to do something to James, she would simply have to set him on fire.
Last week, before the incident with Helen that landed him in hospital, James visited the London dragon art exhibit alone. It was strange to be out by himself for once, not really on an errand, but certainly a welcome respite from Monty's hovering. James said he was going on a Tesco run, said he forgot to put bananas on the list earlier that week, and that was true. But then he caught the Knight Bus over to London and took in the exhibit. As he rushed home, he picked up a couple of underripe batches to make chocolate-covered bananas, and Monty only seemed slightly suspicious when he said the Muggle bus had stalled six streets over and he'd been forced to walk and that was why he was late.
Harry jerked a nod, sending Malfoy some sort of significant look which was returned by the ferret in an equally significant way. Ron's addled brain couldn't spare the energy to contemplate these stupid looks because he was too busy taking note of Tony's anxious fidgeting.
Eyeing a nearby ivory chair with frank suspicion, Potter throws himself on his knees next to the armchair and Draco suddenly wonders if he can coerce him to get on his knees in
Monty's voice came through.
Apologies for the major delay in posting this. I was on a roll, but received some pretty shit family news. On the plus side, it gave me an excuse to go home for the first time in quarentimes and snag a pic of my neighbor's property, which was the original inspiration for Harry's new home. The big reveal is in the next chapter, and I bet you can't guess what it is!!
"Alright over there, Charming?" Draco asked, a distinct leer accompanying his raspy morning voice. Unable to respond with his hands pinned inside his personal fortress, James simply scowled. "Not too cold or...too hot?"
"Just answer some questions and I'll get out of your hair," he said, swiping the cheap Muggle stationary through Draco's carefully coiffed locks. "True or false - " The imperious way it was said, Draco was suddenly thrown back to playing Truth or Dare in the Slytherin dorms. " - James Charming, of Charming Chocolates, is actually Harry Potter in disguise?"
With a scowl, Monty tore off the lid and James sent him a warning look.
Dad explained vaguely.
"Arty, you absolute shit!" he cried. "I
"They call for backup an' then storm the back room all at once. Da's back there, jam-blood on his sleeves an' lookin' like a deer in headlights, guilty as ye please, so they
Arthur giggled madly and the cat in his arms meowed in protest as he squeezed a little too hard. "All this time, he's just been Hulking out magic-style when he's stressed? And he always tellin'
“Eat me, Potter.”
A loud series of crashes and bangs foretold the arrival of a young boy from upstairs. He stumbled and fell down the last few steps, collapsing in a heap on the ground behind the counter. The crashing continued as a large contraption bounced down the stairs behind him, finally breaking apart into pieces around him. The horn of a gramophone skittered and spun around madly across the floor, eventually coming to a rest at Remus's feet on the other side of the counter. There was a resounding silence as the boy cringed on the floor, hiding his face, and then the man launched into a cacophony of laughter, swears, and accusations.
"What's wrong with you?" Remus murmured. Harry's head whipped back to him and Monty looked as if he'd been slapped.
James nodded, sipping his tea.
I know you're definitely not fourteen anymore. You're an adult. You're going to - to pursue all of your wants and needs, and you
"Your family?"
“Never fear,” Albus reassures them. “I’ll have our finest stock boy retrieve them.”
"Twenty five years - don't be silly, it couldn't've been more than ten. Now tell me, where are the mallowmarshes?"
Alec snapped the phone back together and took off his Goggles triumphantly. "The extra coils I put in last time burned through but it's holding up so far," he grinned.
That was the last time Ron saw Auror Anthony Goldstein alive.
When he unwrapped his set of microtools, Alec squealed so loudly the cat took off into another room at high speed. James grinned over at Monty, who offered a wink back at him. Arthur scored a new set of brushes from Dean - who he hadn't met yet - and immediately demanded to go to the gallery the next day for the Sunday workshop.
weren't cobbing Harry, that was. Draco furrowed his brow, but he didn't look too upset with him for trying to poach his receptionist. Terry pursed their lips and nodded slowly. Harry was awarded with a wide grin from Terry and a mock scowl from Draco.
“Yeah, he's being a wanker again, so Ginny and I thought we’d pull his leg a bit…”
James scowled.
Pink juice dribbles out of the corner of his mouth, blazing a sweet trail down his chin. Draco's trousers tighten at the sight. He leans into Potter's space, tilts his mouth, wets his lips—and just barely manages to stop himself before he can stoop down to lick up the sticky mess.
Fingers curl into his hair and he spares a moment to wonder if it's sweat or blood that's smearing around up there by his temple. It’s simply vile. Or hot. Definitely hot, in one way or another. Draco pulls back with a grunt and attacks that jaw, kissing and licking and tasting the hard line all the way back. He finds an innocent bit of skin just behind his ear that feels forbidden. Impossibly intimate. Potter gasps, the sound is raspy and unrefined; Draco pushes his nose deeper into the dark hair and sucks harder on the sweet, soft skin.
And so on, and so on, and so on, until Scorpius demanded lunch.
"Not just anyone can be your bro, you know. A bro has to be everything. He's gotta be smart - "
raining...or drizzling, at any rate. I reckon it'd be quite beautiful at sunrise, facing east as it does."
When there were no more barbs to trade, Weasley used the Floo to return to the Ministry. Draco put Scorpius back to bed, but he couldn't calm himself. He was trembling, as he was prone to do when he heard his father mumbling to an invisible Dark Lord at the dinner table. His limbs were thrumming with nervous energy, his heart was pounding. As he choked down a Calming Draught, he wondered what was going through James's mind now. Was he afraid? Angry? He could easily imagine Potter in a situation like that, he could see him coming out of it heroically - unscarred and unbothered. An average Saturday night for lunatic Gryffindors. But James was unarmed and half-crippled and distracted by his kids. Betrayed by his love.
"Dad, come off it!"
potions," Draco growled. "I'm just ensuring they've not been tampered with."

They get in - " Monty was shaking with silent laughter and James's face was burning. " - an' see a smear of raspberry jam on the counter from when he was boxing up donuts earlier. But they dinnae think it was jam, no, they reckon it's
Draco's perfect pink face scrunched in mock-disgust before he saw something in Harry's expression that prompted him to backtrack.
Harry's reeling thoughts came to a screeching halt, which meant the next thing he said was not his fault. "I've never snogged anyone before," he confessed. "I used to try it, sometimes, in - down there - in the - I used to practice snogging with my hand, like this!"
“Oh, he’s around,” is her cryptic reply. "Doesn't go far these days."
"You can't blame Granger's accent for that one, no matter how close your offices are to one another."
"The war is over, the ministry's been reclaimed, the corruption rooted out - "
Ron and Hermione had laughed themselves half-sick Tuesday when they gathered at the Three Broomsticks.
"You've gone through an awful lot this past quarter-hour to claim you don't actually care," Draco finished, wrestling the box away from Blaise and claiming another truffle.
"Plenty," he said. "I daresay I've developed a taste for it by now."
Harry kept staring at the picture, saying nothing.
This was so very different from what he had with the stiff and cold Lucius, who still spent his days puttering around the Manor under house arrest, no better or worse after being taken advantage of by Nott. This was even different from what he had with Scorpius, but not for lack of affection. It was just...different.
He gaped. Draco raised his brows. "You knew all this time and - and - you knew?"
Hermione touched a hand to Gibbs’s elbow and he took the hint, though his face turned an ugly puce color. Draco wondered how much this rude oaf had in common with Ron Weasley and what that said about the Golden Trio’s true dynamics…
He had his evidence and by that afternoon, he had a plan. Hermione was right, James would just dig in his heels if Monty pushed him - on anything. If he tried to force Malfoy out, he would cling even harder to the git. If he brought up the bakery extension again too soon, James would panic and find any reason to claim they weren't ready. Monty would read up on how to run a business, he would study hard and come up with a serious co-owning model they could pursue together. If he kept the stress off of James, if he himself shouldered all the work and revealed his grand plan with all the little pieces already worked out, then James would give him a chance.
James accused.
"Yer cat," Alec snorted. Arthur threw a wad of wrapping paper at him.
That was alright. Monty would take it to him later, after he cooled off. He knew better than to get the man worked up in an argument, after all.
"So..." Dean started, sucking on his lip noisily. "Do you have a taste for war against Harry or are you just thick?"
Though London's rain was only a dreary mist in this area, Harry quickly managed to spot a large, muddy puddle and had himself a grand time while Malfoy watched him with that wide-eyed stare. Harry barked a true laugh that came from deep in his belly. He kept stomping right on down the trench, running his hand along the ancient wooden fence, until he came upon a brick house, with no windows.
Potter's head snaps up. His eyes are blazing but unfocused. A perfect metaphor for the Golden Boy, in Draco's opinion.
"Nothing," Blaise shrugged innocently. His eyes darted to the side, to the spot on the rug where the new variety box had perished that day. "So he's sending you complimentary chocolates now?"
for helping me put together Episode 2! And many thanks to Rose (
"From the story! Hansel and Gretel are lost in the woods and they happen upon a gingerbread house!" He gestures madly around the tiny room and Draco decides not to remind him that this room, at least, is not edible. "There's this old witch—is she a witch? Whatever she is, she feeds Hansel, and keeps feeding him more and more to fatten him up, remember?"
"Where was he this time?" Scorpius tripped over his feet and crashed into Harry's chair. Harry put his hands out to steady the boy but didn't quite make contact before he was off again.
Neville groans, dropping his head in his hands and muttering something about another transfer.
"Oh? For the workshop and the house?"
"Shut it!" And he only barely thought to add, "It's not like that. He's my realty person."
He turned to Harry, who sat beside him on the antique settee. Harry settled his gaze on the Healer, looking for all the world as if
Draco was only half paying attention during their customary afternoon tea break. Blaise had come over to St. Mungo's from the Department of Mysteries, as usual, and invited himself into Draco's office, as usual, and proceeded to help himself to the Central America-inspired chocolates, which was
"Do you mean in 1979? Over twenty-five years ago?"
"Could be that you'd seen the younger ones before, that they were familiar," Malfoy theorized. Ron made a note, forcing the cotton out of his head. Good, yes, the ferret was making sense...
"Bully for us." Harry unpacks a modest lunch. "Whatever will we do with all our time together?"
“Wha’sa reason?”
"Well, I don't think we can leave it like this," she said finally. James shook his head but didn't lift his face. "The boys deserve better. We've got to get you on speaking terms." James jerked out of her grasp, staring at her dubiously.
Harry could make out the likeness of a snake in the heavy iron door to the windowless building. He backed away carefully, keeping his mouth firmly shut while he stared at it. The last thing he needed was to start spewing Parseltongue while Draco Malfoy was still blissfully oblivious to his true identity.
"Can you imagine any house colors you might associate with those three?" Malfoy asked.
James tried again to pull back, to wrench himself away, but Draco clung to his hands. Even now, James could almost see the cuts forming on his lithe chest, the blood seeping through his shirt, pooling on the ground - Myrtle was screaming - Snape -
Harry met Remus's eye for a moment before he frowned and gave Alec a sharp look, which was promptly ignored.
James moved to protest and Draco nearly wrenched him across the table to crush his lands against his warm chest.
"I'm in charge of the Potter case," he said. "I'm on every shift."
It was against all sorts of protocols, if one wanted to find a reason to pin this on poor Draco. And many would. The Aurors viewing the pensieve memory all pointed to this moment and screamed like banshees. Because by handing over the letter, he was essentially telling Blaise that James Charming, of Charming Chocolates, was his newest patient.
Harry takes a seat between Ginny and Ron W., who thumps him on the back fondly. Cormac M., on Ron’s other side, is deep in conversation with Cho C. about the various benefits of vitamins on all aspects of the body, from hair and fingernails to muscle mass and bone strength. As the final few employees - all from a wide array of departments - slowly fill in the rest of the seats, Bellatrix shoots a look over to Mr. Percy Weasley - another suit with a gold name-tag.
"Hello, Beatrice," came Draco's voice, straining to be patient. "How's the...infant?"
. Even before James came along." She stepped around the table and into his space, forcing him to stop swooping her son so he would meet her gaze. "Harry valued family, more than anything. That's true in any lifetime, any manifestation of Harry. That's why you've got the life you have now, with the boys."
“We could start with our product adverts,” Hermione suggests brightly, but there’s a hard edge to her voice; Harry and Ron exchange knowing glances.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ye...oh James...ye poor bugger..." Harry was looking at Monty dubiously but apparently unsurprised at this reaction. "No wonder ye never wanna talk about it..." Monty's face was turning red as he laughed. "Ye sound like a madman! Potions, flyin' motorbikes, homicidal trees!"
“Erm…being different?” he suggests, as if he’s speaking to an idiot, albeit a nice one. “Having...differences.” At Arthur’s encouraging nod, Harry grimaces and adds, “Like, skin color. Religion.”
The boys launched themselves at the sweets - James's mouth tugged down at the corner in what was either disapproval or an attempt not to smile, before he nodded his thanks and carefully prepared three cups of tea. Draco and his mother pretended not to notice when James took a hasty sip, burnt his lip, and spilled several drops down his front.
That night was the first time he slept over at the Charming home. They drank the most heinously delicious cocoa and made a blanket fort in the sitting room. Alec introduced them to a television program called Doctor Who. Scorpius was wary at first, but Alec told him how all the special effects were done and the seven-year-old went on to sing praises for Muggles in between recurring bouts of slight terror.
"That's
"He's not a fragile little crup," she asserted. "But you've always known where to hit so it hurts most. You've only gotten better at it over the years," she said, tilting toward him but not quite managing to nudge his shoulder.
Dad wasn't sedated and as he led the Charmings through to the Blue Parlor for tea, Draco was already calculating how he might slip him something or convince him to leave them be for a few hours. He couldn't risk his father's insane behavior sending Draco himself on a tailspin of war trauma, with his frazzled nerves and stammering speech and his thrice-damned gag reflex. He had to be at his best if he wanted James to...to what? Confess his love? The idea was laughable, that James Charming - Harry Potter - would ever resign himself and his children to a future with the likes of Draco. A Malfoy.
“I only - ”
To his credit, Ron did everything he could. He stopped breathing, his face turned tomato-red, and his eyes bugged out like marbles, but the laughter still came wheezing out. Harry strove to be the bigger man.
he offered. Monty's eyes looked ready to pop out of his head.
If Monty had taken him to the Muggle hospital, James would be dead.
He quilled a note to schedule a new appointment with Charming and explained the new spell. He spent three whole minutes trying to work out a polite way to say, "Leave your Muggle at home," before he finally sent it off unrevised and packed up for the day. He had an afternoon appointment. Six-year-old Scorpius had a new watch and was not the forgiving type if Draco was late to pretend-tea.
"Let's entertain the idea that you're right," he says slowly, eyes scanning the room with renewed interest. The red bricks match those that make up the fireplace in the sitting room, and isn't that a chilling observation. "And I'm not saying you are, but…what happens next?"
"Blood," he murmurs. "On your lip…" His mouth parts ever so slightly, that perfect jaw shifting under his grasp. Draco closes the distance, sinking his lips into Potter's.
(I haven't eaten all day because I told myself I'd just "knock out one scene" before breakfast and now it's 5pm.  I am not responsible enough to write my own fanfiction, someone take this away from me.)
"...what?"
He wasn't even sure Monty was wrong anymore, though he could have done without the mild cardiac episode.
#9 Flint Ct
Then for a while it was, "Denny, I want to go to school."
He closed the bedroom door though, wondering if Arthur had managed yet to acquire a litter box.
"I should hope not," came a familiar voice that was definitely not his godfather's. A knee-jerk reaction sent Harry barreling under his worktable, climbing onto the low storage shelf and knocking tools and cans of stain aside to make room.
#6 Lynn Ln.
"Sorry," Remus recovered, wondering how many times in a day he would find himself apologizing to this man. "Only, that brings us to the subject at hand."
"Either Monty's secretly been a wizard this whole time, or someone's used Polyjuice," he sighed, his shoulders inching up close to his ears in an obvious sign of tension. "Got through the wards on the street, anyhow, so I reckon it
Draco recounted the events of the day in a whisper he could barely hear. He laid it all out as a narrative, starting with his answering the front door to find the Charming chaps. He walked him through, step by step, everything that had happened from his perspective. He told him about wanting to sedate his father - oh how James wished he had, but not for the same prideful reason Draco had apparently been using all these months. He told him about the the tea service appearing from nowhere, how it was Grosh's favorite trick. He told him in the faintest whisper how Lucius had left the room, apparently to retrieve the others, and how Draco had fooled himself into thinking he could let his guard down.
he insisted.
Harry's familiar green eyes landed on him but there was no familiarity in his gaze. Just confusion, worry, impatience… Complete and utter confusion.
"I'd have gotten here faster if someone knew how to string together a proper riddle," Draco grumbled, picking a stray twig out of his jumper. His
Harry had come back to life. Again.
"Our chariot awaits, my prince."
“Charmed,” Draco said in greeting, letting the smirk slip free. Charming looked heavenward in a very Potter-like fashion. Between Charming and Granger sat Montgomery Gibbs, the brawny Muggle man from the photo in the Daily Prophet. Gibbs gave a wide, happy grin. Probably because he was a wide, happy idiot. “What is it you’re looking to achieve in seeing a Mind Healer, Mr. Charming?”
“Bit too much sun, I think,” chimes in Percy.
Two hours later, class has long since ended and Draco is losing faith in Potter's sense of direction.
Feeling light and only a little nervous, James grasped Draco's hand briefly in solidarity before tucking into his waffles. He didn't miss the not-at-all-subtle winking face drawn in syrup, nor Arthur's stupidly pleased grin. When James had eaten his fill and the boys were nattering on about their plans for the day, he quietly slit open the letter.
He cleared his throat, feeling a bit stupid all of the sudden. "Hogwarts is a difficult transition for any parent, I assure you. I'm a parent myself, you know."
try wakin' up in agony, no voice, no memories, helluva headache, everyone's either yellin' at ye cos they think yer deaf or they're talkin' about ye like yer thick or like yer not even there… I'd've started throwing things too!" Harry looked slightly embarrassed as the boys were giggling to each other.
"Graham Montague, yes," he repeated, as if he hadn't heard the rest. "Let's get all hands on deck, I want Starr's locked down within the hour."
"Draco," he says gruffly, pulling free of a random woman's grasp. Though he's the same height as Draco, he seems to tower over everyone. Draco steps out from behind the rack and reaches out, taking Viktor's hands in his own. As Viktor leans forward to kiss Draco's cheek, Harry steps out from behind the other side of the rack, glowering.
"He saved my life once."
James shrugged, apparently unbothered by the prospect of a second poisoning.
The room was quiet for a moment before Nott's pain caught up to him and he let loose a howl of agony.
Tea was fine, if a bit formal. He couldn't talk to James the way he wanted to, though he doubted James wanted to rehash any of the words they'd exchanged via owl over the past few weeks. What was said and done was already said and done. Let it rot in the ground while they said newer, better things, like how much Arthur liked the portraits at the Manor, or Alexander's prattling about Charms Club. Like how James thanked Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy for their unwitting donation to the collection of protective relics in the Charming residence, and then in the very next moment:
James eased himself out of the bed they shared. He considered sneaking an extra dose of the new pain relieving potion, knowing he would be pushing it tonight, but decided for a pill instead and hobbled down the stairs with his cane. Maybe he would let Monty put him to bed in the morning. Monday being their day off together, maybe he could convince Monty to join him in bed come morning.
while on the run so he could be nearby for the Tournament. Never complained. Now he's...weepy."
." The clouds were seemingly eye-level with him up here. His embarrassment would have to catch up to him on the ground, if he ever came down.
"Nothing, she's dead," he said simply. And then he just went on licking his hand clean like Harry's world hadn't just tipped over on its side.
This was worse than slugs, standing here, bald, in the middle of the DMLE with no way home except to cross through the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic.
James signed stiffly.
Harry patted his hair over his forehead in a way that Remus had seen so many times before. It moved something inside his chest to see it again…
"It's perfectly natural," she said simply. Harry kept staring up, wondering if his trembling legs would calm or collapse if he tried to climb. "Puberty hits, hormones pick up, and us mammals like to diddle ourselves when the mood strikes."
Harry bared his teeth in a weak grimace. Draco barely waited for his meek "yes" before he was off again.
"It's a bit late to ask now, seeing as it's all over," Malfoy began with a weary sigh. "And you're quite right, Charming. We are not friends."
"James..."
Sure enough, forty minutes later, Alec was nodding off with five curse cards in effect against his woefully unprepared character. Arthur and Dad were tied at Level 9 - one away from victory! - when Arthur's character kicked down the door to reveal a Level 1 Potted Plant.
"Just, how many?" he repeated, turning pleading, friendly eyes on the counterfeit who obviously didn't hate him. It was a rare breed that didn't have something against Draco Malfoy. A mostly Slytherin breed.
"It's not the same learning at home as it is at school," Alec insisted.
A few customers were pressing their noses against the glass when they arrived. One of their regulars approached Dad, who grimaced.
Draco heaved a sigh of great suffering, grabbed Harry and Scorpius both by the elbow, and Apparated back to M & P Realty.
"Yes, thank you," Draco agrees readily, striding over and crossing the threshold without hesitation. Potter is wary, but he follows.
"Who else knows how to undo memory charms?"
Monty looked less than pleased with this brilliant plan, but he nodded grimly.
"Ye are not!" Arty cried out in horror.
"Went hungry sometimes," Potter says lightly with a little shrug, as if he didn't care.
"Yeah, and I don't like spiders," Ron chimed in helpfully.
, he relented, taking pity on Malfoy’s curiosity.
Over the weeks, he'd changed his schedule at St. Mungo's to take Mondays and Tuesdays off instead of the weekend. It lined up better that way so he and James could spend all of Monday together - playing chess, exploring parks, visiting museums, even catching a Quidditch game or two - and he could either have Tuesday to himself or help James with the mail-orders.
"Yeah, an' he weren't s'posed tae do that," he said, grimacing. "Got in a right bit o' trouble when the Ministry found out, even though Ted's mum was a regular human witch." James sat up straighter and, dishes put away, Monty went to join him at the table. "Teddy got taken away for a bit," he went on grimly. "Stayed in hospital fer a month tae make sure his genetics were all human and he weren't bein' abused or nothin'. Yer wizards don' like werewolves much. Don' treat 'em right at all, if ye ask me."
, James signed with a shit-eating grin. Monty didn't want to talk about Malfoy but he let James go on.
“They’re worse,” he grunted. “Thought he’d keel right over after the train incident.”
“Your potions seem to be working well,” he observed. Six months on growth potions had fast-tracked the rest of his puberty, though he was still quite short. Sirius and Ron had quickly learned not to tease. “How much longer?”
Monty paused, furrowing his brow.
Harry actually felt faint for a moment, like all his blood was rushing at once to his cheeks and ears, then his chest, then his fingers.
Harry flinched instinctively, but Kim's voice was already telling him that this was misdirected aggression and he wasn't in any more danger than he was seconds ago. And then his gritty thoughts caught up to what he'd said.
It was eerie to be sitting here in his office again, with Blaise, discussing Harry Potter. Just a month ago, he was tied to this same chair as "Blaise" ruthlessly tortured him for information. He ran a hand through the offensive fuzz atop his head. It wasn't even long enough to slick back yet. He looked mad. He would know, working in the Janus Thickey Ward.
It was nearly dawn by the time he was putting the finishing touches on the large collection of shiny dark chocolates. The Draco constellation in particular, he wanted to be sure it was perfect. Malfoy was difficult to please sometimes, difficult in general, but this would make him smile. It had to. His hands were steady as he poked a series of white chocolate dots along the five truffles that made up that constellation. Those five were nestled close to the four that made up Cepheus and three that made Irsa Minor. Thirty-six chocolates total made up the night sky, Draco in the center. (Draco had to be in the center or else the little shit would probably send it back.)
, and he was always going on about his next prank against that
"We've got our uniforms," his brother added.
The boys were chattering excitedly, oblivious to the danger that could be following them even now, even on the train. Just because they weren't out in the open didn't mean they were safe. Being trapped inside could lead to disaster! He bolted over to the window as the boys settled into the cushioned benches on either side. The window slid open from the bottom and he judged both its size and distance from the floor. His boys were small, but he reckoned they could reach the opening and fit through it if something happened.
Out of the kindness of his very full heart, Harry decided not to point out that just because their visit was for inspiration, didn't preclude the possibility that they'd left the castle with more than that.
When he could no longer read the words through his tears, he clutched the letter tightly and stumbled upstairs to bed. He would have to skip lunch with Hermione tomorrow if he wanted to make a new batch of Central America-themed chocolates for Malfoy. And he very much wanted to.
"You're not broken," he said adamantly, perhaps a bit antagonistically. "But you can be more than just scared and frustrated. And - " he grinned, feeling genuinely happy about this part for not entirely selfless reasons, " - you can keep James with you."
She studied her coffee and Harry watched her face carefully. She had changed so much since fourth year. She had grown into herself, was the best way he could describe it. Her hair was just as large but seemed less overwhelming and more suited to her round features; her brows didn't crowd her eyes anymore and instead leant an air of no-nonsense scrutiny. Her eyes were still big, warm, and bright with intelligence, just starting to crease at the edges. She was Hermione Granger, now more than ever, but he doubted her boggart was failing McGonagall's exam.
Monty is a sucker for reunions (and so am I).
"So's funny you should mention tha' bloke ye once knew, Mr. Lupin..." Monty went on pointedly. "Always thought maybe we'd run across someone who might recognize - "
Robert was gone, the shop was closed, and Monty was ready to have it out. James didn't love him, not anymore. To claim otherwise was cruel, heartless. He was angry. He was hurt. He wasn't even sure he wanted to fix things now, or if he just wanted to lash out.
"They're all okay," the ginger reassured. Draco wanted to shake him.
It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time, but he was having second thoughts now. Now that he was staring at an enormous chocolate penis on his kitchen counter, he wasn't sure why he'd ever thought it could be romantic. It was
"What d'you say we find some herbs and feed our inner Hufflepuffs?"
he replied, keeping his movements deliberately slow and smooth.
Saturday night, for the first time in Blupin Frottage, Harry closed his bedroom door.
"Having emotions doesn't make you crazy, H-James, it makes you human." He took off his glasses and pressed his hands to his face. "Monty is not happy when he's with you either." She was putting words in Monty's mouth but that was the gist of what he'd said that evening. "He feels useless and in the way. He feels like you don't need him anymore now that you have magic."
Potter clasps his hand—Draco could swear there's a puff of steam in the frigid air—and takes him away from it all. Perhaps it's just his saving-people thing, but Draco is grateful all the same.
"Oh am no sayin' it's mad," Monty said, wiping a tear and heaving himself to his feet. "Am sayin' he musta thought
Tune in next week for Episode 2!
Monty sounded tearful and he felt a spark of anger return to him. Good. James certainly had no energy to summon any tears, so let the wanker cry instead. He threw himself down onto his pillow and faced away from the door, hoping sleep would take him away from this.
Malfoy blinked at him - at the smoke, rather. James made a small circle with his fingers and brought it to his chest, indicating the badges that a young Draco Malfoy had made during the Triwizard Tournament.
"Exactly!" Arthur cries happily, missing the roll of her eyes. "And if we - the employees - are happier, the customers are happier. So. What can we do to make our more...diverse…employees feel more included?"
, James explained in that slow and careful way he had when he was trying to avoid an explosion from the boys. Or Monty. Not that Monty exploded, of course. It wasn't that James was delicate...but loud, angry arguments weren't right for him. So Monty tried his damndest to avoid them, even when the stubborn arse was pushing for one.
"C'mon, Lav, Cedric's more your type anyway..." The girls make a hasty retreat as Severus steps through a gap in the counter, examining the Jell-O closely as an investigator might treat a clue.
Draco chances a peek over his shoulder at the dozen or so centaurs in the distance. The centaurs seem to stare right back, but surely they've not been spotted… He lends a guiding hand to Potter as they slink under a thatch of branches, finally losing sight of the herd. When they come out the other side, Draco shudders in passing horror and Potter laughs at him. Draco bristles.
After nearly thirteen years, he should have known it wouldn't be that easy to pin them down.
, she answered kindly.
"He never seemed terribly interested in self-preservation. My mother saw him die, apparently. Did your friends tell you…?" He nodded stiffly. "Accepting those memories back won't change who you are now and they won't solve everything for you. It may help with your frustration, it may make your depression worse for a time. But Harry Potter..."
Night fell and Arthur couldn't stand to look at his tattoo book anymore. This wasn't right. It was Christmas, they were meant to be in a sugar-coma by now, but they were staring at two half-finished sandwiches and mourning for Monty, who'd left. Left them. Seven years, and then he was gone with a suitcase.
Ron lifted the letters out of Rose's reach and read them while Hermione took over feeding Hugo. Honestly, they had their hands full and these grown men needed to sort out their own problems. But Hermione had never been one to leave Harry wallowing in his stupidity for long.
"I thought I could lend a clear head," she said, shaking her hair out of her face and leveling a steely gaze at Harry that made him feel like a bug under a microscope. It wasn't even eight in the morning yet, had the woman no sense of stay? "And if they didn't listen, I'd at least have Ministry resources at my disposal. Granted, I had my work cut out for me in the Academy - and emergency situations are
James reared back as if he'd been slapped. But Monty wasn't finished.

The room is silent. Draco can hear his own shallow breathing, Potter's raspy huffs. He can hear the crackling of the wall-mounted torches around them. Potter twists his wrist, shifts his arm, angles his shoulders—there's a distinct click. Draco twitches, but the woman doesn't. She hasn't heard the door unlock.
"Slow down, crutch, a cannae keep up..." he muttered, attacking a plate with the scrub-brush. James rolled his eyes.
Charming shook his head in the negative and silenced Gibbs with a quelling look when the man opened his mouth.
"What's your name?" he asked, trying to keep things light.
Draco wants to change the subject, but curiosity is eating him alive and—"They didn't feed you?"
“Is that what this is about, you don’t trust me home alone during the day?” Harry whirled on Remus, who abandoned the paper on the table and put his hands up in a placating way.
. Of course, the dumb bucket had just needed his help in keeping Arty from adopting a feral tomcat while James worked on calming Al after his traumatic experience.

"You've been yapping at Potter's heels since first year and when he
"It was surreal!" claimed Amity Franklyn, of Cork. "Never thought I'd see another Potter and then there were three of them! All the spitting image of each other, of James [Potter]! I'll tell you, it took me back to my Hogwarts days when James's friends once used Polyjuice Potion to play a prank in class. Half expected Sirius Black to be behind it, to be honest!
