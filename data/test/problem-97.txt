“Leave them alone,” Ginny snarled.
Harry clapped his hands to his ears. He’d completely forgotten about the damn Ear-Bugs.
“I’m sorry.”
“If you would just ask Pricilla” Roberts was saying as though he were tired of a game they’d been playing, “you would find that I have never –
“You have no idea.”
“The wind is the bass. Don’t fight it, move with it. Use it to get where you need to be.”
“Kreacher is not hiding! Kreacher is being very busy with – with,” he searched for inspiration and failed. “I is being a very busy elf,” he finished insistently.
“Ah,” Harry stumbled, “a Butterbeer would be lovely. Thank you.”
Malfoy tilted his head, tapped one of the Bugs a few times, and replied, “of course I did. These are actually rather impressive. Bit tinny, but still.”
“Yes, Potter, I beat myself bloody just so I could bask in the regard of the Great Harry Potter. How astute of you, you fucking idiot.”
Harry backpedaled and waved his hands in the air to dispel the image that last question provided. “You’re at Grimmauld Place. My house. I live here,” he said in a rush, “and, uh, I think my house elf took your clothes off.”
It took Harry over a month to find out what a leather petal was, and it happened entirely by chance.
Harry tried to think of anyone that could have a motive and would have waited this long after the War to settle a score. He was sure there hadn't been any recent Azkaban releases. Legislation passed after the war made it almost impossible for anyone guilty of "war crimes" to be released. Ever.
On his third attempt to convince the Head Auror to open a case, Robards lost his temper.
The memory of Malfoy’s naked body slotted itself into Harry’s fantasy and he came hard with that image burning in his mind’s eye.
“Sleepy,” Malfoy slurred as he leaned heavily on Harry.
Eyebrows climbing, Malfoy looked around the room and spread his arms, indicating the jumble of books and parchment strewn over the table and floor. He looked back to Harry and said, “and you unintentionally levitated my tea without a wand or an incantation.”
“See you tomorrow.” With a grin, he disappeared in a burst of green flame.
but certainly relieved. As things stood since yesterday’s Life Debt revelation, Harry was caught between anxiety and hope upon seeing her.
stuff?”
Malfoy came back into the sitting room before too long and sat down with his head in his hands. “Just ask, Potter. I know you’re dying to.”
“No, Potter, no buts.” Robards rubbed a weary hand across his face. “I cut you a lot of slack, Harry. You’re one of our best in the field, but you are fucking terrible at following orders. I’m going to tell you this once. Leave. It. Alone.”
“Too fucking loud. How do I get the damn things out?”
“Oh, fine. Did you get the files I sent over?”
Hermione looked uncertain but pulled a vial from her robes. She pulled two fresh tea cups toward her and put a small measure of clear potion in both.
From the bed, Malfoy snored loudly. Sighing, Harry spelled off Malfoy’s shoes and tossed a blanket over him. Closing the door, Harry decided to just let him sleep it off.
Malfoy leaned down and whispered into Harry’s ear, “I want you to make noise for me. I want to hear your skin slapping against my arse while you bury your cock in me. I’m so open and wet right now. I want you to moan my name when you come deep inside me,” he licked Harry’s neck, “
Harry was still puzzling over this and watching the door when Malfoy came through it. He was following a woman wearing thigh-high boots and a tight black dress that displayed an impressive amount of cleavage. They didn’t turn toward the exit like most of the others. Harry felt a buzz go through the room as they walked slowly through the room and stepped onto one of the low platforms Harry had noticed yesterday.
Harry imagined his prick being encompassed by someone else’s body. Sinking in until there wasn’t anything left to give them. Feeling his flesh pressed flush to theirs. Harry would want to look down at them while he was fully inside. Clutch their hips and feel them flex. The smooth contours and tensing muscles.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “that.”
“No, of course I’ll –” Malfoy scanned the letter again. “Potter,” he said a bit panicky, “it’s
fucking hunch,” Harry snapped.
“There are tiny quidditch players passing bubbles over your head.”
Harry accepted another piece of cake and they stood there in companionable silence, balancing their flimsy plates, and eating quietly.
“We’re the same. I know what’s hiding inside you.”
are disgusting,” Malfoy retorted. “She was practically gagging for it and you didn’t pull.”
He had a wonderful life. A Malfoy-free life. He tested products for George, went out with his mates on the weekends, and generally, lived a nice, quiet life. Now, he was saddled with the git and was probably going to be an accessory to murder if the look Narcissa had worn as she left was any gauge.
Harry sighed in defeat. “Alright.”
When they were far enough away from Mary, Harry whirled around and demanded, “what the hell was that?”
“Yes, you can.” Her calm began to tighten. “I had hoped she was wrong, but clearly,” she indicated Malfoy with a sharp wave of her hand, “she was not. I assured her that she must have been mistaken. But here he is, eating breakfast,
“Oh,” Harry said, holding out a hand, “give it here, then.”
Malfoy lifted his chin haughtily and said, “bollocks. I have a refined beauty you could only dream of.”
With a shrug, Malfoy added, “I’m sure she’ll get picked up. It’s not like she has to be good or anything.”
He abandoned the search for his toothbrush and undressed. He was about to drop his pajama bottoms on the floor when a small patch caught his eye. A patch of semen.
No, no, that wasn’t right. He didn’t need to touch Malfoy. He needed to
. From
This was absurd. Harry was having an existential crisis over an arse cheek? Everyone had an arse! Some big, some small, sometimes hairy or freckled, some supple, some jiggly. Would Malfoy’s ripple when he walked or bounce firmly? There would certainly be movement to it. There was too much flesh there in the swell of his arse for there to be no movement. It probably bounced. Maybe rippled if slapped. Harry felt a renewed stirring in his pajama bottoms.
Harry breathed out heavily and set his tea cup on the table. “Thank you anyway, and for the tea. If you do happen to hear anything…”
It wasn’t until Malfoy reached the front hall that Harry started to feel uncomfortable. His chest suddenly felt tight and his stomach clenched. Nausea roiled through him and dizziness turned his vision grey, leaving nothing but the remembered sight of Malfoy unconscious and bleeding.
They stopped and Harry gestured for Ginny to continue.
Potter came forward on his knees until he was bracketed by Draco’s legs. Draco reached out and gripped Potter by the hair again. He pulled him forward and down until his head rested on Draco’s upper thigh.
“I see.” Her tone suggested that she very much did not. Harry was relieved when her gaze moved passed him to the doorway.
“My mother brought me here.”
Harry entered the Burrow from the back garden and was immediately tackled around the knees. “Uncle Harry! Grandmum! Uncle Harry is here!”
” The condescension in his voice was thick.
After a moment of silence, Roberts said, “there was no one else at my home. It was just Pricilla and myself.” He leaned toward Harry and continued, “as for the Silencing charm, those are for avoiding misunderstandings like this one. Unfortunately, we forgot to put them up before we began.”
“I know that. Next question.” He wasn’t and that was fine. Really.
upset.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened comically. “You! What are you doing here? Where am I?” He made to stand but stopped and looked down at his blanket covered lap. His eyes narrowed to slits. “Why am I naked?” he asked suspiciously.
Harry spent the next several minutes people watching as he sipped his drink. He’d been right to assume that most of the pub’s patrons would be well on their way to drunk by now. People stood too close, touched too freely, and wore the glazed smiles of the happily inebriated.
Eyes wide in surprise, Malfoy answered, “no.”
“Oh, I thought about it. If he hadn’t had this schematic drawn up, I’d have turned him into a ferret again for fucking with my product.” His grin was vicious.
Finally, Harry heard movement from inside Malfoy’s apartment and a moment later, the door opened with a waspish, “I’m trying to
“I could take the girl –”
“Oh! You’re childhood friends!”
Keeping his hand clamped on Malfoy’s arm like a vise, Harry led him the rest of the way into the front room and to the fireplace.
Malfoy’s face screwed up like he was trying, and failing, to do mental math.
Narcissa did not look impressed. “That piece was a 17th century antique.”
Malfoy stood up and Harry saw that he was, in fact, wearing Harry’s favorite pajamas. Harry didn’t think Ginny noticed the slight sway as he stood, but Harry did.
“That wasn’t flirting, I was –”
Narcissa nodded to herself and heaved a sigh of relief. “Thank you, Mr. Potter. I must go. Kreacher will care for Draco. He will be fine, and I will find who hurt him.”
“No. That is a terrible idea. What if your attackers are hoping to find you and finish the job?”
“Watch me,” Malfoy spat.
With a laugh, she said, “well, what George actually said was that bugs couldn’t be the only things stuck in you. I don’t know why you’d have bugs in you, but he made it pretty clear that something large was up your arse. I thought I’d come over to help you relax.” Her eyes smoldered.
Lacking a better option, Harry headed for the loos. Even if he didn’t find Mary on his way, he could use a slash.
“I’m not. You stumbled into something you don’t understand,” Roberts smiled a secret, knowing smile, “yet.”
Regaining his balance, Harry looked to the bed and then felt a deep flush sweep up his neck and cover his face with heat. More of Malfoy was visible now. Much more. The only thing still covered was his head, where it was buried under a pillow. From shoulder blades to toes, Malfoy was naked.
” he hissed.
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow. “You’re meeting a woman at a pub. Drinks? Music? Sounds like a date.”
“There is no case,” Robards overrode him, “because no charges are being pressed, the victim claims not to be a victim and there were no traces in her system. Of anything.”
Looking at the menu board in perplexity, Malfoy said, “coffee?”
As the details around him sharpened, he allowed his shoulders to loosen. There were few people in the room, and none were looking in his direction. They sat in small clusters, mostly on the edges of the room. There were groupings of empty, plush chairs around low tables and in two places, what looked like small platforms a few strides wide. Two closed doors were along the wall farthest from him and, immediately to his right, a long bar took up another full wall. It seemed like any  posh pub he might find in London.
“Hey,
This was unbelievable. Malfoy was flirting with his date! Not that this was a date. But Malfoy thought it was and he was smiling and giving come-hither looks to Mary and talking about his magic hands. Fucking arsehole! He was totally ruining Harry’s information gathering.
“About what?”
“Really?” Malfoy’s eyebrows rose in interest. “How?”
“So, you’re not attempting to singlehandedly resurrect the glorious order of Death Eaters?”
Harry tried, he really did. But every movement he made felt clumsy and awkward. He accidentally bumped into someone and received a dirty look. Giving up, Harry stopped the jerky steps he’d been making and turned back toward his table.
“Tell me about –”
“Kreacher,” Harry said, “can you bring tea to the sitting room anyway? I’m going to go get Malfoy. He’ll probably need it.”
“No, I guess not.” Harry looked over to where Teddy was talking animatedly to a smiling Malfoy. It was hard for Harry to maintain his earlier confusion and anger at the git when Teddy looked so happy to be talking with him. “He’s… frustrating. And I don’t
Roberts laughed. He fucking laughed and licked his lips like he’d tasted something good. “Oh, very good, Auror Potter. Very threatening and domineering.”
A few minutes later, paper cups in hand, they made their way toward the exit. Once outside, Harry paused to take a sip and asked, “so, Diagon?”
“Of course,” she said, “I should have thought of it sooner.”
Harry tried to muster a sneer. “Like I would.”
Harry thought,
The door opened as Harry reached for the knob. He seriously considered running for the safely of his room before Malfoy would know he was there. His indecision stole precious seconds and suddenly, he was face to face with Malfoy.
“Why do you make that sound like a good thing?”
“I know! I’m not exactly happy about it either!”
“You could say that,” was Harry’s sardonic reply. “She
After a moment, George shrugged apologetically. “Well, I mean… Harry, I looked over the whole design. Everything in my calculations and spellwork are correct.”
He stopped pacing abruptly. “Fuck. I have to Owl Mary. I can’t meet her at the pub tonight.”
Once in his room, Harry caught sight of his reflection for the first time since Malfoy had changed his disguise. His hair was a light honey color and, for once, lay smoothly on his head. It looked soft and thick. The changes Malfoy had made to his face were subtle and Harry was relieved to note that he wasn’t sporting any warts.
Jim. Kneeling on Draco’s floor, shirtless and submissive was Harry fucking Potter. Now that Draco was looking for it, he could see all the subtle differences Potter had used to alter his face. It was really quite good, but he should have changed the eyes. It’s what had given him away at the Manor all those years ago and it’s what gave him away now.
it. He just had to find it. Was Roberts’ firm a cover? Was he part of a bigger operation? There was something more to Roberts than just being a simple accountant.
Shocked, Malfoy’s eyes snapped open and immediately locked with his mother’s.
Harry readjusted the toys he was struggling to hold under each arm and said, “I did. These are for me.” He quickly swiped another box off the shelf and brushed past Malfoy before the git could comment. He paid for his purchases and ignored Malfoy who was smirking while trailing behind him.
She looked suddenly ill. “Oh, Harry. How can you
"Why not?" Feeling a little insulted, Harry continued, "I do know how to have fun on occasion."
I was testing a new product. They got stuck.” Harry picked up the Ear-bugs he’d discarded the day before and offered them to Hermione.
Only good flyers used their whole body, and Harry was an excellent flyer. Balance was centered in your hips, but for true control, you also used your thighs and calves. For speed, you used your abs, shoulders and biceps, straining all together, but fluidly so that you could adjust at a moment’s notice.
a baby! I’m four!”
It could have been one of the ‘feelers’ she had out. A coincidence. But the old witch was too clever by half. In any case, tomorrow night would probably be Al’s last appearance. It was a shame. Harry liked Al. It was his first disguise and his most well-developed. Slipping new personas into the spaces Al would be leaving in Harry’s network would be difficult.
"And you." And damn if Draco doesn't sound a little breathless at the unexpected physical contact.
Draco took a sip of his black coffee. "Why not? Don't you think it's about time we got to know each other? Properly, I mean. Now that we're not... teenage monsters anymore."
"Hmm, yes. Yes, it was."
Ron rolls his eyes, reaching out to steal some of her chips. "Except the press."
When Harry stands in the relentlessly whipping wind looking out over the stunning views of lakes and mountains, his time in France feels like a distant dream or something he only imagined, something that never really happened. Hogwarts is filled with memories and he only seems to recall the bad ones. They come washing in over him now in a huge, dark wave.
"I think you'll like this." He whispered a spell and the roof slid open.
For a moment, Draco is unable to speak. Then he leans over and kisses Harry softly on the mouth. "For an intelligent person, you're really stupid sometimes. You could have just
"Oh, hilarious, Potter. Such wit."
Some minutes later, they sat looking at each other across a table in a café.
"Dramatic!" He's still laughing. "One would have thought you'd staged it."
Occasionally, in his nightmares, he saw Potter as he had looked on that terrible day when Hagrid had carried his lifeless body into Hogwarts. And as he had looked standing before the Dark Lord - thin, ashen, marked by exhaustion and grief. A child challenging a mighty dragon.
"I'm so sorry," he murmurs. "I didn't know what that spell did. You could have died."
Draco grins. "She could have, but she didn't. But it kind of made me want a Real Potter Clock for myself."
Then there was Potter, and Draco had finally been able to see what so many others had recognised years ago, but Draco's own pettiness, envy and jealousy had prevented him from seeing: there was strength there, and courage. And although Draco found it hard to admit, there was also nobility. Not only of blood, although Potter certainly did have the lineage, descended from the powerful Peverells as he was, but a wonderful balance; a core of loyalty, compassion and love. Things that Draco had always scorned, because his family had scorned them.
Harry turns his head, too, looking straight into Draco's eyes. "That I love you."
But most of all, Draco remembered Potter laughing.
"I don't know," he says truthfully. "I have no idea. I don't even know where to start."
, Draco thinks, amused.
He lets the piece of parchment fall to the floor and looks up at the canopy of the bed, not sure how he feels. A little sad that it's all over.
, his father would have said.
Draco arches his back into the hard, warm curve of Harry's body as Harry moves in him, slowly, sweetly, with his lips touching the back of Draco's neck. Draco squeezes his eyes shut, mumbling something incoherent, and when Harry reaches around for Draco's cock it only takes seconds for him to come, crying out as he does. Harry pushes inside him hard, once, twice, and follows, groaning against Draco's shoulder.
Draco finds he's laughing, too, pushing his wet hair out of his eyes and wiping water from his face. "You look like a drowned rat!"
"Let's make this a little nicer," Harry says. "This depressing weather makes me long for summer."
Just as he opens his mouth to say he'll come back another day, her gaze moves to something behind him and her entire demeanour changes. Her face softens, she is all smiles, smoothing a strand of her hair seductively behind her ear. "Actually, here he is. You can talk to him in person."
In front of the fire, there's a long silence before Draco asks: "Why did you make that addition to the clock?"
"They will have a memorial," she says softly, "and we will honour them and remember them every day. - Oh, I forgot to say that you can Apparate to and from this room if you like. We removed the restrictions for you. Are you ready to start working? Yes? Good. Come with me."
Soul-searching is a gruelling thing, and not something Draco has engaged in much before. But if nothing else, house-arrest is inducive to thinking.
Up until now, Draco has looked at the paintings with burning hot face, shell-shocked at being exposed like this to strangers, at something so personal and intimate being put on display for anyone to see. But this painting…
"Isn't that what we're doing now?"
"In your dreams, Potter," Malfoy says, but there's a smile in his eyes.
Draco rubs his forehead. A sudden headache. "Who's the artist?"
Draco looks around to check if there's anyone to witness his pink face and unsteady hands, but thankfully he is the only visitor, and the woman with the talons is reading her book.
Harry leans forward to look at Mr Monet's canvas, where layers of paint overlap and blend into each other. It's not figurative, but the colour patterns suggest light and shade on a summer's day.
When they leave the room for a five-minute break, there's a whisper behind him: "I know what you did."
Something deep within Harry, a tiny voice of protest, is quickly pushed down and silenced, and Harry heads down to the Great Hall for breakfast.
He starts in the centre, intending to work his way outwards from there in all directions until the entire ceiling has been decorated. A lavish bouquet of fantasy flowers takes up centre space, followed by leaves, tendrils, stars, mythical creatures, trees, clouds.
Draco still isn't allowed a wand. He stands aside and watches Harry work, suggesting every intrusive spell he can think of, and after that every demolition spell, but not even Harry's powerful
Harry laughs again, a different kind of laugh, husky, breathless. "Come upstairs. We can talk more… later. I want...
The war has changed them all. Even Malfoy.
Harry has another go at Draco's clock the next morning, and this time it works better. He doesn't even need the circle of light under his lamp to be able to focus. Perhaps his thoughts of Draco last night worked like an exorcism, and now that it's done with, he can get back to business.
Death Eaters really didn't have much of a sense of humour.
When it arrives, the message simply says:
They all need a good rest.
"Why did you become a clockmaker?"
me. You could have explained. I wish you had trusted me enough to do that."
The library is miraculously intact and Madam Pince is still here. It's completely empty except for the three of them, but the boys are still shushed emphatically when they talk too loudly.
"Give it time," says Andromeda. "You have that now. Plenty of time."
"Thanks. It was mostly due to boredom." He pulls Draco close. "I know something else we can do to stave off boredom right now though…"
"But now I think it was for selfish reasons. Because I wanted to be back in your life." He lifts his eyes to Draco's, half apologetic. "The hand is easily removed if you don't want it there."
Once he's done, there's a row of them on the wall. A portrait gallery of the dead. And Harry's tears begin to flow at last.
He needs the absolute focus that comes with working at night. The lamplight glints on his tools, on the loupe and on the myriad tiny parts that will eventually make a whole. On an ordinary night he loves it, but tonight something is wrong. His focus just isn't there.
Doing research with Malfoy is unexpectedly interesting. He's smart and comes up with a lot of good ideas, and towards the end of the day they're beginning to have an idea about what kind of spells they need, and what they'll have to research further.
"Oh? What was?"
Draco leans his head back so he can look up at Harry and says in his haughtiest, most drawling voice: "I have no earthly idea to whom you're referring."
Pansy shrugs. "No idea. Never heard of him. Bland name - Evans. I don't even remember the first name."
His breath is like a cloud and his black, silver-clasped cloak is adorned with miniature stars on the shoulders. It's snowing.
"I know." Draco's own voice seems to come from afar. "I know. Me too. All these years... Creepy, maybe, but I'm glad we're here."
Harry laughed. If this was the new Draco, he could definitely get to like him. "Monsters is right. Being a teenager would have been horrible enough even without all the… even without…" He swallowed. "Without the war and everything."
Waiting for the reply makes him ridiculously nervous. He paces the house, drinks more coffee than is good for him and taps his fingers on the windowsill as he looks for the owl.
It's not just the idea of keeping track of family that appeals to Harry. It's the merging of the two worlds,
There's a thickness in his throat, a weird sensation in his chest and behind his eyes. Perhaps he's coming down with something.
Harry laughs. "To which your mother replied that she had personally saved Potter's life, so without her there wouldn't be any clocks?"
And once Draco's thoughts had gone there, there was no stopping them.
It's new and familiar all at once. Eight years is a long time, but Draco has never never forgotten the feel of Harry's skin, or the way his body tenses when he pushes his hips up, or the sounds he makes when he comes.
Not many people have seen Draco like this. Not many people could have painted these.
The gallery is small, with two tiny rooms and a desk where a haughty-looking woman with nails like red hippogriff talons sits leafing through a book. The walls are hung with double rows of paintings to make them all fit.
Draco does wonder if it's only the glow of first love that makes Harry shine so brightly in his mind, and whether that glow would fade if they met again. Perhaps it's only a hankering back to better days, to that period of heightened emotion after the war, when there was plenty of hope and nothing but potential. But he can't accept that. It hadn't been a spur of the moment thing, those months at Hogwarts with Harry. Ever since their first year at school, Harry had been central to Draco's life. An obsession, even. And the truth is he's still central to Draco's life after all this time, and Draco has little hope of his obsession ever going away.
They've been talking about the rebuilding of Hogwarts, and Draco has told them some amusing but innocent anecdotes about the restoration of the Room of Requirement (keeping the juicy ones to himself).
Heart pounding, he tries to sound casual. "Speaking of which, what's Harry doing these days? Have you heard from him?"
The first one is from Ginny, and Harry starts with that one. The one he needs to brace himself for. The one he wants to get out of the way.
She walks away briskly, and Draco wants to laugh. An exercise in self-control! Yes, indeed, if not really in the way she means. All those fantasies he's had about Potter over the last three months...
"Of all the places in the world," Harry said in a low voice, "this isn't where I'd expect to meet you."
Harry's smile lingered. "So do I."
With dry eyes and a dull ache in his heart, Harry begins to make charcoal drawings of faces. Its's the faces of all those he misses: Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore. Sirius. Fred Weasley. Even Snape. He isn't skilled enough yet to do them justice, but sketching them, working on them, is therapeutic.
Draco's eyebrows go up suggestively. "Oh? Well, you're not often right, but in this instance I completely agree. It's most definitely time for bed."
Of all the unromantic things to say.
Draco only nods, pulling Harry close and feeling his skin hot through the sopping wet fabric of their shirts. "Talk later," he breathes. "That's best thing I've heard in a long time."
Harry sits by his desk with the photos in front of him. Narcissa is beautiful, dignified and a little stern. Scorpius looks the viewer in the eye with an openness his father has never had. And Draco… Harry swallows. Draco looks as lost as Harry does on his own family clock.
A breathy laugh. "Am I sure? I've wanted this… oh god, don't stop… I've wanted this for years."
This is supposed to be punishment, Draco thinks as he watches Potter lay the groundwork for the spells before the construction wizards are brought in. Most of the time it feels like anything but. In some ways it's torture, but on the other hand he gets to look at Potter all day, stand next to him so close their shoulders touch, chat with him over lunch and even on a few occasions laugh so hard they both wipe tears from their eyes.
"Like what?"
And Harry could only agree.
A thousand thoughts drifted by in Draco's eyes, but all he said was: "Firewhiskey sounds good."
"Being an Auror. I know people sort of expect me to, or at least that I get a job at the Ministry, but I'm not cut out for office work and I've had enough of chasing down bad guys for a lifetime."
And then there's the painting that Draco is standing in front of now, the one that made him stop abruptly, the one that finally leaves no doubt as to who James Evans is, if there had indeed ever been any doubt: the one with the daisies. Blond hair threaded with daisies. A sunny, sleepy meadow. And in the background, a grey window streaked with rain.
"It's been waiting to happen, hasn't it," Harry says, and Draco can only nod. His fingers are still bunched up in Harry's t-shirt and he doesn't want to let go. "I don't think we should do this here, though."
McGonagall puts her teacup back on its saucer. "So, Potter, what are you going to do next? I assume you have plans?"
Draco has only asked for three.
Draco is breathing fast now, propping himself up on his elbows so he can look at Harry, see if he's really going to do what Draco thinks he means to do. So far, they've only used their hands, but the thought of Harry's mouth…
Harry pauses. He
It feels like this particular chapter of his life is coming to an end. Perhaps he's made use of the Grangers' house long enough. Perhaps it's time to go home. Or at least think about going home.
He turns around with a denial on his lips to find she's smiling.
All this goes through Draco's mind as he watches Potter begin to clean up the blackened remnants of the Room of Requirement. Flick of the wrist, complete focus, as if Draco isn't even there. Which means Draco can look to his heart's content.
"Thank you for coming back to help, Potter," McGonagall says. "Come, I have something to show you."
A few whispered spells later, the room is a meadow with soft grass and wildflowers. Poppies and cornflowers bow their heads under the weight of drowsy bees. A gentle breeze runs its fingers through the grass and the sun is warm on Draco's face.
He glances up at Dumbledore's portrait and finds it beaming down at him. "Find your own way, Harry," it says. "That's the most important thing."
They occasionally have coffee together, then begin to lunch together when their schedules allow, and one afternoon Hermione surprises Draco by asking him to come to the pub with her and Ron.
He doesn't mean to sound ungrateful, and McGonagall doesn't take it as ingratitude. She places a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder.
What was Potter like in bed? Endearing, smiling, a little awkward? Or darkly intense with those deft, precise Seeker's hands knowing exactly what they were doing? What did he like? Would he top or bottom, or enjoy both? Was he a cuddler?
Draco shivers, head to toe, his fingers finding Harry's hard nipples under his t-shirt and playing with them until Harry groans.
"Sure, sit," Harry says. Seeing the haunted look in Malfoy's eyes, he adds: "And just ignore all those whisperers and mutterers. They'll get used to you."
"You're no oil painting yourself," Harry says. "Oh, wait, you are. Several, in fact."
The gavel falls, Malfoy winces and closes his eyes. When he opens them again, his gaze slides sideways and touches Harry's. He doesn't say anything or even nod. And then he is whisked away.
The sensor charms are being very thoroughly tested. This time there's a bed, a generous four-poster with dark red sheets. Harry snorts. "That's really tacky! Definitely
In no time at all, Harry is hooked. It turns into an obsession. He paints through the day and dreams of it at night, of colour shifting and blending as he sweeps the knife across the paint, of layers and textures and depth. A glittering sea, the froth of waves dying on the sand, thunder clouds building in the sky. Quivering reflections. Sunshine filtered throuh leaves.
It could be an innocent question and then again it might not be. All through the evening he'd been looking at Draco's stormcloud eyes, at the blue veins on the inside of his wrists, at the way his mouth stretched when he smiled, and he wasn't ready to let go yet. They had loathed each other all through Hogwarts, they had almost got each other killed and then they had saved each other's lives. One thing was certain: they had never been indifferent towards one another.
Draco's laugh sounds relieved. "You're many things, Potter, but subtle isn't one of them."
"I'm sorry," Harry says again. "I think I really loved you back then, too, but I wasn't ready for it. I wasn't ready to commit. There was a lot of things I wasn't ready for. Looking back now, I know I was depressed, and it made me kind of detached. Numb, in a way. I didn't mean to be selfish, but I was. I just thought you'd be better off without me."
"What are you doing in the Muggle world?" Harry asked, stirring his coffee. It didn't need stirring; he needed something to do with his hands.
He gives McGonagall a nod, shakes Professor Flitwick's hand, and sits down by himself. A number of serving plates and dishes immediately appear on the table around him, and with a smile he notices that all his old favourites are there. Chicken and ham pie. Treacle tart.
No, Malfoy isn't bad-looking at all.
But more importantly: it can be turned back.
So this is the kind of friendship Draco lost out on all these years. He used to think friendship wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Other people mostly provided a way to get what he wanted, and not sit alone at meals. This is something else entirely.
"You'll certainly have help. The actual physical construction work, bricks and mortar and so on, will be done by specialists, but you're needed for the planning and the spellwork. You can consult with anyone you like. I'm at your disposal, of course, as is Professor Flitwick. And ... oh, here's your working partner now."
Draco shakes his head slowly. "No. I like it there."
"Is there any chance you could…" How do Muggles contact one another? "...give me his number?" Draco crosses his fingers, hoping this is the correct thing to say.
As more and more white space is covered, he starts to add some personal details - books, wands, faces of friends. Gillyweed, the Triwizard cup, a lightning bolt, his trademark glasses, a Snitch, a cat, a dragon, even a miniature dementor next to a bar of chocolate with its corner bitten off. All these details are minute and only identifiable close up.
Harry's heart begins to pound as Draco puts his glass down on the table and asks: "Do you still have that bathroom on the top floor?"
... I kind of wondered whether it was all real."
He stares into space and taps the quill against his lip before he finally writes:
They lean against each other for a minute after, catching their breath. Now that the urgency is gone, insecurity returns, and already Draco is wondering what this is to Harry, if it means anything more than a one-time thing, a way to let off steam.
mine!" Draco protests. "I mean, not the sheets," he adds. "The bed, though…"
requirement."
"Look," he said, "we're obscuring people's view. Want to go for a coffee or something?"
"What?"
The Chief Warlock eyes him sternly. "Mr Malfoy. Considering your youth and the pressure you were under, and of course the fact that Harry Potter has testified in your defence, the Wizengamot has decided to be lenient. You are hereby sentenced to three months house arrest followed by six months community service, the nature of which will be decided at a later date."
The lady is still smiling, although a little strained. "I see you two know each other."
The simple honesty of it makes Draco draw a breath. Back then, he'd been angry and hurt. He'd felt used and discarded, and for a long time afterwards, it had been like grieving. He'd even promised himself not to fall in love ever again.
Maybe there were no absolutes.
Despite being tired, Harry decides to have dinner in the Great Hall that evening. He washes his face and hands in his very own bathroom, changes his jumper for a dark shirt and tries to make his hair less messy, but it's a losing battle as always.
Despite Mr Monet being a nightmare of a driver, the roadtrip is like a dream. They drive with the windows down and the wind in their hair, smelling dust and grass and the tang of the sea. Harry soaks up everything, like he's been starved for colour and light. He had no idea life could be like this, so filled with sunshine and joy, and the freedom to pursue his own interests. They eat fabulous food, sample the local wines, wander through olive groves and along elegant, palm-lined promenades by the glittering sea, but most of all, they look at art, talk art, live art.
Harry makes a face and puts the order form back in the drawer.
And Draco Malfoy's face, with that seriousness that sits so well with him.
Draco was forthright, if nothing else. Seemed like Harry wasn't alone in being observant.
Armed with a battery of charcoal sticks, Harry sends himself soaring towards the vaulted ceiling and keeps himself afloat in the air with a levitation spell, so he can start decorating the whitewashed surface. Didn't Mr Monet say Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel lying on his back on scaffolding?
"We're making unexpectedly good progress with my parents, and the Healer says it might be because I'm here to help with the memory restoration - as I was the one casting the Obliviate in the first place. He thinks this aspect of the treatment needs to be researched more in depth. Harry, I know what I want to do now. I want to do
While he's gone, Harry looks around at the yard with its pretty pattern of cobblestones, surrounded by flowers - roses, lilies, lavender. The sound of water leads his eye to a tiny fountain where a stone frog spouts a  thin, glittering water jet into the air. The sun is hot but the shade underneath the lime tree is pleasant.
"Oh, Merlin," Draco breathes again. "Yes."
Harry takes a step closer, still with that intense look in his eyes. "It was a bit unnerving at first, but now... now I'm thinking…"
Enough of that, he tells himself.
There was a whole Muggle world he didn't know very much about, and maybe he didn't belong there anymore, but he wanted to find out for sure. He wanted to see what he'd missed. So he went to sports games and concerts, cinemas and bars, museums and bookstores, and surprised himself by loving it.
Potter pinches his lip, looking at the blackened ruins with a furrow between his eyebrows, and nods. "Sounds good to me. We'll figure it out along the way. I'm not terrific with sensor charms, to be honest, but I'm sure Professor Flitwick can help. - Let's start with the Scourgify, then!"
"I know Ron and you have never seen eye to eye, but I think it's time he starts to behave like an adult," she says dryly, and adds, "I already know
Mr Monet remains a constant in Harry's life, until late one evening when an owl hoots impatiently outside Harry's bedroom window at Grimmauld Place. The note is from Hermione, telling him Mr Monet is dead.
He thinks of the box of charcoal and the tubes of acrylic paint waiting in his trunk. They'll save his life, or at least his sanity.
that it's all over, and relieved it was Ginny who arrived at that conclusion first.
Hermione seems to have decided to let bygones be bygones. Perhaps she has talked to McGonagall, perhaps she has talked to Harry, or perhaps she has merely concluded that people can change. In any case, she is generous with her advice and support, and with consulting Draco about treatments. Their discussions about the latest research are always interesting.
"Well, at first Ron and I thought we'd go there too, but I won't be able to relax or rest until I've seen my parents." Hermione is blinking away tears now. "So Ron is coming with me to Australia. I've contacted a specialist in memory restoration of Obliviated patients, and..."
"Air?"
"Like going to the Muggle world." She looks at Harry as if summing him up, seeing the same things, he assumes, that he sees when he looks at her - someone pale, gaunt and utterly exhausted.
Draco did look different, and it wasn't his Muggle clothes or the fact that he was older. There was something in his eyes, in his whole demeanour. No insecurity, no belligerence, none of the old contempt towards the world in general. He looked calm and firm, like he had finally come into his own.
The second time, he tries asking Ron while Hermione is on the Muggle phone with her mother.
"I go occasionally." Draco turns around from the stove where he is seasoning a cassoulet. Pansy has never understood why he is "so fond of doing elf work" - a sentiment she shares with Draco's mother - but the truth is he finds cooking calming and creative, just like gardening. He still spends a lot of his time in the garden at Malfoy Manor, and visitors often say it has never looked this beautiful. That's probably due to the fact, Draco thinks, that for the first time in a long time, maybe ever, it's shaped and tended with love. Neither his father nor his grandfather had any interest in gardens, but only wanted well-tended grounds for the sake of grandeur. "I do go to Muggle London now and then, Pansy. Why?"
The clock order had been a surprise in itself, but then Dudley had asked – slightly embarrassed, as if asking too much or exposing a weakness – if Harry would mind including hands for the Potter family as well. Harry had been genuinely moved.
Again very casual, again a question on the tail of a conversation about Hogwarts: "So, have you heard from Harry lately? How is he?"
"Alright then," Potter says. "Let's get started and see if we can find a way to work together. I don't think we've tried that since we were in detention in the Forest when we were eleven - and even then we didn't try very hard."
"So no one will see if you skive off work with me for an hour or two if we stay within the Hogwarts grounds?"
The repairs have been going on for some months already and parts of the castle have been restored to their former shape, all traces of war and tragedy removed. McGonagall takes Harry to a corridor he remembers well, but where there used to be a sandstone wall, there's a vast field of blackened ruins. He draws a breath.
"My parents have a house in the south of France," she continues, "and it's… well, I guess it's mine now, sort of." She swallows. "I'm not sure if my parents know, or remember, they have it. Anyway, you'd be welcome to go there."
Harry follows his gaze. "I may have gone a little wild with the charcoal."
Harry grins. "Being straightforward is effective. I find it produces results."
"I added some things to my own clock, too," Harry says. "Come and see."
What shook Draco the most was finding himself drawn to Potter's world, where jokes and successes weren't necessarily at the expense of others. He wanted to be part of that world, to experience it for himself.
Draco sits back, disappointed and a little hurt, twirling his wine glass by the stem and wondering if Harry has instructed them not to tell Draco his whereabouts. Perhaps it just wasn't the right time to ask.
Harry's smile is one of nostalgia as he follows McGonagall's billowing robes along the halls. It feels like the old days, in a good way. Not all memories are dark.
Draco's mother didn't approve. "Draco, dear, why do you insist on doing squib work?" But Draco enjoyed clipping hedges, pruning trees, chopping wood and pushing wheelbarrows filled with mulch. It was penance, perhaps, but it was also satisfying work. It had the extra bonus of making him exhausted and helping him sleep at night.
It's the strangest thing, sitting here with Malfoy almost as if they're friends. They've certainly talked more today than in all those Hogwarts years together, and in very different tones. As surprises go, Malfoy has been a very pleasant one so far.
, the poster says.
For the first few days, Harry doesn't do much at all. He's so tired he can barely get out of bed in the morning, even if he's slept ten hours and light is flooding in. Tired doesn't cover it. Exhaustion barely does. It's like being at the bottom of a deep crevice, too tired to try and climb out.
"An art exhibition." Draco tastes the cassoulet, adds another pinch of salt and stirs. "Why would I
But Draco also remembered how Potter's eyes had flashed with confidence and determination. Once again he had defied the killing curse and returned from the dead. There had been nothing left to fear.
Draco only nods. There's nothing to say. He's been dreading this day. So, what now? Where do they go from here? They've never talked about that, never talked about their relationship or a continuation of it - if indeed this is a relationship. Draco would like it to be.
"Well, good luck with… you know, anything you decide to do after that." Harry pushes his plate aside and stands up, holding out his hand. "It was great working with you." When Malfoy takes his hand and their eyes meet, Harry finds it in him to smile a little. "And… doing all those other things we did. Whoever gets to be with you in the end is a lucky person."
There's a moment of silence. "No, I didn't. I didn't know."
These paintings are entirely different from the coolly structured, abstract paintings of the other room. These are emotional, feverish, immediate, and filled with longing. Memories, dreams, or wishes.
Harry looks out over the devastation, remembering the roar of Fiendfyre and Malfoy's pale, soot-stained face, his arms hard around Harry's waist as they escaped the inferno on their broom... He swallows. "Must be complex work. Will I get help? I'm not sure I know all the right spells for this kind of thing."
The Grangers' house is small, neat and rustic, the outside walls whitewashed and covered with cascades of climbing roses. The garden at the back has an emerald green lawn, a herb patch with fragrant tufts of lavender, and a small swimming pool.
"What about you?" he asks. "What'll you do?"
If only he could do the same with his family.
They stay in Harry's bed all afternoon while thunder rumbles, lightning flashes and sheets of rain are flung against the windows.
The more recent history is more joyful to depict. Mr Monet with his straw hat and his easel. A reference to European cubists. The portico entrance of the National Gallery that might not be entirely correctly represented as he's drawing it from distant memory.
The suggestion was so unexpected that Harry laughed.
And that's how it begins.
He's the first to admit it's not the prettiest clock in the world. The back of the casing has a hairline crack because he hadn't thought to dry out the wood properly, the location plates are a bit ham-fisted in their execution and the clockwork tends to be too fast, but it's a decent first try.
Closing his eyes and smiling, Draco can only concur.
"This is the Potter Room," she says. She seems delighted to tell him this. "It's entirely yours and it will always be ready for you. You can come here whenever you want, stay as long or short as you like, and socialise or not, whichever you prefer. Think of it as your own sanctuary."
It doesn't disappoint. Harry's palms are warm against Draco's face, his tongue is eager, his fingers catch Draco's earlobes and stroke them until Draco's knees are buckling and he's clutching at Harry's waist to stay upright.
"I'd be interested in buying one or two of these paintings," he says. "I'd also be interested in commissioning further work from the artist."
"Maybe. You're different."
One rainy autumn afternoon he walked slowly through the rooms of the National Gallery past paintings by Picasso and Cézanne, van Gogh and van Eyck, Caravaggio and Monet. In the Turner room he stopped to admire
good, but he does love it. Mr Monet seems to enjoy having a student as avid as Harry. He teaches him how to prepare a canvas and mix paints, and use brushes and palette knives. Even the names of the colours sound magical, a different kind of magic that sparks Harry's imagination. Cadmium yellow. Titanium white. Prussian blue.
Harry steps aside, a little breathless. His heartbeat is loud in his ears. "Come in."
And thinking back on his relation with Potter, Draco saw one thing with painful clarity: from their very first day at Hogwarts, Potter had been the focus of Draco's life.
Once they're out in the street, Harry turns to Draco: "Come back to mine."
Later, Harry will think there should be a sign of some kind, the "ding" of a bell or a prickling of the skin, when you meet someone who will change your life. But when he opens the gate and enters Mr Monet's garden, he has no inkling at all.
A quick glimpse of an arse and suddenly Harry was jerking off to thoughts of Malfoy? That was not on. It was weird and creepy. Stupid Malfoy and his pretend breasts and long fingers and stupid little smile and all that skin and that round, perfect arse, and muscled thighs and…
“I – I had no idea,” Harry croaked.
Malfoy sneered at the suggestion before squaring his shoulders with determination. “Right, okay. We have to go shopping. Let’s go.”
Harry scowled. Not wanting to trail after Malfoy like an obedient puppy, he went to find Teddy and say hello to him first.
“You still could!”
Harry watched his back muscles flex as he fucked himself. Using the heel of his palm, Harry pressed hard on his neglected prick as Malfoy threw his head back and moved faster. He was coming up, keeping the toy just barely inside him and then snapping his hips down hard, slamming it into his hole.
“Why don’t you come in, Auror Potter. Take a look around. Check for anything… naughty.” Malfoy opened the door wider and walked back into his apartment. “Make sure to close the door behind you.”
embarrassing stroll through my memories, and I’m going to meet my five-year-old cousin tomorrow amidst, what I can only assume, will be a crowd of people who don’t particularly like me. We are going to stop for coffee and then we are going to find the best gift ever given to any child anywhere because I can’t do anything about being stuck with you for the duration and I will not wallow endlessly in this house until I die of old age.”
Feeling oddly protective, Harry broke in, “it’s not. He didn’t come here. He was
Amycus watched them until they turned a corner and then stomped off with the Third Years in tow.
“She wasn’t drugged!” Roberts took in several harsh breaths and visibly tried to get ahold of himself. Harry let him close his eyes and breath for a few moments. Mungo’s would be delivering a report of whatever they’d found in her system, but the department hadn’t received it yet. Roberts didn’t need to know that.
It could have been someone in the surging muggle support movement. Muggle was trendy these days. Wizards were bending over backward to show how much they loved muggles. It wasn't impossible that someone could try to prove themselves by "punishing" a blood purist like Malfoy.
The Veritaserum. Harry wanted to slap himself on the forehead. He could have asked Malfoy
“Ginevra Weasley!”
“Oh. Alright then.” She seemed to be at a loss for a moment and then rallied with, “I have a lovely tart that is almost ready. Would you like to come by and have some?”
The walk through Gringotts was almost the same but with their roles reversed. Harry’s back felt itchy from all the dirty looks the goblins gave it. He tried to appear aloof and carefree, but Malfoy’s small smile indicated that he wasn't successful.
Victoire stamped her foot. “I am
“I hope I didn’t keep you waiting too long,” Harry said with Al’s bright smile.
“A relapse,” Harry repeated lamely. There was a buzzing in his ears.
“Thanks. I had a little help,” he admitted, hiding a twinge of irritation that Malfoy had apparently improved his disguise so well. “You look lovely as always.”
Harry smiled and knocked.
Wincing, Kreacher put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and then repeated whatever he’d said.
Harry’s arms and legs protested the entire way to his sitting room. Sighing in relief, Harry put the twisted person on the sofa and asked, “how on Earth did you carry him to my house?”
Completely naked from the waist down.
Both Malfoys turned to him with expressions that said he was an ill-mannered cretin nosing in where he didn’t belong.
Following what he’d done with his hand, Draco leaned forward and ghosted his hot breath over Potter’s hole and then down to his balls. Potter tensed right before Draco sucked a testicle into his mouth and he gave a lusty shout. Warming to this idea, Draco rolled the delicate flesh over his tongue before switching to the other one. He licked and sucked for long minutes.
When he did pull off the toy, it was only to un-Stick it, turn his body back around and shove it back into his hole. He angled himself so that he had enough room to work the cock in and out and stroke his own, leaking prick. Harry could see everything, and it was incredibly hot. Malfoy chased his own pleasure, moving his whole body sinuously.
“Why me?” Harry whined.
Feeling uncomfortable again, Harry said, “Mary’s nice. I wouldn’t do that.”
“Now, now, don’t be so hasty, Potter.” Malfoy cocked his head thoughtfully. “You know, I could use a stiff drink… or twelve.”
This was a bad idea. He had no idea what was on the other side of that door. He was supposed to look around, see what he could see, and leave. This was a disaster in the making.
Harry blinked. Malfoy was completely misreading the situation. What did Harry’s expression look like to make Malfoy think he might
Sensing Harry’s waning reluctance, Malfoy cajoled, “come on, Potter. Just for a little while. I need a bit of fun after the last two shit days. I won’t even tell the Weaselette you’re a lecherous hedonist with wandering eyes.”
"But that shouldn't happen," George said. "It would take a huge magical surge to cause that kind of malfunction."
Draco helped Potter gather his clothes and dress. They exchanged a lingering handshake and Potter headed for the door.
“Thanks?” Malfoy took a few bites of his cake. “Just so you know, I
More silence from Harry and it seemed to bother Malfoy, so he kept it up.
“What is the meaning of this?!” the man demanded.
“She doesn’t know I’m Harry Potter. This is my disguise,” he explained slowly.
Bill followed after her without a word.
“Yes, Sir.” Potter withdrew his fingers and lifted his arse.
Draco Malfoy. It was Draco Malfoy as Harry had only seen him once before – sickly pale, unconscious, and covered in his own blood. Harry remembered rushing water, echoing voices, and a gut-wrenching feeling of profound remorse.
“I know that.”
Harry fell back onto the armchair and pulled Malfoy with him. Malfoy held Harry’s cock as he sank easily onto it. He moaned loudly and hissed, “
Before the prat could protest, Harry said, “look, you just put the Ear-Bugs in your ears and then tap the music note with your wand. Ta-da, music plays. Just like magic.”
Harry spun Malfoy and pulled his back to his chest. He grabbed Malfoy’s prick and stroked him firmly. Finding his voice, he asked roughly, “you want my cock?”
With another ruffle to the boy’s hair, Harry said, “go play with your friends, Birthday Boy. I’m going to go put your presents on the gift table.”
“Oh, er, hi,” Harry floundered. “I seem to be lost.”
Neville looked hesitant as he asked, “have you talked to Ginny about that year?”
Malfoy squeezed his eyes tighter. “You don’t need to worry. Everything is under control.”
Malfoy found this hilarious and laughed the entire time Harry helped him stand and stagger up the front steps.
Harry had had enough. “Mary needs another drink. Let’s go get her one, Harv.” Harry gripped Malfoy by the upper arm and dragged him from his chair. The arsehole gave a little wave over his shoulder as Harry propelled him toward the bar.
“Ugh,” Malfoy said in disgust, “look, it’s you.” He picked up a figure from the display and placed in on his upturned palm. Tiny Harry stood with his chest out and brandished a tiny wand at Real Harry. A small, commanding voice said, “Expelliarmus!” Satisfied that the villain was vanquished, Tiny Harry tucked his wand away and strode around Malfoy’s hand self-importantly.
Back and forth, back and forth. “But why? Is he working for someone? What did he do to that woman?”
“I think I might be here, care to join me?”
As they walked over to where the crowd was gathering, Harry mulled over what he’d seen. Harry would bet his favorite body part that Malfoy had known those students were behind that tapestry and was trying to hide them from the Carrows. Harry was also pretty certain Malfoy had been trying to redirect attention to himself and away from the students and Ginny. It hadn’t worked and he’d been hit with a Crucio for his efforts. Malfoy had seen Ginny in a horrible situation and had stood there and watched because there was nothing else he could have done. He’d also shown kindness to Neville there at the end of the memory and Harry wondered if Malfoy often carried healing potions with him just in case.
Harry felt like he shouldn’t be looking and glanced nervously around the room. Everyone was watching the platform. Even the bartender. Some sat back, sipping drinks and watching idly. Some whispered into another’s ear, eyes always trained on the display. Others were leaning forward, attention solely focused on Malfoy, hungry looks on their faces.
Shaking his head, Malfoy said, “come along, Al. You’ve a lady to woo and I’ve a pub to drink.”
Harry slowly walked up his front steps and opened the door. Just inside, Kreacher was wringing his hands frantically and intermittently banging his head on the wall.
“Kreacher!” Harry called.
“Color?” Draco asked softly.
“I am
"No, no," Malfoy was giving Harry a curious, side-eyed look, "just didn't think it would be your type of place."
Harry stepped between the fireplace and the table, hoping to cut their line of sight and prevent George from seeing his dismantled prototype. Having Malfoy almost die again would probably go against the terms of the Debts.
Malfoy’s lips twitched too. “Makes sense. But Potter said something about buds instead of bugs and that got me thinking.” He dropped the book and held up a hand drawn sketch of a flower covered in incomprehensible squiggles. “This would tighten the matrix while retaining the requisite number of connectors. Not to mention, it’s also more appealing to consumers.”
“Er… yeah.”
Wait. What? No. He just needed to stop this. It wasn’t right. Malfoy was shaking with the strain of remaining upright while the woman pulled his head back. She bit him and Malfoy let out a strangled sound.
Potter takes it too
Well.
Harry was breathing almost as hard as Malfoy.
George went to the fireplace and Harry followed him over. “If he does anything stupid, I’ll hold the knives while Ginny and Hermione take turns skinning him alive.” He took a pinch of Floo Powder. “Bill and Fleur are taking Victoire over to Mum’s tomorrow afternoon. You should stop by. Mum hasn’t seen you in ages.”
“I told you it wasn’t a date. She has access to financial files I wanted.”
Harry concentrated on the feel of his hand moving up and down, pulling the foreskin down and tightening over the head. He imagined it was someone else’s hand touching him. A small feminine hand with pink nail varnish making his prick look that much bigger for its dainty size. Or maybe a hand with long fingers to wrap around his shaft with a firm grip.
“Domestic,” Robards began without preamble, “neighbor heard screaming. Williams and Taylor are on scene, requesting backup before entry.”
“I’ll keep the levitation charm on you then. Let’s go.”
“Just because you can’t read a book without Granger there to help you sound out the hard words doesn’t make me a nerd,
Unlocking a drawer in his desk, Harry pulled out a stack of files.
Harry felt his jaw clenching and his palms began to sweat. “Yours, huh? Like a thing.”
One of them? A criminal? A backroom dealer? What was he being included in?
Taylor rolled his eyes. “Sounds paranoid
“Nothing much. I was just wondering if you could get some records for me?”
“I am capable of looking after myself. Been doing it for years now.”
At his kitchen table, Malfoy sat with a half-eaten plate of eggs, glaring with hostility at an equally hostile Hermione.
Harry tried to discreetly sniff his armpit. Rosie with the red lips had smelled him?
“You. A Bat-Bogey Hex should be sufficient. Pick whichever one you like.” She waved a negligent hand toward the terrified students.
“The two of you came together?” Mark asked, as though Harry hadn’t just said that they had.
“It’s none of your damn business,” he snapped. Harry took a calming breath and forced himself to say, “I didn’t actually complete the training, so I’m not an Auror.”
“Well,” Neville said.
Oh. Right.
“Harry,” she enunciated carefully, “Draco Malfoy is in your house. Drinking tea. While wearing your pajamas.” Her words rapidly picked up pace. “Harry, how could you! Of all the wizards to – It’s Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake!”
Malfoy fell to his knees and vomited into a bush.
Once on the scene, Harry quickly slipped behind the Disillusionment charm the other two Aurors had set up and went over the situation with them.
Passed caring, Harry made a mad dash out the door, across the hall, and into his room. He slammed the door and dove for his wand. A drying and a warming charm blessedly took the chill away.
“Whatever. I’m going to have some tea. Follow me or don’t.” Harry passed him briskly.  He went to the sitting room and sat down. Not on the sofa. That would probably need to be burned after suffering Malfoy’s bare arse.
But Harry should have caught wind of something like that. Under the Veritaserum, Harry had confessed to keeping tabs on a few people – which was true – but he did more than that. Harry had contacts in every faction he could find. He used aliases were he could and used his name when he couldn't.
“Master is telling Kreacher to burn it,” Kreacher supplied sadly as he poured tea for her.
“Dobby is wanting Kreacher to care for Master Harry. Since Kreacher is meeting you, you is being very good at getting hurt until you is finished with Auror training. I is never needing to fix your bones, but I is knowing how.”
“Harvey,” Harry said pleasantly while shooting eye daggers at Malfoy, “what are you doing over here?”
Instead, it was just Malfoy surrounded by parchment, books, quills, and bits of disassembled metal and plastic covering the entirety of Harry’s kitchen table.
They were debating the merits of something-or-other when Harry looked out the back window and saw Kreacher bobbing anxiously. The elf was trying to communicate with a series of head jerks and widening of his eyes.
Alarm bells blared in his mind. Her tone was completely at odds with her question and she very rarely swore. Harry maintained eye contact and slowly moved to the tea set. Maybe if he didn’t make any sudden moves and also pretended to be calm, she wouldn’t attack.
“Pubs aren’t fun until at least ten o’clock,” Malfoy stated like it was obvious.
Something about that sounded off. Who
” he hissed.
It did not escape Harry’s notice that she was completely ignoring the question and anxiety began to overpower his hopefulness.
Startled, Harry realized he had his hand raised to touch the silvery scars. “I –” Harry stopped, horrified and not knowing what to say or do.
She jerked her arm away with a glare and marched out of the room without looking back.
Malfoy’s lip curled. “Don’t worry, Potter, I don’t intend sully your honor with untoward assumptions and impositions.”
“Malfoy,” Harry called, pounding with a fist.
He noted the business hours etched on the door and faced a decision. He could still risk the wrath of Robards, knowing that the odds of getting an investigation with the information he had was slim. He could choose to walk away, accept that there was no case and dismiss his gut feeling as a fluke. Or… He could happen to be in the area after they opened and maybe he was lost and needed directions. Maybe the upstanding citizens of The Leather Petal could point him to the nearest floo? Maybe he might just glance around while listening to instructions?
I don’t need you to mother-hen me.”
Days spent idling at his desk without anything to distract him made it worse. He tried to bring it up again with Robards and was met with a stony, irritated stare. He told Robards about Roberts’ whispered comments to Harry, pointing out that it was a lead they could follow.
She considered him for a long moment before setting her tea cup down and asking seriously, “why do you care about the Malfoy boy?”
Malfoy moaned around his fingers and spread his legs wide. Through lowered lashes, he watched Harry as he trailed his hand down his chest slowly. His hand continued over a flat, hairless stomach and skimmed the edge of a sharp hipbone.
be like a muggle mobile once the kinks are worked out. It’s a Wheeze’s product George is working on.”
The elf appeared with a pop. “Master Harry is needing something from his
“It’s very straight forward,” she said in a businesslike tone. “You would be agreeing to confidentiality. Nothing said or done beyond that door leaves it. You cannot speak, write, or in any way relate anything that happens to anyone else who has not also signed the agreement.”
Impossibly, the small man sat taller without moving an inch. He was shorter than Harry but still seemed to be looking down his nose as he said, “you have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Don’t look at me like that,” Malfoy sulked, “it was only ‘til first blood.”
“Hey, Mark. Here with my friend from yesterday,” Harry answered. Malfoy jostled him with his shoulder. “And this idiot,” Harry added.
The moment, or whatever it had been, passed and Malfoy walked away, shoulders tense and sporting a pink flush of anger. Harry stood there for a long time, trying not to think about the tingling on the back of his hand.
“No,” she said again quickly. “I can’t risk taking him there.”
Harry blinked stupidly. George tilted his head consideringly.
“Would you like to see what I do for work, Potter? You can watch me and make sure there’s nothing illegal going on.” Malfoy went to a computer and started clicking buttons. “I perform better for a live audience anyway.”
“Uh huh,” Harry responded as Kreacher banged a plate of lukewarm eggs in front of him.
The next several minutes were passed in amicable silence.
“Ma’am,” Malfoy interrupted again, “please allow me to handle this for you. Longbottom is already late for his detention.”
“And you’re a worthy cause?” she teased suggestively.
“However,” Roberts continued with a pointed look, “while I am a possessive man and I like being in charge, and I very much enjoy having others do as I say… none of that is illegal.”
Narcissa looked down. “Please, let me check on him and then I’ll explain what I can.”
“Yeah, I ‘spose.” Teddy perked up a little as he continued, “hey, Gran said I might meet my cousin today!”
“I’m sorry –”
Harry felt himself coloring and was relieved when Malfoy closed his eyes. The relief was short lived however, because Malfoy tilted his head back to rest on the man’s shoulder and covered the woman’s hands with his own. He slid them slowly down his chest, over his abdomen, and to his thighs. The woman’s body lowered with her hands and put her face right at crotch level. From Harry’s vantage point, it looked like Malfoy was using the man for support while he fucked the woman’s mouth.
He hadn’t expected Narcissa to be so early, but as soon as he saw that it was her, the fog in his brain and the tired feeling behind his eyes evaporated.
Malfoy wore a women’s floral dressing gown and, when he saw it was Harry at his door, an expression of utter shock.
Curly was still spluttering. “You can’t arrest someone without a cause, Potter! This is completely against protocol!”
Harry pushed the thought away resolutely and resumed his languid stroking. He conjured the image of full breasts. Smooth and round, pushed up and together by graceful hands, nipples peeking between fingers. Abruptly, Harry remembered Malfoy’s voice saying, “
“Fat lot of good they did,” Malfoy responded bitterly.
“Okay,” Harry said. That was good to know. Harry doubted anyone else behind the bar would serve them so quickly. He resolved to drink his pint slowly to avoid intoxication and a long wait time if he needed another.
” over and over. Suddenly, his eyes glazed, and his hands became erratic. He came with a shout, covering his chest and fist with thick, white strands.
“Yes, but I assure you -”
“There’s hope for you yet,” Alecto smirked. “I’ll escort Ms. Weasley to her tower. Amycus, take those three to the hospital wing and make sure that fat cow knows not to heal them with magic.”
“Why not go to the Aurors?”
The bartender recovered himself and his smile spread wider. “An honor, Mr. Potter,” he beamed. “Just goes to show, it takes all kinds.”
If Harry hadn’t been watching them, they might have been the ones to go after Malfoy. It bothered him that he hadn’t smelled even a whiff of anyone new or anything related to the Malfoys.
“My arse is so wet, but still so tight.” Slowly, he lowered himself and let out a hissed, “
A series of memories involving all the times he and Malfoy had insulted, punched, or hexed each other flashed through Harry’s mind and he found himself at a loss as to where to begin contradicting her.
“Mauss’ Theory of Qualitive Binding of Compulsory Acquisition,” Bill said.
Harry switched tracks and sneered. “She’s yours? Does she belong to you?” he asked derisively.
“You did,” Malfoy looked gleefully malicious. In a high approximation of a woman’s voice, Malfoy simpered, “
Harry took a seat at the bar and waited for the bartender to notice him. The man was absently wiping down the counter in a bored manner and perked up as soon as he realized he had a customer. He flipped a white cloth over his shoulder and walked toward Harry with a smile.
Harry grinned sheepishly and shrugged.
Taking two handfuls of hair this time, Draco said, “be good,” and pulled Potter’s face to his balls. The contact was exquisite, and Potter’s hot breath made it even better. Dutifully, Potter refrained from using his mouth and instead rolled Draco’s bollocks against his cheek, his chin, and his nose. His face was fully pressed into Draco’s crotch and it was amazing.
Malfoy made eye contact for the first time that morning. “I’m still not going to Mungo’s.”
know with what you
“And you are still alive and not in a state of financial ruin.”
He had to pull away when his bollocks tightened and he neared the edge of orgasm. Breathing deeply, he looked down at Malfoy’s abused mouth and had to close his eyes. Not yet. Not yet. He wanted to be buried in Malfoy’s arse when he finally came.
Malfoy looked up at her with wide, surprised eyes. “She was trying to kill your daughter at the time. So. Understandable, really.”
to that? Harry couldn’t think of anything other than drugs that would make someone smile the way she had. It hunted him in his dreams, that smile. He’d dream of ropes and bruises and that fucking smile and he’d wake up gasping and sweaty.
When the staring contest continued beyond what Harry was comfortable with, he cleared his throat pointedly. Neither Malfoy moved, blinked, or gave any indication that they’d heard him at all. Belatedly, Harry realized Narcissa was delving into her son’s mind with Legilimency.
A few hours later, the birthday party was in full swing when they Apparated onto the lawn of Andromeda’s house. The sudden increase in volume and the delighted shrieking of children was jarring. A small boy ran by trailing streamers and sparkles as more children chased him. Adults gathered in clusters, chatting, and watching the kids fondly.
The other two Aurors were finally able to pull Harry back and out of the room. Both were shouting at him and Robards was there looking at Harry with consternation.
“You’re welcome. Do come back to visit sometime. Feel free to use the Floo on your way out,” she said with a smile that quickly became a severe frown, “and don’t you glower at me, Ginny. I am your mother.”
Malfoy’s lip curled.
you don't want to stand here all night?"
Harry nodded and Neville squared his shoulders as though preparing for a fight. Their eyes locked and Neville nodded back.
He positioned himself at Potter’s entrance and took a steadying breath. He pushed forward until he was completely sheathed inside Potter’s body. “Color?”
Mary blushed and asked, “how do you know Al?”
“Well,” Curly said, “Taylor here thinks I’m being paranoid, but I just got a hunch, you know? Something feels off.”
Hermione clenched her jaw. “Fine. Harry, do you intend to harm Malfoy in any way?”
“One more thing,” Draco called before the door could close, “for your next appointment, leave the glamour at home, Potter.”
“Okay,” Hermione said. “Malfoy, do you intend to harm Harry in any way?”
Nose wrinkling in distaste, Malfoy sidestepped and gestured at the door.
Roberts was giving Harry a peculiar, searching look. “Did you enjoy roughing me up, Auror Potter? Your Incarcerous was rather proficient. Did you like slamming me against the wall while I was defenseless?”
“I cannot believe you dragged me here, Potter. This is not what I had in mind. What the fuck is this place?”
to piss off everyone in the family?”
Hoping to offer some kind of olive branch, Harry said, “we’re still going to Teddy’s party later.” There. An acknowledgment of a social activity they would be attending together. That was the kind of thing adults did, right?
anything.
Malfoy dropped to all fours and Harry forgot to breathe. His round arse was on full, shameless display. With her boot still on Malfoy’s back, the woman used her stick again. Malfoy’s arse rippled with the impact.
“If my son is safe, you’ve filled your side of the bargain and the Debt between us is cancelled. Where is Draco?”
“So?” Malfoy asked derisively.
had been a nightmare. Andromeda took it with the grace of a woman who had already raised one Metamorphamagi, but Harry had practically gone spar the one time it had happened on his watch.
“No.”
The music could be heard even from outside the pub. It came louder every time the door opened for groups of wizards and witches to enter or exit. A small huddle of people stood to the side of the door, talking loudly and ringed by a hazy cloud of smoke.
Hermione continued as thought Harry hadn’t spoken and repeated angrily to Malfoy, “are you currently affiliated with any hate groups?”
“I can see that.” Malfoy’s lips quivered. “Why in Merlin’s name would you do that right before a date?”
“So, I guess I can understand your
“Master Harry is needing something?” Kreacher wore a harassed expression until he saw Mrs. Malfoy. When his eyes found her, he bowed deeply. “Mistress, please be coming with Kreacher. I is making you good tea.”
“Yes, Mother. I’ll walk you out.” Malfoy still seemed subdued, but a little less defeated.
Stung, Harry snapped, “I might’ve gotten more information last night if you’d have stopped throwing yourself at Mary for five seconds.”
” With that, she took a pinch of Floo powder and disappeared.
Malfoy heard him. “You’re stupid,” he said. “Couldn’t pull the
it,” Harry said sarcastically.
Malfoy hadn’t spoken to Harry at all since that morning and he shook off Harry’s hand as soon as they materialized. His eyes darted around for a moment before stilling on a small group of women that included Molly and Andromeda. Malfoy pulled himself to his greatest height, adjusted the gifts under his arm, and without a word or glance to Harry, strode toward them with intent.
A thought occurred to Harry. “Kreacher, how did you know how to heal him? Bumps and bruises are one thing, but you’re telling me you healed a concussion and broken bones?”
“After that, Alecto started paying a lot more attention to Ginny. I think that might be the only reason Amycus backed off. They didn’t share.”
Eyebrows almost to his hairline, Malfoy just stared at him.
An hour and fifteen minutes later, Harry was in the sitting room, idly flipping through a pile of Malfoy’s notes on the new Ear Bud design while bouncing his leg with impatience.
“Why do you care?!”
“Gin, I was trying to tell you –”
“It’s not a holiday. Her parents are there.”
“It’s not a date,” Harry muttered sourly.
“Oh, well,” she said in surprise. “I’ll go pour us some. Harry, can you grab biscuits?” she said over her shoulder and, without waiting for a reply, she left the room.
“I am
“Auror Potter,” Roberts said calmly with a hint of condescension in his tone, “you have such a narrow view of the world.”
Malfoy squinted harder at the mobile the girl just ahead of them was rapidly tapping. “I just lost all of my newfound respect for Weasley Four.”
Smile flaring up again, the bartender floated one over to land on the bar. “Here you are. On the house.” He cocked his head to the side and asked, “you new to the scene?”
to the Aurors,” she snarled viciously as she headed for the door. “I will see you in three days.” The door closed behind her.
They spent the next hour in near silence working on the puzzle together. Occasionally, Malfoy would pause to flick a bubble at a tiny quidditch player that flew too close. Otherwise, his focus was almost absolute. Long, thin fingers would pick up a puzzle piece and sharp eyes would scrutinize it as it shifted through a sequence of shapes. Then, he would scan the remaining pieces until finding the one he wanted. Each time this happened, Malfoy would smile as he clicked them together.
“Draco?” Narcissa sounded puzzled.
“What?”
Harry found himself standing in front of a muggle apartment building. Squaring his shoulders, he walked up and took the stairs to the third floor. At apartment 103, he stopped and stared at the door. He smoothed his Auror robes and ran a hand through his hair. Taking a deep breath, he knocked.
“That doesn’t sound like nothing,” Harry accused. “Your mum didn’t want to take you to St. Mungo’s, but if Kreacher couldn’t do anything to stop it…”
tea.” His tone indicated that Harry usually drank swill.
It didn’t work. George looked over Harry’s shoulder and blanched. “Harry,” he said, “are you
“I’m good, Mrs. Weasley. I just wanted to stop by and see my favorite princess.” He winked at Victoire.
had scars from Hermione’s enchanted signup sheet.
First, he took out his mini quidditch figures. They were the same kind he’d bought through owl order for Teddy, but he’d chosen the Tornadoes and the Falcons for himself. The figures flew over the table at Harry’s direction and swooped around the little goal posts that were included with each set. Harry put them through their paces before diving back into his bags for a new item.
Wiping her hands on her robes as though she’d touched something dirty, Hermione stood. “Looks like he doesn’t pose an immediate danger. I guess that’s the best I could have hoped for.” She turned to Malfoy and said with deadly intensity, “but if you ever hurt Harry or cross me in any way, I’ll make what your aunt did to me look like a lighthearted tickling.”
“These are going to try to eat my brain, aren’t they? Weasley makes gag merchandise.”
“I don’t believe I’ve received an invitation,” Malfoy said faintly.
“I remember waking up naked in a strange house,”
“Fine,” she snapped, “Harry, do you intend to harm yourself in any way?”
To Mary, he said, “I’m looking for investors for a new project. Thought I might try to find out who’s willing to donate to a worthy cause.”
“Same here, Ferret.”
Pale skin. Smooth curves. Lean muscles. The risk of seeing it every day, forever and responding in ways Harry wasn't comfortable with. This bizarre fascination and the way his brain seemed determined to fixate on it would drive him crazy.
Harry reached out and grabbed his hand. “Please,” he said softly, “stay. Your mum thinks they might come for you again. Just stay with me until we know who it was.”
Harry’s throat felt dry. “Perform?”
The elf bowed and disappeared with a faint pop.
” Harry said through clenched teeth while trying to maintain his smile, “didn’t you say you had a bar to drink?” He turned to Mary with a sad expression and yell whispered, “poor lad, has a bit of a drink problem.”
She shrieked in delight and giggled when Harry tossed her again.
Just as Harry was starting to get excited about a big bust, he realized it wouldn’t happen. Robards would just yell at him again. What he needed was evidence, probable cause, proof that he wasn’t imagining things and that that pot hadn’t shatter itself.
“Yes, thank you, Mrs. Weasley,” Malfoy said. “The tart was delicious.”
Kreacher put a hand to his chest in a gesture Harry almost believed was outrage. “Would Kreacher do something like that?” The tiny smirk he wore said he would.
Harry gave them a moment to get into position before moving across the street. Senses on alert, Harry walked up the front pathway. When he reached the door, he listened closely, barely breathing, for any sounds of distress. All was quiet. The kind of quiet you only get with a Silencing charm.
Ginny stood her ground and refused to move the rest of the way out of the entrance. Not wanting to cause a scene, Harry edged around her as quickly as he could. Malfoy did the same but paused in the small space to stare her in the eye with a carefully blank face. The tense moment passed as Malfoy turned away dismissively.
Kreacher poked his head back into the room. “It is just being
“It’s Malfoy! He’s drinking our tea!” She glared at him and his tea drinking ways with venom.
“Oh my God,” Harry groaned, “please stop.”
A hand gripped his wrist and stopped him. Looking over his shoulder, he was surprised to see that the hand belonged to Malfoy. He was even more surprised to see that there was no scornfully triumphant expression on his face. Instead, he looked intent and determined.
“Oh? And you’re having it off left, right, and center?” Harry asked testily while not thinking about pale arses.
Moving away abruptly, Harry said, “I don’t need saving. It’s fine. Just – please, don’t mention it to anyone.” Narcissa didn’t know who had attacked Malfoy and seemed to have a wide range of suspects.
“The music is your broom. Use your whole body to make it a part of you.”
Dazed, Harry clinked his glass to hers and tossed it back. It burned horribly and he fought the urge to vomit. He washed it down with a long pull of his ale.
“Tell that to the dementors, you son of a bitch!”
Harry looked to Kreacher for confirmation and got an affirmative nod in response. The elf set the newly brewed tea on the table and said, “I is looking again for any swelling or inside bleeding and isn’t finding any.”
did you carry him to my house? St. Mungo’s–”
tea.” It was obvious he thought good tea would be wasted on her.
George came to his rescue. “Heeeey, everyone,” he said with badly faked cheerfulness, “meet Draco Malfoy, who is staying with Harry for a few days.”
Scowling, he knocked again more firmly. “Draco Malfoy!” he yelled at the door.
As if on cue, Eustace squawked, “love you.” He bobbed his head up and down rapidly and added, “old bitch.” Emilia looked at him fondly.
They came to a stop at a closed door and Malfoy removed the levitation charm.
“Actually,
“Well,” Harry said, “you’ll just have to keep practicing. I’m sure your mum wasn’t able to do it without
"Kreacher is finding Master Harry on the floor, dazed and he is holding his head and couldn't hear Kreacher," Kreacher said with his usual impeccable timing.
Malfoy gave him an incredulous look. “You stole a
Draco roughly stroked himself a few more times and decided he couldn’t wait anymore. Using his grip on Potter’s hair, he moved him back and stood. “Take my trousers off.”
"Yeah, go for it. I'll cheer you on from the sidelines."
"Will the defendant please rise!"
Art school comes as something of a shock to Harry's system, but he loves being back in the Muggle world. He's sure his fellow students regard him as a bit odd, but he needs time to adjust to the Muggle way of living, being, studying. Thankfully he's not the only odd student by far.
But later, when he's in his four-poster bed watching chalky clouds drift past the moon outside his windows, his thoughts linger on Malfoy. He enjoys working with Malfoy, and every day brings some new, small surprise. Like when Malfoy tells him well done, or shows a streak of brilliance in weaving the net of spells. Or that sudden smile that makes his eyes shine.
"And a Muggle to boot!" Pansy drains the last drops from her glass of champagne. "Well, I have to go. Good luck with your elf work," she waves a hand towards the cassoulet, "and you
two worlds, that gives the whole thing a symbolism that pleases him. The Muggle world and the wizarding world made him who he is, he created his family, he built the clock. There's the Muggle craftsmanship of the clockwork and casing, there's the spellwork for the trackers and the family member hands. He likes making all those small parts come together, work together, make a whole.
With the tension temporarily out of his system, he goes to the Great Hall for breakfast. More often than not he ends up sitting with Potter, unable to stop looking at him. Sometimes it's all he can do not to lean across the table and...
. Of course it had to be him. Always, always Potter.
"We go a long way back," says Harry. "Draco, we need to go for a coffee and catch up."
Mr Monet is sitting underneath a tree in his yard with a straw hat on his head and a paintbrush in his hand, and an easel in front of him. When Harry clears his throat, the old man peers around the easel and gives Harry a quizzical smile.
Draco isn't sure what he'd expected. Perhaps he hadn't expected anything. His fantasies never allowed him more than separate scenes: a kiss, a snog, a handjob. He never dared think of the broader picture. The time in between.
If he's honest with himself, and he mostly is these days, this isn't just about friendship. For Draco, it's beyond that. Far beyond. It doesn't seem to be for Potter, but Draco can live with that - for now. While he comes to terms with it. With how he feels.
They're standing side by side, looking at the anonymous sandstone wall hiding the Room of Requirement. Their work is done, the Relocation spells have been adjusted and the Expansion charms perfected. The Room is ready for its final inspection by McGonagall and the team of experts.
know how to behave like one."
Draco adjusts his head on Harry's shoulder. "I remember the first time we were here. With the steaming water and the cold sky, and... and
After weeks of wandering around the house and finding all his old beliefs crumbling, Draco desperately needed something to do. Malfoy Manor was surrounded by a large park with a formal French Baroque garden, an English woodland garden and walled kitchen gardens. There must be things to do there. Draco found the Head Gardener and asked to be taught both physical, magicless work like digging, and spellwork to grow the most beautiful flowers and make fabulous hedge sculptures. Confused and slightly terrified, the Head Gardener took on his new and unexpected apprentice. Draco listened carefully and worked hard, making a point of saying thank you and expressing his appreciation of the Head Gardener's skills. He wanted to remove himself as far as possible from his old persona.
"Oh, Hermione." Harry pulls her into a hug. "If there's anything I can do, let me know? And I mean anything."
Draco wanders slowly around the outer room. The paintings here are abstract, dramatic, with thick, slathered-on layers of paint. At first glance they seem to have been painted very quickly, but a closer look shows them to be meticulously made, with careful texturing and detail. The colours remind Draco of something - he searches his memory - France, perhaps? Yes, the south of France, where Draco and his mother have spent a few summers and autumns. Colours suggesting golden sunlight, lavender fields, sun glittering on the sea… It's expertly done.
"Sounds great. See you then."
"Well, I wanted a family clock like the one the Weasleys had and decided to make my own. Then people began to ask me to make them one, too, and I enjoyed doing it. I still do."
Afterwards they lie side by side on the tacky red bed, warm and sated. Draco looks up at the canopy of the bed, feeling the warmth of Harry's arm against his own and thinking of nothing except maybe that he's never been this happy. He wants to stay in this moment and not think of anything before or after this, not think of anything outside this bed.
She takes him to the Gryffindor Tower - to an entirely new floor added at the very top, just under the roof.
"Thanks," Harry says, surprised. "Let's go to the library, then."
Harry looks down, watching the toe of his boot make a fan shape back and forth on the wood floor. "A lot of people died for us," he murmurs. "And they don't have the luxury of coming back to their own plush room at Hogwarts."
Draco laughs, trailing his fingertip down Harry's spine. "I should have guessed you were a romantic, Potter."
"And that's where any similarity with Michelangelo ends," Harry mutters.
There are some re-entry problems like remembering not to use magic for everyday things. In one of their first watercolour classes, Harry knocks over his water jar and instinctively saves it with magic before it hits the floor. Not a drop is spilled. Shocked by his own carelessness, he quickly looks around the room. Everyone is too absorbed by their own work to notice, except for one student - from across the room, he meets the wide eyes of a quiet girl whose name he hasn't learnt yet.
"No one would begrudge you a little peace and quiet, Harry, I'm sure," Hermione says.
Harry lies down on his back in the grass, watching a butterfly make its graceful, erratic way towards the herb patch. The stress is seeping out of him already. He can definitely see why people would want to go abroad for their holiday. A complete change of scene will make it easier to relax.
"I didn't mean the clothes. You look… as if you know who you are."
"Teddy, be nice to your godfather." Andromeda takes the child off Harry. "What are you going to do now, Harry? Now that you're free."
"This."
"Mr Evans," the lady chirps, "this gentleman has expressed an interest in buying some of your paintings."
It's embarrassing how Draco keeps noticing every little thing about Potter: the ways his eyes crinkle when he laughs, how a bone protrudes at his wrist, how his eyebrows are drawn together when he concentrates hard. His tanned hand holding a piece of parchment flat, fingers splayed.
"Monet?" Ron asks, still chewing. "Like the bloke with the lily ponds?"
Draco looked down at his jeans. "These are great, actually. Never thought I'd say that."
This is the time of day – or night – Harry loves the most. It's one in the morning, the house is silent, the curtains are drawn. The room is in darkness except for the circle of light under his work lamp. Nothing outside this circle exists. This is his entire world.
He Apparates them to the steps of a gloomy-looking building that looks vaguely familiar to Draco, opens the door and pulls Draco inside, into a narrow hallway, blessedly dry.
"Oh, call me Harry, please. Much better now, thanks. It's lovely here."
The shock on Harry's face registers clearly, too, but he only says: "Oh."
The sky had cleared after the rain, and they lay in the steaming tub with Draco's back on Harry's chest as they watched the stars.
wanted to.
Potter looks the same as always, and still profoundly changed - well rested, Draco realises, and relaxed, now that the tremendous weight of being the Chosen One has been lifted. He looks calm and amused, ready to take on the world again, in quite a different way. His tan must mean he's spent some time abroad, and Draco has to admit his Muggle clothes show him up to his advantage. Snugly fitting jeans, a dark jumper with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows… He looks ready to get things done.
"Pleased to meet you,
Time is the great healer, people say, and it's true that time has healing powers. Like phoenix tears.
Harry would never have guessed he'd have any kind of talent for art, that he'd be any good at drawing or painting. Perhaps he will never be
"Well, you know now. I love you. So where do we go from here?"
"Of course you did, and of course it had nothing to do with being a great excuse for contacting me. You're many things, Malfoy, but subtle isn't – mmph!"
"You've been watching me," Harry says in a low voice. "And I don't mean just now. You've been doing it all along, ever since we started working on the Room of Requirement."
Harry turns to Draco. "Are you free to move around the castle?"
With the war, Draco saw people around him change and turn into frightening, exaggerated - or disappointing - versions of themselves. He watched his mother grow silent and frightened and his father descend into despair. Crabbe and Goyle turned into the full-fledged thugs and killers he'd always known them capable of becoming. Until now, that had only seemed an advantage, something that could serve Draco well. Now he knew they'd turn against him in an instant, if they saw fit.
In the middle of it all, Draco found himself thinking about Potter in new and dangerous ways. Continuing his relentless self-examination, he realised this wasn't new, but something he'd never quite admitted to himself.
“Oh.” Malfoy looked like he was trying to visually dissect a rather weird species of insect.
Malfoy, of course, had a thick head and a big fat gob so obviously the complete prat asked, “why not?”
With determination, Harry picked up his quill and started writing letters.
“They
Draco let go of Potter’s hair and pulled out of his mouth completely as he watched Potter stroke himself. It was fucking hot. Having got permission once, Potter didn’t hesitate to lean back in and mouth at Draco’s prick with a throaty moan. It was as he was licking a hot stripe up Draco’s balls that he looked up through his thick lashes with his bright green eyes and Draco almost lost it. Fucking hell.
“And report
at his hair and face before approaching his mum and bending down to kiss her cheek.
“What is a leather petal?” Harry demanded as he heard Curly enter the room. He felt another set of arms pulling at him but ignored them. “Why, you son of a bitch?”
“This was cleverly done.” George held out a hand. Malfoy looked at it in surprise before taking it. “You’re still a poncy bastard though.”
“Oh,” Harry said, not sure how to interpret Malfoy’s tone, “did you not actually want to go?”
“You first,” Harry muttered, handing him the Floo tin.
Without Harry quite knowing how it happened, he was standing, and his hand had shot across the table to grip Roberts by the throat. Harry pulled him within inches of his face as he felt the long-forgotten Taylor grip the back of his robes.
Malfoy did not oblige. “
He opened the front door and stepped inside. Harry wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting, but the room he entered wasn’t it. He was in a well-lit, tastefully decorated reception room. Potted ferns bracketed a plush looking sofa to his right and a tall desk stood before him. The witch behind the desk didn’t quite match the stylish, pastel-colored space. Her eyelids were heavy with black shadow, her lips were a dark red, and there was no way her hair was naturally deep purple. Her tight corset and fishnet gloves also contrasted with the décor.
Harry was quite surprised when the lump on the bed suddenly moved, making Harry stumble back as the blanket came free abruptly.
telling Hermione. Maybe you’ll listen to
Harry nearly toppled backward out of his chair. He snatched his wand in a tight fist, shooting a few stray, excited sparks as the two front chair legs banged back onto the floor. A slow smile spread across his face. Robards only shouted his name like that for one reason. Harry quickly rose and made his way into the Head Auror’s office.
On cue, the fireplace roared with green flames and George stepped out. “Harry,” he nodded in greeting. “I hear you’ve pissed off my sister
“Kreacher,” Harry said, trying to be heard over the ringing, “I can’t hear you.”
“Here, budge over. I’m good at these.”
“Malfoy, what -”
Red Lips saw him wavering. “We don’t even require your name to sign. Many enjoy the anonymity they can find here. No one will know anything about you other than what you do or do not tell them.”
Harry’s heart couldn’t choose between beating out of his chest and stopping completely.
“What is it?” George asked.
“Well,” he said as he leaned passed Harry, “he didn’t do your beauty justice.”
Once at the counter, Harry smiled at the barista and ordered a white chocolate mocha.
They all sat, and Harry turned to George. “Before I forget, you should read Mouse’s Theory of Binding Quantities of Acquisition Compulsions.”
Trying to retain his professionalism, Harry began again, “our reports claim -”
“No. Actually, I’m looking to stop some trouble for them. One of them got into a bit of trouble on their own and I’d like to know why it happened.” Harry hoped that would be a sufficient answer. He didn’t need Emilia to know about the attack on Malfoy or that the git was currently occupying his guestroom. The clever old witch gathered news from all sources available and Harry was sure he wasn’t the only one she gave information to.
Malfoy seemed unable to answer. Chortling, he pointed at Harry then dramatically at himself and then began laughing harder. Why he thought parasites were so funny, Harry really didn't know.
An irritated sigh came from Neville’s right. “Really, Amycus?” Alecto snapped waspishly. “Have your fun with the ginger tart later. Longbottom has detention.” A backhanded blow hit Neville in the face and for a moment all Harry could see was blackness.
improve them. He did it while, apparently, struggling to breathe and occasionally vomiting. Fucking idiot.
“I couldn’t even get pants on under these.” Harry was definitely whining.
The fact that Malfoy didn’t remember anything about the attack was frustrating. All Harry had to go on was a beating, a rock through a window, and unbroken wards.
“I enjoyed you watching me. And as much as I love my toys, nothing is better than the real thing.” Malfoy rotated his hips, grinding his arse on Harry’s erection. “It’s so much hotter, so much harder. Filling my hole with a hot, pulsing cock is so, so much better than any toy.”
Her eyebrows furrowed doubtfully before she said briskly, “alright, this isn't getting me anywhere. Done is done and I'll deal with the complications later. Now, how are your parasites?”
“That is not being your tea,” Kreacher added helpfully from behind Harry.
“I'll tell her I'll be there in an hour,” Harry countered.
He pushed through the crowd for a few minutes before finally finding Mary at a small table near the dance floor.  She was idly pushing ice around in her mostly empty glass as Harry sat next to her.
“This be having nothing to do with canceling your Life Debt, boy, and you know it,” she snapped with triumph in her eyes.
At first, all Harry could see was a stone floor. He was gliding down it, but not like he was walking. There were a set of loud footsteps and Harry could just barely make out boots striding on either side of him in his periphery. Indistinct voices in the distance slowly grew clearer as they approached. Harry thought he could hear Malfoy’s voice, sharp and impatient.
Harry felt something poking his hip and found the dildo Malfoy had used before. He grabbed it and held it up to Malfoy’s mouth.
“And they won’t because they are going to learn a lesson
Kreacher nodded forcefully, looking relieved.
“That is an evasion,” Hermione accused scathingly. “You will answer my questions, you horrible –”
“Starbucks,” Harry said.
Harry dressed in jeans and a warm jumper then went downstairs and hoped to God that there was a fresh kettle on.
“So it was a Confundus Charm? Imperious? Did you forced her into agreement?”
Mary shook his hand uncertainly. “Pleased to meet you.”
“Well,” Malfoy said offhandedly, “everyone knows about her… affiliation with you.”
Ginny had pity in her eyes as she said, “you’re always trying to be there for everyone. You can’t save him, Harry. He doesn’t deserve to be saved.” She softly placed her hand on his cheek. “He’ll use you if he can, you know that.” She brought her mouth to his and whispered, “let me save you this time. I’ll make him leave.”
“I wasn’t serious!” he exclaimed.
“Okay, why?”
“No. And it is not very bloody comfortable either.”
Malfoy looked like he'd been slapped. “
“I should have just sat on my hands and let your mum do all the work? I do have some resources, Malfoy,” Harry said dryly.
Kreacher began twisting his ears brutally. “They is being torn and soiled so badly, Kreacher is not being able to mend them. I is throwing them away.”
Almost an hour later, Harry’s perusal was interrupted by Malfoy, who was holding a bag. He cocked his head at Harry and said, “I thought you already got him a present.”
, Harry thought with wild panic,
organizational skills? Your crap is everywhere! I thought your mum was sending a few things, not the entire contents of Malfoy Manor!”
“I’m sorry, what?” Harry asked, hoping to God he’d heard wrong.
Harry groaned into his hands.
“There’s – I have to – Doxies,” Harry lied wildly. “Doxies are shredding my upholstery. I have to go. Right now.”
found nothing.”
“Whatever. Can you just change so we can go?”
Malfoy swallowed and nodded.
“It’s only seven.”
Adrenaline prickled under Harry’s skin. He felt a buzz of excited composure settle over him and a small, pleasant smile pulled at the corners of his mouth.
“Sure did.”
“No.”
A weak groan came from the pile.
Harry fought a smile. “Kreacher, were you withholding the good tea until Malfoy apologized?”
Well, that only provided Harry with more questions. Sterile environment for
“Merlin’s fucking balls, Potter! It was some slap and tickle! Leave it the fuck alone!”
He did, but everyone else is still on there: James, Lily, Al. Teddy and Andromeda. Harry himself. But with Ginny gone and the children's hands all pointing to School, Harry's face on his clock hand looks as lost as the location it's pointing to.
When they've settled back down, Draco asks: "Were you surprised by the order?"
Quite the change in attitude.
"Did you do that? It's beautiful."
Harry grins. "I'd never have guessed you were one."
This letter leaves a soft smile on Harry's face. He's so very glad things are going well for Ron and Hermione.
But Draco replies with a smile in his voice: "Neither have I."
Malfoy's eyes are oddly expressionless. "I have a few months left of my community service. Not sure what it will be."
other people, making jokes at their expense. Things like self-deprecation, or laughing at themselves, had been completely unknown to Draco and his friends.
But insulting this lady probably isn't the right way to go, even if she is admittedly a little snooty.
It was bound to happen, it's happening now, and Draco is scared by the intensity of his emotion: he's falling in love, fast.
Hogwarts.
"Hi," she says. "You're Harry, right? I'm Eir."
But his exhaustion and dark mood don't have much to do with the present at all. It's all those years leading up to now that finally caught up with him.
Despite Draco's request, they're in no hurry. They take their time exploring each other. Harry's skin is so smooth underneath Draco's fingertips. Draco slides his mouth down Harry's chest, across his ribs; raising goosebumps in its wake; his hand resting on Harry's thigh. Harry pulls him back up, closes his fingers around Draco's cock in a loose fist and begins to work him slowly, gently, until stars burst behind Draco's eyelids and he's begging Harry to go faster, harder...
And it's a love requited, because behind all this, beneath the brushstrokes and the sweeping lines and the hues and layers of paint, there's love shining through. Harry could never have painted these out of anything but love. It shows Draco that those moments at Hogwarts many years ago, all these memories that haunt Draco's waking hours as well as his dreams, are still alive in Harry's mind, too.
Harry nods back and walks away quickly, because it feels like he'll break if he stays.
, he chastises himself.
Even though he knew who the artist must be, he is unprepared for the impact of seeing Harry again. His palms are sweating, his mouth goes dry and his cheeks are burning.
know where she was at all times. He'd only know if she was at Home (which he already knew she wouldn't be, at least not their home at Grimmauld Place), at The Burrow, Work, School, Travelling, Lost or in Mortal Peril. "And if it's that last option, I'd like to think I'd come to your aid whether we're divorced or not."
you going to do?"
Draco's eyes fall shut of their own accord and he tilts his chin up just that tiny bit, an unmistakable invitation. And Harry accepts it. His lips meet Draco's, warm and soft and tasting of salt, and it's a kiss that Draco has wanted for longer than he would ever admit.
The south of France. A holiday abroad. Harry had dreamed about this as a child - an unattainable dream back then.
While he writes the note he does wonder if it's merely an excuse to contact Draco, make him respond, but waves the thought away. It doesn't matter if it is or not.
It looks a bit like the boys' dorm, with more luxury. There's a four-poster bed, a wood-burning stove, two armchairs and a table. The door he'd thought was a closet turns out to be a bathroom, fitted out like a smaller Prefect's Bathroom with a large tub and plenty of taps.
Harry takes the easel back to London and immediately puts his own aside. From now on, this is the one he'll use, and the first thing he wants to use it for is something he's been thinking about for a while, something he's been wanting to do ever since those months at Hogwarts restoring the Room of Requirement. Those months with Draco Malfoy. Back then, Harry hadn't been skilled enough to properly execute his ideas. Now, everything is different.
He tries not to be hurt, but the evasive reply stings.
"So, what now?" Draco asks, remembering thinking the same thing back at Hogwarts and never saying it out loud.
He has no regrets leaving Hogwarts behind - he can come back here any time he wishes. Leaving Malfoy is another matter. But they haven't talked about it, whatever this is between them, and it's not very likely Malfoy would want a long-term relationship or even a short-term one. A reconstruction fling, that's what this is for both of them.
Malfoy. He's even begun to notice Malfoy's looks, which are really not bad at all now he's lost his former, perpetual expression of contempt. He used to look like he'd bitten into something foul, but these days his face is in repose, his grey eyes calm and observant. Harry hates to admit it, but Malfoy is actually quite hot.
