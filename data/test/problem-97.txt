Draco's wings fluttered in agitation. Harry's wings flared out briefly as he made a short cooing sound. Kingsley had no idea what that meant, but Draco seemed to understand. His fluttering ceased and he brought his right wing forward, carefully smoothing down his feathers. Harry chirped once in apparent approval of Draco's self-soothing method. Draco's chirped reply sounded a little sulky. Or it was all Kingsley's imagination.
Draco had worked hard to redeem his tarnished reputation. Charges against him had been dropped thanks to Harry testifying on his behalf, and so Draco had been allowed to join the Aurors. Most of the other Aurors didn't trust him and were reluctant to work with him. But, Harry had given him a chance.
They found Draco at the stove, stirring the tomato sauce and gently rocking the egg in one arm while he talked quietly. "Your daddy is a bloody idiot sometimes," he said softly. "But he takes care of us. He loves us so much. And your Uncle Ron would never let anything happen to you." He drew in a shaky breath. "We'll be alright," he added, as if the egg needed the reassurance as much as he did.
Harry stepped out of the floo and immediately caught sight of Headmistress McGonagall. "Welcome back," she said with a smile. "Come right in."
Draco stared at Harry with wide eyes. Thoughts tumbled through his mind, fighting to gain his focus. After a few moments, Draco placed his hand next to Harry's on his stomach, where their child rested. "So, I guess we're doing this," Draco managed to say with a watery smile.
“I never said I was enjoying it,” Ron retorted stubbornly, letting out a sharp yelp when Hermione elbowed him.
A few minutes later, the medi-witch returned and marched right over to Harry, handing him the other twin. Harry froze for a moment, but relaxed when the baby reached up and tried to grab Harry's glasses.
"I think it was a lovely wedding," Pansy noted as Ron handed the egg to Draco. Ron had smugly carried the egg around for most of the evening.
Harry paused. "Me and you? Or the idea of two men shagging in a giant bird nest?" Harry questioned with a snort, nibbling Draco's earlobe.
Hermione cast a few spells, humming to herself. Draco remained perfectly still, glad that she was willing to check him over so thoroughly each day. After a moment she smiled. "The baby is fine," she announced. She grinned at Draco's relieved expression and then prepared some tea.
Luna came over shortly before Hermione arrived. She kissed Draco's cheek before dragging Harry up the stairs. Draco watched them go with a curious frown but contented himself by eating one of the biscuits Harry had made.
Oh, how Harry despised this woman. She didn't care who she hurt so long as she got an interesting story to publish. She'd made Harry's life difficult on numerous occasions. But, her animagus form made her an excellent snoop.
Draco grinned as Harry passed James to Ron. "Come on then," Draco said, grabbing Harry's hand and heading for the back door. Ron followed them out, kissing the baby's soft cheek as he went.
Draco had already agreed to marry him. This was just a matter of timing and planning. Did he really need the huge dramatic event that Malfoys usually had? No. He only needed Harry.
Harry remained silent, pondering the experience. Now that he was past the bewilderment and embarrassment, it hasn't been so bad. Trelawney was nice enough and something about the whole thing made Harry feel...better.
"I'm boiling," Harry muttered, tossing his outer robes aside and opening a few buttons of his shirt. He glanced up to see that Draco was rolling up his shirt sleeves and casting a cooling charm. The charm was little help.
"Scorpius, will you dance with me?" Neville asked, holding his arms out for the little blond. He leaned close to Scorpius, as if to tell a secret, but he spoke loud enough for the others to hear. "I think your Papa really wants to kiss your Daddy right now."
Harry had begun struggling to get up, so Ron helped him out of the bed. As soon as he was upright, Harry nearly fell backwards from the extra weight of the wings. Ron rebalanced him gently and helped Harry to move toward Draco.
"Forget how to use your wand?" Ron grumbled, though he did walk over and retrieve the chocolates that she wanted.
"Are you okay darling?" Harry asked striding over to Draco and stroking his cheek. He shut the stove off and gathered Draco to his chest, resting one hand against the egg gently.
"I see," Narcissa said thoughtfully. She was curious about the sound Draco made, but she knew that it wouldn't be wise to ask what it meant. So, she changed the subject. "Darling, you mustn't let your father upset you," she said, stroking her son's hair. "He's shocked and worried. But he'll come around."
Harry stirred two hours later, moaning softly in pain before his eyes fluttered open. "Ron," he whispered, wincing as he shifted in the bed. "Where's Malfoy? Is he alright?"
"It's alright," Harry assured him. "You're welcome here. Why don't you stay? At least for a few days while your father gets over his tantrum. I really don't mind," he added with a genuine smile.
“He’ll be along shortly,” Pansy replied.  “He said something about checking on the food selection.  The house elves seem to have forgotten the treacle tart, and he said that it’s your favorite.”
Harry and Draco spent their day doing paperwork or going over case files. It was far less exciting than field work, but they were glad to be able to help with cases. They even solved two cases right from their office.
"Perhaps you should drink less if you feel it's a problem," Narcissa noted, dabbing at her lips primly.
"Grant doesn't know," Ron said, nodded pointedly at Draco. "I let him think that you two decided to take a step back during the investigation. Draco was pretty rattled the last time you two were at the office, and Grant saw that. Seems like a good cover story. There's too much at stake here. I'm not going to risk three lives by taking an unnecessary risk. I trust Kingsley completely, and he vouches for Robards. Nobody else knows."
"Fine," Pansy conceded, waving her hand dismissively at him. "Weasley here helped me to get the last of the sweets. I've just got to pay for it now." She hurried over to the store clerk, leaving Draco with the two ex-Gryffindors.
Draco gently placed baby James in Harry's arms. "Harry Potter, we will fill this house with children if that's what you want," Draco said.
Harry swallowed hard, nodding. He reached out and gave Draco's hand a reassuring squeeze. "What do we need to know?" he asked Hermione.
"Put it back," Draco instructed suddenly. "If you destroy it or through it out, he'll know we're on to him."
Harry thought his heart might melt. He was sure that Draco would be very glad to be rid of the remainder of the weird pregnancy hormones, but Harry fervently hoped that he'd never see an end of these beautifully sentimental moments. As prickly as he was sometimes, Draco possessed a tender heart that Harry adored.
After a few cleaning charms, Harry gathered Draco into his arms for a cuddle. A glance at the clock told him that it was past midnight. Christmas Day. "Today is our anniversary," Harry said softly.
Harry's eyes were intent on the screen. A wistful little smile tugged at his lips. It wasn't terribly noticeable, but Draco spotted the expression anyway. Harry wanted romance and to be loved. Seemed like an obvious thing, but it hadn't occurred to Draco before. Why would it? They were auror partners and friends and the last two months had been spent dealing with their... condition.
Ron moved closer with a nod from Hermione, climbing into the nest next to Draco. He reached underneath and cupped the egg as it finally came out completely. He pulled it to his chest, cradling it in his arms as Draco collapsed on his side.
"I seem to recall participating," Draco responded, frowning at Harry. "There's no point in blaming yourself."
Harry did as he was told, coming to rest so he was facing Draco. Once he was settled, Ron leaned over and carefully placed the egg between them. He exchanged a grin with Hermione as the couple stared in awe.
Harry had just finished his lunch when there was a loud knock on the door. He went to the door and opened it cautiously. He threw it wide open when he saw Draco.
Harry pulled the spoon back out of his mouth slowly, humming with pleasure.  “It’s brilliant,” he assured Draco.  “Best I’ve ever had.”
Draco wasn't particularly interested in the romance part of the film. Why would he want to watch someone else fall in love? They did stupid things and there was always a betrayal or some sort of misunderstanding that was utterly ridiculous. But, the comedy part sounded promising.
"Thank you," Draco responded. He hummed happily as he but into one of the eggrolls. After swallowing, he glanced at his egg pensively. "It's strange isn't it? This consuming love for a tiny person you haven't even met yet... I just can't get over it."
"We'll get out of your way so he can sleep," Hermione said. She gave Draco a brief, searching look before leaving, followed quickly by the others.
Harry rested himself between Draco's thighs, his fingers stroking over sensitive nipples as he swallowed Draco's cock. Draco's eyes rolled back as he was enveloped with wet heat. He couldn't remember the last time something had felt so amazing. The alcohol swirling through his system would likely make this a shorter experience than Draco wanted, but it couldn't be helped at that moment.
Auror Green paused and knelt down between Draco and Ron. "You'll let us know how he is?" he asked quietly, glancing at Harry.
"Kingsley," Harry answered with a little shrug. "How do you think you managed to have your probation period shortened?"
"Possibly," Harry said with a smile, kissing Draco's forehead. "I think you're hilarious, so I can't make any promises."
Generally, Draco took on a dominant role in their shared life. Harry was happy to allow it. Draco was the disciplinarian in the household while Harry was more nurturing. They loved their children fiercely and kept each other balanced.
Harry was pleasantly full and a little tired, but he wasn't willing to go to bed yet. Draco seemed to agree as he coaxed Harry onto the large fluffy cushion they always shared. Draco set up a movie to play before settling in beside Harry. Draco relaxed on his side, propped up on one elbow. He was surprised when Harry rolled over to face him instead of watching the movie.
Rita Skeeter spent a few months trying to catch Grant participating in nefarious activities or meeting with his cohorts. She collected information whenever she could, secretly reporting it all to Ron. She was rather eager to be credited with her research as well as getting access to whatever secret Harry was hiding.
Draco smiled at the idea. He really didn't want to deal with Rita Skeeter, but Harry had made a deal. Probably best to get it over with. He glanced at his watch before moving to the kitchen to make tea. Rita would be there any moment.
Harry's anxious thoughts faltered, when something brushed against his knee. He glanced down to see Draco shift his leg closer, firmly pressing his knee against Harry's. Harry looked back up to find Draco's eyes on him. "Having a good time?" Draco asked, reaching up to smooth down Harry's hair gently.
Ginny and Luna came downstairs warily, taking in the bound wizards, broken furniture and Harry Potter, soaked in blood. Ginny was holding the egg in her arms, determined to keep it warm.
"Belladonna," Draco croaked, his hands shaking. "There's belladonna mixed into that tea. And..." He picked the tin back up and cracked the lid to take another cautious whiff. "A bit of aconite as well."
Ron halted at the tone and shot Harry a curious look. He rolled his eyes when he noticed Harry's very obvious erection. "Mate, put that away when you've got company," he said with a smirk.
Draco sobbed and dropped to his knees, turning to cradle Harry's face in his hands. "Harry," he whimpered.
"It's an instinctual response," Pansy explained. "Draco's not been pleased with some of the more involuntary behaviors. They react sometimes without thought."
“Boyfriend?” Draco asked with a little smirk.  “I don’t recall ever making such a commitment to you scar-head.”
Draco immediately dropped his pretentious attitude. "You ought to let me be the judge of that," he said quietly. He stood up, feeling more determined than ever. "I need to go but are you working tomorrow?"
"Get on the bed before I fall on you," Harry panted, biting his lip as Draco slowly pulled off. Harry kissed him swiftly before urging the blond into the altered pillow nest.
"We're not tearing into each other you insensitive troll," Draco growled, glaring at Ron. "We got a little distracted, but we're not mindless animals. And this is new," he added, dropping a kiss onto Harry's head. "No rush."
Hermione and Ron exchanged a look that puzzled the two former Slytherins. "Harry's..." Ron paused, looking away awkwardly. "We don't see him as much."
Draco waved him on, watching eagerly as Harry apparated to the roof of the house. Draco held is wand up for Harry to see, indicating that he was ready to assist if it didn't go well. He watched with bated breath as Harry leapt into the air.
At that moment the door opened and Ron walked in. He looked toward Harry's desk and saw what appeared to be a shirtless Draco Malfoy playing with his own nipples. Behind Malfoy's desk was Harry, reaching behind himself to cup his own arse cheeks with a mildly impressed expression. "What the hell are you doing?" Ron blurted out. "Malfoy, why are you fondling your nipples? Harry, what the hell? Why are you both half naked?"
"What about what I want?" Harry demanded, beginning to look like he was tempted to join Hermione in having a good cry.
Kingsley pulled a small bottle of veritaserum from one pocket and poured three drops into one prisoner's mouth. A moment later, the wizard's face went slack and his eyes became glassy. Satisfied, Kingsley looked at Ron expectantly.
Draco scowled. "I never said we didn't want to," he retorted. "We're taking our time getting there. It's Harry. We only get one first time together, and it's important to me."
"You are allowing the adoption?" Kingsley asked uncertainly. When she nodded through her tears, he smiled. "Let's get some paperwork started." He looked at Lucius. "If you could inform them that they need to see me when they're done here?" When Lucius agreed, Robards and Kingsley escorted Celia out.
They had to travel to the DMLE by using the floo directly to their office. The other Aurors had been alerted to the situation and urged to keep the information confidential.
"You are most welcome Maddie," Draco replied fondly. "I have to go now, but I will see you again very soon." He let out a startled gasp when Maddie and three other small children nearly bowled him over in an embrace that was more tackle than hug.
"That's fine too," Ron replied with a little shrug. "We'll do what makes you feel better. If it turns out that movie day is too much, we can push that back too. I explained to the others. They're not upset."
"I'd love that," Harry said, his smile softening. "We'll wait a bit of course, but if you're willing..." He trailed off, stroking against Draco's abdomen lovingly.
The months that followed were as hectic as one might imagine with three young children. Grimmauld Place was deemed unsuitable for raising children and Harry didn't feel comfortable with Malfoy Manor, so Draco bought a house that was still too large but it made Harry happy.
Harry allowed his wings to relax and droop, and he chirped happily when he felt Draco's chest press against his back. For a moment they remained still, upright on their knees and panting softly. And then Draco rolled his hips. Harry sighed, dropping his head back onto Draco's shoulder.
Pansy smiled widely. "He said that love was the greastest gift that he could ever give," she told Harry, pride seeping into her tone as reached out to squeeze Draco's hand.
"Let's go in," Harry said, turning to go inside. "We'll have dinner and get you settled for the night."
Draco grinned and spun them around to push Harry into the wall.  He pressed their bodies together, smiling at Harry’s flustered expression.  Draco brushed one hand down Harry’s side before sliding it between them and pressing his palm to Harry’s crotch.  He was pleased to feel Harry growing firm beneath him.  “Why don’t we enjoy the rest of the party, and then you can put this to good use,” Draco said, giving Harry’s erection a teasing squeeze.
"It's alright," Ron told the toddlers. "She won't hurt you." He smiled as Harry relaxed slightly and allowed Draco to continue patting his leg. Ron reached out to Draco and tickled Draco's tummy, sending the boy into a fit of giggles. Then Ron reached for Harry, pausing when Harry covered his tummy with his hands warily. Ron moved back to Draco, chuckling when the blond laughed, squirmed and fell over. Draco sat back up excitedly. Ron looked at Harry again, delighted when the boy moved his hands, shyly offering his tummy for tickles.
Grandma Malfoy was killed by her husband when Father was my age, as the Malfoy name had a reputation, and nobody could discover that we're partbreds. Father had killed Grandma Black in front of me, when he caught her telling me about the prowess of the Veela. Great Grandma Black was killed by Aunt Bella, but that was before I was born.
He gets cut off by long, slender fingers that reach around to grab the nape of his neck in an unyielding grip, yanking him forward to meet a pale pink pout.
"Of course he has," says the redhead. I could never be a Weasel like him. "I'm his second, who's yours?" Oh fuck. I wanted to be alone. I look to the paid imbeciles on either side of me, trying to think of a lie.
"I was right." Her voice can hardly be considered a whisper. Leaning into my ear, she continues, "it is euphoric."
So instead she stands there, staring at Draco; too afraid to punish him, too cowardly to stop him, and hating herself for it all the more. Her husband steps in instead.
original author's notes literally just say that party rock has not been in the house tonight for many months. yeah. anyways comments are nice
"Right here," comes Harry's growling voice from immediately behind him. He then is engulfed in thick, muscular arms and an invisibility cloak is thrown over his head as Potter leans in to sniff at Dracos neck. Draco moans breathlessly, arching into Harry's chest when Potter's hands rub his front. Blood rushes straight down South, then Draco is being pulled through a door that hadn't been there a moment before.
"Oh, well, Draco," Adelphi growls, baring fanglike teeth, "you and I share some desires, it seems. No, I don't smell Potter, I smell blood. I smell decay. I smell sweat and grime and the filthy stench of sex. We aren't that different, you know..." I doubt that. "Ha! You think I'm lying! How cute.
Harry spins the bottle with an odd amount of gusto, groaning loudly when he sees just who the bottle had landed on.
In my bedside drawers I kept incriminating pictures cropped from magazines like Witch Weekly. I'd often pull out my small vial of Amortentia, breathe in his scent, and wank while staring at a bare-chested moving photo held in my hand. Needless to say, I'm infatuated. And Merlin, how I wish to see him in action.
"How?" Potter looks completely bewildered and somewhat scared, and that's when Draco realizes that he's never done this before.
Snap! Dobby casts a sealing spell on the entrance, preventing Potter and his redheaded tumor from hopping on the train.
Harry flicks his tongue against Dracos pinkened rim, Draco keening in response. It was a glorious noise, and only egged Harry on - almost as though in a Veela-induced trance. {Wink wonk} Potter's tongue flutters forward once more, and Draco continues to thrust on his hand. Grabbing the lube (Draco whining at the loss of the hands around his waist), Harry slicks two fingers before pulling away.
Harry had plunged two fingers into him, twisting his hand gently at any tightness within the unforgiving heat of Malfoys arse. Draco, moaning loudly, cants his hips up to make Potter's thick digits go ever deeper, pulling at Harry's dark nest of hair to guide his mouth to Dracos perineum, where he sucks heartily.
The feast on Hallows Eve was amazing as ever, live bats flew through the Hall, giant Jack o Lanterns flanked the walls. It was extraordinary, and I had to wonder if I could transform partway without being noticed amongst the many costumes.
"No you don't, Dray," Blaise says, absently petting Klaus, who is currently covered in short, silky fur. In a few weeks time he will be fluffy, but for now he's very sleek.
Bellatrix had gone insane. Andromeda got disowned. And Narcissa? She's afraid. Fear is all she's known. Her entire existence is based on hate, cowardice, and fear. And she mustn't subject her son to the same. She can't.
"Did-did she?" He whispers. I nearly kick him into oblivion right there. What an idiot. I didn't want him to see that, but now it's too late. He just stares at it, mouth opening and closing like a dumb koi.
Just as I'm stood on a pedestal, an older witch pinning my robes, another boy walks in. Now, I've thought Blaise was quite attractive before, but this kid was on a whole other level. His hair is darker than the night, his smooth skin the color of my favorite salted caramel, his bright green eyes shielded by very adorable(yet filthy and broken) glasses. I must have him be my friend.
"Oh, sorry... But they were our kind, weren't they?" I'm nearly begging him, I want Father to approve of him.
"Never have I ever...." Hermione trails off, turning to meet Harry's gaze. "I've never become obsessed with someone, stalking them around the clock, knowing their location at all times and losing interest in my personal life, justifying this with a hunch that they were quote unquote 'up to something.'"
"Let's go visit the elves, yeah?" I nudge her shoulder, shaking her gently as she attempts to snuggle further into my chest. My fingers slide down her body to tickle her sides, making her giggle. "Come on, let's go!" Gritting my teeth, I add more pressure. She jumps up, pulls a pillow from next to my head, and I dodge just in time to make her miss my head with her vicious swing.
Waves of pleasure wash over him, sparks zinging up his spine and Draco can't help but moan like his life depends on it. To Harry, it's music. The breathy little whines and loud moans wrested from the blond put Potter in a trance. He loosens up Draco with urgency, doing his absolute best to make the part Veela feel beyond amazing.
Draco turned to look at her with a frown. "You're going to let him be alone for Christmas?" he asked.
It wasn't the eating itself that had Harry so enthralled though. In just under two month's time, Draco's abdomen had enlarged impressively. He looked to be at least eight months pregnant.
Baby Daniel kept them busy. He started walking nice and early, and he seemed to delight in making his fathers chase after him. Tom was a calm, quiet baby. He was content to cuddle when his twin was squealing and tumbling about the house. It was Tom that had suddenly taken to calling Harry "mummy" and Daniel had joined in rather quickly. Harry would roll his eyes when Draco laughed about it, but they both knew that Harry was pleased.
Harry cleaned them up as soon as he'd caught his breath. He instantly began gently stroking Draco's stomach again.
Narcissa and Harry were keeping calm and chatting amiably. They got along remarkably well and Draco was grateful for that. They seemed content to ignore Lucius and the aggressive way he was eating his potatoes.
Draco hummed his agreement, allowing Harry to help him stand. He threw one of the chips at Ron as he passed.
Ron paced in the waiting room at Saint Mungos, his eyes unfocused as he remembered the condition he'd found Harry and Draco in. Their screams of pain still echoed in his mind. Even after they had passed out from the pain, they still groaned and shuddered.
Harry smiled, his hand coming up to comb his fingers through soft blond hair. He smiled as Draco sighed happily. He shifted closer, lowering his head to kiss Draco's lips, his hand settling to cradle the back of Draco's head.
The antidote worked more quickly than the original potion. After ten minutes, Draco had returned to his appropriate size and age. His robes had been charmed to grow with him. Finding himself naked would not have gone over well.
"You're forgiven," Draco chuckled. He say up a little straighter and fixed Harry with a look of determination. "You and I are going to become the best of friends."
It had only been three weeks since the day Draco had walked back into Harry's life. So much had happened during that time. And now Harry's heart felt warmer than it had in years as he stared down at the sleeping face of his ex-rival.
Harry didn't look well. He seemed tired and there were dark circles under his eyes. He still had the muscular build of an auror, but he was starting to look a bit thin. His hair was even more disheveled than usual and he'd not bothered to shave in a few days. "You look like shite," Draco said bluntly.
Draco shook his head. "It's fine Harry," he soothed. "I wanted you. Badly. I don't regret it and I hope that you don't either."
Harry had always been a little reckless. He supposed that his heart was too. The love that Harry had resigned himself to never find was overflowing and soothing his battered soul.
"I can list several other pregnancies where she predicted the gender," Hermione said. "It's ridiculous, but she's right every time. If she says you're having a girl, then we better be prepared for the birth of a little princess."
Ron stood up, balancing Harry on his hip, to move around Harry's desk and grab a biscuit from the tin that Harry kept in his office. Harry accepted the biscuit, the beginning of a smile tugging his lips upward.
Harry gave a watery smile. "I want to," he said gently. "I love Maddie too. And I stand the thought of them being split up." Harry looked at the grandmother hopefully. "We wouldn't keep them from you. You would be able to see them whenever you like."
"I like the sound of that," Draco said quietly. He leaned close and pressed soft moist kisses down Harry's neck.
Once back in McGonagall's office, Draco turned to the headmistress expectantly. "Are there any students I should be aware of?" he asked. She handed him a list and he was pleased to see that she'd included a few students from all four houses. She'd also noted what sort of difficulty each child had. For some the issue was financial. Some were bullied. Some were neglected or abused.
"Good morning Potter," Draco said politely. He waited for a moment while Harry stared at him. "May I come in? It's rather frigid out here, being December and all."
Pansy returned a moment later with her purchase. "All done," she said cheerfully. She looked over at Ron and Hermione. "So, what have you done with Potter?" she asked. "It's odd seeing you two without him."
Draco sighed as Harry moved around the bed and gently maneuvered Draco's wings as Draco layed down. Harry smoothed the feathers down slowly, smirking when Draco chirped involuntarily.
"They're not horrible," Draco admitted. "I like it when they're funny. But I don't see the point of you girls sobbing over a couple too moronic to properly get it together until the end."
"You called her a whore just yesterday," Harry mentioned, pouring a glass of pumpkin juice for Draco.
"Daddy crying again," James muttered, reaching out to brush away the lone tear the was making it's way down Draco's cheek. "You okay Daddy?"
For a moment, the hospital room was silent and tense. Then Draco shook his head. "Everything happens to us," he muttered ruefully. "It's getting ridiculous."
Draco sighed reminding himself that Pansy had offered to help and it wouldn't be wise to antagonize her. "My apologies," he said dutifully. "I've just got my hands full." He lifted the bags slightly, hoping to gain her sympathy.
"I'm giving you permission to try it," Harry reasoned. "That's why I got up. It's too small for two people. Just for a moment. If you like it, we'll make one for you later."
"Nothing," Draco assured him. "It's just-" He bit his lip, his wings fluttering. "I'd like to top this time. Would that be alright?"
After a late breakfast, they worked together to get ready for movie night. Only Ron and Hermione had seen their wings and they were feeling a little apprehensive about being with the whole group. They tidied the living room and planned what dinner would be. The original plan had been for roasted chicken, but the thought of eating any kind of bird made them queasy. So Harry decided that steaks would be a better option.
"So now we've got to figure out why they are trying to become birds," Ron sighed. "I'll go update Robards and Kingsley." He left the room with a tired wave.
"That's partly because I enjoy you being pregnant too," Harry admitted. "You're so beautiful with your belly so round and full. I haven't the slightest idea how you manage to still be so graceful. And the thought that you sacrifice your own comfort to make our babies healthy... Draco, I love you more than I can say," Harry said tenderly. "So cry when you need to. Complain about back pain or ask me to pick weird shit up when you have a craving. I cherish every moment of it."
Hermione rolled her eyes at Pansy’s theatrics.  She watched as Draco was momentarily distracted by another guest and Harry walked away to look at the Christmas tree situated in one corner of the ballroom.  It twinkled with fairy lights and was covered with beautiful sparkling baubles.
Draco hadn't given much thought to having children. He was expected to produce an heir, but it wasn't a pressing issue. His career had taken priority. He was still young after all.
Draco leaned forward eagerly. "I knew that bitch wasn't telling me something," he said. "She knows that I live for gossip right now since I can't go anywhere. So cough it up," he commanded. "Are you shagging her?"
"Neither can I," Harry agreed with a wide smile. "I'm so excited, but terrified at the same time. And... I love our baby so much," he added softly. His wings streteched out behind him, one of them curling around Draco slightly.
James cheered and clapped his hands, but Scorpius looked a little perplexed. "Do you like baby Rose, Scorp?" Harry asked. He smiled when Scorpius nodded. "Well, we will have a new baby too!"
"He looks amazing," Ginny commented. "Leave it to Draco to still look disgustingly gorgeous at the end of pregnancy."
Draco stormed into the house wordlessly. His feathers were all ruffled and his wings were a bit stiff with tension. His jaw was clenched in obvious anger.
Pansy released Draco and gave a joyful cry. Harry's eyes were open and focused tenderly on his husband.
Harry winked at Ron before pressing another sweet kiss to Draco's lips. Then he shuffled back and helped Draco to sit up. As Draco got to his feet, Harry picked up their egg, dropping a little kiss to the shell. Draco looked rather pleased by the gesture, smiling to himself as he grabbed the little nest.
Draco looked like an angel with his wings stretched out wide and a smile on his face. "They're beautiful," Harry said admiring the gleaming feathers.
"Here you go Love," Draco said, kissing Harry sweetly and handing him the champagne. "You're looking ridiculously sexy in those dress robes. I'm looking forward to taking them off of you."
Draco gasped softly as he stepped into the bedroom he shared with Harry. Their nest had dark red rose petals scattered all over it. There were lit candles on the end tables and dressers. Soft music was floating through the room.
Ron watched anxiously as Hermione coaxed Draco into pushing the egg out. Ron was actually in the perfect position to watch it happen. The rounded edge of a pale bluish shell emerged from the straining flesh of the cloaca. Draco let out a sob, triggering a sob from Harry. Hermione's eyes were damp, but she kept up her encouragement and carefully rubbing the salve around Draco's tortured flesh.
Draco was lying on his side, his face screwed up in pain. His arm was stretched out to brush his fingers over the egg, which was resting in the little nest, next to the cushion. Harry was seated on the cushion and tenderly rubbing a salve onto Draco's stomach.
Draco came hard, gasping for breath as he rode out his orgasm. His wings trembled around him. Harry followed him into bliss, his own wings flaring out wide.
Hermione sighed heavily, shaking her head. She was a healer at Saint Mungos. Upon hearing about the incident, she'd retrieved a sample of the potion and immediately started brewing an antidote. It would have caused too much of an uproar to bring the boys to the hospital, so she'd gone to them instead. Her colleagues were taking care of the other victims. "They need to drink this," she said seriously, holding up two baby bottles containing a pale blue potion. "We'll have to do it one at a time so I can monitor them."
Draco blushed. "Frankly, I'm not certain of how anyone can resist you," he said. He bit his lower lip. "I'd love to continue keeping you company. Whatever you need."
"Alright, would like a biscuit Draco?" Ron amended. He grinned when Draco nodded eagerly, holding out one tiny hand expectantly. Ron complied, smiling when Draco muttered something that was probably supposed to be a thank you.
Outside, Draco gazed up at the cloudy skies. His feathers lifted and shivered with the breeze. Autumn had arrived and it seemed to be the perfect time to fly.
"We were pranked by the potion division," Harry explained. "I'm pretty sure it was Davis that slipped the potion into our coffee. They've done a great job with the new formula."
"Mrs. Malfoy made the reservation," Blaise explained, walking toward the table. "She compensated them handsomely for allowing us to have the place to ourselves."
Pansy accepted, taking the seat next to Ron. She was delighted when he pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.
Draco waited for a few moments and then shifted a bit, propping himself up on his right arm. He reached with his left hand and stroked down soft gray feathers.
"Please," Draco scoffed. "I think he was, perhaps, a little intimidated. But, I don't think it's going to run him off." He gave her a questioning look. "Did you give him a blow job?"
"This is Draco," Pansy said, patting Draco's arm. She giggled when Harry gave her a disbelieving look.
Harry shuddered as he crouched behind a large dense shrub. The magic in the air was potent and wicked. Draco was kneeling, listening to the strange chanting from the group of wizards that stood around what appeared to be some sort of altar. Something creature been sacrificed on that altar. Judging from the number of bloodied feathers on the ground, it had probably been a large bird.
Draco’s musings were interrupted when presents were passed to him and Harry.  They opened the parcels curiously, suddenly aware that everyone was watching them.  Harry made a strange high pitched sound and blushed while Draco sputtered indignantly.  These gifts were obviously from Pansy.
He didn't mention that some of the children came from families that couldn't afford much. Most of them would be going home soon enough, but a few had illnesses or injuries that resisted the usual magical cures. Like little Maddie.
"Do Draco first," Pansy said. "He'll be insufferable if he finds out that we left him as a toddler for longer than necessary."
"Then you can be concerned about the fact that I made Harry come all over my stomach," Draco snapped.
Hermione nodded in sympathy, placing her hand over Ron’s face and pushing him away when he moved closer to get her attention.  Ron let out a huff of indignation.  “I don’t see why you went to the trouble,” Ron grumbled.  “Clearly Harry is not interested.”
Harry stood very still, allowing Rita Skeeter to look him over carefully. They were in a private room at the Hogs Head for their meeting. Ron was sitting quietly and looking at Rita expectantly.
Draco looked like he wanted flail about and screech a bit more. But he drew in a shaky breath and remained still under Harry's warm hands.
Pansy squealed in excitement. "That's wonderful!" she enthused. "I need to go get some things so I can spend the night."
As promised, Draco returned to Harry's house carrying with a basket of food. Harry watched silently while Draco set up bowls of hot soup, fresh bread and butterbeer. They sat down at the dining table and started eating.
Hermine shrugged and handed one of the bottles to Pansy. Hermione waited patiently while Draco was coaxed into drinking the potion. Ron distracted Harry by picking him up and making faces.
Harry helped Draco to his feet and greeted the Malfoys politely. He ushered them inside, hurrying into the kitchen to prepare dinner. Draco quickly decided that wine would be preferable to tea at that moment so he offered it, happy to get some alcohol in his system. He'd need it to endure his father's sour looks.
"There's so much food," Harry muttered, staring at the food laden table in shock. "Why in Merlin's name would we need this much food?"
Draco and Harry were left to enjoy their company while food and hospitality were managed by their friends. Lucius managed to make polite conversation with his son, his gaze continuously drifting to Draco's stomach.
"Just calm down," Hermione said. "Harry will alert me immediately when it's time. I'm leaving a few things here that I'll need. We'll make it as painless as possible." She lifted her wand and cast several spells, checking Draco's vitals. After several moments, she nodded, looking pleased.
Draco turned and looked around for a moment before spotting Harry.  He moved a little closer, his eyes taking in Harry’s peaceful expression.  Harry’s green eyes looked particularly bright as they reflected the glow of the fairy lights.  A smile curled his lips as he looked the tree over.
Harry laughed in delight as Draco pulled him closer and twirled them around to the rhythm of the music. The fallen snow muffled their steps and snowflakes clung to their hair. Their wings swayed with them, the wind lifting their feathers in little rippling waves.
"It's not just Christmas," Pansy said, glancing at Draco fondly. "He says that he doesn't want to save it all for Christmas. Some of his 'work' is needed all year."
"I like to watch you," Harry responded, cleaning the plate and fork with a spell. He leaned close to kiss Draco's lips. "You look so beautiful."
"I mean, the back pain is wretched and I have crying at the slightest provocation," Draco explained. "But, there's something about carrying our children, protecting and nourishing them inside my body... And you make the difficult parts of it easier for me. You get so cuddly and sweet."
Ron read over Rita's notes, his eyes going wide. Rita had managed to find the motive behind the strange rituals and attacks. These dark wizards wanted to change themselves, but had decided to test their potions and spells on others first. They had wanted to become veela.
Harry frowned, rushing over to snatch the blue tin from the counter. He muttered softly, pointing his wand at it. He gasped when the product label peeled away to reveal a small slip of parchment. Harry plucked the parchment from the tin and looked it over, his expression turning grim. "It's a tracking spell. Clever bastard," he muttered bitterly.
Harry was a little more slim then Draco, and he seemed much more timid. He sat on the floor with one thumb in his mouth while his green eyes darted warily between Ron and Kingsley. Both boys were still wearing their auror robes, though they'd been shrunk to fit on smaller bodies.
"It was a prank," Harry retorted looking down at the paleness of his hands in shock. He was quickly distracted by the sight of Draco's bare chest.
"I don't hate you," Draco stated. "And as a Malfoy, I'm expected to make demands, though that's not why I'm here."
"I've actually got to meet with Kingsley," Ron said. "I just wanted to show you what Rita got for us."
Draco turned to face Harry with wide eyes. "It's alright Harry," he assured. "I can do this. I wouldn't expect you to take responsibility for my decisions."
"I suppose," Trelawney relented reluctantly. "I was certain that I saw three children... But if you prefer men you cannot have children." Her shoulders sagged with disappointment.
Ron got up and carried the now clean egg to the nest. Draco's eyes lit up despite his fatigue. "Come get on this side Harry," Ron instructed.
The sweet little voice made Hermione and Ron freeze and exchange a look of shock. They knew only one man named Draco.
Draco eyed Harry critically. It seemed that it had been a rough night. Harry looked exhausted and tense. His eyes were a bit red, but it wasn't clear if it was from fatigue or tears. Both seemed likely scenarios.
All three Malfoys remained at Harry's house while Pansy and Blaise went to see their own families. Weasley's popped over in small groups to spend a bit of time with Harry. Draco, Hermione and Ron had done a good job of coordinating and demanding exemplary behavior. There had been a lot of suspicious glaring between the Malfoys and Weasleys, but conversation had been shockingly polite.
"Yes Auntie Mione," James agreed, pressing a quick kiss to Draco's cheek before he was placed back on the floor.
"Draco Malfoy, I'm not your sodding house elf," Pansy said sharply. "You requested an alarming number of sweets but insisted that I refrain from using magic as much as I can. You can bloody well wait a moment."
They slept curled together until they heard Narcissa calling to them. They sat up slowly to find Narcissa leaning over them. She looked amused but a bit tense. Behind her was Lucius, wearing a scowl of disapproval.
There was a knock at the door and Harry moved to answer it. He waved Ron and Rita inside. "I was beginning to wonder if you planned to keep our bargain," Rita commented.
Draco and Harry's relationship had grown more affectionate, but Harry was hesitant to initiate anything. Part of him was worried that Draco was only acting as he was because of a lack of options. Harry didn't want that. If by some miracle their condition was reversed, where would that leave them? Then again, it wasn't fair to doubt Draco in that way.
Pansy rolled her eyes, but smiled indulgently. "I wonder if you'd settle a bet for Blaise and I," she said casually.
After a few moments, Draco sighed. "I'm so sorry," he whispered. "I don't know what's gotten into me."
"Of course not," Harry denied hastily. "I just... I probably should have given you a sobering potion before we did anything."
Once the gifts had been exchanged, Kreacher served tea while they chatted quietly. "You're a very impressive young man, Mr. Potter," Narcissa said, smiling slightly at Harry.
Harry grimaced but leaned closer to whisper in Draco's ear.  Draco gasped sharply, blushing even more.  Harry was relieved that Draco didn't demand further explanation.  He didn't care to discuss his topic in front of their friends.  Pansy seemed to be enjoying far too much already.
Smirking, Draco ran his hands slowly over his chest. Then he paused, a curious look on his face. He brushed his fingers over the nipples again.
"We got the shock of our lives," Hermione said quietly. "I believe they were having so much pain from the growth of the wings. When they finally tore through the skin..." She trailed off, closing her eyes tightly. "It was horrible. The feathers sprouted after a few moments."
Pansy smiled slightly. "I never suspected he had it in him," she admitted. "He's especially fond of Christmas and he goes to great lengths to bring a bit of joy to others."
Harry smiled and cast a few spells to clean up the mess they'd made. Once they were no longer sticky, he turned Draco so they were laying on their sides, face to face and they drifted to sleep.
"These aren't for him, and I'm doing him a favor," Pansy hissed with a scowl. She relaxed a little when Hermione have him a sharp poke in the side and a disapproving look. "Draco is quite a philanthropist these days. He's always donating money, visiting the hospitals..." She frowned slightly. "Of course, that's not common knowledge."
Maddie's face lit up with joy when Draco and Harry entered her hospital room. "You came!" she cried excitedly.
Harry didn't seem bothered at all by Draco's reaction. He only seemed to concern himself with Draco's comfort. Fighting against his instincts would only make Draco more restless and unhappy. So, he kept a watchful eye on his precious offspring while he ate his dinner.
"Sorry," Hermione said, giving Ron a look that was clearly a demand for him to not speak. "We saw him at the hospital just yesterday. The children seemed to love him."
"Listen Weasley... Take a few days off," Green urged lightly. "The rest of us will will cover your work load."
"So now people know," Draco said with a little sigh. "We'll be able to leave the house some now. Though I don't care to take James out in public yet."
"I really wasn't as bad off as you seem to think," Draco replied. "I have a slight headache, but otherwise I feel fine. You did nothing wrong. In fact, it was so right that I think I need a repeat performance," he said slyly, reaching down to stroke Harry's erection. He slid his tongue into Harry's mouth as he pressed their groins together, bring one leg up to curl over Harry's hip.
"Where's Potter?" Drano demanded, standing up slowly. His eyes widened when he saw Harry sitting in Ron's lap.
"You still with me?" Harry asked, lifting his head to meet Draco's gaze. His fingers were still gently thrusting into Draco, carefully stretching him. "What are you thinking about?"
“Harry spotted the mistletoe and he’s heading toward Draco,” Pansy gasped, swatting at Hermione’s arm frantically.
Ron and Pansy passed the time by playing with the two year old aurors. Draco loved the attention and babbled happily at them. Harry was all shy smiles and sweet snuggles.
Luna had given them a large box that contained a smaller version of Harry and Draco's nest. "It's charmed to maintain its shape so you can keep the egg close by," Luna explained. "If you come downstairs or go to a friend's house, bring the nest."
Draco took a deep breath. "Mother, we've discovered that my avian side is...female," he explained awkwardly. "I'm... We're expecting," he said, resting one hand on his stomach.
The couple soared through the sky, delighting in the freedom of it. They hadn't flown much during the winter and they'd missed it. When they'd worn themselves out, they sprawled out in the grass, letting the sun warm their feathers.
Pansy smiled as Draco levitated the tray into the next room where their friends were waiting. She hadn't expected such restraint from Harry and Draco considering the affection that they readily displayed. She'd never known Draco to place such emotional value on physical intimacy. She wondered if he was fully aware of how hard he had fallen for Harry Potter.
Draco rolled his eyes. "It's not as if we do that in public," he retorted. "Harry's yard is warded to prevent prying eyes and intruders. Not that we have reason to feel shame. It's perfectly natural." At least he thought it was. They didn't exactly have any examples to follow. Hermione hadn't found any books on human/bird hybrid etiquette, so they assumed that such a text didn't exist. So, they did what seemed appropriate to them. Lucius didn't need to know that they were making it up as they went along though.
"To make a amends," Draco replied without hesitation. He smiled slightly at Harry's startled expression. "I've spend my time since the war re-defining myself. I'm not who I was when we were in school. Not entirely anyway," he added with a smirk. He hesitated, his expression growing more somber. "I wanted to take the opportunity to apologize to you and make up for my mistakes. Christmas seems like a great time for that sort of thing."
Harry nodded his agreement, frowning in thought. "The next problem is to figure out how he found this house," he said. "I was very careful when I bought it. The location is closely guarded. The only people can get here are those that I've invited myself. So, how did he end up just outside the wards?"
"I've been temporarily suspended from work," Harry managed to say through a clenched jaw. "We made an arrest and-" Harry swallowed hard, closing his eyes. "The man was poisoning his step-daughter. A little girl." Harry stopped again, opening his eyes to meet Draco's gaze. "It was Maddie," Harry whimpered.
Harry’s gaze softened.  “I like you too,” he whispered with a wink.  “This was really the only thing I wanted for Christmas this year.”
In the next moment, Neville and Blaise tumbled through the floo and the other aurors rushed through the door. In a flash, they joined the fray and the dark wizards were quickly subdued.
"It's fine Draco," Hermione insisted. "I'm so happy. I get to be your healer still, right?" she asked with a grin.
Draco covered his face with his hands and groaned.  “This is so embarrassing,” he muttered.  He sighed as he felt Harry gently grasp his wrists.  He allowed Harry to tug his hands down and found himself looking into vibrant green eyes.
"It's definitely a girl though," Luna said, startling a chirp out of Draco with her sudden appearance. He could have sworn that she'd been on the other side of the tent.
"Think we should see Hermione?" Harry asked reluctantly. It seemed responsible to at least ask, though Harry was going to do everything in his power to avoid the hospital.
"Oh Merlin," Harry gasped. He grasped Draco's hips and panted as Draco lifted himself slowly before sinking back down.
It was obvious that Trelawney was lonely and overjoyed to see Draco and Harry. Draco patiently let her prattle on and make outrageous predictions about everything from politics to Draco's love life. She'd eagerly taken Harry's cup to read his tea leaves. She also caught hold of his hand, eyeing his palm critically.
Draco sat down on the couch as well, though he did it with a great deal more poise. "I haven't seen you in a while," Draco hedged, inspecting his nail beds idly. "I ran into Weasley and Granger recently. I was surprised that you weren't with them." He noted a flash of panic in Harry's eyes. "But that said that you are rather busy."
Draco's cheeks were still a little pink when he took Harry's hand gently. "I learned that from you," Draco said quietly. Harry's tears slipped free as he pulled Draco into a hug. "Learning to love the way you do has brought me more happiness than I thought possible," Draco murmured.
Pansy came into the dining room and froze when she realized Ron was there. "I didn't mean to interrupt dinner," she said.
"No problem," Ron responded with a little shrug. "I sort of had a feeling, so I popped out to talk to Kingsley while you lot were chatting. He and Robards are going to cover for me with Grant."
Hermione swallowed hard, motioning for Ron to follow her down the short hallway. She opened one of the doors and led the way inside, her eyes instantly seeking her patients.
Blaise and Pansy levitated Harry carefully away from the stairs before lowering him to the floor. Neville was pulling potions out of a pouch and setting them next to Hermione. Hermione immediately set to work.
"As if that matters," Draco replied with a short humorless laugh, keeping his back to Harry. "And it's my fault for becoming an Auror and allowing myself to be partnered with you."
At that moment, a medi-witch walked in. She was carrying a baby that looked to be six months old. Spotting Draco, she walked right over to him. "Would you hold little Daniel?" she asked. "I need to go get the other baby."
Draco groaned. "Don't remind me," he muttered darkly. "What possessed them to make such a ridiculous bet?"
Harry and Draco were released from the hospital the next morning as planned. Hermione would be monitoring them with house calls, just as a precaution. Harry was just glad to be out of the hospital and able to gain better control of his wings.
"Nobody thinks that you're a child," Harry retorted. "Have you ever considered that I might need this too?"
Harry shuddered at the tight heat, loving all the desperate sounds Draco made. Harry had remained kneeling on his knees, one hand grasping Draco's hip while the other brushed gently over Draco's stomach. He rolled his hips slowly and carefully, panting softly while Draco moaned shamelessly. Harry's hand drifted to Draco's cock, stroking it languidly as his hips rolled into Draco. Draco pushed back into Harry's thrusts helpfully, his mouth trembling open on a shuddering sigh.
"I- Thank you," Draco said softly. He marvelled at Ron's knowing gaze as the red-head smiled slightly.
"It was harmless," Draco responded with a shrug. "She was so happy to have company. Was it really so much trouble to humor her?" He chuckled when Harry sighed in resignation. "McGonagall told me that Trelawney started drinking less when I began visiting her."
"I'll let you hold him after he's eaten," Draco said, watching James suckle the bottle hungrily. "I know you're dying for a cuddle."
"Must be an instinct thing," Draco said with a frown. "Do you think we'll have a lot of that to deal with? Instincts, I mean. My father is already likely to disown me without adding more weirdness to it all."
"Don't call him that," Harry said sharply. He rolled his eyes when Kreacher simply turned his back and proceeded to ignore Ron's presence entirely. "Please take Malfoy and myself to my home." He shot Room an apologetic look. "We'll stay put."
"Oh Merlin," Harry shuddered. "That was... ridiculous. And you were no help at all," he added with a scowl.
Ron and Ginny arrived next, followed by Neville, Luna and Blaise. There was a lot of fuss over the wings before Harry could convince everyone to sit at the table.
"I think fatherhood would look quite decent on you as well," Draco noted with a little smirk. "When are you planning to contribute to the wizarding population?"
Draco wriggled out of Harry’s grasp, breathless with laughter.  “You great buffoon,” Draco chuckled fondly.  He shook his head.  “It’s a good thing that I like you so much.”
Draco slowly relaxed in Harry's arms but not before catching the attention of the bride and groom. "What's wrong? What happened?" Hermione asked anxiously. She was still in her wedding gown with her hair pinned up elegantly. She looked like a princess and Draco felt awful for causing a scene at her wedding.
It took several minutes for the aurors to get into position. Ron lifted his wand and began casting as he moved forward on silent feet. He removed the disillusionment charm as soon as one of the dark wizards looked up in alarm. Suddenly, the aurors appeared, blocking off escape.
After a while there crowd dispersed, and the family was able to enter the joke shop. Inside, they were greeted by the Weasleys, Draco's parents,several of their friends and a few ex-professors. "The Potter-Malfoys," George called out, lifted his glass in a toast.
"Alright," Draco said cautiously. He sat up and gently scooped the egg up to cradle it to his chest. Harry sat up as well, guiding Draco to lean again him.
"I'm fine," Draco replied, glancing over his shoulder to make sure they were still alone. "It's just... too much. You know? Too many people, too much noise, too many hands touching my wings." He huffed in frustration. "You know I've never really objected to being the center of attention, but it was so hard to stay in my seat during dinner. The impulse to escape was rather strong."
Narcissa eyed the woman. "This was intentional," Narcissa said, looking impressed. "You brought those babies in here to prompt my son into action."
Harry set down his wand and approached Draco slowly, his heart beating frantically. He tilted his head back slightly, as Draco was a bit taller than Harry. "You could have just asked," Harry said softly, a smile spreading on his face.
Harry stood silent, absorbing the new information. He wasn't expecting this. They hadn't really discussed having another child yet. Scorpius was only two.
Harry's wings spread out wide catching the air currents, slowing Harry's decent. They flapped in foreceful but controlled movements. And then Harry was flying. It was exactly graceful, but it was definitely flight. Once he'd gotten some practice, Draco was sure that Harry would be breathtaking in the air.
After a few minutes, they released their hold and went back downstairs. Narcissa made a sound of sympathy when she saw that both young men looked tired and suspiciously glassy eyed. "Are you alright?" she asked, glancing between them.
Draco realized where he was before opening his eyes. He was warm and safe in Harry's bed. His eyes fluttered open to see an oddly concerned expression.
He'd figured out how to spread them out wide and pull them back in to rest closer to his back. He'd been able to flap them enough to lift up off the ground a little, though the effort had been exhausting.
Harry agreed, his cheeks growing pink at Ron's suggestion. Draco laughed at him all the way up the stairs.
This was a common complaint from Draco. Harry just rolled his eyes and summoned the quilt that Draco had come to favor. Harry dutifully draped the quilt over Draco's body. "Completely spoilt," Harry murmured, though he sounded amused instead of annoyed.
Harry closed his eyes. He loved seeing Draco like this. He reached down and rested his hand against Draco's abdomen, stroking his thumb over the slight swell. Draco made a sound like a choked sob and kissed Harry hard. Harry's other hand moved to guide Draco's movements.
Ron lost it and erupted into a fit of childish giggles. Harry hid his face in hands. Lucius looked confused and horrified.
Harry frowned and called for Kreacher. With a brief command, the house elf transported then back to the house. Draco groaned, placing one hand on his churning stomach. Harry darted out of the room and returned a moment later with a potion. Draco drank it without question, pressing his lips together tightly.
"We have need of information," Harry said. "It's for an important case. There is a traitor in our midst and we can't get close enough to discover the identities or motives of his... associates. You can," he added, giving her a knowing look.
Harry was relieved. But he also felt... He wasn't sure he could think of a name for it. Harry shifted in his seat, biting down on his lip. Draco's smile was having a strange effect on Harry's heart rate.
Draco laughed, though there were tears on his face. In the next instant, they were hugging tightly drawing comfort from one another.
"Being rather picky for a bloke that can't be bothered to buy his own sweets," Ron commented, glancing at the overflowing basket in Pansy's hands.
She winked at him as their other friends came into the room with their snacks and drinks. Draco was thoughtful as the movie began to play. He was stretched out next to Harry on their giant cushion. As the love story unfolded of the telly, Draco's gaze drifted to Harry.
Harry announced that dinner was ready just as the awkward silence was becoming unbearable. Harry made a low chirping sound that Draco returned, drawing an alarmed stare from Lucius. He glanced at Narcissa to see that she wasn't at all concerned that their son had just twittered like a common bird.
"You don't have to," Hermione said quietly. "I think you need to talk, but we won't force it. I just hate that you're alone so much. Malfoy really wanted to visit you and he's different now."
Harry took his time removing Draco's clothes. Draco was far less patient. He swiftly removed Harry's trousers and yanked the shirt off before kissing down Harry's chest.
Harry closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath. "You know I want to," Harry said, tone full of regret. "But you're a bit drunk and you're upset with your father. I want us to make that step sober and clear headed." He smiled when Draco pouted. "But I can still make this good for you. If you want?" he added hopefully.
To his surprise, Ron nodded. "You have a quill and something to write on?" After a hasty search, Ron was presented with a scrap of parchment and quill. He scribbled out the address and passed it to Draco. "Try not to upset him." Hermione was staring at Ron in surprise, but she didn't argue.
"I think... Maybe just us tomorrow," Draco said. "I'm having a difficult time with the concept of setting the egg down. The thought of having the house full of people is... unpleasant. Perhaps we can wait until the next movie night?"
"You are a man," Hermione nodded. "But the potion that changed you, evidently made your bird half female."
"Well enough," Harry responded with a slight smile. "I'm certainly glad to be away from the public eye while we adjust."
"Yes, that was the day the men at fault were arrested," Draco said. "But not before they attacked our home. Harry and I were keeping them away from the egg and Harry was nearly killed."
"I think it's lovely that you have that sort of friendship," Luna said. "We'll wait for you to finish." She promptly turned to Pansy and started a strange debate on the legality of hunting Crumple-horned Snorkaks. Pansy looked utterly bewildered, but she launched into the debate.
Harry dropped onto the couch gracelessly. He'd suddenly lost the energy to question the Malfoy heir's motives. Perhaps the git would make it around to the point on his own.
Harry watched Draco, admiring the sound of his laugh and how lovely his smile was. Draco was beautiful, with or without wings, and Harry suddenly felt ridiculously, stupidly lucky. He pulled Draco closer, their naked bodies pressing together.
"You two will be great parents," Ron commented, setting two eggrolls on Draco's plate before loading his own plate with good.
The spark of amusement that flashed briefly in Harry's eyes made Draco's smile widen slightly. Harry rose from his seat but jumped a little when Kreacher popped into the room carrying a tray. Harry sighed and sat back down while the house elf poured the tea and handed them each a plate holding two scones. Harry started to politely decline the food but he relented when Kreacher glared. Kreacher didn't look satisfied until Harry took a bite of the scone.
Draco and Harry were suddenly being ushered toward Kingsley by Ron and Hermione. They were greeted by thunderous applause. "Harry, our hero, has always been generous to us," Kingsley said fondly. "But Draco Malfoy made a lifestyle out of giving and helping his fellow wizards. His donations help with research. He showed compassion to the sick and downtrodden without any recognition. Then Harry joined in, and the secret got out," Kingsley said, smiling apologetically to a blushing Draco.
"Spring is generally the start of mating season," Hermione said helpfully. "The timing was perfect for them to conceive. They just weren't consciously aware of that. Draco's altered anatomy allowed him to get pregnant."
Draco sighed, reluctantly shifting his hand closer to Harry. Harry nuzzled against the fabric sleepily. Draco's lips twitched upward. Hermione noticed but didn't comment.
Ron carefully placed Harry back on the floor, settling himself on the carpet as well. Draco smiled and promptly began to babble at Harry. Ron didn't understand any of it and thought that maybe it was mostly sounds of excitement. Harry seemed bewildered and slowly pulled his thumb out of his mouth. Tears spilled over his cheeks and he sniffled pitifully.
"Well... I'd need her consent obviously," he stammered, flustered. He shot Harry a dirty look for laughing.
Their other friends had been suitably shocked by the news. But they'd quickly offered their congratulations. Ginny and Pansy were excited about the prospect of buying baby clothes.
"You've also developed a..." Hermione trailed off uncomfortably. "It's a cloaca. It's an opening for a bird's digestive and reproductive tracts. They're fairly well concealed. Almost like a second navel."
Movie nights had become much easier to tolerate as the weeks went by. Harry was grateful that he could relax and enjoy the company of his friends again. The noise was much less bothersome and conversation was easy again.
It was only a few moments and hadn't been the worst pain that Harry had ever felt. But it was certainly unpleasant. Someone in the potions division had played a prank.
Harry heard a sharp gasp and instantly remembered that he wasn't the only victim of the prank. He lifted his eyes to his partner's desk warily.
Draco was similarly distracted. He looked down at the body he was occupying, his eyebrows raised. Harry was fit. He wasn't overly bulky but he had a pleasing layer of firm muscle. There was the barest dusting of hair on his chest. "Not bad Potter," Draco commented, running his hands across a taut abdomen.
Ron smiled. Grant was really a good bloke. It made Ron feel even worse. "Sure," he agreed cheerfully. "I'm sure Harry at least will appreciate it. Malfoy is driving him batty." Even more lies. For a moment, Ron wanted to kick himself.
"Oh my..." Draco said faintly, staring at the rings. His gaze lifted to Harry's face, his gray eyes swimming with tears. "Of course," he whispered. "I'll marry you Harry."
"No," Ron said firmly, cutting Harry off. "I'm going to make a team to handle this. You two are going to stay home and take care of my godchild. If one of you lost the other, you'd never fully recover. I'll be fine."
Harry blushed. "Draco's far more impressive," he responded softly. "I can't believe all the work he's been doing to make Christmas better for so many people."
It was exhausting. But Draco steadied his breathing and pushed himself to flap his wings harder. He laughed breathlessly when he was able to rise. He squeezed Harry's hands excitedly. "We did it!" Draco cried, impulsively throwing his arms around Harry for a hug while keeping his wings going. Harry returned the embrace exuberantly.
Before Draco could question further, Ron and Hermione came through the floo. Their smiles fell when the saw Harry's face. "What's wrong Harry?" Hermione asked.
Draco's wings fluttered slightly at the praise. "Thank you. I like the color of yours. They suit you," he added lightly. He smothered a yawn with his hand.
Draco was surprised, but rather pleased. He certainly hadn't expected Harry to be a virgin, but it made sense. Maybe Draco would be his first and only lover.
Draco glanced at Harry's thoughtful expression as the walked through Diagon Alley. It was early December and snow was falling softly around them. They'd decided to do some shopping for Christmas and enjoy some hot chocolate at Fortescue's.
Draco tasted the cake, moaning quietly at the rich flavor. "You need to try this," he informed Harry.
"You're staying here with our baby," Harry said sternly. His look softened a bit and he caressed Draco's face. "I'll be fine. I won't go outside the wards. I just need to be able to see who's trying to get through. I'll take Ron with me. We'll be right outside." He gingerly lifted the egg out of Ron's arms and gave it to Draco, his heart aching at the anxiety in Draco's eyes.
The next Christmas was quite different from the last. Harry and Draco wore matching bonding rings and each were carrying one of the twins as they strolled through Diagon Alley on Christmas Eve. Maddie was walking between them and looking around at the festively decorated shop windows. The family had been lured out of their warm home with a promise of a special Christmas show at the Weasley joke shop.
"Yeah, Hermione's a genius," Ron said flatly with a dismissive wave of his hand. Pansy elbowed him in the stomach.
Harry's fame was occasionally to blame for the departure from the usual work day. On one memorable afternoon, some witch had managed to corner Harry in the lifts. She'd flirted aggressively and then pressed something soft into Harry's hand before stepping off on her floor. She gave him a heated look as the door shuddered closed. Harry had yelped when he realized he was holding a pair of knickers.
It wasn’t entirely true.  The treacle tart had been left out intentionally so that Draco could make a show of fetching it, and indicating that it had been for Harry’s benefit.  Pansy had said it was a stupid idea, but Draco was feeling quite pleased with himself.
Draco sat next to her on the bed, still cradling Daniel against his chest as he met Maddie's eyes. "Of course I do," he assured her.
"I don't know," Hermione replied thoughtfully. "It's unclear if the goal was to cause them to completely transform or to create a hybrid."
And then Harry pounced, wrapping his arms around Draco and pressing warm, sensual kisses all over his neck.  The moment Draco relaxed in his hold, Harry seized the opportunity to tickle him.  Draco’s laughter filled the room and drew smiles out of all of his friends.
"Of course," Harry replied. "That was brilliant." He kissed Draco lightly, snuggling into Draco's chest. After a moment of comfortable silence, Harry pulled back to look at Draco. "We're getting married," he said with a grin.
Harry look of dismay melted into a besotted smile. "Of course," he agreed quietly. "You deserve the best, so that's what you'll get."
"That might not be necessary," Draco said thoughtfully. He looked at Harry. "How would you feel about Christmas here? In shifts, of course. We wouldn't want to bring everyone over here at once."
It was odd to have such sensations from appendages that hadn't existed mere hours earlier. Strangeness aside, Harry's stroking felt wonderful. It was similar to having someone gently run their fingers through your hair.
Narcissa pursed her lips, considering all the new information. Draco's wings twitched and fluttered as he waited for her response.
"Another threat to expose my animagus status?" Rita snapped. "And I thought you might be above all that."
Harry grinned, shifting to kiss Draco deeply. Once he broke the kiss he finished undressing them and followed Draco into the nest.
At home, the boys were each placed in their own nest and covered up. Loving kisses were pressed to their foreheads and they fell asleep quickly.
Draco nodded slowly, cooing when Harry nuzzled him sweetly. Feeling a little calmer, Draco rested one hand on the egg and picked his fork up with the other.
"That would be nice," Draco agreed. "Harry's in the kitchen. He'll want to hear this." He gestured for Ron to follow as he went into the kitchen.
Blaise rolled his eyes, setting his tea aside. " I'm fairly certain that he'd let you claim at least partial credit for most of it," he informed Harry with a smirk. He winked when Draco glared at him.
"Thank you," Draco said, hugging Luna briefly. Questioning it was pointless. And Draco was honestly delighted. He turned to Harry with a smile. "We're having a girl!" he cried out joyfully, laughing when Harry let out an excited trill.
Oh. Harry sighed, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist. "I'm sorry," Harry murmured. "I was just trying to make you happy."
They made it to the new restaurant without a word and Harry and Draco were ushered inside. Luna and Pansy were sitting at a large round table, sipping wine. Aside from the staff, the rest the of the establishment was empty.
"A few things," Hermione admitted. "You'll find that you can produce a few new sounds as their are changes to the vocal chords. I'm relieved that you're both still capable of normal speech."
Harry did as Ron suggested, flinching only slightly when the ancient, and slightly mad, house elf appeared. "Master Potter, young Master Malfoy," the old elf croaked. He shot Ron a suspicious look. "Blood traitor."
Before Ron could scoop Harry up again, Draco wiggled his way closer to Harry and patted Harry's leg. "'Kay," Draco said softly. He reached up to pet Harry's hair earning a watery smile from Harry. "Habby!" Draco cheered, clapping his hands.
Harry set Draco down and began removing the blond's clothing. "I'm going to shag you until you beg me to stop," he declared, lowering his head to suck a mark onto Draco's fair skin.
Pansy nodded sympathetically. "On a positive note, they're stunning," she said. "You look absolutely gorgeous." She turned to Harry and smiled. "Harry," she said finally. "You look amazing as well. Such lovely coloring."
"Spread out," Ron said quietly. "We can't let them escape." He was hunched behind a large clump of bushes with a team of six trustworthy aurors and Kingsley. In the nearby clearing, another ritual was taking place. "It's not all of them, but we can capture these nutters and bring their numbers down.
Draco boiled some water with a spell and added it the teapot before grabbing an infuser to put the tea leaves in. He opened the tin and sniffed at the contents. He frowned and took another sniff, inhaling more deeply. He slapped the lid back on and slammed the tin onto the counter with a look of horror.
Pansy arrived next, coming to an abrupt halt when she saw Harry and Draco. "You poor dears!" she cried, launching herself at Draco for a hug while carefully avoiding his wings. "I heard that your transformation was ghastly. Are you terribly uncomfortable?" She pulled back to look Draco over.
"H-Harry?" Neville sits up, blinking groggily and rubbing his eyes. When Longbottom is awake enough to register what he's seeing, the forms of the other boys are separated by about five feet. "Were you two-"
"Oh, you seem to know what you're in for, do you? Yes..." She trails off, eyes glinting maliciously at me. "Yes, that's me. I am, in fact, the Dark Wizard Adelphi. And you, good sir, are my newest victim." Opening the switchblade and grazing my cheek with it, Adelphi speaks again, hardly a whisper, "You look so pretty, bound and gagged and at my mercy... First, I'm gonna try out some new spells I've been working on." She leans to lick at the blood on my cheek with her split tongue, reminding me of a snake.
"What do you want?" Harry says, lifting his eyes from an article about cauldron thickness to fix his eyes on the lean blond boy beside him. Nobody should be allowed to be that attractive, and, coming from a straight guy, that says a lot.
I'm surprised to see how unbothered - gleeful, even - he is at dinner. Did he want to go back home? Maybe I'll get some answers from from, Vince and Greg flanking me to the other side of the vast Great Hall.
The Weasel had gotten bit by the hatchling, and I discovered how they were planning to smuggle it out. I tried to catch them in the act, but I got caught myself, punished with detention. Fortunately, they got detention that night as well. Now, I have to sit and wait for Filch to bring us to our punishment: patroling the Forbidden Forest at night.
"He doesn't seem like a pleasant person to me, and when you cursed me after the holidays I heard you talking about him. Does he hurt you?" His stupidly round face is alight with genuine concern.
"Arms... Can't move... Fell off, I'm think..." My voice sounds far off, as though I were speaking through water.
When he takes me in his mouth I nearly lose it. I would've come straight down his throat, overwhelmed with pleasure, had he not thought far enough ahead to conjure a cock ring. He sucks me down to the base, my prick twitching as it hits his tonsils. After stretching me endlessly, edging and overwhelming me, he finally pulls back.
Draco feels many pairs of eyes boring into him and looks up from his book, taming his features into his signature bored face, only to meet the eyes of the Saviour himself.
"Ok, well," I breathe in, trying to decide how to explain. "We were patrolling the forest, and Longbottom asked about Father. I got pissed and transformed. Hagrid put me with Potter instead and next I can remember I'm having nightmares about dead unicorns getting their blood drunk and burning people alive. Is that good enough for you?" I say, exasperated. She frowns, but leaves the dorm reluctantly without another word to me.
Then he's staring into silver eyes that mirror the pure want Harry feels in that moment. Malfoys eyes are slightly glazed over, and on closer inspection it seems that one eye is icier. His left eye is a pale blue, the other being the silver Harry had come to associate with his former rival.
He pulls off his shirt first, revealing a scarred expanse of tanned skin, stretched taught over defined, bulging muscles. Hands frantically undoing his flies, he catches my gaze. His eyes seem to glow eerily with immense heat. It scares me to no end.
"Give it here!" Potter yells, but instincts kick in and I kick off from the ground. The air is amazing, even if I can't spread my wings, and in my enjoyment I fly to the topmost branches of a large oak.
Obsessed is the only way I can describe how I feel for Potter. What started out as me wishing to befriend him (I knew Father would want me to have nice contacts) quickly spiralled into more - a simple crush to full blown fancying.
"Oh, I like this cat very much! Klaus? An amazing name indeed, Master Draco!" Klaus seems to have temporarily distracted him, weaving his long body between the elf's legs.
"Hey! Klaus is NOT dumb, Bee and I got it for Dray," Pansy interrupts, snuggling Ophelia to her chest.
They sit in comfortable silence, calming their breathing and allowing the hot jets of water to cleanse them of their sins.
The Golden Boy leans over, allowing his fangs to sink into the tender flesh where neck meets shoulder and sucking up Dracos delicious blood, closing his eyes and savoring the cool, citrusy flavor. He pounds into Draco, listening to him sing an enticing song of pleasure while feasting on the blonds essence. They both come in a blur of color and pleasure, and it takes a moment, sitting in the hot tub together, before Harry notices that something is wrong. Dracos blood is blue.
"Give it here, or I'll knock you off that broom!" His eyes are full of fury, directed at me. I'm a little scared now, the Veela in me screaming that I have angered the best potential mate I have.
"You're a lot braver now you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," Harry grinds out in a sinister way. He's wrong though, they're not friends - they're hindrances.
"No. Yes. Water based lube wouldn't work in the water, it'd get washed up. Silicone lube kills condoms but would be good in this particular situation." He pauses for an answer, but it doesn't come. "Just... Hand over the bottle."
"Come here often?" The blonde woman to my left speaks up, stuffing some money in our tabletop dancers cleavage.
"Looks like you don't need to try out," Blaise says, sidling up to me. "But I don't think there would've been much competition between you and the others, you were always the best back at the Manor."
"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley. I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those." I'm hit with a pang of guilt when I realize it's probably true. Mr. Weasley walks over to his kids and Harry, towing along the twins with him.
The dead weight of her limp body lifts suddenly, reminding me of Potter's presence. He Heals my leg. Wandlessly, wordlessly. The air hangs heavy between us, the only sound besides our breathing being the forlorn chirp of crickets - they must have stopped during the encounter with Adelphi... Her voice rings through my head: Draco, Draco, Draco...
"Why'd she do this? Why am I doing this?" Potter plants his warm hands on my shoulders and begins to push away, apparently worried, suddenly, about the morality of our situation.
"You don't know?" Harry shakes his head, still worried. "You went after my prostate immediately, it was intense. Just... Just don't do it that fast next time." He pulls his finger out and grabs Harry's black curls. "Please continue, both fingers this time... And try sucking on my, er, taint. It'll help loosen me for your - oh Merlin yes!"
The way he scissors me open would have been downright painful if not for how he frequently caressed my prostate. He went in almost dry with his fingers, stretching me with scary urgency. I feel like I'm floating. His hand on my neck reduces blood flow to my brain as he reduces me to a downright, shivering, moaning mess.
In the common room a few days later, Pansy, Blaise and I are sat on the couch, watching the fire. Ophelia and Klaus lay before it contentedly. It's an odd sort of peacefulness. Pansy absently braids my hair, and Blaise is sewing something for Theo.
"Give it here, Malfoy," Potter growls at me, and I feel the indistinct urge to show off for him. Am I displaying for him?! I smile and continue my show.
"Save me more," I moan tiredly, smacking his face lightly with an outstretched hand and a slight smile, completely unawares he'd take me seriously.
The sight Narcissa is met with when she turns is nearly too much for her to process. Her son, fists aflame as he glares at a burning cherry tree. Maximus, Lucius' favorite peacock, dead in the dirt, singed feathers and neck at a gruesome angle. Blazing blossoms floating in the air, catching on the wind and flying away. Draco, his face with a snout quite similar to a dragon, his ears elongated and pointy, his arms covered in baby blue scales and tipped with talons. The sight of the wings sprouting from his shoulders - silvery blue, veined with gold, batty membranes, dragonesque. Maybe naming him Draco didn't help her luck. Oops.
"Malfoy," calls Flint, Slytherin captain. "Write your father and tell him thanks for the brooms. You're part of the team now."
"Ok, I believe you," I drawl. "Shall we visit the elves, then, Pans?" She nods and we walk on, Cedric going through the pear portrait right behind us. I turn to him again with narrowed eyes. "Why are you still here?" Pansy holds up a hand to stifle her laugh.
Snape finishes his slow stroking of my scalp, and stares at me through his greasy locks while gathering up my white ones off the stone floor. A thought strikes me just then and I wonder if he's part hag.
"What the hell does that mean?" Draco asks angrily. "Are-Are you calling me a lesbian?" Harry chuckles and it only winds up the blond even further.
Inside, a king sized bed with silky black sheets in the back; a grey couch sat in front of a great, roaring hearth to the left; a jacuzzi on the right; a large counter running along most of the walls at a perfect height to bend someone over. The entire back wall is covered in shelves which display an impressive array of lubes, condoms, dildos, ropes, massage bars, and first aid items.
"Another similarity between you and I, Draco, is that Potter is our grand prize." Shoulders popping out of their sockets. "Ha! You love the pain." Tears dripping to the musty cement. "You'd like this a lot more if it were him, though, wouldn't you." Trousers tightening. "I have to agree with you on that-"
"What is it, Longbottom?" I try to sound exasperated at him, but he doesn't seem to take notice of it.
"Potter, I'm gonna fucking kill you." They'd been in the RoR for an hour or so, and Draco was getting frustrated with this stupid patronus business.
"Don't. Scratch me as much as you can. Choke me. Merlin, just fucking hurt me, please." I'm practically begging her already, but she grins sadistically before gripping my hair and pulling me down to her eye level.
"I'm gonna ruin your hair if you don't tell me how you feel," she states. "You've hardly said a word since the start of term."
"Bella?" Andy asks, voice quivering. She and Cissa peer around the couch to see their beloved older sister. Much to their horror, Bellatrix is on fire. She's sprouted gold wings, black talons, a dragon muzzle with sharp black fangs. She's not their sister anymore. She can't be.
"Well, maybe I am," he all but growls. "You look pretty nice in that button up, too bad it's gone now." Potter starts panting heavily, clearly uncomfortable but not making a move to stop it.
"Draco, what the fuck happened last night?" Pansy jumps on my bed and I'm shocked to see her partway transformed and mostly naked.
"Well, also when I top, I suppose... Pansy's a biter." Harry just gapes at him, mouth open. "What, Potter? We're Slytherins, we don't back out of dares and we certainly do not feel shame." Malfoy stares up at the Saviour of the Wizarding world with a bored look before studying the nails of his right hand.
"Holy shit, Malfoy. Keep an eye on 'em, eh?" Diggory calls from across the room. Hei snickers in his lap.
When he looks up into Harry's gaze, his hunger is reflected in those emerald eyes. Draco drags Harry into the hot, frothy water and kisses him full on the mouth while Potter squeezes his arse.
Setting aside the spade and breathing in fresh air, that's when she hears it - a peacock in pain and the crackle of a fire. Fuck.
"Good morning." Pansy pokes my nose while she stretches. "Think we ought to see the elves before you go to tryouts?" She asks me quietly, smiling. I poke her little button of a nose before answering.
"Mind if I," he begins, waggling his eyebrows, "slither in?" I choke out a breathy laugh as he squeezes harder, ramming two thick fingers inside me.
There's a new Dark wizard on the rise, leaving behind her a trail of limbs in dumpsters behind nightclubs, cut a la Muggle from those she's tortured; with new and improved methods, of course. Thus far, Potter and Weasley are the only people to have escaped her clutches and lived to tell the tale.
"On your knees." I whimper. "Now," she growls, acrylics pushing against my jugular. When I'm on the ground, she positions my arms uncomfortably behind my back, murmuring a quick Incarcerous to hold my limbs at angles that, should I move, would surely cause breakage. The toe of her combat boot clad foot brushes against my groin for a moment before she kicks my stomach. I moan loudly, now perched on the ground in the most wantonly sit, toes pointed out on either side while my thighs are flattened against the musty concrete.
cedric about to make an appearance, and yes i love him. hufflepuffs are great. we love you. also, i renamed cho chang since its a racist name and to spite jk. her name is now Hei Chang, and she will at least be mentioned in this chapter. also the beginning is a memoir warm-up from writing class! YEET
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?" I'm getting frantic now. "They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, Imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families." Like Father says. "What's your surname anyway?"
"Look!" I yell out while running to it excitedly before squashing the emotion out of me. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
"Famous Harry Potter, can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page." I say, ripping a page out of the book Father handed me and pocketing it.
"You liked that, didn't you? You're fucking disgusting." I can't find any way to respond, any words that can get me out of this scrutiny. I feel incredibly vulnerable, but the worst part is that I might actually like this? "I can see you eye fucking me all the time. Is it true the other Unspeakables hide from you when I drop off artifacts? It must be - I can see it in your eyes. Maybe we aren't so different, Malfoy. After all, I've been wanting this for a long time. Wanting you, that is. And now I shall have you." He flicks his hand and our clothes are Vanished, the raw power he emits radiating under his skin and dancing along my spine tantalizingly.
"No, Pans, those are Veela tattoos. Mom gave them to me today. Do you wanna go out and play with the cocks?" I ask hopefully, grabbing her wrist and running when she nods. "The chicks are just starting to get their adult plumage, look," I say, pointing at a very leggy female - she's grey-brown with bright blue shoulders and a scalloped pea green neck, and the skin around her eyes is yellow. "That's a java green. Out of all the varieties, those ones have the prettiest females." I smirk at her.
It was sawed off crudely, removed from a Muggle stripper aged 19 years old. At least I've lived longer than her. When it was given to my department for study, the tattoos had been burned off, skin cauterized where inky black images of butterflies should have been. The wrist bones had been hit with a curse that turned the bones into fine powder, causing me to nearly drop it when it was placed in my arms, feeling more like a dead, scaly fish rather than a human limb.
"I wish I could forget about it that easily," she replies, frowning now. "What with all the violent practices held at the Manor and such, breaking my arm..." She trails off, not wanting to speak aloud of Gizzy. I know how hard that was for Pansy, and I'm not at all surprised she can't let go.
"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage - lives in a hut on school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed."
It lands firmly in her chest, a terrific crunch echoing in the stillness. She giggles breathlessly, eyes glinting when she meets my gaze again. Adelphi drops to her knees before crawling closer to me, grabbing my collar in both hands. Her blood gushes over both of us like some gruesome hot spring.
I thought this might have gotten better as I became an adult, but no; as is with my life and luck, that would never work.
After breakfast, she leads me out to the grounds with her, handing me a bucket of seed so I can join her in feeding the peacocks. Thinking back on it, they're probably my favorite part of life at the Manor. Mother and I used to come sit on the bench in the garden, the birds milling about curiously. I'd sit in her lap and she'd tell me stories, sometimes reading them to me, but other times making them up as she went. She'd taught me how to dance among the ivory roses and blush colored peonies, the fragrance soaking into our shining hair beneath the stars. It was here that I'd learnt of the stars, the constellations, the galaxies - I became so attached to the night sky it always felt like a close friend. My favorite was Sirius, the dog star, and when I told Mum this she had chuckled solemnly to herself, shaking her head eloquently. Apparently Sirius was the name of my Mother's cousin, brother to Regulus. She had told me teary eyed stories about the boys and their days at Hogwarts, lamenting about how much she had missed the two of them.
"Have you..." He trails off, unsure what to say. "Have you ever heard of a safeword?" Harry shakes his head. "Ok, well, basically... If you're having sex or are in a relationship with someone, you usually want a word that you can use if your limits are pushed. Like, if Blaise, Pansy and I are talking about something that bothers Theo, he'll yell 'asparagus,' and we drop the subject. Make sense?"
"Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!" I say somewhat jealously. Maybe I want him to be my boyfriend. Her face went as red as her hair in embarrassment.
"Hello," I say with my best attempt for my voice to remain calm. "Hogwarts too?" He replies with a simple yes. Perfect. "My father's next door buying my books and Mother's up the street looking at wands," I say coolly. See? I'm independent. Please love me. "Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully Father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow." I won't, he'd beat me. Please don't see through me. "Have you got your own broom?" I try to sound disinterested(I'm very interested) in what his answer will be.
So here I am, in my godfathers dingy dungeon office, immobilized in an extremely cold iron chair. The jar of fairy wings was the only thing I managed to focus on out of all the creepy ingredients in the room. They're each about the size of my thumb, and an iridescent blue/pink that glows slightly in the firelight.
"Like what you see?" Harry smirks again, flashing his fangs menacingly. Draco nods, watching eagerly when Potter wandlessly summons a bottle of lubricant off the back wall. It seems as though the Saviour is absolutely teeming with magical power and Draco whimpers at the thought of what they're about to do.
"How could you... Potter?" Dracos voice rises in pitch, breath catching in fear when he sees tiny little fangs when Potter pulls back with a grin.
"Oh yeah.... That's why I'm hiding in the dungeons." Draco looks up in horror, unable to run away thanks to the hand in his hair. "I uh, I ran into some vampires when I was hiding from, you know, Voldemort? And Neville-" he gestures to the sunken form of Longbottom on the floor "-let's me feed off him. I need to find a new Feeder though, before I hurt him by taking too much."
"No!" Bella shrieks, turning to face them. The fire retreats down her arms, sitting content in her palms. Her face contorted in horror, she's a monster. She must be. "Don't look at me!" She cries, bloody tears streaking down her face. Her eyes go blank, and she drops to her knees. A dizzy smile appears on her face as she transforms back. Behind her, Cygnus Black stands with his wand pointed at Bella's neck. He must be protecting Cissa and Andy, he must be.
The blond wastes no time in leaning forward to meet Harry's brown lips with his own pinkish ones. They had locked themselves in the boys eighth year bathroom after deciding to lengthen their kiss from the night previous. The other boys in their year were either still asleep or eating breakfast and getting studying in, but it was mainly muggleborns and students who missed their seventh year down for breakfast, as it was decently early on a Saturday.
"You know, it's not smart to be a slut," she murmurs, using her thumb to wipe tears from my eyes. "It can be quite dangerous, you see." She reaches into the back pockets of her jeans, producing a switchblade in one hand and her wand in the other. My eyes widen in fear, thoughts crashing like waves when I remember what Potter said in the interdepartmental meeting earlier.
Malfoy sits cross legged in front of Harry, scowling. Another surge of nervousness shoots through his spine.
Blaise looks like he's about to explode with pure glee. "Sherman," he says, pointing at the black one. "Hubert," he names the grey one. "And Rufus," is the brown and white one. "They're so perfect. Thanks, Dragon."
"Adelphi likes playing with her victims... She's sadistic, and likely gains some sort of grotesque satisfaction in what she does... Most of the dismembered corpses have been found behind bars and stripclubs... We think she takes advantage of sex workers and promiscuous people... Muggles and wizards alike are in danger..."
He hesitates, smirking at the blond before him and catching Malfoys gaze effortlessly. With one tug, his pants and trousers fall to the floor to reveal his bobbing erection. He toes off his shoes and socks, stepping away from the puddle of his clothes to edge nearer to an open mouthed Draco.
"Do you get off on the fact that you just had a near death experience?" He cocks an eyebrow, hands slowing to a snail's pace. "Or maybe you should think about your pregnant wife who has no idea whether you're alive or dead right now. You go to bars often?" I nod. He chuckles. "Does she get off on knowing you're fucking other people?" His massive cock is finally released, and Potter pounces on me.
The pressure releases with a pop. I guess he was Apparating, not trying to kill me. Not like I care much either way. He could decapitate me and I'd thank him.
Grandma Black was my favorite relative, quite possibly because she was the only one who was genuinely proud of me. All my life I've been told how I'm a disappointment to the Malfoy name, to my Father, to the wizarding world overall. But Gran Black was a proud Veela, and in the end it's what got her killed. I never got to finish the puzzle we had been working on together. For some reason, the puzzle she had given me is my most prized possession. The pieces are under my bed in the dorm, left in the same condition it was when Father yelled Avada Kedavra at my Gran.
They weren't close, exactly, and they never miss a chance to poke fun at each other, but their jokes and jibes and insults hold none of the venom they had held in the past. It was odd, really. The two boys had hated each other for nearly seven years before they came to the realization that they were two sides of the same coin. Both were used in the war, neither were given much choice, both suffered losses of people they loved, neither were treated well at home. Yet it was far beyond impossible for them to just leave the past in the past and start over - they held too much bitterness from old, immature habits.
It's tail is quite long, round eyes large and the color of fire. Blaise said it was a breed that shed and grew it's fur in a way fairly similarly to how phoenix's grow and die, except the Kneazle fur is great for yarn apparently. I figure I should get Blaise something since Pansy already got a gift from me. They both pitched in to get Klaus, anyway.
"Do you think we could do this again sometime?" Potter blurts out suddenly. "I, er, had a good time."
"No. I hate him." I frown and turn to the window of the common room, lit with the eerie green glow of Moon Algae. Pansy wants to try talking with the Merpeople and the Nixies in order to learn their customs and their unique branch of magic, but Blaise didn't think it'd be a good idea. He's able to talk to the Gargoyles around the school and it quite frankly pisses us off with his stupid opportunities.
After much thanks to Dobby, we compose ourselves so we can eat with our parents downstairs. We walk in right as Mr. Parkinson finishes his sentence with, "and I used the Killing Curse right there, nasty little thing." Pansy inhales sharply. I guess that mystery is solved.
"No, it's just awkward," he says shakily, examining the bottle labeled Salazar's Silicon Slicke. "Give me a reason and I will," he adds as an afterthought. Harry frowns at the blond, who is now coating his long pale fingers, bent over the edge of the tub.
Apparently that was enough for her, because she relents. I jump off the couch, turning to see her frowning at her hands. Blaise pokes her neck, causing her to leap from his lap, as well.
Wide, calloused hands grip my biceps, and it's all the warning I get before both arms are yanked farther from my body. Then, with a grunt from Potter, they're shoved ruthlessly back into place with a loud crack. Everything seems clearer beneath this new pain.
"Where did it even come from?" Pansy thinks aloud, rubbing her hand on the green silk sheets on my four poster. Blaise wiggles his chin and looks up at the ceiling, seeming thoughtful.
"I'd take you anytime on my own," I growl, hoping he'll take the bait. Maybe I can actually talk to him, alone. "Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only - no contact," even if I wanna touch your hair. I notice the flash of fear in his emerald eyes. "What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
When she finally faces me again, she has her wand in hand, and gestures for me to sit on our bench. A young silver spaulding cock jumps to sit next to me, nipping my fingers affectionately to hide the fact he's searching me for seed. With all my years experience with peafowl, I see straight through his ruse.
When I wake in the morning, Klaus has replaced Pansy on my lap. She didn't go to her dorm, apparently, because she's still cuddled up beside me. One of our friends must've carried me up, as I'm in my bed rather than sitting next to the fire in the commons.
"Alrighty, then! This is getting boring! Spin the bottle?" His request was met with a surprising amount of agreement, though many grumbled on about how that was only the first round of Never Have I Ever. He reaches to his right, grabbing a nearly empty butterbeer bottle from Dean, who was currently preoccupied with the drawing of Seamus he held in his lap.
At Christmas time, I went home. Mother had missed me dearly, just like in her letter, and would not leave my side unless I was in the bathroom or going to bed. I was relieved to see a friendly face on the first night, when Dobby brought me a hot water bottle before bed. He listened to my stories, fascinated at the way Harry Potter had fought a troll, became a Seeker, held to his broom when it became mutinous, caught the Snitch in his mouth... You'd think Dobby had a crush on him too. Other than that it was the same, except how Father had a new sort of ferocity about me.
The gameskeeper decides to put me with Pretty Boy Potter instead, and off we go. He spots a unicorn, bright white under the light of the moon. I would have noticed it sooner had I not been in shock over how I almost burnt Longbottom to a crisp.
He moved with ease, speeding down with an aptitude that shocks everyone on the green Quidditch field. Students screamed and I just hovered, in complete shock, as he grabs the glass ball moments before it shatters in the grass. I'm on my feet and I don't know how I got there, but Professor Mcgonagall comes out onto the pitch, striding furiously towards Harry.
Narcissa knew her mother was a Veela. She knew her father was  half Veela. She knew her mother in law was a Veela, and as such her husband was a partbred as well. She also knew that this could never, never be revealed, to anyone. If their secret came out, Merlin knows what would happen, but Narcissa didn't dare follow that train of thought. Plus, she had more important matters to take care of right now. Such as her son.
"Draco, please." The blond pulls himself together and meets Harry's eyes. His green gaze is oddly serious, and Draco shakes his head, the room falling into dead silence.
"I am not scared, Theo. Now shut up before I stomp on your throat." This only elicits a high pitched chuckle from him. "Ok, I'll do it. But just know I hate you, all of you," he says, staring daggers at his fellow Slytherins.
Idiot. You're supposed to be listening to your infatuation discussing torture methods rather than fueling your raging hard on.
"You'll find out soon some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you get there." Perfectly phrased, Mother and Father would be proud. I hold my hand out for him to shake, but for some odd reason he doesn't take it.
Blaise is the one who breaks the silence. "Greengrass, get the fuck out of our compartment before somebody-" he looks at me pointedly "-transforms and burns your face off."
I'm still fiddling with the page. Basilisks. That's what Father bestowed upon our school. But what can I do, if anything? Probably not much.
We spend some time talking to him and the elves, discussing what he should make (we decided on lemon poppy muffins) before we had to leave for the pitch. When Pansy and I arrived for my tryout, the entire team seemed to have been waiting for me. I scrunch my brows when I see that all the brooms - dark wooded, polished and sleek - are identical. The newest model. Seven Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones.
"Draco?" Reality comes back into focus. Potter has dragged me away from the corpse, a trail of our blood winding along the asphalt. "Draco." This time his hoarse voice is stern, commanding. It goes straight to my cock, despite the amount of blood I've lost. I'm dizzy, empty. The only thing that's real is Potter, kneeling in front of me, concern etched into the lines of his face. Oh yeah, he's talking to me...
"One of the main differences between us is that I get my desires filled quite regularly, but you'll never, never have a chance with 'Harry Potter.' Mmm, yes, give me more of your regrets. Tell me just how miserable you are."
"Harry, I..." Deep breaths, Draco. Deep breaths. "I think I might be falling for you? I-I think I love you." Harry's whole face glows with that absolutely adorable, idiotic grin of his.
Firstly, he was extremely shy. He hardly spoke when there were more than two people around him, and tended to speak through somebody else (mostly Blaise or Millicent, but Daphne works too). Secondly, he gets really sad and cries for no reason before storms. He also sings in the shower before storms, but that might not be due to his ancestry. Another odd thing he had inherited is that his skin and hair repels ink, something that Augereys are known for.
"Here," I pant out, grinning giddily. "Open the box." Blaise takes it, tilting his head questioningly. "Careful with the scissors."
I want to see him using Sectumsempra, the same exact spell he had used on me in our 6th year, on a Dark wizard; I want to see him covered in sweat, blood, and tears while he interrogates a prisoner; I want to have him cut neat stripes down my chest and lick away my blood; I want to have him pound into me like I have no say in it; I want Him.
"If you get uncomfortable, name a vegetable," Malfoy breathes into the caramel skin of Harry's neck. Harry chuckles breathlessly.
"Tell me what happened. And I just got out of the shower, Blaise told me in the bathroom," she says as though she and Blaise regularly bathe together or something. "Stop looking at me like that, we're worried about you." Her eyes finally shrink down to normal size and her skin loses some of its murky hue.
"Potter?" Draco whispers into the seemingly empty corridor. He feels eyes on him, but all the paintings and statues that used to occupy the seventh floor got destroyed by fiendfyre and war.
She saunters to his office dizzily, eyes unfocused. The sound of her screaming son don't reach her ears. The belt slicing through the air escape her senses. She can't be bothered beneath the Imperius. This is fine. She'll get punished as well, and all will be fine. Lucius walks in, then the enchantment lifts.
"About half a minute," replies an eager, manly voice. It's Potter, of course. "Care to explain what that was about?" His eyes drift to my groin, my erection still straining to be released.
"Young Master Malfoy, I presume you share the wish of Master Blaise? Dobby can leaves you be if you wants."
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?" Do they treat you right?
"Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't find you attractive, and - what can I say? I like being bitten when I'm bottoming, just ask Blaise."
"It's like you're... I dunno, I feel like you're mentally undressing me or something..." He trails off at the hunger that gleams in Dracos pale eyes. He leans in closer to the Saviour, breathing hotly on his neck.
"Potter, stop!" Harry pulls out, scared that he hurt his boy. His? "I - you didn't do anything wrong, I just - holy fuck, why did you do that? Were you trying to make me come untouched?"
Platform nine and three quarters is crowded, and I'm stood next to Dobby, both of us watching the entrance from King's Cross eagerly. The elf beside me is here under the pretense of pushing my trolley - Mother and Father had left already, having decided that meeting their pureblood colleagues is more important than seeing me off.
Draco looks into Potter's viridian gaze, nearly panting at the sheer heat of their kiss. The raven haired boy is looking back and forth at each of Dracos eyes in the most infuriatingly obnoxious way, making Draco go dizzy. He finally stops fixing the blond with that searching look of his, just to share a moment of heat before nodding. This isn't over yet.
Vincent had a most terrible idea. He alerted Filch, and Potter would be in trouble. All because I wanted to speak to him alone. At least pretty boy hadn't gotten expelled the next day. In fact, he had instead received a new broomstick and the Seeker position for Gryffindors Quidditch team.
Pansy shifts her legs to wrap around my front, tugging my hair to hold me in place. She squeezes her thighs.
Andromeda's fingers lengthen to sharp points. Pearly pink wings sprout from her shoulders. Fire creeps from her hands to her chest. She flings a handful of flame at her father's face. This must be done.
"Gizzy hasn't been seen, PanPan is worried about what her father might have done," I catch him up to speed while Pansy nods, confirming my assessment. When she broke her arm last year and her parents refused to Heal it, Gizzy was the house elf who took care of her. They had become very close, but every time the elf got caught meeting with the girl or bringing her food when she was in trouble, Pansy's parents would punish the pair harshly.
"Thanks, Draco, for sharing your piece," she states, motioning me away. I take a seat next to one of the fires and Pansy jumps in my lap, planting a quick kiss on my cheek. "Now, Higgs? Care to come up for your routine?"
The Slytherins all snap their fingers in applause. It was Millicents idea to hold a talent night where we could all support each other. That's my favorite thing about my House - we're loyal. She organized the event with Theo, Crabbe and Goyle built the stage, Blaise and Daphne sewed the new curtains and stage cover, and Pansy helped me write my piece.
"Then, I'll just barely keep you alive, cutting you until you can't think. Oddly, if you lose enough blood you'll float somewhere between life and oblivion... I hear it's euphoric, but I don't know personally." My mutinous traitor of a cock fills even more.
"Aren't you a Prefect?" Pansy demands. I hadn't noticed the badge before then, but there it is. A big silver P gleaming on his breast pocket.
Harry lifts his head to deepen the kiss, wrapping his hands around the nape of Malfoys neck. It's slow, soft, gentle, and sweet, filling both the boys minds with fuzzy warmth. Malfoy soon grows frantic, tongue darting into Harry's mouth and hands trailing down the Gryffindors front. Harry pulls back fast with a small yelp as his head hits the wall.
Similarly to Vince, Greg can't transform either. He's part giant, and hates Hagrid the most out of us. Why? Mainly because Hagrid is loved and accepted as a partbred, whereas it's a well kept secret among purebloods.
Cygnus decides to torture the both of them. Narcissa watches, frozen in place with terror. She must never let their secret be known, she mustn't.
"Maybe I could, er..." Draco trails off as Harry shakes his head incredulously, a small smile playing on his face. "What? You're the only reason I'm not in Azkaban right now, let me help you."
It was hard for me to wrap my head around. She had cousins who lived in this lake. I can't help but wonder if I had any Veela cousins, and if so, where they might be. My Veela grandmothers were all slaughtered before I could make substantial memories of them.
Of course, Pretty Boy and Red got to school through other means. The first morning back at school was punctuated not only by their return, but the Howler that Weasleys mother sent. I try to save Harry, and this is what I get instead? He put himself in more danger, got seen by Muggles, and to top it off, they get a Howler when I'm partway transformed and my senses are far beyond humanly possible. So not only am I boiling my orange juice with my fire, but I'm deafened for the day. I can't even hear my own screams when my Godfather is using the Cruciatus Curse on me before class as punishment. Who cares, anyway?
"No, I just-" Harry breaks off, laughing. "Vampire fangs have an odd chemical on them? Like venom, almost? And it gives an, er, a happy sort of effect. As in, like, you know? Are you happy to see me, or is your wand in your pocket type deal, yeah?"
Dozens of owls swoop in through the windows of the Great Hall. A pair of large tawnies drop a large package in my lap and wait for me to pay them before leaving. These must be the Nifflers. I run out the hall towards the kitchens where I know Blaise and Pansy currently reside. They had gone in there immediately after class to make a dress form, and couldn't finish in time for dinner. I would have stayed with them, except I knew my package would be arriving today.
