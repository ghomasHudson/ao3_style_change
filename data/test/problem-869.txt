“You don’t really believe him, though, do you, Potter?” Dawkins asked, his smile growing tight and forced. “Come now, Potter, he’s a Malfoy, he’ll say whatever he has to so he can slither his way out of trouble.”
A couple years later, when Harry was sixteen, his friends decided to have a Hallowe’en party at the old manor – “It’s a real-life haunted house, Harry! It’s perfect!” Ron had pointed out when Harry had been reluctant. He made himself smile and went along with it. In the end, he, Hermione, Ron, Ron’s sister Ginny who kept looking at Harry when she thought he wouldn’t notice, and their friends Neville, Luna and Lavender all piled into the drawing room of the dilapidated house.
, into the bottle green jumper. “Your mum knows I’m coming, right?” Harry asked as the thought suddenly popped into his head. Draco, who was modelling for the mirror, didn’t look up.
Draco jumped at the priest so casually using his name, as if they were old friends. “How do I know you won’t just sell my secrets to the
Draco opened his mouth, closed it again. He wanted to say that he had. He’d had plenty of one night stands – the bartender inside could attest to that – but in reality they were drunken fumbles, scratching an itch. There hadn’t been anything real for so long. Not since…
That evening, the owl was still happily attached to Draco’s shoulder, having gone to sleep there shortly after he had finished for the day. When Harry came over, Draco was reading a book in his favourite armchair while the owl dozed, half-leaning against Draco’s head. Harry raised an eyebrow. Draco shrugged his free shoulder.
Harry pressed his lips into a thin line. “Oh,” he said at last. Draco scoffed, crossing his arms over his narrow chest. For a moment, they were quiet, listening to the dying fire. Then – “You know,” Harry said, “I’m sure it has nothing to do with your casting. The thing with the Patronus charm is that, even if your technique is perfect, it won’t work if the feeling isn’t right. Even Hermione has a hard time with it.”
“You know, it’s okay if you can’t produce a Patronus the first few times,” Harry said, his words comforting. Draco scowled.
Parkinson frowned at his friend. “We just wanted to say hello,” he said, looking between Draco and Harry with narrowed eyes. “Did we interrupt something? The f** try to jump you or something?”
“Draco, is that you?” came a voice from inside the house. Harry gently disengaged his hand from Wilkins’ trembling grasp as he heard the click of heels on marble. “Ah, Draco, dear, I was wondering when you would – ”
The first month was rough. The nightmares and panic attacks were getting worse. Draco found himself most nights wandering the corridors, trying not to see an enemy around every darkened corner. He promised himself one term – if he made it through one term, he would stay. If not…
Draco’s laugh was hollow and mirthless as the memory came back to him – he had gone, hoping that two years had been enough, that he could offer the olive branch, make amends, only for his father to ask him, after far too many glasses of wine for lunchtime, if Draco had come to his senses or if he was still ‘taking it up the arse’. That’s when the chandelier broke. He looked away from the pitying look in Hermione’s eyes and swallowed past the lump in his throat. “In any case,” he said, “my parents and I, we, er, don’t speak anymore. So. I imagine they still have house elves, but I don’t, probably never will, now that I’ve worked in food service.”
“Well,” Harry said, voice soft, “I guess it’s alright if we show up to the Wizengamot in just our pants, unshaven, no shoes or anything. Everyone can see how good you look in your briefs.” He traced a teasing finger against the elastic of said briefs, and Draco shivered. “I’m sure that will make a great impression.”
The hand holding Malfoy’s wand shook. His eyes darted from Harry’s open palms to the wand at his feet like a cornered animal, waiting for the gun to be drawn. Myrtle came in between them. She raised her arms as if to shield Malfoy from Harry’s sight.
When Harry didn’t respond immediately, Draco pulled back, an apology already half out of his mouth. But then Harry’s lips were crashing into his. Harry’s hand was on the back of his neck, pulling him in close as he scrambled onto Draco’s lap, letting go of Draco’s hand so that he could hold Draco’s head in his. The kiss was messy, too much teeth, all hot panting breaths as they tried to renegotiate themselves, Harry barely letting Draco pull away to adjust their positioning, so desperately did he cling to him. Draco grinned against his mouth, hoisted Harry up as he moved back on the couch so that Harry could straddle his hips properly without falling off, couldn’t stop grinning as Harry eagerly began sucking hickeys down Draco’s neck. He didn’t care what his colleagues would say at the bank tomorrow, he’d wear them proudly.
“I don’t really go by that title,” Harry told the Elven king, fighting back a sneer. “It’s a little much, don’t you think?”
“Your life was in danger,” he said in what he hoped was a reassuring tone. “Whoever it was, they were going to kill you next. No one could blame you for saving yourself.”
Harry fell back against Draco with an embarrassed groan. Draco chuckled, the sound vibrating in his chest against Harry’s back.
“I think there’s something wrong with me,” Draco said at last. The hand rubbing his back paused for a moment. “I don’t…work like I should.”
, really, he’d lived without Potter before, he could do it again, she had just looked at him over her glass and he knew she saw right through him. Tonight, when she showed up with the wine, he didn’t even try to lie.
He had ultimately decided not to quit the force. Not just yet, anyway. He and Hermione had drawn up a formal complaint against the department for discrimination, but it had gone nowhere. There simply had not been enough proof to condemn Robards for his words. In the process, however, Hermione had discovered that there were no laws in place protecting individuals from discrimination in the workplace. It became all too painfully clear why the Ministry had been able to get away with targeting Muggleborns during the war. When Hermione had told him, wringing her hands as she trembled with rage and far too much caffeine, Harry had sat down at his desk, his knees giving way with shock. He looked around the bull pen, at all of his colleagues, at Julia from Accounting who was walking by holding the contents of her desk in a cardboard box – she had handed in her resignation the week Harry was suspended.
“Good,” Draco said. “Very, uh, rewarding.” Harry stifled a snort, and Draco shot him a quick glare. Narcissa didn’t seem to notice.
"Oh." Lark went from looking shocked to bemused in the span of about ten seconds. "Oh!" Draco wondered, for the first time, how old he was. "Yeah, I'll- I'll do that then. Can I nip off to the Potions Room first though?"
“No I don't.” Harry scrambled to keep up as Draco started walking again, if possible, he was being even brisker than before. “They trust me with jack shit. They want powerful, not smart. That’s why they keep you people around.”
“Accio broom.” He called into the night, to no avail. Even so, he kept his hand outstretched for a couple of minutes, in a bleak sort of hope. A damning hope that he carried with him always.
And with that, Draco vanished, the wispy grey trace the only thing left to indicate he’d apparated away.
”The bookmark.” Draco said, far too quickly - as the image of Harry bending him over the table he was currently sat at flitted unhelpfully through his mind.
Harry snorted, not quietly enough, apparently, because Draco moved his head towards the armchair to shoot him a glare, lips pursed in a frown.
“Alright, alright I’m getting up but I’m going to have to hold onto something or I’ll fall down the stairs.” Draco said through a bleary-eyed yawn while Harry pulled him to his feet.
Your son. Not our son. Draco sighed, before seating himself on an armchair that opposed his mothers, ignoring the lace doily he'd neglected to remove.
"Of course." Draco waved him away with a flourish of his hand. The man could do what he liked, he was the one who'd been throwing around his sickles all evening.
Harry had woken continuously at 6am for the last twelve years, first with Ginny and later with Draco - minus the eight months in between when he’d slept alone for the first time since he was seventeen.
“You’re not a Muggle.” Draco kissed Harry on the shoulder before asking him to move out of the way of the sink. “Reparo.”
“Romilda slipped me some from under the counter. Don’t look at me like that, it’s chicken not a substance charm.”
Draco’s eyes widened, immediately straying to the mantelpiece that held the photo of Harry, Hermione and Ron; all cackling at something just out of frame.
The three kids explore the pet shop with beaming eyes. Draco remembers the night before, Arianna and the twin were in her room all night after dinner discussing what animal should they adopt. And they decided to get a cat.
Arianna looked at the door to see her grandparents running towards her bed. She cried harder as she hugs her grandmother.
And I'm not good at explaining things so if you're curious about the crystal pendulum go here: https://id.pinterest.com/pin/29906785015128856/
"You okay Harry?" Hermione ask. He's now back at the ministry for a case, leaving his second wife, Ginny, and their son, James.
"None of it, Auntie," Arianna mumbled. The woman giggles before walking towards Arianna and give her the biggest hug you could ever imagine.
"Any animal you chose I'll let you keep it, but you have to take care of it, my love, as I said...."
"No," he replied. Closing the file with a sigh. Hermione looks at her friend strangely before sitting on the chair in front of Harry.
"I don't know... But if he's with us who will accompany Ver? They can have a bonding time while we buy some ice cream," Arianna says, ruffling Scorpius' hair. The youngest pout but nodded either way.
Draco gasp for air as he rises from his bed. Tiny giggles filled his bed as a weight crashed to his lap.
"Arianna, it's alright dear. Anyway, your uncle Adrian and aunt Riverna are going to be here at noon and they won't be happy to see you sad," Draco says.
'Annie' Siorney. A lovely woman with wavy blonde hair, and light brown eyes. Without her, Draco maybe won't be standing here with his daughter and two sons.
Second, 's later a sky blue ribbon appears on Arianna's little hands. Draco said a silent thank you for the house-elf before doing his daughter's hair.
"Sure, just let me look at the kids and change my clothes first," Draco says. Annie nod as she went to the cabinets next to the bookshelf.
"You must be Aziel and Ashton! Draco said that the two of you will be joining us for dinner, well then come on in! It's nice to have new faces around!" The woman without any word wrap her arms around Aziel and Ashton's then drag the two man inside the house.
"Get your brothers Raven, lunch is almost ready. Are you staying, Aziel?" Draco asks. The older man shook his head, giving Draco a small smile.
"Mom, can we stay over at Aunt Annie's place after dinner?" Thomas ask. Walking ahead of the others or chasing Verendus down the path.
The potion room is next to their Mother's room, where Arianna can hear a faint son coming from there. She isn't stupid, that man had the same eyes as her and messy black hair like Thomas. For nine years of her life, she never asks where's he is or what he looks like. She knows it brings great pain to their Mother.
"Thank you, Annie," Draco said and the woman smile at him before talking to Ashton. The woman, okay I'm sorry, Arianna's godmother,
The four walks out of the store and go straight to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, well the twins ran there while Ari and Draco have some small talk.
"Well, aren't we came just in time," Aziel says as he glared at the muggle in front of him. Well until his husband, Ashton Slytherin-Gaunt, give him a pat on his back.
Heading downstairs, Aziel look at his husband who is chatting with Annie and nod. Ashton smile at him before saying goodbyes and they walk to the floo.
"He said it himself," she whispered but clear enough for Aziel. Helping his niece? To the wolf's back, she quickly lay down to Verendus' neck and wrap her arms around it.
She saw the twins yesterday. They look fine, and that's good. She doesn't want them to see the same thing as she did.
"I thought that casserole was my recipe! Annie!" Draco says dramatically looking at Annie. And that the starting of a 'friendly' argument between Annie and Draco, with Ashton of course.
Yes, they had a marriage contract signed by their grandparents. But Harry never loves Malfoy, and then there's the scene on Diagon Alley.
"Ron! Fine those little bastards!" Another woman said. Arianna panicked when a man comes face to face with her. His wand was pointing at her ready to hex her anytime.
"Come back soon okay!" Annie said as she hands Aziel the floo powder. Ashton nods and said a few words before they floo back to Gaunt manor.
"You've grown big, tiny twin!" The woman said while Arianna tried to get as many airs as she could get.
"No dear, Miss Gallo did mention them but I was too busy running my errand," Draco replied as he went to look at the kitchen cabinets.
Verendus survive the incident, he almost didn't make it but here he is. Unlike Cepheus, he died in the incident, covered by his blood with a big gashed on his stomach. The twin mourns the death of their kitten the next day.
"And who would they be? You didn't kidnap these poor children did you Malfoy, can't have these poor children near you,"
"Well now I know my baking skills are improving, now let's eat everyone! Dinner ain't gonna disappeared itself!" Annie says.
Arianna turns around and saw a man and woman came closer to them. The woman was glaring at her mother, but the man is looking at them.
Around five minutes later they arrived at the cottage. Through the window, Cepheus jumped to the porch and ran towards Draco.
"I still have no idea why you name your daughter after that muggle, Draco," Aziel mumbled as he sneaking behind Draco and grab a sandwich.
"Yes dearest I'm awake, now come on! Let's get into the shower shall we?" Draco says scooping his daughter from the bed, making Arianna squealed.
"Ver, tomorrow is my mother's birthday. What should I gave him?" Arianna asked the sleeping direwolf. She chuckled when Verendus sneeze, before playing again.
The three mysterious people drag them both to the first floor. Arianna tried to escape but as hard as she tried, the woman still holding her arm.
"Tommy! Scrappy! I miss you little devil's, did you two do something mischief while I'm not there?" The woman asks. There's a glimpse of mischief in her eyes, staring at the twins.
"I'll be back in a minute okay," Arianna smiled at her little brother before going upstairs. The cottage has two floors, 5 bedrooms now 4 because one of the rooms is used for them to make potions and 3 bathrooms. They have a garden where Arianna and Draco plant any flowers they could plant.
So I accidentally publish this chapter. I tried to unpublish it but I don't know how what to do so happy reading guys.
"You to Scorp?" Draco asks his youngest son who nods his head. Draco shook his head at the twins. How could they left him alone! Oh! The pain.
"No!" Draco yelled. Using his last energy, he ran to his daughter. Draco immediately pulled her and use his body as a shield.
"Chicken sandwich Raven, you want anything else?" Draco asks. Arianna shook her head as she gets back to the living room.
"Sweetie, be a good girl and call your grandparents, your mother and I will be fine," Annie says as she points the knife she had in her right hand to the man.
"Mother!" Arianna said. Verendus gave a warning growl when they heard someone, no, a woman yelling at her godmother.
"Kill them, sell them, sent them to an orphanage or something, I don't care! Just make sure to obliviate their memory,"
"Afternoon Draco! Came to drop these two trouble makers," Aziel says as Thomas and Scorpius came into the house.
Arianna woke up when she heard a loud noise coming from downstairs. Shaking Verendus to wake up, the wolf jump from the bed and went to the door.
"Wake up Mommy! Or uncle Sev and uncle Tom would be angry for being late!" Draco's 2-year-old daughter says. Felt like yesterday his little Raven was just a baby and now she is already running around the mansion.
"What," Aziel asks. Trying not to hex the wolf for ruining his pants, Verendus just keep staring at him before he headed upstairs. Hearing a growl coming from the staircase, Aziel grunts but follow either way.
"I'll get some healing potion for your butt okay Scorp, I did saw you hit the ground pretty hard," Arianna says, letting down her brother to the sofa.
Aziel suddenly felt something tug his pants. He looks down and saw Verendus bitting his newly bought pants.
"Mother, I wished you'll make up soon. The twins and I miss you dearly, nothing feels the same without you," Arianna whisper as she heard a small whimper coming from her left.
But his attack failed when Verendus charge and bite his arm. The man screams as he tried to get Verendus away, screaming like a mad man.
"But are you sure they are Malfoy's children? It could be he was taking someone else's child to Diagon Alley,"
"Moony, can you get Scorp a cup of milk please," Arianna says to the house-elf. Seconds later, a cup full of milk appears on the coffee table and some fresh bread from the pantry.
"G...Grandpa h..help" Arianna is now crying. Holding the bowl tightly. Seconds before the smoke change she heard a faint 'Avada' and saw a green light, followed by a loud thud, and the sound of her mother screaming.
Any comments are welcome! If you all have something to recommend I'll try to make it happen and reply.
When he reached the top, Aziel realized that the wolf had open the twin's bedroom door before going to the next room across from the twins, opening the door with his mouth and went in. Rolling his eyes, Aziel walk towards the twin's room but stop when he saw a faint glow coming from Arianna's room. Aziel peeked in and saw the clothes that Arianna wear was glowing and then changed to simple white t-shirts and green leggings, the clothes she was wearing a few seconds ago was now folded nicely on the armchair in her room.
"Annie dear, let go of Ari okay. Look at her! She's suffocating," Draco said again and this time the woman let go.
"I heard there's a new neighbors mother, have you met them?" Arianna asks, Putting the last bag on the kitchen counter.
Arianna giggled at her brothers but nod as well. It's been a while she tasted any ice cream, and no one in the village sells ice cream even though there is a market place.
Then the smoke changed color, from a full grey to a sky blue color and the face of her grandfather appear.
"My butt hurt, Ari," Scorpius whispered, Arianna, nod her head and picked up her little brother. She quickly pulled Thomas away from the person who bumps Scorpius before something gets bad.
Behind the three arguing wizards as ND muggle. Aziel carried, now sleeping twins on both of his arms while Arianna walks beside him, her tiny hand grips to Aziel's trench coat.
And Annie. She died as well, one of the culprits use the unforgivable curse at her. Her ceremony will be held tomorrow as the whole town mourn her death.
Grabbing the potions that are needed, and some of the floo powder. Grabbing a bowl then put the two ingredients together. Slowly the mixture turns grey as smoke appears from the bowl. The commotion downstairs getting louder as shouts of spells filled the cottage.
"Aw! C'mon Dray! Even if I'm away from you for just a couple of hours, I miss my goddaughter every second I breathe!"
For three days, Arianna has to stay at St. Mungo's because of the trauma she had. She missed her mother badly after that incident.
Arianna was sitting on her bed reading a book or not. She wasn't paying attention to any of the words in the book, she was looking at a picture of his mother with someone. She stole this picture when she was around five years old when her mother isn't looking.
Today was a normal day as always. Arianna is sitting on the porch, playing with her guitar. Scorpius and Thomas are spending the day in their Godfather's house and won't be back until lunch.
Arianna tries to hold her laughter, seeing the betrayed face hearing what the twins have said. Taking a deep breath, and let it out seconds later. Arianna gives her mother an encouraging smile.
Using her magic to summon a book, a quill, and a piece of paper. Arianna took the paper and the quill and put them on the table, then take the book, opening a few pages before reading it, and write it as well.
"Hello, Raven! You look well!" The man said. Aziel Leucos Galon Slytherin-Gaunt, the first son and heir to Tom Marvolo Slytherin-Gaunt and the godfather of Thomas and Scorpius. Aziel was a tall man with black wavy hair and deep red eyes. Every man envy him and every woman wants to get into his pants, but poorly for them, he's already married.
“That’s the problem! I’ve gone through practically every eligible guy in school who’s age appropriate, and I’ve burned a lot of bridges. None of those guys want to DATE me.”
“Well I don’t mind telling you that I slept with Fred in fifth year,” said Turpin calmly. Weasley stared at her, stunned.
Justin looked away but Draco still caught the brief flash of disappointment that crossed his face. When was he going to give up on Blaise?
The next morning he jolted awake early when he rolled over in his sleep and his back screamed in protest. The sky was barely the pearly grey of pre dawn, but he dragged himself up and collected his wash things. Hot water was what he needed right now.
A fight had broken out between two mean looking Ravenclaws and Potter, who had just been thrown backwards into one of the bookcases. It toppled and books came pouring off the shelves, raining down on a group of screaming girls who dived out of the way. Draco groaned.
He paused, rubbing a hand over his face. Draco was trying not to find it charming that he was so expressive with his hands when he got flustered. He sat down on the edge of Justin’s bed, and stared at his feet before he continued.
“What kind of fee are you getting for pimping me out Hermione?” He muttered. His words were kept private by the flurry of activity around them, as the other students pulled out their textbooks to begin working on the number grid that had appeared on the blackboard.
“Charming,” he chuckled. “ At least it’s pretty clear that she fancies you. That should make you happy.”
I’m so sorry this is later than planned. I’ve had the chance to work up in Edinburgh for a few weeks, and guys, it’s the most magical city. I can totally see why it inspired so much of the Harry Potter world. While I’ve lost my respect for JKR in the last few years (her recent behaviour has hurt me on all sorts of levels) my love for Harry Potter can never die. ~Kisses~
Draco felt his cheeks get hot, and glanced around for an easy escape route. Potter already had his wand in his hand. Draco hadn’t even seen him move. He’d stayed in his relaxed position against the bar, but he was vibrating with coiled energy, a manic smile on his face.
Draco whipped back to look at him, his eyebrows raised in quiet outrage. Before he could open his mouth, he saw that his reaction caused a flash of triumph to burn deep in Potter’s eyes.
He let out a deep breath, watching the stream of white mist that filled the air, and jumped when a large Eagle owl landed heavily on his shoulder. He grunted in pain as Ulysses dug his talons in to steady himself, and pulled at a chunk of Draco’s hair. He loved the owl dearly, but Ulysses was a bastard.
“It’s my godfather’s jacket. I didn’t want to ruin it,” Potter explained quietly, keeping pace with Draco.
Draco sighed and looked up at Blaise. He couldn’t help but take a second to admire the toned expanse of dark skin on display, with the dusting of black hair across his chest and trailing down from his belly button.
He’d just settled in bed with a book, when Justin shot back into the room looking giddy. Draco looked up at him startled.
“If I like? We need to decide how we’re going to do this Potter. You can’t just stand up in the Great Hall and shout ‘I’m dating Draco Malfoy now, someone call the press!’”
“It’s not completely hopeless. I’ve been doing research on memory charms, and I’ve written to a few experts in the field. Unfortunately the mind is a tricky thing, and my original spell went quite deep,” she indicated the stack of books beside her, and Draco saw they were all focused on the study of the mind.
Weasley spluttered, sitting forward and staring shocked at MacMillan before whipping his head around the group.
When Justin had laughed himself into exhaustion, he stayed sprawled on his bed and watched Draco curiously.
He frowned. Last month he’d taken Luna to meet his lawyer and sign the paperwork for her Malfoy trust fund. It was old money, so part of the process required blood magic to allow her access.
On Saturday morning Pansy hugged him tightly. He wrapped his arms around her shoulders and squeezed reassuringly.
“You know, I can buy my own booze,” Potter muttered, drumming his fingers against the edge of the bar. His fingernails were black and gold, chipped along the edges. Draco briefly wondered how many colours of nail varnish Potter owned, and if he painted them himself. He just couldn’t picture Potter painting his own nails for some reason.
“I’ll check on you later,” Finch-Fletchley added, patting Draco’s arm before pulling the curtains closed around his bed.
He didn’t want to acknowledge that it was wearing him down. The notes on healing magic that he’d made last year, which he’d mainly used when he’d been forced to go back home, were now much more extensive. He knew the incantation for bruises off by heart, and he’d fixed a broken nose and several broken fingers. He knew the counter spells for quite a few nasty jinxes. If only he were taking Defence Against the Dark Arts as a NEWT, he thought he might do pretty well.
MacMillan was a large, imposing boy. He was almost as tall as Draco, but much wider. He had a plump face and short dirty blonde hair. His eyes were a washed out blue and far apart which made him look a little vague, but Draco knew that was not the case. His excellent marks and past status as a Prefect notwithstanding, Draco knew MacMillan had been heavily involved in the student rebellion with Dumbledore's Army the previous year, and he’d been savvy enough to nearly be completely overlooked. It dawned on Draco then that the reason Finch-Fletchley had been more accepting of his presence was because he’d been absent for the pervious year. He hadn’t been there to witness first hand just how wide the divide between Slytherin and the rest of the student body had become. It had been naive of Draco to even hope that the other students would treat him with anything less than open hostility.
She came around the curtain, looking uncertain, but she paused when she saw the state he was in. Her eyes roamed over the mark left by the blasting spell, but also the smaller marks and scars which were visible on the exposed skin of his chest.
“You do realise that’s completely your fault because of that bloody article in fourth year,” she huffed.
“I’m sure you were Pans, but I can’t imagine it was even very scandalous gossip. My father was already the Malfoy Heir, and from what Luna says about Pandora, I’m sure it was hardly a surprise to anyone that she was such a big ‘disappointment’. I wish I’d met her.”
The noise of footsteps slowly climbing the stairs towards the common room had him stiffening and looking to the doorway warily.
“This seems more intense than it should be for an errand trip to Hogsmeade,” he probed gently, waving a hand to indicate the piles of discarded clothes on Draco’s bed.
“Could you do an announcement about that in the Great Hall? Save people from hurting themselves in the future, and from hurting me in the present,” he said half jokingly to cover up his discomfort.
“You’re stronger than they think Draco. You’re stronger than you think. People will see the change I see in you. You’re a good person.”
Healer Merrick would suggest that Draco think about why Finch-Fletchley made him uncomfortable. He considered it as he washed his hair forcefully. He supposed that if he really thought about it, Finch-Fletchley’s mannerisms reminded him a lot of how he used to behave when he was young and freer with himself. His father had hated it, and said he wouldn’t have his son acting like some little Nancy boy. Draco had been punished severely if he had behaved too flamboyantly in front of his father, until he had learned to conduct himself in a manner befitting of a Malfoy heir.
“You should really stop doing things you need to apologise for then,” he said, and he was embarrassed by how croaky his voice sounded. He coughed a little.
They all crowded onto the moving spiral staircase. Draco’s breathing hitched in panic, the unknown of the near future crashing over him. He closed his eyes briefly, trying to centre himself. He almost yelped in surprise when he felt a cold, calloused hand grip his fingers tightly. His eyes popped open and he looked down at Potter beside him, who was staring straight ahead. Potter squeezed his hand reassuringly, and then let go. The brief contact was enough to shock Draco into the present.
“It’s a café, actually, sir,” Harry said as neutrally as he could. “And you’re right, it is a shame, because he has all the proper qualifications in Potions Mastery. You would think people would set aside their prejudices and see the man for who he is, not for what they think he is. But I’m sure you have nothing to do with him getting denied every work opportunity available, would you, sir?”
“Please? I know it’s a childish way to-” Harry’s nose and ears coloured considerably, warmth radiating from his cheeks.
If Harry kept looking at him like that he was almost sure he’d drop it. He decided to focus on talking, telling him useless facts and the ingredients and about the distilling process.
He left them all to it as he moved down the aisle, touching the backs of chairs where friends and family sat, the folding chairs that had been hastily jammed into the snow that very morning.
The House Elf Tax was one thing. What Draco never had enough money for, however, were friends. Not for lack of trying, but people just didn't want to associate with the Malfoy name when it was anywhere outside of Saint Potters personal interest.
“No or I wouldn’t still be here and you wouldn’t be squeaking in pain.” Draco hissed, pausing to rub his eyes.
Reluctantly, Harry shuffled back from the dripping sink as Draco’s fingers carded through his hair, lightly at first, before he started pressing down.
”Oh you’ll still have mishaps. They’ll just be man-made.” Harry smiled, twirling the ring around his finger, already thinking about how he’d probably lose it in the bath within a month.
He'd said so too, quite loudly, through a pounding hangover. Luna had rubbed his back and led him from the office, he was sure she'd said something about having a potion in her bag but he'd never actually seen her retrieve anything.
He waved awkwardly at some glaring faces he remembered vaguely: a gaggle of girls no older than eighteen seated by the door, an older man who seemed irritated by Harry’s outburst - probably one of those who wrote an underread column about unwarranted fame and exuberant youth - and another small crowd of reporters seated in the back, probably trying their best to be noticed as little as Draco.
“But when you do it 100 points to Gryffindor.” Draco mimicked Dumbledore’s accent, badly, as he pushed his tea away to rest his head on the table.
“Okay.” Harry shrugged. “Can we circle back to the part where I compared you to the Dursley’s and you just acquiesced?”
“Understandable.” Harry sat down. “Are you still talking about Robards? Because if he tries to claim you’ve been fired, sue him.”
They would care because they were her friends, but not because they were actually interested in whatever she was doing for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
He didn’t hear the rest of her micro-speech as he grabbed his jacket from where he’d flung it over the back of the kitchen chair, leaving Hermione sour-faced, standing alone in the hallway.
The clock resumed it’s ticking and Draco breathed out, a sort of contented sigh, or maybe a sigh of relief.
“Are you really asking if I want to see properly?” Harry pulled away. “This isn’t a movie. Just like I’m not the saviour of the wizarding world—I can’t see and I don’t want to be a martyr for the blind in the same way. My glasses keep breaking and although I don’t know why, it doesn’t matter. I’m not brave in my suffering.” Harry breathes out, aware he was getting riled.
“You’ve got that look on your face again.” Hermione hiked her bag up on her shoulder from where it was slipping, the extension charm obvious thanks to the loud rattle inside.
Instead, he turned over, carefully, steadying his breathing as he watched long, dark hair shift against his pillow.
Harry hesitated for only a fraction of a second before shrugging and dropping to the ground, the autumn leaves crunching under his back as he shifted.
The blankets had been Harry’s idea, as well as the wooden box at the entrance of the church - not that they’d be using it. The box was to be stuffed with blankets before the ceremony, which was going to take place on the tidy stretch of lawn at the front of the church.
“I said fixed it! I righted the shelf, sealed the broken edges and put the books back.” Harry rushed ahead before Draco could ask, stumbling over his words as he went. “They’re mostly in the right order. I did say yesterday.”
By this point Harry had given up. He pointed at the window, shaking slightly, hiccuping twice as he gulped air back into his lungs.
"Yeah, why not?" Draco felt a flash of heat tingle down his spine as he lent into Lark, angling his body away from the wind.
“Not the welcome I thought I’d be getting but I’m glad you’re home and I wasn’t wasting my breath by shouting at an empty house.”
“Not always. We’re comfortable enough to be able to gently rib each other. I do it to Ron too, usually whenever he tries to tell me that a cheese toasty is a balanced diet.”
When Draco properly looked at her later, at the pub before everyone else crowded in, he nodded appealingly. Her hair was swept up in a ponytail, although it still managed to reach halfway down her back. She'd positioned her wand in such a way that it cut straight down the middle, focusing a little ball of energy on the mass of blond locks so they'd stay in place.
He hated his boss for a lot of reasons but trying to tamper with staff space was out of the question. The war had wreaked havoc on the inside of the Ministry, turning a team against each other was a Death Eater tactic and Harry wanted no part in it.
“Here.” Draco pointed to a particularly fancy piece of handwritten Latin. “This means, uh, kissing. Essentially.”
There was an actual cigarette bin, Merlin knows why, on the inside porch. Draco busied himself with halfheartedly rubbing the back of his white (now grey) heel with his cloak, before giving up and dropping the cloak on top of someone else's on the only available hook.
Draco ignored it, instead settling back on his haunches. “You don’t seem as excited as you should be.” It came out as a question.
Bass thrummed under his feet and up through his bones whilst glaring white strobe-lights blinked in and out of focus overhead. Draco assumed they were supposed to mimic some sort of shooting star but he couldn't tell, and he wasn't about to risk his perfectly good eyesight in order to find out.
“Oh! But wasn’t he supposed to do that impassioned speech about war orphans?” Her dark lipsticked mouth quirked upwards as she crossed her ankles, her hands sliding seamlessly into her trouser pockets.
Harry swallowed, forcefully. His voice was too loud for the intimacy of a moment he’d want to cherish.
The thought wasn't quite a memory. It was a warped version of what used to happen at restaurants. And balls. And weddings. He decided it was probably safer to start retching after he'd consumed some alcohol, instead of before. It was far too soon in the night for all that, regardless of how dark the club was.
Draco cringed at the memory of that particular night, alone in the school’s infirmary - decorated with white sheets and disinfectant charms.
“Have you stopped though? When I told you the first time did you even consider why I was informing you at all? You work for the government! You handle their secrets!”
He'd hoped Shacklebolt wouldn't give him the time off; make up some flimsy excuse about hours like he did with Potter, but no. Since Draco got up at the ass-crack of dawn every Monday to Friday and Potter came in around lunchtime and sometimes skipped Thursdays altogether Draco was 'entitled to a few days off'. It was ridiculous.
Somehow they’d fallen into comfortable conversation, pushing childhoods under the rug and the chairs—anywhere they’d fit, so for once the war couldn’t touch anything.
Every star Draco had ever laid eyes upon couldn’t compare to the galaxy exploding behind his eyes as Harry ran his hands through Draco’s hair, his fingers looping runaway strands behind his ears in slow, practiced motions.
Draco waited on the other side of the door, already cringing at the very obvious homophobia that was about to occur.
Ron and Hermione exchanged glances as Harry pulled another chair out from the dining room. Sheepishly he evanesco’ed another pair of glasses.
Harry in an armchair by the fire, with Ron leaning against his knee, gangly legs stretched out on the rug. Hermione sat herself on one end of the sofa so Draco was forced to sit on the other; stiff and awkward like a jointed marionette.
He practically felt Lucius drag his hand down his face in slow motion, probably to avoid looking at his son, who was currently kneeling on his floor, frantically making complicated knots in his shoe with a wand hanging from his mouth.
Draco barked a laugh, turning it into a cough as he stepped away from the door. His father had been out of prison six months and still, neither of them could hold their tongues around their prejudices. Merlin. "I hope I wasn't interrupting anything, Draco."
The ring was simple, nestled in a bed of white silk. Harry moved his tray to his side table, moving closer to Draco and the box. “Are you actually asking to marry me?”
Harry laughed as Draco tried to put two and two together. The fact that Ron could cook really well-put-together, balanced meals and still resorted to eating the worst combinations of those foods himself seemed like an enigma to him.
Harry’s bed was different to the one Draco had slept in, but he wasn’t thinking about anything other than Harry’s legs entwined in his.
Draco let his head fall back, the recollection that he too had left his broom in the broomshed that afternoon hitting him like a train; his hand leaving the black handle of his broom to shove back through the small crowd of people who’d continued playing for the camadere of it all.
The 40 minute walk was scenic, if cold. Dozens of windows were painted with frost and a layer of snow crunched underfoot.
Before Harry could even think about Walaburga Black’s incessant screaming Ron rushed on, assuring himself that Harry wasn’t too deep in his own head not to listen to him. “What’s that poncey git got to do with sticking charms?”
It turned out it wasn’t so much a knob as it was a crank. A small hand crank jutting out from the side of the table, hidden only by the wide tabletop.
“You have got to leave, right now.” Draco was whispering, his breath hot on Harry’s face as he yanked him into the closet. It smelled clean. Like disinfectant, a lemony smell. Harry, with his messed up uniform and muddy face breathed it in. “Are you even listening to me… you smell like a pigsty what on Earth have you been doing?”
“Acetone.” Harry had muttered the same word over and over again as he searched the storage cupboards under the sink, the only difference being the cadence of his voice as he tried to squeeze his long, athletic limbs into the tight space.
Draco relaxes into the feeling of being allowed to take control, whirling Harry almost seamlessly in and out of the masses of people, manoeuvring him around the dance floor with a dexterity Harry had never seen before.
“To answer your question, sort of?” Justin hummed thoughtfully, “Everyone else seemed to know before I really did, but I’ve always just been me. When I told my parents they pretty much said ‘we know’ and carried on with breakfast.”
“Draco people don’t trust any of us right now, and we haven’t given them any reason to. We acted out of fear last year, but we’re already braver just by coming back. I know I’ve done a lot of terrible things, but I’ve grown up and realised that people aren’t so easy to predict. How are they supposed to know that you’ve changed unless you show them?”
He dithered around the common room a little longer, and then he marched up the stairs to the dorm rooms.
The next doorway showed him Blaise looking extremely put upon as Weasley bellowed something to Longbottom opposite. Draco grinned. He couldn’t wait to hear what Blaise had to say about that set up. Thomas and Finnigan seemed to be the only same House pair so far. The heated gleam in Finnigan's eyes as he firmly closed their door left Draco wondering if McGonagall had done that on purpose, or if she had simply thought they wouldn’t play nicely with others. It was clear enough to Draco that they would be sharing a bed whether they were sharing a room or not, so thank Merlin for small mercies, whatever McGonagall’s reasons.
“Ergh OK,” Draco growled, “I don’t like it. I can’t control everybody else, but you’re one of my best friends. You should take pity on me.”
When I started writing this fic I really didn’t set out to make Justin Finch-Fletchley into a character, but then I stuck him in Draco’s room to cause mischief (for my own amusement) and he just turned into the cutest muffin. Now I love him. ~Kisses~
“There’s not much to tell... we’ve barely spoken to each other. He sort of asked me out on Wednesday, and Hermione has kind of set us up I think? I’m still confused about everything, and I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t sure how you felt about Potter?”
Draco hoped he had managed to school his face so it didn’t let on that he knew that already. It wasn’t a good idea for Potter to find out how often Draco had stared at him in the Great Hall over the years.
Draco had barely turned away, when a large hand came down on his shoulder, gripping firmly. His stomach lurched as he looked back at Beckett.
“Of course old boy. I’m a locked vault,” he answered, trying to straighten his face so as not to seem too interested.
Potter frowned and moved towards him, but Draco planted his hands on Potter’s chest and pushed him back again.
Draco grabbed Potter by the shoulders and started steering him towards his room. Potter perked up at once.
There were a few nervous titters and blushes as people felt the effects of the spell compelling them to tell the truth.
The raspberry crème brûlée looked perfect. Potter picked up the spoon happily, before glancing over at Draco.
Draco snorted, spraying water against the tiles. What did it even mean to be a Malfoy heir now? Finch-Fletchley reminded him of his father’s punishments, but that wasn’t his fault. It wouldn’t hurt to try to get on with his roommate.
“There’s quite a gathering waiting to see how long they’ll be in there. I really don’t see what the fuss is about, but the way everyone is going on about it, he’s really put the kneazle amongst the pixies now. Their perfect poster boy just discarded his picket fence future to out himself.”
Potter had snorted derisively at the mention of Draco’s father. Draco gritted his teeth, and huffed quietly.
“Did you know there’s a way to create a full sized tornado? What reason would anyone have for that?”
Hermione and Pansy shoved their way through the spectators, and rushed to Draco’s side. Pansy immediately started patting him down for injuries, while Hermione assessed the scene. Her demeanour was calm, but the small crease between her eyes betrayed her concern.
“Spice Girls,” Draco corrected before he could stop himself, avoiding the fact that he would have just waited for Blaise had Finch-Fletchley not asked him.
I take an enormous amount of hilarious joy in thinking about Draco and Luna walking around the castle looking like the creepy twins from The Shining, with long blonde hair. This chapter was important to me because I really want to make sure Draco is fully on his path to redemption before anything happens between him and Harry. So sue me... or don’t because I have no money, but I can offer you another party in the next chapter instead. ~Kisses~
Seeing Snape in the Headmaster’s chair the previous year had been jarring, but seeing McGonagall in the same seat didn’t seem so strange. There were several new faces at the faculty table. A strikingly beautiful black woman was seated beside McGonagall, her curls bouncing as she laughed with Professor Flitwick. Further along the table a serious looking older wizard with a full dark beard and long salt and pepper hair was in deep discussion with a plump young woman whose cropped hair was almost as blonde as Draco’s own.
Justin allowed Draco to sit quietly with his own thoughts, while he distracted Abbott by planning a shopping trip on the weekend.
He’d written to his mother a couple of times since arriving back at school. Usually he just wrote generic pleasantries, to let her know he was thinking about her, even though he used a great deal of energy not thinking about her.
He stared at her some more. Obviously he wanted to date Potter, but what alternative universe had he stumbled into where that could be a possibility. It was a ridiculous notion that would end terribly. For him.
A huge part of him, the part of him that believed there was no coming back from the path his parents had set him on, the part of him that didn’t think he deserved anyone’s forgiveness, wanted to run away. To make his excuses to Finch-Fletchley and revert to his original plan of avoiding everyone. That was what a coward would do, and Draco was certain of his cowardice. Just maybe though, he could make a different choice. Maybe he didn’t deserve forgiveness, but avoiding facing the repercussions of his past was no better than regressing to his old habits and ways of thinking.
“Why?” was all he said, genuinely confused. Potter didn’t need to justify his behaviour to the likes of Draco.
He did a twirl, his hair bouncing, and froze when he saw Draco. He flushed, but he held his head up and met Draco’s gaze firmly.
As he was rifling through his wardrobe, Justin bounced into the room, still in his pyjamas, his hair wet from the shower. Within seconds a familiar song began to play as the record player started spinning.
“I’m sorry Pans,” he mumbled through his fingers, “the thought of a party with all these people who hate me... just makes me testy.”
Hermione, Luna, and Padma watched them approach. Potter was staring hard at his bottle of butterbeer, as though he could transfigure it into something stronger with the power of frustration alone.
Draco looked up quickly, and saw Granger’s hand freeze over her page of notes on the other side of the table. He glared at Pansy, but she glared right back at him.
He fussed about what to do with his hair for a while, before leaving it loose. Justin tried to convince him that eye makeup was a good idea, but he wasn’t comfortable with that.
He wanted to know about this brave woman who had grown up like he had, but had managed to leave the Malfoy restrictions behind her and carve out her own life.
Pansy was very tense behind Draco, her leg twitching excitedly, but he couldn’t focus on her as he was forced to drink.
The distressing image of the Golden boy turning ashy as he gurgled in a pool of vomit, which flashed through his mind, propelled Draco into opening the door.
Not that he thought his father would make up something like that, but he couldn’t think why his father had broken his eighteen plus years of silence to talk about his disowned sister.
Draco almost gave in. Potter’s indifference of him lately had made him sorely miss the days when they would tear into each other. When he knew just what to say or do to make Potter really look at him. To be his sole focus. He hadn’t cared then if Potter hated him or not. He could be so intense and raw in those moments, and it had made purposefully superficial Draco feel terrified, but also thrilled.
Blaise just shrugged. Pansy whipped the newspaper away from him and opened it to pages 4 and 5. She started reading intently. Draco could see a couple more photos of Potter included with the article, but none of them looked recent. There was one he recognised as the photo that was taken for the Triwizard Tournament, and he felt a bubble of hysterical laughter in his chest when he saw that they had cropped the photo to only include Potter and Cedric Diggory. He could only imagine what Connie Cuffe was speculating about Potter’s past.
“I didn’t say he did Miss Parkinson, but he was clearly involved, and I’d like to get all the details.”
Justin slid into the booth with a bright exclamation of greeting. Pansy followed him silently, shooting very obvious glances at Padma.
“Sounds like a wild night. I’ll think about it,” Pansy said, her voice carefully neutral, not looking at Hermione.
“I mean I was beginning to wonder if this was your whole diabolical plan. Forcing me to have lunch alone, how dastardly,” Draco smiled a little.
He dropped the book into his lap hopelessly. He didn’t even have any homework left to distract him. He was too over prepared.
“I can’t keep secrets from her! She can smell secrets on me, she’ll torture me relentlessly. Can’t you just explain it to her?”
It was her turn to stare blankly at him, before she closed her eyes and loosened her defensive stance. She came and sat back down at the table, resting her chin in her palm.
Draco watched him, trying to stay resolute to the decision he’d just made. He was finding it hard not to take it back already, with Potter so agitated like this. No, he had to set boundaries. Potter really didn’t need to know how much of a pushover Draco was for him.
“Oh my God! Why didn’t you tell me!? I need to know everything!” his eyes were shining with excitement.
His family tree had been drilled into him for as long as he could remember. His father had made him sit and pore over the Malfoy lineage, all the lists of ancestors dating back to when records began. He had been quizzed, and punished for incorrect answers. It was part of the duty of a Malfoy Heir to know their history.
Reminder if there are any grammar mistakes, it's because I'm from Indonesia and my English at writing is sucks. Hope you like it!
"Let's get everything needed for him shall we," Draco says. His children waisted no time to search for anything they need for the new family member.
"C'mon Mum!" Thomas said from inside the house. Draco didn't even realize that he was the only one who was standing outside the porch.
"There's no more auntie for you, you little gremlin!" The younger woman said. she came closer to where Arianna stood and grabbed her arm, making the bowl she was holding fall.
"Thomas, no," she glared at her brother before looking at the person. He had messy black hair and a pair of brown eyes who is glaring at them.
"And that will be it if you want to know why..." Draco paused and slap Aziel's hand just before he grabs another sandwich.
Draco could barely feel anything. His body gave up but he forces himself to get up just to hug his daughter. Ignoring those damn blood traitors, Draco tried to cheer his Raven.
"So Dray, how is the new recipe? Have you try it yet?" Annie said. Her big brown eyes staring at his greyish blue eyes with excitement.
"Momma look! Isn't he cute!!" Draco woke up from his daydream and looked down. Scorpius was holding a tiny ragdoll cat to him. The cat's blue and green eyes looking at him with curiosity.
"Everything is 50 galleon, write your address here and we'll deliver it to your house immediately," the lady says. Draco handed the money and write down their house address.
"Good night Raven," Aziel said. Then he went to the twin's room, doing the same thing like changing Thomas and Scorpius to their PJs, and give them a good night kiss on the forehead.
Shacklebolt was about the only person in the place to treat his profession with any amount of respect. The compliment was inferred but it was more than direct enough for Draco, Kingsley was more understanding—and understandable—than his father had been, he didn’t want to be the one to ruin such a tenuous relationship.
Draco smiled as he fiddled with the drops. “If I started with the words ‘I’m just gonna disintegrate part of your eye.’ I doubt you would have let me anywhere near them.”
“Possibly but he will definitely make a fool of himself. The alcohol will either speed the curse itself up or increase the effects of it. So it might be more than a tablecloth problem. We need to make sure he at least drinks some sort of hangover potion.” She winced as she said it before looking at Draco. “Can you stop pacing? It’s making me jittery.”
“I didn’t think to question what I’d been taught when I should have and instead I stood my ground - I clung to what I knew like a raft.”
“This wasn’t the reason I was home early but we might as well go into Diagon Alley… you need acetone so our hallway doesn’t look like it’s been rampaged by toddlers and I, evidently, need new dress shoes.”
“Sorry.” He forced himself to stand still, his hands coming down on the back of his office chair, where he started tapping. “I’m just really worried about him. He might do something irreparable. I might do something irreparable.”
Draco hummed knowingly. “Oh... this and that.” He glanced up the stairs before wandering into the living room.
Harry’s eyes were shining as he tried to concentrate on the book Hermione had open on the kitchen table.
“Pansy said I could have it. She said you wouldn’t mind. I was going to ask you but you were so happy to tell me about your invention that I didn’t get the chance”.
“The difference between inspired medicine and uninspired medicine is love. When I met her, I knew: I loved her to the point of invention.”
“How do you fuck up a perfectly good crumpet?” Draco said while simultaneously stuffing the light spongy dough into his mouth.
Draco didn’t have to tell Harry how far that love stretched. Harry knew. He knew in the way that was so obvious his heart hurt a little thinking about it - the way his heart hurt now, watching Draco trace the fading ink on his forearm, lips quirked upwards in a faint, sad smile.
Harry heard his fork clatter back onto his plate, the piece of bacon dropping back down onto the tray as he watched Draco position himself at the end of the bed - the ring box going from a theoretical to an actuality in seconds.
Now, Harry thought back to their living room. The disarray of robes and RSVP’s, the dress shoes that should have been by the door but had ended up in a box underneath the adjustable shelf and, of course, the blasted wedding checklist flung haphazardly down on the coffee table.
He’d refused to look at the paper that morning - not that he read it anyway, but he usually liked having some idea of the topic of conversation just in case he was sprang upon by a particularly enthusiastic witch. There was no chance of that now, not until this curse was lifted.
“Whatever, Draco.” Harry grabbed his hand underneath the covers, lightly tracing patterns over his knuckles. “As long as you come with me to get new frames fitted. Skeeter will have a fit if she sees me walking around without them.”
The motion of taking his reading glasses from his breast pocket was fluid. It was early evening, the shop was closed and the chair groaned under his uncomfortable shifting. Even though he didn’t have cause to worry, he didn’t like the idea of vulnerability the weakness in his eyes brought.
Harry turned to watch multiple rivulets of water trickling from the sink and down the hall,  converging only at the entrance of the living room door, a thin line of water soaking into the carpet on the other side.
“As soon as you find out what that thing does, I want Potter down here immediately. I need him fitted with something that lets him do his job properly.”
He sat down with a casual “Hey, babe.” that probably sounded more like a strangled cat. “I’m not your husband.” He felt his heart keen against his chest as Harry’s face visibly dropped.
"Of course not, I was merely waiting to be allowed into the parlour. Of course, that's if you trust me near your wine cellar."
“Salazar’s sake Draco!” Blaise burst out, pulling his arm away from Draco’s grip. “Is this really still a thing? If you won’t do anything about this obsession you have, that’s on you, it has nothing to do with me. Practically every guy in the castle with even the slightest queer leaning has gotten into Potter’s pants but I’m not allowed? How is that fair?”
With a few hours left of the journey, Blaise put down his book and went for a wander along the train. Draco gazed out at the green countryside rushing past the window. He practised breathing and staying in the moment, the way his court mandated mind Healer had taught him. Pansy flicked through a magazine.
“Don’t think you’re getting out of this. All the eighth years will be there. It’s a welcome back celebration.”
Quite a few people looked unsettled as they were forced to drink. Draco reached for the Firewhisky, drinking it directly from the bottle. Potter downed his own drink. Weasley was squinting at him.
He leaned into Draco, pressing their bodies together. Feeling all the hard lines of him made Draco dizzy. He took a steadying breath. This close Potter smelled like cigarettes and Firewhisky, smoky and spicy.
Immediately his chest loosened and he felt a coolness rushing through his body, relaxing his muscles, and slowing his breath. As he began to breathe normally Madam Pomfrey brushed a gentle hand across his forehead.
Draco forced himself to turn around and leave the room. The corridor was still empty, the noise of people and music filtering up the stairs. The party didn’t sound like it was going to slow down any time soon.
“At least she doesn’t treat me like some damaged whore, like all the other women in my life,” he cut back without looking at her.
“I can’t believe I didn’t see it before. You look so much alike!” she exclaimed, looking between them.
He found the alcohol supply first, but it looked like Blaise had been around recently judging by the pitchers of cocktails on offer. Draco picked one which was a ghastly shade of red, but tasted like sweet spiced oranges. He downed one cup, and refilled it.
“Well, I didn’t have much choice. My father believes that any wizard who can’t speak Greek and Latin isn’t trying hard enough. He also made me learn Gaelic. The French and Italian were just for fun.”
Pansy tugged Draco backwards, making for the edge of the crowd, which was beginning to disperse. Blaise was waiting for them, his eyes sweeping the room, holding back a scared looking Justin.
Hermione stared hard at him for a moment, her hand still reached out, and then her eyes dropped to where he was holding his arm against his middle. She sighed softly.
With the loud shatter of glass against the wooden floor, all at once time pitched forwards in a whirl, as though desperately compensating for that last frozen moment.
“You know she’s upset, fighting with her isn’t going to help. You should try and be the bigger person,” Luna suggested gently.
Everything was so quiet, like the snow had cast a muffling spell over the whole castle. Draco was embarrassed about breaking down the night before. He felt foolish, but of all his friends, he thought Pansy and Justin might understand the most.
“Well enjoy your little lesbian crisis. I promised Justin I’d be up to help him look for an outfit, which will involve looking at all the clothes he owns again. It could take a while.”
He looked at her hopefully, before he sank down onto the floor next to his bag and hugged his knees.
My schedule is out the window. Too much work, too many new books coming out that I had to read! I'm still writing every day, chipping away at the ham, so I'll probably just start uploading chapters as and when I finish them.~Kisses~
As if sensing his thoughts racing, Pansy stepped up beside him and looped her arm through his. Even flanked by her and Blaise, Draco’s legs felt like jelly as she pulled him swiftly towards the train.
His nervous behaviour was making Draco anxious. He gritted his teeth, breathing deeply through his nose.
“We’re all having a perfectly lovely breakfast. Don’t come in here trying to use your feminine wiles to exploit nice people just because you’re too lazy to practice a spell. I know you think it’s beneath you to try at something that you’re not instantly good at, but a tiny bit of effort isn’t going to ruin your hair.”
She held up two more little vials, one with a pink liquid and one with a sludgy green concoction. She handed him the green one first. He gagged a little as he drank it, it was bitter and had a thick, gritty texture. The pink one was next, and he spluttered into a coughing fit. It burned going down and tasted like metal.
Potter snorted, before his shoulders started shaking with repressed laughter. The gleam in his eyes had Draco cursing himself internally. Potter did have a track record of being reckless and stupid after all.
They walked to the Great Hall in silence. He trotted along beside her, shortening his long strides to keep to her pace, and tried to contain his small internal panic about what this meant.
“Well, no. I’m assuming they are a muggle band? I’m not really familiar with a lot of muggle music.”
On Thursday evening they had taken a walk around the lake after dinner, and Luna had told him stories about her mother and her experiments with magic. She had written to her father to ask him to send some photographs, and she proudly showed them to Draco. Luna did look very similar to her mother, and Draco could see even more Malfoy resemblance in Pandora's face. She was softer than his father, and her eyes were wonderfully kind.
When the feast was over, McGonagall stood from her chair and stared around at the students with patient authority. It barely took a moment for a respectful hush to fall around the room, the students sitting to attention. Even Potter stopped flicking profiteroles at Finnigan.
“Ginny! What are you doing here?” she rushed out, looking down at Weasley and going a little bit pink.
“Don’t you remember? It was at some Ministry event. We must have been six or seven, all dressed up in our formal wear. The Lovegood’s were there. I only remember because Mr Lovegood got thrown out for accusing the Minister of some werewolf conspiracy cover up in front of everyone. You fell over when we were playing and skinned your knee. Pandora saw you fall and came to see if you were OK. She healed your graze and then she stole us both extra cake from the dessert table. Your mother came over though and dragged you off. I guess now we know why.”
“Finch-Fletchley asked me to join you two but only if that’s alright with you MacMillan? I’ll understand if you’d rather not.”
He stood over Potter to make sure he drank all the water, then he refilled the mug and put it beside the bed. Potter looked drowsy now. His blinks were slow, his eyes staying closed for longer periods of time.
“This is brilliant though Draco,” Justin continued, ignoring his embarrassment, “Harry doesn’t normally do dates. He must like you.”
“You’re so confusing Malfoy, walking around on your stupid long legs, with your stupid pretty hair and your stupid pretty eyes, being all nice to Luna, ergh...” Potter was muttering.
Time seemed to slow as Potter ground to a halt. Draco’s breathing was very loud in his own ears as Potter’s face went completely blank. The expression was even more terrifying than seeing his rage. His eyes sparked with a furious fire, and he turned slowly to face Howard, pulling free from Draco’s weak grip.
Blaise kicked him and drank. Draco snickered. Longbottom and Gryffindor Patil also drank, both of them blushing furiously. Finnigan and Thomas cracked up laughing.
By twelve forty-five he was outside the restaurant, dithering about whether he should go in and get a table, or stay outside.
“Why else would Potter take Finch-Fletchley into a toilet Pansy, really? He’s giving him private charisma lessons? Justin is a terrible bore, but he’ll drop to his knees for just about anyone. “
The atmosphere around him was bright, but inside him a dark storm raged. He still couldn’t decide if this had been a terrible idea, and he was fast approaching the moment of no return. His name had been cleared, and if he wanted any hope of a future he needed to complete his NEWTs, but he still knew that he was unwelcome here.
She spluttered as he started working, grinning over at the little incredulous noises she kept making through her nose. There wasn’t another chance to talk in the studious quiet of the classroom, without every single other person overhearing. He wished he could have caught her in Charms, which had been utter chaos, or Potions, but Potter was in both of those classes with them.
Howard’s expression was uncertain now, standing wandless against Potter, but he was still a big man. He didn’t look like he wanted to back down. A blue flash from Potter’s wand had Howard soaring backwards into a wooden pillar, which shuddered violently. Another flick of Potter’s wand, and Howard was jerked forwards and into the air by his feet, before he went crashing down to the floor.
