Harry: How can I be happy when your friend Pansy Parkinson invites herself to have lunch with me and asks me how she, and I'm quoting her here, "can satisfy Ginevra sexually"?
“I hope so. I want to go back home.” She sighed. “Merlin’s beard! I almost forgot! I have something for your boy.”
Harry: At this point, I laughed at her, obviously, but I quickly begged for forgiveness and told her how beautiful and perfect she is. I'm going to hire Goyle as a bodyguard anyway. I don't trust her.
“My name is Draco,” he said through clenched teeth.
4:09 pm
“And speaking of home, how are things with Dray?” Hermione said, and Harry guessed it was her attempt of cheering him up a little, as talking about the potion always made him sad.
“I booked a table at that Italian restaurant they opened in Kensington.” Harry hoped it had been a good idea.
“You’re not having fun here,” she smirked.
“Because I’ve always been very well behaved,” he said with dignity.
Muggle technology like phones are more usual than ever in the wizarding world, which helps me with what I have in mind. I ring the Auror’s Office.
Draco’s first instinct was to fly to Harry and tried to save him, but he knew he couldn’t make it on time. Without keeping his eyes off Harry, he picked up his wand and cast a spell to slow down his fall. But from so far, the spell didn’t work. Panicked, he tried to think of something else. There was a spell… He had only read about it, but he hoped his desperation was enough to make the spell work. He thought the words, and pointed his wand again. But again nothing happened.
Big, sunny, and countryside? A farm? But I don’t know why you of all people would be excited about a farm
“Fucking Harry Potter is what you wish you were doing,” Pansy muttered loud enough for Draco to hear.
“I really hope your friend is good at potions,” Sarah said with her usual chirpy tone.
“It says ‘frog’, you idiot!”
charm speeds it up. I leave driving a white car very different from mine.
“She’ll be fine, mate. Will she stay at St Mungo’s for it?”
Harry finally pulled away and smiled warmly at him.
“I’m home,” Draco said in a stronger voice than Harry expected. “When are you going to understand that I’m not with you anymore, that I live here now? You broke up with me. You told me to leave your flat. Deal with it and leave me the fuck alone.”
“How do you do it?” he asked. “I feel guilty just for being here, like I’m forgetting about him because I’m having fun at a party.”
Harry: The new
Harry: I bet you’d want me to live in a castle, in the middle of nowhere, dressed only in black, and be a dramatic sighing widower for the rest of my life. But according to Ron, you’d want me to be happy, and he’s sure he’s right.
“And what are you going to do with the little ferret tonight?” Ron asked, sprawled out on the sofa at his house.
I know it wasn’t Ron who called him. Ron’s in France with Hermione. It amuses me that Harry lies so badly. It’s “Yours” who called him. I’m sure. He goes to the garage and starts the car. He doesn’t like Apparating. I go out just after him and get into mine. I’m going to follow him wherever he goes. Just out of curiosity. I want to know who “Yours” is.
Harry: Apparently, she works in both the muggle and the wizarding worlds. Isn't that amazing?
“Alright?” Harry asks softly, while they’re waiting for a house elf to let them into the house.
Draco didn’t like the look in his eyes, not one bit. He couldn’t for the life of him say what the man was thinking, although judging by the set of his jaw and stiffness of his posture, it wasn’t anything particularly pleasant. It unnerved him, and so he murmured a quick ‘let’s go’ to Harry, who nodded, and, with renewed determination, Draco marched them down the hallway, not sparing another glance over his shoulder despite the undeniable sensation of Hayes’ eyes drilling into the back of his head.
Harry: Pansy brought a bow for Leo and another one for Cassie. They look ridiculous, like, honestly Draco, have you seen a duck with a ribbon around her neck? Pansy says they look cute and "don't be idiotic, Potter!" I told her what she could do with my middle finger and she said "gladly," so now I'm scared of her.
There was stunned silence for a moment, and Harry only realized then that all his friends were still there, watching their little exchange with wide-open mouths and incredulous eyes.
“Anyway,” Ron continued. “Malfoy may be an arrogant, smarmy little arsehole, but for some inexplicable reason, you and he
Draco glowered at them both. “Salazar, shut
Malfoy looked at him funny. But then he shook his head and asked, voice familiarly scathing, “Don’t tell me you want to go
Beside her, Weasley opened his mouth, looking properly spooked. No doubt to give some utterly moronic comment, because there was no filter in between the man’s brain and mouth.
“Has it appeared yet?” Seamus asked excitedly, peering across the table at Harry’s wrist, as though hoping to look through the sleeves of the green jumper hiding both his wrists from view.
. This was still Pansy Parkinson, the girl who’d have sold him out to Voldemort if given her way.
“They commissioned it,” Draco answered darkly. Harry glanced at his boyfriend, only to find his mouth set into a tight scowl.
want him.
And it was that chance, that tiny, slim possibility, that Draco promised himself he would fight for, because this was too important to give up on,
And that Harry Potter was actually an extremely fit bloke with extremely kissable lips.
Harry interrupted him with a mirthless laugh. “Of course you do? Of course? Just two days ago you hated my guts." He paused, eyes raking over Draco's face. Then, they hardened, and with them Harry's entire face. "And, honestly? Maybe that's just how it's supposed to be."
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
How this had happened, he didn’t know. The git had just left. And, alright, fine, he hadn’t actually
“Are you nearly done?” he called. “I promised Mother I’d be back by six, and it’s almost seven already.”
Draco almost winced at the sheer amount of
Ginevra made a sound in between a gasp and a growl. “I swear to Merlin, Malfoy, if you don’t shut up right this instant—”
Harry lifted his eyebrows, both taken aback and amused by the unexpected compliment. “Thanks. I just really like the work, I guess. After the war, I wasn’t sure whether becoming an Auror was the right idea for me anymore, but now I’m really glad I stuck with it. Might be a lot of work, but at the end of the day I can’t picture myself doing anything else.”
(Sorry.)
“Christ, this is too much,” Draco dimly noted Weasley grumble. “We’re literally right here. Do they realise we’re right here? I think they do.”
. It had that day in the study, and it did now, and all he could do was stand there and stare.
was a fact as well.
Harry wasn’t sure why he hadn’t noticed it before, but it was enough to make him worry. The man looked positively nauseous, for Christ’s sake.
Potter—no,
“No,” Yaxley said and had the nerve to laugh. It was more a wheeze than anything, but it still chased goosebumps up Draco’s arms. “I don’t suppose you do. But that doesn’t matter. You have it anyway. Although I fear it won’t do you any good.”
Tomorrow was Harry’s twentieth birthday, and he was absolutely dreading it.
The woman rested her chin on the back of her hand and regarded Harry, a large smirk still dancing across her bloodred lips. “All jokes aside, though, you couldn’t have kept us away if you’d tried. Golden Boy’s practically family now, isn’t he? And us Slytherins are nothing if not loyal to our family.”
“And that redhead? You’re dropping me for that redhead?” Michael’s eyes flashed with barely contained fury. “Don’t you have any respect left for yourself?”
“You could work in something else,” Harry tries.
But I don’t know any of this, because Harry doesn’t tell me anything.
He spent the next hour walking in circles in the flat, as his excitement didn’t allow him to do anything else. Finally, Harry arrived.
Harry: Remember her?
Harry: I'm taking the children to the vet tomorrow. Leo needs vaccines (that's a muggle thing I'm not explaining right now because my lunch break is ending, and I still have to eat my dessert: chocolate pudding).
Harry: If you did, I'm not forgiving you for not telling me. No wait. I'm not forgiving you for introducing Pansy Parkinson into my life.
“You’re mental,” Ron said, looking at Harry with his eyes open wide.
The next day Pansy had to beg Draco to have breakfast while the rest of their friends look in surprise, as Draco usually had a very good appetite.
Harry: You know the drill: Blaise, Goyle, firewhiskey. I hugged Goyle.
“Wait, but you aren’t his soulmate,” Theo said, then looked at Pince, and decided to sign instead of talking. “Him wanting you to be doesn’t fix anything, right?”
“And he’ll be sharing his flat with a Death Eater. We’re even,” Draco said, as he left the bedroom and went to close the deal with his new caretaker.
Harry: Psst! I think there's a conspiracy to stop my resolution of being happy.
Draco laughed. Everyone in their common room had heard Harry sang while he was in the shower and he thought nobody heard him. He was a terrible singer.
On Saturday, he woke up early and took a quick shower. Then, wearing just pants, he stared at his open wardrobe for something to wear. He wished that writing a note to Harry was an option in that moment, as his words always calmed him or made him laugh. At last, he chose something comfortable, as they would be going back and forth all day.
“Hey, everything alright with our dear supervisor?” she asked as she removed the clear liquid from the cauldron in front of her.
“I’m in a bad mood because an idiot almost made me choke,” Draco signed, glaring at Harry in what he hoped was a playful way.
“I don’t know,” he signed slowly. “It’s always different for me, but…” His fingers stumbled over the signs a bit. He wasn’t sure how much to tell Harry.
“I married the wrong woman in this family,” Harry says, admiration pouring out of his voice. “You’re my hero.”
You found what?
Harry laughed.
. He needs you.
“I said sorry!” Harry exclaimed, making puppy eyes that Draco knew he couldn’t resist. “Do you want to dance?”
Draco looked at his friends in anger. He had come here to tell them the good news he had heard, and they had destroyed his hopes with just a few words. Pansy had the decency of looking sorry about it at least. He picked up his homework, ink, and quill without looking at any of them, and left the library. He needed to be alone.
Harry: On a Saturday.
“I’m sorry. I have a potion that might help you with that.” He turned to her parents. “A friend of mine is a potions master, and he and one of his colleagues had investigated an improved Wolfsbane. It can make the pain go away during the transformation. The Ministry hasn’t approved it yet, but the hospital has. If you accept, Sarah will be the first person to try it.”
“Git,” Draco muttered. “Okay, what do you want for lunch? Fish and chips on the beach?” he asked when they left the shop.
Harry smiled, still nervous. He couldn’t believe he was having a proper date with Draco Malfoy, and he was scared of fucking it up in some stupid way.
“You what!?” Pansy and Greg screamed at the same time, making Draco laugh, and he told them everything about that delightful encounter in the bathroom.
“Yeah, it was because of you, oh mighty Saviour,” Draco said with sarcasm.
“How are you?” she asked.
I hang up before they can ask me anything else.
“Of course it was. You had my great help there!”
Draco coughed a bit more, and left his bottle carefully on the table before them.
“Fine,” Draco says, hugging her mother. “We had a busy week, but something great happened. Did you already tell them, Lily?”
Harry got up, wrapping Draco in an embrace and kissing him, then he made Draco stand so he could kneel in front of him. Draco shivered in anticipation.
“It’s 9 o’clock now. I’m not late, you fuckwit! If you want to come here insanely early, that is not my problem. And what’s that about my boyfriend? I haven’t had a boyfriend for months now.” He was doing an effort to not hex Martin.
OMG NO! Shut up!
“Don’t be ridiculous! The bed is big enough for the two of us, and it’s not like we aren’t used to sharing it, is it?” Draco said. He couldn’t be sure because it was dark, but he thought that Harry blushed.
“I’m going to sleep.”
“Of course.” By the noise he made, Harry had sat down on the toilet. “Love you too, idiot.”
The right side of the bed was even. That was it. The blankets weren’t piled up in weird ways, and the pillows were fluffy, as if no one had slept on them.
“In one of your notes, you said you liked Potions because you got to see your crush there, who was he?” Draco turned to look at him, feeling his cheeks blushing, and saw that the git was smiling kindly.
“Can you shut up for once in your life and listen to me?” Harry almost shouted, which shut Draco up immediately. He moved in front of Draco, and looked him in the eyes. “I want to do this right. I want them to understand what we have—”
“Let’s talk about the big news now,”  Pansy said some time later. “Potter.”
Harry: So I say I get to be as pitiful as I want to for at least four or five months more.
Harry: I also tried to teach Leo some tricks, but as I keep forgetting that he can't hear me, it's going slowly. Sometimes I remember, so now he knows that when I point to the door, it means we're going out and he runs excitedly around the living room.
“Why don’t you follow the Black family tradition of choosing stars and constellations as names?” Narcissa asked.
“It’s a young gentleman, I’m afraid,” Harry said. There was something about her that made him trust her with his secrets.  “We live together, you know. And I’m starting to really like him, but we have a history, a not so nice one at that, so...it’s complicated.”
Stuck to the last note:
“Exactly!” Greg said. “You’ve been living here for two months now and haven’t seen the man once. Why would that change now?”
“Yes, Michael has to stay for the clients, so…”
They stayed quiet after that, just enjoying each other’s company and the sounds of the forest. Draco took a deep breath, feeling lighter than he had felt lately, and thought that his father was right after all: they could always talk about the things that worried them to scare their worries away.
Harry: I have this month off, remember? That’s why I’m here. That and because…
“Do you want to eat something?” I ask him. “There’s pasta from yesterday, but I could make you something quick if you want.”
Draco went to work with a big smile the next day. He and Radwah had worked very hard to create the Wolfsbane Potion, and he still couldn’t believe that they had been able to do it. He was sure Harry’s patients were going to have a very easy full moon.
“Yes!” Harry gave him a one-arm hug, and kissed him on one cheek. Draco made himself comfortable on his boyfriend's chest, and sighed happily. “You’re wonderful. Don’t let your brain tell you otherwise.”
Harry: Of course you say nothing, you git
1:13 pm
“Yes, thank you. I’ll take the pasta.”
The three of them went to see those rooms. They were small too, but Draco loved them instantly. There was a big tub in the bathroom, and the bedroom was very luminous, with a window that occupied an entire wall.
Harry: I paired up with Ron for pictionary and I'm not doing that again. Look at this and tell me it isn't a dick!
Harry: It was game night. Sorry, I should have said that before.
“It’s nothing,” Draco signed. He had been worried out of his mind since the match. Weasley and Granger had gone to the Hospital Wing as soon as they allowed them to visit their friend, and had returned to the common room saying that Harry was well but unconscious. That morning it had been the same, so Draco was glad to find Harry awake and without consequences for the hit on the head. “Are you alright now, then?”
They went inside the flat, and while Draco went to the kitchen to put everything he had bought away, Harry sat on the living room armchair feeling very awkward.
Draco smiled and gave him a proper kiss on the mouth, happy that their relationship would be a secret no longer.
Harry: Don't worry, I made sure that Cassie and Leo were fed and loved. It was only me starving or eating unhealthy amounts of buns with chocolate chips. That's my grieving food
“Good.”
When he went to the bedroom, he let out a gasp. Why would someone have so many cushions? And what was he supposed to do with all of them? He couldn’t leave them on the bed or he’d have to sleep on the floor, and throwing them to the floor didn’t feel like a nice thing to do. In the end, he put them at one side, under the soft blanket Dray had left on the bed, and went to sleep.
“Do it.” Sarah looked at her mother and Harry with hopeful, big eyes. “Mom, please. It hurts a lot.”
“No, but —”
5:43 am
“And when you get tired of me and throw me out?” The vulnerability in Draco’s expression hurts Harry.
Harry: Do you know what this made me think of? Of how scared I am. I’m scared that the people I love will get hurt, that something very bad will happen to them, and I'll lose them like I’ve lost so many people already. I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want to wake up one day to the news that Ron or Hermione are dead. Because if that happens… if that happens, Draco, I’m not sure I can go on. I will have no one then.
“Like your sexy lullaby singer?”
“I just saw Harry Potter naked, so yes, I’m very good.”
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Theo asked.
He moved a bit on the sofa where he was laying, with his legs on Harry’s lap and his head on a pile of cushions, but he was still uncomfortable. It didn’t help that his usual slim body had changed to imitate that of a whale.
“Exactly.”
Pansy and Draco sniggered. Radwah joined them moments after, and the four of them spent a nice time talking about Pansy’s problems buying from a fashion magazine, criticising Martin, and joking about Greg’s coworkers.
“Of course. But… Draco, is there any problem with your soulmate? Is that why you’ve been so sad these days?” Harry asked, concern in his voice.
“Are you alright?” she asked, serving them big portions of scrambled eggs.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “I think so too.” He took a sip of his pumpkin juice, and after a few minutes of silence he spoke again. “I’m meeting Harry this Saturday.”
“Say what?” Harry asked, although he didn’t fool Draco; he knew all too well what he was talking about.
“I did magic!” Lily screams. “I made Dad’s quills fly!”
Harry hadn’t seen Draco since after the trials, and then he had looked like a scrawny, scared child. The Draco he was seeing now looked nothing like that. He was thin too, but in a healthy way. His skin was very pale, and Harry caught himself wishing to touch it to see if it was as smooth as it looked. His platinum hair was in disarray; he had probably just gotten out of bed. His grey eyes were bright and had dark circles under them. Tiny freckles were scattered on his shoulders, and thin, almost invisible, scars crossed his chest. He had a mole next to his left nipple.
10:45 pm
“I’m not going to-” Harry begins but it’s cut off by Draco’s bitter laughter.
When Draco nodded, still feeling like or either Harry wasn’t as well as he wanted him to believe or either he was missing something only Harry knew, Harry tore apart the last copy of The Daily Prophet and pushed it towards him. Draco picked a quill from Harry’s bedside table and began to write the words feeling Harry’s gaze on him.
Draco was about to answer when the door opened and Martin entered, glaring at them.
I firecall Harry at work. We should rid his work desk of evidence, too. And hers. Michael, another of his coworkers, answers my call and tells me that Harry isn’t there. I roll my eyes at his incompetence. I have to do everything myself, then. I get the rubber gloves we have in the kitchen, put them in my bag, and then step through the floo.
“Are you alright, dear?” Mrs. Williams asked with concern. “Oh! There’s a young lady, isn’t there? And you think she doesn’t like you.”
On the living room table, next to the last note:
Ron laughed again, and Harry ignored him. In just an hour he’d be having a date with Draco. Ron could laugh all he wanted, but Harry was happy. He had been very anxious after leaving the note asking Draco out, as he hadn’t known if he had made his intentions clear. And as it turned out he hadn’t. Thankfully, Pansy Parkinson of all people had left a note in the living room asking about it, so he had written another for Draco, this time without space for doubts. He couldn’t help but smile like an idiot.
“We’ll find a way,” she whispered against his ear, so she didn’t see how Draco rolled his eyes at her optimism.
Harry: Of course you know. I bet you're smirking now and raising an eyebrow at me. Well, I didn't know it but I'm ready now!
“I’m—.” His fingers didn’t respond to him. They were shaking, and it didn’t help that his brain didn’t know what to say either. “I can’t be—.”
, Draco thought. With a sigh, he got up and closed his eyes. Harry was the last person he could tell his problems to. The idiot would feel guilty and go out with him or something.
too,” Harry whispered against his ear.
Theo and Blaise tried to talk to him too —he guessed they felt guilty for ruining his good mood and hopes— but as he did with anyone else, he ignored them. Ignoring Harry proved to be a little harder, but all he had to do was think about how undeserving of Harry’s love and affection he was so it was easy to push him away. He even stopped going to the quidditch trainings, which earned him a long telling-off with Weasley that forced him to return if only to not hear Weasley’s scolding again.
“That’s for me? Thanks so much!” It always made him happy when his patients gave him small presents. He felt like he was doing something good, even if he couldn’t heal them, if they felt the need to thank him with gifts. Except for Mr. Robinson, of course.
Draco shook his head. All his classmates had learned with Harry, so maybe he could learn from him too.
“I knew it,” Harry whispered, with his eyes shining. “I knew it. You’re the sexy lullaby singer!”
Harry: I apologised to Ron by the way. He and Hermione came with me to an animal shelter and we all fell in love with Cassie, and with… roll drum, please…
“Harry…” I begin to say, but he speaks, so I fall silent.
So hot! I’ve always liked people touching my pine
“But?” he prompted, and Draco knew he couldn’t resist those bright, curious eyes.
No way I’m going with you. You can go and fuck yourself.
“Mother is old and doesn’t remember things very well. Shall we sit down?” She takes her seat at the table quickly, and the rest follow soon after.
He couldn’t believe he was finally getting his own place!
Lily and Scorpius giggle, Harry sticks his tongue out to her, and even her parents smile. Without the children noticing, as they’re still laughing, she gives Harry the finger.
“Wasn’t I before, Mr Potter?” Narcissa purrs. “I saved your life.”
Harry: MOFNING! ***
“For you, idiot,” he signed.
Michael looked intently at him, and Draco felt himself break into a million tiny pieces. This had happened before. Lots of times. Michael reminded Draco of how useless he was, and Draco broke a little and agreed with him. Michael cupped Draco’s face over the table, and he stayed still, afraid of moving and fearing what Michael was about to do. He didn’t want to be with him. He didn’t want Michael to kiss him. However, he seemed unable to move, and so Michael’s lips captured his for what felt like an eternity.
6:00 pm
Harry took his hand, and tightened a bit in a comforting gesture. Draco disentangled their hands so he could sign his answer.
Draco groaned.
“I know!” His signs were wide and quick, and his mouth was twisted in a grim. “I know! But everyone in our class did it, but me! I’m smart! I know I can do it!”
“That man is…” Greg left the sentence unfinished and made his knuckles crack. He looked at the floor and his brow furrowed. “What’s this?” He had picked a note from the floor. “It says: ‘Sorry I didn’t do the dishes this morning, I’ll clean everything when I’m back from work. James’.”
On the kitchen counter:
“Thanks. So you didn’t tell me the details about how the potion worked.”
“Haven’t you gone to look for some book?” Blaise asked as soon as Draco sat in front of him.
Harry: AH! Such a nice day! Of course I missed you, and I wish we had the Christmas we had planned, but this was okay too. I didn’t feel very sad, and could enjoy this and the people around me. Although at one point, I had to drag Ron to his room to cry and be hugged.
Harry: I think I need to visit Goyle for a hug.
“You know I don’t drink alcohol,” Radwah said, weighting some frog brains.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realise…” Harry said in a soft voice, and tightened his one arm hug.
Harry: Good morning, Draco, light of my life and pain in my arse.
10:45 am
4:12 am
“Dray. It’s… weird,” Harry answered honestly.
He woke up late the next morning. He had slept with his clothes on, so he took them off and went hurriedly to the bathroom for a quick shower to clear his mind. He realised too late that he wasn’t alone in the bathroom.
“Of course not!” The thought made Harry blush furiously. Draco would laugh at him.
“He lost his mother when he was four years old, and seven years later he lost his father, and got stuck with a stranger, what do you think?”
This is all I have to say today.
“Hey! Are you trying to learn your own essay by heart or something?” Harry asked as he sat next to him on the floor.
“Of course not. I didn’t see him those last weeks, and living here was kind of a last moment decision.”
“No. It’s because I…”
Thank you.
Harry resisted the urge to take a step backwards, as he didn't want the man to enter his flat. He stayed in his place, blocking the door.
“Mine?” he asked, panic rising from his belly, and making its place somewhere in his throat. He tried to swallow it, but it stayed there. “It’s… a boy.”
Harry: This morning I took him and Cassie to Ron and Hermione's house, and Rose played with them. She's a bit scared of Cassie, but she giggled like mad when Hermione helped her pet her.
Harry: A woman called because she found traces of dark magic in her house. Astoria and I went there, and found that the woman was right. While we were talking to her and her husband about it, two witches and a wizard entered, casting curses and hexes at us. We defended ourselves, and put them down, but the husband was badly hurt. The woman had a breakdown, and guess who was unable to help her and instead just hugged her and cried with her?
Harry: You’d know what to say now. Please. Send me a sign or something. Don’t you have anything written somewhere about this? We’ve talked about it, but never like this. I’m an idiot. I shouldn’t have waited this much. How am I going to understand myself if you’re not beside me to call me an idiot or to recommend the right books?
“Being able to hit Bludgers at people is a great stress release,” she said breezily.
Harry shrugged. “I've got my dad's Cloak, and we're not supposed to get into the Slytherin girls' dorms either, but I did that a few weeks ago.”
“Very well. Oh, and Mr Potter, give this to Flint when you see him,” Snape said, and handed over a piece of parchment. “Good night.”
“We only had breakfast an hour ago,” Draco said.
“Nothing of the sort,” Narcissa replied. “I don't have long. My husband's going on trial for attempted murder, you see, and I have much to do.”
“Perhaps your standards are too high, Severus,” McGonagall said with a slight smile.
“Well, well, well – Arthur Weasley.” Mr Malfoy had finally arrived, and was standing with his hand on Draco's shoulder.
Harry stood up quickly. “No!” When she said nothing, he looked at his feet and continued. “Not really. It's just... I'll miss this place.”
Harry stared at Draco. “You can hear it too?”
“Only you'd get that excited over apples,” Harry laughed. “Have you opened everything yet?”
“You can practise on my trunk, if you like,” Tracey said.
“So have the attacks stopped, then?” Mr Malfoy asked. “Have you caught the culprit yet?”
“What's all this?” Harry asked.
“Yes, sir,” Blaise said, trying to suppress a smirk.
“Hey!”
“Learning about my family from library books,” Harry said, then looked down. “I much preferred hearing about Mum from you.”
Gemma made a face. “Don't remind me of him, please. It's far too early to think about him.”
“I didn't mean to upset you,” Harry said awkwardly. “Let's start over. I'm Harry, and this is Draco. What's your name?”
McGonagall gave Snape a small frown. “Surely you haven't given the boy detention on Boxing Day, Severus?”
“I, er, yes, Narcissa,” Harry said, pleased.
“Weren't you the one who told me to ask for help instead of blundering in on my own?” Harry asked with a grin.
“How?” Theo asked.
“No. I can prove it, if you like,” Harry offered.
“If you're going to make such a fuss, I'll go back to wearing my old clothes,” Harry teased her.
“Pansy's planning to poison Lockhart and Daphne,” Harry replied.
He disappeared inside the shed, emerging a minute later clutching his broomstick and a small trunk. “Ready to lose?”
“I'm giving him extra lessons in Potions, Minerva. But yes, if he deserved it I'd have no qualms about assigning him detention tomorrow.”
“Of course,” gasped Draco.
“Not really. Just, you know, I'll say hello to them if they sound nice,” Harry said, blushing.
“Tomorrow, that's soon,” Draco said quietly.
Harry stared at him for a few seconds before shaking his head. “I'm sorry, what?
Harry looked around him as they waited. Mrs Malfoy's study was a bright, spacious room decorated in white wooden furniture and dark green fabrics. The large windows were opened to let in the summer breeze, and Harry made his way over to them to look out. Draco followed him.
Draco gave a weak smile, and Snape snorted. “Perhaps I'll take to possessing you each time you've a Potions essay to write.”
Draco looked uncharacteristically unsure of himself, which Harry found oddly endearing. “I was hoping you could teach me.”
Herbology lessons with the Ravenclaws had gone back to normal. Harry and Draco were once again sharing a table with Padma and Morag. Not only had they apologised for thinking that Harry and Draco had been responsible for the attacks, but Daphne wanted to share a table with Stephen Cornfoot. The four of them spent their lessons watching Daphne and Stephen flirt with each other as Tracey and Anthony Goldstein tried in vain to get them to pay attention to their work station.
“A signed photo? You want a
“For fuck's sake!” Flint strode forward and grabbed them, pulling them to the front of the crowd. “You can't bet on yourselves, obviously, but you can place a bet on anyone else you like. Or, you know, tell us if it's one of you.”
“Hear what?”
One of the curtains was yanked back. “I heard. Want to join me?”
Dobby spun around and looked at Harry with a guilty look. “Harry Potter! Can Dobby do anything for Harry Potter? Maybe send his mail for him?”
“Can you hear that?” he hissed.
“Possession of a cursed object, knowingly giving a cursed object to a minor, and attempted murder,” Draco said quietly.
“It won't come,” Tom said in amusement. “I have to call it, and I don't want it killing you when I need to feed off your energy.”
Snape closed his eyes briefly then shook his head. He levitated the mirror in front of the basilisk's face. “Tell it to open its eyes.”
“Budge over,” Harry said before climbing in. Draco pulled the curtain shut again and they sat in silence for a few minutes. “Thanks for earlier.”
“Precisely.”
“Malfoy!” Harry glared at him before turning to Hermione. “Just one voice, actually.”
,” he said in a friendly tone.
“Oh, no. Master Draco doesn't know Dobby is here, sir. Dobby will have to punish himself when he returns home for coming here.”
Harry shook some of the water off the diary and looked back at Myrtle. “Do you mind if I take it?”
“I told you, my name is
“I'm sorry, did you just say that my education in Muggle music is revenge-based?” Draco asked.
“Harry!” Theo yelled, and made to come closer.
Gemma glanced over at the other table. “Maybe I could swap with her. I've never been at an all ginger table before.”
“What's wrong with that one?” Harry asked, perplexed.
Theo's head jerked up. “Can you teach me too?”
Theo looked over. “I'll come too, I was planning on trying out.”
Harry paused; that felt like a trick question. “I wouldn't say that,” he said carefully.
********
Flint frowned at them before heading over to Hooch, where they watched him gesticulating angrily at her.
“Sir?”
Harry looked at him sideways. “Er, wouldn't that make you a blood traitor? Because of Hermione?”
The boys straightened up and followed him silently. When they stepped into the bright August sunshine, Harry swore mentally. Draco had all but forced him to wear his robes today, saying that his father wouldn't be pleased if either of them tried to go to Diagon Alley in Muggle clothing. Harry really didn't want to argue with Mr Malfoy, but he couldn't help feeling resentful as he followed him down the drive. As much as he liked his new robes, they were definitely not as suited for the summer heat as jeans and a t-shirt were.
“Dumbledore's already told me I've got 'is trust,” Hagrid said. Draco pursed his lips but said nothing as he turned his attention back to Fang.
“We're here,” Harry said quietly.
“Tom?” Harry gaped at him.
“Thanks,” Theo said, not looking up from his book.
Draco told you to punish yourself?”
“I really wasn't –”
Snape took a long drink before speaking again. “Boxing Day.”
Tom smiled. “I'm glad you asked me that. A basilisk. You've no idea how much easier it was to set it on Mudbloods through you, a natural Parselmouth, than the girl.”
,” she said angrily.
Dumbledore smiled gently at him. “Yes, apart from that.”
Harry thought he had a point. The pixies were less than a foot high and a bright blue. They were hovering in their cage, held up by wings similar to a dragonfly's, and pulling faces at the class.
“Thanks. Come on, we should get going.”
Hermione looked at him. “You know what they're like about Neville and I being friends with you. How do you think they're going to react when two Slytherins are found next to a Petrified cat?”
She opened a box on her bedside table and rummaged through it, before dumping a mess of pins in his hands.
A quiet beeping interrupted his thoughts. Rolling over, he quickly turned off his alarm clock.
“I guess,” Draco said, clearly unconvinced.
“Do you find that funny, Mr Potter?”
“We heard you speaking Parseltongue, we don't know what you said,” Susan replied.
Snape narrowed his eyes. “I did not brew the swill you had to drink last month. That was a commercial brand that somehow got left in the infirmary's stock despite its inferior quality. Can you tell me what was wrong with it?”
Daphne studied it. “Give me a second.”
Harry studied the elf through narrowed eyes. “No, I'm good thanks. What were you doing with Hedwig?”
********
Ginny shrugged. “It's okay. It's good to talk to someone else who knows what it was like. These two have been treating me like I'm made of glass.”
“Beater.”
Harry shrugged. “It wasn't your fault, it was your dad and Mr Weasley.”
“Jealous of a little attention, are you?” Draco sneered back. “Must be hard, having so many siblings. I bet mummy and daddy just forget all about you.”
Harry let out a groan and went to leave, before whirling back around. “You know, I just realised why none of you were sorted into Ravenclaw. You're all bloody idiots.” Ernie opened his mouth to argue back, but Harry raised his voice. “Yeah, I made Voldemort disappear somehow. I don't know how, because I was a fucking
Dumbledore's only answer was to open the back of the camera. Steam poured out of it and even on the other side of the room, Harry caught the sharp stench of burnt plastic.
“How?”
“Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time!” Lockhart paused as he smiled at everyone. Harry stared at his mouth; he'd never seen someone show that many teeth before. It was blinding.
“Aha! I knew she'd remember!” When Harry looked up at Draco's exclamation, he held up a box of green apples. “From the orchard at home. Mother always saves the last of them for me.”
“Really? But isn't that a third year potion?”
“For Harry Potter's arm, sir. Dobby was hoping that if Harry Potter was injured, he would leave Hogwarts. Dobby didn't think that Harry Potter would get his arm fixed,” the elf frowned even as a tear ran down his cheek.
Dobby wrung the hem of his pillowcase. “Dobby can't say, sir. Dobby just wants Harry Potter to be safe, and Hogwarts won't be safe for Harry Potter this year.”
Harry gaped after him before looking at Blaise in confusion. “What did I say?”
“Morning,” Draco replied. He waited silently for Harry to finish getting ready, before they set off for breakfast.
“You've got new players? Who?” Wood demanded. The rest of his team landed behind him.
, he thought, as he listened to Draco reel off another incomprehensible name. He greatly enjoyed his first taste of wine, though.
“Congratulations on the worst Valentine ever, but he's not interested,” he snarled at the Weasley girl. Her face flushed as red as her hair and she ran off into a classroom.
Harry could feel Draco fuming as they made their way back to the castle. “What's wrong? I thought that went well, considering.”
Snape's upper lip curled as his glare intensified. Harry looked at Lockhart and wondered how he could be so oblivious that he'd remain smiling when Snape was looking at him like that.
Harry read his quiz and looked up at Lockhart in disbelief. Every single question contained Lockhart's full name. What was worse, Harry actually knew some of the answers from reading the books. In a decidedly bad mood now, Harry answered what he did know, then left nonsense answers for the others. Hopefully Lockhart didn't know much about the Muggle world.
“Yes, sir.”
Myrtle narrowed her eyes. “What was that?”
“Does this mean that McGonagall's headmistress now?” Tracey asked.
“Next time we'll try Ravenclaw,” muttered Draco as he opened his letter. “And don't patronise me.”
“Just a second.
“Hi. Can I talk to you please?” Harry asked.
“I know! Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!” Lockhart said.
“You're letting them out?” Theo said in disbelief. Beside him, Tracey started shoving her possessions into her bag. Harry nudged Draco, and they started doing the same.
“Yes, thank you.”
Harry had just pulled a black jumper over his head when there was a soft knock on the door. He opened it to find Mrs Malfoy smiling down at him. Her smile widened when she saw his outfit.
“We were on our way to Gringotts to get Harry's money.”
“Right, well, nice meeting you then,” Harry said. Back out in the corridor, he glanced at Draco. “Why would someone throw away a diary like that?”
Draco nodded and signalled to someone Harry couldn't see, when the crowd parted and Harry caught a glimpse of lavender robes.
Harry shifted awkwardly, before sticking out his hand. “Thank you for having me, Mrs Malfoy.”
“Glad you enjoyed that,” Harry muttered.
Draco stared after him for a second before returning to his seat. “So what did you just say? I think I recognised half of it.”
, Harry told himself in his room.
Harry frowned at his feet as he tried to process this. Trust Hermione to make something so unexpected seem perfectly rational.
“I just assumed that was normal if a student was in danger. Aren't Aurors like the police?”
“What?” Harry asked.
“Ah.” Dumbledore studied him in silence for a minute. “Well, Harry, there isn't anything we can do about that.”
“Doing what, exactly?” Draco demanded, sitting up abruptly.
Hagrid looked at Draco for a moment before jerking his head in a short nod and picking up the kettle. They seated themselves at the table as Hagrid busied himself serving the tea.
.” Ollie raised his head.
“I still can't believe that it opens for Parseltongue like that.”
“And all of Lockhart's possessions should be sinking beneath the surface of the Black Lake as we speak,” Draco said smugly.
Harry shook his head.
Snape ignored him and knelt down next to Harry, handing him his wand. “Are you alright?”
“More important than regrowing an arm's worth of bones?” Harry looked at him sceptically.
When the students remained where they were, Snape barked at them. “Detention for anyone still here in thirty seconds!”
Harry shrugged. “Must've remembered we have detention with Lockhart tonight.”
“The woolly bear caterpillars need to be sliced, Mr Potter, unless you wish for the potion to become a powerful depilatory,” Snape said as he moved about the room.
“What is that underneath it?” Draco whispered.
Harry's mind was whirling. “What made you change your mind?” he asked Snape.
“What, the Chamber of Secrets being opened?” Harry shrugged. “Nothing's happened since Mrs Norris got Petrified, and she's just a cat. I'll be fine.”
Draco walked in slowly and sat next to him. “I'm sorry about earlier,” he offered.
Harry saw Ron open his mouth and quickly shouted “
Harry looked at Draco in alarm before replying. “Someone threw something at you? Are you hurt? We can help you to the hospital wing if you – oh,” he trailed off as a ghost emerged from one of the toilet stalls. She looked like she was only a little older than them, and dressed in an old Ravenclaw uniform.
Flint gestured to Draco and Theo. “So if you'd kindly fuck off now...”
Harry shifted nervously and glanced at Draco, who raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly at Snape.
“Oh, so you are aware of what the Dark Lord was like? Did your sister perhaps tell you tales of the atrocities he and his followers committed? The nephew you have had locked in his room is the only reason that the Dark Lord wasn't resurrected two months ago.” Mrs Malfoy sighed. “I had hoped to appeal to your sense of decency or, failing that, to talk to you as rational human beings. I can see that neither is an option, so let me resort to a cruder method. Harry will be staying with us for the remainder of the summer, and will then spend the rest of the year at Hogwarts. He will then return to King's Cross Station at the end of the school year. You will be there to pick him up. You will bring him back home for the summer. He will be allowed to sleep in his bedroom upstairs, and fed adequately. He will not be kept prisoner, and nor will his owl. You will not lock up his possessions where he can't access them. And you will treat him civilly for the summer. He will be allowed to correspond with his friends. And then you will take him to King's Cross Station when it is time for him to return to school.”
“I'm going to go talk to that Hufflepuff from last night. Tell him I told the snake not to attack him.”
Snape was silent for a minute. “I shall ask Madam Pince if she knows anything of Miss Granger's activities. By which I mean
Snape smirked. “It may have been a contributing factor.”
Harry craned his neck to see which one it was. It was one he'd drawn last week, showing Draco and his mother playing chess in front of the fire. It was one of his best so far, and he was rather fond of it himself.
Harry stared at it. After a few seconds, it closed again. “
“What is it?” Harry asked.
“Well, when Blaise tried to get in last year he got thrown out before he took two steps down the corridor,” Pansy giggled.
They stood there panting. “There's nothing here,” said Draco finally.
“Or what about Hagrid?” Draco added. “Maybe the Dark Lord's attacking unicorns again?”
Harry watched him for a second, wondering just how one person could get so many things. His thoughts were interrupted by Hedwig flying into the room with a small envelope clutched in her beak.
“Dobby cannot say, sir! Harry Potter must leave Hogwarts and never return!”
Harry frowned. “Er, well, since I was a baby, I guess, up until I got the spare bedroom upstairs when the Hogwarts letters started arriving.”
“Sounds pretty good to me,” Draco whispered.
Harry and Millicent nodded, but Draco shook his head.
. I mean, I didn't even know I could speak it until you pointed it out to me. So... I'll try, but don't get your hopes up. I've never taught anyone before, I'll probably be pants at it.”
“No, please, they'll kill me,” Harry whispered.
Dobby shook his head furiously. “Harry Potter is not needing to do that, sir. Dobby was – was just talking to Harry Potter's owl, sir. Dobby was trying to persuade her that she shouldn't take any mail for Harry Potter, sir. But Harry Potter's owl is too loyal to Harry Potter, and wouldn't listen to Dobby.”
Harry looked around them, but the only person he could see was Snape.
Harry groaned. “It's hard enough teaching Draco. Besides, I'm always telling you and Tracey about Muggle stuff.”
They followed him silently up to the first floor, where he took them to the hospital wing. He stopped them outside the door.
Business done, Ainsley escorted them back into the Muggle store in front, before bowing them onto the street.
“As long as we talk to Hermione,” Draco said at once.
The boy let out a cold laugh. “Not physically, no. But we have been corresponding for months now.”
“Sounds good.”
Tracey nodded. “And what about people who are doing their OWLs and NEWTs this year?”
“Er... No.”
. A cold shiver swept over Harry as he stared at the glowing letters.
“Funnily enough, Lucius, after word got out that Harry Potter had been taken into the Chamber of Secrets, I received somewhat of a deluge of letters from the other school governors. It seems they felt I should be reinstated at once. Some of them mentioned that they'd never wanted me gone in the first place. Rather dramatic tales they told me, too, of blackmail and threats.”
“And what does this have to do with us?” Draco asked.
” Harry shouted. When the basilisk hesitated, he added, “
“I left it at home,” she pouted, “and all the copies in the library are already out.”
“Oh, no!” Hermione wailed.
“Professor!” Harry stared at his teacher in shock. Along with his own and Harry's wands, he was carrying a large mirror.
“Yes.”
Draco grinned and launched into a detailed explanation of exactly what a Malfoy bonfire consisted of as Harry sat back in satisfaction. Shopping was marvellous.
Harry shook  his head and immediately winced. “I don't think we've met.”
********
Draco elbowed him and pointed down the corridor. “What's that?”
“You certainly took your time,” Draco grumbled.
Snape gazed at him intently before looking at Draco. “And did you hear this voice as well?”
Harry skipped dinner, choosing to ensconce himself on his bed with the curtains drawn and the last of Hagrid's fudge. He upended his schoolbag onto his bed and picked up the diary. As distracted as he'd been by Hermione's revelation, he hadn't realised what had been bugging him about the diary, but now it was obvious. Unlike the rest of his books, which had been covered in ink, the diary was ink free. Harry frowned. The diary had been with his other books; there was no way the ink could have missed it.
Then an owl swooped in through the open window, deposited a letter on Mrs Mason's head and flew back out. The Masons left in a barrage of shouting and screaming, and Harry carefully positioned his mop and bucket between himself and the Dursleys. It wasn't much, but it made him feel marginally safer as Uncle Vernon advanced on him.
Snape pursed his lips. “And neither of you saw anyone suspicious?”
Gemma looked at him askance before looking back at the teachers. “It feels wrong not to be betting on McGonagall this year... She's so uptight, she's got to crack sometime.”
“Funny you should mention Draco's father. Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team,” Flint smirked and held out his broom. Harry looked around and held his out too when he saw the others copying Flint.
When Harry turned around he found Dobby staring at him, and sighed. “How about we make a deal, alright?”
Harry held out his arm in silence. Snape took hold of his wrist and checked his pulse before releasing it. “Follow my finger without blinking,” he ordered. Harry watched as Snape moved his finger from side to side in front of his face.
After half an hour Lockhart collected the tests and scanned them quickly. “Nothing outstanding, although you certainly did better than the Gryffindors... Only one of them did any well at all... Let's see here, yes, full marks to Miss Davis, Mr Nott and Miss Greengrass! Ten points each for Slytherin!”
“And do you spend a lot of time with strange snakes?” Mr Malfoy asked.
“You sure?” Draco asked, even as he moved his first piece.
Mr Malfoy returned the embrace, then looked at Harry. “I trust you've enjoyed your stay at Malfoy Manor.”
Colin produced a camera from his bag. “I've heard all about you, how you defeated You-Know-Who when you were a baby, and I was hoping I could get a photo with you, to prove that I met you. A boy in my dorm told me that if I develop the film in a special potion, the picture will
Tom twirled Harry's wand thoughtfully. “Blood magic. Of course. That gave you a powerful protection. Too bad it won't save you now.”
“Er, okay.” Harry had never given much thought to what colours suited him. He was mostly happy when Dudley's hand downs were only six sizes too big instead of ten.
When Draco shook his head, Mr Malfoy grabbed them both by the arm and Disapparated them back to the manor. He strode off up the drive muttering to himself, leaving the boys to carry their books behind him.
Hagrid frowned slightly. “Yeh look serious.”
Flitwick ignored his two colleagues and beamed at Harry. “It's so nice to see students interested in learning. You must have a flair for Potions for Professor Snape to spend extra time with you. It's not something he does often.”
Harry quickly grabbed the Walkman and biscuit tin from under the floorboard, then gathered up his drawing supplies from his bedside table. “Everything else is in my cupboard under the stairs,” he said awkwardly.
“Ah, the rewards of being a disgrace to the name of wizard,” Mr Malfoy said, as he flipped through the book disdainfully.
Aunt Petunia let out a small gasp.
Harry and Draco were laughing when Hermione and Neville entered and sat down next to Pansy.
“But... No, he can't.”
“Some of us like to study throughout the year, thank you very much,” she replied.
“No. We got to the Entrance Hall and saw the feast was nearly finished, so we decided to go up to the Astronomy Tower for a bit, and get food from the kitchens later,” Draco explained. Harry quickly nodded.
“Because it makes me sound crazy!”
“I'm getting to that,” Pansy cut in.
Harry awoke on Friday in a good mood. Both Draco and Theo had gotten onto the Quidditch team the night before, he'd enjoyed the classes he'd had so far, and not even the sight of the remaining newspaper clippings on the walls could bring his mood down.
Harry looked up to find Hagrid standing over him. “Hi, Hagrid,” he said as he stood up.
“Thank you, Professor.”
The crowd turned as one to look at Harry, and Lockhart himself lunged forward and dragged him to the front, making him drop his pile of books. Harry looked out into the crowd, and saw a group of people with red hair.
“So that's why you came to me at Christmas time,” he said quietly.
“Pardon?”
Draco shuddered lightly. “She'd probably send you a howler.”
Harry put the letter down and checked the time. Eleven o'clock was more than enough of a sleep in for Draco, he decided, and headed next door and knocked. He waited a few seconds before knocking again, then opened the door.
Harry shot Draco a look as he sat down. “
Draco picked one up and threw it down again, pouting. “These are real dragon leather.”
,” Harry said.
“Which is enough to make anyone start hearing things,” Draco added.
He paced the room and tried to take stock of what he had. An owl, paper and pencils, but no way to get her out to get help. A few old novels he'd already read that summer. Some of Dudley's old broken toys. That was it.
“No! I can see the Snitch!” Harry ground out, and yanked his broom down with his left arm. Cradling his right arm towards his body he dove after the Snitch. Luckily the Gryffindor Seeker hadn't seen it, as Harry didn't think he could handle a race for the Snitch with a broken arm.
“Er, no.”
Dobby was shaking, but he nodded quickly. “Dobby is unhurt, Master Draco.”
********
“I can try,” Harry said stubbornly. “Snape called him Finch-Fletchley.”
Dumbledore looked at McGonagall. “Minerva, please fetch Miss Weasley and take her to the hospital wing to get checked out, then inform her parents. And then, if you would be so kind, alert the elves that we will be having a celebratory feast in, oh, an hour's time.”
Dobby shook his head, making his ears flap. “No, Harry Potter is in danger. Dobby just wants Harry Potter to be safe. When Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, life improved for house elves. Dobby is still treated like vermin by Master, of course, but mostly, things improved for house elves when the Dark Lord fell. And now that the Chamber of Secrets is open again – ”
As soon as Harry knocked on the door Fang started his usual wild barking, and Draco's expression relaxed slightly. Hagrid opened the door with one hand holding back Fang by his collar. “Hullo you two. Want a cuppa?”
“Sounds good,” Harry agreed.
The Gryffindor captain landed and strode towards them. “Flint! This is our practise time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!”
“Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?” one of the Weasley twins asked Draco.
“We should go,” Draco whispered.
“That's it? We just need to answer a riddle? That's not very secure, they must have something unpleasant for anyone who gets it wrong,” Draco mused.
Snape nodded. “The diary has been destroyed, so you should now be regaining all that Riddle siphoned from you.”
“Back in a sec,” he muttered, slipping out of the compartment. “Ginny!”
“It would be incredibly boring for you. The only reason you could possibly have to take that class would be to get easy marks,” Draco said dismissively. Pansy nodded her agreement.
Harry woke early the next morning after a fitful sleep. He'd returned to the common room to find that he was the clear favourite in the betting pool, and had half of Slytherin coming up to either thank him or swear at him. He'd retreated to his dorm, only to find Draco cornered by Theo and Blaise, who were angry he hadn't told them about Harry being a Parselmouth. They'd turned their attention to Harry, and it took a while before he could placate them enough to escape to bed.
“We thought you'd be back quick enough to lock the cage,” Draco said innocently.
“Master Draco is wanting you to join him in his room, sir,” squeaked the elf.
“Everything all right, Ginny?” one of them asked.
Neville looked at him nervously. “I think you should ask Hermione. Sorry.”
“It's not really about the teachers winning anything,” Gemma said, but they didn't listen.
********
********
McGonagall gave them a disbelieving look but didn't say anything, merely looked over their heads at Snape and then at Dumbledore.
“And now you're even, is that it?”
“Finally, I've been getting some weird looks from Percy,” Hermione said to Draco's left shoulder.
“That's one way. You can also Apparate here, but you have to be quick, as there's naturally a lot of traffic,” Mrs Malfoy replied.
“You really need to learn that spell, Potter.
“What, and ask him if he's fallen back into his old habits of setting killer monsters loose in the school?”
“We put them all back in the cage, like he asked us to,” Draco said blandly.
, it said. Harry stared at it as his anger came back.
“Muggles use sniffer dogs to great success,” said the taller of the red-robed men calmly.
An owl fluttered out of the window above their heads, and Mrs Malfoy came up behind them. “Sorry about that, but that woman gets ever so impatient if I don't respond quickly... Now, are you ready to go?”
“What did you think we would do, leave you to starve to death?” Draco asked.
“I feel like shit,” Harry said.
“Excellent work, Mr Potter! Ten points to Slytherin! Now, how about something a bit more interesting?” Lockhart smiled at the crowd before turning to Ron.
“No thanks.”
Harry gaped at the door, too shocked to say anything. Someone knocked.
He led the way back out the front door, but instead of going down the drive, took a smaller path that followed the circumference of the house. As they passed through a formal garden filled with white roses, Harry thought happily how jealous Aunt Petunia would be if she could see it.
“Who bet on them?” Draco asked.
Tilly disappeared as Harry walked into the room. The Malfoy owlery was much smaller than the one at Hogwarts, but the smell was the same. He found Hedwig perched next to Thoth, and grinned at the thought of them becoming friends, when he noticed they weren't alone.
“You’re only taking five NEWTS so stop whining,” Draco signed with lazy fingers. He was so tired. He stretched, and let out a huge yawn.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And your boyfriend?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
He nodded, as if someone had whispered those words directly into his head, yet he didn't move, simply stared at the blankets in confusion.
“You’re too noble for that. You would have cursed me and left me in the infirmary to die.”
Harry: I still miss you, you git.
I’m so excited that I’m crying!
“The what?”
Harry pulled off, and Draco came, moaning and collapsing on the bed and in Harry’s arms.
“Are you done?” Harry screams from behind the closed door. “I need to pee.”
Draco felt  all the warmth that he had been feeling leave him. He hadn’t forgotten about his problems, and often wondered about who the sexy lullaby singer could be. He thought it could be Ginny Weasley, and that was one of the reasons why he wanted to defeat Gryffindor so badly in the upcoming match. However, the little moments he had spent with Harry lately had almost made him feel like they were soulmates.
The students got up all at once making a lot of noise, and then, little by little, the excited voices quiet down as they began to think. Draco knew that many of his classmates had learned with Harry to cast the patronus charm years ago, and he also knew that he’d be rubbish at it. It was the kind of magic that worked better when you screamed it. He had seen that lot of times before. So it was the kind of magic that he had troubles casting. With a sigh and a sympathetic glance from Pansy, he tried to think of his happiest memory.
Harry: I used my most persuasive voice, and charming personality (because I have that, don’t laugh, you git), and painted Pansy in a very good light. Ginny fell for her, I could see it.
He glanced at Draco, but there wasn’t anything he could do to help him at that moment, so he turned to the fireplace and floo-called Ron. When he was done, he looked around but didn’t see Draco. As Michael kept screaming and hitting the door, Harry assumed Draco was still inside, so he went to the bedroom.
“I want it with you too.”
“Got it. I just have to think about my best friends. Should I think about the dead one or about the one that is under house arrest and doesn’t talk to me because he blames me for the death of the first one?” He asked, raising his eyebrows and looking at Harry. Harry looked back confused and hurt, and Draco sighed. Harry was trying to help him, and Draco’s problems weren’t his fault. “Sorry.” He signed with lazy fingers, and dropped himself on a table.
“It’s good,” she says, after licking her lips. “Better than that shit you gave me last time.”
“Of course not!” Pansy exclaimed. His friends had never liked Michael. “But this… Are you sure? You’re going to share the bed with a stranger!”
More often than not, Draco ends up hurt in some way after work. Harry doesn’t know how to help him anymore.
Her flat is small but cozy. I know she lives —lived— alone so after making sure none of her neighbours are on sight, I open the door and go inside. I put on the gloves once again and look around. She has a lot of pictures on a little table in the living room, but Harry isn’t in any of them. There are a few fashion magazines on a side table, and the dirty dishes from last night's dinner are still in the sink.
“Me too,” Draco answered, looking at all the things they had and at the list, making sure they had bought everything they needed. “You pay, right?”
Something you lost? My old snitch? The T-shirt you said you’ve lost but know for a fact you threw in the trash because you hated it?
“Oh! What happened to the house?” Harry asked, looking at him with interest.
And that’s important, that I know he loves me, because then I know that the note I found this morning on his pocket, the one written with red lipstick and signed “Yours” doesn’t mean anything serious. I know that whoever Yours is isn’t important to Harry. Everyone has affairs. It’s just another part of marriage. Mother had one, and Father had at least two. But they had been together all these years anyway. Harry loves me, and this thing with Yours is just a little distraction, a little thing he has for himself, like I have my Tuesdays with Pansy and Greg and my yoga classes.
Harry was nervous. He was outside his own flat but he didn’t dare go inside. Should he ring the doorbell or just enter? During the weekends, the flat was Draco’s, so he didn’t know if he had any right to just go inside. On the other hand, it felt ridiculous to knock on his own door.
Harry: I love you.
Idiot
“Yes, and that works so well, right? Look at your parents.”
“I guess.”
“Okay,” Harry said, looking at his parchment. “Merlin! There are things here I haven’t heard about in my life. What the hell is a H-R-O-F?”
His father just snorted, the traitor. What has his life become when he couldn’t even trust his family?
Harry: I almost killed Goyle tonight. He took a minute to draw a flower!! A MINUTE, Draco!
Done with the bedroom, he went to the kitchen to prepare some lunch. Having grown up in a pure-blood manor, he hadn’t had to cook in his life. Later, when he moved in with Michael, they had a house-elf that did all the chores too. Draco hadn’t had money then, but his boyfriend had an important job at Gringotts and had paid for everything.
Harry couldn’t believe that Draco and his friend had done the potion so quickly. Patients like Sarah had endured a lot of pain just because the Ministry refused to pay a few Galleons. He hoped that the people in charge compensated Draco and Radwah as they deserved.
Harry: I asked them about the Pansy/Ginny thing, but they said nothing. Don't you think it's suspicious? If I were Pansy, I'd tell all of this to Blaise. He seems like the kind of man that knows these things.
Draco smiles to herself. It always makes her happy to see Harry and her mother getting along so well. It was one of her biggest fears, back when she and Harry started dating, that her family and he would fight. However, her parents, especially her mother, were wonderful about it. Lucius has always been special though.
“You shouldn't be here, the rest of the house will be down soon,” she said.
“And now everyone thinks it must be one of us,” Harry guessed, gesturing between him and Draco.
“Who is it?”
at the moment. I'll get more tapes next summer.”
“Mother says the Ministry wants to get it over with as quickly as possible to avoid the bad publicity,” Draco said. “It's because of you, of course.”
“The Headmaster. Still, I was able to use my arm as an excuse to get out of being made to act out scenes from his books in class.” Harry chopped the last starfish a little harder than necessary at the memory of those classes.
Harry grinned. “My aunt hates it. Too much long hair and baggy clothes for her, I think. She caught Dudley watching one of their video clips and actually told him he couldn't listen to them, so I decided I would. Turns out I like them.”
Harry shrugged. “You're forgetting that I'm the one letting the monster out. It's not going to hurt me.”
“Aqua vitae,” he said to the stone wall. It didn't move. “Aqua vitae!” The wall continued to act like, well, a stone wall. He'd forgotten to check the new password before he left the common room that morning. “Great. That's just fucking great,” he said angrily. “Er... Green and silver? Er... Cunning and ambition? Merlin. Salazar. Slytherin's monster.” The wall stayed shut. “
Harry looked up. “She didn't like wizarding music then?”
“I've got a musical Valentine for Harry Potter,” the dwarf declared.
“Of course, it wasn't just you. I had started the process with the Weasley chit. But then she stopped writing to me, and I worried that I had lost my chance. But then you wrote to me, Harry Potter.”
“What is sir wanting?” she squeaked.
The other boys burst into laughter as Harry stared around the room. The copy of the
Justin nodded. “I know, Susan told me. Still, everything worked out in the end, didn't it?”
“I've been good this year!”
Ginny sat down between him and Neville. “Not bad, considering. Mostly embarrassed. Dad was pretty annoyed that I'd kept the diary in the first place. But I tried to get rid of it a few months ago, so I've been back to normal for a while now. I feel pretty guilty about everything, though.”
Gemma brightened again at the mention of her boyfriend. “Great, actually. He's got an internship with the
“I'm sure she'll understand,” Harry said consolingly.
“No, they like me because I told them where to find easy prey.”
“I'm a Malfoy and a Black, I can trace my lineage back just as far, and it doesn't contain Slytherin,” said Draco.
Draco gave him a polite smile and continued. “Hagrid had told Harry and I that the last time the Chamber was opened, a girl died. And I thought that it might have been Myrtle, the ghost who haunts the bathroom on the first floor. So we went and asked her about her death. She told us she couldn't remember anything except for glowing yellow eyes, and Professor Snape said that sounded like a basilisk to him. She pointed us towards a sink, and it opened up when I spoke Parseltongue to it. And that's all I can tell you, I'm afraid,” Draco broke off, shooting a dirty look at Snape.
Dumbledore ushered Fudge out of the office. Harry turned to Draco, who was completely white and staring after his father. “Are you okay?”
Pomfrey's office door banged open and she made her way over. “All of you out right now! This boy has thirty-three bones to regrow and he needs rest!”
Harry stared at him. “You're not going to tell anyone I've been hearing things?”
“Yep, definitely. And you were brilliant, Mrs Malfoy. Was all that stuff true? Can you really get away with hexing them or something next year?”
“Just a friendly warning, Harry, that it's not a good look to go handing out signed photos to your fellow students. Makes you look a trifle conceited.”
“Mostly,” shrugged Draco.
Hermione nodded. “Exactly.”
“Waste of time,” Millicent said.
As they neared McGonagall's office they heard shouting. Snape frowned and opened the door. There was a small crowd of people standing in the office: McGonagall, Dumbledore, two men in red robes, and another in a pin-striped suit and a bright green bowler hat.
Snape didn't lead him to his office, but the Potions classroom, closing the door behind them. Harry stood next to a desk uncertainly.
“Flint, one of the Bludgers has been tampered with, it won't leave Harry alone. Get Hooch to look it over,” Gemma replied angrily.
“But when we got to the Entrance Hall, I heard something. Some
The other girls and Blaise followed her out of the hall. Theo looked around himself before leaning over the table towards Harry and Draco. “You know that favour you both owe me? It's time to pay up.”
“I think that's casual clothes covered for now. I'll get Ainsley to try you for a set of robes – you can't wear your school robes in public, you know – and some winter coats. And I really must go help Draco with the jeans he promised you he'd buy.”
Harry stood up quickly. A hot shower would make him feel more alert.
,” Harry hissed.
Hagrid looked down at his hand as if he'd forgotten the rooster was there. “Summat's bin killin' me roosters. This is the second one this term. It's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear, but I need Dumbledore's permission to put a charm around the chook house.” Hagrid paused, and leaned a little closer. “Yeh sure yer all right? Yeh look mighty annoyed about somethin'.”
Dobby disappeared with a crack. Harry hastily put the water jug back on the table and lay back against his pillow, shifting his sore arm as he watched the infirmary door.
Finally, Snape seemed satisfied, and returned to his seat. “You seem perfectly fine to me. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that the... Emotional stress of the day has simply exhausted you. I suggest the both of you go straight to bed, and if anyone asks, stick to your story about the Astronomy Tower.”
“Are you allowed to leave yet?”
“Oh, Harry, I do hope you're thinking of buying that one, it suits you so well,” she gushed, then came into the room.
Harry just laughed. “Don't you mean your title?”
Hagrid shuddered. “No' yet, but I'll be right after some chocolate. Maybe a drink. I better go see Dumbledore.”
“Are – are they albino peacocks?” Harry pointed.
“Yes, but I'm not telling you anything!”
“You were possessed?” she cried as she hugged Harry.
“No, Harry Potter. Master Lucius expects Dobby to punish himself when Dobby misbehaves.”
“She really misses you when you're at Hogwarts, doesn't she?” Harry asked once they were in the hallway.
The door to the office slammed open, and Mr Malfoy strode in with a bandaged Dobby at his heels. He faltered slightly when he saw the Minister for Magic, but recovered to glare at Dumbledore. He took no notice of Draco. “So, Dumbledore, you're back, even though your suspension still stands.”
“You were fine last Halloween,” he said.
Theo hesitated, then nodded and handed it over.
“She did? Well, then you can't blame me for doing the same, it must be genetic,” Harry said with a grin.
Harry turned the cloak pin over in his hands. “If you say so.”
The rest of August was less eventful than their trip to Diagon Alley. Harry and Draco spent most of it playing Quidditch or hanging out in Draco's room. Harry had started trying to teach Parseltongue to Draco, but it was slow going, and all he'd learnt so far were the most basic phrases. Mrs Malfoy took them out to lunch a few times, and one night, they visited Stonehenge. It was the first time Harry had ever been to a national monument, and he couldn't hide his excitement.
“Pining for someone, are we?”
Harry nodded. “Alright. What do you want me to do?”
He quickly grabbed a new bottle of ink, dipped a quill in it, and let some drops fall onto the first page of the diary. They gleamed on the paper for a moment, before sinking into the page, leaving it blank. Harry stared at the diary for a second then quickly re-inked his quill.
A second later Draco appeared as he ripped off the Invisibility Cloak and launched himself at Harry, hugging him fiercely. “I thought you were dead,” came his muffled voice.
Harry blinked at the speech, and Draco pushed off the wall he'd been leaning against.
“Or maybe a picture?”
Draco bit his lip. “He does like monsters...”
“Shit!” Harry looked around him desperately for some water, but couldn't see anything. He watched helplessly as the bird gave a shriek and burnt into a pile of ash. Harry swore again as he crept closer. He was already in enough trouble without Dumbledore thinking he'd killed his bird, too. He heard the door open and jerked around.
Hermione shook her head. “Slytherins.”
No, it wasn't, he remembered. Grinning, he pulled up the loose floorboard and fished out Dudley's old Walkman and the Pearl Jam tape he'd managed to buy earlier that summer. He'd saved up painstakingly by collecting any money he found in the couch cushions or near public phoneboxes. It was a far cry from his piles of gold in his Gringotts vault. He slipped in the headphones and sat on his bed, looking out of the window in misery.
“Wow.”
“No you won't,” Tom snarled. “
Snape looked at Harry in disbelief. “You promised a giant, murderous serpent its freedom?”
“You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school. Forgot to mention it... Slipped your mind, I daresay...” Uncle Vernon grabbed Harry by his collar and started dragging Harry upstairs. “Well, I've got news for you, boy... I'm locking you up... You're never going back to that school... Never... And if you try and magic yourself out – they'll expel you!”
As they played, conversation quickly turned to Quidditch. “Flint's graduating this year, so we'll need another Chaser. And captain,” Harry mused.
“Where's the lock gone?” she asked.
Draco let out a bitter laugh. “Trust me, it was him. He hates that I'm friends with Hagrid, and he's always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to Hogwarts. He has the other governors in his pocket and he's very influential with Fudge.”
Harry blinked and turned away from the wall, just as the sound of excited voices came echoing towards them. Before they could move, a crowd of students came around the corner. When they saw the scene they came to an abrupt stop.
Harry watched as Draco read the story. His face gradually went completely white, before angry pink spots appeared on his cheeks. “Son of a banshee,” he snarled.
“No need for that, no indeed. Come through, come through.” Ainsley recovered his composure and held open the curtain for them.
As the expression says “fake it ‘til you make it”, and that’s exactly what Harry and I do for five months. We talk to our friends and family as always, we attend dinners and galas, we comfort Parvati and her family that were devastated after so much time without Padma. By now, I sometimes forget what really happened.
“Morning,” Radwah said, weary. “Are you okay?”
“Because they’re shiny and beautiful?”
you brew it, then I guess it’s yours, yes.”
“It’s dark. You can’t see if I’m blushing or not. Why were you so upset before by the way? Is it that bad that I might like your friends?”
Harry didn’t think it was so worrisome, but if Ron said so, he wasn’t about to not believe his friend. His protective instinct was very happy Draco was still living with him.
The next days followed the same pattern as the day after the revelation that turned Draco’s life into a miserable hell. He was alone most of the time, because when he was with people he couldn’t help but be rude to them.
They left the flat in silence, and when they reached the alley, Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and Disapparated.
No, I’m still alive, but I had to hide the phone
When the screams ceased, they opened the door, and found Sarah curled in bed, crying.
“You know what I meant! If you don’t mind answering,” he added after a second.
“No, you didn’t. It’s just that…” He forced himself to look at Harry again. “Don’t you hate me?”
But this is too horrible to think about, and I know that Harry loves me. It’s Yours who confused his mind, who made him think he loves her. I know better. That’s why the fourth possibility is the correct one:
And there are Harry’s suspicions… That night at the lake, he thought he saw Draco’s car there, too. At first, he thought he’d imagined it, but then, when he arrived home and saw the nervous wreck Draco was, that confirmed it. He had done his best to keep him out of this, but maybe it’s time to confess and gain an ally.
I make him his favourite meals, I keep calm when the news about Padma is on the wireless or
“Fine. But you can talk to me if you have any problem.” Harry got up, and joined his friends that had just appeared in the corridor with some of their classmates.
Harry: The pond is done! And no thanks to Ron.
“Look, Draco, I know it sucks, but you can’t go back to this grumpy state, okay? Please?” She kept talking to him during all the classes they shared that day, and he kept ignoring her. He didn’t want to talk to anyone, didn’t want to do anything. Apathy had wrapped its tentacles around his mind and didn’t let him think of anything else.
“You little shit,” Draco smirked. “There’s still hope for you, we can make a Slytherin out of you yet.”
“Liar.”
“Pansy?” He turned to the only ally he had left.
He heard them muttering behind him, but he didn’t care. If he had to spend the rest of his life pining after Harry and being miserable, this one seemed a moment as good as any to start with it.
“So little trust in my abilities.”
It always amazed him how he had Harry now; how they were each other’s, and how it seemed to be a thing that would last for a long time. If only they would decide to make it public.
Harry: I’m going to open my presents now, and then we’ll drink hot chocolate, and have a snowball fight! (No, I’m not 6. You’re no fun at all!).
Draco decided to ignore the jealousy he felt at not being one of Harry’s happiest moments, and focused on his words.
Padma approaches him, and he pushes her away with a little too much force. She tumbles over the edge, falls, and breaks her neck with a sharp snap on the rocky shore. Harry climbs down and shakes her, but even I know she’s already dead.
“I signed it as ‘James’ so I don’t attract some Harry Potter crazy fans,” Harry told them. “Besides, I already have a roommate.”
“What are you going to eat?” he asked, looking over the menu. “I don’t know what half these things are. What the hell is
“Yes, just a sec.” She waves her wand and her hair magically arranges itself in a messy but fancy bun. “Let’s go.”
“I really need to go now,” Draco finally says, disentangling their hands.
Aurors leading the interview: Auror Morgana Johnson and Auror Terence Roberts.
On the kitchen table:
He closed his eyes, and soon enough his mind filled with the bright and confusing images of a dream. He was flying, and Weasley kept signing at him that he was a Hufflepuff, but Draco flew faster and faster, until he left the other boy behind. He was standing in the Astronomy Tower with Harry. Draco smiled and approached him, but Harry jumped off the tower while screaming that they couldn’t be together because he was in love with a veela.
"You're sorry," she repeats like an idiot.
“I’m trying to be a better person and you accuse me of being sick?” Lucius asks, raising an eyebrow in that special way only he and Draco can manage and that irks Narcisa and Harry to no end.
8:45 am
Martin huffed and left for the front again.
Harry has always been a mess, so it’s my job to make sure his baggage is ready for his business trips. I don’t mind. In fact, I like it, it’s my way to show him affection. I fold everything carefully and with a flick of my wand, send it to the bag open on the bed.
“I know that, you idiot! I meant that… well… Are you sure your soulmate wouldn't dream with anything? Maybe he’ll just dream with an unknown voice.”
“Fine!” Draco finally half shouted. “Fine! You win! They’re cute and pretty!”
“What are you doing here?” Greg asked, standing up. He was bigger than Michael, but he ignored him too, as he had done with Pansy.
“Sorr — sorry,” Draco hiccuped, his eyes shining with mirth. Harry thought he looked very handsome like that. It was a pity he hadn’t noticed it back at school, but when he laughed, Draco was absolutely gorgeous. “I really thought it was a kind of steak. I must have confused it with something else. We can change if you want.”
“Everything hurts,” she said in a pitiful voice. “I don’t want to transform again.”
I make sure no one is in the hall, and I leave the flat. I’m crossing the street, congratulating myself on a job well-done, when something makes me turn my head to Padma’s building and I see her. Parvati Patil doesn’t see me, but I see her entering the building. She might have come looking for her sister.
Harry: She made me cry! CRY! There in front of everyone!
Harry: Isn't she cute? Adorable? I don't think Feather is a good name for a she-duck. So I looked for constellation names and chose Cassiopeia, Cassie for short. I know you're thinking I'm mental, but you are secretly delighted about Cassie.
“In your dreams,” Blaise said, and continued writing his longer than ten inches essay.
“Who’s carrying her? Who’s given up beauty for her? Who’s suffering dysphoria for her? Exactly, not you, so I can complain as much as I want until the little monster is born.”
“I wrote him letters when I was at Hogwarts,” Scorpius said then. “Do you think I’m crazy? I know he can’t read them, because he’s… because he’s… but I needed to tell him all the things that were happening at school.”
He left the note on Harry’s bedside table, and turned around to look at himself in the wall mirror. He was wearing a silver shirt that maybe was a bit too much for an outing with friends, but it had been a while since they had gone out and he had the chance to dress up. He shrugged and went to the living room to wait for Radwah, although he hadn’t had to wait too long, as she rang as soon as he sat on the sofa.
Thanks so much, all of you!! Your comments have been amazing and I can't say how much they mean to me! I was so excited writing this fic, and then sharing it with you! It has been an amazing experience!
“Leave us, it won’t be long,” Draco said, smiling reassuringly at them when they left for another table. Michael sat down in Pansy’s chair. “What do you want? And how do you know where I live?”
“I don’t want to, but I have to work.”
Harry wandered from room to room as if he were a ghost. The house was too big when it was just him, but the people he needed the most were too far away. One in Scotland and the other one… He wondered if Heaven was real. Was he… Draco up there?
Scorpius nodded and put himself closer to Harry.
Signed, Yours.
“I am in very good health, thank you very much.”
“I just want to talk to you. We haven’t talked in ages. I’ve missed it,” Harry said, smiling at him.
“Cute,” Pansy said. “Please tell me you don’t have feelings for this James man!”
“I’m not saying my opinions as they aren’t taken into account.” He picked up his newspaper again and continued reading it.
“And it won’t hurt at all?” Sarah asked hours later. “Promise?”
“Did you close the door?” Harry asked, his face very close to Draco’s. His lips were almost touching Draco’s cheek. So close that he wondered if it was even necessary to close the door anymore. How would they explain their situation if someone entered right now?
Harry: Sometimes I think of that night, of the stars, and all the stories you told me, and think that maybe you’re one of them now. In the Draco constellation, of course! You’re so far away up there! Can’t you come down here from time to time? At least once? For me?
3:12 am
Harry: The language seems like a good starting point so I downloaded an app for it, and I haven't been able to do anything else in the last few days. I wanted to tell you as soon as I began to learn, but I also wanted to tell you an actual word and not just some random sounds.
“Yes,” she deadpans.
“You know what? I’m not going to reply. I’m going to just sit here and let you make your own, wrong conclusions, and then I’ll laugh at you.” He crossed his arms and pouted.
Harry: I had to do paperwork ALL MORNING. I'm this close to snapping at someone. But apparently, I'm not ready to do field work yet.
Wait, no
“I don’t understand muggles.”
“It’s not awful! And if you don’t like it, I’ll find someone else with whom I have a child and name her that. But not, I thought of a name you could actually like.”
Harry: I know you're laughing right now.
The summer was too hot for London, but it made the ice-cream at Fortescue’s all the more enjoyable. Harry took a spoonful of his chocolate sundae, and looked at Scorpius, who was happily eating his and reading one of his new school books.
“Come on, Harry! It’s a beautiful and unique name!”
Taking a deep breath, he approached the door and knocked. It seemed like the polite thing to do.
COWS AREN’T TINY! THEY’RE GIANT BY DEFINITION!
“Shh! Did you hear that? It was our child screaming in distress in my uterus at how ugly those names are.”
“Yes, but, listen, this is more important!” He waved a hand near Theo and Pansy so they looked at him too, and began to tell them what he had heard. “He wants me to be his soulmate!” He signed excitedly once he finished.
5:31 pm
“It’s perfect,” he said.
“No,” he signed and kept eating. He wasn’t hungry exactly, but he didn’t want to hear Pansy's begs and threats again.
On the other hand, Mrs. Williams was right: what if he said yes?
“What?” Harry looked really confused now. Draco would have laughed if he wasn’t so worried. “Why would I be with you if I hated you?”
“I’m fine,” he snapped.
“What’s wrong with Ruth?” Lucius asked.
Harry: I feel better than I’ve felt in a long time.
. I throw the wand in the car and run. I hear Harry walking towards the front of the car, and then his scream. I wonder if he sees me. A red haired man running away. I wonder if he knows it’s me.
“Not enough, dear, not enou— What’s he doing here?” Pansy’s eyes had become cold, and her gaze was fixed at one point behind Draco and Radwah.
“Maybe he can read them. The Fat Friar says that if you don’t come back as a ghost you go to Beyond, but I like to think he’s here with us.”
H. Potter and P. Patil.
“Morning, Harry!” Ron said from the door. He and Hermione had just arrived for their morning breakfast-dinner. “I bring croissants and Chinese food for you. It’s from last night, but I think it’s still good.”
“Then fuck off and let as work, supervisor,” Draco snarled.
“Can I help you?” Harry asked, confused.
“Fine!” Harry took his dish as far as he could. “Better?”
“I think you should,” Pansy quickly said, wrapping his hand in hers. “I don’t know what he did to you, but what he did the other night wasn’t right, and I know you weren’t happy when you were together.”
It wasn’t little
“Were you expecting a visit?” Hermione said, as Harry cleaned everything with a few spells.
“...but that was all it said. I’m sorry, Harry,” Hermione Granger was saying.
Draco’s hands touched Harry’s torso, marvelling at the soft skin, and then, after glancing at Harry for permission, he took his pants off.
“Yes, but —”
I’m about to leave when I find something else —inside one of her bags—, two portkey tickets to Ibiza, one for H. Potter and another one for P. Patil. Harry hates the crowds and the beach. It’s like his own lover didn’t know him in the slightest. It confirms my first suspicions: this affair didn’t mean anything to Harry.
“You what?” Draco exclaims. She hasn’t heard that story before. “And you tell us to behave! That’s ruthless, Mother.”
7:06 am
Harry: CHRISTMAS TREE DONE! I spent all afternoon putting it up and decorating the house.
He put on his pajamas and laid in his bed with the curtains closed. He yawned. The teachers were losing their minds because of the NEWTS, making them work harder and harder with every day that passed, even when the exams were still weeks away. He was sure he’d pass them, although the practical exams scared him a little. He always had more problems than his classmates learning the spells, and hexes. Apparently, it was easier to cast them verbally, but that had never been an option for him. He was sure there had to be an option for people like him, so mute or deaf first year students could be as good as their classmates, but Hogwarts hadn’t discovered it yet.
“Is the Chosen One feeling pity for a Death Eater?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. “I must be a very bad influence on you.”
“Are you going to Weasley and Granger’s house?” he asked when they were standing in the alley they used for Apparitions.
“I should go over the contracts for the trip,” he says, picking up a blue folder, opening it, and reading whatever he has inside.
It had been a shock when Draco first dreamed with his soulmate’s voice, and he discovered it was Harry Potter. He was fourteen then, and had patiently awaited for the moment that Harry dreamt with him too. Although as Draco was born mute, he wondered what Harry would hear. Nothing probably. Maybe he didn’t know he had a soulmate.
Harry: Don’t be jealous. I don’t like Pansy, and this time it's true, not like when I said I didn’t like you in 6th year.
Both Jennings and his partner were frowning at their surroundings, and while they admittedly—and commendably—did not let much of their unease show, neither quite managed to hide it completely. Potter, however, seemed downright giddy as he glanced around the shop, as though too eager to possibly even entertain the notion of being intimidated for once in his sodding life. And Draco wasn’t even exasperated anymore; the whole thing was just so very
thinking about someone else spending the rest of their life with Draco, dating him, kissing him, snuggling up on the couch together and falling asleep watching some old muggle film the Slytherin would no doubt make fun of at first but end up loving. He
fare once you meet your soulmate, shall we?”
to think you were cruel, callous, as narrow-minded as the people I’d grown up despising. But then I got to know you, Draco, and I wasn’t kidding when I said earlier that you are brilliant. You are kind, you are considerate, you are caring—and, most importantly of all, you are
“Well, don’t just stand there,” she said suddenly. “Introduce me to your soulmate, Draco.”
Parvati draped an arm over Lavender’s shoulder. “She has, hasn’t she? Yet another famous celebrity in our friend group. Maybe I should have pursued playing the harpsichord after all, so we could all be famous together. Mum used to say all the time I was gifted.”
Tuesday. It happened a few years back. As I already said, I’m originally from London. My dad’s British.”
For a moment, Draco was sure his friend saw right through his lie. But then Blaise closed his mouth and gave a stiff nod. “Good.”
Which was just…fine. Absolutely, perfectly, extremely and tremendously
things for certain. And number two was that he honestly couldn’t remember a time since the age of thirteen where he, Draco Malfoy, had felt so god-damn happy.
This week was rather shitty for me, so I've decided to post the next chapter today already in hopes that it might lighten my mood. So much for a regular upload schedule lol, sorry.
“Err, yeah. Draco wanted to talk to him alone. Thought he might be more willing to talk to an ex-Death Eater than a random Ministry worker.” Nic tensed a bit at that, and Harry mentally kicked himself. Christ, he really was rubbish at this dating-stuff, wasn’t he?
Nic nodded. “Yes, of course. Sorry, I would’ve come over with Parvati and the others yesterday, but I had an appointment I couldn’t postpone.” He took a deep breath. “I just really wanted to apologize. Back at the pub, I acted like a dick. It was…uncalled for. Again, my sincerest apologies.”
After they’d finally finished stowing everything away again, Harry had journeyed into the kitchen for some water, and Draco had trailed after him. And be it due to their mutual exhaustion after the duel, or perhaps their shared boredom, Harry couldn’t say for sure—but for some reason or another, he now found himself sitting slumped against the fridge, cross-legged and clutching a large bar of chocolate, while Draco sat to his left, legs drawn up to his chest, hair a tousled but at the same time still perfectly elegant mess, thoughtfully chewing on his own broken-off piece of chocolate as he stared ahead into nothing.
But then Draco said, voice uncharacteristically timid, “You said was.”
Yaxley simply nodded, lips quirking, as though he knew something the rest of them did not and was basking in the knowledge. “Yes.”
Now, Draco was not a romantic, just so that’s clear. Yes, admittedly, he enjoyed sappy romance novels and old muggle ‘Rom-Coms’ (Pansy’s doing, suffice to say) just as much as the next person. But that was it. He was a firm realist, as all Malfoys ought to be, for it was no good dwelling on dreams and fantasies when you had an estate to run.
Only they did. They had so, so many reasons to care, to worry, to be as sad and silent as Draco now was. And Harry hated it.
“Harry, are you alright?” asked Nic, whose brows were knitted with genuine concern although he hardly knew Harry. Had he not been so overwhelmed with pain at that moment, Harry might have found that touching.
“Get a room, Potter,” Malfoy said, but there was no real bite in his words. When Harry looked back up to where he still stood near the door, the blond appeared to be exceptionally uncomfortable, so much so that he had began fidgeting with his right sleeve.
They walked in silence down the hallway, nodding in polite greeting whenever they passed a colleague—or, that is, Harry nodded in polite greeting whenever they passed a colleague. Draco was still too stunned Harry was actually touching him, holding him so tight one might think the Gryffindor was afraid Draco would leave otherwise. Which was, of course, absolutely ridiculous.
fish for compliments or draw attention to yourself. Ever. Perish the thought.”
Nic’s previous smile returned, if evidently forced as well, and he offered Harry a curt nod. “I’d love that. I’ll have Parvati give me your Floo, and we can work something out that way.”
Harry’s eyes shot across the room to where the doors had opened only to reveal Draco Malfoy striding towards him, face hidden under that usual cool mask of composure. But his grey eyes took Harry in from head to toe, which left Harry feeling oddly uncomfortable. When said eyes landed on the mess Harry had just made, the latter’s face grew hot with embarrassment. But Malfoy wordlessly waved his wand in direction of the bed, and within the blink of an eye the sick had vanished, leaving the white sheets good as new.
. That’s the truth, and regardless of whether Ginny wants to accept that or not, it can’t be changed.”
Relief flooded through the Gryffindor, and he immediately relaxed. “Christ, Nic, I thought you were some type of criminal. You gave me a proper fright.” Harry shook his head, huffing out a breath. “What are you doing out and about anyway? And in such a heavy cloak? Mate, you do realise it’s the middle of summer, right?”
“Not even after all the horrible things I said? After I ruined your date?”
And then Ron had asked her to marry him, not a month after his soulmark appeared, saying there was no need to wait since they’d have the rest of their lives together anyway. It had all been very romantic, Harry had to hand it to his best mate; they’d all had dinner at the Burrow, and everyone had been there, even Bill and Fleur and Percy and his new girlfriend, Audrey. After dessert, Ron had gotten down on one knee in the middle of the living room and given the most heart-wrenchingly sweet proposal Harry had ever heard. Hermione had cried—as had nearly everyone else, Harry included—and immediately thrown herself into her soulmate’s arms, blubbering ‘yes, yes, yes’ for five minutes straight.
Potter lifted an eyebrow, but Draco could tell the gesture wasn’t derisive, but questioning. “But you were popular, too. Especially with the Slytherins. I know as a fact they looked up to you—" he grimaced slightly "—for better or for worse.”
How did Harry know this? Well, for one, wood was far too coarse a material for the git, with all his pureblood elegance and soft edges and ethereal grace. Porcelain would be more fitting, or perhaps glass, beautiful and polished, but cutting if handled incorrectly.
Harry didn’t have time to reply, because that was when Draco’s third spell hit just a few inches north of Harry’s head. This time Harry was prepared, though, and he threw up another, stronger Protego, only to then immediately start firing his own volley of hexes at the blond Slytherin, who let out what sounded suspiciously like a cackle as he dove to the right, dodging the streaks of yellow.
Nic snorted, nostrils flaring, but there was about as much humour in the sound as currently was in Draco. “No use, is it? I may have lived in the States, but don’t think I haven’t heard of your family,
“Trying to escape?” Yaxley spat, face contorted with rage and disgust, wand pointed at Draco’s face. He tutted. “How cowardly. Just like your father in that regard, I suppose. And here I thought you wanted to be different. Little Auror Draco, just as weak now as you were four year ago.”
. Harry couldn’t claim he knew Pansy Parkinson well, but on the various occasions he had interacted with her in the past, he’d gotten the distinct impression Pansy just generally did whatever the fuck Pansy wanted to do, and fuck you. Plus, it was barely eleven, so either Draco had been grossly misinformed, or it was someone else entirely.
Draco’s eyebrows snapped together, and he opened his mouth to speak again, to no doubt tell Harry anyway because it was the right thing to do. But Harry didn’t care. He didn’t want to hear who this mystery person was that had claimed such a humongous and important piece of Draco’s life, didn’t want to know who Draco’s predestined love was meant to be.
Then Harry had started growing up, and it was true what people said, that you only ever really grew into your features during your teenage years, because Harry Potter was a prime example for it. He’d started off too thin, a bit scrawny, even, and ended up with a fine but definite layer of muscles over the years, both from Quidditch and all the other ungodly things he and his friends had gotten up to. He’d grown in height, too, until he was almost as tall as Draco (that had irked him to no end during Fifth Year), and his face had gone from juvenile and slightly chubby to angular and well-defined.
Harry laughed and dove to the side just in time to miss Draco’s answering hex, and holy shit, Harry thought, a duel with Draco Malfoy wasn’t
. How she could sit there and tell her own son his father was too much of a child to help protect him, and then
, but Potter here’s not allowed to leave this flat, not without me accompanying him. So,
“Then, please,” Takeuchi said, and although they were facing Yaxley and not the glass, their scowl was audible through their tone, “enlighten us. How should we be looking at this?”
, who’d only ever wanted to hurt their glorious Saviour, who couldn’t possibly be trusted with a job of such weightiness. Draco knew he ought to be offended, but the insults passed through one ear and out the other. No, he was far too shocked to be anything as normal as offended.
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” she sniffled, and Harry stood frozen to the spot, stunned by the sudden turn of events. “I didn’t mean to, I swear. I didn’t, I was just angry, and hurt, and I didn’t understand why…it…it wasn’t
Nic simply replied, “Do you want to talk about it? Something’s clearly bothering you.”
, he needed more time. That was all his sluggish brain could come up with, all his cyclone of racing thoughts could agree on.
“If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say someone’s
Irrational or not, Draco certainly hoped it would. But fate had never been kind to him for any prolonged periods of time, so he wasn’t counting on it.
Draco felt like he was wearing his heart on his sleeve, exposed, unprotected, practically begging to be trampled and wrecked and destroyed beyond repair. He’d done many a risky thing in his life—joining Voldemort, defecting, going into Auror training, running after Yaxley without backup. And yet the biggest risk he’d ever taken was
do you lot think I am to believe I’d try to murder the Boy Who Lived, Vanquisher of Evil, Slayer of the Dark Lord himself—
He stopped walking. “Harry.” Ahead, the Gryffindor slowed as well, tensing at the use of his first name, but not turning to face Draco. He tried again, “Harry. Look, I shouldn’t have said those things. I didn’t mean to—”
The realisation hit him like a Bludger to the face, and he stood up so fast he almost collapsed to the floor again, causing Blaise to rush forwards immediately. But Draco swatted off his friend’s hands.
However, all that cheer was long gone, the light-hearted conversations and genuine smiles now but a memory from the past, and although Draco couldn’t stop glancing over at Harry as they walked, the Gryffindor refused to make eye contact, even if Draco was certain Harry knew he was watching. At least he hadn’t Apparated back to the flat yet—if Harry locked himself in his room and ignored Draco for the rest of the night, Draco really couldn’t be held accountable for whatever irrational actions he may pursue.
It was odd; when Robards had first voiced his intentions for Malfoy to be the one looking after Harry, staying at his side all day, every day, until this whole mess blew over, Harry had searched within himself for any hint of anger similar to that which Ron had demonstrated. After all, it was
“You’re not going to leave me here,” Harry clarified, “because I’m coming, too. You said it yourself, we’re family, and that includes you and Ginny and Mrs. Weasley and George and everyone else. I’m not going to just sit here and do nothing while Angelina’s out there giving birth and your three-year-old nephew’s alone in Diagon, scared out of his mind. So,
? “If you two lovebirds aren’t too busy staring at each other, by all means, enlighten us. What has our favourite Saviour been doing to pass his time while stuck in this prison of a hospital?”
Vindictive was not an adjective Harry ever wanted ascribed to his name. So, he forgave and, most of the time, he forgot.
“Ginny,” Harry began carefully. “Ginny, I’ve always loved you and I always will. But…not in the way you want me to. Look, you’re like the little sister I never had—”
His mind went blank, his back went rigid, his breath caught at the back of his throat. No. There was no way Yaxley knew. None at all. No, he was bluffing, had to be, just toying with Draco because he could, because he was a sadist and a bastard and this was, as he’d said, his last hurrah.
When they finally did, Harry and Draco both were breathless, panting but simultaneously smiling so wide it was a wonder their faces didn’t collapse under the strain.
Harry grimaced slightly, and it made his nose scrunch up adorably. “No, no, really, it doesn’t matter, I was just thinking—”
Draco didn’t dare finish that line of thought. Just
Harry nodded gratefully and lifted a hand in goodbye. “Perfect. See you then.”
When they returned to the flat, the pancakes were burnt.
Something about the way Hayes said his surname sent a shudder of alarm coasting down Draco’s spine. Probably just the intense and all-consuming dislike that couldn’t have been more obvious if he’d tried.
She surveyed their little group of four once, dark eyes narrowed ever so slightly.
And although the affection in Draco’s gaze could not be more obvious, there
Malfoy’s grey eyes found Harry’s, and for a long moment they simply stayed there, searching, assessing. Harry let them, not willing to break whatever delicate truce they’d created. Then, Malfoy averted his gaze again.
When Death Eaters had first started trickling into Malfoy Manor in the summer of 1997, Narcissa had pulled Draco aside one day and, amongst other things, warned him there would be dangerous people coming into their lives, people Draco needed to avoid, for his own good. Dangerous, because they were willing and capable of doing whatever it took to enforce their beliefs upon the world. Even now, Draco could still remember the sickly pallor of his mother’s skin, the first flash of fear he’d ever glimpsed in her usually so proud and dauntless eyes—could still hear her words echoing in the empty hallway; beware of fanatics, Draco, for they will not be swayed from their path. But, above all, beware of the fanatic that hides their fanaticism under a mask of sanity, for you’ll never see them coming until it’s too late.
Harry couldn’t hold on to his defensiveness, not under Hermione’s sage gaze, and most certainly not under the undeniability of her words. So, he sighed. “You’re right, as always. I’ll…talk to him. Once he wakes up.”
Huh. Who would’ve thought?
here?”
—Severus Snape, the man who for years and years had seized every opportunity to belittle and humiliate and insult Harry at every turn, to make his life a living hell, all because of some childhood feud.
Finally, Hayes nodded curtly. “Oh, um, hey.” The man’s blue eyes flitted from Harry to Draco, where they stayed for a long moment. “Sorry, I, err…I just—” He shook his head. “Are you two together?”
Weasley was still frowning, and he shot Draco a barely concealed look of wariness. But then he sighed and nodded. “Fine. But Mione’ll want to talk to you, you know. Just warning you.”
Draco’s semi-smile disappeared at that, replaced instead by a scowl even larger and fiercer than the first, which really was an accomplishment in its own right. But it made Harry’s anger broil up where it’d sat simmering in his chest, smothered by shock at seeing the Slytherin barge through the restaurant doors.
And secondly—and this realisation was perhaps even more jarring—his eyes really were unnaturally mesmerising.
Harry’s eyebrows shot upwards. First smiling at Harry, then politely asking to talk to him, being nice and sincere and vulnerable—who was this person across of him and what had they done with Draco?
“I…,” Malfoy said, and swallowed hard. But then, the impossible happened, and the Slytherin nodded. “Alright—err, Harry.” He hesitated, but then added quickly, as though he might change his mind if he waited long enough, “But then you have to call me Draco, as well.”
had materialized on her wrist, which promptly turned into
Draco sighed. “I was out of line, you were out of line, we were both out of line—what difference does it make who said what. I’m still willing to keep to our truce, so there’s no need to get all frantic.”
. You might not see the change, but I do, and so does Pansy, and even your mum wrote to me the other day saying you sound lighter in your letters. Happier. That she’s glad you’re finally letting yourself live.” His dark gaze softened, and Blaise continued, “What I’m trying to say is, for Salazar’s sake, Draco, don’t fight this. You’re only sabotaging yourself. If in the end it turns out Potter wants nothing to do with you after all, then fine. So be it. It’ll suck, sure, but at least you’ll know you tried. Keep this up, and you’ll only drive yourself mad.” Blaise paused, and his eyes took on a mischievous twinkle Draco knew all too well from Pansy. “Besides, I sincerely doubt it’ll come to that. Potter cutting you loose, I mean. He seems rather fond of you, too, you know.”
But Draco only flipped the page again and replied, calm and blasé as ever, “Oh
—the man who’d tried to murder Harry on multiple occasions, who’d like nothing more than to hurt him, kill him if he could, who would find a way to use this against him, and Harry—
Harry could feel the weight of two pairs of eyes on him, but he didn’t let himself glance back at Draco, not yet, not now, not when Ginny’s expression had turned downright murderous, her nostrils flaring as her glare jumped from Harry to Draco and back.
Now, though, Draco was rather certain he liked it.
Pansy gave him her most deranged-looking smile yet. “You’re such a doll, I can see why Draco likes you.” Beside her, Draco appeared to choke on air. But Pansy was already continuing brightly, oblivious to her friend’s crisis, “We’re going out shopping on the weekend, by the way—me, Draco, Blaise, maybe a few others. Or, we’d planned to, until Draco here got himself joined at the hip with you. He can’t leave you alone, apparently, but if you were there as well…” She shrugged. “Think about it, Potter—unless that’s too much Slytherin for you to handle.” The challenge in her tone was evident, which Harry was sure was intentional.
to live, the sort that had always seemed so unreachable before but had in the last few days become a real, genuine possibility.
Hermione had left a few minutes before. She’d been in a right frenzy, because apparently her boss—who was an ignorant, thick-witted cretin, her words, not Harry’s—had moved up some important meeting to that very afternoon, and now Hermione had only an hour or two to prepare her client and set up her defence, which had her reverting back to her Hogwarts-era self under the pressure.
“Sorry, what?” Harry said, doing his very best to keep his gaze from straying back across the room, where he was now hyper-aware of Draco’s presence. It was like a tangible thing, something he could feel deep within himself, almost like a sort of warmth tugging at his attention, calling for him.
. It’s
“Salazar, Pans,” Draco grumbled, and gave his wand another particularly forceful flick, adding the remaining cocoa. “Enough with the smiles. You really are positively Hufflepuff today.”
He didn’t need to know that every single of Draco’s sarcastic replies and irritated eye-rolls served the sole purpose of hiding his true thoughts and feelings, what happened inside his chest every time Harry directed that dazzling smile his way.
Ron and he had arrived just moments before George and Angelina Disapparated to St. Mungo’s, and to say it had been a stressful few minutes would be an understatement of the most perverse proportions.
The Slytherin had the nerve to smirk. “You can certainly try.” And then, within a split-second, he had his wand out and a bright orange hex was speeding towards Harry, and were it not for his Seeker-instincts that had him putting up a hasty, wandless Protego just in the nick of time, the hex would have hit him square in the chest.
“Ah, yes,” Harry said, smirking. “Because you would
And so, when he saw the flash of green, Draco didn’t think. He lunged towards Harry, tackling the Gryffindor and knocking him to the ground with all the force he could muster. Draco only had a millisecond to act, and as he looked up to see the green curse speed nearer as though in slow motion, he could only hope he’d done enough.

—that’s when he realized the magnitude of what he’d done.
“What the
Draco blinked, then quickly caught himself again. “No. I’m headed to my room, is all. This much Gryffindor is bound to be contagious. It’s bad enough with you all day—but with six Gryffindors in one room, I don’t think even I’m Slytherin enough to withstand the pull.”
“But you openly admit you have an accomplice? Someone who’ll go after Mr. Potter once you no longer can?”
“Go on. It’s fine. I very much doubt she came here to murder you.”
Before Harry could so much as open his mouth, Draco was up out of his armchair and smiling broadly as he said, “Why yes, I’m sure Harry and I will love them. Again, so very thoughtful of you.” And with that he plucked the basket from Nic’s lap, who looked a mixture between insulted and stunned. Nic opened his mouth as though he might argue, but then closed it again and simply watched Draco through somewhat narrowed eyes.
, mind—and impose his infuriating, snobbish,
“I suppose you were looking to talk to Harry?”
. It was a
a competition, I’d win it.”
Harry collapsed to the ground like a ragdoll, and it was as though Nic had stolen the very breath from his lungs as he laid on the cold hard cobblestone, wheezing and gasping for air, none of which quite seemed to make it to his lungs. There was a faint buzzing in his head, accompanied by a dull ache at the back of his skull.
Hayes was silent for a moment, and another flash of something flickered across his eyes. Draco gritted his teeth, becoming rapidly annoyed with all the ‘something’s he was so unable to place.
He’d known this would come up eventually. It was the responsible, healthy thing to do, to let it all hang out and put the truth first, always.
Except with her gone, and Draco at the Ministry, that left Harry alone with Ron. And although Harry loved his best mate to death and couldn’t have been more grateful for how surprisingly unproblematic Ron had been since finding out Draco and he were dating…
It did not lighten the mood. If anything, Ginny’s gaze only cooled further.
in it).
Surely not.
Lavender cut him short before Harry could say anything further, batting a hand at him. “Harry, do us all a favour and shut up, will you? My flight can be postponed. We’re your
Anyways, enjoy the phenomenal mess that is Chapter 12! (*cue evil cackling in distance*)
And naturally, at that exact moment, Potter just
. He would not raise false hopes, and he would not read into this, and he would not indulge in delusions. Because that’s all they were—delusions, and fantasies, and that was quite enough of that.
Draco had known, of course, that Potter would never manage to keep his soulmark hidden from the press, but when he opened his copy of the Daily Prophet the next morning only to read the headlines ‘HARRY POTTER’S SOULMARK CONFIRMED: IT’S A
And then he kissed Harry again, only this time it wasn’t heated and desperate and bruising, but instead slow and tender and affectionate. And although the first had been undeniably intense, it was this second, gentler kiss that sent a surge of pure adoration running through Draco’s entire body, that held all the unrestrained emotion the first never could.
I won't say anything further, except...
The strange tension, the stress, the impatience for Harry to get home…
Harry dropped his wand again and blinked, confused.
Harry’s jaw set. Nope. Not even going to think about that.
However, Draco did not, in fact, yell at Weasley, nor did he attack him or so much as snap at the man again. Instead, Draco merely clenched his jaw—very, very hard.
But then Draco spoke again. “Harry? Can I—can I ask you something?”
Dominic—
And then Draco’s mouth was moving, opening against his, and Harry lost all sense of logic.
To make up for last week, here's chapter 17 a day early...I have a feeling you'll like it ;)
He was kidding, of course. And usually, Blaise would already be smirking and laughing along with him, shooting back some silver-tongued remark like a proper Slytherin.
. If that happened, Draco would have to live with it. If that ended up being Harry’s choice, then Draco would accept it and try his best to live a life without him.
Not when he'd soon have tangible, physical evidence that, for a perfectly healthy, comparatively well-adjusted man of twenty years, his love life was just not where it ought to be.
—what
There was a slight pause, and Harry worried Draco would stay silent, push his fear and worry down and let it fester like Harry knew he’d done in the past. But then eventually the Slytherin nodded, wrapping his arms around him as well. “Right.”
Which, usually, he was.
“Goodness gracious, Priyawadi,” yelped Healer Hodkinson, earning himself the type of glare that would have any man with half a brain cowering in fear. “The boy’s barely awake, you can’t simply bombard him with such information!”
Harry immediately felt such an overwhelming pang of embarrassment that he’d have loved nothing more than if the floor opened up and swallowed him then and there, releasing him from his misery. Because he
Harry racked his brain for any mention of a trip to Dublin, only to come up empty. He grimaced helplessly, glancing over at Ron for help, who in turn shrugged his shoulders in a similarly knowledgeable manner.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and forced himself to breathe. In. Out. Fucking in. Fucking out.
And, eventually, finally, Philomena averted her gaze, scowling at the floor instead. “I’ve only sold a single bottle of Acturin this year—the day before yesterday, in fact. Many of my customers stopped coming after the war, seeing as no one wants to associate themselves with dark magic anymore.” The accusation in her tone was obvious, but Potter didn’t flinch, his emerald eyes unblinking and unyielding as she continued. “It was just a single vial of the poison, but that’s all it takes; a single drop of Acturin can oftentimes be fatal already. The buyer was a young man, but he kept his face hidden. However, he seemed in a hurry, as well.”
And goddamn if Harry couldn’t sympathize with that sentiment.
Harry simply shrugged. “It’s not even five yet, and I happen to like Butterbeer a lot, for your information. It reminds me of Hogwarts.” He paused, then added, flushing slightly, “Besides, I don’t really drink. Makes me feel…not right. I don’t like having my guard down like that.”
But, Draco figured, it was a small price to pay when he could get Harry to smile like
Draco’s stomach contorted, because he already
Harry sighed and rubbed at his eyes in an effort to keep them from drooping shut. A quick glance at the clock mounted on the wall across the room revealed it was barely after seven. Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair, bemoaning the state his back would doubtlessly be in at the end of the day—and immediately shot back up again when the door flew open.
Draco hesitated, but then nodded again.
“But,” said Yaxley, “despite your undeniable dedication to your job, Draco, I do not believe that’d be your question.”
However, Draco could fully admit he himself was for the most part responsible for Harry’s abrupt departure. What he’d said to the man, to his soulmate…it hadn’t been particularly kind, to put it mildly. Plus, considering the Gryffindor’s infamous temper, Draco was actually fairly certain he’d gotten off easy.
Harry raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Your mother’s favourite china set, eh?”
. We. Home. He definitely hadn’t used those words before. Potter likely hadn’t meant it like that, no, it had undoubtedly been a mere slip-up, a blip of the mind. And yet that didn’t stop Draco’s chest from becoming inexplicably tight and warm all of a sudden.
Again, Harry could sympathize with that. There’d been a time after Sirius’ death, a few weeks, maybe a few months, when the mere mention of his godfather’s name had triggered such an intense, white-hot surge of
“No!” Those green eyes flashed dangerously, but now there was more pain than anger mirrored there. “
Senses immediately on high alert, Harry drew his wand. If there was one thing he had learned as an Auror, it was to always be alert and prepared for the worst, even if said alertness sometimes bordered on paranoia. Many people had thought Alastor Moody mad, but Harry had never forgotten the phrase ‘constant vigilance’—and it had yet to fail him.
The answer to that question was very obviously a no, and Draco decided that, yes, they needed to return to the flat as soon as possible. Harry probably shouldn’t have been running like that just minutes after being discharged, and the snogging likely hadn’t helped either.
There were grumbles and complaints, but eventually everyone except Granger and Weasley—what a shock—shuffled out the room, even Healer Hodkinson and Blaise, who needed to go gather some potions to give Potter now that he was awake, the latter of which shot Draco one last probing look before exiting the room. Draco, however, found himself lingering, unsure whether to leave as well, or stay. After all, his newest assignment was, as of a few minutes ago, to stay at Potter’s side at all times.
him!” Draco hissed, interrupting her, focus pinned solely on her brother. But still his voice trembled—whether with rage or something else, not even he could say for sure. He shrugged off Blaise’s hands, starting forwards again. “You
Needless to say, Jennings noticed. His frown deepened, and he said, “You okay, mate? You’re looking awfully pale.” The man paused. “Err, paler than usual, that is.”
But then, much to Harry’s utter bewilderment, that sneer fell away. Just like that. It was there, and then a blink of an eye later, it wasn’t, and Draco had plastered what could only be described as the blandest of bland smiles over his face. And although it didn’t meet his cool grey eyes, Harry was so taken aback by the sudden change in demeanour he didn’t even try to hide his gaping.
Draco drew in a long breath, squeezing his eyes shut for just a split second as alarm melted into horror, and horror faded into a calm sort of acceptance. He should have paid more attention to Philomena after all, it seemed. After all, she had tried to warn him there was a customer.
Jennings shifted awkwardly. “I just thought I should come over to say good job. You did us all a service today, going after Yaxley like that. Truth is, Malfoy, I may have misjudged you. When Robards gave you of all people the task to monitor Potter, I’ll admit I didn’t think you’d be the best fit for the job. Lots of us did. But after today, you proved you’re not, well…”
Malfoy gave him an unreadable stare. “Potter—”
And it dawned upon Harry what Draco must have meant earlier. “So if your father’s core is slowly dying over in Azkaban, then your mother’s core…”
Draco’s head snapped back up, only to find a vaguely familiar face staring back down at him. It belonged to a shortish but notably burly-looking man with dark, buzzed hair and a severe sort of air to him.
Draco clenched his teeth. He hated when Blaise got like this, all calm and business-like and take-no-shit; it was one of the reasons the man would make such a damn good Healer someday. However, right now, Draco could only glower and wish for once all his friends weren’t such authoritative shits. Not that it’d do him much good.
It had caused much uproar when Draco Malfoy had joined the Aurors, but with time even the harshest critics had stopped spewing their ridiculous conspiracy theories about how Draco was trying to worm himself into the Ministry to one day murder them all in traditional Death Eater fashion. But Draco did his job well, very well, in fact, and even the wariest had realized that eventually.
doing here?”
“Err,” he said eloquently, awkwardly patting her back. “How about…how about you come in, yeah? Come in, sit down, maybe have a cup of tea. Then you can tell me exactly what’s wrong. Okay?”
Lovely. Wonderful. Absolutely perfect.
It was a loud clatter that awoke Harry, followed by an angry string of impressively creative curses. And although that was certainly a hell of a lot less pleasant than being coaxed into consciousness by the soft rays of dawn, as far as getting him out of bed, it definitely did the trick.
Right, maybe Draco was just a little bit cross.
“You’d know all about that, wouldn’t you, Malfoy,” she snarled. “How long were you obsessed with Harry for? Six years? Or have you never stopped?”
Thankfully, Hermione seemed to notice his unease, for she said in that brisk, light tone she specially reserved for the many occasions Ron or Harry found themselves in a tight corner and needed bailing out, “Say, Harry, did you bake something? It smells delicious in here.”
Recognising his lack of other options, Draco did as told, his jaw all the while clenched so hard it was a wonder all his teeth didn’t shatter under the force.
Blaise’s mouth thinned further. “Fourth floor.”
Anyway, I hope you're all having a great day!
? Instead, though, he said, shrugging, “Price of fame, Potter. You think this doesn’t concern them; they think everything about you concerns them. That’s simply how it is. Nothing you can do about it.”
“Finally,” she said, crossing her arms. “Took you long enough. I was beginning to fear the both of you would never get over yourselves.”
Briefly, because the instant Draco had reached their table in a thunderstorm of red wizard robes and silver fury, he just
, he thought miserably,
Pansy—who, in contrast to Draco, looked completely unperturbed by the question—snorted again. “Salazar, if that was your game, you should have said so earlier.” And then she did what Draco so ardently wished he could do, and confidently and without hesitation pushed up the sleeve of her dress and grinned victoriously as she held out her wrist for everyone to see.
looking at the yards and yards of ivory skin currently on display, instead tearing his eyes from Draco’s and fixing his gaze on the wall right above the Slytherin’s shoulder.
Draco rolled his eyes, though one didn’t need to be his soulmate to see how utterly impatient the blond was himself. “If
,” he groaned and pushed his teacup away. “I’m going to need something stronger.”
Weasley opened his mouth to no doubt snap some mediocrely insulting comeback. “As a matter of fact, Malfoy, why don’t you—”
“You…,” Longbottom said, his tone dazed, and blinked stupidly at Draco. “You saved his life?”
It was Healer Preedan who finally broke the tense silence. “If you don’t mind me asking, what is the last thing you remember, Mr. Potter?”
“’Course,” Ron replied through a mouthful of rice, and Hermione slapped her fiancé’s arm lightly. He made a show of swallowing before speaking again. “Bill says Fleur’s a natural. Saved his sorry arse twice now, from what I’ve heard. Can’t say I’m surprised.”
Harry tried to smile, he really did. It wasn’t his fault all he wanted to do at that moment was hide in between the folds of his armchair and remain hidden there for the next hundred or so years—and the smile turned out accordingly. “Err, it wasn’t me who did the baking. Draco did.”
. But someone needs to get her to leave, and I’m sure as hell not going to be the one to do it.”
Harry swallowed, very pointedly
At that, Blaise’s confusion melted a bit, and he glanced at the closed door of Potter’s hospital room. “I don’t know much at all, I’m afraid. Only that it seems Potter was poisoned somehow. Acturin, they think it is—a nasty concoction, really. Potter’s lucky you, err, found him so quickly.”
Draco gritted his teeth. “I
, in case you’ve forgotten. That a good enough justification for you?”
Draco, however, he noticed, didn’t join in. Not that Harry’d really expected him to. No, Harry’s expectations had gone more along the lines of a tongue-lashing or two due to ‘useless, childish Gryffindor shenanigans’ or something similar, followed by a few more insults, spoken in harsh tones but with that undertone, the one that always told Harry without doubt that the Slytherin didn’t mean whatever sharp rebuke had just come out of his mouth, the one that made him grin like a loon every time because, again, Draco didn’t actually hate him anymore. On the contrary—they were
battling inside him ever since Yaxley’s revelation, and now this, the pure anger at seeing that
Pansy pouted, splaying her bloodred-lacquered fingers across her heart. “Why, Draco, you wound me. And here I thought we were friends.” She glanced at Blaise. “Clearly, we’ve been replaced. And by a
Said concerned best friend/Trainee Healer was immediately at his side, and Weasley was already saying, “Bloody hell, are you okay?”
“Relax,” said Nic, sounding mildly bored. Harry did the opposite, especially when Nic continued: “Loverboy’s fine, just a bit banged up. I couldn’t cause any lasting damage, not when everything’s already so fragile at the time being. The plan may need a few slight alterations here and there, but I’ll manage. If Mini Death Eater died, though…well, that’d ruin everything, simply put.”
Before having set foot in Harry’s flat, he’d always expected it to look the way it did. Draco had acted all shocked and horrified at the sight of all the red (not that it wasn’t indeed horrifying), but in truth he hadn’t expected anything else from Harry, who truly was so through-and-through Gryffindor that it hurt. But when Draco had imagined Harry’s actual room, the sight that now greeted him had never, not once, not
