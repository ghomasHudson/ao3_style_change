He knew his mother still wrote to Lucius every so often, but that he rarely returned the correspondence. She had followed him into two wars, and he knew a part of her still loved Lucius despite what he’d done.
They had gone to Luna’s house for the interview, but it really just felt like a conversation between old friends. Draco hadn’t realized she’d snapped a picture of the two of them.
“We’d like to offer you a publication contract, Mr. Malfoy. But there are certain terms and conditions we hope you’ll agree to.” Mrs. Davies slid the contract across the desk to Draco.
“She’s bringing some guy over to meet everyone. Bless him really, I remember how that dinner went,” Harry added with a laugh.
It hopped inside, holding out a letter for Draco to take. Draco gave him an owl treat and told him to wait, just in case. Draco opened the letter.
Monday morning found Draco in a rush and in a mood—his mother wanted to talk to him and didn't get the hint that he had places to be.
True to his word, Harry didn't say anything, just scribbled what looked like Quidditch plays in a small notebook.
“Harry, go. Apparate. I’ll handle the brooms,” Draco calmly. He could see the excitement and panic starting on Harry.
His thoughts wandered to how Harry had looked when Draco had pulled away. His swollen lips, his half-dazed eyes. The way he’d stared at Draco, seeing him.
“I still see death almost every time I close my eyes to sleep. All the deaths I once thought I could have prevented. Sirius. Remus and Tonks. Fred,” Harry sounded tired. “Me.”
“Yes,” Harry half whispered. There was something in his eyes now that Draco couldn’t read. Friends tell each other secrets. They had talked about their troubles and their trauma almost in passing over the last few months. But this conversation hard gone to the heart of it all. Like they now understood each other.
“Hmm, money isn’t really a bother, Harry. But I do like the little yard. I could grow some of the more rare Potions ingredients I might need.” Draco had gone to view a few flats already, but nothing seemed like the right fit.
“Wouldn’t want someone to see Precious Potter with a filthy Death Eater. Wouldn’t want the world to know who you’ve been fucking for the last few months.”
Draco was torn between trying to decide if that meant Harry was enjoying these meetings and trying not to stare at his sweaty, obviously just-worked-out form.
“Potter, not at the Beachwood today?” Draco asked, glancing around to see if anyone had noticed them.
, Draco started strumming. “What do you mean? I'm sorry by the way, I'm never coming back down. Can't you see?” He didn’t dare look up at Harry as he played. He felt like he was baring his soul, reading aloud something never meant to be shared.
There were whispers running through the crowd that Harry Potter was there, and people started to turn and crane their necks.
“Oh. Well then, that should definitely make your boyfriend jealous,” he said, winking and turning to stand with some other guests.
He continued to study Harry, the mess of black hair, the thin glasses, the lines of his jaw down to his neck. Draco thought he could see some black lines on Harry’s chest, only just hidden by the shirt.
He would soon have a place to make his own where he could leave his notes and books strewn about without having to worry about a house elf picking them up and messing up their order. He could brew potions until all hours of the morning without suffering his mother’s worrying looks the next morning at breakfast.
“I would never, Draco. I’d at least sell the information to the highest bidder.” She grinned, eyes full of mirth. “Can I at least have a hint?”
“Harry…” Draco started. Harry cut him off with an insistent kiss, pushing Draco back up against the door frame, bracing one hand behind Draco’s head and settling the other on Draco’s hip.
“Oh dear, I’m out of pins. I’ll pop to the back, one moment Mr. Malfoy.” She ran off quickly, winking at Harry on her way out.
Slipping on shoes, Draco made his way out the front door. He didn’t use the front entrance often, he realized. He turned up the street, shoving his hands in his pockets and walking towards the shops, humming as he went.
Harry balled his fists and glared at Draco. The bins nearby toppled over. Harry was getting angry, so Draco pushed more.
“Come off it, Potter, the night is young!” Draco lifted his glass up with the girls, sloshing half the contents onto the ground.
He stood from his chair and picked up his manuscript. “Well then Ms. Bates, I think we’re done here.” Trying to remain as composed as possible, he refrained from slamming the doors on his way out, but the candy jar on Ms. Bates desk shattered from a stray bit of accidental magic.
Draco’s mind raced. He knew that Lucius had deserved the sentencing he got, and he’d even been glad to see him toted off to rot in a cell. But to actually be faced with his death?
, he noted. Draco’s mind raced with thoughts of Harry shoving him against a wall, kissing him hard. Thought of hands grabbing his ass and fingers raking scratches in his back.
“I… Can I think about it?” Draco didn’t know how to answer. Sure, he wanted the post. But it would come with a lot of scrutiny from… well, everyone.
Just then a beautiful and rather large horse patronus came galloping into the room, rearing in front of Harry.
“And when it mattered, Draco, you made the right choices. You saved me at the Manor. You gave me your wand during the Battle. Maybe things would have been different, but maybe they were exactly as they were meant to be.”
He sat down with his hot chocolate and tried to read a recent article about potential side effects of taking both the Blemish Blitzer potion and the Weasley Wizarding Wheezes Kissing Concoction. Once he had reread the same sentence six times, he gave up, pushing the article to the side.
Harry holds Draco’s eyes for a moment, then smiles and turns back to his friends. “I hope you all can accept that.”
Draco looked down at their hands. He could feel his blush so he cleared his throat, schooled his expression, and pulled his hand back quickly, reaching for his hot chocolate.
Is that where Draco’s head was? Did he like Harry, or was this just a convenient friendship of sorts?
“Of course. I should have expected as much. No tea because Draco has standards and a sweet tooth.” He started pulling out the mugs and chocolate, bumping Draco’s shoulder.
Draco opened his eyes and quickly made his way towards the floo, shrugging on his suit jacket and using magic to get the creases out. Pansy would definitely notice and he wasn’t sure he could handle the questions right now.
Draco sat up and scooted forward to the edge of the bed, grabbing Harry’s hips as he stood. Still locked in a gaze, Harry lowered himself to his knees, pulling the pajama bottoms off of Draco. One hand grabbed Draco’s now bare ass, and the other confidently wrapped around his cock. Looking up to watch Draco’s face, he lazily gave a few tugs.
P.S. I have an Epilogue coming, partly because I hate odd numbers and partly because my beta said it's "rude to leave the readers hanging on that ending."
Harry’s arms came from behind and wrapped over his shoulders, and he kissed the top of Draco’s head. “You bought a bench,” he noted.
“Mmm,” was all Draco could think to answer with. Harry’s mouth was on his neck, sucking right where his pulse beat through. Harry’s hand had now worked its way under Draco’s shirt, feeling his lean stomach and side, tracing the v of his abdominals.
“Oh,” Harry responded. He squinted a bit at the fireplace behind Draco and grinned a little. “And you know that because?” he asked.
He woke sometime around lunch and summoned a piece of bread from the kitchen, needing to eat something.
“Harry. It’s curry,” Harry answered. “I didn’t know what kind you liked, so I brought a couple of options.
“Yes, Pans,” Draco answered, making his way to the drawing room before she came to drag him there. He leaned down and kissed her cheek. “How are you?”
Finally, Hermione approached the table and cleared her throat. The others made their way behind her, looming over their little table in the corner.
Draco rolled out of bed and made his way to the bathroom to shower, wondering how today would go. Would Harry say anything? Would it go back to normal or be awkward?
They were sitting in a booth tucked in the back, opposite each other. Their knees and legs were touching under the table. The pub had started off quiet, but it had since filled once 9 pm rolled around. Harry was still nursing his third beer, long since gone warm by now.
Draco thought. The conversation quickly turned to his (lack of) dating life, much to Draco’s chagrin.
“Your official offer letter. Oh, before you leave, would you mind signing my book?” She grinned, reaching for the advanced copy of his textbook.
Draco nodded into Harry’s shoulder, letting out another small sob and squeezing his eyes shut. Harry held him tighter.
“Türk Kahvesi and baklava. From Turkey. Apparently you’re meant to drink this coffee with the grounds. I’m not really sure how I feel about that,” Harry answered, taking a sip anyway.
“Of course.” Draco glared at Harry, who was already happily making himself look busy, ignoring Draco.
Draco answered the questions of several different people, including what looked to be some Hogwarts students, a few parents, and a reporter. One woman asked about him and Harry, the other women around her sniggering. Draco blushed and just said that they were friends and former classmates.
,” Harry answered, looking up and smiling at Draco. “Ron and I flew over this place on the way to school second year.”
“What’s happening with Ginny?” Draco asked. He knew she and Harry used to date, but he didn’t know the story behind that. He assumed they were cordial as they still talked.
“Oi! I’m trying to help you. No need for that,” he said, reaching for the owl treats on his desk anyway.
“Russia. It’s a tad too concentrated for me, I think. But that’s the last of the teas on the list, so I’ll start on coffee soon. Still don’t want to try?” He held up his cup towards Draco, knowing he would say no but offering anyway.
“Yes, please do. I expect a response by the end of this term.” She set her teacup down and reached across her desk to pick up a copy of the Prophet.
"Yeah, me too." Harry eyed Draco. "What are you working on?" He reached towards the book Draco had propped up on another stack of books. "Managing toxicity levels of wormwood in standard Healer Level 2 draughts," Harry read.
“Thank you, Ginny. I should be off, let me know if anything happens, yeah?” Harry and Ginny said their goodbyes and Harry walked towards Draco.
Harry still hadn’t looked up from his notes, unaware of the internal struggle Draco was fighting through.
Draco was in the morning room, writing down lyrics and scratching through them, just to rewrite the same thing again.
“Yes. Potions professor. You have your mastery and have written the textbook. You should do quite well.”
Draco and Harry settled back into their earlier routine over the next several days. They’d meet in the morning at the Beachwood. Draco would have his usual hot chocolate and Harry had settled on black coffee.
“What? I grew up a muggle. I didn’t even know magic was real until Hagrid showed up with my letter,” Harry pointed out.
Once they were outside in the warm summer air, Draco’s ears were ringing from the sudden quiet. Harry grabbed his arm and guided him towards the apparition point.
Draco felt the moan escape his lips, and felt Harry’s tongue go right back to swirl around the tip of Draco’s arousal. “Merlin,” he breathed aloud this time. Feeling himself about to fall over the edge, he pulled Harry off and to a stand, not ready for this to be over.
"Really? I don't think I'd consider you the musical type. Well, why don't you write a song then," Harry suggested.
anything now. I’m just waiting for practice to start back up for the Falcons. I feel like I should be doing something.”
Song is Two Ghosts by Harry Styles. One line of lyrics changed to fit the story (same lips red, same eyes blue changed to same eyes green, same lips too).
“Sitting? Typically what one does with a bench,” Harry responded sarcastically. “Just somewhere to relax and enjoy good weather when we have it.”
“You don’t look like it’s nothing,” Draco said, seeing that Harry was pulling at the loose thread on his sleeve.
He straightened his suit and took a deep breath, preparing himself for a night of Pansy. He loved her dearly, but she was a lot to handle in large doses.
Draco thought, trying to shove down the voice in his mind that was telling him buying more tea was awfully hopeful of him.
“Need to head home to freshen up a bit, promised I would meet Ron and Hermione to head to the pub together. Neville’s going to ask Hannah to marry him and wants us there for moral support,” Harry grinned.
“The best was at the zoo on Dudley’s birthday. Right before I found out about Hogwarts, actually. He was pestering a python so I made the glass disappear and he fell in.”
Late that evening, Draco heard a tapping at his window. Half hoping to see Agatha, he was disappointed when he saw a plain brown barn owl.
As the officiant started reciting the vows for Theo and Pansy to repeat back, Draco’s eyes found Harry in the pews. Their eyes stayed locked on each other for the remainder of the ceremony.
Draco was waiting in an office in the back of the store, peaking through the window at the packed bookshop. He was nervous and wished Harry was there to calm him. But since winning the World Cup, Harry had been made captain of the Falcons and had practice.
A few minutes later, as they counted down the seconds to the new year, Draco couldn’t help but feel a tiny bit jealous of Blaise. Pushing the thought aside, he pulled Harry in for a kiss.
Draco got out of Harry’s bed and started to gather his clothes, which Harry had tossed haphazardly in the heat of their undressing earlier. He pulled on and buttoned his trousers.
“However, he is an adult and I trust that he can make his own decisions. He also is an extremely good judge of character.” She was smiling at him.
Changing subjects to something much lighter, Draco recalled a memory from his childhood of having to take piano lessons.
His mind was drifting, thinking about how they would react to him bringing Harry along to one of these dinners. They would likely accept him quickly but give him a hard time about it. He wondered if Harry’s friends would do the same for him.
Draco looked around. They were in a small cluster of trees and he couldn’t see very far through them, but there was a well-worn path.
"Draco, I can see that your mind is elsewhere," knowingly reading Draco. He'd never quite gotten used to how she could do that. Her and Pansy. Draco could hide his thoughts and emotions so well, except where they were concerned. "Go. Your mind is already there, so go."
“Oh, hi guys.” Harry glanced over at Draco, then stood to greet his friends. Draco knew from Pansy that Harry had told his friends he was seeing someone, but she’d also said they weren’t sure who.
The sky above them was a stunning shade of blue, with small clouds dusting above. It was an unusually sunny day for spring in England, but Draco was glad for it. The wind caught them both and Draco looked over at Harry, hair blowing around his face and smiling peacefully with his eyes closed. Like he was trying to breathe as much of this air as possible.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He’d mentioned to Harry how he liked to play music that he knew his mother wouldn’t like, but didn’t think he’d go out and buy him more.
Since then, Draco had practically become a recluse from most wizarding society, stalking the halls of the Manor for months before finally deciding to try and make something of his new life. Potions was where Draco's heart lay, and so he studied privately under a potions master in France for some time. Not long after getting his mastery, Draco had the idea to write a Potions textbook and had been working on it since.
When the song was through, Draco stumbled back to the table and into Harry. He had already stood and easily caught Draco, steadying him.
Draco looked Harry over. “I’m not sure how my boyfriend would feel about me dancing with some hot stranger.”
“I was wondering where you’d gotten off to,” he half whispered, coming to settle himself on Draco’s armrest. He kissed Draco and then nervously ran his hand through his hair. “What are you doing down here?”
Harry never came to the Beachwood on Sundays, so Draco took that as an opportunity to write in peace. Lately, he’d been writing letters that he would never send, apologizing and explaining. He was working on one to Vincent. There was so much about Crabbe's life and death he felt responsible for.
"Have you tried it? You always have the same thing. Don't you get bored?" Harry asked. He looked genuinely curious.
“My mother took it pretty well, too, actually,” Draco said, remembering the look Narcissa had given him across the dinner table when he told her he didn’t ever want to find a wife. She’d slowly swallowed her food and then nodded. The next time they’d talked about his responsibilities as heir, she’d just said ‘if’ instead of when. Draco considered that the best he’d get.
Now seven pints in, Draco was seriously feeling the effects of the alcohol. He’d long forgotten what he came here to forget and was laughing raucously at something Harry had said.
But Draco finally understood that all of these words he’d written were meant for Harry and that Harry was meant to hear them. that maybe he should have been singing them for Harry all along.
Draco sat back in his chair, fiddling with the champagne flute and fondly watching his friends argue about when to announce the engagement in the Prophet.
Draco’s hands were back in that unruly black hair, determined to make that just-shagged look all his doing this time. Their kissing was getting more desperate, Draco’s hands making their way down Harry’s taunt shoulders to firmly grasp his ass.
Draco smiled, rubbing the last of the sleep from his eyes. He slipped his house shoes onto his feet, making his way to the kitchen for some breakfast.
After Harry and Draco finished their food, Harry said, “Come see.” He nodded his head towards the back of the house, taking the packages and leading Draco to the morning room.
“Yes. Most of the time it’s the melody that will get stuck in my head first, and the lyrics will come later. The lyrics almost feel like letters,” Draco paused. “You’d mentioned writing letters helped.”
They laid in Draco’s bed together for a while, talking about this and that. Draco had studied Harry’s tattoo for a bit, asking Harry about it. Spanning from his left pec and over his shoulder to his back was a snowy owl, wings outstretched as if in flight. Harry told Draco of Hedwig and how she was his first ever birthday present and the first friend he’d ever made. And of how she died trying to protect him from Voldemort. The tattoo was a gorgeous tribute to her life, and suited Harry perfectly.
“Yes. It would be nice to be closer to more shops to buy potions and have my own space to brew. But mostly because my mother keeps asking me personal questions.”
, he thought. In front of him was a canyon, seemingly out of nowhere. It cut a u-shape through the ground, which practically dropped out from under them. Rocks and grass and wildflowers ran down to meet at a small river, meandering through the valley.
“Most of my early magic was used to terrorize the house elves.” Harry gave him a look. “Not in that way, Potter. Mother would ask for a tea service, and suddenly there would be no sugar in the house. Or when guests would arrive, their coats would suddenly fly off to go dance in the ballroom.”
“Mr. Malfoy, you seem to have done rather well for yourself since you left Hogwarts,” she said as she added sugar to her tea and stirred.
Draco went to the wall of bookshelves and began perusing the titles. Most of everything seemed decades old, subjects ranging from ancient wizarding genealogy to spells and potions, likely all very outdated. Draco tried his best not to eavesdrop, but it was hard and Harry was not trying to keep his voice down at all.
he thought. 10 o’clock had long since passed and he wondered if Harry had gone to the Beachwood to see Draco.
This story was stuck in my head for 6 months, and for the last two weeks, I've been finally writing it down. I hope you all enjoyed it. Another big thank you to my beta, Aigidion.
The next morning Harry scoffed at the paper. Right underneath the article on the front page about the Falcons’ win was a story of him and Draco. There was a picture of the two of them at the after party, standing close. There were also a few pictures taken from their outings over the last few weeks.
Without a word, Harry got a better grip on Draco and apparated him to the doorstep of his flat. And before Draco could turn to say anything, Harry was gone with another *crack*.
“Harry, get your ass to St. Mungo’s! Hermione’s having the baby!” Ron’s voice called with a mixture of excitement and panic.
Draco sighed, putting the paper down without finishing the article. They were front-page news in the Prophet. And to make matters worse, they’d included a picture of the two of them at the Beachwood from earlier that week. Draco was in his usual suit, reading through
“How did you know where…” Draco trailed off as Harry was still talking about which flavors should and shouldn’t be mixed, how some were sweet and some spicy, some went better over rice, and there was even a place that had curry pastries.
I originally rated this fanfic as Mature, and feel as if the rest of the story (not including this chapter) would still be considered Mature. However, as this chapter contains an explicit sex scene, I've decided to up the rating to Explicit. I find the line between "Mature" and "Explicit" is rather blurry, so I'm erring on the side of caution.
They sat in the morning room again. The sun had long set, so Draco turned on the lamps and lit the fireplace with magic as they walked in.
They got into bed together and curled comfortably around each other, drifting back to sleep in each other’s arms.
His hands were running up and down Harry’s chest and sides, memorizing the muscles and lines and scars.
Harry quirked his eyebrow and shifted in his seat. “Is there something on my face?” he asked, wiping at his mouth.
“Hmm,” was Draco’s only response, choosing to ignore that Harry had said ‘we’ and leading them into the morning room.
“Don’t you have somewhere to be?” Draco was already starting to pick up the remaining books, sure he’d lost the battle.
Just then, Harry made his way into the kitchen. He glanced at Draco, who nodded towards the paper. Skimming the article, Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco thought about what he would say. He didn’t know how to apologize well, wasn’t good at admitting his mistakes. He reached for his guitar, wanting to play a few notes.
“I promised Pansy I would help discuss the details of her engagement party.” Draco had already explained this to Harry, but Harry liked to forget things he didn’t like.
"Yes, well, you need higher standards." Really, Harry seemed like he would be happy to have sink water.
The officiant pronounced them married and the wedding party made their way out of the church. They took pictures, and Draco escaped to the reception hall to get ready to perform for the first dance. After Neville and Hannah’s wedding, Pansy had made Draco promise to write her and Theo a song to sing as their first dance.
When he returned home, Draco owled the agent and made an appointment to see the flat later that day.
“We had practice early this morning and I didn’t think I had time to shower before coming here,” Harry replied guiltily.
Draco snapped to when the kettle started to scream. He pulled back from Harry, putting as much space between them as he could before his back hit the island.
“Oh.” Harry stopped pulling lids off of the containers. “Oh,” he said again, this time almost excitedly.
He was lost in the new melody, pausing to jot down some notes or lyrics every so often. He hadn’t heard Harry come in through the floo.
, Draco thought fondly, leaning against the door frame to watch Harry. He was putting the milk carton back into the fridge, seeing Draco as he did. He smiled, then leaned up against the kitchen island and folded him arms over his chest, bracing himself against the chill of the very early morning.
Draco merely raised his eyebrow in question, choosing to look Harry over. He was dressed in muggle jeans and a thin tee shirt that accentuated his broad shoulders and muscles nicely. His hair was as unruly as ever.
“I’m not saying that as a bad thing. Just saying that maybe she could do with relaxing now and then,” Draco said.
“Will you dance with me this time, Potter?” Draco found Harry at the bar about to get a drink. “I’m sober and promise not to make an arse of myself again.”
They all give their congratulations and ‘I told you so’s’, and Ron mutters what sounds suspiciously like ‘ferret,’ but is smiling too.
He tried to get back to the journal, he really did. But memories--and the inevitable guilt that came along with those--forced their way to the front of Draco's mind. Before he knew it, Harry was finished his meal, checking his watch, rushing to clean up his little spot, and quickly making his way out the door.
Draco summoned his guitar and sat up on the edge of his chair. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths. He hadn’t yet decided what to play first.
After what felt like an uncomfortable amount of time, Harry pointed at the guitar in the corner. “Do you play?”
She answered with a ‘hoo’ and held her leg out for Draco to grab the letter. He gave her a few scratches before she hopped back to the window and took off.
I've gone back and edited Chapters 1-4 to have all of Draco's thoughts appear in italics now. I find it's easier to read. No other changes though.
“Draco…” he breathes. He looks up into Draco’s eyes and Draco sees the sorrow. But he’s already long forgiven Harry for using that spell on him. He was protecting himself, and Draco deserved it. And it was a reminder of who he’d been and who he had become now.
Harry picked his wand up from next to the stove and vanished the burnt milk. He then pointed it at Draco’s mug, which immediately filled with steaming hot chocolate and marshmallows. He picked up two mugs and nodded towards the morning room.
“You’re late,” Harry says accusingly. Draco’s hot chocolate and croissant was sitting at the empty spot of their table as Draco came in.
. Draco knew that Harry deserved at least that. And maybe, just maybe, he’d give Draco a second chance.
Draco woke to the sound of tapping on the glass window. Agatha was perched outside, impatiently waiting for Draco to let her in.
It was not graceful, and both Harry and Draco stumbled their way up the steps, missing some, tripping, hitting the walls. They were laughing and kissing and slightly bruised by the time Draco pushed his bedroom door open and was guided, backwards, to his bed.
“I’m fine, really. I’ve been seeing someone. And no, I won’t tell you who lest the entire wizarding community find out about it tomorrow,” Draco said, staunching out Pansy’s almost immediate question.
“I know,” he answered. Harry flopped his head back onto the pillows. Draco got his shirt on and walked over to Harry, leaving a quick kiss on his lips. Harry reached up and took advantage of Draco’s unbuttoned shirt, feeling his stomach muscles and deepening the kiss.
Rolling out of bed, Draco opened the window. She gave him his letter, snapped the owl treat from his hands, grumpily hooted at him, then took off out the window.
Pansy sighed. She disappeared into the kitchen a few moments, returning with a steaming plate of eggs, bacon, and toast. She took the scotch from Draco’s hand and replaced it with the food.
“Oh, Minerva, please,” she said. “We’re both adults.” She looked at him through her glasses, making him feel more like a student than ever.
“Draco. I’m Olivia, then. I’ll owl you as soon as we have a date.” She scribbled something on a piece of paper and sent it flying out the door.
Harry picked up a handful of floo powder, turned to Draco and said, “Thank you, Draco, for everything today.” He threw the powder into the fireplace, stepped inside, spoke his destination, and was gone.
“Harry. It doesn’t change the fact that they are your friends and I’m sure they don’t mind,” Draco knew what Harry meant though. Sometimes he felt like he was intruding on Pansy and Nott when he visited. Third wheeling and all that.
“Oh no, this is definitely not anywhere near home. I hope you don’t mind a bit of a fly, it’s about an hours’ flight north.”
“Death Eater filth. You don’t deserve to walk through Diagon Alley with that stain from the Dark Lord on your arm,” he spat at Draco’s feet, and hurried away, muttering curses at Draco.
He looked up when the bell chimed as the door opened. There weren't often many other customers at this time of day. Which is exactly why Draco chose to come to the Beachwood Cafe at 10 most mornings. Moping about the Manor day in and day out did no good, but walking the streets of Diagon Alley typically drew a bit too much attention.
Harry leaned his whole body on to Draco, settling his leg between Draco’s thighs and pushing him further against the wall. Draco could feel Harry’s arousal against his stomach, which made his own erection twitch. Harry smirked into Draco’s mouth and, without breaking their heated kiss, turned to lead them up the stairs towards Draco’s room.
They sat in the quiet for a few minutes. Draco was trying to figure out how to ask Harry what this was.
There it was again, the golden glow from behind Harry. The melody Draco had been humming popped back into his head.
“And we do have an offer price in the contract, but that can be negotiable if it doesn’t seem appropriate…” She almost looked nervous.
“I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way. Mind, you grow a little wiser, little better every day…” a voice sang through the room.
Draco felt his body reacting to the memories. He’d have a new problem soon if he didn’t switch gears.
“You did. And I didn’t help.” Draco thought back to that year, the desperate hoping he could get out of the task Voldemort had given him. Save his own life, save his family’s lives. He kept thinking maybe he could be better.
“I’m sure there was plenty of dark magic sewn into the wards that you’ll never be rid of that feeling. I’m afraid the Manor is the same,” Draco said, sitting opposite Harry. “Sometimes I can see feel Voldemort there, evil walking through the halls.”
Draco thought to himself. Smiling and drinking in the sight, he decided to figure it out another time.
Draco’s mind returned to the song he’d written the day after the incident. He gave Agatha an owl treat and asked her to stay so he could write a response. But first, he wrote down the new pieces of the song.
“This is much cheerier than my place,” said Harry once they’d finished the tour. “As much renovation as I’ve done, Grimmuald Place still leaves something to be desired.” Harry sat on one of the cozy armchairs near the window.
They had been having coffee together for three weeks. Harry came to the Beachwood every day except Sundays. Some days they sat in quiet solitude, and others they talked. Draco was surprised at how easy Harry was to talk to, and at how down to earth he really was. Harry often asked personal questions and rarely understood basic social cues, and seemed rather like a bull in a china cabinet in comparison to Draco’s refined—nee, stuck up—upbringing.
Harry smiled and waved Draco over. He stood as Draco approached the table, sheepishly running a hand through his hair. There are two mugs of hot chocolate and two plates—a chocolate croissant and a blueberry muffin.
“Mmmm,” he mumbled, closing his eyes and breathing in Draco. “Molly’s planning some big to do for Ginny tonight and shooed us all away as soon as lunch was done. Didn’t want to wait until this evening to see you.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s elbow hard. He practically dragged him out of the alley and down the next block to the apparition point. Draco could tell he was seething, magic crackling around them.
Halfway through the song, Draco was humming along. Or trying, the melody had seemed to change. A few more moments passed and the song ended, and Draco looked around, realizing Harry hadn’t come back yet.
“Wonderful! I’ll just send this along to our legal department and have them reach out to your lawyers to schedule a meeting to finalize everything,” Mrs. Davies said, standing. “It’s been a real pleasure, Mr. Malfoy, I’m so glad to have you join our publishing house.”
My beta commented that seven pints is an awful lot, but after some discussion, I kept it. Around New Orleans, where I'm from, that's pretty normal. I don't really condone drinking that much, clearly it makes you do dumb things (I'm looking at you Malfoy).
Draco was loathe to admit it to Harry, but it had been helping. He was working through a lot of issues, sorting through his emotions and thoughts much easier than when it was all in his head.
But Harry was different. They had seen each other six days a week for over two months now. But they didn’t invite other friends or go anywhere else aside from the Beachwood. Draco decided to leave it. Harry was busy writing something, so Draco opted to not tempt fate and read a novel he’d picked up while he was out.
He felt Harry’s hand wipe his cheeks and his arms wrapping around him, pulling Draco’s head to his shoulder.
Draco cut those thoughts off quickly. There was no use wishing to change the past and wondering about the 'what ifs.' He'd been down that rabbit hole before, and it wasn't a pretty place.
The sun was almost set, pale pinks and purples on the horizon. The canyon was cast in the faint moonlight, breeze still blowing steadily through the grass.
Draco thought to himself, amused. He was sitting in the Headmistress’ office at Hogwarts, about to be served tea by Headmistress McGonagall.
"Do you have somewhere to be, Draco?" Narcissa asks, almost reading his mind as they stroll through the grounds.
Draco could still smell the curry in his kitchen for the next several days. It was definitely strong, but he couldn’t help but smile every time. It reminded him of Harry and his impromptu visit.
Friendly reminder that I have no real-life knowledge of the UK and relied on images from Google for my descriptions. Also, horrible timing, Ron!
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin and brought him back up to see eye to eye. He searched Harry’s brilliant green eyes and what he saw practically made his heart hurt. Harry’s eyes were fire, burning through Draco with love and need. Draco brought their lips back together, opening his mouth to explore Harry’s.
It was written, so why not give it to y'all. I took a week long writing break and am back at it today.
All songs named are by Harry Styles and were used in previous chapters. I have an apple playlist of the songs if you want to listen:
All of them seemed to pause, looking back and forth between Harry and Draco and the table set with two drinks and all their work. It would have been comical had Draco’s heart not stopped with worry, mind racing to find some sort of excuse, some sort of lie.
“Well, for starters, do you always have to wear a suit everywhere you go, Draco?” Harry asked, gesturing at Draco’s tailored grey suit.
“I'm like Chardonnay, get better over time. Heard you say I'm not the baddest bitch, you lie,” Draco was dancing up and down the stage, feeding off of the energy of several drunk women in the front who were happily singing along with him.
They ate together and talked. About music, about their friends. Harry told Draco the whole story of the previous night and of Rose, the newest red-headed Weasley.
“Hmm,” Draco answered. Somewhere in the back of his sleepy mind he remembered telling himself not to do that anymore.
He knew there was a muggle shop around the corner and figured they’d have something. He fumbled through a drawer in his office that had some muggle money he’d converted from galleons just in case.
“Open them,” Harry said, barely containing his excitement. “This one first.” He pointed at one of the parcels.
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” he responded, standing up and buttoning his suit jacket. Pansy huffed and made a face, knowing she’d have to bother him about it later as he was making his escape.
“I know. I forgave you before I even got all the way home. You were right about some of it, I was scared. Scared of what people would say and others trying to pull us apart. Scared of getting hurt. I’m sorry, too. That I didn’t tell you how I felt.” Draco closed his eyes as Harry kissed him lightly again, on the lips and down his jawline.
“Found out I could talk to snakes then. Didn’t realize until second year that that wasn’t normal for wizards.” Harry grinned. “You know how that turned out.”
By the time they arrived, they had raced and dove, flew over towns and rivers and pastures and forests. They both landed and dismounted, out of breath but with huge smiles plastered on their faces.
“Nah, season is almost over and we didn’t qualify for the playoffs this year.” Harry looked disappointed.
Draco was setting and resetting the cheese tray when Harry came into the kitchen, grabbed his hand, and led him to the drawing room. He sat down in Draco’s chair and pulled Draco to his lap.
“You know, all this free media attention would probably help sales of your new line,” Draco suggested.
After finishing their drinks, they’d pick a place to grab some takeout and bring it back to one of their places. Sometimes they’d pop into a grocers and grab some things to cook. They always did the cooking at Draco’s flat, afraid of Kreacher since he’d caught them using a sauce pot to boil eggs.
“Yes, of course. Sorry, I popped down to the shops,” Draco answered, holding up the plastic bag as proof. “Was out of tea.”
"No. She helped keep my secret, pretended we were anytime someone questioned a bit too much.” Draco didn’t want to think about what would have happened if word had gotten out. Of if it got back to his father that he was anything but the Perfect Pureblood heir to the Malfoy name.
Draco took that as a sign to go back to his work, forcing himself to focus as much as possible on the article. Harry pulled out some parchment and started writing.
Draco stared for a moment before quickly wiping the shock from his face and remembering his manners. He stepped aside to let Harry through.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “If you’d get your head out of your own ass, you’d have noticed that Blaise was seeing someone. Well, that someone is Ginny Weasley. Who’s friends with a certain Chosen One.” Pansy eyed him, knowingly. “She says that Harry’s been seeing someone, but thinks they broke up. He won’t talk about it. You have also said that you’re seeing someone but won’t say who. And now you won’t talk about it. That's a bit much to just be coincidence, don't you think? The three of us merely connected the dots.”
Draco scanned the crowd until his eyes landed on Harry. He started to sing. Harry smiled, recognizing his song.
“Come on, Malfoy, let’s get you home. I think you’ve had enough for one night,” he half yelled above the music. A group of girls were on stage, butchering some breakup song and holding their glasses up in the air.
Braced for a fight, Draco quickly realized the noise was Harry, snoring peacefully beside him in his bed.
Draco stepped out of Pansy’s fireplace, vanishing the ashes before she could claim they had landed on her expensive, one-of-a-kind Persian carpet.
“No. No, thank you, Harry. But no. I want to do this myself. If they don’t want to publish something because a Malfoy has written it, then so be it.”
"Ethiopian blend, black," Draco responded, glancing up from his notebook to see Harry taste his coffee.
The Queen song ended and the next began. “Yesterday my life was in ruin. Now today I know what I'm doing. Got a feeling I should be doing all right, doing all right.”
He was writing notes on the side of his publishing contract, things to remember to ask his solicitor. Harry was back to scribbling different Quidditch plays in his notebook, muttering aloud every so often about formations.
Harry didn’t correct him, but threw on a large jacket and led Draco out into the back garden to the broom shed. Harry and Draco chose their brooms (there were a surprising number of options, Harry got a lot of free ones to try from different companies hoping that The Harry Potter would endorse their brooms) and were off.
“I was trying to play it cool, so I took a page from your book. Halfway through the first song I wanted to jump you. Anyway, you want to go to the Beachwood? We can still make it there for our usual.”
"Yeah, I guess. But I don't know, everyone already knows what happened. I just needed something to do. To get it off my chest. You should try it."
Draco decided to just accept that this was how he would spend his Sunday night. Trying different curries with Harry, laughing at Harry’s excitement when Draco announced that his favorite was the chicken tikka masala.
, Draco noted. He was still speeding towards Harry. “Harry, watch Wiliams,” Draco said aloud, half hoping Harry would notice. “Harry, MOVE!” Draco was out of his seat when Wiliams collided with Harry, both tangling with each other and falling. The crowd gave a collective gasp.
Harry stiffened briefly, but almost immediately closed his eyes and kissed Draco back with as much enthusiasm as he could muster, curling his arms around Draco and settling his hands into Draco’s hair.
But that's nonsense. It's not like they were friends or even acquaintances. They hadn't even really talked, for fuck's sake. They were merely former classmates, former enemies. Of course, Potter wouldn't go out of his way to continue this little routine. It had just been a coincidence that they were at the cafe at the same time for several days in a row. Draco put it out of his head as best he could.
Draco smiled. Harry had been right, of course, another publisher did want to talk. He quickly penned a response, making an appointment for the following morning. He tied the letter to the little brown owl, who took off out the window.
“Some. But it’s hard to practice since I don’t own one myself. That’s one of the reasons I picked up guitar. Much easier to tote around places.”
After a while, Harry stood from his chair and walked to Draco’s. He put his hands on each armrest and whispered into Draco’s ear, “Right now, I want to do you.”
Harry rolled his eyes and started rummaging through cabinets. His shirt lifted at the waist some when he reached up, and Draco quickly looked away.
Draco knew she was right. Pansy always had a way of pulling him back upright, back to earth. He knew which way he should go, she just kicked him to start moving.
This is the epilogue to Beachwood Cafe. It's written as twelve snippets of Draco and Harry's life following the end of the story.
“Yes.” Harry grinned. “I remember thinking it was stunning, and we even came back while hunting for horcruxes. Despite being on the run, I felt at peace that night. So now I just come here when I need a break from it all.”
He hadn't seen that face, that unruly mop of hair, those round glasses in over three years. Except in the Prophet, of course. They were never short on articles about Harry's life (or what they imagined it was as he seemed to keep fairly private) that they liked to pass off as "journalism."
“Right then, who the bloody hell is coming here…” Draco muttered to himself, checking his watch as he reached for the door.
“Please, Merlin no.” Draco cringed. “Mother plays that trifle constantly at the Manor. I used to put a silencing charm around my room to get some reprieve.”
“See you tomorrow Draco,” Harry said, standing. He placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezed as he passed, heading out to the front door to apparate home.
His thoughts were cut off by a kiss. It wasn’t forceful or needy, it was soft and sweet and full of love. Harry held Draco’s face like it was made of glass, kissed him like he was the sweetest thing he’d ever tasted.
That last bit though, that's some good shit. In case you don't recognize it, it's basically an imitation of their very first (book) meeting at Madam Malkin's before first year started.
“Well, you should try some of each. Wait, no, that’s too many flavors mixing. You’ll have to go in stages,” Harry was in his element apparently. He turned to grab two plates from a cabinet.
“Agatha came back without an answer, so I wasn’t sure…” Harry was running his hand through his hair, nervous.
“Draco, that’s brilliant!” Harry and George Weasley had just recently made a deal together to start a new Quidditch gear and broomstick line at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes that Harry was to endorse.
Draco’s fingers practically itched with the song. He gave once last look out at the canyon—their canyon—and apparated to where they’d stashed the brooms. Grabbing both from the bushes, he held on tight and apparated back home, setting the brooms down in favor of his guitar.
Draco nodded. Harry smiled and gave a sort of wave as he collected his food and sat on the armchair near the door.
Harry started, “So, uh…” He ran his hand through his hair. “Do you use some sort of spell to shave?”
Now Draco was pointing out constellations to Harry. “Do you ever think about the future?” Harry asked.
“And what, exactly, are we going to see?” Draco asked. “Where are we?” The trees had disappeared behind them and they were steadily making their way up a grassy hill.
When Draco woke up late that Sunday, he decided to spend the morning playing a new melody he was trying to remember. Harry wouldn’t be done at the Burrow until later, and Draco had promised to bring dinner over to Grimmuald Place.
Harry walked them off to the side, away from the path, and sat down. His legs dangled over the edge and he leaned back on both hands. Draco wanted to keep this picture in his mind at all times
"There’s a muggle parking lot back that way,” Harry said, pointing in one direction. “We are going this way.” Harry hid the brooms behind some bushes and started down the path.
Draco knew he shouldn’t have kissed Harry like that, not in public. What was worse was that Harry would have easily forgiven it, but then Draco had to go and say all of that. Accuse Harry of using him for sex, of hiding him and hiding their relationship.
It wasn’t enough. He couldn’t get enough of Harry. His hands, his mouth were on Draco. His stubble was scratching Draco’s skin, body pressing Draco into the bed.
Harry pulled Draco back in close, his head laying on Harry’s chest. “S’okay. You will one day,” he grinned into Draco’s hair.
“Serves Dudley right, I think,” Draco said, finishing the hot chocolate. He frowned into his mug, not realizing he was so close to being done, and set it on the side table.
He tried not to worry, he really did. But Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Potter had decided not to risk being seen out and about with Draco.
Harry went straight for the kitchen, set the bag on the counter, and began taking out various containers.
“Yes, but I’m afraid you aren’t as young as you once were. And you’ll probably already regret all this in the morning,” Harry said, steering Draco towards the door.
They walked up the aisle and stood at the front of the church. The wedding march played and Draco vaguely remembered thinking how beautiful Pansy looked in her dress.
"I didn't mean anything by it. I remember you were always good at Potions," said Harry. He paused, seeming to be waiting for Draco to say more. "What's with the notes then?"
“You first, Parkinson,” Draco said. He could tell she was hiding something and knew fine and well that she’d already noticed he was too.
Draco rolled back over and decided to ignore everything. Maybe if he pretended that last night hadn’t happened… Maybe if he pretended the last few months never happened…
Once out on the street, he pointed himself toward the Beachwood, hoping Harry was there as promised. He tossed the manuscript in the nearest bin and cast a quick incendio.
Draco was placing lazy kisses to Harry’s neck before rolling off to the side, wandlessly muttering a cleaning spell.
“I don’t know if I can. I said some things… Pans, he’s so brilliantly bright and I’m like the darkness pulling him back down. I thought I could be better, that he’d make me lighter, but I can’t. And then what I accused him of…”
“Very funny. I was shopping for furniture for the flat, and the old bag that runs Faun’s Fantastic Furnishings kept asking me so many questions. Do I like Queen Anne or Mid Century Modern, would I prefer walnut or English oak, would I be needing a pair of fauteuils for the morning room…” Draco took a long sip of his hot chocolate then sighed.
After an hour or so of surprisingly comfortable silence, where Draco somehow actually managed to get a decent start on the chapter about the relationship between Potions and Herbology, Harry checked his watch and started to pick up his things.
They had been walking down Diagon Alley towards the Leaky Cauldron to meet some friends when they’d noticed the photographer. Draco was in his suit and sunglasses and looked like he’d just stepped out of a Witch Weekly ad. Harry, on the other hand, immediately made a funny face and made like he was fighting off some invisible assailant, throwing fake punches and kicking the air.
Draco had ordered an aged scotch when they’d first arrived, but Harry had brought him a pint when he’d finished, telling him it was two for one.
Draco laid back down in the grass, pulling Harry on top of him. Their kisses soon turned lazy and Harry started kissing down Draco’s neck.
Draco grinned. “Thank you for your question, Mr. Potter. I think what helped most was hot chocolate and an annoying friend.”
“I lost track of the time, and besides, it’s not like we plan to meet every day,” Draco answered smoothly, sitting down and casting a quick warming charm on his now cold mug.
“We’ll want further works, of course. We can’t very well publish a Level 1 textbook without planning for consecutive levels. There would be a timeline for those, so you would have to agree to have drafts ready by certain deadlines. And of course, we also would hope you’ll agree to some marketing events, speaking at several upcoming Potions conventions, interviewing for
“Feels a bit…” Harry trailed off. “Obscene, really. You fucking me and leaving.” He made a face at Draco.
"I'm writing a textbook. Or at least trying to. I doubt any publishers will want to associate themselves with a Malfoy. But the research gives me something to do, keeps my mind focused."
Draco cleared his throat and decided to change the subject quickly, derailing that train of thought that would lead nowhere good.
“Very well. Harry” Draco arched his eyebrows, picked up his pen, and started skimming down the lines of his book.
Narcissa stopped and put her hands on Draco's arms. "I want you to be happy, darling," she said sternly.
Just then, Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini walked in, talking something about the goblins at Gringotts. They both worked there in different capacities. Pansy smiled at Theo as he kissed her cheek.
Six weeks before the new Hogwarts term was to start, Draco’s textbook was released and he was at Flourish & Blotts for a Q&A and book signing. The publisher told him that this was the largest pre-order they had ever received. Having the book as a required Hogwarts text helped.
Draco met Harry back in front of the record shop 15 minutes later. He had waited in line at the sandwich shop, and then had to change his usual order as they were out of salami.
Draco walked over to his armchair, lost in thoughts and memories of Harry for the remainder of the evening.
Friday rolled around and Draco absentmindedly grabbed a few books to bring to the Beachwood. He apparated to Diagon Alley and started making his way towards the cafe, still thinking of Harry.
Draco groaned and closed his eyes. Harry took that opportunity to tweak Draco’s nipple. “Potter,” Draco practically growled.
"We don't have to talk or anything," Harry said quickly. "I have some things I should do, and you can work on whatever it is you work on."
“No matter, it should all be delivered in a few days. For the amount of galleons I gave them, they should come up with something suitable.” Despite his complaints, Draco was actually looking forward to moving in and having a place of his own. It felt like freedom was just waiting around the corner.
“Did the English Oak Queen Anne phatooey look good in the morning room?” Harry teased as Draco came in at the end of the week.
Draco thought. He unclasped the window and the owl woke, startled. She nipped at Draco’s finger when he reached to bring her inside.
But Draco was just as guilty of all that, wasn’t he? He hadn’t told his friends, his mother about Harry. He hadn’t asked what they were, hadn’t defined their relationship. In essence, he was using Harry for sex and way to pass the time. Except that wasn't what Harry was to him.
“Blaise and Theo figured it out on their own in school. I told Pansy in fifth year when she wouldn’t stop hanging off me, trying to get me to sneak off and make out with her.”
Draco hoped Harry was right. But Harry didn’t see the looks he still got when he walked through Diagon Alley. He didn’t hear the curses people spit at him when he tried to go into some shops. People hadn’t forgotten, they didn’t see.
When it was about time to leave, Harry reached for one of the book stacks. “Right then, I’ll take these.”
He also wanted to show Harry the flat. He’d helped pick it, after all. But Draco wasn’t sure how Harry would react if he asked. They hadn’t really talked about what they were to each other. Were they friends now? It was okay to ask a friend over to your house, right? He’d had Blaise, Pansy and Nott over for champagne when he’d closed.
Harry shifted in the bed to get comfortable, pulling Draco to lay in the crook of his arm and kissing the top of his head.
Maybe it was the alcohol or the long day or the way Harry said it was a good idea, but Draco actually considered it. “Hmm,” was all he said as answer.
. He wondered if they were new. Draco proceeded to open the other packages, all containing what seemed to the be entire works of several different bands—The Beatles, Foreigner, Britney Spears, The Police, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Tom Petty, Tupac, Kansas, Pink Floyd, The Notorious B.I.G., Weezer.
And he was itching to pick up his guitar and work on some melodies that were floating around in his head.
Draco put down his mug and pen and sat back to consider his answer. "Not really. I might have a sweet tooth, and Mother doesn't usually serve anything but tea. And, don't ever tell her I said this, but quite frankly I hate tea."
Draco hadn’t realized he was crying. Harry held Draco there for a few minutes, shushing and swaying them slightly.
Draco set the guitar down and pulled Harry into his lap, putting everything he was back in to that kiss. They ended the kiss but stayed close, foreheads pressing against each other.
“Oh, right,” Harry said, pulling his eyes away from Draco’s and hopping off the counter. He fumbled with the knobs on the stove, and poured the water into his mug. He looked at the milk on the stove and grimaced. “I think I’ve burned it.”
Harry smiled, then crawled into Draco’s lap and wiped the remnants away for Harry before placing a long, slow kiss to his mouth. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, holding him close and content to make out in the early afternoon sun.
“While you are here, I would like to discuss this with you.” She eyed him for a little. Draco couldn’t help but squirm in his seat, like he had been caught not paying attention in class.
“I told you so. I do have good ideas once in a while. Though technically it was my therapist’s idea,” he said cheerily, taking a sip of his zavarka tea. “Yikes, this needs...something,” he said as he got up to talk to the barista.
As they were passing a small alley between shops, he settled for dragging Harry into the alley, pushing him up against the wall and snogging him.
. It was another in a long line of articles speculating on the nature of his and Harry’s relationship.
Lee nodded at Draco, who was on the stage with his guitar. Hannah had found out he sang during a late night truth or dare game (that included several shots of firewhiskey) at their flat, and had begged him to sing for their first dance.
“Now, I know that we all have a lot of history from back in school, but Draco and I have talked about all of that. I stand by what I said about him at the trials. We understand each other. And,” Harry turned to look at Draco, “I love him.”
Theo looked like he might be sick. It was finally his wedding day, and Draco and Blaise were groomsmen. “I get why you didn’t do all this Blaise. Too much pressure on one day.”
Harry stepped out of the shower. Draco leaned back against the wall, letting the water wash over his head. Once he’d floated back down to earth, he finished his shower and got dressed.
“This last one…” Draco thought about what he wanted to say. “This last one I wrote after one of the happiest days of my life.”
Draco’s thoughts were centered on Harry. He’d kissed him. Harry had kissed back. But then he didn’t mention it again the rest of the night, carrying on as if nothing had happened. But he did stay, didn’t run screaming from Draco’s flat.
Draco and Neville had long since finished their drinks but were still happily discussing the finer details of the store. Neville had decided to start his own magical plants shop, selling all kinds of different plants and herbs useful to wizards for potions and other uses. He’d asked Draco a potions-related question one day and the two became fast friends.
The others made their way from the box, heading to the Burrow for the celebration party. “I’ll be along in a bit, going to find Harry,” Draco told Hermione as they left.
“Harry,” Harry gave Draco a look that said ‘you know better by now,’ ignoring Draco’s comment. Harry sat, then patted the rug next to him.
Hours later, just before midnight, Harry raised his glass and addressed the crowd in the garden. Ron and Hermione were close by, Rose sleeping soundly on Ron’s shoulder. Blaise had his arms wrapped around Ginny’s shoulders, both swaying to the music. The large portion of the Weasley clan was there—Arthur and Molly, George and Angelina, even Charlie had come in from Romania for the holidays. Pansy and Hannah were comparing wedding notes and ideas while Neville and Theo were animatedly discussing bank loans and the legal aspects of opening a shop. Narcissa was teaching Teddy how to dance a waltz, while Andromeda watched on. Luna was passing along little hats, noise makers, and 2003 shaped glasses to everyone.
His mind was already humming a new melody, shifting from the sadness of his last song to the hope he now felt.
Harry leaned casually against the wall, just out of Draco’s view in the mirrors. He was admiring the sight before him. His fiancé. His love. And he was taken back to all those years ago, struck with the memory that this was the first place they met.
When Harry yawned, Draco vanished the empty containers and summoned some pillows and a book. He leaned back against the bookcase and made himself comfortable, then patted his lap for Harry to lay down.
They sat in their chairs, sipping on their warm drinks and listening to several Queen albums, commenting on lines that stood out and drifting into natural conversation. When it was getting close to supper time, Harry stood up and stretched.
“God knows why you even bother to go out with me at all, the risk must be so high for you, Potter.” He was on a roll now, he wasn’t going to stop. “Why don’t you just go home to that Weaslette, and stop trying to be the Savior of everything. I was perfectly happy before you traipsed in and dumped all your baggage on me and then tried to fix me.”
Draco glanced over at Harry who was smiling and waiting for Draco to apparate them away. He searched Harry’s eyes for a moment, trying to find something to give away a change, a reason they weren’t sitting at their table at the Beachwood.
Before he realized what he was doing, Draco had taken several long strides across the kitchen, took Harry’s face in his hands and kissed him hard.
They sat together talking for a few hours, happy just to be in each other’s company. In their own little world for a bit, while the rest of the world waited.
Draco made his way into the hallway, shutting the door behind him. He leaned his head back against it for a moment, taking a deep breath. He could feel his mind going to places he didn’t want to think about.
They passed a couple holding hands and Draco wished he could hold Harry’s. Wished that he could tell the world about them.
They shared a lingering kiss in front of the fireplace before Harry, almost unwillingly, let go and flooed home.
“Come to the Beachwood when you’re done. I’ll wait for you, and then we can celebrate,” Harry kissed Draco and straightened his tie for him.
“Harry. I’m sure you can manage yourself fine,” Harry joked, “but these books are another story. And you don’t have to. I can help.”
“Potter helped find me a flat in London since he knows the area well. Just drew up the papers today.” It wasn’t technically a lie.
Draco gave Harry a small smile, then turned to get two mugs. He filled one with boiling water and one with boiling milk, wondering the if this whole day was going to feel so awkward.
As if Draco’s thoughts grumbled loud enough for Harry to hear, Harry quickly made his pick and ordered. The Beachwood Cafe had come up with a new marketing scheme to get more people in—Around the World in 80 Cups. There was a new cup of coffee or tea to try from 80 different places around the world, and for some god forsaken reason, Harry had insisted he try them all.
“But maybe this can be a date. Officially. I think we’ve had enough of skirting around talking about what this is. What we are.”
Harry huffed and plopped down onto his chair, grumbling something to himself that Draco couldn’t quite make out. This Harry—angry Harry—reminded Draco of year’s past.
“Ahem, everyone. While we have you all here,” he glanced down at Ginny beside him, “we wanted to let you all know that Ginny and I are married. We eloped last week while we were in France. Cheers!” Blaise downed his champagne.
Just as he said it, Arthur and Charlie were helping Molly sit down while Angelina fanned her with a napkin. “My baby girl… married! Oh! And I didn’t even get to plan the wedding!”
This time, it was Draco looking into Harry’s eyes when they looked up. “I didn’t know.” Harry was not only the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, the Prophet’s favorite subject. But he had given his life for the wizarding world.
“Of course,” Draco got up and waved his wand at the fireplace, altering his floo network wards to give access to Grimmuald Place. He gestured for Harry to step forward once he was done, returning to stand by his chair.
“Yes. It took a few moments to make sure none of them fell off mid-apparation. Can’t always be sure where things will end up if you lose them mid jump.” Draco had never been very good at sizing charms and didn’t want to risk destroying the books to make them smaller and more manageable to carry.
Three days after the incident, Pansy came through Draco’s floo to find him sitting in his chair at 10 am still in his nightclothes and nursing a scotch.
Draco pulled a sock from the lampshade and looked over at Harry, sprawled out across the bed naked, taking up more space that should be possible. His hair was damp, stuck to his forehead.
“I know, I just…” Draco wasn’t sure why he was so nervous. This was the first time most of their friends would see Draco’s flat, and the first time anyone would see it since Harry had moved in a week ago. They’d decided to host a housewarming/New Year’s Eve party.
Draco’s hand was on his cheek where Harry had kissed. He smiled and sat back down in their spot, happy to stare out at the moon for a while, humming a soft tune.
“…we are both so glad that you all could come and are incredibly thankful to have each of you in our lives.” Lifting his glass higher, Harry finished, “May your troubles be less and your blessings be more, and nothing but happiness come through your door.”
Draco almost stopped as soon as he opened the door, wavering slightly and trying to keep his expression neutral. There, at his table, was Harry Potter.
He quickly flipped them around and pushed Harry onto the bed, leaning to grab the bottle of lube from the bedside table. He squirted a generous portion into his hand, using it to slick his own cock then to do the same to Harry’s. Harry sharply pulled in a breath when Draco’s fingers wrapped around him.
“I thought you might be hungry,” Harry said, running his hand through his hair and holding up a bag.
Draco turned back some to look up at Harry. “I did. What are you doing here?” he asked curiously. He set the guitar next to the bench and made room for Harry to sit. Despite the new space, Harry sat as close to Draco’s side as possible, cuddling into the nook of his arm and draping his legs over Draco’s leg.
He remembered the way Harry’s jaw had felt beneath his hands. The stubble from a few days of not shaving. Draco only wished he’d run his hands through that unruly, unreasonable, sexy hair.
“No, I’ll get all this. You brought dinner,” Draco shooed Harry away from the table. Harry looked like he was just about to say thank you when Draco flicked his wand and the dishes flew into the sink and stacked themselves to be cleaned later.
As he leaned down to pick them up, he heard his wards chime. Someone was coming up the path to the doorstep.
Draco reached for Harry, but Harry batted his hand away. “Damnit Harry, I just want to kiss you, for fuck’s sake. I couldn’t give a shit who sees. But don’t worry, I get it. You do care.”
Draco could feel himself grinning. And, for the first time since this whole thing with Harry began, he wasn’t falling anymore. He’d already fallen.
Agatha flew off with the response and Draco sat down with his guitar, hot chocolate long forgotten, and started to play all the songs he wanted to sing for Harry, making sure he remembered them. Hoping that Harry would understand, would hear what Draco was trying to say in each of them.
“Better now that she’s gone home. I think mum was driving her mad. You know how she gets,” fire Ginny grinned and Harry huffed a laugh.
Draco had to hand it to Luna, she definitely did things her way. He was glad to have their news out via the Quibbler first, knowing that Prophet would only write near-truths. And he couldn’t help but staring at the picture she’d taken.
“I tried so many different coffees, I feel like I forgot what a decent cup of black coffee tastes like,” he explained to Draco one day.
“Potter?” Draco called. He’d just stepped through the floo into Grimmuald Place, unsure of where Harry was or even what part of the house he was in.
“In Azkaban? Yes. He will be until he dies, I suppose.” Draco wasn’t bitter anymore. While he wishes things could have been different, Harry was right. He had just been a child. Why would his father lie or be wrong about something? He just wishes he’d realized it much sooner.
Draco went to stand in front of Harry, then gently placed his hands on Harry’s jawline and kissed him slowly.
“Yeah, that. Isn’t it delicious? Like a donut, but better.” Harry waited for Draco to agree, looking expectant.
“Come off it, Potter, you have no idea how to take a normal picture,” Draco sipped his hot chocolate and took the Business section from Harry.  “Besides, we all know you do it on purpose.”
“So, I hadn’t gotten you a housewarming present yet, and finally decided what you needed,” he said, placing the packages on the floor.
At that moment, Luna Lovegood walked in to the Beachwood Cafe. Draco felt like his heart had stopped, and his brain was immediately trying to find an excuse to save Harry from lying to his friends.
Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed, smiling. He half waved at Draco to come back to their table, but Draco kept singing. “It ain't my fault that I'm out here getting loose, Gotta blame it on the Goose, Gotta blame it on my juice, baby.”
“Well, I think. Coping. Despite what he was, I think she still misses father.” Draco didn’t talk much about Lucius, but he knew his mother missed him.
He shrugged out of his suit jacket and went to the kitchen to make a hot chocolate. Just as he was adding in more marshmallows than could really fit, he heard the owl scratching at the windowpane.
"Anything really. Nothing. Sometimes I just write to write. After the... well, after. Someone recommended I write. So, I started writing letters to my mum. Just got things off my chest. Then to Sirius and my dad. Hermione said I should consider writing my side of what happened."
Draco stopped playing. He thought about what he’d said to Pansy. That Harry was the light and he was the dark. He started playing again, a new song this time.
Draco was staring, wide-eyed, when Hermione noticed him and gave a little, “Oh.” That got the attention of the others, who all turned to look.
They both turned to look as a loud sound came from behind them. A Jack Russell terrier patronus was running towards them.
He half wished Harry would drag him back into bed. Kiss him and convince him to stay, that Harry wanted him to stay.
“Sorry. It’s hard to forget.” Draco sighed. “I think about how much I could have done differently to stop him. Save some people. Do something.”
Harry glanced at his watch. "Shit, yeah, sorry. Team practice in a few. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?" Harry asked as he put on his jacket and tucked his notebook away.
“Hmm,” was all Draco provided as answer, not even glancing up at her. He was busy staring a hole into the record player.
The Queen songs are Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, the first two tracks of their first album.
Draco sat back in his chair and sipped on his hot chocolate, watching Harry as he talked to the barista. He was absentmindedly humming, watching the smile light up Harry’s face as he spoke. The barista was handing Harry a sample of something, which he ate happily.
The Falmouth Falcons had made it this year and were currently almost 6 hours into the match with Puddlemere United. The crowds were cheering, watching Harry and Benjy Wiliams, Puddlemere’s Seeker who’d famously caused a riot in a 1999 game against the Harpies, were in a race around the stands, weaving in between the other players and furiously sending glances at each other. They’d caught sight of the snitch.
Draco could feel himself tensing, preparing for the day of questions and accusations. And this was just saying they were friends, nothing more.
“Draco,” Harry said, standing in the doorway. He had an odd look in his eyes, torn between unsure and sad. He was holding an open letter.
“Why exactly did you leave the fast track to becoming the head of the Auror department to chase a snitch and…” Draco paused, gesturing at Harry’s sweaty clothes. “And smell?”
“She tried to be stern but was usually generally amused by it all. I found out later that father, on the other hand, punished the elves for it, claiming that they should have had more powerful magic than a child,” Draco shook his head.
“Fauteuil, and yes, but I had them covered in new pink upholstery to match the bathroom,” said Draco as he set down a precariously large stack of books.
Draco felt like sparks ought to be flying from the two of them. The room ought to be spinning. The kiss was hot and Harry was gorgeous.
“Still gives me plenty of time to have my way with you, Potter.” His hand moved to Harry’s ass as he kissed his neck.
Draco tucked the letter from Harry into his notebook full of lyrics. He then tore out a blank page and wrote back to Harry.
Harry was waving him over to a small shop a few doors down from the cafe. It was a record shop Draco had never been in before.
Harry laughed at that. Draco smirked, knowing just how ridiculous that argument was. He looked at Harry who was wiping his eyes, still letting out small laughs.
She stood up, looking at him for a bit. “Now I suggest you go out there and tell Potter that he’s that happiness. Heaven knows you've been pining over him since school.”
He watched her fly out of the garden before looking down at the letter. There was nothing written on the outside. He broke the seal and unfolded it.
Draco returned from the Manor late in the evening, having told his mother about the publication deal. She had insisted on a full seven-course meal and champagne to celebrate.
“I…I’m sorry, I didn’t realize when I opened it…” Draco hadn’t seen Harry at a loss for words like this in a long time. He put the broth down and held out his hand for the letter.
Harry laughed. “Well, these are a pretty wide variety, so hopefully you’ll find something you like. Queen is one of my favorites. Freddie Mercury, the lead singer, is fantastic. There’s a few in there I’m not sure you’ll like much, but…” Harry shrugged.
Draco looked down to soak in the sight before him. There, on his knees with Draco’s dick in hand, was Harry Potter.
Thanks for reading, y'all. Especially since this is a WIP. After some outlining, I'm thinking about 15 or so chapters.
He could feel himself getting close, quickening his pace and Harry tried to pull his hips even closer, if that was possible. He pulled away from the kiss, burying his face in Harry’s neck, feeling their sweat mix together.
Draco lifted his head to look at Harry through the mirror, eyes bright. “Yes,” he responded, echoing Harry’s answer.
"...should start thinking about settling down," Narcissa was saying. He'd heard this speech a thousand times. Find a wife and produce an heir, proudly carry on the family name. Though there wasn't too much left of that, no thanks to his father's choice of side during the wars. And since his father had been carted off to Azkaban, his mother even seemed okay with the idea of him finding a husband after he’d mentioned once that the wife part was highly unlikely.
He knew he had so much to say, and they would definitely talk when he saw Harry next, but there was something he could do to apologize. To start apologizing and show he was sorry.
“Theo’s asked me to marry him,” Pansy said, smiling broadly and holding out her hand with the engagement ring she’d been hiding.
Picture-Harry was laughing at something Draco had just said, and picture-Draco turned to look at him, smiling. Draco could see every ounce of love in his eyes, the raw emotion conveyed through the tiny black and white magical loop.
“Hmm,” Draco responded. He looked up from his journal as Harry continued talking. He was sitting with his back to the door, and the light of this surprisingly warm spring day was streaming in perfectly through the window. It cast a golden aura around Harry, who seemed to glow.
Draco helped Blaise straighten his tie, then handed the cufflinks to Theo. There was a knock on the door, so Draco answered. “Five minutes, boy,” Pansy’s cousin told them.
The song started and Draco did indeed sing. He’d never done karaoke before, but he quite liked the small crowd in front of him dancing and drinking and singing along.
"Maybe," Draco answered. He took another long sip of his hot chocolate. It was close to when Harry usually picked up his things and left. "I used to write songs."
Harry and Draco set the books down on the kitchen counter when they came in. Harry started to look around a little, so Draco offered to show him the place.
Harry was still standing in the doorway to the kitchen when Draco finished. He took his tea with a mumbled ‘thanks’ and turned towards the morning room.
“No Quidditch plays today?” Draco asked after a few minutes of silence. He was too distracted to really get much done today. Lyrics and melodies were still floating through his head, and he itched the write them down. But also didn’t want to chance Harry reading anything. They were rather personal, he wasn’t holding anything back.
“Yeah. Like Agatha Christie? The murder mystery novelist?” Harry smirked. “She’s muggle, I’m not surprised…”
Harry’s fingers were lightly tracing over each scar. Draco held Harry’s hand over his own heart, letting him feel the rapid beating, stilling them both for a moment. After a moment, Draco shifted under Harry and unintentionally moved against Harry’s hardness.
“Oh, well.” Harry ran his hand through his hair and shrugged. It was a nervous thing he did, Draco noted, any time the conversation turned to his life. “It was a lot of politics. I was a glorified figurehead. They just wanted The Chosen One to show off at political events.”
Draco climbed on top of Harry, straddling him and fitting their penises to rub together and starting up a steady rhythm. He wrapped his hand around as much of both of them as he could manage. Harry quickly added his own hand. He immediately found Harry’s lips again, kissing him like he’d been doing it for years.
“Make sure to point your wand exactly where you need it lest you find your eyebrows disappear, too.” Pretty much all the boys in the Slytherin dormitory had to learn that the hard way in sixth year when Blaise had told them about the spell.
Two weeks later, Draco had ambushed Harry in his living room, flooing to Grimmuald Place as soon as he’d finished reading the letter.
“I don’t do well when I have too much time on my hands. I need distractions, and Quidditch takes up a ton of my time. And there’s only so many times I can visit Hermione and Ron. They need their alone time and I feel like a bother.”
Olivia took over picking who could ask the questions from there. Draco answered as best he could. The next person Olivia called on started their question and Draco searched the crowd for the familiar voice.
Harry came walking into the morning room, holding an empty box of tea. “I thought you said you’d get more when you were out?” Harry was in a mood too, it seemed.
*Thunk* “Damnit,” Draco cursed as a pile of wizarding history books fell over. He’d stepped back to reconsider whether his Transfiguration texts fit best in their own section or should be included with other basic wandwork texts.
Draco groaned and put his hand over his eyes. The light was streaming through the window onto his pillow.
“Of course it is, Draco, it's sweet,” Harry said, as if he’d known all along which Draco would pick.
Later that night while Draco and Harry were dancing, Harry said, “You know, Luna mentioned to me earlier that you should consider releasing an album. I think it’s a good idea.”
Harry looked at the bill of sale in his hands. “Wait, you got the flat? You have a flat!” He reached across the table and squeezed Draco’s hand. “I’m so happy for you. This will be good for you, I think.”
“I’ve sent the manuscript to four different publishers already. I really don’t expect to hear back from any of them.”
I think posting more chapters is making me write more because I have less and less stashed away. Anyway, I feel like I should remind everyone of the disclaimer that I am not British.
The door chimed and several people made their way through the door and to the counter. Draco glanced up, surprised to see so many people in at this hour.
Draco woke before the sun the next morning. He lay in bed staring at his ceiling for a while, trying to pull the last memories of his dream back to him before they slipped away completely.
, he thought. He made a move to grab his wand to check the time, then immediately stopped and groaned again. He felt like shit.
Angry at himself and still feeling awful, Draco rolled back over and fell back asleep. Avoiding everything seemed like the best course of action at the moment.
“Yes,” he answered into Draco’s neck. Draco smiled, and wrapped his arms tighter around Harry. He wasn’t going to let go and push him away this time.
They were both sitting at the kitchen bar and talking, having finished their meals. Harry got up and started grabbing at plates.
“Sorry…” He started nibbling at the bacon, partly for something to do and partly because he hadn’t had any real food in ages.
And third, Harry was also boiling water. There was a second cup and a box of tea next to him on the counter. Draco didn’t own tea. Harry had brought his own box of tea to Draco’s. Harry wanted to make sure there was tea in Draco’s flat for when he came over. Harry intended to be here enough to constitute bringing his own box of tea.
“Look at this one,” Harry said, sliding the paper over to Draco. Ever since he mentioned looking for a place to move, Harry had taken it upon himself to find the perfect place.
Seeing the time, Neville bid farewell to Draco, who decided to stop at a few shops to pick up things to cook for dinner. He and Harry had been testing out new curry recipes, experimenting to find the right flavors.
Draco spent the next few hours reading and running his hands through Harry’s hair. Sometimes he would pause at a chapter and just watch Harry breathing. He wondered about their times at Hogwarts, if they could have been friends. He wondered why they were now, all things considered. But he was glad for it and made a decision to treasure these moments. He tried not to think about how things would be if they could tell their friends about their relationship.
“It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Neville Longbottom!” Lee Jordan’s voice boomed with his sonorus spell. The guests applauded as Neville led Hannah onto the dance floor.
A few minutes passed and he could hear footsteps coming down the stairs. Harry’s face popped around the corner a moment later.
From then on, every picture that the Prophet published of Harry showed him sporting the new purple and orange WWW Quidditch jerseys.
Harry sat back with Draco, offering a bite of whatever sample he’d been given to try. Draco took it and made a face.
He turned and looked at the empty space beside him in the bed where Harry had been the morning before.
Draco watches as Harry leans over his body, hands braced on either side of Draco’s head. He kissed Draco lightly, then leans back to lift the shirt over Draco’s head, tossing it haphazardly across the room. He breathes in, staring wide-eyed at Draco’s scars.
Draco missed this. He missed their table and he missed his mornings with Harry. He missed the hot chocolate and missed making fun of Harry’s drink choices.
Draco kept strumming the guitar, making little adjustments here and there. He slowed a bit and looked up at the record player, which had one of the Tom Petty records Harry had given him on it. He’d listened to it this morning.
Though she didn’t sound like she was judging them, Draco didn’t want her telling any of Harry’s other friends that they’d been together. Harry probably didn’t want them to know.
Draco looked over at Harry, suddenly overwhelmed with love. He wanted to thank Harry for bringing him tonight, for putting up with him, for talking to him, and for helping him get home. All he managed was a garbled, “Thanks, love.” He was definitely drunk.
