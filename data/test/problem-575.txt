“This is exactly how I make my tea how did you know?” Draco asked tilting his head to the side while looking at Adrian. The werewolf fought to keep the blush from remerging on his face while he fetched his own tea casting a nonverbal wandless heating charm to reheat his tea. He didn't answer the blonde since that would mean he had to admit that he paid far too much attention to him during meal times in the Great Hall. So instead Adrian returned to his seat and countered with, “you didn't answer my question.”
“ I knew we were mates about a few months later however since he was only 4 and adjusting to being a werewolf I waited until he was 15 to start courting. My father cautioned being careful since Voldemort was trying to recruit werewolves to his war and I became a target due to leaving my familial pack to start my own. I want better treatment for my kind however I knew that I wouldn’t get that by following someone who wasn’t even human and sane any longer, besides war wasn’t going to stop me from having a family and carrying on my family’s Legacy. And I knew Remus had a pack of friends that would  protect him.” He looked over at Lucius and Severus briefly then pressed on before he was interrupted once again. “ Remus and I mated after he graduated Hogwarts then shortly after he fell pregnant with Adrian. I was still being pursued by Death Eaters and with the discovery of that prophecy… Lily had already been pretending to be pregnant to protect her friend against those that thought werewolves producing naturally was an abomination.
He didn't know why he always sat there to look into the fire, he knew it would lull him to sleep and that was the last thing he wanted to do. Sleep meant nightmares and that meant less energy than he had before. But his room, despite his efforts to keep it as messy and disorganized as he could, it still always seemed to resemble his room in the manor.
"Draco, hey look at me." Harry climbed onto the bed and kneeled in front of the blond. He slowly reached forward and tried to remove Draco's hands from his hair. "Draco, let go of your hair. You're hurting yourself, please stop." Draco's eyes were glassy and obviously not seeing Harry sitting right in front of him.
Harry wanted to see Draco smiling again. He knew he would do everything he could think of to make it happen. He saw a glimpse of it before Draco turned out the lights of his room and the ceiling lit up with the charm, but it still looked pained.
Draco wasn't in his room at Hogwarts anymore, he was standing in the study, his fathers office, the dining room, the entry hall, looking past his fathers shoulders as he was being yelled at. When he focused on one spot hard enough he wouldn't flinch when a hand, foot, spell hit its mark and it would be over sooner.
But he was alive, he was free and none of what he was subjected to would be on his written record.
As soon as Harry started speaking Draco had a small smile on his face, it only grew the longer Harry talked and the longer he watched those green eyes and tanned skin.
"Yes."
Draco guided Potter to his bed and let him get situated before he cast silently a charm on his ceiling. A charm that was totally invisible with how bright it was. He had gotten very good at casting this particular charm without speaking, when the manor wasn't home anymore, just a place for monsters to torment others.
Draco nodded and his hands fell from his head. "Let's go."
ask if I can first. Everyone else just waits for me to do it, you don't." Harry laughed against the back of Draco's neck and for some reason it helped him relax. "Hermione apologized to me at breakfast today. She doesn't really get it, but she's trying to. She said she'd try and get Ron to too. When he finally swallows his pride, you think you'd be up for eating with us?"
That is until Harry's fingers traced over a different hateful message that was scribbled over the notes he was taking for that class. "How often does this happen?" His voice was so soft when he asked. Draco didn't answer. He looked at his bag out of the corner of his eye and felt his head hang. Logically Draco knew that Harry wasn't angry with him, but he still felt like he was about to get into trouble. "Why haven't I seen this happening when we have class together."
So, using everything he had left in him, he said
Harry told Draco to get into some comfy clothes and wait for him to get back. He left the room and was walking through the common room when Hermione called to him.
In fact, neither had said a word to the other since the second day of the term.
Harry walked out of his room, after looking up and down the hall, hoping to avoid any and all people. Once he was alone again, Draco decided to change into his pajamas. A t-shirt that was a little too big and an old pair of joggers. He looked around his room, debating if it was even worth cleaning up. Draco decided against it just as his door opened.
"It's okay, really. Everyone needs to break down every once in a while. I'm sorry for not realizing it sooner."
He took in a shuddering breath and held it before pushing it out, trying to push out most of his negative feelings with it. "I'm sorry." He whispered into the bed pushing down another wave of tears.
"I'm not gonna be a Auror." Harry said not long after they had settled. They were lying in pretty much the exact position as before, holding hands but not much contact besides that. "Only McGonagall knows. She's actually the one who brought it up. I've seen too much action and fighting and I wouldn't be able to handle anymore of it."
to. The memory itself isn't happy, but when I realized that, it made me happy. To know that we might not be friends, and you might never want to be my friend, but you'd still put yourself in front of me. Just because you want to."
He looked up to Potter and just stared. Potter had his eyes closed and his head was tilted so far back it looked uncomfortable. Potter readjusted how he was sitting so he was more slouched and looking into the fire as well. In doing so he shifted closer to Draco so their shoulders were touching and Potters knees were almost resting on Draco's thighs.
"Very well. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I have to shuffle some things around, but I'll send you two an owl with your new schedule before Monday. Enjoy your weekend."
He startled awake, the remnants of an all too familiar nightmare racing through his body, chasing away sleep with a rush of adrenaline. He had fallen asleep again. When he looked around the room, he guessed not much time had passed, no more than an hour since the last time he looked around the empty room.
Draco hummed lying back on the cool grass. The cold was seeping through his jumper, settling in his shoulders. The sky was getting darker and stars started to appear. Harry leaned back so he was resting on his elbows, watching Draco's face.
They stayed like that until it was easy to find constellations in the sky, even through the branches at the edge of the clearing. Draco, at one point starting running his hands through Harry's hair and it was beginning to lull him to sleep.
"You are." Concern flooded Harry's system. "Are you okay?"
"Hermione used to cut our hair when we were...running. Ron tried to return the favor once, but it looked worse than when it started. I evened it out for her. I used to cut my own hair, it's so much easier to do it when I  can actually see what I'm doing." Harry explained when he ran his finger through the now short hair. He brushed off all the hair that clung to Draco's night shirt then spelled the mess away.
Potter was the one to give the password for the portrait but other than that neither said a word. Draco didn't say anything when he gently grabbed Potter's wrist and pulled him to his room. As comfortable as their usual corner was, there were still too many people in the common room, half of whom had turned to look at them when they entered.
Harry flew back to the castle and went to grab Draco from his room. Hermione was coming down the stairs, on her way to Hogsmeade with Ron. "How did it go?" Harry asked, pausing on his way up.
As an answer, Draco grabbed Harry's hand again and pulled him back to his bed. This time they got under the covers and Draco didn't realize how cold he was before he wasn't anymore.
"Draco?" Bright green eyes came into view and Draco smiled so big his cheeks almost hurt with it.
The candles didn't provide much light, so with the room so dark, the charm Draco had cast glowed. It gave off more than enough light for Draco to make it back to his bed without tripping on anything. It also pulled Harry's attention, gave him something good to focus on.
Harry seemed to melt into his bed at the contact. "They don't trust you. They think you're gonna try something, trick me into doing something bad or something."
Draco let Harry hand him his plate and waited until Harry had his own plate in hand before starting to eat.
"That's good." Harry appreciated that he was using Hermione's first name now that they were on good terms. He felt his face fall when he remembered how Draco was acting when he came back. "What did you mean when you said this only happens in your dreams?"
He walked into the classroom just before Flitwick turned around to begin the class. He sat in the back of the class and took notes on autopilot.
Draco sighed and set his plate down, he had only eaten half of it, spending the rest of the time pushing the food around. "You and your friends have always been untouchable. The only half decent interaction I've had with all three of you was in the Room of Requirement while it was burning. You don't return my feelings, Hermione doesn't apologize, Weasley doesn't acknowledge that I exists for longer than it takes to insult me." Tears started running down his cheeks, but it was much calmer than Harry had been noticing the past few times. He pulled his knees up and hugged them, tucking his head. "The only time that anything remotely similar happens, is either when I'm sleeping or. . .worse. Good things don't happen to me, never have so why would that change now?"
Draco lied next to him and they watched the stars. Draco looked for the constellations he knew and made a few of them move, like they were coming to life. He didn't know the extent of Harry's astronomical knowledge, but he made Canis Major run around like a puppy until it bumped into Draco's namesake. Draco let the constellations move back into their places and just let Harry watch the stars.
Harry might have been falling asleep, but that offer had Draco siting up wide awake. Every wish he never had the chance or courage to daydream about exploding in his head. Lazy Sundays, slow mornings, nights by a fire with a quilt over their laps, evenings on the porch watching the sun go down, games of footsies at breakfast, laughing in a garden, hip checking each other while making dinner, sitting on a roof stargazing. Everything he couldn't afford to dream about keeping him quiet and still.
He felt something warm cover him, then a solid presence curl around him. Draco focused on those feelings, on the weight of an arm over his middle, of a hand gently pressing him back against that warmth. He focused on the even breaths of the body behind him, the steady rhythm of the heart beating and tried to get his body to mimic it.
Harry could see that Draco wasn't all there, but he didn't know how to ask about it without risking Harry close off even more and ruining their night. He wanted this night to be fun, or at least not a night of reminiscing. A night of making new, better memories to drown out all the bad ones.
Draco held Harry's hand tighter when he made to get up. It was nice not being alone, he didn't want to be alone again. "I'll be right back. Promise." Harry smiled, a small but real smile. Like the one he used to see before everything started going to hell. It had been such a long time since Draco had seen that smile and it shocked him at how much he missed it. He trusted that smile. Draco nodded and let him go.
When he woke up he was lying in bed properly. His head was resting on Harry's chest with one arm over his stomach and his leg over Harry's. Draco breathed out and felt something fluttering in his chest. He liked waking up like this. He wanted to wake up like as much as he could.
The tension returned to Draco's shoulders when he felt Harry's fingers run through his hair. It was getting longer and he hated it, he wanted it gone.
"Why that memory?" Harry's hand stilled in his hair.
The two walked next to each other as they made their way to potions and Draco found he was content with it. That realization tripped him, his foot catching on an uneven stone. Potter's grip, gentile but strong, was the only thing that kept him from falling to the ground. Potter only let go when he nodded in thanks, to say he was good.
Harry said their thanks and the two of them went back to the dorms. Harry followed Draco into his room and watched as he fell onto his stomach on his bed. He closed the door and lied on his back next to Draco. "Do you want to postpone our date to tomorrow?"
Pansy told him he didn't need to wait for her to finish, she was going to go talk to Luna once she was done, so Draco stood and walked back to his room. His mind was running with everything that was happening. Draco could understand the meaning behind the note he still had in his bag, but he was curious if more than just that one person thought that of him.
This was one of his favorite things about the evenings. Just being in the company of these two and not being expected to say a word or do more than just walk.
Potter. Bleeding heart and Savior of the wizarding world shared all his Tuesday classes.
The little clearing had a nice view of the lake without being visible to people on the shores. The only reason he found this place was because he was flying over it, looking for a place no one could bother him.
He just continued to stare into the fire.
Potter had approached him just before the trial that would determine his future and asked him a question that Draco doubted he even remembered, let alone knew how much of an impact it had on him.
"Yes?"
They both fell asleep not long after that.
As he was leaving he watched as Granger spoke to Harry and he actually faced her and nodded before saying something in return.
He could hear the whispers, feel the stares that followed him when he left the room and made his way back to the shared common room for everyone who had returned to their eighth year. He was used to it, of course. Being the son of one of the highest ranking Death Eaters and being branded as one, as well as being saved so publicly by the Chosen One painted him in a light that was too close to the spotlight for his liking.
Draco had already seen Adrian's wolf before during the full moon 3 weeks prior but there was just something about seeing him up close that left him breathless. The size of Adrian was completely different to his father and uncle, their alternate forms were double the size of a large wolf while Adrian could have easily been mistaken for the true wild animal except he was sleeker his body meant for running. The blonde slid from his chair to sit on the ground placing his wand on his thigh and held his hands out keeping his stance relaxed and very still so he didn't spook or agitate Adrian. He kept very still watching as Adrian slinked closer his nose constantly moving as he scented the air catching the fragrance of him. “You are so beautiful.” Draco murmured reaching out a hand keeping it open to let Adrian walk into it if he wanted which the wolf did running its cold wet nose along the skin then nuzzled it demanding pets. Draco scratched behind Adrian's ears then ran his hand down the length of his sleek body, they stayed in this position for a few minutes before Adrian loped back around the hedge to shift and returned fully dressed and smiling.
Adrian didn’t have time to react as he suddenly had his arms full of a shaking and sobbing Hermione, he automatically wrapped his arms around her rocking them back and forth or rubbing his hands up and down her back. Tears welled up in his eyes and he buried his face in her curly hair to hide them, when they’re crying finally stopped Adrian extract himself from her embrace, opening his mouth to say something only to let out a gasp when Hermione's balled up fist collided with his stomach. All the air rush out of his lungs while he bent over, there was a growl from Fenrir while Sirius’ body was shaking from his laughter. “Hermione wha-" Adrian gasp taking in deep gulps of air.
Fenrir let out a small sigh setting his mug down on the small table beside his chair before he got to his feet. Moving over to his son he got down on one knee so he was eye level with Adrian. “We aren't people cub we're wolves, acting on instinct will always be ingrained in us. So wanting to seek comfort from family, from pack when it's so close to the full moon is perfectly normal.” He ran a hand through his son's wild mop of hair, his boy had seen so much during the first 16 years of his life, it took moments like this to remind himself that Adrian was still so very young. “Also you can't tell me that you never experienced a puppy pile at least once before your seventeenth birthday, those baser instincts do not just vanish cub.”

“It doesn't sound embarrassing it sounds….. Nice.” Draco supplied shooting a small smile at Adrian to try and make the young werewolf less squirmy. He had to admit it sounded strange but then again he wasn't a werewolf so who was he to judge? Adrian relaxed a little smiling at the blonde in return while Sirius and Thayne exchanged knowing looks.
“Crass and mouthy as always, she sends her regrets on not being able to come here and help you and Fen.” Thayne replied pulling away from his nephew's hair then set him back on his feet and took a few minutes to straighten his clothes. Once he was satisfied Thayne stood with a groan stretching his 6'5 frame sighing as a few of his bones popped. “I bloody hate taking international portkeys I feel like I went through five cycles in a washing machine.” He complained earning a laugh from Adrian before he jumped up wrapping his arms around his uncle's broad shoulders in a proper hug. Eight years separated Fenrir and Thayne, it was obvious in both appearance and temperament. While Fenrir looked like he could be in his late 30's, Thayne looked like he was in his 20's instead of his actual age of 39. Like his older brother Thayne’s facial features were aristocratic with sharp cheek bones, a slender nose and a defined jaw, unlike Fenrir however the younger werewolf's mouth was always upturned into a smile that showed off his sharp canines and his midnight blue eyes were lit with mischief and humor.

“To continue where we left off as far as becoming friends I meant what I said 6 years ago Adrian I had always wanted us to be friends and I figured since your best friends are now my friends it might be a little bit easier.”
Adrian let out another wheeze squeezing his arms around the redhead's back fighting back tears once more. The two stayed in that embrace for a few minutes more before finally pulling away their eyes a little red tinged from repressed tears. “ Just to let you know Hermione my kidnapping was not my fault if you want to punch someone look to my no-good Godfather who decided to take me while I was unconscious. He’s the one to blame for my initial disappearance however the reason we had to stay away for so long will be explained in due time. Also I know it's a lot to ask of you all but I don't go by Harry anymore, my birth name is Adrian Sebastian Greyback.” He explained snapping his fingers to remove the glamor, the transformation much quicker than before as the young wizard had been going for dramatic effect raven black hair lightened up to snowy white. The light grey Henley and dark wash jeans became well fitted once more while eyes flashed gold briefly then settled to the striking icy blue. Finally he grew the two inches he gained from his inheritance then shook his body out, wearing that glamor felt like having oil on his skin.
“I've been waiting for almost 22 years Black I cannot wait any longer.” Fenrir replied softly reaching to one of the side tables where a bag of floo powder was waiting. Tossing some in he spoke clearly; “Hogwarts Headmasters Office.” Then threw the envelope inside. “It's not fair that Adrian should wait any longer either.”

“ To this day I regret telling James to trust Peter, I paid for my mistake for 12 years in the cell beside yours cranky wolf.” He griped his hand flexing instinctively like he wanted to hex Fenrir.

“I’m finally glad you grew some balls Ron and propose to Hermione been far too long in my opinion and the ring is absolutely gorgeous. Who helped you pick it out?” Adrian teased knowing that as much as he loved his best friend he had absolutely no taste when it came to the jewellery and judging by the fact that the redheads ears when bright red he know it as well.
me. Without acting like it's a favor to cash in later. And that day you saved me from those two without asking me, without waiting for me to ask, you just did because you
Draco nodded and let their hands drop.
"An arctic fox." Draco started drawing circles on Harry's chest where his hand was resting.
Harry looked to Draco as he nodded. He pulled out his noted for one of his classes and set it on her desk before turning his hands over to show her the scrapes that were still sore.
"Can I kiss you now that there are no misunderstandings?" Draco nodded and Harry leaned down, pressing his lips to Draco's. It was warm and unhurried, both moving together like they had done that a million times before. It left them both smiling when they pulled apart, Harry rested his head on Draco's chest and listened to his heart beating. It was a little fast, but it was safe to assume it was because of the kiss and nothing else.
Harry pushed them off the ground and into the sky. The wind was cooler than it was an hour ago. Draco pressed closer to Harry and tucked his face into the back of Harry's neck, just between his shoulder blades. Harry could feel Draco's even breaths and was glad that flying was something that felt calming for both of them.
He was almost finished eating when Potter had taken the place next to him, so Draco finished and waiting for Potter to finish his meal before they both stood up and walked in silence to the eighth years tower.
"Have for a while. Not that I could act on it or show it or think about it." Draco's voice was shaking and he wouldn't look at Harry, afraid to see disgust or rejection.
"Meet me at McGonagall's office when your classes let out." Harry separated when they reached the hall, going to sit with his friends. But as Draco watched, it was out of habit. He didn't put that fake happy mask on when he sat with them and he didn't contribute to the conversation. He largely ignored when people spoke to him. None of the eighth years had class right after breakfast so most everyone stayed at their tables when everyone else left. Draco stood and decided to go to the library, where he could hide from everyone.
Thursday passed more or less uneventfully. More hexes and jinxes hit him than the day before and the slurs and insults got more creative. He didn't pay that much attention to them until his last class when someone's note expressed their distrust and hatred at him for somehow tricking and corrupting Harry Potter.
"Yeah. Living with you would be a dream come true."
Draco didn't want to leave their little bubble, but at least the week was almost over.
"You're the exception because you don't
Potter didn't ask with any of the emotions Draco thought he would. He was open, concerned, worried and ... pleading. Potter wanted Draco to say yes. Harry Potter wanted to save HIM of all people. Which is what Draco had a hard time wrapping his head around, even after all this time. Draco had made his life hell, bullied him and the people he was close to, held Luna Lovegood in his basement, but he still wanted to save Draco.
So when he conjured his potronus for the very first time in class, everyone was shocked that he was able to make one at all. That he had a happy enough memory to use for the spell.
And Draco couldn't find himself to hate or enjoy this fact. He was so pleased that they weren't fighting anymore, but at the same time it felt like he had to be walking on eggshells in fear of losing whatever it was that was between them.
"Draco, that's enough." Pansy said after sitting silently beside him for the better part of an hour. Neither of them had said a thing to the other. But after being his friend for so long, Draco shouldn't have been so surprised that she could read him so easily. "You are your own person now. You don't have to live up to anyone's expectations anymore. Especially not
"I think I might do something like you're planning." Draco said, his hand not stopping it's soothing motions.
"Yeah he is." Harry hugged her and continued on his mission to make preparations for their date.
It has been such a long week for Draco so far, and it was only Tuesday. They were barely through the second month of the first term, how the hell was he supposed to survive the rest of the year? But being Tuesday had good classes today. The only saving grace, no pun intended, was who all was in his classes with him on Tuesdays, and Tuesdays only.
He didn't care if it was even or not, Draco just needed it shorter and Pansy hadn't had enough time to do it for him. Draco nodded moved to his desk chair so it would be easier for Harry. His eyes started stinging when he thought about how hard it was for him to let Pansy cut it the first time, right after his trial when Pansy was the only one he could stand to be around.
"What's that?" Harry mumbled, voice slurring just a little bit. They should probably head back soon, before he fell asleep in the cold.
leave it alone but he kind of didn't want him to leave it alone. They weren't even half way through the second month of the term and it was already this bad. If he said no now, it wouldn't be long before someone's curse sent him to the hospital wing. If anyone else had asked if he wanted help, he would have said no. But it was just Harry. Draco nodded and something in his chest twisted at the small smile Harry gave him when they started moving again.
Harry didn't turn until both boys were in the building and the door was shut behind them. He crouched down and helped Draco stand up.
Draco nodded and shifted just a hair closer, like that would extend the bubble that was around him. And in a way that's exactly what he was doing. He could feel the stares of confusion and the accompanying whispers but as soon as he looked around and glared at anyone he caught looking in their direction they looked away.
When they were making their way down to the Great Hall, is when Harry spoke. "Do you want me to help you? With the bullying, I mean."
Draco nodded. It had been an exhausting day and now he didn't have the energy to leave his room. He didn't think he'd be able to stomach food if he managed to move from where he fell. He stiffened when he felt Harry take his hands to look at the broken and discolored skin.
Draco hugged him back and thought that he'd be more than okay to spend the rest of the weekend like this. "Rather than go to Hogsmeade tonight, can we have a picnic by the lake or something? I don't think I can deal with people yet."
When she had gone, Draco realized that he was the only one left in the room. It was a clear night and he could see the moon casting its silver light across the floor, the only other thing lighting the room beside the fire. He didn't move from his spot. He could feel sleep pulling at him, days without substantial sleep weighing his limbs down until they were too heavy for him to move.
Harry understood what he wasn't saying and threw the paper off the bed before they both got comfortable.
Harry felt Draco's reaction and some how made the right connection. "Do you want me to cut it for you? I can't promise it will be an even cut though."
"I don't think I'm going to do anything for a while after we graduate. I feel like I need to just vanish for a while. Only see some people long enough to assure them that I'm not dead, but nothing more than that."
"Can't be in here." Draco walked across the room and grabbed a warm jumper and pulled it on.
"This couldn't have happened with just one trip." Harry muttered as his fingers ghosted over the damage. Draco turned his face away from Harry as he tucked his thumb and pinky. "Three times! Draco, why do you let them just do whatever they want?"
Draco laughed and eventually pulled away, the cool air pushing through their clothes and doing its best to ruin the warmth that they were creating. They stood and packed everything up, riding back to the castle well past whatever curfew existed now. The two of them snuck back into the tower and back into Draco's room, giggling like the teenagers they weren't allowed to be.
.... And this is why I don't write full chapters in a single day ugh. But I am a glutton for punishment so maybe I'll have the next one day in a day too who knows. Also so no ones confused 'making a room' refers to guests being able to use the magic within the suites to make more room if they need it. I couldn't figure out where to put it in the chapter so thats why its here.
Also on another note I need some help for two chars; Draco-I'm debating on whether I should make him a creature as well. And Sirius- I can't decide if his love interest should be an canon char or an original one. Let me know what you guys think!
Ron had looked like he had swallowed a lemon but he stayed silent waiting to see what the other two would do, Harry shared a look with Hermione before he stood closing the distance between him and the blonde then stuck out his hand, mirroring the incident five years ago. “I'm Harry Potter.” He said with a slight smile. The tension seemed to bleed out of the blond as he took that hand squeezing it once before dropping it. “Draco Malfoy.”
Shutting the door behind him quietly since he was sure that both his father and godfather were still sleeping Adrian turned around to go back to his room only to freeze at the sight of his smirking father sitting in one of the high backed arm chairs with a cup of coffee in his hands, because of course the bloody Alpha would be up at the crack of dawn. “I hate the full moon,” the youngest werewolf grumbled changing his course of direction to a table where a pot of hot water sat under a warming charm with cups and assorted teas. He sent a growl at his father when he heard the man let out a soft chuckle ignoring him while preparing his tea. Once he was finished Adrian plunked down on the sofa pouting.
“Apparently Mrs. Weasley has been on both Ron and Hermione’s case not only to get married but to start popping out grandbabies.” Both white eyebrows were raised in surprised this time at Draco's statement causing the blonde to laugh once more. “Did you not notice the ring on Hermione's finger?”
Adrian summoned a chair so he could sit down his focus on his two best friends and former enemy, “I know this is a lot to take in trust me. I tried running away from my father at least twice and lost count how many times I hexed him and Sirius before the truth finally sank in, blood never lies. “He explained looking at Dumbledore briefly then looked back at his friends, “ let’s start with the basics yeah? For 16 years I was the only son of James and Lily Potter it was something I was told since the moment I was old enough to comprehend that. It wasn’t until after I was stolen away by my very own Godfather in the middle of the night and spelled to remain in a chair a week later that the truth of my parents was revealed; my true parents are Fenrir Greyback and Remus Lupin – Greyback.”
“Put on some clothes you pervert!!” He yelled grabbing another pillow and throwing it at Thayne only for him to duck at the last minute so it hit Sirius in the face. Thayne laughed only to grunt when that pillow whacked him upside the head so hard that he stumbled a little. “Yes Thayne please put some clothes on.” Sirius said dryly moving passed the man, he had a mug of coffee in his hand that he had grabbed from the kitchen. “Good morning pup, Draco.  How come you're here so early?” he directed the question at the blonde.
Sirius took out the luggage he had shrunken out of his pocket placing it on the bed for resizing and putting it away from later then crossed the sitting area to Adrian's room. “Alright pup let's go see….” His voice trailed off when his eyes landed on his godson who was now fast asleep on top of the covers. Rolling his eyes fondly he went over to the smaller male very gently taking off his clothes then moved him under the covers tucking him in then placed a gentle kiss to his forehead. Straightening he left the room closing the door behind him.
There we go the ground work has been laid for Adrian and Draco's relationship. I hope you enjoyed this little filler chapter. As always kudos and comments are appreciated, see you guys in the next update.
“no harm in having a little fun Fenrir it was a long muggle flight from Canada back to London.” Sirius groused pulling a face at the memory of the 7 hour flight, though first class had been nice there had been an ‘incident’ when they landed since apparently the surely werewolf hated flying and his already thin patience had snapped. Thank Merlin Adrian was an expert at calming his father down or else they would have gotten arrested. Fenrir let out a growl sending a heated glare towards Black since it had been his brilliant idea to take muggle travel instead of an illegal portkey. “It's close to the full moon Shaggy so any rough housing is a little dangerous to do in doors.” He smirked at Sirius's mutter of ‘I got a haircut stop calling me that!’
Adrian pouted letting out a soft whine at his fathers words, as much as he wanted to return to the hotel room the desire to catch up with his best friends was stronger. Ron chuckled wrapping an arm around the smaller man pulling him into a hug thumping his back a little hard then pulled away, “I know mate I don't want you to leave either but we will be seeing each other so much that we'll be sick of each other.” He said laughing when Adrian muttered ‘not possible'. Hermione tutted gently pushing Adrian towards the fireplace until the werewolf let out a playful growl and stuck his tongue out at her. Adrian waved goodbye promising to contact them both the moment he woke up the next morning. Tossing some floo into the fireplace he stepped inside calling out the room number of the hotel and he disappeared in a woosh of green flame.
“ that’s why I disappeared shortly after my name was cleared I made the promise to Fenrir that I would help find a way to reserve the curse placed on Remus. Took me half a year just to find the bugger since he was staying with his family pack and Selena had moved locations during our prison time.” Sirius looked at his godson then over at Lucius and Severus, “ I am sorry that I couldn’t stay to help destroy those horcruxes but I knew it was important to prepare for the truth problem that we had to tell Adrian once he was smuggled out of the UK.” He explained to the room.
“That's different they're in the same boat as me.” Adrian grumbled though the smile remained on his face as he thought about his father's Beta, her mate Ella and recently bonded Darius and Michael. Being only a few years older than Adrian as well as still being new wolves those four had really helped him adjust to not only being a werewolf but soothed his fears of waking up and finding his newly discovered family had only been a dream. He couldn't wait to introduce Ron and Hermione to them, hell even Draco would enjoy it. “You know you say that I'll get use to it but how can I? I didn't grow up around wolves dad I was human…… And outside of packs puppy piles are weird to people.”
Hermione questioned Thayne about the American Wizard school for a solid hour before he finally threw in the towel aiming a glare at his nephew and two friends who were failing to hide their laughter at his expense, this was obvious revenge for embarrassing Adrian in front of Draco earlier. “You weren't kidding paws when you said your friend was insatiable when it comes to information.” Thayne said watching as the empty plates were vanished from the table. He smirked when Ron looked at him in confusion, “paws?” Adrian let out groan putting his head in his hand while Thayne laughed lowly. “When a pup is growing into their body going from child to adult their paws tend to be a little bit bigger until their body grows into them, it's the same for wolves as well. For the first two years Rian here struggled to walk with those paws of his, he would constantly trip over them. One time he and Katra that's Fen's Beta were play fighting and Rian started to run only for him to trip and tumble right into a fallen log. We started calling him ‘all paws' which was shortened into paws.”
Hermione swallowed a few times to stop her own tears from falling and composed herself. “It's just a theory but I believe it will work you see partially severing the bond also effects the submissive as well making their instincts weaker more docile and easily manipulated, it would explain why the caster was able to plant those fake memories Remus's wolf couldn't fight them.” Another whine and sob cut her off so Hermione hurried with her plan. “When the moon is full a werewolves wolf side is strongest so I believe if we can get Fenrir and Remus together during the full moon in two weeks the instinct bond can be recreated. Once that's re-established Adrian's grandmother Selena with the help of Fenrir can get rid of those fake memories and redo the martial bond.”
That duel was far tougher for the Savior and before he turned the tide in his favor it looked like Voldemort would win. Despite the fact that Harry spent 6 months training with Albus, Lucius, Severus, and Sirius to sharpen up his duelling skills and learn more spells he was still only 16 years old. Though he had a great well of magic he lacked the years of experience Voldemort had on him, as well as an ego he started to become rather bold bragging to Harry that even if he managed to kill him once more he would still come back as he was Immortal. Harry’s response was to merely smile twirling his wand between his fingers while smirking before delivering a final bombshell.
Adrian let out a laugh almost forgetting about the incident with Sirius's patronus. Looking in the direction of his godfather’s room he then shot a smug look at his uncle, “when were you going to tell us that you and Siri had feelings for each other?” He asked his grin turning into a full blown smile when Thayne stumbled in shock.
But Harry's smile just grew. He waited until Draco looked at him before moving or saying anything. "That's good, cause I've felt the same for a while too. I don't know what rumors you might have heard, but I don't just go around kissing people. Anything you heard during sixth year does not count."
Draco made his way to his room and made sure all the lights were on and the candles were lit before he shut the door. His room was a mess and he couldn't bring himself to clean it or let the house elves clean it for him.  He sat at his desk and started doing his homework
Harry smiled just as big, suddenly awake again. "Excellent!" He leaned forward and rested their foreheads together. "We have all year to learn each others pet peeves and such. And all the boring stuff, like looking for a house and buying it."
When Harry landed, it took a minute for Draco to dismount and step back. Not that Harry minded. Harry set his broom off to the side and took the basket from Draco who was admiring the view of the lake. He silently set to work getting their picnic set up, not wanting to disrupt the peace just yet.
Draco paused his own fingers to think about how to answer that. "Because you're the only to ever put any effort into
"Professor, what's the schools policy on bullying?" Harry asked right out of the gate. He stood tall and looked her in the eye when he spoke.
"I'm sorry. If you want me to leave I will, but I didn't want to go anywhere else." Harry said. His back was to Draco, who was still standing shocked in the doorway. The wet sniff is what got Draco moving again.
Draco's breath hitched, but he didn't freak out like he thought he would if Harry said those words to him. "Love you. Sleep well." He kissed Harry's forehead and fell asleep and dreamed of a cottage with a garden surrounded by fields.
"A house in the middle of nowhere, no one bothering me or trying to run me out."
He was out of breath and just as soaked as he was. His bag was thrown to the ground near by in his haste to get to him. And when the to in front of Draco saw who was now standing in their way, they first looked in awe. The Great Harry Potter was going to help them scare Draco out of school. It only took seconds for them to read the look of rage that Harry was directing at them. They became terrified of what Harry would do to them if they didn't leave right then.
He walked to dinner in a kind of haze and didn't eat very much. Draco didn't pay attention to what was happening around him until there was commotion at the Gryffindor table. He looked up in time to see Harry glare at his friends and storm out of the Great Hall.
The solutions she offered didn't sound promising to Draco, and he was grateful that Harry asked if there was anything else that could be done.
All Draco did with that non-permission was draw his feet onto the couch and maneuvered them to be resting beneath him. He knew his feet would go numb and when he decided to stand again his ankles wouldn't want to support his weight, but he didn't care. He still expected to be disciplined for sitting in such a disgraceful way, for not preserving the
"You shouldn't need to be saved, but I'll always help you." Harry mumbled. He shifted again, getting comfortable before letting sleep take him. "Love you."
"You have feelings for me?" Harry smiled, small and nervous. Yes they had kissed the night before and a little that morning, but it could have been just two people seeking physical comfort in each other. He hoped that wasn't the case, but still.
"And what are you doing?"
Draco closed his eyes and tried to focus on something else. Anything else. He tried to come up with something to distract his mind, to pull his thoughts away from his stained memories, but nothing was working.
He didn't want it to be Wednesday.
They paired up in Slughorns class, no one sitting at their table in the corner of the room. Slughorn was ecstatic at their display of house camaraderie, everyone looking the other way with a roll of their eyes. Whenever they were asked a question it was Potter who answered, even if he knew he was giving the wrong answer. They didn't speak to each other to coordinate the project, both knowing, from past years watching the other, who did best doing what. While Draco needed no help making the potion himself, he detested having to put it into the report. And Potter, who didn't know holly hawk from wolfs bane, much preferred watching what to do and saying what he saw.
McGonagall was proud of Potter. She knew that he would go to such lengths for anyone, but it showed how much he had grown when he wanted to do this for Malfoy. She agreed and told them that she'd let the other professors know. "Can I know the extent of what's happening?"
"Are you sure? We can just eat here if you want." Harry offered, letting Draco stand.
Harry sat up and moved into Draco's line of sight. He didn't say a word as he reached forward and put his cold hands on Draco's cheeks. It gave him a feeling to focus on. Grounded him in one present sensation.
After some time Pansy closed her book and stood. "I'm going to bed now. I highly suggest you do the same, you look worse than yesterday." She said the same thing every night.
(See the end of the chapter for
The busy bee like hive that was Diagon Alley was packed as usual since it was mid-July so the familiar crowds of returning and new Hogwarts students with their harried parents was nothing new for the magical marketplace. However the crowd did split apart slightly when three cloaked figures, wearing robes of brown, navy and slate grey, two of which were obviously male by their height and size with a smaller figure between them walked through the brick entrance when it finished making its arch. Worried glances were shot their way as mothers grabbed their little ones and scurried away like rodents. A snort left the figure in the slate grey robes while his companions turned their hoods in his general direction. “At least no one is casting spells at us” He said to his companions which brought a snort from the male wearing the brown robes this time.
“That went really well, I think you could actually sit with us next full moon if you wanted…. Hermione and Ron should be safe to join us as well.” He said plopping back down in his chair while Draco stood and returned to his. That same frustrated look that came over Draco's face when the word animagus was mentioned a month ago returned, “Hermione said that she and Ron were able to get their licenses but you didn't speak up…. How come you're not an animagus?”
Hey guys sorry for the long absence again real life is kicking my ass and so did this chapter, my brain did not want to write it because apparently it was bored with the first act and wanted to move on...... So apologies for it being a short chapter but good news is I introduced Thayne. Also the next 3 chapters to finish the first act will be larger so there's something to look forward too.
Hermione had to blink back tears as the memory of her best friends disappearance resurfaced like it had happened yesterday not five years ago. During their sixth year ten Death Eaters invaded Hogwarts with the help of a Slytherin student who had repaired a vanishing cabinet that lay within the room of requirement. Their goal had been to secure the castle then drop the wards to allow Voldemort inside to finish off Albus Dumbledore and Harry. However what they found instead of students were the Order, the sixth year DA members, and a handful of Aurors with Harry, Sirius, Albus, Lucius and Severus standing in front.
Adrian suddenly let out a snicker causing the other three to look at him. “Sorry I just realized dad owes me five galleons.” He explained which of course wasn't really much of an explanation so he elaborated as they packed up. “When we stayed in British Columbia with dad's pack Sirius got really close with my uncle Thayne dad's former Beta and younger brother. I was convinced that they were more than friends and dad wasn't buying it so we made a bet.”
“How did Adrian end up staying with the Dursley's then? They weren’t his biological family shouldn’t he have ended up with his real parents?” Hermione asked looking from Sirius and Fenrir though it was Albus who spoke.
Severus and Lucius had already left in the morning to continue their lesson prep as school was resuming in a few weeks. Ron and Hermione left only a few minutes prior stating that they needed to check into the office to make sure the two staff members they had hadn't according to Hermione ‘completely bollocked my filing system'. Adrian let out a absent hum grabbing a glass of lemonade and taking a sip of the sweet tart liquid before replying, “don't breathe a word of this to Hermione but there wasn't any research done while I was with my dad's pack.” Draco snorted causing a grin to split Adrian's face. “I mean we tried honestly maybe within the last year before coming back here but we were busy with other things. Besides my dad, grandparents, Sirius and Thayne had gone through all of the reading material they could find so it wasn't much of a search when I joined.”
On another note I also edited my other chapters nothing too big just fixing grammar errors and sealing up from plot holes.
“After Adrian was born a glamour and creature suppressant spell  was placed on him, the plan was to keep our son safe with the Potter’s until Voldemort was taken care of or we could secure a safe passage out of Britain. Of course that all went to hell when it was decided at the last minute to change secret Keepers and my protests were ignored.” Fenrir snarled leveling a glare at Sirius who looked both guilty and angry.
“I'm your only uncle brat, go grab my grumpy brother from where ever he's hiding so we can eat, I'm bloody starving.” Thayne chuckled gently shoving his nephew towards his father's rooms before he rubbed the bridge of his nose and went to fetch Sirius.
by casting a simple accio he had been absolutely floored. He and the others also learned that him casually using his magic for small things wasn't because he was lazy, the smalls drains to his magical core kept it from spilling over. “What was it like? Those spells wearing off when you were seventeen?” The blonde suddenly asked.
The silence was absolutely deafening Adrian would have laughed at the absolute gobsmacked expressions on his friends and well he wasn’t sure where he and Draco stood so he was an enigma for now. He was about to continue his story when Hermione spoke up shooting a look at Fenrir, “ that…. I’m really happy you have a family ha – Adrian but Remus always said that Greyback attacked and bit him when he was a little-" her voice was cut off by a menacing growl from The surly werewolf. Sirius lifted a hand and cuffed the back of his head silencing the growl abruptly, gold eyes narrowed with unspoken revenge towards the other man to which Sirius just smiled not bothered in the slightest.
“But why was Ha-Adrian taken from Hogwarts? Couldn't you have revealed the truth to all of us once he was awake?” Ron asked anger seeping into his tone slightly.
“Oh please Weasel I don't need to cheat to beat you. I told you to step up your chess game while playing against me seeing as I'm not Potter.”
Draco watched as he disappeared and nodded in agreement when Pansy voiced his thoughts of "I wonder what that was about."
He was as shocked as they were, not that he showed it. He heard everyone whispering, saying that maybe it was from when he was little, before school, his mother was probably the center of that memory but they were so far off the mark. But he didn't correct them, or even acknowledge that they were even speaking about him. He just focused on maintaining the spell until their professor said "that's enough."
They laid there like that for a while, and at some point, Harry grabbed Draco's hand and laced their fingers.
Draco was the one that woke up first. Sitting up breathing heavily and drenched in sweat. He felt Harry stir and felt terrible that he woke him up. Draco was shaking and couldn't get his breathing to even out.
There was a split second where Harry felt the heat of flames pressing around them, smoke making it hard to breathe, but at the feeling of arms tightening around him, Harry was pulled back to the present. The war was over and they were both out of danger.
Potter didn't say a word either as he followed Draco's lead. Draco turned on all the lights and lit all the candles before closing the door. He didn't apologize for the mess of his room, he wasn't ashamed or embarrassed by it, not right now anyway.
Draco didn't know why Harry was telling him all this, but he was glad that he was trusted enough to be told these secrets. He knew that he wasn't brave enough to say anything, but Draco hoped that his actions would be enough. Draco pulled their hands closer to him and placed a soft kiss on the back of Harry's hand.
Draco's eyes widened at the gesture. He wasn't cold, not this close to the fire, but the weight of the blanket was nice. Not just that, it was reminisce of all the times he would wake up alone in this exact spot and be covered in a quilt.
Right now all he wanted to do was lay down and not think for a while.
Until Harry started humming. It was a muggle song that he might have heard before, but he couldn't remember where. He felt his shoulders drop and his hands stopped shaking. Draco didn't feel Harry cutting his hair, but he could hear it falling to the floor under the sound of Harry's voice.
Another bark like laughter escaped Slate Grey before he tore off the cloak with flourish earning an eye roll from his godson. The infamous Sirius Black stood in all his cocky glory though he looked nothing like the scruffy looking ragamuffin that he had become post his unjust stay in Azkaban. Even with grey dusting temples Sirius was back to looking the way he did when he was an Auror with his best mate once upon a time. Especially with that mischievous smile on his handsome face. “Well pup since you didn't gain any height after your inheritance you're always going to look like a child to me.” He teased pulling his godson into a light choke hold so he could rub at that white hair making it go from bed head to ‘I decided to play dare with a light socket.’
Anywho thank you for the kudos, comments are appreciated see you next time!
“That could work……. It has too.” Hermione whispered tears freely falling down her face as Ron got up from his seat and wrapped his fiancée in a tight embrace the only sounds in the room were Adrian's heart wrenching sobs that eventually died down into soft hiccups.
Hogwarts, Headmaster's office.
Hermione shook off the disappointment quickly and declared that since they were done eating they could then begin researching. Ron groaned while Adrian made a note to ask Draco why he looked so agitated when Hermione brought up being an animagus.
The hairs on the back of Navy's neck rose as the tingling sensation of the suites wards settled into place. Glancing at his companions he dropped the deep set hood of his cloak revealing a shock of pure white hair that clearly had a mind of its own as though it was cropped short on the side the top was a mass of curls and strands that stuck up in every which way in a permanent ‘I just rolled out of bed style.’ Icy blue eyes that had a ring of pure gold around the pupil blinked a few times to adjust to the brighter lighting of the room. A small ‘oof' left his lips as a pair of muscular arms wrapped around his trim waist and lifted him a few inches off the ground in a bear hug, immediately he started to squirm with indignation. “Padfoot! Put me down I am not a child!!” He squawked nails that suddenly turned to wicked looking claws digging lightly into one of those arms lightly to make his godfather drop him.
Also yes I used the french word for mom although if its wrong I'm sorry I stopped taking french when I was 15 and I googled it.
“What if it’s a combination of both?” Hermione asked looking to both Fenrir and Severus, “the little information I have read about bonds is that they're stronger between those that are fated to be with one another. That type of strength can theoretically over come many spells even memory ones. So in order for those fake memories to stick the caster suppressed the soul bond.”
Draco got as comfortable as the lumpy sofa would allow and focused on the fire blazing in front of him.
When they reached the common room, Luna stood on her tiptoes to kiss Draco on the cheek before pulling Pansy up the stairs to her room. Draco looked after them for a moment before assuming his usual seat in the corner in front of the fire.
"Are you awake?" Harry whispered, the arm around Draco's shoulder shifting so fingers were running through his hair.
Her look turned calculating. Draco was curled in on himself and looking at the floor. She noticed the small tendril of smoke still rising from his hair and he was holding his bag like there was something secret in there. Nothing like the proud boy he used to be.
Tears started running down his temples. Draco lifted their joined hands and attempted to wipe them away. Eventually Harry stopped crying and Draco had no idea how to comfort him so he just moved closer, so their shoulders were touching all the way to their hands. Thankfully, this seemed to make Harry relax a little.
The two of them spent all morning and most of the afternoon in Draco's bed. Sometimes they would talk, about different things, some important some not, but they were mostly silent.
me to save you. You won't let me save you or help you unless
They sat like that until they heard people getting ready for the day.
When he first managed it, everyone was shocked. The war was over and everyone had their trauma to sort through, and they all know that both him and Potter had it much worse than the rest of them. Everyone already steered away from him because of his unwilling stint as a Death Eater, but even more so when it was obviously one of those days where every bad thing that happened was at the forefront of his mind.
"I'll stay right here. Go to sleep now, I won't let anything or anyone hurt you. I promise." Harry tightened his hold of Draco and he was asleep almost instantly.
Oh, so that's what that was about. Draco wordlessly summoned the note from his bag and unfolded it. He placed the paper on the bed next to Harry's hand. Harry shifted only enough to grab the note and read it. When he did, he sat up and looked angry, more than the note should have made him.
Draco was once again crying and started pulling violently at his hair. "Why am I awake? This only happens when I'm dreaming."
He opened the door to his room and froze, his hand still on the handle. Draco expected to come back and do his homework in an empty room. He did not expect to see Harry curled in a ball in the center of his bed.
"Is Draco in his room?" This made Harry's smile widen. When Hermione apologized, Harry said it would be nice if she tried to forgive Draco for the things he was forced to do.
"Why not doing that together?" Harry yawned and sat up, rubbing at his eyes. He needed to get them back before he fell asleep. "Move in with me when we graduate."
Draco went through the day absentmindedly. He only half heard all the lectures. Only half felt all the little hexes that hit him. Only half saw the slurs that burned themselves into his desk or wrote themselves across his notes.
Harry first went down to the kitchens. He asked the house elves to make Draco's favorite meal. They were a little busy making food for the castles dinner, but they were happy for the special request from him.
After some time Harry took a deep breath to speak but couldn't seem to force the words out. Draco squeezed his hand in encouragement. "Everyone still wants me to be him. To be the great Harry Potter, Savior of the wizarding world. But I can't be him any more. It too much, I can't do it anymore."
Draco curled himself even tighter, like he could put his walls back up if he was smaller. He knew it was futile, they were gone and he was exposed for everyone to see and poke at.
image of the Malfoy family.
Like he said he would be, Harry was waiting outside the office door and Draco's stomach was in knots. He'd had enough confrontation to last the rest of his life and McGonagall still kind of terrified him. As soon as he noticed Draco standing in front of him, Harry instantly saw the singed ends of his hair and once again looked angry.
"It has changed because the war is over, for good. There are no more sides anymore. And even though there are probably still splinter groups and factions, you and I are on the same side." Harry watched Draco sit up straighter but didn't let go of his legs. "You can chose if you want to help fight against those small groups, you can chose to watch from the side lines, or you can do something like I'm doing."
That didn't mean people would look past what he supposedly did and was forced to do. Everyone needed someone to hate, and who better than someone who was right in front of them.
Harry shut the door behind them and was pulled away from the wall by his hand. Draco fell, and simultaneously pulled Harry down onto the bed. They kept giggling, neither being able to calm down.
Along with many more insults and slurs were thrown at him by the two seventh years. They pushed him to the ground and one of them kicked him in the stomach. Draco knew that they would have continued if Harry hadn't stepped in.
Friday's choices of slurs, curses and hexes were more colorful and creative than they had been. Everyone taking issue with the fact that Harry Potter wanted to be in Draco's presence. By the time he was walking up the stairs to the headmistress's office Draco's hair was smoking and his hands were scraped. There were probably bruises on his knees from the three times he was tripped in the same hallway but he didn't want to think about it.
Draco nodded and started falling asleep. "Please don't leave me."
Draco's feet stalled on the stairs and he nearly missed the landing when he started moving again. Harry watched him out of the corner of his eye and watched as he thought. Draco knew that if he said no Harry
Draco was sitting in the middle of his bed, looking a little confused. A look he tried to covered up fast enough for Harry not to catch it. "I'm awake."
Draco nodded and closed his eyes. "When you told those two off on the second day of the term." It was pouring that day and Draco was using his free hour to go apologize to Hagrid. Rather than waste time to store his school supplies in his room, or risk them getting them stolen by hiding them somewhere, he brought them with him. He was using his wand as an umbrella until someone stole it from his grip. Draco was drenched within seconds and his papers and books didn't last much longer.
"Is there anything that you think might work?" She asked them.
Draco curled into a ball, facing away from Harry. His eyes were stinging and he let out an ugly sob. He knew that Harry's anger was directed to the people who did this to him but it still felt like he was about to be yelled at. He'd been yelled at one too many times by his father, that was quickly followed by one beating or another. His breathing got shorter and more uneven as he remembered how it felt when the bruises formed, the blinding white pain when he had to mend his own wounds. Never once letting anyone see the pain he was in, that would just ensure another scolding that was worse.
When Draco had calmed down a little he relaxed the white knuckle grip he hand on the covers and put his head on Harry's shoulder. He managed to steady his breathing after a minute.
"Once we graduate, I'm going to disappear. I'm thinking of a little cottage in the middle of the country side, a garden with lots of flowers, maybe an animal or two, only Ron, Hermione, Luna and George have visitation rights. And only two per month so they'll need to make their own schedule. You are the only one who has a free pass, welcome to visit whenever you'd like."
He was approaching the hidden clearing when he found himself laughing in disbelief and...giddiness would be the best word. After so long, he was finally taking Draco on a date.
He seemed as hesitant to move as Draco was, but more than anything Draco did not want to be present in the flow of students on their way down for breakfast. So Draco squeezed Potter's hand one last time before getting up and walking to his room.
Draco hummed and they continued to lie there in silence for a while.
Draco didn't understand why it didn't bother him. Rather than let his brain run around in that particular circle, he focused on the fire and let everything else happening around him disappear. He didn't even realize it when Weasley and Granger came back and asked Potter something.  He didn't see the look the couple shared, he didn't realize when they left. Draco didn't notice when Potter shifted just a little bit closer and fell asleep, using his shoulder as a pillow.
Next, Harry grabbed his broom and as soon as he was beyond most of the buildings, took to the sky.
"You have a free pass too." Draco said when he was almost asleep. Harry made a confused noise and shifted a little, so he would be looking at Draco if his eyes were open. "To save me. If you think I need your help, unless I tell you no, you're welcome to jump in whenever."
Harry's feet touched the ground and he got off his broom. He loved this spot and as far as he knew, he was the only one who knew about it. He couldn't wait to give Draco an open space that was safe from the outside world.
Tuesdays were his favorite days because no crumpled papers flew at him, no hateful words appeared on his desk or across his notes. He didn't need to look at the ground to avoid being poked at or to the ceiling to hold the tears that threatened to fall at words spat in his face. All because there was only one person in attendance who no one wanted to see angry.
Draco walked down from the tower to the Great Hall, hoping he had waited long enough to avoid as many people as he could. He only had enough time before his first class to grab toast to eat on the way but he didn't need more than that.
"What's up?" Harry was smiling. He was glad that Hermione was working on understanding that Harry had changed. It felt amazing not to have to pretend around them anymore.
