“Explain yourself,” snaps Pansy. Harry’s guards rustle at the disrespect, but Harry holds a hand up to them and they settle down. Draco struggles to remember whether he’d given away any strategic information about their forces and defense to Harry, information that would hurt them now if things come to a head. His mind flows in circles, unable to settle long enough to be sure. Is that why Harry had come in disguise?
“I forget nothing,” Lucius says, voice brittle and sharp. “But losing a battle doesn’t mean the principles themselves were wrong.”
“Better sleep with one eye open,” Draco says, leaning against the counter. “Looks like you’re on his shit list.”
She’s waiting for him in the atrium today, a round, brass globe in hand. Ministry-issue Portkeys are usually reserved for travel outside England, so the first thing he says is, “Where are we going?”
“Fancy a bit of a walk?” asks Potter. Draco looks at him. His cheeks are pinking up in the cold and his eyes are bright behind his glasses.
Potter’s aunt is a tall, gaunt woman with a neck like a giraffe and a face like she’s been sucking lemons for twenty years, but it changes when she smiles. Gets warmer, more approachable.
Draco turns up the collar of his cloak against the wet gusts being blown in under the eaves of the train station’s roof. The ends of his hair are damp, and they drip cold water down the back of his neck. He wonders if Potter will come; he wonders if he even received his owl. There’d been no reply.
“I’m sorry about the other night,” she says. “I should have listened to you better. Should have been more supportive. I think I was just mainly sad, because you wouldn’t be there with me anymore, at the ministry. I rely on you, too much.”
Draco watches the dragon for awhile. He’s only half the size of an adult Welsh Red, which he imagines is what’s saving him now, making it possible for the Sanctuary people to treat his injury and keep him still long enough to heal. Draco hopes he gets to grow; he hopes the dragon has the chance to fly once more, over fields and mountains, along the coast of Wales like the Reds used to do two centuries ago.
“No,” Potter says, his voice very firm and decisive. “We can’t chance it. We don’t want anything setting off any alarm bells for these people.” He looks at Draco. “We’re adults. This is not a big deal.”
Harry shrugs. His skin feels tight, uncomfortable. He supposes that Malfoy has been watching him closely, too.
“Sloppy journalism,” Granger shoots back, and the severe disapproval on her face reminds for a moment of a McGonagall. He restrains a smile.
Malfoy snorted. “I wouldn’t say I decided. There was never a point where I consciously chose to somehow leave my body and take a little stroll to Grimmauld Place to see Potter. No, I just…” Malfoy was looking at Harry, but he was looking past Harry, too. It made a shiver run down Harry’s spine. “I was imagining a conversation with you, in my head. And then somehow I was standing in the parlour and you were there on the sofa, sipping something from a mug.”
Malfoy flips him with a shoulder lowered to his chest, and then pushes him down hard into the mattress. Malfoy's hand curls around the back of his neck and Harry gasps, helpless and beyond any care for how he must sound.
“And distrust of the Muggle world is exactly what the Traditional Wizarding Order wants,” adds Granger. “So we need to know what else they’re up to— who their real leaders are.”
. He thinks about a teenaged girl disappearing from all of her parents' photographs and the teenaged boy who loved her—who loved Harry, too—waiting and watching, stealing wands from Snatchers, anything to find his chance at getting back to them.
The kissing stopped, but Draco was still holding onto him, his lips resting just to the side of Harry's right ear. He closed his eyes and savored the feel of Draco’s breath rasping warm against the side of his face.
It’s funny— Draco never thought he’d ever feel as though he understood a Muggle so well, particularly Potter’s rather horrid, wizard-hating aunt. But there is something about her grief and her regret that strikes him like a bell, the ring reverberating all throughout him. He recognises things in her— his father, or maybe just himself as he could have been if he’d waited too long to let the world change him, to break free of all the bitterness and cast his own shadow, his own way.
Potter sees him right before they’re about to experience a collision, stopping so suddenly his glasses slip down nose. He catches them, pushes them back up. “Sorry,” he says, in a way that sounds automatic, then he blinks, squints as though maybe his eyesight can’t be trusted. “Malfoy?”
When Draco wakes up, the room is awash in the pale grey of first light, and the right side of his body is very warm. He moves sleepily toward that warmth, blinking slowly. Potter has rolled over in his sleep; he’s burrowed down into the space between his pillow and Draco’s, on his stomach, with an arm thrown over Draco’s side.
“Oh, do shut up, Potter. I was as blindsided by this as you were.” He walks past Potter to the doorway, looking at the empty room. “My furniture didn’t fit, so I shrunk it down and stuck it in the corner until I could get some that does.”
When Malfoy looks up at him, his eyelids are heavy. Harry can see a set of dark indentations in Malfoy's bottom lip, marks left by his teeth into the soft pink skin.
But right now there is touching, so much touching. With fingers curled like claws and lungs burning. Like he’s running for his life, like he’s drowning. He pushes his fingers into the gaps between the buttons of Potter’s shirt and tugs until Potter’s chest is bare to him. Potter’s belly, rising and falling in choppy waves. Potter’s shoulders, the puckered pink of the worst of the scarring running down and across his chest. He should have known then, when Potter got those scars. That night over Thai takeout in Potter’s flat, and that terrible, consuming fear as he touched the ruined skin that marked Potter’s vulnerability as plain as day. He
“Yeah,” Potter interrupts. Draco tries not to look like he’s curious about whatever Dudley had been about to say.
Harry laughed. It felt wonderful—like a light coming on in a dark room. “I’m always much wittier in the conversations I have in my head.”
And that’s when it happened. He was never sure afterwards whether it had come from him, from Malfoy, or from both of them: the burst of uncontrolled magic that went off like a bomb, shattering all the cups and saucers and teapots. The sugar bowls and the plates and even the glass tops of the little tables. The shards exploded around them and seemed to hang there, suspended around and between them. It was like being encased in a snow globe, the moment paused, and instead of glitter-snow they were surrounded by broken china.
Draco scowls, but does the same. With enough alcohol, perhaps even the most stubborn of problems will go away, at least for the night.
Dolohov's wand is in his hand before the cacophony ceases, and then Harry is across the room and has him by the throat. It is satisfying, to squeeze until he feels the man's windpipe compressed and his throat working hard to breathe or swallow or speak. Much more satisfying than using his wand. Dolohov's hair is falling out of the slick pomade-waves it had been styled in, his robes ripped during the fight, and there is a bruise beginning its slow spread across his cheekbone. Harry is surprised, in some distant corner of his mind that has the leisure for it right now, by how much he would like to give this man even more bruises.
There was a very thick silence, and then Hermione took off her glasses. She rubbed very delicately at the bridge of her nose with one finger, and then she put her glasses back on. “Ghosts haunt places, not people.”
“He was a few years ahead of me in Slytherin,” Draco says. “Well-liked, played his cards close to his chest. I don’t know much about the Warringtons except that they’re rich.”
"With all due respect, Fergus, what are you implying?" Kingsley says, and Harry focuses on what's being said again.
“Hey,” says Harry. “It’s ok. I want you to rely on me. Really. I want everyone I love to rely on me, just like I rely on them. Just not the whole world. And I’ll still see you. Every day, if you like.”
are we doing?” Potter asks, scratching his head and looking out at the large pasture in front of them. The long grass is bending with the breeze, rippling away from them.
She puts down her fork and turns her full attention on him. Millicent can be quite intimidating when she wants to be. “He hasn’t. What’s it about? I don’t like the sound of it.”
Draco leans in to kiss him, and then they come together with their hands and mouths again, and Draco is very, very careful to memorize every second as it happens, like a film he wants to replay. Again and again.
He turns away from the windows. Pansy has gone all in on the Muggle mania. She favours square, upholstered furniture with wooden legs from the 1950s, jazz records on an old turntable, and everything art deco. She also has an old telephone box sitting in the corner of her living room. Blaise explained telephones to them one day, and she was so taken with them she went out and bought it the next.
“You’re early,” she calls from back where her bedroom is located. “The others aren't due for at least half an hour.”
“I’ll keep watch in the hall,” Potter says quietly, his voice strange and heavy with something new that sets Draco’s heart racing.
“Draco,” he whispered. He wrapped a forearm around Draco’s lower back, his hand settling into the dip just above the waistband of his trousers. He pulled him closer; he pulled him as far into his own body as he could go with all their clothing still on.
“What’s the common word for ‘manners’?” he calls back. “And do you intend to employ any while you’re staying with me?”
There is a bed in St. Mungo’s that stays empty. There is a chart that hangs on the end of it, and a name written on the top.
“Whatever for?” Draco is grumpy; he pushes a pile of scrolls to the floor and spreads a map out across his desk. A maid is trying to serve him the dinner he didn’t show up to eat earlier, but he waves her away in irritation.
“I don’t think I will. I think I’ll keep popping up whenever I feel like it. Ruining your evening might be the only satisfaction left for me.” With that, the ghost of Draco Malfoy trailed out of Harry’s kitchen.
Sometimes Draco thinks the War never really ended at all, that it's still running beneath their world like an underground stream. He wonders if it will just keep on echoing, and echoing; thousands of individual hurts passed along, only to wash up somewhere else downstream.
“We believe the bomb went off early due to a mechanical failure,” Kingsley says. “The timer was jammed when we managed to uncover it.”
It was the same moment Harry had been remembering, when he knew for sure that he was in love with Draco Malfoy.
Then Macnair went for his wand, and Draco’s was already pulled, and it was almost simple to send that curse through the air. Hit Wizards were sent with a single purpose, after all, and Draco was very good at his job.
"But Potter—there is always another wave. You think it's over, that the war is won and the justice meted, and that's it. But there is always another war. Humanity's dirty secret."
“McLaggen is an imbecile,” Pansy says harshly. “He loves the attention and he’s easy to manipulate. He’s just a puppet for Cassius. But he was here last night, and every time he comes in a panic something bad happens.”
By the time summer was ending, it was over. Malfoy’s engagement hit the papers, and the wedding was planned out.
She falls silent. Draco can hear the ticking of the clock on the mantle and the dull roar of the sea in the distance, the way it flings itself again and again onto the rock-crusted shoreline. The way it breaks and flows backward, only to dash itself again, and again.
“I think that’s all I’ll ever be, sometimes,” he says. “That I peaked at seventeen, on one very long night.”
“I did,” says Blaise. Everyone looks at him, and he shrugs. “I wasn’t sure you’d have the balls to actually do it, but I could tell you wanted to. And it’s perfectly fine, Potter, to stop living for the whole world. I don’t mind confessing I had some serious qualms about this cottage, but look at it now. It’s yours. You belong here, and you know what you’re about.”
The morning after his night out with Pansy and Blaise, Draco lies in bed for a long time. The sun paints his wall from blue to gray, white to yellow-gold as the sun rises higher and higher into the morning sky, and still he lies there, in his soft white sheets, staring at the ceiling.
Most people wouldn’t notice the slight surprise on Narcissa’s face, but he does. “Well,” she says. “Thank you. And no one shall know of this but me. I promise you that. Now, here—“ She puts her hand on Draco’s elbow and calls for Twinks. “Get these gentlemen to the Floo, discreetly,” she tells the elf, and then, “Goodnight, darling,” to him.
“Sure. Yes.” Malfoy shrugged. “But so what? Lots of people grow up under pressure from their families. It’s not really that unusual. It’s not being locked in a broom cupboard. It’s not exactly a tragedy.”
Potter looks at him curiously. His hair is light again, and his features obscured, turned into the fictional Dudley. Draco finds it unsettling, suddenly— speaking to Potter when he doesn’t
Draco begins to feel sick after he emerges from the fireplace in his own flat. He goes into the kitchen and fills a glass with tap water, leaning over the sink and looking out the back window. The ghost, that damned ghost, is back in the garden. It’s wearing the same form as the last time, male and well-dressed and with pale hair. He can’t tell now, though, if it reminds him of Lucius or of himself. Bile rises in his the back of his throat. He lets the glass fall into the sink with a loud clatter and turns away.
“That’s business, though,” Weasley chimes in, looking thoughtful. “George sources his ingredients, and then the product he makes with them is marked up beyond the price he paid. Labor costs, of course, although I suppose purchasing and listing things for collectors is labor, too.”
Right on cure, the fireplace roared. Harry pushed the laptop aside and stood up as the tall, familiar figure passed through the floo. She was dressed in a way that made Harry's jaw drop. Tight white jeans with a silver chain hanging from the belt loops. Complimented nicely with his spiked black combat boots and black mesh top. Over everything, she wore a grey feathery jacket spotted black.
Right. Golden Boy doing Golden Boy things. Being granted special privileges because of his role as the Boy Who Lived. Being allowed in the Triwizard Tournament. Draco remembered how awful he was that year. Did Potter read any particularly awful comments in that diary? He thought he wrote some vile things about the lake challenge.
It wasn’t every day your boyfriend (who was previously a childhood enemy) introduced you to his best friends (one of which you once called a derogatory word and the other whose family has been feuding with yours for as long as you could remember). So call Draco a pessimist. He and Harry hadn’t even agreed on when to come out about their relationship. Draco thought they should wait until Harry had at least properly courted him in full Pureblood tradition and, while Harry did promise to court him somewhat, Harry wanted his best friends to be the first to know. He also admitted to feeling guilty about them not knowing.
He grunted and fell back on the bed as if he had been pushed physically. And Teddy hardly needed to move a muscle. They knew that was a part of it for James. The power imbalance. Or, at least, the pretend one. Teddy was quite aware that their boyfriend was practically an expert in wandless spells. He wouldn't need any instrument to duel with Teddy, but he never did.
"Um, this is the guy from last night. The one who asked for your number so I could win a bet. That was a really shitty thing to do, I'm calling to apologize."
End notes because I want to mention that I kind of fell in love with Draco and Harry's Dark demon baby as I was describing it? And I almost want to write a follow-up about Draco living as a widower and single parent, with the support of his friends as he grapples with the grief of losing his husband as well as learning how to parent an inhuman baby.
They haven't been interrupted yet. It's just the two of them. If the pregnant silence lasts for any longer, Harry may just act on those shared fantasies. Luckily, he doesn't need to. Draco shuffles over to the windowsill and hops up next to Harry. He's still avoiding his gaze as he slides his hand over to the open space between them.
"You know... That might actually be worse than you being an Auror. So what am I, some sort of experiment?"
Potter’s head shot up, his eyes wide. Before he could even ask, Draco heard it too: growling, the sound of heavy footfalls clear outside of the locker room. His heart hammered in his chest. Fuck, they were stupid for not immediately leaving once Draco was dressed.
A dream of both of was to have their own child. A baby coming from their own sweat and blood and tears. More than once, Harry and Draco have stayed up for hours fantasizing about which one of them would be pregnant in a perfect world, who would be the most annoying pregnant person (Draco begrudgingly agreed it would likely be him), what their child would look like— Draco wouldn't care what they looked like, as long as they had Harry's distinctive green eyes.
They stopped in the kitchen. It was a small room (cozy, Ginny called it). There was already the essence of the two women all over the place: Luna's strange-looking plant trimmings and messy notes on the windows, Ginny's knitting equipment and her newest project— a blanket with the logo of the Holyhead Harpies on it. The clear reminders of his friends helped ground him in the moment.
Perhaps it was a bad idea to listen to Draco's insomniac rambling at eleven at night. But what was he supposed to do? The man had just showed up on his doorstop with his work documents in one hand and a tall energy drink in the other. He was convinced he could crack the case by the next morning. (This strong drive was all because of a stupid comment their supervisor made about his work ethic.)
Malfoy didn’t notice his outburst. He was looking at the ground. His hair was a bit longer than it had been the last time Harry had seen him. Filled out his robes more, though. Reminiscent of when they were younger, both young and spry, treating each other as silly childhood rivals. Harry was struck by how much
The contempt Draco has for his secondary gender is immeasurably high and this is only making it higher. He
And he hasn't come to this conclusion all by himself; he tried to be a "good omega" and bottom for his boyfriend. Draco thought that's what Harry wanted from him. Back when they were both nervous fifteen-year-olds with no experience other than some handy adult magazines and, in Harry's case, Ron's older brothers giving him the birds and the bees.
His cock is hot against Draco's. His knot has even started forming. How cute. Draco wraps his hand around it firmly as Harry sits back down on his lap. Harry whines pathetically and Draco increases his grip a bit more. Just to make his mouth fall open and hear his panting. Draco's heat is no doubt pouting that he's not getting such a magnificent knot inside him. But his heat will just have to cope, alright?
In fact, the room was different than when Dumbledore was headmaster. Everything was neat and tidy, the furniture all matching and the books organized. Some of the portraits hung up on the walls had thick pieces of cloth draped over them and it reminded Harry of Mrs. Black in Grimmauld Place, whose screams can’t be placated unless she’s covered up. He’d never noticed that when Dumbledore was alive.
Days leading to the full moon always filled Remus with uncharacteristic aggression. Specifically sexual aggression. Which Sirius loved to capitalize on by adding James into the mix, fueling the wolf-like possessiveness up to max levels. Not enough to hurt James, of course, but enough to make Sirius' hips sore for hours.
But then there it was: the thin pale scar slowly making its appearance above his brow, splitting the dark hair at the very edge of his eyebrow in two.
The next round of stinging jinxes were just as satisfying as the previous.  A break does great things to give James and his body some time to let go of that tension. It also makes him
. Instead, she was just called to the Headmistress' office and explained why she wouldn't be given any of those roles.
Shaking himself out of his anxieties, Draco muttered, “Everyone will just think I cursed you so I could be playing sooner.”
"It's a long story. I really do work for the Ministry. I really am investigating excessive Dreamless Sleep incidents. I just..." He sighed and sat down on the floor, his back pressed against where Draco was just pinning him moments before.
Draco was tired of waiting. He cast a charm to hide his school robes to keep anyone from stealing them and pushed open the curtain. Blessedly, the conversation didn’t immediately die down. Nobody noticed as he kept close to the walls and slunk past bodies in different states of undress.
If he had any hand in fucking everything up, then it was because he wanted to exacerbate the situation. Just get it all over with.
The first few jinxes always took a while for James to recover from but when they got into a rhythm, it felt like second nature. Teddy never stung him in the same place twice and was always looking into James' eyes before stinging him again. Just in case he was too weak or rattled to speak their safe word, Teddy could read his expressions and decide stop if they see the need for it.
Blaise helped him put up posters and photographs, before they even got together. When their relationship was a rocky friendship that bloomed from get-togethers at Seamus' place. Blaise honestly helped remind him how to decorate his home— she was one of his only friends who had a history of hedonism and collecting nice items just for the hell of it. She was the one who convinced Harry that it's okay to own more than five shirts. It's okay to spend extra on gourmet food and deluxe accessories, especially since he had money to spare.
The dormitory bed was big enough for all three of them. Remus was on top of him and James under. Sirius felt like he was precious in their arms, like he was being cradled between the two boys with utmost importance.
. Draco dropped his wand in surprise when he first got pulled away. He really wanted it now. He wanted a lot of things. Most of all, he wanted the vine to stop
"Was it worth getting your sick fantasies about fucking your straight, dead best friend sucked out of you by dementors in Azkaban?"
Draco thinks about that. He wonders how Harry would be in his rut. He wants to experience that. He wants to tease him until he cries, taunt him while he grinds mindlessly into a mattress. Would he still want to be filled up?
There was still a particularly haunted look in his eyes. Probably plagued by nightmares. Draco could relate. He bet some of those nightmares were caused by him.
He looked back up at whoever the fuck was in his home. "Who are you then?" He asked, cursing the emotional voice crack. Where had all the years of practicing the classic Malfoy Intimidation gone?
Harry blinks back out of focus as Slughorn adds this information to his lesson. His face feels hot after crying like that in front of his entire class. Gryffindors
They didn’t speak about the Seeker position for the first two days, despite plenty of opportunities. They lived in the same room, for Merlin’s sake. They had two classes together and they had Quidditch practice for one hour every day after dinner. Yet neither brought up the issue with their positions nor did they have any other conversations.
He raises his hand and asks if he could be excused to get away from the Amortentia. Slughorn responds with an apologetic yes, so Harry rushes out of the classroom with his book bag in hand. The front of his trousers felt a bit tight from the earlier daydream. Luckily their school robes were well-equipped to hide embarrassing things like this.
This was one of the first fics I ever wrote for kinktober. I also remember staying up untill three a.m. writing because I managed to find an incredible rhythm and didn't want to lose the characters' voices. Hah, good times.
these specific potions were on sale. It was all because of that sickening Witch Weekly article. All because of that disgusting journalist Magical Mary. (Obviously a pseudonym, but if Draco wrote the trash they did he would want to remain anonymous too.)
His girlfriend had a mischievous smile. "Why not? Can't be that hard? Do you have any ideas for our first product?"
Harry looked over the tables at all the other students so he wouldn’t have to see his best friends’ concern displayed so explicitly on their faces. The new Gryffindors looked promising. A rambunctious pack of eleven-year-olds. He could see their need to prove themselves, coming from the same House as Harry Potter. A large part of him wanted to grab all of them by the front of their shirts and talk to them about why idolizing him wasn’t a good idea.
It was easy to set their wand down on the bedside table and sit next to James' body. They kissed him deeply and James matched their energy with just as much emotion. Probably more so, if they were being honest. Teddy reached their hand down and wrapped it around their lover's prick. They weren't using any lube, but they figured James would be too frenzied to wait for them to put some on their hand.
Maybe if Draco had noticed earlier how withdrawn he'd gotten in the past few months. Maybe if he was able to tell him to stop pouring over ancient magical texts on Dark magic. Maybe if Harry wasn't so bloody stubborn. Maybe if Draco was kinder. Maybe maybe maybe.
“I could get him for you,” Ron said. “Without his minions around it should be easy to just levitate him around the castle.”
He allowed himself to cry for a while. Rubbed his palms into his eyes so hard that star burst in his vision when he opened them again. His entire face felt swollen and hot.
"Wow! Thanks! You're... wow!" He clapped Zygmunt's shoulder again. "Thanks a lot, Ziggie! This will be truly helpful."
Harry's barely gotten used to the rhythm when she puts the vibrator back on his dick. He was so sensitive his eyes stung with tears.
"Lucky us," Draco purrs and meets Harry in a deeper, longer kiss. Harry picks him up and sets him on his desk, nearly knocking over the potion he had been just about to send out. Narcissa pities whoever that potion is going to.
"I don't want you to see me differently..." Draco mutters. He doesn't know how he'll cope if his boyfriend of two years decides to treat him like shitty alphas treat omegas just because he had his heat. "After this is over, I still want to fuck you."
Well, he is alone in this classroom. And it's late so it isn't like many people are even awake right now. He could indulge in a little fantasy, right? It's hard to say no when Gellert is licking his bottom lip and slowly pushing his trousers down his hips. Albus removes his own robes and trousers then sits on the cold stone floor. The chill reaches his bottom through his thin underwear.
He knew that Ron and Hermione would give him shit for not updating them on what was happening in his life. They were probably under the assumption that he’d been kidnapped by Nymphs or something due to his absence. But he held Draco in his arms, a concept he’d never be able to imagine a mere two years ago. And Draco was finally warming up. Harry’s world always revolved around Draco Malfoy and he believed it always would. The only thing that should’ve surprised him about the situation was that it hadn’t happened sooner.
The door to their bathroom creaked open and out came Malfoy, wearing silk blue pajamas (of course it’s silk) and drinking a hot drink from a mug. Harry frowned.
He was holding something in his hands, a box. His hands played with the corners of it and kept rolling it around and around. Must be a nervous habit. But he wasn’t saying anything. Draco groaned.
Narcissa reached out her hand. Like she wanted to rub his shoulder and physically comfort him. She set her jaw and put her hand back down in her lap.
Hermione's cheeks light up and he rolls her eyes. Pansy always takes a bit more time to reach climax, which is quite fun but not the best when they're under time constraints. Which they currently are, as dinner should be over in just a short while. Pansy sneaks one more quick kiss on Hermione's breast before they get covered by her bra again. The skin feels a bit sticky under her clothes but it's the ultimate price she must pay.
Draco's arse was pert and smooth when he finally pulled down the briefs. Milky white. Unblemished. Sirius wanted to mark it up black and blue. Show the Malfoy brat what it's
He turned his head, hopefully casually, and met his eyes. Fuck. Potter looked like he was doing well, so much better than he was during his family’s trials. He’d put on weight, his shoulders had broadened more, there were sparse hairs on his chin that indicated possible growth of a beard. Draco couldn’t help but admire his masculinity. After being denied his own for so long, not to the fault of anyone around him, he realized he was feeling adequate next to Potter. It was unfamiliar.
Draco moans when Harry kneels down in front of the bed and takes his cock in his mouth. Immediately, he comes and has to take deep breaths because
There's no way to explain the sparks of pleasure that explode and catch fire inside Hermione when Pansy finally gives in and sucks on her nipples. Giving each one tantalizing attention before moving on to the other. Consistently keeping her entertained and aroused by reaching a hand up to twist and squeeze the nipple not being touched by her tongue.
Zygmunt was nearly done with this chapter of his book. He was exhausted with writing, but it was better than leaving his isolated home in the Hebrides for countless awful interviews. Every so-called journalist was dying to get their hands on the reclusive potions master who created a number of advantageous potions.
She suddenly looked hesitant. Her bottom lip disappeared between her front teeth, and she only released it to ask, “Would you mind terribly asking your mother if I could borrow that book? Not many textbooks mention the discoveries made by witches. A lot of them are focused on concepts discovered by wizards only.”
He imagines going up to Malfoy, catching him scheming when he goes and disappears some nights. This time, Harry would be the one to tackle him against one of Hogwarts' solid stone walls. The corridor would be abandoned, so late at night. It would be just the two of them. Malfoy would gasp when he hit the wall, his pink bottom lip hanging open slightly.
Ron and Hermione were staring at him when he focused his attention back to the table. They both wore the same expression. Worried and desperate to see if he was going to be okay. To be honest, Harry was kind of sick of seeing that expression.
Their hands slid into one another like a glove. Palm against palm. It was the nicest touch Draco’s gotten since the beginning of the school year. And this was Harry Potter’s hand. Emotions bubbled up inside his chest, threatening to drip down his face and blur his vision, but he shoved them back down. He dropped the handshake first.
Charlie Weasley hasn't changed much since the Battle of Hogwarts, otherwise known as The Last Fucking Time Draco Saw Him (And, what he thought, Would Be The Only Time). Despite the weather, he looks like he has tanned skin but, upon further inspection, Draco realizes that it's all freckles. He doesn't know how he forgot about that. There are more scars on his skin than before: claw marks, burns, a small, nasty-looking bite mark in between his thumb and forefinger.
"Can I?" She asks with a voice so innocent it feels sinful that Hermione knows what exactly she's asking to do.
. A line in one of the ancient texts that gripped Draco's brain like a fog. A stroke of thunder and lightning deafened his cries once more. Harry promises him that he won't need to touch the dagger. That he's been cultivating, conserving, his magic to dig out his own heart. It's morbid and wrong and Draco never imagined magic would ever be used in such a way. Harry says he must bear witness.
Nonbinary Teddy Lupin has a special place in my heart <3 In this fic they have a penis, but I had a lot of fun imagining how much being a metamorphmagus must rule (Here's to hoping my writing add-on didn't auto-correct their pronouns 🤞)
Ron's surveying the area, subtly staring at other people enjoying their time. He suddenly perks up, nudges Harry's shoulder, and points out a woman drinking a brightly colored drink. He raises his eyebrows.
When there was nothing but a damp spot from Draco's tongue, Sirius let go of his soft, blond hair. He gently turned the boy over and picked him up. It was a bit awkward (it always was, what with Draco's long limbs and being nearly two inches taller), but he managed to get them both up the stairs without injury.
"You're welcome for providing such ample entertainment," he sneered. Then he felt like a child again. Then he remembered that Potter read his diary from when he really was a child.
Harry's bedroom was bigger than he was used to. A double bed with lush blue covers sat right in the middle of the room. And it was
Draco laughed wetly. He went quiet and for a moment Sirius thought he had fallen asleep. Then he said softly, sleepily, "I care about you too."
The potion was warmed by his hand, yet Tertius' hand felt warmer. Tertius smiled at the little glass vial and turned that smile towards Zygmunt.
Harry squeezed his thighs together and Blaise's eyes darted down. She bit her lower lip, sliding her warm hand up his leg. He was so glad he was only wearing boxers when she arrived. Less to take off.
Well, he might as well call and apologize for last night. He can't imagine it was the greatest situation for her to be in.
"I told him to leave. And I said not to say he loved me if he didn't mean it. He's a Gryffindor, so he probably interpreted that as me telling him not to talk to me
, Harry thinks as tears well up. Maybe he is getting a bit too buzzed. He sniffs and drinks a sip of his water.
“Malfoy—” Draco jumped, uneasy by the questioning tone in Potter’s voice. He turned around slowly, already feeling a bit humiliated that he reacted at all to his name being spoken aloud like that. Might as well leave him in a little bit of suspense, he decided. Because of course, Potter would join the Quidditch team. Why wouldn’t he do that? How was he supposed to keep the tinder of his fame bright and burning if he wasn’t constantly doing things that put him in the spotlight?
His gender was never an issue in Slytherin. He was banned from the girls’ dorms when the corridor leading to the wing of dormitories started closing in on him, just as they would with any other Slytherin male. And Pansy was a close friend from childhood; she knew all about his past and would threaten other Slytherins who had taken issue with it, even as an eleven-year-old.
A dark owl tapped her beak on his window and he opened it, despite the rain, to let her in. She had a letter taped to her ankle. He unrolled it carefully as it was a bit damp due to the weather.
Blessed silence. Narcissa takes a deep breath and tries to steady herself. Hopefully those two were humiliated enough to put an end to the shenanigans for the night. Narcissa
Once he looked up he was faced with Potter’s face. He was just staring at him, smiling shyly. Like he wasn’t expecting to give him the wand that night either. He was breathing quickly, overwhelmed with emotions. Something in his chest pulled him forward, and before he could really think about it Potter was leaning in as well. Their lips met.
He was crying again, this time from emotional release rather than physical pain. Sirius cradled his head and hummed. He wasn't typically a soothing person, but Draco always brought out a nurturing side of him he didn't know he had.
He pulled Draco away from the front door by his wrists, pushing him over to the sitting room and over the arm of the sofa. Before the younger man could gather his senses, Sirius crouched down and spread his arse cheeks apart. He spat on that winking hole and used his thumb to move the saliva around his ring and a bit inside of him. Draco whimpered and wiggled in a pathetic interpretation of a victim's struggle.
It's such a successful night that he hardly notices the argument the woman and her blond friend get into before they storm out of the pub.
“Goodnight, Potter. We’ll talk in the morning.” Very quietly, very quickly, Draco walked over to his bed and got in it, pulling the duvet over his head. He kept his wand close to his chest as if it would somehow still his quickly beating heart.
The woman is dressed like she's ready for a night of dancing. This pub really isn't the place for dancing.
Draco gasped, genuinely gasped, as Potter gripped his shoulders and pulled him close. He was an inch or two taller than him but was still able to shove his cold nose into Potter’s warm neck, the black hair tickling his forehead.
Harry grinned warmly at her. “Everything’s going great! Just a little bump in the road’s all. We’ll give you your answer soon.”
The walk to the Quidditch pitch was familiar, fairly routine for the majority of this new school year. But instead of moving past the changing rooms and studying under the audience’s seating, he was pressing his back against the brick wall of the changing room. He couldn’t get his legs to move especially because he could hear voices coming from inside.
For a moment, he allows himself to breathe. He reaches behind and prods a bit at his hole. He's so wet. He didn't know he
It's getting rather ridiculous, Albus thinks. Though... he can't say the attention is entirely unwelcome. It's the most he's been given by anybody since his sister's accident. And Gellert has so much time on his hands after being expelled from Durmstrang Institute and unable to enter Hogwarts so late in the term.
It's evening now. Everyone should be busy eating dinner. Hopefully Pansy was able to make a solid excuse as a Slytherin prefect. Hermione understands the decision McGonagall made not to give her Head Girl or Prefect responsibilities. She has more work to catch up on than she'd like to admit and that on top of those duties would absolutely do her in. Still... she would have like to be
Harry's face looks naked without his glasses. Bare, transparent, vulnerable. His hair is flipped up and Ron can see his fabled scar clearly, even in the dark dormitory room. Ron ignores the squirming his stomach's doing inside his body and pulls up the duvet.
"I thought you wouldn't want to see me," Harry said, staring at his anxious hands. His fingers tumbled over each other and in between and were just plain
They were on their third date. A dinner at an Italian restaurant, Hank's pick. He talked a bit about how he always had to go there for his aunt's birthday but could never enjoy it when he was young. Draco ordered whatever Hank got, which turned out to be some dish with lemon and mushrooms with a strong taste he couldn't quite recognize.
Harry frowned. Malfoy was an Occlumens? Did Snape teach him? He remembered the lessons Professor Snape gave him, as useless as they were in the long run. He accidentally met Malfoy's eye and furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco set up two mugs and then got a pot on the stove. Household spells came naturally to him, having been surrounded by them all his life. His mother used to grow frustrated when he constantly asked her for things until she taught him the spells herself. It was so much simpler using magic. All he had to do was utter a small incantation, and the ingredients figured themselves out. Usually, he would use his wand to stir the hot chocolate, but he supposed a wooden spoon would do the trick.
Draco listened, hands reaching up to run across the neat scars on his chest. He wondered what Potter would say if he saw them. Not daring to look further down than his chest, he idly wondered if Potter would scream and run to tell his friends if he found out exactly who he was talking to. What kind of person he was talking to. Guilt gnawed in Draco’s stomach; he felt like he was dirtying something that was perfect. Potter was so good and Draco didn’t feel that he deserved any piece of that goodness.
His face was flushed red and Draco didn't know if it was from the wine or anticipation. (He hoped it was the latter.)
Sure enough the sound of clicking heeled boots echoed in the emptiness of the corridor. Pansy's black, pin-straight hair flips as she looks over her shoulders to ensure she's alone. She must know Hermione is there already, because she stops a few feet in front of the closet and gives the space a good, hard stare.
The bell above the shop door jingled and he placed the inventory list down. Tied the apron (a part of his uniform, not something he would wear on his own) by his waist and left the back room.
It doesn't help that the person he is supposed to be meeting decided to be ten minutes late and leave him stranded at the airport. He's wearing his thickest jacket from home (because, honestly, he isn't stupid; he knew it would be could) and it still isn't enough to block out the icy chill. He sighs and grumbles, looking on in disdain at the puff of breath that escaped his lips.
Albus feels his face burn. Does this mirror believe he... desires Gellert? But no, that can't be. He's so obnoxious and he's sixteen and, above all, he sees Albus as a teacher, a mentor. It would be beyond inappropriate for him to think this way.
stretched thin, certainly.) He looked at Tertius, who smiled back even more, then at the Headmaster.
It all became too much. He shook his head and shut the laptop closed. Blaise would arrive any minute, anyway.
It didn't take long for him to come, not at all. It was almost too soon. But, then again, Blaise was whispering in his ear all the different magical toys she would make specifically to use on him while he was being stimulated.
on his stained robes. (That's how insatiable their teenage hormones were; they fucked fully clothed in their school uniforms.) He offers to do the same for Draco, but he refuses with a wave of his hand.
Harry reaches his hand up and touches Draco's cheek. Draco grasps his wrist to hold it there for him. "You'll always have me. This is the greatest gift I could possibly give you, my love."
He was growling as he finished the statement. He hated his family. He hated that he had known such vile people existed in the world, that he was related to them. That he was related to such a spoiled, stupid, conservative, childish person with stupid, traditional, harmful beliefs. Draco was a living representation of everything Sirius wanted to strike out of existence.
Draco whimpered as it prodded at his hole, the dull point of the tip dipping inside. It was dry, but luckily not as rough as he was fearing. It hurt. A fresh wave of tears fell down his cheeks. He didn't want to look down and acknowledge his trembling body or the way his cock was red and sensitive, probably leaking pre cum.
James blushed, his freckles standing out as if under a spotlight. He didn't respond verbally, but Teddy noticed the full-body shudder. They noticed the stirring of James' cock against his thigh.
"Mrs Granger-Weasley, Draco. We are drawing an audience." Narcissa cast her eyes around the pub and then hooked her arm in Draco's arm, pulling him away from Granger-Weasley. "Perhaps Mr Potter can clear this matter to everyone's mutual satisfaction."
Passing Foyles, Harry stopped and backtracked, entering the overcrowded bookstore and wandering around for several minutes. He selected several books and paid for them before exiting back onto the street.
It wasn't until Draco's illicit trysts had come to light that she had severed their relationship. Narcissa missed another female presence in the manor desperately, but she understood that the things she had allowed wouldn't be tolerated by today's modern witch. She herself was rather put-out by her son's outlook on life, but she knew that there was more to his sullen discontent than just his circumstances. In spite of his lackadaisical approach to his relationships and life, Draco absolutely cherished and treasured Scorpius.
Most witches and wizards appeared slightly awkward whilst flying, even Draco as it wasn't a much-used skill once Apparition had been learned. Still, despite only flying occasionally with the Auror's semi-monthly Quidditch pick-up games, Harry was just as smooth as he had been during school.
If nothing else, Andromeda could appeal to the kinship of motherhood she and Hermione would share. and Narcissa would respect that.
Narcissa inclined her head and turned to the window, waiting with him in solidarity. He watched her watch the horizon and wondered idly how many hours she had spent like this when he was younger.
Draco barely had time to wonder about the last guest when he heard the doorbell sound throughout the house.  An elderly male elf entered the room and Draco drew in a breath. His mouth went dry and he could hear Astoria as she dissolved into unladylike sniggering, but all Draco could do was just stare.
George slapped Harry on the back firmly before holding him at arm's length and looking him over. "You look good, Harry. 'Bout time you came back."
"Father!" Scorpius shouted and scrambled to his feet, racing around Theo and throwing himself into Draco's arms.
"You did what was needed, Harry. No one could have predicted the laws the Wizengamot would pass down."
He waved his hand at the group of them. "Listen to yourselves. You sound like the bigots we fought against!"
"Harry's returned," Ron said, his voice soft and he tossed the powder into the flames. "I can't believe he didn't come to us first, though."
Draco shook his head and turned back to the table where he'd found the mug, but nothing else struck him as their one piece had. Flagging down a sales clerk, he held up the stein.
He continued after turning from Ron to look at both Malfoy and Hermione. "I may not be a parent, but I know what I would want from my child in this situation; their enrichment and happiness. This world is different from the one we grew up in, and if we don't want to repeat the mistakes of our parents, then we'd all best be a little more tolerant. Many things could have been different back then if we had."
She bustled into his room, rolls of parchment in her arms and floating memos circling her head. An attractive male assistant trailed behind her, plucked some notes out of the air, marked them with a quill and sent them off with a flick of his wand.
Harry whined and squeezed his prick, not saying anything else as Draco dragged out of him once more and slowly pushed back in. He closed his eyes, canting his hips trying to entice Draco into finishing.
She began to dig in her purse. "Merlin, I can't believe it. Let me see how many pounds I have on me as I want it back."
have as I have lost track." He ran a hand over the back of his head. "Also, you have to act surprised as it's supposed to be a secret."
She, too, chose her child as one of the stars in her life, but like Harry, her second desire was the world during spring. It spoke volumes that Narcissa Malfoy was entirely content in her life after all that had happened.
Harry shook his head, even though he felt a naughty thrill shiver through him at the thought of overriding Narcissa's tea desires. "I'm certain whatever Narcissa ordered will be fine."
James' body contorts at the touch harder than he had to any of the jinxes. He was so sensitive at this point. His cock was dripping onto his soft stomach and Teddy ached to put the head in their mouth. But not yet. They flick the head of his cock so it smacks wetly against James' skin.
The day before was rainy and his boots were sinking in the soft, pliable mud of the field. He’d heard over the summer of a muggle sport called football and watched on the tiny muggle television moving images of men slipping in mud while trying to kick the black and white checkered ball. Watching it made him feel even luckier to be a wizard. A rainy day at Hogwarts was almost ideal; the castle would make its candles and fireplaces warmer and entering the castle after spending the day outside felt like being wrapped up in a handmade woolen blanket and given a steaming mug of hot chocolate.
The door to the cart swung open, and Luna Lovegood drifted in dreamily. She sat next to Harry and looked up at him with a gentle smile. Her silver eyes betrayed nothing of what was going on in her mind. She looked like she was doing much better than during the War. Her cheeks were filled out more and her light blonde hair held a healthy glow. Harry heard she was dating the grandson of a famous magizoologist. She took a seat beside Harry, turning slightly to face him.
Beside her, obscured from his vision as he was sitting, is a blond androgynous person, with cheerful gray eyes and long, pale fingers. Oh god, Harry thinks. He doesn't want her, he wants to be with
“Do you really think it’ll be helpful?” Madame Hooch was asking, her voice appearing a bit like she didn’t truly believe in what McGonagall was saying.
He growled low to himself and nearly kicked at the large door in front of him. When will that damned Headmaster leave his office and talk to him? How much work did he need to do? It wasn't as if he had any students' papers to grade any longer.
Madame Hooch nodded, pleased at the lack of hostility. “Alright you two, I’ll give you a week to decide who will be the front Seeker and who will be the backup Seeker.” She frowned and squinted. “Weasley! Get into the Keeper group!”
, Draco thought as he surveyed the small room. It was smaller than his old Slytherin room, with only two beds sitting across the room from each other. The dormitory for the eight years was a large building right on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. McGonagall said it was only to be used as a dormitory for that year and afterward would be transfigured into a proper home for various of Hagrid’s creatures for his class. Draco couldn’t help but frown at the idea of potentially living in a Hippogriff stable.
He's panting and almost asks if he could reciprocate when he hears a stuttering moan tumble form Harry's lips. He notices the other teen's hand is shoved down his striped red pajama pants. Ron grins when he sees Harry removing his hand, cum covering his fingers.
Harry spent a bit of time in the common room to catch up with Hermione. She’d stayed up to write an essay for her Arithmancy class. Ron jumped over the sofa to sit next to her, resting his head on her shoulder in the hopes of catching a few winks, but she protested too much at his sweaty and dirty skin. He laughed at the antics, trying very, very hard to ignore the blond head going up the stairs.
," Malfoy would gasp when they finally pull apart. The blond would grasp his wrist and pull his hand to his warm, hard crotch. With pleading eyes he'd refuse to break eye contact with Harry.
Malfoy was thin, thinner than during their sixth year. He was wearing a plain black and white suit. The sleeve covered his left forearm.
Het t4t is good for the soul, I hear. Trans Harry and trans Blaise, my beloved. This fic was originally going to be a lot longer, and the original was supposed to be a drarry fic. But then the characters jumped away from me and it became Harry/Blaise. And
. No, not Hank Allen. The man who represented Hank Allen. Without thinking, Draco's feet hastened to meet up with him before he left the building. When he finally caught up he stopped him by grabbing his shoulder. The man stopped abruptly and turned to look at him.
"No. Of course not. I'm sorry if I came on too harsh. I think you're a very admirable person for staying in control as long as you did."
The vine worked his cock faster. Was it trying to distract him from the pain? Draco felt like a child, weeping while his mouth was full of greenery and his bum was being violated. His entire being was violated
Classes went better than he was expecting. None of the professors were explicitly rude or condescending to him but they also wouldn’t cut him any slack. Some teachers even marked him down when he couldn’t get a partner when they required one. Because nobody wanted to be his partner.
Draco dropped his hands away from the man's legs as if he had been burned. He took a few steps back and tripped on a damned shoe. Luckily, he caught himself on his bed. He sat down slowly and closed his eyes, head tilted backward.
A flash of white then James was gasping and writhing in quiet agony. It only took a moment for his mind and body to remember the feeling of a stinging jinx, to remember how to recover, and he settled down. His chest was heaving and his mouth stretched into a lazy grin.
Teddy stood, leaning against the door to James' bedroom. Across the room, swept in wide painterly strokes, was the deep orange of sunset. The colors heightened the experience of watching smooth skin, blemished only by a galaxy of light brown freckles, being uncovered by plain clothing. Typically, James liked wearing extravagant displays of his family's wealth, but for nights like these, with just the two of them, he opt for a more humble approach.
They're supposed to be investigating a dragon egg smuggling ring. Draco told him he'd figured out where the culprits have been meeting for the past few weeks. Harry wanted to finish this case too, he was numbed by hearing the same information over and over and over again. So he jumped on the opportunity.
Charlie smiles a bit. It's the first time Draco's ever had one from him. He hopes he leaves soon so Draco can swoon in private. Unfortunately the cold that creeps in from Charlie's open door is enough to persuade him to leave soon after Charlie does. He grabs his suitcase and trudges through the snow to the cabin. Charlie presses his car keys and locks it from the porch.
But McGonagall didn’t waver. “It is under my experiences that these young adults are… traumatized. Having a comforting sense of the past, or just connecting with the rest of the students, may heal some of our students.”
Blaise smiled wickedly. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? Being blindfolded and edged for hours, unsure of when I'll increase or decrease. I wouldn't even need to ask you to tell me when you're going to cum. Your body has always been so honest."
He felt he was being split open as the vine traveled further inside of him. He was only able to scream for a few seconds before he was gagged with another vine, wrapping around his skull. His teeth impaled the plant and he gagged at the taste of acidity touching his tongue.
Hermione nods quickly, holding her breath when Pansy pushes her cable knit sweater up and over her bust. The chill of the air sends goosebumps popping up on the exposed parts of her breasts. She's still wearing a bra, of course; not even the cloak gives Hermione enough confidence to go completely bra-less. (Pansy can and does go bra-less on some occasions, though not when she's wearing special lingerie she wants Hermione to see later.)
"Of course you did, pervert. It's obvious. I think nearly everybody on our floor thinks we're already hooking up or secretly married."
"Shut the hell up. I don't want to hear it," he growled. He pointed an accusing finger at the other man.
"— that my medical charts are all right here. Including my crazy werewolf blood and shit. I consent to you using them for your research."
Draco looked at Potter, really looked at him. He had intense eyes, always has had them. They looked into your very core and judged you from the inside out. His eyes didn’t glitter or remind him of any specific gem, but they reminded him of river stones when the water was rushing over them. Alive. He envied that quality.
Stupid things like writing every complaint and whim that ever entered his immature brain in a diary.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Why would I do that? What could I possibly gain from making everyone hate me more for touching their precious Potter, as well as encouraging the Aurors to put me under probation or something? I bet they’re already aching to do so, I wouldn’t give them a reason.”
Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were trailing behind him. Granger had a stretched smile across her face, obviously a polite smile. Draco has had experience with those. Her frizzy hair was large and voluminous and Draco wondered if it would be wrong to offer Wizarding hair products to her. He didn’t know if she would appreciate it or not.
Potter was standing there, his Quidditch robes fitted across his chest a bit tighter than in previous years. Ironic, because the chest of Draco’s robes were actually a bit looser than they had been. Beside him was his redheaded sidekick, who was glaring at him almost like he was a gnome digging up his mother’s precious peonies. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had seen Weasley stare at him in such a manner. His memory of his family’s trials was blurry at best, his mind so fully overstimulated and in desperate need to process everything that has happened in the past few years.
"So good. You're so good for me, Harry. Could stay inside this tight hole all day. Wanna make you come over and over again."
It was different than when they held hands. But, not different at all. There were similarities in skin, the softness. The unexpected roughness of it being another human being. Draco’s never kissed like this before. He’s only kissed one other person and it was an experimental kiss; Pansy convinced him that it wouldn’t hurt to try. This wasn’t like that.
Blaise fluffed up her jacket. "Nice, isn't it? Pansy and Draco sent it from Romania. Did you know he's apparently been infatuated with Charlie Weasley the last few weeks? I wonder if it'll last..."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. After great deliberation, he said, "Truth," as nonchalantly as he could. But Harry could see the tell-tale twitch of his fingers that betrayed his anxiety. He took a drink of the wine.
Draco felt strange about their last conversation. At first, he thought Potter was trying to rile him up. Bringing up a Muggle reference in order to make him feel stupid. But it seemed like he genuinely didn’t know about wizarding traditions. In all honesty, he was raised with arguments supporting traditionalism that he could’ve rolled off his tongue to Potter in an instant.
“Well, let’s talk,” Draco agreed. “We could stop by the kitchens and get some real hot chocolate, if that would help.”
Draco opens the trunk of the red van and lugs his suitcase inside. He makes sure all of the zippers are closed so his clothing doesn't fly everywhere. Then he closes the trunk door and makes his way to the passenger seat. This takes a moment because he remembers that they drive on the opposite side of the road in Romania. Which means his seat is opposite, as well. At this point, it's just another annoying obstacle in the way of him entering the heated car.
Hermione hunches over at first, but over time her confidence grows until she is running through the corridors to their assigned meeting place. It's no wonder how Harry feels so invincible when he owns items such as this cloak.
until it happened. And now he doesn't want it to stop. Classes will be over soon and these corridors will be filled with students trying to get to their next ones. A pair like them, in a position like this, will garner too much attention for either of them to enjoy.
And, yeah, okay, the parselmouth sleep talking is new and not typical of most people. But it shouldn't be doing this to Ron. It shouldn't make him feel this way.
(They were smart though and it wasn’t as if he was close with any of them. He couldn’t imagine anyone choosing to go against the grain and just accepting him. Especially because of all the chaos he forced upon them in their seventh year.)
How long has Malfoy been looking at him? Why was he looking at him like that? Harry notices a pink tinge on the other boy's sickly skin. Did he see what Harry saw?
Somehow, the pathetic situation isn't enough to deter him from using the mirror's image as masturbation material. It's when Gellert leans in to kiss his cheek, brow furrowed in concentration as he comes in spurts, that does it for Albus. He cries out and it's so quiet in the room that his needy voice echoes all around him.
"You didn't check my medical charts before harassing me? You must be an amateur... my name is Draco Malfoy."
His back was pressed against the wall a few feet away from the kitchen door. It was cool against his back. Long pale hands bracketed his head.
Harry wants to thrust his fist in the air in celebration. He shouts, "We're down here! I think it's a basement?"
Especially because he was looking so smart; donned in the saffron léine his mother spent quite a pretty penny on for his fourteenth birthday.
Harry says a lot of things over the roar. Draco's afraid he won't be able to bear witness; he's crying so hard that the world in front of him is a blur.
“Please get some sleep, Harry.” She looked insistent. “You may think your glamours are top-notch, but I can still see the tiredness under your eyes. Please.”
It was hard to notice the box being pushed off his bed with Blaise's lips against his. She wasn't wearing any lip gloss, so the experience was a lot less sticky than usual. He slipped his tongue in her mouth as they moved further down the bed. Harry was nearly lying down and Blaise was on top of him. He rutted his hips up.
"I hate you so much," Hermione whines, sliding her hands down Pansy's back until she has a firm grip on her arse. She fondles the flesh experimentally and experiences a thrill of satisfaction when she sees the subtle spreading of legs Pansy does.
The man frowned, then his eyes sparked in recognition. "Oh, Draco Malfoy. So Harry told you, yeah?" He looked around sheepishly. "Look, I told him it was a bad idea. He was convinced you would hate him otherwise and he wanted you to get to know him for his personality and not who you think he is."
"Er, sorry about this. My mates bet me 20 pounds to ask for your number." He smiles awkwardly. "Sorry to put you on the spot like this."
His mind trailed back to that sliver of pale stomach he saw earlier. How far did that paleness stretch? He shook his head sharply. What was he thinking? Even if the person in his fantasies wasn’t someone he’s held so much hostility for in the past, it was still wrong to distract himself with those fantasies instead of trying to help.
And a few moments later, just that happened. Draco slipped the top over his head and suppressed gagging. He ignored the chuckles he heard from the other side of the curtain and put on the shorts. Wearing it made him feel like he needed to be disinfected. At least he didn’t need magical clothing to make his chest flat anymore; he couldn’t imagine having that taken from him and being exposed in that way.
Weasley huffed but didn’t say anything more. Although it was supposed to be a study session, Draco and Granger did a majority of any actual studying. Weasley pulled out a stack of Self-Shuffling playing cards, let them do their thing, and then started a game with Harry.
He gazed intently at the curtain, waiting for some sort of evil creature to slither out and attack him.
Potter flinched and then took two large steps forward. He thrust the hand holding the box out in front of him and Draco got a better look at it. A wand case carved beautifully. Made with the hands of a master, of someone who’s dedicated their entire life to the craft. Shapes were carved into the corner, making it unique.
Number seven included the idea of using polyjuice potion to become a new, attractive person for your partner. As unethical as the entire premise was, Draco was shocked by how many people truly believed it. Why on earth would you be sexually active with someone you weren't attracted to?
And why shouldn't he say yes? "I have no use for it anymore," he reasoned. "Blasted Headmaster thinks I'm too much of a child to enter the competition. Might as well give it to someone who actually wants my potions."
"I think I was kind of fascinated with you back then too." Potter nodded, mostly to himself. "I was definitely confused with the whole Cho-Cedric thing going on."
Gore has always made Draco's stomach twist into knots. He has a very weak disposition to blood and death and torture. Perhaps it came from the disturbing years in which Voldemort lived in his childhood home, staining each room with vile actions. When he first saw Harry's death he could barely hold himself together; he was lucky his stomach was empty or he would've absolutely spewed all over Hogwarts' crumbling walls.
"We can help, you know," Harry whispers. He doesn't want to break the surface tension of the moment. Eventually, it will break. That's inevitable. But he wants to prolong it for as long as possible.
. His stupid fucking prick still hasn't deflated and is eagerly twitching in the warm, wet hole it's found itself in. Harry's rough hands knead his thighs and arse and Draco wonders if he is put off by how sticky the skin there is.
And, okay, that was the nail in the coffin. He isn't usually competitive. But surely he's not so repulsive as to be unable to get a simple phone number, right? And 20 quid is 20 quid. It should be easy enough. He might not even have to pay for his drinks himself. It's tempting... too tempting.
Everything's all set up. A circular red blanket spread out on the wet grass. Ten candles placed in even segments around the fabric, only lit because of strong charms Harry casted. He's got a dagger beside him and there's a cursed tablet placed in the center of the blanket, just in front of a golden cauldron. Draco's pulled him away from it so they sit at the edge of it all.
The women giggle in the darkness of the broom closet. The world is out there, waiting for them, but Hermione feels as if her whole world is right there with her.
"There's no way you're getting dumped for a good reason. Why don't you ask her out? I'm sure she'd give you a chance."
Now he felt weird about looking at Granger, after thinking about Harry’s friends knowing what his bits looked at. He looked back down at his essay for Arithmancy and tightened his hold on his boyfriend’s hand. There were eyes looking over his essay before he heard a soft gasp.
Minutes or maybe hours later, the gravity of the situation, of what was happening, hit Draco. He pulled away, his lips feeling swollen. Kissing a boy was so much different than kissing a girl. More aggressive, confident. No questioning or insecurity about pleasing the girl. Potter opened his eyes and looked at him, really looked at him.
Honestly, Hermione never thought someone could grow that much. She tends to reject the idea that terrible people can change. It's harder to get hurt when you assume you know what somebody thinks.
This would happen for just long enough to push them both over the edge, Harry imagines. They'd moan and pant into each other's mouth. Harry would shudder at the uncomfortable stickiness in his clothing. Malfoy would say something about a cleaning charm and Harry would laugh. The ridiculousness of the situation would make them both laugh.
Ron stands up and stretches. He stretches until his shoulders scream at him. Then he shuffles over to Harry's bed. Harry still hasn't stopped groaning as if he's in pain. Like his nightmares are causing physical hurt.
The stranger smiled back, looking like reflex. "I'm, er, Hank Allen. I was hoping you could talk to me more about working here?"
"It was awful." He bit his lip. Narcissa would know who the Potters were, surely. She might even know who Harry Potter was. "It was Harry Potter."
Seamus laughed and stood on his toes to kiss his boyfriend deeply. When he pulled away, Dean felt dazed. "I don't know if I should be rewarding such arrogance," Seamus thought aloud.
Hank's face was flushed and he avoided looking directly at Draco's face. Draco swallowed around a lump in his throat. The arm filled with more magic than Albus Dumbledore himself was still so close.
His apartment wasn't small by most standards. But for him, who had access to a manor with ten bedrooms and peacocks strutting around the gardens, it was a bit of a downgrade. But it was also the first place that was ever
“Maybe, in another time, I wouldn’t. But I care about what my mother thinks, and she’s the one I’d hurt the most by being so careless as to get in trouble with Aurors.”
A follow up fic to Day 3: Polyjuice/Body Swap. Because I liked the idea of Narcissa being immortalized in a portrait. And I feel bad for portraits who have to endure this kind of stuff without any way to shield from it lol
It doesn't take long for the sparks to explode in one shattering orgasm. Especially not when Pansy slides her free hand down, slipping under her skirt's waistband, and rubbing against the front of her panties.
The door to the study opened smoothly and Potter walked in. (No, floated in. Those Auror robes were too long, swinging well past his ankles.) His face was completely red up to the roots of his inky black hair.
The last time Harry saw Draco Malfoy was at the Death Eater trials. He’d never been to another courtroom in the Ministry of Magic besides his own hearing, but the structure of the room was very similar. Except he was in the audience that time, and Draco, Narcissa, and Lucius were standing in front of the judge’s towering stand. It was a surreal experience, hearing all of the Malfoy family’s crimes relayed back to them. Having to testify. Harry wouldn’t be able to forget the articles that came out about him being too soft to testify after he spoke in defense of Draco and Narcissa. Lucius, however, was non-negotiable; Arthur Weasley warned him that he would be impossible to defend and it could tarnish the rest of the Malfoy family’s chances.
he knew his eyes were widening and his hands gripped the eggshell pale button-up tightly. Was McGonagall pulling his leg? She must’ve mentioned something about (forced) inter-house unity before he entered the Great Hall. Pansy would be protesting outwardly if she was aware of this, but the little Blaise on his shoulder was giving him a sleazy expression.
"No. Magic is given sparingly to those in my family. My father never developed any magical ability and mine was only expressed when I was fifteen years old. I've been a werewolf since I was an infant."
Harry hasn't moved. Outstretched are his arms, which look like they want to return the embrace. Draco wonders how he's holding it together.
And if he cried a bit in the warmth of Harry's office and his embrace, well, nobody would know but them.
I had a whole different idea in mind for this prompt but it ended up blowing up in my face. I decided to redirect the focus because I kept getting distracted. But this takes place in sixth year so I knew it was going to be a little angsty.
Every time Remus pressed the entirety of his prick inside him, Sirius let out little moans and whimpers. He whined when he pulled out leaving just the tip of his head inside. It had been long since Sirius had come, but he craved the stretch and fullness of a cock inside him.
, for Salazar's sake. I cannot in good conscious send a young boy off wandering by himself in another country. What would your poor mother say?"
The cold is even more apparent in comparison with the hot mouth now having access to all of her chest. Her dark nipples tingle the closer Pansy gets to the areolas and she damn near whimpers when the other woman decides to skip over them entirely to kiss elsewhere on her breasts.
The Quidditch pitch was surprisingly quiet and made a good study spot. Occasionally, the first years would have their flying practices, but even that background noise was tolerable. And if he just hid near the bases of those tall, magnificent stands for the audience then he went unnoticed by everyone.
His mother was confused at first, a little heartbroken that her only daughter is now her only son, but she never turned her back on him. Draco’s father was ecstatic to have a son in the family, though he wasn’t assigned male at birth. His father told him of potions and spells he could use to continue on the family bloodline with his future wife. What nonsense that was. Not only did his Healer say that the mix of the fertility potions along with his steady supply of masculinization potions would be a dangerous concoction, but Draco wasn’t the slightest bit interested in women.
The feeling of Harry's hand on his cock is electric. Ron gasps and struggles to hold in a pathetic, happy whine. Harry is so warm, so much warmer than Ron feels. He wonders if that's another result of how magically powerful he is. Legend had it that Harry Potter's a force of nature, destructive and unnerving. And maybe that was how it was when they were younger, but Ron looks at him and sees a home.
Especially at fourteen. Everything was awkward and, as a bit of a late bloomer, he would write down every weird thought and desire he had. The gay thing wouldn't surprise anyone. Everyone who even paid the Daily Prophet a moment's glance would see the glaring header:
He could get out of this, right? Look for a loophole? Technically he didn't know how obsessed Draco is with him... but he does have assumptions. And if those assumptions were to be judged...
Now, though, he would have to go through that all over again with this new roommate. Slytherin or Hufflepuff would probably be the best possible outcomes for his roommate. A Slytherin would pretend not to care about him, which would hurt but he would learn to live with it, and a Hufflepuff would hold the value of tolerance over all others. He could potentially use his gender to force the Hufflepuff to tolerate him, even if they wouldn’t due to his past actions.
Madame Hooch sighed and was a little choked up as she said, “Well, alright then. It makes sense to me. I’ll make an announcement tonight during dinner.”
Fear struck Draco's chest, but he pushed it away. No, it was more likely that Hank was HIV+ or something. Which they would deal with. Draco had condoms in his bedside drawer, or they didn't need to have penetration at all. He's had partners before with STIs and even got one himself from a particularly bad shag from a dishonest, shitty person. It wasn't the end of the world.
His mouth fell into an easy sneer. “I suppose you’ve come to reclaim your spot, huh?” He bowed. “Well, don’t let scum like me be in your way.”
Draco’s eyes widened. A Quidditch team? He couldn’t deny the void left by not having a way to play the game this year. Even if he did only start playing because of Potter, he did truly love the sport. Loved how students of any gender were on the same team, loved how everybody was treated the same way, loved how nobody questioned his choice of changing robes privately. And, yes, it was a Slytherin team, so there was quite a bit of cheating he would never admit to if anyone ever asked, but they never treated him like his father bought his place on the team.
"Okay, then. Um, if you wouldn't mind just getting me the records for sold potions in the last... seven months? I'll be out of your hair," he laughed as he said this.
Harry frowns. "Pretty confident I never said that last part." He tosses his head back. "But I sure thought it!"
"Hullo, Tertius," he said, cursing that damnable break in his voice that happened every time he got too close to the lad.
"Well, because your lot have been born into lycanthropy, there's an ongoing theory that your physiology is more in balance between a human and a wolf than typical werewolves. For example, if your hair has more or less the same properties as your wolf's fur, then we can analyze other werewolves' hair and extract what we need to provide the proper ingredient for potions."
He switched them around until he was on top of her, scaling down her body while kissing her soft skin. Her cock twitched slightly when he reached it, clearly spent but still trying. Well, this wasn't to get her off. Just to give her pleasure. That's all he wanted to give her now.
Draco's hands tremble as he sees the life leave Harry's face, the thick organ, covered in hot blood, weakly floating towards the cauldron. His husband smiles as it tumbles inside. A great explosion of light and debris flew all around them as lightning struck the inner contents of the cauldron.
Potter seemed to be deciding whether or not to take offense to that on his best friends’ behalf, but Draco wasn’t going to wait. He pushed open the hefty doors of the kitchen and sighed in bliss at the warmth of the room.
Potter sat at a round, small table, probably made with the House Elves in mind and not the students. He sat across from him.
And with that, Potter grabbed his wrist and pulled him away. They didn’t stop running until they reached their shared dorm room.
." Harry actually looks relieved. He almost never swears like a Muggle. "There isn't any universe where I would not want your dick in me, Draco. I just wanted to make you more comfortable."
They walk through the rest of the housing development, all of them so eerily similar that Draco finds it disorienting. “I can’t believe you grew up here,” he tells Potter.
They slaughter the oxen on the solstice. The yard is crusted with a brittle layer of frost that catches the dying light from the sun as it slips beyond sight. The longest night begins with blood. They keep fires going all through the darkness.
“Potter,” he said again, and his surprise was gone, too. He shook his head, slow, side to side. “Gin. A very good gin.” He slid his fresh shot over to Harry. And that was how they’d begun an evening of drinking together, and why they’d ended up stumbling out past midnight, out the back door and into the warm London springtime. It was quiet back in the alley. Muffled, like reality was when you had a particularly good dream. Malfoy’s body was loose and imprecise, and he stopped after a few steps to stand against the building. He looked at Harry, his brows pulled together over his eyes, like he was trying to figure something out.
“I was hoping I could stay here, too,” he says. “While my castle is built nearby, with excruciating slowness. Then—” Harry shrugs. “I was thinking we go back and forth. And Pansy will come with us, of course.”
Potter turns and looks in Draco’s little mirror by the door, patting at his head as if that’s going to do any good.
“Oh, yes. I’m sure that’s the reason you missed it.” For the first time that evening, some bite creeps into Pansy’s voice.
this position. I didn’t want that kind of power. That’s what I told myself, anyway. But I think I really just didn’t want the responsibility.” Harry looks so earnest, but Draco still feels frozen inside.
The next night is the same. Ron doesn't even let himself go to sleep, this time. He knows he'll just need to wake again so there isn't any point trying to use his own bed.
"Yes. Unfortunately, our heritage can only produce one descendant at a time. The Malfoys marry other werewolves exclusively, to ensure their offspring have the werewolf gene. Whatever gene that may be. My parents expect me to continue this legacy."
"Hmm," Draco hummed. Harry wondered if his truth serum hadn't really worn off yet. "Yes. Because I was obnoxiously obsessed with bringing you up in every conversation."
Neither of them spoke for the rest of the time in which they finished their drinks. For a long while, Draco assumed that would be the end of it, and maybe the next day they’d pick the conversation back up and bicker some more. Now, he was quite glad Weasley wasn’t there. He’d probably disturb the silence by taking jabs at Draco that he couldn’t reciprocate.
“Shush!” Harry pressed his hand against Ron’s mouth, looking around them in a paranoid manner as if someone was going to jump out from behind them. Only when he was certain they were alone in the hallway of abandoned classrooms did he remove his hand. “Can you just listen to me?”
at each other. Surely Harry's co-workers were weirded out by their little display, but Draco truly didn't know how to progress. He didn't plan for this. He thought he would be the one to slam open Potter's office door. He wanted to make a statement and strut up to his desk. He wanted to lean over his paperwork, show that he was more important than
In all honesty, Dean Thomas wasn't quite sure why they were here either. Well, he knew what actions they took to earn detention. He just never thought Professor Flitwick would go so low as to assign them to
, he thinks. His body is already feeling warm at the prospect of getting out of this damned cold. He pulls his suitcase after him with numb fingers to meet the car halfway.
"Yes, you really were. All of my friends noticed, and they tried very hard to forget your existence on a daily basis because of me."
The Headmaster's office door opened just then and poked his head out. He was a wry little man with a twirling mustache and a beard that touched his toes. Stars forbid if Zygmunt ever decided to grow a beard that long. Strike him down the instant the thought enters his head.
A femslash microfic for today (although technically it has 147 words but whatever). I love these ladies so much and it's always nice to read fics that have them in a relationship, so I wanted to try my hand at writing their relationship a little bit :)
Dean leans over to Seamus' ear and says loudly enough, "He got dumped a few days back and getting drunk numbs the pain."
He was just a normal guy, really. Anything that made him special was missing now that Draco was looking at him again. "Who are you really, then?"
He was nervous about sharing a room with another student. If he were any stupider he would’ve told the Headmistress about his concerns, but he didn’t want her to think him ungrateful for being allowed back into Hogwarts. McGonagall didn’t
They meet where they first met their revision year: Hermione followed an odd-looking Pansy Parkinson after she escaped from a group of rowdy sixth years, until she opened up a broom closet and found herself helping her through a panic attack. That was their first meeting after the War. Hermione really saw the girl, who always seemed to have an air of unbridled confidence and sadism, as all of the survivors of the War were: hurt and confused about their futures and, in some cases, unforgivable.
For a moment, it's like Harry's the one in heat. And hell if that doesn't arouse him even more. Draco sympathizes with his poor biology, who must be so confused at this point.
“I’m fine,” he tried to placate their concerns. “It’s just… a lot, being back. Good, but also strange now that we’re not fighting for our lives.”
Potter's office was on the third floor. Room 18. The man who was not Hank Allen stopped and put his hands on his hips.
"Alright. Then... let's talk about my hair, I suppose. Do you believe that the Malfoy lineage is different?"
Sirius let himself grip James' shoulders, dipping his nails in. There was a bitterness to these times; he knew James wasn't actually into him, to him this was all just to let off steam and help Remus out. And Sirius was happy in his relationship with Remus. But... his schoolboy crush on James Potter couldn't be so easily squashed.
Besides, he had his very own ancestral home to live at, one he inherited from his late Godfather. It still held the ghosts of the Order of the Phoenix, whispers of the members who were no longer living. Harry cleaned up the place. Hermione and Ron visited as often as they could (Hermione brought him a succulent as a housewarming gift) even if all they did was remove the dirt and grime from unused rooms and rearrange the furniture. By the time he was packing up to go back to Hogwarts, the Black family home was almost looking like something of his own.
seeker. He’s just not as good as the Savior of the Wizarding World, which was an unfair standard in general for him to compare himself to. Pansy would be at his neck if she knew he was quivering outside like a Hufflepuff first year. Maybe, this time, he deserved all of her nagging and whinging.
"Harry Potter," he breathed more than spoke. His lower lip trembled. "So what was all this then? A funny little inside joke between you and your Auror buddies? Had to forget about it when you realized you might actually have to fuck a Death Eater? Or worse, be fucked by a Death Eater?"
That’s what everyone was asking him. What did he want to do after he got out of Hogwarts? What amazing charitable events and donations would he give? He hated to say it, but the Weasleys and Hermione were the worst offenders when it came to this kind of interrogation. Sometimes they made it hard to breathe.
The Slytherin looked different these days. His hair less structured, showcasing soft curls that actually solidified his loose relations to Luna. He never wore black anymore, wearing flamboyant patterns and bright colors that emphasized his presence even more than his attitude did. (The only time he wore black in Harry's recent memory was when his owl died, and even then it was rather short-lived.)
After his initial astonishment, he's quiet for the rest of the drive. So Draco fills the silence with his complaining as he tries to get the radio to work. The signal is too bad from the heavy snow for him to get any semblance of music.
Harry Potter. Who is also quite a handsome young man, mind you. Harry doesn't really live with him, but he visits often enough that he might as well move in. Draco always gets a look on his face when she brings it up though, so she's learned to judge from afar.
"About the squid?" Draco asked, cheeks aflame. He wasn't thinking. How could he think in a time like this one?
They go to the master bathroom for their first stop. Sirius put him down on the closed toilet seat and used a heating charm on the bathwater. It had been a while since he filled up the bath, since Draco's work held him back for an hour later than usual. That minor infraction was enough, however, for Sirius to use as a jumping off point for their scene.
It's all for nothing. Draco knows this. The cauldron is filled with smoke; tendrils of thick black peek out as if taunting him. He also knows what must come next. What the translated ancient text tells them must come next.
It takes a few embarrassing moments for Ron to realize he's asking to touch him. He nods eagerly, removing his hand and inching down his pajamas slightly. Harry bites his lip.
Albus lies back on the floor. It cools him down from his post-arousal state and he can't see the mirror from this position. He can stay here for just a little while longer. Just enough to clean up and steel himself for tomorrow. To prepare to look right at Gellert's face and lie through his teeth when the younger asks him what he was doing last night.
Potter should just leave. Despite trying not to pity himself too often (he was very lucky for his situation, and he understood that), it was difficult to believe he was worth coming back to Hogwarts.
Hermione pulls Pansy up by her robes, depleting the three inches of difference between their heights, and sighs softly when their lips finally meet. She's hoping to put as much longing as she felt into it. She's hoping Pansy understands.
Ron snorted. "I know, I just wasn't entirely ready for this to happen. Thought I had more time to prepare you. Just follow mine and Bill's lead."
Ron scooted back from the table and walked over to stand behind her, his arms wrapping about her and he splayed his hands across her very distended stomach. He rubbed her belly, grinning as he felt the motions of their child within and pressed a soft kiss to the back of her neck. "He'll make it," Ron reiterated.
He wasn't certain what to do. He'd never minded having two families. It seemed excessive even though he enjoyed everything the holidays entailed. Travel, fun, and gifts. He knew he was… indulged..., that he had many material things that many children didn't, and he also was adored by both sides. Scorpius knew that while he might act as if it didn't matter, he knew it did. Because despite all the good, there was a downside. He'd heard the stories from not only his mother but from his father as well. The tales listened to on the sly and hidden in dark corners after the grown-ups had thought he'd gone to bed.
"How am I to do that?" Lucius demanded. "I reconstructed his life once already. I made him a match and he destroyed both his reputation and the marriage."
It was almost scandalous the way the three of them appeared everywhere in society together. Sometimes the Weaslette was with them, but most often as of late that had changed and Draco noticed. The press had noticed as well.
"Nothing but buy a bloody mug, Granger-Weasley!" He snarled and then calmed when his mother patted his arm. Draco frowned. "I just Confounded him because he wouldn't sell the mug and left a fifty £ note on the counter. No Oblivation needed."
"And he still came back. Came here," Draco answered in awe. His heart swelled as he leaned a palm against the window. Harry raised one hand as well, his fingers splayed as he continued the shambling path forward
a wizard." Harry took a deep breath and raised his wand, carefully and deliberately making the motions and casting,
It surprised him that Potter had agreed to the walk despite the weather. Draco himself had always felt it was rude to just Apparate into someone's home or place of business and the shop was apparently both for Potter.
The only thing more unseemly was the reports of Potter's indiscretions with men. Not that the suspicions could be corroborated, properly, but still Draco wondered if it were true.
Kingsley called the session to order, and balls of light shot from the seated members of the Wizengamot wands, including Harry's, and struck the crystal chandelier, lighting the Hall.
Harry's hands delved into Malfoy's robes and wrapped his hand about the generous length hidden in the depths of his clothing.
"Thank you," Draco murmured and hissed as he burnt his fingers on the warm nuts. He laughed then as he popped the meat into his mouth. "I've not had these in ages."
"It's wrong, though, Harry." Andromeda was getting agitated now, and Harry could see the strain it was putting on her as she tried to reason out what she had just seen, and what she had been told.
Harry held up one hand. "Ultimately my creation with my mark upon it. Just wait one minute." He passed by them and moved through the curtain.
Draco straightened. "My aunt is ill, and doesn't need the attentions of an unruly child disturbing her peace."
Tom sighed and placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. "I heard about Andromeda. Damn shame it is if I do say so myself."
Draco stared at him. "Voldemort's curse affected you. But you could have arranged an heir like we did for the Malfoy line."
Draco could nearly feel the heat embedding the floor beneath his feet. The air circulated faster, forcing a shiver from his body. He hadn't even realized he was chilled even though the light was fading.
Potter stops, so Draco does too, and turns to see his face. He doesn’t look angry, or uncomfortable. He’s looking at Draco with that same expression that confused him at their last Sunday supper, but Draco thinks maybe he recognises it now. It’s as if Potter is looking right through Draco’s skin, into some part of him that he’s seeing for the first time, and he finds that part something special. Something magical, even.
“You’ve been fucking for more than two years,” finishes Blaise, suddenly serious. “You broke your engagement for him.”
“It’s more a toolbox, really,” Harry says, easy and light. He almost puts his hand out to touch Malfoy’s shoulder, but all the nights they spent touching in the past make that more complicated, more loaded with suggestion, than he knows how to safely navigate with this Draco Malfoy. This man the years have touched, just like they’ve touched him.
“How do you walk through the world?” he asked, his voice rough. A splintered thing. “How do you— go on? After you’ve done wrong? After everything is different?”
Harry spoke slowly, pulling the words up, meaning them only as he heard himself voice them. “It’s a small one. Sometimes I think the small tragedies are more dangerous, because they lead to the bigger ones. Malfoy. Draco. What conversation were you having with me?”
“Sometimes people only remember things later. When they’ve had some space to really think about it, in their own time.”
Granger smiles. “You’re welcome. I, uh— I owled Pansy and we went out to some Muggle charity shops together. Did she tell you?”
Draco opens his eyes. He can’t see the station from here, but it must be close. They might get on the train and travel back the way they came. Maybe the car would be crowded and Draco could press up against Harry as they held the bar above their heads.
When Granger and Weasley gather their coats and head toward the Floo, Granger sticks a hand out toward him. “Thank you for the discussion, Draco,” she says, and he’s so surprised he almost fumbles the handshake.
How their jagged edges align. How the fit is ever-turning, unlocking deeper and deeper into each other.
It’s a small group milling around outside on the Hall’s patios and gardens, but Draco can’t remember the last time he felt so surrounded by people he thinks of —firmly or still hopefully— as friends. He stands just apart from them all, drinking it in.
But Granger is already climbing. “I wouldn’t dream of burdening you with too much knowledge,” she calls back, and he sighs deeply before he starts climbing, too.
He drinks heavily. Sometimes Potter— Sayre— scowls at him from across the room, where Goyle of all people is talking his ear off. Draco doesn’t care, or maybe he can’t care. What does Potter know? How can he understand? This is how he stays rooted to the floor; how he doesn’t leap to his feet and run wildly, loudly from the room.
Draco does, and Potter closes the door quickly behind him. “Will you shut it?” he says loudly at a pair of heavy curtains hanging on the wall. The wailing is coming from behind them. “It’s one of your kind, anyway!”
Hermione leaned closer in the Floo. “It means they left their bodies where they were—in confinement—and just…went out,” she said excitedly. “In terms of what other people experience, there was a range reported from merely hearing the subjects’ voices to seeing them in their entirety.”
Potter is looking at him, his brows furrowed. He’d nearly forgotten how the full attention of Harry Potter felt. It’s encompassing and heady. It makes him aware of every breath he takes in and out of his body. “You think they planned the bombing, then. To make it look like someone was attacking them, and drum up sympathy.” It wasn’t a question.
“No.” Regulus pauses. Overhead, a hawk cries out. “But the countryside is full of hungry people leaving their plots of land, and when lords cannot pay their knights, men go wandering.”
The next day he goes straight up to the sixth floor to arrange for another Portkey to Ynys Llanddwyn, and so he’s already in the Department of Magical Transport when the first alarm goes off. The witch behind the Portkey desk immediately turns to the big map on the wall behind her, winking and sprawling in magical, living lines across the entire back wall. She touches her finger to the suddenly glowing spot somewhere in London, and the red dot seems to pulse forward, the area around it enlarging into a bubble that now shows street names, buildings, precise latitude and longitude. A loud, relentless ringing is filling up the room, and all the halls of the top levels of the Ministry.
Potter comes out of the bathroom slightly damp, his face a little pink from the steam, and dressed in a plain white t-shirt and flannel pajama bottoms. Draco had, thankfully, brought a pair of silk ones from home just in case: he usually wears nothing to bed.
Malfoy closed his eyes. Harry counted every breath he took. When Malfoy opened them again Harry swore he could see the very particular storm-grey of his real, tangible irises.
Petunia brings her hand up to her cheek. “She almost died laughing, when she gave it to me. ‘A proper British tea cosy,’ she said. ‘Just as proper as you are.’ I was spitting mad. I thought she was having a laugh at me, mocking me.”
Ron knelt down and his face filled up the frame of the Floo. “Hey, mate,” he said, grinning. “Alright?”
Harry had shrugged. “I don’t know,” he’d said, because it was partly true, and because he couldn’t explain the other true parts. Ron didn’t understand, although he tried to. Harry couldn’t tell him about Ginny’s face when she didn’t think anyone was looking, those last few years. How it looked so much older, somehow, while looking impossibly young and yearning for something he didn’t understand and couldn’t provide. How he felt it, too.
After his eyes adjust to the low lighting, he sees a long line of stalls, like a stable for horses only with much bigger spaces. The bottom three quarters of the doors are solid metal, and the last quarter have thick bars running all the way to the metal ceiling. He brushes his knuckles across the cool, slightly rough surface.
Potter squints at him in the dim, watery light. The lamps are struggling against the night’s gloom. “We might surprise ourselves,” he says, milder than Draco expected.
Before Harry could reply, Malfoy started up with the coughing again, finally getting up and going in the direction of the storeroom. Harry shook his head, leaned back, and tried to will himself to nap this awful day away.
Harry thought about being eleven years old and stepping into Diagon Alley for the first time. The cobblestone streets stuffed with crooked shops and the witches and wizards who had seemed so odd at first, so fantastical. His community, finally.
“What was that?” Potter is standing in the doorway. He’s loosened the top of his robes and he runs a hand through his hair now, messing up the perfect lines Draco had formed earlier. Draco prefers it. He prefers Potter a little disheveled. A little real.
Pansy attempts to laugh as she wipes her face. “It’s a whole new world,” she says. “If I’m pals with Harry Potter.”
Harry forced his hands to unclench and rolled his shoulders until they loosened. “Alright,” he said. “Alright, I see your point. But I also see and have a conversation with the ghost of Draco Malfoy every night.”
“Millie, please listen to me,” he continues, and she tenses up but stays quiet. “When he returns I want you to take him and go back to your hippogriff farm, and keep him there. From now on, keep him home with you. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
“I was just in the neighborhood,” he says. “And I wondered if you might like to take a small trip with me.”
Warrington shifts, and Cormac McLaggen comes to stand in front of him on the first stair. “What if you go too far?” he asks, looking up at Warrington. “What if we’re found out?”
Greg starts scratching something down on some parchment and then stops, the tip of the quill quivering slightly. “Ah,” he says, and looks up at Draco in something like apology.
Potter shrugs. “He was off today. Slipping.” Potter’s eyes are so green. Green like Slytherin silk ties and the curse he’d just sent sizzling through the afternoon air. Green like deep fields of grass and the color staining the edge of a sky right before a lightning storm. “Besides, I had a Hit Wizard with me, right?”
“You’ll keep our name—that’s the best part. Salazar will simply name you prince, and someday when you are king our family will hold the throne and these lands as well.”
“But here we both are,” says Dudley, as Potter sits down again, staring holes at Draco. “You go to school together?”
The younger Aurors weren’t there yet, perhaps because they’d all known Malfoy at school. Maybe there just hadn’t been enough time lapsed for perspective. Harry thought about perspective a lot these days. He thought about it when he held Rosie and when he watched Ron and Hermione growing suddenly into this new role of parents. And the truth was, from a certain perspective Malfoy's persistence in being here was its own hopeful bravery.
The room is empty again, and the sun is sinking down toward the sea. “Shit,” Draco says, his voice rough. “Dinner soon. We shouldn’t be missed at that. Too risky.”
When he finds the right room, all bright and light and surrounded by windows on three sides, Draco has his back to the door. Harry pauses, and looks at him. So careful, so easily harmed. He clears his throat, and Draco turns.
Potter lasted a month. A month where Draco had told himself he was not checking the Prophet’s gossip column to find the random pap snaps of Potter meeting his ex for lunch. A month of the occasional brushing touch that turned the air electric between them. A month where he pulled his own marriage contract out of his father’s desk drawer and read it more closely than he’d ever done.
“Yes,” says Draco. They are speaking so softly now, as if telling secrets. Something feels delicate, nascent about the moment. Harry makes the circuit with his fingers a few more times, watching the chess pieces tremble on Draco’s skin. He leans down and kisses Draco’s chest, right above the king.
“I truly am sorry,” he says more warmly. “I’ll try harder not to let work take over every part of my life. I hope you’re happy with… Warrington, right?”
Harry looks around at the spreading corridors of Malfoy Manor as they go. “Does your ex-wife still live here, too?”
“You could have asked your father’s portrait,” Snape pointed out. “I know he has one in the Manor. It would certainly have been easier for you to access then mine.”
Draco sits down and runs his hands over the deep blue velvet arms. Lucius waits, silent. Draco has seen him use this tactic on visitors all his life; it’s a subtle power play. He wonders, not for the first time, if his father uses it on him now because Draco is that much of a disappointment, or if he’s still pulling the shreds of his dignity around himself post-Dark Lord. He’s an elegant man, but Draco still remembers him straggly-haired and groveling. Panicked, toadying, completely without control.
“I don’t want to be Draco Malfoy, Weasley. Haven’t you ever wanted to be someone else, someone other than yourself?”
There was a woman playing gobstones on the other end of the terrace with her son. He’d met them yesterday in the library when she’d introduced herself as Madam Flint. Her son had been reading a book on dragons. “Can you believe he’s reading that?” she’d said to him with a grin. “And he’s only four!”
“I keep thinking about these Sunday suppers,” he tells Harry. “Keep imagining more people at them. My friends, your friends. Your aunt, my mother. Packs of Weasleys, even.”
Draco’s face is closed to him. “I’ve known you long enough to doubt that, Potter.” He sits down at the table and pours a cup of tea from the silver pot in the middle. “Did my mother send you through?”
“They were,” he says. “Those things you taught me— they were wrong. The world outside the Manor is not what you told me it was.”
Harry’s bedroom is bigger these days, and he has an actual bed instead of a mattress on the floor. That’s not the only way this feels new, though. Because Harry has no illusions about his feelings now, about the ways he wants Draco Malfoy, and what that means.
“Merlin, Malfoy.” Draco slides his lips up further, watching Potter all the while. He loves how every inch feels sliding through his lips and into his mouth; loves how every bit sends Potter further over the edge. “Just like that— oh— oh, don’t stop. You’re so good, so—“ Potter’s eyes close as Draco reaches up and grasps him with one hand as he pulls back with his mouth, sucking lightly as he goes.
He changes out of his work robes at home, and it feels so right to hang them back in the wardrobe. To know that, soon, he won’t be taking them out again. He’ll just be Harry, in his jeans and sweaters; just a dad and a friend and, maybe, a lover. His pulse jumps and races, just ahead of him, when he thinks about Draco.
She looks suspicious, and he supposes it must sound strange to her, but he doesn’t know how or even want to explain it to her. She reaches behind her and pulls open a drawer, pulling out a clear plastic bag with a zipper on the top. The cosy, all glaring colour and outrageous pattern, is inside.
watching him back, the way they’ve always done. Anyone can be pushed too far, Draco knows. Even Potter, with his crooked smiles and easy affection.
, he’d told Granger just yesterday afternoon. Tomorrow he would get answers. He remembers now, how that word can bend and shake, can tremble and break along fault-lines that had been invisible to the eye only moments before.
Draco pulls out a pinch of Floo Powder from the pot on the mantle and throws it in the fireplace. He steps in and says, “Malfoy Manor.” Potter’s face, and his bare feet stuck up on Draco’s coffee table, is the last thing he sees before he swirls out of sight.
"Just one more," Malfoy says a few moments later. "There." He pats the pink-stained cloth across Harry's face one last time. "Just the healing now."
Malfoy’s hair was slippery between his fingers, and he used it to pull his face even closer. He curled his tongue up, around the back of Malfoy’s teeth. He was always trying to feel out every cranny, every hidden spot on Malfoy’s body. Always trying to taste what made him tick, to kiss the things that made him ache. Sometimes, in these suspended, unreal nights, with Malfoy’s hands moving all over his own body, he felt a deep, slow kind of feeling rising up from his middle. Like Malfoy’s touch could reach somewhere he couldn’t even find, could lance the secret poison inside him and draw up a surprising sweetness.
“That doesn’t feel as inaccurate as it should.” He straightens his collar one more time in the little mirror by the front door. “They’re still not pleased with me finally moving out.”
He taps another one Draco hasn’t seen before; an older man in a suit, jacket draped over one arm, his face in profile as he looks out at the sea from the edge of a ferry. “What do you suppose he’s thinking?” Blaise asks. “Where he’s going?”
“Get over yourself, Draco,” he says. “You aren’t the only person who went through a war.” He lets go now, and Draco is already growing cold where his touch had been.
the artificial hush of that moment, the one that happened just between them, when the world faded away and all they could see was each other. A lump rises in his throat.
He crawls up over Potter’s body, and Potter’s skin, flushed and warm and damp, feels so good underneath him. Potter’s hunger— the way he pushes back into Draco, the clench of his fingers on the sheets beside their bodies— feels so good between them.
Blaise has all kinds. Old black and whites, and some older still, faded yellow and crumbling along the edges. Newer photos in colour, large photos and very small ones of schoolchildren looking at the camera with stiff smiles. Some are portraits and some are just random, everyday moments frozen into a single second of frame. It’s those ones—the ones with a person turned away, looking in the distance, or someone stuck in the air mid-jump, or a single chaotic moment at a birthday party— that still make Draco uncomfortable, although he can’t quite pinpoint why. Their stillness is strangely upsetting.
Potter’s face is all soft now, and Draco missed it so much. He’d missed Potter cracking open under his gaze, like Draco somehow had the power to see straight through to the Harry no one else got to see, not in his entirety.
He pulls back, lets his head fall against the cabinets behind him with a dull thump, and suddenly Potter’s palm is pressing against the zipper of his trousers. His cock is hard and Potter’s touch is hard and something short-circuits in his brain. It wasn’t a lie, precisely, when he told Pansy that relationships didn’t alarm him. More a half-truth. Bodies and touching don’t alarm him, but the other stuff, the non-physical; well, he’s seen enough during the war and after, seen that humans are messy creatures when they blur their borders with other humans. Illogical, unpredictable. But then Harry Potter has always defied logic, hasn’t he? No touching needed.
everything. Post-war, post-Voldemort. Post-childhood. Harry recognized that the curiosity was different now than it had been. Before, it had been red and smoking and sure of finding the bad. Now it was a gentler feeling; an openness to finding things that had nothing to do with confirming or disproving any suspicions. Like the echoes of an old obsession, with all the animosity drained out.
Draco shrugs. “He’s also Slytherin. Everything is strategy. Even marriage.” He thinks of Pansy now, and feels strangely sorry for her. “Which reminds me.” They stop at the end of the hallway, in front of the staircase. Voices are coming from the opposite direction, where the gardens are located. “Pansy’s taken a liking to you. She’s going to try and take you around to meet people with her. It’s a good opportunity. But—“
“That’s nothing new,” he muttered, looking in the cabinet for clean-looking glasses. A very warm, very male body suddenly pressed against him from behind.
Twinks is there to take their coats as soon as the arrive. He asks her which guests have already arrived and she rattles off the names of most of Pureblood society still free to roam at large.
Sometimes Draco goes up to the battlements, the highest point of the castle, and looks south to the forest curving like a secret smile in the distance. Beyond it lies Gryffindor. Draco wonders about the missing prince, the boy who was adopted by King Godric. What would it be like, to just disappear? To choose
Draco sneaks out very early, while Potter is still snoring on the sofa. He only feels slightly bad about it; Potter may be chafing against being cooped up, but Draco is suffering from a deep need to perform some inadvisable Obliviates.
Potter nods. “I can Side-Along her myself. Just give me a moment to send a quick message to Hermione.” Potter squeezes Pansy’s hand one last time, then stands and walks over out to the balcony. Draco can see a large silver stag erupt from his wand, and Potter talking to it. He gives Pansy a quick hug and hands her a handkerchief.
“I intend them to be. Right now, a lot of wizards are thinking that the Muggleborn agenda wants to take their remaining sliver of relevance left in the Ministry. They think their way of life, their traditions, their very selves are under attack. They’ll latch on to anyone who tells them they’re too important to go away quietly, and that’s you. We’ll use them to take that seat.”
No one will sell Draco their grain. He manages to buy some pigs from an old man who can no longer care for them, and orders them slaughtered immediately and parceled out by family. There is a bite in the air now—the world turns toward winter.
He groaned, and so did Harry, each echoing the other. “I’m going to come, Potter,” Malfoy gasped out. “I’m going to come all down your front. Right there.” He pulled out of Harry’s mouth roughly, and with a low sound and his hand stroking himself, did just that. Harry’s hand moved faster on his own cock, and then Malfoy slid to the floor in front of him. He reached out, replaced Harry’s hand with his own, and leaned forward, kissing him deeply, relentless.
“That’s Rookwood,” says a voice behind them. Granger’s got her hair pulled into an enormous bun on top of her head. She looks back and forth between them. “Augustus Rookwood.”
She rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched as she dropped down to kneel on the floor near Rose. “Well I’d rather Rosie not start running around talking about—“ She dropped her voice. “—knobs. I’m going to leave the explanations for all the naughty words she uses to you, Ron Weasley.”
He could love Draco Malfoy, probably, not in spite of his flaws and contradictions, but because of them. And that meant that he, too, could be loved for all the dark inside himself in turn. For so long now, Harry had doubted that. And as Malfoy grabbed his hip, rough, and jerked hard against him, as they both cried out and came, their two bodies cleaving together like they could burrow inside the other, Harry thought that the most amazing bit of pleasure Draco had given him was the simple, pure feeling that he belonged right where he was. As real and fucked up and redeemable as anybody else.
Malfoy didn’t look up, just continued tracing invisible lines across his skin. “I’m giving Astoria the Malfoy family ring this week,” he said. “The wedding is mostly formality and politics. The ring is the real binding.”
Draco takes a moment to imagine what Pansy will don when they finally marry. A silent scream of a gown, an intricate hair plait of resentment. She has the kind of tenacity he admires.
He went to lean further into Draco, but the shift and the lack of a usable arm put him a little off balance. He pulled away just a little to straighten himself, and Draco followed, leaning into him instead, his hands coming up to rest on either side of Harry’s face. He could feel Draco’s fingers curling into the hair behind his ears. He could feel Draco’s chest pushing into his own in time with the gulps of air he took between long, lingering passes of mouth and tongue.
, for once in your whole existence. Now remember, you’re not Harry Potter, even to the people you know.” Draco stops. “Actually, who
His mother is in her solar when he gets home, writing in her calendar at the small table in front of the windows. The elves bring dinner as he sits down.
“No, no, I know. It’s fine. I’d like to avoid that, if you please. Don’t tell her I’m here until Greengrass is gone, alright?”
“Oh,” Draco breathes, and then he hauls Harry up by the shoulder, presses him back against his chest. His mouth is by Harry’s ear as he wraps a hand around Harry’s cock, and every thrust moves them both.
Harry closed his eyes. He’d never actually held Draco’s hand, but he knew what it felt like. He remembered its warmth and the exact weight of it wrapped in his. When he opened his eyes, Draco was still there. He would be gone in the morning, Harry knew. Harry knew it like he knew what Draco tasted like, would taste like when he finally pressed his mouth to Harry’s.
“Yeah,” says Weasley. “Iwan’s alright. Really excited about having Welsh Reds here again. He came into a bit of money, after the war. Reparations. His family was all killed in a raid right before the Battle of Hogwarts.” Charlie glances at him, a tight, careful kind of smile, like he’s sorry he mentioned it.
“Oh,” says Potter. “Er… What’s a suitably pureblood kind of surname that isn’t going to make people think too hard about extended family members?”
“Besides,” she says, cutting a hand through the air between them, her eyes hard and sparkling. “It’s our generation’s story now, and we decide what it looks like. And I won’t let it look like it did before.”
Granger snorts. “Oh yes,” she says, stabbing at her own plate. “Very excited about looking politically acceptable right now. Even if they have to dirty their pure hands with Muggle stuff.”
"Neville found the grandmother's residence," Luna tells them a few days later. "She's deceased, but the house passed to an unspecified heir."
Harry stopped himself. There was no use going down that train of thought. Safer to forget it, tuck it away except for certain rare, bleary-eyed nights alone in his bedroom.
It’s not that he often does much on the weekend— he usually stays in, except for getting takeout. But there was something about being told to stay inside that made him immediately want to get out of the house, so to speak.
“You’ve been so brave,” he interrupts gently. “It was so brave, sending us that information. We wouldn’t have put the pieces together if you hadn’t.” Pansy looks up at him in astonishment, and Potter gives her a big, gentle smile, still holding on to her hand. It’s a kindness that goes right through Draco; freezes him up on the inside and then shatters him with a burst of heat, like trees thawing in the springtime, giving over their sweetness in gasps of surprise.
“I can’t explain it through logic alone. He’s great in a fight—intuitive and efficient. He notices things. He’s quick in just about every way you can think of. But most of all, I just trust him. He’s a good man, and he won’t be bought with coin or swayed by whispers. He’s loyal.”
“You must be very good at Apparition,” Draco says. “For a man to get from here to London and back again in time to tend the lighthouse is impressive.”
He follows the slight nod of Luna's head to a knot of people clustered at the far end of the bar, waiting to order their drinks. Just behind their group stands a tall man in a suit that hangs just a little too loose for his frame. His eyes dart around the bar and his hands are both shoved deep inside his pockets. His hair, slicked back off his forehead with pomade, is escaping its confinement in little curls around the man's ears and, though it's a lighter shade of brown than it used to be, Harry recognizes Antonin Dolohov.
Granger looks up and blinks. She looks surprised, and before she can say anything he says, “Mind if I take this?” and waves the paper at her.
“Powdered moonstone,” he says quietly. Almost a whisper. “Hellebore. Shrivelfig. Lacewing. Lavender and valerian. Foxg—“
“My father has always hoped I’d be chosen as Salazar’s heir,” he finds himself saying. “It’s been clear for many years that the king has no intention of remarrying and making his own. So—my father trained me in court etiquette when I was young, and he told me not to mix with the other children.”
Potter turns, and pulls his wand,  adding the cosmetic charms he’s been using to his face. “Our informant.”
The door to Pansy’s apartment clicks open as soon as he says his name into the little intercom above the doorbell.
“Yeah,” says Goyle, and Draco closes his eyes, even though it’s pitch black inside the cabinet. He leans his ear carefully against the door. “Pansy’s taking her out to look at your pregnant hippogriff. She’ll be ages. She loves those beasts.”
“Well, no, I— I don’t think I mentioned it.” He feels suddenly like a lightbulb has been turned on for him. “Are you saying that— that Draco thinks I resigned because of the story?”
“Vodka?” he asked, as he slid onto the stool beside him. Malfoy glanced over quickly, then back again, a perfect double take.
“It also wasn’t really your fault that I was in your dungeons.” Dean’s voice is light— he has an ease about him that Draco envies. “You didn’t kidnap me, and you couldn’t control the situation.”
“Go on then,” Granger says, finally moving out of the way. “That will be entertaining for everyone involved.”
From the east window of the tower Draco can look down upon the yard, the grounds in front of the gatehouse where the men train with their arms each morning. The day brightens in slow degrees. Below, blades ring against each other and the men strain to wield them. Down below is sweat and muck. Up in the tower it is quiet, the air still charged with night’s cool, lingering breath. Draco is always watching, it seems—always slightly apart. Marcus calls out and the men separate. They take turns drinking from the bucket of water just brought up from the well.
She blinks, and reaches between them to pour more tea into their cups. “She found it at a charity shop near the factory that makes them. It wasn’t supposed to be sold. It was a prototype that went wrong, and it was supposed to be binned, but somehow it wound up there.”
“Did it help?” Potter asks. “Two years ago— speaking with Snape’s portrait? Did you get what you needed?”
“Wait until I shower,” Potter says. He comes to look out the window, down at the people gathering for a picnic on the beach below. Draco tries to do a headcount, but he can’t see very well from this angle. When Potter turns to say something, his face is suddenly right there, filling up his view. Draco watches his pupils blow wide, but the color is all wrong. Not that particular green that he sees sometimes in his dreams, staring down at him in fire or in bloodied water. Potter swallows, his throat moving slowly, and Draco realizes how close they are. He pulls back, and watches Potter tear his gaze away from Draco’s mouth.
Harry Potter, if he isn’t saving the wizarding world? Who would you even be, if you weren’t the Boy Who Lived?”
Potter shifts again, and Draco’s attention shifts, too, to where their bodies are touching, and where Potter is trying to hide his growing hardness between them. Draco fans his fingers out against the wall, so carefully. His breath is stuck in his throat, and he makes himself exhale. There’s a litany of reasons scrolling through his head about why this is a terrible idea— all the ways this could end in disaster.
It was hard to say, but Draco Malfoy is standing on his front stoop, pale and pointed and buttoned up in black trousers and a grey waistcoat. He blinks into the darkness of Harry’s front hall, squinting just a bit in the bright sunshine, and Harry can feel the past so sharply it’s like a kick in the ribs.
Inside, they go to the study. Draco closes the door with a glance at Regulus standing watch beside one of the Gryffindor men. Harry stands in the middle of the room. Draco skirts him and heads for the window. It’s small and doesn’t really look over much—just the corner of the chapel and some mud—but he examines the view all the same.
A tear finally slips down her cheek, and she bends her head down toward the table. “You’re sure it’s Tom?”
The house he’d lived in with Ginny, where they’d had babies and the babies had grown and left home from, is quiet and sunny in the early morning. Ginny’s got her pajamas on still, and she puts a pot of coffee on the table, along with some toast and jam. He’s too nervous to eat anything.
When Alyce has left, that thick dark hair of hers swinging in snarls and the splash of freckles standing out boldly across her face, Carys holds the bottom half of the door open for him to enter. The kettle is whistling on the big, iron wood stove, and she pulls down two mugs and fills them up, sifting in the herbs from a big crock on the counter.
The ghost is back. He can’t tell what form it’s taken yet— it’s still just a vague human shape, this continual presence that keeps creeping up in his garden and in the back of his mind, driving him crazy. He feels bile rising in the back of his throat, and he goes to reach for the bottle of Ogden’s only to pull out an empty bottle.
Draco flips the Prophet closed again, and folds it up. “I’ll go back tomorrow and interview Tom Evers. Maybe more of the sanctuary workers. Who knows? Might turn something up.”
"Stimulating," Malfoy answers for him. Harry blinks, and then Luna shifts around until her face is grinning down at him.
Harry had looked at Neville's open, bashful, brave face and readied what he wanted to say. Things like
Malfoy turns sharply from the window he'd been been glaring through. "Doesn't it ever get to you, Potter? Aren't you tired of waiting and watching and then waiting some more while that absolute piece of shit is still out there, just walking around, just
The bees dance around him, and he wants to let go, as they do. To ride the sweet current, to be directed, to be taken and given in the same breath.
Harry isn’t back by nightfall; he isn’t back in the morning, or at dinner, or by the following night. A week slips by, and then another.
“Why on earth do you suppose I’m interested in you doing any thinking? That is not your purpose. I assure you, I’ve got it well in hand.”
Harry was, admittedly, feeling rather sorry for himself, imagining what his friends and the people he’d assumed would one day be his official family were doing while he sat at the Ministry, alone. And then a fit of coughing broke into his thoughts.
A stick, a piece of wood with a bit of feather inside, and the tingling, electric feel of something wild and inexplicable flowing through and out of you.
Petunia looks at him sharply. “I can’t take money from you without something in exchange. Did Harry put you up to this? Did he give you that money to pass to me?”
Potter had raised his eyebrows and laughed, the little chortle he did when he was really delighted by something, but put down his styrofoam container and turned over on the sofa. Draco stood over him, and their fingers brushed against each other as he took the small jar Potter handed back to him. It smelled like lavender and cloves and chamomile tea. It felt different, too, touching Potter like this; apart from sex and with no immediate intention to have it. With each pass of his fingertip over the red, angry lines in Potter’s skin something grew inside him— some mounting discomfort, a pressure rising up from his chest toward his mouth.
“I think I’m going to go argue with Blaise some more now,” she says. “There’s Harry. Try to keep the snogging to a minimum, will you?”
Malfoy is more circumspect. He doesn't tell Harry and Luna what he does when they are apart, and they don't push him. There are his parents, Ministry-bound to their Manor, but Malfoy doesn't seem to have anyone beyond them.
After, time catches up. The people around him react, sound goes back to normal. He’s left with the corpse he made and the blinding, obvious realization of something he’d half-known all along. The Muggle cops come first, before he can contain the scene himself, and then the Italian Aurors take over, and all the while Draco is thinking about that key and how it had felt pressed into his palm.
If Malfoy notices Harry's distraction, he gives no indication, and the secret smile is once again curled on the edge of his mouth.
