The game ended eventually, with everyone begging off one by one because they were starting to get tired.
And just as Ron had pointed out, there were indeed multiple girls- and even boys- from Slytherin and Ravenclaw chattering around him. He entertained them gladly with a charming smile while his current companions unbothered by the amount of attention he was getting.
When he got back to the living room, Draco was back under the blankets, though not completely wrapped around him like they were a while ago, fiddling with his hands.
Harry was being so patient with him, it made his heart clench. He felt so lucky to have him, making the initial embarrassment of having no experience disappear from his mind.
Harry knew what that felt like and immediately drew out his wand, casting a silencing charm around the four of them.
“Goodnight, Harry.”
“Yeah, we’re coming,” Harry sighed, trying not to look disappointed. Hermione nodded perkily with a smile before disappearing back into the classroom.
“They are supposed to be joining us between the last week of January or the first week of February, and will be leaving 2 weeks before their OWLs and NEWTs take place,” she informed them. “Now, the reason I’m telling you this so early on is because they will be needing a student to partner with them and guide them around in the months they will be staying here. They won’t be assigned until before the Christmas Holidays, but this is your chance to inform your parents and talk about it, as well as possibly learn their language to talk to them better.”
Yeah, he had a good feeling about tomorrow.
And it’s not like Draco didn’t want to have sex with Harry, he just wasn’t sure how. He knew that if he didn’t prepare himself, it would probably turn out awkward, and Harry would probably realize that it isn’t worth staying with Draco because they aren’t compatible.
“Right,” he cleared his throat. “Can we talk? Outside?”
“What do you mean ‘what’?” Ron hissed. “What were you doing, approaching the ferret?”
“Yeah,” Malfoy sighed, relaxing himself once more. “I mean, thanks. I’m alright thanks to you, I suppose.”
Once that was all finished and everyone was presentable, they began piling out of the room. “Are you ready, mate?” Ron asked him.
“I propose Game Night!”
“Oh really,” Pansy chimed in along with Blaise. She gave Draco a shit-eating grin before saying “Well we’ve always figured since 4th year. You know, “Potter” this and “Potter” that.”
“Still cold?” Harry asked, knowing that he was about to push into risky territory. He sat himself down next to Draco and pulled the blankets over both of them, pressing his side into the other man’s, who had tensed slightly. Harry then grabbed his hands again and rubbed on them a bit, hoping to create more heat.
Harry chanted mentally. No more Muggle contraptions. He’s done everything in his power to stop Draco from buying a bus, and he thought it worked. He sends him out alone one time and can only pray he did not come home with a bloody-
“Be quiet,” Malfoy rolled his eyes, but his friends reactions did nothing to extinguish the excitement from his face. “It’s almost done.”
“Draco,” he warned, even though he knew that the other man couldn't hear him. “This is your last chance.”
And life continued as it normally did. Draco didn’t comment when Harry left food out for him every morning and evening. He didn’t react when he and Harry began spending their free time together when Draco didn’t have class or it was too early to work and Harry had a free day.
They can revisit those ideas in the morning, Draco resolved.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stop that,” he commanded, sitting by his head once again. “I’ve already lost an hour, so we have to get to work soon.”
“If you don’t think Hermione isn’t planning to hold group study sessions for our year, you’ll be bloody disoriented real soon,” Ron snorted wryly, but there was still a tone of affection in his voice.
“Ready?” Draco asked him, bringing his face close to Harry’s ear.
Harry shook his head, stepping back. Draco made a quick move to stand up, but Harry held his hand up. “I can’t do this anymore, Draco.”
“Draco, please,” Harry groaned. “Just take it off.”
They were not able to meet up after class.
He heard some snickering coming from the area of Dean and Seamus along with Ginny asking them what was going on. Draco rigidly sat himself down next to Harry and began gratefully taking food from the plate Hermione handed him.
“That’s all on you,” Ron shrugged, grinning at his girlfriend's enthusiasm. He leaned in to place a kiss on her cheek, causing Harry to move his gaze away from his two best friends, and notice that Draco was walking out of the Great Hall already.
“Why didn’t you bloody say so?” he asked, panic evident in his voice - even if Harry did, in fact, say so. He bolted from his seat to finish getting himself ready, ranting and scolding Harry without a pause while he struggled to put his shoes on.
“Right,” Harry nodded, mentally noting those directions before bending down to hold up the stunned man. They both gave each other a nod and Harry, suddenly feeling more awake now, apparated to the entrance of the Ministry in what Hermione would most likely call a reckless decision.
He should probably say no, he thought. Ron would kill him, but the bright excitement shining in Draco’s eyes got the better of him and well, he could never say no to Draco. Not anymore, at least.
“Then if you want to keep doing this, fine,” Harry shrugged. “It’s your life and I’m not going to judge you for it. I'd only find you another job if you wanted to quit. I just want to make sure that you get home safely, alright?”
“What? Are you interested in dating the ponce? Is that it?” Ron asked. Harry felt like he should seriously talk to him about that. It reminded him a bit of when he had to break the locket in the forest, and what he saw. Yeah, he needed to get it through his head that Hermione’s dating him because she genuinely returns his feelings, and there’s no need to feel that way.
This made Malfoy pause. He looked as though he was processing Harry's every word carefully before he opened his mouth to respond. "I'm taking care of myself," he said slowly.
When they woke up though, that was something else. Malfoy had taken the liberty of going through Harry’s closet, demanding something “not atrocious” to wear.
“We still don’t know for sure that it’s him he was talking about,” Hermione said unhelpfully, before sighing at his pointed look. “And there’s nothing wrong with being just friends with Draco and seeing where it goes from there. You don’t need to ask him out instantly, and Draco can make his decision when he feels like it. If Neville suddenly asks him out, then you’ll know your answer at least. You’ll only be a bad friend if you purposely try to sabotage Neville, if that’s who he’s planning on asking out.”
“Oi! Harry and Draco,” They slurred a bit. “Game turned out well, didn’t it?”
“Git,” Ron punched him lightly, laughing as he did so.
And the school year continued on like that, neither of them giving up. They’ve even escalated to working together in class and spending most of their free time together, much to the delight of Hermione as she finally had someone that understood everything that was coming out of her mouth.
“Just like this car,” Harry was at an utter loss on what to do or say next.
And after that, it was silent. Everyone else found a way to escape the screaming match, leaving the common room abandoned, leaving only Harry and Hermione.
“Nothing you need to worry about,” Harry chuckled, the vibration felt through his chest.
Despite the fact that he bought a cup of Draco’s favorite coffee as a peace offering, he still felt like he’d get hexed on site. With a deep breath, he stepped in the Ministry Floo and called out the address, already regretting that he agreed as the green flames engulfed him, transporting him to a familiar sitting room.
“I mean… I kind of feel like we were the ones who pushed her there,” Harry said, feeling a bit guilty. Ron didn’t share the sentiment.
“What, were you expecting that we have larger beds and a sitting room?” Draco snorted once Harry voiced his thoughts. “No, the founders of the school wanted to make sure that this was equal for most all students. The only difference is whether or not you want to customize it a bit, like my bed sheets.”
“What?” Malfoy asked, eyes widening a bit.
“Ow! You tosser,” Harry yelped as Draco pulled his hand back smugly. “I didn’t bloody grab your hair and pull at it!”
“Good,” Draco said simply, laughing as he watched someone dance around in the Truth or Dare group. Harry didn’t even bother looking over, he was too entranced by the way Draco looked when he laughed freely like that.
Ron gave him a light chuckle. “I guess you’re right. Why join some cultural exchange if you aren’t going to be open minded?”
“No,” Draco smiled, turning to face Harry as well. “Thank you. For being patient with me.”
Without another word, a pillow was thrown directly towards his head.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, getting up. “This would probably be better if we did it in the bathroom. They’d kill me if I got our floor wet because I’m pretty shite at cleaning charms.”
is,” Pansy drawled teasingly after giving him a small snort of laughter. “Didn’t you think about how big Potter’s rock hard co-”
Draco kept his eyes closed, but Harry felt him shake his head in his hands, which meant he was awake.
“But you like Grimmauld Place. Albeit you did plan on renovating,” Draco wondered out loud. Harry’s heart did a small flip, like it did every time Draco did or said something sweet, and nothing did it like the way he just knew Harry,
“You really are gorgeous,” Harry said in a soft whisper, not giving Draco any time to respond adequately as he leaned back down to press his lips firmly against Draco’s, this time dominating the kiss as he slid his tongue into Draco’s pliant mouth.
“Fine,” Malfoy shrugged. “It doesn’t normally happen unless I try to leave, but most don’t like to leave evidence for the police.”
That was also true, Harry conceded. They were just asked to come in to give a brief of their findings - which actually literally anyone can do as long as they’ve read the file - and then stay for the rest of the day since they were already there.
“Cute,” Harry laughed, placing a quick kiss on his soon-too-be husbands cheek. “But seriously, don’t stress too much. Everything looks great,” He insisted, hoping to mollify the anxious man in his arms.
“I trust you,” he said with a small shrug. “Can you just, maybe... help me understand this as we go?”
Draco searched his face, concern still marring his features. Harry gave him a reassuring smile before he eventually gave in,nodded, and briefly kissed Harry before pulling away.
And with that, he Disapparated into the night as Neville had done a few moments ago, leaving Harry alone by the greenhouse smiling like a madman.
“Shove it, Malfoy,” Neville laughed, wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulders and pulling him closer, making Harry’s stomach turn. Thankfully, he dropped the arm immediately after. “Sorry  about that, I was just convincing him that there was no need for a disco ball.”
"Potter, I already told you that I can handle myself just fine," Malfoy said. "I don't understand why you care so much."
“-is that also for me?” Draco asked, both awkward and hopeful at the idea of food.
“You’ve literally been sleeping in all week, and it’s Friday now,” Harry pointed out, raising an eyebrow.
“Oh,” was all he said.
“I still don’t get it,” Zabini said. Harry didn’t either, but he was determined to find out. He also mentally decided that this agreeing with Zabini thing had to stop.
“I’d rather you not marry a Neo Death Eater,” Ron rolled his eyes, some bitterness returning. “But no. Whatever happened between you and Ginny is your business, and she isn’t crying and heartbroken or something.”
Even though he still wasn’t awake yet, Harry paused. Draco was, for the lack of an appropriate term, beautiful when he slept.
“Shut up, you’re probably as bad as him,” Ron snapped before making his way back up to the castle as well, leaving Harry to stand awkwardly with the two Slytherins.
Ron gave her a smile, the type of smile where you could just tell he was in love with her, his emotions laid bare. Suddenly, Harry felt like he was invading on something private between the two of them and shifted his gaze elsewhere until it finally landed on Draco, who seemed to be thinking the same thing.
“Hey, mate,” Seamus called, barging into Ron and Harry’s office in the Auror Department. “You’re still coming out with us for drinks, aren’t ya?”
“Ouch, you brute,” Draco grumbled, glowering at the floor. He didn’t even notice Harry step away and try to deal with his internal crisis as he continued glaring at the floor, his lithe frame swaying a bit as if he could topple over at any second.
He shook his had and bit his bottom lip as he clambered from the chair and ran clumsily over to Draco, folding his arms protectively over his legs.
Well, now
‘You do realise that you’re a wizard.’ Draco chimed in, figuring that he could no longer bare to watch this hideous display of idiocy.
‘Where awe we, Papa?’ Scorpius sucked his thumb right back into his mouth, ‘dis I’n’t your lab.’
Slowly, he shook his head, ‘I’m not doing that.’
Frantically, Draco almost sprinted towards Potter and found his nemesis small and meek, breathing slowly but shallowly. He wasn’t in the best shape. His eyes were rolling into the backs of his head, his body was tired, his face bruised. ‘Potter?’ he choked out albeit hesitantly.
‘I’M DE KING OF DE WORWLD!’ He yelled and a few Muggles turned to coo at the besotted child. Draco couldn’t blame them, he had to admit, the child was somewhat cute. In an after he’s full of sweets kind of way.
would you do that?’
‘You’re no fun.’ Potter whined as he started to wiggle out of his grip, Draco just held on tighter, ‘lemme go. I haft to go’ he slurred out.
long have you been hiding this? If you father had ever found out that you’ve been putting it up since the age of…’
Draco was shocked at the action as the boy whispered, ‘Daddy tells me tha you ook bwautiful when you cwy, but I don’t wike it when you’re sad.’
‘NO.’
‘Good luck with that,’ Blaise said distastefully shooting Scorpius a less than impressed look.
Pansy sighed in defeat, ‘you really love him, don’t you?’
‘Shut up, Malfoy’ Potter fired back, rubbing his head furiously deflecting the jinx sent his way.
His heart sunk. And that is why any form of relationship wouldn’t work between the two of them. It was very simple really; Potter just didn’t get him. Draco was mean, he was snarky and sarcastic, and Potter didn’t understand that. Draco didn’t even think that he liked that.
‘Just so we’re all on the same page,’ Blaise chimed in, ‘we’re talking about Draco’s
‘When a crazed Death Eater gallivanting as Mad-Eye Moody turned
They both sounded like a broken record, or maybe a song that had already been sung. Three days ago, and Draco’s biggest concern had been Potter. Now, it was still Potter – but sweets, tantrums and drool had just so happened to have fallen into that mix. Tantrums were definitely his biggest challenge, in all his days, he’d never come across a more spoilt child. Merlin knows where he’d gotten that from, but if he had to wager galleons, his bet would be on Potter.
‘DADDY DOESN’T WUV ME? BUT I WUV DADDY. I WAN MY DADDY!’ He screamed, and it was the second he looked into watery eyes that he had known he’d lost.
‘I am

maybe if given the chance, Draco would treat Potter like he was the only person in the room. He’d go to all his stupid quidditch matches, all big smiles and encouraging banners. He’d hold him close whenever he had a nightmare, mumbling gently that he was here and he’d wasn’t going anywhere. He’d try and fail to bake Potter his favourite dessert, but Potter wouldn’t mind no, he’d love Draco even more for trying.
Even after Potter had rejected his hand in their first year, Draco had found a way to

‘That piece of chicken between your teeth says otherwise.’
‘That makes sense.’ Potter mumbled tiredly as Draco made it to the dorm, placing Potter carefully on his bed. He got to work, removing Potter’s shoes and glasses, before pulling the covers safely over him.
‘That, without a doubt, is your son,’ Madam Pomfrey told the both of them as she gestured towards a sleeping Scorpius.
She beamed, ‘then that’s final, you’re coming.’ She informed him happily, and he sighed, there was no point in fighting a losing battle.
‘Sorry about that champ,’ Blaise ran his fingers through Scorpius’ hair, ‘why don’t you tell me all about your Daddy?’
Severus carried on, ‘what in Merlin’s name are we going to do with it?’ he spat out with distaste.
‘Because I couldn’t bloody well have told him I loved him,’ he snapped frustrated. ‘Excuse me Potter, I know I’ve been a complete git to you for years, but that was only because I loved you and your rejection broke me’
‘WHAT THE
‘Shut up.’

‘Is that a child?’ Millicent squeaked and Draco remembered that half the Slytherin’s hadn’t even been present last night.

Well, he’d had a good run, but it was hide time that he crawled into a whole and died. There would be no coming back from this, according to the toddler he was married, and had an active sex like with Harry bloody Potter. Father was most definitely rolling in his grave.
tells me papa!’ he exclaimed happily before extending his arms up towards Draco. When Draco shot him a baffled look, he sighed before saying, ‘up, up.’
Presently, Draco was sitting on the ledge of a raised window in the newly acquainted eighth year common room. He watched the wind dance in the nights sky softly as he waited. He was alone. He was

As for him, Draco was content to keep quiet, but as always, Scorpius had other plans. ‘Now you says sowwy to uncle won,’ he told him pointedly.
. ‘Think.’
‘Fuck off, Potter’
‘Malfoy’s don’t dance,’ he replied instead.
‘I’ll tell you one thing Malfoy, once a Death Eater,
Scorpius gave him a confused look, ‘but you alwedy know bout Daddy, yu saw him yeswerday,’ he turned towards Draco and his face broke into a stellar grin, ‘tis the best Daddy in de whole ‘ide world!’ he announced joyfully.
When Draco didn’t answer Blaise grinned in triumph, ‘I always
He then persisted to give Draco a very serious look, ‘don’t be sad Papa, I wuv you the mostest.’
‘Malfoy?’ a hesitant voice asked, and Draco ignored them in favour of melancholically gazing out of the window.
Relief flushed through his system as Scorpius hands released from its death grip which instead fell lower until it threaded through his own. Draco flushed from the intimate contact, thankful that Scorpius was at least eating his breakfast.
‘Are you telling me that you actually
Potter. He should’ve done that.
‘BOYS!’ Madam Pomfrey cried out, she moved across the room so that she was standing in front of them, before giving them both disapproving looks, ‘you’re adults now. You now apparently have a
‘I don’t wan you to go, I wuv you Papa,’ he cried out and Draco could hear the fresh tears in his tone. Even for someone as cold as he, the sight was a tough pill to swallow. No one wanted to be the reason that a child was reduced to nothing but tears.
to fucking serve him. Against his wish, that is exactly what he did, slowly cutting up bits of eggs and sausages for him to eat.
a sociopath Malfoy?’ he asked almost murderously and Draco was a tad bit scared.
Dumbledore and McGonagall both nodded in agreement as Draco let out an indignant squeak. ‘B-but I can hardly look after a child. I have my NEWTs!’ He stammered.
You see, Potter had people who admired him, who worshiped him, who wanted to
The laughter carried on as Scorpius tangled his hand through Draco’s, turning to face him with wide eyes, ‘Papa?’ he asked hesitantly, and Draco nodded encouragingly, ‘will you be dere to wayke me up tomowwow?’
That night Draco tried his best to not think about Potter. But if his dreams were full of curly black hair, and emerald green eyes, then that was nobody’s business but his own.

Once a brainless Gryffindor, always a brainless Gryffindor, his father would say and Draco was inclined to believe him.
Draco huffed out in annoyance, ‘it
Much like Draco and Hogwarts. He’d once been an overeager eleven-year-old, his dreams in the palms of his hands, optimism shining in his bright eyes, his heart full of hope. But soon, the light from his eyes had gone dark. He too, like the leaf, lay fallen on the ground, detached from a place he’d once considered his
No, it wasn’t hate, for the only emotion it could be was love. He wanted to hold hands with him as they walked the crowded halls. He wanted to utter a joke that made him laugh. He wanted to be the reason that Potter smiled. He wanted to be the last thing he thought about each night, and the first name on his lips every morning. He wanted to cuddle, kiss, and touch Potter. He wanted it

,’ he whispered whilst looking into wide eyes intently.
‘So does cereal.’ He answered Potter begrudgingly, who nodded at him manically.
Scorpius looked up at him with wide, hopeful eyes, ‘you said somefing abowt sweets?’ he questioned intently and Draco sighed. Fuck being a Gryffindor, this kid was a Slytherin through and through.
‘When I became an aunt,’ she told him, and he couldn’t help but feel warm at her answer.
They ended up back in the common room, huddled up in a corner by the fireplace, their legs entwined, as they lent on one another for support. Music was still playing and the eighth years were still dancing. If anything, they were drunker than he’d ever seen them.
Dumbledore clapped his hands gleefully. ‘It’s settled then, Draco, you will watch over Scorpius during his stay here at Hogwarts. He will sleep in the Slytherin dormitories with you as well, and if for whatever reason you can’t care for him, then you shall find a suitable regent for that period of time.’
it was – there was his answer. He didn’t spend his days mooning over Potter because he fancied him, nor because he was in love with him. No, he mooned over Potter because he was

Draco narrowed his eyes. ‘What do you

He smiled slightly, ‘yes, I guess I did,’ he replied softly before making his way back to his dorm.
In reply the child shook his head, and before Draco knew it, his face was wet, dripping onto his robes, as drool soaked his skin. He felt his cheeks heat up, as he brought a handkerchief to his face.
Scorpius shook his head, sinking deeper into his lap. He clicked his teeth, ‘bad Daddy,’ he growled as a chubby hand came out to play with Draco’s robes. ‘Papa’s name is Powwer-Malfowy, sayme as you.’ He told them and for about the fifth time, Draco felt his blood turn cold.
And that is how Draco found himself locked in the Headmaster’s office on Saturday morning with an angry Harry Potter to his right and a distressed Scorpius by his feet.

‘Why would you give this to me?’ Draco asked sceptically.
‘Now,

‘I don’t run, Potter. I walk briskly.’
‘DRACONIUS LUCIUS MALFOY!’ Severus roared, and Draco jumped because never had he ever seen Snape so volatile. McGonagall just stood there, looking at him with resigned eyes. ‘I LEAVE YOU FOR FIVE SECONDS AND I COME BACK TO FIND THAT YOU’RE A FATHER, YOU IGNORANT STUPID FOOL. HOW LONG DID YOU THINK YOU COULD HIDE THIS FROM ME?’ Draco froze, normally Snape just hissed and spat, but he never yelled unless he was close to loosing it, and when he did, you ran. The above indicates that Snape had most definitely lost it, and the child beside him kept him firmly fixed in his seat. He was screwed.
‘No, Dumbledore created a private dorm for us both to share. According to him it’s opposite the boys dorms.’

Potter rounded at him, glaring with a fierceness he’d never seen before, ‘are you being serious? All evidence suggests that he is your

Perhaps dreaming about chicken wasn’t the

Speaking about Severus, Draco turned to face the sneering professor. His eyes flashed to Draco’s at once as he said, ‘don’t think you’re getting off so easy,’ he hissed. ‘You didn’t hide it up your sleeve.’ Draco shook his head. ‘Idiot! How many times must I tell you—
Dumbledore shook his head, ‘nothing is impossible when we are affronted with the laws of magic. Of course, we’ll have to check with Madam Pomfrey, but I am quite certain that this is Mr Malfoy’s child,’ he said with assertion.
‘Again?’ a knowing voice asked. Startled, Draco turned around before giving them a small nod of acknowledgement as he made his way back to the common room.
‘How so?’ Draco asked immediately, his face starting to flush.
Before he could gather his bearings, Smith chucked what was left of his drink all over him, ‘You think you’re too good for me, huh?’ he spat angrily.
They were now standing in the entryway of the common room, and Draco was lost for words.
come with me to the Great hall for breakfast,’ he demanded the boy.
He was just about to scream abduction when his gaze landed on Scorpius standing by the doors of the Great Hall. Instead of flooding with relief, Draco’s  stomach filled with dread as Scorpius uttered a single word.
Draco sighed before turning to face beautiful green eyes, ‘It’s not so much that I hate than I find you profusely irritable.’ He told him honestly.
appreciated,’ he told him firmly, and the hands all but disappeared.
The ring had been passed down through generations of Malfoys, he looked down to where the ring that sat on his fourth finger. It only being there because he was…
The sudden outburst came from Scorpius, who jumped up onto his chair. He looked frightened, ‘I don’t know im! I don’ want Hagwid!’ Tears formed in the crests of his eyes and gently started to fall.
‘HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? THIS OBSSESSION WITH MALFOY IS BORDERLINE STALKER-LIKE. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND IT MOST DEFINITELY IS NOT WORTH MINE. MAYBE IF YOU SPENT JUST A FRACTION OF THE TIME YOU SPEND LOOKING AT MALFOY ON YOUR STUDIES THEN PERHAPS YOU’D BE ACHIEVING HIGHER THAN AN A IN POTIONS.’ She glared at dumbledore after doing a brief sweep of the room. ‘Mr Malfoy,’ she snapped. ‘Something told me I’d be seeing you again.’
A double update...
Malfoy,’ he said with his whole chest and Draco glared. ‘If any more nosey bastards like yourself come poking in here, who do you think they’ll blame for the chicken crime if they pick up on my magical signature?’
‘Sod off.’ Potter spat, sliding off the ledge landing with a loud
He crouched down so that he was eye level with the small boy, ‘Scorpius, please show Pansy and Blaise your hand,’ he asked him politely.
Draco ignored her in favour of cutting up a small piece of chicken and popping it carefully in his mouth. Merlin, it was good!

thinking about Potter.’
This wasn’t her fault. None of this was anyone’s fault but his own.
Draco tutted, ‘you forgot about those who only eat plain cereal,’ he countered.
what I’ve had to deal with whilst you’ve been gone?’
‘Well, for starters, I didn’t just used to be smart. I
‘I don’t wanna go,’ he crossed his tiny arms in challenge.
His studies would never make him sad. His studies would listen, and only listen. His studies wouldn’t fight with or laugh at him. His studies wouldn’t fuck anything and everything that moved. His studies wouldn’t break his heart…
Merlin help him! The boy was digging him an early grave. He could see it now, Draco Lucius Malfoy cause of death: a stubborn little bugger.
. Quickly, he gestured to no other than Zacharias Smith who was walking confidently towards them.
Now Severus appeared to be worriedly bewildered. ‘Draco,’ he hissed, ‘you’ve never met this child, have you?’
He nodded mutely.
Tesco as it turned out, was
As expected, the hall went silent as all eyes flew onto the pair, it was all terribly off putting. Yes, so Draco Malfoy was carrying a small child,
‘I wuv London!’ he squealed looking at Potter with wide eyes, ‘pwease can we go to Tesco?’ he asked hurriedly and Potter nodded. Baffled, Draco looked between the pair completely affronted.

He felt his heart constrict in his chest as he looked at the distressed child, what kind of father left his child unattended? Not him, that’s for certain. He was just about to object yet again when something shiny caught his eye.
Instead on bursting into tears like Draco had predicted, the boy blinked a few times before clambering onto his lap, ignoring Draco’s puffs and protests. Draco was staring into sad eyes as a chubby hand reached out, wiping away a fallen tear from Draco’s cheek.
He couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the ignorant statement, ‘yes, yes Weasel, it's already been established that Potter and I have a kid.’
Potter scoffed, ‘it’s your funeral Malfoy.’ He bent down, picking up Scorpius and fastening him onto his shoulders.
‘Why don’t you go back to your father now, little one?’ he asked Scorpius gently.
‘And what if I say I had nothing to do with it?’ Draco raised a brow challengingly.
He scoffed, ‘it appears that your

The scorching hot water burned his skin, as he ferociously scrubbed his hands. He didn’t care, they deserved to burn anyhow. Perhaps if he worked at it hard enough, the blood that stained his skin would wash right out.
‘I told him I hated him.’
Blaise smiled at the small boy, ‘of course, of course. Sometimes I forget that your Papa bats for the other team,’ he joked and Scorpius glared.
The Headmaster turned his attention to the blonde who sat much like Scorpius, except his posture was much less relaxed.
‘Draco, Draco, Draco,’ Blaise tutted, shaking his head in a gentle condescending manner, ‘
‘You used to be smart Malfoy. Use your bloody head, yeah?’ he told him.

Draco sighed, attempting to rid his tone from any amusement, ‘I have no idea,’ he said honestly. ‘Apparently it’s what muggles have instead of a magical signature. But because merlin hates us, we have it to.’
‘You tricked me,’ he accused.
‘Great Merlin.’ McGonagall breathed. ‘Mr Malfoy what an earth is going on here?’
He didn’t see him, but he did happen upon a few raunchy teens and thought it a bit too much for an eighth-year common room party.
Dazed, he looked around, Potter looked to be unconscious. For a terrified moment, Draco thought about running to Dumbledore and confessing what they’d done. Potter could be dead for all he bloody knew, something about that didn’t sit right with him. Just as Draco made way for the Headmaster’s office, a small cough stopped him in his tracks.

‘No, it’s a fucking dog,’ he deadpanned as he went about cutting up a few sausages and bacon for Scorpius to eat. His eyes drifted back onto Millicent, ‘what does it

‘He didn’t – and
‘You sneaky little—
Snape’s shouts came to a stop as he feasted his eyes upon the small boy. Blinking rapidly, he turned towards Draco in complete disbelief, ‘what is

‘What do you want Draco?’ she asked him.
Draco shook his head, ‘there’s so many things wrong with that statement,’
“Shh,” Harry hushed, pulling away. When he spoke, his breath fanned against Draco’s moist lips. “I’ll take care of you.”
“Shout it for all of Hogwarts, why don’t you.”
The hand that was brushing over his hip dipped lower, bypassing Draco’s hardened cock and cupping his bollocks, massaging them with his fingers. One finger, however, strayed past and slid lower until it was rested flat over his entrance.
“Do you know literally
“Why does that bloke over there on the far end look familiar?” Harry asked his friends, voicing out his thoughts. They immediately paused their conversation and darted their eyes over to where he was looking.
“It’s only Malfoy, mate,” Ron laughed, patting him on the back. “Just keep your eyes on him and don’t look at the crowd. You’ll be fine.”
“I hate you,” Harry grumbled, but found himself smiling at the sounds of Draco’s laughter. He watched him roll onto his back once again, matching Harry’s position, before pulling the blankets over both of them.
Malfoy nodded slightly before walking out and shutting the door behind him. “Why was Malfoy in the kitchens?” Harry wondered aloud once he was sure the man in question was far from range.
“Oh, you know,” Hermione said, waving her hand vaguely. “Just be nice to him.”
He moved slowly at first, giving Draco the time to adjust to the new sensation of having Harry’s cock split him open, thrusting in and out of his body. Harry rested one hand on the underside of Draco’s thigh, pushing down on it a bit while simultaneously parting Draco’s legs more.
, where I also post short fics not on my ao3 account <3
“Please,” Draco found himself begging. “Just start already.”
“Before the food is brought out,” McGonagall casted a sonorous once everyone was seated. “I would like to thank you all for your efforts in rebuilding this school. I’m glad to see that you share the same love for what might have been your second home while growing up as I did, and that we have been able to move forward from darker times. It heartens me to see people get over their past prejudices…”
His hair fell over his face, prompting Harry to reach out and curl it around his finger, twisting the lock and enjoying how silky and soft it felt under his touch. Still no movement from Draco. From there, he began running his hand through his hair in a repetitive motion, something he’d come to learn that Draco liked.
“Half-day,” Harry repeated.
“Mhmm,” Harry gave a humm in response. “He turned out rather well, considering...well.”
“Hey,” Harry mumbled, running to catch up with him. He took his hand and used his thumb to rub circles on his palm. “I really am sorry.”
“Potter, you’ve been on top of me and in my bed multiple times these past few weeks-” Harry’s ears burned. “-Besides, it’s not like we’re actually going to do anything.”
“Yeah, dad. Would it be a good time to remind you that there are other guests at the table?” James asked, suddenly peeling his forehead off the table. “Or should I throw up on you as a reminder?”
“I went to bed early. The rest of them stayed up late talking,” he explained, rubbing the back of his neck. They began walking side by side to the Great Hall with their things, the pile in her arms significantly more for some reason, but knowing her it was probably academic.
“You’ll see,” Harry’s eyes glanced to the side where the 8th Year Slytherins were seating. “Muggles call it acupressure, or something like that.”
“If you find yourself spouting nonsense about blood purity, don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Ron raised an eyebrow at him.
“No, Draco,” Harry said seriously, cupping his chin gently while looking him in the eyes. There was so much concern and affection filled in them that Draco had to look a way, a strange sense of self-disappointment filling himself for reasons unknown to him. “It’s not supposed to hurt.”
“I don’t know,” he waved his hand vaguely. “Something. I got us some lamb too, I guess.” He got up and left their dinner on the kitchen island carelessly before walking down the stairs that lead to his lab. Clearly he didn't care for dinner as much as Harry did.
“We’re just going to apparate,” he explained when Draco glared at his outstretched hand as if it offended him. “It would make this all easier.”
“I propose Firewhiskey,” Seamus said from the other side of Harry’s room. “Always paves the road to solid friendships.” Another perk of the Eight Year dorms were that they each got their own individual rooms due to the small population.
“You found it?” Harry asked, shoving away all the possible reasons and things they get up to when he and Neville are in here, because Harry was the one who was with him now, and he’d much rather savour the moment.
And everything went well. Malfoy was still competitive, refusing to back down from any dare or refuse a truth question. Harry, on the other hand, had backed down from breaking out to give flowers to Filch with a proposal.
“I guess I know what that feels like.”
“Well, of course,” she huffed. “Who’s to say who Draco wants to go out with. If I remember correctly, you said you guys were close during the party.”
“Harry?” She sounded a bit confused. “What are you doing up so early? I was half expecting you and Ron to sleep a bit more today.”
Lightly, he brushed his nose over it before pressing his lips against the skin, peppering small kisses.
“Would you let me go after them?” Harry asked hopefully, only to earn himself a snort from the other man.
“He seems to like America,” Harry commented, raising his eyebrows. “I’m surprised he chose to come here for his final year.”
“Slytherin dorms are fine,” Harry smiled kindly at him, resisting the urge to kiss his worry away.
“Oh, nothing,” Neville flushed a bit once everyone’s eyes were focused on him. “I just… Okay, well I’m planning on asking someone out. I’m just not quite sure how to go about it yet.”

Thankfully, the carriage had just stopped moving, signalling that they had to get off. Ron and Hermione got off first, being the closest ones to the door, and went ahead of Harry and Draco. They continued talking about how they thought the school year would go until they reached the entrance of the Great Hall, where Harry felt rather reluctant to part so soon and go to the Gryffindor table while Draco made off to the Slytherin table on the other side of the hall.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed before straightening himself. “Maybe not.”
“Oh really?” A blond eyebrow was raised. “And how would you do that? Unless you plan on dressing up like Santa and dancing with a bunch of elves dressed like...Christmas elves, I don’t see how you could make it any more eventful.”
“Harry,” Draco’s soft voice echoed through the slightly furnished room. Harry stopped in his tracks to turn and face the other man, his heart stuttering for some odd reason as it was the first time Draco used his given name.
“Great,” Neville exhaled, giving him an easy smile, and now Harry was confused. “You’re the only one I’d trust to leave Draco with for company for a long time. I don’t think the others would fancy being in your place as much.”
“Think you’re so brave do you?” Dean smirked at Malfoy with a glint in his eyes. The blond’s smirk faltered a bit but he kept his head held high, silently challenging Dean to carry on..
“You wouldn’t wake up,” Harry grunted as his arse hit the floor. He supposed he should have felt lucky it wasn’t his back instead. “And this is my revenge for those damn complicated spells.”
Scorpius nodded and Draco let out that deep breath, only to suck it right back in when Scorpius said, ‘If you won’t whispwer den you aft to shout it.’ he demanded, pushing his plate further away from him.
Well, it seemed as though Draco playing a game. A childish, mindless, idiotic, game. He took a deep breath; the night was

‘No. I figure that your pretty content to remain a drunk idiot,’ he told him before walking away.

The boy nodded enthusiastically, ‘Yes, yes Daddy tells me wots of things,’ he declared proudly, before looking around confused, ‘where wis he?’ he asked.
It would be extremely easy now to say yes. So easy, so probable that Draco felt terrified.
A loud gasp to which he assumed was Severus blistered through the silence, as a small, pudgy hand was displayed for them all the see.
She laughed, grinning triumphantly from ear to ear, ‘you’re
He shook his head violently and Potter smiled a smile that lit up his entire face.
Blaise smirked before turning to face Draco, ‘Good, good. That means that it’s of complete relevance when I tell you to get your head out of your arse.’
The curly haired menace smirked and him, wavering slightly. ‘Y’know what Malfoy, if being drunk means having a good time, then I guess I’m drunk,’ he declared quite happily.
He opened his eyes, his vision hazy, his pulse beating erratically. It may have hurt, but it was what he needed to hear. Draco
‘I don’t think my hands are clean yet,’ he gestured to his now bright red hands.
So, you see, Draco could never be the person that Potter wanted him to be. The person that Potter deserved. Because he was still a walking ghost of his past, a victim chained to the demons that lay restlessly in his head, and Potter was
When they’d reached the wing, Madam Pomfrey had looked at them gravely before simply stating that she’d been expecting them. She had then sat them down, and proceeded to cast the necessary spells, ones that had worn out Scorpius, sending him into a deep sleep.
‘YES. YES. YES.’
do you think that would’ve turned out?’
Is cereal soup?
‘You’ve had a whole bloody day to get used to it,’ he pointed his wand in between Draco’s eyes, ‘I’ve had one hour.
He shrugged, ‘throw it in the bin or something.’
‘No.’
Draco blinked.
‘Yes,’ the child replied narrowing his eyes in challenge.
Pansy glared at him before spitting out, ‘at least put him under the covers, you insensitive bastard.’ She told him before walking away, shutting the door behind her.
Scorpius clapped his hands happily, before threading a hand through Draco’s larger ones and pulling him towards the herd of lions waiting in the centre of the room. He forced Draco onto his bottom, then clambered onto his lap, turning to face the Gryffindor’s.
‘Papa, you is mean!’ his lower lip started of wobble and Draco’s breath hitched, he knew
Without a second glance Draco heaved himself from the floor, he had to get him to Dumbledore immediately. This all could be potentially dangerous, who knew what kind of evil had orchestrated this.
The Gryffindor gave him a sharp nod, and without another word led him to the tower where Draco was certain Scorpius was waiting.
Scorpius beamed, nodding enthusiastically and Draco’s heart clenched so hard that he ignored the voice in his head urging him to ask Dumbledore’s permission first. He extended his arm, gesturing for Scorpius to take the sweet, which he did.

‘Shhhh,’ he whispered quietly, ‘don’t you want to play with the snakes?’ he asked pointing to the Slytherin table where Pansy and Blaise were shooting him looks of pity. Well, Pansy was, Blaise was just smirking in a karma is a bitch kind of way.
Draco brushed past her in favour of sitting the main chair that he’d dubbed the throne, it carried an aura of prestige, one that no one was to bathe in but Draco. He had hoped to push this whole Scorpius ordeal far from his mind, he was Potter’s problem now.
don’t have fans. They’re not your friends, you only have followers.’
Potter stood there for a while more, his eyes flickering between Draco and his near enough burning hands, before taking a deep breath and walking out the door.
The boy did nothing but snuggle deeper into Potter’s warmth, and just as Draco was about to pick the child up and drag him away, Potter let out a low cough.
‘I quit!’
Pansy growled, placing her hands on her hips in challenge, ‘all this still doesn’t explain why in Merlin’s name

you have nice hair. Pat. Pat. Pat.’
Whatever blood was left in Draco’s face drained immediately, as he turned to face the small boy still clutching his legs. His nose was planted deeply into the warmth of Draco’s robes, his face was wet with tears. It was as though for him, the safest place in the world was right there, wrapped in Draco’s touch.
‘Why bloody not?’
Feeling far from calm, Draco stood up, his eyes scanning the masses frantically. Scorpius was gone. He’d turned his head for just a single second, and the child was gone. Something must have happened to him. Someone
McGonagall collapsed on a chair that appeared with a small pop, ‘that means that…’ she trailed off looking green. ‘Great Merlin,’ she repeated breathlessly. ‘But… Mr Malfoy’s only eighteen now, so that must mean that…. No, it’s not possible.’

But he wasn’t. He

Scorpius smiled looking up with adoration, ‘me and Papa is gowing to ave a fwantaswic time! It’ll be wike when Daddy’s out fighting bad gwys and it’s just me and Papa left all alone.’ He said, before yawning widely.
‘Papa, you know dat Daddy doesn’t wike it den you say bad words.’ He chastised as if he were of some sort of superiority.
would be. Because things just didn’t work like that. Potter was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, people bowed at his feet. He was all perfection and laughs, and Draco, well… he was nothing but a choice he had made long ago. He gulped as he pulled on his sleeve, covering the Dark Mark further.
‘What, hell? I’ll say hell whenever the
we’re not going to Hogsmeade?’ he growled, absently aware that Scorpius was becoming heavy in his arms.
autumn arrives with a buoyant lack of subtly. There are browns that come as a comforting quilt to the earth, yet the rest are the hues of volcanoes, of firework sparks and festival hoopla. Nature calls out to spring, and the trees can’t help but become as flowers, towering blossoms of flamed foliage to dance into the skies before tumbling as giant confetti to the sidewalks and verges.

Potter sent him a murderous glare, ‘what the
‘And I wanted a broom when I was five.’ He told the child idly, ‘we don’t always get what we want.’
Potter, no, he was quite content to submerge himself in his studies.
It was now one hour later and after an endless battle of pulling and tugging, Draco had been reduced to a whimpering mess. How the hell had his mother done it? The only reason Draco hadn’t been carted off to St. Mungo’s was because he’d bribed the kid with sweets.
Scorpius continued to hit her angrily, ‘Aunt Pans’ don’t talk to my Papa like that. Tis not nice.’ He told her simply.

The atmosphere grew tenser if that were at all possible, as Potter put his wand back into his pocket. Draco sighed out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding in.

He wouldn’t think about Potter. He wouldn’t go to the party. Draco belonged in his own bed, a book in hand, waiting patiently for Potter to need his help.

They’d made their way to the hospital wing not long after Dumbledore had suggested them to. The trip there had been in complete silence, both him and Potter refusing to look at one another. Scorpius to his surprise, had remained silent in favour of nestling his face into Draco’s shoulder.
Thus, Draco had ended up pressed into a crisp white shirt, smothered in tight black skinny jeans, his hair messy in a naturalistic kind of way, and a scowl plastered onto his lips. He looked good; he
Draco held his chin up high in defiance, ‘if not me, who?’ he challenged her, a frustrated edge to his tone.
tired. Still, it would be nice not to hear from the small creature for a good while. ‘Let’s go Scorpius,’ He picked up the boy off the ground, resting him on his hip. ‘Time for bed.’
much more manageable when you’re thinking about Potter, Draco darling.’
Ignoring the stares and whispers, Draco strode across the Great Hall, seating himself at the Slytherin table, placing Scorpius carefully beside him.
Potter once again, gave Draco a frazzled look and he seriously debated whether to aim a discrete silencing charm at the child.
“Hey, look at me,” Harry said, running a hand through Draco’s hair when he let his head drop into his arms, resting over his drawn-up knees.”I wish you told me before, but I think I get it.”
“I suppose it did,” Harry smiled at them, giving Neville a pitying look that he hope portrayed ‘good luck there, mate.’
“What’s wrong with Slytherin?” Draco inquired curiously. If one were to listen closely, they might have even described his tone as defensive.
Harry became acutely aware of how warm it felt to have his chest pressed against Draco’s back and the soft, clean scent that tickled his nose, causing him to abruptly let go of the blond in mild panic.
“You have no idea,” Draco groaned, throwing his head back and exposing the pale expanse of his neck, leaving Harry to stare hopelessly. “Are you sure you’re having fun, though? It’s quite hard to believe when it looked like you were just standing all confused in the middle of the room.”
“What!” Ron demanded. “They didn’t give me one of those! I didn’t even know they had them.”
“I’m working, Potter,” Malfoy said slowly, unsure of Harry’s motivations.
“Of course not, Potter,” He scoffed, straightening out his back. “I’m simply freezing.” Okay, maybe he had a valid reason. It was late into November, after all. But it wasn’t that cold.
And if, when Draco falls asleep from exhaustion after a bad day, and Harry disappears into the night to give some guy a punch and a solid kick to their bollocks before wiping their memory, well, Draco didn’t need to know.
Yes, he was excited for this school year as well.
, he added in his mind.
“I barely even know the guy,” Harry reasoned. “I just find him objectively attractive. It doesn’t mean I want to date him. And we don’t even know if he’s into blokes.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, jogging over. Except, as he neared the tired looking figure, their features began to become clearer, and as they became clearer, they began to look familiar.
He didn’t appear to be a fan, since he wasn’t freaking out or asking for a signature yet, or frantically shaking their hands and thanking them. On the other hand, he didn’t appear to be anyone that hated him as well, sensing no anger or hatred from him.
“Then stop saying it,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s hand and leading them towards one of the free tables.
“Deal.”
, Harry thought, feeling rather amused.
if you want to check it out <3
Reluctantly, because it didn’t really sound like such a bad idea, he agreed. He’s never gotten to do something like this when he was younger, anyway.
“Love you,” Harry whispered into his neck, placing a soft kiss on the exposed skin. Draco couldn’t repress the shudder that ran through his body. He felt Harry smirk against his skin before he placed another firm kiss onto his neck, lips trailing upward towards the back of his ear before tracing his tongue on the outer shell.
“Harry, I’m not just saying these things because I don’t want you to feel bad and give up,” she sighed into her own food. “But at the end of the day, isn’t the person whose opinion matters the most here Draco’s?”
And, as he had done for the past few days, he hesitated. There was something oddly calming about seeing Draco so peaceful, happy and asleep. He found himself entranced with the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest under the sheets, and the soft sound of his breathing that accompanied it.
“What?” Harry laughed loudly, his chest moving Draco’s head violently. “It was just a thought.”
Harry was laughing too hard to be able to reply to him. Maybe he did break him, but he wouldn’t change having Draco Malfoy as his boyfriend for the world. Eventually, he was able to control himself a bit while his worried partner just watched him.
“Hey,” a soft voice sounded through the noisy area whilst students were loading their trunks. “The carriage I was supposed to ride got full. Can I ride with you?”
At that moment, Harry wasn’t sure if he wanted to hit Neville because how could he touch the other man so casually and tell him to stop smiling at Draco like that, or thank him because Draco let out the most adorable giggle, causing his cheeks to pinken.
“I told her I’d think about it because I wasn’t sure if I could be arsed to drag myself out of bed,” Harry replied, grinning. It was the partial truth. The other half was that he was hoping that he could convince Draco to stay with him instead, and maybe gather enough bollocks to make a move on the other man.
Draco began munching happily on the croissant, his partially sleepy, grey eyes occasionally flicking between his coffee, their surroundings, and Harry. Not that Harry was paying attention.
“Malfoy, wake up,” he said a little louder, this time shaking his shoulder violently, moving the blanket to uncover his head. He received a small shift in the sleeping man’s position for his efforts so that his head was facing Harry, but that was about it.
“Okay..?” Harry wasn’t quite sure of what was so spectacular about them, but from the looks of Draco’s face as he gave a small smile in the direction of the plants, Harry knew he wanted Draco to look at him instead.
Draco’s eyes snapped towards his and his sharp features immediately transformed, sticking his tongue out and making a face that looked as if he was heaving his guts out. Harry let out a snort and apparently that was all it took for his two best friends to remember that there were other people riding with them.
Harry couldn’t stop his grin if he tried. “Sounds good. Where should I meet you?”
“Harry, what are you ordering?” Draco asked after giving his own order.
“I have been working for myself for 3 years to attend a Muggle Medical University, which I have been attending for 2 years, live in a shared flat with the other workers for low pay, and have been managing just fine on my own,” Malfoy stated firmly.
“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry smiled before exiting, just catching the barest hint of a smile on Draco’s face as he left.
“Call in sick,” Draco shrugged into the mattress. “We finished up the case, anyway, and we’ve worked many hours overtime for it.”
Draco flushed before looking affronted, crossing his arms defensively. “I don’t sleep in
“Well of course you would,” Ron waved the clipboard in his direction, before letting out a belch. “You have a thing for near-death experiences.”
“Wait,” Draco whispered, pushing himself off.
“Pureblood, Potter,” Draco muttered, reverting back to using Harry’s last name as a means of self-defense.  “We don’t talk about such… private matters.”
Resigning himself to a night of studying and not being with Draco, Harry quietly took his books out while his friends flirted with one another and began staring blankly at the pages, unable to actually focus on the text and instead brooded on his own thoughts.
“Are you going to get dressed now or do I have to jump on you again?” Harry teased, hoping to diffuse the awkwardness that was slowly growing between them.
all the blood stop flowing through his brain and head southwards. Well, he was going to see it soon, that was for sure.
“Draco!” He feigned excitement, trying to ignore the rapid beating of his heart. “How sweet of you to join us,” he slid to the side, making more room for his ‘boyfriend’ to sit with them at the Gryffindor table. A hush fell over the entire Great Hall as everyone paused their conversations to stare at the odd pairing.
“If we’re going like that,’ He eventually managed to get out, placing his hand on the base of Harry’s neck. He suppressed a shudder at the coldness from his hand. “We should just throw in Green as well.”
“I thought of that too, but it could be because he only realized his feelings now, maybe?” Harry mumbled, eyes still downcast.
Harry was distracted and lost in his thoughts, but he was still able to pick up on Draco’s stumble. Choosing not to acknowledge it in case he assumed wrong, he just gave another shrug.
“Well, it’s already glaringly obvious I don’t know him, so what’s he like?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual.
Absently, Harry noted that it seemed there were more students present. Of course he didn’t know every student’s name or face in the school, but he was almost sure that there were students in the older years that were definitely not there before.
“C’mon,” Draco sighed, smiling exasperatedly and taking Harry by the hand. Putting on a bit more show for the guests, he feigned resistance as Draco lead them past all of the tables to where Ron was watching them with amusement in his eyes.
He snatched the towel from Harry’s clutches before reaching up to pat the towel firmly against his head, scrunching his hair through the thick material. “If you do it like that, your hair could become frizzy, and it damages your hair if you do it too hard.”
“Thanks!” Draco’s demeanor immediately went back to its thoughtful state, blushing slightly while flicking his wand towards the oven toaster and having their food levitated to them along with some plates.
“What the fuck were you thinking?” Hermione demanded, causing both Ron and Harry to flinch. She never swore at them before. “You best hope I manage to fix this because if he leaves the program, you will be sorry.”
Harry felt his heart skip a beat. He liked- no, loved -that no matter how long they’ve been dating, Draco will always be able to make him feel a bit nervous and make his heart skip beats. He’d never get tired of that feeling.
“Doesn’t feel like it when you keep choosing that snake over me and Harry.” Silently, Harry wished they wouldn’t bring him into this. “You’re the one acting off, what with your new snake friends and all.”
“Why?” Harry had asked him one day when he caught him doing it.
“Oh, yeah,” Draco said, looking sheepish. “Some of them are alright, and some are coming around and others….well, who knows. I’d like to apologize for Pansy, however-”
At Harry’s silence, he continued. “All things considered, I had a higher chance of surviving in the Muggle world with no money than I do forcing myself to live in the wizarding world with little to nothing.”
“Er..” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Let me ask Draco.”
After blinking to himself a few times, he looked around and realized that while most of the shops at ground level were your regular day-to-day stores, the neon lights climbed up from hidden little staircases that went under the buildings all the way up to the apartments that walled the street high up.
“Draco! Draco! Draco!” he chanted with every bounce, but the only response he got was a slightly disturbed stir. Harry felt himself slowly get tired and decided to flop down on the sleeping figure.
“This is where the magic happens,” Malfoy said, inspecting the bananas and grabbing what seemed to be the largest banana in the bunch and unpeeled it. Then, ceremoniously, he held it by the edge and shoved it down his throat and held it there for a few seconds before pulling it out.
Only the head of Harry’s cock was able to slide in before he felt himself clench tightly around it, wincing while trying to hide his pained expression. Pain shot through him, refusing to allow any further intrusion.
Enjoy!
drag out. He wasn’t sure of what else to say, nor was he sure he’d be able to string together a coherent sentence while Draco was looking at him like
“I am too,” Harry snorted softly.
But Draco had no idea that someone messed up the food orders and they’re getting that sorted, so maybe it would be wiser to indulge him in more socializing.
“I hate you,” Harry huffed, turning onto his side. Yes, it was uncomfortable, but Harry was persistent. He extended his arm towards his partner’s face slowly, trying to see if he would catch him before he striked.
Harry was sorely tempted to do the complete opposite, if not because he’d rather have Draco do it for him every day then for the reason of just spiting him in general.
“Just ask them,” Dean shrugged. “It won’t be that bad, especially if they say yes.”
“I haven’t even lived yet!” Seamus wailed dramatically. “I haven’t dated and I’m going to die from these classes before I do.”
“Idiot,” Harry rolled his eyes fondly, pulling Draco in for another kiss. This time, he reciprocated, parting his lips slightly to allow Harry better access to his mouth. They carried on like that for a few more minutes, just enjoying each other’s presence, until they eventually had to pull away for air.
“Hey, speaking of dating,” Neville piped in, and Harry’s ears immediately perked up. If Neville dates, then he’d probably spend less time around Draco.
“I mean just live with me, like flatmates,” Harry explained. “And maybe we can work on something to get you out of this situation.”
“Ref! Duelling should have counted,”
“What are you on about?” the redhead asked. “She would have never considered going there before, not until he came along.” The last bit was said with such venom that Harry hadn’t heard in a while.
“First time,” Harry repeated, his face going blank. Worry immediately flooded in, and for a brief second, Draco thought that Harry would leave him. Either that, or make fun of him; he wasn’t sure which one he’d prefer.
Well, technicalities.
“Oh- oh fuck,” Draco gasped, arching his back while holding his knees tighter to his chest, hands and legs trembling. “What was that?”
“I love you.”
“Harry!” Draco laughed, trying to squirm away, but Harry held him down by the hips so he couldn’t escape. He could feel Harry shake with silent laughter against his body, mouth pressed against his skin.
Hermione. There was no reason to, not when Neville wasn’t even interested in Draco romantically, as far as they knew.
Harry chuckled a bit, creating small vibrations which prompted Draco to ask him to be still while he took a nap. Being a bit late while being cuddled up to his new boyfriend, he could do. He summoned Kreacher, asking for another drink- nevermind that it was his 3rd that afternoon- and wrapped his arms around the blond that had fallen asleep on him.
Harry alternated between stretching Draco out and rubbing against the gland, always making sure that Draco was in some state of unadulterated pleasure from his ministrations. He watched as Draco’s thighs trembled and his hands held shakily onto his knees, keeping himself open for Harry.
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. You can also receive updates from my
“Everything?” Ron piped up. Harry thought he took another nap, but apparently his best friend has been paying attention the whole time. “So you’re going to be pretty busy the whole year, then?”
“No! And unless you’re planning on apologizing, I think it’d be best if you stayed away from us until they leave for their NEWTs, because Draco is a
“Where’s that Gryffindor bravery, huh?” Malfoy teased, not unkindly. “Don’t tell me I’ve finally bested you at something so very
Draco let out a slow sigh before slowing down his pace and facing Harry. “I know. I’m just really tired. I’m sorry too.”
Something he realized now that the war was over and since they were actively interacting with the git was that he was annoyingly attractive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t care,” Hermine said pointedly. “Innocent until proven guilty. He hasn’t done anything, so I will continue to treat him like any other classmate until we have an actual reason to dislike him.”
“Huh?” Draco asked, his voice muffled. He peeked his head from the top of the casing and eyed the item in Harry’s hand. “Oh, that. It’s Neville’s. He left it here when he came by yesterday.”
With that, she spun and ran in the direction Draco took off to, disappearing over the hill.
Now, however, he was trudging through one of the back Alleys in the city in West Central London; a shortcut to his apartment that was in a Wizarding district- surrounded by several Muggle areas as well.
“I know,” Draco sighed, still cupping his mix of Firewhiskey and hot chocolate in his hands. He was wrapped comfortably on the couch with heavy blankets because, despite the heating charms, he was freezing. “Whatever prompted her to fancy an outdoor party in the winter. I’d say she’s gone barmy, but I think we already knew that.”
“Yes, but I’ve made my point, haven’t I?” Malfoy said smugly.
before barging into the room.
“It’s not?” Draco asked, his eyebrows furrowing. He’s always heard that it might hurt the first time.
“You searched up
The first thing he noticed when they arrived was that it was awfully dim. Not dark to the point where he couldn’t see, but it was clear that the lights were spelled to be dimmer than usual.
This was the day, Harry decided firmly.
He never realized that this was on one of his fairly used routes on the way home but, then again, he didn’t often take it and when he did, it was more likely because he wanted to take a stroll early in the morning.
Or rather, like Draco did when he was fully awake, he conceded. Truly, these past 2 weeks have been rather eye-opening for Harry. Draco could hardly muster a decent summoning charm when he’d just woken up but, unfortunately for Harry, he was still rather adept with stinging hexes.
Draco froze, staring at him with wide eyes. Then Harry froze before pulling his hand away awkwardly.
“Hey, if it makes you feel any better I could set you and Draco to work on the Charms classroom and the other rooms in the second floor for the rest of the week,” Hermione suggested. “I would have made it the library instead, which would make it longer since you’d have to get through a bunch of books, but Madam Pince doesn’t want anyone touching them. Too delicate, she says.”
“No, Potter,” Malfoy said, looking extremely frustrated and confused. “I don’t know.”
Harry situated himself beside Draco and looked over at the strange, pinkish plants that were peeking out of the dirt.
“I’m not sure, sir,” Harry said dutifully because, in all honesty, he
discussing your sex life - or lack thereof - after all.”
Thankfully, the food arrived just in time. Draco was plating their dinner when he heard a knock on the door before smiling to himself. Even when he’s been given access to the floo, Harry likes to knock on his door and be let in properly so that he doesn’t accidentally catch Draco by surprise.
“Have some faith,” Harry laughed, slinging an arm around her, but she simply raised an eyebrow at him before he caved in. “The twins gave me a quill that takes notes for me.”
Sighing heavily as he gave the password, he entered the dorms and headed straight to bed, not bothering to set an alarm for when Hermione’s class was supposed to end so they could get onto revising.
“I would’ve been there anyway,” Draco rolled his eyes, snuggling closer.
Harry soon realized that it was the blond he pointed out just minutes ago, taking confident strides across the hall as he made his way over to the Gryffindor table. His eyes scanned the long table, seeming to be in search of someone until his eyes met Harry’s, and he continued making his way towards them.
Instead of confirming or denying outright, however, the girl just laughed. In fact, she couldn’t seem to stop laughing, tears welling in her eyes while Neville smiled bemusedly at her.
“Hey!” Harry protested, dropping another brick he was levitating.
“Prat,” Harry snorted, willing the blush he could feel fighting its way onto his cheeks to go away. The reason he was single wasn’t a mystery to his best friends, and that reason happens to be standing right next to him.
“Then explain why all the girls at the Slytherin and Ravenclaw table are trying to lean in and join his conversations,” Ron sneered. “He’s probably put some kind of charm on himself so other people would forget what family he comes from.”
Pulling him closer, he held him in a warm hug and said, “I love you.”
Harry could sense Ron trying to fight back a glare as he stood and made his way around the table, allowing booth Hermione and Draco to take a seat in front of them, the latter sitting down with an easy grace that could make heads turn.
This surprised Harry. Of all the things that he was expecting to come out of his former rival’s mouth, this was not one of them. It just didn’t align with how he knew Draco saw himself when they were back in school.
“So you’re really not doing this because you want to go out with him?” Ron clarified once Harry managed to calm himself down.
“Of course,” Harry said, fidgeting. “And..well..”
“I woke up comfortable and I’m going to bloody stay comfortable,” Draco grumbled “And if you think I’m going to make it any easier for you to break in, you’re wrong,”
“I don’t think I could actually not think about fucking you, no,” Harry teased, his grip tightening around Draco’s waist.
“I tried,” Harry said defensively. “It just… tangles easily. I don’t know.”
“Draco!” he said loudly, shaking the worm-like figure under the sheets wildly. “Draco! Get up! Your stupid spells didn’t work.”
“You’re Harry Potter, are you not?” the new figure’s voice was silky and smooth with the barest hint of a French lilt. His face was even more beautiful up close, but his expression was  unreadable.
“S’charmed,” Draco mumbled, apparently also in a similar state. “So that it’s easy to fall asleep and stay asleep.”
Harry hated it when people reminded him that his relationship with Draco was just a game. It always hurt all the same, but being able to be close with Draco in some way was enough.
“Let’s go.”
“I won’t tell you what to do,” Bill said. “But don’t push yourself too hard over this. If you can’t do it or commit anymore, then don’t.”
“Merlin, you’re annoying,” Draco laughed, pressing his face into Harry’s chest. “Let’s eat already, before the food gets cold.”
, his mind thought unconsciously, causing him to freeze.
“Anyhow, I was going to tell you that you don’t have to distract Draco anymore,” Neville told him, and Harry froze on the spot, asking aloud why not. “Well, I figured out a plan and have an idea for our possible date.”
And it made him feel like a right git, because he did promise he would be there.
Although, as much as he hates to admit it, it did take a while longer to get them undone. It’s not his fault he doesn’t exactly remember every series of spells that need to be done at the top of his head like Draco did.
“Would it be alright if we did it in the Slytherin dorms?” Draco asked, his gray eyes peering at him through the blond strands of his hair. “Unless it’s inconvenient of course and you’d prefer your dorms but I-”
“Half-day,” Harry compromised, unsure as to why he was doing so as the words flew out of his mouth.
“Ferret?” Harry repeated, resisting the urge to quirk his lips into a smile.
“Right,” Harry nodded. “I’ll be sure to build you a solid case file, then.”
“Oh my gods, let go of me,” Draco laughed, trying to play off how flustered he was.
“So he travels a lot?” Harry asked.
His boisterous entrance did nothing to awaken his partner, though, forcing Harry to resign himself to manually waking him up again with a sigh. Not really in the mood to wrestle Draco out of bed, he sat down at the very edge, feeling the bed dip under his weight, facing towards his sleeping friend.
Harry must’ve noticed the crowds thickening as they walked, with some people even managing to weave their way in between Draco and Harry to get ahead, prompting Harry to grab is husbands hand.
His blond head snapped up to face Harry and, if it were possible, seemed to pale even more. All movement seemed to freeze in that moment when Malfoy recognized Harry as well, both of their breathing taking a pause.
“Hey, Draco!” He called before he could think to regret his actions. Deciding to just go with it, he began a slow jog over to where the man was standing, waiting for him to catch up. “You’re taking Transfiguration, right?”
“Of course I’m ready,” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. “I just- I mean I’ve been preparing for this for a while now. I want you, I really do.”
“Ever since I’ve heard about you two at Hogwarts during our last year, really,” Narcissa replied, completely disregarding her son.
“Are you still so sure about that?” Harry asked once they finally pulled away to breathe.
“You wish, Potter,” gray eyes rolled at him. “I’ll meet you after dinner.”
He forced himself to not put too much meaning behind this little detail he noticed, but that didn’t stop him from hoping.
“Absolutely not!” she exclaimed, drawing some attention towards them. Draco gave them an apologetic smile before they decided to turn back to their own conversations. “You were
“Hey there, hot stuff.”
“Quick, steal some roast before we book it to our rooms,” Harry whispered to Draco, who grinned and obliged, casting a notice-me-not charm and levitated the food, along with some alcohol with them.
“Maybe you ought to have asked the Headmistress,” Harry snorted. “It’s only the first day, anyway. They’ll probably just go over everything we need to learn before actual lessons start.”
They walked at a leisurely pace, giving Harry the chance to have a look around as they passed. All things considered, such as the fact that he was here without the risk of getting caught or looking for a possible murderer, the common room actually seemed quite nice.
like that."
, he hoped.
“I’m sorry, what was that?” he asked with a small, amused smile.
“I’d say we’ve both won.”
Dean shouted “come in,” and a shock of blond hair peeped through the open doorway.  “The elves told me they made Roast and Treacle for dinner. Thought you ought to know before it runs out.”
“Careful, Potter. We’re making a scene now,” Malfoy whispered lowly into Harry’s ear, possibly making sure that others wouldn’t hear their conversation. Thankfully, it was only the 8th years that were openly staring and whispering as the younger students remained oblivious as to what was happening at their table.
“I don’t want him to think that I’m incompetent in… matters of the bedroom.” he muttered. “What if I’m not as good as his past partners?”
For the whole week, they spend their breaks with one another instead of going up and down the hallways to eat outside when there were “perfectly good tables to eat on here.” Except on this last day, Neville came up to where they were working and brought Draco lunch.
In all honesty, Harry didn’t mind, but Draco was being kind, so he would indulge. He heard Draco’s footsteps fade under the sounds of the rushing water of the shower, scrubbing at his head lazily until the slick texture of the potion could no longer be felt. When he turned around, he saw a fresh towel slung over the door and grabbed it, using it to rub vigorously at his wet hair.
Yeah, he could do that.
“Draco, Harry!” Hermione called out into the empty hallway, her head peeking out through the door, looking a bit sheepish. “Class is about to start.”
Once their food arrived, their conversation had settled down a bit. Harry was quick to shovel down a portion of his food, which didn’t escape Draco’s notice, as he earned himself an amused glance from his husband.
“It’s a beautiful day out. Nothing wrong with a short walk,” Draco responded, his hair flying a bit because of the light breeze. He looked happy like that, just smiling under the sun while holding Harry’s hand.
Harry briefly went over the situation which should be enough to make a case against the man, which still took a bit longer than expected since he needed to sign some paper work, before apparating back to the alley where he left Draco.
“Why not?”
“It’s your prostate,” Harry responded, no judgement evident in his voice. “Feel good?”
Plus, Harry found his reformed personality highly endearing. Of course, he was still a git but it was rather difficult to hate him when he saw him tutoring students in the lower years or silently sorting books in the library. Call it a minor fancy at the most, but that’s really all it was. Really.
Draco marched into their living room which they had been sharing for about 5 months now. Harry, slightly exasperated at being disturbed from his knitting, looked at his boyfriend whom he had been seeing for about 4 years now. It was strange, he’ll admit, how they ended up together, but he doesn’t regret it. What started out as a bunch of awkward encounters, to silent confiding and conversations, turned into a relationship.
“Don’t what, Draco?” Harry asked him softly. He was surprised that they were still talking since he half-expected Harry to just get up and leave in disappointment.
“Malfoy, Draco!” Some murmurs broke out across the Hall for reasons unknown to Harry. He suspected that some recognized his name, but then he heard a Ravenclaw from the other table squeal and shake the girl sitting next to her.
“Here,” Harry offered, helping him with the tie. Draco tried to make it unobvious that he was frustrated, instead choosing to let his eyes wander off to somewhere beside their bed. “There we go,” Harry said after a few seconds. “It’s all done.”
“Since work is almost up, why don’t you just stay here,” Harry offered. “Then we can head to the Burrow together.”
“Hey, Draco!”
When he peeked through the hair that had fallen over his eyes, he saw that Harry’s head was thrown back in pleasure. He didn’t notice when Draco’s head began to lower until a small puff of breath washed over his sensitive skin.
“Oh dear,” she sighed once more. “Well, you never know. He might not say yes.”
“Define
“Don’t think too hard on it, love,” Draco waved his other hand in the air. “Mother is in a lovely mood. She’s excited for the children.”
“I told you not to talk to much. All that running around in my head must’ve tired you out as well,” Draco managed to get out, trying not to shove his face into his pasta in regret.
He walked as fast as he could without being obvious to catch up with the lone retreating blond figure in the hallways.
“Won’t you be busy, then?” Harry asked, hoping that if Draco says yes, at least he’ll have a way to still spend time with him, even if it’s just as friends.
He gestured to one of the free sofas and they both sat down, closer than Harry was expecting but somehow not close enough for his liking. “Got tired of hearing Pansy talk about Witch Weekly?”
Harry wanted to scream. Neville was waving him over from one of the hallways and Draco had begun pulling himself out of Harry’s space to look at his friend properly.
“Whatever you say, mate,” Ron teased. “And he’s from a prissy Pureblood family. Honestly, not likely.” Harry felt something inside him twist, although he had no idea why. Somehow, the thought just disappointed him.
, Harry thought, as if he wasn’t regretting this already.
“This way,” the Slytherin instructed him, not even sparing a glance around the room. There were a few curious stares but other than that, nobody seemed to mind his presence there. It was no secret that it had become more common to allow members of other houses into their dorms, provided that they were let in by one of the hosting house members.
The students performed another set of fancy charmwork to entertain the students as they passed, smiling at the rows of tables until they reached the front where they stood in 3 neat rows.
Harry had forgotten that he and Hermione were supposed to do that. “Oh,” he mumbled, trying not to sound too disappointed. “It’s alright, I’m sure I can figure it out on my own.”
Harry felt himself melt at those words, resting his forehead against Draco’s.
“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Hermione asked him once he reached the Gryffindor table. Even if the Eight Years got their own dorm, they were still allowed to eat with their old housemates. Allowed being the word because others, very few others, would opt to eat with their friends from other houses.
His skin felt warm where they connected, a somewhat comforting feeling for Harry, as they disapparated. Once they arrived with a soft crack into Harry’s living room, he set the bag down on his sofa.
“What?” Harry asked defensively, even though he knew exactly why Ron was pissed.
“Shut up,” he grumbled, blushing a bit and ducking his head down.
If when Draco gets hurt or mistreated while he’s working and comes home crying, nobody had to know. If Harry was always waiting for him to get back with a soft blanket and hot chocolate for when these things happened, and that he would hold Draco until he calmed down so they could talk about it, running his hand through his hair and placing a soft kiss to the top of his head, until the blond fell asleep in his arms, that was their business.
“Truth,” he said eventually. No need to get him into any more situations like Gay Chicken.
“How lovely of you two to join us,” Narcissa smiled at them, subtly calling them out in front of all of the children. They all just smiled and waved ,though, much to Draco’s awkwardness and Harry’s amusement.
Harry concluded. He took a step back out of the doorway, preparing to leave as he added, “I better see you with Malfoy before the lunch break.”
“Silence, please! Do not worry, many of the new students who have joined us last year have already been sorted. Today, you will simply be meeting the first years, so do not worry yourselves about going hungry over an extended sorting,” Headmistress McGonagall sighed.
She gave him a skeptical look but shrugged it off and called for the rest of those who were left behind to follow as they marched their way into Hogsmead and took a Floo to Neville’s place.
“Harry, are you ready to go?” he heard Hermione ask him from behind, turning around and closing his mouth with an audible clack.
“Right,” his best friend huffed. “I was just making sure that you’re thinking with your head and not your cock.”
“But…” Harry pondered, wondering if this would be the best thing to say. He had only just managed to calm Ron down about the whole Draco thing, so he wasn’t sure if he should push it; especially since he knew the red head still disliked him.
“No!” Harry said, head shooting up from his moping on the table. “I mean, in part. But seriously, I’m fine. I can handle myself.”
“Are you sure about that?” Draco whispered, his face suddenly just mere inches from Harry’s own, making the man jump  in surprise, neary falling off the bed.
“Perhaps I was just looking for an opportunity to see how long my magic trick would hold up,” Malfoy responded haughtily, and Harry nearly choked on his own spit. Then, in a sudden bout of bravery, he surged forward and pressed his lips against Malfoy’s soft, pink ones. He vaguely heard the surprised gasp escape the other man’s throat, but he was more focused on the way Malfoy felt against his body; how it just felt so right to be pressed against him and how their bodies fit together.
“What’s the point, I already saw him when we woke up” Harry groaned, feeling a bit antsy and just desperate to see Draco before the entire ceremony. They invited too many people for Harry’s liking, but Draco insisted it was a courtesy to invite all those other people. Maybe if he got to him now, he could convince him to elope instead.
“‘Aside from that,’ Draco added, and Harry’s gaze immediately shifted to the Slytherin. “Since they didn’t exactly receive a proper introduction to the school, the Prefects were given a list of each new student so they could keep an eye on them. Answer any questions they might  have or help them keep up with classes, in case there are lessons they didn’t learn before and might need in the following years.”
“If that’s what you want to call it, then sure,” the man shrugged nonchalantly, as if it were a perfectly reasonable, day-to-day assignment. “I’ll tell him to prepare a way for you to enter later, when you do manage to bring him in.”
“C’mon,” Harry urged, like how one would do a sulking child. “There’s coffee waiting for you in the kitchen.”
Draco felt himself relax further once Harry stopped, grinning brightly at him before licking a broad strip up from the base of his cock all the way to the tip.
“Best call Hermione, then,” she sighed. “At least that way we’ll have a healer in the area. Are you staying for dinner?”
He took no offense to that and gladly let her get to work, but offered the help of Bill Weasley when it came to the curses. While he knew that she knew what she was doing, having grown up there, he didn’t want her to accidentally hurt herself while getting rid of cursed family heirlooms. She accepted, of course, and he told her she could take whatever she wanted from the house if she ever found anything.
However, he still had a job to do.
Harry zoned out of their conversation not long after that. He wasn’t much in the mood to join their conversation, and he could sense his best mate wasn’t either. He seemed to still be suspicious of the new comer, and Harry had to admit that he felt the same, just slightly.
“I’d like to think using your grandfather’s hair potion would be pretty good branding as well,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at him. “You know considering it was made for your hair type and all.”
“No!” Harry shouted from his place among the tables, earning his a smack on the head from Draco and a laugh from the rest of their guests.
the grin in Draco’s voice. “It’s a Ministry-wide mystery as to how you’re still single.”
“I think that’s in part to the fact that he was never really around his parents much,” Hermione explained, understanding his unfinished question.”Actually, he hasn’t really been around them much since he was 7, since they sent him away to study in that school in Japan.”
“I had asked about that but the Headmistress said getting to know the different houses could help them decide better which house they might prefer or fit in better,” he heard Hermione’s voice explain vaguely in the background.
On the bright side, he’d get to spend more time with Draco this way. At least he could try to figure out whether what he felt during the night of the party was just on him or if it was mutual.
“Already?” Harry panicked, not really wanting to dive into a case without his partner. And if this was another high profile case, there was no way in hell he had any plans of doing it without Draco. “But Draco hasn’t come in yet.”
“At least you won’t be able to cockblock us in the lake.”
“Oh nothing,” he said lightly, but before Harry could prod, he quickly added “I’m just glad you came.”
“Of course not,” Draco drawled. “You’re the host, so you should greet them.”
, where I also post short fics not on my ao3 account <3
He liked him, that much he was aware of. He also knew that he was pretty sure they’ve been flirting for the past week, ever since he unconsciously brushed his hair back when he was on top of him.
“We will be handing in a file for the re-assignment of partners,” Draco said dutifully with a small nod. Harry’s head snapped to look towards him, but Draco just gave him a look that said
“Well,” Draco hummed thoughtfully, his fork waving in the air. “You’ve been in my bed already. Why not make it official?”

“I mean, just because I find him attractive and all, you’re not mad about me and Ginny?” Harry asked tentatively.

That last statement left a sour taste in Harry’s mouth, but he watched the other man’s retreating figure make its way through the doorway.

“Harry, look at what I got!”

“That’s what happens when you’re a Pureblooded queer,” Malfoy sneered at Harry as if he thought the other man wouldn’t understand. In all fairness to him, Harry didn't. Not really.
“She is,” Ron nodded, a small smile finding its way onto his face. Harry doesn’t think he noticed it, but he thought it best to not point it out. “Just give me the go signal if I can hex him.”
“And you look rather cute all rumpled when you just wake up,” Harry retorted.
Harry noticed some of the Slytherins shift uneasily, but kept his focus on the new Headmistress. The Slytherins were accepted here, everyone knew that by now, and everyone got on just fine.
But then, would Harry be able to help himself when he’s around Draco?
“So you can fix it!” his ecstatically clueless boyfriend exclaimed, following him while Arthur, who had the decency to be embarrassed, trailed along. “You’re the best. I love you.” and just to emphasize it, he draped himself around Harry, engulfing him in a hug from behind and kissing hiss cheek.
——————————————
It seems that his partner has gotten more creative with his spellwork, and Harry seriously considered just kicking the door down until it gave way, because he’s thought of every spell they learned in training and nothing seemed to work.
“I don’t know,” he replied honestly, feeling helpless
“It is safe, right?” Molly asked worriedly, peeking her head out from the kitchen.
“Good luck with that,” Draco laughed. “Well, he wants to leave right after breakfast, so I should probably rest early.”
“Harry,” Draco groaned when he moved his thigh, Harry’s erection now pressing into him. Slowly, he felt his own cock begin to rouse, his pulse quickening when he realized that
He rubbed his head and pouted at his best friend. Harry ignored them all and looked down, mumbling “I’m not creepy.”
Draco subconsciously leaned into the touch, making Harry grin widely. Perhaps they could spare a couple of minutes more.
“Hey, mate?” Ron started once they were in the hallway, glancing over at Harry.
Nope, Harry was not feeling good.
With that, he began making his way to the door and lock himself in his room in panic while he contemplated whether this was a good idea or not. He should probably floo Ron and Hermione tomorrow and tell them about the new... development.
“Wait,” Draco murmured, pushing himself back a bit. “I already prepared myself. You can just go.”
“Right,” Ron scoffed before his shoulders went slack, a sign that he’s given in. “But I’m not going to talk to you either as long as he’s around.”
“Hello, love,” Harry said, giving him a smirk. “Is it all up to your expectations?”
know. In fact, he was beginning to feel a little concerned himself.
“What happened?” he heard Draco ask worriedly, now somewhat more aware of his surroundings. Footsteps padded their way over to where Harry was standing before he felt another shoulder press against his, right before a pale hand reached out for his own and gently lifted it out of the water.
“Draco Malfoy,” he used Draco’s whole name, because it sure sounded pretty intimidating when Hermione did it to him and Ron. “If you don’t get up right this second, I’m eating your breakfast.”
“I’d imagine you were too, when you got stuck,” Draco smirked. Another flush creeped its way up from his neck, but nothing could kill his good mood.
“Sorry,” Harry said unapologetically with a soft smile,  still completely naked and exposed. There was another moment of silence, and Draco wasn’t sure of what to say to make the situation less tense.
As for Harry’s crush, it only grew as he spent more time with the Ex-Slytherin. He got to know him better and understand him more. There were able to eventually open up to more serious and private subjects like the War or what Harry experienced at the Dursleys’, which resulted in a nice evening of cuddling.
“Fuck!” he yelped, rubbing the back of his head. He looked down and realized that the perpetrator was a small sodding Jenga block.
The Slytherins’ heads snapped towards him just to make sure he was really talking to them. The got on well enough, he supposed. There was less hostility between the houses now and sometimes they engaged in polite conversation during classes and in the common room, but they weren’t exactly friends, no matter what the occasional parties they have in the 8th year common room might imply.
“Exactly.”
“No,” he said. “You said you weren’t going to meddle, and I’m holding you to that.”
“Wouldn’t it make sense to have them sorted now so they can sit at their assigned houses already and get to know them?” Ron asked, but Harry was barely paying attention to their conversation. His attention was dead-set on a blond standing off in the second row on the far opposite end of the hall.
Or at least, it was. Harry finally got the chance to talk to Draco alone more. He felt like they were finally getting closer at that point, and not because they were being put together in the same group. No, this was Draco genuinely enjoying having a conversation with him, and just the thought of Draco liking Harry’s presence was enough to cause a giddy, fluttering feeling to wash through him.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned, capturing his lips into another sweet kiss while adjusting Draco’s legs so that his thighs rested on either sides of Harry’s spreading his legs open. He ran his hands gently over Draco’s sides, caressing the skin there, making him shudder with pleasure. “I would have loved to see that.”
“You’re just jealous,” was the reply Harry settled on. He looked like he was planning to add more, but his plan was foiled by the waitress that came and asked them for their orders.
“Really, Pans,” he gave her a shaky smile. “I’ll be fine.”
“What’s the lesson?” he heard Draco ask as they were walking away. “I’ve got some notes from a friend in Ilvermorny who was able to graduate on time. Maybe it could help, assuming that-”
Now that he had pointed it out, Harry noticed that unlike the blankets he had on his own bed, Draco’s had a thin duvet on it, something that shouldn’t make him overheat during the hotter parts of the year given the cool air of the dorm from being situated under the lake.
“Well, yeah,” Harry shrugged. “But I figured having a rat’s nest on my head was pretty solid branding.”
“Great, because I might have some ideas.”
“I mean, we’re basically the reason this whole thing started.” Seamus continued, still looking at Harry as he batted Ron off him.
“Let’s get breakfast, then. The others probably think we plan on sleeping through the ceremony or something,” Draco said, pulling away from Harry, who wanted to pull him back towards him and just hold him forever.
“Draco! You’re here,” Hermione mused. “Neville saw Luna and decided to join her.”
Harry was sorely tempted to say something sarcastic or teasing back, but he noticed the light sincerity in the other man’s tone and decided against it.
“You really are bonkers,” Harry laughed, pulling Draco closer and burying their faces in each others necks.
“You can move again,” Draco whispered, mind still slightly hazy from his orgasm. He felt Harry continue thrusting into his sensitive channel, the sensation going straight to his spent cock. One, two, three thrusts until Harry’s pace became erratic, and Draco felt warm spurts flood him inside.
“However, the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic has reached out to us over the summer regarding an exchange program with the students,” she informed everyone, and more chatter occurred, but it did not deter her from speaking. “Their options normally consist of the schools in America, so this is the first time we’ll be hosting them here, aside from the Triwizard Tournament.”
“You- You’re right,” Harry sighed, already dreading the fact that one day he’d have to tell him. He’d have to end things because they couldn’t keep playing around like that forever.
The kids cheered, looking more and more excited. One of the kids, a small boy with ruffled brown hair walked up to where Harry and Draco were standing.
“T-thanks,” Harry stuttered, feeling slightly embarrassed since Draco was still examining his hand. Draco looked up at his flushed face before turning red himself, abruptly dropping Harry’s hand in embarrassment.
“Alright, I will not bore you with any more announcements. Those can wait for the Opening Feast,” there was a collective but scattered groan from a few students, but the tone was light and joking. “For now, let’s enjoy ourselves.”
“Okay, let’s get one thing clear, Potter,” Malfoy said, his eyes narrowing into slits. “While I don’t find my situation to be the most ideal, I am not ashamed of myself or what I do.”
“Duly noted,” Harry mock saluted. Once he was dressed, they slowly made their way into the Great Hall for breakfast, which was right before the ceremony.
“I didn’t know you worked around this area.”
Food was silently levitated onto the table in front of their respective owners. “Always had your eye since then, huh?” he teased his slightly pink-tinged husband.
Harry nodded mutely, giving him a tight smile before letting himself out of the room, not trusting himself to say anything else that might give his feelings away.
Forgetting just about everything in the world, Harry grinned and dived forward, pulling the other man in for a kiss. A real kiss. It wasn’t as long as he would have hoped, but at least now he knew he would be able to keep doing it again.
“You don’t know Draco.” Yeah, Harry was well aware of that fact, as Zabini had already pointed it out. “So stop talking about him like you do. You’re just as prejudiced against Slytherins as you imply they are about any Muggle-related thing.”
“I know,” Draco muttered, but he still couldn’t help the insecure feeling at the back of his head. “I just- I think I’ll get ready for when he comes over. The food should be ready soon.”
“Yes, but you know Harry. He could fall from simply standing.”
The streets were crowded with what Harry assumed were Muggles. This was still the Muggle section of the city, he noted. He took a right and was momentarily blinded by the bright neon lights that filled the street, still crowded with people.
“...With you?” Harry clarified, unsure as to whether or not he actually wanted to accept the offer.
“Ever the charmer, even on our wedding day,” Harry grinned, stumbling a bit.
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco gave him another smile, and Harry was vaguely aware of the students that were still training behind them, possibly listening in on their conversation. “Goodnight.”
“I’m good at many things,” was the immediate response, making Harry’s thoughts spiral downwards. Thoughts and, apparently, the blood that was meant to be flowing through his brain.
“I don’t mind,” Draco said after giving it much thought. “Just as long as I get a say in the renovations as well.”
Harry was torn between prying for more information or letting it go for now and bundling the thinner man into his arms and buying him cocoa. He sighed. “It’s okay, you don’t have to tell me. Would you like cocoa?”
Harry had stared at his pouted lips a bit too long, but thankfully the other man didn’t notice, neither did he notice Harry’s eyes widen and slight panic when he realized he fancied Draco Malfoy.
"You might be handling it," Harry said. "But who's actually taking care of you?" This made him pause. "I care, Malfoy, because even if you're a prat, this isn't fair, okay? If the Ministry had known, they probably could have provided you with an alternative."
He did quickly before returning to the bed and going back to kissing his fiance.
“Well, no shame in admitting I liked you. I succeeded anyway.” He huffed proudly.
“I mean, I know bringing it up could be a bit strange, and even awkward,” Harry shrugged, giving him an easy smile. “But at least I would know what to do next time.”
“I’m sorry, but do we know you?” Hermione asked, finally speaking up for the rest of them and asking the question that they all seemed to have on their minds.
“I am dressed,” he insisted.
“I’m sure it was,” she scoffed, ignoring his second comment. Somehow she, along with the rest of their friends, had come to the conclusion that they had done something other than kiss and cuddle for a bit before coming to their party.
When the students were being dismissed to their common rooms, Harry got up when Hermione did and followed them out. Technically, he could probably get away with roaming around a bit before curfew, but he was knackered.
“You have a point,” he started when he saw her give him a pitiful look. “But I’m not sure. I don’t think I’d be able to get over him just like that, but I also don’t want to lose him.”
“Yeah, Harry,” he drawled the name out in a rather sexy voice, if Harry may say so himself. “Are you sure you can handle it?”
“Did you just buy the company?”
“Rather hot in here, ‘innit?” He smirked, knowing fully well that Harry was slightly red and hot still from embarrassment and...something. No need to brood on that something though, because he has a Hufflepuff to kill.
--------------------------------------------------
“What-” Harry sputtered, affronted.
He agreed, and that’s what they did. The Weasley’s were a generous bunch, and they accepted Draco with open arms. Most of them, at least. It would take some warming up for some others to get used to him, much more really like him, but it was enough.
“But it was messy, and I messed up with your ties,” Draco mumbled, eyes darting back down.
"Don't worry, love. I'll always be here to-Hey, I found another one,” Harry said, causing Draco to run over from his spot to observe it. “It’s kind of strange, though,”
It was a sharp contrast from the formal dress shirts and fitted robes the man often wore to work, and Harry felt his world go off-balance for a second.
“Well... I said no, didn’t I?” All things considered, he probably deserved that pinch. “If you regret this because I pound your toes in, it’s on you.”
“I hope the person ‘Mione gets is decent,” Ron said randomly as they made their way down the hall.
Harry nodded, agreeing with a small, fond smile of his own.
“Porn, Draco?” Harry asked, a full-blown grin sliding onto his face.
“Then maybe you should be careful what you wish for, especially so close to Christmas.”
“What?” the blond clarified.
“Is this some sort of Gryffindor thing?” Malfoy asked. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would say that he was whinging. Thankfully he had enough self-preservation to not openly grin at the tone.
But, as the fates would have it, Ron got to him before that could happen.
“It’s you, right?” Harry clarified, wanting to make sure even though he had a strong gut feeling that he already knew his answer.
“Why would I leave you alone with my mother? I’m not that rude,” He huffed. Harry smiled and ruffled his hair, something he does on occasion even though it annoys the blond to no end.
“Oh please,” Harry huffed. “He’s around Neville too much for that statement to be true,” Harry mumbled under his breath, rolling his eyes until he realized how that might have come off to Ron, who was most definitely on Neville’s plan of asking Draco out.
She wasn’t wrong, he supposed. He’ll probably hear more about it once he drinks too much over it.
“Speaking of that,” he tried to sound nonchalant as he brought the topic up. “Neville mentioned that he was thinking of asking someone out.”
“Am I provoking some sort of, ah, inappropriate ideas at the table, then? Am I bothering you?” Malfoy had gotten up from his seat at this point and slowly sauntered over to where Harry was seated.
And with that, she got up with all the grace that the Beauxbatons students seemed to possess with Neville following suit.
“Because,” Draco huffed, looking down and fiddling his thumbs. “You’re not the only one who can say stupid shite at the wrong time, you know.”
“Him,” she repeated, just to be sure. “Aright, so what do you know? You’re being a bit strange about this, Harry.”
“It’s no problem to me. I like Draco.” If only he knew how true that statement was.
——————————————
“He’s an alright bloke now, I guess,” the redhead continued, shrugging his shoulders. “If you really like though, you should stop it with this game. You’ll never have anything real if you keep it up.”
“Yes, Potter,” Another voice drawled from the doorway. “I might be in an amiable mood, given the right compensation.”
“Harry!” Draco snapped, although it came out sounding more like a plea. “Just fuck me already!”
“Hey, mate,” he ran into Neville after Potions, his last shared class with Draco for the day. Afterwards, the Slytherin was heading to Ancient Runes with Hermione while that was Harry and Ron’s last class for that day. “Can we talk?”
After much arguing, though, he eventually settled for one of Harry’s jeans and a rather large knit sweater. Given that they also agreed to use softening charms on each of them, something Harry didn’t realize was an option.
“Fuck!” he yelped, pulling his burnt hand away from the hot metal. He forced his eyes to refocus on the task at hand and checked the damage before ditching the food and making his way to the sink so he could run the burn under cold water.
He considered the satisfying possibility of burning the food and flaunting it but, really, eating it right in front of him would be so much more gratifying.
“Slow down there,” Harry said, with a small, bright grin. This frustrated Draco more because it meant that Harry was catching on, and was probably making fun of Draco in his head because of his inexperience. Determinedly, he curled his fingers around Harry once more so that he could continue.
“Of course, Malfoy,” Hermione said kindly. “We understand that your father’s actions are not your own. As long as you really don’t share the same, uh…
“I’m sure we’ll have plenty of time
?” Harry asked, now feeling suspicious.
“Draco left me a note!” He suddenly remembered, digging around in his pocket and earning a smack from Fleur, who was still attempting to tame his birds nest.
He refused to do that, though, and forced himself to try and swallow the gulp he took in, slightly choking on his hot drink as he did so.
you,” Harry grumbled, storming into the familiar bedroom and, honestly, this was not how he imagined he would be getting familiar with the other man’s bedroom.
Harry, much to Draco’s horror, had come out on stage in a full Santa costume, having spelled the hair on his head white along with his medium-length stubble that border-lined a full beard. Well, that explained why he refused to shave in between the few days they had been meeting before the party.
“Draco will be there, won’t he?” Harry inquired, trying his best not to look too excited. “I could walk you to the back, if you want. In case there are still a few students who haven’t gotten over the novelty of you being a war hero and all. Safety reasons.”
“No, I won’t,” Harry said firmly. “What’s wrong? You’ve been acting strange all evening. Do you even want to do this, still?”
“Your father is a Slytherin, and everyone in that house is just like him. Should explain enough for you,” Ron sneered. “They all buy into that Pureblood bullshit. That house is full of conniving bastards who only care about themselves, just like the founder of the house. In fact, that’s probably where they got it from.”
“Nope,” Harry grinned, popping the ‘p’. “You’re stuck with me forever.”
He watched as Draco grinned triumphantly before fluttering his eyes closed, long eyelashes resting against his high cheekbones. He looked so happy in that moment that Harry really wanted to kiss him.
“And pray tell, why would you do that?” he asked, pushing up his glasses to rub in between his eyes. Maybe they didn’t see it. Maybe it was an accident and his father figure and boyfriend were still mentally sound. Maybe-
“Potter!” He heard the front door bang open and loud footsteps, normally quiet and graceful, making their way upstairs to the bedroom. He panicked quietly and began shoving his things into the bag, ignoring how crumpled they were or if they took too much space like that.
“Well, it’s Draco driving,” Harry said slowly, hoping that was enough of an explanation.
“Follow me,” Draco said, leading him through the entrance.
“That was awful,” he coughed, hitting his chest with his fist in attempts to clear his airway.
“Why?” Draco suddenly looked suspicious, as if Harry might have a secret motif for wanting him away from any possible witnesses to their conversation. Yeah, in hindsight, it did sound awfully sketchy.
“Is that what this was about?” Harry asked, stunned.
Draco huffed, testing to make sure that the legs were even so it wouldn’t rattle.
are you like this?” Harry sighed exasperatedly, wanting to pull his hair out.
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco huffed, now completely amused. “Don’t you know there are potions for that?”
“Yeah, ‘Mione,” Ron nodded, agreeing with Harry. “I doubt he’d be able to focus even more if he and Draco are dating by that point.’
“But maybe you could- er, help me understand this a bit better?” Draco suggested weakly, his blush returning. “It’s- I did research,” he admitted, feeling his face heat up. “It just… didn’t go like how I was expecting.”
“Anything to get that reaction out of you,” Harry replied cheekily, practically grinning from ear to ear. “Remember when I used to do this when we were back in Hogwarts? You were such a hard-arse about them too. I remember asking: Is your father a thief? Because someone stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes, and your reply was-”
Draco felt his cheeks heat up at Harry’s dirty words, his mind going blank for a split second.
“That’s..nice,” Harry said, because what else was there to say. He was correct when he assumed there were new students, but he was more surprised to hear that some of them came back even after having to suffer under Death Eaters. “Wait, so what are you guys going to do?”
“So when I’m horny, can our code be
“It’s alright, kinda” Draco said, suddenly serious, but he still had a small smile on his face. “It helped me realize that things like that are bound to happen, all things considered. But thank you for being kind about it now.”
It was eerily quiet.
“I don’t either,” he admitted, bringing a hand up to brush his thumb over his boyfriend’s cheek. He gave him a lingering kiss, restraining himself from extending it as they were still at work.
“Presumptuous much?” Draco rolled his eyes before returning to the task at hand, which was surveying the crowds and looking for Harry.
“Well you sound comfortable,” Draco snorted, his head now inside the trunk. Harry rolled over so that he could respond properly, except his head rolled onto the corner of something hard and somewhat sharp.
He untwisted it, taking off the top with a soft ‘pop’ before pulling out a small velvet box and paper.
“And how much did it cost you?” He then decided to ask. It wasn’t like money was an issue for them but, well, for the sake of practicality. What would they even do with a car? Run people over in Diagon Alley?
“Hey,” Harry said awkwardly, letting the
“Thank you,” Draco said without waiting for Harry to ask what he needed. Harry just nodded, unsure of what Draco was thanking him for specifically, but he didn’t care. Whether it was for speaking at his trial, or getting that guy off him in the alley, or offering him a place to stay, Harry didn’t know. He just knew that he was filled with warmth, and that this was the right decision.
Eventually, Harry left his nipples in favor of trailing kisses down Draco’s chest, all the way to his stomach before lifting his head slightly, breathing over the damp spot where pre-come had begun to gather on the base of his abdomen.
“Please give it up for our voluntary performances tonight,” a voice sounded from somewhere, cutting Draco off from his rant. “First we have Harry Potter, along with the House Elves of Hogwarts.”
“Potter-Malfoy, isn’t it?” Harry laughed, earning an affectionate kiss on the cheek from Draco. “But please, call me Harry instead. We are family now, after all.”
“You’re a wizard, Potter,” His fiance rolled his eyes. “Just send them a quick patronus.”
He wanted to be happy for his friend, but he still couldn’t help the sick feeling in his gut. He’ll ask Hermione about it, that’s for sure. He thought back to their near-kiss before sleep finally took over him, though, and promised himself one thing.
Thankfully, the night was tame. What Draco meant was really cuddling in bed, much to the surprise of Harry. He even complied to using Harry’s room instead of his own. All very convenient, even if it did mean Harry had to lend one of his shirts to Draco for him to sleep it.
“Why are you here anyway?” Harry realized. Draco didn’t like stepping into the Ministry if he could avoid it. “You didn’t come all this way to trade deals like that, did you?”
“Your jokes get worse with age,” Albus sighed, earning a nod of agreement from Scorpius. “You wish you aged like fine wine.”
A small fluff of fuzz gathered on his pale hand and he took a pinch of them, taking about half, and blew it in Harry’s direction. Suddenly, Harry felt as if something was tickling his insides and let out a sudden laugh before abruptly stopping himself, the tickling sensation fading.
“That was disgusting,” Zabini sighed once more, this time dropping his head onto the table. That, Harry didn't quite share his opinion with, although perhaps he should have.
“No, Potter,” Pansy squealed, whacking him away from the door with a rolled piece of parchment. “It’s bad luck, you know.”
“I wouldn’t marry someone for a game. For just a game and speaking of,” he said, taking something out of his back pocket. “You never gave me an answer.”
Harry choked on his waffle. Merlin, he really
“Are you sure you should even bother going?” Harry asked worriedly. He looked out the window and saw that it was still kind of flurring outside. “It might get really cold later on, especially knowing how long her parties could go on for.”
, Potter.” And he had the right to brag, Harry supposed, especially since one of the dares he competed consisted of Owling his mother a letter written by everyone else, no limits. And Harry knew it was bad since he contributed, writing to make it look like Malfoy found Firenze attractive and if she knew anything about Human x Centaur relationships.
And with that, he Disapperated with a pop, leaving Harry and Draco to stand alone together in the dark.
“Alright, alright,” Harry laughed, feeling lighter and optimistic than he did earlier. “Goodnight, Hermione.”
“Ha ha, you’re so hilarious,” he deadpanned, looking at her like it was the worst idea she’s ever thought of. And to think, she was supposed to be the one that had good ideas. It’s a sign that there’s no hope for Harry.
“What do you mean by that?” Hermione asked, looking both curious and doubtful while resolutely ignoring the outraged expression her boyfriend wore.
Ron gave him a look, so he continued. “I mean, first of all, she’s your girlfriend.” The redhead scoffed. “And I think we should at least give him a chance. I mean, everyone seems to be pretty defensive of him. He might be alright.”
“Time’s up!” Hermione yelled, blowing her whistle.
“You do?” Draco asked, his voice quiet.
“Right…” No, Harry would much rather think about just Draco. “So, we should get going.”
“What kind of subscription did you opt for?”
Well, she had a point there, he supposed. “I’m afraid we are not quite fit to be sending off students from our own school this year, however,” this elicited many disappointed groans from the students. Harry wasn’t feeling particularly put out, though, because the only reason he came back was to finally enjoy a year at Hogwarts without attempted murder.
All words and possible coherent apologies blanked out of his mind the moment those gray eyes met his, making him unconsciously hold his breath.
"Oh ha ha," He heard Draco's voice say dryly from somewhere behind him. "You caught me. The Dark Lord stood no chance to this swarm of children."
Once he was sure his boss was out of earshot, he let out a groan and thumped his head on his desk before mentally pulling himself together.
“Gear up Arthur! I’ve just figured out how to work the thing,” Draco called out, making his way into the house.
“Right, well,” Harry mumbled, suddenly nervous. He was starting to remember why he didn’t want to do this. “I just wanted to say sorry. For treating you like shit. Yeah.”
“Because it’s made of plastic,” he explained. The rest were actual chocolate or sugar candies molded into eggs, wrapped in tin and light charms to keep them clean.
Unable to help himself, Draco let out a small giggle, prompting Harry to look up at him with amusement shining in his eyes.
It took a while, and Harry would admit that he dozed off for most of the Sortings of the other years, but it wasn’t as long as the regular sortings they had at the beginning of each school year. Eventually, they reached the 8th Years, and Harry perked up considerably.
“In case you have any thoughts of moving in for your final year,” Professor Flitwick joked. The poor 6th Year looked extremely awkward up there, but took it in stride. They simply laughed and responded with a
“Sure,” Ron laughed, standing up. “Let’s go eat dinner before we run out of Roast. Hermione, I was thinking for our first games night we could-“
Shaking his head, Harry pulled himself off the bed. He didn’t want to assume and get his hopes up over nothing. Instead, he made his way to the kitchen and began setting up their breakfast as he’d been doing for the past few weeks.
“Because your ferret is busy with Neville and you want to prove to everyone that you became an Auror on your own merits?” Ron guessed sarcastically, dragging him down the stairs.
“Right,” he said, taking a deep breath. “My name is Draco Malfoy-”
“And their partner is…. Neville Longbottom!” the Hat announced just moments after. Neville immediately stood up and smiled, ready to greet his partner for the next 5 or so months. He was one of the lucky ones, being assigned to someone in the same house while there were a fair few others who were in different houses.
The made their way to Madam Puddifoot’s and ordered cocoa along with some sweets.
Harry felt his cheeks warm at what Draco said before standing, resisting the urge to physically drag Draco to the bathroom as well. “Just get dressed for work. I’ll be in your kitchen.”
Harry had no doubt that he would, and he supposed that if, hypothetically, he managed to pull himself together only to be cockblocked by Blaise Zabini, he may just have a body to hide, and the poor, unfortunate soul that would be lucky enough to find it would have quite the present to unwrap for the holidays.
“Oh!” Draco gasped, caving his back off the mattress. “Fuck, there, please.”
--------------------------------------------------
we’re expected to be in the office in about five minutes,” Harry repeated a little louder. This seemed to finally get the other man’s attention, because his head snapped up to look at him with wide eyes.
He was clutching his elbow and muttering to himself, swaying slightly as he walked - not unlike a drunk person - and sat himself down on one of the kitchen chairs, dropping his head in his arms.
Draco’s attention was focused on the way Harry’s hands moved over his body, one hand rested on his hip while circling the pad of his thumb over the sensitive skin there while his other hand rested just above his chest.
Hermione was mad at them.
“That you can deep-throat a banana?” Parkinson scrunched up her nose. Harry was not appreciating where this conversation was taking, but the slight tightness in his pants seemed to think otherwise.
“I love you too. Happy New Year.”
“Mate, maybe you were right and we do know him,” Ron whispered, having noticed the man that was approaching them as well.
Once they were both in the safety of their office, Harry turned to Draco with an eyebrow raised.
Idly, Harry wondered if he could convince the Headmistress into moving their tables next to each other but then soon remembered that not everyone would be like them, and House rivalries could come back in full strength in a few years. What a shame, it was. Now that he’s been given the chance to get to know them, Gryffindors and Slytherins could wreak great havoc in the school together.
She smiled back and opened her mouth to say something else but a pair of arms wrapping around him made her cut off.
“I’m only tolerating this because you just got married, but any more of this Hufflepuff shite and I will bite you,” Pansy said good-naturedly.
‘Catch,’ Weasley said as a green apple flew across the room and into his waiting hand. ‘I know they’re your favourite. I heard it from a… friend.’
about Harry Potter.
He sighed, raising to his feet, it looked like he was going to deal with two children today. As he made his way towards the door Pansy called out, ‘say hi to Scorpius for me,’ he shot her a warning glare, before turning back to the door.
Pansy sighed, as her lips curved into a soft smile, ‘I guess it’s always been Potter, hasn’t it?’ she relined her back into the couch as she said, ‘who would’ve thought that the spits and spats were nothing but foreplay?’
he was talking to Draco as if they were civil, he was going to go ahead and
Potter narrowed his eyes. ‘And who do you
The picture had turned into one of him and Potter holding hands and smiling, it mirrored ever other picture that Draco had drawn up until he was eleven.
‘I told you that?’ he choked out in disbelief, and the boy nodded.
‘No.’
Agitated, he ran a hand through what he assumed was messy hair, he hadn’t the chance to give himself a one over in the mirror. ‘Damn it Scorpius,’ he yelled and Scorpius flinched, ‘I’m the adult here, not you. You’re the child and that means you listen to me, and I say that we’re going to the Slytherin table, end of argument.’
As Potter rubbed his arm, Draco couldn’t help but smile, seeing Potter in pain just did things to him.
, you’re going, I’ve brought reinforcements,’ she gestured to the heap of what appeared to be muggle clothing resting in her grasp.
‘No.’
Weasley nodded, stuffing yet another sausage into his gob, ‘think about it Ferret, who do you
Draco crossed his arms firmly across his chest, ‘because I don’t want you there,’ he answered simply.
‘Shut up Granger,’ Draco spat at the same time Potter said, ‘not now Hermione.’
‘Daddy?’ he questioned intently.
Keeping silent for the majority of the journey was a bigger challenged than he’d expected it to be, this was primarily due to the fact that Potter breathed like an ogre.
Draco shook his head. Last time he’d checked little kids were
Even worse, Draco and Scorpius had been spotted by at least several students, and he was certain that the news of their predicament would be widely known come tomorrow morning. Ignoring their stares and glares, he had brought Scorpius back to the Slytherin common room, only to be bombarded with yet more stares and questions.
When he was just about done, Scorpius stuck his fork into a particularly large piece of egg before shooting Draco a gleeful look, ‘I always win,’ he chirped as he brought the fork to his mouth.
She scowled, a dangerously cheery edge to her tone, ‘Stop acting like such a baby. It’s
‘I don’t give a rats arse what he
‘We’re not going to Hogsmeade.’ Potter put out a hand to halt him.
Weasley gave him what Draco thought was a smirk. He couldn’t much tell. It looked ghastly. ‘You helped me hide the evidence,’ he told him intently, before shaking his head. ‘And you made a sandwich the muggle way.’
Draco nodded absently, it not escaping his notice that many of the other eighth years were looking in their direction. He couldn’t blame them; they
is not
‘Why in Merlin’s name would you do that?’ he asked the child furiously.
‘That is a boy,’ Draco snapped to his friend, ‘and he doesn’t do too well with shouting, so kindly shut up.’ He glanced down at Scorpius who had started sobbing into his robes, something about the scene angered him profusely, ‘I won’t have you being a bitch to him – he’s a four-year-old kid for fucks sake, have a heart.’
‘ENOUGH!’ A stern voice echoed through the hall.
‘You’re
Both boys crossed their arms defiantly, refusing to look at one another.
She sent him a small smile, ‘Malfoy,’ she returned before snuggling deeper into Weasley’s warmth. ‘This one tells me that you helped him cover up a chicken crime.’
Potter’s eyes widened as he arched a disbelieving brow, ‘how the
Tomorrow he’d be attending a party. He hadn’t been to one of those since the war had ended. The Slytherin’s used to pull off huge blockbusters every Saturday, they still did as far as he knew. He’d always attend, he’d been the life of the party. Giggling, laughing drunkenly, kissing anything that moved. That used to be his life.
Potter was here. He decided to ignore the annoying fluttering that threatened to burst.
A loud clatter stopped him in his tracks as he set the knife down with a clank. He watched in delight as Weasley sauntered over to the sink and pulled out a paper towel. Then proceeding to scrub off all evidence that linked him to the scene of the crime.
He pulled back from the boy in a haste, ‘I’m not your Papa,’ he told him distastefully.

‘Don’t be so
You had
child Malfoy,’ he bit right back.
Draco recoiled from his touch, mentally reminding himself to put spiders in the gits bed later. He was more terrified of the nasty creatures than Ronald bloody Weasley, and
The Great Hall was silent except from the large steps he was taking towards the disgruntled pair. Each step felt like one closer to death, and he was very aware of
‘The point is somewhere, somehow, you have a child with Potter, and instead of spending every breathing moment catering to him, as you should, you’re here renouncing all parental rights,’ she told him sternly, and he felt a boy once more.
Even getting to the Great Hall had been a challenge in itself. Scorpius had been nothing short of ballistic when he’d awoken without Potter by his side, apparently his favouritism of Draco had been conditional. A river of tears, shouts, and sweets later, and he’d finally distracted the boy long enough to get them down to breakfast.
‘And where might that be?’
A small nod allowed him to let go of the last and final breath he had been holding. Potter raked a hand through his locks, and Draco noticed that they were much shinier than he’d deemed them to be.
Once the words had left his mouth, he felt nothing but a shame. Forced to retort to nothing but apologies, to a Weasley nonetheless, by Granger and a four-year-old child. It had only been a day and he hardly recognised himself.
Scorpius was now currently face down into Draco’s robes, his small legs wrapped possessively round his hips.

‘And where the

Tracing the edges of his forearm nervously, his fingers grazing over the snake, he went about cutting through the crowd Pansy in tow, hoping for a glimpse of Potter.
‘Papa, Daddy,’ Scorpius cried out but both boys were far to gone to pay him any attention.
He lent in closer, ‘You have fans. Not so much different to minions.’
‘No?’ Draco repeated with a touch of anger, and Scorpius nodded. ‘Let’s not do this again Scorpius. Eat your damn food.’
Draco opened his mouth to speak but was cut of with a howl, ‘If yu awe mad at me, becose I touched your powtion, den m’ sowwy!’
He and Potter would never click, and that was just fine. He’d come into this world alone; he’d exit it just the same.
It was no surprise that Potter had been the one to teach Scorpius such disgusting manners, for a Malfoy trait it was not. Without so much as a second glance, Draco took hold of Scorpius’ waist lifting them both from the ground so that the child sat comfortably on his hip.

He shrugged, ‘well it’s a shame that we can’t all be gracious Gryffindor’s,’ he spat out unkindly.

‘Hey!’ Draco tried to pry Scorpius chubby fingers from his robes but was unsuccessful.
Begrudgingly, Draco lowered his head once more and ignored the rage monster that threatened to explode. He whispered the words so quietly that no one but Scorpius and himself could hear. ‘I love your Daddy very much,’ he said as authentically as he could.
Jumping, Draco looked down. A little boy was tugging on his robes, thumb still glued to his mouth. He stared up at Draco, his grey-blue eyes wide, his messy black curls sprawled atop of his head. Draco never realised how beautiful blue eyes were until they were looking up at him with that burning curiosity that every child possess.
?!’ Weasley spluttered. ‘Are you kidding? He’s always been the meanie, not me!’
‘Fuck off.’
He was fooling himself, wasn’t he? Even
Sweets!
Draco shook his head, fighting the overwhelming urge to run and never look back, ‘Malfoy’s aren’t cut out to be father’s, just look at mine,’ he whimpered out solemnly.
‘Malfoy?’ Weasley asked.
Still, maybe a small part of him hated to see the boy so distressed. His eyes were puffy, and his chubby cheeks were stained. It wasn’t a happy sight. He pushed that feeling deep down as he entered the Great Hall.
He stood up, extending a hand for Scorpius to take. To his disappointment but not surprise, the child swatted his hand away, sticking his tongue out angrily. Once again, Draco fell to his knees, so that he was eye level with the little menace.
Draco felt his face heat up and Weasley’s eyes widened, as he quickly put a hand to Granger’s mouth. ‘Shhhh,’ he whispered frantically, his eyes darting around the room, ‘someone could be

They stood in an uncomfortable silence for several minutes before Potter spoke, ‘do you like cereal Malfoy?’ he asked eagerly
Winter is melancholic for many, the trees once full lay bare, the creatures of earth deep in hibernation. Everything’s dead.
Granger shrugged, ‘I’m not too sure. He normally walks around a bit before coming, I like to imagine that he’s thinking about homework, but with Harry you can never be too certain.’ She told them.

‘If you put your clothes on, then I’ll buy you some sweets on Saturday,’ he promised, and the boy clapped his hands manically.
GUT YOU!’
Draco could do nothing but squeeze his eyes tight and pray that no one had noticed. That it would all be over soon.
‘But I don’t wanna,’ Scorpius yawned again, and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
‘McGonagall?’ Draco echoed when he finally found his voice. Fawkes squawked in understanding as the left the room in a dramatic, fiery swoop which Draco suspected was for Scorpius’ entertainment.
Moments later, he heard the door open once more. Blaise leaned against the doorframe, an unreadable look dusting his features.
Another reason why this child couldn’t possibly be a Malfoy, caving at the mention of sweets, it was unthinkable. No, why ask his father for a few sweets when he could ask for money to buy a bazillion sweets? This kid was child’s play compared to what he’d been like as a child.
Potter sighed, pointing an accusing finger at Draco, ‘he started it,’
Comments and Kudos are always appreciated.
Draco took a deep breath, gently brushing a stubborn curl from Potter’s face as his thumb traced over his scar delicately. To many the scar represented victory and power, for Draco it symbolised all things Potter. Everything that was

‘Wrong answer.’ Potter stated.
Scorpius looked as if he was considering before he broke out into a broad smile, showing them the ring proudly. ‘Papa says tha’ only a vewy special pewson can wear this ring,’ he beamed shaking his hand happily.

‘That’s quite right, I’m certain that she’d want to be aware of your… predicament,’ he said amusedly, his blue eyes twinkling.
‘Papa?’ Scorpius tugged on his sleeve.

had treated Potter terribly for years.
‘Stop that.’ Draco snapped, yanking his robes out of the boy’s small hand. His eyes almost immediately widened and welled up, tears glistening as his lower lip began to tremble. Draco winced – perhaps that was a harsh tone to use with a little kid, even for a Malfoy.
‘Yes.’ He answered simply.
‘I love your Daddy.’ He spat the words out and began to lift his head back when a tiny hand caught his.

Dumbledore carried on, ‘of course, the necessary amendments will be made, but I’m sure that Scorpius will benefit greatly from the change.’
I'm afraid that I'd be classed as a sociopath if we're going by Harry's definition. Next chapter: drinking, games, wrackspurts, and... a dare?
Weasley looked fearfully at the paper towel before shooting Draco a somewhat thankful nod. He shrugged before making his way towards the door, when a low cough stopped him in his tracks.

He thought of Pansy. She was probably still with Weasley and Granger laughing about his affection for Potter. ‘He’s a lost cause,’ Pansy would say and they’d both nod in agreement. ‘The git never stood a chance,’ Weasley would tell them and Granger would admit that she’d lied, and Potter wasn’t out thinking about homework. ‘He’s fucking Smith as we speak, has been for weeks,’ she would say and they’d all chuckle and smile.
He huffed in exasperation, ‘that’s not what you were saying a few moments ago,’
There in the centre of the common room was Scorpius, wailing as if someone had taken away his favourite toy. Granger and Weasley sat next to him doing their best to calm the boy down but to no avail. To Draco’s displeasure, a hoard of nameless Gryffindor’s stood crowded around them, some intrigued, many cooing, a few looking distastefully at the child. Draco wanted to gut those small few.
