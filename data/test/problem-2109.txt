Narcissa sat down on one bench, prompting Andromeda to hesitantly sit down on the other end of the aisle. The two sat silent for a few minutes before Andromeda chuckled to hide her confusion over the likely heavy and emotional conversation which they were about to engage in.
Ginny wasn’t blind to the fact that brothers could and did fight. She had never believed that the two of them would walk the same path throughout life, even if she was convinced that the both of them had thought that they could. Nonetheless, Ginny felt somewhat guilty about the fact that she hadn’t really paid attention to Fred and George, even if she had noticed that they appeared to be drifting apart. She was rather busy with her own efforts in playing Quidditch and managing her fist relationship, which had recently come to a rather hasty halt.
Teddy and Hermione placed their work aside and joined them on the sofas, both of their attention on Ron. Luna scooted to the side to allow Teddy to sit in the middle.
The announcer excitedly yelled out as Ginny caught her second golden snitch, somewhere on the other end of the playing field. Draco didn’t appear to have heard anything. He had come to hover above the goal post, only now appearing to realise that his favorite sport was happening around him. Harry thought he could see Draco blink as the Slytherin team came crashing by Ron, and another goal was scored by the Slytherin captain Parkinson.
The mouth of the cave is closer now, and the chatter and nervous noise of the Aurors and the miscellaneous mages and reporters fades as the earth claims me by my own free choice.
The inhabitants of the Room were currently Harry, Draco, Hermione, Teddy, Ron and George, who was taking a study break for the moment. Ginny and Luna were likely together somewhere outside, working on becoming friends while Colin was spending his time developing his photographs. The low number of people was likely a factor which enabled Neville to speak up at last, something which they had all suspected that he needed.
Teddy could not recall the event or even the violence properly, but he told his best friend that he remembered the screaming. Whenever he was close to dementors and was forced to relive those terrible memories, he heard his mother scream. It was followed by a fall, a crack, and silence. Terrifying, empty, violent silence.
See, Filling up mostly empty shelves up helped his home to feel a little more personal, a little more his own, even if part of him felt like he was wasting money. It felt good to spend it, however, a cheap rush and distraction that he would make certain wouldn’t overtake him far too much.
“Which one would you think I meant?” the Headmaster mused with a smile on his lips as he offered Harry his arm.
, which the older man had grabbed from the Black library. It was fascinating for the teenager to watch Sirius work. Harry was yet again reminded of the fact that the other was a genius, as he drew the ritual sigil upon the door, almost entirely from memory.
“You dingus!” Teddy laughed as he lightly tapped Ron’s head with his fist before more or less flopping over him in a hug. “You scared us half to death,” the following words were mumbled into his shoulder as Teddy clung to him.
The two mages smiled at one another, both of them feeling as if they could breathe for the first time in years.
Harry considered asking about his grandmother, but he did not. He was already emotionally drained from the funeral as well as crying, and he did not need to experience more confused feelings in regards to family than he was already feeling. Thus, he bowed politely and turned away from the gathering, smiled at his dad and Severus, before he hurried over to his group of friends who were waiting for him by the church.
George sighed and turned the closest one over to show to his twin. “I was thinking of studying after Hogwarts. I might have to work for a while to save up the money, but… I think I might want to study some stray courses and find… Well, what it is I want to do.”
George had known that she wouldn’t be, but he didn’t let her disapproval deter him. “A little, probably. Bill will be with me, it's not like it’s going to be a problem. He’s not trying to get me drunk or anything like that. We’re mostly going for the music.” It wasn’t that George needed to excuse himself in that he wanted to go drink with his older brother, but he decided to calm his mum’s worries by being honest.
A teasing of a light danced by the black firewood, which then burst into flames, lighting up the room as something came through.
“No, he was doing better and everything, and the hovering wheelchair is his favorite thing like, ever. However well, Umbridge is taking over and evidently doesn't want him at Hogwarts, and it's already uncomfortable and risky.” He shrugged as he pushed some of his hair behind his ear. “I think that when it all came down to it, he had better options closer by which didn’t come with the extended danger of being petrified on his way to being a creep.” Colin’s cheeks heated as he evidently recalled his reason for going to the hospital ward about two and a half years ago. “I’m really sorry about that, by the way,” Colin’s apology was aimed at Harry. “I kind of think that it was almost fair that the giant snake got to me. Sort of divine intervention, kind of.”
Al considered it before he answered, “I can’t remember it being moved, stolen, or owned by somebody else. It should still be here at Hogwarts.”
“What is that…?” Someone whispered as the group slowly began to gather and the full theater was lit up by their wands.
“Oh thank you,” Harry stood up with a helpful push from Colin. He crossed the room to take the vial from her. “Did you already enforce it with magic?”
Penelope Clearwater had been Percy’s girlfriend since school, and they had stuck together afterwards. Percy had considered proposing to her, but then the world simply misaligned itself, and there was never time to even consider buying a ring, much less propose. Then Penny had decided that enough was enough when she could no longer believe in Percy’s explanations and excuses in regards to the actions of the Ministry of Magic.
“It… it was,” Quirrell concluded. “I was seventeen… At the time. Seventeen at the time. Being targeted by… by first years… It was hu… hum… humi…”
“My dear boy, I understand that it isn’t fair that you should be without someone like me, but I’m retired for… personal reasons.” In most people’s cases, ‘personal reasons’ referred to something they weren’t comfortable talking about yet. In Slughorn’s case, ‘personal reasons’ meant ‘no reason but because I wanted to.’
When I finally manage to breathe properly once more, I crawl up to sit by the table, gasping slightly still. The tea is not cold, but it is no longer warm as I raise the cup to my lips. The honey and chamomile fill my mouth, calming my nerves as much as they can be calmed. Tom is sitting opposite of me, looking at me while the newspaper is resting between us, broken, crumbled and sweaty.
Neville looked towards his best friend, his expression changing into a gentle and kind one, one which was at least partly filled with love. Harry wondered if it was simply love between friends, or if Neville felt more for Hermione than he had told anyone. Since Neville was only interested in women, it wasn’t impossible to think that he could have been infected by the love bug as well, and fallen in love with his best friend.
“Do know that if the memories become too much for you, you cannot be forced to continue should you wish to cease the sessions.” Severus reminded Harry as he gazed into the darkness of the woods which they were currently walking alongside.
To Harry’s surprise and excitement, he saw a small smile pass over Severus’ lips before he raised his head to look at Harry. “Your happiness is highly appreciated. I have to comment that it still feels somewhat unreal, albeit that the arrangement brings me joy.” Severus’ fingers reached for his necklace as he spoke, bringing yet another small and fleeting smile to his lips.
It was odd how good it felt to see his brother make an expression of unfiltered awe and jealousy. Further, it felt odd because George knew that it was alright, because they were not the same person and they wouldn’t always have the same thing or experiences. Just as Fred spoke about his time with Angelina, so could George speak about Padfoot and Hex-mas.
“Hello, my favorite Professor,” the tall blonde woman with pale skin and glasses had told Remus as she approached him.
Arthur had never been one for cooking, even if he had found bacon, he wasn’t sure that he would have known how to make it like Molly did. Somehow, that also became Molly’s fault for not saving food for him like she always did. After all, how could she not have thought of the fact that he would definitely need a snack before going to Malfoy Manor and therefore return to the Burrow instead of going directly to the place as agreed?
“If you harm him, or attempt to take him away, I will stop you with force.” The Healer threatened him through clenched teeth. “You’ve already taken my husband. I have nothing left to lose. Enjoy your talk.” The last words were not spoken out of care, but were a curse upon him, should he think of overstepping his jurisdictions.
The look on Albus’ face when he saw the small vial with the memory was an honest one. He gaped weakly, before he blinked and attempted to and failed to properly collect himself. He swallowed before he reached a slightly trembling hand towards the just un-wrapped vial, allowing the small object to rest in his old and veiny hand as if it was the most precious of items. He raised his head towards Professor Slughorn, who appeared every bit as unsure, if not more, than he just had. The Potions Professor fumbled with his hands, his sleeves, anything which he could access, and then averted both gaze and head from Albus thankful expression.
“If you want, we can head over to the altar and sit down?” Victor suggested, likely not hearing what Ron had said at all. “House is stuffy, and loud.” He pointed towards his damaged ear when mentioning the loundness, signally that all the noises made it a little hard for him to hear. He was correct in that the air in the Burrow was not the most pleasant since the cooking and the heat of summer was starting to get to the upper levels of the house. It was the prize they paid for the clear blue summer sky outside.
The Lupin household had slowly come to terms with their situation as they hid from the world in their safe house. They had spoken to the Weasleys, and they were aware that the Order of the Phoenix was being re-established, but they didn’t really have anything to do with it. Remus wasn’t willing to return to the Order since he had Harry, who he of course didn’t have all those years ago. Neither was Severus especially involved, since he had not returned to his duties as a spy. Sirius wanted to join, but he was practically useless to the Order in his current state, as his human face was that of a mass murderer to the public, and his animal shape was known by the Death Eaters through Peter Pettigrew’s testimony. There was nothing he could do, and he was rather locked to his old family home.
“How about just chocolate then? You could probably get some raisings by the side to try it out if you’d like.” I offer him my hand and we walk back downstairs together.
Remus could feel that he was sweating, his hand was grabbing where he had been bitten all those years ago. He could feel the wound upon his body, as if it had just been made. He could feel the eyes of the beast upon him, could hear his own scream, and he heard the shattering of the window when the beast fled back the way which it had come. His breathing left him in shallow, shaking breaths as he tried his utmost to not allow the familiar panic, which always followed the memory, to wash over him so utterly as to drown him in it.
Secrets missed the first throw, but she managed to catch it in her mouth the next time Harry threw the locket. There was a low crush and a quiet sizzling in the air when the venom broke through the small object, quickly disintegrating it almost completely. When the basilisk dropped the object, it clattered harmlessly to the ground, still hissing softly as the venom continued to attack the surface of what was left. It was doubtless utterly destroyed, and anything which might have been within it, be it physical or magical, was destroyed as well.
“Only time can tell, I am afraid. Yet do not be a stranger to help, it is yours, should you request it.” Firenze smiled softly at Harry.
Unbeknownst to Molly, Ginny would not be the last Weasley child, yet she would be the last one to have been born of Molly and Arthur.
Hysteria erupted in the Great Hall, and with it came magic. Violence broke out between some students, but most would refrain from shouting and pointing in favor of whispering, yet that also triggered reactions in others. Everyone were stressed and scared, people were far too aware that they were on the verge of war within society and risk at losing their family, friends, and basic human rights. It had festered. Just like the Ministry, they wanted to attack before they could be attacked.
Percy swallowed back his own tears as he hugged his mum and was then seized up by her as if they had been apart for ten years, and not just one. She was not launching into any of the speeches or complaints which Percy had expected of her. She wasn't trying to blame him or make him feel guilty for having been gone, or made her miss him. She was only honestly happy to see him.
Harry focused on the other man with a direct, confused look upon his face. He felt slightly more aggressive than he meant to be as he spoke up, “and why not?”
“You start with putting your wand away.” Harry’s dogfather waved his wand away. “This is internal magic only. So what happens is this: you are about to perform an advanced transfiguration which applies to all of your body at once, shaping it into something else. I can do it easily, of course, but when I started, it could take me up to three tries to actually transform all the way. Once, I had a human arm, that caused some arm-larm.” He laughed at the memory. “Good times, either way. The first and hardest part is figuring out what animal you will be transforming into. The first time, you pretty much cast the magic and try to achieve a vague goal; you don’t really have a vision. It gets easier with time as you know what to expect from the spell, in other words, you know what result you are trying to achieve.”
Harry licked his lips, then slowly nodded, turning to face her. Chang let go of his arm and grabbed onto the strap of her bag instead, which she clung to as if it was the only thing keeping her upright. Her fingernails were broken, chewed down upon until there was nothing white left on them. Harry could see that two of her fingers had plasters on them, which led him to believe that she might have accidentally hurt herself. However, her nails shifted colors in a slow manner, telling Harry that she was using the Weasley twins’ Rainbow Nails product.
“Do you believe that there are actually two horcruxes in the school?” Hermione gathered herself first and spoke up, looking between the men before her, both young and old.
When she one day became the Minister of Magic, Hermione reasoned, Umbridge would know just how wrong she had been about Hermione’s abilities.
Goyle shrugged as uncertainty crept up upon his face. “I wouldn’t know what you should do, I can only comment on what I think would be the best choice for you. That doesn’t mean it is universally right or anything. However, if you break up with him, make sure that you do it in a somewhat public manner where you can be safe around more people. He… I don’t want to say this, but I’m worried that he might be very upset due to the trauma of what happened with his mum.”
Pat wondered if he was mad. Surely he had to be angry, but he shouldn’t have figured out that Pat did what she had done for the sake of allowing Lupin and Draco the possibility to speak to one another. After all, Goyle had done the same thing, following her lead to assist the two, so logically it shouldn’t only be her fault. Pat nervously chewed on her inner cheek, hoping that none of her friends would turn and look at her. Ngo-Kwang was definitely right to conclude that she was scared of Vince. Perhaps ‘scared’ was even too small of a word.
Harry had been struggling a lot the past month. He had recovered from his blood loss, and his wound had been looked over by Severus Snape, who not only was a Potion Master, but educated in first mage aid. Severus had offered to try and remove the ugly scar completely from Harry’s arm, but Harry had declined the offer. At first, Remus had thought that he was because his son was secretly punishing himself for being unable to stop the resurrection of the Dark Lord, and the murder of Cedric Diggory. When he brought this worry up to Sirius, his old friend sternly reminded Remus of the fact that the werewolf was covered in scars, and that he had thus taught his son to not be ashamed of being scarred just by being a positive example. That had made Remus very emotional, as he still struggled with the idea that he could be a positive example for anything, despite all the knowledge he had to the contrary.
“But… but the Malfoys…” Remus objected, thinking about Narcissa Malfoy and the friend he had found in the rather lonely woman.
Harry loved Draco with such an ache that he wondered if one might go mad with the feeling. Feelings were truly maddeningly powerful, no matter human sense and logic.
Bellatrix barked an order at the animagus who had just stepped inside the parlour with a tray of biscuits for the Death Eater after they, well, ate all of the previous ones. She threw her shoe at him shortly after, which Pettigrew barely managed to avoid without dropping the tray or the biscuits. He had rather good reflexes and was becoming used to her assaults.
At least, he knew for certain that 'Peter' could be the friend and strong person who he had always longed for in his past, who he had searched for and never found in Sirius, who he had always dreamed would save him from his torment, and make his life less miserable.
“That’s a relief,” she mumbled in response. It wasn't that much of a relief given the fact that Goyle hadn't ensured her that Vince wouldn't, but rather that he would be stopped.
“Found it.” When Colin stood up, he was holding onto a clean, blue shoebox whose origins had been lost to time and Harry’s memory.
“So for simplicity’s sake, let me summarise,” Ron said. “Draco is in danger from us interacting with him, so we have to stay away. Harry is also in danger in his dormitory, so he has to stay in a hidden room somewhere at Hogwarts. Also Harry has to be Potter from now on, which is just plain weird but, I get it. At least I think I do. Further, Slughorn potentially possesses a memory which Dumbledore needs to defeat You-know-who and Slughorn will do anything to help talented students. Thus, if Harry becomes a talented student in Potions, he can get close enough to Slughorn to make him give up the unaltered memory. Or well, let people try to restore the memory since we don’t know if he himself tampered with it. To achieve the last thing, Professor Snape gave you that old Potions book to help you prepare so that you can become an outstanding student?”
“What if she just fires everyone and replaces them with Ministry tools like Percy?” Ron still wasn’t convinced that the Education Inspector was truly someone worth trusting. Neither did he have a very high opinion of his older brother at this point. “What if she fires them for no real reason but just because she doesn’t like them?”
Al focused on Harry before nodding. “He was the same type of snake as his pet Nagini. That is the snake which he mentioned in the memory. Why do you ask?” It was not alarm which colored his final statement, but careful caution.
Bill had never felt happier than he did at this moment. His body might be aching and his face might hurt slightly from the continuous smiling, due to his freshly scarred face. Yet he couldn’t think of anywhere he’d rather be than with Fleur, together under the sun, moon and stars until time parted them.
“Cute,” Draco commented, most evidently amused by their open and honest excitement from their, not too great but still wonderful, kiss. Harry could tell that he had enjoyed the display personally as well.
Neville felt his heart beat hastily in his chest as he actually took a stand against Professor Slughorn, rather than blindly agree with him for the sake of his own goals. To his great surprise and relief, Professor Slughorn appeared embarrassed by his own words, rather than upset with Neville. That was good, that proved the man could handle some manner of criticism without becoming aggressive or defensive.
“Are they beginning to gather yet? For the ceremony, I mean.” Neville asked politely from behind Hermione. The question was addressed to Victor.
, but I just realised that Professor Lupin must have the curriculum for all the years from back when he was teaching. If you could just ask for a copy of that, Harry, then we can self study with a guide, rather than simply reading aimlessly.”
“Indeed…” Draco followed up. “Unless you find a way to handle the troll without anyone knowing, which you couldn’t possibly since you are but a bureaucrat, then you will have committed the same mistake as Dumbledore. Everyone will know it.”
“Malinda, you take care of the blonde,” the woman pointed at her assistant nurse. “Weasley has definitely broken his leg… Again. I’ll come join you as I’ve set this right. The lot of you, back off and stand aside! If you won’t get out of my hospital ward then at least stay silent!”
Harry straightened up, moved his shoulders back, and smiled politely as he kept good posture. He modelled himself after Lucius Malfoy as well as Narcissa Malfoy, both of whom were the most elegant and collected people he personally knew. One needed to remain cautiously attentive but not immediately approachable to be a Pureblood aristocrat. However, as he was not attempting to be unapproachable, Harry adapted humbleness into himself, and a slight curiosity to his body language. He wasn’t certain if he managed what he attempted to do, but Slughorn looked at him with passive disinterest before he spotted what most people spotted when looking at Harry, namely his pale scar.
“I don’t know…” Pat whispered into her knees. “I don’t know. He has done so much for me, and we’ve been dating for years by now. I think I love him still, but whenever we are together, I don’t feel like he is seeing me. I just feel like some doll for him to squeeze and it’s never about me, or even us, just him. I know that he is doing something impossibly dangerous, and the least I should do is support him. He’s even denying other people a relationship with him for my sake, but I’m still not satisfied with just being physical. He used to do so much for my mind, and now I feel like just a body for him.”
They were both allowed entry, much to their shared displeasure, and thus stepped inside. Everything appeared mostly the same as it had last year, with the rose scent covering the room like a thick doily. Most of the furniture was placed in the same place, only that there were currently two desks in front of the office desk. Harry noted that something appeared different by the fireplace. It had been cleaned and a pink rug had been placed before it, while a new jar fought for dominance amongst the animal pictures. Upon it, Floo Powder was noted in Umbridge’s handwriting. The magical powder was enchanted to allow access to the Floo Powder Network when dropped in an open fireplace connected with the network, and was generally used by mages around the world as a means of travelling from place to place without the need to master complex transportation spells like apparition.
Draco realized he had been staring at Potter’s neck, thinking about what his mother had said in regards to the other man liking him back. When the water was boiling, he stepped up to the other, entered Potter’s personal space, and looked into his eyes. For a while they just stood like that, looking at one another, pale eyes meeting green. Behind them, the water on the stove made a weak noise, Chubby the Unicup was staring into the wall with its unseeing eyes and stupid, happy smile, and Draco Malfoy reached up, placing a finger on Harry Potter’s lips, one that traveled over his face, stroking the man’s hair out of his face.
“I… I’m…” Pat turned toward her actual friend. The witch who was kind, understanding and pleasant to speak to. The person she had fun with, and the person who actually saw her as a friend rather than a subject to rule over. She felt herself tremble worse, her legs threatening to give in.
I shouldn’t have to tell this to Tom, but he was raised on fear mongering and lies. I have to be patient with him. It is not him speaking, it is the cruel lies which his religion has forced into his young and impressionable mind.
Arthur was somewhat startled by how serious the other was when he spoke up again, his gaze was determined yet pained, focused yet without direction as Lucius stared at him. Arthur couldn’t look away, despite wanting to. Whatever was to follow, he was certain that it wasn’t pleasurable.
Ginny was mostly hugging Harry and Teddy more than she was hugging Neville, yet she appeared to have no trouble with that arrangement.
Harry highly doubted that Fang’s nose was that good. Surely, he was a bloodhound, he could smell very well, but five layers of snow seemed excessive to say the least.
“Are you able to hear of the werewolf who turned you? If I am to speak of Pettigrew, I will have to mention him as well,” Severus finally settled on a response.
Of course, Christian based traditions and wedding vows are not a standard and would have been strange in a community not influenced by such tradition to that big a degree. Thus, the traditions remind of regional wedding traditions while also incorporating their own cultural touches.
A few moments later, Harry found himself seated in a living room as the rain smattered down upon the windows from the outside. He was sitting next to Albus on a sofa while the master of the house rested in what was likely his favorite armchair, seeing as it was old and rather tattered. The room was highly busy with objects, plants and a collection of photographs upon every wall.
Bill arrived at the Black estate a little past half past four. He stopped in front of the door and pulled up his left sleeve to look at his tattoo clock. The tattoo consisted of two faces of a clock, placed next to one another down his arm. One which listed all twelve hours, and one which listed the numbers 0, 15, 30, and 45. When he charged the clock with his internal magic, the numbers lit up to show the approximate time. A real clock was too advanced to be replicated upon an arm, but this type of tattoo allowed Bill to always keep a clock with him. Further, it was rebellious enough to make him feel satisfied whenever he looked at the practical tattoo.
With a startle, the boy-who-lived noticed that Al had come to sit by his side on the floor, worriedly gazing down upon him.
“Three months…?” Colin gaped. He had likely been encouraged to speak by the vampire’s earlier approval. “I thought… uh, pardon, but I thought that you had to drink far more often than every third month.”
The Auror next to him threw his cigarette upon the ground, grinded it with his foot and made his way back into the house, concluding without words that Remus was the new guard and he was therefore eligible to leave. Remus thought the man’s name was Mundungus Fletcher, but he wasn’t certain as a collection of mages in the group dressed in similar fashion.
The door shut but opened so quickly that Harry didn’t have time to worry about being dejected about the suddenness of the action. Horace Slughorn appeared in the door, allowing Harry to see him completely.
The expression which crossed Umbridge’s face was the most satisfying thing which Harry had ever seen. Her gaze turned towards Harry’s teacup as doubt and uncertainty passed over her face, which switched swiftly between emotions as she struggled to comprehend what had gone wrong.
However, that did not mean that the animagus wasn’t worth the reward at the risk of disloyalty. The form of the rat was invaluable. It was only due to it that the Death Eater escapees from Azkaban had been granted their wands back, as Pettigrew had stolen them from their old estates, homes and living spaces. They were not the wands which they needed, but it was the only thing which they had at their disposal for the moment, and it would have to do.
Dungeon room 7B, which Harry believed to be an old potions classroom, was remodelled into a luxurious, albeit not impossibly grand dining room. The center was taken up by a table with plenty of food to distract the eye, but which was likely the exact same food as the rest of the school ate. It was simply presented on different, and far shinier, plating. The tablecloth was a dark green, the hue made it hard to identify it as green until one looked upon it from a closer perspective. The scents within the room were generally pleasant. While it was mostly filled with the scent of food, someone had burnt incense to add to a more pleasant aroma around the dungeon room, while a fire burnt in an open fireplace. There was a faint underlying dust to the various scents, but it didn’t so much bother Harry as he simply noticed it.
George was more than excited to learn that the other considered him not only a friend, but a close friend. However, the other man appeared to be a little too nervous for it to be suitable for him to be happy about his new title. Thus, George held his smile back and attempted to remain collected.
Molly squeezed his hand as she sniffed some tears back. “Do you not hate me for not being happy like this?”
“And now you are engaged, well… How lovely!” Slughorn continued to fumble for topics. As he did, his gaze fell on Severus’ necklace. The phases of the moon reflected in his small eyes before realisation hit him. He then looked to Harry, before his attention returned to Severus with newfound excitement.
George Weasley came to spend more time with them in the Room of Requirements. He didn’t speak much to the group, only to Teddy and Ron. He wasn’t unsociable, but didn’t actively engage in conversation. The older student reminded Harry of Sirius when he had been recovering from his time in Azkaban. That was not generally a good thing to remind of, and thus, Harry didn’t actively try to engage with George any more than the other appeared willing to. Harry tried to give him the space he needed to heal, but was ready to speak if the young man was to express a desire to.
They reached the graveyard, and Draco began looking around for his mother right away, trying to spot her. Potter guided him through the cemetery, and in the distance he could see the stature of a well dressed woman, whom was unmistakably his mother. Somewhere next to him, his flowers were removed from his grasp, and the blonde man broke into a run, hurrying over to Narcissa Malfoy. She turned towards him, and he could see her face light up, as she held out her arms, welcoming him into a hug as he reached her. Mother and son embraced, and he could feel the woman starting to cry into his hair, holding him tighter than he could ever recall being held before.
Further, any shortening of her surname became ‘Park’ or ‘son’ and she didn’t feel like she was either of those things. She most certainly did not want to be called ‘son’ when she knew beyond all doubts that she was a woman. Thus, Pansy Parkinson was stuck with a name she hated, and one she couldn’t modify to make herself feel better. It was by complete coincidence that Vince saved her with the name ‘Pat.’ It was similar enough to her name that nobody questioned it, but different enough from all the things she wasn’t comfortable with that the name felt unique to her.
“Are you planning on standing in the corridor all day?” Professor Lupin had finished cleaning and stepped out of the room, closing the door behind him. “I believe that you were planning on having tea in one of the parlours.” The Professor performed a quick headcount. “Is Mr. Longbottom not here yet?”
“First, we are going to do a breathing exercise together. You will breathe in for five seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then let it all out for eight seconds. So that is five, seven, eight.” Luna instructed Hermione.
A flicker of hope passes over his features as his arms move to his sides once more. “You believe me?”
The Dark Lord’s strange face reflected surprise for the seconds that the memory overtook him, but then it settled into an expression of slight disappointment and amusement. He shook his head, as if to state that Severus had been the one to overact while he remained unaffected. Had the mind reader not seen the memory of the violent man who was definitely not Albus, as he neither resembled Albus in silhouette, nor would Albus ever raise his fist against anyone, he would have believed the Dark Lord to not be affected in the least by him hitting his hand away.
The boy-who-lived turned around, and began walking away but he found Chang blocking his path, as she had run around him. She was taller than Harry, and the fact that she was an athlete made it so that he had no chance of overpowering her if he decided to try and push past her.
Harry had to cover his mouth to not laugh, as he found his own initial reaction to be a little rude. He was not entirely certain towards who, either Bill or Dobby, yet he found it better to simply not laugh.
“I’m considering applying for that Disciplinary Committee.” Hermione spoke to the rest of the table as Neville was evidently distracted. “She said that she will give them references to put onto one’s resume. If I want to work with the Ministry, and I do, then that could be a really good reference for me.”
“That was… amazing… Truly.” Remus gave his son a small smile as he listened to his story. “I… lack words. It should be impossible to transform that well during your first time, especially if you expected to become something else. Were you aware of your own mind as a snake, or did you lose yourself to impulses and instincts?”
The term which had just passed had evidently been harsh on Remus’ lover. He could see it in Severus’ eyes, find pain in the creases around his mouth, and smell the exhaustion even when the man said nothing. During the days which had passed since they had come to Malfoy Manor together with Harry and Sirius, Severus had mostly rested. He appeared less haunted today compared to when he had first arrived. It surprised Remus that nobody else had noticed, yet he had done nothing to bring Severus’ exhaustion up, not even when the two were alone. He knew that his partner could hear his worry, but he also knew that Severus would speak up when he was ready.
Neville managed to appear unbothered by his rather unwelcome comments about his parents by focusing on the latter parts about his grandmother. “She is indeed, sir. However, she has been very good to me all my life.”
“I never thought about it like that,” I agree, “but more than anything, they were killing us too with those actions. It wasn’t simply to protect the Muggle women, but to protect us as well. Not to mention, they weren’t only burning and hanging women, but other genders too.”
With another small, soft cough, the woman by the name of Umbridge had yet again stood up, demanding the word by clearing her throat. She stepped around the teachers’ table once more, and joined the Headmaster by the podium. He stepped to the side to allow her to stand in the center of said podium. She took the space with such confidence that it appeared to be her birthright to address the students. For a while, she simply smiled at them all, as if they were all her children, or something which she was very proud of. Harry couldn’t shake the impression that her smile was patronising and her overannounciated kindness was false.
The four of them came to sit in a small circle of chairs, with Al sitting on top of his desk, as he had a habit of doing. He was absentmindedly toying with his necklace as he stared into the open fire and at the cat-creature who was resting in front of it. Crookshanks appeared to pay no attention to Fawkes, yet the phoenix was eying the feline with a stern, distrusting glance. Al had been the last to see the memory, and the one who appeared to struggle the most with his thoughts as he pondered the information.
Professor Slughorn hesitated as he continued to fumble with his chain, staring absently at the tea before him. After some hesitation, he groaned and shook his head. “What I simply don’t understand is why you felt the need to do it to me as well. It would have been one thing if it had been everyone else, but I’m your teacher and benefactor, why would you feel the need to fool me?”
It was not that Molly wasn’t happy when she and Arthur had moved into their own home out on the countryside, where Molly had a little garden to tend to, and plenty of room for both animals and future children. Arthur had managed to secure a job as the head of a Ministry department a few years after, when Molly was pregnant with their very first child. He would go to work in the morning and come home in the afternoon, speaking happily about the important work which he was undertaking in a historically significant department.
“Yeah, right,” Crabbe was deaf to the plea. “You’re as pathetic as a Muggle.” He took a step forward and reached out as if he planned on picking Harry up and physically throwing him out.
So, we read about Dolores Umbridge, and reread the fifth Harry Potter book. Somehow she's this undefined yet too defined blob of everything evil in the universe, and constantly changes motivations to whatever will make her seem more evil and suit the story of the moment, no matter if that completely contradicts her earlier statements or motivations. This on top of having her mannerisms, appearance, and private life mocked, as we have repeatedly seen Rowling do with characters who are supposed to be antagonised.
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice was stern and slightly wounded as she realised that Harry was looking at her with alarm. “I simply want to look at it for myself. You are behaving rather strangely.”
Crabbe was evidently annoyed with them, but he realised that his friends and followers really had better things to do than kick Harry away from Draco’s passed out form. Harry noticed how he sniffed the air as well, and it did not take long before he scrunched his nose.
Tom appears in the kitchen, somewhere behind me. He finds me on the floor, clutching the newspaper close to my chest. It is summer, in my panic, I can hear the sound of the birds singing outside the window of mine and Tom’s house. I bought the house primarily for him, so that Tom would have a home to return to after he has graduated from Hogwarts this term. The house is still odd to us both, especially now that we are allowed to live apart within the same space.
“Now, for your assignment of the evening,” Umbridge moved her wand and gave both of them a piece of parchment, a quill each, and this time, she remembered ink, even if it was still the one smelling of roses. “You are to write an essay each about rules and regulations. I want you both to write why we have laws, and why you both feel like you are entitled to break them at your leisure. Write about why you are so special as to not be required to adhere to the same laws as us normal mortals.”
Albus smiled gently at her before nodding in a calm manner, “it is within my interest to keep them both safe as well. I shall respect their need for safety and not interfere, as you say.”
In the living room, Tom is happily speaking to my parents. He’s confused as to why there are three of them, and why one of my parents use non gendered pronouns, but Tom is still unused to the ways of the mage community due to his religious upbringing. My parents are explaining to him that mum is a witch, dad is a wizard, and the final parent is a mage. A witch and a wizard are usually mages, but a mage is not always either witch or wizard. Tom is bewildered but I think he understands.
“Oh sir… you scared me…” She slowly lowered her hand and then breathed out. “Are you a family member? He hasn’t had any visitors since he came here, despite his allegiance, he has been a very calm patient to handle.”
Shacklebolt sighed once more, his heavy, large body heaving with the action in a rather impressive and slightly terrifying manner. “You mean to suggest we go behind his back?”
He was not the only one unsettled by the display of fangs. Slughorn coughed and then excused himself, leaving the group of mages and a vampire to their own terms.
Almost everyone else in Pat's life has unreasonably forced her to speak when she wasn't comfortable, as well as when she was vulnerable. It was an immense relief to her to be given the option of not being strong or retell the entire story from her perspective, during which she would likely have attempted to make things appear less horrible than they had felt. She would likely have pretended that there was no aching bruise upon her arm, or claim that she had overreacted when she fled her partner for Ngo-Kwang’s safe embrace. She would likely have denied the possibility that Vince was a Death Eater, even if she had seen the mark many times. She was too hurt to tell the real story, and the authority figure wouldn't be able to act according or correctly if the real story wasn't conveyed. An outside party would just act based on what they heard.
“I’m afraid you won’t,” I attempt to laugh my own discomfort away, as well as the memories of my previous partner. “I’m not married.”
“I saw him at the Ministry of Magic, at the Department of Mysteries, there was this steel door and-”
“It has already happened once, dad. You’re too late and your lectures are going nowhere. It is too late.” The Dark Lord’s gentle voice became sharp and threatening as he more or less growled at the man who supposedly raised him.
Harry licked his lips and decided that if anyone would, then it was probably Umbridge. Yet he couldn’t prove anything, especially not without Severus who was not currently at Hogwarts.
I have never felt so calm in my life as I wrap my own arms around him, holding the man I love to my chest. He smells terribly, of rotten scents, of dusty storage rooms and of dried blood. I think El has killed someone. By his own hands this time around, rather than the previous accusations which got him captured in the first place.
Remus turned. Around him, Bill, Fleur and Tonks were participating in the overall noise of the room but the space where Severus had been by the door was empty. The Auror who was tasked with accompanying him was absent as well. Remus wanted to go after him, but his legs felt too weak. He felt like he could neither think nor move, like the world had left him behind and he was stuck, and still he watched the world float further and further out of his reach of understanding.
“Oh yeah, that.” Colin sat down once more. “His reumatism is getting worse, and has spread to his legs, making his ankles and knees rather weak. It is simply less painful for him to use a wheelchair than to walk everywhere, especially with all the stairs at Hogwarts. He isn’t crippled by the pain always, but he might be in the future. However, mom managed to get into contact with a French wheelchair maker after seeing Delacour’s wheelchair in
Overall, the two of them had a lot of fun, and while slightly intoxicated, they were not drunk. It was nothing that the clear, cold air couldn’t make at least a little better.
“I did not know you could cast a patronus, mother.” Draco addressed his parent as the barn owl disappeared into a soft shower of silver sparks.
Both of the men probably had reason for shame in how long it had taken, and the circumstances it had taken, for either of the two of them to begin changing. Yet that mattered little in the face of the fact that the world was changing, and the two of them were catching up to it so as to not be left behind, stumbling their way forward at equally slow, sometimes uncertain, paces. Nonetheless they were both, finally, moving forward.
“I need your help to destroy an object,” Harry continued to search for his hand mirror but without finding it.
Remus hoped that Sirius wouldn’t need consoling that night after speaking to Narcissa, and that he and Severus would be allowed to be alone in their borrowed, shared bed without having the needy dog joining them in it. Whenever Sirius slept with Remus in his bed, he always did it in the shape of his animagus form out of respect for Remus, which the werewolf appreciated.
When he finally handed the assignment in, it was ridden with spelling mistakes and complete with some nonsensical sentences, as the oppressive atmosphere had caused Harry to be unable to perform at his best, or even average level.
“...Do you really think he fancies me?” Draco’s voice was weak when he answered, his cheeks were hotter than his beverage, and he could not stop from squirming slightly in his chair.
“I’m not sure that was ever real, from what I’ve heard about his family, they would never have allowed Sirius his happiness over their own.” Harry sighed, shaking his head.
“It would be a… Sin against our community to destroy something which displays our proud history in that manner. The Ravenclaw students would never forgive us for our transgressions.” Hermione attempted to reason as well as she yet again stepped forward, reaching for the piece of jewellery with far more determination this time around. “Give it to me, Harry.” She reached for her wand.
Harry and Draco both found themselves gaping at the shape which they had only ever seen before as a carcass. Dobby’s patronus was a unicorn, and a large one at that. The magnificent beast made Harry think that the carcass in the Forbidden Forest had been a child or a young unicorn, as this was clearly what an adult unicorn looked like.
Harry felt the anger return, pulsing through him like a venom. “Yes, me too, because it is true. Me and Diggory were taken to a graveyard where I was captured and had my blood used against my will. This resurrected the Dark Lord Voldemort. Diggory helped me escape, he shielded me with his own body. Without him, I wouldn’t be here telling you about the fact that he sacrificed himself so that I could live. I’ve laid awake for endless hours, thinking about the fact that I could do nothing in return for him! But you are right, me saying the same thing as Professor Dumbledore really is the problem here. Frankly, I don’t care if you believe me or not, I can’t bother to care about all of you and your precious need to deny that the Dark Lord has returned. Believe what you want, but at least know that Diggory was a hero, and without him, I wouldn’t be here.”
“You’re lying,” Tom doesn’t shout as he interrupts me. Rather, he sighs, a resignation to being locked away until he dies. “What’s the name of your supposed magic school?”
Sarmad nodded approvingly as he corrected a necklace in a somewhat absentminded gesture. “We stand nothing to gain from the mages fighting a war. It is already complicated enough to find good, healthy donors without potential donors attempting to kill one another in a fight over blood. Nobody becomes willing to part from their blood in such an extreme situation. We’re not Goblins, the last thing we want is for another war, and if it happens, we would not support the Dark Lord winning.”
“Draco, listen, I don’t think it’s a fair trial in itself to let you talk to me and try to convince me of what I should think, but it doesn’t really matter, because I have already decided that I am not going to let them send you to Azkaban. You can calm down.” He sounded awfully confident for being just one witness, but he had experienced just how much weight his words actually held. He wasn’t confident that he could keep Draco out of jail with absolute certainty, but he was mostly certain he could, if he chose his words wisely.
“Tell me everything, please!” The young woman who had lost her partner begged Harry. “In detail. All of it. Please, I need to know. I want to believe you, I really do, and I feel like I will if you just help me.”
What Harry did notice was that Draco seemed terrified; Harry almost completely honestly considered walking over to stand beside him, just to catch him in case his legs would actually give in., but reconsidered because he would probably embarrass the other.
“I’ve had all these expectations upon me since I supposedly killed a man as an infant. Be this, be that, you should do that, and not do this… Umbridge has been pushing me towards becoming an icon for Half-bloods too, not only being Harry Potter, and to stop spending time around my friends because of their blood. It’s all very ridiculous, and in the end, I ignored her and did what I wanted to do.”
“No!” Pat hurriedly said, but she did not turn back. “He isn’t hurting me, he can just be a little rough sometimes. I like it. Or I used to like it. I… I liked it when it felt good.”
“It has likely become part of your magic by now, which would explain why we didn't find anything before,” Al spoke up in a quiet voice as he picked tissues from the small, floating tissue box which had come up to him. Harry recognised it from the time he had exited the Chamber of Secrets when he was twelve. Al threw the tissue into the trash bin and then used another to dry his tears, keeping his gaze focused on the floor rather than the students. “Trying to separate it is likely more dangerous than simply leaving you be.”
“To not apparate from kitchens specifically or not from a place where it would be rude to do so?” Harry put his empty cup into the sink as well, bowed quickly to the Weasley matron, then followed the old wizard out through the back door.
Something within Teddy appeared to snap and he bared his teeth at Crabbe as he forced back violent impulses with all his might. “Then why don’t you just start calling me by my death-name? You know what it is, are you going to abuse me next with a name I don’t freaking want?” He yelled at Crabbe, shaking with rage.
The two brothers grinned at one another as they imagined the implication of their latest, and probably biggest prank. It would be legendary, not to mention great.
Not too surprisingly, everyone in the compartment, with the exception of Geoge who considered Remus to be a teacher more than he did a real person, were more than equally excited to learn that Remus and Severus were engaged.
“There are years like that, I assure you,” Severus carefully stroked over Harry’s back. “Would you like to sit down, I will make you some tea.”
Draco laughed at the attention as he wrapped his arms around his boyfriend’s waist. “You puppy,” he teased in a loving manner.
“Detention? You provoked him.” Neville spoke up, honestly stating what he had observed. “You gave Draco two chances and a warning, but you give Harry detention right away, that’s unfair.”
“Another snake…” Hermione whispered under her breath as she averted her eyes. She closed her eyes, nodded to herself, then refocused on the patronus as it softly encircled Harry, coming to rest on one of his shoulders, hanging down over his back a bit. Hermione was trying to collect herself enough to not be frightened by the animal, and she was accomplishing that goal somewhat.
To keep from feeling things which he wasn’t quite comfortable with feeling, Harry began to hold a whispering conversation with his sleeping friend, paying close attention to the rising and falling of his chest as he did. As long as Draco was breathing, things could be fine. Would be fine, Harry corrected himself. This was no place for more needless anxiety.
From inside the house came the faint scent of herbs and bacon, as well as something which made Harry recall the Potions classroom at Hogwarts. The familiar scent of herbs, tonics, cleanliness and cauldrons mixed with burning wood which belonged together with his favorite Professor’s own classroom made Harry relax somewhat. The man did not appear as immediately unfamiliar when he had a decently familiar scent.
Severus was determined to do something about Umbridge’s using truth serum on a student, yet he needed more time to consider the most effective approach. Unfortunately, the fact that Harry had not suffered particularly badly from the effects of the truth serum made it so that any aware lawyer could turn the case against Harry with the excuse that he was simply a child who was making things up to get back at a teacher whom he didn’t personally like. More was needed to make a case, and nothing could be done directly for the moment, much to Severus’ expressed dislike.
“Unlike Professor Dumbledore’s many mistakes, you were a teacher with the credentials to do what you were hired to do. The Headmaster did not only make mistakes in who he saved.” Severus smiled at him again, a small and reassuring smile.
“They are all people… Even if we probably shouldn’t have made our family quite this big, I swore everlasting love to my children, and I don’t regret bringing them into this world.” Molly stated with absolute certainty. She might have been very unhappy, and to alleviate that unhappiness, she had birthed many children. However, it was not their fault, and she would never blame them for what she and Arthur failed to realise about themselves.
Calmly, she extended a gloved hand, and accepted the letter, which she opened and began reading. Draco caught the former Gryffindor’s eye, and while the latter was grinning like a madman, a certain shine to his eye, the former was clearly trying not to panic.
Greyback leaned back, giving the animagus enough space to transform into a rat. He leapt from the sofa and ran to the other end of the room, a normal, brown rat in every sense except for the right paw being a silver one. Pettigrew transformed back into a human when he was standing on the other end of the room, and became very busy with drying his neck and then attempting to close his shirt and jacket properly. Greyback clicked his tongue disapprovingly as his prey fled, yet the Dark Lord offered Pettigrew the dignity of not focusing on him.
The way Colin’s face lit up assisted Harry in knowing that he made the right choice. Simply seeing his happiness made Harry feel happier.
The two of them were not unique in finding excitement in dangerous situations, which was likely part of the reason as to why the two very different people both enjoyed the thrill of breaking the rules and running from the janitor or teachers who were trying to enforce those rules. However, such an excitement wasn’t generally seen as anything good or healthy. George would agree that it probably wasn’t healthy to find a dangerous situation exciting, yet it felt rather good to know that one of his and Fred’s idols felt the same. Perhaps even reassuring to know that they weren’t alone.
“England expanded itself onto other lands but primarily in America and Africa, and India as well. Through the use of slave trade, manufactured goods and raw products, like cotton and sugar, England became a global superpower. The raw materials were turned into manufactured goods which was made possible by the Industrialisation and the introduction of heavy machines in England. Historians and scientists have concluded that Industrialism only happened in Britain because of the access to alternative fuel sources in coal mined from the earth, rather than made through burning wood. There is more to it, but that should be enough for Harry to understand the idea of colonialism and Industrialism.” Draco nodded at his boyfriend, who slowly blinked in return.
“You wish for me to assist the Death Eaters in making potions, like I did during the past war?” Severus concluded.
“I assure you that the school, as well as magic, is very real. You have performed magic on a number of occasions already, an-”
Thus it felt more natural to extract it through reliving it and shaping it into magical energy, rather than a spell to simply pull it out of the head like some concrete object.
“That’s not his name!” Teddy objected, staring up at Crabbe without any fear. “Whatever the heck got you the right to call him that?”
“Thank you for allowing me inside your home.” Sirius raised his glass in return, allowing the glasses to touch with a quiet, pleasant clink. He tried his best to pretend that his voice wasn't trembling ever so slightly still.
Remus had believed all those things about the werewolf when he was younger, how could he not, seeing as he was one of those child victims which the community was speaking of?
“Culprits are indeed,” Teddy nodded in agreement while Ron, Ginny, Neville and Hermione were wheezing with laughter.
Some students were whispering about Umbridge never rewarding Muggle-born students for their accomplishments while also brushing over most Pureblood students. As there weren’t many of the latter category, it was hard to tell if the rumor had any merit, but far more Muggle-born students were becoming concerned with her more pronounced dismissal of them.
“Oh.” Harry Potter stopped in the door, he was holding a textile bag over his shoulder while he was dressed for the cold weather outside. He had evidently come to shower as his hair appeared dirty and the bag was likely filled with toiletry. He appeared surprised to see somebody there at this hour.
“Hang up your clothes boys,” Hagrid happily encouraged them as he put out three large cups for them and ate what was left of his breakfast sandwich. “Anyone hungry? I baked some pie yesterday, there is still some left.”
There were no words to express how utterly abhorrent Umbridge’s actions had been. No formulation which could help Harry vocalise his feelings. Even if no direct harm had come to Hermione, the event would likely become traumatising nonetheless. Nobody deserved to go through having their entire school worth of accomplishments be called falsified, especially not someone who worked as hard as she did.
The problem was solved as thus, the two young women found an empty place by both their tables, and then simply turned around to face each other with their backs towards their respective tables. They proceeded to have breakfast while talking over the two meter gap between their tables, both of them eating on their laps rather than the tables.
Thus, it was not with direct displeasure that Neville found himself joined in the greenhouse by Professor Slughorn. The man had requested some rather specific plants, and Neville had been nurturing some of them into existence over the half year since Professor Slughorn arrived at Hogwarts. As was their tradition at this point, the man visited him to hear about his plants, or gather some herbs or leaves for another one of his private projects. Professor Slughorn was one of the few people who enjoyed listening to Neville speak about Herbology, the only other two people being his best friend, and his other close friend Harry.
However, it was not Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle or Pansy Parkinson who stole Harry’s full attention and his apprehension. It was not any of the Slytherin students whose names he had never quite bothered to learn.
“Now that’s the problem…” Ron heaved another sigh from his chest, staring at his knees yet again. “I don’t. I feel like I’m the only one who is reacting. I feel like I’m the only one who… well, feels. I feel like I’ve done something wrong for this to happen, I feel like we children are at fault and I feel like… like… Like somehow, nothing actually changed. Mum is still staying at home, seeing as she doesn’t have the economy to move and dad and us, even the house, still need her to survive. Dad is still gone all the time, Fred and George are working, Percy ran off, Charlie isn’t there and Bill is this illusive ghost of a person who I can’t talk to. Crookshanks still lives there, and the house is still all the same. The entire world has changed, and still home is no different in the least. Everyone is doing the same things as always but… Mum appears happy. I don’t know if I’ve ever really seen her this… uh, animated, I guess?”
Here he was, Draco Malfoy, Death Eater, pureblood, supposed-to-be murder of Albus Dumbledore, standing in the livingroom of Harry Potter, with a chubby unicorn cup in his hands, and with eyes swollen from tears. How had he gotten here? How had he gotten to this point in life? Draco neglected to think of that further, and reached down to place his unicorn cup on the table, then allowed himself to sink into the sofa. The sofa felt strange, unfamiliar, and more than a little unused.
“That’s a huge snake…” Neville blinked as Ron fumbled to get his wand out and point it towards the snake.
Hermione felt her heart sink even deeper in her chest. She briefly wondered if one could faint from simply being talked to in an unpleasant manner, completely discrediting her own emotions and her not feeling safe in the situation which she was currently in. “I’m really not,” Hermione whispered, as she came to doubt that she might actually be doing what she was accused of and not realising it herself.
The nun is bobbing away before me, her feet moving rapidly underneath her as I simply stride along by her side without great effort. She is very small and smells of unpleasant scents which reminds me of hospitals and cleaning products. She is leading me through the busy corridors of the orphanage as I pretend not to notice the flaking paint and the odd stains upon some of the walls. It is not that the orphanage is wholly unpleasant, but it is evidently not rich.
“It must have been hard…” Benny’s voice was gentle and without blame. “Thank you so very much for telling all of this to me.”
Pat flinched at her words once more. “I know that!” she hissed at her friend. “I know that, which is why I can’t possibly remove myself from Vince. If I do, then I will be worth nothing. I’m only as alright as I am because he is protecting me. I can’t allow him to grow tired of me, or I would become the ex-girlfriend of a Death Eater and I would be eaten alive.”
Neville was getting handsomer for every year which passed, to a point where it almost felt a little ridiculous. Only, there was nothing ridiculous about somebody looking good. He had dark hair and brown eyes, and facial features which somehow balanced a soft face with symmetrical handsome and harder features making him unusually handsome, at least among the people which their friend group knew. The softness helped achieving an approachable appearance, one where he appeared equally handsome as he appeared humble and kind. He was one of the tallest people, if not the tallest person, in their group of friends.
The snow was so impossibly white, and so very widespread that it took Remus a few additional minutes to realise that the white peacocks which carelessly wandered through it were real, and not enchanted snow sculptures. He and Severus walked hand in hand on the plowed path, which circled around the Malfoy estate like a snake, allowing them access to the snow covered garden which Remus had only known as green before then. Their path was lit by old fashioned street lights, which had to be lit by hand, compared to the electric ones of the Muggle world. The night had not fallen yet, but with the winter came darkness, especially so far removed from the city, which was why the peacocks were still allowed to roam for another hour.
I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I am in love with Gellert, and to my impossible joy, he is in love with me in return. He came to Hogwarts, to Britain, for me, if at least partly. I have never believed in romances, but I do believe that I have never before felt like a part of one, which I do now. One which undoubtedly ends as happily as in all the stories.
There was a scuffle in front of her, and Goyle knelt down on the path as well. He reached out and carefully, gently, patted her back to show her that she wasn’t alone. He also kept the dog out of her face so that she could breathe a little easier.
“Oh yes, yes.” The old wizard clapped his hands, a pleasant noise escaping from the collection of rings upon his fingers, and chuckled at the two Lupins’ response. “See, it is not as philosophical of a matter as we have long since believed. The ‘soul’ as we have previously been speaking of does not in fact exist in that manner. If there is a soul, then it cannot be sucked out and stolen by a dementor. Based on Muggle technology and research, we have been able to conclude that what actually happens upon a person receiving the kiss is that their brain becomes, to use my head researcher’s own words ‘fried.’”
The singer sang the main lyrics and the chorus voiced his fears for him, just like how George attempted to reason with himself, yet truly could get nowhere. There was an obvious discord between the main singer and the chorus, making the latter almost come off as accusations, or badly timed in phrasings, on purpose that was. He especially found comfort in the middle part of the song, which he would proceed to listen to over and over again.
It might be cute to name a girl after a flower when she is two to six, but when that girl grows older, most children will think that ‘Pansy’ is actually the word ‘Pantsy’ and things simply continued to be unpleasant from there. The initials of her name, PP, sounded a lot like the word ‘peepee,’ which many children were eager to point out was hilarious. Only it was not when you were forced to be Pantsy Peepee.
“Sure,” Ngo-Kwang shifted, crossing her legs over one another. “What was the last book that made you emotional?”
Time passed, and time revealed that Draco had not remained at Hogwarts after the outbreak of hysteria, strife and chaos which had followed the prisoners’ escape from Azkaban. Harry didn’t want to believe it at first, as he feared that he had lost the opportunity and the ability to ever approach his beloved friend, but after a week had passed and the weekend was approaching, he had to admit to himself that it was a terrifying reality that Draco was no longer at Hogwarts.
“Oh,” Tom looks at it, vocalising his surprise and understanding in a single syllable. He stands up from being seated on the floor and walks over to the stove, filling a pot with water and preparing a cup of calming chamomile tea for me as I sob uncontrollably on the floor.
“To understand the American Mage War, you need to understand the International Statute of Secrecy,” Harry spoke somewhat slowly so as to allow Colin to take notes. “Throughout the middle ages and up modern times, the mage communities around the world, the ones who managed to contact one another, agreed upon the Statute of Secrecy as a core principle of any magical society or community. The name wasn't originally 'international' as nations were not yet a concepts in the world largely built out of various empires and other communities, and the concept of nations would grow much later in history. The law was first signed in 1689 but was officially established in 1692. It was very likely encouraged and perhaps even rushed when the witch burnings spread around Europe as well as America. The law is designed to make certain that magic communities remain bound by law to remain unnoticed by Muggles, with a specific focus on safeguarding said community by not allowing mages to make themselves known in the world at large. To put it simply, this law is why it is a crime to perform any type of magic in front of a Muggle who isn’t initiated in our community by means of a relationship to a mage. You may show your magic to your mum, but you can’t show it to your aunt, for example.”
Harry poked Neville in the ribs with his elbow, trying to hold back from laughing loudly. Neville grinned back and returned the push with his own elbow. The taller teenager’s lips were generally red, and appeared to have been made for the purpose of smiling, as it made him even more handsome than he already was.
Bella’s eyes looked like they were about to exit their sockets as she gaped at the other man. “You… you lie!” She gasped, “the Dark Lord would never keep someone like you among his followers. You lie!”
“I know, I’m sorry,” Harry smiled weakly at her as he finally found his mirror. “Is it true that you are no longer able to kill or petrify with your gaze?”
The backside of his head was rumored to be scarred to look suspiciously like a face, with two eyes, a nose and some manner of grotesque, wide mouth underneath them, shaped entirely out of loose skin. However, Quirrell always wore a red beanie hat which he had found abandoned somewhere to keep anyone from knowing what was actually hiding upon the back of his head. Due to his various injuries, Quirrell was prone to seizures and attacks which rendered him completely immobile and sometimes frothing.
“It wasn’t.” Harry smiled and began to walk off, waving to him. “Sorry to bother you during your nap. I will leave you alone now. Bye!”
“I can’t believe it could possibly be… this easy,” Molly laughed again as she shook her head in disbelief.
Men like them didn't become happy in fairy tales, in stories and books, but they were nonetheless there, at the moment where marriage became something to speak of. Where a future together was to be addressed.
“When did you first begin to find Herbology interesting?” Professor Slughorn continued to politely push for answers.
“Perhaps even the good thing to do?” Mundungus agreed with a little laugh which by no means sounded half as confident or strong as he had wanted it to.
Thus, the three of them had come to sit at the back of the wedding together, watching as it unfolded, smiling alongside the rest of the audience, and cheering at the end for the wedded couple. The ceremony itself was rather simple, and very poetic, in Harry’s humble opinion. He noted somewhere in the back of his head that some people must struggle with it, since not everyone had arms, but the note was simply an acknowledgement and nothing more substantial.
Albus' cheeks heated yet again as he smiled at Harry, “there is still more to show. About the man El became, and… I want you to see that supposed legendary duel for yourself. I want you to know why I left Tom, and failed my parental duties. It is not an excuse, perhaps it is not even an explanation, but… I want to share it. Would you yet again listen to my selfish request?”
“I did not intend to offend,” Professor Dumbledore raised his hands a little. “What I was attempting to express is this, it is possible that certain traits in young Mr. Lupin might have come about because of the Dark Lord’s magic combining with his own internal magic. It could be that the nightmares you have been experiencing come from the fact that you now share blood with him, as well as both possess a similar internal magic. That would mean that your connection isn’t necessarily by blood, but through magic. However, I am still at a loss at how a magical connection could project dreams and feelings over such a great distance…” He finished with a sigh. “I’m afraid I can only speculate until Severus is here. I hope I have shared some useful information with you nonetheless, and that you do not take my words about the Dark Lord to heart. After all, sharing similarities does not mean that you are the same.”
Hermione’s trouble with Umbridge and the accusations of cheating came to a stark halt once the topic reached the Hogwarts Board of Governors. The Board, led by Lucius Malfoy in this particular instance, examined the case and ruled in favor of Hermione. The accusations of cheating stood against four and a half years of excellent grades, and commendations by a total of nine other teachers, plus four different Defense against the Dark Arts teachers before Umbridge.
Thus, the two boyfriends found themselves back at Sirius’ teenage room, with Draco going through the closet once more. He pulled out everything which he felt was even remotely acceptable, gathering them upon the red covers of the bed. He quickly gathered a rather impressive pile of clothes while Harry sat back upon the drawer which had previously hosted the terrarium. Harry did his best to look at his boyfriend and not the pictures surrounding them.
“Whatever has prompted such an event?” Draco raised an eyebrow at Hagrid as he dipped his tea bag into the water with the lack of coordination which came with not being familiar with anything but tea infusers. Even at the Lupin household, they tended to favour loose leaf tea, even if it was from the grocery store, which meant that Draco hadn’t encountered tea bags there either.
When they were no longer standing next to Slughorn, Harry began to doubt that his choice had been the right one, or even an informative one. He recognised that his open kinship to a former Death Eater might not be good for Harry Potter’s image, but he hadn’t been able to remain as calm as he should have in the situation. Further, it might have been unnecessary to call Severus by such a familiar title in front of a stranger, especially without his permission. Just as he thought about it, the mind reader spoke up.
“Isn’t it supposed to be ‘die’?” Ted whispered to the person who stood the closest to him, namely Arthur Weasley.
Yet when the others began to relax and settle into the idea that things would be fine, Harry remained behind his friends, desperately longing to go to Draco’s side. He was worried since the nurses appeared to be taking longer with him than they were with Ron. Ron’s leg had been broken, which meant that whatever was wrong with Draco was likely worse than a broken leg. Harry couldn’t stop his brain from imagining all manner of terrifying reasons as to why that was.
“I…” Peter hadn’t expected such a question. “I don’t know if I love him, exactly, but…” Peter had loved Sirius. He had been hopelessly in love with Sirius, and was confused over the idea of loving and being in love, thus, Peter struggled to gather his feelings into words. Although, he had never loved the Dark Lord. He had never even known the Dark Lord, not really. He had just served the Dark Lord where there was no other place for him.
Firenze smiled weakly at Harry, then leaned against the tree with a deep sigh. “Violent rejection, child of magic… My… tribe has rejected me.. I can still not believe that I was able to reach your borders…” He glanced behind himself, a look of worry and fear passing over his flat yet handsome features.
“Whi- ah, found it,” the blindfolded Colin almost stumbled but managed to remain upright with the help of Harry holding his hand.
Hermione nodded before she took a deep breath. Harry couldn’t help but smile as he realised that she was using Luna’s breathing technique to calm herself. The people within the room watched as she raised her wand, holding it high as she aimed towards the ceiling. With confidence and purpose, she pronounced her chosen charm.
El laughs softly as he pulls away from me, stepping around me so that I can see him more clearly. “I should have. I thought it from the beginning, and somehow, they don’t become any less brilliant the more I look at them. In fact, they might become even more radiant every time I gaze into them.”
He smiled again, not because he liked seeing the other in pain like this, but because it was sad and he was-... well too broken to be emotional over anything more right then. Instead of speaking, he reached out and ruffled the other young man’s hair, while letting out a sigh.
As agreed upon, forty minutes to the arrival of the Death Eaters, Draco appeared. It was terrifying to see how much he had hurt that year, and the effects it had upon his body. Remus couldn’t resist hugging him, which the teenager didn’t resist in the least, and welcomed it all the more with slight desperation. The teenager was informed of the plan, and he switched the placement of his wand from his father’s cane to his inner pocket, should he need it. Draco was not informed of the entire plan, but he was told to let the Death Eaters pass and remain in the attic room for his own safety, with the Floo Powder. He was told that the guard would have to act one hour after the Death Eaters’ arrival, had they not returned yet. To all of this, he nodded, evidently attempting to steel himself for what was about to happen.
“I thought that I had lost you… forever… and I never dared telling you that… that I…” I sniff as I lean into the hand, feeling embarrassed and ugly as my face burns and my nose and tears compete for what can bring me the most disgrace the quickest.
There was a rustle by the divider and Percy looked up to find a Healer coming around it. The witch almost dropped her clipboard when she saw him, and only managed to stop herself from screaming by clamping a hand down over her own face.
Professor Slughorn nodded as he attempted to act as if he hadn’t actually insulted her with his own statements earlier. “Oh yes, very impressive indeed.”
Hermione sniffed weakly into her tissue, “but that’s how people act, isn’t it?” She knew as soon as she had said it that her comment was faulty. “I… I mean. Not that it is right, but it is typical, isn’t it? To be expected, you know?”
Both communities had hurt each other with their differences throughout history, but Remus knew that a lot of the conflicts stemmed from mages’ general attitude of ruling everything else, and seeing all other intellectual creatures as below their human status. The bigger and more unified the mage communities grew, the more they oppressed all those around them.
“Please. Why would he mind that? I can probably pay him in hugs and he would forgive me. These are fully functional clothes just wasting away when you could be using them.” Draco began to push the clothes around, studying what he found with a focused frown. “You do not have a lot of clothes, it is preposterous to let you have the bare minimum when these clothes are right here.”
Bill had been back for about two months, and had found out the hard way that he was no longer used to the British weather, when he had encountered the new bank receptionist. The receptionist was a blonde, pale person from France, who most people referred to as the Beauxbatons champion, but Bill had missed why that was, as he didn’t usually read the newspapers.
“Can’t catch me, Proff!” Sirius laughed happily as he headed for the kitchen, disappearing out of sight with his glass raised to the sky in an unspoken toast.
“Joy and pride cannot rip a soul apart, correct?” Harry leaned forward slightly, trying to formulate his theory. “There was a period after the death of Myrtle Warren where nobody else was hurt, and Tom appeared to be genuinely upset. That doesn’t sound like the calculating plot of a murderer.”
“With the proposition of the theory, someone like Ron, Draco or me, who all grew up in a magical home, surrounded by magical energy, would have more magical energy in their blood compared to someone like Hermione or Colin?”
Remus watched as his partner raised the cup to his lips to hide the small, relieved smile which was forming upon his lips, regardless of the man’s personal preferences of image. He smiled as well before returning the subject to the one they had been discussing before Mrs. Weasley had detailed the topic. Yet despite the disruption, none of the adults were upset with her, as they had all accidentally changed the topic numerous times throughout their lives out of emotional needs. While such a thing tended to feel shameful at the time, the truth was that most people surrounding were not particularly bothered.
Draco startled slightly when he realised that he had zoned out, and he came back by means of rapid blinking. “I… Suppose I feel a little odd in relating to aspects of Professor Dumbledore’s life. However, I must say that it makes me ever so inspired to not simply let go of what I have together with you. It truly puts into perspective how much two people can mean to one another, even when they are apart.” He smiled weakly as he reached out to stroke over Harry’s forehead, moving some of his hair away from his face to see him better.
“As I have already informed your son of the truth, yes.” The man closed his eyes and breathed in deeply before speaking up once more. “I was never a spy. It is a cover constructed by Dumbledore out of guilt for not being able to…” He stopped to search for a suitable word. “Save me earlier in time.” Severus avoided his gaze as he confessed to the fact that he had never been better than the other Death Eaters, simply lucky enough to have had a friend and a father figure who wanted to spare him from Azkaban.
Draco shook his head, his chapped lips having formed into a smile. “This is a cane with a place for a wand. The snake’s head comes off. Any wand can be stored within it, not only my father’s.”
Dumbledore nodded. “They must never be allowed to suspect that something is wrong. They have to be allowed to complete their task and leave, lest risk precaution to the Malfoys.”
In the end, Hermione had a very pleasant weekend day, spent with her best friend in the calm, mage-desolate greenhouse, where breathing appeared to become easier the longer one stayed.
“Yeah,” he answered shortly, glancing towards the door to the kitchen. “Kreacher, come here.” Sirius didn’t know if the House Elf had been listening in or not. He recalled that it, no, he, had a habit of listening to all manner of conversations, and reporting to Sirius’ mother or gossip to Reg.
The person began to speak about the relatively short history of apparition and how it was one of the most common transportation methods in the mage community today, but not one which everyone favored. They spoke in detail about the strain and pressure of the body when apparating, and of the general dangers if the magic was handled carelessly. They also disclosed the generally understood rules of distance and apparition, which were more diffuse than Harry had expected. It appeared that if one knew the location well enough, one could travel to it from a longer distance, but apparition outside of a country from within the country was generally considered impossible. At least to most, or the average, mage. Further, they detailed that it was impossible to apparate inside something or someone, but that did little to calm the more anxious students.
Harry studied it from afar. The picture was rather small, just slightly bigger than a normal photograph. The frame did not appear expensive, but it was nonetheless elegant. Yet the glass was broken, as if someone had tried to shatter the memory by destroying the picture. There had been no shards of glass when the frame had fallen earlier, meaning that the broken glass had to be from earlier than that.
To that man’s right sat an unpleasant, unapproachable teacher, whom she had only heard negative things about from her children. As a former Death Eater, Professor Severus Snape should not be allowed to find love. He should have died alone with only memories of a past, unattainable childhood love or something to that end.
Another permanent resident was the small, balding man with a squeaky voice and generally frightened appearance whom Bellatrix had come to loathe and consider little more than a traitor. Peter Pettigrew, or Wormtail as Bellatrix called him, was the servant of the household. He was not an accomplished mage, and he was not especially loyal to their cause, which was a most loathable crime in the first wife’s eyes. When she learned that Pettigrew had failed her Master and allowed Harry Potter, a witness of his resurrection, to escape, Pettigrew had been forced to pay for his insolence with his left hand.
“You’ll see,” George assured him. “I don’t know what happened, but mum appears to be happier overall, and dad has this look in his eyes. If I was dramatic, I’d say he almost appears younger as he is working towards reinstating that limit of maximum time during which a criminal can stay in Azkaban. I’ve never seen him like this before.”
“The American Mage War,” Harry pushed the open book over to her. “I just summarised it for Colin, would you mind cross referencing?” He only asked her as he knew that Hermione liked cross referencing things and to add additional information if needed.
If she didn’t have him, none of her other achievements mattered. Vince was her only chance of feeling safe and protected at Hogwarts yet she lived in fear of him deciding to ask her for something she had to decline. She had been scared that he would have demanded a position on the Slytherin team, seeing that he had never quite been able to pass the trials and wasn’t quite what the team needed, not that Pat would have been able to refuse him. Luckily, he showed less interest in Quidditch compared to his general task as a Death Eater. She was particularly terrified of the possibility that he would one day claim to no longer want to use condoms, and demand that she was fine with that, or something to that end.
Snake Harry’s tongue flickered in Ron’s direction as Draco stroke over the snake’s head, still comfortably seated on the sofa. Hermione shuddered at the sight, hating the idea of petting the snake so much that it scared her when Draco did it.
Harry sighed happily with relief as he looked down upon his own hands. It felt incredibly good to return to being himself, so much so that Harry gave himself a hug without thinking, smiling happily as he sat down upon Percy Weasley’s old and Hermione’s current bed. “Body sweet body,” Harry cooed.
Yet it was far harder to tell a friend that one’s boyfriend had been tasked with allowing the followers of his son into his school for the purpose of killing him. In hindsight, Harry found that it would likely have been impossible for him to tell Al the entire story, had Severus not been there and able to access Harry’s mind.
Harry, Draco and Hermione, as well as some other students around Hogwarts, soon learned through gossip and their friends that Firenze couldn’t quite walk. He had a deep gash in his right hind leg which had apparently damaged said leg to the point where the centaur could not place weight on it for longer periods of time. He generally taught laying down in a sort of wide yet low hanging hammock which had been designed by Hagrid for him. Professor Trelawney assisted him by writing important things on the board behind him. The centaur had told his classes that he was attempting to recover to the point where he could at least use the board on his own, but he was struggling too much with his leg to do that for the moment.
“Sybill is the woman who was employed in my current work position before myself,” the centaur gestured towards his person. “She is a child of prophecy, although her predictions are unfortunately never quite as correct as they could have been. I further have the current joy of referring to her as my current mate.”
It was how they had been caught torturing the Longbottom Aurors, alongside the Crouch Junior kid who Rabastan liked a lot. After having learned how painful his life had been, and how much the Dark Lord meant to Bartemius Crouch Junior, Rabastan wanted nothing more than to assure the safety of the rather young Death Eater. He had regretted not being able to keep the little more teenager safe every day since he was locked inside Azkaban, and had almost lost the will to live when he learned that Crouch Junior had died within the prison. Had it not been for his husband in the cell next to his, Rabastan did not think that he would have survived Azkaban.
The transformation was uncomfortable, but it was not inherently painful. Not like how it was for werewolves. Harry took solace in that fact as he closed his eyes and felt his body shift and change around him. He thought he had some idea of what to expect from the polyjuice elixir since he was an animagus, but he came to realise that he really had no idea as the two experiences had little in common. Becoming a snake was a hot and stinging event, to become somebody else felt wrong and unpleasantly bubbly, as if his skin was cold boiling while also having gone numb. It was not pleasant at all, but it wasn’t exactly mentally scarring.
The walk to the tower in question was long, and not altogether pleasant since Harry felt nervous with the silence, but didn’t feel like he had the right to speak to Colin properly until he had apologised. Likely out of concern for Harry, Colin remained silent, which didn’t quite work out in favor of what Harry would have actually wanted him to do.
Then Greyback had been let out, and the war had followed soon afterwards. Remus had heard things about the mad werewolf, who was so bloodthirsty and malicious that one time a month was no longer enough to contain his hunger for blood and murder… or possibly human flesh? It was somewhat unclear to Remus’ mind what that ‘not enough’ part was supposed to refer to. He knew from his own experiences and Severus' studies that werewolves were not exactly bloodthirsty in the first place as much as in enough physical pain to feel threatened by everything around them. This idea of a mad evil werewolf seemed rather impossible, having lived as one himself. Yet after the war, Greyback was locked up once more, with discussions of never letting him out again, seeing as he was evidently too malicious and mad to be bothered by even dementors.
“I don’t know, I just thought…” Ginny began in an unsteady voice before she halted herself, took a deep breath and then turned towards her friends. “I remembered that Percy works as the Minister’s secretary. I figured that there could be a possibility that the door was locked by blood magic. Remember Moody’s lessons about that last year? You must have had them too, right? He said that blood magic can’t distinguish between the blood of siblings, so I thought that it was worth a try.”
“Nessie,” Andromeda used the name which she recalled her cousins using for her sister once she had changed her name, “this is my husband, Ted Tonks. You never met each other.”
Colin grinned at his fellow Gryffindor as he put an arm around Harry, resting his head on top of Harry’s carefully constructed hairdo. “Yep, this one is taken,” he agreed, evidently more than happy to have been asked on what was essentially a date.
Lucius stared at Arthur, his head turned slightly away from the other as a look of tired disgust formed upon his face. Arthur would normally have found the expression to be enraging, yet he could see that the exhausted man was putting on a performance of disgust, rather than actually being disgusted with him. It was somewhat encouraging to know that Lucius had to force his reactions at some points.
“Do you really think it was acceptable to ask him to be my second best-mage?” Bill absentmindedly scratched the scars which had formed upon his left shoulder as Greyback had torn into him with his fangs. “I could always ask Charlie if he doesn’t come, maybe I should have done so from the beginning?”
“I’ve been meaning to ask if you would want to become not not-boyfriends, but boyfriends?” Harry looked up at the other’s face, smiling weakly at him to hide his own nervousness. “It’s not that I don’t like it as it is, but enough time has passed that I feel like I should ask again. I wouldn’t mind it, but I’m also equally happy as it is. I feel like you wouldn’t be ‘punished’ or something, by me struggling to overcome my past relationship.”
“I don’t think it would be any good in a life or death situation, but most people don’t have to worry about those very often,” the smile on Draco’s lips was still there, yet it had become somewhat bitter.
Narcissa wished beyond anything that she could have saved the letters from the fire and allowed Draco to read them in peace, yet she could not, as Bella was always watching.
The werewolf carefully spun his cup in his hands as he spoke of something too unpleasant to remain solely focused upon. “Azkaban has never been so full and we do not know enough about dementors to know what they would do when provided with an almost unending stream of new prisoners. In theory, it could cause anything from an increase of the creatures, to them becoming lax in their security as they would have plenty of sustenance and would therefore not need to care about the older prisoners.”
It was strange to hear the story from Sirius’ own lips, which had been loosened by a few glasses of wine, as he told Bill Weasley about his relationship to his family. The story was not a happy one, but Harry already knew that it wouldn’t be. Sirius' childhood and most of his teenage years appeared to consist of loudly and verbally fighting with his mother, as his father had passed away when he was rather young. It consisted of various acts of rebellion, where Sirius and his mother seemed to practically be competing in who could act out or punish the other the most for their disagreements. It was understandable on the child's part, or so Harry thought, since Sirius would have been a child looking up to and only learning from a woman like Walpurga Black, having no other reference of how to act.
Goyle turned towards her with a surprised look on his face, “what? No! Blaise and Teddy would never let him do that in our dorm. They are keeping Draco safe the best they can.” He had answered the question with the knowledge that one simply couldn’t say no to Vince, and therefore disclosed what they both knew Pat to really be asking about.
They proceeded to practice on their own, while Harry and Luna stood to the side and monitored them, searching for signs that they were overexerting themselves through too heavy usage of their internal magic. It didn’t take long until Harry patted Teddy on his shoulder, communicating without words that he needed to rest for a few minutes before he tried once more.
Harry assumed that clinging to the name Potter was a way of keeping James alive in Sirius’ heart and mind. If there was nobody there to be referred to by Potter, then Sirius wanted to fill that void himself.
School continued like normal, and Harry felt happy in classes for the first time that year. He only needed to think of the fact that Draco was in his room, waiting for him when he finished classes, or that Colin would be there for him at lunch and dinner, to feel like he had enough energy to complete every class and marathon his homework. While he still made an effort to be dignified and collected, he no longer put his hair up the way he had, and had stopped insisting that his name was actually Potter, despite most people feeling like it couldn’t possibly be after all this time denying it.
“That sounds really good. I’ll tell you all you need to know if you have questions.” I offer as we return to the living room, where my family has stopped yelling at one another.
“My fellow mages,” the Dark Lord did not need to raise his voice much to gain their attention, as his followers turned to him like a desperate Muggle turns towards God and religion. “I can sense that you are uneasy to be here, but I assure you that you are safe from harm inside this building as well as from the Malfoys. They have begged me for a final chance to prove their loyalty to our cause. With the success of this plan, you will be yet closer to never having to fear the British mage community again.”
“It’s alright, I get what you mean.” Harry placed Missy’s box down upon the bed. “It reminds me of your bed, and the beds at Hogwarts, so it wasn't as unfamiliar as I was worried it could be.” Harry patted a pillar, smiling at his boyfriend.
Yet not all was bleak, as Ginny proudly announced to her brothers and older friends in the Room of Requirement, that she had managed to score a girlfriend. The girlfriend in question was an overall soft, round faced girl with brown hair and rosy cheeks. She was a Hufflepuff student from the same year as Ginny, and the current Hufflepuff Seeker. Harry had never noticed her before, but when she was pointed out to him by Draco, Harry concluded that his first impression of the young woman was that she appeared pleasant.
“I can barely read it when he makes an effort to make it readable…” Ron thumbed through the pages and glanced at the notes.
