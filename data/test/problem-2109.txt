"Just owl him. Or better yet, text him! It's what all the young people are doing nowadays. You don't really want to run the risk of losing him after all this effort, do you?"
and inevitably falling right back into his addiction.
Draco’s eyes flicked downward, positioning himself, before they met Harry’s gaze once more. Harry felt him put another finger in, and though it was still a tight squeeze, Harry reveled in the feeling.
“I know. But I have to believe Potter’s a good person, because if not him, who else?”
“What? No, Draco, you don’t owe me anything.” Draco looked up; Potter was looking at him seriously again. “You know me, I have that ‘saving people thing.’ I don’t care. No, that’s not right. I do care, I care about helping people, but I’m not keeping tallies of who I helped and how many times. That doesn’t matter to me. I don’t need anything in return. I just don’t like seeing people get hurt.”
"Although I guess I shouldn't talk," Estrada was saying, "Since I think I got him even more riled up."
“It has,” agreed Harry.
Potter's gaze dropped to Draco's chest momentarily; he was nearly smirking.
“What would he get out of it?” Ginny asked, poking him in the shoulder. “Think about that. You said he fancies you too. Wouldn’t he just be hurting himself in the process too?”
“Yeah, like you’d care about being impolite,” grumbled Harry, and before Draco could respond, he loudly shushed him. “It’s starting!”
“There’s no need to treat me like a child,” Leonel muttered as he surely double-checked that he had all the equipment behind Draco’s back. “You have Betty for that.”
Potter entered the room with hands in his pockets. Draco wasn't sure if he was trying to look casual, but it sure wasn't working.
“Luna?”
“Er, thanks,” Harry finally said, once again unsettled by Malfoy showing human emotions.
Granger’s face was hard. “What can we do?”
Draco wondered if Harry would remember what he said he’d do today once he was sober. He hoped he did. He hoped he remembered everything.
“Potter, Weasley,” Draco greeted them as amicably as possible.
Draco paused. Potter was right. There was no true animosity at that party; in fact, he didn’t think there had been any at all this entire year.
“Harry,” Draco began saying again.
Breakfast was sitting on the bedside table under a warming charm, but Harry knew he was too anxious to eat; he felt like he could vomit at any moment. Not wanting to sit still, however, he decided he would take a shower to pass the time.
“Draco,” they said, offering a confused smile as they drew closer. “I didn’t think I’d find you in here so early. You’re not usually in at five, are you?”
"Hermione – er, what're you doing here?" he asked nervously, pulling the blankets up to cover his bare chest, though this was the same Hermione who'd saved his life and had to see him shirtless to do so.
Harry rolled over onto his side as Draco collapsed onto the bed next to him. His face was hot as he watched the other man breathe deep, his chest rising and falling rhythmically. Draco seemed to feel Harry's eyes on him; he looked at him out of the corner of his eye before rolling on his side to face Harry.
He'd apparently left his cell phone back at his flat, which was fine. As soon as he got back home, he could text one of his plugs and pick it up or even just walk to the supermarket and buy a drink and –
“I’m assuming you have, seeing as you’re the Chosen One and all?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. His body radiated warmth. “Invisibility Cloak. Now you know one of the secrets to my success.”
He had to get away.
Potter’s eyes were almost pleading. His fist was clenched around the card, which was now surely crumpled. He was sitting up, leaning forward and towards Draco. He thought about Potter’s breakdown yesterday. Draco felt a twinge of pain in his chest.
“Merlin, Draco,” said Ira tiredly. “At this rate I should start charging you. Do you think I’d be suited for a career change? Mind Healer White. How’s that sound?”
, thought Draco bitterly,
He tried to think of what else he’d liked to do, he really did.
“Yeah, this is brilliant,” Potter replied. “Thanks.”
“Well, I’m not.”
“So,” Harry said, clearing his throat, “We’re really doing this then? The whole, er, dating thing?”
“Potter, I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but in my professional opinion, you
He cursed inwardly to himself. So this is what dredging up old memories did; it made Draco think the unspeakable.
Draco glared at him. “Don’t you dare. It took thirteen-year-old me weeks to get over that.”
“It’s not,” said Harry stubbornly.
“I mean, it’s like he’s just leading me on, asking me out, and then he’s probably going to say, ‘No new relationships for a year, Potter’ again,” he said in his best Malfoy voice, “And then look at me like he wants to say something else, but he just leaves really abruptly instead.”
Weasley had finally reached their bedroom and blanched immediately, his words dying in his throat. Granger was right at his heels, bumping into him when he’d stopped suddenly. Draco crossed his arms defensively and sat up even straighter in bed. He glanced at Harry out of the corner of his eye; he was still standing in the spot where he’d gotten their pants. His expression was unreadable, even to Draco.
“Alright, let’s group up again!”
doing here?” Pansy asked then, breaking the stunned silence in their small group.
Draco waited anxiously under the Cloak as Harry approached a portrait of a woman.
“I’ll owl you.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected, but Malfoy’s office surprised Harry all the same. The walls were a spotless white and a small window provided the same view Harry had in his room. A sleek desk sat in the middle of the room, a little less organized than Harry would have figured it would be. There were three chairs in the office, one of which was Malfoy’s, and two plainer ones for guests. A bare coat rack stood in the corner, and next to it was the fireplace. A fire was already going, making the office a touch too warm.
She winked and gave a playful smirk.
It wasn't with great difficulty that Draco chose to contact his former Mind Healer. Draco quite liked her, and he had to admit that she'd helped him a bit. Of course, he was by no means "fixed," but he'd still made a vast improvement. She was patient, compassionate, and never patronizing, but most importantly, she held patient confidentiality in the highest regard and didn't give a rat’s arse who you were. If you needed help, she was there to give it.
“To The Wild Hunt?” Ronald frowned.
Glad you asked.
“Merlin,” he breathed.
leave now! Shoo!” Life chided and waved her hand dismissively.
Later... or next year or in ten years. That didn't matter anymore. They would be together. Something warm and pleasant enveloped him as he watched tiny specks of gold dance in his lover's hair. This was home. After all the hardship they had had to endure, they had finally arrived.
After hours and hours of research and worry, these outbursts of hilarity were needed to balance them all out.
“Yeah,” champed Half, digging into a slice. “People in this region carry bread and steel with them during Yuletide when they go to church. In case they meet us. If they don't, they offer their things as a sacrifice in places like this one.”
There was no laughter, but there also was no crying.
Maybe he should just take all this rubbish back to the stores and spend the reimbursement on a nice little solitary trip to Hawaii... At the moment, Draco was very tempted to do just that, since he was currently in the middle of a full-to-the-bursting-point Diagon Alley on December 24th. Merlin, could people not shop for Christmas presents a bit earlier?
Curious. They must have hit him with a spell while walking. Weird how he hadn't felt anything. But with hallucinations like this, a head injury was certain.
Aaaand here's a disclaimer: Some lines are direct quotes from the books. Obviously those are not mine.
Of course they'd attempted other things first: Calling for a house-elf again (hadn't worked) and Harry had even tried for his Patronus to lead them the right way, but alas, his majestic stag had shrunken with him and was now merely a fawn, jumping fruitlessly a few steps ahead before evaporating into glimmering silvery mist.
tiresome. Also, it was late, Draco was exhausted. All he wanted was to crawl into his bed. Screw Potter and the merlady. Screw The Wild Hunt.
“I'm not sure I'm familiar with that name. A friend of yours? And you say The Wild Hunt stole him?”
“Would you stop looking at me like that? I'm not up to something!” Draco grumbled.
Giving him a haughty side glance, Malfoy sniffed. “Didn't work now, did it? I'd give you...
“It's Harry,” hissed Harry, too scared to fall down for an argument.
Draco fidgeted and pretended to take a sip from his already empty cup. “I made it. During the year. I thought... I mean, I hoped Potter would be back by Christmas and so... anyhow, it's meant to be useful.”
Draco nodded. A no-brainer so far.
“I, I, I, you!” Draco spluttered.
“He's worth it.” Draco didn't even have to think about the answer. Of course Potter was worth it.
“Ah, good. Well, then... in the light of our conversation just now I need to tell you something. The advancing of your memory loss regarding your life was merely accelerated by calling you Seeker and giving you forget-me tea to drink. What I mean to say is that it is a continuous,  unstoppable process related to Hunt magic. Even if you remember him now, if that Draco of yours doesn't hurry, you will have forgotten about him again when he finally comes for you.” He bit his lip, frowning when Seeker smiled.
He cocked his head. Why did he go to The Burrow again? Yesterday, when he had decided to avoid any festivities, he'd somehow ended up spending an hour with the Weasel and his family. But whyever would Draco do that? His brain started to hurt and he pushed the thought aside. It wasn't important now, was it? As long as there was food. And Merlin, was he hungry!
“Well, you have my gratitude anyway and, er, sorry again.” Time to get out of here.
Draco felt sorry for him, he did, but he also needed answers. “Now, how do you spell O-od- that word you just said?”
,” Draco recited which earnt him several odd looks from the assembled party. And he hadn't even sung them to a tune. He blushed ever so slightly. “Ahem, so, what I think happened is that Potter didn't close his eyes and looked at The Hunt instead, which is why he got spirited away.”
“So tell me, how would he hear me if I don't?” With a sigh, Harry slumped into one of the arm-chairs draped around the table, each of the backrests topped with a wondrous headgear (his had a sallet). This was too strength-sucking. He rubbed his forehead and closed his eyes, exhausted. “Maybe he's not coming because he knows
Draco sniffed haughtily and straightened his back. “Who would shout into a Floo call?”
Well, I just met you and this is crazy but here's my Discord, so write me maybe:
Back then, after weeks in holding (not in Azkaban, but in some quickly reinforced interrogation room turned make-shift cell in the Ministry's dungeons), their lawyer had visited Draco unannounced.
He growled as someone bumped into his shoulder. The street was way too crowded and people staring down at their present lists didn't pay attention to their surroundings much. At least no one had attacked him. Yet. Although these incidences had become less and less.
Now, he didn't even need to think twice before walking down the stairs to the entrance area of the house-elves' realm.

Greg's small dull eyes bore into Draco's. “I don'... Who's Plebs?” Right, Greg didn't remember Potter. Bloody inconvenient.
“Well?! What do you lowbrows think? Is this a dress or what?” Wolfe paraded her borrowed pearl tulle dress like a model on the catwalk. The fine layers of her garment were billowing in a light breeze.
As if this thing between them was so easy to be fixed. An endeavour wouldn't hurt, though.
Draco eyed her with a mix of pride and remorse. Greengrass had never really been part of their inner circle and yet she was here. Because that was their Slytherin motto, wasn't it? 'Real Friends', like the Sorting Hat had sung back in their first year.
“It could go through there and be where it was but,” Lacie pointed at where Tillie had moved aside an old rain barrel and had opened a hidden trapdoor, “sometimes backwards is not forwards and the only way up is down. Or...” Lacie's grin was a bit deranged by now, “it could stay here with us. Forever.”
“It means, haha, it means, you are a magic doer, Seeker! Sunday Children are those born with magic,” BraveHeart tee-heed out of breath.
“It's house-elf magic, Malfoy,” he shouted over the distance of the room, as Tillie had just climbed the highest mountain of rubbish in the well.
“I'm sure. I like my own wand better.” Potter pulled a second wand from his pocket. This time Draco remained calm. “Besides, I'm positive, your wand will always remember me.”

It was a weird but pleasant tea party (without tea).
do, though, is look up The Hunt itself. I know,” she held up her hand to stop Draco from indignantly interrupting her by pointing out that he had been saying that all along, “you said that before, but you missed the crucial point. You're concentrating on finding Piedro and tell us about him every five minutes. But that just triggers the memory erasure. So, what we, Ron and I, have got to do is focus on The Hunt and only that. We can recall things related to the phenomenon as long as it doesn't touch Patty. So, stop reminding us about him and we might actually figure this out. Because, while looking for The Hunt, we'll find out about the kidnapped people eventually, I'm sure,” she finished, looking at her audience expectantly.
He checked the Muggle wristwatch Father Weasley had given him for Christmas. Five minutes to midnight. Now all that was left to do was wait.
“But now Greg, yeah? He just has to sign, the rest is taken care of,” Nott pleaded, leaning closer to Draco which brought out their height difference. Nott had to be really worried to talk so much in one day.
While she put him up on a footstool to be fitted, she chatted endlessly about colours, fabric swatches and true love.
With a deep breath, hands curled into fists, he started his usual round. By now, he knew every name and everyone's story. He walked down the line, looking at each of the crosses in turn, nodding to them and greeting them like old friends.
Anguis drawled lazily, seemingly dozing.

A knowing grin. “It is my business to match personalities, Mr. Malfoy, so I'm very good at reading people and
In the meantime, Hermione went on: “But even he started to forget about you gradually. Therefore, we didn't remember anyone living here and  as we needed a space for research, Draco thought it would be best if he stayed here, so he, er, moved in?” She ended in a question, carefully watching for signs of an impending eruption.
“Breathtaking – just like you,” Half purred, eyes glued to Wolfe's face with a love-struck expression.
"I guess you could ride with Gee and me for a while,” Half chimed in, hastily fastening a bag to his horse. “He has six legs after all."

“What's gotten your wand in a knot?”
Indeed was a number of Hogwarts ghosts apparently playing some sort of loud game in the far corner of the stone-walled hall. It looked like charades.
“Git.”
She was very excited and hummed happily as she started the planning. Ah, it would be such a wonderful place for students and teachers alike.
Draco ran past the band playing
Harry didn't let himself be distracted. “I love you.”
). Between the pages was a bookmark in the form of a library card to – his eyebrows shot up – Manor Library. Interesting. Draco would have to tell him about that... and also about the round reading spectacles Harry had just spotted under a little gold-adorned notebook, which he found highly amusing. Wasn't his Draco just the cutest?
do that to me again! Hear me? Never again!” Draco spat into Harry's neck, hugging his middle so tightly that it hurt. Quieter he continued: “When I woke up alone just now I thought... I thought you were taken again, that I only dreamt you were back.” He tucked his chin onto Harry's shoulder, looking up at him. “Don't disappear on me like that. Don't leave my side.”
Just for fun, Harry tried the glasses and found that Draco's eyes were way better than his own. Placing Draco's glasses atop of his head, Harry lazily opened the notebook.
“Are you ever going to knock?” Weasley shifted from one foot to the other. “It's bloody cold out here.”
Potter simply nodded and slumped down, leaning his back to a wall with his eyes closed.
The shop owner's eyes gleamed. “Oh, great! We have a wide assortment. Let me show you!” He bustled off.
It hadn't been a conscious effort to stop at his unknown cousin Nymphadora's cross but as he stood there and contemplated his life choices, his aunt had approached him.
Potter smiled ruefully. “Yeah,” his lips turned a bit more playful, “and then she lectured me for half an hour:

But his own well-being was secondary at the moment, because...
at least could read the room. “Good night, you two. Come by when you've settled everything, Tomorrow or the day after. There is no rush.”
Frowning, the ghost crossed his arms in front of his chest. “I cannot possibly fathom what you would want with them and I have certainly no inclination to talk about that frivolous group.”
“The Wild Hunt,” Draco said breathlessly, “I need to find them and I thought that the Headless Hunt would be able to point me in the right direction as they are also a ghostly hunting party. But you probably know where I have to look?”
“Riddance!” chirped a second voice.
Another nod.
“Nope, definitely the lake,” responded Potter in a tone that alerted Draco. That was Potter sounding serious.
today Draco would go with him.
“Well,
“It's okay now.” A warm female arm wrapped itself around Draco softly. “I'm okay. You're okay. We're okay. It's all good.”
No one else spoke as Snowdrop/Hedwig gently blurred. Her tiny body fizzled into golden dots of light, which floated upwards towards the sky, until Harry's arm was empty.
“Wait, what about the child?”
“These are not my cups,” Potter remarked as he turned his peacock-shaped mug in his hand.
“My point exactly.”
“They need it. They weren't ready to be separated yet. Hey, we even gave George a Hunt name – OtherHalf.” Taking note of his boyfriend's concerns, Harry had lifted Draco's chin then and had looked him in the eyes. “I promise to be careful. As
Throughout this celebration of life and laughter, the proverbial ghosts of the dead were sitting among them all.
Draco fidgeted for a moment. “Goodbye.” He gave Ember an awkward hug which the other reciprocated.
are almost corporeal memories of the soul's owner which act according to the owner's wishes, but mostly independently.”
Harry shuddered and so did Malfoy.
The women walked away.
No one had shown me the way
Seeker nearly jumped out of his skin from surprise as Draco absent-mindedly put his hand on top of Seeker's hand. Impossible. He couldn't know! Or could he?
His friends looked back and forth between Draco and Thomas and finally decided to stay out of it, awkwardly walking away.
“What does it mean? The glow, does it mean anything?” Harry asked.
For half a year I've been riding with The Hunt.
“Hey, watch it! Gee, Malfoy, you act like this is your first swim.”
The eastern sky was already very bright, when Harry at a sudden impulse slowly reached out to take Malfoy's cold hand in his. After a moment, Malfoy squeezed his fingers back, both of them finding comfort in the other's presence.
I'll sell my rod, I'll sell my reel
Draco braced himself. Well, it would have been too easy to get an uneventful day. His fingers wrapped themselves around his wand. He would not attack but at least try to protect himself.
stones shot past. In fact, there were surprising amounts of bioluminescence now that they had left the squid's cave. The soft light of the pebbles illuminating the floor, were nothing compared to the gently swaying, glowing cloud of white-blue far ahead on their left – or the numerous odd animals that crossed their way: There were fish, of course, like haddocks (fins veined with unusual, silvery brightness) and other normal lake animals like crabs (bluish dots down their back; Draco was reminded of Vincent) but then there were also outlandish sightings like a walrus with green-gleaming teeth, some mice (!) scurrying along the ground with their gills shedding violet light with every breath and... Draco blinked, a mob of–
“I guess not,” he groaned. “What did we do last night? Hell, what did we do all of yesterday? My memories are hazy...”
Epic tones for Harry’s epic adventures,
Draco huffed. “I told you: I'm doing this because someone's in trouble and needs saving. And weren't you the one who said not to bring up Potter so you would remember The Hunt better?”
that the me you see here is only half of who I am. The letter G is connected to my other half somehow, I'm sure. ...and I think, you have met them, this jumper of yours is linked to them, definitely. My heart tells me so.”
By that time, another round of drinks was served by house-elves and Draco remarked in a low voice that Hermione would have quite a bit to say about overworking and fairness, which earned him a choking Finnigan and a cheerful Longbottom explaining that the house-elves were participating on their own free will and had turned down
George whistled. “Oh~
“A story, a story.” A whisper murmured through the crowd and the merpeople looked at their leader hopefully.
, Mr. Changeling,” Wolfe huffed and Half threw her puckered air kisses. She rolled her eyes and turned to Seeker who looked sceptical. “It's really just a story parents thought of to explain puberty, I guess.” She shrugged.
Draco awkwardly patted Thomas' back, until the latter was done thanking him verbosely.
(Draco's side note: Paradox? Also said to bring good fortune! Same as the leader being described as a demon, yet protector of the poor?)
The Slytherin nodded slowly. “And the same goes for you? You won't be able to give away our secrets either?”
. Not that Harry'd never thought about
There was only a split-second of hesitation, then Harry was pulled up, mischief glinting in Malfoy's eyes.
He was also deeply shaken. The woman, the newborn and the man-turned-dog – it was all too much to take in. And hadn't he planned to leave The Hunt as soon as possible? How could he do that, now that he had taken on the task of looking after a bloody
Harry had one arm wound round some of the other boy's strands and was curled on his side.
In a time and place were this was socially unacceptable.

didn't want to dwell on the idea of an immortal Dark Lord, good gracious. Draco would buy Potter a thank you gift after all this. A big one.
It was Tuesday, the fourth of May, barely five minutes after curfew, and Harry was once again in trouble.
Of the gang, Seeker and Wolfe had stayed back with half of the team as protectors, while Half and BraveHeart went forward with the other half as captors.
“I just want to talk!” he yelled from the back of his makeshift barricade while spells kept flying his way. Draco didn't even know why exactly this girl was so angry at him. Of course, there were lots of different reasons coming to mind, but nothing recent. He hadn't seen her in months and couldn't even recall the last time they exchanged words.
Draco turned up his nose and ignored Potter's angered grumble. “Such things should simply not
I think it's when Draco's self-reflecting. Thoughtful and melancholic.
He was still giggling, when he pressed out his name and entered the long, low underground room.
“Just for the record,” Harry laid down flat on his stomach for better balance, “I didn't
Mabel shook her head ferociously.
Before he could do so however, Harry had snatched the piece of jewellery from him. “What's that? Is there an inscription?”
“Oh, it's just: For Christmas they sent Harry a 50 pence piece as his only present once,” the Weasel elucidated and wiped tears of laughter from off his face. “Great comeback, mate!”
Even as a grotesque dog-thing, it was unmistakably Holle, the old crone, her aura radiating around her.
Instead of the anticipated happy reaction, the other boy burst into tears and Draco panicked as two strong arms reached for him. However, within a moment, he found himself in yet another bone-crushing hug. Goodness. Christmas made people really touchy. Especially ex-lions.
Their noise woke up Ember and he growled something about 'idiot couples' as he rolled over to sleep some more only to be shaken and forced to look at his sketch by an overzealous BraveHeart.
(that creates sort of echoes of previous spells) meets an earlier-used Killing Curse and creates a somewhat solid copy of the murdered person, a
Half, face screwed up in concentration, didn't look up. “What do you mean?”
“Really? I hadn't noticed,” said Draco dryly while making a show of eyeing the humongous Christmas decorations all along the windows they were passing by.
Mate. Friend. Today was a day of firsts.
the lights. Ah, he would sleep so well and tomorrow morning– ...and tomorrow morning...
Finally she talked, her voice raspy from crying: “I heard your call. Thank you for the offer, but I won't go with you. My life was here and now, it is no more. I had all I ever wanted. I desire nothing you could give me.”
Half's face went pale and Wolfe also suddenly looked shocked.
Tell me what you think? I would so love to hear from you.
“Sounds ominous. What's that?” Seeker felt a tickling of excitement.
” She flicked her wand, duplicated Draco's hand-written lines and handed the copy to her boyfriend. “And I'll keep this one,” waving the original in her hand, she continued, “so that we won't forget about The Hunt. I feel like I figured out how the mind trick works in this case. We can't research about abducted people or their erased memories, because that is inherently countered by The Hunt's magic. So that won't work. What we

That had turned out to be true. Moss folk were barely seen during daylight hours. That their team today had five of them was purely because these little guys
Harry tried really hard to regain his composure, but by now, tears were running down his cheeks and he had trouble breathing, clutching his stomach.
That gave even the tipsy former Gryffindor pause and Draco, completely bewildered but thankful for the excuse, pointed at the purring cat to indicate the impossibility of him making a fool of himself on a Hogwarts kitchens' table. Thomas shrugged and gave up. That was good, because... Draco had the sudden strange feeling that if he ever were to dance on tabletops it would be with someone else. Someone–
“Well, hullo there,” he cooed and felt a bit idiotic. “Are you lost?”
“Over there,” said Ember quietly, shifting their attention to a farmhouse coming quickly closer. Nightfall had come by now and all windows of the thatched roofed building were glowing islands in the dark.
tale, was it? And Ada is your twin?”
It was a strange wording and Harry gave Malfoy a curious look. Before he could ask though, Alice answered: “You must be or you wouldn't have come here.”
“But that means Potter's out as well?!” Parkinson screeched, shaking an accusatory finger at Hermione.
“We have proof.” Hermione took a deep breath and ploughed on, gambling with high stakes. “Harry's with him as we speak; he can confirm it.”
“Apparently. Or you could just learn that I'm invariably right.”
the king of hearts.”
“...I did, yes. In anticipation. Would you like some?” She gestured at a group of armchairs at the fire which, with the flick of her wand, had roared back into life.
Draco had missed most of it. A circumstance that Harry had not missed at all. He leant over, whispering: “Is it too much? Should we go?”
Lastly, a wave to my great helper
Coming back here, where their adventurous night had started eight hours ago, had been an unanimous decision. They both needed a moment to settle and sort through their thoughts.
“Should we go to The Burrow, then? They are so worried. We all got our memories back at the same time and of course, everyone wanted to come right away, but we didn't know what condition you would be in, so Ron and I came first, but now that you're alright – you
Just his luck. Bloody Potter. Bugger.
“What's going on is,” Zabini, tall, dark and fierce ducked out of the room, as a splintering something hit the wall next to the door from inside, “that Goyle is beyond miserable and drinking himself into an early grave while his supposed
Seeing Potter back there, even for a second, had touched a chord inside Draco that had since not stopped singing him sweet-sad melodies. Like sirens, wonderful and deathly. Also, very confusing.
“But we were broken, we ached, we had lost so many. We needed a refuge, so we made one ourselves.”
But he wanted to know. So he stayed in line. After all, he could always make a run for it later.
Cassius huffed disbelievingly. “Yeah. Like that is so easy.”
“Pleasure.” The merwoman nodded her head once and gave Draco a piercing look. “Now, follow me.”
Draco's heart sank a bit. Grimmauld Place was Potter's house. Draco had forgotten about it. Of course, he would have to move out immediately... He straightened his back. Draco would gladly live on the street if that meant Potter was back.
“Malfoy, do you–”
“Nice try, Granger, but you don't really think, I'll believe you when you say breaking this 'vow' will make me regret it, do you?” Parkinson flicked her hair back. “Because I don't.”
Harry chuckled. A black cat with green eyes. Who would have guessed Draco was such a romantic?
“Shut your mouth!” Parkinson gritted out and made a threatening move towards Ron and Hermione. “Another twenty points from Gryffindor for insulting a prefect, Weasley! No, actually, might be best we just take you straight to the headmistress.”
“Maybe,” Half said dryly, raising an eyebrow, “you would like to ask Seeker first if he would be so kind as to take us along?”
It was Ember that answered, voice in a duh-tone. “Because she is
Was that all that was left? He shook his head and yawned. He would have to do some deep thinking tomorrow to remember more. He was just too tired now, yeah, that was it. It had been a long day.
“Let's just go back,” Harry whispered and felt Malfoy nodding.
While her husband continued squeezing Potter and telling him, how happy, happy, happy he was to see him and how sorry, sorry, sorry that he had forgotten about him, Hermione, with star pins holding back her hair, turned to Draco. She looked a bit flustered. “I put a tracking spell on you, actually, and when the memories came back, we knew you had to be behind it, so we came to find you.”
He smelled nice. Draco leant closer and nuzzled Harry's neck when they reached the second floor. “Well, here's something that's no secret: I'm rather in love with you.”
“That's why we constantly called you 'Seeker' in the beginning,” Wolfe added quietly, while holding Seeker's hand. “Your Hunt name erased your alive name.” She blinked tears away. “Because the only way for you to escape, back to your life, would be if someone outside of The Hunt would call you by your name. But we knew that there was no one left who remembered you, so...”
“Potter–”
Draco blinked. “Come again?”
Equally good had been Hermione and Ronald's first wedding anniversary later that month during which they renewed their vows, so that Harry wouldn't have to feel like he'd missed too much while he'd been away.
He was travelling a lot these days, chasing clues and rumours. One day looking for details on the
Holle I took because I knew the fairy tale and thought it was funny. Berchthold... I just thought the name was unusual, so it appealed to me. In retrospective I should have named him Herne, for this version of The Hunt's leader seems to be most wide-spread.
“'scuse me!” Draco had absolutely no time for courtesy, neither for Longbottom nor for Mrs. Norris.
He pushed the thought away and started climbing the terrace. “What are you doing out here?”
Wolfe smirked and took over from Half by kissing Draco on both cheeks, “we saw him once, remember? Also, Perchta stopped by earlier and told us you were on your way back and would bring a
The song doesn't really fit my idea of The Hunt but I like it, so ignore the lyrics, just acknowledge the line
Well, so was Draco: “What the hell, Potter, that was ages ago and I apologized for that, didn't I? Ask Hagrid, shit, ask Hippo. 'I'm sorry', how many times do I have to say it?”
I wish I had my heart again,
“Once upon a time there were two step-sisters both named Mary. One kind and zealous, the other mean and lazy. One after the other, they met Mother Holle, a friendly elderly woman, in her magical realm. She asked them for help with some tasks, like fluffing up the bedding until feathers came out thus making it snow in the real world. In the end the good girl who had done all tasks, got rewarded by being bathed in gold and was henceforth called Gold Mary. But the bad girl who had slept all day, got punished by being doused in pitch and was henceforth called Pitch Mary. The end.”
. He would have simply died, just like that. Brr, scary thought. Bless Draco for having a thing for equivocal nicknames and damn good timing.
Draco shook his head. Potter was everywhere these days. But boy, had he been a clueless little wimp that first day they had met. Draco grinned. Good old times.
, but after years of contrary experiences… I mean, it  could be, they were simply coughed out on the other side of the castle. Just the same though, it could be something more serious, so seeking aid from a professor sounds reasonable. However,” she continued over Ron's sharp inhale, “we can't risk it, as there is a decent possibility that word gets back to Umbridge. A message though... that's actually an ingenious idea!”
The silence in that moment had been palpable. “So,” Draco had cleared his throat, grasping for self-control, “you've known – or guessed –
DAIS is discovering that they are each more than meets the eye and/or what they thought of each other.
“What?
Harry leant over Draco and gently pecked him on the lips. “I'm sure.”
The other boy looked up and Draco had to inhale sharply at the sight: red-rimmed, sunken eyes in a pasty face crowned an entirely uncharacteristic bag of bones. Gregory's broad shoulders were sticking out through his flimsy shirt and Draco could see how much weight his friend had lost. Dammit, Draco, why haven't you come earlier?
She was a woman now and Harry often wondered if maybe soon she would expect him to do something about that. Yet while they had resumed their relationship after The Battle of Hogwarts, between grieving and dealing and picking up broken pieces, there hadn't been much space for romance in Harry's mind. So the few times they had seen each other alone since had been uneventfully filled with cuddling above all else.
No, it couldn't end like this! Draco needed... he needed...
He was still panting and out of breath when looking down and finding that both his feet had sunk up to the ankles into a trick stair. Typical.
Harry and Draco were in lead. Beside them, making scarcely a sound, walked Half, Wolfe, BraveHeart and Ember, flanked by the horses, and their presence was Harry's courage.
and he had spend months looking for any clues, so that he could bring back the missing baby! Even though the solution had been under his nose all this time! Shit shit shit.
The man blinked: “Javisst. I mean, yes, I speak English. What do you want?”
the work had been finished. And how he liked to fall into the easy banter they were so good at and which had by now become more lighthearted and less scalding.
he had to do both quickly as The Hunt had already passed him by half now.
“No,” Draco rubbed his forehead, “and his name is Potter.”
“Excuse me,” he ventured.
Yes, quite. Especially since the personae of the leader of The Hunt and the crone often intertwine, overlap or trade places.
“Certainly not.”
Harry had the suspicion that the house-elf  had somehow put a spell on the bed which told him whenever his master awoke from a bad dream in the middle of the night.
“Malfoy,” said Draco quickly. Hell if he would let a
However, never had it felt
, you hear me?”
Pansy leant over her right shoulder, while Weasley leant over her left.
It wasn't just that, though. Draco turned around to face the opposite wall, finding it empty. No sign of the hilariously hideous portrait of a goofy-faced Potter that the thankful wizarding community had insisted on hanging there at the re-opening celebrations in August.
He half-heartedly turned back to the still partying crowd. He had to ask someone in there. But who?
“Course. Sorry.”
Scarhead, however, didn't seem to get the memo since he was narrowing his eyes at Draco, scrutinising him in that familiar way. “What's wrong with you? You're as white as a...” His voice was trailing off, when his gaze dropped down to the two broomsticks in either of his hands and then back to Draco's face.
Yet… during the final duel at The Battle of Hogwarts, hadn’t Potter and the Dark Lord talked about love basically being a cure-all? Draco had not been able to hear the complete conversation as he had stood way back in the crowd, but there
“But you insinuate,” Harry replied thoughtfully. “When were you painted again?”
Made no sense.

while feeling like utter opposites. Black and white, tall and small, male and female, flames and snow. They were one and the same and yet different entities.

“Mhm,” Queen Harry licked his lips, “I'd please you real good, if you let me. But, after the game – and as for your request: No can do, sweetheart, not even for you. Rules are rules. You taught me so. Now, time to part with
“There's nothing more, is there?” Weasley turned his book on its head and back. “Nothing in the footnotes or end-of-book-references?”
was patrolling without backup. Therefore, when you do us in, he's due as well. Am I understood?”
“Good, then,” she linked her hand with Weasley's, “tomorrow at noon?”
Between those calm, warm shots were a few loud, garish ones of George's birthday party. They seemed so happy, but to Draco, that day was a memory of silent dread.
it. The fact that he was rapidly shrinking, that was. “What the–? MALFOY! Come back here!”
“How did you get in here anyway? No non-Slytherin should know the password,” Malfoy continued.
“We didn't,” Ron promised earnestly, yet couldn't help himself but to add: “As sure as ferrets are ferrets.”
Harry laughed, tears of emotion welling up in  his eyes. “Yeah. Goodbye! Goodbye, everyone!”
What was that supposed to mean?
On the other hand, it was the Hogwarts re-opening celebration and Malfoy had put in quite the work over the last few weeks, so maybe...
“Yes, absolutely.” She rummaged in her cloak pocket for a moment until she'd found what she'd been looking for. “Ta-da!”
Frustrated, Harry threw his hands in the air. Gone was the amiable mood from just a few minutes ago. “Do you even hear yourself? Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. When
“It's the last official hunt of the year,” Wolfe said lazily from her lying position on Binky's back, her legs dangling. Seeker wondered why she wasn't afraid to fall off. “See, The Wild Hunt is only in business for the Yuletide give or take, only in winter. For the other three seasons, we camp out somewhere and chill.”
But first, what else can I do than to sing the praises of umbrellaless22?
Potter's answer took a second too long and his voice was too forced and cheerful: “I mean, I would, but I can't like this, can I?”
“Right then, may I?” Harry reached out his arms for Anne and with visible hesitation, Mr. Withane gave him the child. “Anne, sweetheart,” Harry cooed, the baby's wide eyes attentively on his face, “can you please call your uncle?”
“Right. And I was just kissing myself silly,” replied Potter dryly.
In his hurry, Draco tripped and stumbled right into the middle of the ghost game, walking through several participants, which earned him a number of boos.
He buried his face into his palms, so he didn't have to look at the other boy. Guilt and shame and the fact that he had just called the boy he may or may not have feelings for by his given name for the first time, all while simultaneously destroying any chance of them to ever be anything at all  – it was all too much. Harry was having a nervous breakdown. Hunched over, he whimpered quietly.
“Tillie! Bad girl! Give it here!” First Voice demanded.
If you now think 'Oh God, too long', here the cliff note version (in no particular order):
, but I figured it out eventually and when you're asking me now, what I like about you, the answer is: everything.”
He fumbled his way to the fringe of the party and finally let out a breath when he squeezed out in between dancing figures, finding himself at last alone-ish at the bank of an almost circular pond, glowing in the same light as his laurels and Snowdrop. Here, close to the midnight blue water, the noises seemed to have moved away a bit. Only soft chimes of bells (which oddly enough seemed to be coming from inside the pond) were heard now and made room for fresh winter air to fill his lungs and thoughts his head. Harry eyed his surroundings. He saw snowy mountains encircling the water in a wide round on all sides. There were no visible paths that could have led out of the dale.
Harry blinked. The man? No, the dog. The red-eared white dog of hell, that now leant out of the window, paws on the sill.
“Pillock.” Draco rolled his eyes. But he explained it nevertheless, very thoroughly.
A feeling which had increased dramatically after their run-in at the park (during which Harry'd already been usually flirty, for he had instantly felt
A cheeky hand landed on Draco's stomach. He quickly shoved it away, albeit with silent regret. “May I remind you, that earlier
First year, right after the war, the intermezzos are like this:
Happy New Year!
(Draco's side note: Persephone!!!)
Draco’s footsteps resumed, echoing on the walls. He briefly considered heading back towards the library to search Potter's name in the books there, but he realised that if Potter wasn't in McGonagall's books, he likely wasn't in any books at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good, then I'll send Ron a Patronus to meet us here later. Kreacher, let's go.” With that she took an unwilling Kreacher's hand and Disapparated with a loud crack.

So, they had agreed. George had to swear an Unbreakable Vow to Harry (with Draco as their Bonder) to never call either Fred's nor Lavender's, Colin's or Vincent's name while in their presence and then Harry had taken George to see Fred.
“Nothing a Death Eater like you could understand,” Potter sniffed, eyes following Draco's wand as it moved to silently clean dirt and leaves off his clothes.
“Harry.” Draco had come back to stand before him and cupped his face. He kissed Harry slowly, taking his time to show him exactly
At last it was only Pansy and he, sitting across from each other, cups of cold tea between them.
“We don't have anything like that, I'm afraid. Libraries are more of a family matter. Like, all pure-blood families have private libraries at home and then obviously there is Hogwarts,” Draco elucidated.
The addressee's head snapped towards the group, eyes beaming. “Absolutely!” He had to shout, since he was currently several feet away, telling other Hunt members that his good friend Seeker got an invitation to one of the moss folk's famous masquerade balls and wasn't that just
Seeker blinked, momentarily distracted.
“Ever heard of the Resurrection Stone?”
day, you know.”
“Okay, so... this Peanut,” (“Potter.”) “was taken by The Wild Hunt, a group of mystical ghost riders. You witnessed that. Therefore, you want to help him and that's why we have to research The Hunt to find him?” The Weasel looked questioningly at Draco, who could all but suppress an annoyed eye roll.
He told Tonks and Lupin, side by side in the third line, about little Teddy's achievement of holding his head upright on his own and how Andromeda and him had had tea the other day.
Granger watched him thoughtfully for a moment. “When Voldemort,” (Draco flinched.) “took over, I put a spell on my parents, remodelling their memories so that they would forget me and emigrate to Australia. I wanted to keep them safe from persecution. Still, even though I reverted the effect, they sometimes lapse back into their fake identities, so I've been reading up on memory magic. That is why I recognised the signs.”
Potter doing all the time?” Pansy shook her head and exhaled deliberately. “That doesn't help us though. Gee, I wish I had a cup of tea now, a really strong one, to get the gears going.” She cocked her head, a nasty smile slowly curling her lips. “
Harry frowned. “On... That's what Dumbledore said to me when I talked to him in the in-between; when I was technically dead.” Draco twitched. “But... I didn't talk to Dumbledore, did I? That was you.”
And when he finally could lift his head again, he was alone in the quiet night. Potter was nowhere to be seen. The Hunt had taken him.
“That... what?” asked Harry, confused.
There was no one around.
Harry suddenly felt rather teary-eyed himself, but a quick scan of the group told him that he wasn't the only one.
Alice cocked her head to the other side and repeated the question: “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
Seemed like that was all the answer Draco was getting. Not that he cared.
He was staring the bony lady down until she sighed. “Very well. Merry Christmas, Mr. Malfoy.” She stepped into the lift.
“Well, since you're here, how about some help? I tried these spells,” Malfoy pushed a list of crossed-out words at Harry, “but they didn't stick, so I was thinking maybe...” And he went into a long-winded explanation about the balance of spells and their characteristics of which Harry didn't understand half.
Draco instinctively ducked away as the Bat-Bogey Hex barely missed him by a hair. His hand flew to his wand and he was halfway done producing a counter-hex when he remembered the reason for his being here. So instead he hastily took cover behind a bearded scarecrow, which was dressed in red velvet the way Muggles liked to clothe during Yuletide, standing askew in the middle of the yard. It wouldn't do to duel the family he was hoping to get help from.
that seems as if woven from clouds. I guess it's part of yours? Looks a bit like it. But mostly, the dead giveaway (excuse the pun) was the elder plant that she supposedly gave to mankind. I mean,
Seeker noticed that seemingly all of The Hunt were up at this ungodly hour to witness the spectacle – whatever it was.
The male snake sounded very annoyed already and they hadn't even started trying to get anyone to notice them yet.
Harry shook his head, what did it even matter if Mr. Silver Spoon attended? Harry would barely have time to talk to him and next to Malfoy with his refined posture and his elegant features Harry would look even more like a country rube.
“Yeah, a spectacular failure,” said Draco miserably and kicked a stone. “We missed him.”
Mabel smiled weakly, glancing over her shoulder once more. “You two are really... Well, this,” she pointed at the rock, “is exaggeration. We don't actually
Harry glanced at Malfoy who had been strangely quiet during the little exchange. The blond boy looked decidedly more unwell than he had before. And... guilty. He looked guilty.
But there'll be lots of Draco's dry humour and false Potter-names in the next chapter! So, look forward to that.
“I... said...
Sighing, Helga picked up the discarded item and dusted it off, then hung it next to the others. So what if she liked designing funny hats? One was never too old for fashionable headwear!
Draco had reached the Entrance Hall and made a face; Patchers weren't supposed to use the official entries, especially not after curfew. Oh, well. Just this once.
Then he ran a shaking hand through his hair as he distractedly rummaged in his wardrobe for pyjamas. Too many thoughts at once ran through his mind and he found himself thinking in circles: He had gotten Potter back from The Hunt, which was good. He had been living in Potter's house for the last year, which was weird. Potter had heard Draco's monologue in the park, which was bad. But he had gotten Potter back from The Hunt, which was good. And he...

“That is like uber-amazing!” squeaked BraveHeart. “Draco, Harry was right, you are
“What purpose would that have?” the ginger wondered out loud what Draco was thinking.
“Tillie heard it.” First Voice was very stern. “Put. It. Down.”
where, in the beginning, she falls down a rabbit hole. And I just thought how this was like that story and poof, there she is, looking exactly like the movie version I watched as a child.”
“Oh, he sure was. Until he wasn't, that is. Actually, you two can just imagine an invisible third party following you around all last year. That would sum it up nicely,” retorted Draco with a sneer.
Harry felt a pinch of nostalgia. Even though he'd been part of them mere hours ago, now he was Harry again, not Seeker and he didn't belong here anymore. He looked at Draco who stared wide-eyed at the chaos. Harry belonged with him now. Yes, this was the way it should be.
So this is it - the end of Storm Chasers.
“Argh! What the–” His hands disbelievingly touched the magic wall. Oh no. This was a gate point to the area, here ran the border, which meant...
“What was that?!” Potter's voice had a sharp edge to it that made Draco pause. That hadn't been such a terrible jab, so why was Potter getting so worked up? “If
They followed him down a hallway into a big, slightly chaotic kitchen where he collapsed onto a chair, dropping his head into his hands, elbows on the dinner table.
Seeker swallowed. This would be harder than anticipated.
He loved adventure and, apparently, he loved men.
“I said I can't, you muppet! Stop shoving me! Look, Potter, I'm glued to the blasted thing.” And he demonstrated by making a quick yank, which earnt him a lapful of taken-by-surprise Harry.
Potter's eyes were wild and Draco's patience finally gave out.
Audible from up above, Potter sighed quietly. That sap.
“Good evening,” said a soft voice drifting towards Draco out of the darkness. He nearly had a heart attack.
Cheers~
“I needed a day at the beach with my girlfriend,” the redhead tried to joke and put an arm around Granger who smiled tight-lipped. “Actually, yeah, maybe I did. I wanted a break, away from the shop. It's fun to work with George, but it's harder than you would think, to run a store.”
Draco's head shot up, cheeks flushed. “What did you just call me?”
His eyes were on the real Harry who squirmed a bit under the hard gaze. However, part of him was secretly pleased that Malfoy kept rejecting Queen Harry's advances. He scratched his nose. “Sort of?”
“Sure.” Draco shrugged nonchalantly. Like he would tell Potter that this was the single most brilliant idea in the universe.
“Where is– never mind. I was talking about Windsor Great Park. On the park bench.”
“The Hunt took Potter!” Draco, having come in at a breakneck speed, nearly keeled over in his attempt to stop before crashing into his former professor.
By now the clamp-like trick step was pushing really painfully against Harry's ankles.
Last but not least, a very important message from my cat:
“So, you,” Harry faltered, wet his lips and tried again. “So, you planned
Just eyed. Very, very sharply.
“I'm sorry! I didn't mean to. I just need to speak to Sir Nicholas.”
“Getting some clothes.
Harry felt like he could do with a bit of alcohol about now, even though he'd never really had any before. He scanned the table. “I don't see any wine.”
“So, are you ready to fight for him?” Queen Harry's eyes were glinting.
“I don't think we have time for chit-chat, Neville dear. Let's go, shall we?” The strident voice of Mrs. Longbottom cut through the air like a knife.
“Well, yes, of course. If I start something, I do it right.” Bashfulness and pride fought a battle on Draco's face.

“I think she would really love to talk to you. She is... she has lost so much in the war: husband, daughter, son-in-law... You are the only immediate family she has left in Britain – aside from Teddy, but he's just a baby.” Harry turned his head a bit to look at Malfoy's cheek. “Had you even heard your cousin had a child?”
; I'll just order him around.” He grinned momentarily and poked little Harry with his index finger. “Everyone okay with that?”
,” Draco mumbled, dazed.
“You're having that look again,” Draco stated evenly. He didn't sound too uninterested though.
And Hedwig... well, Hunt magic works differently on animals (and creatures). I think she remembered everything and she made her own journey to The Hunt (maybe with a bit of guidance by Life and Death) in the hopes to see Harry again. Because she was a smart owl.
“Kreacher doesn't have to answer the M– girl. Kreacher only has to answer to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Young Master Malfoy, how can Kreacher be of service?” He bowed again.
them.”
“More?”
“But how?” Their breath mingled. So close, so close...
Then with a plop and one last look, Harry, Draco and the farmer family left The Hunt.
“Oi!”
you want, Potter?”
The sun started setting, even though it was only mid-afternoon.
Parkinson's eyes slanted. “What's that about Draco?”
“Not really,” Draco admitted, embarrassment crawling up his neck, “I had my thoughts elsewhere.”
He was off Lightning's back before anyone else could interfere, and scooped up the child.
At that, the man finally looked up. “My daughter,” he said with a hoarse voice.
The resident ghost of Gryffindor tower gave him a curious look at that. “With me? What for, pray tell?”
This was his chance to escape punishment though, if only he could get free before Malfoy did...
Maybe sometimes you need someone, who just listens, for you to find your own truths. Yeah, he... maybe he liked Potter... a tiny bit.
That's why Potter had been acting so weirdly... Because he had known that Draco... This was beyond humiliating.
“Hunt magic,” the former huntsman answered casually, yet when Draco made a move to back away, Potter grabbed his wrist, while continuing to smile at Ronald.
Master.
A signal sounded.
Harry shivered. It was six in the morning, still long before sunrise and after all the turbulent events of the night (and the whole past year, really), he was getting  cold and tired.
“That never stops you. You take all the blame for their deaths as well,” Draco mumbled and pressed into the touch.
It bared its teeth threateningly.
“How have you learned all that?” Half inquired, flabbergasted.
Pig preened at the exciting task and at Cassius' finger stroking its little head.
“Oh. Yes, of course. I should have known that.” Draco felt like a berk.
Harry had half a mind to inquire about the 'powers that be' but eventually decided against it. Sometimes it was best not to ask questions you weren't prepared to hear the answer to. Draco seemed to think alike, as he opened and closed his mouth several times, without words coming out.
“Er, so, maybe not the handrail?” Harry finally suggested.
No such luck though. “Malfoy.” Twin Weasley, merrily clad in a bizarre Christmas costume, motioned at him over the heads of the crowd.
big of a slacker.”
That's it! Enjoy~
Of course there had been jokes about the lost guy's occupation (“He's not
“Alright, I got it,” Harry relented. “Just one more question, yeah? If you're all dead, how come everyone's eating and drinking around here?”
The persona of Berchthold was supposedly cursed to spearhead The Hunt forever because he, once a living nobleman, dared to hunt on a most important holiday (Good Friday) which was an offence. That one's the most common story.
Trying to digest all of this, Harry struggled to sort his thoughts. Everything seemed so impossible, so incredible and yet... “You... you saw
“Do you miss him?” Harry heard himself ask.
“Let's try it then? And if I fall, you're there to catch me." It was supposed to be mocking but somehow came out serious.
“What did we say? Don't run on ahead!” A man pushing a pram had huffed up the little hill they were currently standing on.
And Harry Potter smiled.
Harry walked down the aisle between the wooden monuments and stopped in front of the tomb. His thumb brushed the cold marble where once a crack had split it from head to foot.
Especially since he had the nauseating feeling that time was running out: There were days it took until after breakfast till he remembered
“The What-ian flag?” laughed Wolfe and leant forward on Binky's back to squint at the tiny pieces of clothes in the wind.
And not just because I had a great time reading my radiant beta umbrellaless22's edits.
The quartet walked out of the party and around the corner of The Burrow.
They were lucky. The fall wasn't that deep – only three meters or so – and Malfoy's Seeker reflexes made him land catlike on his hands and feet.
Another moan from Weasley. “Again? We did that like a hundred times already.”
So did Queen Harry's. He smirked like a cat that got the cream. “You'll see.”
The best music piece to show that a small beginning can turn into something big.
To underline the craziness of the sisters.
Or blindsided.
Wordlessly, Draco started walking away.
Harry thought that Wolfe could have been pretty if it hadn't been for the half-circle of angry red teeth marks covering her right cheek from brow to jaw and the thick, ropey scars covering her bare arm, collarbone to elbow.
“Ugh! Seriously?”
“Our secrets are safe with me.”
per se. But I get your point, she should have a name. Ember, what should we call her?”
“Hello, Howard.” Potter didn't take his gaze from the cat when he added: “You have nice eyes.”  Was this an innuendo at the resemblance or just a random comment? Despite the camomile tea, Draco felt his nerves rattling.
“What's next?” Potter procured a bottle of water out of thin air (show-off!), took a sip and offered it to Draco.
“I don't...” Puzzled, the farmer's eyes jumped from one to the other.
“Right, so, why are her 'daughters' invisible nine tenth of the time?”
Granger looked breathtaking in her flowing dress and even Weasley had a grain of dashing that day, Draco had to admit. Probably the inner glow of people in love.
Draco let out a long breath and then leant back against Harry's shoulder. “Mister Ollivander said that my wand only listens to me, that it has no connection left to you. It completely changed its loyalty back to me.”
The redhead huffed exasperatedly and flopped himself onto the table they had all been sitting around for some time, talking in circles. “Research, ugh. I thought I was done with school work for a lifetime! Is he really worth all the hassle?”
“And who is
“It's not funny! What if people think that
“Yeah, about that–” Draco tried.
“I don't think so. It's The Wild Hunt not Dementors, Ron.”
Draco blinked. What the...?
“Yes, well done!” Wolfe chimed in, poking Draco's other arm.
(Draco's side note: Are the leader and the woman two sides of the same coin?)
“I wasn't!” Harry yelped immediately, yet he wondered just how true or false this assessment really was. Maybe he would never know for sure. The only thing he
That's all.” She looked up. “How is that gonna help?”
Seeker huffed. “Gosh, Wolfe, you know how I detest well-articulated answers that make sense. Please don't bore me with needless details.”
“They all meet me, when they die,” said Death.
give a damn? Really, Draco, get it together.
“Er, I – oh, okay, thanks, er, Ember,” Harry stuttered as the hulk lifted him onto Lightning without further ado. Harry felt severely unsafe and grabbed the reins tighter than explicitly necessary. Sweat was rolling down his back. But if he ever wanted a chance to get out of The Hunt, he had to leave this valley first. And horseback seemed to be the only way out.
Something warm landed on his shoulder.
“She said that?” Harry choked on his tears and was very glad, he could lean on Draco for support.
“Sorry! That was a joke!” she squeaked.
Getting out a message to his friends during all that chaos earlier (and without Malfoy noticing) hadn't been easy, but he had managed and been so relieved to get any reply at all. Though, furrowing his brows, he wondered once again what
“I didn't mean to! I just thought of– Hold on, did you think of
Climbing back up the stairs, Harry entertained himself briefly with the thought of telling the portrait of Walburga Black in the cellar that her great nephew Draco was currently dating a blood traitor.
Malfoy flicked annoyed at Harry's head in return and nearly got him, too. “Zip it! You have no clue whatsoever. Do you want to hear about the Mell or not?”
Draco grumbled quietly. He was used to being addressed by name by the teachers by now; after all, he was one of the few that showed up almost daily. Nevertheless could he have done without sarcasm on this particular day.
“Harry,” grumbled Harry, rubbing his now armless neck.
Draco used his momentum to gain leverage on the other boy and managed to pin him down. As much as he struggled, he couldn't get out and Draco held Potter's wrists in an iron grip on either side of Potter's head.
“It's called skill, Weasel,” Draco sneered and found himself wrapped in another hug.
“Oh,” Mr. Weasley's eyebrows shot up when he assessed 'the guest' hovering in the doorway. They climbed even higher when the Weasel and his puffy-eyed sister pushed past Draco. “Er...”
“And I did,” Draco agreed and pulled Harry down. “Welcome back, Scarhead.”
“Pansy,” while there were indignant gasps emitting from the nothingness that held Granger and Weasley, Cassius had poked Pansy, “no slurs, remember?”
Malfoy bolted up, wand drawn. “Who's there?”
Potter looked up. His eyes shone. “Thank you. That's a very thoughtful present.” Then he grinned and snickered. “Actually, I also have something for you. From last Christmas. I planted it with the house-elves at the kitchens in Hogwarts.”
“Oi, Half, that's not fair! You cheater!” Wolfe scrambled into an upright position, taking pursue of the hollering boys tearing through the sky.
That's it. There's nothing here about a… Pitty?”
“Mr. Malfoy, if I may–"
Seeker tilted his head. Aha. Yeah, that actually made sense. After all, there were some indecently underdressed riders that couldn't possibly have been picked up during winter time. Okay, one mystery solved.
These delectable lips up close suddenly reminded Draco of something. “What did you say?”
She snapped her mouth shut and smiled with a faraway look on her face.
“Potter,” said Draco more patiently than he felt.
Where is he? What did Potter do to him?” She grabbed the front of Hermione's cloak and shook her. “Where is Draco?”
Harry bit his lip, grinning. Although the claim of having thought about kissing Draco 'every day' had been an exaggeration, Harry
kind of present.” Another round of laughter. The conversation topic changed and Draco was grateful although he could still feel Harry's scrutinising gaze.
, as in, it belongs to Perchta” the redhead grumbled and dropped the same strand of hair for the third time.
? You could use some refinement, Malfoy,” he added arrogantly.
All his companions' eyes were on Harry, making him squirm uncomfortably. “...a dragon.”
“Let the powers that be find someone else to do it,” Harry insisted stubbornly. He saw Draco nod.
Ring. Ring.
BraveHeart furrowed his eyebrows. “I don't know. I just... it's there, somehow. This region is glowing for me, a Somewhen Thing.”
“No more snow!” rejoiced Half.
Harry's smile however felt wavering. He couldn't decide whether The Hunt was good or bad. Did it rage and harm so violently that people offered things to thwart it? Was it really responsible for wars? Or did people only

Death sighed, his breath like a storm gale. “After The Battle of Hogwarts, in the weeks before you joined us, you were closer to me than while you were with The Hunt. Do you understand what I'm saying?”
Harry nodded faintly and saw the others do the same. His gaze stopped on Ember who was still on foot and now that Harry thought about it, he realised that there was no horse left. “What about Ember?”
Malfoy tentatively smiled back, but it was thin-lipped and earnest.
There was a moment of silence.
“POTTER!”
throw himself at Malfoy like that!
“Yes, sorry, but – kitchens!” Granger beamed at them in turn, yet got impatient really quickly when she was only rewarded with empty looks. “
are you doing here?” said a new, harsh voice and Draco felt a hard, pointy something pushing into his spine. “Turn around, slowly.”
“Hey!” Harry scrambled to get back into his own seat.
Even though he hadn't had any specific plans to move out yet, the thought had been on his mind for a while now. It was just difficult to find a different place to live – after all, it had to be a wizarding location (problem one: No one wants former Death Eaters as their neighbours)
“Besides on Hermione's night stand? Ouch!” Weasley had got elbowed by an irritated Granger. “History section, ten rows down that way, near the door.”
Harry licked his lips.
Pansy stared at them. “You're creepy when you do that, do you know?”
Harry arched questioningly an eyebrow at Draco who shrugged. “Don't look at me. They decided that for themselves.”
The drunk carded a big hand through his short, bristly hair. “You always said's right. Blood status.”
“My name...” Seeker whispered, furious tears of disappointment running down his cheeks. “You can't leave me here...”
“Yeah, alright,” the Weasel's hand was still firmly on Draco's shoulder, somewhat grounding him in the here and now. “I'll go in alone. No,” the redhead's grip intensified, “you shouldn't go either, Hermione. Not after everything that happened to you in there.” Draco's quivering redoubled and he felt how dangerously close he was to a full-blown panic attack. Granger on the floor, screaming; Potter, dead in Hagrid's arms and–
They'd noticed the tempest before, while wandering through the castle. They'd hoped that it would have calmed down by now, but unfortunately the gales were still going strong.
“...no reason.”
“Oh, people all over the world know about The Hunt and most of them fear us. But that is only because they
“Wow,” uttered Potter eloquently.
“Ah, yeah, so...” Malfoy hesitated, then quickly grabbed the piece of metal and shoved it into his pocket. “Thanks.”
“I don't mind,” commented Potter lightly and smiled. Was the air in here getting thinner? “At least this way Kreacher wasn't alone. Where is he by the way?”
Hermione rolled her eyes (even though Ron wasn't exactly wrong). “Don't exaggerate. Not
“Sunshine!” Wolfe squealed.
Harry shuddered. He'd been close to death so many times, but this occasion was different: He wouldn't have
“I think I might have feelings for him.” Draco swallowed.
Later he had added to the list of information sources also Muggle museums and other such places.
“Whoa, easy there, Potter, maybe you should sit down?” Malfoy's hand was on Harry's arm, steadying him.
“Down!” confirmed Echo.
Mr. Withane turned to Harry in confusion. “One more?”
As if the cry had been a sign, the weather changed with such sudden force that Harry had to cling to Lightning for dear life: The wind, just a breeze before, had now picked up, transforming into strong gusts. The forecasted lightning buzzed and thunder clapped around them, leaving an electric sort of taste in the air and Harry half-deaf. It started snowing and hailing in equal parts and a fog thick as pea soup materialised with breakneck speed over the water.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. Normally, he would have sat himself next to the witch. After all, this had been his home for the last year; but if he acted that way, Potter would probably lose it. For him, Draco was an intruder in
“Okay, one? Of course he knows you. He adores you to a nauseating level. Two? You would seriously get divorced
Mid-December found Harry and Draco sitting in Ronald and Hermione's apartment for a joint gift wrapping session. The mood was light and the wireless was radiating holiday spirits.
The scorched boy looked at him. “Are you sure?”
A grunt was the only answer.
It confused and annoyed and upset Draco, and he could barely eat at all those five days.
He hugged his arms around himself – the hallways were colder than Draco’s office was – and felt a chill run through his body. He was about halfway there when he heard a soft noise coming from behind him. He paused and frowned, looking back. Seeing nothing, he chalked it up to a patient rustling around in one of their rooms.
Malfoy nodded to himself again, not revealing any of the numbers’ meanings to the others, and began to scribble away.
Harry ran a hand through his hair nervously, but he relaxed at the change of topic.
“I died, you know,” Potter suddenly said, his voice breaking the tense silence. Draco tore his gaze away from the tiled floor and glanced up at him, dumbfounded. But Potter wasn’t looking at Draco; he was staring down at his own hands, curled into fists. “When Voldemort…in the forest, he killed me. Like proper killed me. And I had a choice, to either move on or come back. And, y’know Malfoy, I really thought about going. It would’ve been so easy, so painless…”
As if startled, Draco also cleared his throat. A moment later, he said, "Hoping you'll let me taste you."
"Of course, Healer. We're all here for you," she told him kindly before walking away.
They all sat in silence for a bit, Harry still staring at the opposite wall for fear of breaking down (he would not let that happen – he couldn’t). Finally, Hermione cleared her throat.
“Not really. I didn’t know what would help him. I took a gamble, and I think it paid off. It’s just – looking at him, you can
“What, you want to shag him that badly?” Ginny asked, poking him with her foot. “I don’t recall you ever –“
“This?”
Draco resumed his attention to Harry, who was still lying, vulnerable, breathless, ready beneath him.
Inside was a piece of parchment which read, ‘Malfoy, Blaise tells me you’re asking about Harry. He’s fine. If you don’t believe me, we could all go out for a cuppa sometime. Yes, even without Blaise there. Let me know. –Ginny’
He cut off Harry’s response by kissing him hard on the mouth. Harry gave a moan and Draco had to hear more. He began trailing down Harry’s body, kissing and sucking and licking everywhere he went - Harry’s collarbone, his chest, nipples, abdomen. That oval scar. Harry shuddered.
Draco,” Harry said, sidling up next to him to look at them both in the mirror. He smiled at their reflections – himself, looking happy and
“No, we won’t,” Macmillan said generously.
“No.” Hermione closed her eyes a moment and took a deep breath. “You don’t need to go. I just need to…understand. I’m worried for you, Harry.”
“Yeah. Anyway, this is the bedroom, as you can see,” Harry said, gesturing around him. “Don’t mind the mess.”
need to get to work,” he said as he scrambled to stand and put on his coat. Potter’s brows were furrowed as he watched Draco pull it on. “I didn’t realize how much time had passed. But I…” He hesitated for just a second. “But I’d like to do this again. If you would.”
They spent the rest of break chatting. It turned out Samuel was indeed a year younger than Harry at twenty-one years old. Harry also learned that he was an international relations student at London Metropolitan University. Harry kept the conversation directed towards Samuel; he wasn’t sure how to explain that he dropped out of school before the age of seventeen to kill a Dark Lord, and has since been rather lost.
Speaking of which, it was almost time. He and Harry had decided to take a walk down to the station so they could greet their respective friends. Harry would be here any minute.
Harry sighed loudly.
“It’s –” Ginny wrinkled her nose. “I dunno. It’s
Draco inhaled shakily. “Maybe. But right now, I really need to be alone, and I need you to respect that.”
But Potter saved him from having to figure it out by interrupting him.
Potter…fancied him? Harry Potter? Fallen hero-turned-addict? The one person he was enamored by during Hogwarts, and the last person he should be fancying now?
“Good,” Potter said easily, and smiled slightly when Draco whipped his head around to look at him. “At least
He had promised himself that he would be more subdued upon returning to Hogwarts. Gone was the vicious boy who reveled in being cruel to others. That part of him, no – that person he was had started to fade during sixth year when reality had finally caught up to him. When simple threats weren’t enough and he had to live up to his words. When someone else was doing the threatening.
Kathy nodded. She had heard similar things from Malfoy before, evidently. Harry wondered how long Malfoy had been coming to the meetings. He’d have to ask Samuel later.
Draco nodded soundlessly.
“Sorry, maybe I just don’t get it, but I can tell you that I fucking died and came back even though I didn’t really want to, and you can sort of tell me about how you willingly starve yourself and sick up what you do eat, but
“You’re cold.”
would have come out of it. He felt like a different person - like he was living a new life, as ridiculous as it sounded.
“Hm.”
“Please, Malfoy,” Potter said, putting his fork down and focusing solely on Draco. “You must be starving. You need to eat something.”
Not bloody likely.
The git stood stupidly at the door, his green eyes round with shock. All Draco could do was wipe his face again with the heel of his palm and smile lazily. This wasn't real. There was no reason to get upset.
“Thanks,” said Harry quietly.
Harry’s eyes lit up.
Tuesday night found Draco working late into the night, and on bureaucratic paperwork, no less. If he was working on treating a patient, he would be wholly and completely dedicated, not caring if he had to stay up until two in the morning. But instead, it was useless, tedious paperwork that would no doubt be shoved into a file once he was done, never to be seen again.
A loud noise came from the living room and both Harry and Draco jumped and snatched their hands back. Harry could only glance at Draco’s alarmed face for a second before he was jumped on by Hermione and Ron.
Malfoy frowned. “Have you ever been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder?”
“No,” he said, annoyed at himself. “No, I reckon I overestimated myself. I’m still too bloody anxious for that. I’ll try – later.”
Potter raised his eyebrows. “And weren’t you?”
No one responded, and Harry watched as her eyes met his own.
act was just an act.”
"So you immediately jumped to the conclusion that I'd tell the whole world about you?” he asked, his voice rising. “How about the simple fact that I just wanted to be normal?"
“Potter,” Draco greeted. He looked round for Astoria; she was still pouring their drinks. “What brings you here?”
, Draco thought as he wrote it down.
Draco did. He was fraught with anxiety as he looked at Harry. He must not have been able to keep the worry out of his eyes, because Harry sighed.
“I know,” Draco said quickly, not wanting to think of it. He very much knew that Abbott’s mother had been killed a few years ago by Death Eaters. “I don’t blame them.”
“I don’t know who’s been spreading rumors about me, and I don’t really care to know, but yes,
She complied, taking off and disappearing through the open window. Harry sat down at the edge of the bed, his heart still racing. Draco propped his head up, watching him with anxious eyes.
“Merlin, Harry, you’re…” He couldn’t even finish; he didn’t think he could sum up exactly what Harry was in a word.
Wolff frowned a bit before bidding him goodbye.
“I love you,” Harry mumbled, pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead.
“All the time,” Potter said, his voice low. He seemed lost in thought, his eyes distant. “I’m just – they’re still not stopping. How long are they supposed to last?”
And here ends part one. I wonder if I'll be able to tie the entire story up nicely and have fourteen chapters in part two as well. Fingers crossed?
“You know, if I were you, I’d be more concerned about my health than my Healer. Did you know that you were unconscious for at least fifteen hours? Or that your system was overridden by an unsafe number of potions, and not to mention, alcohol? You’re incredibly lucky you were found, Potter. I hate to think what would have happened if you were left in that state all night –“
“Whatever,
When he finally got it open, Draco admired the sight before him. Smooth, brown skin, muscles firm underneath, marred only by a single, oval scar on his chest. He traced his fingers around it. Harry jumped at the touch. He opened his eyes to see what Draco was doing.
Draco stopped leafing through his lecture notes and looked at Pansy. Blaise was right; he did need to tell her. He told her nearly everything; her and his mother. Draco paused to think about his mother for a moment; guiltily, he realized he hadn’t written her in weeks. He made a mental note to do so after homework today.
There was a dip in the bed as Ginny sat down, her hand still on Harry’s shoulder. He opened his eyes and turned to look at her.
“What would the severe symptoms be?” Hermione asked cautiously.
“I woke you.” Harry’s voice was scratchy, quiet. “I’m always – always trouble.”
“You alright?”
“That’s better,” Draco said, though Potter had already started talking over him.
When he looked back up, he saw Potter’s skeptical face.
And then Harry’s eyes shot open as Draco placed a hand around Harry’s neck, choking him with just enough force to make Harry’s entire body flood with pleasure. He couldn’t stop himself from writhing violently and he looked up into Draco’s dark eyes and soon he was coming with a shout, spilling all over himself and Draco.
“Draco, stop,” Harry said, finally matching his gaze. “I don’t – it’s
He was shaken out of his thoughts when Pansy sat down next to him.
Harry couldn’t stop the thrill of delight going down his spine when he saw Malfoy’s owl outside his window six days later.
“Ok.” Leonel looked nervous but prepared. Draco recognized the glint in his dark eyes, determined to face whatever challenge was in front of him.
“I don’t know if…”
He gave a shuddering breath and slid down the wall into a pathetic heap on the ground. Harry drew his legs up to his chest, took his glasses off aggressively, set them aside, and burrowed his face in his arms, unshed tears dampening his shirtsleeves.
Potter looked exhausted. That was his first thought. His second was, what am I doing here, what am I supposed to say, clap him on the back and say “good job, I’m glad you’ve finally killed the guy I had followed for most of my life, well done”? He wondered if Potter would look at him with hate, the look he had gotten used to over the years, or worse, dismiss him entirely. Instead, Potter just looked at him, eyes tired but not full of hate. Not full of anything, really.
“You don’t mean to say that you, Granger, and Weasley
He went over to the kitchen and poured himself a cuppa before sitting down in his usual chair. A minute later Ginny came in, hurriedly pulling her fiery hair into a large bun. She was wearing a white button-up and the smallest pair of shorts Harry thought he’d ever seen.
Why, Draco?”
“Oho! I see you and Mr. Malfoy continue to make quite a team!” Professor Slughorn beamed as he peered into their cauldron. “Very well done!”
“Sorry. I just,” he took a deep breath. “I hated that snake.”
He couldn’t stop thinking about the conversations with Potter. The way he was talking to Draco was puzzling and strange, and Draco didn’t know how to feel about it. What was Potter playing at? Why did he keep talking to Draco, voluntarily choosing to spend time with him when before, Potter wouldn’t give him the time of day (rightfully so)?
“Fine. I just need to – um, sit.”
"What?"
“Lovely,” said Draco, opening his eyes. “Did you enjoy the show?”
ones, anyway. He’d check the employee handbook later.
Ira gave a loud burst of surprised laughter.
“I’d like to extend my condolences and well wishes,” Zabini said, his voice low and smooth. His dark eyes were fixed on Harry. “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”
“You are,” Draco disagreed. “Don’t bother trying to lie to me.”
“Fine. But we’ll be back to revisit this subject later,” Cait assured him.
"A development?" she raised her eyebrows.
and have people look at you with pity because they can’t do anything else? Because they can’t even begin to understand and the best they can do is say ‘I’m sorry’? Because I’d really rather not, but you’re welcome to. By all means, Potter, go ahead.”
“But the point remains that you should avoid new relat –“
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Harry grinned in a pleased way. “So do you.”
While they ate, Harry considering bringing up the revelation that Ginny and Luna were girlfriends now. Although, he supposed, they might already know and Harry was out of the loop. Nevertheless, he wanted to know. And Ginny didn’t say they were keeping it a secret or anything.
Harry almost laughed. “Thank you.”
A few minutes later, the wave had passed and Harry was left panting and sweating even more than he had been before. This one had lasted longer than his previous ones, he noted, and as a result, he felt even more exhausted than usual. His heartbeat was pounding, loud and forceful throughout his entire body.
Draco’s heart was beating erratically as he smoothed his hair down for the thousandth time since arriving outside the restaurant. When was Potter going to get here? Sure, Draco was early, but would it kill Potter to not be late for – for this?
me?” Harry gave a short, stunned laugh. “And how will you do that?”
He swallowed thickly.
The door shut and Harry swiveled around, momentarily forgetting that Malfoy was right behind him. Malfoy approached him with his wand drawn. A light panic set in, Harry having seen
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, already feeling like a burden.
Draco wondered if he was making it a bigger deal than it was and decided it was likely. Plenty of people had seen Harry Potter keep company with Draco Malfoy, though they couldn’t seem to decide why he did so. Was he taking pity on the subdued ex-Death Eater? Was he being forced to hang around him? Or was he being corrupted by Draco and his evil ways?
“I hate this game.”
The day after Boxing Day found Draco promising himself not to eat as much anymore.
No response.
“So we just need to get you and Weasley nice and sloshed and then you’ll spill all your secrets.”
Potter laughed again, and Draco thought that it was quite a nice laugh.
stop,” Hermione mumbled thickly, turning her head away.
“Hey,” Harry said in greeting. He nodded at the donut. “Are those any good?”
Harry gritted his teeth at the mention of Estrada. He'd like the bloke fine before he learned that he'd shagged Malfoy. And it was true - what was he compared to Estrada? Malfoy probably thought Harry pathetic and decidedly unattractive.
“It’s obviously not nothing if it’s bothering you this much.”
“And you met, for lack of a better word, at a Muggle mental health support group.”
Draco turned in the corridor outside Gryffindor tower, already on edge simply after hearing that voice. He met the firm gaze of Ron Weasley, who stood just outside the portrait hole in his pajamas, and shoved his hands in his pockets, afraid of a repeat of their last encounter.
In between Draco’s talk with Ira and checking up on Potter, he decided that he should move on.
“I’m going to bed.”
They eventually pulled away from each other but still sat close, Draco’s skin burning where it touched Harry’s. He was lightheaded as he took Harry in, feeling a flutter of pride knowing
“Good morning,” Selina said, and then lowered her voice. “That
“We gave each other handjobs in a public loo," Harry said very quickly, his face heating up an extraordinary amount.
He lifted his head and met her gaze.
And then Draco thought of himself, all pale, sallow skin and disgustingly soft with puffy cheeks and sunken eyes, it was embarrassing to even be seen next to Potter. He always felt inadequate, but even more so when he stood next to the Savior.
“I don’t sleep without help, anyway,” Harry mumbled defensively. “Seemed pretty normal.”
Draco cut him off.
Draco cleared his throat. “I’ll have to ask you
again. He knew how badly it had ended the last time.
“You can tell
Draco was mortified – he had no idea he did this, or had such an obvious tell. Or maybe it wasn’t obvious at all.
I'm trying to get more in touch with book Ginny, real Ginny. I feel like I lose her sometimes and have to remember that she's actually a tough gal who isn't afraid to say what she thinks.
“Fine. You know, I’m really not too hungry, so you can go on without me.”
Harry pulled it off and let it fall on the bed beside him.
“Alright,” said Harry, and thought of the address of the Apparition point Malfoy had sent him.
He looked away from Malfoy and turned towards Samuel, who was approaching Harry with a donut in hand.
“I’m glad to see your ego hasn’t deflated at all,” Draco said wryly, though he thought Potter’s enthusiasm was, for lack of a better word, adorable. He loved seeing Potter drunk. He loved being drunk.
Potter – Harry? gave him a little smile and stuck his hands in his jeans pockets.
care.”
She waved, smiling slightly, and she was gone.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said, sighing. He ran a hand through his hair and glanced at Weasley and Granger. “I think this is a conversation we need to have alone.”
. Draco had never brought it up, and why would he? He’d never spoken to anyone about this before in his life. It was yet another problem, just another issue he had. Something else that marked him as different.
Stung, Harry began to argue back.
Looking down at the sheet, he was surprised to see a list of dates in a rushed, loopy handwriting instead of a calendar or schedule like he had expected. It must have been Malfoy's writing; this thought alone made Harry's heart stutter. Remembering himself, he examined the dates and saw that she was indeed booked until next week. The soonest available appointment was on Monday at 10 am.
“Keep in mind that these are called severe for a reason, but…they can include panic attacks, hallucinations, seizures, and suicidal ideation.”
"Master Harry has a guest, Kreacher sees," he said, waddling forward towards Draco. He bowed deeply; Draco inclined his head in a slight nod. "Master Malfoy, it has been years since you have come to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black."
“Are you nervous? Oh, come on, you’ve faced much bigger problems than dinner with
Leonel had a five o’clock shadow now, and Draco itched to reach his hand up and touch his face.
“I think so,” said Harry. He then corrected himself. “I mean, we are.”
She stuck her head back in, and Draco heard her talk briefly with Potter. Ginevra reemerged and opened the door wide, allowing Draco access and her to leave.
Harry traced it with his fingers, making chills run down Draco’s back. He gently pushed Draco back onto the bed and began pressing kisses everywhere - Draco’s neck, collarbone, chest, scars, stomach.
"What about the Harpies?"
Pansy raised her eyebrows at Draco when he returned to the Slytherin common room later that evening. She had been reading in an arm chair in a secluded corner. He sat down next to her and she put her book down on the arm rest.
“You can get something else if you want to,” he said. At Malfoy’s frown, Harry elaborated, “You can drink something other than water; it’s fine.”
“Could you grab me my glasses?”
“So just a few months, then. I’m certain you’ll do brilliantly, Betty,” he smiled softly down at her.
“What if I brought the Cloak?” she asked, a small grin on her face.
“I really am just trying to look out for you, you know.”
Harry nearly gasped, a bit hurt – though truthfully, he deserved it.
Malfoy pressed his finger to Harry’s lips, his pupils dilated and breaths ragged.
“Small part of it?” Harry scoffed. “Draco, I’ve been thinking that you’re an annoying git for years, but I’ve also been thinking that you’re a really attractive git for half that time. It was confusing.”
“Bet you mine is worse,” Draco said softly before leaning in and kissing Harry.
“It’s fine. A few Gryffindors isn’t the entire world,” Draco said. Harry deflated in relief. “But who heard exactly?”
They parted and Draco had to close his eyes to collect himself.
“Fuck, I’m sorry Draco. I got carried away, I shouldn’t have –“
“He’s
"Why can't I ever get angry at you?" Harry asked Ginny, who shrugged. "Fine. Whatever. I'll stay here. Just don't call Hermione over. She's upset with me as it is."
“Harry? Draco? It’s Ron –“
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry said softly.
“Oh!” Leonel exclaimed, stepping closer to Draco as the latter brushed himself off. “Sorry. I was just looking for you.”
all you want about how I’m being reckless and naïve and ignoring the past but you don’t get to threaten my boyfriend when he hasn’t done anything wrong.”
“We got your letter,” Granger told him unnecessarily as she settled into a chair in front of Draco’s desk.
“Hello, I’m Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy name, one that’s been associated with death and torture and prejudice and being Death Eaters for ages. Nice to meet you. Did I mention we personally had the Dark Lord as a house guest, and that I’ve also almost murdered several people?”
Draco studied him for a moment before asking, “Do you miss him?”
“What? Harry?”
Part of the thrill, for Draco at least, was that he still felt like he was doing something
“What about Ira? They’re even younger than me,” Leonel pointed out.
Draco’s brows furrowed. He didn’t think he’d ever heard Potter say ‘please’ in his entire life, much less to him.
“Can we stop talking about Blaise?” Draco asked, feeling a headache coming on.
Draco cracked an eye open and smirked. “So are you.”
It was Draco’s turn to laugh. “Wine, if that’s alright.”
Draco’s eyes glittered as he gave a devilish smirk and slowly withdrew Harry’s cock from his pants. And then, so slowly it made Harry groan, Draco licked the length of it from the base to the head, keeping eye contact with him the whole time. When he reached the head, he licked his lips and took him whole, his hot mouth sliding down the length easily. Harry trembled and knocked his head back, hardly containing the hiss that threatened to escape his lips.
Draco laughed and sat up, picking up his wand once more. “Don’t fancy going down to breakfast covered in sweat and cum?”
“Nothing,” they answered at once.
start one?”
A positively pink Draco was frozen underneath the covers as a bewildered Hermione Granger stood in the doorway with her hands covering her mouth. Kreacher stood behind her – the obvious source of the muttering.
“And here I thought
Pansy opened her mouth to speak, but before she could, Draco stood up. Both Pansy and Blaise looked up at him now.
Harry took a deep breath and watched Ron and Hermione's faces, waiting for them to say something. Ron's face was pale and he looked uncomfortable; Hermione was pursing her lips and studying Harry right back.
She nodded, her intense gaze on Harry. It made him uncomfortable.
“Did I what?” he tried to ask guilelessly, but it sounded wrong even to his ears.
“Maybe…maybe in a bit.”
“Wait – “ Pansy started to say, but her words fell flat and she simply furrowed her brows.
“Jesus, Ira. I wasn’t that predatory. Or vulgar.”
“Did you really drag me over here to ask if I think you care about me?”
“Alright. We were thinking of going out for drinks,” Ira explained, gesturing towards Betty.
“You didn’t even let me finish,” Harry said. “I was going to say, if you’re still worried about it, we can just take it slower. Or hell, take a break. I know I’m comfortable with where I’m at, but if you’re not, we can slow it down.”
Draco spent the next half hour researching poisons in his book collection before going to Ira’s to ask about it.
“And you look better now than you did at the beginning of the year,” continued Harry. “I mean, er, even more fit.”
“Does what happen often?”
This made Draco feel a bit better. He sighed and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Granger face was screwed up and Draco was afraid that she’d start screaming or crying or both – and then it smoothed out into something very neutral (Draco was admittedly impressed). Weasley put his arm around her shoulders, and spoke instead.
“Or you could just sleep,” said Potter. “No offense, Malfoy, but you look like shite.”
“I know, Hermione,” Harry smiled at the both of them. “Well, bye.”
“You don’t need to apologize for that,” Kathy said kindly. “How are you feeling?”
Draco nodded as he draped his coat over the back of the unoccupied chair. He glanced hesitantly over at Potter, who looked…fine. Still much too skinny and with heavy bags under his eyes, but he didn’t look so close to death. Draco breathed a silent sigh of relief and told them that he was going to go get some food.
Harry couldn’t form an actual response and simply whimpered instead; Draco nibbled his ear as his hand reached down and began stroking Harry’s cock through his trousers. Harry writhed underneath him, his hands scrambling to find something to grab onto – they settled on Draco’s arse.
“Great, I’ll have some too.”
Merlin, it was all too cliche. Draco knew this, but that didn’t stop him. Everything else was background. It just didn’t matter. And even if he could take his eyes off of what he was looking at, he wouldn’t be interested in the rest at all.
Harry smiled and leaned in; Draco met him halfway. Pleasure drifted through his entire body at Harry's touch. He didn’t think he could ever tire of this feeling.
Harry liked Betty. She was quiet and didn’t really seem to care who he was.
for a moment there. But now…“It’s strange.”
“Open your eyes.”
The class shifted as students found their respective partners; the sound of friendly conversation and flipping textbooks soon filled the room. Draco had been so busy cursing his situation that he didn’t notice Blaise had already left and Potter had taken his place.
"It means, Potter," Draco said, his voice as calm as Harry's was volatile, "That you haven't examined the pain inside you. You haven't looked at the cause of it to actually begin healing - you just look for temporary ways to cover it up."
Lifting the seat with the edge of his shoe, he kicked it back with a
Draco thought for a moment, his mind working a bit slower than usual. Finally, he nodded.
Potter removed his hand, and Draco felt uncomfortably warm. He tore his gaze away from Potter –
"Are you trying to say you weren’t predatory? Because Draco, he was practically an innocent little lamb when he first transferred over here, and then you had to go and have your way with him."
"I know, I know," sighed Harry. "Right. Anyway, I've been going to group and there's been...a development."
about your sex life, Malfoy,” Harry said suddenly, not being able to let it go.
“Yeah, course,” she said, nodding. She then looked Harry up and down. “You’re Harry, right?”
“Do they use your room? I’m assuming you’re rooming with Weasley.”
“What happened to ‘it’s my choice, Draco, say yes’?” Working so hard to convince me?”
“See? You had nothing to worry about.”
“Well,” Macmillan said, trying to look unperturbed but simply looking flustered.
“I reckoned.”
Harry looked uncomfortable; he ran a hand through his hair and avoided eye contact.
She didn't look convinced but waved him away. "I'll speak with you soon, Draco. If you’d ever like to make an appointment –"
how you chose to broach the subject? Merlin, Harry, I swear – !”
Potter blinked as if he hadn’t been expecting it (as if he hadn’t been demanding it), and then grinned at Draco. An actual, honest-to-Merlin smile that was directed at Draco.
“As I was saying, I only have a vague timeline so far, and I’d like to fill it out in order to better understand you,” he paused, waiting to see if Harry would stop him. When he didn’t, Malfoy continued, “Granger and Weasley have told me you started taking dreamless sleep when you began Auror training and it escalated about a year into taking them. This would place us around 1999. Is this correct?”
kick it?”
Draco was about to deny it before he noticed his hand shaking.
He snapped them open and met Harry’s worried gaze. “No, you didn’t.”
“How do you want me?” he asked Harry, his voice hoarse.
He nudged Granger with his shoulder, and the former gasped in offense.
Draco flushed when he realized Potter had caught him staring; he looked away quickly and tried to think of the last thing Astoria had said. When his fuzzy brain couldn’t manage it, he came up with the next best thing.
“Oh,” Potter said. “Really?”
Sixty minutes later, their potion was coming along nicely. Draco didn’t mind doing the majority of the work if it meant he didn’t have to look at or talk to Potter. Potter didn’t seem to mind much either, given how he simply sat next to Draco and observed silently.
“I was born in the U.S.. In the state of Colorado, to be exact. I'm a Muggleborn, so you can imagine how shocked my conservative, Catholic Mexican parents were when we found out I had magic,” Estrada grinned. “I went to Ilvermorny and decided to study medicine sometime during that. I went to a Wizarding med school in the U.S., but wanted to come to London to do my residency and actually practice. Which is...what I'm doing now.”
Potter turned towards Draco with the expression of an excited puppy.
But Draco didn’t really hear anything past Potter saying he saved him again.
The two Hufflepuffs turned to walk away but Harry stopped them.
“If you say so.”
. “Harry? Why don’t you introduce yourself to the group?”
“How are you feeling?” she asked, her voice a bit tenser than usual.
Harry cast Scourgify wandlessly, the showoff, cleaning the mess they’d made before lying down next to Draco.
muttered Ginny). “I just sort of…went home. We didn’t mention it or anything after we left the pub. I didn’t know what to do.”
The two Hufflepuffs nodded and left to go upstairs; Harry and Draco waited for the footsteps to disappear before speaking.
Nothing. He drew his wand out completely and pointed it into the empty air in front of him. It was too dark to see clearly, though, so he silently cast
And the fact that Harry had asked him to not treat him any differently – isn’t that exactly what he was doing already?
was all that ran through his head as he glared at his disgusting figure.
“Er, what about you, Malfoy?”
He’d walked over to the mirror that hung on Draco’s closet, the one he spent hours agonizing in front of. He frowned at it.
Satisfied and already starting to feel the effects of the Xanax, Harry went back into the living room and sat back down in his spot on the couch. He’d only been half-watching the telly for five minutes when Ginny came through the front door, bringing in the aroma of cheese and marinara sauce with her.
“There’s no excuse for it, I know that. He was shitty and hateful and really fucking prejudiced,” Harry said, his voice still low. Hermione didn’t look up. “I won’t ever forget. I couldn’t, even if I wanted to. But he’s changed, he’s really changed. He’s practically been living as a Muggle these past four years. Muggle jobs, Muggle flat, hell, Muggle group. He knows he’s done wrong – he feels really badly about it.”
. As he set down his “groceries,” he thought that he’d like to feel like this forever.
Draco nodded.
Draco’s thoughts were interrupted by voices behind the curtain. He pulled the blanket up higher, his heart rate quickening; the last thing he wanted right now was a group of Gryffindors finding him and Harry in bed together.
POLL: should the next chapter basically pick up where this one left off or should I do a time-skip? Please lemme know what you think because I'm torn!
"So," Wolff said, folding her hands in front of her, "Who is this client?"
And really, all Draco could do was watch dumbly as Potter climbed the rest of the steps and disappeared around the corner.
Ira was silent as Draco took a seat, placed his coffee on Ira's desk, and put his head in his hands.
He blurted out the first thing that came to mind.
“Don’t worry, Potter, I won’t go sharing your secrets with anyone,” Draco said. “I like to think I’ve grown up, even if it’s just a bit.”
Something about Leonel’s eyes urged him to continue.
, Potter, and you need help, and the only way you’re going to get it is if you stay here and
“Next, I want you to place the tip of your tongue behind your front teeth.”
This was his lot in life now; this is what he’d done to himself. A shitty, never-ending battle. He almost wished he was fighting against Voldemort again.
Draco’s throat was dry as he shook his head. Why was Potter here?
She looked thoughtful as she twirled her long braid around her fingers distractedly. Betty frowned.
With effort, Draco opened his eyes and turned to look up at Potter. He tried not to blush as Potter blinked down at him, his dark hair falling in his eyes and looking much too handsome even in this point of view.
“I’m sorry,” said Potter quietly.
he would have a battered leather jacket.
Draco was locked into a stall in the fifth-floor bathrooms.
,” Potter said, stepping just a tiny bit closer. Draco stiffened. Potter picked up on it, Draco thought, and sighed. “So…then, what about our conversations? It didn’t feel like we hated each other then. I didn’t hate you.”
Her eyes seemed to be burning, and her pale hands were clenched into fists at her sides.
“Don’t treat me differently,” he said softly.
“Bye, Harry.”
“He – well, we had, er, an argument a few days ago,” Harry said nervously, looking away. “So it’s been a bit
He was expressionless again and Draco hated it, he hated Harry’s sick family; he wanted the Harry he was used to – cheeky, flustered, laughing, honest, brave. Not haunted. Not thinking that he was a waste of space. Draco didn’t know how to help. What could he possibly do?
Potter shrugged.
Draco didn’t know whether to laugh or be mortified.
“Good night, Harry.”
Harry’s heart soared as he beamed at Draco, beautiful Draco, and leaned in to kiss him. Draco kissed him back and this time it was so much gentler, more careful. Draco’s face was warm in Harry’s palm, and when Harry ran his thumb back and forth over Draco’s cheek, he shuddered just a little bit.
“Sorry,” he said weakly. “I forgot.”
Draco handed it to Potter, who took it hesitantly. He looked at the card, his expression unreadable, before glancing back up at Draco.
Granger’s eyes were watery again. Weasley sagged with relief, though his arm remained around Granger’s waist protectively.
“Er, well,” Harry frowned. “I don’t know what to say. What do you want to know?”
She huffed. “Let’s start simple then. Why don’t you want to eat in the first place?”
Potter. It was
He heard Potter scowl behind him, and then his footsteps hurrying up the steps.
“I’ll take your word for it.”
“Just tell me what it is, what happened! We were getting on fine and then all of a sudden you’re running off –“
Draco went up to Harry and straddled him, pushing Harry further up on the bed. He kissed him hard, unleashing all of the pent-up energy on his boyfriend. Draco ran his hands through Harry’s thick, dark hair, reveling in the moment.
Estrada’s entire body had tensed up and the open expression on his face had turned to one of mild fear. Harry couldn’t find it in him to feel too badly about it; in fact, he wasn’t feel much of anything at the moment.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t be thick. You don’t – you must realize half our conversations might be better set with a Mind Healer? I don’t imagine you make a habit of talking about all this dreary business with everyone.”
? Who does that?”
“Think about it.”
“He’s currently seeing Mind Healer Wolff once a week and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We have consent to visit Potter if he fails to show up to an appointment.”
“I believe you,” he said finally, his voice low.
be. The prat had no fashion sense whatsoever, but even he did, it wouldn’t make an ounce of difference since all his clothes (sans school robes) were much too big for him. His hair was just as unruly as ever, disobedient and out-of-place in a way that made Draco’s skin itch. His glasses were still ugly and circular, and Draco had a theory that they were the exact same ones Potter had been wearing when they’d first met – just
“No,” Potter said. He set his elbow on the table and put his chin in his hand. “I don’t think you do.”
“I’m meant to meet my mother tomorrow,” Draco said, and put his hand over Harry’s own. “For tea.”
“Should we pick up where we left off?” Harry asked Draco later, up in his room. They were sitting at the edge of Harry’s bed.
Draco thought of his own nightmares. Even now, the Dark Lord or his cursed snake made an appearance at least once a week, causing Draco to wake up in a cold sweat and with a strangled scream in his throat. Blaise never said anything, thankfully, but Draco still disliked the way Blaise looked at him the mornings after.
"I'd slap you, Harry, but I won't," Ginny said coolly. "You didn't come back wrong, and you sure as hell aren't meant to be dead. You came back for a reason, and whatever it is, you're here. You're living and breathing and with all of us and you're fucking meant to be alive."
So was he just supposed to ignore the fact that they had gotten each other off not five minutes ago? He didn’t really remember how this worked – this pulling thing.
Draco stared into the toilet.
“No,” Potter said. He glanced briefly at the onlookers, and pulled Draco away.
“Done already?” Blaise asked, eyeing the barely-touched plate.
And so they sat, Granger and Weasley on one side of Potter, and Draco on the other.
,” Harry said nervously, wondering if Malfoy would mock him.
He’d briefly considered a life without them and in short, it was a terrifying prospect. Hermione and Ron had been constants since he was eleven years old and he depended on them, just like they depended on him. He knew it, and he believed it somehow, so he had to show it.
ed over the years.
Auror training was just wrong for him. It’d bring back feelings of hopelessness and having to fight for his life. It made his paranoia worse, and the nightmares became more frequent and severe – sometimes he’d have trouble telling them apart from reality. After a while, the fear became too much to handle. He had been under the threat of danger for too long and couldn’t bear it any longer.
“I like support groups best, though,” Samuel said. “And this group especially. Good people.”
“Come on.”
“You didn’t get any proper food?” she asked, drawing up to her full height and looking at Harry strangely.
“Mum, stop,” Ginny replied, rolling her eyes.
He was predictably sat with Granger and Weasley. They seemed to be working on papers, though while Granger was bent studiously over her parchment and Weasley was staring dumbfoundedly at his own, Potter was leaning back against a cushioned chair and unabashedly looking at Draco. He raised his eyebrows as he stared at him, then glanced over at Pansy, Blaise, and the elder Greengrass, as if to ask, ‘
“How were the Gryffindors?”
Draco felt cold inside. He reached over to grasp Harry’s hand with his free hand. Harry didn’t look up, but Draco thought he felt a gentle squeeze.
“Yes…”
Samuel smiled at him curiously, and Harry felt warmth gather in his cheeks. Harry looked away, uncertain of what to say.
“Course.”
Draco woke up the next morning with a horribly sore neck. He grimaced as he sat up straight in his bed and rubbed at it, targeting the aching muscles with his fingers. He must have fallen asleep while doing his homework and ended up sleeping, curled up, in a strange position.
He brought his hands up to his mouth as soon as the words were out. They felt strange in his mouth, like they didn't belong, like they were wrong. But there was nothing he could do now. Draco gave a shuddering sigh and watched for Potter’s reaction.
Draco rolled his eyes and stuck out a hand.
He raised his wand and preformed the spells that had become so familiar to Harry the last two weeks. It was strange to think that it was (hopefully) the last time Malfoy would cast these spells on him. Harry watched Malfoy’s look of concentration, studying the furrow of his brow and the way a strand of white-blond hair fell in his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Either way, it went fine. Granger and Weasley seem to loathe me
“Yes, you could say that,” Draco laughed humorlessly. “But I wasn’t abused as a child, Harry. I come from a place of privilege and I was a spoiled brat.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. Potter kept surprising him every day; just when Draco thought he’d finally figured him out, Potter went and did something unexpected again.
“What happened to using my first name, Potter?”
“Potter,” he said warmly. “Thank you for coming.”
“Potter?” he repeated.
“Yeah, I regret having my life change for the better,” Harry scoffed. “Wanker.”
They filed out of the room in a single line, Harry and Malfoy at the rear.
“Nothing,” Harry said determinedly, his gaze straight ahead instead of Draco.
instead of on Pansy’s nails.
his mind supplied inanely). He pushed the door open with a bang and stumbled to the closest stall; he’d barely gotten to the toilet before he began vomiting uncontrollably.
“Yeah, it plays stories. Like wizard photographs but with sound.”
“Well,” Malfoy said, his voice a little less even now, “The first thing we’re going to do is cut alcohol completely. You’re going to feel the withdrawal symptoms peak in about a day, but it’s important that you don’t drink a drop. Do you understand?”
“The first stage has been completed,” Draco told them. “The second stage will take place tomorrow night, stage three two days after that, and after that he should be completely cleansed of all foreign chemicals that are currently in his body.”
Draco studied Harry; he didn’t like this at all. He sighed.
He unwound the scarf that was around his neck and threw it on the kitchen table. He’d gotten a new one, of course – there were too many bad memories associated with that table.
“I suppose he might be. But what do you mean by different?”
Draco let out a deep breath.
“It’s not any different for me.”
Harry shrugged. "I mean...it's the last tangible reminder of Sirius. And y'know...it's cheap. And Kreacher’s quite fond of me," he tried to joke.
That was it? It was a bit anticlimactic, but Draco decided to accept it. Maybe he did feel a bit bad after all. He assumed it was normal for straight people to be curious about homosexuality, though he certainly wasn’t an expert and couldn’t be certain. But still, he couldn’t get mad at Harry for that.
“Thank you, Luna.”
“Thanks, Draco.”
He couldn’t even look directly at him.
This was pretty tough to write to be honest. I kept getting stuck in one area (guess where) and I was in a real bad place mentally at the time - I think it's unintentionally come across in the fic.
“Mmph,” said Leo. “Morning, Draco. What time is it?”
“Should we order food first?”
Potter was noisily chewing an apple and paying no mind to the juice that dripped steadily down his arm. He was dressed in his school robes and a lazily wrapped scarf that marked him a Gryffindor from a mile away. He sat cross-legged, less than a foot away from Draco.
He felt a bit surprised that he could say all that without stumbling over the words and took another drink to celebrate.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, likely unconvinced by Harry’s weak attempt at an insult. Harry's face burned.
“Why me?” Draco finally asked, turning to meet Harry’s eyes. He leaned against the countertop weakly. “How do
Potter looked sideways at him. “Don’t be stupid, Malfoy. Everyone eats. I’m sure even Voldemort ate sometimes. Just dunno what.”
you’re just going to do whatever Malfoy’s going to do for winter break? It won’t be the same without you at the Burrow…”
“Stop it, Draco, I don’t want to think about that right now.”
He hesitated before speaking. “I’ve also been doing well. It’d been a productive week with some pleasant surprises, and it, well…feels like everything is finally falling into place. What I’d been waiting for, looking for, is happening.”
Potter stood as well and began to put on a battered leather jacket, because
Draco's mind was buzzing with annoyance as he shut the door behind him.
‘Know him well’ was a massive understatement, but Potter didn’t need to know that.
to finish school – I haven’t the time to skive lessons.”
you taking us?”
"I'm alright."
“Yes.” Draco frowned. “Who told you?”
Something sparked in Harry – something that wasn’t contempt for himself. Something that wasn’t a deep feeling of TIRED in his bones.
Tears pricked at the edge of Draco’s eyes and he quickly brushed them away, not wanting to cry on the street. The muggles in this town were far too nosy, but Draco hadn’t the heart to move away. That would mean he’d have to leave his Harry behind, and he just wasn’t ready to let go. It wasn’t supposed to turn out this way, dammit! He and Harry were supposed to grow older, get married, adopt some children, and live their lives together. Draco hated being alone. Who would comfort him when he had a nightmare now?
“So break up with him? Ginny, this is not anything I can help you with.”
“Yes sir, I understand.” Harry replied, fighting to keep the tremour out of his voice. Vernon released his grip on Harry’s hair, looking disgusted at him. Harry stepped back, into the hall as Vernon grabbed the key to the cupboard. He pushed past Harry to roughly unlock the cupboard, just as a car pulling up could be heard outside. Harry’s trunk was roughly shoved at him as there was a knock at the door. Petunia emerged from wherever she had been, probably the back garden if Harry had to guess, and opened the door, plastering on her all-too-happy smile. She opened the door as Harry struggled with the weight of his trunk, Vernon standing menacingly behind him.
As Draco made his way down the street towards where Harry now laid, forever, his mind replayed that fateful day over and over in his head. How he had found Harry, crumpled on the bathroom floor, unnaturally cold. And how the note he had left had only read, ‘I’m sorry, Draco. I love you. Forever.’
“Isn’t it obvious? I’m teaching this filth a lesson.” Ron turned back to Harry and landed a decent punch to his ribs, smirking evilly at the noise the force made. Something in Draco snapped, and he lunged forward, shoving Ron away from Harry and down onto the floor. With a wave of his wand, Ron was shoved even further away from Harry, and with another wave, Harry was released from the full body bind and he sat up, coughing. Draco lifted him from the floor and allowed Harry to prop himself against him. Draco quickly fixed Harry’s glasses and pushed them onto Harry’s face. Harry was extremely out of it. He was sporting a rather large bruise on his jaw and on his right eye, and he had scratch marks on his cheeks and throat. Harry blinked several times, determined to pull himself together. Draco wrapped an arm loosely around Harry’s waist, there to support him should he need it. “Do you want to go to the hospital wing so Pomfrey can heal whatever Weasel did to you?” Draco asked. Harry shook his head, not trusting his voice.
Chapter Five
I left the fanfic writing world for… a long time. I shouldn’t have done it without giving notice that my works would be going on hold but I did and I feel really bad, especially after logging in and going through my notifications. As for Whispered Words, I re-read it and found it horribly cringey, entirely too fast paced, and overall just bad and bland. I will be rewriting with more detail, more insight into the gory bits, and more mature themes. I feel ready to do so, and I hope that people will enjoy it they way they seemed to enjoy this version of Whispered Words. It’ll be under the same title, same tags plus a few more to accurately tag the story, and the rating will be bumped up to M. I have some other stories that I’m working on that I feel excited about, a crossover between Harry Potter and A Series of Unfortunate Events, some songfics similar to Downpour although some may be cheerful, and some Cirque Du Soleil related things.
“That’s so… strange.” Harry said simply, grimacing. Draco nodded in agreement. At that moment, Pomfrey came bustling through the curtains. “I hate to interrupt your chat, dears, but Harry needs to take a few more potions then I’ll escort you two to your new room.” Pomfrey said, passing several potions to Harry, which he downed quickly, wincing at the bitter flavor.
“You’re ridiculous.” Harry said as he climbed back into bed, leaving a space for Draco.
“I know, Hedwig, I’ll be able to feed you and let you out soon.” Harry replied in a whisper, slipping his fingers through the bars of the cage to scratch her feathers. She nipped affectionately at him. “C’mon, I’ve got to take you downstairs.” Harry said to her, although he knew she couldn’t exactly reply. He carried her cage and his backpack down the stairs, tucking them into a safe spot near the door before approaching Vernon. He was still seated in the kitchen, still watching whatever ridiculously boring program was on TV, his back facing Harry.
“It’s not like that, I didn’t want you to follow me! I was going to go alone.” Harry found himself wincing away from Ron’s arms and angry stance.
Nothing much happened from then until summer 2020, when I realised that I'm transgender. I use he/they pronouns now (although I prefer he/him). I'm still deciding on a name, but I'm going to be changing my writing profiles to reflect that I'm a dude. It's taking some getting used to but I feel so much happier with my short hair and new clothes. Any name suggestions are appreciated, I love unique and interesting names.
Whispered Words – A Drarry Fic
“If you don’t mind, Weasley, I’ll be going now. I’ve got more important things to do.” Harry moved to go up to the dorms.
A/N: This was SO hard to write! Like unbelievably hard. I think I cried while writing it. I was going to go more into detail with the self-harm and suicide scene, but I decided not to since I literally felt like barfing just thinking about it. The CSA goes far beyond what I wrote but I couldn’t bring myself to write the second incident that I had come up with it was just… too much. I’ll be announcing which ships will be featured in this fic (besides Drarry, duh) in the next chapter so stay tuned for that! Don’t forget to comment your thoughts and vote! You can now find me on Instagram under the username @ rxmanticpxetry
“Don’t play stupid with me. Wait, you are truly stupid, there’s no need for you to pretend.” Ron shot back, raising his voice and smirking at Harry.
“I h-haven’t been able to d-do anything w-without you… Even all of my plants d-died. It’s like they w-went with you…” Draco choked out.
“Yeah, sure, what’s up? You do know I’m not the best person to ask, right?”
To Fred and George, I leave my invisibility cloak and Marauders map. Thank you two for being there for me when my ‘best friends’ were not.
[ Word Count Total: 12,891 ]
“Ron hasn’t been writing? That’s quite out of character.” Arthur mused, and the car lapsed back into silence.
Draco couldn’t help but fantasize about his own death. He’d never acted on any of his thoughts, but his body and mind were desperate to get back to Harry.
“Thank you, I’ll just let Hedwig out now.” He gently pulled Hedwig from her cage, allowing her to nip at his ears and face. As soon as she was brought close to the window, she spread her wings and took off, albeit a bit awkwardly due to months without flying. Harry turned back to Molly, who was now holding the lock.
“What was that?” Vernon’s voice was dangerously calm, and he leaned close to Harry, grabbing his collar and shaking him. Harry only whimpered in reply, which only angered Vernon further. He flipped Harry over and began lashing his back with the belt. Harry screamed and cried begging him to stop but Vernon only lashed him harder, blood spilling out of Harry’s back. Once Vernon began tiring from the intense beating, he threw Harry back into the cupboard and locked all of the locks, leaving Harry to cry alone as he bled onto the floor.
“I’m Potter, Harry Potter.” Harry smirked at Draco as he imitated Draco’s first introduction. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Ron, mate, you don’t really believe that crap that Skeeter published, do you?” Fred asked, not believing his ears. George approached Ron cautiously, inspecting him to make sure he truly was Ron.
A/N: The next chapter is going to contain graphic flashbacks and graphic self-harm / suicide attempt, so you may skip that chapter, since everything covered in it will be covered in a lighter way in the chapters after. I was going to put off it for longer, but I’m impatient and this needs to happen. Everything will probably come off as very cliché, but I’m trying my best so bear with me. I couldn’t write Neville to be bad, so I made him do what he did. I’m debating between having Dean or Seamus be kind to Harry, but I can’t decide which of them it should be. It’d be unrealistic to have them both be kind, seeing as the majority of his house believes the article/won’t go against Ron, so now I’m stuck debating between who I like better. Comment who you think it should be! It would help me a lot. I’m also adding in a total word count for each chapter (the total of all the words in the book, not total of the chapter).
A/N: I’m going to try to skip through Harry being at the Weasleys’ house since stuff can’t really happen until Hogwarts, but once again I’m going to remind everyone and say that this is probably a really triggering book sO stay safe my lovely readers.
The rain poured, and the wind howled, but nothing could deter Draco from going to Harry today.
“I’m going to go get the necessary potions from Severus, you’re free to stay if you wish. I’ll expand the curtains, so another bed will fit in here.” And with that, Pomfrey left, and Draco was vaguely aware of the curtains expanding. Harry was fast asleep, and Draco didn’t want to be alone with his thoughts, so he did the only thing he could think of. He pulled his legs up into the chair with him and fell asleep.
Later that evening after a rather awkward but delicious dinner, Harry and the twins played a bit of Wizard’s Chess, Fred and George alternating between rounds. It was late at night when they finally went to bed. The next day, they would be going to Diagon Alley to purchases school supplies, and Harry was feeling both excited and a bit of dread at having to spend so much time near Ron. He didn’t wish to be back at the Dursley’s, but he couldn’t help but wish he hadn’t come to the Weasley’s house. His thoughts trailed off as he fell asleep, sleeping peacefully for once in his life.
I ended a friendship with my former best friend in August 2019. It wasn't a healthy friendship and it needed to happen, but it affected me deeply and it was hard to use the internet without getting panicky for a while, since we had been internet friends.
Blaise x Seamus (I haven’t seen this ship before, but something tells me it would work? Let me know what you think of this pairing)
“We’ll go tell Mum what’s happened, you can just wait here.” Fred said and before Harry could say a word, they had apparated away and faint talking could be heard from the kitchen. Harry sat down on the couch-bed and stared blankly at the wall, not really listening to the voices from downstairs. Soon, Molly Weasley could be heard stomping up the stairs to Ron’s room, where she then could be heard yelling at him rather fiercely. Normally, the yelling would put Harry on edge, but he was so out of it from Ron saying such cruel things to him that he barely even cared.
Heya! Sorry it's taken me so long to update. This chapter is super convoluted, but I wanted to add a chapter between Harry arriving at the Burrow and the train ride to school. There's a loooooot of dialogue in this chapter, which is a pretty weak spot in my writing, and I feel like I made the characters OOC (which is understandable because it's fanfiction and their lives are really different here than in canon, but still). It's gonna take a while to build up to Drarry, but I hope you all will stick around! I love getting comments and criticism, but please be respectful! I'm trying my best here :'). Life-y updates at the end notes as per usual, they'll probably be super ramble-y and weird. For some reason, the last time I updated the ending note got stacked with the one from the previous chapter, so I don't know what's up with that but I am a total noob at this site, despite being here for a year or two now.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Harry said, winking at Draco. The two collapsed into fits of laughter. The day passed by quickly, Draco had moved to sit on Harry’s bed and the two joked and got to know each other better. Draco found out that Harry’s favourite colour was green, not red like everybody assumed, and Harry found out that Draco had a really soft spot for cats, particularly Scottish Folds. Soon, it was getting late, and both boys were getting tired. Harry curled up under the hospital blanket and Draco had returned to his chair. “You don’t have to stay, you know. You could go to our new room or you could go to the Slytherin dorms.” Harry said, his tiredness making his voice hoarse.
The night before Arthur Weasley was set to pick Harry up, Harry found himself standing in front of the cracked mirror that had been left in his bedroom. His hair had grown longer over the summer, long enough that he wondered why Petunia hadn’t attempted to hack it off with kitchen scissors, as she had done so often when he was younger. His hair hung loosely around his face, perhaps long enough to be pulled up, if he tried hard enough. He was still thin and short though, and he supposed that would never change. His usually pale skin was a mix of tan and sunburn. He grimaced as he looked at his muddy and overly large clothing. As hopeless as he was with fashion, he knew that looking as if he were a street rat was definitely not how he wanted to be seen. He sighed, turning away from the mirror to go sit on his bed.
Draco held out Harry for her to see and she motioned for Draco to follow her. Draco followed her to a private healing room and set Harry onto the bed. Pomfrey shooed Draco to the chair she had conjured for him. She began running diagnostic charms on Harry as she treated the arm he had cut. She gasped softly as she saw that these were not his only cuts, his arm was littered with scars, some more fresh than others. They ranged from extremely deep, the kind that leave raised scars, to shallow ones that leave faint white scars. She finished closing his wounds before turning to Draco. “The diagnostic charm shows he has more injuries than these, so I’m going to have to remove his robes to fully be able to heal him. Be a dear and hold his robes for me, would you?” Pomfrey didn’t wait for an answer, drawing the curtains around Harry’s bed so Draco wouldn’t see him. Harry’s robes came floating out from behind the curtain and Draco grabbed them. He folded them up, so they’d be easier to keep together when he heard the tell-tale crunch of parchment from one of the pockets of Harry’s robes. Draco cautiously took it out, careful to not make too much of the crinkly noise, as that would draw the attention of Pomfrey. He slowly unrolled it and paled several shades as he realized it was a suicide note. Harry had written:
“Could you tell me what you think happened to him? That’ll give me an idea of where he’s injured.” Draco said, resting both his hands on the edge of Harry’s bed. Pomfrey nodded.
The kitchen was soon filled with the delicious aroma of a savory breakfast. Harry was preparing eggs, bacon, and fresh scones. The Dursleys began slowly emerging from their rooms, first Petunia, who came down dressed as formally as she did on days when Vernon brought important people to the house to work out deals. She took her seat at the table, and although her presence disrupted the sense of tranquility Harry had created, she was unthreatening and quiet. Dudley came downstairs next, still in his pajamas, his hair sticking out at odd angles. He never really bothered Harry unless around his gang or his father, so he simply flopped onto the couch and turned on the telly. Finally, right as Harry was finishing up with his cooking, Vernon came stomping down the stairs into the kitchen, looking just as irritable as ever.
Several hours later, Vernon came stomping upstairs, preparing to go to bed. Harry was still passed out on his bed, being overworked and hungry taking its toll on him. Vernon went stomping past Harry’s door heading into his own room and getting into bed. Not even 30 minutes later, Hedwig screeched, triggering a long string of language from both Vernon and Harry, as Harry jolted awake from the noise. Harry heard Vernon come stomping down the hall and he braced himself, cowering in the corner on his bed. “Keep your bloody bird quiet!” Vernon shouted as he burst through the door, stomping over to Harry and grabbing his hair roughly, forcing Harry to look at him. Harry clenched his jaw as Vernon slowly raised his fist, bracing himself for the blow. The first blow hit him right in the jaw, knocking him back. Vernon grabbed his legs and dragged him to the floor, pummeling him. Harry focused his thoughts on Hogwarts as each blow knocked the wind out of him and made his head spin with pain. After what felt like an eternity, Vernon left the room, leaving a crumpled Harry on the floor. Harry tried to sit up, but the pain in his chest was entirely too strong, and he fell back, passing out on the floor, his body at an unnatural angle.
“Sorry, Draco, so sorry, worthless, useless, stupid, waste of space, freak, burden, whore, queer…” Harry rambled on, his voice shaking. He wasn’t sure why he apologized to Draco first, but then again, he was barely there at the moment. He was aware of Draco in the room, but in his mind he was stuck in the place that caused him the most pain. He curled in on himself, pulling his knees to his chest and tucking his head down. Harry’s shoulders shook as he tried his hardest not to fall completely apart. Draco slipped off of the armchair and sat down next to Harry, wrapping his arms around him protectively. Harry stiffened at first, but soon relaxed, although he continued to shake. “Harry, it’s okay now. I’m not going to let anyone hurt you.” Draco said soothingly, running a hand through Harry’s hair and holding Harry close to him. He continued to quietly reassure Harry for what seemed like hours, before Harry finally fell asleep, still looking extremely troubled. Draco scooped Harry up and carried him to Harry’s room and tucked him into his bed, lingering for just a moment to study Harry’s features. He shook his head and mentally slapped himself for the strange fluttery feeling he got from looking at Harry. Now was simply not the time to have anything other than platonic feelings for Harry. Draco made his way back out to their little sitting area and plopped down on the couch, thoroughly confused with his feelings. Right as he was about to doze off, there was a rather loud knock at the portrait.
A/N: Hello humans~ Here’s another chapter! Major time-skip coming up since I don’t want to give away too much about what happened during the summer since that’s to be revealed at Hogwarts. Enjoy!
“Your guess is as good as mine.” George shrugged. The two stood and made their way downstairs quite noisily.
Dean x Ginny (don’t know their ship name)
“Physically, his condition terrible. He has several ribs which have been broken and have healed in funny positions due to lack of medical treatment. He’s also suffered minor damage to his skull, although I haven’t been able to tell the cause. If it had been from a Quidditch accident, I would have seen it and been able to heal it, but it seems to be from long before his Hogwarts days. He has a lot of bruising and scarring on his body, particularly on his upper back and arms. The scars on his upper back seem to be quite sensitive, as even in his unconscious state he flinched when I attempted to heal them. I did the best I could, but only the more recent ones have faded, and even then, they didn’t completely heal. I did manage to heal the fresh cuts on his arms and reduce the scarring from them, but the less recent ones are out of my healing abilities,” Pomfrey paused and gauged Draco’s reaction, which was that of shock, before continuing, “And, this is where it gets far worse, and if I hear of you telling any other students of this you will be punished severely. He seems to have suffered from intense damage to his… to his…” She broke of to regain composure. Draco glanced from her to Harry to back to her before returning his gaze to Harry.
“Answer my question.” Draco kept his voice low and kind, still a bit shocked from what he witnessed.
It was Wednesday morning when Harry finally spoke to Ginny. They were at the table alone, as Molly had gone out to tend the chickens and the twins and Ron hadn’t gotten up yet. “Ginny.” Harry’s voice was quiet as he looked across the table at her.
‘Please, Harry, why won’t you just come back? I can’t do this without you!’ Draco thought desperately, running through the rain. He had reached the cemetery gates.
“You’re absolutely mental, Ron.” George said, grimacing as he went over to Harry, who was still trying to remain as small as possible on his bed.
“I’ve been fine, how have you been?” Harry asked once he had been released from the hug.
“What is it, boy?” Vernon replied coldly.
“No, you jerk, that’s awful! I have to do it in person!” Ginny playfully glared at him.
“Harry.” She responded, giving him a sideways smile.
“Okay, Harry, be quiet, this is my moment to be sad and mopey, not yours.” She laughed.
“Of course not, Potter, and even if I did need something I would not ask someone as useless as you.” Draco shot back, the malice returning to his voice. Harry flinched at the word useless, the cold feeling crashing down on him, nearly bringing tears to his eyes. He shook his head as if shaking away the feeling before replying to Draco. “Then I’d appreciate it if you would stop staring at me. One would think you fancied me, with the way you stared.” Harry said, trying his best to sound as venomous as always, but failing. Draco just rolled his eyes and opened the curtain to stare out the window. Harry pulled his legs up onto the seat with him, and the compartment fell into silence. Draco would never admit it, but he felt a bit worried for Harry. Why was Harry acting so strangely? He hadn’t even been able to sound angry, like he always had the years before. Meanwhile, Harry was deep in his own thoughts. The cold feeling was consuming him again and loneliness was nagging at him. In the back of his head, an irritated voice continued to whisper insults at him, reminders of words screamed at him while at the Dursley’s. Harry was so deep in thought and distracted by the hideous feeling consuming him that he forgot Draco was in the compartment with him. Draco glanced at Harry every once in a while, wondering why his eyes seemed so dull, and why he seemed so… miserable.
Harry slid one leg up onto the edge, his whole body shaking. ‘I have to do this,’ Harry thought, pulling his other leg up onto the edge, so he was now kneeling on the edge. Blood dripped down his cut arm, his cuts stinging as his robes brushed against them. The blood loss made his malnourished body feel shaky and weak, and he felt extremely lightheaded. He was just about to throw himself off when strong arms grabbed him from behind and pulled him off the edge. Harry struggled against the arms. “Get off me! Go away! You saw nothing!” Harry hissed.
A/N: Welcome to yet another terrible fanfiction written by yours truly. At this point, I don’t know what I’m even trying to accomplish by putting my stories on the internet. As always, you can message me with ideas at the email listed in my about/bio/whatever you call that thingy. So, before I begin, this fic will cover some triggering topics such as abuse and depression (and a lot more later in the story), so if those bother you, don’t read! This has been your trigger warning, if you continue to read even though I have warned you, don’t come for me. I tried to warn you. I’ll be writing a fluff fic soon, so you can have something nice to read. I might change a bit as to who has died/dies so please don’t comment saying “[name] dies in [book number]“.

A/N: So, this took me forever to write and it’s not even that good, so I’m kind of disappointed with it. I really struggle to write the Weasleys, especially bad Weasleys like I’m using for this story but I’m trying my best! It’s going to take a while to get into the Drarry part since I don’t want to rush it because I want it to be as natural as possible and I need to incorporate Harry’s obvious mental scars into how he behaves. Not sure how many chapters this will end up being, but at this rate it’ll probably be 20+. Things are obviously going to get a lot darker for Harry and I will probably write about self-harm and suicidal thoughts, so if that upsets you then please don’t read. I feel like I’m always saying “don’t read if-“ but I really don’t want to upset anyone with my works. Please stay safe and my inbox is always open for those who wish to talk. Ciao for now~
Draco couldn’t wait for the day the rain would be a sunny day and give him the chance to sit out there with Harry, and maybe give him some peace.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. Of course Pomfrey had told Draco. Before Harry could reply, Pomfrey entered the room holding several potions. “Good to see you two up. Harry dear, take these potions. You’ll be free to go tomorrow, but I have to keep you under observation.” She passed the potions to Harry, who drank them quickly, grimacing at the foul taste. He had learned by now that taking the potions without complaint was far better than refusing, and consequently having them spelled into him. Pomfrey took the empty bottles. “I spoke with both Minerva and Albus about the incident and a Gryffindor student came forward about some… happenings that have gone on. Minerva had a separate room set up for you because Merlin knows where you were staying since Mr. Weasley kicked you out of the dorms.” Pomfrey stated.
His things had already been packed up, not that he ever unpacked at the Dursleys’. His trunk sat in the cupboard under the stairs with all of his school supplies, Hedwig remained in her cage in his room, and he had a small, worn backpack filled with clothes that were less disgusting than the rest. His backpack was shoved in the bottom of his wardrobe, hidden away from Vernon who would surely tear it apart if he saw it, just for the hell of it. Knowing that he was all set to depart in the morning, and that Vernon was done tormenting him for the night, Harry curled up on his bed and fell into a dreamless sleep.
