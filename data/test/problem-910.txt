It wasn’t for another two weeks that Harry felt he could go through with it. Draco’s impatient guidance in making the antivenom had been, if not chummy, entertaining. Castor was very cross about being made to bite into a thick plastic screen, shooting venom into a tiny vial. Draco had actually walked across the room to watch that from a distance.
“Will you have to start over, when you go back?”
But thanks for reading, everyone! Pls leave comments if you like it so far!
“A very dry porridge.” Draco took one of the mugs and held it between his hands. “Half-turned palourdes. An attempt at sausages, though I’m not certain it was giving me actual meat.”
The two hour game felt like ten minutes. There was so much to see: the Chasers rushing the Keepers, Beaters trying to knock them off their brooms, and the two Seekers hovering above. They were probably the most fun to watch, because they rarely moved. When they did, it was either a bluff or because they actually saw the Snitch – impossible to know and therefore always exciting.
She watched him storm out, lips pursed.
in on it, and not Ron? Why did Ron
semi-regularly and semi-thoroughly. Draco’s name would have stuck out. Ridiculously, his brain spun the possibility that the newspaper had set their sights on Draco as another one of Harry’s ‘possible paramours’. A bloody ridiculous thought.
“I’ll give you a moment.”
Explaining Quidditch took a while. Ron was almost in tears, but Hermione seemed to find some humor in it. Harry had been a Seeker, he learned. First year, too. Like his father. They talked about it for a long time, eating their reheated curry on the floor.
Harry shifted the weight of the bag on his shoulder. She was challenging him, and he hadn’t been expecting it.
Hermione gasped. “Harry,
Hermione frowned dubiously. “Teddy…we have to put that off. I can’t…We can’t do this to him.”
Draco picked his head up, eyes tracking Harry’s eyeline and just missing it. He had on his serious non-expression, but his eyes glittered with danger.
, it was jarring. The alleys grew even quieter as afternoon set in. It was nearly like having the place to himself.
Harry didn’t feel terribly useful. He mostly sat back and listened to Ron and Dean spin their theories, wondering if he could possibly weasel his way out of the pub night they had planned.
“I don’t need your
“What…fuck off. We aren’t having this conversation
“I think…I might have you to thank for that, actually.”
There was more she had said, or tried to say. Something about Dolohov, and Draco…but he’d been too upset to listen. Her words spun around his head without finding purchase anywhere. Meaningless.
“Why?”

“He said I didn’t seem that much different.”
“Why him?”
“Erm, going up?” Harry asked into the tense silence.
“Mum,” Ginny scolded through a full mouth. “Don’t be

the biggest.
“I only wanted to remember the date for their next game. I missed the last one.”
It was overwhelming, sending the darkness spiraling deeper into his lungs. Something was about to burst, and he wouldn’t survive it. Not as he was now. The voices persisted, growing in volume and speed. Stones whipping against glass that was slowly cracking. He couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t answer them, he couldn’t –
A short pause. “Yes.”
“You’re not well.”
“Jesus,” Ron shuddered, pulling his borrowed coat tight. “Wizard bars don’t have this problem, you know.”
“Martin!” Teddy snapped, groaning. “Not now!”
.” He was begging Harry to understand.
“It’s not like he could stop you,” Ron said. “Right? Is there something he could do to…prevent it?”
“Merlin,” Harry said around a bite of pickle. “Should I apologize?”
“Yeah.” Ron smiled at the memory. “It’s protected by Fidelus, so while Dumbledore was Secret-Keeper, it was the only safe place for us to be. Horrible house, but we had good times.”
“Fine. Yard rules. See that tree down there? The crooked one?”
Ron gave him a wide-eyed glance as he pressed the lift button.
“That’s all?” Draco asked. He sounded amused, which put Harry on his guard.
He knew it immediately, even as he crashed to the floor. Grimmauld Place. How…?
Ron leaned on a forearm against the wall, the back of his hand pressed against his mouth while the other gripped his wand tightly, like he thought Death Eaters were going to jump out of the woodwork. Greenbaum raised an eyebrow, unaffected.
“I should be thanking you,” Draco said, just on this side of too wry to be sincere. His mouth twisted in another empty smile. “This is perhaps the only wizarding home in London that would welcome me.”
Draco glanced at the book disdainfully and leaned to the side, draping his watch against a book spine and writing something down with a large black quill. "How could I? I haven't read it."
“You’re being hilarious, Potter. And you don’t even know it.”
“I don’t know,” she said loudly. “At least, not yet. I need more…time.”

“I don’t know why I – I shouldn’t have come here.” Draco turned and started looking for Floo powder. Harry saw his hands were shaking.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Slytherin won, but both teams were really good. You played Seeker, didn’t you?”
“You, as well,” he said, shaking Neville’s hand. “Hey.”
still sat on the coffee table, marked halfway through with a receipt from the corner store. “Trying to.”
“Remember this, love?” Molly asked Arthur, pointing out a photo of two young identical boys sat at the kitchen table, one toddler between them. “Boxing day, ’85.”
“No, Harry,” Ginny argued solemnly. “You were
“You think Malfoy has a nice arse.”
“…Yeah,” Harry said, finding it. “So we just – ?”
“I think we’ve got time.”
If the crowd didn’t react so strongly, he might have sunk through the floor in embarrassment. But they
“No, thanks,” Harry called back to the man, following after the swish of black fabric. Alright, he allowed with chagrin, perhaps Ron wasn’t as biased against Draco as he thought – at least, it seemed he was far from the only one.
Harry briefly compared this boy to the one from all the photographs. Yes, he was taller than the more recent ones. “Is there someplace we can go?”
Harry shrugged. Draco flipped the paper over, but the back was blank.
“You could be right, Harry,” Hermione cut in, wedging between them. “Though it’s much easier to believe he’s had help.”
The woman fell immediately silent.
Draco swallowed, staring straight ahead with the mug still raised in front of his face. After a long moment, he took a sip.
Draco tried to cover up surprise with an angry sneer. “I don’t need watching after.”
“Granger,” Draco said flatly, raindrops shining on his shoulders. At odds with his tone, there was a wary set to his jaw.
“You’re not holding anything,” he said, incredulous.
“And the next step is to…” he waved the slips of paper. “Do all of this?”
Harry knew, inexplicably, what that meant. Binding of the soul. An involuntary shiver went down his back and he flipped past that first page – what looked like a block of history text – and found himself looking at a list. A recipe? The potion had no name, but the bottom half of the parchment was full of footnotes.
“Don’t be dramatic, Harry. Of course you did – “
“We talked about Hogwarts last night. You remember how the houses were named after the founders? Well, Salazar Slytherin was obsessed with blood purity. Muggleborns almost never get sorted into Slytherin house. Most pureblood families always do. Like Malfoy.”
Harry ignored the rhetorical-ness of it. “Dunno. George?”
“Blast it,” Ron groaned, dropping his head to his hands.
“Be my guest.” He carefully lifted the snake and set it down. “Stay on your rock, okay?”
what I said. Things have changed.”
“Just say it, Hermione. You don’t need me. You need
It only said, in George’s manic script,
“Right.” Ron sank down beside him, knocking their knees together as he flipped the scrapbook about three pages in. “That’s their greenhouse.”
“I don’t think I’m assuming anything. I think it’s rather obvious how messed up I was – “
He held out a bowl of red and black liquorice pieces. Harry gave it a dubious look.
“Is it really Harry? How the fuck - ?”
At least, not until he stepped into the kitchen. It wasn’t a pleasant picture – the sink was full of dishes, and take out containers littered the countertops. Half empty mugs of tea sat on the little brunch table by the dark window. Among them were two large, empty bottles of firewhisky.
It was a bit much to expect Draco up and cracking, but seeing him slumped against the wall of the first landing corridor was still a shock. Harry rushed forward, crouching down in front of him and calling his name.
He nodded. They watched the tide of the crowd, and as soon as there was a break Draco’s hand tightened and the word squeezed to a pinpoint.
“I don’t know,” she yelled, “if I am saving your life or ending it! I really don’t! And the same could be said for Draco. I don’t know what more I can
“Harry?”
component. Multivitamins, Pepper-Up, Wiggenweld,
“Hmmm. Sounds alright. But what sort am I sharing this box with? I mean, I am
It was getting harder to breathe. He wouldn’t be walking anywhere for much longer.
There was a hush over the unrelated squabbles in the room. Ginny pursed her lips, pausing in her movement for a refill of whisky. In the corner of his eye, Harry saw Hermione reach over the back of the couch to take Ron’s hand.
Harry was relieved to hear that. The empty bottles had been haunting him. “His parents?”
. Y’know, so it’d be a laugh to give to your aunt at Christmas.”
All that was just the way he’d come; there were two more directions to explore. One was dark and hidden under overhangs – there were no people down that way. The other was nicer, and most importantly he could just see one extremely colorful roof above the rest. That’s where he was headed.
“And I didn’t
“Be right back,” he said, squeezing Harry’s shoulder as he ran after her.
“Yeah. Cat.”
“No wonder Ron’s furious. I reckon I should be as well.”
They reached the landing. The staircase continued above them, spiraling up underneath a white marble ceiling, painted at the center in the image of a man with a beaked, indigo bird head. In Egyptian style, the head was turned in profile. One black eye swiveled around to look at all of them.
Wrong approach. Talking down to him wouldn’t work. “You…know that mission I was on last week?”
“AND ITS FISTICUFFS ON THE QUIDDITCH PITCH.
“Have I never asked you that before?” He blurted before he could stop himself. There was no other explanation for her apparent shock.
That was only to name a few.
He glanced through every shop window on his way. Another menagerie that just sold owls, a boutique, a tailor. A store that sold muggle clothes, its sign depicting a man with a pointed hat walking through a crowd in high-waist pants and a cardigan.
“Erm.” Dean looked between them warily. “You testified. At his trial.”
him, Ronald!” His mother cried, gripping Harry with bruising force.
“Why?”
, and
Harry cleared his throat. “Ron, I…it’s a bit weird, isn’t it?”
Harry swiped his hands over the robes, looking pointedly at the bed. Draco shuffled his legs away, turning to his side, half-curled.
“You’re talking nonsense.”
“Hermione? What did she say?”
“I doubt hospitality will hold out much longer,” Ron said regretfully. “About a hundred students are hanging about the Restricted Section, and I think break-in attempts’ll reach a record high once we’re gone. It’s lucky we were even allowed inside on Ministry business.”
Harry glanced up dubiously, turning over a bag of
A hand dragged roughly along his sides. Searching. He sucked in a breath as the movement irritated the wound. “Please don’t hurt me – “
“Hagrid wrote me, as well,” Harry said, retrieving it from the sitting room table and glancing over the words again. It was certainly an interesting correspondence – but the last paragraph had given him a good panic.
George’s smirk dropped away slowly. His eyes went wide as saucers, and Harry couldn’t hold the act any longer. He snorted.
“Let’s go, Potter.”
Ron nodded shortly, looking down at the scroll.  “May I take this as evidence, or…?”
Draco’s eyebrows pinched high. “To your knowledge, he hasn’t been near London for at least eight years. Right?”
It was the first night he didn’t feel awkward in this house. So far he’d pictured himself as a guest, but that couldn’t last forever. The gradual settling part of all of this had to include accepting that this was his house, and so he allowed himself to relax a bit as late night programming played in full force. The Darjeeling was light and sweet, fogging his glasses with every sip.
“We have a lot of research in this room. Centuries of translation efforts, comprehensive histories, Egyptian mythology…Islamic literature…” he shrugged. “All of it can be requested through any university registry in the magical world.”
went unsaid. There was something horrible they still weren’t broaching.
“Something that’s been bothering me.” If he was waiting for Draco to look back up, it didn’t happen. He was glancing between an open tome and his parchment, the black quill dancing across the page..
Friga still frowned, her nostrils flaring like she could smell something. Could she? “Of course, Master Draco,” she said. “You and your guest are most welcome.”
“Wotcher,” Nevile said, nodding and smiling in that semi-nervous way he had.
The rest of their Sunday party was standing around the garden gate, watching, various drinks in hand. Ron and Charlie both had beer, Arthur a pint. Molly and Ginny were loudly arguing about something while Hermione leaned against one of the posts, every blink getting longer until it seemed she’d pitch over asleep at any second. Alcohol really did her in.
Harry smiled. “That sounds nice. Does he call you Uncle?”
She only stared at him, horrified and speechless.
“What’s this?” He asked immediately. Ron set a take-out bag on the coffee table, snickering.
“One step at a time, I suppose,” Ron said evasively. “Did Hermione say anything?”
“We can, if you feel ready. I’ll take you to your place first, to get anything you need. Then you can stay at ours.”
“Yes, well I know plenty about persecution,” she snapped. Draco went still. “How were artifacts like that not seized in the raids?”
“Mmhm.” She tilted her head toward the kitchen. “I’m half-drunk and starved. Do you have any Kraken Krisps?”
Anyone who shares the Mark is linked.” That sank in for a few moments. Élise wound her fingers together. “I think I can reverse-engineer things, and find Dolohov.”
“…sure.”
“When you were on trial, you said – “
Rosmerta tapped her nose, closing one eye. “And you, Mr. Potter!” She grinned an accusation. “Just can’t keep out of the papers, can you?”
Like she could hear what he was thinking, she suddenly looked uncomfortable. “I’ve got to ask something of you, and I’m sorry in advance, but it really must be done.”
Below the green of anti-Apparition magic was something equally complex but less familiar. Higher energy – mauve and lilac. Anti-intruder, certainly. “What does that do?”
“It’s a long story – “
Debra waited, but there was no elaboration. “Do you think he was trying to kill him?”
. Two cartoon-ish faces with spiky red hair and winking eyes looked down on him.
Freezing to the touch, naturally, despite the jumper and trousers. His legs bent up at odd angles, supporting his sitting weight as his head rested on his knees. Harry glanced at the closed parlor door and noted the horrific smell coming from within. Rotting.
The man was almost the height of the door, with heavy muscle that seemed hulking on his large frame. It was his face that stood out, though. Scars. All over, and less delicate than George’s. It made Harry think of an animal attack.
The book hitting the floor snapped him awake some time later. He sat with practiced (and forgotten) alarm. Something told him to draw his wand, but he suppressed it as he looked down at the open pages. Nothing amiss - he just nodded off like someone’s grandfather.
The work day was in full swing as he walked out on level two, everyone in their offices where they couldn’t stare. Only Madame Rashida looked at him suspiciously over her glasses.
“The Pegasus doesn’t understand what a coin might do, but says his silver horn is the most beautiful of his herd, and that the others defer to him and consider him the best.
I did ask him, when I was delivering supplies yesterday. And he…he said it won’t work, because after he’s drunk the potion, their link will be forever broken.”
Draco met Harry’s eyes. “If he did see me here last night...in
Harry shook his head. “Nothing’s changed since last night.”
them to spell out whatever the drinker is trying not to think of, but they’ll only give me the same two or three phrases.”
“It’s…worse,” he said, swiping a hand through his hair several times, pushing it back into place. He was wearing nicer robes than usual, if that was possible. But it was clear he still wasn’t sleeping. “When she has time to prepare. She knew I was in London for a bit, but…I don’t normally see her this often in a year.”
When there were maybe twenty pages left, he heard soft footsteps.
“I know.”
Teddy was getting antsy, but it wasn’t until they were walking toward the castle that Harry asked about it.
be a good person. Right?
“What’s up?” Ron asked, taking what was obviously his usual spot on the desk. Harry sat in the chair, pulling Teddy’s note from his robes.
“Because of this,” Draco said. His eyes were molten in the wandlight, bright and dark at the same time. Harry swallowed, resisting the urge to touch it. That would be pushing his luck.
“I guess you’re talking about sports,” Harry frowned.
“The Ministry won’t harm a hair on your head, Potter.”
“Sorry,” Harry said as understanding passed around the room. “What happened?”
did you call him?”
and walked inside, putting in two orders of that and one Bordeaux, which they did have. Several types. He asked what a hundred quid would get.
Harry explained what had happened at Grimmauld Place. The wand responding to him without having been asked. Hermione still looked faintly uneasy, but not surprised.
Harry nursed his tea, fascinated at George’s tone. “Why is that odd?”
Draco released him, but slowly, leaning against the headboard without pulling his feet up. “Both. Neither. Does it matter?”
Harry chuckled and rifled through the pile of mail with his free hand. “Sent this around six this morning. Right when Fleur showed up.”
“Care-
He was starting to sound excited, which was bad. Harry took a steadying breath. “I woke up in St. Mungo’s on Tuesday – “
He fell asleep with a pounding headache, Castor sidling up against him in the warmth.
That explained some of the staring at the hospital, at least. It also explained why Hermione hadn’t wanted him out and about. This wouldn’t be easy to hide…especially from Ron’s mum, who already knew something was wrong.
“What did you say?” Ginny asked, her expression going even darker. “
“No,” she said, heels snapping on the hard floor. Was that a
When he signed it, the door swung open…
After some tossing and turning, he flopped to his back and sighed again. With trepidation, and – ridiculously –
“He’s kidding, Harry,” Ginny said quickly, bashing George over the head with the end of a broom before tossing it through the air. Harry only just collected himself enough to catch it.
“I did ask,” Harry said. “You ignored me.”
Ron took the cold tea and threw back a sip. “About as often as I can stand.”
Ron swayed his head side to side like a cobra, a wordless little dance of anticipation that made Harry laugh. “Alright. For appearances.”
Hands. Tendons and skin pulled taut with the effort of what they held. Veins struck out too prominently. When they twisted, straining to break the thing between them, joints groaned like a moored ship. Knuckles broke through the tender wrapping of flesh, spraying blood. Then, a clock in reverse, the hands were healed. This time, the ear of corn cracked with a neat, dry rasp. A thousand breaths in the darkness rushed toward him.
Harry went to the fridge and pulled out one of the containers Fleur had left. It smelled vaguely of sweet potato and carrot, and matched perfectly to the color of George and Victoire's hair.

Draco painted a convincing picture. Flying above the raised stands in the largest stadium in the continent. He
“Well, you were wantin’ a pet, I thought,” Hagrid said, still carefully inching away. He sounded hurt, and Harry struggled to modulate his tone.
The woman who’d held his hand gave Harry a chagrined look from behind Ron’s back. He was relieved to see that the tears were gone.
Crouched painfully on the bathroom floor, Harry leaned back to shout through the open door. “Yes!”
was rather interesting,” she continued, with a note of challenge. “You cited Nider’s
Harry stared at the fireplace. Draco had been quite drunk during their conversation, so there was no way of knowing if it was the moon or the alcohol talking then, either. “We talked about Quidditch.”
He thought again about Draco. It was clear he wouldn’t be seeing him tonight. Ron was dead set against it – he
the Dementors.”
“Hm. And what’s a seed? Sorry, I must sound like a first year.”
“It’s not your fault.” He looked very on edge, all of a sudden. “You don’t remember doing any of it, so I don’t know why I’m - “
Of course she would deny him even this simple,
me…” Harry trailed off as Hermione started scribbling on the clipboard with a pen she’d produced. “What are you writing? Are you a doctor?”
“I do wish you’d stop that,” Harry said, sharper than intended.
“Stop it, Ron,” she crooned, without looking. Indeed, Ron had a cruppy-esque look on his own face. “There’s too many muggles in our building. Not to mention Buck. Crups are territorial.”
Harry said in surprise, yanking his hand away. “
Again, he said it like the idea was absolutely ludicrous. Everyone else made brave attempts at poker faces.
His house. Well…all this
“What – “
Ron made a face. “He’s
“Professor Sprout,” Hermione pulled her scarf down and gave the woman a half-hug, her smile wide as she looked up at the castle. “It’s been too long.”
Draco stopped just inside, looking around with a reserved expression. Silent. Unwilling to wake the portrait, Harry waved him up the stairs, and felt him stop at the door to the drawing room. Hermione stood in front of the sofas – stiff-shouldered and jaw jutted out. Such an expression should have looked silly on someone of her size, but Hermione had the potential to be very scary, he’d learned.
It was meant to be the day before, but there had been some sort of Bowtruckle infestation across the Great Lawn, courtesy of a Care of Magical Creatures class gone awry. Apparently some third years had fed one of the insects an unidentified Weasley product that had triggered mass reproduction. Mooning, indeed.
Lee snorted. “It’s started, George!”
Harry looked around, dumbstruck. They’d never bothered to ask Draco to help, instead searching out Death Eaters on their own for
A touch of wariness entered Draco’ eyes. “Doing this incorrectly…would be catastrophic. I had to prepare. Though I do admit that Dolohov’s attack moved things along for all of us.”
“Er…” The door opened a crack. “Jus’ Harry, I think, if you two don’ mind.”
“Harry?”
“Phlegm?”
“How are you doing that?” Harry asked curiously, looking for the trick. Conjuring food was difficult enough; without wand or incantation, it was impossible.
It must be destined for the Pensieve, he thought, and glanced around with new purpose. He’d never seen it in the parlor (he’d never seen a Pensieve at all, actually), and this seemed the next most likely place for it.
“We’ll know on Monday, in all in anyways,” Seamus reminded him, settling into Dean’s side and finishing off his beer. “Can we stop talking about work now? You’re turning me into a bitter drunk.”
“I need to see your library. At your family home.”
His first impression was that it was medical. There weren’t any machines or beeping, and it took him a second of looking around to realize that he was in a wizarding hospital. That must be it.
“What are you doing today?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Come with me. Molly’s making hotpot.”
After a few moments, a large red ball shot out of the shed and up toward them. She arrested it’s momentum so Harry could catch it under one arm.
“Harry,” he croaked, trying it. “I don’t like that one, either.”
Harry laughed as the Slytherins’ serpent was carried across the air by the winning team, shooting green sparks out of its mouth.
“You come down here with me quite often, Harry.”
He told her about the
A good amount of people were there. A pair of young men boisterously played a game of pinball. Every time one of them lost the ball, they were squirted with a spray that Harry could smell all the way across the room. Three boys none older than ten ran around pointing, followed by a harried looking older woman. A man around Harry’s age tried to decide between Amortentia or Beguiling Bubbles-scented perfumes.
Ron had paled noticeably. “What are you saying?”
“That explains it.” He lifted the baby up so it’s chubby feet stood on his thighs. Some drool leaked down its chin as it smiled at him, all gums and big blue eyes. “Victoire, was it?”
“That was fun. I mean, not as fun as Quidditch, but I get the sense I’m good at it, y’know? I’m relieved to actually be good at
He’d closed the book around then.
“You’re married,” Harry grit out.
She stood, gesturing for him to do the same. Then she handed him her wand. He took it hesitantly. A warm buzz of magic settled over his right arm. It didn’t feel strange at all. He must have used it before.
He never managed. Élise and Hermione – considerately – stayed sober with him. Hermione showed up late and strategically placed herself on the far side of the booth, so Ron was sandwiched between them. His loud voice and constant gesturing made it impossible for Harry to ask her any questions.
“Hogsmeade,” Ron said, bouncing on his feet with excitement. “Closest Apparition point to the school.”
“J-Just an hour.” She pushed her hair from her face, breathing hard.
He was gone.
Another world where Draco hadn’t been… a child nazi. An instrument in the hands of adult, more capable nazis. Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was talking about anymore.
He hesitated again. “Come on,” Harry said, “Don’t spare my feelings.”
“I’d like you to come in to my department this week,” she said determinedly, switching back into her formal, cold voice.
Her smile wavered. “I’ll know more after further testing.”
“You can
“And now you feel differently?”
“George has a shop?” He’d heard it mentioned, the night before, but no one had said precisely what it was.
“What does it matter?”
“What’s new?” Ron said cheerily, abandoning the seriousness of their conversation as easily as shedding a coat. “Have you still got that Gobstone set?”
Speaking took a while, the pain was so intense. A wand jabbed into his throat impatiently.
fall asleep, do you hear me?”
“Why not?”
about boomslangs.
boss.
Well.
The carpet was visible for the first time in…what looked like a very long time. Harry dragged his toes through it, pushing up the gray fibers where they had been pushed flat for so long. Pointing his wand at tea stains. He even got down on hand and knees to really thoroughly fluff, picking up stray bits of paper as he went. Hole punches, receipts, sugar quill wrappers, several aluminium bottle caps. It was worse near the bottom of the desk.
After a moment of silence, she dropped the pretense. “Oh, alright. Yes, I imagine you are.”
did. Someone who is prepared to do
Harry watched it all from George’s flat, through the gap between the window and the shop’s neon sign. He went there often, to join George during his lunch breaks. The only other opportunity he had to get out of his house was to go to the Ministry. All there was to do there was work out with Ron or Dean or Debra in the gym facilities, or sign his name on a bunch of paperwork. Hermione hadn’t asked him to come into her Department in quite some time.
“I think you look nice,” Élise said, hand pressed to her mouth. “Don’t let this ruin it!”
They drank tea in silence for a moment, listening to the wireless.
“Without a House Elf around, I think it had to improvise.”
– your office.”
“Me,” Harry corrected. “When I’m back to normal.”
They hadn’t parted in the best of moods. After that scene in the library Draco had ignored Harry until he left. That was two weeks ago.
“Geet dressed,” Harry said. “The food’s at my house.”
“He comes back every day after that, and the centaur always tells him to leave. They have some…philosophical conversations, and on the third day a pair of men ambush them from the trees. One attacks the centaur, the other the Pegasus. The centaur tries to reason with him, and gets stabbed in the heart. The man steals all the coins from his saddle bag. Pegasus gores his attacker through the stomach with his silver horn. He eats the rest of apples at his leisure, and returns to the moors to be with his herd.”
“Are you following the season?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh!” He brightened, clapping his hands together. “I’ve been getting ready to send him something, myself. A care package, if you will. Come up and see?”
He made certain Hermione was still asleep before pulling on Ron’s abandoned robe and stepping onto his front stoop. The married couple next door were on their porch, huddled under a duvet with mugs of steaming tea. The basset hound ran through the snow with glee, chasing a ball that fetched itself. Neither of them waved until he did, and they shared a look that he could see was surprised, even at a distance.
“I saw the scrapbook. It was mental.”
“Lads.”
Harry looked away from the domesticity of it all, upset by how much he believed Bill’s words. What would this picture look like when Teddy was a part of it? He couldn’t wait to find out.
Harry closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before opening them again. Teddy looked hopeful. What exactly he was hoping for, Harry had no idea. “I was having fun. That’s what happens.”
. There’s only you. Harry. And the longer you go on thinking that there’s a difference, the harder it will be to adjust when I give your memories back to you.”
The dragon-skin journal flew around the corner and into his hands. He tossed it to her.
Harry decided his outrage was obvious enough, and George wouldn’t really care either way. “Should I even ask?”
Harry tugged on his cloak. “You’re telling me not to
The feeling faded, and the man’s eyes went even wider. “Jesus, Potter. It’s really you, isn’t it?”
Draco rolled his eyes, but it wasn’t entirely unkind. “Granger asked me about it, as well. I wouldn’t expect anyone but a pureblood to have lived in a house this old. They develop a consciousness, of sorts, over the centuries.”
“I don’t even know…” he sighed, staring at the board like he was seeing something else entirely. His bright blue eyes had gone dark. “The war. Right. Well, it was…a
“I will." What else had Ginny said?
“Well, don’t tell us too quickly, Seamus,” Dean urged.
He gawked. “That I have a secret lover in the Ministry?”
“I was instructed by the Head Auror not to leave the premises.”
“You said she couldn’t know,” Teddy said, clearly excited at the prospect.
Hermione appeared before he was at the garden gate, calling his name and hurrying over with a bottle of wine.
” He snickered. “About you?”
house…”
Draco thought about it, then went to his briefcase. “Off the record?”
“I don’t
Draco fixed his eyes on Harry. “Lunar potions are notoriously difficult to master. The brewer is prone to mood swings, lack of focus, fatigue.”
Right. He should know his way around. “Here.” He pushed open the nearest door. A classroom, looked like. Disused and dusty. One narrow, glass-less window let in a whistling, groaning sound as wind blew past. Somehow it wasn’t cold.
“Where is he?” He handed her a cup and sat on the far end of the couch.
Hermione never showed, and eventually Ron called it a night, defeating Harry at Gobstones for a fifth time before knocking off. Harry released Castor from the bedroom and let him crawl about the house while he finished up with the dishes and got ready for bed.
“Yes, you can.” She gestured to the clipboard. “I’ll take your statement, of course. Should we do that now, or would you rather have your own clothes on, first?”
The bed was comfortable enough, but he wouldn’t be going back to sleep. He pulled on the same clothes from before and left the room. Dishes clinked in the kitchen, and the smell of coffee drew him in. Early morning light filtered in through the curtains.
She closed the distance, holding out one hand. Draco lifted a pale hand to shake hers once, businesslike. His mouth went a bit tight – disapproval at the smudge on her nose, perhaps. “I read over your dossier,” she noted. “It’s an ambitious project.”
He was halfway down the hall when Ron caught up.
“I thought she’d come here with you.”
“Should I be worried about this?” Harry asked, leaning into Ron’s cubicle. “I broke a camera?”
George’s mouth dropped open. “Devious. I’m impressed. Does – I mean, do you – ?”
He let the shirt fall and made to get out of the bed, but this time Ron did stop him, setting a large hand on his shoulder. Harry pushed it away roughly, noting both of their shocked expressions.
“Hogsmeade,” he explained hastily. “Magic’s all wonky here. They have to keep the students under control when they visit.”
Harry assumed he meant Butcher. “
Harry rolled his eyes. It was disconcerting, walking down a city street knowing he wasn’t alone. His instinct wanted him to slow down and keep Draco on his left, like he would if he were walking with anyone. But he couldn’t see so much as a shoe tip.
It wasn’t nearly as strong – and Harry wasn’t entirely sure of it – but his whole presentation reminded him of Fleur, a bit. If she was the most striking woman he’d ever seen, Draco was definitely the most striking man. The picture didn’t do any of it justice.
“Yep.” Seamus cast his eyes up, thinking. “That would have been his…fourteenth? It’s a big help, actually, as it’ll be one less place for them to hide. We think Dolohov must have Apparated there, with you, but got spooked before he could…well.”
“That’s…” George shook his head, physically cringing away from a real moment. “Appreciated.”
“You’re not meant to,” George snapped from the other room. “It should just…start.”

Harry moved his eyes between them, feeling a frown coming on.
your tea charmed?”
“What for?”
“No.” She’d taken off her gloves. Her bare hand was bony and dry against his as she reached out to squeeze it. “I quite agree.”
an Animagus?”
“Yeah,” Dean echoed. “All his old tricks – you’re a lamb to the slaughter.”
“What?”
That last part was unusually vulnerable, spoken in a soft, almost embarrassed tone. Her fingertips scratched over the skin of her forearm, a forgotten reflex. Bad things had happened at the Manor, but she had gotten the worst of it by far. Whatever it was now, that night cemented it as an evil place. Harry was the only one for whom the memories weren’t omnipresent.
“Guess you should head to the library, now,” he said morosely, after they’d both eaten in silence.
Harry squeezed his arm. “I was worried about
He sighed, carefully examining at the shattered piece of glass that worked as a stopper to keep the photo upright. It only reflected his own eye, so he put it back. The spell he cast on the door was simple enough that whoever tried to get in would at least know they weren’t wanted. He didn’t see a reason to take it any further than that.
“Sorry?”
The line of shops ended at an empty train station. A thin trail of smoke rose from one chimney, wafting past a large black owl sat on a gutter. Ron said the students got off here, canoeing across a lake or riding carriages up to the castle. There did seem to be a path behind the station, but their group walked on toward the trees.
“I’ll let him know. And I’ll tell him...you’re doing good. Which is a relief, by the way. You were properly devastated about him being gone.”
He rolled to his side, and he didn’t touch himself. It did nothing to stop the thoughts.
“And how do you know? Your mummy still friendly with all the sympathizers?” Ron said snidely, not missing a beat. “That really warms my heart.”
Maybe press Harry against the shelving in a different context, one with a lot more hands and eyes and mouths…and whispers.
“Right. Erm, well, what we don’t understand.” Hannah nodded to Hermione. “What the Unspeakables are interested in, is how exactly you lost your memory. How it happened, but also the extent of it. Do you understand?”
When he pulled out a chair, the cat jumped off and darted away, making him jump.
“Harry was attacked,” Ron said. “As you all know. By Dolohov.”
give you this?”
He cleared his throat. “You have an owl named Pig?”
“Uncle George’s sets have innards. If you take a piece with your queen, she rips its heart out!”
“Was it? I did make an effort.” He smiled wryly, nails digging into his palms. “What are you thinking?”
Draco screwed the cap on with his free hand. The wasp on his finger flexed its thorax, and Harry
They watched sparks shoot through the air, illuminating darting figures. Harry joined in the laughter as Ron and George almost came to blows over a misplaced
That was why, Harry realized much too late. George was absent that night, and so everyone else had free reign to talk about things they never would while he was there.
“Why doesn’t he come in?” Harry asked, watching Draco turn to look both ways, like he was waiting.
Harry didn’t bother answering, sitting on the edge of the mattress. “I’m not sure I’m up for this.”

why almost everything in my closet is black?”
“Fascinating,” Ron muttered almost begrudgingly. “So, you’ve translated them?”
His shoulder bumped the wall as Ron clapped his shoulder, leaning over the table to snag a blank memo. “What about you?”
“Not long now,” Ron said. “The holidays will be here soon.”
“No – “
“What do you mean?”
“Really. If you ever wanna talk Quidditch…or anything…you can drop by mine. I’d love to have you.”
for you? Does this have to do with - with Dolohov?”
“Harry? You home?”
money?”
“I do pay them, you know,” Draco muttered, sweeping his finger along the topmost row, looking for the Pegasus book.
“Two schools of thought emerged – magic that could insure against death. We’re all achingly familiar with the second.” He dropped his gaze, jaw tightening for a brief second before he regained control. Horcruxes, Harry thought. He’d heard enough about them, certainly – someone dividing parts of their soul into inanimate – and animate – objects. What no one really spoke about was the magic behind the act, and after the fruitless research at both Hogwarts and the Archives, he knew why.
Harry took in as much as he could, noticing the names Neville and Luna coming up quite often. Every now and then, though, he would catch George frowning at him. Not glaring, or gazing sadly, like Molly. Just frowning. The rest of the time he just looked at the grass, rarely joining in on a story.
So they were walking up Warwick Way to an Apparition point he had used before. He was being very snippy about the whole thing, like he expected Harry to make fun of him.
“What was it she was yelling at you about?”
“Both of us?” Harry ventured, suspecting he was being taunted.
He stepped under the water, letting the steam fill his lungs and force his body to relax. It was a relief to be by himself, but it was also uncomfortable. Well and truly alone, without even the company of his memories or a good sense of personality.
“No,” he said. “It’s none of
Seamus shrugged. “Ron’s yelling. She’s not.”
“Oh,” Hermione sounded surprised, and interested. “That’s…specific. But it can be done. I’ll need a – “
Harry turned. “Is she alright?”
Draco’s eyes blinked rapidly, a strange, fluttering motion. Debra frowned like she noticed, too. “That was true. I have no knowledge.”
“Tha’ you, Harry?” The front door to the cabin opened, emitting Hagrid’s massive head. “Oh, it’s the lot. Shoulda known, shoulda known…”
Victoire distracted him by coughing up a miniature explosion of potato. Directly onto his sweater. Ginny chortled as Fleur shot up.
George’s scribbling slowed to a stop again. “Todd?”
“Did you tell them yet?” She asked anxiously, stepping around the baby to stand at Ron’s side.
“How do you mean?” She asked, pen poised over the paper as she waited.
“I can’t do this right now,” Ron said tersely, turning on his heel. “Sorry, Hermione.”
“Listen to me.” She stepped closer. He stepped away. “I
“And the team owners. Ours is Melody Zeyad, and the Kestrels’ is…his name is Darragh Ryan. And the Irish President of Magic, perhaps. I’m sure you’ve met all of them at least once before. If Ron’s with you, it shouldn’t be a problem.”
“No!” Lou said, taking off his hat and holding it to his chest. “I had no – I didn’t realize. Of course, we can reschedule this, erm, meeting.”
“Snake language.” Ron’s nose wrinkled. “You and Voldemort could both speak to snakes. It’s a Horcrux thing.”
She was quite serious. Harry’s heart clenched in fear. No. Not yet. “Stop.”
“You should get it off your chest,” Harry said.
“Draco,” he muttered, sitting up on an elbow. His glasses were nowhere to be found and the pillows he’d fallen asleep on top of were squished flat. “The watch.”
“You were,” Draco allowed, dropping a dark stone into the cauldron. The potion was back to a muddy red color, the smell only barely noticeable. “Too impatient.”
because of Draco that he went to Hermione’s on Saturday morning. Using the Floo was the last thing he wanted to do, but it was too far for a walk and he didn’t know any Apparition points in South Kensington. It worked, thankfully, sending him straight to their flat without any problems.
Ron looked at his scar. “He could have done something to your head.”
At the fourth level, his hand lighted upon thick dust on the banister. Only two torches flickered dimly, the air undisturbed by any breathing thing for much longer than the rest of the house.
“The paper,” Harry breathed, almost laughing. Teddy smiled like he understood. Like it was a shared joke. Which he supposed it was. “What I’m about to tell you, Teddy, has to be a secret. You can’t tell anyone. Not even Reena.”
Draco frowned at him. “I’m sure I will. Once you’ve answered my question.”
Either Ginny was misinterpreting the energy between Hermione and Ron, or she knew something Harry didn’t.
Harry thought. And it wasn’t anything grand – the place was an antique dump.
“I’m short.
“I just finished only a little while ago. The potion is fine.”
him.”
“Don’t you think it’s a bit strange, Harry, that Dolohov somehow sent you straight to another safehouse? One that Malfoy just happened to be cursebreaking?”
Ron did it too – the touching of the hair, the straightening of the clothes. Harry had been caught, just the day previous, in the hall with a coworker in the Department – Shagworth, Head of Something-or-other. Ron had saved him from the awkward conversation with a muttered explanation about how the guy was usually an overbearing arse. He’d squeezed Harry’s hand in apology, but it just seemed much too familiar for two grown men, no matter how close.
“You had better mean
“Respectfully, mate, I disagree. And if you were yourself – “
It was fairly weathered, pale beige like the building below, but there was a mark that stood out. Just on the corner, three small scrapes, dark and slippery under his touch. Varnish.
“They’ll be talking about that one for a while,” Neville said. Harry looked over his shoulder, shrugging. There were only two unsmiling faces in the whole box.  Zabini was still at the back corner, next to a pudge older man who laughed heartily at something Professor Sprout was whispering in his ear. Zabini didn’t look particularly antagonistic. Just half-resigned to being amused.
“Obviously,” Draco drawled. He stared straight ahead, knuckles white around a bound sheaf of papers. Harry pressed for Two again to set the lift in motion. It was too short a ride for him to think of something to say. Draco didn’t exactly run off down the hall, but walked just fast enough to be two steps ahead of Harry.
Harry held up the picture. “I’m just
Ron didn’t notice Reena tagging along until they were descending one of the staircases. “Oi, who’s this?”

“Then Aunt Hermione will know what to do.”
“Yes.”
fractured. Him, and everything he was. There was a scream, some time, and a gasp. A clean sound. Pleasure turned pain.
“No, Harry, it’s fine. Actually, you – “ She stopped herself, pursing her lips while she washed the soap out. “How much have they…told you?”
She pointed her wand at the wall, and a roll of parchment unrolled itself from thin air, a quill appearing in Harry’s hand. Throwing her a doubtful look, he stepped toward it, squinting in the low light.

Ron’s mouth opened, then shut. He pulled his hands from his pockets and gestured to the table. “You remember chess?”
“He’s your godson. Your son. Teddy.”
“You can say no to anything you like, Harry. At any time. This is just giving me the right to obliviate you after.”
“No one ever said you were lucky.”
He and Élise picked at the Ploughman’s Lunch in the center of the sticky table while Debra and the other guys compensated by putting down far too much beer. The muggle pub was crowded and smoky. Oddly comforting, again, to not be stared at.
“You think he would?”
“Where’d George get off to?” Charlie asked, looking around. The seat next to him was vacant.
A step to the left. “Alphard Black. He gave gold to the runaway nephew.” The tip of his wand slid down a bracket. “Sirius Black.”

The white light flashed brighter, and a strange, floating feeling pulsed through his head.

public space in wizarding London has wards out for Dark Marks. They trip alarms, trigger Floo and Apparition closures. Even private homes have heightened protections – like the Burrow. There’s no way he could walk into Diagon Alley without someone noticing.”
Then a deeper, more absolute darkness washed over him, and he knew no more.
But Molly latched onto Harry, pulling him back into the kitchen to load him up with Tupperwared food. He tried to pass it off to the others, but they quickly caught onto him.
“I’ll talk to him,” Debra said suddenly, striding to the door.
“That you have a secret.”
No use. That about summed it up, Harry thought, observing the board.
“You do?” He asked, startled. That was a first.
“How’d you know?” He folded the shirt that had been vetoed and shoved it into a drawer.
“So you all know?” He asked, just to break the quiet. They nodded solemnly. He couldn’t look anywhere without meeting a wide pair of eyes.
“Gallahey and Seamus,” he went on with watering eyes. “Looked through some old fairy tales about Merlin. We might need to bring in some sort of literary expert, though, because when they
“Babe?” A voice called, along with the scuffling of someone kicking their shoes off. Harry relaxed. George didn’t.
George lunged up and around the table, clapping Harry on the shoulder as he tried to stand.
(See the end of the chapter for
The words were mechanical, emotionless. When he was done, Draco blinked like he was coming back to himself, and cleared his throat almost nervously. Dean frowned.
“You’re leaving this early in the day?” Harry looked back. His office door slammed shut with a spell from Ron.
“This walk gets longer every damned time,” Ron moped, face red as they climbed a steep incline. The well-trod trail bobbed and weaved over poking tree trunks. “I miss the Thestrals.”
“It’s okay,” Harry said, and it actually calmed down. “This is where I live.”
“Why? Why does it matter?”
“Sounds fun. You should go.”
But also Fred and George, found in the margins of every photo looking like they were still laughing at something one of them had said.
Up in the Owlery – an isolated tower that smelled exactly as he expected – Todrick flew down and perched on Teddy’s shoulder, nibbling affectionately at his ear until he fed him a treat.
“Enter.”
He sounded doubtful. “Yeah,” Harry snorted, ignoring the deep hope that maybe
“Oh, so he’s ‘Draco’ now?” George asked, but appeared to give it some thought. “Knocked him across the face a few times, once. I mean, he was an
“Ten.” She groaned, pushing up in to a sitting position and pinching the bridge of her nose. “Pub night?”
thank u for reading!! (fuck jk rowling)
Frustrated, Harry set the parchment down again. “I don’t follow. You think he has the first edition at the Manor?”
The thing was, so had Harry.
“Tell me a bit more about these translations, Doctor,” he asked, taking a chair.
He went to the Ministry again on Friday morning. The fountain was a jagged, abstract shape that could have been a lightning bolt, or a piece of broken mirror. A pair of women in their fifties called out his name, in the hopeful, unfamiliar way he’d come to associate with people who only knew him from the papers. They tittered when he waved, and he didn’t even care about the man in the pointed hat who took his photograph as he stepped onto the lift.
“Yes.”
Harry. This is the most irresponsible – “
Draco was quiet for a long moment, turning his head to the side. His profile was as sharp and angular as his voice. “I was talking about before. At school.”
George sat facing them, long legs crossed so he could balance the notebook. “Gentlemen, would you describe these plants to me?”
“Something wrong, boss?”
work.
he thought, wondering how he knew what it was called. He didn’t think he spoke Hindi at large.
She seemed comfortable in his house, taking the stairs two at a time and sitting cross-legged on his bed while he pulled out his newest buys. There was some light criticism, which he didn’t take as hard as he probably should have. The whole point was that
“Harry.” Ron shot up from his chair, robes billowing. “Hey.”
“Then I’ll make tea. Kitchen’s this way.”
“Oh,” Lee said, rolling his eyes so Harry could see. “Pardon me. It should just
“What’s happened?” Harry asked urgently, bringing his other hand to Draco’s arm. “Are you alright?”
“Aurors,” she said in a thick, stern brogue. Her face was severe – all thin lips and arched eyebrows. Telling her age was difficult. Clearly, she was elderly, but there was a steely set to her back and a sharp intelligence in her clear brown eyes. “I’m certain your presence here will rile my students.”
“Anything else we need to know, Doctor?”
Harry liked his smile, scary though it was. “You’re no use to anyone like this. I left you the Cloak. Go for a walk or something.” He hesitated. “Didn’t you say your friend lives in the city? Pansy?”
“Masons,” Ron interjected. “One of my muggle Uncles was a Mason. But I’ve never heard of a wizard being part of all that.”
Are you divorcing me, Hermione?”
“Ron has it. He’ll be here, soon. For now, we’ll use mine.” She walked to the center of the room and squared her shoulders. “Disarm me.”
“Erm. Alright – “
“Who’s Pansy?” He asked, which was not the most salient issue.
Teddy hadn’t really reacted when hearing Draco’s name. He seemed curious, but that was it. How much did he know? Did they even
Draco nodded, straightening up just enough to appear natural while still pressing Harry back with his shoulder. Harry didn’t dare move, even though this position was fantastically inappropriate.
“How do you know this?”
“I can’t see anything!”
, he thought to himself. How could anyone? “It’s alright.”
Dean started resetting the wards, muttering to Seamus about caverns and Warming Charm dead-zones. Ron hurriedly wrote down some directions.
“Yeah, Char,” she said. “We were talking, not yelling. You should try it sometime.”
He didn’t pull his hood back down until he was safely in his own home. Todd – Tod
“I was alone – I had been alone there for weeks. The only person who could have entered the premises was someone else with a Dark Mark. Dolohov must have been trying to get to that safehouse, but for some reason he left Potter there instead.” His eyes flashed to Harry’s face for the briefest of moments. ”I don’t care how injured he was – if he had the wherewithal to Apparate the two of them splinchlessly, then he should have killed him.”
Harry got through one page on libration before his eyes unfocused. Practice. “How much of the day do you work on that thing?”
Harry looked to see, freezing as he nearly bumped noses with the snake. Oddly, though, he wasn’t afraid. Just wary.
Draco shrugged.
It was another riddle, but Harry knew the answer, somehow. “Todrick.”
“Two months.”
Dark. Cold.
of your riddles! If this is how Ron feels all the time – ”
Every word was flat and reprimanding. Harry was a bit impressed that Ron could smile so openly.
The farther he walked, the less he felt stares directed at him. It wasn’t all that crowded just after lunchtime. The white marble steps to Gringotts sounded hollow against his feet. Or maybe that was just the way the marble echoed. Burnished bronze doors awaited him, flanked by two security wizards. They both tipped their hats to him.
She seemed quite confident, which made him feel like he was overreacting. Before he could think too hard, he signed his name. The parchment vanished the instant he lifted the quill – which also disappeared – and the door swung open.
“Yes,” Draco snapped irritably. “You
“Why did Hagrid want to see you?”
His voice wasn’t any kinder, but the tone had turned familiar. “Y – you know who I am?”
“It’s very handsome,” she assured him, cheeks darkening.
The cat lifted its head from the blanket and mewed softly, stretching and watching him move closer. Hermione rarely looked so peaceful. Dark curls were smashed between her cheek and the pillow. Her forehead was smoothed over without any of the ever-present lines of thought, making her seem younger. Smiling, he craned his neck to see what she was reading, attention captured by full-page woodblock print. A picture painted in dark lines and white relief..
Harry moved closer, sitting and reaching out for it. It
Draco stared at him in a way that suggested he wasn’t entirely listening, tilting his head to the side questioningly. Harry looked right back, enjoying what would probably be a one-time occurrence, and something Draco would heavily regret. It wasn’t as though Harry
Choosing to shop muggle was the right decision - the lack of a robe left him a bit bare, but the eyes that passed over him were disinterested and on their way to something else. His face (scar) was a scenic stop, not a destination.

He searched, futilely, for any presence in his head that might be called a
“You okay?” Harry asked him, when they stopped at the gateway door. Teddy looked up, eyes flashing to Ron.
“Hagrid,” he said, looking around for the source of Hagrid’s evident fear. “What’s going on?”
Lee laughed and shook his head, “No, but we’ve got plenty of that, if you like. Eat a few of these, and you’ll sound like a specialist. I just had three.”

Draco lifted a shoulder. “It’s a classic fable. Predates Beedle the Bard.”

spells, erm.” She stopped, appearing to think about something. “They connected certain people to certain outcomes. Athletic events, political victories, virility. Good outcomes, but also bad. They linked their enemies to undesired outcomes. Historically, the intention was represented by performing spells with the name of an enemy written backwards.”
“He’s a fucking Death Eater!” There was a flash of light, and what looked like a stinging hex flashed across the stranger’s face. He flinched back from Harry. The flame went out, leaving him blind as rain once again fell into his eyes.
Draco looked to the table. Something caught his eye, and he came closer. He pulled the bottle of wine out and examined the label, eyes and cheeks more hollowed out than before.
“I – “
Harry’s cleaning finally made its way to the home office. He made Ron take a look to show him what files or binders could be disposed of. There was no way of knowing what he had been in the middle of before the memory loss, which didn’t seem to be a problem. Ron shrugged and said it all looked Duplicated anyway. Original documents were saved in the Auror vault or filed with the Clerks on level two.
“So I do,” she shrugged, plodding down the stairs. “I’ve just waited
“Where did you find him?”
The air was unbelievably fresh, and he realized after a moment that this was his first time outside since waking up. In effect, this was the first time he
“New pet,” Harry explained, stepping back. She didn’t move until he was all the way back in the sitting room, shutting the door and pulling the hat off.
Important, he reasoned. Definitely important.
Draco, laying prone on the other side of the cauldron, didn’t move. Harry leaned over and shook his socked foot, repeating his name. He refused to be the one to tell Ron they’d lost three months of work because Harry had gotten Draco too drunk to stir.
“What the bloody hell was that?” Harry asked, bewildered and a little afraid. Ron took a deep breath and stowed his wand with a trembling hand.
“Well…er…” Hagrid bustled around, raising a gnarled, branch-like wand. “I think there were some mention…
“Whatever happened to me,” Harry started, wishing he’d thought to ask a little more about the mission. “Dra – Malfoy didn’t do it. If my word means as much as you say it does, he won’t be in any trouble, right?”
“Right.”
“Yeah. Two wars. The same mad prick, both times. You-Know-Who.”
” A large, transparent bubble expanded from the tip of her wand, floating over to the snake and enclosing it. It twisted and hissed inside, but Harry could no longer hear it. “
Ron didn’t look at him. While talking about Hermione seemed fine, this struck Harry as a different matter altogether. George and Ron didn’t, as far as Harry knew, spend much time together. Besides the odd banter over dinner, they didn’t really speak at all. George didn’t speak with any of his brothers, Harry had noticed. They certainly didn’t see him as often as Harry (both Other and Now) did. They didn’t
“’Ta. Good, erm, luck.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder and strode off. Avoiding the stares of passerby, Harry pinched some Floo into the fire and stepped inside, glancing quickly down at the first line of directions.
Harry forced his eyes away from Ron’s. “Did I?”
“It’s fine.” Harry stood, needing some air. “He’s right. I don’t.”
He wasn’t sure why he’d added any of that last half. Sheer nerves.
“Fleur said no cursing,” Harry chided, fixing the nappy adhesive despite Victoire’s squirming. “And I believe she said ‘no George’, as well.”
He kept his eyes down as he exited the bank, blinking in the sun off the white marble. After the twilight-esque darkness inside (and the

“Not quite the sort of bonding Draco is talking about, though,” she continued, rubbing her temple with one hand. “Looking into the future was pointless, to the ancient Greeks, because it didn’t exist yet. They didn’t believe in pre-determination; the future was what they made of it. These

“Here,” he said, finding the squashed Jack-O-Lantern pasty and handing it over. Teddy smiled, and it was wonderful.
“You see,” Harry went on. “All I know about myself is what others have told me. Friends, coworkers…the papers. But it’s not that simple. There are things I think they don’t want to say. Or can’t. So I wanted to ask you.”
Ron’s sympathy caught Harry even further by surprise. “There are House Elves there. Taking care of the house?”

Ron paused in his swigging of his own. “I…wouldn’t go

he wrote at the end.
Her laugh was wet. “It’s not your fault.”
The restaurant, when he found it, was…quaint. Surprisingly so. The name of it was hand-painted on a clapboard sign, a cardboard standee holding the night’s menu. Harry found the
“Of course I did. It was…” he shrugged. “Incredible.”
Her eyebrows came together almost disapprovingly as she drew her hand back. The steady shrewdness reminded him of Hermione – he was being very carefully examined. For what, he didn’t know. He nearly just asked where Teddy was. She started walking before he could.
Ron laughed, easily slipping into a story about their first day in Transfiguration. It was laden with warmth and familiarity, like he’d told it a thousand times. Maybe to Teddy. They’d been late – a concept he now found horrifying, after meeting her.
“Thanks,” Harry said, relieved – and disappointed he was so rubbish at feeding. “She said…It seems like he's looking at all of this as an
Ron glanced at Draco. Hermione wasn’t bothering to whisper. “It’d be hard to prove. Not very many pureblood families actually live in London.”
“None of that, now. Stay awake.” He muttered something quietly into the tip of his wand, then pointed it at the sky. Bright white light. A vague, birdlike shape shot up and away, flashing over the treetops.
Draco nodded, looking faintly disappointed. “The ingredients I need should be coming in tomorrow, though with Weasley in charge I’m sure at least one thing will be missing. With any luck I can start brewing before moonrise Thursday.”
the snake hissed back, turning its face towards Harry. “
Did he quietly obey, or was he loud and cantankerous like Ron’s family? Did he like ice cream? Eat his greens? Was he aware of this darkness that bled into every other aspect of Harry’s life? Harry hoped not. He hoped he’d kept it hidden away.
“Have you been flying yet?”
Mahmoud looked at Ron over his glasses, interested but clearly focusing on the task at hand. “When the magical and the mystical were one and the same, these organizations were for wizards and non-magicals to share thoughts on science, art, and mathematics. It was the belief that wizards disengaged sometime in the fifteenth century. The spread of this specific type of magic proves the opposite, going as far back as, at least, the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.”
Harry realized, as warmth spread through his chest that had nothing to do with the tea, that he’d like that very much. “I – sure.”
“P-please.” His own voice was hoarse and ragged. “Please – you have to help me.”
Everyone but Harry groaned. “Where are those?” He asked curiously.
There were new names thrown in here and there. A Neville, a Luna, a Michael. Dean and Seamus and Cho. And Malfoy, too. He was
Only instead of Two, when he pulled his wand away it read 2 ½ . The doors slid back open, and the reception area was gone. In its place was a big, empty space. The floor was a dark wood, the walls bronze and shining. Some charmed windows spilled sunlight inside, making everything glow.
“No’ like
to the Ministry any other way. The staring still happened as he stepped into the atrium, but he felt a bit more sure of himself today. He kept his back straight as he strode across the atrium floor, glancing at the fountain. The golden blob was an owl, today, wings spread in flight. It wasn’t visibly attached to the floor, but water trickled from its gilded feathers in a steady, clear stream.
. We might as well have him working in there, if it’s all semi-temporary. I certainly don’t need it.”
“Well, they’re fine, for tonight.” There was a creaking sound. When he turned back round she was laying back on his pillows, arms spread. “You didn’t go to the Appleby game.”
“He’s working with us,” Harry mumbled, sticking his finger in the hot tea and swirling it. The letters came right back. “Is
She feinted toward him, laughing harder when he moved away. “But you’ve forgotten all my weak points, haven’t you?”
want to go into that house. Something in the air seemed wrong. Evil. There was no way for him to know that, but his gut advised strongly in walking the exact opposite direction.
A heavy-set black man rounded the corner. He must have just taken his robes off, because the short-sleeved polo wasn’t at all right for the weather. Short dreadlocks were stuck out from a knot on the back of his head.
“Can’t say.” She took his arm again, pulling him back toward the lift he’d
transfer!”
“Do you know what this is?” She asked drawing his attention by unbuttoning the top of her blouse. Balancing her tea with one hand, she drew out a thick gold chain. A pendant hung from it, either very heavy or highlighting her current weakness.
“Hasn’t been like this in a long time,” Bill said, wistful. “Everyone together.
“Before,” Debra folded her hands on the table. “You said you had no knowledge of what could have been done to erase all of Harry’s memories.”
He turned pale, suspicious eyes on Hermione. “So, Potter has manners. Was there brain damage to assist the memory loss?”
Ron’s chair scraped back, and he leaned his hip against the counter next to Harry. Very close. Really intimately close. “You did put in effort. More than most.”
“It’s not your mum I’m worried about,” Hermione muttered, ignoring him.
Harry
The air that filtered out smelled of book binding and old parchment. He got a pretty strong sense of magic that must have been the Archiving spells.
He found it ridiculous that their old school houses could have such an impact on their lives. Ron and his family obviously favored Gryffindor colors (which could be excused, as their collective ginger really limited the available clothing options). Harry owned more red and maroon than any brown man ought to, and this house! Along with the china, it all screamed Slytherin. There were other colors, yes. Quite an array. But with notable absences. The reds were either dull (like the Persian bedspread on one of the guest rooms he’d looked into) or bright (the kitchen walls). Never exactly maroon. The blues, and there were a lot of them, were powdery. Never quite Ravenclaw’s electric turquoise. Conscious decisions made, at some point, by one of Draco’s ancestors. And Teddy’s, he realized as an afterthought.
“Not at all. I need to talk with you about something.”
Finally, she stopped pretending to read. The paper crumpled just slightly under her fingers.
She looked vaguely proud of that.
“You can just speak into the tip, Mr. Potter.”
, so why weren’t they more interested in that?
“Christ, Mother,” Ginny groused, pushing their water glasses out of the way as a heavy plate was sat down. Potatoes and roast. It smelled amazing.
“Should I send him something? Besides just money?” He looked up, frowning. “
Ron cast a slowing hex at it, which only barely worked. The black smoke grew thicker as he all but dragged Harry into the slowly opening lift door.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, charmed in spite of himself. At least no one was taking his picture. “I think I have time for one autograph.”
Draco shook his head, laughed, and then got serious. The wistfulness returned, and then deepened into what looked like genuine sadness. “Do you promise, Potter?”
Horribly guilty for whatever he’d said to cause
“Getting on.” George literally scratched his head, unable to comprehend it. “Huh. Alright.”
using a pen instead of a quill.”
She exhaled and looked down. “Nothing. I looked into the citation, and…the page numbers he cited had nothing to do with what he was talking about in the prospectus. A certain aspect of the Binding process…or Unbinding, I should say. I looked it up, and a first edition of the text was taken off the market forty-five years ago. I have a good idea of where it must have ended up.”
“Not exactly. I wanted to get Teddy something. To send back with his letter.”
“That’s just left over from last time. Don’t worry – you agreed to it. Today will just be…oh, I suppose questioning. Diagnostic magic. That sort of thing.”
Harry could definitely believe that. They descended into a grand sort of entrance hall with ceilings maybe three times the height of Gringotts. A few ghosts were gathered in a high corner. One of them, a young women in lavish, translucent fabrics, waved morosely in his direction. He raised his hand in return.
“You’re decent,” he said in a strained tone.
second it took for logic to overtake wine.
After he came, an intense, fleeting elation, Harry wondered where those words in particular came from. Draco hadn’t said anything like that to him, but it was Draco’s voice in his head. He was sure he must have heard it, and forgotten or something.
A new line of words appeared, written by an invisible hand.
Teddy saluted him, suppressing laughter.
“You look like you’re dying.”
Harry didn’t feel like that was aimed at him, so he didn’t answer. Hermione walked over and hugged Harry tightly. He hugged back automatically. When she reached over and sharply tugged at Ron’s arm, he reluctantly stepped forward and put an awkward arm around Harry, too.
trustworthy enough, I don’t mind your telling him.”
“One time thing,” George assured, squeezing his shoulder. “Promise. It’s not every day you have a Harry Potter at your disposal, though. I had to give it a try. Breakfast?”
He was exactly as weird about it as Ron had been. “You two just look alike. It’s almost like you’re brothers, or something.”
. And let the pieces fall. At least, when he did get his memories back, he couldn’t go back to this forced isolation. It seemed unlikely that Ron would care.
“Like, you’re here all day with that snake - “
It had been a feat, avoiding the shopkeep’s questions about what sort of snake he had, but he managed. Something nudged his bare ankle, and he enjoyed a white-hot moment of panic. But the snake was only curling through his legs, toward the rock.
“Nothing,” Teddy said, shaking his head a bit. “Forget it.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “What, you mean when we didn’t talk? I don’t have much to compare it to, but you’re quite obnoxious yourself.”
“Depends on what batch these are,” Lee shrugged. Harry had a question or two, but his mouth had been sealed shut.
“Well.” She glanced down at his clothes. “If I didn’t know better, I might believe them.”
“He’s your best friend, Harry.” She waved her ring finger. “And my husband. So I feel I have the authority to apologize for his behavior.”
liked what he bought.
Castor hissed. Harry rolled his eyes, but appreciated the warning.
“We’ve been so worried,” Mrs. Weasley complained, levitating a forgotten piece of bread to his plate. “Imagine poor Teddy having to hear – “
He rolled his eyes at the finger quotes. “Mmhm.”
If they weren’t standing so close, he wouldn’t have seen her eyes flick up to stare at his scar for the briefest of moments. “If you can’t name it, tell me what it does.”
In the clutches of death, Potter took a strange comfort from this man’s smile. It was unhappy, turned down at the corners, but it wasn’t unwelcome. “Potter…isn’t a very good name, is it? What…”
,” she yelled right back. “What it is
Harry only half listened, getting a better look at the sitting room as they walked past. It was the loveliest place he’d ever seen; misshapen chairs and two couches took up most of the space, a low fire still crackled, and an old record player sat waiting, the needle just hovering over a black vinyl.
“Yeah. Well, that’s just one of the reasons. But...” Ron shook his head and tapped the report again. “Did you read this?”
The question caught Harry by surprise. “I mean, nice? Posh as fuck. All that. But also…empty?”
“Relax, mate,” Ron said with a forced cheeriness, reaching around to gently pull the elastic from Harry’s hair. It was such an intimate gesture that Harry froze, surprised. Ron didn’t seem to notice. He fluffed Harry’s curls a bit, at some invisible point deciding they looked good enough. “At least the food’ll be good.”
It was only Hermione. Not much of a comfort, but she didn’t appear to have come to argue with him, because Ron came in after her, the both of them in sweatpants and jumpers.
“Well…” he exhaled, taking the wooden chair next to her, turning it to put a bit of space between their knees. There was a void where he’d come to expect Ron answering for him. “I don’t think they have anything concrete. We know Dolohov did this to me.”
But Teddy didn’t seem to be listening. Without his friends around, he’d been quiet, walking very close to Harry’s side with his eyes on his feet.
“I’m fully aware of the advantages,” she dismissed, waving a hand. “It’s my understanding that the endeavor was your idea.”
Even then, as entrenched in exhaustion as he was, Draco schooled his expression well. Harry had no idea what sort of reaction he had provoked. He was tired, though, of pretending he hadn’t noticed.
“Everyone else seems to think the opposite. You certainly do – it’s like I never smiled, before. Or laughed, or treated any of my co-workers with any sort of respect – “
Ron gave him an uncomprehending frown.
Ron didn’t seem capable of acting anything less than completely normal. Which meant she wasn’t telling him whatever it was that scared her. Harry held firm to his policy of simply not asking.
“Those aren’t like…like Giggle Gummies, are they?”
“You look like shit,” he said as she tilted onto the couch. Buck hopped up onto her lap, nosing at her hands for a pat.
It’s in Covent Garden. Take muggle coin.”
“I dunno! It just seems like me and Ron have a very…
He’d slipped into the ridiculous announcer’s voice again. “You want to send broccoli flavored sweets?”
“He’s here.”
He closed it back up and tried the third door. This room was messier than anything yet. A desk took up half of it, but the floor was covered with piles of paper and books. The nearest binder he could read was intimidatingly large.
It was an utter relief to be alone. He thought it with no small amount of guilt, but the air seemed fresher as he walked home. Did socializing exhaust him this much before? Maybe it was easier when he knew what they were talking about. Either way, this was much nicer.
He gazed at Seamus as he said it, and winked.
Harry thought of the owl that had come to his house earlier in the week with two tickets inside – Appleby Arrows vs. the Ballycastle Bats. The very next Friday.
“You’re having me on.”
it read underneath.
. He had to believe that right now.
This silence was loaded. Ron gripped his fork without actually using it. “We’ll have to start from the beginning,” he realized, sounding baffled. His freckles stood out as he went pale. “We have to tell him
Harry blinked. “Have you
She flinched, arm tightening in his. “I wouldn’t recommend re-introducing your memories like that. It might do more harm than good.”
Her face turned very vacant for a second, and Ron’s face went hard. He pressed a rough kiss to her head and glanced at the clock. It was three in the morning.
“I’ve got to get to work. See to it he takes those potions.”
“You’re cooking. You’ve
see you last night, make sure you stay hidden.”
She frowned at something. “You never told me you did, and I assumed you just got rid of it.”
His voice was loud, friendlier than it had been last night. Harry let his eyes go wide, stepping in and speaking in a hushed tone.
“I don’t think I’d get a very truthful answer.”
Harry nodded. “I do.”
there. Like I’d lost you, too.”
He and Hermione Apparated to Grimmauld Place after he Flooed home to change into jeans and trainers. Number Twelve managed to look even more menacing than it had on Sunday.
Ron looked at Harry’s forehead.
Draco only raised an eyebrow before rolling over and jerking the cover over his head.
“No need. I’ll go talk to her myself. Thank you.”
“International Magical Cooperation,” Ron explained, then gave him a considering side-eye. “Alright lot, them. I wasn’t planning on going out, but… If you feel up for it…”
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was still open, but Mel was beginning to usher people out. She gave Harry a half-eyeroll that he took to mean
“Who? Neville?” Seamus shuddered against the cold as he walked over.
Hermione swiveled, sharp and startled. Another one of those seemingly inane questions that had more weight than he was aware of. “Fourth floor,” she said, biting her lip again. "You’ll know it.”
“Care to translate any of that for me?”
Harry glanced at the Floo canister. He was used to her talking nonsense, but maybe a trip to St. Mungo’s was needed.
Harry caught sight of a few women in Healer’s robes walking past before the door closed again, leaving him alone. That had been awkward. He got the feeling there was a lot more of it coming. Surely his family would be here, soon. Maybe that’s who she was? A sister, or a sister-in-law.
The fireplace had been long fixed, so Harry had no lucky pretense for dropping in. He had half a mind to Apparate to the street and knock on the front door, but the parlor was a relatively public space, wasn’t it? It wouldn’t be like Flooing into a bedroom, for example.
out to old historical landmarks. Castles and stuff. Turns out, their magic can fix almost
He still hadn’t moved. His foot was between Harry’s, one hip digging to his side. Harry kept his hands balled into fists, counting down from ten until finally Draco inhaled sharply and moved away, replacing the original book and tucking the duplicate under his arm.
“The Weasleys do a dinner every Sunday.”
“Search me.”
“So you’ll just Floo to the Leaky,” he told Harry anyway, walking him down to the fireplaces. “Walk left to the alley, and tap your wand to the brick. You do remember your address? So you can get home?”
side, and then she stayed at that boss’ house until Ron had gotten over himself.
She nodded. “Not our jurisdiction, anyhow. I’ll try and get a better look near the entrance – be back.”
Draco checked the potion, and then the stopwatch. Neither required his attention, thankfully. Harry wasn’t sure that his state of inebriation lent itself to detailed potion work.
If one compartment was magicked, perhaps the other variously-shaped cabinets were, as well. Maybe one of them even had…jam. Perfect. Unmarked, which was strange, and cold to the touch. There was a box of tea nestled right next to it, and both smelled of strawberry.
“Probably. Forgotten what?”
“After the war, which was your fight, the Ministry went through…serious reform. Very few of us kept our jobs, or even wanted to stay.” Her face darkened. “Our fight was with the Dementors. They were a big problem. They stopped attacking civilians, but no one was going to forget what they did. So, we corralled them in Azkaban, while it was empty. No one knew how to…kill them. Not permanently.”
“Cruciatus,” he answered promptly. “Imperius, and…and…”
me to get out of a meeting?”
George slipped off to the kitchen. It sounded like he was cooking, which Harry wasn’t entirely sure he trusted. He shed his robes and sat across from Lee. At least
“I assume he’s given us information about the men we’re looking for.”
He caught Harry staring, raising the knife threateningly.
Harry made a dubious sound. Draco answered it with an annoyed one.
She fit it neatly into what little space was left in the heavy tote, then fixed her scarf around her neck. “Full moon’s Wednesday.”
“That’s a memory,” he said. “How - ?”
“Erm,
“Who I am,” Harry said. "In the most general sense."
“Oh,” Fleur cooed, wiping at the baby’s mouth with a napkin. “How will you ever forgive me for marrying into zis English family?”
Lee chewed a thumbnail. “Alive?”
She zipped the bag and stepped closer, eyebrows coming together in sympathy. “Mourning.”
“Are you punishing me for something, Potter?”
Harry wondered over that statement, breathing a little hard at the exertion. Too hard, perhaps. Some of his stomach muscles were noticeably faded already at the lack of exercise. “You can’t Apparate into the school?”
“No.” He walked around the long table, hands in his pockets as he turned to shuffle past Harry in the limited space. “It’s all you asked for.”
“Well,” she sniffed, disdain coloring her tone. “She’s always saying that sort of thing to me. Though usually she’s read my palm first.”
Lupin. Harry sucked in a breath, a sudden weight in his stomach he couldn't easily identify. "Teddy's father."
“Calm down,” Harry tutted to the both of them, pulling the string free and peering at the paper. “Oh, bloody – is he fucking joking?”
lift, but kept quiet. He knew if he started talking again he wouldn’t be able to stop. “Why don’t you go talk yourself out of it?”
At the same instant, a section of what he had assumed to be wall turned and caught him in a bone-crushing hug. His face was smushed against a scratchy beard that smelled of smoke and manure.
“How goes it, Harry?” Ron’s father smiled down at him.
“OW!” She screamed, clutching her chest and zooming to the ground. “THAT ONE HIT ME IN THE TIT, YOU IDIOT!”
“Emergency. You never know when you’ll need a quick exit.”
Malfoy. Merlin-knows-
“Yeah,” he agreed. “It feels too easy.”
“Are you still holding Draco?”
“Right.” Harry sounded relieved, which made Draco frown. “See you later, then.”
Under Draco’s pale stare, Harry felt more than a little unbalanced. He gave Ron a look for throwing him under the bus.
A glimmer, to his left. Harry fell to his knees, feeling around the ground until he found something soft. Draco. The Cloak yanked away easily, caught only beneath his body and not a wayward block of cement, as he feared.
The staff box was more of a mixture, but only barely. Harry saw Zabini at the far end, talking to a blonde woman. The other professors he couldn’t name, except for Minerva at the front, next to two students. One was in plain black robes, the other all in red with matching, firetruck colored hair. Harry made a move towards them.
“Morning,” he said, trying not to startle Hermione. She stood over the stove, already dressed for the day in black robes. The fabric was interesting, catching purple in the light. “You look nice.”
out – and a player comes out of nowhere. You don’t even know that it’s a Beater, or that he’s concussed. All you know is that he’s going for the Snitch and they haven’t called out of bounds yet. All eyes in the stadium are on you – wouldn’t you go for a bit of drama?”
They went up three separate staircases that either made quick turns while they were on –  leaving them to grasp at the rails
“Are you absolutely sure, Harry? Can you say with a hundred percent certainty that you were in your right mind, with your memories gone and your stomach sliced open?”
tied his hands without knocking him over. Harry used the silence to undo the tongue-locking curse on himself.
“Painfully,” Draco muttered, rubbing his temple gingerly.
It was early, not business hours yet. Some shoppers milled by the exterior windows, and there was no one behind the front desk.
“Yeah. It’d be a right laugh.” Harry raised an eyebrow.
“And I don’t
Hermione!” He snapped, voice rising as she drew all of his pent up frustration toward her into the open. “I’m sick to
“I know that everyone has plenty of reason not to trust him. I do. But none of it seems to justify letting this go on. If he can help, which he claims he can, then I don’t see a reason to turn him away. I think a lot of this was just – just petty rivalry. I mean, we’re adults, aren’t we? It feels wrong to go on blaming him for any of this when I know it’s not his fault. This time, anyway.”
Harry laughed, which nearly made him choke on the last of the candy as he swallowed.  “What do you do for a living?”
“Not anymore.”
, so he waited for the next and all but threw himself out.

Harry didn’t pay it too much mind. If he and George had some kind of problem, he would just have to bring it up himself. Harry certainly wasn’t going to.
but Hermione taller than him? – that made him feel quite small walking between her and Ron. He just hoped she was alright being accused of having secretly married him.
Harry started to panic. “Where is he? What have you done with him?”
Hermione sighed. “It’s complicated, Harry. In the war…”
that. “Nothing that serious.”
A card had been strategically placed over the
“Yeah…something you started. After.”
Harry gave him a look. “I’m not going to sleep. No offense, but you look like you need it much more than I do.”
“Pardon?”
Harry crept forward, getting down on his knees to look under the armchair, where the snake had curled in on itself. Green scales glinted as it shifted to watch him right back.
Harry nodded, relieved he wasn’t completely off-base. “When is he coming in?”
Draco did raise his wand, finally, to draw down another china plate. While Harry adjusted his weird-ometer (George would be hard-pressed to best this one), he moved close again, sitting on the long bench. The eggs didn’t need any assistance, it seemed. After a moment of watching them move around on their own, Harry sat down, too. “What else can it do?” He asked.
“Erm. No.” Ron didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands. He crossed them, then held them at his sides before settling on pockets.
“Step back, Malfoy. I’ll curse your ears clean off – “
Todrick flapped his wings once, making a friendly sound, then Harry was leaning away from the rush of feathers as he swooped outside. Relief was short lived. That was just one problem out of his way, and hardly the last. There was the matter of the forgotten…person. Less than a boyfriend, it seemed. Serious enough that he’d told George.
“It’s a secret!” Harry defended, standing to dump his tea. “This is the last time I have breakfast at
The weather stayed humid and drizzling, never quite warm enough to forgo a jumper. Hermione was distant. They obviously spent their mornings together, behind that mysterious black door, but aside from that she kept busy, ushering him into the lift right after Obliviating him. Remembering owl's name had only seemed to consternate her more. She never let on as to why.
He sat Draco on the edge of it, glancing around. No personal effects. Those must all be in the parlor. “Are you hungry? Thirsty?”
So what did it say, he wondered, that she didn’t ask him about the secret Draco had alluded to? Furthermore, why had she failed to inform him of the Floo connecting to Harry’s? She also hadn’t questioned his decision to let Draco stay at Grimmauld Place. Not once.
“So what was the point?” He asked.
. Like it might sprawl on forever, pulled straight from old story book. The kind where magic wasn’t wands and incantations but something airborne. Breathed and imbibed. Despite the hour – and weather – many little cloaked figures strolled around the browning lawns. Some walked. Some threw what looked like frisbees.
Ron laughed, falling to his knees. The dog threw itself against his chest, straining up on its bag legs to lick at his chin. Two tails – one light brown, one pure white – wagged wildly as Ron lifted him into his arms. “He was just a cruppy when we saw him last.”
Disappointment crashed over him. These people were lovely. They treated him like a part of the family, and despite the situation, the staring was at a minimum. They were taking it in stride. Making an effort include him like nothing had changed at all.
“What’s this?” He stepped forward, looking at the blurry, unmoving photograph of a bald man. Underneath it was a series of papers, some typed out and some handwritten.
Harry drew closer, confused at his interest. He tried handing Draco the third container, but got waved off.
Just as Harry closed his fingers around it, the watch flew through them and into Draco’s hand. The alarm went silent.
“What are you doing? Hm?” Draco exhaled a laugh, oblivious to what Harry was thinking.  “Whatever this…experiment of yours is meant to prove, you won’t thank yourself for it.”
“I mean, it’s problematic,” Draco said. “Centaurs aren’t beasts, like this story implies. Times have changed.”
“I’ll leave early,” Harry offered. Ron was technically doing both Harry’s work and his own to keep up the appearance that Harry was still Head Auror, and his relative niceness to Draco the day before had Harry thinking the stress was getting to him. Besides, it was nice to have something important to see to. “Me and Hermione’ll check it out before he gets there. Make sure nothing too important got left behind by the Order.”
“No!” Dean said quickly. “It’s fine, you’re just sober is all.”
“You have my proposal,” Draco said loftily, ignoring the bewildered looks from the other Aurors. “Explaining further would be a waste of my time. And if you intend on maintaining this charade, I suggest you keep your wayward Head Auror on a leash. He just tried to
Three wasp-like bugs of a dangerous red color. They buzzed around incessantly, slamming into the side of the glass and emitting burps of black gas when they did.
“Why the bloody
Castor hissed writhing wildly. Harry, shocked, dumped him and felt at his cheek. Not a bite, thank Merlin. Castor had only head-butted him. His tail disappeared beneath the armchair as Harry pulled window open for Pig, who fluttered madly before settling on his shoulder and sticking a note against his cheek, like he’d seen what had happened and was trying to offer comfort.
“Did you tell her we were coming?”
“How hard is it to find
“Why didn’t you tell them?” Draco’s voice was soft, confused. He looked down where his hand was on Harry, jaw clenched.  “Legilimens. It’s illegal.”
The curtains were open, sun brightening the parlor and gleaming off Draco’s hair. He was cross-legged on the floor, robes fanning out around and a book open on his knee. The burner plate was lit with a purple flame, boiling the potion that was now a watery pink. It smelled the same, but a bit less strong.
“Uncle Ron!” Teddy scrambled to his feet to throw his arms around Ron’s middle.
Well, George certainly topped the weirdness with every conversation. “Why would a centaur need sickles?” Harry wondered, pulling items from the pantry.
“My magic don’t lie,” George interrupted. “
You want me to go back?”
"Which one would you say was more real?” It felt a bit dirty, pressing his advantage like this. He wouldn't feel the need if she hadn't been running away from him all week.
“You heard Draco,” she sniffed. “We should go on as we were before. I can take care of myself.”
, looking at the pansies. What he said was, “Perennial
She shrugged, watching a lone muggle pass them by with a glint of suspicion. “They didn’t say if the stolen records were personal or not. I’m not sure there’ll be much for us to do here – not that I would have turned down your help. Having Harry Potter along should smooth the process.”
“It doesn’t work like that.”
Hermione made a noise of desperate frustration, pulling her wand to cast a Stinging Hex. The journal fell out of his hands. He kicked it so hard it flew against the wall.
“It was in a letter. From Teddy. I found it in my room.”
“Yeah, but – “ But Fleur was allowed to know, he almost pointed out. Instead, he teased. “I mean, if
“Oh!” Ron cackled. “We didn’t mention that one yet. The goblins haven’t forgotten we broke in and stole their dragon.”
“He’s not allowed to owl us directly anymore.” Élise’s deep red-painted lips pulled into an admiring smile. “That’s when the chicken showed up.”
“Well…I wouldn’t guess that it would be an easy wand to work with, with someone else having mastered it. Unless you allowed him to win it back from you. But clearly, you think you’re still the master?”
“One of my teammates needed new gloves. We shop at Side Ward over by Bond. I saw you did some shopping, as well.” She kicked out with one foot, rocking the bin back and forth. His shopping bags from the day before stuck out from the top.
There was a ripple as many of them cupped their hands to their mouths as they yelled.
There was a knock at his bathroom door when he was in the shower later that day. Night, in fact, so he was more than alarmed.

The rug was hideous, and very obviously ancient. Dark, aged spots discolored the oriental patterns. The other furnishings were nicer. A couch, a few comfortable-looking chairs, and a television set. It looked less lived in than he would have hoped. There was no glaring, blinking neon sign that told him anything significant about the person he was.
candies, thinking she’d be interested.
Draco froze, one of the books toppling to the floor. Not exactly the reaction Harry had hoped for, but one he might be able to work with.
“Not now, Seamus,” Dean called, voice dripping with innuendo. “Harry’s in here.”
“I have a signed Quaffle in my bedroom back home,” he said. The conversation had led him back, slumped against a chair with his legs askew. He balanced the wine bottle on one knee, tipping its weight side to side. Harry had wedged one of the pillows behind him to do the same. He wasn’t drunk, but the fumes and company made him a little lightheaded. Contact high.
The door opened a mite further. Harry slipped inside.
Her wide eyes blinked once. “You are not working?”
He pulled his head in, nodding for Ron to take a look. “See that there?”
The student next to Teddy jumped to her feet, bending to whisper something in Minerva’s ear. She pursed her lips, and after giving Harry a very amused look, nodded. The girl – Asian features, spiky black hair cut in what he would hazard to call a mullet – squeezed around Teddy, holding out her wand.
Ron looked like he might laugh. “You’re all set, trust me. I think he’d like something from George’s shop, though.”
“Isla Black,” Draco said, suddenly beside him. He cast his own
“I still own it?”

Harry shifted uneasily. “Talking to snakes, I can only just get my head around. A
The questioning ended when the lock to the front door turned. Harry paused in his attempt of drawing a Hodag in the air.
“Of course I haven’t. He’d be the first person I told!”
“I visited her this past week,” Ginny said. “Just tea, didn’t make it up to the school. She asked after you.”
Draco sat on the other sofa, leaning forward like a perched bird, eyes wide and staring in a way that suggested sleep had never come. Light still came predominantly from the fire, but the curtains behind Harry let in the faintest bit of morning at their edges.
Ron grimaced. “No need to worry. Yet. I think you wrote him the day of the mission. He won’t know anything’s amiss.”
“Yesterday,” she nodded. “For you.”
The flickering fire light wasn’t good enough. Harry had to squint and cast a
“Nothing at all.”
“I’m – I’m sorry. That was too – “
“You will tell me,” he said. “If I do this for you, you
It was an office, Harry saw over his shoulder. Full to the brim with Wheezes merchandize in varying states of packaging. And a man - wearing official looking robes and a towering hat. Not quite as towering as his thunderous expression, which quickly melted into shock as he saw Harry.
“This cloak. I drove myself mad as a second year trying to figure out how you were always out after curfew and never getting caught. I just assumed the staff allowed you to break the rules out of adoration.”

The smell of food had been spreading through the flat as they spoke, and Harry tried not to run when Hermione called for them to come eat. He was

Harry read aloud. “Is this a bedtime story?”
A small elderly woman smiled at him as he walked past, going down the only hall available.
He lifted her wand and opened his mouth. Every part of him seemed to know exactly what to do, except there was no word. There was a spell, he knew, but he couldn’t recall it. To cover for the err in memory, he tried the next thing he could think of.

“Yeah,” Ron said, tucking his hand into his pocket in a casual gesture that Harry noticed Greenbaum mirroring. Checking for the shape of their wands in their waistbands. Always on the offensive. “Hermione looked into an education – sorry, that’s my wife – “
She brushed her cheek with the back of her hand, staring out the window with one knuckle pressed to her lips. "If I could just figure this out...if it wasn't taking so long, then you wouldn't have had to - "
George shook his head. “Please, Lou, it’s only Harry. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind being the one to reschedule. Though he is
“Malfoy,” she replied, just as emotionless. Not Draco, any longer, but Malfoy.
“What’s the matter?”
He didn’t think these had been made by him. There was a crafty, considered touch to the organization of the photos. The first book almost entirely belonged to Teddy. From toddler to Hogwarts letter, his life had been catalogued. One picture had gotten him stuck for almost ten entire minutes, unable to look away. Him and Teddy – somewhere between three and five – asleep together on Hermione’s couch. Teddy’s small form was sprawled across Harry’s chest, on hand fisted against his chin.
jinx flew past his ear, slamming ineffectively against the portrait. It only seemed to enrage the occupant.
And this. She was standing so close to him, hand turning to clasp the underside of his upper arm. It was a delicate, intimate kind of touch. Just the other day, after dinner, she’d fallen asleep heavy against his side while he and Ron played video games.
“Harry.” He guffawed, leaning over Harry’s shoulder. “D’you wanna tell me why you’re trying
and vice versa. And plant names have changed so much, there’s no telling dogwood from peonies.”
Hermione stopped in front of a large fireplace. The flames inside were very low, not producing any smoke. He guessed a huge bonfire would be unwise in a place like this. She took a pinch of green powder from a sconce on the wall, and looked over.

to the oak side-table, picking the other one up. “With this.”
“Later.” He fell back with a grimace, pulling the duvet up around his neck and shuddering. “Girding Potion. Quite foul.”
“It – it’s quite all right.” Harry peered into the bag, eyes wide. Galleons.
“I will,” he said, remembering the chicken.
“I can’t turn it off,” Harry blustered, humiliated. Seamus waved him out, shutting the door against the onslaught and casting a

George sighed, kicking off his shoes and shrugging out of the orange robes. He was wearing pajamas underneath. “The Wizengamot always agrees with me, in the end. They just like to kick up a fuss to make it look like they don’t need me.”

“I ordered a ton of this back in March. Thought it’d be too much, so I gave some to you. The
“Yeah,” Ron murmured. “Yeah, it seems that way. What...what is it you’re doing throughout the day?”
Her nod was emphatic. “I promise.”
“I really, really wish I could answer that," she whispered, at length. No threat of tears, but a very tired softness. “I’m sorry.”
idea, you know.”
“No. I – I can’t. You wouldn’t want me to – “
Her brown eyes glowed in the faint light. No visible source for it, he noticed. No torches or lamps. “I ask your advice on things, now and then. You helped us with…research. Regarding Parseltongue.”
Teddy laughed, wiping his eyes. His nose was nearly the same shade as his hair after being in the cold for so long. Then he was serious again. “You have to tell me if something happens.”
The front legs of his chair hit the kitchen floor. “Sorry. I’m talking a lot.”
“Wouldn’t’ve put you for a cheater,” Harry sniped, they fell into an almost familiar step, circling each other. Harry’s feet moved on their own.
“This is
“Where are we?” He looked into the fenced garden as they passed. Something scurried under a bush. An owl hooted softly.
“I asked the Ministry for a copy of that four days ago.”
And fathoms above yard rules at the Burrow. He and Ginny could have a real competition without George slowing them down.
with us.”
“Makes sense.” Her eyes focused on things Harry couldn’t see. “Wards are Ministry erected. Last updated in ’99. Standard Triple-I – Invulnerability stratus was temporally dismantled. This room only.”
“A hippogriff?” Ron guessed. Harry hoped he was being facetious.
Draco tensed, meeting his eyes for the first time. They seemed, in flickering torchlight, paler than usual. The irises nearly white, rimmed in red from the strange weeping that was going on.
“Ottery St. Catchpole. Devon.”
She made a frustrated sound. “It’s hard to explain.”
Ron raised his wand up, holding it like a microphone. “Code Demiguise at Euro-Glyphs. Respond immediately.” A silvery shape shot out the window. “Doctor, would you tell the front desk? You’ll have more Ministry on the way.”
Harry didn’t expect it to be flipped like that, but Hermione only rolled her eyes. “We’re not here to argue, Malfoy. Have you everything you need?”
“Someone who can turn into an animal at will.”
“No, he doesn’t. What are you doing here?”
, Harry,” she said tersely, whirling on him. “I have to double check – “
Ron darted ahead to pull open a gateway door for them. It led to a not-quite-warm enough stone hall, open on the sides to an empty courtyard. McGonagall stopped just inside, her hands folded somewhere inside her cloak. “I do not believe you need an escort to find the library.”
“Your mum?”
“It’s very old stuff,” Draco said, staring down at the table. “High Magic. Arthurian.”
He un-relaxed. Suddenly crowds of fans didn’t seem half as bad as causing an international incident because he’d forgotten the name of the Irish President’s wife or something.
, Hagrid – “
. How had he not thought to look for it where he’d woken up? His wand was…important. Or something. “Don’t…remember…”
It broke him down in the best way. He was a good parent. He
He shook his head. She didn’t supply an answer this time, writing for a few moments.
The boy was white. Thin and knobby in his youth, with the appearance of someone growing fast. Like his body was perpetually trying to catch up to too-long arms and legs. Hazel eyes were crinkled in laughter, lips pulled wide to show a gap-tooth set of teeth. Deep blue hair stuck up around his ears. His eyebrows matched.
It didn’t look like he’d been sleeping. “I don’t know what happened. I said my address, and then…” he cleared his throat, feeling suddenly very awkward. “Hermione must have messed up the Floo.”
“You knew me.” Harry thought of Hogwarts. Draco was always there, in Ron’s stories. “Enough to recognize me with
“I wonder how good their Chaser is,” Ron wondered about the team as they walked. Hermione had nestled under his arm, arms crossed and her scarf over her nose. “What did Ted call her? Pinciotti? But it’s also on the Keeper, you know? And the Beaters…”
“Why? And why don’t you start a fire?” Harry pointed his wand at the grate. “You’re pureblood. You should be warm in this house.”
Harry went to look. The rain had started up, driving everyone off the streets – not that this one had many crowds – save one dark figure standing at the grassy patch where Harry and Hermione had Apparated.
“Great.” Harry stood. “In here?”
“You’re not coming?” A stupid question. Harry should be seizing the chance to be in the library alone. He just doubted his ability to actually find his way up there.
It was so obvious, now that he had read that journal.
him? Isn’t he cursebreaking in the Alps or something?”
“It’s an idea for a line of Tassology Tea – y’know, reading your leaves? – that is taking ridiculously long to perfect.” His smile turned crooked as Victoire babbled something that sounded distressed. “Are you going to feed her?”
Ron closed his mouth. “I didn’t say a word.”

He grabbed as much produce as he could carry, hoping to ease off the takeout. Five minutes into a search for owl treats, he remembered where he was and simply picked up an extra apple.
Ron guffawed. “What makes you think – ?“
Ron nodded slowly, sniffing hard. They kept playing. Ron didn’t talk again, and Harry knew he wouldn’t. Not tonight. Not about the war and what had happened. Harry wouldn’t make him.
“So? What have you found that needs so much thinking over?”
caught the snitch, a Cockney penalty resets position. Broft should’ve gone for it instead of hedging on a tackle.”
Ron shook his head. “You had that idea before, but we decided against working with him. He already told everything he’s willing to tell. Just after the trial.”
“Shh!” Teddy batted his arm as Minerva’s voice drifted down the hall. “You’ll lose Gryffindor ten points with talk like that!”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “I don’t know who, actually.”
“So I hear.”
Harry nodded, wondering how
“You’re certain he was looking at this house?”
“Fuck.” Harry panted into his water tin, starting to sincerely regret his lack of exercise in the past weeks. His body right after the attack was hard to remember. He should have appreciated it more at the time.
She frowned at him while he recounted the misadventure the night before, prodding a finger against the bruise on his ankle when he showed her.
She scooped something up and leaned over her desk to hand them each a printed sticker of a stylized eye – the Eye of Horus. He followed Ron’s suit and peeled it from the flypaper, pressing it to his chest. The white outlines faded, the eye soaking up the color to sit embroidered on his dress shirt like it had always been there.
Hermione didn’t say anything. He moved closer to the table, curious and repulsed. A picture frame was turned face-down. When he picked it up, he saw a large crack across the glass. Like someone had slammed it down in a drunken rage.
“Hated Fleur.” Harry looked up (and
“Thanks,” he said, unsurprised but touched all the same. Warmth couldn’t fly straight through the top of his head anymore. “Better.”
Harry replaced Castor in the sitting room, instructed him to stay put, and sat across from Draco with his food. He was watched with dark, confused eyes as he took his first bite. Too late to wish he’d cooked something less pungent.
you.”
George flicked a light switch in the kitchen, casting the gloom away. A muggle coffee-maker sat near the sink, two orange mugs next to it.
“Sure we do!” The door shut behind George with an echoing bang. “All our jokes are practical.”
It wasn’t Minerva waiting at the gate. This time it was a squat, round old woman and a tall man. Neville.
“You fancy him,” George accused, switching tact. Probably because he knew Harry had a point. “You fancy Malfoy.”
alright?”
“I’m really sorry,” Harry apologized. “I’ll leave through the front, I think.”
“Hogwarts?”

“Twenty,” he mused. “I’ll get there eventually.”
Harry had expected to draw Draco’s ire by showing up like this. Being
Ron sobered immediately, and Harry feared he’d touched upon another sore spot.
“You look very nice today,” she said, apropos of nothing. He instinctively looked down at his plain black robes and dress shoes.
“That’s Sir Nicholas,” he whispered. Harry looked around.
He scrubbed the kiss away with a gagging sound. “C’mon, Haz. Round of Ogden’s?”
The ice cream shop was shut for the day, it seemed. One of the biggest shops, though. Only ‘one of’, because the one directly across from it was
Harry stared at him, a bit impressed. Veritaserum was supposed to be really uncomfortable. He spoke without thinking. “Did you have
The brusqueness wasn’t entirely unexpected, after their last encounter, but Harry thought question fairly innocent. “I just asked if you – “
“Let me guess,” he said, pushing the door shut with more force than necessary. “It’s been longer than a half hour for you.”
“Harry doesn’t drink,” someone called. It sounded like Percy. Harry was grateful – he hadn’t made any kind of announcement about it, but alcohol had been gradually removed as a Sunday staple.
“You said all that before.”
This apparently was the excuse many nearby students needed to stop and stare at Harry. “Hullo, Sir Nicholas. Who says I’m not on Ministry business?”
All he needed was a sign-off. He flattened the parchment down on the kitchen table, dipping the quill in ink and thinking. Everything looked fine. Ron had proofread – for personality mistakes, not grammatical – and given the thumbs-up. He still wanted part of this to be just from him.

It felt frail and ancient in his hands, the cover a thin cardboard and the pages like onionskin. He very gingerly flipped it to the other side, opening the back and looking at the page numbers. Five hundred and two pages. All this work, for two pages.
“Why – “
The Gryffindor Keeper was unstoppable, only allowing the Quaffle past once after ducking a Bludger. Harry, Ron and Teddy groaned in unison. Behind them, Luna and Hermione were talking about Astronomy. At least, that’s what he assumed from the snatches of conversation he heard.
“Why are you taking my tea?”
Ron stood at the white board and swiped his wand to the left. “
A rickety set of steps went up and around through the inside of the structure. Just between the wooden slats he got a glimpse of brown grass and three high gold hoops. Then they were climbing.
“Hey, Harry. I thought you deserved a bit of a lie-in this morning. Since you can’t produce a Patronus; I’m speed dial two on your cell phone – I’ve no idea where you put it, but it should be in your house somewhere. Call me if you need anything.”

Draco looked like he was going to say something, then stepped to the side. Harry took that as a cue and tried to walk out with as much dignity as he could. At the door, a hand closed around his arm. Only enough force to slow him, but he stopped cold.

some things.”
, and tried to wonder what it would be like to watch one of his own memories from the outside. From her expression, he didn’t guess they would be good ones. “Well, I can see what Ron’s been going on about. He’s…abrasive.”
Their goodbyes were bare bones. Draco just waved them off, opening his briefcase and leaning in up to the shoulder to dig for something. Harry held the umbrella as they strolled down the street instead of Apparating, headed for the nearest decent-looking restaurant.
“Hey, Ted.” He patted him on the shoulder, eyes falling on Harry in question. “Blimey, you get shorter?”
The almost-smile disappeared. “So many questions. I miss when we were

“I have an owl,” Harry admitted, pulling the heating rock out from the Menagerie bag. “It’s not here, now, though. It can’t hurt you.”
“No, I’m – I wasn’t – “
Harry felt very out of his league. “What – haven’t you asked him about it?”
_______________
Biting back the urge to return pleasantries, Harry just nodded and pushed inside, striding through an entrance chamber and through a second set of doors. Past that, he had to stop and look, re-orienting himself in time and space.
Draco didn’t move, and Harry suddenly felt the need to put it to words. “I was so worried about you – “ he winced. Not
“Shacklebolt. The Minister.”
Harry felt his eyes go wide.
He didn’t comment on the fact that they stepped out onto the fourth floor. Honestly, the way this day was going he could have been wrong about entering from the first. They were above the turning staircases now. A few students here and there saw them and skittered away.
to work
“As much as possible.”
Hermione looked at him, lips parting around nothing. “The point?”
“’Ello,” he said faintly. Ron groaned.
“What?”
The other two felt much more concrete as people. Ron seemed very opinionated. Harry liked him just fine, though, he decided. Hermione was harder to read. He’d seen glimpses of someone clinical, calculating. Not at all like a person who broke down crying all the time. It must just be the situation at hand.
…And then it was shut. Hermione lowered her wand, looking troubled.
“George!” She yelled down, cupping her hands over her mouth. “Come be a Beater!”
There was some puttering around before George hobbled in, balancing two potted plants and a big leather-bound notebook in his hands. Harry pulled the stack of cardboard out of his way. Lee helped him put the plants down without breaking anything.

– walking from the fireplaces in the atrium. It had been taken from the side at a surreptitious angle. His undone robes billowed open, showing his collared shirt and trousers.
Draco leaned forward, eyes wide. “Need I remind you that
“You know what I mean.” Harry looked down at him. “I’m going to hold your, erm, neck. Just to make her feel better.”
“You are. You’re the problem.” With that, she strode to the door and opened it. Harry bit back a scream of rage. “I know you don’t realize it now, Harry, but this is the cruelest thing you have ever done to me.”
It wasn’t a nice photo. Why would he display it?
“Ha,” Harry said drily, watching a scoop of carrot ooze out of Victoire’s mouth. “How’d you know I’d be here?” It was only just lunchtime – he’d normally be hanging around the Ministry. This was one of the few days where Hermione didn’t need him. “Or did you expect I wouldn’t be?”
The wind was the only sound for a few moments. Teddy stared at him, mouth set like maybe Harry was making an elaborate joke. When it was clear he wasn’t, the look faded into confusion, and then shock.
“That’s primogeniture for you,” Draco sighed.
“I think I’ll take that sleep now,” he said quietly. Harry stood.
“I know. I know you would.”

Her hair was down today, tight curls bouncing as she shook her head. “We recovered a…memory.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “Keep an eye out – Slytherin only wins by cheating.”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek. Shit.
The Fidelus charm was less than secure, but the list of people who knew the address was relatively low. “Did you recognize him?”
Harry set the heavy tote on the table, ears ringing. “I didn’t think. I was just knocking to be polite.”
It was a strange feeling, turning his head to the side and seeing empty air. He reached a hand out, feeling rough stone. All that was visible was the little ledge he leaned on. Maybe it technically counted as inside? He didn’t know enough about the wards in place to be certain.
“More like…war hero,” Ron corrected.

“Five. Yes, don’t hurt yourself, Weasley.”
"Mention what?"
Ron cried, matching his volume. Debra put a hand on his shoulder, forcing him back into his seat.
Any strength the possibility of help had given him seeped away. Walking this far had taken all he had. He wasn’t going to make it. He was going to die alone and injured, with no idea of how he’d come to be here, or who he even was.
Harry moved to help, ignoring the protests. He took Draco’s arm and draped it over his shoulder, drawing them both to their feet with a hand on Draco’s waist. He couldn’t even tell if Draco was trying to pull away from him or not, he was so weak.
Draco leaned over the banister, looking down the hall where the heavy black curtains were billowing to either side of a truly horrendous portrait. He pointed his wand.
It wasn’t a total standstill, everyone stopping to stare sort of thing. It was more subtle than that. There was Hannah, who smiled and waved a goodbye to him. But everyone else, as he and Hermione passed, looked up.
If Harry Potter was a politician, Hermione Granger was all of Parliament. And he was more useful to her as the Head Auror, someone to put her head together with. Though he couldn’t imagine he was ever as brilliant as her, it was undeniable his reach. His influence.
“Food.” Harry nodded to the bag. “Leftovers. I didn’t want them.”
“You said he took it well,” she pointed out, turning a page.
“That won’t work,” Draco said, eyelids dropping shut.
They went back and forth with their arguments, Draco continuously alluding to plays and history and Harry relying only on his gut and limited experience. It was engaging, like talking about Quidditch always was, but Harry couldn’t believe how easy it was to talk to Draco about it. And how clearly Draco
you would say that. But you’ve forgotten about the entire point of the Greenfield recovery maneuver – “
Draco looked at them, turned on his heel and stalked off.
“Merlin,” the kid breathed, scrambling over the back of a chair to run up a staircase. “I’ll get my broom!”
After a tense moment, the noise ratcheted back up. Confused, this time.
“I wouldn’t dream of arguing with you.”
It started out soft and gentle, a ripple over still waters. A gasp of pleasure turned pain; perfect and sour. A hand, a flame, and someone weeping from the bottom of their stomach. Confrontation that ends in blood and a misplaced spell.

hadn’t been alone, either. “And maybe I’ve been ghosting someone who thought things were going well.”
He had changed clothes. The plain black shirt had been swapped for an identical one in deep olive, tucked into trousers that tapered at the ankles. Checkered socks and strange, flat shoes with dull finish. The grandeur of it made his face appear all the more ghostly, and the snug fabrics drew out his thinness.
“In the meantime…” She patted Teddy’s hand and looked between Harry and Ron. “Draco Malfoy is no fool. Treating him as such would be unwise.”

“Oh, close your mouth,” Ginny smirked, sipping water. “She’s part Veela.”

He gripped the bottle like he knew what Harry was thinking. “Five hundred? That’s well out of bounds for a Beater.”

Harry didn’t dignify that with a response. “If you really need the money, I’ll go to Gringotts while I’m here. So long as it’s
“Every Sunday,” Arthur said. His husky tone tipped Harry off.
“That’s it, there,” he shook a banker’s box on the table. “Coffee? Tea?”
Draco was slurring his words a little. Harry ignored that. “I listened to it on the radio. Conner Broft nearly lost the game tackling one of Bachory’s Beaters five hundred yards up.”
Except one. Harry stepped up to Number Twelve and knocked heavily.
at the thought.”
One phrase got thrown around more often than ever before. “The twins”. They were at the center of every story, in one way or another. Always together, always in matching clothes and equally shaggy hairstyles. Always together, so there was nearly no need to utter Fred’s name at all. Just ‘the twins’.
“No. It’s
It was nearing nine o’clock, and pouring rain, and Harry would much rather have been in bed. “What did you mean, earlier? About me egging her on?”
Ron swiveled to face him. His cubicle was filled with trinkets, and smiling photographs. There was a smaller version of the poster from Teddy’s room. Ginny yawned, gesturing vaguely to Ron in a
But he had been hit. There was blood.
“It's Monday. He’s supposed to be.” Harry tried to sound nonchalant. Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Granger mentioned…” Harry looked up. Draco willingly speaking to him was new, and welcome. Even if he seemed unable to look Harry in the eye. “You attended the Hogwarts game this weekend.”
George straightened, taking two steps back. “
The cat’s footsteps pelted across the carpet in a burst of feline energy, but it didn’t come into the kitchen. A little radio by the sink played muggle jazz. He didn’t think he was scaring her, exactly, but there was a starkness in her eyes he hadn’t seen before. The clear lack of a response cemented it for him.
“He’s not a werewolf.”
“George snuck that wand in my robes,” Ron roared. “I’ll kill him!”
He chewed his tongue for a second, then raised the wand. “
“Yes, but you’re suffering. It’s hard to watch.”
” The stranger growled. The wand was pulled back a few inches, pointing at his face. The stranger seemed to think hard about something, eyes wide and staring. Then, “
“Damn. You should go,” he said, slowly pushing back up. “It’s not good for us to sleep in here.”
“Ow.”
“And what do you suppose they were after?” Ron asked, his tone deceptively polite.
“No.”
Ron kept up a dubious frown, but Harry knew he was for it.
“I think so,” Ron hedged, scratching his jaw. She glanced over to him with a raised eyebrow. “We’ll know more after Monday. I’ll owl.”
“This is the guest room, but it’s really just yours,” he said anxiously. “I mean, you stay here a lot. So does Teddy.”
“Not for years. Not since you killed him.”
Harry felt in his pockets. “I think I need to get some money out. Where exactly is Diagon Alley?”
Hermione pressed her hand to her forehead. “You can’t have a
“Yeah. I think we were all a bit…surprised. Anyway, he went off the grid for a while. The next time anyone saw him, he was cursebreaking the old Death Eater safehouses. Shacklebolt’s idea.”
“No,” Fleur giggled. “It iz yours. ‘Ow much do you want to withdraw?”
“We just did. Or what do you call yelling at me back there?”
“Marcomannic,” she stated. “A rune alphabet. Most Pensieves use Saxon…standard use, storing and viewing. Futhark for things like prophesies…but Marcomannic is…”
“No.” She looked over at Ron, his head bent almost ninety degrees to the back of the sofa. “We haven’t said more than a passing word to each other since school. But…I think he meant it. I don’t know if it was only the Mourning Moon talking. I’d like to think it wasn’t.”
“Yes.” Draco looked up, his face hard. “I’ll share it.”
At eight o’clock, the fireplace
She still looked guilty. “I’m not asking you to betray his trust.”
her singing voice. It’s not as though I’m using her image. Fuck’s sake.”
He blinked, having to think about that one. Didn’t seem exactly relevant. “…Prong the Pugnacious?”
“You cannot feed her so much so quickly! She is only
She waved off his first argument, which was for the best because he wasn’t sure what he would have said. “I’m sorry, Harry, but you’re the only one who has a shot at this. Ron won’t be able to get a warrant, and Draco wouldn’t invite him in. I…I just don’t think I can do it.”
The snake never really spoke unless Harry asked him a direct question, happy enough to sit on his rock or near the fire. It wasn’t the most stimulating of conversation, but he figured it went above and beyond expectations as far as any animal was concerned.
was the final incantation, followed by Draco’s name. The colors in the room intensified, a very thin shudder went through what felt like the entire house, and then it all faded from view. The parlor was just a parlor again.
“Whatever that means,” Harry said as it dissipated. Ginny rolled her eyes.
“We’re not…
Every bit the words of an Unspeakable, but he thought he could derive some meaning from it - she was agreeing with him. And that was miraculous. It said a lot about who he'd been. Before. If it wasn't important to the investigation...
Looking at his nude body was strange. He must work out quite a lot to be so lean. The suggestion of abdominals lined his stomach. As did the suggestion of a lot of violence. He had scars all over, including the newest one. Some were so small they had to have been acquired without magic. And he hadn’t had them magically healed, either. It was the one on his forehead that puzzled him. The scar tissue was too bright, the lines too jagged. Was it a curse?
“Harry! Ah, if it ain’t good to see you!”
“Not just yet,” Harry grunted, hefting a twenty pounder.

you walk?” He asked as an afterthought. Draco made a disparaging sound and threw the covers aside.
“A very brief summary of a decade’s research.” Draco put his back – again – to Harry as he sat, like nothing had happened. Harry stepped around to an empty chair, opening the sheaf nearest to him.
“Thanks,” he said drily, setting it back down. Hermione set the pen between her teeth and straightened up, thinking.
“Hm…” He may as well have spoken to the sofa. “Not the Network. Fidelus gets in the way of that.” She tapped her wand thoughtfully to her chin. “This might take a minute.”
Harry leaned away as Victoire grabbed for his glasses – her favorite game, it seemed. George rifled through his cabinets without preamble, making a happy noise when he found the loose-leaf containers Harry had pushed to the back.
Hermione stilled. “What?”
His hands were still shaking. Harry came to an abrupt, reckless decision. “Then I’ll stay there.”
“No, we had a night in. I…” She trailed off, looking very tired. “Just a long week, I think.”
“This it?” Ron tilted his head at the figure of Confucius carved in deep gray metal.
Draco picked up the bottle and drank from it. Gulped. A rivulet of red ran down his chin before he brusquely wiped it away, leaving the kitchen without a word.
When did you even
Seamus took a sugar quill from his mouth, Vanishing it and giving Harry a reassuring smile. Everyone filed into a seat, leaving the end empty.
“No,” Hermione said. Ron was half in front of her, valiantly trying to not look scared now that he had his wand at the ready. “No, I’m sure Harry was just surprised, is all.”
He heard his wandless Stinging Hex hit its target as he tossed soiled fabric into the bin. Getting the fluffy green dress back on would take forever, and he would only have to take it back off later, so he just picked Victoire up and left it on the counter.
Harry stopped at the far wall, turning toward the opening and whistling. “Posher than posh.”
Which seemed to imply Castor knew where he had been, and with whom. Who knew snakes could be so catty?
The delivery had been made. Harry could go if he wanted, and let Draco get on with it. But the embossed cover of the book seemed to mock him. What was an Elusinian Mystery? Maybe Draco knew more about it. Harry decided to wait and ask when Draco wasn't so preoccupied.
began, symbols were found by an exchange student in a Swedish cathedral. Their placement and symmetry was similar, but the glyphs were Masonic in origin.”
“Is that German?” Harry peered close at another cloud of dark fog.
“Wait…” Harry tried, reaching. The last thing he heard were the sounds of a scuffle. Someone was hit.
Floo,” Harry said, and a small container floated out from behind a photograph. Ron snatched it out of the air and lit a fire, his nervous energy infectious.
“I didn’t say anything about dating.”
Nothing on Draco’s face moved, save for his eyes. They widened the slightest amount as he looked to Ron. “He doesn’t remember.”
“Well, erm.” That was sad. At least George wasn’t entirely alone. “I’m sorry it has to be that way. How long have you been together?”
“I can’t tell you. Not yet.”
She cast him a teary-eyed, but still very furious look. The door slammed shut. Harry nearly drove his fist into the blank wood. Repressing the urge made the entryway lightbulb shatter.
“Aye,” Hagrid said. Harry swallowed. “Mayhaps you oughta try talkin’ to it. I think he’s used to me, but since yer new and all…”
Teddy met him halfway down the steep steps in a much less painful hug. “You just made it,” he said urgently, tugging him down the row toward Minerva. Harry waved her way, getting a tight smile in return. “It’s about to start.”
Harry turned around, escape thwarted. At least Teddy had noticed him. “Yeah?”
“Ah,” Harry had said. “Glorious.”
He blinked, then shook his head. She hoisted herself onto a countertop, crossing her ankles and watching him over the top of a bottle of muggle iced tea. Silence was a new addition to their dynamic - they usually had more to talk about. There was never silence at the Burrow.
“Fine, fine,” Lee said lightly, waving a hand. “Come sit. I can’t fold all this by myself.”
“Why did you hate me? Did I do something to you?”
The third was a couple. He didn’t recognize them, but he knew exactly who they were. The man looked like him, and the woman had bright green eyes.
“Erm, I’d say it’s a
“Come on.” She finished off the tea and Vanished the bottle. “Mum’ll have kittens when we show up together.”
Castor made a haughty noise, his nose stuck into Harry’s mug.
Harry folded a lid closed. Lee made it sound so tempting… It would be a lot more people than pub night. But they’d have to watch the game instead of stare at Harry. And real Quidditch promised to be a lot more intense than yard rules at the Weasley’s. Then again, the first Gryffindor game was be the next morning. Maybe if he knew what he was talking about he and Teddy could discuss the game while they watched. Or something.
“Why?”
Ginny put a hand on his arm, looking beseechingly at Ron.
Ron’s face was turning red. The woman patted his arm consolingly. “He’s here. They’re holding him for questioning, but he’s…fine.”
The place had cleared out, so no one was there to help. Harry couldn’t hear the yelling until he was standing on the other side of his office door. Ron’s voice cut through what sounded like at least one
“Is it true you killed the Dark Lord with the Jelly Legs jinx?”
“Yeah, thanked me for some things I sent up – “
Harry shook his head, taking in the subtle hardening to Teddy’s expression. His hair might've gone a shade darker, edging toward black.
“ – and we’ve never been closer than we are now. But I’ve seen your memories, now. I know that – that I didn’t have the entire picture before, and now I can’t tell which path you would rather take. I just know that I – like
“Is there food in the kitchen?”
Another Floo trip, and he was standing in a much more welcoming space. Fat brown chairs, a long sofa. A furry gray cat that looked balefully up from its spot on a chess board.
How quickly he’d accepted the staring and paranoia, let it settle in the back of his head to the point where anything else was out of the norm. The concept of truly blending in was surreal. Not that he was too relaxed – his wand was always just a second away, stuck in his inner jacket pocket where he could grab it in a second if anything happened. Thankfully, it wasn’t necessary.
“Yet you keep coming back.”
“Shut the door,” he said. There was some shuffling, then it slammed closed.
was superfluous. “Then he lied first.”
“Gallahey,” Ron said, looking at the vial. Debra nodded and took it, exiting the room. He looked at Draco, considering. “Do you know where Dolohov is?”
And it wasn’t solid. A spindly sort of cage wrapped around a small, hourglass shaped bauble. If he squinted, he could see a shifting substance inside the gold, like it was hollow. Hermione pulled it away when he tried to get a closer look.
“What’d you think about McGonagall?”
The torches on the top floor burned brighter than before, but it was still silent as the grave. He undid the locking charms on Sirius’ door and went to the bookshelf, pulling one of the Transfiguration texts free.
what he’s planning. What Draco was hiding from me – I’ve figured it out.”
“Safe journeys.”
“I don’t think so. I’d rather live in the moment.”
“Hey-O!” An older man stepped through the garden door and peeled off thick leather gloves. His lined face was smudged with dirt. “My boys!”
“He doesn’t know,” she went on. “We were waiting for you to wake up. I thought it wouldn’t be necessary to worry him.”
Sirius was in a few of the Grimmauld Place album photos. Usually reluctant, unsmiling…and, now that he thought about it, exactly like Harry usually appeared. Except Sirius had the decency to smile at his friends’ wedding.
“She’s famous, too,” he guessed, looking at her in a new light. She was very beautiful. Eye catching in the same ways Ron was. Bright orange hair, a wide, easy smile. But Harry wasn’t particularly attracted to her. He didn’t let on his confusion about his sexuality, keeping that deep inside. It didn’t really matter, anyway.
Ron squinted at him.
Harry looked up, the shock of Draco glaring at him nearly stronger than his shock at being addressed. Usually he tried to stay out of everyone’s way. “Pardon?”
Two more turns, past one classroom in session – the professor faltered as they walked past, meeting Harry’s eyes in an awkward pass – and they were at a small set of doors, guarded on either side by two men in sunflower-yellow robes. They took one look at Harry and stepped aside.
She picked up the pen and started scribbling on the paper. He peered down, but the words slipped away as soon as she wrote them. Concealed.
“Dr. Mahmoud is the Director of Euro-Glyphs, London. You can find him on the third floor. Office number thirty-one.”
Harry relaxed. “Great.”
Like jumping, or being pushed. Whether it was a choice or not, gravity took what it was owed. Yes, falling. Something was falling from such a great height. It would never come back as a whole. Only as a piece. A fracture. A stunning explosion. Ice-blue eyes that lied. Always lying.
“At what?”
“I don’t really think poisoning is her style,” Harry said. “Anyone who wanted to do you in would just leave you alone here. Let you starve yourself to death.”
“Maybe you’ve got a point,” he said in a new tone of voice, frowning at the table. “Your perspective
“Come off it,” he whispered.
The touch was gone before Harry could even be shocked by it, and by the time he could he was too distracted by the
want to know.”
“What, dear? He’s all right, now – “
“That’s optimistic,” he muttered. Ron elbowed him, but Greenbaum only laughed.
Harry told Ron and Hermione about the letter as they went back toward the pitch. “I mean, what sort of thing would I have asked him for?”
“And you think he’s going to…invite me?”
He wondered if he found it funny, before.
The bed was unmade, sheets twisted like he’d just climbed out and left after a night of tossing and turning. Forgotten, the duvet sagged to the floor. Its deep red matched the scarf thrown over the bed post. The closet door hung open, half-covering the window.
Ron digested that, tapping his fork against his plate.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Of
He Levitated a china plate down, uncaring of its age or fragility. A Scalding Hex overdid the toast by just a hair, but the jam covered the worst of the burned spots. The smell was sweet and sugary, promising to sit heavy on the back of his tongue after eating. The next drawer he tried had one of each utensil (three spoons, technically, but all different sizes and therefore brushed off as rich persons nonsense). He steeped the tea in two silver mugs, glancing nosily through the rest of the pantry. Empty. All of it.
Rooftops, empty. Harry waited for a shot, a curse to streak past him or into him. Anything at all to give him a hint of where to aim.
George wrote down. “Ta, Har.”
“I think you’re right,” Ron said, pulling back in and looking at Greenbaum. “Looks like someone flew a broomstick right up to the window. Wind’s coming in, as well."
“’Bout time,” he grumbled, sitting at the center table gracelessly and dragging a folder his way. “What’s this?”
“What was I supposed to do, Harry? Do you think I
“I can imagine. Mr. Weasley has always made your well-being a priority.”
“Exactly. How did he get ingredients for Polyjuice? It’s not a simple potion.”
“Not at all,” Debra said quickly, nodding. Dean and Seamus followed, casting curious looks over their shoulders as they rounded a corner.
“Right.” Harry felt stupid. “That’s why you didn’t take me into that house, the night I lost my memory. Because I don’t have the Mark?”
, I supposed I am involved.”
Would she continue to pressure him? How clearly would he have to put it before she understood? Or…was she counting on
“I wasn’t sure if you’d make it.” Ron looked very ill at ease. “That first week, when he was gone, you - “ He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth, leaning back. “You were a nightmare. Being in the office was like sitting on a landmine.”
He hesitated at the door, awkwardly. It was a bit juvenile. “Sleep well.”
“Work to do," Draco intoned. He had the stopwatch in his hand, clutched next to his wand. There were tiny, empty vials on the cushion next to him, rolled toward the dip of his weight. Probably a keep awake potion, but far too many to be good. And it clearly didn’t contain Rejuvenating properties because Draco looked utterly exhausted.
Teddy nodded. His freckles were sharp against his pale skin. “It’s okay. You…you don’t seem all that different.”
Ron pointed to a low, brick-front building with a glass roof, half behind a shop called
Debra’s ‘ways’, whatever Dark magic they must have been, had Draco moving in the next afternoon. The message of affirmation came addressed to the entire department.
The prophecy, the murder of his parents, growing up with his extended – apparently horrible – muggle family. Being terrorized every year by Dark Wizards and somehow escaping. It seemed really unlikely that it was a lie, but he found it all a bit too fantastical to believe.
Draco was the first to lower his wand. Harry quickly did the same. “What do you call this? Come to kill me in my sleep?”
He shuffled them off into a side corridor, away from curious stares.
Finally, Ron crumpled his wrapper up into a ball, wiping a spare bit of crumb from his mouth. “Alright, I suppose I’ll start us off.”
McGonagall. No one had anything bad to say about her, but even the good things were tinged with respectful terror.

artwork of a cartoon man looking down at his crotch in surprise. Harry reached up to look at what it said. As his hand entered the line of sight of a rubber chicken, though, it sprang to life, dancing across the shelf and squawking what sounded like the Irish national anthem.
“If you don’t…erm, you know, then you’ll get to see Hogwarts for the first time, yeah? It’ll be great.”
“The hallway,” he realized. All those people had seen the two of them arguing. Well, they had seen Harry being argued at.
“Yeah,” he said, bumping his shoulder on the windowpane. “Yeah, it looks like…”
Ron. He’d heard that name. Just before he’d passed out. Back at that abandoned house, Ron had been one of the people Harry was afraid of. That seemed almost silly, now, because clearly he wasn’t in danger.
“Yes. For the dolt who doesn’t know babies can’t drink tea.”
But Draco reached forward, his hand reaching out and sliding up Harry’s arm to grip his shoulder. Harry couldn’t move, his instinct to retreat turning into something else, watching in wild anticipation as Draco’s other hand came up toward his head to pull the hood down. It was suddenly very hot under the Cloak, and he was eager to get it off, to breathe in Draco’s wonderful scent and –
“Right.” He found he had no idea what that meant.
She looked at Ron meaningfully. “
“The – the snake. It can
“A blonde?”
Ron was in his cubicle, scratching away at some important-looking document. He sat up and smiled when Harry handed him the stack.
Eventually, the broomsticks returned to the shed. Ron took a chair near Hermione, and Bill sat on the blanket, drawing the baby into his lap. The conversation turned reminiscing, for Harry’s benefit but not obviously so. They talked about the past ten years, about weddings and small fights and Teddy breaking an heirloom clock trying to climb the picture-wall.
“You think they’d be…harboring him?” Harry asked.
“Harry?”
Ron rubbed his face again, thinking in that scrambled, mostly efficient way he had. “It doesn’t explain how - “
At Harry’s blank look, he sighed and stopped his whirling about long enough to scoop Victoire away.
“And keeps them on the Malfoy estate,” Hermione finished, realizing something with a frown. “Like Hogwarts. They’d be destroyed if they were removed.” Draco nodded, and she teetered forward on her toes, visibly drawn to the new well of information. “Why keep it off the registry?”
The woman stepped forward anxiously. “Who, Harry?”
“I – I was sitting in the parlor,” he said, too fast. “The curtains opened themselves and I…I saw…
, even if he didn’t remember when he’d learned it.
at what’s happened?”
None of the actual photos seemed to be taken
“Has Draco been here, you think? To look at the same books?”
“Fuck. I thought you were just being pessimistic.”
“Moonsickness,” she said, recovering and settling the bag down. The mattress groaned like it was much heavier than its size would indicate. Draco didn’t stir. “Like we talked about last night. It’s common with werewolves suppressing their change with potions. Even Bill…” she sighed and set out three large flasks of differing color and consistency.
“And since I was attacked?” He recalled the conversation he’d walked in on. “You think he was involved, don’t you?”
“Stop what?”
“ – and all the goblins were side-eyeing me, a bit – “
“Get down,” Harry said. Draco’s eyes flicked to him for less than a second before carefully tracking the snake’s movements as it wound around Harry’s bare feet. Harry wasn’t wearing a shirt. Not that it mattered. Not that it
Ron’s mouth fell open. “
Teddy paused, and then crossed his arms and ankles. Mirroring Harry exactly. “What d’you mean?”
Lee shrugged, still hopeful. “It’ll be the first game of the season. Always a madhouse – even you won’t be the center of attention. George doesn’t like crowds, either, but maybe he’d do it for a
“She always thought you hated her,” Bill remarked, sidling up next to Harry in the garden. Harry had just spent an hour Transfiguring rocks for Victoire’s amusement. Now George had her, and was dancing to the Celestina Warbeck that drifted through the open window. Fleur and Charlie hovered nearby.
It came to Harry a second later, quite embarrassingly late. Of course Draco slept in one of the bedrooms. Harry had just sort of assumed, based on the state of the sitting room…
when you laugh.”
“Neither.” Harry sat and pulled the box closer, alarmed at the weight of the contents. It was quite a lot to send all at once. Looking at the labels, it was quite a
“Ron’s gone already. We’ll meet him after going to Mysteries. Did you sleep well?”
Harry sat back, his chest tight. Every scribbled out mistake – every violently underlined word. The small, bashful
Not students, but portraits. The larger hall they turned into was warmer, lit by torches that threw relief to the many framed works of art. They moved like photographs, which was less alarming than the fact that he was clearly being whispered about. Even the canvas-and-oil scribbles knew more about him than he did. Fantastic.
Harry cajoled Ron into a restaurant instead of a pub. A small, out of the way sort of place. There was
“It must work for him, still,” she said slowly, “for his potion work to be as good as it is.”
Without another word, she walked through the door. It didn’t open for her, or anything. Just…let her through. Curious, Harry stepped forward to try the same, but some quickly written words stopped him.

“You stopped looking for him. Now he’s here. It’s not a coincidence.”
“George,” Harry cut in, following back upstairs. “Don’t do that again.”

“Love you,” Teddy said against his robes.
Dean’s water cut off. Harry did the same, pulling his towel off the rack and stepping out. Seamus stood there with his hands on his hips, breathing hard. Had he
“It’s undisturbed,” Hermione announced, echoing Harry’s ward inspection from the night before. He had interrupted them getting ready for work, so she was in house shoes and a satiny headwrap. “I doubt he would be reckless enough to have tried it, anyway.”
Harry took note of that. Hermione kept her role in the Ministry very vague – Unspeakables as a rule did not communicate with other departments, but Hermione was often in the Auror office on business Harry knew nothing about. He’d even seen her walking out of the Beast Division on Level Four. About a fourth of the reports in his home office were written by her, and her name was all over the Ministry, so to speak. She had her own section in the Archives, filled with drafts and legislation concerning Magical Creatures and International Cooperation. And now, he thought, glancing at the fireplace, she evidently held some sway with the Floo Network Authority.
“He doesn’t look good, Ron. It’s making him sick or something.”
“He deserves to know,” Ron argued quietly.
He realized too late what he’d done, and the only solace in the sudden wailing from inside was that none of the Halloween crowd around him were able to hear it.
“What should I write?” Harry asked anxiously, Summoning a roll of parchment and picking up a quill. Ron folded Teddy’s letter and set it down.
“Why aren’t you saying anything?”
“I – “ He hesitated, abandoning the comment that it hadn’t felt like the first time. Instead, “I’m the master of his wand. Aren’t I?”
Instinct kicked in. He cast a
“She’s an Animagus?”
His accent was posh, aloof. Everyone sat up a little straighter at that, their faces just as blank. Except Ron, who looked distinctly miffed.
He looked down at his shirt, one he’d fished out of the very back of his closet. “Is
“Great! We’ve got Pinciotti as Chaser – she’s got us the House Cup three years running.”
“It doesn’t quite feel like that,” he continued. She picked up the
“There’s a new person at the door,” he said quietly. “You’re not to frighten her, alright?”
Draco tore the meat off a chicken bone, no visible chewing involved before he swallowed and took the next bite. Not unlike how Ron usually ate, but that was Ron. This was prim, proper Draco. A blue-blood in the most Dickensian way.
“Just me,” Ron’s voice called right after, warbled through the door and the water. Harry missed whatever else he said.
Well, that was quite soon. “Can I speak with you? In…my office?”
There was a scuffling sound as George tripped over the rug, and then he was standing in the doorway, nose wrinkled. “What the hell is this?”
Mahmoud nodded and pushed one door open, saying something rapid to one of the guards. While he did so, the three of them put their heads together.
“Okay – wait,
Weasley.” She fixed Ron with an uncompromising frown. “You will find Dolohov and put an end to this.”
Potter didn’t exactly think he’d done it to himself, but he didn’t say that. The stranger waved his wand, and in an instant the trickling rain ceased to hit them. An umbrella charm. Then a blue ball of fire burst into being over his body, giving the whole scene a sickly glow.
Harry ignored their continued startled looks. Even Élise’s eyes were wide. “But you said he was a Death Eater.”
Draco took it from him and unscrewed the top, holding it against his cheek and blinking up at the ceiling. A single, heavy teardrop snaked down the side and, to Harry’s amazement, turned bright blue.
“Smart. Though even if the Beater
Castor stayed away from him, probably sensing his mood. Harry cleaned the kitchen, dusted Teddy’s room, and showered, his head buzzing all the while.
At his nod, Harry rubbed his eyes. It made a certain amount of sense that it was such a secret. The papers would go mad for that information. But not even Ron? Hermione? “Why don’t you tell your family? You think they’d be upset?”
Her smile was wry. “I won’t give you a history lesson, Potter. Now, I believe someone is waiting for you.”
Ron was quiet for a minute. “You
“Don’t be silly. I asked you to,” she muttered, rubbing the spot. “You stung me. That was an…odd choice.”
He nodded, ignoring Hermione’s raised eyebrow. “Sure thing, Hagrid.”
She looked nonplussed. There was a short, jaunty saxophone solo from the sink, comically out of place. “Don’t do this, Harry. Don’t assume…”
Draco snorted. “Use the Floo, you say? And when I’m seen leaving
“No, don’t apologize.” She wiped quickly at her eyes, sniffing. “We weren’t certain if…if he was telling the truth. I’ll go get Ron.”
“Don’t be daft.” Ron snatched the letter away, unfolding it. “I’ve got time.”
. Debra stomped over, arms wrapped tight around her middle, a thick black scarf nearly covering her omni-present frown. “Let’s get on with it, shall we?”
The sweep of magic was nearly as strong as Hogwarts. Flames flickered to life all down the long hall, throwing weird shapes onto peeling once-blue patterned wallpaper. Ron had warned him against making loud noises in the entry.
“Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall said, so sharply that Harry jumped. Ron looked stuck in headlights, all signs of Head Aurorship blinking away under her ire. “I assure you, nothing will happen to Potter should he leave your sight.”
“I know there’s a spell for it. A painless one.”
Harry made his own tea, disgruntled at having to leave his behind. “And why do they need you?”
“Fred’s first broomstick,” Arthur interrupted. Though it was clearly also George’s. The twins stood side by side on the Burrow’s lawn, freshly ten years old with short training broomsticks in hand.
“I’m going to bed.”
“If it just needs another bug – “
Hermione re-emerged a while later, just as Harry surrendered his king. She was wearing sweats, her hair down and clouded around her head and shoulders. Ron wrapped an arm around her shoulder, pressing his lips to her temple.
Ron had already owled about him? He looked away from her suspiciously eager eyes, opening the folder and reading. The balance was on the first line.
He frowned at Harry, wary and disdainful somehow at the same time. Even exhausted as he was, there was a pearly sheen to his skin and a brightness to his eyes that never seemed to fade or change.
“Stay,” he said. Draco fixed him with a furious glare. But Harry knew he was afraid. Terrified, even, at the mere thought of Dolohov near the house. “You can sleep here. I’ll have Hermione double-check the wards tomorrow.”
They were very high up – glances through the keyhole windows showed more sprawling castle and what may have been a proper Quidditch pitch (he’d seen pictures in his books). The portraits here seemed too bored to stare, except for one. A huge Rococo of a very fat woman, spilling out of a pale pink dress and fanning herself.
“That’s…very impressive,” she admitted, with an aggravated shake of her head. “Damn.”
“Not for long, I’m certain.”
It was quieter than Harry would have thought possible. Ron’s mother put a protective hand on his other arm, gripping tightly.
“Harry,” the man said, putting his hand over the wound and pressing gently. Like an apology. “Your name is Harry Potter.”
Some intrinsic, unforgettable part of him reared up in a competitive rage, and he followed after as fast as he could. She won that round, and gloated plenty, but the next wasn’t so easy. Or the one after. Any time either of them got a clear breakaway, some sort of benign curse or slowing charm would hit them from the ground, throwing them off just long enough for the other to catch up.
“Curry lunch?” Dean invited him, throwing a thumb to the lifts. “Gallahey’s meeting us.”
He stared into the fire Harry had just lit, eyes wide in a manic way as he took another sip. “I never drank as much as I should. I never cared about mealtimes, or where I slept. There was only the work.”
“Yeah.” Ron pushed up on his elbows. “Maybe George snuck a Giggle Gummy into my tea this morning.”
Castor remained on his rock, flaring his hood toward the kitchen, eyes focused on the intruder. But the intruder was focused on something else.
“Why?”
“If he wasn’t, the curtains wouldn’t have opened.”
“Yeah? Of course.”
One of his pawns met Harry’s. He took it. “I…lost my brother. Fred.”
“What exactly has he forgotten?” Ron’s father asked.
George gave him a look for his polite tone. “Officially? Two years. I think. We were best mates in school, the three of – erm, but he moved abroad after the war.” He glanced away, crossing his arms. “I actually wanted to tell you something…but I didn’t know exactly how.”
“We’ll just pretend you’re showing me your favorite bits. How’s that sound?”
Teddy shook his head. “You didn’t mention anything big. Was it a Death Eater? You caught one?”
The irony wasn't lost on Harry that he'd had to prove the same thing to Hermione earlier that week.
“I knew you,” he said after a few moments of silence. Draco finally met his eyes, warily and almost unwillingly. “Enough to testify at your trial.
“Oh.” Harry felt quite silly. “Temporary name for Teddy’s owl. I just made it up.”

“Oh, well. His loss.”
He handed Harry a pumpkin pasty.

“That looks interesting," he pointed.
“What?”
“I did.” He sat at the edge of the mattress, propping one leg up. “Dean and Seamus.”
. He hadn’t lowered his wand. “Are you serious?”
The only decoration was another bottle of whisky. It sat empty on the night table, pinning under it a folded sheet of parchment. He picked it up.
It wasn’t Sunday, so they must have gathered here just for him. For the first time, he started to hope he wasn’t a lost cause, after all. If the Weasleys liked him, he
“Professor, may we have the room?” She asked pointedly, hanging her cloak on a hook. The space was small and warm. Four armchairs, some artwork, and a large wardrobe adorned the walls. One of them housed a thin man, deep green robes draped over his crossed legs. He was rather handsome, though his curious expression turned sour as he met Harry’s eyes. With a snap, he closed his book and strode off through another door. All without a word.
“It’s over.” She looked up, smiling sympathetically. “We were in there for three hours.”
“Forgive me,” he said, sounding sincere. “It’s the wine.”
“SLYTHERIN!” The green half exploded, matching her volume impressively. The green team circled the pitch once, fists raised. The audience was a bit hard to control after that, until a fifteenth figure kicked off from the ground. The announcer – Emma, Teddy informed him – introduced him as Gregory Dickson the Flying Instructor, and referee. The teams flew to meet him, getting into positions. Then someone on the ground opened a large trunk, and the balls were released.
Ron showed Harry to a room further into the flat, buzzing with nervous energy. “Who knows, maybe you’ll wake up normal and we won’t have to…”
“Okay,” Ron pushed up, a pile of memos fisted in one hand. “Let’s delegate some of this.”
“Talking,” he scoffed, holding the door wide as she stood up. “Try
They were acquainted enough by now for Harry to know that the only questions Hermione didn’t ask were the ones she already knew the answers to.
“What?”
“I’ll hold you to it.”
The two Seekers suddenly broke apart, but the referee hadn’t yet pulled his wand. Their heads turned in the same direction to keep something in their line of sight. They looked back at each other, and then –
had been staring at Draco, and now gaped at Harry like he’d done the equivalent of swing a punch.
“’Mione.”
“Luna…” It was nice to put a face to the name. “She works with Neville. In Hogsmeade.”
Should he try to…hug him? No. That didn’t feel right. Neither did words. No specific instinct presented itself, so he waited.
“That git has been
Harry could only shake his head.

There was a shuffling behind him. Hermione had dropped to her knees, gripping the sides of the Pensieve so tightly her knuckles paled. Not looking into it, though. Looking at the side of it.
The quill hung in the air, waiting for him to take it and sign the same parchment from the day before, which had also just appeared.
“And I’d be happy not to know!” He shuddered. “Now, I want to have Butterbeers with our friends. Is that too much to ask?”
Hermione fiddled with her own wand. “Hannah went to school with us. She’s a friend.”
Harry looked up from her hand on his arm, realizing Hermione had just asked him a question. “I’m sorry, what was that?”
“I’m just listening.”
His words shook Harry to the core, even if he didn’t have enough context to make a real connection. To him, this was just a very sad story. To Ron, it was real trauma.
“Excellent!” Draco stood, putting one hand into his robes. Everyone tensed. Only Ron drew his wand. But Draco wasn’t going for an attack. Instead, he rolled a small, empty vial across the table. It clinked to a gentle stop in front of Dean, who leaned back warily.
First Class. That was quite important, wasn’t it? Perhaps not, if he’d pushed it in here. He ran his fingers absently through the hair on his chest as he walked into the closet. The robes were disappointingly dark.
“Falcons vs. Bangers. Should be good,” Dean grunted, pulling his chin up to the bar, biceps bulging. Harry focused on his own reflection and pushed himself until the weights were heavy enough to pin themselves to the floor.
Harry couldn’t gather enough of a wit to answer him, or even smile.
“There’s nothing bothering me,” he said, too defensively. “Nothing like that, anyway.”
Terror spiked through his chest, but it was nothing next to the utter agony in his abdomen as his hands were drawn sharply behind his back by thick cords. The momentum of it pushed him onto his back, his tied hands pinned under his spine and forcing his stomach to bend upwards. Whatever scream he produced was drowned out by the pounding blood in his hears.
Her eyes widened, and Harry wondered if she knew about the journal. Maybe not. Maybe she really didn’t
Hermione giggled behind him, stepping over the hump in the rug and flattening it out with her heel before helping him up. “I’ve been telling you to get rid of this thing.”
She swallowed, winding her fingers together. “This could be life or death. Can you accept that as my answer, for now?”
He smiled. “Something about my birth chart?”
Ron dropped it like he was burned, then started pushing him. Harry looked over his shoulder at the crimson red envelope flying madly after them. It was smoking. He knew it was a Howler.
There was a short, awkward silence. Dean flinched like someone had kicked him under the table. “Yeah! Yeah. You’re the best Auror the Ministry’s seen in years.”
“’Cause if we did get lucky, and found one of them…well, they won’t come easily. I think I’d rather have a chance at finding Dolohov for certain than Macnair by accident.”
“Yes, well, I had to go become an Auror before you’d let me in the Restricted Section.”
Dean and Seamus had clearly given up reading, turning their attention to Draco. Even Élise had looked up. Harry thought Draco should have sent the report ahead - no one was interested in slogging through it when he was right there to explain.
“You miss it.”
George and Fred crouched by the banister, hanging Extendable Ears over the sides. He knew exactly where the photo had been taken – he could almost see how brightly their orange shaggy heads stood stark against the cool tones of Grimmauld Place, undeterred from their troublemaking even in a place like this. He imagined Hermione and Ron’s laughter ringing, pots and pans banging as Mrs. Weasley made massive dinners. Ginny having a row with someone. Everyone standing bright against the gloom of both the house and the war, bolstered by warm fires and maroon sweaters.
Harry stuck that thought in the back of his head to ponder.
“I…I don’t see how I can be of much help.”
She planted herself in front of him, eyes dark and furious. “
“No,” Draco snapped. He shook his hands dry and picked his wand up from the table. A flick, and the neck of the wine bottle sliced right off the body, cracking into pieces on the table and spilling a good amount. “I’m not ‘starving myself’. I’ve eaten every flake of general store oatmeal that Granger dumped here.”
Harry glanced at his office door warily, somewhat glad he hadn’t actually touched anything on that shelf. It must be up high for good reason. “Does he hate me?”
Harry didn’t like it, but he couldn’t think of any valid argument. He only nodded, and Draco seemed appeased.
She shook her head. “Well, it’s strange. When you woke up, you didn’t know who I was. You knew about curses, and
Something almost –
the house he grew up in?” The Manor was Buckingham Palace compared to Grimmauld.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You never wanted my help before.”
“You were?” Harry asked a little too sharply. It was just – he had been reading the
Still listening, Harry walked to the kitchen. The beaver scurried after him, earning distrustful looks from the owl perched on the back of a chair.
“Well, that’s a bloody first!” Ron yelled. Harry bristled, clenching his fists. There was a short, tense silence while they glared at each other. No sound came from the kitchen.
“My mum thinks you have a secret girlfriend at the Ministry – “
“I must be very lucky, then.”
“No, Fleur.”
The only standing furniture other than the bed was a wardrobe. Harry eased one of the wooden doors open, met with a blue glow. Quite bright. Quite unmistakable.
I send him money? What’s my situation, exactly?”
Draco’s eyebrow twitched once in annoyance.
He crept downstairs, pulling his jacket hood up over his loose hair. The humidity made it curl over his cheeks in fluffy, obnoxious tangles. Rain pattered down on the front stoop, where he paused, watching. Draco was wearing a cloak with the hood down, an Umbrella Charm deflecting the worst of the rain. It was a little hard to believe he couldn’t see Harry standing just across the pavement.
“Yes.” He dug in his long sash, producing a single scroll of parchment and handing it over. “One of my old projects. Translating architectural hieroglyphs for a counterpart in Giza.”
Harry exhaled a laugh. ‘Unsuccessful’ biting aimed at a rough handler was less worrisome than the alternative. “Are you trying to strangle me?”
There was no one here.
“Harry,” Nevile began, right behind him. Harry turned, ready to evade whatever he was about to be asked. But before Neville could ask it, the blonde woman Zabini had been speaking to stepped down onto Harry’s bench, elbowing Neville aside. He only made room for her instead of looking angry.
A snake was a snake, though. After a leisurely few hours of hot chocolate and chips in the warm confines of the Three Broomsticks, which Hermione sulked through, he stopped at Diagon Alley, risking the Saturday crowds to duck into Magical Menagerie for some supplies. Then, on complete whim, he stopped in at Twilfit and Tattings.
Several minutes later, the darkness let up. Just slightly. The thick cloud cover revealed, briefly, a full moon. He saw with gasping relief that there was a structure rising up in the near distance. Indistinct, but it definitely man-made. People. There’d be people in there.
He nodded. “I know.”
“I asked for it,” he said simply, balancing two eggs in one hand and shifting so Harry could watch as he let them go about a foot over the pan. Instead of smashing down in a mess of shell and yolk, they hovered in place. Harry felt Draco watching him, but found himself transfixed as both eggs were cleaved in two by an invisible blow. The insides slid neatly into the basin, instantly popping and sizzling as though the pan had been heating up over flame this entire time.
“I didn’t offer out of boredom. It’s…fun.”
“Oh.” She shifted just slightly, the corner of the blanket falling over the book cover. The wireless clicked on when she pointed her wand, a disembodied voice bringing them up to date on the latest banking trends. "Just something for work.
The man was good-looking. His skin was a familiar shade of brown. Dark, wild hair tumbled to muscular shoulders. Harry idly touched his own hair, finding it to be roughly the same length.
It’s…arcane. The Darkest thing about Beauxbatons was cotillion.”
into the bin as they went. Seamus snickered.
“Are you capable of helping with this investigation?” Dean asked.
“Tell me who you are,” the stranger said in a hard voice.
“It is,” he said, clearing his throat. “It can take months, at times.”
“I don’t want to hear any more – “
“Come on, Weasley,” Debra stood and stretched, propping one hand on her hip. “It’s a brilliant idea, and we can save ourselves a month of waiting.”
Harry set his plate to the side, leaning back against the corner of the wall. “That would be difficult, seeing as she doesn’t know I’ve – well.”
“Just making conversation.”
“The man who saved me. He was…” Harry collected his memories, looking at Ron. “You attacked him.”
“Unspeakable, indeed,” he muttered darkly at the door, rubbing his cheek.
“Humor me,” Harry said. Draco sounded better. “
That was surprising to hear. And mildly devastating. Ron hesitated before saying, “Of course he doesn’t.”
Draco looked faintly surprised that Ron didn’t already know, but shook it off. “Don’t owl me again, Potter.”
She shrugged. “Probably hanging round the library.”
In the air before him, golden numbers shimmered and disappeared. Six in the morning. The room didn’t have windows, so he almost didn’t believe it. His sleep had been deep and dreamless. It wasn’t until he fished his wand out from under the pillow that he realized he’d cast the spell without it.
“Dunno,” he said darkly. “Anyway, we can’t leave with the books, so we’ll probably be back.”
No answer. Draco’s quill scratched jerkily around, his shoulders hunched forward. Harry wondered if his presence had helped at all, or if it would have been like this anyway.
“That,” she said lowly, pointing a finger at him. “Is

“You’re extremely important.” Hermione’s eyes were more pained than her voice let on. “You’ve always hated the word, but you’re something of a…celebrity.”
“This explains a lot, you know.”
“'Course he didn't,” Seamus scoffed. “Malfoy, taking a favor from Harry? What’d you expect?”
He grunted in surprise as Ginny slammed herself straight into him, gripping his broom as to not topple right off and realizing too late that he’d dropped the Quaffle. She was already racing off with it.
Harry pulled on a jumper, coaxing Castor over his shoulders and starting the morning with tea and signing his name on a tall pile of papers Ron must have dropped off while he was sleeping.
Harry thought he’d emphasized that name a little too hard, but he just nodded.
on him, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t change his mind. Draco didn’t look worried about it, though. A slow, thin smile spread over his face.
“I just…feel like I’ve used it. Quite often, in fact.”
“Well, think about it.” Harry set the paper aside. “You’re up there, five hundred yards, it’s already
“Summon my glasses for me,” Harry requested, squeezing the bridge of his nose. “And maybe my wand.”
“I remember that,” Ron said at Harry’s ear, crowding in like the rest around the back of the couch. “I’m still crying in this photo because they’d Stuck a mousetrap to my foot that morning – “
The hallway opened up into a sitting room. Every piece of furniture was a light green color, so he figured he’d found the conservatory. And there was the mahogany door. Etched expertly to depict a very tall, bearded man holding a book in one hand and a quill in the other. He had emeralds for eyes, too.
After several tense seconds, Ron nodded. “When can you start?”
“You look like you’re having a good time,” Hermione said, like the concept was completely foreign.
. I’ve never seen a happier kid.”
Teddy’s bemusement was evident. He hopped onto the empty professors desk, legs swinging nervously. “What’s up?”
“Harry Potter!” A young, blonde girl shrieked. Her friends hurriedly tried to cover her mouth, wary of the firewhisky in her hand and casting him apologetic glances. He walked faster.
“Seriously – what is going on?” Harry asked again. “Hermione?”
she couldn’t talk about it? “Isn’t Mal – Draco coming in today?”
“All of us, at the Quidditch games,” Hagrid boomed. A massive mane of shaggy gray hair fell over his shoulders, as long as the great beard that Ron was currently suffocating into. “Like ole’ times, innit?”
The rain came to a slow stop, the quiet absolute. Despite the looming structure in front of him, he knew that this must be the absolute middle of nowhere. No halo of light pollution marred the sky. The air smelled too…clean. His brain was processing all of this in ways he didn’t understand. It was clinical and sharp, but like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces that kept changing shape. He couldn’t quite put it together.
Harry nodded. “You thought I was an imposter. Polyjuiced, or something.”
She gave him a strangely irritated look. “Oh, you must spend more time with her instead of getting an impression through Ron and Hermione.”
They went on like that for a while, spouting utter nonsense about the flowers until the words stopped coming, and they were down to
They’d moved from early childhood to adolescence. Now Harry showed up in the pictures, one brown and black mess of knobby knees and wild hair shoved in with the orange and freckles. He stood out, but also fit right in.
She shook her head. “I’m sure mum has some old
