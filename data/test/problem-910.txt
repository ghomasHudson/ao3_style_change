Later on, while they were at the party, it was finally time to draw names for the gift exchange, and Draco could not find the ability to calm his nerves. He had been drinking far more than he usually did to help him with picking a name, but in the end, it didn’t help and he was far more anxious than he had intended. He became even more so when he was the first person given the hat to pick a name from, that meant he could end up with literally any one of Harry’s friends, or even Harry himself, and Draco wasn’t sure of how good of an impression he would be able to make.
This year though, Draco had already decided, was going to be different, he was going to stop letting his nervousness get in the way and participate in the gift exchange that his friend wants him to do so desperately. He woke up early the day that the small party was going to be held, and spent all morning getting ready. He knew perfectly well why he was so nervous, why he had to be completely presentable, and it wasn’t because it would be the first year he would be participating in the silly game, it would be because, like every year, he would be standing next to Harry Potter and trying to make the best impression possible for both Harry and his friends.
During the next few weeks, Draco was acquiring as much information about all three places that Harry often spoke of, mostly what they smelled like. And once he got that, he began making. He didn’t stop until he had three small candles in front of him. One labeled, First Home, another labeled, Family Home, and the final labeled, Chosen Family Home; for Hogwarts, Godric’s Hollow, and the Burrow, respectively. Draco smiled wide every time he looked at the candles, knowing Harry would love them, knowing that it would give him a feeling of hopefully happy nostalgia.
Harry’s smile got brighter when he turned to look at Draco. Something about his comment earlier must have done something to him, he thought, because Draco’s hair wasn’t all fixed up, in fact, it just flopped down all over, obviously dried, but nothing was done to it And it made Harry’s heart swell.
“Wait!” Harry said quickly, grabbing Draco’s wrist before he could leave, “I just wanted to tell you that you look lovely… like this,” he paused, Draco’s eyes burning holes into his body, “It’s just, you always look so perfect, it’s like a breath of fresh air, to see you with flaws. Though I wouldn’t call your hair being a flaw, whatsoever. But I think you know what I mean.” he finished, letting Draco’s wrist go and his hand drop to his side.
When it was time again, for everyone to meet up for a Christmas party and give each other the gifts, it was at Harry’s house. Draco had already been there long before anyone else was, and after constant light hearted teasing, Draco finally gave up.
Despite how confusing and surprising it was for the two of them to quickly become attached, it wasn’t all too much so when Harry started bringing Draco to gatherings with their friends. He fit in quite well, getting along with all of Harry’s friends and participating in the banter. Every year Harry would drag Draco along to their small holiday celebrations, and push him to participate in the       Secret Santa that the group liked to do, but Draco never did.
Draco looked over at the small bag on the dining table that he brought with him sheepishly, “I made it actually if you want to see?” he began walking over to the table and picking up the bag. He brought it back over to where Harry was leaning against the counter casually.
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter became close friends after the war. They were always the type of people to put their all into anything that involves the other. In Hogwarts, their rivalry was fiery and passionate, and it could've burned houses down. Now their friendship was just the same, but instead of their assassins going against each other they were working together. Anyone who saw how their friendship was wouldn’t expect their friendship to last long at all, they expected it to run its course and blow up just as loud and large as their friendship started.
Harry would often talk about wanting to return home, but he wasn’t quite sure of what or where home was. He would say that maybe it was Hogwarts, his first true home, but maybe it was the Burrow or even Godric’s Hollow, he was never sure but he often talked about when he is home it feels like he’s grounded. Like he actually belongs on the Earth. Harry never explicitly told Draco, but he knows that he's really the only person that knows these things, and Draco felt endlessly grateful that Harry trusts him enough for him to know this.
While Draco was thinking back on the memories of the conversations he had with Harry in the dark, with only a fireplace flickering across their face, he figured out what to get Harry. He knew it would help Harry feel grounded, and feel like he was home. Draco also wanted to make it with his hands, thinking that Harry would feel even more appreciated knowing it was handmade.
Harry stood there, stunned for a moment, seeing Draco, just a little bit off from perfection, “Uh yeah, of course, let’s go in,” he stammered out.
Ron and Hermione were a bit confused watching this happen, it seemed like a light switch that changed the behavior of Harry. One second he and Draco were casual friends, the next they couldn’t be separated, if you wanted one you would most likely be getting the other. It was as if they were catching up on lost time with borrowed time. The pair of them shared as many secrets and stories as they could. Telling the other what they’ve always desired, and what they’ve always hidden.
“Claudia Van Otten does not exist, nor was there ever any arranged marriage. It was all a test, Son, to see just how serious you were about your relationship with Potter. It seems as though I was wrong, if you’re willing to give everything up for the boy. If this is what you want, then I will allow it. However, I do expect an Heir, somehow. You’re a creative young man; you’ll find a way,” Lucius said confidently, holding back his laughter at the sheer shock he saw written across his son’s face.
The rest of the week passed by very quickly, a comfort to Harry, who had grown increasingly lonely and missed his best friends dearly. He was excited for the new school year to start up so that the castle would be teeming with students instead of cold and deathly silent. Just after dinner on the last day before the other students would arrive, Dumbledore asked Harry to come up to his office to talk about some things.
Abigail fought the urge to blush, giving a cheeky smile. “Did he, now? That sod isn’t going around shouting it from the roof tops is he?” she teased, knowing Severus would never do such a thing. In fact, she remembered that Severus had hated Remus while in school, so why did he make it sound like they were buddy-buddy now?
Harry squirmed uncomfortably as he avoided the man’s gaze still. He hated to seem so weak, so desperate in front of Snape, but he was so hungry. He knew it was time to swallow his pride and allow someone to take care of him, even if it was someone who supposedly hated him. “Hogwarts End of Term feast, but I didn’t eat very much. I wasn’t hungry, not after what happened to – ” Harry cut himself off before saying Sirius’ name, the memory still very raw and painful.
“Oh please, no,” Draco groaned, burying his already flaming face in his hands. Harry nudged him painfully in the ribs, but Draco just ignored him.
“Hey, Severus. We were talking about his move from the hospital wing, but he fell asleep. He hates sleeping alone, so he’s not getting much while stuck in here,” Harry whispered from his place beside Draco, still running his fingers through silky blonde hair.
Remus looked down at the cloak he had been preparing to clasp around his neck and sighed, handing it off to Snape instead. “You’ve no organization when you’re in a hurry, you know that?”
Remus shook his head as he pushed the paper aside. “No, not technically. Severus will only get the position should the curse render me from teaching more than one term in a row. There’s still a possibility that I can teach continuously.”
“I like Ophelia. I think it’s pretty,” Harry said, smiling broadly at the thought of having a baby sister. He had been so excited when he heard the baby was a girl that he had nearly done flips, but settled on jumping up and down and pumping his fist in the air, a move worthy of Ron.
Remus shuddered as well, glancing over at Ron who was greeting his girlfriend with a chaste kiss. “Yes, I hadn’t really been aware of it until Ron told the story, actually. Bloody lucky he is, having Fawkes around to save him.”
Harry shook his head to clear it as he tried to understand all of Hermione’s jumbled questions as he was hugged excruciatingly tight by his best friend.
Severus sighed as he pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a few seconds to calm himself before looking back up at his godson, who was glaring defiantly back at him. This was going to be a difficult situation to deal with, he was absolutely sure of it.
Severus took the vial and opened the next in the short row on the table. “I didn’t say it was going to be pleasant, did I?” Severus drawled as he held out the next vial. “Pain Relieving potion; no doubt the internal bleeding caused most of your discomfort, but you have been through quite an ordeal and will most likely start to ache soon.”
Severus’ hand paused on Harry’s leg as he stared at the pale teen. “What? Are you absolutely certain this wasn’t a dream, that it was really Narcissa?” he asked quickly, feeling his heart sink as he realized it couldn’t possibly have been a dream because of the potion.
“You obviously remembered something! That’s what you used to call him all the time, Draco. Where’s your Rememberall?” Harry asked excitedly.
Harry frowned at Draco’s tone of voice. He sounded just like the bratty Slytherin he’d always been at school. “Maybe he just forgot, Malfoy. Not everything is a plot to undermine people, you know. There are such things as compassion and worry,” Harry snapped.
“The stone is not necessarily dark, Remus. We could do it,” Severus whispered, turning to his husband. His eyes were desperate, almost crazed, and Remus knew the man was only trying to deal with the pain in the way he knew how; find a solution.
“Thank you, sir. I’ll try my best to find some more information. I hope Ron heard one of them as well, that could really help,” Hermione said, excited and anxious enough to run straight to the library from the dungeons. She could do this; this was what she was good at. She would help wake Draco up...she would give Harry his muse back.
Draco rolled his eyes, but allowed Harry to pull him closer. His smile was genuine as he cupped the Gryffindor’s cheek. “What exactly do you want as a reward, Harry? ‘Reward’ is a very broad term.”
“Yes you can. There is no choice. Be brave, my son. I am right here with you,” Severus said in a harsh whisper. With great reluctance, he released his hold on Harry’s arm and scanned around the chaos that was beginning to ensue. It was dark, and the only thing that could really be seen were spells reflecting off of Death Eater masks, including his own that he had worn as a diversion tactic.
“Just wait until the meeting tonight at least, Severus. I’m sure you won’t be able to contain your questions then,” Remus said, earning himself a glare from the Potions Master.
Harry thought about it for a few seconds, but Snape was actually right. He usually did feel a strong emotion from Voldemort soon before getting a flash of what he was seeing. “Yes, actually. So…to see if someone is lying, you have to detect whether or not they’re nervous or scared or something?” Harry asked, still not quite understanding what emotions depicted lying.
“Er, I’ll just go start on my homework, then,” he said awkwardly as he trouped down the hall to his bedroom and quickly ensconced himself at his desk, setting out the things he needed to finish up on a few essays set earlier in the week.
Severus’ stared at Remus for a few seconds, not quite believing his ears. He didn’t register the fact the Remus’ arm was still resting against his bare shoulders. “He came…But – how? How on earth did he know where Headquarters was?”
She woke almost with the sunrise and showered before her dorm mates could use all of the hot water. Deciding what books she would need for classes and studying purposes, Hermione would pack her book bag accordingly, and carry it down to breakfast with her. Upon loading her plate with the proper servings of each food group, the Gryffindor would then retrieve one of her books, and commence studying until Ron and Harry showed up for breakfast as well. If it was a weekday, she would head off to class at least ten minutes early, and if it was a weekend, she would head straight for the library after finishing her breakfast foods.
“It’s alright, I understand. How is he?” Harry asked as Remus led him back to the table and took a seat beside his son. He was glad when Draco stood and prepared them both a fresh cup of tea and remembered that the young Slytherin was probably as worried as he and Harry were; Severus
“I know it's really late, but I really need to talk to Hermione. Could you go and wake her for me, please?’ Harry asked as politely as he could, cringing at the desperation in his own voice.
“Harry, you really should be eating more. You’re still far too thin, and you’ll undoubtedly start Defence training this summer. You need to keep your strength up,” Hermione admonished as she watched her friend push his nearly full plate of food away.
As they passed the display of Quality Quidditch Supplies, Draco let out a deep sigh, frowning into his cup of cocoa.
Remus chuckled at the expression on Harry’s face. He looked so like his father, sometimes it made his chest hurt. Thinking about James made him think of Sirius, which in turn made him think of what Harry had walked in on.
Harry instinctively tuned him out as Fudge stood at the podium just to the side of the pure white marble tomb and began his speech. He had no interest whatsoever in what the former Minister had to say about Dumbledore. The man was a tool and had only made life more difficult for the late Headmaster by refusing to work with the Order. A lot of Harry’s own regrets could have been avoided if Fudge had just listened to Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort’s return, Sirius would probably still be alive, and Voldemort wouldn’t be as brave and bold as he’d been lately. Harry had no idea why the man was even speaking at Dumbledore’s funeral, but he ignored it anyways.
“The Headmaster is, occasionally, correct when he speaks of such things. Speaking of which, what did he want to discuss with you?” Severus asked, setting his cup of tea aside as he focused his full attention on his son, who looked suddenly very uncomfortable.
Severus placed the tip of his wand to Draco’s temple and muttered a few Latin words before pulling it away, a long gossamer strand of silver trailing from the blonde tresses. He quickly dropped the memory into the green bottle that Remus held out to him, twisting the cap closed and placing it on the small table beside Draco’s bed. Severus reached over and wiped the tear from the Slytherin’s cheek. “It’s gone now, no need to cry, Dragon.”
“That was different! Snape already knew about the Prophecy and that it puts me in grave danger! This, though…Draco, what that man did to you was
Before he could walk back up to the library to tell the others, he noticed that a door off of the downstairs sitting room was ajar, a door that led to the overgrown backyard of the old house. With a sigh and a heavy heart, Severus slipped through the back door.
There were many nods and comments of agreement from all around the table, especially from the few Aurors there. Minerva nodded her assent and Remus wrote it down in his notes.
shopping for my mum or dad. I see so many things they would like, but then I remember they can never have those things. It’s like its fresh...even if I grieved before, I don’t remember it, and so I’m grieving again. I’m sorry; I don’t mean to be such a black cloud.”
Harry turned so that he was facing Snape, his knees still pulled firmly up to his chest. This was the hardest part – the part where he left himself open, vulnerable. This is where he trusted Snape more than he ever had before. He glanced up at last and met the deep, dark eyes of his Professor. They seemed a little brighter than usual, which nearly shocked Harry into silence.
the castle. The only way we can remedy this situation is to completely strip the wards and reapply them.”
“Yeah, I hear you. I won’t. I just want to get this over with. Thank you guys for…everything. You’ve always been there for me, and I’m so glad to call you my best friends.”
Harry smiled at the clear concern in Severus’ voice and nodded as he held up the scroll for Severus to see. “Remus has written.”
away from my family from now on, my parents included. You’re not welcome with us anymore. I don’t want you near them or speaking to them again, you hear me?
Severus shook his head as he studied the boy. What was he playing at, not telling anyone he had needed new glasses for many years? It was as if the boy was frightened to ask for help. “Harry, why did you never tell Madam Pomfrey that you needed a new prescription? She could have easily updated your glasses for you.”
They both laughed as they continued on their journey down to the dungeons, feeling much more light-hearted now than they had at the beginning of the evening. Not even the imminent danger of Snape’s death glare and scathing remarks could take away Harry’s good mood.
Harry nodded as he popped open the vial and knocked back the violet liquid, burrowing down into his pillows and blankets. He smiled as Draco kissed him gently on the forehead before heading to bed himself. Just as his vision was starting to fade and sleep began to take over, Harry saw his parents share a worried look, but he thought of it no more as the darkness took him.
“Did I warn you that this is going to be very unpleasant? And slimy?” Ron asked with a gulp as he pushed open the door and led the way in.
What kind of sick, twisted person would ever do those things to another human being, especially against their will? Draco’s stomach revolted once more as he finally realized that this was most likely not just some sick dream; it was a memory.
Harry saw the panic in Ron’s eyes as well as what looked frighteningly like tears and his amusement vanished. He crossed the space between them and sat beside Ron on the sofa as opposed to across from him. This didn’t sound good.
“Oh, and what did Mr. Weasley say about Professor Lupin that you would deem so Slytherin?” Severus asked, not really caring, but needing the excuse for the points he was about to take.
Harry smiled sadly, knowing exactly who Remus was referring to. Not knowing how his father would react, Harry didn’t bother to mention Sirius at all. He was curious, however, about the Potion Master’s experience.
” Nothing happened, even as the two men and one teen stood and waited for a good five seconds – if it had rolled far, it would take some time to travel back.
Severus nodded slowly, keeping his eyes trained on Harry, who was trying his hardest to avoid eye contact at all. “He’s calmed down, yes, but he’s under the impression that you are quite upset with him and will never go to visit him again.”
Hadn’t Harry sacrificed enough for the bloody people already? He’d lost his parents, was nearly killed himself, had a piece of Voldemort’s soul attached to his own soul, had a horrible, hate-filled childhood, battled the monster and his stupid minions time and again and tried to protect
dark magic. I don’t even know the full extent of the magic; I just know it’s horribly dark, and that I should never have found out about it at all. You’re not saying that Voldemort made one, are you?”
Severus moved forward and helped lift Draco from the stretcher to the hospital bed, feeling a sense of revulsion as Draco’s limp and slightly cold body lay still in his hands. It looked and felt too much like Draco was dead instead of merely asleep, and it greatly bothered Severus. He moved away from the bed as both Abigail and Madam Pomfrey began covering Draco up and positioning him more comfortably.
“You’re such a fool, Remus,” Severus said quietly as he pulled his bond-mate into a tight hug, breathing in his scent as he revelled in the solid feel of holding his lover once more. He was still angry, but his relief at having Remus back with him over-powered everything else. He was pulled into a deep kiss that was bordering on indecent in front of their child, and it broke only when Harry began to laugh behind his hand, blushing enough for all three of them.
Hermione’s melancholy shell seemed to crack under the loving gaze Ron fixed her with. She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him in for a short kiss, snuggling her head into the crease between his neck and shoulder. “I love you, Ron Weasley.”
Remus smiled warmly at the Gryffindor and pulled him into a quick hug. “Of course you can. I don’t want to hold you back from lunch too long. Have a good day, Harry.”
Harry looked around to make sure no one else was listening in, and sent a smile to Hermione as he caught her looking down suspiciously at the crumbled parchment in his hand. She smiled back and turned back to hers and Ron’s potion once more. “A note from Dumbledore, actually. Our next meeting is tonight.”
Harry stood still as he tried to wrap his head around what Parkinson was saying, before realizing she was apologizing.
— Malfoy. Harry turned and found himself face-to-face with platinum blonde hair. He moved back and looked down into Malfoy’s face. Merlin, he hadn't realized he'd gotten so tall. He stared at Malfoy, caught in how dull the normally bright grey eyes looked until he felt a finger poke his stomach.
(he would have to get in the habit of calling her by her last name) had said to watch out for him, to “be kind.” If there was one thing Harry knew he could do, it was being kind. Even if it meant making amends with your arch-nemesis.
The more he looked, the more he realized, the brash blonde was gone; the annoying pointy git was gone; the bravado, the arrogance, the high-horse posture — all of it was gone. Malfoy was gone. No, now all that there was left was Draco. Draco was afraid… quiet…  ashamed. Draco, Harry decided, was who he wanted to know. After years of knowing Malfoy, Harry was ready to meet Draco. His mind made up, Harry walked over to the fireplace and stood right in front of Draco’s chair, clearing his throat to get the blonde’s attention.
, he tells me a lot of stuff at night, stuff about his life at the Manor when he was growing up, his life at Hogwarts — well, his side of things, mostly stuff about the war, and — he told me about his life after the trials, and how — how Goyle killed himself, and how he had felt when Crabbe died, and –”
McGonagall looked at him through her glasses, the familiar soul-staring look brushing over him. “Very well, Mr. Potter, please take your seat, so that I may continue to the feast.” She walked away briskly.
When Harry walked back into the Great Hall, the first thing he noticed wasn’t the new teachers, or the half-enchanted ceiling, or even the fact that there were five tables instead of four. No, what he noticed first was the flash of blonde hair that only meant one thing — or rather, one person. Somehow, Malfoy had got here before any of them and was now sitting down, shoulders hunched, looking very un-Malfoy-like.
“I shouldn’t do anything dangerous in front of him, of course,” murmured Malfoy in an undertone, his cool, grey eyes on Harry’s.
“Mm,” said Harry, trying to tamp down his impatience at not instantly understanding. But he placed his hand on the door as Malfoy instructed.
“It’s a bit funny to think about,” Luna said thoughtfully. “But he’s so much nicer than he was at school, so I don’t think anyone’s going to mind if you like each other now, Harry. No one who matters anyway.”
Ron gave him a friendly slap on the back, “Rosie likes me to walk her so she can chat to me. I think if she isn’t continually talking, her head might fall off.”
Ginny and Bill were sat at a nearby table, but their attention was caught anyway. They and Hermione looked round.
Ginny let out a nervous laugh, “Well that’s good. I’d hate to have to hex you. Still reserving the right, mind you.”
Harry spared one moment to cast a Shield Charm on Theodore, then flung himself between his godson and the monster. He almost laughed aloud in relief when the creature’s shape wavered, then with a loud crack and a waft of rotting stench shifted into a Dementor.
“Yes!” Harry rocked up to help, and Draco met his thrust with a loud smack, rolling and bouncing and tossing his hair, showering them both in its jasmine fragrance, mingled with the deliciousness of Draco’s sweat. Draco grabbed hold of Harry’s shoulders for leverage, rocking on top of him and dribbling smears of pre come on Harry’s stomach.
When he Hovered a plate of sandwiches and a jug of pumpkin juice into the sitting room a quarter of an hour later, he found Theodore sitting on the floor, his stocking feet folded under him, while he sorted through the collapsed pile of tapes.
Harry reached into his coat pocket for his cap and stretched it over his coils at once with a hard shiver, “I was going to suggest we go for a nightcap, but I may have frozen to the pavement, actually.”
“I definitely agree with you on that, Theo. Very stupid.” Harry drew a deep breath, “Theodore, I want you to know I love you very much, okay? You’re my favourite person in the whole world, and nothing’s ever going to change that. All right?”
“Well, I wouldn’t have lived through it all if Harry hadn’t rescued me, actually. And I’d realised beforehand that the life I was living wasn’t getting me any of the things I wanted and that if I did survive, I’d have to figure out another way to live. And. After being around so much suffering, I just didn’t want to be a part of it anymore. I was very, very lucky because I got another chance. Most people who did what I did died doing it.”
Harry laughed, “Well he deflated his head a bit after leaving school. But I mean, he was handsome and funny and clever and loud, and like. Pathologically game for a laugh. And spoiled and rude and a bit er. Full of himself. No offence.”
Draco rocked against Harry as if he were begging, as if Harry would ever make him beg, “Would you please fuck me? That’s what I want.”
“Are you a werewolf also?” Theodore asked, almost inaudibly and looking past the welcome wizard with his chin lowered so that his spectacles slipped down his nose.
“Mate, don’t try it. I saw you with the Marauder’s map, watching him all night every night sixth year.”
“Not exactly,” Draco said after a moment. “At first I desperately wanted Harry to like me, but he rumbled at once that I was a completely horrible, spoiled little tick, and he didn’t like me at all, no matter what I did. It didn’t occur to me to try and be nice, so I mainly showed off as hard as possible and made a lot of very unpleasant jokes and was generally foul and a complete nuisance.”
Harry shrugged, “That’s not terrible. Politer than half my fan mail, so long as you didn’t also send along a love potion or a lock of your hair or dirty knickers.”
“So this means. You’ll be doing the whole decontamination and the removals yourself? You’re coming back?”
A young, pretty witch who introduced herself as Priti gave them a tour, showing them a hydroponic garden where the Centre grew herbs for brewing wolfsbane, sleeping draughts and pain potions, a seminar room where patients learned first aid spells and how to brew sleep and pain potions and even wolfsbane brewing courses for patients with at least five years potioneering study, a nook full of bookshelves that Priti called the resource library, and a handful of rooms at the very back for individual, family, and group counseling. Theodore was rather quiet and looked about him with wide eyes, but Harry asked lots of questions.
Malfoy’s expression went rather opaque, “I’m afraid not. I really must be getting on.” He turned to Harry, hefting his notebook, “I’ll write it all up and owl you the order, then see you Monday?”
“You’re trying to make me gush, and I’ll do it just to embarrass you. I absolutely gobbled them up, and I’m in agonies for the third one. You have a fascinating mind; your imagination staggers me. You can’t think how difficult it’s been not to mention them at all to you these last few days. How’s that?”
Draco shook his head and answered around his mouthful of pie, “‘ll’ve a drdfl hngvr ‘f do. Dsnt mx w wlfsbn.”
“It’s all right.” Draco smoothed his hair, as if getting embarrassed had mussed him, “Mind how you talk to me in future. I’m going to be a ravening beast presently, and I could easily tear you apart with my fangs, Harry Potter.”
Draco eased himself up into a half sitting position, leaning against Harry for support and swallowed down half the Strengthening Solution in two gulps. Then he was able to sit back against the headboard and sip the pain potion a little more slowly. He was paler than Harry had seen him in a long time and still tense with discomfort and sluggish with weariness, though he was moving a little easier now.
“Good afternoon, Potter. It smells delightful in here. I hope it’s something I’m welcome to eat. By the way, you look cute in that pinafore.”
Theodore thought about it, “Not really. Hang on. Draco said sometimes it could make people unsafe? Is that it?”
“I suppose it was in retrospect. Says he knows you from his granny’s photos. I didn’t know his granny had any pictures of your side of the family.”
After breakfast, Harry went to his library to write. He got on well enough, but decided to leave it after a couple of hours and went back to the sofa with Pride and Prejudice. One of Draco’s little paper birds found him again just as he’d started to think about lunch.
“Mmno,” Draco caught Shadowfax in time to prevent her from stealing half a fried egg off Harry’s plate and kissed her on the top of the head. “Finish here, if you like. The smell of breakfast food is terribly relaxing.” He shut his eyes, his breathing already deepening.
“I just. Something ha--er it occurred to me recently that you might have thought I was upset that you’re gay, but that wasn’t. I’m not. I wasn’t.”
Draco looked about also, “There don’t seem to be any other patrons just at the moment. I imagine someone’ll come along some time or other.”
“It’s all right.” Harry smiled, “Everyone tries to give me writing advice. For all I’m supposedly so inventive, no one seems willing to let me get on with it like I know what I’m doing.”
Draco shook his head, “No, actually. She’s very clearly inspired by Granger, so what you’re communicating to the wizarding world about yourself is your outsized desire to avoid the spotlight. Still you can’t help being kind of fantastic, can you?”
“Oh. Yes, of course. The library. Time flies when you’re having fun.” Draco rose and Vanished the settee, then followed Harry out of the room.
Once the film started up again, Draco was rapt. He watched in hypnotised amazement, stealing occasional looks at Harry, as if for confirmation that he was really seeing what he thought he was seeing. He laughed and gasped and snorted and jumped in all the right places. It was most satisfying. Besides, in the first tense moment, he grabbed hold of Harry and tugged him closer, then spent the rest of the film tucked against Harry’s side and clutching his pyjamas at various intervals. Harry very much enjoyed that.
The more Harry thought about it, the more ideas rose to the surface of his imagination, scrambling against each other for position. “Yeah,” he broke into a slow smile. “Yeah, I think. Maybe I could.”
“I turned up and surprised you,” Malfoy said, ticking off on his fingers. “But I did get the chameleon ghoul out of Theodore’s room. No charge. And you shouted at me and asked me invasive questions, but then you gave me these extremely nice scones. So I can’t take any with me, or you’ll be ahead.”
“Ah, well that’s the first clue! A picture hung in the ordinary way will have some sort of fixture. Screws or nails or even Spell-o-Tape in a pinch. Now watch this carefully.” Draco pushed his free hand into the gap between the edge of the frame and the wall, “See the way my finger blurs just the tiniest bit? That’s the spell, and that clinches it. Definitely a Permanent Sticking Charm. Now that we’ve discovered we can’t get the frame off the wall whatever we do, how do you suggest we get rid of the portrait?”
Harry’s grin stretched so much that he thought the corners of his mouth might meet round the back, “You’re not being serious.”
“Yes, she seems to think of me as a sort of gigantic little brother. It’s very annoying,” Draco belied his words by kissing his cat on the top of the head. “She’s terribly pushy and bossy and insists on sitting on me.”
Harry tossed a pinch of Floo powder into the cold fireplace, and immediately a cheerful green fire blazed up in the grate.
Draco turned that over in silent consideration long enough to make Harry feel quite antsy. “I think I do know what you mean,” he said slowly. “I don’t know if I believe in a do-over exactly. But. I do agree that. Well. I think that I’ve known for a very long time that you have to be willing to change to stay alive. And it’s good to have something to. Change toward.”
Draco handed Twinkle’s basket back to Theodore when they were all through to Platform 9 ¾. Theodore took it absently, but his eyes were fixed on the scarlet steam engine.
“Oh yes, since before you woke up,” Draco said with a little laugh as he seated himself astride Harry. “There’s a spell. I’ll teach it to you some time. Are you ready?”
Harry raised his wand to light the wall sconces, since Theodore’s bedside lamp had been destroyed, then sat down on the bed, “Erm. Theo, I want you to know that’s not what werewolves are like, okay? The boggart was meant to be a werewolf, yeah? When Remus transformed, he looked like an ordinary wolf. So, er. When you do start transforming when you get older, you won’t ever be that. All right?”
Through the window, they could see Theo’s friends converge on him to greet and hug him and admire his kitten. Theodore stuck his head out of the window Ara had just vacated to wave briefly to them, then as the train began to pull away from the platform, he withdrew his head and was lost in the crush of students in the corridor.
Dean offered Theo a handshake, “Dean Thomas. It’s a real pleasure. Your dad was a good man. Best teacher Hogwarts has ever seen.”
“I still don’t see what this has to do with Theodore?” said Dudley patiently, chasing a last bit of gravy from his plate with a crust of bread.
“I might ask Draco,” Theo suggested. “I suppose he could tell me all about curses and monsters and things.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Anyway, the room wasn’t sealed up because I was afraid of it. Well I didn’t think it was dangerous anyway. I just sort of. Thought I wouldn’t be able to bear it.”
The most comfortable, cheerful room in the house was still the kitchen, and it was there that Harry and Theodore arrived by Floo after they left the ice cream parlour. Theodore looked round approvingly, taking in the braided rugs Luna’d given Harry to cover the unforgiving stone floor, the burnished copper cookware on the rack above the stove, the cheery yellow bowl of apples on the broad wooden table, the pothos already beginning to creep out of its dangling basket.
Ron laughed, then added, “And it’s like a generational thing, isn’t it? People her age think it’s not nice to talk about werewolves, you know?”
Harry was rather preoccupied when he turned away from the school gates after depositing his godson beyond them, so it took him a few moments to notice he was being called out to.
“I saw him for a bit for one day. You’ve been seeing him regularly for ages. What do you make of him now?”
Theodore was surprised when he came home and found Draco still at Grimmauld Place and waiting for him beside Harry.
“Right, I’m keeping you away from Uncle George,” Harry said, giving Theo an affectionate shake by the shoulder.
“Thanks, good.” Harry let go of Theodore’s shoulder and sipped his coffee, “I’ll see if I can find my old-”
“Right-o.” Draco bent to kiss Harry, melting hot kisses, along his jaw, down his neck, along his collarbone and  back to his mouth. He licked his palm and wrapped one hand around Harry’s cock to give him occasional firmer and firmer squeezes. Harry groaned and pushed back against Draco’s hand with every squeeze. Draco pressed himself flush on top of Harry, rocking and squirming against him, his own erection scalding hot where it met Harry’s skin.
“Even among muggleborn magic users, there’s this idea that. Instead of seeing magical power as a fluke that could happen to anyone, it’s some sort of divine blessing.You’ve broken a long chain of nonmagical people because you’re the first in however many generations to deserve it. A very particular sort of magic, mind. Wizards aren’t the only ones who use magic, but we still get to make the rules about its place in the world and who’s entitled to use it and how.
All along the walls, the other portraits began to scream as well. The noise was unimaginable. Even despite his hands clamped to his ears, Harry’s head was ringing.
Harry turned to look at Malfoy. His face had gone very white, and he was gripping his left arm, where the branch had caught at him. His Dark Mark was an angry red under the pitting of the bite scar, as if it had been burned.
Malfoy had been looking at Harry’s hand and his stance before, but he fixed his cool grey eyes on Harry’s face, “Eye contact is important, but don’t think about the incantation once I start it. Think of what we’re protecting. Fix it in your mind. That’s essential. You start, and I’ll incant in a few moments. Ready?”
“Oh d’y’reckon?” Harry snapped. “He’s never even said the word werewolf to me, and you barely know him and come in and avalanche all that over him! Of course it was a bit much!”
Harry laughed heartily, “I’ll bring you one some time. Do you know hmm. Do you know what an astronaut is?”
Sure enough, the rug in front of the bed was rumpled and askew as if someone had lain on the floor and dragged themself across it. And just peeping out from under the dust ruffle was the curve of a blunt little tail, the colour of a cobweb.
“Very true,” Malfoy said quietly. “To think it slipped my mind that I’ve been looking for an opportunity to thank you.”
To Harry’s relief, Molly Weasley was still up, sat at the kitchen table with a steaming cup of tea and the copy of
He looked down into the Santa hat that Seamus supplied the group and felt his hands get clammy as he reached inside. He pulled out a slip of paper and passed the hat to whoever was standing next to him and looked down at the paper. It was, of course, Harry. Draco let out a breath but still felt nervous about this gift. While he already knew he had made a decent impression on Harry, there were a lot of options for a gift that he could give, and none of them seem to really be able to accurately show Harry how important he is.
“Dray, don’t worry,” Harry said, creeping closer until he was sitting on the bed. Up close, he could see Draco's eyes in all their glory: grey, but brighter than they had been at the start of the term. There were slight blue flecks near the edges, and they swirled silver whenever Draco had any strong emotions.
Hermione rolled her eyes, “Harry. The boy is sleeping in the same bed as you. He has told you all his secrets. What more of a sign do you need?”
“First, Mione, it’s so bloody weird hearing you curse now,” Harry responded, snorting slightly. “Secondly, because, we have these really personal talks, and I know him better as a person now, he’s so funny and cute and smart.”
He headed back to his room to grab his school bag so he could work on some essays — Herbology was due tomorrow and he hadn’t even started. It was on the Blood Orchid and its properties in potions, but Harry didn’t even know where to even begin. He should have paid more atten –
“Mione, I need your help,” Harry huffed as he sat down next to the bushy haired girl in the library.
Hermione ended the privacy with a flick of her wand, letting the quiet murmur of the library back in before pointedly turning back to her essay. Harry looked at her desperately, but ultimately, left her in the library as she became absorbed in her schoolwork.
And made eye contact. Neither of them looked away, and for once Harry could see what Malfoy was going through. The fear was overpowering, turning the grey of the blonde’s eyes into swirling whirlpools of silver. Harry was lost in the movement and ferocity, unconsciously moving closer, only stumbling to a stop when someone whispered “Harry!” loudly.
He could see Draco’s sleeping face as he slept soundly, the image of an angel: peaceful and happy, his platinum hair fanned out on the bed. He was clutching his own pillow and had the covers wrapped around himself loosely. Harry felt a rush of fondness for the boy, and realized Hermione was right: he had it bad. He crept closer, trying not to make too much noise, but his foot slipped on a shirt that he hadn’t noticed on the floor, and he fell back with a yell.
Harry thought guiltily of his withdrawal from much of the wizarding world, “It really fucking is, yeah. It’s scary.”
“It really isn’t decent to have a kip at eight o’clock in the morning, Harry,” Draco said when Harry woke again.
Similar work had been done for the sitting room, the kitchen, and the library which Harry had decided he’d do his writing in. When he considered clearing out Sirius’s old bedroom for his own use, Harry found he felt absolutely ghoulish and couldn’t bring himself to go through with it. He locked the room instead and put his things in another of the guest bedrooms. It was much smaller, but it also felt significantly less haunted.
Draco’s silvery eyes glittered with mischief, “These papers are cursed, Potter. It’s tragic, really. Going to have to Incendio them.”
“Well it’s sort of casual,” Theo agreed, nodding. “Some people don’t like it because they think it sounds a bit monstery, and they say lycanthrope instead. I usually say lycanthrope in company, but I like calling myself a werewolf because it’s cooler. It is all a bit much to take in all at once. I’ve brought you a book, though. It really helped me.”
“Beautifully done,” Draco took the canvas from Theodore when he’d finished, rolled it up tight, and sealed the roll with his wand before tucking it into his bag. “I don’t suppose you’d help me finish with the rest?
“What happened to your arm?” Harry reached out to grab hold of Malfoy’s arm for a proper look at it, then checked himself. The Mark had faded into shadowy obscurity like an old bruise, but stretched over it, warping and distorting it, was an unmistakable pink and pitted bite scar.
Harry looked in the same direction Draco was looking, and there was something rippling toward them, just submerged in the water. When it reached the shore, it broke the surface, and for a moment, it was a plump, glossy, brown seal. Then all at once, it was a stout, handsome, dark eyed man, in the same black and white uniform the hostess had worn.
Ginny shrugged, “Most people wouldn’t be thrilled about their fiance leaving them for someone else.”
Harry was quite touched. He hadn’t seen much of either of them since Hogwarts, though he’d been fond of them both at school, “Of course I’ll come.”
“Oooh thanks,” Theodore rested the bag on top of Twinkle’s basket, and she immediately began to rustle it with her claws. She did not seem to be enjoying King’s Cross.
When they arrived at the restaurant, Draco murmured to the hostess that he’d booked a table for two under Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes, “I didn’t say it was my best thing; I said it was on offer. It’s Monday afternoon tea with me and my godson, not a five course meal at the Ritz.”
Belle Brewer had felt very lively and vivid that morning, his own prose wry and charming, and if he paused to consult his thesaurus on what word he ought to use, the book seemed to fall open to just the right one. Even after pausing for lunch, Harry’s flow state continued. The keys of his typewriter clattered away under his fingers almost musically, like his hands were in perfect harmony with his brain. It was thrilling to have it all slide out so easily for so long.
“Hmm,” Harry said playfully. “You don’t mind getting distracted with sex now? Time for you to be beguiled in the fogs of lust? You know me well enough?”
“No!” Harry could feel himself blushing. “I mean yes. I mean. That’s not what I meant. Yes, of course I want to get along. I didn’t mean it like. Like before. I’m really sorry about that, by the way.”
The silence that followed was rather awkward. Harry did have something in particular on his mind, but he wasn’t sure how to bring the conversation around to the topic, as he’d made it clear in the past that it was a point he’d rather avoid. He decided that the only thing for it was blurting.
The heat in Harry’s ears was spreading across his face. He hoped it wasn’t visible on his cheeks, “Well it’s. You.” He scanned Draco’s face, taking in his thick blond lashes and brows, his laughing silvery eyes, the sharp nose and high cheekbones. The cupid’s bow curve of his lip. “I suppose people don’t choose their faces,” Harry mumbled, burning.
“Read the book, Granny,” Theodore insisted earnestly. “I don’t want you to be afraid for me anymore. I’m not afraid anymore. I have the YLHC and Draco and Harry. Harry’s really been looking after me. He’s great,” and he looked back at Harry with a little grin, as if Harry’s purported greatness were some sort of scheme they’d cooked up between them to please Andromeda. Harry gave him a hug. “Oh Granny,” said Theo in dismay when he turned back. “It’s all right, really.”
The sound of it made Harry wince, and he clenched his fists against the urge to extend a comforting but useless hand.
Draco smiled, “I know you aren’t.” There was a rough, trembling quality to his voice on his last words. “You mustn’t touch me, while I do it,” Draco continued in a husk that made the hair stand up on the back of Harry’s neck. “I won’t hurt you or anything, but it won’t help. I know you’ll want to, but-” Draco trailed off, clenching his jaw.
“Hmm,” Ginny poured out for everyone. “You know when you can’t stop thinking about like cold pie and Mum’s Sunday potatoes and parsnip mash with that little sprinkle of paprika on top and the crispy end bits of a roast and apple tart, and eventually you’re like ohhhh,” she slapped her forehead for emphasis, “
“One of the essential components of accomplishing anything specific,” remarked Draco, still whispering. “Is knowing what sort of tools to use.” Draco dug in his bag and pulled out something that Harry thought at first was a biro, til Draco took off the cap, and it turned out to be a knife with a short, very sharp blade. Of the sort one uses in model making or cutting stencils into cardboard.
“You aren’t coming to live with me because we’ve given up on Granny,” Harry said intently, resting one hand lightly on Theodore’s shoulder. “Of course we haven’t. But she does need treating, and even once she gets well, likely she’ll need quite a lot of rest. We’ve had to plan for a long stay with me to make sure you’re looked after, because that’s our job. Looking after you. Yes?”
Harry cordially invited Malfoy to have a cup of coffee with him--Harry’s third of the morning--before attending to his duties, and Malfoy cordially accepted the invitation. Harry couldn’t decide if he thought Malfoy looked more different than he had when they were at school or more the same. He was dressed in the dark blue robes of his cursebreaker's uniform, and he’d put his hair into a neat plait, then wound it into a small knot at the base of his neck. It was rather fussy, but it suited him. He looked handsome and considered.
Harry straightened a cloak on its hanger and plucked a bit of lint off it, “That’s a bit selfish. His transformations can’t be far off at this point, and he doesn’t even know what they look like. He’s gotta be terrified, poor kid. Not knowing what to expect.”
It was there that Theodore and Harry met Andromeda Tonks. She was healing slowly but well, and had so far recovered herself enough to come out in her hospital robes and fluffy purple slippers and sit with them for nearly an hour before getting tired enough that she had to go back to her room and lie down.
“But it would have gone like that for me. How it did for him in the end. If you hadn’t. Been there.”
“Well, I can’t argue with that,” said Harry and helped himself. Draco sat down and dished out his own share, and they were all quietly eating for a moment.
The fur there was so plush and thick that Harry wasn’t surprised that Draco seemed not to notice at all. He gently stroked a velvet ear instead, and Draco opened one eye that managed to look cross and sleepy.
Harry offered to take Theodore for an ice cream at Fortescue's, but Theo said it wouldn’t be fair on Twinkle. Which was what he’d named the cat. So Harry shrank the parcels for easy carrying, and they walked home. Theodore carrying Twinkle in a domed basket with a mesh over it so that she could see out and Harry carrying everything else, shrunk down to fit into a single carrier bag.
“Oh, right. I think I remember seeing something about that in the nutrition leaflet.” Harry stowed the wine and set a pitcher of gillywater on the table instead before taking a seat and digging into his own helping of pie. “So what’s on the agenda for this evening? Any last minute advice?”
He read to Draco for a long time, til his voice was hoarse and he had to conjure a glass of water to refresh himself. When he checked his watch, he found to his surprise that it was midnight. Draco had fallen asleep across his lap, warm and heavy. Harry would even have read on, but his eyes were going gritty with tiredness, so he patted Draco’s shoulder to wake him.
Theodore slumped against Harry and sobbed. Harry patted his back until his sobs subsided into hiccoughs, then conjured a stream of water into Theodore’s bedside water glass and offered it to him. Theodore drained the glass in two gulps and repeated the performance when Harry refilled his glass.
“Rowan, unicorn hair core, eleven inches and nicely springy. I made this one myself,” Dean announced cheerfully, as he rung them up. “Bit of a nursemaid it is. It’ll certainly look after you. Unicorn hair cores tend to be dead loyal to their first owner, too.”
“If you hang around with someone who’s violent with other people, they’ll get to you eventually,” Harry said.
“You did just exactly the right thing,” Harry told him. “Scream your head off til help comes and fight it off with anything you’ve got at hand. I’m so proud. That was a boggart, though. There’s a special trick to getting rid of them, as you saw. Once you’ve got your wand and a little training under your belt at Hogwarts, I’ll show you how to do it. Okay?”
“I am a werewolf,” the welcome wizard agreed cheerfully. He tapped his own howling wolf badge, which he had pinned to his cap. It read IN THE PACK at the bottom in shimmering silver letters. “I usually call myself a lycanthrope, though. Most of us working here at the Centre are. Have you been in before?”
“So you wouldn’t call your work allegorical or instructive at all? Nothing about your personal history to be inferred from it, even in subtext?”
Draco’s gaze flicked between Harry’s eyes and mouth, “Mmm, well you chose to grow that beard, and it takes up a considerable amount of your face, Potter. I suspect you’re trying to hide behind it and avoid recognition in public, but luckily it suits you. And you haven’t let it grow over your mouth. Some men will let their moustaches overgrow, and then their lips look like a dog trying to break through a hedge. Terribly inconvenient.”
“I’m just coming!” Theo yelled back, looking considerably perked up at the invitation. He gave Draco a quick hug, hoisted Twinkle’s basket in one hand, then grabbed his trunk from Harry and jumped onto the train.
Harry drew a deep breath, feeling rather squirmy on the inside, “His letters have been coming with Godric because he has been spending a lot of time at Grimmauld Place. And I’ve been spending a lot of time at his place as well. Did you know he also lives in Islington? Er, that’s not really erm. Relevant, though. We’ve been spending a lot of time together because we like each other. A lot.”
“Your dad taught me,” Harry said quietly. “Boggarts can’t actually hurt you; they’re just a bit territorial and like to scare you off, if they can. They’re telepaths, and they look into your imagination and turn into whatever they think’ll frighten you most. I’m really sorry. I didn’t know that one was still here. It was a new cupboard and everything. I must’ve missed it when I was cleaning.”
“Theodore,” Draco said seriously. “This is going to be a lot to cope with. I don’t pretend it won’t be. You will feel ill and tired at inconvenient times. And there may be some people who treat you differently or even who don’t like you. If someone is cruel to you, you should speak to your head of house. Or write to Harry. You don’t have to put up with it all on your own, and there are grownups who can help you. But you will also meet people who are going to like you and love you and not mind that you’re a bit different. You’re a wonderful person, and the lycanthropy is part of that, because it’s part of what makes you who you are.”
“And that er. That arrogance really serves us because it lets us think we’re justified in doing whatever we like to anyone who can’t stop us. So inasmuch as I’ve never seen anything that would convince me that wizarding society could rise above that very useful arrogance enough to overturn the Statute of Secrecy at any point in my lifetime, I’m not an integrationist. But I’d be very pleased to be wrong, so I suppose you could say that’s quite integrationist of me. I didn’t invent Belle’s world in an attempt to change ours into hers by sheer force of will. I invented it because I thought it would make for an interesting story.”
Harry was digging in Draco’s bag before he’d even finished speaking. He turned up the pouch and extracted the potion flasks, then used his wand to uncork them. He carried them over to the bed and passed Draco the Strengthening Solution first.
Draco laughed and put his mug of tea down in front of him on the table, “Relax. Everything is fine.”
He dropped the bag with the ghoul in it gently on the carpet and brushed the dust from his hands heatedly, taking a step toward Harry as he spoke, “Listen to me, Potter. I didn’t become a cursebreaker and then lie in wait for years and years, hoping for your notice so that I could weasel myself into your house and hex you or something. Since I am not an obsessive lunatic, I’m hardly going to risk my excellent job for the sake of some schoolboy grudge. It was over a decade ago. I’m not nursing any animosity-”
Harry opened his mouth, but Draco answered again, “I do know Harry. We were in the same year at Hogwarts, but Harry is one of the people I was not very nice to.”
“Malfoy’s the cursebreaker who turned up to decontaminate the house! And,” Harry lowered his voice to a whisper, “he’s a werewolf now!”
“There you are,” Harry said. “I’ll erm. Just leave you to it, shall I? I mean obviously I’m going to get you something to eat as well. Right. See you later.”
“I wasn’t suggesting you would! I’m just trying to be practical about. Any possible eventualities. I want you to be comfortable.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Do you think that’s really fair? Suppose Daisy asked me to write her a note to get out of the uniform and Rosie as well.”
“I do, don’t I? I expect it’ll look even better when I take my coat off in the restaurant and you can see the whole thing.”
“Well, that’s not really fair to Ginny, though,” Harry said gently. “I don’t mean to keep rehashing this. I know it feels like. This big. Thing. This wall between us, and I just don’t want it to be that way anymore, so I just. I want you to know I’m sorry. That isn’t what I want at all. I want us to be mates again.”
He slipped a quite dry pad out of the pocket of his pinafore as he approached. He spoke with a Scottish accent, but there was something cool and liquid in his voice as well, “Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to Shore. Is this your first time with us?”
Harry pointed his wand at the mess, “Evanesco.” The pasta vanished, leaving behind a greasy stain on the duvet.
Harry leaned against the worktop while he waited for the kettle and watched Malfoy slather his scone in strawberry jam, “You might have written to me.”
Draco laughed, “I agree, your face is generally quite pleasant, but perhaps you had indigestion at the photo shoot.”
Harry and Draco watched the train out of sight. When it was gone, Harry took a long draught of hot chocolate. It did make him feel better, but he was also beginning to notice that the other parents lingering on the platform were whispering and nudging each other and pointing covertly at him.
“Please, Dad. I’ve never even seen their graves. I’ll wear my cloak, if that will help convince you,” Harry insisted, his pleading gaze drilling a hole right through Severus’ heart. He couldn’t tell him no after that. He’d be there to protect his son; things would be alright.
“I save all of my text books because I mark in them; make notes, highlight important information. It’s not really the book I want to keep, but the history of my academic progress,” Hermione explained, shrugging as Ron gave her an incredulous look and Draco snorted.
Severus let his fork fall to his plate with a clatter, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “Perhaps Harry should get used to hearing such things, as they are true. He already knew that before; his fit of angst is more to do with his age than real distress, I assure you,” he snapped, his breakfast plate sliding away from him as if afraid of his tone.
“So you can’t tell me or Sev and Remus because you think we’re going to use this information to what, become the next Dark Lord?” Draco asked in a scathing tone, his arms crossed tightly over his chest.
That comment sparked a fuse in Harry, reigniting his anger from before. “Oh yeah, speaking of worrying myself about things, you’re a bloody hypocrite, you know that? Why didn’t you teach me about memory links, eh? That’s the whole reason Draco even saw that, and it’s
“Now, instead of throwing you into the middle of the theory of Occlumency and watching you squirm, I will begin with showing you how Occlumency looks and feels like. It’s not something easily described, so the best way is to show you. Now these types of things will require a little bit of physical contact. Is that alright with you?” Severus asked as he moved around the couch, his wand twirling between his long fingers. He tried to discern Harry’s answer from his expression, but the boy’s face was blank as ever.
“You have every right to feel unsafe, Harry; there is no reason for you to apologize to me. Hopefully the good news I have for you today will help to ease your worry,” Dumbledore said as he conjured a tea service and poured tea for two. He offered a cup to Harry along with a tray of delicious looking chocolate biscuits.
Voldemort when it happened. My panic, combined with the strange occurrence of being inside Voldemort’s mind when he possessed the snake, made him realize that I was there. Dumbledore doesn’t believe that he realizes just how long I had access to his mind, that the instance with Nagini was the first time, but now that he does know that the connection is there, he’d most definitely use it to his advantage.”
The tallest figure gave a sharp gesture, cutting off any further remarks from the other two. “This is no time for a lover’s spat. Harry and Severus will be here in a matter of minutes to send the signal, and we need to be ready. Weasley, place all of the items in the cauldron, please. I’ll deal with the scythe,” Lucius snapped in a menacing whisper.
Ron stood up and opened his trunk, shoving all of his possessions back into it with such force that his things were making loud bangs against the wood. He slammed the lid shut once more and lifted the handle, glaring at Harry and Draco as he stood up straight.
Harry nodded his agreement, glad when Ron did the same. There was one of those long pauses again, but this time they were all caught up in their own thoughts. They looked up at each other all at once, as if they had all come to the same conclusion simultaneously. Harry was the only one with the courage to say what they were all thinking.
Draco stomped his foot in frustration and glared. “You’re going to get yourself killed, Harry! What has Severus been telling you about self-sacrifice and being the hero? The Order and half the Ministry are out there, not to mention the DA. They can handle it!”
“This one here states that Mr. Riddle was accused of killing another child’s pet rabbit. What evidence did you have for such an accusation?”
A few times Draco would just sit with a blank stare, not saying a word even when Harry tried to speak to him. Healer Smithson explained that he was going into a sort of trance as little snippets of his memory started to come back. It gave Harry hope, but he tried not to get too excited about it; it would be a long time before Draco’s full memory came back.
“But what of the students? We’re damned if we do, damn if we don’t. We cannot let the castle continue to put these children in danger, but we also cannot just send them off,” Professor Sprout said from her seat beside Severus.
Remus sat up and blinked the sleep from his eyes, seeing Harry’s face poking through the cracked door. “Harry? Are you alright?”
Harry laughed and nodded, still smiling down at the watch. “It’s a…er – ‘Time for Intelligence watch’. It’s supposed to tell you what you need most. Fred and George Weasley invented them for their joke shop, Molly says. Brilliant bit a magic,” Harry explained as the watch whirled around again and displayed two words now; bathe and alone. “Well I would hope so,” Harry chuckled as he took the watch off so he could take a shower. He smiled at Snape, who looked bored and indifferent all at the same time. “Save some cake for me, eh?”
Harry gulped as he heard the hurt in Draco’s voice. He had not meant to push Draco away, but he couldn’t even stand to be in his own skin, let alone punish Draco with his presence. He finally looked up at the blonde as Draco squeezed his hand encouragingly. The Slytherin’s eyes were an icy blue-grey, swimming with concern and love. Harry felt his stomach squirm. How could Draco want to be anywhere near him?
Severus stared at the teen, yet again amazed at his ability to care so much. Harry had even warned him not to go to the Dark Lord, but he didn’t listen. Now the life debt had been passed to Remus, who Severus just realized was absent. “Where is Lupin? I passed out soon after taking the portkey; I don’t remember anything else.”
Did you really expect anything other than a cliffhanger from me?? I will try my damndest to get the rest written and posted as soon as possible. Thank you to everyone who is still reading, and PLEASE review/comment and let me know you’re still around and interested, and what you think of this chapter! Thanks my lovelies!
Dumbledore knew this was his last chance to lead the creature down the wrong path, to secure Harry’s chance of finding and destroying all of the Horcruxes. Quickly searching his weakening and pain-filled mind, the Headmaster found the answer at last.
Harry felt his stomach churn at the worried tone of his father’s voice. Upon realizing that the last Horcrux was sure to be found tonight, Harry knew that he would have to put the plan he had come up with into effect. The panic that tried to consume him was lingering under the surface of his carefully constructed façade. He could not give himself away and alert anyone to his inner turmoil if his plan were to work. It was just that he had thought he’d have a little more time; time to kiss Draco, laugh with Ron and Hermione, play chess with Severus, learn French from Remus, and of course, meet his baby sister. The pang of deep sadness he felt at the thought of never knowing the little girl Remus and Severus would raise nearly gave the game away, but he held himself in check.
Severus shook his head as he stood and bent down to collect the parchments he had displaced earlier. His trip up the stairs to Dumbledore’s office and back down was what took so much out of him, but after his short rest, he felt good enough to straighten up his office and get to bed on his own just fine. He felt disconcertingly touched that Harry was willing to help him so much, and he tried to squash down that warm feeling as much as he could, fearing he was going much too soft after caring for the boy. “I’m fine, Harry. Get to bed; you must be as exhausted as I am.”
Harry noticed Snape was having a bit of difficulty getting out of bed, and couldn’t stop himself from moving forward and swinging the Potions Master’s arm over his shoulder and carefully helping him stand. He couldn’t stand seeing the man struggle like that on his own and do nothing to help him. This man had carried him from a burning building – well, at least one that had exploded – the least Harry could do was help him to the loo.
“Well, talk,” Draco said shortly, staring at Harry so intensely that the Gryffindor had a hard time meeting his icy glare. He was reminded far too much of the old Draco, and his skin prickled uncomfortably.
“He’s fine, just a bit spooked. He mentioned Blaise Zabini specifically. I know they both have Arithmancy and Ancient Runes with you, so I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye on Draco and making sure Zabini keeps to himself. I don’t want him left alone anywhere,” Harry said in a quiet voice, so as not to attract the attention of the people around them.
“The boy has absolutely no respect for anyone, including himself! He has done quite enough to Harry this past year; he does not need more stress on top of it all. Harry was actually ashamed, Remus, ashamed of who he is because of that damned boy’s actions!” Severus hissed, pacing back and forth in his and Remus’ bedroom. He had made sure Harry was alright after the initial fight, but his anger for the Weasley boy had not subsided at all.
Harry sent the bushy-haired girl a half-hearted glare. It was a good idea in theory, but considering it involved Harry confronting a Dementor, he wasn’t a huge fan of it. “Do you happen to have a Dementor stored somewhere amongst all of your books?”
“I don’t think they’ll make the mistake of choosing somebody so dim-witted this time, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure her dark-haired friend before turning back to her Potions text to study for that morning’s quiz.
Harry and Ron both fixed the Professor with matching glares again, making it hard for Severus to keep his laughter in. Draco continued to stare at the floor, looking despondent and wishing he hadn’t started classes again after all.
The green light of the Killing curse quickly fizzled out as it hit some sort of shield. Voldemort gave a growl of frustration and continued the send spell after spell, all hitting the same barrier. “What is this? Fight me, Potter! Die like a man!”
too much of his father at the tender, stupid age of fifteen. “Do not say his name, Potter. While you are training with me, you will take care to
“I cannot sleep while my son is being tortured in his sleep by something clearly Dark in nature. I need to see the dream, I need to know what he’s seeing, what makes it different,” The Potions Professor went on, as if he was checking things off of a list in his head.
“How would you know, you haven’t seen me since a week before my torture,” Severus snapped, glaring slightly at the revolting pink hair atop the otherwise attractive woman’s head.
– or else he might throttle his own child. The nerve of the boy was beyond irritating and it had pushed his patience too far already. His eyes snapped open after a few seconds and pinned Harry with the strongest glare he possessed. Harry cowed slightly and looked away, looking properly ashamed.
“Yes, well, being a father isn’t really ‘my thing’ either, but things have a funny way of forcing themselves into your life. The boy is my godson; I never intended to become his sole guardian. I remember a girl who started last year, Slytherin who looks like a misplaced Weasley, much like you did. I can’t remember her name; might she be a relative?” Severus asked, knowing full well that Carly Smithson was almost certainly Abigail’s daughter.
my home, because I can’t possibly consider Gryffindor my home anymore; not with you there acting like a complete git about everything! Just leave me the fuck alone already, both of you! It’s not my fault Ginny’s a cry baby.” Harry’s voice had risen without him being aware, making Madam Pince walked briskly over, full ready to lecture about being quiet in the library. Before Harry could cut Pince off, he was being sent flying back into the bookshelf behind him by an almighty punch in the jaw from Ron.
“The orphanage was turned into a hotel? Seems a little morbid to me. When was it renovated? I’m sure they must have gutted the place to refurbish everything. What are the chances any sort of Horcrux survived that? I mean, they could have tossed it for all we know,” Harry groused, imagining having to crawl through mountainous piles of rubbish looking for an unknown object. The needle in a haystack affect was really starting to close in.
Remus thought about that for a while, getting lost in his own thoughts. He was pulled out of his reverie by noticing how Severus winced when he shifted. “Harry isn’t giving you a hard time about having to assist you, is he? He’s never been a selfish child, but with the history between you two…”
Remus could tell nothing was going to be found out if Severus and Tonks continued to communicate, so he took the burden on himself. “Dora, has Dumbledore spoken with the boy yet?”
“I know that you’re all part of the Order, but it is not safe for any of you to go gallivanting across London. Remus and I are perfectly capable of handling this. In the meantime, you guys can buckle down on finding a way to destroy these things. If we do find a Horcrux at this hotel, it will be the final one.”
“I think we should put them in the cauldron first, and then add the potion. That will decrease risk of splash-back and losing time in case of discovery,” a posh male voice said as he pulled out two decently sized flasks and set them beside the cauldron.
Hermione frowned, shifting her much heavier school bag on her shoulders. “Did you just call Professor Snape by his first name?” Hermione asked, ignoring Harry’s request entirely.
Though it was still a week before Christmas break was to start, Ron and Ginny received special permission to go home early to be with their father and the rest of their grieving family. The Headmaster had even offered to let Harry and Hermione join them, but both of them declined, as they thought it should just be family.
“Draco, I don’t really think his anger was an overreaction. You didn’t see Ginny after everything happened. It was horrible – ”
Severus sighed contently as he pulled Remus close for a kiss, cupping the werewolf’s cheek as he lingered against his lips. Severus heard a sniffle and broke away from the kiss, looking up towards Harry and Draco, who were beaming at the two men in a very watery way.
“Everything? Even from before the accident?” Severus asked, preparing to call for Healer Smithson. If Draco had indeed regained his memory, she would no longer be needed other than to do annual check-ups.
“I’ve never seen anyone master Occlumency so quickly and so proficiently. You will surely make an excellent Occlumens after a bit more studying. You would probably be a natural at Legilimency as well, should you attempt it,” Severus said before taking a bite of the chicken alfredo Harry had prepared during his lesson.
“I want to ask you not because you’re a last resort, but because I know you’ll do everything in your power to protect me and take care of me, and not just because you’ve taken a vow to do so. I’m asking you to adopt me because I think you need me as much as I need you, and it’s nice to feel needed.” Harry practically held his breath, wanting to turn away and squeeze his eyes closed as he waited for Snape’s answer. Surely it would be easier to take if he didn’t have to look the man in the eye when he said –
Severus picked one of the bags up off the floor and held it out to Draco. It was full of new clothes and a nice pair of boots. Draco had been wearing some of Harry’s clothes, resized to fit his taller frame and leaner body. “It’s not very much, but I figured you could use some clothes of your own before school started up again.”
“My presence here is no business of yours, Tom. If a fight is what you want, perhaps it will be what you get.”
“You told me once that. No, I’m getting ahead of myself. Damn! I had it all planned out and you jostled it out of me.”
Ginny snorted, “It’s almost like you don’t even remember what the two of you were like together at school. But you managed to be around each other again because you both wanted to look after Teddy, didn’t you?”
“I should go and practise piano,” Theo said suddenly. He got up from his chair, “See you later, Draco.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured when they left the museum hand in hand. “I didn’t know he’d be here, or I’d have warned you. I know that must have been. Complicated.”
Harry snorted, “Thanks, I’m still working on it. Are you hungry? I could fix you a sandwich,” it occurred to Harry that he should not have taken his godson out for ice cream before feeding him something more nutritious for supper.
Draco tossed his hair, sweeping a jasmine-scented breeze over Harry’s face, “We’re having dinner, Potter. Haven’t you ever been on a date before?”
Harry baked scones, and Draco gobbled up half the batch in about five minutes, then looked longingly at the pantry again. After a little trial and error, Harry offered him the last of the steak off the cold shelf, and Draco et it raw and with great relish.
Harry found the nightshirt and handed it to Draco politely instead of tossing it. Draco had finished his pain potion and was looking much less drawn. He went back to the Strengthening Solution, and he was petting Shadowfax as if she really were as important a part of the proceedings as she appeared to think.
“Animosity?! Why would you be nursing animosity? I only saved your life in that fucking fire! I only saved your skin from Voldemort!”
Draco smiled, “Thank you. I’m trying to be nice now. Helping people with their monsters and curses is part of that, actually, so I’m very pleased that you’re pleased.”
Harry was in the kitchen checking on his steak and kidney pie when he heard the hum of the Floo in the sitting room.
Malfoy smiled, a warm genuine smile that Harry had never seen before. It changed his whole aspect, “Hello there.”
Draco swung his hair in a fragrant wave over his shoulder, “I hope you’re not telling me it’s over.”
Harry tried for a moment to remember how it felt to be in love with Ginny, “I don’t know if that translates to being able to write about it. Anyway, the person who sent the patronus is a woman, and she kind of needs to stay a woman to make some other things in the plot work properly.”
Harry was saved from having to think of an answer to that remark by Molly Weasley putting her head through the fire, “Everything all right? You’re still coming through?”
“So this is where the magic happens,” Draco zeroed in on Harry’s desk nearly the identical moment they walked into the library.
“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about! We’re nearly thirty! Isn’t that too old to be embarrassed about things that happened when we were twelve?!”
“And now when I get scared, my poor old brain is too clever for its own good and thinks something really bad is going to happen. So it puts me through my paces in my dreams to make sure I’m ready to cope with whatever the bad thing is that’s going to happen. My healer calls it a trigger. It’s like a little thing or a not very bad thing that makes your brain afraid of the really bad thing so you get nightmares or you feel panicky.”
Malfoy tucked away his quill and notebook, “We probably shouldn’t linger here unnecessarily. I’d nip it out for you now, but I wasn’t expecting to do a removal straight away, and I don’t have my proper PPE, so that’ll have to wait, I’m afraid.”
Draco screwed up his face as if in painful consideration, “I think I’d best not. I won’t be able to get it out of my head til it’s published.”
He lived in muggle London in a four room flat that Ginny had politely called ‘surprisingly spacious.’ But it was enough to suit Harry’s needs. After the end of the war, Kreacher had gone first to Hogwarts, then on to a free elf group in France, so there wasn’t anyone to live in the house with Harry after Ginny moved out and Ron and Hermione got married and started their family.
Harry resisted the urge to remark aloud that Theodore was an old soul. It was the sort of grownup rubbish he’d started to find irritating around that age, “I think Granny would be sorry to hear you say that, Theodore. It’s all right for you to decide about your own name, even if it would make Granny a bit unhappy for a little while.”
“The apprenticeship is going well,” Luna said dreamily. “I’m meant to take a class of third years for Care of Magical Creatures this year.”
“Let’s see,” Harry said aloud as he checked behind the piano, “If I were a wolf, where would I hide? Mm, actually. I don’t expect you think much like a wolf does, do you? Because you told me you’re still in your right mind. So.” Harry paused a moment to think, and heard the soft scrabbling of wolfy toenails on the floor overhead. He made for the stairs at once, an inkling of an idea beginning to form in his head.
“Sorry to keep you waiting,” Harry called when he entered the room, trying not to sound stiff and grouchy as he whisked down the Floo wards with his wand. “I’ve been working and I lost track of the time.” The fireplace was already clouded with emerald green smoke, obscuring the figure standing in it. Harry made a mental note to arrange for the chimney to be cleaned.
They had such a jolly Christmas that it went by very quickly. Andromeda and Draco and Dudley and Daisy all came to Christmas lunch at the Burrow. Theodore and Victoire were reunited with such exuberant clamour that they seemed to account for several children instead of only two. Ginny and Draco took to each other instantly, and Luna shocked Harry by remarking that it was because they were exactly alike. Daisy demanded that Draco read her the copy of
“You’re squeezing my hand,” Malfoy held up their joined hands. “And your shoulders are all hunched up. Just roll them back and. Unclench. Relax. Take a deep breath. Are you worried about what’s behind the door?”
“Ah excellent,” said Draco in a stage whisper when Theodore met them where indicated a few minutes later. He walked a little ways down the corridor til he came to a portrait with dark, heavy curtains hung over it, Harry and Theodore just behind him.
“That’s why he looks so familiar, isn’t it? He’s my cousin, Draco? I know him from Granny’s photos. If you let me borrow Godric, I could write to him. You would, wouldn’t you?”
Harry couldn’t help laughing, “You look like you want something. Are you hungry? Would you like me to let you into the garden?”
Malfoy smirked, and even that was not quite the expression Harry remembered from Hogwarts, “Does she now? Fancy that.”
Harry tended to plan rather more domestic dates. Lots of home cooked meals and ambles in the park. Draco made a habit of accepting all of Harry’s invitations to spend the full moon at Grimmauld Place, and they would watch films together while Draco rested up after his transformation.
“Hmm,” said Harry, understanding Theodore’s conundrum. Excepting the snake--which had to be discounted as it refused to leave--all the creatures were very charming. “Well, which of them do you think you’d most like to talk to? It isn’t only about having a cuddle. Or hang on, maybe you’d rather have a post owl?”
“I miss having fun with you, Harry,” Ginny said presently. “I feel like I only make you sad now, and I hate that.”
Ron nodded, “Right, Theodore. Does that have anything to do with why your face is like that? It’s a nice name and it isn’t yours anyway, so I hope not.”
“You were saying, Hazzer?” Dudley prompted. Hermione was looking a little miffed, but she didn’t draw back her chair and rather leaned in closer when Harry lowered his voice to briefly tell Dudley what exactly had been in Theo’s cupboard and what it had turned into.
Harry stifled giggles behind his hand, then jumped when the latch on the bedroom door clicked and popped open. Harry tried to press himself back behind the hanging robes. Through the miniscule slit between the door and the wardrobe, Harry could see Draco move methodically about the room to check the bed first, then he pranced up to the wardrobe and pulled the door open with his teeth.
There was a spicy, earthy smell in the air, and Hagrid’s pumpkin patch was full of nearly ripe pumpkins. Just as Harry turned up the path, it began to rain, and he pulled his robes up over his head and ran the last few yards. Just beyond Hagrid’s cabin was a slightly smaller one with a patch of dirigible plums thriving in the front garden. Harry splashed up to the door and chapped it.
Dudley frowned, “I’m a bit confused. This bloke sent you a valentine and then turned up at your house?”
Theo made to follow him, but Harry held him back, “Let’s not be underfoot, Theo.” Theodore obeyed, but he was exuding nervous eagerness and kept glancing at Harry as if they were both expecting some wonderful treat.
“Yes, we’re practically neighbours,” Draco followed Harry down the stairs to the pavement. “It’s this way.”
“All right. I’ll count, and off you go and hide.” Harry shut his eyes and covered the lenses of his glasses with his hands, and began to count down from a hundred. He could hear the soft, quick click of Draco’s nails against the kitchen floor as he hurried off to hide.
Harry burst out laughing. Ginny laughed, too, and Luna slipped off her chair to hug and kiss them both, and then Hagrid swept them all into a crushing hug and Fang woke up and started barking. In the middle of the scrum, hugged and kissed and still laughing, Harry was beginning to think maybe he could at least try.
“What?” Theo looked blank. He’d been very focused on Twinkle since they got her and Harry had interrupted him cooing to the cat about teaching her how to fight boggarts.
Draco looked up from examining a cage of white rats, “A familiar offers often essential emotional support, Potter. It’s not a mere pet. It’s a friend and companion and once a bond is established, develops a unique sympathy with the wizard it is attached to. In some cases, it can be a mutually protective bond, where the familiar cares for and looks after the wizard nearly as much as the wizard looks after the familiar.”
“Not at all. At least not intentionally. Belle isn’t me beyond being a product of my imagination. I’m not secretly sneaking Harry Potter’s incendiary opinions into your home through my books.”
The server scribbled on his pad, “Absolutely. I’ll be right out with those drinks for you.” And he turned and went back into the water, a seal again.
Ginny had a little confusion line between her eyebrows, “It crossed my mind, yeah. Mostly I thought you were just jealous and sad and pissed off. Not necessarily a homophobe.”
“I do. It’s lovely.” Harry looked about, “Is there no one else here or is the island just too big to see them?”
Ron interrupted gently, “You didn’t let anything happen, Harry. It was just one of those things. You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re not the Dursleys--the old Dursleys I mean, not Dud. And you’re not Dumbledore. Go easy on yourself.”
“Walk through the wall,” Theo said in a tone as if he was trying not to sound doubtful. “Twinkle’s in front of me, though. Will she be able to get in before me, or should I walk in backward?”
Draco leaned back against the settee as well so that their faces were level, still smirking, “Ah but I’ve known all that for years, and now you’re giving me new information as well. I’d no idea you find me handsome.”
The first room door in the corridor was his library, and the door was shut. Harry opened it very gently, and with a hastily whispered lumos, glanced around the room under the beam of his wandlight. There wasn’t any sign of Draco, but Harry hadn’t expected there to be. Harry quickly checked each room on the way, til he reached Sirius’ room, where he’d installed Draco for the weekend.
Theodore was in his last year of primary school at the special school for magical children in Ottery St Catchpole, near the village where he lived with his grandmother. He usually walked to school, but since Number Twelve Grimmauld Place was a good deal farther away than Andromeda’s house, Harry had gotten a Portkey permit to let Theo come to school by Portkey every morning. Theodore had never used a Portkey before, so for his first morning, Harry decided to come along with him. They might have walked to school from The Burrow fairly easily, but Harry thought Theodore should be established in his new routine sooner rather than later.
“Yeah? Do tell,” Harry was already smiling the special adoring smile that he got sometimes when he looked at Theodore so that Draco had to look away for a moment because it was too pretty to bear.
Harry showed Draco to the kitchen, Shadowfax trotting along ahead of them, as if she knew exactly where they were going, and indeed she got there before them. Harry got down an old flagon, and then began to dish up the dinner while Draco gulped down his smoking potion. Shadowfax prowled about til she found Twinkle’s cushion, and after very assiduous sniffing, went to sleep on it.
Harry leaned toward Draco across the table so that their knees pressed together under it, “Vapourised?”
“Nice to meet you, Theodore,” Kal rose briefly from his seat behind the welcome desk and leaned over it to give Theo a high five. “I like your hair.”
