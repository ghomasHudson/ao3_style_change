She watches Harry, reckless as ever, inch closer to Draco, who shies away, feathers puffing out in warning. Harry hesitates, and licks his lips, before tentatively reaching towards him with his hand. Hermione holds tight to her wand, ready for Draco to lash out again, but the violence she expects doesn’t come. Instead, Harry brushes the back of Draco’s inky black, taloned hand with his fingertips and Draco shudders, his eyes falling closed. Harry smiles, encouraged, and shuffles closer. He runs his hands up and down Draco’s lanky arms to warm him, and Draco melts into the touch, a small sound of pleasure escaping him. Suddenly, the vibrations in the room stop.
His pulse is racing but for all the wrong reasons. Harry gulps down air, willing everything inside him to settle, needing to distract himself from the inevitable spiral of his own dark thoughts. He looks around him, feeling slightly unhinged then spots the liquor bottles stashed to the side on the cooktop.
Harry shrugs, feeling wrong-footed all of a sudden. He transfigures his fresh glass to water and he takes a large gulp before scanning the crowd for a pink head of hair. Beside him, Cecilia puts two fingers in her mouth and whistles, loud and clear. Cameron’s elaborate, bird-fluttering hairdo comes into view at the call and he jumps and waves, spotting them in the crowd. Together, they sneak off to a secluded spot near the Campanile to watch the
Silver eyes, so worn and weary, turn fierce as Draco nods and Luna’s heart sinks down through the rocks at their feet.
“He didn’t mean it,” she whispers to him, the words echoing in the cavernous space. “He wasn’t himself.”
Scorpius slumps in his chair, his impeccable posture eradicated in an instant. He looks a wreck of confusion and sorrow and Draco aches to remove such an expression from his son’s face.
This time, Draco laughs, or at least Harry thinks he does. A harsh bark of a cry erupts from behind his mask as Draco throws back his head. He steps away from the lamppost and moves towards Harry in one fluid motion, crowding him, his wings curling in around his back, cocooning them and blocking out the hazy lamplight. Harry stands firm, not willing to back down from whatever this is, and looks up at Draco, chin held high.
Draco sighs. “Oh, let me guess, my dearly beloved son forgot to mention some other key aspect to this trip?”
He wanders the streets of Cannaregio, ending up on the edges of the city staring at the facade of a 15th-century church. There’s a huddle of tourists gathered nearby, their guide proclaiming that this is
Harry stares, the line of Draco’s back long and lean before him, the round, firm curve of his arse exposed and perfect, nestled between Harry’s thighs. “You’re beautiful,” he tells Draco, and Draco nods, the bastard, before arching his back, the sharp cut of his shoulder blades spiking as he holds himself up on the handlebars to look back at Harry with a wicked grin. As if to drive the point home, he licks his lips and blows Harry a kiss.
“Fuck my mouth,” Draco tells him, seeing the desperate need so blatant in Harry’s eyes. Harry nods, pressing his cock down into Draco’s mouth and then moving his hand to hold Draco’s head in place as he rocks his hips. Draco closes his eyes, luxuriating at the feeling of being used, being wanted, needed. He takes what Harry gives him and sucks down hard on his prick as it slides wet and filthy in and out of his swollen lips.
“Yes! Exactly! You can’t imagine the pain.” He pulls Luna close, petting her hair. “He was a threat to himself and to his mother.”
“Espresso?” Cecilia says out of nowhere, causing Draco to fling the pillow aside in shock at her presence in his bedroom.
Ignoring the prickle of threatening tears, Luna pulls Draco in, tucking his head beneath her chin. Draco wraps his arms tightly around her, and Luna smiles at the strength of the embrace.
They enter the ruins of the temple as the sun sets in a blaze of tangerine light over the forum. Xenophilius levitates rocks and column pieces into forced, organised piles as he practically ploughs through the debris.
I totally forgot about posting yesterday and I am so sorry, y'all. I hope this update satisfies. More to come in five days! Sooooo, that'll be . . . Friday! See you then!
“So what if I have?” Harry taunts, licking a stripe up the man’s pale neck, tasting salt and savouring its flavour on his tongue.
Nodding into Xenophilius’ shoulder, she hears herself agreeing to his plan. They will bring Draco here and set him up in the beautiful temple on the river with Mipsy for his constant care.
It was several hours before a haggard old guard with a wizened face and a walrus mustache materialised inside the room with them, tapping his foot in jovial impatience. Harry lifted his head off this arm, his eyesight blurred considering his glasses lay strewn somewhere across the floor, along with various pieces of their clothing. Beside him, Draco grumbled into a conjured pillow, his hair a wild silver mess against the sheets, mumbling about the necessities of beauty sleep. Harry smirked at him before squinting up at the man with as much dignity as one could muster whilst naked and draped atop a series of duvets piled on a marble floor of a public building.
Laughing, Harry leans in and reaches around Draco to line up his flushed cock with the warm leather of the bike’s seat. With a nip to his ear and a whispered kiss at his nape, Harry guides Draco to lay flat against the bike, trapping his cock between the engine’s vibrations and his own body. Harry hopes the sensation will drive Draco as mad as Draco’s looks are driving Harry. At the gasped hiss of Draco’s reaction, Harry grins knowingly, pressing harder with his palm against the small of Draco’s back. “Feel good?”
Hoping to stop vertigo from bearing down on him, he removes his glasses and covers his face, hiding it behind the bend of his elbow. Shrouded in darkness, he feels bold enough to say, “Draco, I’m sorry. It was wrong of me to—”
“What’s—what can I do?” Malfoy shouted. It was apparently the second time he’d asked. Harry hadn’t heard the first.
Eyes flashing with heat, all semblance of humour gone, Harry shifts further up Draco’s body, placing his knees on either side of Draco’s head on the pillows, one arm moving to brace against the wall, the other cupping the back of Draco’s neck.
Harry straightens and steps into Draco’s space, breathing in the smoke he exhales through his lungs and holding his head tightly in his hands. “
“Open up,” Harry instructs, moving over him, wishing he could simply vanish Max’s clothes. He places his knees carefully on either side of Max’s ribs, allowing him to shift and make room, before settling his ass on his chest. Gently, Harry gathers up a pile of Max’s brown curls in his fist and tips his head forward, aligning the bottle with his lips. “I want you to taste lemons as you suck me.”
Harry’s sprawl on the red-lipped couch has dipped decidedly towards horizontal when Cameron interjects, “You still down for a photoshoot, Harry?” He’s holding his camera and quick as a flash, snaps a picture of Harry in his food-laden repose.
Draco has absconded to his room with the pastries by the time Harry’s entered their flat, much to Cecilia’s and Cameron’s varied (and loud) objections. Harry, hands clasped behind his back, trails along after them, poking his head around Draco’s bedroom door, enjoying the cacophonous sounds of all three of them shouting in Italian, though he suspects that Cameron is speaking French, due to his continual dropped constants at the end of each word.
?” A bored-looking teenage wizard asks him as he steps up to the booth. Harry grins at the sweet irony of how the Italian verb used simply in place of the question ‘
as they observe from on high. Harry swallows, his heart kicking in his chest as the vision swims into view; one man braced on the railing, the other behind him, hands tight on his hips, thrusting forward.
He pats his chest, smiling sadly at the ache he always feels whenever he thinks about Sirius. He stands and announces, “I’m going in,” planning to wash away his sorrows in the turquoise water.
” She bows with a flourish and Harry huffs out a laugh. His nerves, having abandoned him during Cecilia’s interlude, now come back full force as he steps over the threshold into her lovely bedroom and sees the secret door to Draco’s room along the far wall. Harry swallows, throat tight.
In truth, it had been infinitely more painful than any Cruciatus curse ever thrown at him, but Draco had been lucky. He’d found Gabrielle. He’d found solace in a woman he had no right to love but did and the mire of his mind now felt so muddled in memories he could barely stand.
Harry springs forward, grabbing Draco round the middle, and drags him away from the crumbling wall, Draco screeching his discontent as they go. Draco stumbles as they run, but he runs nevertheless, and Harry holds onto that reassuring fact while they flee. Massive booms like cannon fire sound behind them as the columns fall this way and that. Harry casts Protego after Protego and hears Hermione and Luna do the same, dodging stray bits of stone with each running step.
Another cry interrupts their question. Immediately, their wands are in their hands, their backs to each other.
Hermione hasn’t stopped peppering kisses all along Luna’s head. They’re soaking in the tub, Hermione at Luna’s back, her arms wrapped tightly about her. She keeps checking the spot where a lump has formed at the back of Luna’s skull, casting soothing little anti-inflammatory charms at it every ten seconds.
“This is ridiculous, your father is absolutely furious,” Astoria grabbed Malfoy from Harry’s grasp. Malfoy stumbled into her, groaning, and nuzzled his head into her shoulder sleepily.
Grabbing his wand, the three wizards quickly scurried out of the room. After all these years, people were still afraid of Harry Potter. Besides, he defeated the Dark Lord.
Malfoy turned and looked at Harry. “Do you know what my father has asked me to do? Obliviate a Squib. He wants proof that I can take over the ministry once he retires, he wants me to prove myself to him as his son. I don’t want to do it, Harry. I’m scared.”
“I appreciate it, Potter,” confessed Malfoy, “you, checking up on me. It’s rare for people to ask how I am nowadays.”
Though feeling uneasy, Harry couldn’t help but have a spark of excitement running through him. He watched Draco every so often, seeing a twinkle in his eyes, the colour returning to his face. Draco had started speaking quicker and more eccentric as he usually did, just like the days in Hogwarts when he got excited about his grades or showed off his new broom.
“Do you ever wonder,” said Harry weakly as Malfoy started to mop up some of the blood on his face, “if things would’ve turned out differently… If I had accepted your hand?”
Harry instantly felt comfort from this motion. It sent shivers up his spine and had the hair on his arms standing on end. Malfoy’s thumb was soft against the raised, scarred skin.
The thoughts of his past shrouded his mind as he headed towards Borgin and Burkes. It seemed he couldn’t escape them anymore. A while back he was able to push them down, ignore them as much as possible. Every thought that entered his mind he could bat away by doing extra work, talking to Astoria, going for trips with her. But now it seemed as though nothing could get rid of them. Partially he blamed Potter, having him back in his life made everything harder. Every time Draco saw Potter’s face, he felt his scars ache. But, another part of him always wanted to be with Potter. There was a comfort to his voice, the same messy hair that he had all throughout Hogwarts, the same stubbornness and back-chatting. Potter made Draco feel like a kid again, in all the best ways possible.
“You fucking coward!” Harry had cried as Draco turned from the argument and stalked out of the room, red-faced but with his head held high. He did not give into Harry’s taunts to return and continue, he did not even stay the night as they’d planned earlier in the evening, with laughter and alcohol still tingling on their lips. Draco had Disapparated from Harry’s stairwell not two seconds after Harry’s final jab, the crack resounding through the house like a leather whip hitting its target.
“Father,” Luna says, standing at the end of the hall with Hermione’s medical bag in hand. She appears cautious, her face filled with a worry Hermione rarely sees in Luna. It makes Hermione’s heart break. The tension in the room has reached its zenith, causing her own throat to tighten with the strain of quivering magic hovering in the air. Draco and Harry are standing at an arm's length from each other on the balcony, their combined powers of creature and wizard colliding and creating a strange limbo of indecision. Hermione can practically see it simmering across the evening breeze.
He remembers Draco’s tongue running flat along his skin and drags a finger across his neck, hoping to recreate the feeling. His magic sparks white hot against his throat and he moans, wishing it were Draco ripping these sounds from him. He pounds the bed with his fist, his frustration overriding his lust.
Draco doesn’t let Harry go when they’re on solid ground. Instead, his arms tighten their hold, and his cheek presses gently against Harry’s hair. Harry assumes this is some sort of bird-like instinct and doesn’t move to stop him, though he feels rather awkward the longer they stand there.
Potter’s directly behind him, having snuck up on him while he was distracted by Cameron’s yammering. Draco can feel Potter’s warm breath on the back of his neck. He shivers and steps away. Potter follows.
Harry doesn’t respond. Instead, he steps across the threshold, feeling the ancient magic wash over him in a welcome embrace. The air is dank and the room is dark and there’s a thick coat of dust upon every surface and yet Harry can’t help but smile. Unlike Grimmauld Place with its endless, meandering halls, and generations of pureblood history woven into the very fabric of its foundation, this place is . . . settled. Calm. Wholly accepting of Harry and his presence within its walls.
Scorpius doesn’t even blink at the sight of his father’s anger. He’s more Veela than Draco and Gabrielle ever were and he wears that knowledge like a suit of the finest elf-made armour, fiercely and with a confidence that Draco has never been able to possess.
Draco moves, making the decision for them both by releasing his wrist and draping his leg over Harry’s hips, straddling him without warning. His arms are braced on the stone behind Harry’s neck, his head bowed so that his hair falls in a wet curtain over his shoulder, blocking out the light from the cottage just beyond. Harry, exhausted from holding himself together under Draco’s gaze, slumps in the water, giving in to Draco’s preternatural strength, willing the inevitable.
to Harry. No longer a childhood rival, or enemy, or even evil, but just, someone other than he normally would associate with—no one of consequence.
Pulling back with a crooked smile, Draco says, “You know, thinking that the torch I’ve been carrying for you since I was a snot-nosed brat is sexy is rather twisted, Potter.”
Harry fucks Draco with his tongue with the same intensity that he kissed his hungry mouth. He’s voracious and unyielding as he works Draco open, spearing him over and over as Draco rocks back against him, wanting him deeper, harder, needing ever more as his body climbs closer towards orgasm.
Narcissa’s breaths come quickly, sounding harsh in the quiet room when suddenly, she gasps on a sob. “I can hear you,” she whispers. She looks over her shoulder at him in astonishment.
. Harry doesn’t hesitate, he maintains eye contact, and watches as Draco slowly opens his mouth to take another bite, lips full and tongue red.
Holding her breath, she releases the final tie, allowing both sleeves to split at the seams. The fabric pools at her elbows, exposing the jagged lines of the raised skin along her forearms, put there by the taloned hands of her beloved son. She does not blame him, she knows these scars were not Draco’s doing, but the creature that poisons his mind and his blood.
This request is met with a curious glance as the wizard pursues Harry’s travel papers and no doubt sees that he has just come from Venice by train. Harry shrugs at him, having no time to be self-conscious. There’s an urgency to this spontaneous decision that he knows he shouldn’t question, just instinctively follow.
The man’s speaking again, right in Harry’s ear with a hand fisted in his hair, just the way Harry likes to be handled. He whimpers, feeling unmoored as the man tells him a series of impossible things Harry is no less eager to hear. “Since we were children I've wanted you, your attention, your acceptance, your
Hermione’s sigh is so loud it cuts Draco off mid-rant. “You can’t Portkey onto the islands. Scorpius knows that. I’ve told him as much.”
Scorpius hesitates for a moment before moving to stand and walking towards his father. Draco reaches out as soon as he’s within arms reach and pulls him into a fierce hug, pressing his cheek to his son’s hair, allowing the familiar scent of his soap to fill his senses and soothe his rattled nerves.
Harry opens his mouth, attempting to speak once again when Cecilia, by some form of Legilimency, or simple eavesdropping, bursts back through the hidden door behind them, eyes alight with excitement, stopping Harry in his tracks. “Oh, Harry, yes! You must come with us!”
Bile rose in this throat at the thought. He’d been so weak, so shamefully, pathetically weak; so blindly willing to let Harry go in place of the promised stability of fulfilling his familial duty to the Malfoy name. The reason he’d been born. What he’d been raised to do. Falling into the role required only that he numb himself of the previous four years of happiness. Extinguish a bond so new it barely had time to take root inside him and yet had already weaved itself into the very fabric of his soul. Draco had survived living under the Dark Lord’s vindictive, penetrating gaze for a year, successfully cutting off all emotion from his mind in order to simply breathe in the same space as that vile creature. Cutting out a piece of his heart and self-cauterizing the wound couldn’t be worse.
Soon, his attention is pulled away from the flashes of light on the horizon and down to the unmistakable shape and breadth of Draco’s wings out on the jetty.
“I don’t presume much. Only this.” Potter’s thigh presses in between Draco’s legs, and Draco arches off the rock at the contact, throat straining over the urge to moan. Everything that’s happened in the past thirty seconds has left Draco so incredibly aroused he’s weak with it, slumping and allowing Potter to take his weight.
“How many can you handle?” She leans in and brushes away Hermione’s smile with her lips. She knows that this is what Hermione needs, and even more, it’s exactly what Luna craves. The chance to exude power over Hermione soothes Luna’s nerves to something shimmering and pearlescent in her mind. It leaves her irrevocably calm, and leaves Hermione’s non-stop brain suspended at a much-needed intermission between acts of brilliance, allowing her to rest.
. Everywhere he looks—hung from ceiling beams, set on side tables, window ledges, bookshelves—are plants of every variety, cascading and unfurling into verdant hues of lush life all around him. He baulks, momentarily stunned.
Malfoy tutted in disbelief, his pale hands distractedly pulling and smoothing over his dark waistcoat and pleated trousers. He didn’t look back up and Harry continued his march, murmuring small incantations at each painting he came across crowding the curved wall around them.
Mind racing, Draco can’t help but take a moment to breathe at what’s been offered to him: Harry Potter, hands folded behind his head, laid out before him on damask silk. There are too many options, too many possibilities of where to start and what to do. He wants it all. He leans down, lips feather-light and reverent over Canis Major, kissing the skin there as if he could taste the colours underneath his lips. He trails lower, just under the darker skin of Harry’s nipple to trace his tongue along the lines of Gemini’s stars.
“No, Draco. I don’t mean us. Gabrielle.” Draco’s eyes snap to Harry’s as he continues. “Her death wasn’t your fault.”
“We still felt his pain,” Luna tells her. Harry grunts in agreement, though still having no idea who they’re talking about and why he’s in pain.
, that feels too intimate for what he and Malfoy are to each other nowadays, but he also can’t find the power of speech to adequately correct her either.
Hermione huffs. “Luna, what on earth could you possib—” Hermione cuts herself off, her brain running ahead again towards a conclusion. Beside her, Luna smiles into her teacup.
Harry’s stood watch on this cliff at the start of every summer for twelve years now. He waits, wand at the ready and broom clutched tightly in his hand, as the new Thestral foals take their ritual leap of faith off the rock with their mothers leading the way. It’s both a terrifying tradition and an exhilarating phenomenon to witness and Harry knows his accepted presence during this ancient right of passage is a sign of true kinship between him and his unconventional herd. He is both stallion and protector to this motley crew of Thestral strays and their well-being has become his life’s work.
“Sit there,” he instructed before heading to the bar. Harry slowly went and sat down, undoing the clasp that held his cloak together, then rolled it up next to him. Malfoy came back over with a glass of cinnamon fire whiskey for himself, and Hannah Abbott came over with a tray. She placed down a tea and the house soup in front of Harry, before walking off.
“I don’t need to talk to anyone,” snapped Malfoy, looking up at Harry. “Everything is fine.” He quickly downed the rest of his whiskey. “I’ll leave you in peace. I’ll be at the bar,” he said, before getting up and walking over there, sitting himself down in front of Hannah. Harry watched him drink more whiskey, and he couldn’t help but feel bad.
“I wish we could overthrow Lucius,” Neville said in a very hushed voice. “I hate the fact that this is happening to you guys.”
Harry took in his surroundings. The air felt clean and fresh as he breathed in, letting the smell of wet ground fill his nostrils.
“Better than before. Got discharged a few weeks ago. Seeing a mind healer twice a week, but they’re going to put it down to once a week soon. They’re impressed with my progress.”
“I’m doing better,” replied George, setting up the chess board again. “There are good days and there are bad days. Mostly bad, but there are some good. Before it was just all bad.”
“We’re going to apparate to the Manor,” explained Harry, before keeping a tight grip on Malfoy and apparating.
Harry sighed in response. Deep down he knew Ron was right, things were worse now than their time in Hogwarts, but Harry had been so blinded by his blossoming friendship with Malfoy that he had forgotten all about what was happening to him only a few months before. Brutal beatings from Lucius Malfoy, being constantly threatened to be sent to the workhouses, having to work long and exhausting hours just stood by an office door causing his muscles to go stiff. And now they were tending to a room full of Slytherins, who remember a time when Harry Potter ruled Hogwarts. Yet here he was now, serving their drinks.
“Oh yes, he’s dreadful,” agreed Hermione. “Mrs Malfoy doesn’t seem too bad, either, though. I mean, I still like her for saving Harry’s life.”
After everything that happened with Lucius, Harry had been sent to work for Narcissa. Lucius, of course, wanted Narcissa to use Harry as her personal servant, ordering him to do everything for her so she didn’t have to lift a finger.
Without another thought, Harry rushed over to him. All the situations he prosed slipped from his mind as he wrapped his arms around the frail body, pulling him close. Malfoy didn’t oppose, instead he pressed his face into Harry’s shoulder and wept. They stayed in this position for longer than Harry thought they would, until eventually, Malfoy’s sobs became gentle hiccups, and he pulled himself away.
“I very much doubt that,” scoffed Malfoy, but Harry could tell he was nervous. Malfoy picked at the skin on his knuckles when he was nervous, which in his adult years was hardly ever, but Malfoy was doing exactly that right now.
“Tiring,” Harry finally responded, grabbing a knife, and started to chop up a carrot after washing his hands. “All I do all day is stand outside Draco’s office with Ron unless it’s a meal, then I’m just serving them water or wine.”
The reason the room felt so familiar when Draco had been looking for dark artefacts, why he had always seemed so tense when they went in there. It was the cellar Bellatrix had used to hold prisoners, where Harry and Ron had ended up for a short amount of time, just before Dobby was murdered.
“Alright, no need to become big headed, golden boy. I’ll make you work the rest of the day and the night if you’re not careful.”
The heaviness of Harry’s eyelids kept reminding him of the lack of sleep he’d had the previous night. He had been up all night, tossing and turning, thinking about the day’s events. Firstly, it worried him that there was now a very cursed crystal ball sitting in Borgin and Burke’s. If Harry could, he’d buy it just to make sure no one else did, but he knew that the owners liked to double – or sometimes triple – the amount that they paid for it. He hoped no one would be able to afford it.
Humming, Draco grins, wicked and wild, his eyes dark, knowing he’ll soon get his way. Harry’s already growing hard from the feel of Draco’s cool fingers alone.
“You’re radiant,” he tells her for the tenth time. She laughs, pressing a warm hand against his chest.
Luna steps in front of Hermione with a sly smile, pulling at the silk tie holding her robe in place. It slips open easily, revealing the bare skin beneath. Luna’s eyes are cast downward, staring at the soft triangle of light blue fabric covering the apex of Hermione’s thighs. Hermione’s breath hitches, her heart suddenly racing.
He smiles and twirls her into the centre of the floor once more, his heart heavy with love and regret mingled together in a painful, inseparable web of emotion within him—a snarled tangle he’ll never be able to worry apart. He doesn’t deserve this woman, their bond, their future life full of amber light and honeyed happiness, and yet here he is living a fantasy, holding Gabrielle in his arms with fairy lights glowing gold and purple and blue all around them.
“I’ve stabilised him,” she pants when she reaches them, pulling Harry in for a quick hug before grabbing hold of Luna’s arms and pulling her back up the stairs. “He’s sleeping—I think.”
Draco slams the door in his face. Only to open it again a moment later, grab Harry by the collar of his t-shirt, haul him into his room, and shove him up against the wall, teeth bared.
“That’s what I said!” Malfoy exclaims. He hits Harry’s arm with the back of his hand, which makes Harry laugh all the more.
The water licks at the crumbling walls around them, lulling Harry into a sense of calm he’s not sure he should be able to feel standing this close to Draco Malfoy, so many years later. He allows the soothing rhythm to hypnotise him as they collectively take long pulls from Malfoy’s cigarettes and watch the stars wink into existence in the velvet sky above, mirroring those magicked onto Harry’s skin.
There’s a moment where they watch each other, breath held, the air rippling with tension before Narcissa crumbles, her impeccable posture slipping. Her teacup clangs on its saucer as she places it hard on the table and drops her face in her hands.
Harry cries out, his dick pulsing into Draco’s mouth with the shock of his orgasm. Harry quickly tries to back off and allow Draco to breathe, but Draco holds him close, forces his cock down his throat and takes it all, not letting Harry leave him, not wanting to waste a single drop.
There’s a buzzing coming from Draco’s pocket and he curses against Harry’s throat, nipping the skin there, causing Harry to jump. He pulls back and fishes his Muggle mobile out of his jacket pocket, while his other hand falls to tangle in Harry’s hair.
She folds her arms and nods, staring him down despite conceding to his point. Harry drops his palms to the table and stares right back. After a few moments Hermione kicks his shin and Harry jumps, blinking.
Pushing a hand through his hair he stalks along the cliff’s edge, needing to think, needing to catch his breath. Below him, the sea crashes against the sheer stone of the cliff, foam and froth and fierce power pushing up against the ancient rock, now forever tainted by the painful sting of his past.
It was tiring work, and frivolous too, creating an oversized spring pool of mineral-rich hot water for Harry to soak his bones in every night, but as the years pass he finds himself more and more contented with having such a source of relaxation at his fingertips, mere steps out his back door.
Draco blinks, taken aback. “No, I do not.” A flash of memory rocks through him like a battering ram—the wind ripping through his hair, the heat of a solid body pressed against his own, laughter echoing through the sky and a sunset worthy of any great master painting melting out before them on the horizon as Harry soars them over the London rooftops, the bike’s engine an intoxicating vibration beneath their thighs. Draco’s mouth goes slack at the unwelcome image, something he’s fought long to keep buried in a past he doesn’t like to dwell on. He looks to Hermione, curious if her charm hadn’t worked as well on herself as it had on him. With brows furrowed, pain seeping into his heart, “Why would you ask me that?”
Everything was so neat and tidy, and the papers he was looking for sat on the desk. Part of him wanted to read them, but he knew that the Malfoys would find out somehow if he did so. Though, as his eyes peered onto the page as he grabbed it, he saw the words ‘Bankrupt’ on the top. Breath hitching in his throat, he turned the paper over so he couldn’t see the writing and headed back to Malfoy’s office.
Maybe, thought Harry, trying for a child is what would bring them together again, and even that isn’t working.
That night at dinner, Hermione had some gossip for them all. She sat down almost excitedly, smoothing her maids dress as she did.
“No!” he found himself screaming, scooping up the lifeless body of his wife. Her head lolled in his arms as he pulled her close, begging for her to still be alive.
Echoes of a pair of shoes on the marble floors surrounded the empty ministry. The man, who stood tall, with dark hair and dark skin, strode along gracefully. Under his arm was a thick black book, which he kept firmly in his grasp.
“No. I think Ron and Hermione suspected something was going on, but they don’t even know I ran away yet.”
Then, the figure of a wolf revealed itself. Slowly, it approached Harry, staring directly at him in the eyes.
Ron and Hermione had managed to get him a job working as a butler at Malfoy Manor, and he was honestly extremely grateful for that. It had seemed that Malfoy had argued the case that Harry should work for them, rather than go to the workhouses, because then they could keep a closer eye on him and torture him when they see fit.
“This week has just been awful,” she told him as they sat down to eat their food. “George has been doing worse. He’s seeing his mind healer every day now, but he’s been drinking every night. It’s since he told Ron he wasn’t doing well, it’s as if he’s accepted it and now that’s how he is. Ron’s sick with worry,” Hermione shook her head, wiping her eyes with her hands.
“Well, everyone seems to think you are laundering money, Malfoy,” one of the men said. He was tall with a stocky build, black hair slicked back smartly. They all wore suits, Harry noticed.
“Merlin,” coughed Draco, being sick one more time before switching on the tap. Without a moment’s delay, Harry’s hand was rubbing Draco’s back, soothing him as best as he possibly could. A small hand with a tissue entered Draco’s vision and he looked to his side, seeing the comforting face of Molly Weasley.
“You will do, Draco,” Harry spoke softly to him. Slowly Malfoy’s eyes opened again, and his silver eyes stared at Harry’s green ones.
Nodding, Harry followed George outside the burrow. Since Harry’s last visit, a garden bench had been placed outside the front door. It must be for George to watch the sunset on, thought Harry, as he noticed the sun was beginning to rise right in front of them. Both the men sat down in silence on the bench and watched the sun slowly enter the sky.
Draco couldn’t help but pace around the burrow. His heart pounded so hard in his chest he swore it was about to burst out.
“Draco,” hushed Harry, stroking his fingers against the back of Draco’s neck. “I understand what you’re going through. And I wish I could make the pain go away. But I can’t. It will eat you up, destroy you. Everything will seem so different now. Nothing will feel okay, not for a long time.”
Before Harry could scuttle away unseen, Malfoy and his eyes locked, and before he knew it, they were on their way over, Astoria waving kindly.
Malfoy clumsily grabbed his wand and drew out the constellation with it. The stars in the sky joined up together with lines.
“That constellation. It’s the constellation I’m named after,” explained Malfoy quietly. “Mother loves this constellation. It’s named after a dragon. Mother named me after it.”
“I don’t know just yet, Potter,” Malfoy looked around again, breathing deeply. “But I don’t think I can rest until I figure it out.”
“He just needed to grab something,” shrugged Harry, avoiding eye contact with Ron. “Wanted to make sure no one was going to follow him.”
“Sounds like you need a drink,” said Mr Weasley as he got up and hobbled over to his drink’s cabinet. He poured Harry a whiskey, handing it to him with a smile.
“Focus,” said Harry gently, picking up Malfoy’s wand and placing it back in his hand. “Think of a memory that every time you see the spot it was in, the person it was with, the outfit you were wearing, butterflies dance around your stomach. A time when the hair on your arms stood on end and your whole body felt warm. Think about the time you felt the safest, you felt genuine joy. It could be anything, Draco. Unwrapping a gift you desperately wanted on Christmas day, eating the most delicious meal with your family. It has to be a strong memory, something you can still feel inside you, something that still makes your heart race.”
Ron kept shuffling from one foot to the other next to Harry. He’d been doing it all morning but had kept silent about why. Every now and then, he’d look down at his small pocket watch and either sigh or groan before putting it away again.
“Don’t you ever apologise,” she beamed, looking up at him with pride in her eyes. “You’re very busy nowadays.”
Harry said his goodbyes to Hermione and Ron, who seemed utterly confused, especially when Malfoy gave them hugs too. Though, they’d never seen Malfoy drunk before, and that he most definitely was.
“There’s some roots over there that need digging up too, Harry,” said Narcissa’s soft voice as she pointed to a patch in the giant garden. The sun blazed down on them, causing them both to break out in a sweat. Today, Narcissa had decided to do some gardening, and Harry helped.
“We’ll get you, you and your family. We’ll get you all thrown into Azkaban. This is your final warning. If you don’t sort shit out, you’re done for.”
Harry imagined they were back at Hogwarts, sneaking out at night when they were supposed to be asleep. He imagined Lucius to be Filch, patrolling the halls with his candle and Mrs Norris, face scrunched up as he attempted to see in the dark. Draco and Harry approached another corner, and Draco peeped round, a mischievous smile painted on his face.
Struggling to tie his tie, Harry stared at himself in the mirror. The scar on his forehead showed through his hair. Though all his features were the same as before, Harry felt as though he didn’t recognise himself, the person staring back at him was a stranger. A lot had happened since the battle of Hogwarts.
After getting himself ready, Harry met up with Ron and headed to the dining room for the usual breakfast. All the butlers and maids stood, waiting for the Malfoys to enter. And they did, one by one as usual, but Malfoy seemed out of sorts today. His hair wasn’t as pristine as it usually was, and there were dark circles under his eyes, darker than normal. Harry noticed Lucius walked with his chin cocked higher, he seemed to be more confident. Not that he never was, but today was different. Today felt very off to Harry.
There was a continuous tapping on Harry’s door. Groaning, he opened his eyes, hoping whoever it was would go away. Today was a Saturday, and Harry was supposed to be having the day off. But whoever this was behind the door definitely had other plans.
“The reason Ginny and I broke up,” Harry hiccupped, “is because I stopped finding girls attractive. I want to be with boys.”
Malfoy stood up in fury, throwing the cloth across the room, making Harry jump. Pain shot through his ribs and he suppressed a groan.
“We had a difference of preference,” said Harry truthfully, taking a large swig from his wizard’s brew. “I’m not drunk enough to give you the details.”
“He stopped my bodyguard from travelling with me, so I had to do deals on my own. I got caught. He’s focusing in intently on me.”
“How on earth do you already know that?” Asked Harry, grabbing the soap and lathering his body with it.
“Isn’t it beautiful?” shouted Malfoy over the sound of the thunder, “they remind us that we all have our breaking points. No matter how much sun we fill our lives with, there’s always going to be a moment where we need to have a storm.” A large grin spread across Malfoy’s face as he held out his arms, spinning in a circle once, laughter erupting from him again.
“I’d rather Malfoy than Lucius,” mumbled Harry, trying to ensure no one else could hear him. “I know Lucius hits the Muggleborns that work for him.”
“If it is okay, sir, I’d like to use the burrow as a meeting point and a place to receive my ribbons. Harry accidentally walked in on a meeting once, and it made me realise it’s far too risky to have my meetings at the manor.”
“You will do no such thing,” said Harry breathlessly before getting hit by another hex. This time it hit his arm, causing him to yowl in pain.
“Thank you,” responded Harry, taking a long drink from it. The alcohol burned his throat but brought warmth to his body instantly.
Draco’s head turned and his silver eyes lay on his mother. Harry saw his chin crumple as Narcissa rushed to the bedside. This was the first time the mother and son had seen each other since that fateful night, and it definitely made Draco emotional.
“Hullo, Harry,” she smiled as she allowed Harry to do his job, using his wand to check her and ensure Malfoy would be safe.
“Do you need anything?” asked Harry after a while of silence. He was unsure what to say to Malfoy, Harry had never thought he’d hear a vulnerable side of him.
“We will need to make a copy of those,” the taller man stated, getting out his wand. Harry stood firm, making some noise to ensure the men remembered he was there. Taking a firm grasp around the wood, Harry made his wand visible to them.
“I just want to know what’s happening, Harry,” she reached forwards and took his hand in hers, “Harry here has run away from the manor.”
“And guess what I found out was the inane, absolutely foolish stunt you pulled to have yourself assaulted? Selling illegal dark artefacts to Borgin and Burkes from our own personal, private collection,” explained Lucius in a quiet, cool voice. How he spoke had Harry’s hair standing up on end.
. It filled him with immense sadness he couldn’t get rid of. The pit of his stomach twisted, remembering back to the day Malfoy had questioned him about it. Back to the time when things felt they could be okay, even with Lucius as the minister. But now, that was all gone, and Harry didn’t think it would ever be able to return.
Malfoy then flopped down on Harry’s bed, still giggling to himself, resting one hand on his stomach while the other was tucked behind his head.
Then he worried about Malfoy, much to his surprise. He’d wondered if he’d gotten to bed okay, if his father had found out he’d been drinking, if he was upset, if he was eating right. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Malfoy eating more than just a few bites of toast. Thoughts swirled around his mind, shouting at him, wanting him to get out of bed and go to Malfoy’s room to check up on him. Harry had never felt this way about Malfoy before, it was new, and it consumed him.
Suddenly, Malfoy turned around and grabbed onto Harry, and within that second, Malfoy apparated them both. The surprise of it made Harry’s stomach churn and his head dizzy, and suddenly they appeared somewhere else.
“At least you didn’t become a Death Eater,” said Malfoy, and Harry noticed he started to rub his arm, right where the Dark Mark was. “It’s hard to bring yourself back from that.” Harry didn’t know what to say after that, so he just nodded and looked down at his hands. He had never had a civil conversation with Malfoy before, and it definitely felt weird, but it almost felt comforting to him. Silently Malfoy just walked past Harry, expecting him to follow, which, of course, Harry did. They ended up back at the office and Harry returned to his usual post, Ron watching him with a frown.
“It was fine,” Malfoy paused, swallowing nervously. “Father didn’t notice even though he came into the office not long after you left. I complained of a headache and went to bed before dinner. I think Astoria knew, though,” he spoke truthfully, the words just flowed together. It was easy speaking to Harry at this moment, Harry was the only person he felt he could trust. Something Malfoy had never felt before.
After spending an hour in the coffee shop, having two coffees, and listening to muggle conversations, he decided to go home. He found a private corner, away from any muggles, and apparated. Suddenly he was back in his living room. The feeling of apparating never got better, it always made Harry’s stomach churn. He remembered back to the first time he apparated, a side-along apparition with Professor Dumbledore. The feeling made Harry extremely queasy and it happened so quick. Nowadays, he apparated often, it was such an easy mode of transport to him. But, if he could floo somewhere, he’d pick that over apparition any day.
“I’m sorry for my wife’s rudeness,” said Malfoy after a few moments of silence, ensuring he didn’t look at Harry.
“I have an hour appointment every day. It’s not too bad here, I’m better than I was at home, at least.”
As he silently approached the doors, he heard a noise coming from inside the office. Instinctively his hand grasped at his wand in his jacket pocket, remembering back to the day Malfoy had nearly gotten injured by the men from the ministry. Slowly he crept further towards the door and carefully poked his head round. The sight he saw was something he wasn’t expecting.
“Yeah, I think he finds it funny that we now work for him,” shrugged Harry. “Better than the workhouses though.”
“Their world is so different to ours. I envy it, sometimes, it seems so much simpler,” Malfoy waved his hand at Harry. “Hurry up and get dressed.”
“Yes, this is Hugo, and this is Rose,” introduced Hermione, obviously excited for Astoria to meet them.
But, Harry was just a butler in this massive mansion, only seeing their public conversations. He didn’t know what they talked about behind closed doors, after dinner, when it was just the two of them. Maybe they were deeply in love, but Malfoy just didn’t want to show weakness like back at Hogwarts. Like back when he was ordered to kill Dumbledore…
“She does,” said Draco, avoiding eye contact but keeping his hand tight around Harry’s. “I told her a few months back. I have never been in love before, Harry. And then,
Silently, Harry ran his finger down the marking, making Malfoy’s hair stand on end. Then, he pulled Malfoy’s arm towards him, and gently pressed his lips against the dark mark. Malfoy closed his eyes, feeling every sensation it gave him. Sparks shot through his arm; the dark mark felt alive again, but not as it did before. This time, it did not hurt. Instead, it felt warm, it felt as though it was filling Malfoy’s veins with love.
It had been a tough year at Hogwarts. Being a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor took its toll on Harry each year, but he always looked forward to going back and teaching brand new faces. That was the most exciting part.
Once they had finished decorating, Malfoy stood at the doorway, arms folded, admiring the handiwork.
But, unfortunately, thirty minutes later, the wolf stopped. They had reached the outskirts of a village, one Harry knew to belong to wizards and witches.
Malfoy glared at him. “Because, Potter, if we take another day trip somewhere, I’d rather be seen with someone who doesn’t look like they’re stuck in the nineties. Please, go and try that on. I’ll bring you more.”
He entered the travelling room and grabbed the floo powder. Before throwing it down, he took a deep, nervous breath.
“I work there full time now,” explained Harry. “Malfoy wanted me to be his personal bodyguard. So even on the weekends, there I am, stood outside that damn office.”
Slowly, before their very eyes, the wand produced a silver light which danced around the darkness. The light started to transform. They watched as gradually an animal formed, and started to walk towards them, striding with confidence.
“Oh, really?” answered Mr Borgin, using the cloth to pick up the ball and look at it closer. “How do you know?”
“I need some air,” said Harry, storming out of the office before he could think twice. His blood boiled as he stormed through the corridors of the manor, trying to take deep breaths to calm himself down before returning to Narcissa. There was no logical explanation as to why Harry had become so fired up, but there it was, all of these feelings he felt he had suppressed because Malfoy needed him to suppress them, now out in the open.
“We should go back to the manor,” laughed Harry as he prodded Malfoy, finally noticing he was very drunk. “We need to sleep.”
“Live a little, Potter,” responded Malfoy, finally looking at him. His face was alive. Those grey eyes that normally appeared sunken and sad were now twinkling, filled with joy. There was colour in his face, his cheeks pink with glee.
“Continue the communications. If you send another three red ribbons, we will have to put you in hiding,” one of the men explained, to which Malfoy didn’t respond. Then, Harry heard a pop, signifying they had disapparated.
? Harry braced himself for maybe finding men in the office, having a secret meeting on how to destroy the muggleborns. Or Malfoy playing with another dark artefact, ready to sell for more money. Or Malfoy signing some illegal contracts-
As Harry made his way through the small village, he heard a noise behind him. Almost expecting the wolf again, he turned around, but was instantly hit with a hex. A sharp pain shot through his torso as he fell to the ground, clutching where it had hit. He looked up, seeing a man pointing his wand at Harry.
“Lucius obliviating Muggleborns. I don’t think he’d be allowed to,” said Harry, looking over to the sunset again. There was something about the red and orange hues that always drew him in. The sunset was always better than sunrise, he thought, as he enjoyed the darkness of the night that followed. There was something that seemed so personal about a sunset to him, and he couldn’t quite put his finger on why.
The two stared at each other for a good few seconds, and it seemed Harry’s kind eyes calmed Malfoy’s frantic ones.
“Yes. He attempted to worm his nasty way back into the Wizarding World, as if we wouldn’t notice. Of course, we would notice. We are thinking of obliviating him,” Lucius sipped at his glass of water. Malfoy only nodded in response.
Blaise Zabini was one of the next guests to arrive with a handsome man clung to his arm. They both wore very posh suits, with a Slytherin pin on their tie. Blaise was another wizard to openly be gay, like Dean and Seamus. Everyone had been very accepting of Blaise and his husband, and their wedding had apparently been beautiful, not that Harry was invited.
There was suddenly a rapid knock on the door. Everyone looked at each other, confused, as Ron and Hermione barely got visitors. Ron got himself off the sofa and opened the door to a very distressed looking Malfoy.
“Yes,” answered Harry, trying his hardest not to look down at the body that stood in front of him, trying to keep eye contact.
“I can deal with those consequences, Potter,” replied Malfoy, waving his wand, making the doors shut in Harry’s face.
“Face it, sir, you care about me,” said Harry sarcastically, with a small smirk on his thin lips. Laughing, Malfoy shrugged and pushed himself off the desk.
“I know,” replied Draco. With a frown, he closed the chest and quickly cast a shrinking charm. A handy spell he consistently used. Firmly holding the chest into his hand, he said, “not here,” before grabbing Harry’s hand and disapparating.
There was panic behind Harry’s voice. Malfoy had so much control over him, he could easily send Harry away to the workhouses, or any of his friends for that matter. Forgetting they weren’t in Hogwarts anymore seemed common for him now, especially since the pair were spending more time together, and he never wanted to overstep a line.
“No, he hasn’t really been at the office at all,” said Ron with a frown, “I’ve been helping some of the maids with Astoria because he’s hardly ever been there.”
“Draco,” slowly Harry made his way over and sat behind him, “we can’t keep secrets.” His green eyes stared deep into Draco’s, searching for an answer he was unsure he’d ever get. “That’s what destroyed us.”
Everything happened so quickly. The wizard on the right drew his wand higher. In that time, Harry noticed Malfoy’s wand on the floor, the men must have knocked it out of his hand when they walked in. As quietly and quickly as he could, Harry dived to the floor and grabbed the wand, grasping it tight before shouting “EXPELLIARMUS!”
“Oh, I think you are,” the one spat, grabbing Draco by the neck and slamming him against the cold brick wall. He heard his head smack against the brickwork, and he groaned as the pain shot through him.
He’d gotten better since then, or so Harry thought, but seeing him now made Harry think something bad was going on with George.
“Isn’t he supposed to be careful who he spends his time with?” asked Hermione inquisitively, her eyebrows furrowing as she poured cups of tea for the trio.
The golden sun peeked through a slice in Harry’s drawn curtains, shining onto his sleeping face. The warmth woke him up, and his green eyes looked around the room. Taking in his surroundings for the first time that day, Harry stretched his arms up and slowly sat. Another day at this job, that he hated.
“I will take you to Lucius and win the reward.” The man began stampeding towards him, and without a second thought, Harry disapparated.
she knows, Harry. She’s the reason I know. She found out when you came back after you had disappeared from the party. He told her everything, Harry. She knows
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat. He couldn’t believe what Hermione was saying. He completed Draco? Not only that, Draco’s own wife believed this to be true. Harry could feel the tops of his ears burning. There was nothing more Harry wanted than to be with Draco right at that moment. To feel their hands intertwined, to feel the warmth of Draco’s breath on his neck. The warm, comforting embrace Draco would give him, even though his frame was so small it didn’t seem like hugging him would do anything. Draco’s hugs caused Harry great relief, relief from the monsters that resided daily in his mind.
The rest of the night seemed tense around Malfoy and Blaise. They would look at each other from across the room, as if they knew what the other was thinking. Harry tried to avoid being near both men, just in case an awkward question got brought up.
Malfoy got Harry to stand in the office with him while he sorted out papers, organising everything for his meeting. He almost seems nervous, Harry thought, a frown furrowing on his eyebrows as he watched Malfoy pace about. His bony fingers seemed to shake as he picked up pieces of paper, checking them, then placing them back down, only to check them again moments later. The last time Harry had seen Malfoy like this was back at the battle.
“I’m sorry, Draco, but you have to,” shaking her head, Narcissa continued, “the ministry is nearly done with sorting out everything to do with your father. But the problem lies, they have no one to take over his post. They asked for you.”
“Oh, you two!” Mrs Weasley breathed, putting her hand to her heart and closing her eyes. “You’re going to be the death of me.”
After dinner, and after the children had gone to bed, the many bodies all sat around the fire on the sofas. Harry and Draco sat together, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest, tucked underneath his chin. He was certain Draco could hear his heart beating quickly, because for the first time in so long, he felt excited. Excited to have this beautiful man curled into him, in front of the people he calls family.
Hermione and Ron had arrived a while after Harry and Malfoy, Harry already slightly buzzed from the alcohol. He was excited to see his friends and gave them both big hugs. Although they were confused as to why he was there with Malfoy on his day off, they didn’t ask any questions, as this was one of the first times they had seen Harry having fun in a long time.
Dragging himself out of the bed, Harry put on his slippers and grabbed a towel, slinging it over his shoulder then picked up his toothbrush and toothpaste. He sauntered his way to the shared bathrooms, nodding his hellos to Ron Weasley on his way.
“What in Merlin’s beard do you do there?” asked George, looking back down at the chessboard to begin planning his next move.
“How are things at the Malfoys Manor?” questioned Mrs Weasley as she stirred a pot of soup. Harry had always wondered why she didn’t use magic to cook. Mrs Weasley had always said that it was more fun to cook without magic, it made the food taste better apparently. Sometimes Harry thought it just gave her something to do, especially now. All her kids had moved out aside from George, who’d fallen into a depression after Fred’s death. Now he looked after the house with Mrs Weasley, while seeing a mind healer once a week. Some days Harry couldn’t even look at George, knowing he was the reason for Fred’s death. It pained him to see George alone.
“Hello everyone,” called a voice from behind. Turning round in his seat, Harry saw a tall, slender figure and a mass of orange hair.
“I like the sound of the water. It makes me feel safe. The sound of running water. I can’t explain it, but it relaxes me. It’s almost as if the water’s my friend, I can talk to it and it will reply with its noises.”
“Fine,” said Ron grumpily, sipping at his black coffee. He definitely needs it, Harry thought. It seems like Ron woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning.
“Where did you learn about muggle food and get the money from?” asked Harry as he sat down opposite him, genuinely intrigued by Malfoy’s knowledge.
“Do you seriously think, out of all the people in this manor, out of all the people I know, I’d choose
The conversation flowed easily, and every now and then Draco would chime in. This warmed Harry’s heart, realising how comfortable Draco must now feel with the Weasleys. Though he knew it was going to be a tough few months, having to help Draco through the grief of losing Astoria, he felt positive. Times were changing, things were getting better. Things were going to be so much better.
“Clear,” he said, before grabbing Harry’s arm and rushing down that corridor. They heard a noise, and both flattened against the wall. Peeking round, Harry saw a member of the staff, one of the maids. Looking back at Draco, he put his finger to his lips, telling him to stay quiet. Imagining it was one of the professors, Harry did his best to breathe as quietly as possible, before checking again. She had gone.
“I don’t know why you’re getting so angry,” said Harry calmly, which only made Malfoy even more mad.
He paused for a moment at his bedroom, staring at the double bed. His memory flashed back to a few years ago, when he and Ginny lay together, hands gently entwined. Her beautiful ginger locks would tickle Harry’s cheek as they cuddled, her tinkly laughter filling the room.
“I think I can do whatever the fuck I like, Potter,” there was venom in Malfoy’s voice. “I’m part of the most powerful family in the Wizarding world. Why shouldn’t I be able to do what I want?” Shaking his head, he ran a shaky hand through his white blonde hair before turning back around.
The two arrived at St Mungo’s not long after. Nerves built up in Harry’s stomach as they walked along the sleek corridors, heading to the mind healing facility. He didn’t want to go in, he didn’t want to see George there, the guilt resided in him consistently.
“Come on,” Malfoy grabbed his hand and they walked to the till. “He’s going to wear this one out,” Malfoy said to the cashier, handing over the muggle money and grabbing the bags before turning on his heel and walking out of the shop. Harry watched as Malfoy secretly used his wand to cast a wordless shrinking spell on the bags before putting them in his pocket. Then, he held out his arm and looked over at Harry.
“Fine,” he sneered, “I’ll go and order our lunch.” Irritably Astoria sat down on the seat next to Hermione, quickly taking off her cardigan.
“What’s going on?” asked Ron, sitting down on the bed. “You can tell me anything, Georgie. You know that.”
“You okay, Georgie?” asked Ron, putting a hand to his forehead, breathing a sigh of relief when he was a normal temperature.
“Oh, Harry,” exclaimed Hermione as she ran over to him, engulfing him in the biggest hug he had in a long time. It had been two weeks since he had left the manor and so far, he appeared to be safe.
Climbing on, Harry started to pull the rope that anchored it down on the docks, before setting sail. There was nothing more relaxing, he thought, than sitting on the deck and watching the world go by. He enjoyed every second of it, all his bad thoughts went away and he focused on the landscape. Every now and then, he’d have a go at drawing the sites he saw, even though he wasn’t very good. It relaxed him, and he wished he could just escape everything and sail on his canal boat. Escape his past, his future, everything that burdened and had scarred him.
They stepped forwards, but just as he was about to reach the door, Draco stopped. “Do you think they will be angry to see me, the Weasleys?”
They walked in and she sent Harry straight over to the burrow’s lounge, where Harry found George and Mr Weasley.
As soon as the Malfoy’s sat, the butlers and maids swept into motion. As usual, Harry went round the table, pouring the water into the glasses, and made his way to Lucius. He swore as he poured the water, he could see the corner of Lucius’ mouth twitch, as if he had something on his mind he desperately wanted to get off, as if there was something that amused him. Attempting to ignore it, Harry moved to Malfoy, who just stared down at the table. Things seemed exactly how they were all those months ago, before Harry saved Malfoy, before everything between them had happened. It made Harry feel incredibly uneasy.
“That’s something I brought us here to talk about,” said Draco as Mr Weasley entered the house again.
Suddenly feeling overwhelmed, Harry made his excuses and left the room, heading straight for the bathroom and locking himself in. Tears stung his eyes as he stared at himself in the mirror. There was a lump in his throat that hurt him to breathe, and his chest felt tight.
After a long while of silence, Malfoy sauntered over to the bed and sat close to Harry. The air around Malfoy seemed cold to him.
“We were just walking around London,” lied Harry with a false smile. “Mr Malfoy wasn’t feeling tired and we went to a twenty-four-hour library. He ended up falling asleep for an hour or so, though.”
Harry looked up at him. There was a form of sincerity in Malfoy’s face, his eyes looked sorrowful, but not sad. The gleeful twinkle from when they were in the storm was still there. Harry could get lost in his eyes easily.
“You repeat any of that to anyone, and you’ll be sent straight to the workhouses, Potter,” he hissed, before turning on his heel and walking out of the door, leaving Harry stood there in shock.
“I don’t know what to do anymore,” Harry’s voice was quiet as he stared down to the floor, attempting to fight away frightened tears.
“Why do you keep asking questions?” Shaking his head, Malfoy pulled one of the drawers from the bookshelf and started fiddling around with stuff inside. “This is not on your payroll.”
Harry could feel his ears burning and goose bumps on the back of his neck. Why did Malfoy thank him, in front of everyone, the people who used to join in on bullying him? Shaking his head, Harry attempted to silently laugh off the thought. He was nothing but a bodyguard, a butler, to Malfoy. That’s all he ever will be. No matter the kiss, no matter the hug, no matter their deep conversations. Malfoy was married, trying to have a child, and Harry
Letting out an annoyed grunt, Draco climbed out of the bed and headed over to a large chest that sat underneath his window. Sitting cross-legged in front of it, he muttered “Alohomora” quietly, then slowly reached inside. The contents had been bound by a blood curse, to ensure anyone who may be snooping could never find them. And if they did, they suffered excruciating consequences.
The time rolled around for the guests to arrive, and they flowed in. A few Slytherins they recognised, such as Goyle, didn’t cause them any bother. It was odd to see him without Crabbe by his side.
“Sir,” started Harry, looking down at his lap to avoid eye contact, but he could tell Malfoy’s piercing grey eyes didn’t leave his face, “why are you being kind to me?”
“He’s been helping me chop the carrots while you laze about with your father,” huffed Mrs Weasley, stirring the soup once again.
“You wanted to see us, father?” said Malfoy confidently as he strode into the room. Harry traipsed behind him, his hands shaking from fear.
you?” asked Hermione, sitting next to him and placing a small hand on top of his. Harry looked at her, her dark brown eyes were filled with concern, dancing between his green ones quickly. A frown furrowed her eyebrows and she appeared to be examining his face for any sign of a jolt, or an expression that could be showing his true feelings.
“Yes, Mrs Weasley?” answered Harry, making his way over to her. Without saying anything, she pulled Harry into a large hug, squeezing him tightly.
Mr Weasley was taken aback by Draco’s compliment. “Well, thank you, we do appreciate it,” he looked over at Mrs Weasley, who nodded. “Of course we will help. Our family is directly involved in his reign as minister and we are petrified our grand kids will end up without a mother.”
“I hope you’ve learned your lesson, Potter,” spat Lucius, “you will never be my son’s bodyguard again. Do you understand? You will work alongside Narcissa’s butlers.”
Looking around his apartment for the last time, he felt a few tears threaten to fall. Although he hated the apartment, it held memories here, memories with Ginny, Ron, Hermione, their kids. Harry didn’t know if he’d ever see this apartment again. After switching off the lights, he grabbed some floo powder.
Never had Draco imagined he would have the golden trio surrounding him, taking care of him as he suffered the greatest loss he’d ever been through.
But Draco stood still. His eyes were tightly shut, expecting any moment for him to drop dead onto the marble floor. As he opened his eyes, he saw the ministers all rushing over to an unconscious Lucius to arrest him. Looking to the side of him, he saw his mother, her eyes wide, hand clasped over her mouth in horror.
Removing her hand, Narcissa flashed him one more smile, before walking back towards the garden. Harry stood there, frozen. The words replayed through his mind, over and over again.
Not too long later, the burrow was filled with witches and wizards from all over the world, including their ministers. Draco stood in the corner of the room, watching them with fear in his eyes, as they all talked together planning their attack.
“I- Nothing,” stuttered Harry, shaking his head. “I just couldn’t stop thinking about things and decided to take a walk. Are you okay?”
“Mal- sir,” said Harry, trying his best not to anger Malfoy, “I know we’ve always hated each other, but if you need to talk to someone…”
“Thank you,” she whispered, her hand slowly rubbing his back. “For everything you have done for this family. I know you don’t think so, but you have helped us immensely. You are my son,” she told him. Harry felt the tears well up in his eyes, he was sure it was just the whiskey making him emotional.
“I’m not sure,” replied Malfoy, running his bony fingers through his blonde hair. “It’s hard to trust anyone nowadays.”
“She wasn’t rude,” assured Harry, “you’re both more than welcome to join us.” Malfoy just nodded in response.
Without saying anything, Malfoy strode past Harry, expecting him to follow, which he did. Harry thought they would be going back to the office, but he was wrong. Instead, Malfoy lead him upstairs. He’d only been upstairs to Malfoy’s quarters a handful of times; his post was predominantly outside the office. The long black corridors were even more winding than those on the floors below. Every so often they approached a floor length window, with black curtains surrounding it. The view outside was astonishing, trees stretched for miles and miles. They truly were in the middle of nowhere.
He, for his whole life, had been unable to produce a patronus. He’d tried, he had read up as much as he could about it, he’d hired tutors to attempt to teach him. But it seemed that no matter what, no memory was powerful enough, not even to produce a small version of the charm.
“Ever since you arrived, I started to feel differently about her. I would look at you from across the room and my heart would flutter. I would tell myself it was nothing, shake myself off, but then you would pour my water. The closeness gave me butterflies. I would see you standing outside my office and I wanted to talk to you. Just talk. You made me realise I only married Astoria to please my parents, to carry on the family name, to live a somewhat normal life after the war. To bring a child into this world without the burden of Vol-” Malfoy looked down at his arms and began to rub where the dark mark lay. “Voldemort. Without the ideas of muggleborns and pure bloods being different. Without everything my father taught me. But then you came back into my life, and I realised that after all these years, all I ever wanted was you.”
“I’ll cast a protection,” Mr Weasley said, rising up from his chair with a grunt, “you two eat some breakfast. Draco looks like he needs it.” Chuckling to himself, Mr Weasley hobbled out of the door. Mrs Weasley ushered them both to the table. The fact that neither of the parents seemed bothered of his presence, and instead just treated him as a friend, made Draco feel safe.
“Just tired, Sunday’s shift has worn me out still,” lied Harry, shooting them a small smile to try and stop the couple from worrying. “I need an early night.”
“We’re here,” said Malfoy, stepping out of the elevator. Harry just about managed to stumble after him, his head now spinning with every movement he made.
“I’m unsure why the payments seem to be void,” Malfoy stated part way through the meeting. Harry noticed he hadn’t been paying too much attention to what they were saying, only to the actions they were taking. Something that Auror training had taught him.
“Is there anything I can do in return?” asked Harry suddenly, looking up at Mr Weasley who was now reading a copy of The Prophet.
With a flick of his wand, Harry got the fire going as even though it was summer, it was a very cold, wet, and stormy summer. There had been only a few days of blistering sunshine before the clouds had surrounded England and poured down. Not that Harry minded, he loved the rain.
Hermione had done all she could to help the situation, even after all the years of torment Draco put her in during Hogwarts. Every morning she would make Draco and Harry a cup of tea and a crumpet, even if Draco didn’t eat it, which happened most mornings. For the few moments Draco went to use the bathroom, Hermione would quickly use her wand to change his bedsheets, so he would always sleep in something clean.
“No,” laughed Harry as he passed the pure malt whiskey over to Malfoy. “I dated a few people back in Hogwarts, like Cho and I took Parvarti to the Yule ball,” Harry rambled on. “There were girls I had crushes on and I guess guys too, I just didn’t know it yet.”
“Harry, you can take Ron’s room,” said Molly, getting herself up, “I’ll go and get it ready for you.”
What he decided to pick up was a large notebook, which was nearly completely filled. Slowly, Draco flipped through the pages, checking over the work he had tirelessly done. Pages upon pages of logs, provided with proof, everything dated.
“It’s none of your business, Malfoy,” spat another man who was stood to his right. “We’ve got you now.”
“Nothing was going on,” responded Harry abruptly, sitting up properly now. “We were just having fun.”
“It’s complicated, and I am worried you will judge me for what I have to tell you,” swallowing, Harry began his story.
“My old friends,” greeted Malfoy excitedly, standing from his seat. He had placed himself at the head of the table, with Astoria on his left and Pansy on his right. “I’m so thrilled to have you here tonight, it has been far too long since we all last saw each other. I am delighted to see my friends here with their partners, and I am also thankful to have my wife Astoria by my side for this dinner. I would also like to take a moment to thank Potter, as shocking as it may seem. So thank you, Harry, for helping me today and for… Everything,” Malfoy took a few seconds, “I hope everyone enjoys their night!”
“Yes, I can! I have to, Blaise. Can’t you see that?” There was a long pause. Harry stepped back, accidentally bashing his foot into a wall with a clash. In an attempt to make it look like he had only just arrived, Harry continued walking forwards and turned the corner to see the two men stood there, Malfoy’s cheeks pink.
Malfoy slowly looked through each item of clothing, studying each one, running his thin hands over the material to feel it. After some careful consideration, he pulled out a suit and handed it over to Harry.
“Draco,” said Harry again a little louder this time. Malfoy’s eyes slowly opened, and he looked around, trying to take in his surroundings.
“You’re the best little brother I could ask for,” slurred George, rolling onto his side to try and hide his sobs, but they were too loud to hide. Harry stood awkwardly in the corner of the room while Ron took off George’s shoes and socks, then lay down next to him, putting an arm around him and holding him close.
Back at the manor, Harry noticed that Malfoy was still sleepy as he stood clumsily. Without thinking, Harry put an arm around Malfoy, helping him to keep his balance.
“What is it today?” asked Caractacus curiously, leaning over the counter slightly to try and get a closer look at the shrunken box Draco was pulling out of his robe pocket.
Butterflies danced around his stomach. This was it. This was the feeling he could never have with Ginny. This was the moment he longed for his whole life. Electricity is what you feel when you know they’re the one, they say, and Harry felt it. He could feel the electricity coursing through his veins just from the touch of Malfoy’s hand to his cheek, the other gripping Harry’s hair tightly.
“I wanted to go somewhere quaint and nice, somewhere quiet. Grab my arm, I’ll apparate us there,” instructed Malfoy. Placing the book back down on the table, Harry walked round and took hold of his arm. With a pop, they disapparated, and suddenly they were in Rye.
dark artefacts behind my back?” Leaning forwards, Lucius hissed in Malfoy’s ear, just loud enough for everyone in the room to hear, “you’re keep secrets from us, my boy, and I will weed them out of you, no matter what it takes,” and then he sauntered off, cloak trailing wildly behind him. The doors slammed shut, echoing throughout the manor, making Malfoy jump.
But Malfoy? He was still following in his father’s footsteps, having to do what he said. Malfoy was still scared of him.
“Still, I miss the feel of my wand,” whined Ron. The boys both went quiet immediately when the large doors opened to Malfoy’s office. They always creaked when it opened, warning them Malfoy was coming. Out he walked, his dark green robes floating along with him.
“No, I get it. Salazar, at sixteen I was attempting to kill my headmaster for the Dark Lord so he didn’t murder my parents. Everything was so strict with my family, I had to follow my father’s rules, think like him, act like him, look like him,” Malfoy took a sip of his cappuccino. His eyes seemed to reflect his past and Harry thought it looked as though his whole life was flashing before him. And for Malfoy, it was. Suddenly he was back on the astronomy tower, wand raised at Albus Dumbledore, the fear making his hand shake.
Toward the end of the evening, a few of the guests had gone home. The others were tipsy or drunk from the champagne they had consumed, including Malfoy and Astoria.
“When Draco made me his bodyguard, we started spending lots of time together. We’d take day trips out, I had to go everywhere with him, you see. But we started getting along extremely well, much more than I ever thought I would. And one night, we got drunk in the Three Broomsticks. When we went back to the manor, we… Kissed,” Harry didn’t dare to look at any of the faces staring at him, not wanting to see their reactions.
As for the football match that Hermione and Harry hear as they stroll home one night eating gelato, that is a true cherished memory of mine. I happened to be in Venice the summer they won the World Cup in 2006, and every single bar, restaurante, vaporetto with a satellite hook-up had the games on. All of the TVs were turned out into the public spaces so people could gather and watch as they ate their pasta and drank copious amounts of vino. There were two different live feeds coming into the island that were seconds off from each other, so every time there was a goal you’d hear one side of Venice erupt with cheers and then it would flow, like a sonic wave, over to the other side. Depending on which side of Venice you were on at the time, you’d either be three seconds ahead or spoiled for what was about to happen at every turn. It was such a collective, joyous experience. After each game the streets would explode with the sounds of bottles popping, old ladies banging pots and pans, fireworks, it was incredible.
She hears the rest of them making their way upstairs, but Hermione focuses all her extensive energies on assessing the state of the elf. She’d been left for three days under piles of rubble and dust, without hydration, food, or medical care all because Hermione, Luna, and Harry were so concerned over Draco, they hadn’t the presence of mind to consider if there were others left behind.
I don't quite know how to quantify the warning for what's below. Perhaps: mild gore combined with sexual content
Nodding, Harry doubles over, gone with it. He turns and presses his back to the door, sliding down onto the stone floor, hysterical.
Never before has anyone gotten caught . . . “ Draco is rambling while shaking his head. “I was so close to—” and then abruptly he cuts himself off, cheeks flushed.
Harry opens his mouth to elaborate, and then notes the sardonic expression on Draco’s frowning face. “Right. Sorry.”
Draco frowns, feeling off-balance and not liking the sensation in the least. “Have I missed something?”
Someone is handling him, gripping his shoulders, his face, pushing his hair off his forehead, pressing two fingers at his pulse point at his wrist, another to the gouge in his right leg. Draco cries out at the sensation, having forgotten about the rocks before a sudden numbing charm takes away the pain.
“It’s two in the morning—” the Healer begins to say but Draco silences her with a single, seething look.
(yes, Cecilia named the boat) in ages, what with the summer season leaving the canals overflowing with tourists, but since Cameron simply
Malfoy scrambled to his feet and turned pointedly away from Harry, his shoulders hunching as he curled in on himself. “You can’t—”
“If you two are about done, I dare say there are a few tourists out there who’d like to see this gallery without the addition of two young male nudes.” He paused for a moment, considering. “Then again . . .”
“Did you drug him?” Harry asks. Hermione tilts her head, wondering if there was more to the herb bundle than she first suspected. Harry scratches the back of his neck in thought, then hisses when he comes too close to his wound.
Looking up, Hermione quickly hides her shock at the sight of him so roused, no doubt hoping to break the news to him, herself. If only she ever bothered to learn how terrible Charlie is at keeping secrets.
“What?” Scorpius moves forward on his hands and knees, terror showing in his eyes. “Papa, what happened?”
It’s a rasp. A broken cry of a word, but Harry’s eyes go wide at the sound. He looks up, and sees Draco biting his lip, his face tense with concentration. Harry wants to pull back, to ask him if he spoke, but Draco’s holding tight to Harry’s hair, guiding him along his cock as he pumps faster and faster, reaching closer to that cliff’s edge of release.
He tucks himself away in the shadows of the alley, just far enough from the steps of the bridge not to feel its siren call, and gazes at the Venetian garden peeking out from a brick wall across the tiny canal. He finds himself wondering who owns the property and who tends to the garden. Would Malfoy, if given the opportunity, create such an oasis if he and Cecilia owned more than just a sprawling flat with a balcony to populate with greenery? Harry finds himself hoping that Malfoy would, and enjoys several minutes picturing his silver-blond head covered in a wide-brimmed hat bobbing along the olive trees and rosemary bushes, pruning and . . . whatever else gardeners do. The image makes Harry feel warm, and then he frowns, taken aback by such whimsical musings in regards to someone who, up until last night, had long been considered
Pushing up from the ground, he brings his left hand to the sensitive skin of his neck, applies pressure, and hears a responding hiss on the wind. His opposite hand speeds up on his cock, so close to climax his toes are curling with the need to finish. He presses again, and this time, it’s a moan that echoes out across the water. That moan reverberates all along his skin, leaving gooseflesh in its wake. Another flash of light, another moan, and with a strangled cry, he comes.
Malfoy sighs, suddenly forlorn. The couple has now finished, it seems, judging by the lack of amorous sounds coming from below. “Too bad they weren’t both men.”
He leans his head back on the wall, staring up at the ancient stone of buildings that loom large yet not unfriendly around him.
The water rippling against the basin echoes around them, licking at their exposed skin. Harry refuses to draw breath, his lungs burning until finally, his mind screaming for oxygen and his body reacting to Draco’s presence, his patience snaps and he exhales, harsh and hurting. Draco, losing a battle all his own, sinks down lower, coming to sit fully atop Harry’s thighs. Harry’s eyes prickle at the corners and he blinks away the sting, the relief of skin finally meeting skin like a gut punch to his senses.
“I’ve heard my father speak about the place we found Draco since I was little. He’s always been very passionate about his projects, whether it be his garden of Dirigible Plums, or his constant research on everything from the phases of the moon to the biological makeup of magical creatures.” Luna magicks the kettle to heat on the hob. “But several years ago, he stopped.”
She steps back from the door, biting her lip, feeling horribly guilty. She’s alone in the hallway, Harry has already collapsed on his bed for the evening.
