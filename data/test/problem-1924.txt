Malfoy’s lips open, and he seems to be at a loss for words.
“Draco…” Harry can only manage to repeat his lover’s name, over and over again, all other words lost in the pleasure and the heat of the moment, the feeling of Draco filling him, holding him, whispering against his skin how amazing he feels, how stunning he is. Harry’s never felt special, nor beautiful, but Draco somehow manages to make him believe that he is, for a heartbeat, whilst their bodies are joined together and Harry desperately chases his release.
“He had nowhere to go!” Potter shouts, his magic flaring up and making Draco’s skin prickle. “Was I supposed to let him live on the streets? How was I going to find him to check on him?”
“Bloody brilliant, I am sure you organise lots of parties with all your friends. Now, if you don’t mind, I have a panic attack waiting for me in my bedroom, and a bridge to find.”
“Have I said something wrong?” he asks on their way back to the parlour, Draco’s hand guiding him.
“Thank you,” he whispers.
Malfoy sits up in bed, biting on his bottom lip as he tilts his head to better see Harry.
It’s not that he cares about Auror Franklin that much; that witch looked a million years old. Draco could have escaped to Mexico under her nose and the old bat would have never even realised.
The comment hits Harry like a slap across the face. His eyes open wide as he stares at Malfoy’s smirking lips, at his eyes, alive with mischief.
“You wish, Potter,” he whispers. “A little room just for you and me so that you can fuck me as you please. Dream on.”
“But…” Harry swallows loudly, moving so that he can look Draco in the eyes. “But I’m so fucked-up, Draco…”
“How are you holding on, Harry?” she asks, and he says he’s fine, okay, alright, a series of meaningless synonyms. “You know I’m always here for you, if you want to talk.”
“I was wondering if you could help me with a book,” Malfoy says, his cheeks turning pink and making Harry’s stomach do a weird twist that he’s not expecting. “I can’t seem to open it.”
Surprisingly enough, he feels better afterwards. He feels like shit for destroying the parlour and Malfoy’s room, for making people clean up after his tantrums, but he is less angry. Like the sea after a storm, murky but still.
“I can’t sleep with you, Harry,” Draco replies, shaking his head, his eyebrows creased. “We were lucky no one caught us last time, but it’s too risky.”
, where I also post my drarry microfics.
Harry shook his head and simply muttered a “never mind, you don’t get it.”
What the fuck is he doing with his life?
“I guess we need to talk,” he admits, staring at the crackling fire, remembering the time he saw Sirius’s face appear among the flames. If only he could go back in time and speak to his godfather again, to ask him for advice. He feels so lost and young sometimes, no one to turn to when he messes up.
“Besides…?” Harry encourages her.
“You can use my wand,” Harry repeats, his voice unwavering. “I used yours, after all.”
Harry looks at his hands. They’re still shaking, and his fingertips are white, as if the circulation had been cut off. He shivers, suddenly cold, wishing to be sitting by the fire, with Draco next to him.
“You’ve got to be kidding me, Malfoy!” Ron shouts, his face turning red.
“I think you need something strong,” he comments when Harry sits at the bar.
“Yes. Thanks,” Draco murmurs. “Much better. You’re getting really good at this, Healer Potter.”
Kingsley huffs and rolls his eyes, and Draco fidgets next to Harry.
“I know you have lunch with the Weasleys on Sunday,” Draco says, but Harry shakes his head.
The days went by and the Christmas cheer started filling the corridors and the classrooms. Hagrid had placed two massive trees in the Great Hall and they saw them passing by, still refusing to enter the room. People started talking excitedly about the holidays, about presents and finally spending time with their loved one. And Draco used to love Christmas so much. He used to look forward to spending time with his parents, at home, decorating the Christmas tree with Mother, every bauble with its different little story that she would tell with a smile on her face. He used to spend ages choosing the right present for his friends, waiting impatiently for the owls bringing his own gifts.
“You can’t, they’re going to use them to collect money for the War Orphans,” Harry reminds him, nervously pacing around the room, feeling a little more desperate every second that goes by.
“I didn’t know you were Teddy’s teacher,” Harry says, skipping greetings.
“I know it’s not rational,” he interrupts, opening his eyes. “I know you’re not going to drop dead if I don’t check under the bed, but if I don’t do it…if I don’t wash my hands, or do these things, then the anxiety gets really bad. And it gets worse and worse the more I try to resist, until it’s too much. Until it all feels so tangible and certain that I
“Salazar, Potter,” Draco says, finally turning towards him, his eyes a bit red, “your stupid owl is a bloody lunatic! It has broken two of my windows. Besides, your handwriting is fucking illegible. It takes me hours to decipher your chicken scratch.”
“Have you seen Harry Potter?” a little first year asked, clearly unfazed by the tense atmosphere his friend’s words had created.
“It’s just the Death Eater,” a blonde girl said. He noticed hands going for their wands, his own fingers gripping his, hoping not to have to use it. His sentence had been clear. No improper use of magic, no attacks, no dark magic. Azkaban still had an empty cell with his name on it.
So he keeps on exchanging letters with Malfoy, of all people. They insult each other, but there’s no bite to it, not anymore. They simply do it out of habit, to keep a resemblance of normality where there isn’t none. They’re both too tired and worn out. The world is not the same. Their lives have been turned upside down, for Merlin’s sake, and Harry wonders, what’s the point? What’s the fucking point in hating each other, when so many people have died? When he’s lost so much that he feels numb with it?
“Stop moaning and do my Muggle Studies homework,” he says. “A deal’s a deal, Harry.”
“It’s my house, Potter, and I’ve been living here for most of my life. I’m still alive, aren’t I?”
“But it’s not working,” Draco says, a grimace on his face. “I don’t think I’m fertile, in spite of the potions. And I’m running out of time. So Mother has arranged a meeting with Madam Greengrass, hoping that she will agree to let me marry Astoria.”
And without meaning to, Draco fell in love with him. It was too easy, really, because Harry was just lovely. He was messy and lovely and definitely a bit broken.
Their Muggle Studies lesson goes from bad to worse. Professor Newman insists on them all making a lemon meringue pie and Draco pales when he sees the eggs.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Will you marry me?"
“I’m not wearing anything underneath,” Malfoy admits after a few seconds. Harry’s cock becomes impossibly hard, both at the thought of Malfoy’s scars, and at the fact that he’s wearing Harry’s clothes directly against his skin.
“I love you,” Harry whispers against his skin.
Harry starts unbuttoning Draco’s robes, his gaze never leaving him.
“No,” Harry says, shaking his head, a calm determination finally settling his nerves. “I am not going to let people hurt him anymore. And you can think about what
Harry pretends not to notice the way Draco’s eyes widen at the mention of
“Aww, look at him blush,” Neville says. “How cute!”
They don’t talk about it in the morning.
“Take your clothes off,” Draco instructs, and Harry complies, in a daze. He sits there in his underwear as Draco undresses. “I’m going to take a quick shower. Sleep, if you’re tired.”
On Saturday he’s a bundle of nerves and Hermione continues asking what’s going on with him, but he keeps on saying that he’s fine. They meet up with Ron again and then after lunch he excuses himself, saying that he wants to give them a chance to be together. They both blush and he sneaks out of the Three Broomsticks and then into the Hog’s Head. Aberforth looks at him like a grumpy goat.
The Medi-Witch nods, confused, and Harry gathers the courage he needs.
Malfoy lifts his eyes from an illustrated book with pictures of trolls and goblins moving on the pages, and his grey eyes look like a pool of sadness.
“Potter,” Malfoy whispers, still loose and soft after his orgasm, his voice hoarse. Harry’s suddenly hit with the realisation of what he has done.
“You fucking wish,” he replies angrily. “Let’s go.”
“Reading,” was the simple reply he received.
“I can’t,” he groans, wishing to be elsewhere, counting the hours until Saturday.
He’s just so unbelievably tired. He hasn’t slept in forever. He feels nauseous with exhaustion, desperate and sad. He feels so lonely. He wants to be touched and to run his hands on Draco’s smooth skin. He simply wants to sleep next to him.
Besides, Malfoy is keeping him distracted, entertained. Harry is so engrossed in the stories he’s uncovering about their ancestors, that he always wants to know more. And a part of him, one that he tries to silence more often than not, wants to know more about Malfoy too. Looks for little clues, for small sentences scattered here and there in his letters.
“I came back two years ago, did my teacher training course at university in the UK and then last year I found a job at Teddy’s primary school.”
“I’m fine,” he insists, knowing full well that he’s anything but.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
The knocking at the front door pulls Harry out of his shock.
“Brings back bad memories,” is Harry’s laconic answer. He weighs some pasta on the scales and then adds the chopped tomatoes to the pan and stirs the sauce, adding some basil leaves and a teaspoon of sugar.
“Exactly, so let’s save each other some time,” Harry points out and turns his chair so that he’s facing Draco. They’re both in their Auror uniforms, Draco’s looks perfectly pressed and pristine, while Harry’s is open at the neck and all wrinkled.
He is happy.
Draco elbows him in the ribs, and Harry can’t stop laughing.
“Oi, Harry,” Ron waves a hand in front of his face. “Your eyes are ferret-shaped again.”
It all makes sense, but at the same time it doesn’t. Why are they not sitting by House anymore? The change is so baffling that Ron stops panicking, the colour returning to his face as Hermione guides him to the right side of the Hall, and they take a seat next to each other.
“Always so impatient,” Harry mutters, adding a third finger. He loves the way Draco’s pink rim stretches around him. He can’t wait to put his cock inside, but he wants to make sure Draco is ready first.
“I think I’ll stay here for a little longer,” Harry hears himself say. Malfoy’s leg stills, and a lock of hair falls onto his face, but Harry knows that he’s watching him. “I fell asleep, and I didn’t manage to finish my book.”
Draco shakes his head and finally looks at him, his eyes pale and brows knitted in concern.
“I just…” Harry wants to explain, but he doesn’t know what to say. “It’s complicated.”
Harry contemplates Draco’s long fingers as they scribble intricate floral patterns on his Transfiguration notes. He recognises a tulip, a peony, roses and lilies. A narcissus.
Potter’s magic sizzled, the air crackling with it, and Draco felt afraid of him, for the first time since they had started living together, but then Potter grabbed his shoulders and took a deep breath, trying to calm down.
“I’m going to take a shower,” the blond announces. “I know you probably have better things to do, but you can stay, if you want.”
“Potter?” he hears Malfoy ask. Is it too weird to sleep here? He did it the day before, and nothing happened. He knows Malfoy won’t hurt him, not with a house full of Aurors. Besides, he could have done what he wanted to Harry the night before, when it was just the two of them, and he didn’t.
“Okay,” Harry says, “I’ll get your clothes clean in the meantime.”
It feels weird on Harry’s tongue. It hasn’t got the same liquid and familiar feel as Malfoy, rolling in and out of his mouth like a wave. Plus, it reminds him of Sirius.
“Still Harry Potter,” he replies. “Pleasure.”
Harry deflates, feeling all the tension leave his shoulders.
Surely not.
Maybe not everything is lost.
“I want to see the scars on your face…please,” Harry blurts out, wanting to touch them, to run his fingers on them. Draco’s eyes stay closed as he wandlessly reverses his
“Mate, you look like you’ve slept for a week,” Ron notices. “Was Nev’s calming potion that good?”
Draco moves and his mouth is on Harry’s again, tasting like him. But Harry doesn’t care as his fingers roam on Draco’s scarred skin, gently tracing the lines left by his own magic, slowly going down, until they curl around Draco’s cock, stroking him faster and faster. Draco comes with a muffled groan, followed by a little sob and Harry would pay to see him right now, to be able to admire his flushed cheeks and full pink mouth.
“No one has ever seen me naked since the war…” Draco mumbles and Harry leans forward to gently kiss his cheek.
“Well, isn't that brilliant?” he asks himself, since there’s no one else he can talk to. “Absolutely fucking marvellous!”
Harry’s eyes open wide and he gapes, making Draco burst out laughing.
“It’s fine with me,” Draco says, surprising Harry with how calm he is about it. “I don’t want to be a coward anymore. Besides, I am not ashamed of being gay, and you’re the best boyfriend I could ever have. They will all be envious of Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and current partner of the Boy Who Lived Twice to be shagged by a Slytherin.”
When he wakes up in the morning, Harry is gone.
“You didn't have to. I...” Potter starts, wiping his face with his hand. “That's not why I took you in. I don't want…”
“You do look a million times hotter without your stupid glasses on, you know?” Malfoy says and Harry can feel his cheeks catching fire.
“You were made to take my cock,” he mutters. “Look at you.”
He waits until everyone else goes to bed, until the only people left aside from him are Parkinson and Draco.
“I’m your mate?” he asks, slowly caressing Draco’s hair with one hand and his back with the other. He lets his fingers slide over soft feathers, feeling the expanse of them and not managing to reach the end. He wonders how big they are, what colour.
“No,” Draco insists. “It was just a Boggart. I’ve never thought these things about you, and I never will.”
“Something new.” Pansy gives her a small bag and Astoria’s eyes open wide as she extracts a bottle of expensive perfume.
“Since last summer,” Harry replies, focusing on Draco’s fingers and the tip of his wings. The feathers are ivory and there’s a gentle blue tinge to them towards the end. He wishes he could see both of them, could see Draco fly.
“Well, aren’t you a ray of sunshine?” Potter replies sarcastically, but he looks like he doesn’t really mean it, like snapping back is costing him too much effort. “Do you have a place to stay? I’ve just been told you need to vacate the property within twenty-four hours.”
“Still, you didn’t have to—“ Harry tries to protest, but Malfoy cuts him off.
“Yes,” he murmurs. “Thank you.”
“Hermione, I’m so sorry,” Harry says, his voice breaking.
Harry laughs and then takes a walk around, killing time before his meeting with Draco. He goes to the Hog’s Head and gets lunch, this time polishing the plate and making Aberforth grunt in appreciation.
“We could skive off the club,” Harry says, tracing Draco’s top lip with his tongue, making him moan. “I have my cloak and the Gryffindor eighth-year dorms will be empty at this time of day. I could smuggle you in.”
“You?” Harry asks, praying that he’s understood correctly. There  were rumours, but one can never be too sure at Hogwarts.
“What’s up, mate?” he asks and Harry sighs.
“He came back yesterday evening looking like that,” Zabini says, exiting the bedroom he shares with Draco. “His robes were a mess, all covered in blood and ripped. He had a massive strop about it as well. Took him ages to fix them.”
Harry shakes his head, struggling to get enough oxygen through his lungs, but Draco flicks his wand and the
, but Malfoy seems unfazed, as if they had already agreed there was going to be a next time before Harry even arrived.
Harry closes his eyes and just breathes while Draco pushes a lubed-up finger inside him later. Slowly, knuckle by knuckle. He feels Draco’s eyes on him, studying his every move. It feels odd at first, intrusive but in a way that he already secretly likes, because it’s Draco’s finger inside him. And then Draco starts moving, in and out, curving his index finger and making Harry gasp.
“There are spells for that…” Draco says, finally moving to take a peek at him.
“As you like Potter. You snore, anyway.”
“Why do I have to work with Hermione?” Parkinson complains. “As if we don’t already spend enough time together!”
On the first day of January at ten o’clock sharp, Harry grabs his Invisibility Cloak and heads for the Floo, feeling his skin prickle with anxiety and his heart beating at a steady rhythm in his chest.
“A curse-breaker,” he repeats, his voice soft and wistful.
“I don’t feel safe sharing a room with a Death Eater,” everyone seemed to flinch and stared at him, “my parents won’t allow it. I haven’t come back to Hogwarts just to be murdered in my sleep.”
They design their menu for the Muggle Studies project with Draco’s OCD in mind. Draco can’t touch raw meat, but eggs also appear to be a trigger, so Harry handles dessert.
“Are you planning on skipping dinner?” he asked on their way back to their room.
“You could mention in your interview how important it is to wear the colour purple during the first full moon after the winter solstice,” she says.
“Whatever, Potter.”
“I don’t want to…I made a mistake…”
When they get to the kitchen, Draco is standing next to the cauldron, his sleeves pulled down and his face pale.
…” he bit his lip as Potter’s thumb swiped over the head of his cock, spreading the precome that had gathered there, and then his fist moved down and up again, bringing the foreskin over the head with a twist of his wrist. Draco moaned and his underwear disappeared as felt Harry’s hard cock sliding between his arse cheeks.
“I really liked it there,” he says. “It felt like home. I enjoyed making dinner for you, going to the market. I miss our neighbours and Italian friends. But it’s okay if you want to keep on travelling.”
“Cup of tea, love?” Draco asks, and Harry nods, because the words are still painfully stuck in his throat.
A tear falls down his cheek.
“How is that an excuse? Shame on you for cheating,” she reprimands him. “Ernie, come here with your Potions essay!”
He thought he was supposed to become an Auror if he made it in one piece or find another job. Get on with life.
“Okay,” Draco whispers, and Harry moves a little closer, unsure where to put his hands, what the rules are this time as to what he’s allowed to do. He looks up at Draco and asks a silent question with his eyes.
“Yeah?” Harry asks, taking a step forward. “
“Everybody out!” the professor shouts, but the door catches fire. Parkinson screams, and Smith swears out loud. “
Ron looks like he might burst from anxious excitement, and Harry smiles at him. Suddenly, he remembers that he hasn’t gotten a present for Draco either.
“Can you at least keep your brooms?” Harry asks, and Malfoy’s gaze leaves the book to meet his.
So they ended up drinking together, moving closer on the sofa, until Harry was in Draco’s lap, kissing him with such abandon that Draco found himself moaning into his mouth. He let his fingers slide under Harry’s t-shirt, stroking his warm skin, feeling the scars under his fingertips and wishing he could kiss all of his wounds better. Harry’s lips were soft against his, his tongue exploring Draco’s mouth as the movement of his hips sent shivers down his spine.
The rest of the day goes in a blur, between homework and essays, revision and the occasional game of exploding snap—Ron insists on taking regular breaks, and Harry’s grateful for it.
The day Draco Malfoy finds out that the Manor has finally found a new owner is a Tuesday. He stops in his tracks on the way to the kitchens, the letter from the Ministry still clutched in his hands, which have started to tremble ever so slightly.
“Ron invited me,” he replies, his words careful and calculated, “but I was wondering if you would consider coming with me to Grimmauld Place instead.”
He stroked them slowly, trying to delay their orgasm, enjoying the feeling of Harry’s hands all over him, mapping his body and setting his skin on fire.
“No,” Harry replies wetly. “We had to queue for two hours to get in. There’s still so much to see.”
He observes what Potter eats, then asks Kreacher to buy the right ingredients, and he spends a ridiculous amount of time making dinner for both of them.
“It doesn’t feel like home to me anymore,” Draco replies, his thumb stroking Harry’s cheekbone. “But I…I just wanted to get my things back. I don’t even have a photo of my mother. That hurts more than anything else…”
“You’re clearly cheating!” Draco complains, blond hair flapping wildly in the wind, cheeks rosy from exertion and grey eyes flashing. Harry has never loved him more.
“Harry, you need to cast the spell,” Draco reminds him, a distant voice behind him.
Ron grumbles, but then gives them both an awkward pat on the back.
“Aren’t you forgetting something?” Draco asks, taking his hoodie and pyjama top off in one smooth move that leaves Harry breathless. “Mind your Ps and Qs, Potter.”
Draco doesn’t want him anymore. He probably never wanted him to begin with. He was lonely and depressed, on his own at the Manor over the summer. But now he has his friends, and Harry’s probably just an inconvenience.
“Peppermint and dittany,” he said, his voice sounding different, frayed at the edges. Potter’s eyes were staring at his mouth, his lips parted.
“Please,” she scoffs.
“Excuse me,” Draco replies, “but I would like you to leave my arse alone.  You’ve played with it already.”
“You’re late,” Hermione says as a greeting, raising an inquisitive eyebrow.
“We’ve lost so much time…” Harry considers. “Think about all the years we could have spent together.”
“No,” Draco replies, his eyebrows knitted in concern. He hasn’t found the courage to ask Potter if he’s going to kick him out once his house arrest ends, but he knows the Gryffindor will never do something so hurtful. Still, Draco is worried. He has no job and no place to call home.
starts playing, making him shut it and throw it at Harry.
He washes his hands, taking deep breaths, telling himself that it’s just a bloody cupboard. He’s never opened it, insistently trying to ignore its existence, but now he stands in front of it, hand on the knob for a minute, then two, then five, sweating. His breathing comes up short, his chest becomes tight.
“I just want you,” Harry repeats, like a mantra. “I want you so badly it hurts.”
Harry holds him tight and buries his face in Draco’s neck, breathing hard, inhaling Draco’s smell to calm his nerves. Draco’s hands draw him close and they just lie there for a while.
“Harry! I’ve missed you so much! How are you doing?”
“Harry, the only thing I like about them is that
“Like being loved?” she completes his sentence, and Harry nods, wondering how on earth she knows.
Harry feels his cheeks on fire, but then he tries to focus on the fact that Draco just said that they could have sex, so he leans forward and brushes his fingers on Draco’s cheek.
“Can we go now?” Harry asks, wanting to get out of there as soon as possible. He wants to go home and press his body against Draco’s. To feel him relaxing in Harry’s arms, safe and sound.
He’s changed.
What the fuck has he got himself into this time? This was supposed to be a quiet and relaxing year, full of boring essays and too much homework.
“You’re not dead,” Draco murmurs, wrapping his hands around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer. “You’re so full of life. You feel pain,” he says, placing a hand on Harry’s chest, where his heart is. He moves it lower, to cover Harry’s cock, “You feel pleasure. You laugh, and you cry. You’re alive, Harry. Don’t ever doubt that.”
“Wow,” he whispers in awe, and Malfoy scoffs.
He will tell Draco about Ron’s Christmas presents.
“Tell you what, sweetheart?” Draco asks, summoning a sponge and soap and lathering Harry’s shoulders and chest.
“Draco, please,” Harry begs, taking another step, “I just want to kiss you, please let me. Oh my god, I’m going to die, if I don’t kiss you right now.”
Harry puts his own coat on and holds Teddy’s hand as they walk down the little country road that leads to the town centre. Harry moved to the small village less than a month ago, to be closer to Teddy and Andromeda and spend the summer holidays with them. He used to floo from his London flat a few times a week to look after Teddy, but there was no point in paying an arm and a leg to rent a place he didn’t need anymore. He’s better off now, breathing fresh sea air and enjoying a quiet life in the middle of nowhere, with no reporters from the
“Of course, you are,” Potter replies matter-of-factly. “Draco, I want you to come.”
“So what did you tell Marelli about me?” he asks, and Draco’s cheeks turn a lovely shade of pink.
“That would be impossible,” Harry replies, leaning forward to capture Draco’s lips into another parting kiss. “I hope your wings disappear soon.”
“You look like shit,” Draco replies, because the six months under house arrest in complete isolation have done nothing to improve his bad temper.
“You can always come and live with me next year,” she tells the blond. “So don’t worry about anything, okay?”
“You’re going to get sick,” Draco murmurs, his voice choked. “Or you’re going to die. You’re going to leave me.”
“I’m not going anywhere unless it’s with you,” Draco replies, then sniffs loudly. Harry traces one of the scars on his face with gentle fingers, then tucks a loose strand of hair behind a perfect ear.
“I want to come inside you so badly,” Draco whispers against his ear, moving so that his chest is pressed flush against Harry’s back. “You’re so tight and so wet for me, Harry. And I’m the first one to take you, Merlin…Harry…”
Harry takes him to bed and fucks him slowly that night, showing as much care and tenderness as his faulty heart can manage. He comes deep inside Draco, his hand holding the blond’s arm as his lips kiss the painted skin, whispering his love against it.
The Great Hall is not the same, though. There are eight tables, instead of four, and the students are gathering at the corners of the room, not knowing where to sit.
“Does he know what happened during the war?” Draco asks Harry while Kreacher starts recounting how beautiful Narcissa was when she came to visit the house decades before. Harry shakes his head, and Draco sighs.
Draco is drenched.
“I know…” Harry swallows, looking down at his feet, then back into Draco’s eyes. “I know she’s family to you, and I’m nothing, but…”
“It’s embarrassing,” the blond whispers. He moves his foot away, making Harry feel a little lost and craving for more. He’s also dying to find out what on earth happened at community service.
Harry’s eyes open wide, surprised by the kindness Malfoy is showing. He had meant to ask for Sirius’s photos, but completely forgot about it.
“Shush, you plonker,” Draco hisses. “What if someone hears us?”
, but he doesn’t know if he can be that honest.
and then safely securing it inside his pocket.
“Too risky,” Draco mutters, and then they’re off to lunch. The Great Hall is too loud and crowded for the intimacy Harry craves. He wants to hold Draco’s hand when he’s looking like that, as though he were about to fall apart. He wants to hold him together.
“That sounds delightful,” Luna says with a dreamy smile. “I bet you would be great, Neville!”
Harry complies, because he wants to know what on earth happened to his Auror partner – and also because Ron is making him uncomfortable by glaring at him and repeating, “The ferret, of all people!”.
Draco still had a million questions swimming in his head, a whirlpool of doubts keeping him up at night and distracted during the lessons. He wondered what all of that meant to Harry, what
They settle into their usual routine of preparing tea. Harry boils the water, and Malfoy chooses a new set of teacups. There’s a tiny wizard or witch on each one of them, sitting down or standing still. As soon as Harry pours the hot tea, his wizard seems to come to life, twisting and shrinking down until it turns into a bird and starts flying around the ceramic cup.
“Here,” Greg says, dropping something in Harry’s lap. It’s a tea cosy and Harry realises in horror that the knitting pattern represents a snake and a lion French kissing in what can only be described as a lascivious way.
Draco casts a quick cleaning spell on his mouth and then he moves. His fingers slide out, making Harry groan, until the blond is beside him, kissing the corner of his mouth.
“Go,” he repeats, “hopefully I will see you on the Hogwarts Express.”
Malfoy opens a trunk and gets some funny clothes and hats out, and they both laugh at how ridiculous they look.
It's the two of them again, but they're eleven. Malfoy offers his hand.
“He doesn’t move as much when other people touch my bump,” Harry says with a smile.
Aberforth leaves the room before Harry declares his destination, saving him a lot more questioning.
The plan is clear and simple, but it doesn’t take into account the general uncooperativeness of the Slytherins.
Draco decides to make breakfast for Potter every morning, to make him the usual cup of chai tea with plenty of milk and two teaspoons of sugar that Draco has seen the Gryffindor prepare every morning. He makes him scrambled eggs, sometimes toast, and a full English at the weekend. He makes him dinner too, and Potter starts coming home earlier, changing into Muggle clothes and joining him in the kitchen to have a chat whilst Draco cooks.
“I want you inside me,” he whispers, and Draco smirks, but Harry shakes his head. “In here,” he explains, pointing at his forehead, “while we do it.”
“Is it a married man?” she asks, lowering her voice despite the spell.
He takes Hermione’s hand and holds it gently and she squeezes back, turning her head to wipe away a few tears.
“Well, you’re clearly better at cooking than you are at Potions.”
“Professor,” Hermione starts, ignoring the Slytherin’s annoyed looks, “will you still be covering the modules that will be tested in the final examination or are you planning on using a completely different scheme of work?”
“Harry.”
“Is she really that unwell?” Harry asks, tilting his head, his stomach warm and full.
He feels Potter’s eyes on him when they cross paths in the morning and on the weekend. He can practically sense those green eyes staring at him, roaming over his body. As if Potter had seen him for the first time. As if he were hungry for something that Draco can’t identify.
Harry frowns, looking at Zabini’s perfectly arranged black hair and raises an eyebrow at him.
Hozier, “Wasteland, baby”
“Draco!” Parkinson screams when she enters the common room, flinging herself into the other Slytherin’s arms with a delighted squeal. “How are you, my darling? You have to tell me
“What potions? Nothing you could have bought over the counter would have helped much.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione comments, “we’re so very happy for you.”
“Want to feel you,” Harry says, capturing Draco’s mouth and making him groan.
“Harry, there’s no need t—” Draco murmurs, sounding terrified.
Harry chuckles, and Draco rolls his eyes, taking his clothes off and slipping into his soft pyjamas.
“They left us waiting for hours and hours, whilst countless wizards and witches tried to hex us and spat at us. And I couldn’t cast shield charms, so we just had to take it and be quiet. I waited and waited, until it was evening, and I realised that no one was going to come. So I took her home and brewed potion after potion, until I found one that worked.”
“I…I…” Harry mutters, gaping like a fish out of water.
“Why did you say that mating with me was a bad idea?” Harry asks, the question burning in his head since the afternoon. There’s a pause and then Draco starts playing with his curls, his fingers delicate and gentle.
“Shit, what happened?” he ran to him. He sat down on the bed next to him, his wand out, casting a gentle cleaning spell on his face, his fingers tilting his chin up to assess the damage.
“It was just a matter of time,” Harry replies, calming down, taking Draco’s hand. “I’ve had the ring for ages, but I accidentally left it at home. I’ll ask you properly later, when I can actually kneel on the floor.”
Harry wonders if he’s said something wrong; if he should sneak out to the kitchens to fetch some food for Draco, but then all the messages disappear from the parchment, and he assumes Draco has put his away. He still writes a last message.
“You look handsome too,” he whispers, and Draco snorts inelegantly, taking a step back and pointing at his clothes.
“Wake me up,” Harry says, running his fingertips on Draco’s scars, then rubbing his thumb on soft pink lips. “When you can’t sleep because you’re anxious. Wake me up, and I’ll keep you company and help you get back to sleep.”
“Draco?”
“Hey, stop treating me like a slut!” Draco complains, leaning forward to pinch her arm and she hisses at him like an angry kitten, “you know that I haven’t slept with that many people.”
“So this has nothing to do with the fact that my son has suddenly sprouted wings, right?” she asks and Harry gapes at her.
’ in Italian?” he asks Manuela when Draco is busy pretending to cook and brewing his potions instead.
“Do you do this every day?” he asks and Malfoy’s smile freezes for a second, but then it gets even wider.
He looks heartbroken as he disappears through the door, leaving Harry breathless and feeling like he’s sinking, sinking, sinking.
Strangely enough, he manages to fall asleep again, thinking about panthers and a young lady with Malfoy’s fine features and white-blond hair, marrying a lad who looks like Neville.
“What a surprise,” Harry mutters, wishing Kingsley would leave, wanting to climb the stairs and check on Draco. He’s going to be anxious and upset. He’s going to be in pieces after finding out that his dad has escaped.
“Let me talk to him,” Draco says, his tone pleading. “Please, I know how to calm him down.”
“No,” Harry says, cleaning them both with a spell and then focusing his magic on his used hole. He sits up and shudders through the feeling of Draco’s come sliding out of him. He cleans and heals himself with a flick of his wand, and then relaxes on the bed next to Draco. “It’s okay. I really enjoyed it. It was out of this world, Draco.”
“I was just asking Draco when you were planning on getting married. The baby’s due soon.”
“Well, it didn’t feel like the right thing to do, Harry,” she says. “Draco came to see me straight away after he realised who Teddy was. He asked me not to tell anyone that he was a wizard, you see. My nephew is trying to rebuild his life in the Muggle world and doesn’t want any unnecessary attention from the press.”
“Fine!” he shouts, and Draco closes his eyes, knowing that he’s going to get kicked out, that he will have to find another place to stay, to beg for someone’s mercy. “Ron can be Malfoy’s probation officer. Happy now? I have to go back to work.”
“What time is it?” Harry groans.
Harry does as he’s asked, letting Draco’s praise slide over his skin like the most beautiful caress.
Harry grimaces, wishing he didn’t know some of the stuff he’s had to learn last year. Or the year before.
“Stop blabbering, Potter,” Draco huffs, pulling him closer, until their chests are pressed flush against each other. “I feel honoured, so stop trying to get out of it.”
“I finally managed to get your autograph,” she jokes. “Maybe one day I will get you to come to the pub with me after work.”
“Sod off,” Harry laughs, smacking his bum and dragging him closer, kissing him messily and laughing against his lips.
Harry stares at him, dumbfounded, and checks the car. It’s fairly old, but it has been cleaned and expanded with magic. The boot is already packed with several of Draco’s travelling trunks. There are even a few cauldrons and a couple of brooms.
“Oh,” is all that Harry can manage as a reply, looking around at the immense quantity of books that have probably belonged to Malfoy’s family for generations. It’s hard for him to understand this kind of thing, since he’s never really had anything of his own, but he expects this is causing a great deal of pain to the Malfoys. They’re a proud family, and Harry can only imagine how pissed off Malfoy is at the prospect of parting with his family’s heirlooms.
“It’s because Florence Bourne told everyone she heard you were looking for a girlfriend to spend Christmas with,” Neville explains.
“There’s nothing to tell,” Harry insists, opening his book and looking at Draco’s forlorn figure.
“Mother will be coming out soon,” he says, turning to meet Harry’s gaze again, “the wards must have warned her of your arrival.”
Malfoy sneers, but his eyes keep on following Harry’s hands, the deliberately careful movement of the knife, the way Harry confidently sprinkles some pepper and then chops the tomatoes while he lets the onions and bacon fry in the pan.
. There’s even a thermos full of Harry’s favourite chai tea with milk and plenty of sugar. “Okay, I officially love you.”
When they eventually part for air, Harry’s already hard, his erection pressing against Draco’s thigh. He looks down and he can see that Draco’s cock is stiff too and he wants to touch him so desperately.
“Keep it on,” Malfoy says, his eyes locking with his, an odd glint in them that Harry doesn’t know how to interpret. “Keep them. Consider it a present from me, since they are still mine to give.”
Draco feels a wave of emotions crashing over him, remembering the way Harry said he didn’t want to share him. The fact that he called him his boyfriend. And he feels his eyes burning, tears threatening to fall.
Harry laughs and kisses him again. And again.
Zabini arrives first, arching an eyebrow when he sees it’s just the two of them there.
“Me too,” Draco admits, his voice quivering, as if afraid of admitting it out loud and having it snatched away. He shivers, and Harry brings him closer, pulling up the blankets to cover them. “Time to sleep. It’s been a long day.”
“As Master pleases,” Kreacher replies. Harry sets off for the station.
Harry feels a pang in his heart at the thought of his Italian friend, at how much he misses her, even though it’s only been a couple of weeks since they left their house in Umbria. He wonders if the landlord has already found someone else to rent the property.
He shrugged and continued looking at him, waiting for an answer. Draco sighed.
“Can you not cast protective spells?” Harry asks, a little too desperately, but he’s interrupted by Hermione, who kneels on the floor in front of Parkinson and puts her hands on the other girl’s knees.
“Are you sure?” he asks. “It’s your family and I don’t think they would want me there.”
“Will you hold your legs up for me, love?” the blond asks, his voice soft and tender. “It would be easier to take you from behind, but I need to see you. I…I don’t want to hurt you, Harry.”
“Mr Potter,” Marelli says when Harry enters the classroom. “May I have a word?”
“Let’s give him his glasses back, Pansy,” Draco says, taking the specs from Parkinson’s hands and carefully placing them on Harry’s nose.
Harry falters when Draco uses his first name and they stare at each other for a few minutes.
He gets up, noticing Hermione’s feeble smile in his direction and Ron’s angry expression towards his mother, and then floos back home.
Professor Marelli looks pleasant, but deadly.
He doesn’t deserve Draco anyway.
The days turn into weeks and March nearly comes to an end, when Harry finally gathers enough courage to ask a question that has been nagging him for ages.
Draco’s breathing becomes more laboured, his face flushed.
“It can be difficult to cast a Patronus after going through trauma,” Marelli says, his voice soft, pity in his eyes. Harry feels like punching him. He doesn’t want anyone’s pity, especially not his. “It’s hard to think of a happy thought after going through a war.”
“I brewed it myself,” he replies, running his fingers along a cut as his magic seals it shut. “Slughorn checked it afterwards, so it’s safe for you.”
Harry waits for Draco to fall asleep before opening his eyes to stare at his peaceful face, lips slightly parted. Harry traces them gently with his thumb and wishes he could kiss Draco.
You can come and say hello on
Draco can’t find the words to answer; they’re all stuck in his throat with his heart.
They have breakfast before Malfoy suggests going for a quick fly in the estate.
It takes him less than two minutes to realise that he’s screwed. Pansy is in France, Blaise at Hogwarts and Greg in Azkaban. His mother has been lying in a catatonic state in the Janus Thickey Ward at St. Mungo's since his Father's death.
“Sweetheart, you most certainly cannot send an owl to Harry Potter.”
Harry doesn’t close his eyes; he leaves them open, at Draco’s mercy. He comes on a shuddered gasp, Draco’s fingers on him, his eyes keeping him pinned, making him feel safe and owned. He comes and comes, painting his belly with sticky white semen. Draco’s hands are covered in it, and he keeps on stroking himself after he lets go of Harry’s oversensitive cock.
But Draco looks like he isn’t and Harry
He muttered the simple spell, the one he had been practising since he was little, one of the first ones he had begged Mother to teach him.
“I love you,” Draco whispers, for the first time, “I love you so much, Harry.”
“Potter, are you for real? There is no
“Is Zabini coming back?” he asks, feeling the anxiety creep up his chest like a cold grip.
“Take me into your mouth,” Draco whispers, his fingers digging into Harry’s thick curls, tugging at them gently. “Slowly. Like that, good boy. Use your hand to stroke the base.
Harry chuckles and presses against him, pulling him closer for another searing kiss.
“You didn’t have to swap with Smith,” was Draco’s reply, “I don’t need your pity, Potter.”
“We don’t need that. I can cook,” Harry says on their way to the kitchen. “The Muggle way, I mean. But I can make some lunch.”
“No,” Draco replies, “but it was rather awkward and both Mother and I had our wands raised the whole time.”
“Yes,” Harry breathes out. “I really want to, Draco.
“I found something interesting,” Malfoy says when the Aurors finally leave in the late afternoon. “It belonged to my grandfather.”
“I’m afraid you will have to wait outside, Harry.”
His cock hasn’t been working well for the past year anyway. He can’t even wank without having horrible images creep into his mind, making him become soft and frustrated. He can’t even remember the last time he’s managed to have a satisfying wank, but it was probably when he was still back at Hogwarts, in the safety of his four-poster bed with a heavy silencing spell.
“You’re not…” Harry starts, but Draco shakes his head and averts his gaze, clearly wanting to put an end to their conversation. “Besides, I don’t deserve…”
"Where are you going?" Luna asks, amused.
“I’ll get it sorted,” Draco announces. “You go and get dressed. Kreacher is going to have a heart attack if his Master comes downstairs in a pair of boxers on Christmas day.”
There are a million questions swimming in his head, a million things he wants to ask and say, but he doesn’t know if he can. He doesn’t know how.
They get to the meeting and they’re only five minutes late. Draco stands next to Harry, looking unperturbed, his back stiff and mouth pursed as he listens to Robards talking them through the night raid and what needs to be done next. Harry wants to lean into Draco’s warm body, wrap him in his arms and just inhale his scent, when he suddenly feels him flinching and then letting out a small gasp. Draco’s lips wobble and his cheeks turn the loveliest shade of pink and Harry looks at the clock and remembers his spell. He casts a wandless and wordless cleaning charm on Draco’s backside and then tries to listen to Robards.
“I…we…” she bites on her bottom lip, “we haven’t been on our own
“I suppose I’m going to have to learn myself how to cook pretty soon,” he mutters gloomily.
charm. Harry starts opening the cupboards without permission, looking for tea and biscuits.
to his skin.
“I could get you off,” he replies, swallowing loudly. Merlin, his heart is beating so bloody fast.
He walked behind him, back to their rooms, wondering what was going to happen, if they were ever going to kiss again or if it had just been a one off. Harry opened the door and started getting the eggs and bacon for breakfast, fishing a couple of sausages, mushrooms and tomatoes from the fridge.
Harry pauses, parchment in hand, and frowns. He doesn’t remember Draco being sentenced to community service. But he didn’t recall the blocked wand either, so maybe he missed that part of his Trial.
“We can do it in the morning,” Harry says, letting Draco’s fingers trace invisible lines on his skin.
The bowl with the egg whites explodes, shooting shards of glass and egg all around Smith’s workstation. The Hufflepuff is bleeding, and most of the students huddle around him to help, the professor casting healing spells in a hurry. But Harry’s eyes are caught on the look of pure dread on Draco’s face, egg white trickling down his temples, covering his head. His hair looks darker under the slimy mess that is dripping down his face.
“Do you still feel like kissing me?” Draco asks after a few minutes.
“You said we were friends,” Draco reminds him, his voice small and hesitant.
“Don’t eat too much gelato, otherwise you will get a stomach ache,” Draco warns, but Harry tries to steal some of his instead, making Draco huff indignantly.
Harry lets the information sink into his tired brain and then laces their fingers together.
Harry wakes up, his eyes puffy and a bitter taste in his mouth. He fumbles for his glasses and realises it’s late, probably around noon. Draco is still curled up against him, his peaceful face resting on Harry’s shoulder, their legs intertwined.
“Is that what happened earlier?” Draco asks, his pale eyebrows knitting in concern. “Did you get flashbacks from the war?”
He wants the pain to end.
A startling noise outside of his compartment shook him out of his memories. The door opened and Luna Lovegood stood there, a dreamy smile on her face.
“I’m fine,” Harry says, transfiguring his watch into a chair and sighing in relief as he sits down. It’s a dark alley and he’s cast a disillusionment charm, so no one will see him.
to land on Harry. There’s rage and betrayal, a picture of heartbreak painted on his beautiful face. Draco turns on his heels and storms off, and Harry stands up to go after him, confused and lost.
“It does and it’s serious,” Pomfrey says, then she looks around her empty Hospital Wing and she sits on the bed, motioning for Harry to do the same. “Mr Potter, I have run a few tests and I can’t seem to find a medical reason which might have caused your ulcer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s actually more,” Harry admits when he emerges from the bathroom, biting his lips. Draco turns to stare at him, a lock of silky hair falling onto his face. “Come with me.”
“Welcome to the Slytherin Host Club,” Draco Malfoy announces with a charming smile on his pale face, swinging his arms open as his expensive robes billow magnificently around him. He’s not wearing their school uniform and Harry’s eyes open wide as they roam over tight green robes that hug Malfoy’s torso just the right way and then open above his waist. His trousers look so tight that Harry thinks they should be illegal.
Draco tells Potter at dinner, and the Gryffindor is speechless at first, then he says it’s excellent news, and that he’s happy for Draco, but his eyes look desperately sad.
“Potter, shut up. This is none of your business,” Malfoy says, his lips in a thin line.
Harry swallows and takes a deep breath.
“You’re really good at singing, you know?”
“Touch me,” Draco orders, gasping when Harry starts pumping his cock, trying to follow the same rhythm as Draco’s hand. “Fuck, that’s good. You’re always so good for me.”
“Don’t listen to that idiot,” Harry says, but Malfoy is already standing up and heading for the room he shares with Zabini.
“I don’t know,” Harry replies. “The reporters are just going to give me grief.”
“No, of course not!” she mutters, “I’m happy for you to be there. Besides…”
“Who cares about the robes,” Harry retorts, wondering what on earth is wrong with Zabini. Why did he not heal his friend’s wounds? Why did he not go straight to McGonagall? “Do you know who did it?”
They’re back in their flat. Harry realises he’s stopped breathing, so he tries to calm down. His fingers won’t stop shaking, so Draco takes them into his hands, stilling the fluttering nerves with a kiss.
He desperately wants him.
First things first though.
during his Trial. He clearly stated that Draco hadn’t wanted to join Voldemort, but he had been severely punished for refusing to and then had been forced by his father to take the Mark.  “How is that not barbaric?”
“Thanks for stopping by,” Harry says, leaning against the wall and watching Malfoy as he puts his shoes back on and prepares to leave.
If only Draco were here.
“What…?” the Gryffindor asks, confused.
Hermione looks at him for a second and then she hugs him.
Draco’s sweet tooth always amuses Harry; the blond constantly tries to pretend that it’s not a thing, that Harry is imagining it, even while he’s dipping his hand in the brown paper bag with a delighted expression on his beautiful face.
“Does it need to be something specific, or can I choose a design?” Harry asks, touching his chest, an idea forming in his head.
They go to Harry’s room, which now feels like
A Patronus Harry has never seen before appears in the kitchen, making him nearly drop the plate that he’s drying after dinner. Draco is using a Muggle pen to draw an intricate flower design on a pad, his sleeves rolled up, exposing the mark that he wants to cover with petals and blossoms.
“I’m not blaming anyone. I just wish I could be with you all the time, in the light of day.”
Harry wants to know more and he listens to Luna, his heart gently expanding and warming up, making space for Draco instead of Malfoy.
Harry wonders if he’s done something wrong, and he means to ask the following day, but they don’t share any lessons and when he finally gets to the Slytherin club, Draco is nowhere to be seen.
“Err, thanks Greg…” Harry manages to say, “that is very…touching?”
“Listen, Potter,” he said, raising an eyebrow at the Gryffindor.
“Oh, Potter…” he murmurs wistfully, making Harry frown and fidget, feeling under scrutiny.
He felt Harry’s fingers sliding through his hair, bringing him closer as their lips collided again, sparks of magic setting Draco’s skin alight. He sighed into Harry’s mouth, daring to put a hand on the other boy’s cheek, feeling the faint stubble and running his fingers on it. His own cheeks were smooth, nearly hairless. Harry broke the kiss to take off his glasses and then came back for more, deepening the kiss. He had one hand firmly in Draco’s hair and one circling his waist, like he had done the day before, bringing him closer, like the possessive lover that Draco suspected him to be.
And then it all happens too fast, Harry’s fingers disappearing inside Malfoy at a maddening pace, his hand pumping on his cock, and Malfoy giving himself one, two strokes before coming with a loud moan, covering the bedsheets in his come. Harry feels Malfoy’s walls clenching around him and he gasps at the feeling, as if Malfoy were trying to keep him inside. He feels owned, claimed. Suddenly he can’t take it anymore. Moving his fingers inside of Malfoy one more time, Harry follows him, calling Draco’s name when he comes, his eyes shut as he shudders through his orgasm.
“Fuck, Harry, I’m going to come,” he mumbles, letting out a needy sound.
“Oh, Saint Potter,” he teases, his voice low and promising. “Bless your innocent soul. You have no idea what kind of things can happen in a Dark Wizard’s bed.”
“Longbottom, as interesting as sex pollen is, I really need to go,” Draco says and Neville beams at Harry when he sees him.
“Fuck!” he croaks when he’s spent.
Ron doesn’t look convinced, and tears start running down his cheeks, but then he spots Harry. Ron quickly rubs his eyes, giving him a wobbly smile.
Harry still doesn’t do it. He practises the words in silence, or out loud when he’s alone. He asks Manuela to take him to town and chooses a ring for Draco. He comes home, feeling like a criminal with the little blue velvet box hidden in the pocket of his coat, burning a hole through him, and he hides it in his sock drawer.
“Fuck, like that,” Draco murmurs, “again.”
binding him there.
Harry whimpers, opening his eyes, finding the blond staring back at him, his plump bottom lip trapped between white teeth. Harry lets go, shuddering as he comes all over Malfoy’s pretty face, painting his scars and his pale eyelashes with white ropes of sticky come. He whimpers when he notices Malfoy’s pink lip darting out to lick the semen that has gathered on his parted lips.
They chatted for the rest of the lesson and Draco was surprised by the end that they hadn’t even attempted to kill each other.
Harry feels close way too soon, but he really can’t help it, overwhelmed by the fact that he’s inside the love of his life. So he starts stroking Draco’s neglected cock, making him curse and groan and then come in white spurts in Harry’s fist. All it takes afterwards is a couple of deep thrusts and Harry’s filling Draco with his come, so deep that he thinks he will get lost in the feeling. And it’s never-ending, shaking him to the core, until he collapses on top of Draco, kissing the top of his spine, murmuring embarrassing words against Draco’s skin.
“Harry…” he whimpers, shuddering in his arms as he collapses on top of Harry, trying to catch his breath. “Oh, darling. That was…”
Draco wiped away his tears with the sleeves of his bathrobe, feeling ashamed, and then they just sat there in silence for a few minutes, their eyes locked. And then Draco felt it, a gentle breeze, as Potter’s gaze wandered down his neck, to his chest, like a soft invisible touch casting aside the fabric of his bathrobe, opening it slowly. He looked down, seeing the belt around his waist loosening, the hems parting, baring his chest. Potter swallowed loudly, his Adam’s apple bobbing on his neck.
He’s a man now and a very attractive one, Harry has to admit. His hair is no longer slicked back, but it looks absolutely perfect, soft looking and parting at the side and still white-blonde. He’s wearing a dark blue tailored suit over a crisp white shirt and a light blue tie. He’s in good shape (excellent, actually) and as he approaches, Harry’s extra sensitive nose picks up a delicious smell. Like the sea when there’s high tide, like warm summer’s day, wild flowers and fresh lemonade.
Andromeda’s eyes open wide, and she freezes with Teddy in her arms and a bottle floating in mid-air.
…Potter…”
After his disastrous breakup with Ginny, he tried to find a partner - he really did (in spite of Hermione and Ron insisting otherwise), but it was not easy to date, especially if you were Harry Potter and everyone wanted a piece of you. Between the women and men who just tried to go out with him in order to end up on the front page of the
The little piece of china then unceremoniously drops the teaspoon, spreading sugar all over the table, and starts walking away.
“You’re allowed to love him and hate him at the same time,” he whispers. “It’s okay. But don’t worry about people taking it out on you or your mum. Andromeda is a fierce witch, and I’m sure she’ll make sure your mum is safe. I’ll come with you to community service. I’m not going to let that happen again.”
“Draco?” Aunt Andromeda is suddenly standing next to him, a polite smile on her face. “It’s about time you and I met, my dear.”
“Well…” Draco bites his bottom lip, “for better chances of getting pregnant, I need to basically have my bum up in the air for ten minutes after I’ve received your…sperm…”
He takes Draco to Sirius’s old room, opening the door slowly, waiting for his reaction. Draco inhales sharply when he sees the piles of boxes containing his family’s photos and documents, all the relics from a forgotten glory.
“Why did you take me in?” Draco asks, wondering if Potter had ulterior motives, or if it was all down to his hero complex.
“Stop saying embarrassing things,” Draco mutters, his fingers sliding through Harry’s messy curls, stroking his head gently.
“Sorry about the biscuits,” he mutters, scratching his neck. Malfoy doesn’t say anything and then he gracefully takes one from the packet and munches on it in silence. “How come you go by Black?”
Dead.
Harry looks around the room and his attention is immediately caught by a teddy bear on Malfoy’s unmade bed. He moves closer and picks it up. The brown fur has lost its original fluffiness, but the cuddly toy is still soft, and looks well-loved. Malfoy must have slept with it so many times when he was little. Harry gets lost in his thoughts for a bit, remembering his own childhood and that blue teddy he stole from the bin once, after Dudley had thrown it away. It was missing an eye, but it was still soft. Petunia took it away as soon as she realised what Harry had done.
“Pity?” Potter asked, “You think I did that out of pity?”
“How does your potion work?” Harry asks after a while, his fingertips tracing lazy patterns on Draco’s warm skin.
“I don’t know, but he’s the only chance I have to have a baby without getting married,” he replies. “I’m literally one Floo-appointment away from an arranged marriage, Harry.”
He reads it again and decides that it simply doesn’t feel like something Malfoy would write.
“With a dragon,” Harry confirms, making Draco laugh. “I’m not going to let them take you away.”
Harry tries to catch his breath when Draco lets go of his dick, a trace of his semen trickling down the blond’s lips. Harry can’t help but sink to his knees, too. He cups Draco’s warm cheek with his hand and brings their lips together, kissing Draco clean, feeling him shudder in his arms.
"You're back," she says.
“Don’t be ridic-“ started McGonagall, but she was interrupted by a raised hand.
“I can explain,” Harry mumbles, thinking of what Hermione would recommend doing. Probably just tell the truth and face Narcissa’s wrath.
Harry runs his fingers down Draco’s back, keeping his touch feather light, trying to be as tender as he can.
Harry’s not convinced though, and Ron rolls his eyes.
“I’m not sharing a room with that,” shouted Smith, affronted, pointing a finger at him. Draco rolled his eyes, whishing that he could say the feeling was mutual. Everyone knew that Zacharias Smith was an utter knob.
“Well...you certainly didn’t lie when you described it,” he comments before Kreacher appears with a loud crack, making them both jump.
“Maybe I should ask Percy. He might do it.”
The trainee stands up and tries to argue, but then seems to think otherwise when he notices Harry’s hand trembling as he clutches his wand so tight that his fingers turn white.
His body is shaken by a new wave of whimpers and gasps, and he wipes his nose again as Harry observes the tears dripping onto his shirt.
“Harry, I need you to sign this document for Robards,” she says, handing him parchment and quill. “I will also need the emergency Portkeys back.”
“Why me?” Harry asks his Slytherin partner. “It’s not like you even like me.”
He is going to spend the rest of his days hoping to hear that marvellous sound again, trying to make Harry laugh.
“I told you it was a terrible idea,” Draco whispers against his collarbone, kissing him gently and letting Harry stroke his back with featherlight touches.
“You like getting off with me,” Draco replies, his eyes wandering down, staring at the hands under the blankets with a hungry expression on his face. “It’s just because I
Harry opens his eyes, staring into the silver pool of sadness reflected in Draco’s. There’s a small glint there, something that looks like affection and desire. A need stronger than his own.
Draco couldn’t suppress a groan and he kissed and bit and sucked on Harry’s skin, until he was a whimpering mess and Draco’s fingers were stretching him, making him wet and ready for him.
Harry starts with the cupboard. He shows him a memory of lying in the dark when he was six, shivering under the thin blanket Petunia had given him, pointlessly counting sheep to try to fall asleep. He shows Draco memories of all the smuggled things he hid there over the years. Dudley’s discarded teddy, missing an eye and oozing out stuffing from a broken ear, but still so precious to Harry. A book on Italy Harry had stolen from the school library. Petunia’s broken teacup, hidden under the mattress, hoping against hope that she wouldn’t find it and punish him. Vernon’s old scarf, to keep him warm during the winter months.
“It’s a surprise, birthday boy,” he says and refuses to answer any of Harry’s questions.
“You have me,” Harry replies, and Draco finally locks gaze again with him. “I know it’s not much, and that I’ve never had anything that was truly mine, so I probably don’t get it.”
“Why do you always have to be right?” Ron groans, and he eventually gives up on the idea of dropping the subject.
“Draco…” Harry moans, shuddering through the pleasure.
“What happened?” Harry asks, casting a furtive look at Draco’s pale legs, his rolled-up trousers sitting just under his knees. There’s a silvery scar on Draco’s left calf and Harry wonders how it got there, how many people have hurt him and when it will end.
“That you’re going to hurt me,” he replies, his eyes moving away, staring into the distance.
Malfoy stares at him, looking at his t-shirt and scrunching up his nose.
“Yeah?” Harry spits. “Do you know anything about my childhood? Do you think it was easier to think of happy memories before the war? Do you reckon it was a walk in the park before?”
Draco nods and Harry grabs his wand before pulling out and then he casts a spell. Draco gasps as Harry’s magic fills his hole, plugging it close and leaving Harry’s come inside him.
Draco’s cheeks flush the prettiest shade of pink, and his hand reaches for Harry’s, fingers trembling as they squeeze his.
“Harry?”
He goes to Hermione’s for lunch on Sunday and luckily Ron is there too and he’s so loud and cheerful, that Harry manages to fade into the background, moving the food on the plate with his fork, hiding the meat under a lettuce leaf and hoping not to offend the Grangers with his lack of appetite.
“Have you had anything to eat?” Harry asks them, but they shake their heads. Draco avoids his gaze, but Harry notices how red and puffy his eyes look. “I’ll get you something.”
“It’s perfect,” Harry says when they part, “just perfect.”
Potter tells him about his day, then he asks Draco what he’s been up to.
“No!” Harry says, outraged. Hermione’s eyes light up and then she smiles knowingly at him.
Harry follows suit, since Zabini is nowhere in sight.
, and he feels a little closer to Malfoy for some weird reason.
“I want you to fuck me,” Draco says, his voice already sounding wrecked.
“Night, Potter,” she says. “Don’t be a twat to Draco.”
“What is it?” Harry asks, standing up and stretching. He needs to go for a run, to release some energy. He hates being stuck indoors all day.
“Will you?” Harry asks, his face lighting up with joy. Draco laughs and nods.
“Come on, Harry! We’re going to be late!”
(See the end of the chapter for
, Harry…”
Harry lets out a whimper as he feels Draco’s lips on his neck, sucking on a sensitive spot that makes him lose control and shudder in his arms.
The door opened again, someone panting, short breaths caught in their throat, the click of the lock and then the distinctive noise of knees hitting the floor.
He has received an official invitation to join the Aurors, in spite of not having completed his NEWTs, but he doesn’t know whether he should accept it or not. Being an Auror has always been his dream, but that feels like a lifetime ago, like a dream that belonged to another Harry and not his own.
Ron groans and hands Hermione a Galleon, making Harry glare at them.
He wants his own justice.
Harry tells himself he’s being an idiot for believing Draco would accept is offer.
He wants to ask Malfoy if he’s ever had sex with another bloke—how much he’s done—but he doesn’t think it’s any of his business, and he’s terrified Malfoy will ask him
Hozier, “Would that I”
“Strange, we’ve checked every single compartment!” a Hufflepuff said, shaking his head. They started leaving, but not before one of them threw a stinging hex at him and another one made his shoe laces disappear.
“I know,” Harry replies, sleep claiming him inexorably. “I like sleeping with you.”
The house is old. Very old.
“I’m good with my hands too,” Draco whispered, unbuttoning his own trousers and then moving to Harry’s jeans, feeling the rough fabric and the zip open under his trembling fingers. He felt Harry’s moan deep in his bones, the shudder that shook him as Draco’s fingers came in contact with his cock. They were both so hard that it was not going to take them long. And Draco couldn’t stop staring, at the stiff cock in his hand, so much darker and thicker than his own, precome glistening on its tip. He took them both into his hand and retrieved his wand from his back pocket to cast a lubricating spell, moaning at the delicious feeling of Harry’s cock sliding against his.
Harry reads out loud, his heart beating madly in his chest.
“How is George doing?” Harry asks Ron, remembering how broken George looked the last time he saw him in September.
He wakes up in the early morning to the sound of Malfoy screaming, sitting up in bed with frantic eyes and laboured breath.
Yet Italy was the one he liked the most. He used to look at the photos of the sculptures by Michelangelo, the utter perfection of Canova’s delicate figures that looked so soft, even though they were made out of cold marble. Botticelli’s Primavera, Caravaggio’s dark and powerful paintings, like a punch in the stomach. Artemisia Gentileschi’s Judith slaying Holofernes, the blood spilling from the severed head as the women held the man down, the desperation and sheer anger making Harry feel. He never thought he could spend his time thinking about a bloody painting, but he used to lie in the grass, hiding from Dudley, imagining the scenes behind those works of art. Who were the lovers in the kissing statue by Canova? What was David holding in his hand?
“Thanks for the tea,” Malfoy says with a small smile that disappears before Harry has a chance to commit it to memory. “And for the biscuits.”
“We needed to check that Narcissa and Draco were not plotting against the Ministry and were not part of Lucius’s escape plan,” the Minister replies through gritted teeth. “Both of them were completely unaware of the fact that Lucius could turn into a bird. He must have become an
Harry’s tongue goes past the tight ring of muscles and he groans as he fucks Draco’s tight little hole with it, making Draco curse and moan loudly. And then Harry conjures some lube and replaces his tongue with his slicked-up fingers, one at a time, working Draco open.
“Transfiguration,” Malfoy says, pointing at the tome between Harry’s legs.
“Did he also treat your wounds?” Harry asks, his jaw clenched. Draco nods, and someone clears their throat behind them.
“Gentlemen!” Marelli beams at them as he emerges from a classroom, making them both jump. “I’m so glad you’re back early. I wanted to have a word with you both. Cup of coffee in my office?”
Harry’s about to retort that he doesn’t speak a word of French, when he realises in horror that he doesn’t even have his wallet.
“That’s brilliant!” Harry says, beaming at his boyfriend, who finally removes his hands and smiles back at him. “When were you planning on telling me?”
“Nothing about you is wrong,” Draco finally says when Harry runs out of words. “Nothing about you is ugly, Harry. You’ve been through so much, my love. Years of abuse and neglect by the people who should have loved you and protected you. Years of fighting when you were still a child. All the people you’ve lost.” Draco’s voice is soft, his gaze warm as it lingers on Harry affectionately.
“Since Mr McMillan is absent today, due to an injury caused by a Fanged Geranium, you are an uneven number,” the professor declares towards the end of the lesson. “Mr Malfoy, I’m afraid you will have to practise with me.”
This was wrong.
“Have you got everything you need?” Harry asks, helping Teddy put his coat on.
Harry’s cock gets even harder than it already was and he takes a deep breath, breaching Draco with his middle finger and making him swear as he moves inside him.
Harry hasn’t told anyone that he isn’t crying. He hasn’t managed to shed a single tear since the Battle of Hogwarts. Merlin knows he’s tried, gathering the bad thoughts in his head, closing his eyes in the loneliness of his bedroom at Grimmauld Place. But nothing happened. No tears, just an infinite sadness, something indefinite eroding his heart, little by little.
“We skipped dinner yesterday evening and you need sustenance. I got some potions for the pain and more ointment from Madam Pomfrey.”
“What are we looking at?” Harry asks, pointing at the names and faces on the wall, and Draco lets his fingers slide over his father’s name.
This time he takes Harry from behind, on the old sofa with flowers and bees that seem to move under Harry as Draco pounds into him, making him see fireworks under his closed eyelids.
Draco takes his hand and guides him to the bed. He makes Harry sit down and then he slowly undresses him, starting from his shoes, peeling off his Gryffindor socks and then moving up to his trousers. It’s not the first time Draco has taken his clothes off, but he usually does it in a haste, with eager fingers. He’s slow and deliberate now, taking his time as he unravels Harry, like a precious present. Harry lets him do it, feeling his cheeks heating up under the attention and care, until warm lips press against his.
“Harry…” it’s barely a whisper, but both Narcissa and Harry turn towards the sound. “I’ll write.”
“Of course, I loved her,” Malfoy says, annoyed. “She was my grandmother.”
“Oh my god,” Harry says, covering his eyes, “don’t remind me of that! I’m pregnant.”
The following morning, he meets up with Hermione at her house and then they apparate to Diagon Alley. She does her best to disguise his appearance, hoping they will not be followed by a horde of reporters and fans. It goes fairly well, with only a few people eyeing him suspiciously. They meet up with Ron for lunch and it almost feels like the end of an era, with Harry and Hermione off to Hogwarts, bags full of books and school supplies, and Ron on a tight schedule because he needs to return to the shop soon.
“Oh,” Manuela replies, a smile making her face appear much younger. “It’s ‘
He turns and stares at the light filtering through the curtains, wondering if Draco is also awake, thinking about him. Wondering if he’s just a mere shag for the Slytherin. If he could ever be more, in spite of their past.
“I’m fine, thanks. Did you get McGonagall’s letter?”
He could easily erase them with a simple swipe of his fingers, letting his magic get rid of the evidence of the night’s passion, but he leaves them there instead.
He doesn’t say he wasn’t checking the potion because he was too busy looking at how pale Draco’s eyelashes are or how his pink lips look extremely kissable up close. He inhales his scent as the Slytherin leans closer to inspect his disastrous potion, and Harry closes his eyes. He focuses on the smell of parchment and books, of fresh soap and something Harry has come to know as simply Draco’s skin.
“I love you so much, Harry,” Draco whispers, his voice thick with tears, and he slowly leaves Harry’s mind, like the ebb and flow of the sea on the shore.
“I never apologised…” Potter started, but Draco shook his head.
Harry hears a soft noise and turns towards the door.
“I’m sorry I’m leaving you,” Ron whispers, his voice breaking as a single tear rolls down his cheeks. “I can always come back to help with the shop.”
“I’m so sorry, love.”
He was used to people staring nowadays, but he could have felt those green eyes on him in a crowd. He turned and Potter was there, a few feet away from him, surrounded by a protective wall of Weasleys, who were shielding him from all his admirers and the first years who had never seen him before, trying to catch a glimpse of the saviour of the Wizarding World.
Harry shrugs and sits down in front of him, steaming mug in hand, the warmth of the porcelain against his skin grounding him.
“You looked tired, so I let you sleep,” Malfoy replies, stirring and moving a strand of hair away from his face. “You can stay, if you want. I don’t mind.”
Harry is sore and tired, but he’s never been happier in his whole life.
Grimmauld Place is a surprise.
He says a wobbly
Ron grabs the quill and Harry swears he’s never seen him so keen in any of their lessons.
“You’re really selling this madness of yours,” Draco jokes, and then he finally caves in and kisses him. Harry giggles against his soft lips and Draco lets out an amused snort.
“What do you want me to do?” he asked after a while.
“It’s okay,” Hermione says gently, her arm circling his shoulders, bringing him closer. Her bushy hair tickles Harry’s face, but he still leans into her warmth and closes his eyes. “We’ve been through a War and we’ve survived. You can fall in love with whomever you want.”
The walk back to Hogwarts is pleasant in spite of the cold wind and Kingsley’s awkward silence. When they finally get inside, the Minister puts his big hand on Harry’s shoulder and looks him straight in the eyes.
Harry’s eyes opened wide, suddenly feeling completely awake, sitting up and staring at George. He was so calm and lucid about it, making Harry shudder with nerves and fear, shaking his head.
He Apparates to the storage room and reduces the boxes containing the photos to tiny little cubes. He takes the wireless, the trunks with the clothes, everything he can fit into the pouch.
“Let’s find an empty compartment,” Ron suggests as they all get on the train.
He’s had sex with Draco.
“Shall we go to my room?” a mere whisper, but Harry nods and follows him, his stomach in a knot.
Harry nods and tries not to think about the Dursleys.
“I caught you braiding his hair the other day, for Merlin’s sake. The only thing you don’t do is shag.”
He tries not to worry about it, but the thought makes him anxious and sad.
“I…” Harry clears his throat, “I’m pregnant.”
“I know we deserve it,” Malfoy finally whispers after a few minutes, “but it still doesn’t make it any easier.”
“What’s going on?” he asks, but Harry’s answer gets lost when Draco walks in, crossing the common room in long fast strides, ignoring him.
Comments and kudos make my day!
“Fuck,” Draco groans when Harry sinks into his tight heat with a shuddering gasp, trying not to move too soon, breathing through the overwhelming pleasure. Draco’s eyes lock with his and Harry smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You should see your hair, Potter,” Draco replies with a frown, looking embarrassed. His blond hair is dishevelled, and his cheeks are pink and so lovely. “I didn’t think your ridiculous mop could possibly get any messier, but you clearly like to prove me wrong.”
“Watching, mainly,” Draco replies, his eyes shutting and eyebrows creasing in pain while Harry mends his bones. “There’s one called McGregor who is a colossal twat. He laughs and makes things worse by encouraging people to come and see us. Greg nearly punched him and ended up spending the night in Azkaban last week.”
What if they stayed?
“Nagini,” Malfoy explains. “I can’t get the smell off the carpet no matter what I do. I’ve tried every single spell and your Auror friends must have done something too, because it’s less revolting than it used to be.”
Draco stared at the train, that ugly and noisy machine that he used to like. Salazar, it felt like a lifetime ago, when he used to enjoy going to Hogwarts, to learn new things, chat with his friends, mess with Potter and try to get him in trouble.
“You look exhausted,” he says softly. “You need to get some rest, Harry. Time to go to bed.”
“I know it was shit for you. I’m sorry,” he mumbles, feeling Draco’s chest pressed flush against him, long pale fingers sliding through his messy curls, tilting his head so that Draco can kiss him. It’s a tentative brush of lips against lips, but it leaves Harry desperate for more.
He wonders if it was when they both shared a look worth a thousand unspoken words and decided to leave the Auror forces. It had been such an awful day, and they were both tired and bruised and just bloody fed up with it all. With the way everyone was expecting them to fight, with the constant assumption that Harry was going to be a roaring success and Draco an utter failure. It had been such a relief to finally say, “Fuck it, I’m out!” to Robards and just pack up and leave.
When he enters the portrait hole, he finds the fire still on and Draco sitting on a sofa next to it, a book in his lap.
“This is probably not what you imagined,” Draco mumbles, his cheeks flushing, eyes avoiding Harry’s gaze. Harry cups his cheeks and forces him to look back.
“You’re really good at this, Draco,” Marelli murmurs with a smile, and Harry feels like hexing his fucking balls off.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, noticing the dark smudges under Draco’s eyes, his hollow cheeks, craving to run his fingers on his face and wipe the tiredness away. “Have you been eating enough?”
Harry walks and walks, his thoughts swirling around his head, finally settling as if tired of running around aimlessly. He can’t remember the last time he had the castle all to himself.
“What else?”
“But I want to,” Harry replies, his hands circling Draco’s waist, “I want to be your mate. I’ve never been anybody’s anything. I want to belong to you.”
“So?” Harry asks, crossing his arms in front of his chest, wondering why on earth he is here, of all places. He could be with Ron or Hermione. He could be with Neville or playing Quidditch. He could be anywhere, really.
Harry is terrified he’s going to fuck up again and end up with the wrong flavours—Merlin, he hates melon ice cream with a passion. But the woman smiles and moves towards the strawberry ice cream, and Harry feels so ridiculously relieved. He has just placed his very first order without Draco’s help. Harry turns to look at the blond, when the lady asks a question.
He’s cursed, destined to taint anything he touches. He doesn’t want to lose anyone else.
Harry’s heartbeat slows down, and his eyes meet grey irises. He’s known that gaze for so long. Those silver eyes have been staring at him across the Great Hall for years and years. They opened up wide in surprise when Harry split Malfoy open in that cursed bathroom. They looked so scared on top of the Tower before Dumbledore fell.
“Good evening and welcome back to Hogwarts,” McGonagall booms from the teacher’s table. “Please come in and take a seat. The tables are organised by year group. On the far-left side of the room there’s the first years, and on the right the small table is for the eighth years.”
Harry looks him in the eyes and smiles.
“One finger,” Malfoy says. Harry starts from his hair this time, feeling the silky strands under his digit, circling Malfoy’s ear and then finding the top of his spine, the hard circular bone. He traces the vertebrae, like steps that take him closer to the place he so craves to touch, until he’s there. Harry takes a deep breath as his fingertip finally comes in contact with the stretched rim, pulled taunt and slick with lube. Malfoy moans loudly, and Harry wants more, so much more.
“Such an adventurous life you lead, Potter,” Draco teases him, but little by little Potter starts telling him about his day. It feels a bit like prying the words out of him at the beginning, as if Potter weren’t used to talking about himself at all. But Draco’s been stuck on his own for so long that he’s desperate to chat, and to laugh, and to just listen to someone else talk, even if it’s Potter.
“Harry…” Draco’s voice is so low that Harry barely hears him over the loud drumming of his blood in his head. He pants and breathes through the discomfort, trying to adjust to the feeling of being breached. Then a warm hand slides down his back, reassuringly, stroking him until he remembers to breathe properly again. In through his nose, out through his mouth. Draco starts moving, slowly, and the pain gradually turns into pleasure.
“I brought it with me,” Harry confesses, fingers nervously messing up his unruly curls. “I thought…I figured you might want it. Since it belongs to you. That it could keep you company at night, when you have nightmares.”
“Salazar, you look hot,” Malfoy whispers, his grey eyes roaming across Harry’s body. Harry thinks Malfoy must be taking the piss, because his body is not a lovely thing to look at. There are small scars scattered on his chest and arms, a trail of dark hair going downwards from his navel. Malfoy’s gaze follows it as he bites at his lips. “Take those off, too.”
“Chloe,” Harry remembers her name, after the girl spent half of the summer trying to get him to go out with her. “How are you doing?”
Narcissa makes an outraged sound and starts pacing around the room, not noticing that her son is standing there, just a couple of feet away.
“I found a house,” Draco says much later, when they’re both lying in bed, exhausted, their stomachs full of pasta. “In a tiny village in the countryside.”
“Won’t I?” Harry asks, confused. “I was planning on taking a whole year off.”
“What about a cottage pie?”
Draco carefully unwraps it, suddenly all serious as he reveals a wooden box with intricate carvings on it that says nothing about the contents. Draco hums and then unlatches the box, opening it slowly.
“Okay,” he says, moving his book and making space in front of him on the table. “Teach me.”
They haven’t had sex since that day when Harry found out he was pregnant. The first trimester was bad enough, between the constant nausea and how exhausted he was feeling all the time. But now he feels better. Actually, he feels bloody horny all the time. He wants Draco so badly, but it’s not something they do. Not anymore.
“Wait, let me get this straight,” Harry says, “you want to get pregnant and have a baby to keep the Manor.”
“You’re like an octopus,” Draco complains, finally removing his clothes.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbles, watching him collect the box with the photos and leave. He sits there for a couple of minutes, his eyes closed, running his own fingers on his lips, wanting to imprint the feeling of Draco’s mouth on his own.
“What does the famous Harry Potter do on a Saturday afternoon? Save damsels in distress? Attend events in his honour?” The answer is
“I know,” Draco replies, a smile on his lips.
Harry can’t sleep, turning in bed with his eyes shut, trying to remember what Draco looked like in the few precious seconds he got to see him. Merlin, he was so breath-taking, so utterly beautiful. Harry’s never seen anyone looking like that in his whole life. He has seen Veela women before and he’s spent a lot of time with Fleur, but Draco…
by Johnny Flynn and this fic was born from me listening to it a million times. Enjoy!
Harry knows he won’t last, that seeing Draco so lost in pleasure is too much.
Comments and kudos make my day!
“Salty and bitter,” he repeats Malfoy’s words, relishing the way his pale cheeks flush. “Just like mine.”
“I did a bit of cleaning,” Draco confesses gruffly.
“You’re cheating,” Malfoy murmurs, sounding desperate. “A thumb is not a finger.”
“Yes,” he breathes out. “Sì! I want to marry you.”
Destination, Determination and Deliberation.
“It does?” Harry asks, surprised, and then it happens. Malfoy shifts underneath him, lifting his legs up and Harry feels the blond’s cock touching his arse. Like a promise of something to come.
“Inter-house fraternity and all that crap old McG keeps on going on about,” Zabini answers, his lips closing around a perfect green globe of fruit.
Draco’s about to reply with one of his sassy comments, but his brain stops functioning when Harry suddenly drops to his knees and starts working on his trousers, opening them with practised ease and then swallowing him whole before Draco can even formulate a thought.
“Oh fuck…”
“It’s just lube, not poison,” Malfoy comments with a smirk, and then he lets out a breathless moan as he starts stroking his hard cock slowly and languidly. “Come on, Potter. Get yours out.”
He wants to scream.
“Are you alright, mate?” Ron asks.
of Draco’s heart ground him, long hands sinking into his dark curls.
“Can we…” Harry whispers, moving closer, feeling the heart-wrenching need to touch Draco, to kiss him. Maybe if it’s just the two of them, only them, then maybe things will start making sense again. Maybe if Draco holds him, Harry won’t feel like he’s falling irretrievably apart. “Can we just touch for a minute? I just need…”
“This is important,” he replies, standing up and carrying Argo out of the Dining Hall and into a deserted classroom.
“We’re running late, you sap,” Draco replies, then changes his mind and chases Harry’s lips for another kiss. “The ferry won’t wait for us.”
Harry is left there standing in front of Draco, who is pointedly avoiding his eyes.
After lunch Harry goes to McGonagall’s office, but she’s not there. He studies some more and then at ten to four he goes down to Study Room 3. The door is slightly open and Parkinson’s shrill voice is so loud that Harry considers coming back later.
What if Harry’s friends find out?
“Professor, I think I can talk to—” Draco says, but Marelli seems to notice only then that the Slytherin is the only student that hasn’t escaped.
Gone.
“Merry Christmas, Mother,” he says, his voice wavering. “I miss you too, and I really hope to see you in the new year.”
Draco leaves him on the bed, blind and desperate for his warmth, and Harry hears a drawer being opened and the click of a key in a lock. Then Draco’s back, parchment rustling between his fingers.
“You’ve been…?”
His teddy on the pillow.
They're having sex on Harry's bed. Malfoy's on all fours, and Harry is taking his sweet time fucking him so slowly that the blonde is a whimpering mess, begging for some release.
about your holiday. I want every single sordid detail.”
“I want to do it!” he declares. “I’m going to help.”
Harry checks the Slytherin side of the table and notices Draco’s lean figure gracefully sitting down, Pansy and Blaise on either side of him. They exchange a quick glance, and Harry feels his cheeks warming up at the sight of those grey eyes on him.
“I thought you were a Gryffindor,” Malfoy says, and then he flicks his wand and the tea set disappears. He stands up to grab another book from the shelf, and Harry feels like the moment is lost. He has been a coward, when Malfoy was actually trying to offer something, though Merlin knows what. Harry knows he can’t trust the Slytherin, that it’s probably just a trap, but he’s desperate to find out what Malfoy wants from him.
“Yes?”
“Hey, it’s okay.” Draco takes his hand and guides him to the sofa. “It’s alright, love. I’m here.”
Well, he used to be busy…
“I want you again,” Harry says, unfastening his trousers, then moving on to Draco’s, hurriedly, as if they didn’t have all the time in the world.  Harry climbs off Draco’s lap and falls to his knees between his legs, relishing the feeling of seeing his lover part his legs even more, making space for him. He licks a long stripe from the root to the tip of Draco’s stiff cock, letting his tongue swirl around the head and licking the precome that has gathered there. “Tell me what to do.”
“What are you making for dinner?” Harry asks, checking the larder and noticing that it’s nearly empty. Malfoy avoids his gaze and busies himself with the washing up, making sure all the plates and cutlery are squeaky clean.
“Yes, but I need books on sex,” Harry whispers, hoping that his ears are not going to start fuming from the embarrassment. At least that seems to get Hermione’s attention.
“As if,” Draco eventually says, breaking the silence and letting go of his hand. “Let’s go get some food.”
and the room is suddenly so bright that Harry can see the faint freckles on Malfoy’s shoulders. “Come here.”
“It won’t change anything for you,” Draco eventually replies, his voice low and hesitant, “but I didn’t want you to feel bound to me, like you owe me something. It was my decision and I’m happy with it, but you shouldn’t be a Gryffindor about it.”
“It’s not, really,” Draco whispers, looking at Harry’s lips. “I have so many rituals and fixations that I feel stuck in my head. Like I can’t move. Like I’m a prisoner of my own brain.”
Draco places his hand again over the tattoo, tracing it with his fingertips, and it’s like a fire has suddenly come alive inside Harry’s body, spiking up the pleasure until it becomes nearly unbearable.
“Sometimes in the Slytherin common room it feels like you’re at the bottom of the ocean,” Malfoy comments, looking outside. His eyes are like rain clouds, red and puffy at the edges. “I wonder if we’ll be allowed back there.”
The fragrance of freshly baked bread and pastries fills Harry’s nostrils pleasantly, but the undertones of citrusy crispy tones pick his wolf’s interest. He quickly walks down the road and pushes the door of the bakery open, making the bell ring. And there he is, Draco Malfoy with a baguette under his armpit and an arched eyebrow as he stares back at him.
“I had no idea,” Draco murmurs, a broken whisper that makes Harry reach for his cheek. “I had no idea it would feel like this. Harry, it’s so…”
Ron frowns at him when he plops down next to him on a sofa, crossing his arms.
Potter lowered his gaze and then put the pasty he was holding on the seat, getting it all dirty. Draco felt like telling him that he had no manners, but he sensed the tension in Potter and he preferred shutting up for once and letting him answer his question.
When their eyes meet, Harry feels like a spark running through his veins. He thought it would be awkward to meet Malfoy again this morning, after what happened between them over the weekend, but Malfoy’s gaze carves a hole through him, claiming him in a way Harry still doesn’t understand.
“Now,” Harry says, feeling insatiable, sinking to his knees and fumbling with Draco’s trousers to get his cock out. He kisses the tip, then his tongue darts out, dipping inside the slit and making Draco groan.
Draco wouldn’t have exactly used these words to describe his life.
Bloody Harry Potter and his cockiness.
Harry stares at him for a few minutes, wondering how Draco’s books ended up in the lake. He takes his shoes off, lifts his trousers and joins him, flinching at the stabbing feeling of the freezing water on his skin.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Harry says, his voice loud and clear. His boyfriend’s eyes finally lock with his, and he looks so vulnerable that Harry feels like wrapping him in his arms. “Stop talking nonsense.”
He held his breath for a good minute. He counted up to ten. Then he swore under his breath as he felt his cheeks catching fire.
“Of all the blokes, why the ferret? Merlin’s saggy balls, Harry! Please tell me you haven’t had sex with him.”
“Will you calm down?” Draco asks, his eyes still glued to the fine porcelain. The teacups are different colours, all pastel with a matching dark edge and handle. “What do they do?”
“Magnificent,” Zabini claps when Harry finally finds the courage to come out, his cheeks on fire. “Give us a swirl, will you?”
He doesn’t want to tell Draco why it’s so important for him to go there, because he hasn’t told him anything about his childhood. Harry hasn’t even told Ron or Hermione, although he thinks they might suspect it. Harry doesn’t know how Draco will react; if he will be disgusted or angry, if he will decide that Harry is too damaged to continue loving him.
, or that he’s trying to salvage his reputation by exploiting your fame. It would just be a disaster. And imagine if the wizarding world found out that the precious Saviour fancies blokes!”
“Err…last summer? A couple of months at least,” he replies, scratching his neck and she looks like she might curse him.
He dreams, but it’s all a confusing bundle of feelings and faces, and he doesn’t remember much when he wakes up. Just flashes of the past and things his brain made up overnight. Petunia scolding him for dropping a plate. Ron grinning at him as he hangs upside down from a broom. Draco naked under him, his eyes so bright, panting out Harry’s name while he comes.
“What the fuck,” Draco groans, “how did you even do that?”
“Time to move on,” Draco announces the following day, packing their luggage with a quick swipe of his wand. They get in the car again and drive for a while. Harry is silent, but Draco tells him to open the glove compartment. There’s the familiar thermos full of warm tea and a small plastic bag with speculaas biscuits inside. Harry loves them, the spices of the tea blending perfectly with the sugary cinnamon and cardamom of the biscuits.
“You don’t have—“ he starts, but Draco’s finger covers his mouth.
“Hmm,” Draco mumbles, kissing him languidly, and Harry moans and shudders in his arms. Their kiss quickly becomes hot and messy as they start grinding against each other, the delicious friction making Harry groan as his fingers slide down, towards Draco’s arse, grabbing his buttocks and pulling him impossibly closer.
“Sorry, I’m late,” Draco apologises, placing a soothing hand on Harry’s back.
“It’s a bloke,” Harry adds, waiting for a reaction, but Ron’s smile doesn’t fade.
“Talk to Hermione and Weasley about this,” Draco says. “Go to the pub and get sloshed this evening, then sleep on it and you will see by tomorrow morni-”
“You feel amazing, all naked in my arms,” the blonde murmurs, his lips brushing against Harry’s. “Your skin is so soft. You’re so beautiful.”
“Is the bride ready for tomorrow?” Pansy asks, kissing Astoria’s cheek. “Show us what you’ve got, darling.”
January goes by in a flash, then February.
The Wizengamot had been lenient with him and his mother, sentencing them to house arrest for one year due to their willingness to cooperate. The Manor had also been repossessed as part of the reparations. But Lucius hadn’t been that lucky, and Harry feels like he was made an example with his life sentence in Azkaban. Still, Harry thinks that he thoroughly deserved it, and he is happy the man is behind bars.
“How come?”
“What happened?” Draco asks.
“And since both Draco and I have barely taken any holidays in the past six years,” Harry continues, crossing his arms in front of his chest (or trying to, at least, it’s hard with a bump the size of a space-ship), “Draco’s taking paternity leave too.”
“Yes, I was just wondering,” he clears his voice and shifts on the chair, “why did you not mention that Draco Malfoy was Teddy’s French teacher last year?”
“Potter, what the actual fuck-“ Malfoy hisses and then he gets interrupted by Teddy’s class teacher, who arrives and smiles at them both.
“Take your top off,” Malfoy suddenly orders, his voice husky, “that strange thing you’re wearing. I want to see you.”
, where I also post my drarry microfics.
“One less slave,” Harry mutters, swallowing the last bite of his sandwich in one go and regretting it instantly. He starts coughing, and Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him.
“Are you trying to imply that Draco might attack me, and I would need your help?” Harry asks, gobsmacked, trying to force down the fit of hysterical giggling that is suddenly threatening to escape from his mouth.
“When do I ever go back to my place?” he asks, his eyebrow arched. Harry still likes the certainty of knowing he will have Draco for the night. That he will stay and be warm and solid in a bed that feels too huge and lonely without him.
Hozier, “From Eden”
Draco’s eyebrows arch up in surprise, then he turns and points his wand at Harry’s neck, making Chloe flinch. He casts a healing spell to heal the bruise on Harry’s skin, making it disappear instantly. Harry rubs his neck and smiles at him.
“I also booked an appointment with a Mind-Healer,” Harry adds, his cheeks flushed. “I think I need some help.”
“Thanks,” he mutters, stepping back and finally taking a look at the room. There are sofas and low tables scattered around the place, with flowers in elegant vases at each corner of the room. Harry notices Gregory Goyle sitting on a flowery armchair with two thin knitting needles under his armpits and what looks suspiciously like a pink scarf in his lap. A first year Slytherin girl sits precariously on a chair next to him, looking attentively at the delicate movements of Goyle’s stubby fingers.
“Are you alright?” he still asks as they settle in for another reading session.
“Hey,” Harry says, handing him the bag he’s been clutching, “delivery for you.”
Malfoy gives him some lube, and Harry starts slowly stroking his own cock, wanting this to last, since he doesn’t know when he’ll have it again. He tries to take it all in, to memorise every corner of Malfoy’s body. The freckles on his shoulders, faint and lovely, the criss-cross of scars across his chest and nose, the blue veins under pale skin, like lost rivers Harry craves to trace with his fingertips.
“Good,” Harry replies, letting out a breath he didn’t realise he was holding.
“I’m sorry my brain is fucked up,” Draco mutters, but Harry pinches his side lightly, making him jump.
His stomach grumbles now, and he decides to go to the kitchen to have something to eat. He’s halfway through his second slice of toast with strawberry jam when Kreacher appears next to him.
“I’m not so sure I’m actually into ladies,” Harry blurts out, blushing like mad. “I…I think I might prefer blokes…”
“Do you mean that you miss getting off with me?” Draco asks, his palm nestled up in the curve of Harry’s collar bone, his fingers fluttering. “You said that you can’t do it on your own. It must be difficult.”
To be left alone.
“Harry,” Kingsley says, “I’m sorry to bother you, but we need to take Malfoy in for questioning.”
Sorry this chapter took absolute ages! I've been working on several Drarry fics because I signed up for a lot of events. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Draco’s name suddenly moves on the map, heading for the eighth-year common room. Zabini is in the library with Parkinson, so their room is free. Harry glances at his trunk before kneeling next to it, searching until he finds what he’s looking for. Clutching it to his chest, he grabs his invisibility cloak and sneaks out.
on himself and Ron groans.

“I’m fed up with staying inside,” Malfoy announces, looking at the window. “The weather’s nice for once. I’m having lunch in the gardens.”
“You wouldn’t buy it for yourself?” Harry asks, letting one of his hands slide down Draco’s back, enveloping him in a warm embrace, wanting him closer.
“Shall we have an early lunch and watch some telly?” Hermione says, tilting her head, and Harry nods, glad to be offered something normal to do. Lunch and tv sound lovely.
“You seem to know what you’re doing,” Malfoy says, his chin resting on the palm of his pale hand as he studies Harry. “Why do you dislike cooking?”
Again.
“I’ll be off then,” she says, nodding at the Minister and Disapparating with a loud crack.
“What?” Ron raises his voice, and Hermione looks around, other students curiously peeking in their directions. “But why? It’s the only time we can spend together and go on dates. We’ve been through a bloody war! And last summer was so awful. We deserve a chance to just go on dates and spend time together.”
“Harry…” Draco murmurs, looking lost and so beautiful. And all Harry wants is to feel Draco’s hands on him, to run his fingers through white-blond hair, to melt against his warmth. To be allowed to kiss him again.
is the fucked up one, and Draco is perfect. A perfect match for him.
“Malfoy, I don’t pity you. I think you’ve been punished enough,” started Potter, his eyes still fixed on Draco, “you’re under house arrest for the next two years. You can’t meet your mum in the meantime and you won’t be able to see your dad for at least 15 years. You can’t even leave the country.”
“You’ll have to catch me first,” Harry teases, and then he zooms past Draco and flies as fast as he can, past oak trees and blackberry bushes, over the hills and a field of wildflowers. He hoots and laughs when he sees Draco’s determined eyes, approaching faster, until they’re nearly touching.
“Draco, I don’t care what happened last year. I don’t care how many people you sent to the Hospital Wing. You need help now.”
“Mr Malfoy, I presume,” Professor Marelli says, his voice soft. “Let me sort out your wand.”
Harry finally starts relaxing, opening his eyes.
Harry smiles and he feels happy for the first time in months.
Harry pretends to fill in his report for five more minutes, listening to Draco tapping his foot on the floor and watching him as he bites on his impeccably manicured nails until Harry snaps.
Harry’s eyes open wide and his hand finds Draco’s straight away.
"Do I not get a goodnight kiss?" Harry hears himself ask. He meant it to come out as a joke, but it sounds more like a plea, needy and broken. Draco’s eyes open wide, focusing on Harry’s lips, then locking with hopeful green eyes. Harry thinks he’s royally fucked up again, that he needs to stand up and leave, but Draco catches his wrist and he moves impossibly closer.
“You and me?” Draco’s eyebrows go up, and he sneers, making Harry suddenly remember how beautiful his face looked when he laughed, back at the Manor, while looking at the tiny snakes dancing on his teacups. It feels like a million years have come and gone, while it was actually just a few days ago.
“Who are you going to take out for dinner?” Draco asks, avoiding his eyes. “Is the Weaslette still available?”
“Why do you even care?” Draco asked, trying to walk faster.
“I know! I’m not spying on him,” Harry replies, frowning, wishing people would believe him for once.
“Professor Sprout told me,” Neville replies. “I spent the summer at Hogwarts, helping out with the repair work, and Pomona is a real gossip. Plus, we’re working on a few projects together. She wants me to take over as a Herbology professor when she retires.”
“You’re such a disaster, Potter,” Draco mutters, burying his face in his hands. Harry reduces the distance between them and the feeling gets stronger, radiating in waves of affection and desire from Draco’s trembling body.
“I told you,” he said, shaking his head, “I’ve stopped reading them.”
His magic is sucked out of him, the sudden lack of it making him feel like an empty container. He feels the void eating him up from the inside, a scratchy feeling in his throat, like sandpaper all over his skin.
“Fuck, that feels amazing,” Harry says, his hands circling Draco’s waist, bringing him closer, until their chests are flush and Harry can feel their hard cocks pressing against each other through the thin fabric of their underwear. He inhales Draco’s scent and he feels light-headed with desire and pure want. “You smell so lovely.”
“I just fancied curry. How was your day?” Draco asks, putting away the groceries as Harry boils some water.
Malfoy looks at Harry, an inquisitive look on his face.
“I…” he didn’t even know what he was going to say. All he wanted was to have Potter closer, to feel his warm body against his.
He remembers the way Malfoy’s pale eyebrows creased when he was close to his orgasm, the way his breath was coming out in short puffs. The tiny needy sounds he made.
“I’m going to come all over you,” Draco promises, his voice husky and eyes dark. “You’re going to watch me come, Harry. I want your hands on my arse, like that, squeeze,
Draco wants to leave.
Malfoy,” she says angrily. “Right, Harry?”
, Draco!” he cries out, shutting his eyes as Draco pounds into him again and again. Harry falls apart, letting himself tip over the edge as he comes in long warm spurts all over himself, a low moan escaping his lips.
The renovations took longer than expected. They ended up fucking in every single room, getting to know each other’s bodies until they were well-practised at giving each other pleasure.
“Maybe Madam Pomfrey could give it to you at Hogwarts,” he says, trying to help. Draco looks at him with a broken smile on his pink lips and he takes his hand.
The next day he goes to the library, but he struggles to find books on the topic. He considers asking Madam Pince, but quickly decides against it. So he goes to the only person who knows the library like the pocket of her own robes.
“You asked Ron to kill you?” Harry could only imagine his best friend’s reaction, the pain it had probably caused.
“Did you seriously think coming back to Hogwarts was going to be a walk in the park?” the blond asks, voice low and charged with bitterness, and Harry’s eyes open wide, his grip on Draco’s wrist softening. He lets his thumb gently stroke the soft skin under his palm, tracing the blue veins and the taut tendons. “Were you expecting people to be happy to see me after what I’ve done? After the shit I put them through last year?”
bedroom.”
The following morning, he stares across the Great Hall, trying to catch a glimpse of white-blond hair.
Harry thinks about what to say. He circles Draco’s waist with his arm, pulling him closer, and he rests his head on the blond’s shoulder.
Harry does his best, but he’s crap at drawing things, and Draco is still confused. So he settles for transfiguring a discarded piece of parchment he finds on a nearby desk into a whisk. He shows Draco how to move his wrist to use it and promises to help him practise in class. Their Muggle Studies professor said they were going to pair up and start cooking soon, and Harry’s looking forward to it.
“What?” Harry asks.
“I keep fucking you and you’re still so deliciously tight,” Draco murmurs against his neck, moaning softly. “You feel amazing, Harry. You were meant to take my cock. So perfect…”
“Potter, you are a bottomless pit,” Malfoy comments, precariously perched on a stool as he examines some dusty tomes. “One may wonder if you’ve been starving most of your life.”
Harry clears his voice awkwardly, and both girls stare at him.
And Draco wants to stand up and go there, climb into Potter’s bed and kiss him hard and messy, but it’s all too much. Potter is moaning across the landing, calling Draco’s name, only a few feet away, begging with Draco’s name on his lips. And soon Draco is coming, coming,
He hears a faint noise and Draco turns, staring at the Manor, his white-blond eyebrows furrowed.
“I’m just worried they might decide to burn all the ones we haven’t managed to sort out,” Malfoy says, biting on his lower lip in a way that makes Harry desperately want to kiss him. “Maybe we should just check the titles and choose the ones that sound worth keeping.”
And then he thinks about Andromeda’s message. If she knew the Aurors were coming, it means they had been at her cottage first. Harry remembers Narcissa, the shadow of the woman that she used to be.
“What the actual fuck, Malfoy! You fell over and then a troll stepped on you?!” shouted Potter, “who did this to you?”
One of the photos grabs his attention, and Harry picks up the wooden frame to look at it from up close. Malfoy is probably three or four, and he’s laughing, his grey eyes slanted and tears at the corners. His hair is even lighter, nearly white, curling around his ears. His mother is kissing his cheek and tickling his sides playfully. They look so outrageously happy that Harry feels a pang in his heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry hasn’t even asked where they’re going next, so when he gets out of the car and sees the windmills his breath gets stuck in his throat.
“He’s making me practice wandless spells and defensive magic,” Draco explains when he notices the expression on Harry’s face. “I’m getting better at them. It’s so difficult, though.”
“Is that why you erased Page’s memory?” he asks, fidgeting with the peeled wallpaper, feeling the rough texture between his thumb and index finger. He wonders how on earth he’s going to fix it. If the house will be repairing itself, after all the intruders have left.
“I’m not a coward,” Harry exclaims, frowning, but Malfoy shakes his head.
They approach the school building and Teddy stands on tiptoes, searching for his friends. He’s so excited that his hair momentarily flashes bright pink and Harry stops in his tracks.
Draco never mentions the letter he sent on Harry’s birthday, the fact that he basically admitted to being attracted to him. But Harry wants to know more.
How stupidly happy Harry felt every time Draco gave him an unexpected present on random days of the week, just because he cared enough to make Harry feel special.
“Harry…” he murmurs, “are you sure you won’t regret it?”
“Draco, do you have any twine? I need to tie the meat,” he shouts.
He replies, unsure if this is a big joke. He still casts a silencing spell on his drawn curtains.
“Move!” Harry shouts, and the blond scoffs and shakes his head.
“Can I owl you my presents at least?” Ron asks, looking forlorn.
“God, Draco, you really had me worried for a minute. I thought it was something serious.”
an owl. I have to tell him in person.”
“Of course, I do,” Harry frowns, looking at him, “Draco, we’ve been together for a year. We practically live together. You’re here every night and we spend every weekend together. Merlin, we have a cat!”
Draco’s gaze lingers on him for a few seconds, but then his eyes crinkle at the corners as he smiles.
When Harry asks Draco which song he got on Saturday afternoon, hands roaming over his lean body to treat his cuts and bruises, Draco slides a hand through his curls.
“I think I found a way for you to repay your debt.”
He looks at Malfoy’s lap, covered in a large book on potions ingredients, and he wonders what his dick looks like. If it’s long and pale like the rest of him. Harry bets Malfoy can keep it up for girls without a problem. He wonders what it feels like to be fucked by someone like Malfoy. If he would make it hurt just because he’s Harry Potter.
“Does it matter?” he asks. “I like you.”
“Potter, you’ve lost the plot,” Draco mutters, a smile forming at the corner of his lips. Harry laughs and lowers himself, grabbing his glasses with one hand to prevent them from falling down and holding onto the broom with the other.
“Sometimes I could take the ones my cousin didn’t want any more or the ones he had broken.”
“How long have you been sitting there for, Potter?” he asked, looking in front of him, raising an eyebrow in defiance.
“I think that’s up to Harry,” Draco says tentatively. “And besides, I can take time off work too. And my mother can help as well.”
He buys new bedsheets, washes them and leaves them out to dry in the sun. Then he goes to the market and buys fresh fruit and veg, arranging them in bowls on the kitchen table and in the spacious fridge.
“Maybe he just wants to shag you,” Ron suggests. “You’ve become quite popular since you slayed that giant snake.”
Unfortunately, the Headmistress is nowhere to be seen in the morning at breakfast.
Harry swallows loudly, then his lips part on a shuddered gasp. He nods, unable to speak, and Draco kisses him softly, a mere brush of lips against lips, so tender that Harry’s heart feels like it’s about to shatter.
“These flowers look pretty,” he says instead, pointing at them, “what are they called?”
“Potter, you’re a disgrace,” Malfoy comments and he steps forward, giving a pound coin to the lady, who chuckles and winks at him.
They stare at each other, Harry’s anger rising like a poisonous snake slithering through his veins.
In the last week of October, just as Harry finishes packing his old school trunk with a lot of random clothes and what he thinks might be travel necessities, he hears the noise of a car pulling over in front of the house and an unfamiliar honk that makes him frown and open the door.
“Why?” the professor insists. “What made you lose it?”
“Good luck!” Hermione calls from her sofa, waving a knitting needle at him.
“You need to tell Draco that you’re in love with him, Harry,” Hermione says. Ron doesn’t bat an eyelid and Harry wonders if Hermione told him.
“I’ll have none of that shit in here,” Harry bellows, barely managing to keep his anger at bay. “Auror Malfoy is your superior and you will treat him with respect. You’re suspended until further notice, Petty.”
“I want…” Draco begins, moaning when Harry’s hand wraps around his hard cock, pumping slowly. Harry lets the foreskin slide over the head, then slowly back down, wiping the precome with his thumb. “I want you to take control this time. I want you to do what you like to me.”
“You know I can’t,” he whispered. He wanted to ask why on earth Harry thought it was fine to remind him, when all he was trying to do was forget, not think about how much he missed his family and his home and his own friends. Instead, he used his wand to clean the mess he had made on his essay.
“Yes,” Draco breathes out. “Of course, my darling.”
“Mhh,” Draco replies, kissing him. “We need to start thinking about names.”
“Your skin is so soft and so pale. You look like one of those marble statues. You have no scars left…” Potter whispered, “I’ve always wondered.”
All was well in the wizarding world.
“He was okay,” Harry reassures him. “Strangely cheerful.”
The darkening shadows of Draco’s desire blossom on his skin, making him look rumpled and used. Claimed.
“Okay,” he says, his voice feeble. He thinks that maybe if Draco sleeps in the other bedroom, just for tonight, Harry will have a chance to explain everything in the morning, and then they can sleep together. “I’m sure the room Kreacher has prepared for you is a million times better than mine anyway.”
Harry waits. He’s not patient, but Draco is a sight to behold, pink cheeks and wet lips, undone in his arms. He waits, until Draco casts a cleaning charm and moves off his lap. He waits until Draco falls between his legs, knees hitting the floor, the cloak still covering his head and the rest of his body. Harry’s breath hitches in his throat when he realises what Draco has in mind, and he shakes his head, momentarily at loss.
Harry notices how hurt Ron looks, and he regrets not telling him sooner.
“Alright, keep your secrets,” Hermione says, clearly dying to know more.
Harry shakes his head slowly, frowning, puzzled by how far from reality Malfoy’s comment is.
“Shut up and suck my cock,” Draco says, his voice already sounding wrecked. “You have no idea how many times I’ve fantasised about this.”
He can’t stop thinking about Draco’s face when he saw the front page of the
“This makes no fucking sense,” he mutters, but then Hermione sits down next to him, her hair a riotous mess and her cheeks red, eyes alive. Harry doesn’t even need to ask if her date with Ron went well.
“Please tell me the ferret hasn’t turned into a merman again!” Ron exclaims, spilling half of his beer all over the table as he turns to face Harry. “He kept on moaning for ages, saying that he still stank like fish.”
Harry suddenly feels like a dick for making fun of him, especially when he notices the way Malfoy’s brow creases, how his lips are stretched in a thin line. He should apologise, but he really doesn’t want to.
“Yes, but they look used and damaged now,” Draco says, grey eyes locking with green. Harry suddenly doesn’t know if they’re talking about books anymore.
“Look at the Slytherins,” Ron says later in the evening, pretending to do his homework, but reading a comic book instead. Hermione has clearly spotted the flashy colourful magazine peeking behind his Potions book but has decided not to say anything for some unknown reason. “What do you reckon they’re plotting?”
Harry chuckles and sucks him harder, hollowing his cheeks and letting Draco fuck his mouth until he comes with a low, muffled moan all over Harry’s face. The blond stares at him, cheeks red, then spreads the white semen with his fingers, dipping it inside Harry’s mouth, letting him suck on his digit.
“Nice room,” Harry eventually blurts out to break the uncomfortable silence. “Ours is a total mess.”
“It’s okay,” George said, turning and facing the ceiling. “I thought you might, since you’ve killed before. I asked Ron, and he didn’t want to do it either.”
They end up talking about other things.
“Shit, you feel a million times better than my dildo,” Draco confesses when Harry stops kissing him to catch his breath. “You’re so hard and so hot.”
Malfoy grabs his wand and disappears with a loud crack, leaving Harry there, feeling stupid. He ends up eating on his own, casting a preservation charm on Malfoy’s plate. He takes it to the library and puts it on the low table in front of the blond’s.
“Will you see Theo tonight?” Harry asks, interrupting him.
“Give him time,” Ron says, patting his back awkwardly. “That’s what Hermione always says. And she’s right most of the time.”
He tries to catch his breath, eyes locked with Draco, and he wants to say something. Confusing thoughts are circling around his brain and he feels a desperate need to get them out and unravel them.
It’s just Harry, weak and broken, who struggles to get through the first week of bloody school.
“That was…” Harry whispered, “wow…”
Harry nods and leaves. He spends the evening with Ron and his family, pretending to be happy while their tired faces smile at him, telling him to blow on his candles and make a wish.
Harry feels a shiver running down his spine. He wonders if he’s allowed to stay there only because he’s wearing posh expensive robes, if that’s the only thing that makes him beautiful and desirable. Is he just another piece in Malfoy’s collection of oddities? Harry doesn’t even feel like he belongs there, with those lovely and expensive objects. A broken thing like him surely belongs in the darkness, in a house like Grimmauld Place.
“Potter, you’re going to share a room with O’Mallen, near the kitchens,” she said pointing at a Ravenclaw boy who immediately smiled like Christmas had come early. Another fan of the Boy Who Lived. Potter looked like he was going to be sick. “Malfoy and Smith will share a room in the Astronomy Tower.”
“Draco?” he calls, but there’s no answer, so he takes his shoes off and climbs the stairs.
“Maybe I should return it and get you one of those grandma’s sets I spotted in the display.”
“I…” Harry swallows loudly and scratches the back of his neck. “I need to finish this essay by Monday, and I also need help with the Transfiguration homework.”
“No,” Harry says, shaking his head, “you’re not marrying a woman just to have a baby! Draco, what the fuck! You’re the gayest gay person I’ve ever met.”
“Because my magic’s gone haywire after the Battle and it could be dangerous. At least that’s what McGonagall thinks.”
The morning air is quite cold despite it being summer, so he grabs the green hoodie Molly has given him. It used to belong to Charlie, and it’s soft, worn with use, slightly too big for him. There’s a hole on the right cuff, and Harry likes pushing his thumb through it when he’s nervous.  Malfoy’s pink lips, open on a shuddered gasp as he came, pop into his mind as he walks to the local park, the hoodie pulled up and his fringe covering the scar on his forehead.
Harry doesn’t answer, but he kisses him on the lips. And Draco wishes he could read his mind.
“Can you even fall in love with a Slytherin?” Ron argues, and both Neville and Harry just stare at him, speechless.
“Draco…” he says again, eyes locking with silver pools of lust.
After the meeting, they head for their small office and sit down to plan the next raid, which is supposed to take place in the afternoon.
Their first DADA lesson of the year is a double, and Harry feels a little bit calmer by the time he heads for the classroom. He’s the first one there, and the professor gestures for him to come in.
“You…” he mutters, a sob shaking him. “You had them?”
under his breath.
After a moment that feels like forever, Harry takes it out and spreads some of the saliva on Malfoy’s bottom lip, making it wet and shiny. Perfectly kissable.
“We have Muggle Studies first period,” Hermione reminds them. “Remember what we discussed. We pair up with the Slytherins and offer our support.”
, where I also post my drarry microfics.
“I died,” Harry croaks out. “His soul…it was inside me…”
“Merlin, you’re so beautiful,” he confesses, his voice a shuddered breath.
“Maybe,” Harry says, wishing he could help.
It’s a chaste kiss, so distant from what Harry has always imagined their first kiss to be like, but it’s tender and surprisingly familiar. Harry’s lips gently press against Draco’s soft ones, making him gasp and then his fingers slide through Draco’s damp hair, going for the ribbon that is keeping it tight in a loose braid and unfastening it. Harry cards his fingers through soft blond hair, making Draco moan against his mouth, opening his lips and allowing Harry to deepen the kiss. And then it’s like he’s always thought it would be to kiss Draco and a million times better at the same time. The taste of Draco’s lips, his tongue licking into Harry’s mouth, the desperate sound coming from Harry’s throat, Draco’s hands clutching at the front of his t-shirt, dragging him closer.
