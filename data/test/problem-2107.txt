Their chastity devices were removed, then Ted conjured two hard wooden chairs side by side and had each of the subs sit in them. Their legs were splayed open and ankles bound to the legs of the chairs, while their hands were bound behind their backs. Draco's cock was jutting north and Amy's pussy was shiny and wet with her own natural lubricant.
"Are you sorry yet?" Harry asked kneeling in front of Draco and mouthing his dick and balls through the felt of the belt. Everytime Draco would try to thrust, Harry would pull off and spank him right across the ass.
Draco cried into the pillow, "Sometimes it just feels good to break the rules."
You look like a total tramp, and you're grateful that you're in a neighborhood far from where anyone you know in your weekday life could be. When the doorbell rings, you totter over there on the high heels and answer the door. The man delivering the Thai food is short and his face is immediately in front of your breasts. He goggles at them and you know what your Masters want you to do. You giggle in a high pitched voiced, purposely jiggling the mounds that the delivery man is salivating over. "Thank you so much for the food. We're very hungry here."
"Oh, pet," Harry said. He leaned over and stroked Draco's hair. "I know it's scary for you, submitting that much and allowing strangers to have dominance over you. But I want you to always remember your safe word. No one is going to get mad at you for using it, and we want you to use it if you need to."
Draco's mouth wobbled a bit, "Yes sir." He licked around his lips, tasting the come still cooling on his face.
"Yes Master Draco," You say. You get up as they leave and you go to the bathroom. You look at your face in the mirror. You love the way you look with a facefull of come. It makes you horny and you realize that you could quickly rub your clit and come without either of the Masters knowing it. It's so tempting and you feel the itch in your hand and in your vagina, but you decide to be a good submissive and wash your face, pee and brush your teeth.
Draco moaned again and it was all Harry could take before he orgasmed heavily into his husband's mouth, filling it with thick salty bitter semen.
"Does this feel good?" Harry asked, letting number eleven smack Draco across the ass.
The last two times Blaise had been in town, however, he, Draco and Harry had had a threesome, which was something Harry never would have expected of himself. He never would have imagined he'd be lying on a bed with Draco Malfoy inside him, while Blaise was behind Draco getting him from behind. He never would have imagined that he and his husband would be kneeling slavishly in front of Blaise sucking his cock and licking his balls until he came all over their faces.
Draco raised his head proudly and nodded, "Yes Sir. Whatever you think is best."
"Oh fuck yes," Ted said enthusiastically, pulling his underwear off without another thought. Harry followed suit and then he and Ted kissed passionately, falling to the floor in a mass of limbs and hard cocks. They were frantically tugging at each other, frotting and breathing hard. And then just like that there was a circle of subs and in the middle, all of the doms in the room fucking. "No jerking off," one Dom said to his sub as he was kneeling and fucking a woman with extremely large breasts.
You are proud that you make it through the entire day on Sunday remembering to call you Masters by their preferred titles. You sure aren't looking for a rice-kneeling repeat. The Masters don't play with ice today, but they do bring you to the edge a few times. They use their fingers to massage your clit, they find your G-spot on the front wall of your vagina, they massage your breasts and lick quick stripes between your labia. Once you get close to orgasm, they make you lie down with your legs open until it passes. Then they do it all again. They do this four times over and by the fourth time where you are lying on the floor with your legs spread, you are shaking so hard because your need to come is that great. You genuinely don't think you can do this and your burst into tears.
"You mind if I take a turn?"
It's still a little dark out as you two tiptoe down the stairs, stopping to use the toilet. Ronald pulls an apron on over his naked frame. "I'm a really good baker," he explains. "Harry and Draco love for me to make homemade bread whenever I'm here." That explains why it was so early.
"I'm adding another one for that attitude."
"My Masters, Ma'am," You answer.
"O-OK," Draco said. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, relaxing his whole body. Harry and Blaise would never have been the wiser that Draco was currently urinating, there was no outside indication. Draco opened his eyes, "It worked!"
"You're not buying it, and that's final."
You can't see the entrance from your vantage point, but you can hear the Masters greet Hermione. Hermione has a brusque but feminine voice and she thanks the Masters for taking over Dom duties for Ronald this weekend. "Work is simply insane right now," she complains. "I know he's OK at home by himself, but too much time alone isn't good for a little sub is it now?"
Ted wrote out the letter to Madame Kat detailing what Draco and Amy had done, and sent it off by owl.
"Happy to oblige." Harry looked down at Ted. Even though the male sub had just sucked him off, Ted's cock was already hard. Draco did have that effect on people.
"A budget I can live with. And Harry, I need this cream. It's got only the finest ingredients, including ground unicorn horn."
"Thanks you Master Draco," You say. "Thank you both for that pounding."
"That's better," Harry said. "I'm off to work."
You watch as Ronald's diaper gets fuller and yours gets fuller at the same time. You both drank so much water the piss just keeps coming and the diaper cant' contain it and starts leaking out the bottom and onto the floor. Even Ronald's diaper is too soggy to hold any more and his pee starts leaking as well. Your Masters and Hermione think it is delightful and scream with laughter as piss drips from the bottom of your diapers, down your legs and onto the floor. Finally you stop, but the damage is done and the diaper is wetter than you ever thought possible. It hangs from your crotch in a soggy mess and you must keep your legs spread.
"Wait," Harry said. He pointed his wand at Draco and used a sobering spell on him. "Draco can't agree to this when he's drunk." You could see the sobering effect in Draco's face. His eyes became focused and his posture straighter.
Draco smiled, "Thanks."
"Very well."
Finally he's done and wow, does your backside STING! You weren't sure Master Harry would have it in him, but he sure does!
The Dom raised his hand and slapped Draco across the face, "You shouldn't be so fucking happy about it. Being a dirty little slut is a bad thing."
You stand and look at both of them. "This weekend is all about your punishment for fucking Ronald last weekend," he continued. "We're going to lay down some ground rules."
Ronald hovers over you and sets the tip of his dick at your entrance, "I have trouble getting all the way in most girls," he explains.
"Yes Harry," Draco said.
"I WILL give him five spanks!" Draco repeated. He stepped over to Harry and raised a shaking hand. He held it in the air momentarily before bringing it down over Harry's presented backside.
"There are a list of rules," Harry said quietly. "And right now you're breaking several of them." He grabbed Draco by the arm and pulled him over to where their rules were hanging in the kitchen. "Read off rule number five," he demanded.
"Do you deserve this?" Harry asked, as his hand landed across Draco's now-pink ass.
You moan and frown, earning a smack across the tits from Harry. You bite your lip to keep quiet. "You'll wear this," Draco said "and in the morning when you have to piss we expect you to use it."
"Go back to the living room," Harry said. "And stand in the corner until I come get you. I want you to think about everything that has happened here."
WEEKEND THREE
Draco nodded, his breath still uneven as he struggled to stop his crying.
Everyone's jaws dropped as they stared with their eyes blown at Hannah. "Oh come on! Have you people never played this before? You do know that you might have to have penetrative sex in front of the group right? You don't call it extreme for nothing."
Ginny stared as Malfoy and Harry snogged, as they ravished each other's mouths with nothing short of love and passion. She wanted to scream out of pure shock, but no sound came out of her mouth. Her vocal cords were failing her every passing minute, so she settled on nodding at Ron who screeched, "Bloody hell!"
"I'm so lucky to have you," Draco said softly, his voice barely a mere whisper, "You're so wonderful, asking you out was the best decision I've ever made in my entire life." Harry smiled widely at him before throwing his arm around Draco's neck to pull him closer and kissing him softly. Unlike their lust filled hungry kisses earlier, this one was sweet and soft, yet no less passionate.
thick ropes of come spilling onto the green bedding. Harry collapsed onto the mattress, his adrenaline receding, Draco too fell on top of him not having the energy to stay upright anymore.
Harry moaned wantonly, "Draco stop!" Draco smiled unapologetically. "Now now kitten, wouldn't want you to come too soon."
This led to Draco giving her his best scowl and prying his arm away from her grasp. "Yeah, totally! I'll see him and his pathetic girlfriend sprawled over each other on the floor," he growled, "Oh and for good measure, why don't you dare them to kiss again, Pansy? Surely I would definitely want to see that again."
Padma got the first dare after Lavender who had her turn before had picked truth. "Okay Padma, let's see," Hannah said, "As Parkinson said, this is the extreme version so...I dare you to give Nott a blow job."
"All you needed to do was ask." With that, he pulled the plug out of Harry's hole, it was about 10 inches long and quite thick, but not as thick as Draco.
Ron grimaced a bit. "That's alright Harry, I'm sure you'll tell us when you're ready." He patted Harry's back and offered a small smile, but Harry could hear the pain in his voice. He knew his friends didn't believe him. Even though he was telling the truth! He really didn't have a girlfriend.
His response was met with cheering and whistling whilst Ron tried his best to avert Harry's gaze. Ginny chuckled and kissed him lightly, Seamus and Zacharias high fiving each other and whistling. And Draco Malfoy was glowering even harder than last week. Harry didn't understand, what was the git's problem? Was he jealous of Ginny? No, that can't be it, Malfoy disliked the Weasleys with effort. So what could it be? Maybe he hated seeing Harry happy, although Harry doubted he was too happy when he lost his virginity. He had expected it to feel mindblowing, and instead, it was quite a letdown. He had finished and so had Ginny, and Harry had blamed it on inexperience during their first time. However, things didn't get much better for Harry since then. Ginny loved it, so they had sex quite regularly, but Harry couldn't help but feel lost whenever they made love. He couldn't help but imagine what it felt like for Ginny, to be on the receiving end of things, to have someone pound into you from behind. Harry knew something was wrong the second he came with the vision of Malfoy's face centimeters above his. Speaking of Malfoy, Parkinson was holding on to his wrist, anchoring him to the floor and preventing him from leaving. He couldn't make out what Malfoy was saying due to the still ongoing cheering but from the looks of it, he was having a fit.
Draco gasped in shock, within mere seconds all the Gryffindors and Slytherins along with Snape had gathered around them and were ogling Potter and his new features. Some of the girls squealed, cooing at Harry, most of the Slytherin boys laughed whilst the Gryffindors were frozen in shock, staring with wide eyes.
He squeezed Harry's hips to reassure him. "Lube," Draco explained. Leave it to Harry to get too impatient to have a cock in his arse.
"Ahhhh Draco stop! I'm too tired to get hard again," Harry whined. Draco laughed, "All right love, I'm sorry," he said not sounding apologetic at all. "On a more serious note," Draco continued taking a deep breath, "I do wish I hadn't been so awful to you and your friends in the past, Granger's not too bad and neither is Weasley. I know I've apologized to you before, and I won't have a problem apologizing to them either if they'll accept it that is."
Most of the girls started cheering and applauding whilst the boys opted to staring at a very interesting spot on the floor, with the exceptions of Terry, Justin and Blaise who were all grinning lopsidedly.
Ron screamed, "NO NO NO I cannot believe I'm seeing Harry and Malfoy naked! AHHHH My eyes! My eyes!"
"But he's unconscious!" Draco argued. "Well, that is your problem, not mine." Came Snape's snarky response with an added, "Or else you'd prefer me calling your mother to let her know your potions grade this weekend."
"Don't worry mate," Ron told him, "It'll only last a week."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry groaned but knew better than to argue with her. Just then arrived Ron, pulled by the ear by Lavender. Hermione looked delighted to see him. "There you are Ron! I was wondering if I'd have to fetch you myself."
Ron and Hermione looked at each other, Hermione finally decided to sit next to him on the bed and tell him the news. "Harry, what do you last remember?"
"Harder, Dray! Faster! Please!" Harry babbled on and on, Draco was only happy to comply. Draco reached around Harry, stroking Harry's cock and jerking him off in time with his thrusts. Draco was doing his best not to come, he wanted Harry to come first but once Harry moaned screaming, "Come inside me! Come in me, please!" Draco lost it, coming deep inside Harry's arse, filling Harry up with his load.
"Dean! We've already talked about this!" Harry sighed. "What in Merlin's name makes you think that I have a girlfriend?"
Pansy opted for ignoring him and skipping ahead, paying no attention to Draco's desperate cries trailing behind her.
Harry nodded slowly and grasped the glass bottle settled in the middle of the circle and spun it. It landed on Justin Finch-Fletchley, who was openly gay and proud of it. Harry smirked, it was time to amp up the game.
Harry could feel the blood rise to his cheeks as the answer was forced out of him. "Yes, alright yes we've...we've had sex." He mumbled out.
"I hope you know I'll never lie to you. There are some things I want to tell you, Hermione, Ginny and all of you guys," he said gesturing around the room. "And I will, once I'm ready. I just need some more time. But trust me, I do not have a girlfriend."
Meanwhile Ginny and Ron had crept their way into the eighth year Gryffindor boys dorm room to get Harry's invisibility cloak. Ginny knew well enough that she wasn't allowed there, and was praying that everyone would be at dinner. Everyone except for Harry that is.
Harry moaned wantonly to the words coming out of Draco's mouth. Somehow one of Draco's hands found it's way up Harry's shirt, running along the smooth skin of Harry's flank, whilst the other was shoved down Harry's pants and was groping the now bare skin of Harry's arse. Harry continued to moan as Draco's fingers rubbed along his crack and caught onto the rim of his hole. Draco wordlessly cast a lubricating charm and eased his finger inside Harry's hole. Harry cried out as the finger grazed his sensitive walls. Draco continued to crook his finger, changing the angle and proding Harry's arse until Harry moaned even louder.
Ron rolled his eyes, "Oh shut up, what the bloody hell is this about?"
Draco hummed kissing the back of Harry's cute ears. Looking down he found that it was the fur of Harry's tail that had been tickling his crotch.
"Oh shut up, Potter! I didn't dare you to suck him off, you just have to sit on his lap!" Nott said frustratingly.
Once again her reply was met with a lot of whistling and quite a few catcalls. "Okay, okay! Let's continue!"
Draco huffed indignantly, "Shut up you cow!" he called whilst combing the rest of an expensive hair styling potion through his hair. "Just give me a minute. It's because of you that I have to deal with blasphemous Griffindorks every Friday night."
Hermione had started to try waking up Harry. "Harry come on, wake up," she said repeatedly shaking him.
"Draco it's your turn, and you have to do a dare," Zabini explained. "I'm sure none of you had noticed but over the last couple of dares, things have gotten quite berserk. Potter here missed the opportunity to see Lovegood get fucked by Longbottom for example."
Harry shook his head and addressed Dean. "Umm yes, Dean?"
Ginny and Ron had just witnessed a black plug being pulled from Harry's arsehole. Ron thought he was actually going to be sick.
"You need to get bred Potter, get fucked," Malfoy said slowly.
Draco smirked, "Prostate," he replied. Draco added another finger, putting more pressure against Harry's prostate making Harry whimper in pleasure.
Just as Ron was about to join a conversation about Quidditch with Seamus and Lavender, Ginny came running up to him, clearly out of breath.
Harry was sure his eyes were about to fall out of his sockets. "Don't worry golden boy, it was very awkward. No one came and Longbottom here couldn't even get more than half in the hole. Honestly, I feel bad for Lovegood."
Surely so, Harry nuzzled his face further into Draco's chest.
The eighth years had their own common room with each house getting their own dorm room, divided into the girls' rooms and boys'. Harry, however, to the shock of Ginny and Ron wasn't walking towards the stairway that would lead down to the common room which branched out into two stairways leading to the boys' and girls' dorms. Instead, he was walking along the corridor towards the Slytherin dorm rooms. Harry checked the hallway both left and right, as if he was on a top-secret mission, before opening the door and walking in. The brother and sister duo under the cloak swiftly managed to make it past the door threshold before it slammed shut. Ginny cast a silencio around them so that they wouldn't have to consciously try to keep their breathing to a minimum.
Standing at the entrance to the common room was half of the seventh and eighth-year students, their eyes so wide and about to fall out of their skulls. They were frozen in place, none of them moving out of shock. Harry recognized Ron, Hermione and oh God no, Ginny closest to him, all three of them getting a front ticket view. All their jaws had dropped open and they seemed to be suffering severe damage to their central nervous system. Harry would have been concerned for them, if not for the current circumstances.
A week later, Ron has had about enough. Turns out Ginny has too.
"Miss me?" Harry asked nonchalantly but grinning all the same. "Hmm," Draco murmured still nipping at Harry's neck, "I missed your arse," Draco drawled grinding his hardening prick against Harry's arse.
Harry turned his head to look over at Draco. With the moonlight hitting his cheekbones and illuminating his face, Harry thought that he had never looked more beautiful. "I love you too Draco," Harry reciprocated, "I want to be with you too."
"The way you said it," Harry giggled, "'My name is Draco Potter'"
Harry was moaning so loudly, he barely registered Zabini calling out Draco's name. "Draco! DRACO! It's your turn, Merlin!" Blaise yelled exasperated.
As though things couldn't get even worse, Harry's face scrunched up in fear as he heard the high pitched voice of Professor McGonagall as she made her way through the crowd.
"Hermione! I know Harry's seeing someone, haven't you noticed the way he's been daydreaming in Transfiguration? He's lucky McGonagall didn't give him detention for spacing out for the tenth time this week. Oh and don't tell me you didn't see the look on Snape's face!"
Ron just stared, flabbergasted, his eyes darting back and forth between the both of them.
Without warning, Draco flipped them over and withdrew from Harry. Harry started whining at the loss when Draco said, "Turn around for me, love."
Ginny knew better though. Clearly whoever she was, she was making him undoubtedly happy, in a way she hadn't in a very long time. Although to be honest, realization dawned on her that Harry had never really felt that way about her.
Ron was a whole different story altogether, he was cowering in shock at seeing both Malfoy and Harry's pricks. Yet he couldn't look away, his eyes glued to them.
"Need you...." Harry babbled, not knowing what else to say, "I can't take it anymore. Need you inside me, fuck me please!"
Both Draco and Harry whipped their heads around so quickly they must have pulled a muscle in their necks.
Harry was sniffling and he couldn't think straight and he knew he was burning up. He found himself cowering on the floor of the common room after having fled from dinner. He remembered feeling itchy all over and an uncomfortable wetness gathering in his underwear. His cock started getting hard to the point to which it was painful. After a quick excuse to Ron and Hermione about using the bathroom, Harry had run from the entrance hall, not knowing where his feet would carry him.
"How are you, love?" Draco asked him ruffling his unruly hair. "I'm doing great, thank you," Harry grinned. "My thoughtful and ever loving boyfriend had sent me expensive chocolates this afternoon. I decided that instead of owling him to say my thanks, I would do it in person instead."
"Potions accident," Draco told her, "Animagus potion, but it wasn't completed, we had yet to add the rat's blood."
Harry spread his legs as Draco settled between them, pinning his hands into the mattress and snogging Harry thoroughly. Draco palmed Harry's cock, his strong fingers wrapping around Harry's rapidly hardening cock. He starting to jerk Harry off his hand moving up and down Harry's cock in a blur.
Harry cracked a smile at that, as Hermione kissed Ron on the cheek and hurried away to finish setting everything up. "Oh grow up Ron!" she called over her shoulder.
Ron scoffed, "Mate I'm really not looking forward to this. Bloody hell! I heard Parkinson has decided to play an extreme version of truth or dare."
Justin groaned and covered his face with his hands. "Nice one, Harry," Seamus called out to him.
"Kitten!" Ron rasped, almost falling to the floor. Ginny rolled her eyes at him, although she was finding it hard to believe as well.
Surely so, there stood Draco Malfoy at the doorway to his room.
Harry whimpered, from the thought of Draco's cock inside his arse or Ron and Hermione' s hushed bickering, he didn't know.
"Potter! Hurry up! I need the dragon tails now!" Malfoy barked all of a sudden, shaking Harry out of his daydreaming stupor.
Harry will never forget the look of absolute shock on the witch's face as their eyes locked. He closed his eyes and prayed that it was all a nightmare.
"Excuse me Mister Zabini, out of my way, thank you. You too Miss Greengrass, let me through everyone." McGonagall's voice echoed.
Draco pushed one of his legs between Harry's, entangling their limbs together. He contemplated about reaching for the blanket, but Harry was so warm beside him that he settled on pulling Harry even closer. "I love you, Harry, I love you so much you have no idea," Draco blurted out, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I can't imagine a world with you gone."
"Malfoy!" Weasley shrieked, "Get off of him!"
Ginny furrowed her eyebrows trying to think. Just when the clicking sound of the doorknob being turned did realization finally dawn on her. How Harry had never been interested in her physically, how he couldn't get an erection when they tried to have sex, why Harry was so secretive about his new lover, how he kept saying he wasn't ready. A Slytherin boy who was the only eighth year Slytherin Prefect........ Ginny's eyes grew impossibly wide, "Ron," she managed to rasp out, "We've been so wrong, it's not even a girl, it's Mal-"
"You really do love my arse, don't you?" Harry smirked, contracting the muscles in said arse still around Draco's cock.
Draco huffed indignantly, "What, why me? Ask Weasley and Granger."
Harry moaned at that and jumped when a wandless spell left him completely naked. None of them recalled that anyone could come back after dinner. Frankly, they didn't even care. Draco trailed open mouth kisses down Harry's back leaving Harry shuddering.
"What?" Draco asked bewildered, "What's going on..."
Ginny and Ron get more than what they bargained for.
So here he was, sulking, with Malfoy as a potions partner for the second time this term. Today they were brewing an advanced version of an animagus potion. If brewed correctly it would turn the drinker into their animagus for a week. Harry was nervous, he really didn't want to knock over their cauldron again and suffer from the dire effects for as long as a week. So he opted to listen to Malfoy, considering that Malfoy was much better at potions than he was, even though he hated admitting it. This led to Harry chopping up the ingredients and handing them to Malfoy who administered the boiling cauldron.
"I'm afraid so, Harry," Hermione said gently.
Draco laughed as Harry straddled him and positioned himself over Draco's cock. "Hold on love," he said. When Harry growled he couldn't help but chuckle.
Harry giggled at that, unable to help himself. Malfoy frowned, "What's so funny, Potter?" Malfoy turned Harry around in his lap so that Harry was sitting sideways, and was now able to look at him.
"Hush Ron," Granger had said, "You'll wake up Harry!"
Harry, astonished, blinked at Nott. "Nott...wha..no-I..."
All that could be heard echoing across the common room walls were the sounds of skin slapping against skin and Harry's incoherent moans and pleads of, "Harder Draco! Merlin, faster please!" Draco didn't even bother touching Harry's cock, he was chasing away his own pleasure now and somehow it brought Harry even closer to release. Draco's huge cock inside him, Merlin it felt so good, filling his arse in a way it needed to be filled. Draco's hands gripping his hips, his voice right beside Harry's ear calling him a wanton cock slut and Harry could take no more. He screamed Draco's name and was coming, finally finding his release against the wall. Harry's tight arse squeezing Draco's cock with the sheer force of his orgasm had Draco losing his control.
Harry felt very relaxed having Draco's cock up his arse. It felt incredible plugging him up full of Draco's come, the thought itself being extremely erotic. Harry reveled in the feeling of being so full and experimentally wriggled his bum on Draco's cock. He felt Draco's cock twitch inside him before Draco spanked him lightly. "You're going to get me hard again if you keep doing that Harry," Draco hissed. Harry's giggles quickly turned into moans as Draco grinded his cock into Harry's backside stimulating Harry's sensitive nerves making Harry cry out.
"Harry would never take it up the arse! Never mind from Malfoy! He's not a poof!" Ron was shouting now, his face red and flaming.
Harry and Ron shared apprehensive looks. Ron shook his head at Harry and mouthed "can't do this mate" and started getting up when Hermione's voice cut through the air.
Just as Draco was about to pull out Harry stopped him by rasping out, "Don't pull out. I like having you in me." Draco was shocked at the blatant request, but smiled, realizing that there was no better place for his cock than it being embedded deep in the wet tight heat of Harry's arse. After a quick wandless cleaning spell, Draco settled them on their sides, pulling Harry as close as physically possible, his front plastered against Harry's back, spooning him fully. Harry pulled Draco's arm even tighter against his chest, interlacing their fingers together and pushed his arse back further onto Draco's cock.
Ron couldn't have whined louder. Harry himself glared daggers at Hermione, who leisurely shrugged and took a seat next to Ron. She and Pansy administered the veritaserum, placing three drops on everyone's tongue to make sure no one would be cheating.
"Ginny, I feel like I'm going to faint! This has to be an illusion! I did not just hear Malfoy compliment my best mate's arse while he continues.....touching Harry's butt like that....." Ron's voice was a mere whisper.
Harry turned around in his arms and gave him a look. "Alright I missed you......but mainly your arse," Draco chuckled, whilst his hands crept down Harry's back to squeeze his object of affection. Harry threw his arms around Draco's neck and smiled, in a way that was just for Draco.
There was no resistance whatsoever, Harry's hole opened up and his tight channel grew even wetter, easing the way. Harry moaned and moaned, whilst Draco was trying his best not to come, his prick being enveloped in the tight, wet heat of Harry.
Harry and Draco made their way over to the bed and with a quick spell, they were left naked.
"Truth," Harry said. He didn't think he could do anything sexual to Ginny in front of such a crowd.
"Aww, Harry.....you're so beautiful...." Harry's cheeks heated up as he wrapped his legs around Draco's waist. Draco arms which had been exploring the smooth skin on Harry's back dipped down to his arse as he groped it hungrily.
Carefully, to the bewildered faces of Hermione, Ron, and all other Gryffindors and Slytherins, Draco picked Harry up bridal style clutching him in his arms and doing his best to resist the urge to reach out and stroke Harry's soft ears.
So it happened, and Harry was indeed soon filled with Draco's release. Both of them panting against the wall, with Draco still inside Harry.
Ginny and Ron were frozen to the stop as they tried to process Harry in Malfoy's arms, his legs wrapped around Malfoy and his arms clutching on to Malfoy's chest and neck. Malfoy's hands were shoved into Harry's trousers, groping Harry's bottom as Harry whimpered softly. Ginny was afraid that her brother would get a heart attack, not that she was doing any better than him really.
Hermione quickly regained her composure as the words tumbled out of her mouth, "Yes...yes we have."
"What?" Dean snorted, "everyone here knows it's true. All the guys, and I mean all of us," he clarified, darting a look at Seamus, "has checked Harry out from behind and wished he was a girl just so we could fuck him."
"Oh come on Harry, we've known you for seven years! We see the way your face lights up during potions and the faraway dreamy expression you have during breakfast." Seamus said whilst pulling up his trousers.
Draco thought
Draco kneaded Harry's round arse cheeks, continuing to squeeze them, and gaping at the curve of Harry's arse that he's been fantasizing about for weeks. Harry growled into the wall and wriggled his bum, sticking his bubble butt into the air. "You can stare all you want later, just fuck me now please..."
"Sorry, you guys, you know I didn't mean that, it's just that I know Harry and he loves my sister and-" Ron cut himself off, shaking his head violently. Harry resorted to burying his face even deeper in Draco's chest, wanting to escape all the commotion.
Harry's eyes went wide as he stared at Dean in shock. "What?" Dean inquired, "It's the extreme version of Truth or Dare, Harry. We're starting easy. So what's your answer? Is the golden boy as golden as we think?"
"Good then," she said dragging Harry towards the cushions. "If you're done with your dawdling Harry James Potter, you will join us for some inter-house cooperation."
Another searing pain shot through him. Harry could feel his hole gaping in thin air, begging to get filled.
or Snape's indignant yelling, for he was crouched over Potter as a bright white light enveloped Potter's body.
"Want me to come with you?" Ron had asked him. Harry looked at him like he had grown another head. "It's the bathroom, Ron! For Merlin's sake, I'll be fine!"
"Exactly," Snape replied.
Not a second later they heard the click of the bathroom door being unlocked. Ginny's heart started to thump loudly. "Quick!" she hissed.
Hey everyone! I'm back after an entire year. I've been getting comments from you lovelies saying that you really want me to continue this so here you go. I just got lazy really and lost interest but comments really help to encourage me. I know its been a long time but I'll hopefully be updating regularly so stay tuned for that.
"Whatever you say, Harry," Draco purred. Harry started to lower himself down on Draco's cock, wriggling his hips, dragging the head of Draco's cock against his rim. Draco started to thrust upwards as Harry sank down and down until he was impaled on the whole length.
"Oh come on, mate," Seamus began, "you're no homophobe. I admit watching Harry get his arse fucked by Malfoy is...well new and not on our to do lists, but would you rather watch him fuck your sister?"
Ron sighed heavily, "of course not, Seamus, you know that."
Harry frowned and felt a motion above his head, he brought his hands up to his hair to encounter furry bunny ears. His jaw dropped to the floor.
Harry was in the bathroom when he thought he heard someone enter their dorm room. Not thinking much of it, he pulled out his toothbrush and starting squeezing out a generous amount of toothpaste onto it.
Seamus smirked evilly, "Ronniekins you know I did catch you staring at Harry's backside that other day in the Quidditch showers."
Harry was exhausted at this point. He didn't understand. They were supposed to get married and have children together.
"Oh no......" Harry trailed off.
It was Pansy who broke the silence. "These things happen," she said, "I'd say it's very noble of Potter to not mention how terrible his girlfriend is at sex before this moment and," she grimaced, "to put up with that. Weasley, girl come to me for advice. As for you Potter, come on, give it a spin."
Everyone was staring at them, their heads immediately turning to the source of the crash. Draco barely registered Granger's shriek of
Draco sighed, slumping his shoulders. "Fine," he muttered under his breath when in reality his hands were shaking with the mere thought of holding Harry, let alone carrying him.
"Fucking hell, Potter give it to me!"
"But 'mione!" Harry cried, "I'm really tired today, uh-yeah that's it, um I have to wake up early tomorrow to study, you know for newts and everything..."
"Besides," Hannah said in a small voice, "I bet it'll be smoking hot!"
Harry stared, dumbfounded at Blaise who happened to have the nerve to smirk back at him.
Draco was more than happy to comply, he pulled Harry's cheeks apart and gasped. Harry's hole was lovely, so tight and puckered up and it was dripping an abnormal amount of slick.
Next, it was Malfoy's turn and he was dared to grope and make out with Daphne. Harry watched with bleeding jealousy as Malfoy grabbed Daphne's arse and plundered her mouth with his tongue. Harry couldn't understand why he felt the need to shove Greengrass off his lap and pry his hands off her. He realized he was scowling when Malfoy raised his eyebrows at him, once the makeout session was over. He noticed Malfoy wasn't blushing or anything really. It didn't seem as though the snogging affected him in any way, which is shocking as Daphne was a pretty girl. Harry was once again brought back to reality as Malfoy had spun the bottle and it had landed on him.
Draco pushed Harry's fringe away from his forehead, the brilliant emerald green of Harry's eyes shining back at him. Quite abruptly, Draco couldn't take it anymore, not with Harry straddling him and his face merely inches away. Draco placed his hand on the small of Harry's back and pulled him forward, at the same time as Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and their mouths crashed together. Draco ran his tongue across Harry's bottom lip, seeking entrance, as Harry pliantly opened his mouth, as Draco's tongue plunged into his mouth exploring every bit of Harry's hot cavern. Their tongues glided together smoothly once Harry submitted into the kiss, and soon enough they were both moaning. Kissing Ginny had never ever felt this good, this was a whole new feeling. Harry couldn't believe what he was missing out on. Draco's hands traveled further down Harry's back until they were cupping Harry's arse. Draco then squeezed said arse causing Harry to moan and squeal.
Harry was thankful to Pansy for carrying on the game. He was barely aware of his surroundings as he asked Lavender, "Truth or dare?"
"Fine, I'm a top." Justin finally said blushing.
Malfoy was beside him in an instant. "Potter, Potter!" he said urgently, shaking Harry, "What's wrong with you? You're burning up!"
"Wow," Draco said, his face nestled in Harry's neck, arms around Harry to keep him upright.
They helped Harry to his feet and turned to leave, but not without a dirty look towards Draco, who just sat there not saying a word.
Draco was startled awake by Weasley's strangled voice piercing through the calm environment. He woke up to a start, noticing that his arms were still curled around Harry, one hand buried in Harry's tail and the other one wrapped around his ears. Harry was still fast asleep, apparently cute bunnies sleep a lot.
Harry whimpered, not wanting to face the crowd after the recent allegations.
"Oh no, Ron!" Harry trembled, "please not you too."
Harry gave him a suspicious look and turned to his friends. "What happened? Why do I feel different?"
Harry sighed and kept jabbing his fork into the pancakes, distorting the smiley face that once decorated it. Following Harry's inability to get his cock hard, Ginny had slammed the door of her room is his face, tears streaming down her cheeks.
Ron grinned like a maniac, "Got it!"
Harry reached around him and looked over his shoulder, sure enough, his hand was met with a soft ball of white fur.
Harry knew Nott was right. He could have dared Harry to do much worse to Malfoy but he didn't. Harry decided not to comment any further and instead walked up to Malfoy and sat down in the middle of Malfoy's lap.
"You okay Harry?" Draco questioned. Harry nodded slightly before raising his hips up just a few inches and slamming down again. Soon he was bouncing up and down on Draco's prick, his hands splayed across Draco's chest. Draco began to thrust upwards into Harry's tight heat, in time with Harry's downward motions.
Harry shrieked as Draco adjusted tilted Harry's arse up, changing the angle slightly and hitting Harry's prostate spot on. Harry was now a blubbering mess. Draco continued to hit his sweet spot, leaving Harry thrashing on the bed. "Gonna come in your pretty arse. Fill your filthy hole with my come. I know how much you love that." Came Draco's husky voice. Harry couldn't take it anymore, the pleasure was curling up his spine and he was seeing stars with every thrust.
"Calm down, Malfoy, Merlin," Harry growled under his breath whilst passing the tails to Malfoy. Malfoy snatched them out of Harry's hands scowling.
"It's alright Weasley, nothing to be ashamed of," Draco said with a curled up Harry still in his lap, refusing to move, "everyone's admitted to it anyway."
"What a wise decision," Draco mused. "Are you sure that's the only reason my boyfriend is here tonight? Or......" He drawled bending down to nip and suck on the skin of Harry's neck, "Did he have something else in mind?"
"Malfoy you git, get off of my boyfriend!"
Harry started whimpering further and reaching out for someone with his arms, further confirming her theory.
Draco stilled his fingers that were pumping in and out of Harry's arse and looked up from where he was sucking Harry's neck. Harry too seemed to take in his surroundings for the first time in the past fifteen minutes. Harry turned in Draco's lap to be met with horror-stricken faces. Ginny was crying, her eyes were red and puffy, tears had left streaks down her cheeks. Ron was staring at him in utter disbelief, although Hermione had a bit of a twinkle in her eyes, as though she wasn't too surprised this had happened. Everyone else had the same expression, that one would have after an encounter with an apparition. Parkinson seemed to be smiling and Zabini was smirking.
"Potter! What the hell? Why are you so fucking distracted?" Harry forced himself to look up at Nott. "Well Potter, I dare you...to sit down here... on Draco's lap, for the rest of the game."
It was now Malfoy's turn to look away, "Oh come on Potter, you've got bunny ears and a tail, even Snape would find you adorable and that's saying a lot."
Please leave me kudos and comments! It means a lot! Also, it really encourages me to update. If you guys want more of this story, you know what to do ;)
Ron sighed, his curiosity getting the best of him. "Fine," he said as Ginny's solemn expression blossomed into a grin. "Let's go get that darn invisibility cloak."
Ginny turned around in Harry's lap and smiled warmly at him. "Don't worry, Harry," she said reassuringly, "we'll have fun! You had fun last week didn't you?"
That was a voice he wasn't used to hearing although it was annoying and screechy all the same. Draco sat up, unconsciously pulling Harry with him, who was now sitting peacefully on his lap. With much difficulty, he removed one his hand which was caressing Harry's ears to rub at his eyes.
Easing Ron and Hermione remained a challenge. Ron continued to glare and Hermione usually opted to ignore Draco completely when they saw each other. The evening after their last failed attempt the lovers were lounging in matching flannel pyjamas. Harry was sprawled out on their couch with quill and newspaper puzzling over the crossword. Draco stepped over Harry to curl up beside him, brandishing mugs of hot chocolate against the blustery November weather.
“You wouldn’t understand.”
They took a couple more shots throughout the evening until they fell asleep. When Draco woke up Harry had already left. He dragged himself out of bed, dressed, and went to work.
As he put on his glasses he glimpsed something orange from the corner of his eye and was eventually able to focus on four horrified faces gaping at the two of them. It was Saturday the 20th. It was the day Harry agreed to have Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and her fiancé, Yannick, over for brunch since it had been forever since they’d all been together. It had completely slipped Harry’s mind amid his Draco-based scheming. Fuck.
“Look, obviously this isn’t ideal, but… we’ll manage,” he said, kissing Draco on the forehead.
“You’ll take it yourself, Malfoy.”
“Come on, I’ll take you home.”
Harry smacked Draco’s ass and pushed him down onto the desk behind him, removing the remaining fabric barrier. He pulled off his own robes and pushed down his pants to free an erection he hadn’t even noticed he had. Draco dug his nails into Harry’s back. Harry muttered a lubrication spell and pushed himself into Draco’s tight arse, and Draco let out a pained yelp.
“Live with me, Draco. Get out of your family’s shite memories and live in mine instead.”
Harry closed his eyes and sighed deeply. When he opened them Draco was pressing a bottle into his hands.
“Alright,” he finally said.
Draco held him at arms’ length. “Get your glasses.”
Nearly a quarter of an hour had passed before they returned and everybody sat down to eat at the round kitchen table. Harry sat down beside Yannick and Ron immediately took the chair on Harry’s other side. Draco wasn’t sure if this was a slight or an oversight, but he tried not to dwell on it either way. He sat opposite Harry.
Harry let his gaze fall to the floor. Tears started to pool in his eyes. Draco raised his want to silently fix the wall, and Harry’s hand.
“Fucking hell, Potter.”
“You mean I get the luxury of a bed this time?”
“Floo?”
Harry smacked Draco, open-handed. Much softer than Draco anticipated.
Panic burst into Harry’s voice. “No! Not home! I can’t go home.”
“My phone is about to die,” he wasn’t sure what this meant, but he remembered hearing it in a muggle technology 101 workshop the department had to do. “And I haven’t memorized my new number.” He didn’t understand the point of having a phone if you couldn’t tell people how to reach you on it, but the seminar assured them this was a plausible excuse.
“Do you live around here, Draco?”
Ron kept glowering at him; Ginny and Hermione glowered at Ron.
“Sit!” barked Mr. Bathurst. “This one is for you.”
“Mmmm? Oh, it’s you.”
“Well, you’re wrong.”
“They’re my friends who have no reason to see anything but the best in me.”
“Who would have thought, the gentle saviour rage-fucking a former death-eater.”
Kevin and Amanda continued making idle chitchat, leaving Draco wondering why he’d ever decided to skip the pub.
“I don’t think you know me very well, Potter.”
“Ron, I think I dropped my keys outside. Could you look?” asked Hermione. “Harry, why don’t you go with him, we have things sorted in here.”
Harry took a steadying breath and considered what to say next.
New tears started to form in the corners of Draco’s eyes. He prayed Harry hadn’t noticed, but this seemed unlikely as Harry stopped yelling, turned on his heal, and calmly walked away. Eventually Draco found some motivation to apparate home and pass out on his bed, letting the blood from his hand stain his white sheets.
He turned to see Ron Weasley scowling.
He eased himself off Draco then collapsed beside him, putting an arm around Draco’s torso and pressing his face into Draco’s neck.
The pair returned downstairs to find Ron — mouth closed, but eyes wide — hovering near the entrance while the other three were busy in the kitchen.
“This doesn’t have to be your home.”
“Bull shite. You must be having a great time here. You get to boss people around all you please and if they don’t like it you can blame it on someone above you none of us ever interact with. I bet you’re loving this.”
“Wow, you have a fancy old-fashioned name to match your fancy old-fashioned clothes,” said Kevin. Going to a fancy dress do?
“Does Weasley know how?”
The whole house was different. There were clearly lots of enchantments to make it feel natural to Draco’s guests, and it had been well cleaned, but there was more than that. When Harry was there the first time the house seemed to shout “stiff upper lip!” but now the atmosphere was comfortable and dynamic.
“Oi, what the fuck are you looking at?” shouted Ron.
“You look like you need a drink, Potter.”
“Don’t play dumb, you want proof of necessity for every tiny thing going back years. How the Hell am I supposed to get this, isn’t it your job to keep track of this shite?”
“What are you up to in these parts?”
“Who would have thought; a Malfoy fraternizing with muggle scum,” smirked Harry.
He tried to drown out the noise with fire whiskey, but failed to make a dent in his perception and cursed his high alcohol tolerance.
“So you like me as more than a friend too, then?”
Draco looked up at Harry still standing over him, rage now apparent in his features. Rage that Harry seemed to think was directed at him.
Draco was relieved to have someone foreign in their company. Yannick made pleasant conversation with the whole table and either didn’t notice or wholly ignored the tense atmosphere.
“I do.”
“We can match.” He put on a pair of light bluejeans, and a dark grey jumper. “Now I’m the most casually dressed.”
“Hello, Hagrid!” Harry said cheerfully.
“Why don’t we brighten it for tonight?” Harry enchanted the room to be less bleak: he replaced the peeling wallpaper with sunny paint, modernized the huge bed, and made the moth-eaten rug look whole.
“Be my date, Draco.”
“No, come on, we should get to have lunch in peace. You should be in Azkaban with the rest of your lot!”
“I know you’ve changed. I realize I don’t know the new you that well, but I’m impressed with what I see. I like you. I thought we could be more than we were. Maybe friends with benefits? But actual friends.”
Hagrid flushed. “Tha- tha’s very thoughtful of yer,…. Draco. Thank yeh.”
“Half your stuff’s gone.”
“Snoopy! Snoopy, get down! I’m so sorry, mister.”
“It’s nothing to do with me, the department is being audited.”
Harry laughed, then eventually said “how about half boy, half horcrux? Last known address of Voldemort’s soul.”
Unfortunately it didn’t take a long before a normally innocuous topic put a spanner in things.
“Understood. I won’t be mentioning you to my mother any time soon.”
Draco sucked and used his hands to squeeze Harry’s tight arse. Harry carefully slid in and out, enjoying the friction of Draco’s tongue on his underside. It didn’t take long before Harry spurted his own white ribbons into Draco’s willing mouth.
“We’re all here, you can tuck in,” Mrs. Weasley said ushering him to the table.
Draco forced a half smile that came out as a grimace.
“I don’t know, Harry. It’s weird enough living in my home with my relatives looking down on me from their portraits. Wouldn’t your parents be rolling in their graves if they knew their once home was going to hold a former Death Eater?”
“You’ve seen how Weasle- Ron. You’ve seen how hatefully Ron looks at me when I’m just passing by. How will he accept that we’re dating?”
“No! His family would have butchered us, yet he sits here like he’s a normal person. He’s a slimy toad and should be rotting in Azkaban with his good-for-nothing father!”
“No!” Harry jumped to his feet, clattering his dishes. “Look, Ron, we all have a history with Draco, but the others will at least try to move forward.
“What are you playing at, Malfoy?”
One morning after a particularly passionate Friday Draco was making breakfast in Harry’s kitchen. Just as a very disheveled, sleepy Harry strode in, a tiny brown owl started incessantly pecking at the window. Harry opened it, and the tiny owl zoomed around the kitchen a few times before finally standing on the table with its leg outstretched for Harry to remove his letter. The owl then zoomed away through the still open window. Draco closed it and joined Harry at the table.
When Harry went over a few days later he hardly recognized the place.
“Aren’t you glad we came?”
Just as Harry caught up with Draco someone shrieked behind him. He wheeled around to see the pair he had just fed with grins on their faces. The mother snatched a very shiny piece of paper off the ground and tucked it carefully away in an inner pocket. Harry was sure the ground had been completely clean a second ago. Harry alternately stared at Draco and back at the mother and daughter.
“Although… You’d be a friend I kept separate from my other friends. For probably obvious reasons.”
“Not at all, Potter.”
Draco tried to ignore his old classmates, but couldn’t stop himself from peering over from time to time. He kept downing shots until his roaring guilt was muted to a low hum. Noticing the three preparing to leave he quickly paid and left, hoping to avoid another painful encounter.
“Auror extraordinaire?”
“What the fuck is wrong with you!? Are you that disgusted at the idea of being helped by a mud blood!?”
“Hey!” someone called. Draco whirled around, concerned he’d been seen, and tried to think which muggle-control tactic would be best in this situation. Before he came to any conclusion he was mowed over by a large, brown thing.
Draco had managed to keep his feelings on even ground so far. Harry was right - out of the Weasleys Draco had been worst to Ron at Hogwarts and even Ron would tolerate him, however much displeasure the notion brought him. But Hagrid was another matter. Draco was flooded with all the memories of trying to disgrace and remove him from Hogwarts. Hagrid looked back to Harry, all the warmth of his expression was gone. He gave a small grunt and resolutely turned to his plate for the rest of the meal. Very little was said by anybody and Draco was relieved nobody was comfortable asking him a direct question. The chatter was mostly about how tasty one of Mrs. Weasley’s dishes was, or how Bill and Fleur were managing with Dominique.
“Draco! No fancy dress this time, eh?” said Kevin.
Shortly after he arrived Mr. Bathurst strode into Draco’s office with another package under his arm. Draco stood, expecting to need his muggle clothes again.
“If you wanted another fuck, Potter, why didn’t you just say so?”
Draco’s Harry-dry-spell continued for another booze-filled fortnight. Then one evening he was wrapping up his work, considering again fucking off to the Scottish woods for a bit when a livid Harry apparated into his own office with a crash. Draco strode over to see what was happening. He peered through harry’s open door and found him feverishly shaking with glassy rage in his eyes. Without warning Harry punched the wall creating a sizeable crater.
“Regardless, Mr. Bathurst wants it rewritten in excruciating detail.”
“Actually,” Draco pulled a neatly wrapped box out of his leather shoulder bag and floated it to Hagrid. “Sorry, it was a bit rushed.”
“Is that a friend, Draco? We have room for one more!”
“We have something for each of you,” Harry said smiling. “Well, except Hagrid. Sorry, we didn’t know you were coming.”
Draco thanked the Weasleys for their hospitality and left hand-in-hand with Harry.
Malfoy scowled and righted himself in the most dignified way he could manage, disheveled and covered in dog slobber. With Snoopy pulled off him, Draco took a magically absorbent handkerchief from his breast pocket, wiped himself off, wrung it out, and replaced it.
“Have you got a better idea?”
“Say, Potter, why aren’t you with Weasley and Granger now?”
Draco’s sex-addled brain was struggling harder than otherwise to make sense of current events. Was Harry Potter actually beginning to like him as a real person?
“You could. That’s not what I had in mind, though.”
Hagrid stared at Draco while he unwrapped the box, clearly suspicious. When the box was open he peered down, unsure what to make of its contents. But his eyes lit up as Draco spoke.
“Morning,” said Harry, leaning forward for a kiss.
“Yes, it’s me. Mr. Bathurst isn’t happy with your expense report from this morning. He wants a thorough rewrite.”
Draco was shocked at all they had to say about the human mind, its general likes and dislikes. Most people didn’t like chess because it wasn’t that exciting; you need some luck to keep people on the edges of their seats. But too little strategy and a game is pointless.
Finally Amanda said “It was nice to meet you, Draco. Hope we’ll see you around here again!”
“Has he lost your respect because he finally got wrapped in something he couldn’t bribe or blackmail his way out of?”
"Lily," Harry breathed softly. The pain from the day before came fluttering back like a stab to the chest at the mention of her name. He attempted to dismiss it again with a large gulp of his coffee.
"Hermione, Draco just—"
"In passing. You'll need a bit more than that, though." Malfoy shifted. Was he nervous, maybe, instead? "She'll say what she means without hesitation. Are you ready for that?"
He could run. This choice would require no rushed excuses and called to him with its security.
more in the end. We'll see…. Make conversation with him about menial, plebeian things. Actually…." He tilted his head to once side and then the other, thinking for a silent moment. "All conversations you start with anyone should be dreadfully boring and unrefined.
The car continued to idle, exhaust plumes eerily accenting the red glow of the brake lights. He wondered how long the driver would wait.
Astoria nodded, rising as well and walking him down the stairs to the front door. "I meant what I said, Harry Potter — don't be a stranger."
"How good is your memory?" Malfoy asked as he settled into the chair cater-cornered from Harry. Their knees brushed under the table, but he quickly readjusted to give them less intimacy.
"Right…." Draco nodded slowly and pulled back. He covered his face, momentarily startled to remember it wasn't his own. The bloke whose face he wore likely knew what Potter was talking about. Which made sense as Draco had very purposefully chosen to wear the face of a Muggle, knowing it was safer to remain anonymous while mingling in the wizarding world. He had fully intended to come across as approachable and
The look in his eyes when that knock came at the front door….
"I wasn't staring," Draco said gently. "Not on purpose. I was just…lost in thought. Does that make you uncomfortable?"
"Oh, yes. Very."
DeWitt flipped his pad closed and crossed his arms, tilting his head to the side in challenge. "Did this 'old friend' happen to be N.L., date of birth July thirtieth, nineteen-eighty?"
"—I'll admit I think I know why you've asked for an interview," she continued as if he hadn't said a word. Harry felt his cheeks flush with blood and shifted in his seat uncomfortably.
Hermione winced at her husband's admission, but shrugged in affirmation. "I'm sorry, Harry, but you're simply not as subtle as you think."
do this. For real this time.
time for you to leave now. And here I thought you were my friend. Same old Malfoy, right? Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. Was it
Malfoy rolled his eyes, detaching from the doorway and disappearing inside. "Shoes off!" he called over his shoulder.
Malfoy licked his lips and breathily asked, "Like?"
"Well, come on down," Harry chided the cat, a mangy Maine coon rightfully dubbed 'The King' (never just King, as he had rightfully earned his title as the one and only). "You'll just have to deal with the mess a bit longer. I have no motivation to clean it up. Not just yet."
They had a long way to go.
for so many nights, Malfoy. It was like masochistic torture. I was desperate to stop it because at that time…I was happy and I thought Ginny and I were going to get married." Harry quickly breathed out. He wasn't making enough sense, not that this situation was dripping in rationality. "I just wanted them gone!"
He could do this — he
The words echoed in Harry's mind. He frowned, closing his eyes to the pin-pricks of darkness clouding his vision.
Harry jumped, trying to surreptitiously loosen his fingers from Draco's before Charlie took notice. "It's okay," he muttered after clearing the emotional clog from his throat. "I only just woke up. Did you bring Teddy with you?"
Draco Malfoy, the literal saint of wayward souls.
"Thanks for that. Now the whole department will be gossiping," Draco spat, waving his wand in a methodical pattern at the room's door handle.
I wouldn't…. I wouldn't do something like that. And, besides, my records are public. Anyone could have read them!"
Harry focused his sight on the old man named Dobby as he wheeled in a cart carrying their first course. The man hobbled closer at a snail's pace, setting a bowl down in front of Lucius before continuing on. Watching him was painful…but he couldn't answer the question while looking at the girl. Her pitch-dark eyes made him feel like he was going to boil alive from the inside. "I'm Ma—, er,
Rolling his eyes, Draco stood abruptly from the table. "I have to get to work.
"Er, sorry, Luna." Harry examined the plants she held, but still couldn't quite see a difference between them or the ones he was supposed to pull out. "Herbology wasn't really my strong suit."
Harry's outburst exploded smack in the middle of another conversation he wasn't privy to. A conversation that may have been an argument. He wasn't entirely certain, but he also didn't really have the capacity to care in that moment. He was interrupting and it was rude…but he needed to vent.
But a moment later that didn't matter. Potter was closing the distance between them again. He was so much braver than Theo could ever have dreamed of being. His lips taking what they wanted without a trace of doubt. So sure and so
' She gave the word 'boyfriend' an aggressive underline and I'm not sure what she meant by that, but it was the first time she had actually referred to you as something other than '
"How is that rele-"
How could he bury a bomb like that in between such sweet words? How could he make it sound just that easy? "Don't say things you don't mean," Harry cautioned.
"That came out wrong," Harry attempted to backpedal, which wasn't much of an apology at all. "
He just hated himself.
There was no confliction to how Rita felt. She was terrified, he could see it in her eyes and in the way she nodded much too quickly. Without a word, she snatched her acid-green quill and the strip of parchment out of the air and stuffed them into her leopard print bag. She chose in their stead a simple biro and notebook which she slapped down on her knee, turning her attention to Harry with a shaken smile. "Let's hear it then," she said bruskly, but he could hear the tremor to her voice.
"Maybe I should sleep with him." For the second full night of his stay, Harry had locked himself in his and Teddy's room yet again. He had taken one look at the family sitting around the dinner table downstairs and fled. Shea had been trying to hatch a plan ever since. "Do you think that would make him more comfortable here?"
Harry wasn't certain if she meant "sharp" as in quick-witted or like a thorn. Either way, it sounded almost like a compliment and he was filled with smug pride at having ruffled her feathers. He grinned, subconsciously loosening their fingers in order to squeeze Malfoy's knee. It took him a second to realise how strange and tender this action was, reconciling that knowledge with the way Malfoy had startled. He pulled back almost immediately, deciding to finally occupy himself with eating. It seemed a much safer task than either spouting off further or accidentally losing himself in the fantasy they were crafting.
Harry thought he might have seen sparks, but
"Good, good." Kingsley released his arm after one last reassuring pat. "Have a good evening, boys."
The truth was, Harry wasn't sure there was another person alive that he trusted more. No, not even Charlie. Charlie hadn't been through the kind of shit Draco had. They were like two sides of a different coin, Harry and Draco. Two sides of a different war…. Both going through hell and coming back scarred. Charlie didn't have those scars. He didn't understand. And somehow that meant the most to Harry. Nodding slowly, he ran his fingers over where those definable scars – the ones he'd given – striped Draco's chest chest.
these murders you're trying to pin on me?"
"Yes, Mashed Potato, too," Draco assented, patting the dog gently atop his head — which only further encouraged him to take liberties against his personal space by lunging up and gently nipping at Draco's chin. He did, on some unexpected level, like the dog…but certainly not that much.
Unfortunately, Harry was a bloody disaster of a liar, which Hermione was all too kind to point out for the study group. Even though all of the Slytherins hardly knew Harry in the slightest, Theo, Blaise Zabini, and Daphne Greengrass all nodded along just as naturally as if Hermione had simply stated the weather.
And he wanted to go home.
"I thought it would be a fun surprise," Malfoy said coolly. He was so damn calm. "This is Harry Potter and he is my
"So you r-"
"Thank you," Harry said on an excited exhale. Everything in his hard-knock life had led to this. Using his harsh past to do something good.
Love you all!
Most likely due to his harsh tone, they rode the lift up to their department in complete and awkward silence. If there had been any shred of barely bridled anger between them, it would have felt just like they were back in school again. The air between them was thick with tension and full of more unspoken words than could be healthy. Magic was almost visibly sparking between them, their instincts reaching for what they were both so afraid of.
Leaving him alone with his family.
"Tonight it does…."
The girl's insides looked like burnt soup. Harry could still see it ingrained into his retinas behind his eyelids. "It's the poison," Mel explained. "It targets the organs but leaves everything else perfectly pristine. On the outside, it looks like she might not have suffered at all. But, really…. It would have been slow and painful. And because the potion used also paralyses the body…."
This right here for the rest of his life.
Feeling judged and quite put out, Harry snatched back the paper and tossed it out of Ron and Hermione's reach. Of course they wouldn't understand. Hermione looked at love as logical and reasonable, even despite her current situation. And Ron…well, Ron he didn't know well enough to make assumptions. But he was sure he may just be a bit too thick to understand such things.
Somewhere beyond the echoing in his head, Harry could make out Malfoy saying something about the couple being totally fine and then adding on the backend that they were institutionalized. Which didn't sound "fine" at all….
Hogwarts was going to be his real escape. Months and months away at a time. Followed by holidays, of course, where his escape would be interrupted. But he felt like he could get through those given enough time away. This was his own, private wishful thinking, anyway.
There had been so much blood.
"You thought what, Teddy?" Draco's voice was gentle, but pressing. And in the way he looked at him now, he was sure that Draco knew. He knew, or at least partially knew, what was wrong. He knew this secret was unsavory. He knew that something was
In that moment, Harry could see two available options. The first would be the easiest – laugh the comment off and try to save his relationship with an innuendo-laced quip. His conversation earlier with Hermione echoed in his head when he thought of the second option – confront Draco about Astoria's accusation. It was the right and most 'adult' thing to do. It was certainly the healthiest option. He shouldn't continue to try and pretend he didn't know about something so big and so private. If he was even able to do so any longer... Harry had never considered himself the most adept of liars.
"Why was Malfoy even there?"
A happy ending.
But thanks to Harry Potter….
Potter's breath was soaked in liquor. He had obviously imbibed in a few more drinks before coming back. Theo should have probably questioned that. If he needed to be trashed to do this, that wasn't entirely healthy. It was a giant red flag. But he wasn't willing to lose this before he'd even had it. So he quelled the protest nagging at the back of his mind and set down his now-empty glass on the nightstand.
Harry didn't give her a chance to speak her mind, cutting her off with a light-hearted laugh. "It was Draco's idea, but honestly—"
change my opinion on my decision not to hex you. Understood?"
"Merlin, no, that's not it. I love Charlie. And he's fit — superbly fucking fit," Harry explained. "But Charlie cares about nothing but dragons and I would have no desire to compete with that."
"What are we waiting for, then?"
Crooking a brow at the formality of Sharif's words, especially amongst the relaxed clamour of the pub, Draco nodded and followed his date to a table just close enough to the bar to be convenient, and yet irritating in its lack of privacy.
"I can shift my appearance," Teddy said eagerly, saving Draco the trouble with a sly grin. He wasn't allowed to tell many people he met. Letting it out felt good. "Well…sort of. I can shift my hair. I haven't been able to do anything else. It's called metamorphamagy. My mother, she could do it, too. Dad says she was able to shift her face, as well." Lost in a thought, he set the last plate down on the table and fingered a strand of his hair. "She liked to wear her hair pink…."
Malfoy was much cooler under pressure. "You should be flattered, darling," he chuckled, washing down the two bites he'd taken with a sip of the wine Dobby had come around to freshly pour. A blood red drop clung to his bottom lip before he gingerly licked it away. Every move he ever seemed to make was purposeful and smooth. "She thinks you have the body to be a go-go boy."
He accepted it without a second's thought and rose to his feet following her insistent tug. "And what might that be?" he chuckled, reaching forward to brush a bit of seed from her forehead.
"It was Draco's idea to start this organization, you know. While I was off dancing at clubs and testing out my sexuality, he poured every last Knut from his trust into this place. And I used mine to keep us afloat for this long…." As she trailed off, Astoria's gaze clouded over with unkempt emotion. Harry outstretched his hand in supportive offering, which she squeezed only once before letting go. "We had hoped to keep things going with donations, but no one with money to spare these days wants anything to do with us. It's absolutely backwards, but the magical community isn't overly warm to LGBT people yet. We're just as behind as the Muggles in that respect. Perhaps more so;
"Like I
A possibility neither of them felt up to acknowledging quite yet.
Potter shifted so his left hand now cradled the back of Draco's head and his right was fully free. He pressed his middle and pointer fingers to Draco's bottom lip, willing him to open further. Draco greedily accepted the digits onto his tongue, laving them in all the moisture he could spare. "
Not to Malfoy, though, apparently. "Lovely idea, Tori."
He had finally achieved the one thing he had pined after for too many months. But it was all wrong. It wasn't his face, wasn't his body, wasn't his pleasure to experience.
"When the

Harry Potter kissed him and suddenly the world felt different.
A blush darkened the boy's cheeks. He felt foolish. "I'm sorry….," he whispered. "I just…. I thought…."
(See the end of the chapter for

"No, so you may as well come back to bed."
"S'pose that's true," Harry chuckled, the strangely tense air between them melting back to normal. "Guess you'll have to settle for" he paused to lean down, searching through a basket behind him "
, would you?"
An intentional clearing of a throat pulled Harry the rest of the way out of his head. He looked up, finding Draco standing beside him with a steaming mug. "Morning…," Draco said quietly, an uncharacteristic meekness to his features.
With a concerned frown, Draco turned his gaze back to the pot. "Sorry," he apologized before clearing the sentimental emotion clogging his voice. "I didn't mean to stare." It was a lie, but held a better tone than the truth. "I just…." He looked up again to find that he was alone. Teddy was already back out in the dining room, head seemingly in a permanent bow. Draco's frown deepened and he now found it difficult to stop watching. Something was wrong with the boy.
As expected, the alarm tripped the instant he stepped across the threshold. Helpless to do anything but wait, he kicked the door shut to spare his neighbours from the gonging sound and leaned back against the wall in the entranceway.
," Draco mumbled, his hand on his swiftly beating heart.
, Scorpius!"
"Fucking hell, Harry!" followed a loud crash. Harry winced, guiltily eyeing the shards of broken ceramic. "We've talked about this! Send a letter ahead of time!" Charlie fixed the mess with a simple wave of his wand, but took a bit longer to erase the shock on his face. "You scare the hell out of me every. Damn. Time."
"Mr. Malfoy?"
Malfoy sighed, rather calmly setting his mug back on the table. "I could pay a prostitute much less than I'm paying you for something like that. If you've changed your mind on doing this…well, then I'll need my money back. I don't have the luxury of time to waste."
Harry nodded, casting his eyes back down to the incessant throbbing between his legs. "I just don't want to fuck this up," he muttered, his voice embarrassingly squeaky with emotion. "
"Was this scheduled?" Harry questioned, sitting back in his chair and flipping open a file.
don't think too hard about this."
They wanted a ghost who was never going to find his way back home.
"Have you told my brother?"
Charlie was only home in spurts. Short bursts that they were just expected to take advantage of. And the rest of the time, they were just meant to ignore the loneliness. They were just supposed to accept it as it was.
There were a million thoughts running through Teddy's mind. Draco was only a small part of them. A minor inconvenience when put toe-to-toe with some of the others. And all of them mixed together were keeping him awake. And all of them together were giving him a stomachache. And all of them together felt like
"I'm sure you can't," Malfoy snapped, effectively drying up Harry's budding sympathy. "But that's not the point. The
"You don't have any wards on your home?" Potter questioned, snapping back Theo's attention.
With a smile towards the doorway, Draco pushed a button on top of the train Harry had purchased for the boy. He'd seen it in a shop and didn't hesitate a second to buy it. Scorpius was obsessed with vehicles. This particular train, imbued with magic to bring it to life, sputtered and whistled before spewing a cloud of steam.
By the end of it, Draco looked and sounded utterly defeated. "I spent a few months in rehab after Scorpius was born," Draco whispered towards his cup. He had ceased stirring its contents once the steam no longer rose from its surface, but he still wasn't drinking. "The war..." He cleared his throat, voice falling husky with barely contained emotion. "She was right; I did drink too much and too often. Every day. And I'm certain you're judging me for not remaining sober, but that is
In the span of a silent minute, Potter's face flipped through about ten different emotions. He couldn't settle on just one reaction. It was clear he didn't know how he felt about this. Possibly about any of it. And that would definitely work out in Theo's favor. "But you're his friend…. No, that's not true. Draco doesn't have friends these days. He said he had to distance himself. I guess I thought he did that to
But Draco had no standing. Charlie had insisted he go with his brother. There was nothing Draco could do to stop it. After this whole mess was over, he vowed to make it right where he could. Not that promising this to himself softened the deep ache in his heart.
Ron cleared his throat, apparently not knowing when to leave well enough alone. "So…do blokes
If Ernie Macmillan were truly the good guy, he wouldn't have broken Potter's heart.
Selfishly, Harry had thought this situation could get no worse. The bad guy was caught and likely behind bars. The killings should stop. No more families would lose their children by McClain's hand. He thought it was over. That this last little hurdle with Teddy in the hospital was it. That this was the end of the newest shit show in his life.

fears?"
Harry nodded slowly, but said nothing further. Every time he tried to open his mouth, the words stalled and died in his constricted throat. He felt like he could cry at any moment, but couldn't discern if they were tears of waiting relief or of irrational fear.
"Just eat your food," Rodolphus snapped at his daughter, but he could have very easily been speaking to them all.

Harry threw his hands up in the air in spectacularly dramatic fashion. "Am I a good gay?"
Despite wanting to hold onto that feeling for as long as he could, he nodded and hitched his ankles up where his fingers were a moment previous. Arching up for a better angle. Knowing if he couldn't remain filled, at least he could let Potter try to hit him deeper.

"Draco? Sugar?"

"Alright, alright…I'm gonna try and get your dad home again," Harry grumbled towards the kitchen after he'd pulled himself up off the floor. He groaned again at the mess of their apartment before stalking to the door. "But you better not cry if I can't. You might be stuck with me and I need you to try and live with that."

He was supposed to be able to avenge his son's violent loss of innocence with every ounce of fire and brimstone deep within him. Bill's surrender wasn't supposed to be soft or easy. He shouldn't get off without pain. He wasn't supposed to be remorseful. There was
Harry noticed him awkwardly staring at his clothes.
Harry laughed. “Hardly. You know they gave me that office because of my reputation. Not because I did anything to deserve it.”
Weeks flew by like minutes, then months like hours. Over this time Draco’s whole demeanour softened. He hadn’t visited the pub once since he befriended Harry. He often hummed to himself as he worked. When he passed people in the office corridors he would nod, and sometimes even smile, not caring that many of them muttered feigned concern over his mental health as he passed.
Harry’s eyes widened. Of course Draco wasn’t entertaining muggles. These were undercover wizards, though to what end he wasn’t sure.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, sincerely confused.
When the games ended and the guests were leaving Harry offered to help clean up. Draco nodded, unsure what to expect. Harry didn’t look like he needed a shag, but what else did he ever want from Draco?
“A small token to acknowledge the difficult life you led. Especially with slimy gits like me about.”
“Yeah.”
“My name’s Amanda, and,” she glanced over her shoulder, “that’s my husband Kevin catching up.”
Ron and Harry glanced at Hermione, then awkwardly at each other, then nodded and stepped outside.
He stepped back form the window and opened his desk drawer. He supposed he could spend the evening setting up his phone now since he was sure he’d get an earful from Mr. Bathurst in the morning otherwise.
“Fair point. They won’t be coming over much with the holidays approaching. I reckon I could keep you secretly stashed away while we keep trying to ease them into the idea of your very existence.”
Draco looked at Harry with an uncomfortably neutral expression, then stepped aside and beckoned him in.
“Somewhere… private.”
“Date me. Be more than my friend.”
“I’ll summon the fastest owl, sir.”
“What was that, Potter?”
When all that remained of the shelf was a smokey outline, Draco continued through the rest of the house. He found a few more items to burn, as well as what may or may not have been torture devices that he planned to hand over to the Ministry for the Destruction of Dangerous and Controlled Wizarding Artefacts. As soon as he could be sure he wouldn’t be arrested on the spot for possessing them. Here and there he found the odd item with some utility: a pocket weather predictor that at the moment was raining on a small patch of carpet, a very ornate pair of omnioculars, and an ancient book on dragon breeds around the world. By the time Draco went to bed he had burned several pieces of furniture and a couple dozen more egregious books. He had also sent at least a third of the house’s contents to the Well-Wishing Wizards’ Collection for the Woefully Underprivileged.
In the coolest tone he could muster, he answered “what do you want, Potter?”
Draco led Harry to his room — a place as dismal as the downstairs when Harry first saw it.
“Harry Potter? Didn’t Draco call you Potter?”
“Hmm…”
All eyes were on Draco now. He rolled his own and walked to the far side of the pub, barely hearing Ron say “he’s still a slimy git.”
“We missed you at the dog park!” said Amanda.
Draco’s encounters with Harry grew fewer and farther between. He supposed it made sense, crime had been light recently, so stress around the office was low, and Harry surely preferred to spend time with people he actually liked. Draco increased the frequency of his trips to the pub and reverted to blacking out rather than sleeping. One night he went one shot too many and struggled to wake up for work on time. He managed to apparate in a quarter of an hour late, and noticeably disheveled.
Harry finally glanced around his current surroundings. It reminded him of Sirius’s family home.
“They’re trying for a baby. I give them extra space these days.”
Harry had to clamp his jaw shut to stop himself from gasping. Draco was entertaining muggles. They were playing muggle games on enchanted-to-look-like-muggle furniture. There was a dog on the couch. Didn’t Draco hate dogs?
“You’re just loving this, aren’t you Malfoy?”
The tension finally eased and everybody else unwrapped their presents. Mr. Weasley examined the muggle board game he unwrapped — “you mean the players have to move all the pieces themselves? But there are hundreds of them! Astounding!” Mrs. Weasley cooed over an ornate device that looked like a globe spinning in real time. Instead of countries it had pictures of her family members’ faces and would count down to their birthdays, as well as holding their favourite foods, colours, and a handful of other preferences.
After an hour and exactly three solved clues, they decided it was time to turn in. Harry placed his paper and quill, along with his glasses on the side table by his head and quickly fell asleep, one arm around Draco whose head was nestled into Harry’s chest.
Draco gave a curt not, then turned away ducking behind the first building so he could apparate home. He made a mental note to be extra careful to actually end up alone next time he ventured out.
“I’ll tell him in the morning.”
“Didn’t you two date? Is there anything there I should know about?” Draco laughed.
“Cheers,” Draco clinked his own bottle against Harry’s and took a large swig. Harry followed suit.
One evening at the end of a Harry-free fortnight he knew that Harry was expected to wrap up a particularly difficult case and thought he’d stick around to be Harry’s punching bag, but when 8:30 rolled around he decided it was time to give up for the night. He choked down a plum and a few bites of crackers and cheese — the bare minimum dinner he figured he could eat to avoid starvation — and considered where to go. He didn’t fancy going home — now, or ever, but particularly now. He thought of apparating into a secluded park and wandering aimlessly until he had only enough energy to get himself home. He picked a spot in the north west of Scotland, but as he was about to apparate, a precarious ink bottle fell off his desk and surprised him. Distracted, he mistakenly apparated to a residential London street.
“Arsehole.”
“I suppose.”
Harry burst out laughing. Draco smirked.
“This is for you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I wasn’t sure what colour was appropriate,… so I kept it neutral,… Draco.”
“Your mum? It was in my desk,” said Draco in a carefully cool tone.
“You must have been schoolmates then, for him to call you by your surname.”
“Ron, just leave it.”
“What are you doing with the jumper my mum made?”
“Aside from Draco Malfoy, heir of the finest pureblood family that ever lived in Britain?”
“What about this place? Looks like inheritance as well.”
Draco paused, brow furrowed. “A gift from my mother.”
Unsurprisingly the atmosphere at the Weasleys was tense when they arrived. Draco had done his best to match Harry’s level of formality when choosing his garments, but he was keenly aware he was the smartest dressed of the lot. Nobody would hold his gaze for very long; he could feel the adults taking it in turns to stare at him, but they quickly looked away whenever he turned to them. It was going to be a long day.
“Then how do you propose I get there?”
“Lucky of them to find a winning ticket, eh, Potter?”
The whole table was mulling over Draco’s words, but the next moment was the key to making them sink in. Harry was gazing lovingly at Draco. And Draco was smiling back. Not sneering or scowling; smiling. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny had never seen Draco smile. He looked like a completely different person.
“Oddly tender for a rage-fuck.”
“What if I need to pee?”
Draco mulled it over in disbelief. He had redeemed himself to Harry Potter. Harry sodding Potter wanted to be his actual friend.
After preparing himself for the worst, Harry’s mouth fell open when he saw the Draco that answered the door. He was smiling. Not sneering, or smirking. Smiling warmly at someone inside. And he was wearing muggle clothes: khakis and a white v-neck t-shirt. Draco faltered when he realized who was at the door.
“Dave; hello,” said a man who looked about Harry’s age.
“I think about what it could have been. What it was while they were happy. It’s the only piece of my family I have, so I have to make the most of it, I guess. It was alright until tonight.”
“Okay, Potter- Harry, what the hell are you playing at?”
“… Yeah.” He had never had to set a table before; house elves had done all the menial tasks at home, and he hadn’t had anybody over for a proper meal since he left the manor. So he placed the dishes by hand as there are few other occasions one has to charm so many items at once and he wasn’t confident he knew how. He became painfully aware that Harry’s guests were taking it in turn to stare at him; it must have been an odd sight with him in muggle clothes doing such a simple task without magic. But nobody said anything.
“I see a light in his office; you’ll go now.”
“Board games? Like chess?”
“I said what the fuck do you want, Potter?”
Several moments passed before Draco said “hate fuck me, if you prefer.”
“Does it matter?”
Another week passed and on Friday night Draco was back at Kevin and Amanda’s for board games. Draco’s new friends explained at length their opinions on various games and how they chose the ones they wanted to play. They avoided games that ended at different times for different players because it meant people had to wait around with nothing to do. They liked cooperative games, but Amanda had a soft spot for silly, luck-based dice-rolling games.
“No, you’ll have to cross muggle territory.”
This all made Draco nervous; this caring, thoughtful Harry wasn’t the version he was used to. He didn’t let his face betray him, however, eager to see what the new Harry would do.
“Harry, then. What was that?”
“I assume I’m wasting my time here.”
“You should be more mindful of where your things end up, Potter.” He continued his way to his meeting, trying not to shiver.
“Did…. did you…”
The venue this year was no doubt a brilliant idea by the the senior Weasley, Draco thought with a sneer. It was a regular muggle hall in the middle of muggle London. Weasley had just managed an extremely difficult muggle-relations case so the other departments were being very agreeable to his odd interests. The hall kept at least a skeleton staff on duty for each event, so the guests were told to use predetermined apparition points nearby and walk from there. Since they would have to walk muggle London everybody was in their own interpretation of muggle formal wear. Had he been less hated, someone might have commented on how smart Draco looked in his tightly tapered tuxedo.
“Come on, let’s get cooking and let these two get organized.” Ginny pulled Ron with her by the forearm. He resisted, but ultimately had to give in to her surprising strength. The other two slowly followed leaving Draco and Harry to climb the stairs and dress properly. As Draco walked he noticed his bottoms hanging particularly low on his hips and realized how tightly he’d been squeezing his muscles. He tried to take a calming breath, but he could not undo the knot below his ribs. Draco had barely started moving things from his previous address; all he had with him were muggle clothes. He pulled out a pair of black jeans, a lilac t-shirt, and a beige cardigan. He felt extremely underdressed. Everybody else would be wearing robes; this would be his first time in wizard company when he was dressed to anything less than the nines. He supposed he could probably fit Harry’s clothes, but it might be more awkward if someone at the table recognized his garments as not his own.
“Hi, friend of Draco! I’m Amanda. This is Kevin.”
“‘Arry, I didn’t even know you were into blokes. And him. Him! Of all the blokes. Yer a better man tha’ me, eh, to leave e’erythin’ in the past. But I ca’ see ‘e isn’t the same bratty kid ‘e was. This was a very though’ful gift, i’ was. An’ yeh know, ‘Arry, if ‘e makes yeh ‘appy, we’re all ‘appy for yeh, e’en if we don’ un’erstan’ right away.”
“Hold it.”
Draco flushed. “Yeah, I guess that’s about right.”
Lunch time rolled around and Draco considered nipping off to the pub for a couple rounds because why the fuck not. When he sat at the bar he was unpleasantly surprised to hear Ron’s voice from a nearby table. He got up to move further down the bar away from them, but couldn’t help stealing a glance at Harry after last night. He looked happy. Almost.
“But he’s with the dementors now, yeah?”
“Aside form him.”
“You’ll tell him now.”
Draco laughed, as if that could be enough to convince the others of his goodness.
“… Okay, let’s get out of this shitehole.”
“Among muggles I’m nobody. I’m a young man with a funny name, nothing more. I can be whatever I choose. Even my dark mark is just an edgy tattoo, not something I have to desperately keep out of sight.”
They laughed.
“So, will you tell me what happened, or are you going to make me guess?” Draco asked, sitting on a couch facing Harry.
Somebody missed him?
“Potter’s explanation isn’t good enough; go get a full write-up that details the need for every knut.”
“Maybe you deserve it.”
Fresh rage skirted over Harry’s face and he dived toward Draco, stopping when their noses were practically touching.
“Those are the collected works of your great-great-grandfather. He was a pioneer in wizard psychology. How could you disg-.”
“Sort of,” said Kevin. “We’re playing with some friends the weekend after next. We have another newcomer, so we’ll bring some good intro games. Join us and you can see how you like it.”
“Come on, Ron, he works in Harry’s department. Don’t give him a reason to make life difficult for Harry.”
“What a notion,” Draco smirked. “Don’t you reckon you’d better tell your friends you don’t hate my guts before they find us shacked up together?”
“We thought it must be getting hard to keep track by now,” said Harry.
“Aside from Harry Potter, the boy who lived? The Saviour? The Chosen One?”
“Yeah, leave it, Ron. I report to him on lots of stuff.”
Harry took a few steps closer and saw the blood trail from Draco’s hand. He muttered a healing charm and watched the broken skin reform. Draco turned to face Harry. He stared at him with dead eyes as he balled his hand and punched the wall beside him as hard as he could, undoing Harry’s work.
"Go for it," Harry said.
You're so grateful it's a cushioned chair. It hurts less on your well-spanked bottom. You sit, and lean back while spreading your legs and letting them drape over the arms. It's a relaxing pose after so long as a footstool. One of your favorite parts of subbing is being on display. You love having your Masters look at and admire your nakedness and you adore seeing their eager faces as they look up from a towel they're folding and stare for a moment directly at your pussy. You get wet just thinking about it and you wonder if they can see from their angle that you are wetter than before. You wonder if your pink pussy is spread and glistening, if any moisture is starting to drip from the opening. Even thinking about your wet pussy makes you even wetter.
"Don't blame it on me Malfoy!" Harry scowled getting angry. "When I told you that it was on the highest shelf and I couldn't reach it, you completely ignored me." Harry's height has always been an insecurity of his. The fact that Ginny was always complaining that they were exactly the same height really egged him on. He didn't need Malfoy, who stood at a whopping 6'0 compared to Harry's 5'5, to rub it in his face.
Ron muttered in disagreement but didn't say anything.
"Oh it's you...." he muttered unable to meet Malfoy's gaze. The git was still arrogant and pompous. After all, it was Malfoy's fault that Harry was stuck like this, but his new condition only allowed for him to think of Malfoy's cock, preferably up his arse.
"Pet me!" Harry shrieked. "She's right you know mate," Ron had said, "Merlin! Can't believe I'm agreeing with 'Mione!"
"It's true Ron," Hermione said cutting in, "besides Harry was having the time of his life if you hadn't noticed, I highly doubt that he won't enjoy this."
"Harry mate, you've got to tell us who your new girlfriend is!" Dean called out from where he was lounging on his bed, making no attempt whatsoever to get dressed.
"A little birdie?" Ron inquired raising his eyebrows.
Draco continued to stimulate Harry's cock as he peppered Harry's chest with kisses. Finally, Draco kissed him quickly and said, "Turn around for me, Harry."
Harry blushed before standing on his tiptoes, as he was considerably much shorter than Draco, and lightly kissing Draco's plush, full lips. That seemed to have shaken Draco out of his daze. He wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and hauled him into the air, plunging his tongue into Harry's mouth and deepening the kiss. Harry submitted into the kiss, allowing Draco to explore the caverns of his mouth as he wrapped his arms around Draco's neck.
"Oh shut up, Potter! Give me the stirring rod! I will not tolerate you ruining my potion's grade any longer!"
Draco spoke softly to him, "come on, Harry you adorable little thing. You've managed to make all your straight little friends want to fuck you." Draco smirked, kissing Harry's unruly hair. "That's a good thing."
"Unfortunately, yes," Parkinson said jumping in, "Which is why we are all in the mood for some good fucking."
It was Padma's turn to ask and her bottle landed on Hermione. She gave Hermione a wicked smile before innocently asking, "Truth or Dare, 'mione?"
Ron seemed to have just registered what he just said and turned sympathetically to Justin and Terry, who were both openly out.
"Mate?" Harry asked him confused.
Draco hadn't even notice Madam Pomfrey drop by the potions on the nightstand. Draco dozed off to sleep, his eyelids fluttering heavily to the cute squeaks coming out of Harry.
"Okay fine I might have overheard Dobby blabbering to the other house-elves when I went to the kitchens to get a snack before dinner. How Dobby knows about any of this, I have no idea."
Zabini smirked, "That's right. From the looks of it, you two are enjoying yourselves immensely. So Draco, I dare you to fuck Potter."
"Ohh," Harry muttered, "Ummm okay truth."
"Is the Weaslette that terrible at sex?" Came Malfoy's now even deeper voice, right near Harry's ear. Harry rolled his eyes, "Malfoy, her name is Ginny."
Harry was sure that his mouth would catch flies, out of everything that had happened that evening, this would surely cross the line. But no one was saying anything, they were just staring at Draco and Harry.
The game continued, and with Parkinson complaining that it was getting boring as no one was picking dare, a new rule was established, claiming that truth couldn't be picked twice in a row.
"Awww," Harry said, "you've gone soft." Draco scowled and spanked Harry again earning a squeak from the shorter boy. "I have not gone soft Harry Potter!" he countered. Harry turned back to look at him again, "Well I like the new you, and I think Hermione would be open to forgiving you, I don't know how Ron will take it, but he is a brother to me and I know that he'll come around sooner or later."
