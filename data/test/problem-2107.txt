Harry listened to all of this in mild shock, partly from the idea itself, partly from the fact that it was rather obvious to him too, now that he actually thought about it.
“Potter," Malfoy drawled, "either you answer the damn thing or let me destroy it. Either way, get it as far away from my son as possible, it's upsetting him.”
year, nor did he attend the Ministry's belated N.E.W.T.s. He cut off all contacts with his school friends, closed down the Manor and virtually ran away from Britain. Not that Harry cared, of course. He might have let his mind drifted to a certain blond once or twice during the first few weeks back at Hogwarts, but that was it. He did not care when one of the tables lacked a familiar blond head, he did not care when no school nemesis tormented him between classes, he did not care when he went on his merry way into Auror training as soon as he stepped a foot off the Hogwarts Express, leaving behind his subdued Slytherin cohort.
It ended all too soon when the door creaked open again. Harry popped his head back in to find Malfoy bouncing their baby son happily, just like before. He walked back into the room, mumbled a half-hearted excuse at which Malfoy did not question, as if he had not heard him at all. “You seem tired”, Harry said as he weaved his fingers into the blond strands, the usually perfect hair now matted together with sweat. “You try giving birth to a baby this size, 'tired' doesn't even begin to describe it”, Malfoy retorted back, a grimace on his face. “You should lay down for a bit. I'll take him back to the Mediwitch”, Harry suggested as he reached out towards the baby.
Harry went back to Hogwarts for 8th year and found the student body missing half of its familiar faces, but no absence was more obvious to him than a green tie and a pair of grey eyes. The House of Slytherin had always had fewer students than others, but now the small group was even more shrunken and more heavily shunned by the rest of the student body. Despite that, everything else seemed to be almost normal. Schoolwork was still a bitch and everyone groaned about upcoming exams, as if the War was just a long distant memory. It was the same for Harry, who floated through the days with only thoughts of the NEWTs on his mind, wanting nothing more than to finish the school year and go on with his life. He did however find that his Potions skill had miraculously improved, which helped him sail through exams and propelled him into Auror training without a hitch. He also developed a taste for Blood Quills, which had Ron scrunching up his nose in disgust.
When Harry later helped Diane and newly-named Albus down St. Mungo's hall for check-out, he took a glance behind his back and realised that James was born in that very room.
“Well, that's a very interesting story. You see, your mother and I were very much in love. Because we loved each other so much, one day mum was gifted with you. You stayed in mum's warm belly and nine months later a little James was born out of love.”
Later still, once the excitement of the day had somewhat died down, Harry finally addressed the disturbing little detail that had been bothering him all day.
“I don't know what it is that James told you about them, but these, urgh, 'memories' that he gave me, are all bunch of bollocks! Clearly it was just another pathetic trick by Malfoy to get at me, I can't believe that he still aims to do that after his death, the bastard! You know how much rivalry was involved with us back in Hog-”
Harry heard his son's not-so-subtle hitched breath. James did not look taken aback when he heard his father's words, more like he did not realise that Harry required a speech to understand whatever it was that had been hanging over them all evening. He finally lowered his gaze down to the carpet and let out a heavy sigh, burrowing his fingers into his hair, a sign of distress that he inherited from his father. For a long moment, James said nothing, but then he stood up from the sofa, walked up to a cupboard and opened one of the shelves. The door effectively blocked off the content of the shelf, but Harry could hear glass or ceramic clinking as James rummaged through them. After a while, he retrieved two considerable-sized boxes and brought them towards Harry. He dropped the boxes on the coffee table between them and returned to his seat. James slowly opened one of them and, to Harry's surprise, revealed a Pensive. James moved on to open the other, which was full of small vials of silvery memories. For a while, James just stared at the vials in silent, which did nothing more to explain the situation. When Harry finally decided to ask, James suddenly looked up.
There was once a bad Wizard named Lord Voldermort, who hated Muggles and wanted to create a Wizard-only world. Father and Mother used to believe in his preaching, but eventually at some point they realised what an astonishingly terrible idea that was. Plus, Lord Voldie had the tendency to torture and kill people for no legitimate reason, and what if one day he turned mad (madder?) and hurt them too? At that point however, his parents were way too deep in Voldie’s camp to just simply walk away without repercussion, so they asked for help from Voldie’s arch-nemesis, Albus Dumbledore and his Order of Phoenix. Dumbledore agreed to help them, but in exchange for clemency and protection his parents had to acquiesce to a one-way bonding ritual, in which the soul of each of their family member was to be linked to that of an Order member. In essense, this would allow the recipient to automatically draw upon their bonded’s life force to enhancer their own power in extreme conditions. Traditionally, such exchange could drain the donor’s power to the point of depleting their magic and even killing them, but as a sign of leniency to the family, a stipulation was added so that such bond could not take all of one’s life force. For the three members of the Malfoy family, including a year-old Draco at the time, the Potters, whose patriarch was Dumbledore’s second-in-command and whose immediate family was conveniently also composed of three people, were chosen as the recipients. Then, mere days before the ritual that was meant to happen, James and Lily Potter were killed, leaving behind their young son miraculously unharmed. In the midst of confusion, the last ritual was hastily put together and before the Potter boy was whisked off to his new home, among the ruins of Godric’s Hollows, his soul was forever linked to that of a sleeping blond-haired child not much older than himself.
Harry climbs off him and they face each other once more. The air is sizzling with a competitive energy, as though it’s evolved to a point where the physical contact is merely punctuating their conversation.
Would that be enough of a peace offering, as it had been before? An olive branch to move past his awkward reaction towards whatever thread their friendship is holding on by? But no, if he was almost frozen with the fear of running into him upon arriving at Spoonfuls, it would be unwise to walk to his doorstep.
The first thing that Harry registers is the datedness of the space and the strange feeling of crossing the threshold, which is a lifeless, energy-sucking one. The walls are vertically-panelled wood, the floor a muddy orange carpet. There’s an old tan skirted couch at the centre that Lucrezia sits on, legs crossed casually, but the rest of the furniture is pushed closer to the walls and covered in sheets.
“I’ll be right back,” he promises, making quick work of clearing the dishes and running upstairs for his case papers. When he returns, he sits far enough from Draco for them both to have room to spread out their things.
Slowly, gingerly, Harry pushes both of their hands up Draco’s arm along with his sleeve and places his own back softly over the exposed scar. It’s raised, strangely smooth, and he stays there nervously until he sees that Draco’s not going to pull back.
“Mmhm, because there aren’t any. Only good things, really fucking good things,” he murmurs close to his ear. His pace picks up and Harry inhales, mouth falling open. “Don’t start an argument you can’t finish, Potter.”
“He was looking for you. He came by, interrupted my Tom Cruise film, interrogated my intentions, then beat me at chess and left. Charming as ever.”
His thoughts wander as he throws kick after kick at the bag, and it swings back obtusely, croaking under the weight of its chain and his aggravations.
Leonard blinks once in allowance and Malfoy thanks him, stepping even closer. When he begins fumbling in his pockets, looking satisfied when his hand reemerges with change, Harry’s forehead creases in confusion, but relaxes when he efficiently transforms a sickle into a small spoon.
dinner had even ended, Harry had never been invited or brought along an entirely new sector of schoolmates, and his book had never experienced such a wide first release. All of which led to a glamorous event of a size he’d been unprepared for.
“I’ve pulled files on anyone who’s supported the probationary release of Death Eaters or said anything laudatory about Death Eaters and Voldemort. The problem is, those files are the centre of a Venn diagram of everyone who’d support you having a second lease at life for both the right
Draco’s been sipping on his tea quietly while Harry devoured a slice of lemon pound cake, speaking between mouthfuls about his affinity for gift giving. It seems, the way he tells it, that after early years of hardly giving or receiving presents, it’s a gift in itself to have the opportunity now. His exaggerated gestures almost knock his coffee onto the Spoonfuls floor more than once, beaming as he speaks about some of his best finds; ideas he’d scrawled onto napkins and work forms as they came to him over the year. To get a present from Harry seemed to be a grand occasion.
His ribs feel sore and aching, his hips tender, but the water is a soothing, pounding stream on his muscles, and he barely thinks about it when his hand slides lower, sighing into his own touch. It must be recalling the locker room getting to him, he considers, imagining flashes of long hair and a scruffy jaw, hard metal on his back.
“Hi, furball,” he murmurs, feeling faint. Dante meows back in greeting then butts his head against Draco’s shins and meows again.
Looking into his mother’s eyes, Draco suddenly remembers the exact words she had owled him when arranging the visit ages ago:
“Something… helpful. Proof. That Murray’s doing this. The evidence… in his office or… somewhere else,” he stammers out.
Harry is stupidly drunk by the time he leaves Hogsmeade, as made obvious when, after apparating home to find a note from Draco’s eagle owl inviting him to take his cursed objects back, he immediately disapparates with a second crack to land outside his flat.
As one, the ballroom bursts into action, multiple Aurors running towards Agnes then halting in their tracks, hesitant to touch her. The security attendants to the side of the stage sweep towards Harry, muscling him back towards curtained safety even as he fights to stay in the action.
James' wedding was on a beautiful April Sunday, in the homey Weasley backyard. The new bride's family was extremely scandalised when the couple first announced the wedding location. The Warringtons were just about to denounce the wedding when the bride herself, black-haired Diane with her Veela-like smile, blackmailed her own family into acquiescence. Needless to say, she became an instant favourite among the Weasleys despite her being an obvious Slytherin. On the wedding day itself, the girl shocked both families by wearing red and green streaks in her hair, looking audaciously contrasting to her traditional pure white dress. The red streaks would hiss like a snake now and then, while the green ones bounded themselves into a braid that roared on the hour. After the hiss and the roar accidentally sounded off in the middle of the vow and successfully stunned the entire audience for several seconds, James and Diane burst into uncontrollable laughter that was soon joined by the rest of the guests, saving the bride's flushing parents who glared at Harry for long minutes as if he was the one corrupting their daughter. Harry honestly could not care less and vowed solemnly at the reception that 17
The murderous thoughts chased Harry all the way home, but the moment he saw Ginny practically jumping with anticipation when he handed her the photo of their baby, they all vanished. He was once again drowned in Ginny's happiness and thought no more of the dark bedroom or the blond man he had left behind.
“This was Sirius’?” Ron holds it closer, inspects the charm front and back. It’s smooth once more; its task managed.
to dance,” Harry offers, even as he places his hand in Draco’s. “You may have the honour of some crushed toes.” It’s guided to Draco’s shoulder, his right hand in Draco’s left.
“Any last words for India?” he asks, only half-joking, as they approach the Portkey point of departure thirty minutes later.
you,” Seamus says as he pulls up a chair. He is, of course, pointing to the same table of young women who seem all too star-struck to have Harry’s entire table now looking their way.
“Yeah, yeah. ‘We can’t be nothing. We have to be something.’ It meant a lot to me—made me want to kiss you—and I know what you were trying to say. You can think it’s fate or destiny or what have you that brought us together, but we have to keep us together.”
“Alright, so how does this tracing thing work?” Ron asks when the door shuts. “Can you do it better when you take your time?”
But the sound of his contentedness clears his mind enough to send his heart beating in a panic yet again. Like he’s come from a trance, he lifts his head slightly and Harry’s hand comes with it.
He wraps his hand around his glass and stares at it while he scratches his finger along the decorative grooves, but he doesn’t raise it off the table.
A snort, from directly to Harry’s right. He turns to the seat normally occupied by Ron, but the man seated there is looking intently at the quill and planner on the table before him.
Now, he levitates the cursed copy of his book out of its evidence box, throwing a shield between Harry and the rest of the table for peace of mind. At the addition of the shield, Harry looks up from the notes with hesitant interest.
Their home is cosy, tucked back at the end of a street in Holloway. It’s not surprising to anyone that Ron and Hermione would leave Hogwarts and build such a warm, inviting space. After school, it quickly became the place to be, and once a year on Christmas Eve the living room and kitchen filled with a sea of red hair, baked goods, and warbling Celestina Warbeck. Besides the Burrow itself, the Holloway house feels like home to Harry.
“Teddy, I always want to see you. Don’t pull that. Guilting us won’t work. Draco will fly with you.”
He showers quickly. Before he’s even stepped back onto the bathroom tile he’s forgotten it all, mind reduced again to
Ron doesn’t stop beaming the entire time as he invites Harry to a celebratory dinner the following night, which he enthusiastically accepts. They eat together weekly, if they have time, but seldom out, and hardly ever with something so worth commemorating.
He wakes even more on the bed, under soft hands and the beautiful razor-cut features drawn across Draco’s face from the sliver of light peeking out of the bathroom. They make love slow, without hurry or hesitation—the comfortable quiet and leisureliness that the cabin seems to evoke. Whispered words, breathy laughs, long sighs. He falls into an easy slumber again after, weighed down by Draco’s limbs over him.
Harry’s nodding vigorously as if this was everything he wanted to say and more. Quickly, Draco gives up on the careful considerations and focused attention that he gave last time. Harry is moving with a desperate keenness, his kisses hard, the nips to Draco’s neck sharp and insistent. And so he loses himself, in the rhythm, the mind-numbing feeling of Harry against him, growing and growing until everything tightens and then doesn’t, a moment of bliss more complete than he’s felt all week.
. It was nine, ten years from now, yeah? But we’d never made up, so… I spotted you across the Hogwarts platform and all we did was give each other polite nods.”
Ron’s cheeks are as red as his hair, and he snatches the robes closed as fast as he can. “It was a funny gift for Hermione once,” he whinges. “Rose was up early and I had to leave so fast and… you’re having a laugh!”
“Ah, well. We didn’t properly spend time together for at least thirty-six hours. I shouldn’t even be gone that long.”
The Four Johns is unsurprisingly crowded for a Friday evening, and Harry begins to worry that he won’t be able to find a seat for himself. He clutches
He stills at the kitchen counter, turns and fixes Draco with an interested expression. Then, almost prissily, he crosses his arms and tilts his head, inquiring him to continue.
Harry speaks high-pitched and fluttery. “I have my jewels and my honour. They can take me from the court but they can’t take who I am.”
Dante is hissing wildly at his feet, and his thoughts are taken over with concern that they’ll hurt him or take him, but the woman just looks down disgustedly and muscles Draco towards the door. She slams it behind him, cutting him off from Harry, and for a moment Draco is eye to eye with Magnus Murray in the hallway, grinning with a dark glint in his eye.
“Are you joking? I need to dive in deeper. I have to find a new specialist—if you still have those recommendations, I’d love them. Though you
“Alright, let him go,” he says with his hands up, significantly less on edge than Harry. “But this is your case. You decide how you want it to look to all of… them.” He gestures vaguely in all directions.
He sees his black-socked feet before anything more identifiable and breaks out into an easy smile as the man leans in front of the fireplace.
Jack’s own hand, meanwhile, has moved to grip Harry’s waist, his mouth on his neck, and the chorus hushes. He smells good, like coffee and deodorant. Harry, on the other hand, is on the back end of a workout. He finds himself immensely preoccupied worrying whether he smells like sweat and eggs.
, cursed so extremely that if Mr Potter here were to look and say, ‘A gift! How kind!’ and touch it himself, he would lose his life.”
He has a moment, then, sitting across from Harry, who’s brought him water and felt his forehead and cared so deeply. And beyond that, has been an impressive Auror despite the personal complications this case has brought him. There’s a crashing feeling in his chest, of overwhelming emotion.
Honestly, Harry’s a little surprised that Draco’s not panicking just a little, too. If he’s going out of his way to make Harry feel comfortable around him, to prove that he’s not bothered that he’s gay, he wants to reassure him that it’s okay to be a little uncomfortable sometimes. Normal. For example, Harry is currently very uncomfortable. Mostly with his own feelings.
Rose looks at Ron’s outstretched hand but circumvents him to hug her mum, who gives her a big squeeze and a loud kiss with a ‘mwah’. Ron’s hand stays extended towards her patiently as she continues round the table to Harry, who leans down and kisses the top of her head twice, then nudges her back towards her dad.
constructive to do with that,” Harry groans against his neck. He kisses him once, then twice, meeting his eyes, and just the look of them, lazed and distracted, makes him appear less intense than he has all day long. “Do you want me to…”
Harry chuckles and turns to watch the crackling fire. If he doesn’t keep his mind busy, he meanders back to the nightmare. To his breakup with Ginny, and the last time he’d felt this one-track-minded about someone.
“Ah, that leads to the second discovery I didn’t add to the form.” He puts the book back in with the evidence and lowers the shield. “I fixed the dating spell. The book was cursed days in advance, but the flowers were cursed
He looks around, hands shaking, and he can’t unlock the door—it can only do that for her—but he can lay his hand flat to it. That magic,
After that, things quickly speed up. They each get a couple of shots in, feet to ribs, fists to chins. Harry whoops out loud when Draco swings proficiently into a roundhouse kick that hooks Jack’s neck and sends him tumbling to the ground on his back.
Draco traipses back up the stairs slowly and sleepily, and after a few deep breaths, Harry returns the preface to the table, extinguishes the fire, and follows. The bedroom is dark still, and quiet except for Draco’s rustling as he tries to get comfortable again, and Harry almost misses the strange sound coming from the dresser he’d set his things on.
He turns, walking in the direction opposite Harry’s place for ten or fifteen paces, then expertly disapparates midstride.
, he thinks. To not be afraid of the hard questions. And judging from how Narcissa closes her eyes like he’d given her a sudden toothache, this was one of them. She takes a deep, calming breath, before answering.
find that funny at all, obviously.” With that, he holds Draco’s eyes sternly, as if he’s being scolded. “I just mean it’s funny to hear you chat up anyone.
“See the arithmancy, I know, I’ve brought it. But—Professor, I tried it on the Imperius river rock and all was just fine. Then I tried it on the Cruciatus skull and I had—it… did not work,” he says insistently, hoping his tone tells the rest of the story. “I don’t know why I failed.”
There’s no sign off this time. He doesn’t need one. Harry already recognises the loopy script, indicative of a plush childhood with activities like penmanship classes, and he runs back upstairs for the initial note, which he slides into his back pocket.
With a long, deep breath, Draco thinks platonic thoughts and leans on the desk directly opposite Harry. “In my defence, it’s September.”
He doesn’t know what came over him, but Jack was taller and fitter than he’d expected somehow and he had that bloody bun that made him think of Simon and his ponytail and to see him standing there with such ease annoyed him, but watching the way he looked at Harry when Harry wasn’t looking back absolutely sent him into a rage.
” he roars. Harry freezes, eyes wide with his teacup halfway to his lips. “I thought you were a professional Auror! DON’T TOUCH A CURSE SPECIALIST’S THINGS! Don’t touch
She doesn’t speak, but her face is crossed with something contemplative. Harry can’t decipher it, and decides to call it amused annoyance. It disappears quickly, as she drags him from his office.
Draco purposefully focuses on preparing the evidence for the test, avoiding the disarming eye contact he knows awaits him if he turns. “It’s really none of your business, you shouldn’t ask such personal questions.”
Draco rolls his eyes, grumbling “You started it,” even as he listens, padding down the carpeted stairs. Harry stands in the hallway, an entire dresser drawer in his hands. The sight catches him by surprise and sends his eyebrows up.
“Stop, Harry. I’m sorry, I’m sick of that. We got here—to making each other feel like shit—because we convinced ourselves that you fall into things and they work or they don’t, no?”
“Not for sure,” he offers, cautious. If Blaise has taught him anything, it’s to stay mute until evidence is presented.
“You don’t get it. Jacob’s dreadful and he doesn’t wash his hands after the loo. And I don’t think I fancy boys anyway.”
Harry opens his mouth to banter back when a sharp knock sounds on the door. They both snap their heads towards the sound, Harry with curiosity, Draco a bit more paralyzed.
Draco spins on the spot, putting his hands on Harry’s shoulders and holding him an arm’s length away. He’s not angry, how could he be when the contention is how much Harry cares? And he knows from experience that it can be harder to see someone you care for in danger than to be in danger yourself—this is, after all, the second attempt on Harry’s life in recent history. So he speaks sternly but carefully, honestly but kindly.
Draco stops the investigation there, feeling it too soon to spend exorbitant time examining his features. The book in his hand, however, seems like fair play, so he answers Harry’s bizarre question with one of his own.
He lowers himself into the reading chair, summoning some gingersnap biscuits and water from the kitchen. Instead of resting, he looks back through the maths for the de-escalation charm he’d been working through before the banquet.
“I was asking Harry if you were a good sport when he took you to go boxing, or whatever it’s called.”
my books, you self-centred toad. But my friendship with Luna... I don’t know. I don’t often just… offer personal information freely, if you hadn’t realised. It’s the habitus of a very private individual—“ He watches Harry’s face flash with offence. “Not you, Harry. Just as not Pansy or Blaise. But it’s hard to break. You understand?”
His eyes then caught the sight of a brilliant golden field, lit up with a little bit of sunlight that had escaped through the cracks of the closed window. He watched as dust motes floated like flecks of snow against the background of wheat and sky, with a single road winding its way through the field, its far end disappearing into the threading sheaves of wheat. In the middle of the frame, a murder of crows took flight, their black long wings hanging mid-air like kites. When he purchased that painting many years ago, he was told that the painting depicted sorrow and solitude. Yet, whenever he looked at it, all he could feel was a hopeful promise.
His eyes, though, are staring into Harry’s so considerately, waiting for his word, and his hand is warm and it’s nice, to feel connected, so he smiles. “It’s fine.”
It hurt to see Potter and his posse’s faces in the Prophet just about every day for a while, always in headlines referring to him as “Hero Potter” or “Savior Potter,” as if they needed to clarify which Harry Potter they meant. Meanwhile, he was shunned, forced to spend his waking hours in the same home where Voldemort had tormented his family.
They don’t even touch the attic. Draco has enough work to parse through first, all sitting ominously in a box that Harry has hoisted helpfully on his right hip. Now with a greater sense of just how much Dark energy sat in the home, a physical weight seems to lift from his shoulders when they reappear into the fresh air.
On the fourth floor, he thinks Draco notices his hesitation. There’s only two bedrooms on this floor: Regulus’ and Sirius’.
Harry tries to hide his own nervousness, and in the process, finds himself repeatedly breaking the comfortable silence and sound of their shuffling feet on pavement to mention things he thinks Draco should know.
It’s Harry’s treat but Teddy’s choice for dinner, which unfortunately means Nando’s, and Harry sits across from his burger with some sort of chicken pitta, listening to all the updates from school, Teddy’s friends, and his football club.
He opens his eyes again, blood pumping a little slower. Resolutely, he pats Ron’s shoulder and kisses Hermione’s cheek. If he doesn’t move fast, he’ll lose his nerve completely.
“Back up, Potter,” he instructs mildly. Harry does, confused but compliant. He can’t imagine what he’d done wrong by standing quiet.
So shocked is Harry to see Draco laying there that his first thoughts are Muggle ones; a heart attack, or some sort of fainting spell. He’s flat on his back on the tile floor—the shower already running, thrumming noisily on the half-empty toiletries now scattered around the tub floor—eyes open wide but looking past Harry as if he’s a ghost.
Harry’s eyes are full of emotion, wide and shiny and rapt. Draco’s hands tighten just a little where they rest on the backs of Harry’s knees.
Draco frowns. “I assumed you knew. That you’d told her about us, but I wasn’t going to care. We were broken up; you could tell whoever you needed.”
They’re a few minutes from the high street—this has kept Harry at ease considering it’s a Saturday afternoon—so when Ron speaks almost apologetically about trying to find a place for lunch away from the usual Diagon haunts, he dismisses him quickly with a wave.
When he makes his way to the front again with all his non-bizarre, non-eccentric ingredients, he stops short in surprise to see Harry leaning on the counter, chatting jovially with Hugh.
“That’s fine, I expected you might have trouble with that kind of mobility, but it is perfectly normal at this stage, not a major concern.” His voice raises at the end, no doubt for poor Virginia’s benefit. “I’m going to have to do it myself if you’ll allow me. It should be safe to touch you—you’re no longer touching the cursed object.”
Lars experiments with contact first, throwing a leg towards Harry that he quickly dodges. Lars always strikes first. It leaves him open early—he shouldn’t be so quick to pounce—and Harry sends a hook towards his jaw haphazardly while he catches his own balance, which Lars narrowly escapes. They circle like this, sending light kicks and missed swings, until Harry finds his opening and quickly switches his stance. His right leg pivots in a roundhouse kick, landing his shin powerfully against Lars’ torso.
“You needed Murray?” she asks now, shaking him from his exploration. She’s multitasking by stamping and signing forms while she speaks.
Jack shrugs as if it’s the simplest problem ever. “You care about making things right. You’re a good person,” he says.
She hums in scepticism and beckons for Dante—she always gives him more attention than Draco. Only once he’s mentioned holding a cell phone while two shirtless men pummeled each other a few feet away does he win her full focus. She cackles, Dante bounced lightly in her lap with her shaking laugh.
His head snaps up abruptly, eyes meeting Draco so coldly that it takes his breath away. “You know what I’ve found? People who have to beg for a chance to explain have probably already caused enough hurt for the reasoning not to matter anymore.”
Teddy dives instead of waiting for an answer, so Draco follows, the wind whistling past his ears. They pull up and rise again together. “I did.”
He’d also popped back through the floo to his and sent a note to Hermione, realising with a sense of remorse that if Pansy was calling Draco too busy lately and she’d at least seen him a time or two, his own friendships were long overdue.
“I’ve written the basic warding, if you could check that over first, and then supplement as you see fit,” she says.
He walks directly to Ron’s desk, where his friend hasn’t even had a chance to sit down yet. Ron turns to him with an excited smile so contagious that Harry’s grinning back before he’s even heard the news.
He clearly hadn’t been thinking about that at all until she pointed it out. Personally, Draco thinks the staring might still be more related to recognition, but Harry rubs his hands flat along the seat of his pants and glances around, everywhere but at Draco.
He sits up completely, hears Draco hiss with the sudden shift of their bodies, and glares down. “That’s not funny today.”
In a moment of paranoia, he almost thinks he sees Flitwick’s eyes flick to his arm, but the small man looks towards the ceiling in thought so quickly.
He shifts his wand quickly from his sleeve and yanks Teddy back into the air before he hits the ground with his broom. Thankfully, he lands lightly on his back, and Draco dives speedily down towards him.
Draco nods, and his gaze drifts past Harry to the locker room entranceway. He hears them before he sees them; Lars and Jack laughing in easy camaraderie.
.” Draco laughs, looking up at him like he’s just invented fire. “I wasn’t even reading this book for the skull. How brilliant!”
Impossible to forget, though he’ll admit that some of the details are a little fuzzy. Collapsing onto Draco’s mattress isn’t one of them.
He manages to sit up and smiles in polite greeting. “Hello, Harry. Hope I’m not interrupting; I’ve just got a question regarding your Auror training and whether I’m correctly remembering that it involved healing in the field?”
He’d hurt Draco. Must have, because it had been his goal at the moment and had ended with a door shut hard in his face. He’d wanted him to feel as bad as Harry had felt imagining Emilia, which was ridiculous because days before Draco had told him outright that he didn’t care for her. And since when had he been such a jealous person? Never with Ginny.
“Blimey,” Ron mutters, picking at his sandwich. “This not being a direct repercussion for Draco Malfoy’s behaviour is truly the largest twist of all, and
“Yes…” Draco keeps his eyes on the uncomfortable-looking man standing across from him, who seems both intent on leaving immediately and staying to supervise Draco. “Sit,” he adds, to save him from the decision.
The Ministry event planner had arranged the tables and settings with magic, meaning that no one had touched the silverware between the storerooms and Agnes’ fated touch. And Harry couldn’t blame anyone for the lack of security, surveillance, or record in regards to the Ministry storeroom. There was no precedent to need such things for folding tables and silverware. Harry was feeling overwhelmed again very quickly. He wondered how long Malfoy would take to respond, if he did so at all.
“I don’t care for the assumption that I can’t survive this department without you,” grumbles Harry, unlocking the door and pulling the chair Hermione had just returned to the window an hour ago back across from his desk.
-ly unbearable,” he grumbles, reaching a hand under his shirt. It catches on a chain around Harry’s neck, surprisingly, but it doesn’t take serious deduction skills to know it’s Sirius’. He hears Harry suck in the tiniest breath, and moves on quickly with his hand to save him from the conversation; it’s some sort of comfort during this, and who’s he to judge a comfort even while he ignores his
“Yes, er, the Junior Aurors are all doing well, it’s been weeks since a case report has crossed my desk that didn’t faultlessly corroborate their Auror partner’s report. And I had a request for a witness to be Obliviated from…” He quickly flips through the pages to find what he’s looking for. “Porter?”
His mind is buzzing. He thanks Cassie—can’t thank her enough. Part of him had thought she might have no connection at all, considering the simpler nature of her curse, but instead he’s beginning to formulate a picture; a curser strapped for time, reaching frantically for a light curse and a motive that, in practise, has holes.
There’s more heavy laughter, some glancing back to find him by Mari after the joke, and he shakes his head affably for their benefit. When he lifts his gaze and spots the guest of honour speaking to another Auror across the room, it takes one barely-tilted head towards the door for Ron to signal an exit, and Harry nods imperceptibly back. Ron excuses himself from a conversation and Harry does the same within a minute, meeting him just outside his office.
He considers lying again, but that doesn’t seem genuine, and so he provides a vaguely true answer instead, shrugging. “Just… jittery.”
“Huh. Sit.” He steps back into the hallway between the two rooms and levitates the skull from one to the other, setting it before the man who’d sat obediently at one head of the table. “Anything?”
In the kitchen, he swoops elegantly around the space, closing low cabinets with his heel, cutting the chicken and adding it with the pop of oil to a skillet. The knife moves with speed and precision in his hand, and Draco moves closer to stand with his elbows on the counter, watching from the dining side of the divider. He reaches over for a jar of paprika.
The furniture is a dark wood, as antiqued as the rest of the rooms, with another desk by the window. Harry wonders if there’s a single room in this flat that Draco hadn’t transformed into a workspace. If he had his wits about him, he might realise that the bed’s not made, but rather hastily tidied; Draco had been sleeping.
“It’s not demonstrative of your skill,” Harry is assuring him, face still filled with cautious concern like Draco’s a live grenade.
She points a shaking finger towards the aisle of shelves to their right, just past the entrance and till. The sign hovering above reads
He’s just closing his locker and zipping up his knapsack when Jack arrives, looking surprisingly disappointed to see him.
Her eyebrows draw close and she bites her lip. Ron interjects, “Well, I think everything we know about Malfoy implies ignorance. The ‘It’s a date’ comment didn’t seem like you just ‘being the closest punching bag’. Sounds personal. Sounds like a git.”
He starts walking towards the west entrance. Draco has to pick up his pace to catch up. “I didn’t ask,” he challenges under his breath.
Legs already halfway to a jelly consistency, he decides on the rowing machine. For a while he rows meditatively, thighs and calves burning wonderfully, back muscles constricting, as he imagines himself on some expansive lake, far from London, rowing kilometres and kilometres without interruption.
“He’s a prick, then. You’re clearly sorry.” He stands, folding his coat over his arm. “I think I’m going to head out.”
He lifts his chin high at his name, shoulders back as she approaches, hexes his wand from his hand, and produces a binding spell to tie his wrists behind his back. “You’re under arrest for five counts of attempted murder. You do not have to say anything. Anything you do say may be given in evidence…”
Once or twice, Harry gave him extremely apologetic eye contact, and he did his best to convey that he doesn’t care. That someone who checks every box in Narcissa Malfoy’s list of qualities for a perfect son-in-law would be someone he doesn’t wish to be with.
Of course, they’re apprehensive that there’s any way to fight a corrupt authority figure at the Ministry—especially if the Head Auror and his number two are both involved. Harry’s offering of the parchment list to Blaise had seemed to spark hope, but the optimism doubles when he mentions Hermione’s interest in helping.
“Luna?” Hermione guesses. Pansy knocks back her chair and runs to the door, throwing her arms around the approaching blonde with such enthusiasm that Neville takes a step back in astonishment and gives them a wide berth as he approaches the table.
His hands pull at the skin under his eyes, then over his cheekbones, investigating his appearance in the reflection. His dress robes hang waiting on the door and Pansy lounges quietly in the next room.
After another moment, his eyes reopen and he slides his wand from his sleeve with a twitch of his arm, reciting another spell and tapping the book. It shoots out a series of fiery red sparks, which Harry assumes are some sort of confirmation.
“It happening in the office, you mean?” Cassie says, and in her face he sees a relief that someone’s acknowledging that she’d been cursed in the safety of her workplace. It must have been terrifying.
In the end, he only takes one. Draco selfishly hopes it’s a ploy to come back—he’s annoying yet fascinating. And it would be nice, perhaps, to have company beside Pansy and Blaise now and again. He walks Harry to the fireplace, pressing a pack of gingersnaps into his hand as he approaches the hearth.
He watches as Malfoy holds one hand up close to the shelf, long fingers extended like a fan, and closes his eyes with a delicate but intense focus. Then he sighs and drops it.
When she releases him from her bosom, her eyes are shiny. “Oh dear, I told Arthur I would make it a single Christmas day through without getting emotional, but here you go, and we’ve not even had dinner yet,” she says. “Come, come, I’ve told Bill you’re coming—he was asking after you last night, Ron and Hermione’s Christmas Eve dinner—but we’ll be intercepted a dozen times before we find him and Fleur.”
“I see you, Pans, take it easy!” He shouts back right as the crowd roars, startling him into checking the score curiously. The England v. Scotland game is playing with commentary over the speakers, but besides some patrons crowding around the large speaker behind the bar, everyone’s eyes are glued to their tables.
Harry winks. “I hope so.” Then, attached at the wrist to Teddy, he’s carried off, and Draco’s standing alone ten paces from the door with more gifts than he can carry alone.
He’s just about to tell Powell to contact the Ministry curse breakers when the bell tinkles again, a half moment before Harry feels firm hands push him aside. It’s not hostile, but focused.
Just the one and Harry has to roll them up once or twice and suck his stomach in to close them, but he’s filled with fear that Draco will wake and find a pair of trousers missing that Harry hadn’t known were his favourites from some atelier on Bond Street by a designer who's died or given up on fashion or only made three pairs or something else irreplaceable, returned somehow stained from a puddle or coffee or pigeon shite or some other hazard Harry might encounter on his brief adventure downstairs, and regret ever inviting him to stay.
Draco leans down and picks up a pile of books by his feet that Harry hadn’t noticed, adding the textbook on top. Then, with a hint of accusation, he asks, “Why—er, what’re you doing here?”
he thinks. He traces it twice more. Traces along with the office windows, down the outer length of the room, but it’s still lighter, like it’s drifting further away from him. For a moment he thinks,
, Malfoy, yes, I hear you. Wish I couldn’t. We can meet later. Say an hour? I’m starved so would that café below your flat still be alright? Spoonfuls, was it?”
Draco surveys the crowd again, back still securely to the wall, though he doesn’t admit to himself who he’s looking for. And yet he sucks in a breath when he finally spots Potter standing with Weasley by the bar.
’, apparently, which Harry is to trust. Grateful to be here and happy to be pulled along, he doesn’t put up a fight.
Harry looks down with a scowl. He’s dressed in a grey long-sleeve and blue jeans, with his old Gryffindor scarf slung loosely across his shoulders. It’s officially mid-September, and he’s taken a practical, unassuming route.
He looks up swiftly, as if he thought he was invisible. Perhaps surprised to still be consulted post-incident. “Might be,” he says after a moment.
Harry can’t be mad that they’ve circumvented Draco’s protocol. He’s too intrigued. “It feels as strong as a curse, but not malicious,” he says.
“You know,” he lays his second hand on top of her own, one corner of his mouth tipping up. “I’m not always sure, moment to moment. It’s all a bit complicated. But sometimes, yes. Increasingly, yes.”
He leaves her to rush to the kitchen, where he’d left the oven on rather unsafely. “I hope you weren’t waiting too long.”
Meanwhile, his own gaze drifts back to the collar of Harry’s dress shirt, buttoned high, and wonders what occasion called for it. Almost mindlessly, his hand reaches over to the stiff band and fusses with it gently.
“Harry, believe me, we all know it’s just a speech. It’s for charity,” Ron says. “I’ll be the first to tell you if your ego’s gotten excessive. Drink up, calm your nerves—Hermione only sent me through to ask if we were all flooing together.”
“And Hermione was really into the India trip and all the genealogy research. We had coffee yesterday and she talked about the Sacred Twenty-Eight for like, thirty minutes. I bet she’ll even have questions for you.”
What if waiting to reach out to Draco pushes him further away? What if he’s waiting for Harry to reach out? And just as he froze on the spot in the Four Johns, him taking too long now to owl him or go see him was putting him off further?
And yet Harry doesn’t feel that purposeful, stunted affection of trying from before, but something easier. Natural.
Draco props himself up rather abruptly, meeting his eyes for the first time in half an hour. “You know that speech was terrible?”
He walks through the door and removes his robes, draping them on one of the dining chairs as Draco begins to tidy his papers and find the necklace to give him. He’s dressed disconcertingly nicely, in a crisp chocolate-brown dress shirt and tan trousers that Draco’s never seen before, and it distracts him from the excited rambling he’d begun.
Draco’s voice arises suddenly, raspy and soft. His mouth is tipped up slightly, and Harry looks away from Pansy and wonders just how long he’s been listening. “He has more reason to hate me than most. It would kill him to so much as lay a finger on me affectionately if he still felt that way.”
I should hex you here and now. Rounding up from twenty-seven, and after the baser sin of mentioning a woman’s age at all. Shameful. I can’t go over alone. Draco, introduce me.”
“It did, I’ve brought it with me. Thanks again,” he looks to Ron, who nods warmly. He opens his mouth, Harry knows instinctually to apologise again, so he cuts him off with a raised hand. “You said to consider it an apology so I did. It was hugely helpful. I’ve learned a lot.”
Harry’s aware that he can be… romantically clueless. Especially when he’s distracted as he’s been all week. It certainly hadn’t registered until this moment that casually confirming that he was gay last week could change things with such an old friend.
There’s no excuse, really, for what took Harry so long to find these books. Draco didn’t keep them on hand in the study, though he’d caught a glance of them collecting dust up on a top shelf. In his early denial of feeling anything past collegial respect for Draco, it seemed like a fanatic purchase, and when their friendship was deepening it suddenly felt too late to admit that he’d never held them. Today, for some reason, he could think of nothing he wanted more.
Draco can’t even pity laugh. “Indeed… Harry, I’m no Auror, but I think Cassie was a distraction from this. It was too simple.”
Draco’s face says a dozen things at once, but when he finally speaks, he simply says, “Of course,” and Harry lets out a sigh he hadn’t known he was holding. “Owl me again when you have the evidence.”
He turns, grinning, to Harry but the expression switches to startled confusion when Harry tackles him, sending them both to the ground with a contact that knocks the breath from his lungs. The flash of green had just missed—the second aimed at him tonight, and Harry extracts himself from Draco, turns with a ferocity towards Hadrian, who is still kneeling exhaustedly on all fours with his wand pointed across the room at them.
the anti-curse arithmancy. Because it’s mostly there in the diagnostics, so if you can understand the arithmancy from the diagnostics and you know how to deconstruct that… oh, you don’t care. The point is, I have an
, I—“ Draco’s arm is still shaking when Harry gently but urgently takes it. “Y-Yes, okay, yes. Erm. Okay.”
So loud that it might as well have happened right in Draco’s ear, an inhuman scream cuts Potter off, sinking the entire hall into an unnatural silence. He turns in time to see a young woman one table over backing frantically away as her tableware clatters to the ground. She stands, staring unblinkingly at her arms, deep rips appearing as if her skin itself was stretching out. Her eyes are wide in terror.
“They left your shampoo,” Draco offers helpfully, pointing away from the shelves and towards the almost empty bottle balancing on the back corner of the tub.
Draco laughs heartily. “Looks fade, Pans. Your uncanny ability to get any female listener to break up with her shitty boyfriend is eternal.”
The timer will chirp in a few minutes. The cabin is perfectly secluded, but for a moment Harry wishes they had an onlooker outside, a sudden lack of privacy just for the Pensieve memory it would allow him to hold onto; a dark forest, and hanging brightly in the midst like a framed photo, floor to ceiling windows that shine through with yellow hovering candlelight, illuminating the faraway image of two men waltzing, close and easy and moving as one.
“I didn’t think you’d be there, but I’d certainly already resigned myself to not thinking too hard anymore. Not about what could go wrong, how others might react, if they’ll care at all, what the
“—and so now that they’re definitely a go for next year’s games and a shoo-in for the Cup, they wanted to ensure that they had better security.”
“And… he wasn’t persuaded? I think they eventually sent an apologetic letter on their solicitor’s behalf. Explained that they fully understood his desire to keep the land. He took it fine.”
He addresses it to Malfoy Manor and sends it off with his Ministry-provided owl before he can overthink it any further. She’s a tawny owl, short and stout, with feathers patterned like tree bark, delightfully named ‘AUR-06’ by the uncreative, overtly professional Ministry communications department. Harry had shortened it to Orsix, finding the jumble of letters and numbers too impersonal for a creature he personally feeds and houses and sometimes therapises to.
“And it’s their problem. Besides, I’m not exactly on payroll, am I, Potter?” he continues. “The least you could do if you’re keen to turn me into a brownnosing Ministry crony is offer compensation. I know that must be hard to hear for our little saviour. Someone with demands. Surely used to everyone bending over backwards on a moment’s notice.”
“No,” Murray speaks for the first time since Harry began briefing. “We’re not going to jump to conclusions, Miss Shohre.”
Harry watches with interest as he adds the billywig sting to the vessel and uncorks the water to form a paste, quickly charming the pestle to keep grinding as he sprinkles in the octopus powder. A dash more water, then the crushed spine, and then he fluidly ceases his magic on the pestle with his wand in his left hand while he grabs it to mash manually with his right. He works with a natural choreography not dissimilar to Harry in the kitchen.
no hard feelings but he’s been stand-offish ever since. Not that I blame him. Just in case he mentions anything, I don’t want you to feel like I’ve lied to you. I just hadn’t been sure where things stood between us. What we could converse about.”
Carefully, with impressive precision, he manages to tear a page out of the cursed book by wand, float it over to the paste, and charm it to ash. Vaguely, it reminds Harry of muggle vaccinations, incorporating the evil into the cure. Malfoy fully integrates it, and he guesses only a minute has passed while they’ve all stood silently watching with curiosity.
Pansy and Blaise, of course, had gone rushing into his room the second his Auror statement was done, and Harry had exhaled loudly, not bothering to cover his aggravation at this. Hermione had heard, begun to rub his back soothingly, but he’d torn away to pace instead. He’s impatient. Antsy. Dying for Draco’s eyes to meet his with recognition so he can throw out the image of them darting unfocused past his face.
“No, I mean, I—We probably should’ve known when I called my first kiss with Cho Chang ‘wet’. But no, why?”
He’s kept steadily at his pint, but his head is buzzing and he suddenly feels as though more than half the words he’s heard today were Potter’s name. They didn’t topple the Berlin wall, for Circe’s sake. They just became colleagues. It’s not nearly as momentous to him as it seems to be for everyone else.
Ron sucks in air through his teeth, tapping Hermione on the arm. “Well, that one’s a long time coming. Oh, he’s fit. Isn’t he fit, Hermione?”
“Enough sorries,” she says kindly. Then, after a moment of quiet, “We don’t know what it feels like to be you, just like you don’t know what it’s like to be me. Or Neville. Luna. It’s got to be terribly frustrating when you’re
,” he gushes, tracing the glossy wood of the box and then the velvet interior. “I can’t wait to fill it.”
“Did they bring you in for the random curse attacks?” another man questions. “Is that the new case Harry Potter has been investigating? Our sources say the curse in Diagon Alley is connected to others?”
He says this now, heart pounding as if he’s confessed something much more serious. He’s startled to find Harry’s eyes wide and fierce, his right fingers moved to sit contemplatively on his lips as he listened. His exacting expression remains when he speaks.
“Er, no.” Draco hops quickly to his feet. It makes his back twinge and sends his vision spinning a little, but he holds a straight face. “He went into the Ministry. But, oh, he said he was going to look for you later. Maybe he said tomorrow…”
“What do you think they’re talking about?” Teddy asks. He ducks into position for a dive, but Draco flies closer for correction and pushes his shoulders flatter to the broom before he can take off.
“Right. It just feels incredibly belittling to stand in front of them all and take credit. There’s not a more inappropriate crowd to do this to.”
He keeps his eyes transfixed piercingly on Draco’s deft fingers while they work through the second set of buttons, then helpfully shrugs out of the sleeves. When Draco looks up at him, he can’t wait any longer—he reaches forward, holds his face in his hands and kisses him.
They’ve been gone for a good bit. He wonders what everyone inside is thinking, and hopes it’s nothing at all.
“Draco’s just a consistently good dresser, Ron. Don’t consider yourself special,” Harry teases, seating himself.
“What do you mean you ‘had a plan of attack’?” Blaise’s brows are furrowed, his head tilted in friendly interest. Draco quickly tries to surmise just how fine his friend would be with hearing the full truth.
man is on the case!’ If there was ever someone fit to take over from my, er, impending resignation—“
“You weren’t just sitting there. I felt your hands on me the whole time. That was invaluable. It looks worse than it is.”
Harry breathes a careful breath through his nose. “I disagree. But different flyers will coach differently.”
Draco looks over his shoulder to see his spot, then nods approvingly and turns away. While they sit in this quietly shared moment, Harry feels, once again, a deep affection for this friendship he hadn’t expected.
, it says across the top, and then at the bottom, in a font a touch smaller (He’d argued for this; Marta said that by book four, an equal-sized author name was expected),
Draco manages to keep sight of her long enough to clock the visible change in her features and watch the blood slowly levitate off the floor and back towards her flesh, which is slowly seaming itself back together, before his wand shoots from his hand and an Incarcerous spell hits him square in the chest.
“You’re one to talk,” he shoots back instantly. “Haven’t even given me a moment’s peace to inform you that you’re free to go before jumping down my throat.”
He bends Draco’s arm and folds it to his own chest, to the thin fabric over a scar that Harry left once, long ago.
“No, please do. I was just wondering whether they’ll be there when I get back.” He doesn’t elaborate with proper nouns, but Potter nods in understanding, seeming to seriously consider his concern.
“Alright, well, let me know if you change your mind,” Harry says. He pulls out a chair opposite the one Orsix has perched on, staring at each other from the heads of the table. “It’s going to be like pulling teeth to work with him if he doesn’t fix his bloody attitude.”
Harry continues to practice with the skull. Draco changes the environment by adding more magical objects to the room or moving the skull further. He tries to focus on teaching—especially with such a receptive student—but he has trouble keeping a full daft grin off his face. He’s busy imagining that there are much worse things to be than minty gum.
Draco laughs and wraps his arms around his shoulders, meeting his eyes through the reflection. “You look handsome. Too handsome.”
Harry thinks of the poem, his foolhardy speech about forgetting everything but themselves, living as easily as the wild geese, and regrets it all for a moment with the constricting feeling of Draco’s hand in his.
More than her detached, dependable assessment, the almost-pitying look she’s granting him now is hard to accept. It’s exemplary of exactly why the Dark Mark is his magnum opus, just as exemplary as how he feels when he closes his eyes and sees Harry delicately tracing the Dark Mark. It doesn’t matter what others think. Not if his editor pities him or Harry doesn’t. He hates it, and that’s enough to cause problems.
They fall easily into their habit—him flopping back down in the reading chair while Harry heads for the kitchen, grabbing a handful of biscuits and making a cup of coffee.
Draco lets what feels like an appropriately long moment pass before whispering, “Your climax face and your magic tracing face look rather similar. Do what you will with that.”
“It was flowers,” Harry finally informs in privacy. “Murray’s been receiving them for days, and Cassie grabbed one. Her hair caught fire. Ron put it out,
“I finished Shakespeare,” Draco mutters. Harry tips his head curiously, a smile much softer than his usual one crossing his cheeks. “What?” he adds, resisting the urge to snatch the book from his hands.
“The Healer’s orders were rest, not stay in bed. I need to go to yours. Trace the entire thing top to bottom. Do some warding.” He grimaces as he sits up too. “I can’t
At first, in the quickening exchange rate of owls (Potter’s tawny owl takes this personally and regularly refuses to leave until Draco’s let him in and left him to snack and fluff his feathers by the fire), Draco doesn’t know where they’d left the line for ‘not riling’ someone up. When he replies to one of Potter’s stupider messages by addressing him as '
“Will you be away from home often?” Harry asks, thinking of Rose and how busy Hermione gets with work.
“If you’re alright with that, then… we ought to show you this, too,” Ron says, pulling a copy of the
It’s humbling to feel unable to read him after so long spent confident that he would know his thoughts by the tic of a single eyelid. He hadn’t predicted any behaviour that Draco had exemplified last night, so he’ll readily admit that his observational skills might have been skewed.
some of the congratulations, but either way it’s clear that not a single department has missed the opportunity to get in good graces with MLE.
“Oh, you first,” Harry decides, staying on his knees, his arms resting on Draco’s lap. Without even thinking, Draco leans forward and cards his fingers into that hair, capturing his lips and thinking how delightful it is to do something so simple and human and mortal, to do nothing but listen to Harry sigh deeply through his nose. “What was that for?” he asks breathlessly.
“H-hello, and thank you for joining us tonight,” he begins. “Ten years ago, I began my journey to defeat the very… personification of evil and restore peace to the wizarding world.”
“Why do you think you can only see my head right now? They won’t see me,” he says, pulling the cloak tighter and meeting his eyes in a dare. “I’m not leaving until I’ve seen him and made sure he’s okay.”
This time, though, Harry isn’t heading to Jab Gym but the office. In part, because he’d sent Jack several panicky texts assuring him that all was fine and not to change his gym schedule on Harry’s behalf, despite his own terror to run into the man.
The Three Broomsticks is warm and inviting, if not a bit smoky, and every bit of it puts Harry at ease—the smell, the rumble of conversation from every corner, glasses clinking at the bar. They slide into a booth comfortably, shoulder to shoulder the four of them, and he can feel eyes on him before they’ve even got scarves and hats removed.
When a young boy and girl, twins he thinks, bound over, Harry finally stuffs the papers into his shopping bags. He kneels to speak to them at eye level and even pushes back his hair to reveal his scar when it’s requested—something Draco knows no adult would survive asking.
stamped in brass right underneath. He looks simply star-struck, but Harry knows better. His smile falls immediately.
Harry laughs good-naturedly, because it’s performative irritation, and he’s learned to let it happen—it’s who Draco is, and it’s a part of him he’d miss if it were gone.
Harry drops one of his hands and traces his thumb lightly over Draco’s lips, then shifts close until their mouths are just about touching.
Feeling it was one thing Harry’s sure Malfoy didn’t do. Especially when he zeroed in on the right book without being cursed into joining the head rush Leonard had been experiencing.
“Well, thanks for staying after,” Jack’s voice booms. It’s familiarly warm and friendly, just as Harry remembers, and he finds himself momentarily mourning the lost friendship.
know I’ve worked on that, or you wouldn’t be sitting here. I don’t think you’d even let me talk this long if you didn’t already think I’d changed just a little.”
“Look, your problem isn’t even with Draco, I know. It’s with his father,” Harry tries, hearing the edge of pleading slipping through. Now he does everything
“I truly wouldn’t do this if I thought I had any other option,” he tells Dante as he begins writing. He charms his voice high and rhapsodic, and when he adds a breathiness to it, the Howler seems to come across as a genuine piece of teenage hysterics. He scratches Dante’s head, moving his nose close to the kneazle’s as he threatens him. “We are
Harry wakes slowly, not with a gasping pull to reality but with a groggy drowsiness that makes him want to check for cracks in his mirror and gingers at the foot of his bed.
That was when the slow crawl towards friendship had become a fast tumble, he thinks—his early attempt at empathy. With it had come his earliest moments of guilt at being adjacently responsible for causing him harm. The more study nights they held, the more he grew to appreciate Harry’s presence, and the more he appreciated his presence, the more he’d found his personality in its most honest state emerging.
“I think it’s brilliant,” he admits a while later—Potter had gone on like the rush of a river, only halting when they got a bit peckish and ordered some food. Even then, he’d thought of something else to explain while at the bar and returned already barreling along (“And another thing,
He leans forward with his arms braced straight against the kitchen counter and takes a moment to breathe, squeezing his eyes shut then opening them wide, trying to clear his head. When he tunes back into his environment, the kettle is screaming, and he scrambles to take it off the hob, wondering how long he’d left it whistling while he stood over the stove like a nutter.
“You two look radiant there.” She’s pointing to the picture of Harry and Hermione dancing at her wedding, spinning and looking overjoyed.
There’s no ignoring the strange, quiet air that comes over them upon returning, together, to Flourish and Blotts for the first time since the curse. The girl at the till hadn’t been there that day, and Draco walks the aisles alone as if he’s carrying a secret, something just between him and Harry.
“You’re hiding me in—“ Draco pushes the door to his bedroom open, walks them in Harry-first. “—in your bedroom?”
Balance is restored in the study-turned-laboratory once he’s well-rested, keen to work with his hands after days of reading and theorising. He tries to clear some space on the cluttered desk. What was once a second bedroom had been filled with stacks of books in rows along the walls, against the furniture, on two filing cabinets against the wall opposite the door. Some were turned into a makeshift table by an old claw-footed reading chair, forgotten teacups staining rings into a copy of
Pansy slides out of the booth so he can get by. The bar is crowded, and so when he pushes through, he perches by the corner, waiting patiently to get the barman’s attention. He might have never noticed the group seated near the entrance if it hadn’t been for an extremely angry, towering man yelling at the radio over the din.
a man as nice as Lars. Rather, he feels himself work through the frustrations internally, in the constant motion he takes around the ring, in the swing of his limbs, and even in the blows he receives and the soreness he’ll feel in the morning. He’s no masochist, but the narrow-focused, immediate risk and loss of a sparring match pushes everything else aside. After twenty or so seconds, he’s even forgotten about his audience. This is the closest he gets to the natural thrill of flying.
The first sign that this is still an active problem is the crowd outside of Flourish and Blotts, who only part to let him through when they spot who he is. Whispers of “It’s Auror Potter,” and “I saw his scar! Did you see it?” follow him as he pushes through. He doesn’t even both to plaster on his usual thin-but-patient smile.
“Unfortunately, the meeting let out before I could get past Yolanda’s desk. She’s the personal receptionist for the supervisory offices.”
And the entire time he’ll wonder whether Draco’s owled him. To break up with him. Or to demand an apology, which he’d give. Or to forgive
, and he follows the pull of hands off his chair boldly, lips glued to Harry’s, and swings a leg gracefully around the other seat. When he settles, straddling the chair, his weight on Harry’s legs, he stills beneath him and instantly Draco regains the fear that he’s been too headlong after all. Harry rolls his forehead to Draco’s chest, hand’s still firm against his hips.
Harry thinks of this man, or a brighter version of him, reminding him that there are times to utilise your temper and times that it gets in your way, so he takes a deep breath.
“Brilliant, and—I have to ask and I’m genuinely not trying to aggravate you,” he says, stopping at the opened front door. Draco holds a breath. “I wanted to take you to my local, if it’s okay. It’s a muggle pub.”
Draco resists a laugh, shaking his head. “Not yet, just close your eyes and feel. Or listen, to continue the metaphor.”
Through squinted eyes, he can see Harry sitting propped up against the pillows, a book in hand, and he doesn’t recognise that Draco’s turned over awake, so his hand moves distractedly to his back and settles against him.
The aisles in Slug & Jiggers are a cramped maze of tall shelves, unlabeled, but Draco comes often enough to know his way. After picking up some necessities, he meanders through for a while, lingering especially long in the piecemeal book section, where he pages through a small book called
“Exciting,” Draco says. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then.” He pushes himself up with his hands, and all Harry sees is his shins again.
and the very fact that it grips him with jealousy is embarrassing. Still, he tilts his head as casually as he can as he asks, “Why not?”
He twists the cap of his water bottle absently, not sure if the ache in his stomach is anxiety or just Lars’ knee from earlier.
“I’m not a student,” Harry shrugs, “seemed sensible. Not my problem if you have a heat stroke in September.”
He holds it up again, both of them clear on his point by now, and shrugs, affecting as much indifference as he can possibly muster while looking to Draco, and says “Eh, Dark magic.”
“What, he gave you a friendship necklace?” he quips, taking it in his hands. Harry’s curious whether he’ll feel the heartbeat. Whether it’ll be Hermione’s or Draco’s. There’s no way to know, but he’ll get the idea all the same.
There’s no use fighting the restricting ropes that crease deeply into his robes, practically to the point of cutting off his circulation. Draco’s too furious to notice the discomfort, anyway.
Draco feels past the point to argue, and it doesn’t sound uncomfortable. “Tomorrow we’ll get more answers, I promise,” he offers in response. “He doesn’t know we know. And I don’t want you performing reconnaissance when you barely slept a wink last night.”
She frowns at him, looking like she wants to ask if he’s alright again, and takes the book from his lap, pointing to a picture. “Henry Potter. His friends called him Harry. He’s your great-grandfather.”
“Come in,” he says at the door, before watching Harry set another bakery bag down in the kitchen. The offering sends a rush of affection through him, and he hears the words tumble out of him. “Harry, I’m sorry.”
When he looks up, he half expects Blaise’s usual smug expression at being proven right, but instead he’s met with genuine concern. He taps his fingers on the table in an unusual sign of upset, and it steals Draco from his anxieties with its rarity.
He leans his head back against the couch cushion. At some point, he’d drawn his knees up to his chest, and his still-throbbing arm lays palm up across them. “No,” he says, “I don’t feel like moving, and I’ve already imposed. I’m sorry I interrupted your television.”
They’re sitting on separate ends of the couch, Harry with his elbow propped on the arm of the seat to hold his head up, legs tucked under a knit blanket, while Draco now sits lengthwise using the arm like a backrest. He’s studying Harry carefully.
Harry laughs, but seems to feel him grow rigid when he tries to look up for a kiss. He lets Draco go with nothing but kindly understanding. “Crowded place, I get it,” he says patiently. “Word is dinner’s ready. Shall we?”
That does it. Potter’s face, which had just been flushed with anger, pales ashen, his breath catching. He almost speaks once, twice, but shuts his mouth each time.
Ron shrugs. “You’ve got a knack for escaping in the afternoon. Just checking.” Instead of leaving, however, he hangs an arm in the doorway, leaning back in, and speaks much lower. “I heard about Malfoy. Bad luck.”
“I, er, I feel as though I was unfair to you,” Harry says as they begin their walk to dinner. He’s been stuck in thought, since the door to Draco’s closed behind him. “I haven’t exactly given Ron and Hermione the full picture, either. I just wouldn’t have pushed you behind a closed door. But you were right, about this being hard to explain to others.”
Then, just when Draco had survived those damn running shorts, he’d been faced with a greater evil; Harry Potter in a Muggle gym, shaking his damp hair with a huge grin like a canine, eyes alive, chest glossy with sweat. Harry Potter, moving with all the quiet swiftness and calculated precision of a pro, in tune with his body in ways Draco couldn’t imagine. Harry Potter with friends like Jack and Lars and an entire life outside the world he’d shared with Draco. The jealousy and desire he carried with him that night were palpable, and so when he left briskly and impersonally, he’d sincerely hoped for a weekend of quiet.
He pushes the comment from his mind as much as he can. He can tell that this one will keep him up tonight as he tries to discern how the rumour spread so successfully; he hasn’t dated anyone publicly since Ginny, a fact which probably held connotations of its own. He’d never publicly confirm or deny these connotations, reckoning it wasn’t the Prophet’s business, and meeting people near home or through Jab meant he’d accidentally exclusively dated muggles.
“Am I incapable of handling change?” he asks, still looking at the ceiling. Hermione answers from the floor to his far right, across the room.
Turning the corner around the kitchen with surprising speed, he takes the spoon from Harry’s hand and lays it by the stove, grabbing his shoulders and pushing him towards the back of the flat.
“Who?” Harry feigns indifference, but he’s already redirecting his gaze to the end of the ballroom, chin lowered to look notably more casual.
“That was an hour of the latest hits to get you through your Friday afternoon, and coming up on the weekend, do you have trouble in paradise? Leave it in the work week! It’s time for our first Howler!”
” Harry practically growls in frustration. “I-I’m not in the mood to handle one of your… your little fits!”
It’s completely dark by the time they reach the hotel. Draco gives the name Malfoy at the front desk, then shoos Harry away to sit and wait. “You’re making me tired just standing there like that,” he insists. “I have a reservation; it’ll just be a moment.”
Orsix is waiting on the stoop when Harry walks up to his door, so he takes the note from his hold and finds him some food, working by rote. The note is on Ministry stationery, informing him that it’ll take some time to inventory the extensive evidence collected today, and to '
had lessened the irritation he felt at Harry’s retort, the sight of him standing at the foot of his bed, facing him defiantly in a pair of vibrant knit socks feels far too domestic to be threatening.
They pass her with no comment, Harry chattering concerns about them being seen entering together as they climb shoulder to shoulder up the steps.
“Alright, sorry. It’s—I was just trying to lighten the atmosphere.” His eyes widen, carefully watching Harry’s. “Forget I said that, and wait here.” He stands slowly, waiting a second before moving, and Harry takes the time to kick his trousers off and sit with his back against the pillows and his legs under the blankets.
Ron scowls, then moves a centre pawn forward two spaces. Draco mirrors him. He sends a knight to f3, and for an agonisingly quiet few minutes, they exchange pawns. Draco scoffs loudly when Ron moves his queen out quite early.
“My answer?” Draco starts. He watches Harry’s expression intently, his minute nod and his gulp of surprise anticipation, then tugs on his shirt sleeve—a sign of anxiety, whether he’s aware Harry’s noticed or not. Between it all, he has Harry caught rapt when he leans in. His voice is a whisper, like they’re sharing a sleepover secret. “Draco
Her eyes tenderly hold his for a moment longer, then, voice warm, she says, “We love you, you know.”
Harry screws his mouth up in thought. It feels even earlier, it feels… but he can’t tell. It was sudden, the black-and-white transition from Malfoy to Draco, and yet something about it had been so natural that it had felt much more gradual. Such a simple and affordable transition that it hadn’t caught his consciousness.
If Harry had snatched the phone back as he so badly wanted to, he could have reread several texts back and forth after the incident:
“Pardon, Harry? Potter?” Everyone swivels to a quiet young woman standing just behind Ginny, approaching timidly as she speaks. “Sorry to bother, I was just wondering if I could get your signature. Or buy you a drink,” she adds, blushing.
information on your life, this included. It makes me feel like an idiot. Even when I think you’re being open, when you’re holding my hands in bed like schoolgirls talking about Emilia and Ginny, the truth doesn’t come up. Even when you kissed me, the first words out of your mouth were ‘I didn’t mean that’. You don’t know how to be honest. You want connection, but you won’t open up to allow for it.”
Harry sits, though reluctantly. He takes great care to breathe as calmly as possible. Murray speaks slowly and evenly, clearly revelling in the authority and information he’s lording over him.
“But her dad was friends with my dad,” Ron murmurs, distant and half-listening. “Why would she try to kill you? She’s so nice.”
Unlike many New Delhi structures that they’d seen, the temple is not Muggle or wizard but a relic from when the two existed in conjunction. He squints up to its peak. Standing in its ancient, towering presence leaves him feeling like a blip in time.
Hermione swoops in, a sparkle in her eye as she throws Rose onto her hip expertly. She’s in a beautiful maroon dress that’s wrapped effortlessly around her sandy-brown frame. Her tightly-curled dark hair is half tied back in a matching ribbon. In short, she was a vision.
,” he calls, then mutters a curse when Harry breezes past the kitchen and he has to stop quickly and turn the hob off on the unattended and increasingly bubbling meal. He catches him by the door, where he’s scrambling to get a good hold on the evidence boxes.
He leans back, staring up at the porch support beams. Suddenly, his peaceful walk during which he’d lightly hoped for a reinvigorated enthusiasm for the case feels futile. He pushes his hair back from his forehead exhaustively with both hands.
Harry had not seen Malfoy for years after the war. There was a short period of time when there was nothing in the papers but public outrage that the man had escaped a lifetime of Azkaban, despite the fact that both of the elder Malfoys were subjected to the Kiss and it was proven that their under-aged son's involuntary crimes were due to threats to his family. After the sensational trial, Malfoy had disappeared. He did not return to Hogwarts to finish 7
He never did anything to encourage the rumours about himself, but he also never dissuaded any tales that were being weaved about him. Being called the Ice Prince of Slytherin did have its advantages at times, especially when he wanted to claim a sunnily lit spot in the Library or to get some quiet time on his broom. Most of the time though, he minded his own business and kept away from interhouse rivalries. He was careful never to start anything, not out of a sense of righteousness, but more because he felt it too ironic to antagonise Potter and his crew. Yet, it soon became apparent to him that if you were called the Prince of Slytherin and you were seen in the midst of a group of Slytherins trading hexes with Gryffindors, people naturally came to the conclusion that you were the head instigator of the fight, regardless of the fact that you only casted spells to shield yourself. It also did not help that the Golden Trio seemed to despise your very being, when all you had ever really done to them were a couple of childish insults way back before they even set foot in Hogwarts.
After a week, Harry received a reply from Malfoy on an invitation of a Friday drink. Then it was another drink next weekend, then a ticket to Quiddich, then it was dinner under candles and moonlight on the grounds of the Malfoy Manor. The affair commenced so quickly it almost give Harry whiplash until he recalled Malfoy's long-time crush for him. They started to go on proper dates, dates that were more like colleagues meeting up for a drink after work, dates that were more like friends relaxing out over a Quiddich game, all in secret of course, there was no need to make things complicated for a married man like Harry. Only that Harry tried to hold Malfoy's hand under the table and Malfoy kissing him on the mouth before he Apparated home. Then, it was only the matter of time before he got Malfoy into bed, Harry mused as he half-heartedly stared at the naked man lying next to him on the biggest bed in the Manor, breathing softly and hair matted to his forehead with sweat. It was almost too good to be true, really, that Harry had a hard time believing how successful Ginny's plan had been. When Ginny urged him to ask Malfoy for a baby, he told himself that this was it, this was when this would fail. He tried to stall for time, telling Ginny that it was too soon in the relationship to start talking about having a child, and what if Malfoy demanded a divorce when he thought Harry was getting serious?
Then, he flinched again and felt as if someone was ripping his heart out when he saw tears trickling down James' angled face. His son was crying.
One silver lining of this unplanned cohabitation was that it was easier for him and Potter to sneak around together when no one was watching. When Potter sought him out the first time, late at night while he was in the study, it did take him aback. He had half a mind that their tryst earlier this year was nothing but a figment of his imagination and there was no way that this would continue. But Potter was stubborn and persistent, and like with Pansy, he was beaten into submission. What else could he do, really, living half a life hiding away in his mother’s family ancestral home, bounded by secrecy and hostility. It was perhaps inevitable.
Then, Parkinson drew her wand from beneath her cloak. Startled, he wondered whether she would be tempted to hex him off the edge. Would that not be terribly ironic, to have avoided death by Voldermort only to be killed by Parkinson of all people. But then, instead of pointing the wand at him, she pointed to the sky and murmured an incantation that was too quiet for him to catch. The sky, just now thick with clouds, cleared up and left a gap just big enough, like curtains drawn on a stage. There, as if conjured up from out of nowhere, from that small window of clear aquamarine sky, sparkles filled his eyes with countless twinkling stars. There were so many of them, some twinkling brighter than others, some hazed on their edges as their light reached them from light years away. Years of Hogwarts should have helped him name all the constellations and stars, but in that moment his mind was blank, their names and meanings inconsequential as he took in the wondrous view before him, speechless for words. In the corner of his eyes, he could see their patch of sky reflected on the surface of the Great Lake, its myriads of stars duplicated on the gentle ripples of the water surface. Strangely, even though it was the first time he had seen the night sky this way, a well of nostalgia, of wistful memories, of a vague yearning rose up in him, perplexingly unexplanable. As he gazed as the stars, mesmerised, his ears were no longer filled with hisses from curses being flung, replaced by a muted hum of white noise. His legs no longer tapped but felt light like feathers, as if they would not be able to hold his weight. His fingers no longer twitched but felt warm and full, and he realised that Parkinson and him had somehow moved closer together and her wandless hand was now in his. He could not tear his eyes away from the starry night, and all of a sudden he could not stop crying. Big fat teardrops fell down his cheeks, yet he made no sound, maybe he was not able to. Next to him, he had a feeling that Parkinson was crying too, although she too was quiet, herself lost in thoughts unknown to him. So, there they sat, eyes unmoved from the starry night, shoulder to shoulder, hands clasped together, until dawn edged from the horizon.
A foam moustache clung to his top lip before he didn’t seem to care as he took another sip getting a blob of cream onto the tip of his nose. Draco was about to wipe it off when the door to the sunroom was thrown open and his father was stalking towards them. His normally immaculate blonde hair was ruffled and his face was tight with frustration. Narcissa followed behind looking only slightly calmer than her husband. She paused as she saw them a beautiful, gentle smile forming on her face as she looked them over.
“like I would trust you in a Joke shop with Potter’s son” Severus muttered dryly and Remus gave a smile feeling suddenly like he was a teen again as he darted inside calling out;
“Take that!” Draco shouted moving in a different direction to Harry. It wasn’t in the direction of the Malfoy’s basecamp so neither followed focusing on Harry. Remus and Severus appeared from their own encampment and Draco knew his parents were beat, but they were both laughing gayly. Draco watched for a few moments and then ran as quickly as he could to the Malfoy igloo dragging the flag out from under his jumper. Victory was near and then a large cold splodge landed on the back of his head. He stumbled forward almost landing in the mound of snow in front of him, but he forced out some wandless magic and righted himself. He didn’t look around and just focused on his goal. Reaching the flagpole in the middle of the garden he attached his and Harry’s flag and then jumped up and down. “I did it! We did it!” He shouted happily as the clump of snow slipped down from the back of his head sliding into his jumper sending a shiver down his spine. He winced but it was forgotten when Harry sprinted towards him and wrapped his arms around his waist.
“Of course, it is the least I can do for the boy, but Severus, you must answer me honestly is Harry safe with the Malfoys?” She asked her grandmotherly concern flowing out and Severus gave a nod and then turned to his potion’s cabinet. After unlocking it with a bronze key he searched for the small vial that he kept there for emergencies.
“Okay, we will start with chords” Chuck said as Harry nervously held his guitar with trembling fingers. The teacher looked a lot more confident now that it was just the two of them while Harry wished that Draco was there or one of his Dad’s, maybe Remus as Severus was terrifying to everyone that didn’t know him. Unfortunately, neither were an option, it was the first day after the full moon and Remus hadn’t woken yet and Severus was at work. Draco was having his violin lesson though he had told him he would miss it if Harry needed him. “Harry?”
“Of course, spend plenty of time with your son, Severus, it is good to see you happy” The tiny charms teacher gave a bright grin and then walked off. His place was soon taken by the giant of a an auror Kingsley. The man gave a bright smile showing a row of bright white teeth as he too held out a present.
“They are only in the next enclosure, though it is likely they will be under the water” Remus chuckled as Harry took another lingering look at the Peryton and Pegasus before walking with his two fathers to the next enclosure. It was when he was about ten steps away that he realised that he had thought of Remus and Severus as his fathers and that he had called Severus ‘Dad’. His cheeks warmed as he cast shy looks up at Severus. The potion master hadn’t said anything, in fact he had answered his question happily, so did that mean he didn’t mind being called ‘Dad’? “Would you care for an ice cream, Harry?”
“With his father I am sure he will be a natural my heart, I will watch over them” Lucius said with a chuckle pressing a kiss to her cheek. Draco was genuinely surprised and happy to hear that and he grinned at Harry who looked startled but pleased.
“Pansy you are the worst gossip in the world, you have known Harry all of five minutes and have informed him of all the comings and goings of your family”
“Just half a cup of tea if you will” Tobias said with a smile popping on a pair of glasses before pulling out a w long thin wand which had an ornate decoration of roses swirled around the handle and up to the tip. It was much more delicate than he would have expected from the man. “I have always liked roses, they are delicate but tough, rather like you have had to be, okay, Harry, I’m going to cast a little spell on you, now don’t worry it is quite painless, just a little tickle, are you ready?”
“Okay, Dad…I mean Professor, sorry…” Harry agreed glad to be getting away from the strange stuttering professor who was now staring off into the distance as though he had completely forgotten where he was. Severus’ face softened completely as he shook his head.
After everything that had happened with Dumbledore and the increased feelings of dread Harry had been having for the last couple of days it was such a nice feeling to be out of the manor and having fun with his friends. The fun continued over a light lunch with the teams, their managers, and Harry’s strange little party taking over one corner of the eating area. Harry ordered fish and Chips, something the Dursley’s had almost always had on a Friday night but he had never been allowed and although the wizarding world version was slightly different the batter was amazing on the fish. As the lunch had progressed even Bridget had started to relax and was no longer looking at Draco or Harry as though they were devils incarnate, but Harry had a feeling that was more down to whatever it was that Nino was hissing at her. The tutor had been in deep conversation with the Irish woman ever since they had sat down and now Bridget had even agreed that, if it was okay with the Malfoy’s Seamus would be allowed to come over on a weekend and play Quidditch.
“Right” Harry nodded while Gabriel seemed to settle on a fabric after holding three up against him. Next, he moved onto cottons and twist. Harry looked around the shop Remus and Narcissa were in their own fitting rooms and Harry could see that his Pops was looking just as uncomfortable and baffled as he was feeling. Nino had refused to be dressed insisting that she had a costume and she was chatting rather happily with Kingsley who had come with them as their protection detail and Harry wondered who he was protecting him from. Voldemort or Dumbledore? Probably both. Dumbledore had seemingly vanished after being removed from Hogwarts however he had been to Gringotts trying to get the Goblins on side. Tormuld had been rather bemused when he had told them about that. The head Goblin had laughed the former headmaster out of the bank.
“I had given that some thought, if we were to go through with this option, if that was what Harry wanted, I thought that I would adopt him by blood and then sign him over to you as guardians. I would make for a terrible parent I am happy enough to be uncle and godfather, but it would make sure that Dumbledore would not be able to get his hands on him”
“Yup a fluffy scary flower petal” The twins and Seamus laughed reaching out to ruffle at his hair and Draco stuck his tongue out at them his cheeks flushing just a little. At this rate he would be a Hufflepuff before he was at school with Harry smiling at him like that though he decided that he didn’t care.
“Well I didn’t, I spent most of my time thinking about blondes with grey eyes...” Harry turned in the shower and before he could react Draco found himself being pulled into a kiss.
SO...The will has been read...Or listened too...I hope it was okay >.< a lot of build up I hope it wasn’t a let down  ><
“Yes! But knowing you anything might have happened!” Pansy insisted moving to the other side of Harry and linking her arm through his. “I was so happy that Nino invited me to come, she is so darling! But I didn’t know that she would be inviting the brothers ginger. Weasleys’ Draco? Your father is okay with it?”
“...She was going to...Then well, we had an argument and...It was felt that she would join the Harpies” Harry hummed letting out a breathy moan as Draco added a bit of pressure as he scrubbed his back until he was basically just giving his rival a massage.
“Hoping to defend you from the pit of snakes? Well you have too Gryffindors too protect you! And if Harry is anything but Ravenclaw I’ll eat my own hat!” Fred laughed wishing that they could tell the soon to be firsties how they were sorted, but it was a big secret for some reason. “Oh! They announced the new head teacher today. Aurora Sinistra. She was the Astronomy teacher. I think everyone was completely surprised when she was appointed because she wasn’t even taught at Hogwarts, she was taught at Beauxbatons Academy in France”
“Dear Harry, before I go any further and forgive me if I am over stepping the bounds of our tentative friendship but what did you mean when you wrote ‘Locked in my cupboard?’ Your relatives keep you locked in a cupboard? I highly doubt that is normal sleeping arrangements for muggles. You can tell me that it is none of my concern but I would hardly let such a statement pass” Harry groaned he hadn’t meant to write that, Draco probably thought he was a freak now and like Dudley and his gang he was probably going to laugh about it behind his back. It had been going so well and now he had ruined it. However Draco’s letter continued and Harry kept reading surprised that the rest of the letter was much the same as their others had been.
“But! I am just a drain! A waste of space, I don’t deserve new clothes, I could...I could wear your old ones, I know I’m a little bit smaller than you...But I don’t want to waste your money!”
“Not one for Quidditch Harry?” Thesidious asked with a knowing smile and Harry gave him a shrug saying honestly;
“But you were having fun and I ruined it. I ruin everything, I’m just a freak…I can’t even have a day at the zoo without making everyone worry”
“I go wherever you go and Pants will no doubt join us even if she is more Slytherin than Salazar himself” Draco muttered his arms wrapping around him snuggling him tightly as Harry snorted in his sleep his head pressed against the thin chest of his friend. It might be strange to some that even after so many months together they still shared a bed, but Harry couldn’t imagine not having Draco with him and it seemed that Draco felt the same.
“I…Don’t really understand” Harry admitted, and Draco gave him a smile holding out one of his gummy snakes. Harry took it and nibbled on the head feeling strange to be eating sweets before brushing his teeth or even having breakfast.
“Petunia dear, I’m home” He called out in a chipper voice before looking up and seeing the scene before him. His face turned red and his large neck wobbling as he puffed up like a puffer fish before spluttering “What...What the hell is going on here? What is the meaning of this!”
“We shall return to the house, immediately” Lucius said but to Harry’s surprise he gave them a wink and as soon as the house elf popped away, he moved quickly vanishing the ball before taking off around the pitch. “A few more laps about the pitch will work up more of a hunger”
“Our mum would completely flip if she knew that we were here with the evil Malfoy’s” The twins laughed loudly wiggling their eyebrows “Our brother would tattle so quick if he knew so good old Snape gives us ‘detention’. Of course, not everything you hear about the Malfoy’s is true…We haven’t seen a single dungeon”
“I went to a lot of places Draco, I admittedly spent a lot of time travelling between China and Japan. The Chinese breed of dragon is more serpentine than the western…”
“I may have indulged once…Or perhaps twice. My life rarely offers me moments of simple pleasure, so I took the time to enjoy myself” Severus admitted carefully not wanting to open himself to scorn but needing to trust Remus. The werewolf laughed his fingers reaching out to his hand stopping before they reached all the way unsure if he could touch him out here in the open in front of all these people. Severus answered the question for him by closing the distance between them.
“You saved me! I will help you Boris!” Boris startled at the offer of help from the little bat, but it was lonely in the forest alone and scary when the wind howled.
“Uncle Luci, he is using legilimency” Harry whispered to the older blonde. Lucius’ hand tightened on his shoulder and he turned to stare at Dumbledore with his back straight and his expression unreadable.
Soon they were all settled in front of the fire and Draco felt himself feeling warm and fluffy, more so when Harry’s head came to rest on his shoulder. He laid his head on top of Harry’s a warm fuzzy feeling bubbling around inside his stomach. The winter festival really was the best that he had ever head and when it came to presents in a few days it would only be the icing on the cake.
“I don’t fully understand what’s going on, but it’s clear that Harry has been through something and I didn’t become an Auror to sit by and watch a wee bairn being hurt” Although Draco had been able to tell the young Auror was Scottish since meeting her, her accent was getting stronger with each word she was speaking and he thought it wouldn’t be long before she was speaking in full brogue. “Do you have a fire I can use?”
“Ronald! Sit down!” The boy addressed as Percy hissed his face as red as his hair as he tried his best not to draw attention to himself. A glance at the twins told Harry that they were loving the reaction of their brother. Ron slowly made his way to the table his feet dragging on the tiles. When he reached it the entire student body of Slytherin looked at him with disgust moving as far away from him as they could without falling from their seats.
“Family. The Malfoy’s aren’t your family…You poor deluded boy, they are manipulating you…” Dumbledore growled standing up and whipping out a knobbly wand. Before anyone could react, he started muttering a spell. A red light spread out around him and Harry felt a tingle breakout over his skin. All at once he heard Lucius and Severus shout running towards Dumbledore who was looking red in the face. “So, not a manipulation spell, it is of no matter I will find out what they have done to you and I will break it…”
“I believe you, Dumbledore wanted me with the Dursley’s I don’t know why but I believe you and I will be happy to get to know you as Remus Lupin and not Paul Greenfield”
Severus almost flinched at the amused tone in the older woman’s voice that had been made musical by the Scottish brogue. He had just returned from seeing Lupin and Harry back to Malfoy manor and he had hoped to escape this conversation, sadly that hope had been dashed the moment he had heard a polite but insistent knock on his chamber door. He had had no choice but to invite the old woman in and now she was standing in his rooms looking very much like the c at that had caught the canary.
“Just think about how you would push somebody over. The actions that you would need. Firstly, you would have to lift your arms and then there is the force needed. Just go through the actions first” Nino suggested taking out her own wand and conjuring another doll to stand beside the first. This had a purple mask and the woman gave a smirk putting away her wand before lifting her hand. She didn’t seem to do much but in the matter of a second the dummy was being forced backwards knocked completely from its stand the mask falling on to the marble floor with a clatter. It spun on the large nose a few times and then she twisted her hand around and the dummy moved back up settling back into the place swaying just ever so slightly from side to side. “Like that”
“I hope not, the moon is not his friend.” Severus sighed wistfully thinking about the coming full moon and wishing there were more he could do for his wolf. He intended on finding a cure for werewolfism but progress was slow going. Wolfsbane was a help but the side effects could be just as bad and he had no idea what the long term damage could be.
“It’s sad that the truth isn’t told. Merlin’s story is so interesting, was he really born from Magic?” Harry asked his eyes shining with excitement as he almost leaned over the table in his eagerness to learn as much as possible. He still couldn’t believe he could ask questions and get answers. The Malfoy’s and his parents were always ready to answer and if they didn’t know they would find out. There was no such thing as a stupid question, and they were positively delighted that he wanted to learn. Severus more than anyone. His onyx eyes were watching him proudly now a smile on his lips as he was settled back into his chair watching them.
He tells him too about how only he and Cassie were in danger of touching them, but avoids discussing Draco’s inventiveness in discovering those facts. Ron’s worry is palpable.
“Ha. Look, Flitwick talked to me about charmed and cursed objects when I went to visit last month, something about how the counter-curse must also be a counter-charm…”
He drops his wand again, but it’s hard to tell whether the creeping blackness has successfully slowed or he’s just imagining so in desperate hopefulness. Draco’s lips move, trying to say something, looking forward as if there’s a third person in the room. It sounds like gibberish and chills Harry’s bones.
They begin with form, a dull practice that involves repeating the same movements over and over while Harry critiques unendingly. For a solid minute, he physically rearranges the fingers in Draco’s fist. His heartbeat speeds when he corrects the thumb on his left hand, one of his own hands holding Draco’s forearm steady right on the Mark. It’s bizarrely personal to feel another’s hand touch the skin there, he keeps it so hidden from the world.
Thankfully, Blaise grants him kind eyes even as he stands. “Your secret’s safe with me. Good enough to be a Secret Keeper, right?” He flashes his teeth.
, Draco,” he berates for the umpteenth time from where he leans against the wall by the bag. “Not all at once. In sequence. Ankle. Hips. Waist. Shoulder. Wrist.” He claps his hands in rhythm with each word.
Draco opens his mouth to say something more, but Harry stands before he can do so, collecting his plates. “Speaking of home,” he sighs, affecting a smile that appears effortful, “shall we?”
, which he’d do. He’ll wonder where his case evidence is sitting, who delivered it there, and why he’s been removed. It should all fill him with anger. But he’ll smile as though he’s not wondering. It’ll be easy, doable. A new lease on life, unless Draco walks into the same pub behind Pansy and Blaise, and—god forbid—looks Harry’s way.
Draco groans before he can stop himself, feeling another speech bubbling up, but it’s one that’s felt especially necessary and so he lets it boil over.
He leaves Draco sitting on a bench beside the ring, then quickly throws his bag into a locker, hesitating briefly before pulling his hoodie over his head and kicking off his sweats. He closes his eyes, just for a moment, eking out every moment of aggravation from his long day, letting it wash over him and fill him with adrenaline.
Draco leans in and picks a chip directly out of her hand. “It’s for the best. She isn’t the jealous type.”
Harry whips his head, shocked by the first time hearing his name since they arrived. It’s the middle-aged man behind the counter speaking, leaning over to catch his eyes between the aisles.
“Words can hurt,” he grumbles, crawling forward to kiss his cheek, then standing to walk to the shower.
He has a sudden groggy recollection of being asked this same question tirelessly in the night. He twists, keeping quieter, to face Harry and finds himself nose to nose.
Malfoy says nothing. Still doesn’t meet his eyes. Harry takes the hint and stands soundless. This is exactly what he’d wanted—Malfoy in action, doing whatever he’s been doing for the years Harry had let him leave his mind—but now that it’s happening, he’s a little stunned.
Splashed above the fold is a photo that makes his throat tighten; Draco, a fist wrapped around his scarf to pull him close and kiss him affectionately on the bridge at the Lakes. It looks authentically romantic and innocent. They’re smiling against each other’s lips, and in a moment he can transport himself back, to the smell of gingerbread and the forest and the little bookshop.
“God, it threw me off just to see you there,” Harry thinks. “And watch you laugh at me. When I already had to give that terrible speech.”
When the checks come—one for Ron and Hermione and one for Draco and Harry, who insists it’s the least he can do—Ron gets a bit fidgety. Harry’s been on high alert this evening, so he notices immediately.
“Draco, my boy!” he squeaks, standing and meeting him halfway into the room. “Wonderful to see you!”
They haven’t really kissed, he realises, since yesterday—proof that this is still new, and despite the speed at which their friendship developed, they’re still in an experimentally new phase. Draco’s lips still feel like a foreign creature against his own, his hands on his body like a stranger’s hands; not the feeling of a partner so familiar that their body feels like an extension of his own.
Harry remembers being unsurprised when Malfoy’s name wasn’t on the guest list. He’d been internalising this as the reason he’d stared so intently and shocked when he’d picked Malfoy out of the crowd earlier. He simply didn’t expect to see him here.
He jerks his chin up toward the first floor above them, hands stuffed firmly in the pockets of his long black coat. “I live above.”
“Why the long face?” he asks, accidentally provoking another look between the couple. It only encourages his sudden suspicion. “What? What is it?”
He remembers feeling like an imposition the last time he snuck up on Draco and it stalls him momentarily, but then he thinks,
“Oh, I know I’ve outdone them.” There was a challenging glint in Harry’s eye when he looked up again.
with cake and sweets and Albin’s wonderful decorations, and everyone can join me tomorrow when Harry’s separation anxiety Mind-Healer sessions begin. Eat, drink, and be merry!”
Ron has chosen a more direct approach: scarlet and gold knit hat, scarlet and gold knit scarf, and a thick Gryffindor jumper. He’d looked like he half considered it when Harry sarcastically suggested he charm one trouser leg each scarlet and gold too.
For the first time, they’re at their most in sync; Harry shifts his head up just as Draco leans down and they kiss, deep and overwrought and just what he’s been wishing for since he left. With his full weight against Harry’s body below him, an animalistic drive comes over him, in a way that he hasn’t experienced in so long that it catches him off-guard. He hesitates in the suddenness of it and begins to pull away, but Harry raises his hands to the back of Draco’s neck and pulls him back down and kisses him again.
He thought he’d had a breakthrough, that the nature of Protean charms was his answer. Then it wasn’t. Then he stared at a blank page and thought of nothing new to try. Then he’d found the gin.
“You’re completely right. And we’ll do something just the two of us, yeah?” he suggests. “Ron can sod off and you and I will do whatever you want.” She bites her lip in contemplation while Ron looks deeply offended. “I can tell you about my research,” he adds. “On my family. Maybe over coffee.”
Harry, who’d crawled back onto his stomach during Draco’s rumination, turns and sits up again to face him, hands clasped together around his folded legs. His brows knit in confusion.
“The fate of the Auror Department isn’t your sole responsibility. I worry that you feel as though you can’t leave somewhere you’re unhappy because it feels wrong to abandon something that isn’t working,” she says. “But there are other good people there. It doesn’t all always have to weigh on you. The ineptitude of whatever this all is… I’m afraid it’ll make you feel like you can’t put yourself first afterwards.”
“No!” he yells, pulling at his shoulders, trying to loosen the Aurors’ restraint even while his eyes dart around the ballroom, following the commotion.
His old professor reaches out to shake his hand heartily, holding on and swinging Draco’s entire arm up and down as he continues to speak.
They work quietly for a while, but their usual comfortable silence has been extinguished, the consequence Draco feared before their confrontational dinner last week, but for different reasons than he’d expected. It’s not discomfort in the air but tension. He’s not sure if Harry feels it, too.
It’s so quiet and strained and Not Draco. Neither is the distressed look on his face or the way he’s shifting from foot to foot.
Draco groans but places his wand between them like a good sport, holding his hands up in mock surrender. He leans in to check the little players in the diorama just in time to watch the English keeper dive and miss a Quaffle.
, and a feeling almost of life within the gold, like it’s about to breathe or beat its heart, but there’s something else, too. Something warm and familiar. Like chocolate and cigarettes and the forest.
Draco weakly laughs along to Pansy and Blaise’s bickering, but as dinner progresses he feels eyes on him from across the table consistently. Distractingly. When he looks in Harry’s direction, though, his focus is on his plate, or Pansy, or Blaise, innocent and smiley. The second he glances away he’d swear he can feel it again. It’s making him go mad.
He begins at an easy jog, one earbud in, then alternates between sprinting and jogging the rest of the way. He’d slowed to a walk a block from home, sucking cool almost-autumn air in through his nose and out through his mouth to slow his breathing, when he suddenly tore the headphone out without pausing the music. The song whines like a mosquito from where the wires hang from his neck. He focuses his hearing.
Harry watches a slight shift in his gaze, his pupils darting across Harry’s face, and he considers as he looks back, how interesting it is that this man was a stranger twice over but he can study those eyes now and find telling inflexions and nuances. He knows just as much, if not more, from a twitch of Draco’s hand than he’s ever been able to decipher in the movements of Ron and Hermione. Their connection at once feels inevitable and incomparable.
—Potter, or the crash course of judgements, reunions, and bygones he’s been put through. The last week felt like a year.
Draco sneaks a hand up his side in deflection, close and warm and when it threads into Harry’s hair, he uses it to pull him back into a kiss. Having the right words, after all, is not nearly as precious as having each other.
He sits up pin-straight, regaining his usually proper posture, and clears his throat. “Sure. What—whatever you want.”
He’s trying to think what would be suitable for a child to learn and decides on something else useful for the game and general wellbeing—pulling up from a dive. He starts high, points straight down, lowers his head and bolts for the solid ground, pulling up in time to set his feet quietly and gently on the grass without a sound.
‘To the Moon on a Cleansweep’ ends and another song begins with crashing drums and piano and it’s something Harry would play in the kitchen, so he summons the letter from the counter without standing. He holds it for a minute longer, then sets it unopened to the side and gets back to work.
“I know, I know. He’s quiet, when he’s concentrating. And when we’re training, he takes direction well. I think that’s something I appreciated—early on. And he’s
This time, when his breathing slows and his eyelids droop, Harry says nothing. They fall asleep in a mess of sheets on one pillow, still bathed in the dim light of the lamp.
Public speaking had always seemed like a strange place to get personal to Draco, so once he’d joined her and graciously listened to her introduce him, he stayed stiff with formality. He thanked Marta with a wave to where she stood with the publishing crowd, thanked his mum and Pansy and Blaise, thanked everyone for coming, the house-elves for serving, all the while still searching for Harry’s head and failing miserably in the sea of faces.
Harry laughs, though his eyes are wide in surprise. “I, er, I think I’ll make you some tea. I’m very happy for you, this is exciting. Or sleep? Should you sleep?”
“The good news is,” says Ron, readjusting his hold on the bag. “There’s a great café nearby that George showed me.”
He spins to Draco in revelation. “I’ve interrupted,” he says, long after interrupting. “You were actually taking a night off to have a… good time, and I brought you more work, and hours ahead of schedule. God, I’m a bad friend.”
like? In past occurrence, people who enjoyed kissing him didn’t profusely apologise, call it a mistake, and run away.
The Junior Auror he was once upon a time wouldn’t have even left the Ministry without requesting backup. The Auror he was last year would stop here instead of even
Harry’s face is pinched up, frowning, eyes shiny, but he doesn’t look angry so much as hurt. And it’s because of that pained look that Draco instantly throws out all the nasty things he’d thought to say back. He has no words that won’t hurt Harry more than he already has. It’s not self-preservation but deep care for the other man that leads him to pick his coat up and turn to the door.
He hesitates. There’s a calming confidence in him that says Harry would set the note down without reading and live with the mystery if he asked him to. And knowing that, he lets him open it.
a morning, in more ways than one, but regretfully I have to go,” Blaise breaks the silence loudly, gripping Draco’s shoulder. “I’m glad you’re okay. I’ll have to give Granger my love.”
“I feel fully regretful for acting on thoughts that I didn’t know if you shared,” he tells his reflection. “It was impulsive and irresponsible and I completely understand if you would prefer not to be friends anymore. As I’ve said before, there are… several curse specialists I can refer you to, some probably back in England by now, and I can return all the Grimmauld Place objects. I want whatever will make you the most comfortable. I’m so sorry, Harry. So sorry.”
If watching them work together hurts her more than she lets on, she hasn’t made it clear to him, and he doesn’t think a celebratory dinner is the time to find the answers. He decides to sit the fence.
Harry groans—he can already picture the lists of consultants and Ministry channels he’ll end up sorting through to find a local expert. He grants himself a moment to appreciate when his cases were mostly fieldwork and not tracking down other people to do the necessary tasks.
Harry chews his lip but shrugs and moves easily aside for him to enter. He doesn’t reach out to Draco, doesn’t hug him or kiss him, and in the uncertain newness of whatever this is, if this was even still something, Draco takes that as a benchmark and doesn’t reciprocate with any affection either. It’s especially hard when he’s spent the last seven days hardly thinking of anything else.
The Ministry’s holding cells are in the lower, lower levels, and the lift drags him so far down and back into the bowels of the building that he can feel the air turn stale and musty and cold. His shoulders rise and tense in the chill and he shoves his hands into the pockets of his dress robes. He feels overdressed for this journey.
“Erickson doesn’t mention once in his interview that he recognised you,” Harry says from the floor, flipping through some papers with confusion.
Draco’s expression of concern only amplifies, but he says nothing else, just keeps walking right behind him. They’ve made it to the front lawn when Murray walks up the path. He’s missed a button on his dress robes and looks incredibly flustered, but he pastes a smile on when he sees them coming.
From the kitchen, then, he hears Andromeda shout “Volume!” dispassionately, but the sound of thundering feet draws his attention quickly back into the room as a blur dives at Harry. He swings the boy up over his shoulder easily into a fireman’s lift and Draco blinks in surprise when his hair flashes from blue to red to orange and back to blue, seemingly without Harry’s doing.
He feels as though the Ministry has swallowed him whole, and coughed up an empty likeness of the Junior Auror he’d arrived as. He runs his hands over his forehead, closes his eyes and takes a few deep breaths before he hears a light knock.
“Do you know how horrible it would’ve been to hear of this tomorrow and not from you? We’re glad you came, we’ve already been worried about you today,
Draco remembers Ron yelling blasphemies in the pub with sudden startling clarity. It’s hard to forget that level of… passion.
“I thought your speech was going great!” Neville objects with a cheerful smile. To Harry, this seems generous. “Your true talents are wasted in the Auror Department.”
She studies him thoughtfully, with a half-smile and a gentle pity that he’s letting slide because it’s been a horrible day and somehow still only noon. She takes his hand. “We’ll go together. C’mon.”
“Your inability to recognise your own repute is going to be your downfall, I’m sure of it. It’s a gift and a curse, but right now it’s mostly a headache.”
“Teddy, Draco is family.” Andromeda reenters, sitting down across from Harry, so Draco follows and joins him on the sofa. “Your mum was his cousin.”
“Hello Pansy,” comes his magically raised voice. He closes his eyes and tries to see whether he can hear himself at all in the tone. “My boyfriend and I’ve gotten into a nasty fight. We were already very close friends, but we’ve broken up rather quickly. Though we both said hurtful things, I’ve quite recently come to terms with where my problems truly lay. I would be so much better with a second chance. How do I know whether he’d be willing to do the same?”
Harry explains the evidence as presented on the official form, including the discovery that all items were cursed in London and the user’s choice of a hawthorn wand. When she asks whether the curses were dated, Harry reiterates what Draco had told him the first time the spell was failing—that the dating spell doesn’t work on initiated curses, and that the book was too extremely cursed to accept the minor spell. She seems to accept this.
They’ve stood in contemplative quiet for almost an hour of walking when Harry takes a break on some steps in the courtyard facing the sanctum. He puts his hands under his glasses for a minute, and when he stands and inhales and exhales noisily a couple times, Draco looks over and acts as if he doesn’t see how red his eyes and nose are.
Eventually, though, about a year after the NEWT’s, he traded one hermitic residence for another, spending most of the first year of a mastery at Hogwarts either in his private rooms or in Flitwick’s classroom. It was this return to the warmest home he’d ever had, though, that began to coax him out and take down his defences, and he soon found that he worked best happy—he was far more successful than he’d ever been cooped up in the Manor.
and wakes up the next morning no worse for the wear, he’s pleased by an established ground for bickering. It would feel wrong, to fake a complete switch to niceties.
you, Auror Potter. I know what you want and I have your answer, so I’m shaking my head at you. The answer is
They have much to talk about, and after a minute to catch their breath they do, but the formality of it is largely dampened by the touch of their skin under the sheets, and their inability to keep their hands to themselves.
“Just on tap, seemed safe,” Potter says, nodding to the pint and sitting across from him. “Sorry to interrupt your thoughts.”
The constricting panic of being unprepared to host his mother is already setting in, his pulse accelerating as he tries not to think of the state of his bedroom and study and
“Are you okay?” Draco whispers when Mari outpaces them a little on the way to the door. “You’re smiling.”
“Erm, yes? Maybe. Actually no.” It was either the window or the spell ricocheting off the window. Or it was Lucrezia, wherever she’d been at the moment. “My nose wasn’t.”
“Brilliant,” he smiles, a real one for Teddy, and accepts the hug that he’s offered. His eyes raise above the boy’s head, mouth dropping flat. “Draco?”
faded,” Blaise adds meaningfully, smirking at Pansy’s offended look. “Sorry love, you have a few more weeks of insults before I’m over being one of the ‘shitty boyfriends’ you turned against.”
He’s aware that, with the right response, if he wants, he can give the affirmative that Jack is searching his eyes for.
“Come on, walk me to the end of Hogsmeade?” she asks, voice sweet. He nods, and they set off a footfall ahead of the others, saying nothing, but she continues to hang off his arm as they walk.
The endorphins and adrenaline did well to mute his crabbiness, but he was still too gloomy to accept an invitation from a friend to hop in the ring, and he took his cool-down run on the treadmill alone, trying not to preemptively hate today’s departmental meeting waiting for him.
Harry crowds into the doorway with him, watches him whisper the spells, then laughs cheerfully when the door opens to a room twice as wide with padded floors and the punching bag fully hung. The desk is nowhere to be seen.
“You know what I love best about Christmas Day?” she prompts, crossing her legs and leaning back casually.
“Look, er,” Potter watches him curiously, taking that same muggle contraption from around his neck. He absently coils the long wires around his fingers as he hesitates. “D’you fancy a drink? It’s a bit early, but it is Happy Hour.”
Pansy thrums her hands flat on the table. Her rhythm slows as a wizard older than Hogwarts hobbles by towards the toilets, his face wrinkled and drawn into a permanent scowl. The three of them make knowing, amused faces at each other and even Draco is lightening to the game.
He’s tried it successfully, on a small Imperius-embedded river rock that made the victim walk into the nearest body of water. He doesn’t know why the skull is different. Before his week took a sudden turn, Flitwick was hopefully going to enlighten him.
, he suddenly thinks. His ego’s been too big to consider a third scenario: What if Draco is gay, but the huge mistake is
He finally gets to add legs once he punches so fluidly that he forgets he’s even pivoted into it at all, sending the bag croaking back and Harry celebrating with a “Fucking
“Ah, Draco, of course, my apologies. Harry, mate, my ear was burning but I just abandoned Jack while I was spotting his last set. He caught me before I left. I’ll be right back, yes?”
“It wasn’t all that special,” he objects. “Just your usual sparring, you know. I’d fight the same way if I went in today.”
Lucky for him, Draco stands wordlessly himself, too preoccupied praying that Harry’s hasn’t seen how close he was to closing the distance.
He feels terrible. There could’ve been no worse time for Ginny to walk in, and of course he hadn’t been talking about
Still, he’s embarrassed on Murray’s behalf that the man doesn’t have the instinct to at least be subtle when suggesting illicit activity. Unfortunately for him, Harry’s not crooked just yet. In fact, it’s been so apparent that Malfoy’s done nothing wrong that even he hasn’t spared a sceptical thought towards the man.
Sure enough, he gets as far as the night he’d gone to find Harry at work and ended up stupefied, the smell of whiskey on Harry’s breath, the thrill in riling him up that he swore off strictly for the sake of friendship, when Blaise puts it together.
If making contact was the first shift in a fight, hitting the mat was the second, so when Harry falls Lars instantly pounces. Harry wraps his legs strongly around his middle, raising his forearms to block punches as he tries to muscle into a roll that’ll put him on top. He gets caught once or twice in the temple before he manages it, but he finally twists his whole body, pivoting his momentum completely into his hips, and then Lars is yelping in surprise and Harry’s upright, trying to sneak a landing punch in between the arms Lars has raised to his head in defence.
“I only stayed two nights,” Harry interjects, before he can be subjected to the age-old speech on the dangers of living amongst cursed objects.
He hands the note back, feeling itchy and awkward, unsure of what to say to gain Harry’s attention again. He feels completely at a loss as to where they’ve left things—Harry had been frustrated, he’d stormed away, then invited Draco to spend an afternoon together. The man takes the parchment back without moving his eyes from the page before him and tucks it in the back of the book.
When his eyes open again Draco has predictably moved off him, both arms flung above his head, one leg out from the covers, and try as he might, he can’t fall back into sleep. He stands instead, careful not to shake the bed too much, and pulls on boxers and a jumper before sneaking off downstairs where, with a whisper, he ignites the fire again.
and flips through. It’s from 2003, and he can feel the timidity in Draco’s writing style. The preface is long and rather formally impresses Draco’s expertise onto the reader, diving in detail into his education and mastery. It’s basically a letter entreating his readers to accept him anew. Harry touches the pages, imagining that it must’ve been awfully difficult to decide to publish for the first time after the war and trial.
“No”, he replied. For a long minute, there was silence but for the tapping sound of his restless feet on the stone floor. He saw her eyes following the rapid twitching of his legs and waited for a snippy comeback.
“And what is this so-called evidence you're talking of?” Harry, amused by the little play between the young parents, decided that it was his time to join in.
All of the sudden, Harry found himself incandescent with rage. Angry at fate for condemning Ginny to something that was slowly robbing her of her dreams and life. Angry at all the Healers in the world who could do little to keep Ginny from pain. Angry at himself for not being able to take her pain as his own, to share her agony. Then he saw Malfoy stirred, and he was angry at Malfoy as well. Angry at the poof who tried to charm him, knowing fully well that he was married. Angry at the bastard for shamelessly invited him back to the Manor where he once witnessed his friends being tortured. Angry at the slut who tried to push Harry into the wall and suck him off even before they could get to the bedroom. Angry at the man that was able to carry their child, while Ginny, a woman in all her rights, could not. It was not fair, not to Harry, not to Ginny. Suddenly, it felt as if Malfoy was the one robbing Ginny of her baby. Enraged, Harry wanted to wake Malfoy up and slam his pretty little head against the wall, he wanted to shake Malfoy violently while screaming at his face, letting him know that this baby was supposed to be Ginny's, no, it would always be Ginny's, and don't he dare come anywhere close to his wife and child, because he had no rights to do so.
Malfoy who had tormented Harry and his friends for years in Hogwarts. Malfoy who had wanted to kill Dumbledore. Malfoy who had led Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Malfoy who had lived with the Dark Lord for the entire summer. Malfoy who looked like a kicked puppy when attending his own trial. Malfoy who had lost both parents to The Kiss. Malfoy who had been pining after Harry for Merlin knows how long. Malfoy who had clawed at Harry's back the first night they were together. Malfoy who did not object to the secrecy of their affair. Malfoy who had a small baby laying in an uterus he was not supposed to have. Malfoy who did not deserve a child of his own, the insufferable bastard he was. Malfoy who was carrying their child; not Harry and Malfoy's, but Harry and Ginny's.
say that about him! And I know who Malfoy was, dad. I know what he did in school, how his family's belief led him to prejudice against you and our family. I know how he could not kill Dumbledore in the end. I know that he despised Voldermort and being his slave, but had no choice if he wanted to save his parents. I know how much he desired you, but never acted on it because he knew you were deeply committed to mother.”
For a moment, his heart stopped as a hand tightly gripped his wrist. He looked up at Malfoy and saw silver eyes glared at him intensely. “Scorpius, his name is Scorpius”, Malfoy spoke in a rush, as if pleading in fear that Harry would change the name. “Of course, Scorpius. I'll just take Scorpius when you have a nap, how about that?” The grip on his wrist loosened and Malfoy nodded, closing his eyes in resignation. Harry eased him down to the laying position and brushed a kiss on his forehead before taking the baby in his arms. As Harry stood up, he saw Malfoy fluttered his eyes opened, something like panic flashed alarmingly at the sight of his son being taken away, but Harry gave his arm a reassuring squeeze and Malfoy closed his eyes again, smiling contently.
Since the start of the year, Draco had known that there was something up with Greg and Vincent. Granted, they had never been close friends despite sharing a dorm room with them and having them following him around the school for all previous years. Perhaps he should have made an effort to know them better, but with an I-will-sooner-or-later-sacrifice-my-life-for-a-speccy-git mentality, he did not really care to make nice with those without the stubborness to steamroll him over like Pansy. Still, that did not mean he was unaware of them sneaking out of the dorm at odd hours and their anxious whisperings to each other when he was not looking. At the beginning, Draco supposed it really was no business of his, what ridiculous scheme Greg and Vincent had got themselves into. But then, he walked into the bathroom one day just as Vincent was stepping out and saw through the blanket of dissipating steam the blackened outline of the Dark Mark on Vincent’s arm. Greg and Vincent might not know it, but their business was now very much his as well, in the sense that our-bondmate-and-master-are-gonna-duke-it-out-at-some-point-and-I-will-most-likely-be-collateral-damage.
