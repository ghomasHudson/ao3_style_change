Ron felt like he was trapped in some sort of strange dream.
"Who's there?" he demanded. "H-hello?" he pulled out his wand and held it out in front of him, his hands still shaking from exhaustion. "I know you're in here, dim-wit, whoever you are!"
"You're welcome, darling. You know, you have young Potter to thank for last night-"
Draco's lips trembled, and his grey eyes were glassy. "Please don't kill me,"
Draco smiled tautly. "Fine, but you owe me 3 silver sickles if I eat it all."
Draco shook his head violently, his throat constricted. "I don't know," he gasped, panicking. "He shouldn't be here. Something's wrong."
"Bye, Harry,"
Draco couldn't breathe. He could feel the blood rushing to his face, and his tongue was swelling in his mouth. He was suffocating. Fantastic!
Harry felt a calm settle over him as he quietly stroked the back of Malfoy's hair, feeling the Slytherin's chest rise and fall against his.
Draco hurried away as fast as he could, the ground making watery sloshing sounds with each step, his shoes sinking into the mud as the rain came pouring down even harder. Thunder split the sky with a loud
"Thank you," Harry gave him a friendly pat on the back and a little squeeze. "Thank you."
Draco rolled his eyes in mild frustration. "Just, never mind, Potter."
"Truce, Weasley?" he asked, waiting awkwardly.
"You don't say, " Ron quipped.
"Harry, I am old. I might not be as strong and youthful as I once was, but I do think myself wiser. I know you have feelings for Draco, and I know he has feelings for you." Dumbledore smiled down at Harry kindly. "I have lived a long time, and although I have never seen an unsuccessful Dementor attack and am completely oblivious as to what it may do to a body, I know from experience, as do you, Harry, that love is the most powerful magic there is. I suggest you use it, Harry." Dumbledore patted Harry on the shoulder and then turned to walk away, his gnarled hands folded behind his back. "Good day, Harry."
"God, why am I even talking to you? You're just a stupid owl!"
Draco's eyes followed Harry as the boy turned to leave the room, meeting his gaze one last time before he finally disappeared out the door. Draco exhaled a shaky breath and clutched his robes tightly in his fists, waiting for Snape to break the silence only shattered by the sound of Harry's retreating footsteps.
"You coming?" Pansy asked.
Draco snorted and abruptly turned his back on the red-head and his friends. He'd had enough excitement for one night. He wasn't even sure if he could make it through the Sorting Ceremony and Dumbledore's speech. He wasn't hungry, so he was planning on slipping out of the Great Hall during the feast to rest. Merlin only knew he needed it.
The beautiful boy raised his head, his scarred brow wrinkled in thought, "Oh, what, yes," he stammered, as his eyes shifted warily in Draco's direction.
Draco felt anger like a burning hot coal in the pit of his stomach, and his face twitched with rage. He wanted to scream out, "I don't need your pity," but he held his tongue. He could hear the sound of their footsteps - three pairs of feet. Harry must have been dawdling behind them a little, presumably lost in thought, and Draco divided the curtain to catch a fleeting glimpse of him in the restricted passageway.
Draco took a shaky breath and managed a weak smile, his eyes cloudy. "Say it again? Please?"
Draco searched the rafters for his old owl, and his face lit up a little. "Oh, Bubo!" he called cheerfully.
"Lucius, it's nothing to be ashamed of. He's our son! We can't just-"
Sorry, this is a rather long chapter, but I felt that it was needed to show how far Draco's relationship with Ron has come. You might call them friends.
He wasn't sure what he feared the most. Loving someone he wasn't meant to love, or standing, wand-at-the-ready, face to face with Voldemort himself. He had heard the slanders his whole life. Hell, he had even used the slurs himself, calling others by names that now, he could only use when speaking of himself.
He wasn't fine. He wasn't fine at all. Tomorrow, he was going back to Hogwarts, and being around Harry was going to be just that much more painful.
Ron put his hands in his pockets and waited for Harry to catch up before starting to walk back to the Gryffindor common room,  an awkward silence filling the 12-inch gap between them. Nonetheless,  the silence was better than nothing. Harry was grateful for his forgiveness.  He knew he had been neglecting him and Hermione for the past several weeks,  but he hadn't realized just how much. He'd been so absorbed in Draco's-
"No, not the slightest." Draco giggled like a girl and instantly turned as red as a tomato. He cleared his throat deeply. "No, not at all."
"Yeah, one second," Harry was practically glowing, and Draco took another moment to appreciate the Gryffindor's toothy smile. "Ron!" Harry shouted, staring across the room. He waved his hand in the air excitedly, causing several curious heads to turn.
"We should go see if he charmed me."
,  and Draco broke into a sprint, nearly tripping over his robes.
"Alright then, come 'ere you git," he groaned, pulling Harry into a hug. "Just let it out . . . I guess. That's right."
Harry wished he could.
The sick boy lying in this bed looked nothing like the boy Harry thought he knew. He was helpless and frail and weak, stripped of his malice and pompous airs. His face was expressionless, lacking the famous sneer that Harry had secretly loved so much. It lacked life. . .
Weeks later, Ronald Weasley was still just as bewildered about Harry's latest romantic endeavors as he had been before. He couldn't shake the feeling of amazement every time he saw the two boys together. They walked hand in hand to every class and held each other in the Common Room as if there was no one around, no one giving them nasty glances and strange looks.
Finally, he stopped, his eyes stinging with tears, his face red from the exertion. "Fuck," he breathed, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. He stared into the bowl, and he regretted doing so. "What the fuck . . ." he whispered.
"Draco, are you okay?!" Harry panted breathlessly, kneeling on the floor beside him.
Slowly, Harry lifted his head again. His eyes were red and swollen from crying as he stood shakily. Then, with a sudden burst of emotion, He ran to Draco and threw his arms around the older boy, and buried his face in his shoulder. He began to sob, the sound thankfully muffled by Draco's robes.
"Yeah?"
Draco sends Harry an anonymous letter and mulls over the coming school year.
Seeing Harry and Draco
"I never thought I'd say this, but I think that crack-pot old fool is growing on me," Draco responded, dissolving into gleeful laughter.
Draco raised his eyebrows at him and smirked. "Oh really? And who is it?" he gasped a little too loudly. "Is it Granger?!"
Draco's eyes twinkled, and he gave Harry a knowing glance. "Well," he said cheerfully. "You tell 'er."
"Professor, what's going on?" Harry asked abruptly, following the older woman's gaze anxiously. "What's Malfoy doing here?"
Ron grinned crookedly. "You up for a race?"
"Dumbledore moved Draco, so he's out of Slytherin, and he's going to be here now, with me . . . us." Harry gushed, his cheeks flushed as he stared at his friends nervously, hoping that they would be just as thrilled as he was.
Did Potter save his life? Why?
"No, just go on. I think I misplaced my wand." Draco lied, glancing across the room again towards Potter, who was now completely and utterly alone at his table.
Draco jerked his arm from her grip and looked up at her with a panicked expression, "You don't understand! I have to go," he yelled, "I have to play this one off, or I'm done for."
"I'll kill you!"
"Y'know what," Harry snapped, "you're right."
"Wait, what?" she laughed, crossing her arms in disbelief. "But that's never been done before. Are you sure, Harry?"
Draco's footsteps were muffled by the dingy carpet, but he knew his father could hear him approaching as he walked speechlessly down the shadowy corridor. The walls were riddled with family heirlooms and paintings. They jeered and scoffed at him as he walked by, and Draco glowered at them hatefully in return.
Harry stepped back, tenderly taking Draco's hand in his and weaving their fingers together. Draco turned his head to look at him, capturing him in his memory like a photograph. Harry's emerald green eyes looked back at him with silent encouragement, and Draco felt a calm wash over him. Everything would be okay.
Sure enough, Harry asked, "Mind if I walk you, Ferret?"
He would be as good as dead if Harry knew. . .
He didn't dare finish his hushed promulgation. He was clinging firmly to denial. His own son, a filthy homophile? He couldn't wrap his head around it. The idea was repulsive and a wicked smear upon the prestigious name of the Malfoy family. His appalled expression abruptly flooded with indignation, and he angrily grabbed his wand from the tea-table beside him and flicked it above the paper. It wouldn't open, and he became more frustrated with every flick of his wand.
Lucius sighed and laid the unopened envelope onto her palm. "Read the damn inscription!"
It was silent. Draco sat there uncomfortably, staring tearfully into the empty space in front of him. The bathroom was completely empty, or so it seemed. He was alone. He'd only been imagining things. Relieved and grateful to be alive, Draco sank against the wall, his body going limp, his eye-lids sagging. He wanted to sleep.
Harry jumped to his feet and whirled around, nervously pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. Ron was standing at the door, looking at his friend with a confused expression.
"Hermione is just trying to help you.  You're at your lowest,  Harry.  We both see that.  You're drooling over that twit,  you barely talk to anyone,  you're sneakin' about,  and you don't even care that your best mate just wants you back.  What happened to playing Quidditch together or teasing the first years just for the hell of it? You've been a right royal git,  and until you get your priorities straight. . . "
Draco jumped back almost as if he had been stupefied, the sudden urge to vomit hitting him. He stiffened instinctively and clenched his hands at his sides as he looked up at Professor Snape, his eyes stinging. He was a fucking idiot. How could he have lowered his guard like that? It was Harry's fucking eyes. That's what it was.
"There you are, you idiot," he breathed, as he gingerly reached out to comb back Draco's wildly strewn blonde hair. It was matted and laying in tangled heaps over the Slytherin's feverish brow, and Harry frowned in concern.
"What?"
Draco took the last bag and hoisted it over his shoulder before looking up at his father with a wounded expression. "Sorry, father," he whispered, as he submissively raked his fingers through his disheveled silvery blonde hair.
Draco's mischievous smirk broadened, "Alright then, guess I'll have a little chat with Dumbledore later."
Hermione nodded towards him, "Call him over, Harry."
But despite that, he felt that all-too-familiar knot of dread in the pit of his stomach, and he sucked in a breath, his insides lurching violently.
Green eyes made his heart melt like butter, and he fought the urge to spill.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Nothing new there, "
"Licorice wands, " Ron answered in one breath,  sounding tired.
"It's Hermione,"  Hermione replied with a smile. She caught Harry's eye and nodded towards him. Harry blushed and nodded back.
His pale grey eyes fixed on Harry's broadening shoulders, Draco Malfoy watched the raven-haired boy dreamily as he left the Hall. He smiled to himself, feeling the happiest he'd felt in months. Harry had looked at him:
Harry heard snickering, and he turned to see Fred and George Weasley grinning broadly at him. He felt a sudden wave of dread.
"No," Draco felt like his cheeks were splitting. He was smiling like a love-struck fool. Could he possibly be any more obvious? What in Salazar's name was wrong with him? He was a down-right git.
It was just his imagination. He was alone. . . Even though he was lying on the floor of a school bathroom, he wanted to enjoy this moment. Something felt perfect about it, though he couldn't put his finger on it. Maybe it was because, for now, he felt weightless, like a cloud drifting pleasantly across the early September sky.
Hermione laughed at his enthusiasm and then looked down at the yellowed paper, Ron peering over her shoulder with a cynical look on his freckled face. Hermione simply smiled and stammered.
he whispered, and immediately the ink began to disappear off of the page, leaving a blank sheet of parchment. Harry smirked and casually dug through his bag for a quill. There was a muted scratching sound as he wrote, but it went unnoticed. His excitement mounted.
"What?"
"You're an excellent flyer, Potter," he complimented the Gryffindor, still holding onto him. "You really know your way around a broom."
Dumbledore turned to Harry, his long white beard practically glowing in the window. "Harry, we believe Draco was subjected to a Dementor's kiss."
"I'm sorry," he muttered softly, "f'everything."
Draco shook his head. "No, Draco, no. You're imaginin' things."
"I do hope that you are not relaying any valuable information to your classmates," his father's voice was cold, almost threatening.
Ron's stomach dropped sickeningly, his dinner churning, and he grimaced again as he felt a shooting pang of regret. "Oh,"
Snape quickly held up his hand, "But please spare me the gory details. "
Draco didn't lose a single moment. He needed to be on the Hogwarts Express and securely hidden away in his own compartment. He didn't want to risk Harry Potter seeing him like this, if at all.
"Nothing," Ron said quickly. He looked back up at Professor Trelawney with a sheepish expression. "Nothing else. That's it."
Secretly, beneath the table, Draco pinched himself. He opened his eyes and chanced a glance across the room only to meet Harry's gaze head-on this time. The boy flushed visibly and glanced away. He was leaning on his elbow, and his head was in his hand. He was fidgeting with his mess of jet-black hair, twirling the tousled curls around his finger as he pretended to read, the torchlight reflecting off of his wire glasses and dancing on the wall.
. . ?'" he muttered to himself, confused.
"Oh," Goyle squeaked around his strawberry tart, the red jam oozing between his teeth, "Look, look! Says 'ere, the old bohemian wizard-"
"So get in all the snogging you can now,"
"Of course!" Draco chuckled. "the two of you just had to tag along, didn't you? Wanted to see me get on my knees and kiss Potter's shiny shoes?"
"Well, if it isn't Malfoy,"
Draco finished, and Harry set the pitcher down.
"'Morning," Draco mumbled groggily.
Hermione handed him her pumpkin juice. "Here, drink this. It should help with nausea."
"No, no, no," He threw back the crisp, white sheets hastily, hot tea sloshing onto his sweater as he clumsily clambered out of bed. His head was spinning, but he ignored it as his stockinged feet touched the cold, stone floor.
"So, what d'ya think?" Harry asked curiously.
"That's good. I was worried you were just gonna leave it alone."
Bubo just looked blankly back at him with wide, orange, unblinking orbs.
Great. Just great. Why did it always feel like either Ron or Hermione was tailing him? It didn't matter where he went! To the bathroom to take a quick leak, to his dorm for some sleep, or to the astronomy tower for some much-needed personal space, Ron and Hermione were close behind him. He was beginning to feel suffocated, though he would never admit it.
was in the room. It wasn't Peeves. That troublesome ghost was nowhere to be seen. Draco collapsed onto the damp floor and pressed his head against the wall, his eyes wide with alarm as he looked frantically around the room.
Harry watched Ron with sudden interest. Did he actually see something for once?
Harry walked down the east corridor heading to DADA with Hermione and Ron, his eyes red and swollen. Ron and Hermione were chatting excitedly about the upcoming Quidditch game against Hufflepuff, and Harry was trying to seem enthusiastic, but he couldn't.  As they were walking, they spotted Dumbledore standing in front of their classroom.
Honestly, Malfoy was a decent enough bloke underneath it all. His sense of cruelty and satisfaction in the suffering of others was still just as much a part of him as it had been before. But, instead of taking it out on the trio as he had done, he used it to sneer and shout insults at anyone prejudiced enough to comment out loud. The occasional word or two against Harry would spill out of someone's mouth, and no sooner had it rolled off of their tongue than Draco had clocked them squarely in the face or threatened to hex them.
Draco looked embarrassed. "You ever have. . . nightmares? Or like, flashbacks or something of the sort?" he asked shyly.
"You sound like a bunch of girls," Ron grumbled moodily, rolling his eyes slightly. He flung his bag roughly over his shoulder and jogged ahead of the snickering trio, weaving his way through the tightly packed body of young scholars.
Feeling violently ill, Harry shoved the ball away with a forceful push, making it roll off of the table and shatter into pieces on the floor with a loud
"Don't think. Just eat." Harry urged him.
"Been given a clean bill of health now, have we. . ." Ron mumbled, following Hermione's gaze with a wary eye.
"Hey, mate! Sorry I'm late," Ronald Weasley panted, as he dropped his book bag carelessly on the floor and collapsed beside Harry. "What'd I miss?"
Harry's voice called to him through the piercing sound of the thundering rain, and Draco glanced over his shoulder, losing his balance and stumbling over his own feet, plunging head-first into the muck. He tried desperately to get up, but the ground was slick and damp and cold enough to freeze against his skin.
He was older, maybe in his late twenties. He recognized his surroundings. He was in his godfather's gloomy old house, sitting on the sagging sofa, his head resting dejectedly in his hands as he emitted low, guttural sobs that wrecked his body. Harry could almost feel the pain. He realized that what he was seeing was what he had been the most afraid of.
Harry couldn't help but smile back, his heart skipping. "The Hippogriff," he chuckled, and then he raised his voice shrilly in a mocking tone, "'
"Shut up," Harry blushed furiously and lowered his voice. "They're
Hermione seemed to be staring right through him. "Alright," she said softly. "Goodnight, Harry."
No sooner had the words slipped out of Draco's mouth then he suddenly flew across the room and smacked into the wall with a loud
"Malfoy!"
"Thanks, you old fart," Draco stroked the bird's feathers lightly, gazing miserably into it's dilated orange orbs. "Go sleep! You're probably tired. Okay?"
Draco noticed and smiled in response. "Oh, don't mind this. I only sprained it a bit. It'll heal up right quick,"
"Potter, step aside."
"Is that why you hated me?" Harry asked, resting his arms on Malfoy's broadening shoulders and staring breathlessly into the Slytherin's stunning grey eyes.
When Draco finally broke the kiss, Harry took a moment to open his eyes and catch his breath, still pressed against the wall with Malfoy's body flush against his. Happiness swirled in the pit of his stomach like a stirring cauldron.
Draco nudged Harry playfully, "C'mon, quit it!"
As Draco's lips moved against his, he swore to himself that if this was what love felt like, he would be willing to risk everything to protect it. He would suffer the Cruciatis curse a hundred times if it meant he could relive this moment and relish it forever.
"Draco," Harry warned him.
A soft whisper just barely reached Draco's ear, and he immediately felt his lungs inflate with air. He gasped, reeling over the sink clutching at his throat. What was that? Was that a spell he'd just heard?!
Harry beamed at the sound of Draco's voice. He slid closer to Neville Longbottom and patted the empty space between himself and one of the Weasley twins. Draco hesitated for a moment, glancing at Ron sheepishly before squeezing himself onto the bench. His green dress robes stood out like a sore thumb.
Finally, he stepped into the dining room, and their laughter died behind him as he made his way to the seat opposite of the fireplace - the middle of the long, narrow table. His father sat silently at one end, and his mother at the other. The Malfoys' dining room was even gloomier than Draco's cold, empty bedroom, despite the fire that roared in the massive stone fireplace. It was longer than it was wide, with a wooden table that spanned most of the room's length. The candles that flickered over their heads gave the room a sort of sinister, ghostly atmosphere.
He heard the bathroom door opening again, and hurried footsteps echoed off of the stone floor behind him.
Draco awakes in the Hogwarts infirmary and realizes who saved him.
"Alteration," Draco held his breath, wondering if Harry was going to do what he was hoping.
Ron didn't look convinced, but before he could say anything else (Thank God), Professor Trelawney had finally taken her place in front of the classroom.
Forcing himself to his feet, he stumbled through the crowd, shouldering his way through desperately, feeling like he was drowning in the sea of angrily shouting teenagers.
It was. He had puked up clumps of wet, soggy dirt and grass. Some of it was tinged red with blood. He felt sick again.
"Shut up, Ron!"
Ron was curious. "When did. . . when was . . ." he stammered awkwardly. "Um, when did you start feeling things?"
"Fuck!" He coughed, "Fuck, fuck, fuck."
"Thank you," he whispered through his chapped lips. He took another sip, his smile broadening despite his vertigo and his nausea.
Harry and Hermione laughed.
Harry laughed joyously, "Yes, yes, it's me. I'm here." He squeezed Draco's hand tightly and kissed it, his tears still falling. "I'm here, Draco."
"Draco, are you alright, sweetheart?"
She smiled tenderly at him, though her anxiety was still visible in every little wrinkle on her kind, motherly face. "You fell last night and hit your head pretty badly. Do you remember anything? Anything at all?"
"Ron!" Hermione gaped at the Weasley incredulously.
Ron groaned in exasperation, his face still a burning hot red. "W-what?! No!"
"Yeah. I do."
Hermione handed the note back to Harry and crossed her arms again, straightening her shoulders as she smirked up at Draco. "And Dumbledore is a genius. He probably charmed you without you noticing."
"Didn't your mother teach you not to stare, or do the Weasleys pay no heed to manners?" Draco yelled at him over a peal of thunder.
"Are you . . . are you, uh, and Malfoy . . ?" Ron cut himself off mid-sentence, clearly struggling to work things over in his head.
"Leave it, Hermione," Ron shot back, indignant, his nostrils flaring.
-Lana Rafaela
Draco cleared his throat again and gestured wildly for a moment, struggling to find words, his heart still racing in his chest. "Oh, um, uh," he squeezed his eyes shut and snapped his fingers, concentrating. "Ah, yes! The Pepperup Potion! The bloody Pepperup! Been takin' two spoonfuls every day. Bloody disgusting it is, but it sure as hell does the trick."
Harry reluctantly lifted his head and gave Ron a dreary smile. "Not much," he sighed. "Trelawney hasn't told us what we're doing yet, but it seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?"
"Um, hi."
Harry's ears were burning again. "No, okay?! We haven't exactly had that discussion yet. The whole 'love' thing just sort of slipped out."
"Okay, " Harry replied hesitantly.
"Harry?" Hermione jogged his shoulder roughly.  "Harry,  you have to listen!  I'm trying to help you, so will you please pay me some attention and stop stuffing your face like a Thanksgiving turkey?!"
"Did you mean it? The other day?"
At dinner, when Draco let go of Harry's hand and began to walk to his table, he felt his heart sink in his chest and ache longingly. He couldn't be away from him - even for a moment.
Draco's smirk transformed into a devilish grin as he turned to look at his ex-arch nemesis with quirked eyebrows. "Well, what d'ya know,"
The silvery color of the clouds perfectly mirrored Draco's stormy eyes, and Harry felt his heart flutter at the welcome reminder, the tiniest of whimsical smiles flickering across his lips as a warm blush colored his cheeks.
"Well, that's a bloody relief! To think that the Chosen One lives in such a hovel is staggering."
Someone jostled his shoulder, and Harry awoke with a start. Ron grinned down at him.
Draco didn't care to argue. Instead, he narrowed his eyes at Ron scornfully from beneath his dampened hood.
Harry groaned and opened one eye so that he could see Ron's round, intrusive face. "I wanted to talk to Malfoy." He replied casually.
Draco started walking, following in Harry's footsteps. Crabbe and Goyle rose to follow him, but he shook his head, and they happily sat back down to help themselves to more pudding.
Harry's smile vanished, and he looked at Draco concernedly. "Here, um, have my toast. You have to eat something. C'mon."
Draco could hear his heart racing in his ears, panic making his blood boil and his stomach curdle. He wanted to scream again, and he felt a distinctive lump rising in his throat, making it difficult to swallow and difficult to speak. His eyes were burning, and he could feel a warm liquid begin to flood them, blurring his vision.
Madame Pomfrey's face darkened, and she looked up at Harry with sad eyes. "He's gone, Harry. . . He's gone."
Draco's eyes glistened, and Harry's chest ached unbearably at the sight. He pulled Draco back into his arms and held him again, tightly, not in the least bit willing to let him go.
doing it?"
"Have not," A small smirk tugged at Draco's lips, and his eyes twinkled merrily. "I've done nothing but focus on my work, and you should probably do the same."
Was he dreaming? Perhaps he'd drifted off on the desk and was currently drooling on his Potions book like a bloody fool in front of the whole class, and more importantly, in front of Harry.
The paper was cool and crisp, and Draco's meticulous script appeared boldly in ink across the exterior of the carefully folded parchment. The paper's edges were somewhat yellow from decay, but the smell of fresh ink strongly lingered upon the mysterious envelope.
"Harry, what the bloody hell is wrong with you?" Ron demanded, immediately joining Harry at his side as they climbed the stone steps. "Why the hell are you worried about Malfoy? I mean, of all people!"
"What d'you want, Potter?" Draco hissed back. He knew the answer.
It was after midnight. Seamus and Neville were asleep, the curtains drawn shut around their beds, leaving Draco with a sleeping Harry and Ron, sitting sluggishly on his bed staring at the floor, lost deep in thought.
Draco directed the sneer towards Harry instead, and Harry felt his heart skip a beat. "No, that's repulsive." The sneer changed into an amused smile. "I would rather feed myself to a mountain troll."
Harry felt his eyes burn as tears filled them. He felt again for a pulse, but it was hopeless. There was nothing. Harry threw himself on top of the body, pressing his head against the Slytherin's shallow chest. Still, he heard nothing, not even so much as the faintest of heartbeats. The room was silent, and all he could hear was the sound of the air rushing through his ears and the sound of his own panicked breathing and his heart hammering against his rib-cage.
Harry fell to his knees at Draco's side, Ron and Hermione following closely behind him. His throat constricted, and his heart broke seeing Draco like this. He threw the Golden Snitch carelessly aside and lifted Draco's head into his arms as the Slytherin's limp body thrashed against the ground.
So. . . this was going to be how Draco Malfoy died. How splendid! Capital headline it would make for the Daily Prophet. Rita Skeeter would be thrilled! What a tragic story. The wizarding world was very fond of those after all. . .
"Come along, then."
He watched as his older self lifted his head, his hair wildly disheveled, his eyes red and swollen. He grabbed something lying on the sofa beside him and clutched it to his chest, his body shaking violently with silent grief.
"Wonder what this is about," Ron groaned.
But he didn't shed a single tear.
"Bye,"
Draco caught his breath as he heard Harry moving nearer to the door.
"Oh," Draco felt a knot of dread forming in the pit of his stomach, "What do you mean?"
Harry shook his head and pulled him into a loving embrace. "Don't be."
Draco felt like he'd lost the ability to breathe. The whole world felt as if it had gone out of focus, and the only thing he could see was Harry's lips and his forest-green eyes. Without giving it so much as a second thought, Draco reached out to cup Harry's face in his hands as he leaned forward to press his lips against his.
"W-what are you talking about, Professor? " Draco asked unconvincingly.
"I love you," Draco breathed hoarsely. "I love you more than anything. I always have. Since I met you."
The ride felt unbearably long to Draco. Even with the girl sitting between them, butterflies seemed to wrest tirelessly inside his stomach. He shifted uncomfortably, bowing his head and staring angrily at his soiled shoes.
Hermione's curls bounced gracefully over her shoulders as she turned to smile amusedly at Draco. "The game tonight, silly," she teased. "Slytherin against Gryffindor, remember? Are you back on the team yet?"
No. Harry couldn't even bring himself to finish the last question, and yet, he still couldn't quiet the tremulous little voices in his head. He was afraid. Maybe he shouldn't look. Perhaps he should ask to go to the loo.
"What is it?" he finally asked, breaking the stale silence between them. "What do you see?"
"I don't bloody know," Draco laughed, "We'll switch partners. Granger likes me enough. I'll take her, and you can have Weasley."
Ron grimaced noticeably at his words, and Draco's eyes widened, confused as Harry tightened his grip on him and began to shake violently. There was so much pain and anguish in the sound of Harry's voice. This seemed a little too much like grief. There was a dark, nagging feeling at the back of Draco's brain that told him he wasn't crying over his parents. What could this possibly be about? What had he seen in that stupid ball?
kind. He opened his mouth as wide as he could, his eyes burning with tears. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't fucking breathe!
Draco grimaced slightly and felt the need to lie, but he went against his instinct. He didn't need to lie anymore.
His voice seemed to bounce off of the walls, mocking him. He closed his eyes and focused on his breathing. Just one breath at a time, right? So simple.
Hermione gawked at him in amazement. "I've never seen you with this big of an appetite,"
Draco heard Harry's hand slip off of the door handle, and he let out a low sigh of relief, shutting his eyes and hoping to hear Harry's voice again.
Draco squirmed slightly, feeling his hands shake. The urge to vomit was growing stronger. "Oh, r-really?"
"Watch yourself, Draco," Snape said in his nasal voice.
Draco froze, his lungs seizing up as his heart jumped into his throat. "P-professor Snape? " he choked.
"Hey, Potter."
"Disgusting," he muttered. "Fuck."
"Not now, Ron!" Harry avoided the Great Hall, turning towards the winding corridor to find the hospital wing. "Get Madame Pomphrey!" He called over his shoulder. "Now! I think he's dying!"
"Merlin's beard! " Ron groaned,  "just go to bed,  mate. "
To his right, he heard Harry chuckle softly and give his hand a slight squeeze.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Why on earth do you care?"
Harry, still clasping Draco's hand tightly, followed Hermione down the corridor to Professor McGonagall. Her aged face was lined with worry as she watched Lucius Malfoy stride quickly around the bend, maddened determination marking his steps.
"It was nothing."
Draco brushed a single lonesome tear from his cold cheek and turned to find the house-elf, Wilky, standing timidly in the open doorway. He was frightened of Draco, although he didn't have much of a reason of late. The Malfoy heir had kept mostly to himself over the summer and had, for the most part, been more sympathetic to the Malfoy house-elves than he used to make a habit of.
"What on earth are you going on about," she laughed nervously, "Lie back down, sweetie."
"If it hadn't been for him, you'd most likely be dead. You weren't in the best condition, you know."
Ron nodded grimly. "I couldn't agree more."
"Harry, what did Snape want?"
The pecan pudding pie melted in Harry's mouth as he slowly ate, his thoughts trailing off into space as he stared with furrowed brows over the crowded Gryffindor table. He kept thinking about Ron's vision in the crystal ball,  Draco's apparent fear of Professor Snape,  and of course,  as per usual,  Draco himself.
Draco heard Ron and Hermione breathing hard behind him. He shook his head and gagged again as he struggled to speak.
The moment those defiant words fell from Draco's lips, a deathly silence filled the room. Lucius glared at his son with a mix of both horror and indignation. He was momentarily stunned, speechless. Harry ventured a glimpse at Dumbledore, and he swore he saw the hint of a triumphant grin beneath his long, white beard, the older man's eyes twinkling in the darkened room.
George grinned wickedly. "Who's top?"
Harry frowned and rolled onto his side, twisting the blankets around himself as he stared at Ron's empty bed. He wished he could talk to someone about it.  Let it off his chest.  At the moment,  he didn't know what to think.  He couldn't be sure what he was feeling.
"I suppose I have," Lucius replied bitterly, glaring at the Headmaster with an expression very similar to Draco's. "But I will say one more thing," he approached his son slowly, the floor creaking noisily beneath his feet.
Ron was drooling on his pillow, Neville was snoring, and Seamus was sound asleep. Harry let out a sigh of relief and then smiled broadly, turning back to the expectant owl and pulling a rolled-up piece of paper out of its short beak. He replaced it with his own, watched as the owl flapped out the window, and then he eagerly unfolded his note.
It was a death omen.
"He carried you all the way here, and he waited with you," Madam Pomphrey went on enthusiastically. "It was quite unlike him if I do say so myself! I-"
Harry laughed, and he opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by an anxious-looking Hermione.
Only it really wasn't. Earlier, Ron had explained Harry's breakdown and what had caused it, and Draco had decided to peek into the future for himself. Maybe Harry was wrong. They would have a future together, right? A quaint little house not too far from the Ministry, maybe adopt a stray cat or a dog. Draco had always wanted one. His father had never allowed it. They were too untidy for his taste.
"Deal, Malfoy."
Narcissa imagined the scandal, the falsifications, and the misconceptions that would fill the head-titles and the articles on the front page of every Daily Prophet. She imagined Draco cowering from the cameras, wincing with every blinding flash, and she quickly turned and rushed from the room to find a parchment, a quill, and her owl.
Harry gave him a reassuring look. "It's okay, Draco. I'm with you."
Draco reached up with his free hand to gently slide his fingers along Harry's flushed cheek and into his wildly disheveled hair. "Do you know how long I wanted to be close to you like this? It was maddening."
"Draco cannot continue to study here, so long as Harry Potter is under the same roof. I cannot allow it! Do you know how it feels to have your entire family legacy fragmented by your son? That is precisely what is happening, and I can't let it go any further! I don't know whether this thing he has for the Potter boy is a mutual sentiment, but-"
Harry watched Ron's head of bright red hair bob up and down as he walked, the boy's long,  lanky legs taking unusually long,  fast-paced strides. Harry groaned as he struggled to quicken his pace to match,  but his shorter legs refused to cooperate.
"Draco! Wake up!"
"A moment of your precious time, Draco?"
Suddenly,  he understood. . .
"I would've," Blaise muttered.
Harry shook his head and loosened the collar of his robes,  rubbing his eyes tiredly.
pair, though I think you're children would be a little-" he clicked his tongue and circled his index finger next to his temple.
Run huffed and pushed the ball towards Harry, crossing his arms over his chest. "Alright," he grumbled. "Your turn."
Draco started, lifting his head up from the table with a loud gasp as he filled his lungs with air, his body shaking. His distorted vision cleared, and he looked around in shock, taking in his surroundings.
Voldemort, or his mother and father.
Draco smiled back, although it lacked luster. "They aren't my friends, so . . . by all means, go for it! The best of luck to you, though I'm sure you don't need it."
"Good, "
"Oh, god," she whispered, reaching out to touch an odd lump in the Slytherin's left wrist. "That's definitely shattered. Harry, you need to take him to the hospital wing right now. Merlin's pants! He's bleeding! Harry, quick!"
"Nothing,"
It was Saturday morning. He had the weekend to catch up on his sleep and his homework. He needed to study. He had fallen so far behind in the past few months that Hermione had nearly given up on assisting him. Thankfully, she was devoted to her friends and would never allow Harry to fall behind if she could lend a hand.
"You okay?!"
"Sorry I wasn't at dinner, Potter. Had to catch up on Charms. I forgot how bloody hard some of the lessons were. This one, in particular, has been a bloody challenge, and I haven't. . . ." he stopped dead in his tracks, finally having looked up from the pages of his book to digest the scene before him. His face darkened. "Harry?"
Harry met his friend's questioning gaze and shrugged feebly,  suddenly feeling nervous. "I don't know," he said, baffling even himself. "I don't know whether it's because I want to find out what he's up to or if it's because I'm genuinely concerned for him. I'll be damned if it's the last one.  I never dreamed I'd ever give Malfoy a second thought,  but here I am. "
"Malfoy?"
Draco swallowed hard, trying to put his anxiety into words. "When. . . you said you loved me in the infirmary." he fidgeted with the flap of Harry's coat pocket nervously. "It's just, you know, I've been thinking about it, and I don't know. It feels weird to say it now."
. . if Lucius Malfoy knew just
"I love you, sweetheart," Narcissa Malfoy shot her son a troubled, anxious smile before curtly waving him farewell and disappearing as they walked through the brick wall and off of platform 9/3.
Draco swore loudly, stood up from the table, and stormed out of the hall, leaving Harry completely and utterly mortified as he realized that he had just come out to everyone in the nearby vicinity. Horrified, he buried his face in his arms on the table, his face burning with embarrassment. What had just happened?
Harry's nose was buried in his book, a tangled mess of his raven hair hiding his face.
"I don't know!" Harry blurted, panicking as he watched Draco's eyes roll into the back of his head. "He said something about dementors and then ran from me."
"Fine, don't eat that, but please eat something, Malfoy." Harry squeezed Draco's hand beneath the table, and they shared a flushed smile.
A peal of thunder shook the stadium, and Draco wrapped his arms around his body, cringing fearfully at the sound, the smell of sulfur filling his nostrils. He walked as quickly as he could, but his legs felt stiff as if his joints were freezing with fear. It was an all too familiar feeling, and his stomach lurched sickeningly.
Footsteps and voices echoed down the corridor. Harry clutched Draco desperately, gripping his hand so tightly he thought he might have been crushing it. He told himself he was wrong. Draco was alright. Draco was fine. He had to be. Things between them couldn't end. It had only just started. . .
"Madame Pomfrey and I have agreed on what caused Draco's condition."
"Who was it, Ron?" Harry asked in a whisper.
Draco's blue, sunken eyes slowly and fluttered open, and he spoke. His voice sounded weak and husky, but it was the most beautiful thing Harry had ever heard. "Potter,"
He heard Draco suck in a breath and felt him tighten his grip on his robes as if he were clinging to him for dear life. "I. . . I-I. . . " Draco stammered, "I love you, too, Potter,"
Narcissa's dusky eyes skipped over her son's familiar scrawl, and her expression became softer, unlike her husband's. Lucius rose from his leather-bound chair and leaned against the stone mantle, massaging his temple as if to soothe a migraine.
"I seriously doubt that's going to happen anytime soon, "
He was straight. . .
He knew.
Draco still could not compel himself to believe that any of this was real. Was he still unconscious? Was he still dying on a cot in the Hogwarts infirmary? If he was,  he didn't mind. Because here he was, walking side-by-side with Harry Potter himself through the halls of Hogwarts. It didn't matter if any of it was real. It didn't matter if the warmth of Harry's hand was a figment of his imagination because whether or not it was, he was still the one holding it.
explode, and Harry would never forgive him. He chuckled into Harry's lips at the thought.
The long-awaited Quidditch match ended shortly after it began, with Harry waving the Golden Snitch over his head in triumph and wearing a dazzling smile on his beaming face. Overflowing with Gryffindors, the stands erupted into cheers, and their screams of "
Harry leaned in and pressed his forehead to Draco's, closing his eyes. "I love you," he whispered.
"But,  for some reason,  I... I can't stop thinking about Draco. "
Where was he?
"Sit," Hermione told him, smiling warmly.
"Oh, perk up, Harry! Nothing's changed. He's still staying here." Hermione giggled, noticing Harry's crestfallen expression.
"Hurry!"
"But, Madam Pomphrey said you have to eat to gain-"
"Draco?" he whispered, trembling. "C'mon, Draco. Wake up!" He shook him violently. His frail body was limp like a rag doll.
"Had enough staring at my sickly mug yet, or are you enjoying the view?" Draco snapped, fists clenched at his sides.
"Good luck finding him, you old fart," Draco sighed.
There was a din outside the door of his compartment - feet scuffling hastily by, girls laughing, boys jeering. Draco could hear himself breathing in the dark, quiet space, and for once, he felt nothing. The pain he'd felt beforehand had evaporated with his tears, and he was left feeling deadened inside. He sat there expressionless in the dark, waiting wordlessly for the racket to fade in his ears. After a few minutes, it was soundless, and Draco weakly stood, gripping the window-ledge for support as he helped himself up.
The boy's health was quickly diminishing.  He was thinner now - dangerously so,  and his expression never varied from that sickly, empty look. He was a seemingly blank canvas with sunken eyes rimmed in red. Harry was finding himself more and more preoccupied with thoughts of Draco and his growing illness rather than his schooling. As a result,  his grades were rapidly falling. Hermione was mortified,  but there wasn't much she could do to help him at this point. He was obsessed with Draco it was driving him mad,  and only Ron and Hermione could see it.  Harry remained oblivious to the obvious.
"Blimey, those were yours?" he asked, aghast. "But. . ."
"Bloody hell, Harry," Ron muttered. "Even Dumbledore is breaking the rules now."
Harry pulled up a chair and sat down, shoulders slumping.
He was alone.
It was quiet on this side of the castle, as silent as the grave. Not even the mice seemed to stir as they slept quietly in their nests. Just the sound of Draco's labored breathing seemed to fill the lavatory and echo off of the walls and corridors of Hogwarts. He gagged, his stomach clenching, and he gripped the dripping sides of the porcelain sink for support, trembling weakly. He wasn't sure how much more of this he could take! His body was falling apart, and he didn't know what to do. Madame Pomphrey had given him express orders to stay as calm and relaxed as he possibly could over the course of the coming school year. She said it was critical to his health and warned him specifically to get extra rest and nutrition. Draco scoffed. As if his kind of life would permit him anything of the sort!
Harry snorted a little too loudly. "Ron, I think that's your reflection." he retorted.
Snape smirked knowingly. "Draco Malfoy, I think you know what I am referring to. . . "
Draco had known where the Gryffindor Common Room and dorms were, but he had never been inside. The portrait hole was smaller than he had thought it was, but it was still more than large enough to fit through. Legs dangling over the edge of the wall, Draco took in his surroundings.
Students hurried past him without so much as a glance, ignoring him and just chatting excitedly as they walked on by, a blur of familiar faces. Neville Longbottom. Seamus Finnigan. Blaise Zabini. Pansy Parkinson.
Fred looked back at him briefly before quickly looking away, a somber expression on his long, pale face before he straightened his robes, glanced strangely at his brother, and left. George's eyes lingered on Draco, however, and the Slytherin stiffly stared back.
"With me!" Harry chirped thoughtlessly.
"It's just. . . you'd never abandon us for him,  would you?" Ron suddenly asked tentatively.
"Erm, it's breakfast time," Ron said, clearing his throat. "We're about to head down if you want to come along."
?" Draco hissed. "If you mean my arm, of course, it is. I practically shattered it. It'll be smarting for weeks."
"I do," Ron mumbled under his breath. Hermione jabbed him purposefully with her elbow, and he grunted unappreciatively in response.
What if the three muggle-loving blood-traitors were able to disclose his identity? He could only imagine the great Chosen One's response when he ascertained the absurdity of the situation.
Knowing Harry the way he did, he knew that the boy wouldn't laugh or scorn him. It would shock him undoubtedly, maybe it would anger him for some unknown reason, and he'd even be the slightest bit disgusted - but he would never laugh. Never. Harry wasn't a filthy git like he was.
"Why is he so sick?  Why has he been acting so odd?  What was that letter he got all about? "
Reluctantly, Draco broke the kiss and pressed their foreheads together. Harry's eyes were closed as he caught his breath.
Harry met his glare with a grin. "I wouldn't have it any other way," he answered coolly. Draco squeezed his hand tenderly, and Harry felt his chest swell with courage.
Maybe he had just imagined it. . .  Oh,  who was he trying to kid?  No one can imagine feelings as distinct as that.   But then again,  there was no way he could be interested in Malfoy,  was there?   Harry shriveled in his chair and chewed unconsciously at his nails as he stared expressionlessly into the orange flames.
A large, fierce-looking owl suddenly appeared from around the tower and flew clumsily in through the window, landing roughly on Harry's knee, talons digging into his skin through his pajama bottoms.
"You heard me. "
The gargoyle statue stared down at Draco, talons raised, ready to pounce, and the Slytherin shrank back in fear.
Surprisingly enough, Draco's response lacked malice and seemed rather more timid and fearful than anything. Harry licked his lips. "Nothing. I was just wondering how you were feeling."
After receiving several derogatory comments from Snape on his potion, after class was finally dismissed, Harry shouldered his book-bag and told Ron and Hermione to go on ahead. They were confused, but they did, so Harry approached the table where Draco was hastily packing up his things.
Draco smiled again. "We should go check,"
"What? "
The corridors of the castle were silent. The only sound the muted crackling of fire from the torches on the walls above them, and the distant sound of a leaking faucet, a soft
Hermione gave him a shrug and then turned to Harry, waiting for an explanation.
Harry's fingers tickled the back of his hand as it bumped against him and then delicately wove their fingers together in the folds of his robe. He tried to swallow the happy lump in his throat, but he couldn't. He gave Harry a sideways glance, beaming. Harry was smiling the goofiest smile, and that made Draco laugh out loud.
Ron spoke up, and this time he sounded frustrated. "C'mon, let's just go, Harry! The train is going to take off again in a few minutes, and I, for one, didn't intend on heading back to London."
"Make me, Malfoy!" Harry giggled, his cheeks flushed.
Draco's breath hitched, his heart pounding in his ribs.
"Always,"
"Hey, Ron!"
Slowly, Draco breathed in the cold, frigid air and began to walk up the cramped stairway, Harry following closely behind him, still firmly clasping his hand in his. This was it.
Draco could feel his father's hot breath on his face, and his nostrils flared with contempt. His blood boiled, prompting his heart to thump madly in his ears, the blood-pumping mass hurling itself violently against his ribs as if it were about to burst.
"Yeah. You comin' with?"
There it was again. That mischievous twinkle. "If you insist, Potter,"
All Harry could hear was his heart thumping loudly in his ears.
Harry shot Malfoy one last meaningful glance before turning tail and heading out of the classroom and into the dark corridor. Strangely enough, he couldn't shake Draco's fearful expression when he saw Snape. Draco had always been the Professor's little pet, so why would he ever be afraid of him? What in the bloody hell was going on?
"What?" he snapped aggressively, vaguely annoyed.
Draco grabbed Harry's empty glass, and it filled itself as he raised it to his lips. "In Slytherin, there's a fewer selection of decent blokes to chose from," he took a drink and licked his lips slightly. "They're all complete idiots as far as I'm concerned. You're lucky you're in Gryffindor."
"Harry?" Ron said slowly, processing what he had just witnessed.
"No promises."
"Make that 10," Draco gagged. "No . . . 20."
Draco nodded again and gazed up at Harry with glistening eyes. He swallowed hard, the lump in his throat painful and unmoving. "I'm scared, Potter," he whispered.
Harry smiled. "No, but it's alright. I feel fine. Better than fine, actually."
Hermione gently laid a hand on Harry's arm,  anticipating what he was going to say,  and Ron simply stared at Harry with wide,  narrowed eyes.
"Should I send it, Bubo?" Draco asked, glancing shortly at his owl, "I'm not confident that my protection spells are going to conceal my identity effectively. Knowing Potter and his retarded friends, they'll probably find some criminal way to break through them."
"What?" Harry groaned back.
"Damn it," Harry rose clumsily from his bed and gave the twins a telling look. "Well?"
Hermione sighed heavily and gave Harry a meaningful glance, shuffling closer to her friend's side. "Harry," she whispered urgently, "you need to tell him. And soon."
Draco hummed bemusedly in agreement and fumbled around in his bag.
Draco opened his own book and was about to start reading when his own eyes skittishly wandered. Harry quickly looked away, feeling embarrassed. He hated this feeling. He hated that he knew what it was. His mouth felt dry, and he felt his stomach tying itself into knots, but he looked back up again, only to briefly meet the Slytherin's cool gaze. The two boys' eyes widened almost at once, and they both turned back to their books. The words all seemed cluttered together. Suddenly, a thought hit him. . . He felt a smile tugging at his lips, and he checked to make sure Hermione or Ron wasn't watching before he pinched a page between his fingers and slowly began to pull. He soundlessly tore it out. He drew his wand out of his sleeve and discreetly pointed it at the paper.
"Shut it,  Ron.  Anyway,  Harry,  if you don't get this done, you'll have the lowest grade in the class.  If you don't pass this year,  you'll be held back. "
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco quickly cut him off, reaching out to shove the boy up against the opposite compartment. He could feel Harry's hurried breath hot on his face. Draco saw directly into the boy's wide, bewitching eyes. It drove him mad. He couldn't have him. He could never have him. Why was he so gorgeous, damn it!?
"Fine! I love you!"
Things had been different lately. Voldemort had barely crossed his mind, and although he was aware that nothing had changed, that the Dark Wizard was ever on the move, it somehow felt more distant. . . less dangerous.
"Harry," he breathed, "I don't think it was just a dream."
"Are you alright?" Draco heard Hermione ask, her concerned voice muffled through the walls.
Still, he couldn't sleep. He couldn't stop thinking about Draco. . .
Slowly, he reached out and laid his hand on Harry's back, giving him a pat or two. He shifted uncomfortably, unaccustomed to providing comfort like this. What did he do when Hermione was like this? He tried to think. Oh, who was he kidding? She was never like this.
The shrill ringing of the bell broke the tension, and suddenly, it was over. Draco jerked upwards as if he had awoken from a drunken slumber. He swallowed hard and cleared his throat to compose himself as he assembled his things, slamming his book shut and shoving it nervously into his shiny, black leather shoulder bag.
"I don't know," Harry said. He wasn't lying. He truly didn't know. Dumbledore only had guessed.
"She's such a joke," Draco pierced the egg yolk with the prong of his fork, watching angrily as the yellow puss oozed from the broken skin. "acting all self-righteous! She's not exactly a healthy specimen herself - if you get my meaning."
The air was cold. His nose was runny and red, and he could barely breathe. His glasses were fogged up, and he could barely see. . . but he could still feel, and he swore Draco's weak, delicate fingers squeezed his hand.
Ron narrowed his eyes at him,  his white lashes catching in the torchlight. Looking suspicious,  he slowly asked, "Do you mean it? "
Harry rolled his eyes and folded his arms around his knees, only just then realizing he had forgotten to get his robes from Malfoy. Oh well. He'd have to ask at dinner. He would have remembered if it wasn't for Snape. . .
Draco groaned out loud and collapsed back onto his bed, burying his face in his hands and then running his fingers tiredly through his hair.
Harry sat down in the armchair beside his and stared into the fire, "Well,  no.  I wouldn't. "
But it had.
Halfway through Potions class, and halfway through brewing one of the most putrid smelling potions Harry had ever concocted, Draco Malfoy finally staggered into the dark dungeon classroom. His hair was madly disheveled. One side was pressed flat against his head, while the other side was standing up completely on end. Harry looked down into his steaming cauldron, smirking to himself as he stirred the lumpy green liquid. For the first time, Draco didn't look like a sneering snob or a prig. He looked like a first-year who had gotten lost in the corridors and walked into the wrong classroom.
Draco felt his cheeks burn with shame as they stood apart in silence.
"I'm absent for one week, and this is what they start feeding us?" Draco exclaimed.
Harry saw Draco's sad eyes, and as they parted, the Slytherin could see the worry immediately cloud the shorter boy's youthful face.
"You looked like a ghost of yourself. Do you know what I mean?"
It was the Dark Mark. Ron had tried to mention it to him several times, but Draco would feign ignorance, marking it up as a lingering side-effect of his injury from the Quidditch match that one night, and then walking away or changing the subject.
At long last, they rolled through the gates up the sweeping drive, the carriage swaying a little in the wind. He could see Hogwarts looming nearer and nearer; it's many bright windows glowing through the mist. The carriage came to a halt at the bottom of the stone steps leading up to the front doors. People in the other carriages were already walking up the steps and filing through the doors. Draco eagerly pulled himself to his feet and carefully climbed out of the carriage, his knees almost buckling underneath him. He could feel the weasel appraising him, and his cheeks burned in the cold.
Harry's smile broadened, and he looked down at the floor for a second. "Hey, so, uh, what class d'you have next?"
"I love you, "Harry said, his voice raspy.
Draco shivered at the Professor's tone and glanced longingly after Harry.
"No," he cried, "no. It's all wrong."
charm at his head.
"Alright," Harry nodded and awkwardly pushed up his glasses. "Lead the way, your Majesty." he nudged Draco forward with a grin.
"Look, Ron, Malfoy might be a foul, loathsome creature, but he's still a person, and no one should suffer like that. Just look at him! He looks awful."
"He's fine. We can talk about it later," Harry glanced curiously around the room. "The party is still going on? What time is it?"
"Hey, it's okay. It was. . . it was just a dream." He said softly, though he sounded unsure of his own voice.
"Draco," he said softly. "I meant it. I truly meant it. I could never say it if I didn't."
Draco and Harry dissolved into giggles as the foursome loped up the moving staircase together, surrounded by their excitedly prattling classmates.
Ron squinted, his nose crinkling. "Well, erm, I see. . . a face? But, I can't make out who it is yet."
"How am I going to do that with you right here?"
Draco lingered in his bed for a moment, staring at the wall expressionlessly, lost in thought.
Just as Draco was reaching for the door handle, he heard approaching footsteps and the low hum of voices. He froze for a moment, listening, his head bowed. Was that Granger's voice he heard?
He wondered distractedly.
"Wow," she said speechlessly, "This has never happened before. Ever."
Harry grinned and met Draco's gaze from across the room. He winked.
Ron scowled.
Voldemort chuckled and glanced once more around the circle before looking back at Draco. "He doesn't seem
Harry turned to the large, stone statue and said the words, "Sherbet lemon," and the gargoyle jumped aside, revealing a slowly ascending circular staircase. Upraised voices could instantly be heard, and Draco felt his insides contract. He felt like he might vomit.
"What do you mean?" Harry frowned slightly, taken aback.
"Every night, Professor."
"Yes, Master, Mistress Narcy wants you downstairs," Wilky told him shakily, his tiny legs vibrating underneath his miniature frame.
Draco looked up from the wrinkled parchment, his blood suddenly running cold as he gazed blankly at Blaise's dark hair-line. His heart was beginning to pound inside of his chest, and he could feel his hands begin to shake.
"It was dark, okay? It was cold, and it was loud, and . . ." Draco's voice had become anxious, his face pinched at the memory. "The sky it. . . it was so dark." He gave Harry a helpless look that broke his heart. "I don't know what happened, okay? I just bloody snapped. My mind was all fuzzy, and I couldn't think. I just felt like I needed to run and hide, and I kept thinking about them and what happened, and I don't want it to happen again. If it does, I'll die, and I'm scared of dying, Potter. I don't want to die. I just want everything to be over. I just want to have a normal fucking life!"
But nothing happened.
Harry eagerly grabbed Draco's hand and began to drag him through the Common Room. People were finally beginning to filter out and head to their dorms. Several of Harry's classmates shouted out to him.
"Potter?"
Another peal of thunder tore through the sky, and Draco felt every muscle in his body contract, his face contorting with pain.
"There, there," he breathed, closing his eyes and gently rocking the young Gryffindor back and forth where they stood. "I don't know what you saw, but I'm here. I'm never leaving you, okay? You're stuck with me."
"Because you're coming with us, Malfoy!"
"I believe that this is what happens when a Dementor only succeeds in taking a portion of your soul, Harry, "Dumbledore explained. "This has never happened before, not even in Azkaban."
His eyes were swollen and puffy, and his cheeks were dry and chafed as if he'd been crying in his sleep. Had he? He swallowed, and his gaze unwillingly shifted to his injured arm. Slowly, he slipped it out of his sling and lifted the silk-lined sleeve of his robe, his jaw clenching.
"Dinner?"
Angrily, Lucius shoved the wrinkled parchment into Draco's hand and shouldered him against the wall before turning promptly to Harry, scorn written clearly on his face.
"N-no, Professor,"
First, he studied their faces, and then he noticed their hands, tightly clasped together, and his expression darkened.
Draco's pulse quickened. "He. . . he did?" He moistened his lips.
Hermione ignored him, staring at Draco, looking suddenly confused. "Wait, did Harry sneak you in here? What're you two up to?"
"He was about to!"
"Don't you have somewhere to be?" Snape sneered.
All Draco could do was nod in understanding. Finally, he stood, the room swaying slightly. He looked down at his hands. They were shaking violently. He felt Harry's hand fall gently on his shoulder, and he closed his eyes, focusing on Harry's reassuring touch.
Harry broke eye-contact and stared down at his plate, suddenly aware of how sweaty his palms were.
"Good morning, Harry!" Hermione greeted him cheerfully as she looked up from her copy of the Daily Prophet. "Oh, Lord, Harry, did you sleep at all?"
"Fuck, this potion is a mess. Are you sure we got the ingredients right, Potter?" Malfoy asked incredulously, staring down into the contents of their cauldron with a look of disgust on his pale, pointed face.
The dryness of his mouth,  the unsteady rhythm of his heart,  the fluttering wings in his stomach. . . it wasn't something he was supposed to feel around Malfoy or any other boy.
"Then I should
A murmur of sudden excitement rippled through the classroom, and Harry slowly perked up, his curiosity getting the better of him like it usually did.
Harry nodded and then turned to Draco.
it?!"
Draco couldn't withstand the urge. He peered through the curtain again, his dilated eyes fixed longingly on Harry's back as he hurried to catch up with his friends, his unkempt hair bouncing with each step. And then, like magic, he was gone, and like magic, Draco's broken heart began to ache again.
Draco felt as if his heart were skipping beats. He had to be misreading things. . . right?
"Don't touch me!" Draco spat, batting her clammy hand away, "And no, I'm feeling fine! I don't need Snape to coddle me like a dying toad."
"I want to live. . ."
"Well, at least I'm being fed," Ron jibed, his eyes narrowed spitefully, "you look like a walking sack of bones."
Ron tore his eyes away from Harry and stared intently into the crystal ball perched on top of their table, furrowing his eyebrows in concentration. "Hm. Well, it sounds to me like you're obsessed with him."
"Since when have you cared about my state of health?"
Ron looked untrusting.  "If you're really sorry,  then stop paying any attention to soots like Malfoy.  Pay attention to the people that actually care about you."
"Harry? "
"You're on, mate!"
These passions were entirely one-sided. Draco was quite convinced of that. Not once had Harry wavered. Not once had Harry ever given the slightest suspicion of any kind emotion towards Draco other than contempt and raw, smoldering hatred.
Harry finally tore his eyes away from the ball and set it down on the rickety wooden table beside his bed, twisting his head to look at Ron with his eyes still swimming.
again? He frowned as his stomach tied itself into knots, a cold, hard lump of dread making his insides curdle. He knew what he would see:
Ron snorted. "Other than yourself?"
Harry squealed loudly and shoved the note in his pocket before latching onto Draco's arm and practically dragging him down the hall. "This is brilliant!"
Draco looked stupefied. "Well, bloody hell, Harry!" He ranted. "Things coulda been a lot easier for both of us if you had just let it 'appen. But no, the great Harry Potter just had to go and meddle like he always does. Blimey. . . what the hell did you know anyway? Weren't you raised in a cupboard? What did you know about Slytherin? I'll have you know, great wizards have come from Slytherin, and not all of them were dark wizards. . . albeit, most of them were. . . Still, Harry, you could 'ave saved me a lot of misery if you had just kept your pretty little mouth shut."
"Ronald!" Hermione squealed.
Draco heaved again, his muscles spasming. He choked, barely able to catch his breath as he clutched at the sink with his cold, clammy hands and prayed for the dry-heaving to end. Nothing was coming up. His stomach was empty. He hadn't eaten since the day before when he'd been force-fed in the hospital wing, and yet he still wasn't hungry. The thought of food made him sick to the stomach.
They shook hands, and Draco looked back down at his plate. "Oh, god," he sniveled, and then he hesitantly picked up his fork. He slowly shoveled up a small forkful and then brought it to his lips. "Look at what you've down, Potter. My blood is on your hands."
Harry's nose lightly brushed against his, and Draco softly stroked his cheek and then slid his hands into Harry's wind-blown raven black hair. It was coarse and curly but soft all at once. It was exactly how he had imagined it would feel.
Draco's jaw clenched, and he picked at the dried mud on his robes. "It was just. . . I had a . . . seizure of some sort. Madam Pomfrey said my panic brought it on or something. It was fear-induced. In other words, I brought it on myself like a bludgering idiot."
"Ferret," Harry greeted him in low, threatening tones.
Draco shook his head dismissively and leaned in to whisper in Harry's ear, "I don't want to."
Draco's face paled, even more, looking directly into Harry's bewitching, forest-green eyes. "About what?" he whispered.
Ron had no idea when Harry had become so openly vulnerable, and he definitely had no idea when Harry had begun to care for that dodgy, oily-headed Slytherin. Still, it didn't matter in the end, did it? Ron had spent a lot of time in the past few weeks contemplating the two boy's strange yet compelling relationship, and he had begun to realize that it didn't matter who or what the boy had done before all of this. It had all been a mask, a shield to protect himself from harm, and Ron couldn't say he blamed him, because honestly, he didn't. He would likely have done the same in Malfoy's position, if not worse. Being a part of such a well-known family, having a father like Lucius Malfoy, and being forced to become a Death-Eater? Draco hadn't had many options until now. He had been stuck between a rock and a hard place. He had tormented the three of them so heatedly all of these years out of fear, not out of malice. It had all been a mask to conceal the things he really felt.
The lamplight was dim, but it was enough for Draco to make out the peaceful look on Harry's face as he slept, and the Slytherin felt his heart swell inside his chest. He was sitting on the floor by the window, letting his fingers swim soothingly through the smaller boy's thick mess of tangled black hair. He admired the way the moonlight shone on Harry's face, and he quietly cursed himself for having fallen so hard for The Boy Who Shouldn't Have Lived.
Draco squeezed him back with his uninjured arm, and Harry swore he heard him whimper softly into his shoulder. Harry felt something crumple beneath the Slytherin's robe.
He wasn't fine.  He was panicking.  In the Main Hall, when he was looking at Draco,  he had felt something,  and it was a feeling he knew well.  He'd previously acquainted it with Cho Chang,  but that little spark of interest had long since died, along with his interest in girls and dating. He remembered it all too well, though...
"Hey, wait."
"Yes, Professor Snape?"
He remembered how long he had craved this, staring at him from across classrooms, wondering what it would feel like to hold him, touch him, and kiss him. He wondered how it felt to have a conversation with him, one lacking maliciousness and snarling lips. He wondered what it felt like to be the one to make him smile and laugh, and he had been envious (Oh, so envious!) of Ron and Hermione. They had something with Harry that he wanted but thought he would never have.
Ron looked up, startled. "What? Oh, no, you've already apologized. It's fine."
"How did you find out?" Draco demanded softly, his heart pounding in his ears.
For the past week, he'd been dividing his time between Ron and Hermione and Draco. He was with Hermione and Ron from morning to evening, but he was usually off to the infirmary after dinner in the Great Hall. Harry would even collect Draco's homework from his Professors and then bring it to him at the end of the day. On top of that, he would take as much time as he could before curfew to assist him with it. Most of their time together was spent giggling and ogling at each other. They hardly got anything done, but somehow neither of them cared. Harry felt as if he didn't have a single care in the world. He had never felt so free before, not even on his broom.
She was definitely catching on. . .
"Harry, what're you doing?" Ron asked shiftily. "Why is Malfoy sleeping on the floor like a vagrant?" He narrowed his eyes. "And why were you-"
For a good long minute, they just sat there, Ron giving him a pat or two every so often, and a little squeeze. He stared at the wall over Harry's shoulder and waited, ignoring the fact that it was nearly 10, and soon Neville and Seamus would be heading to bed. God forbid they saw Harry like this! Oh, the ridicule. Those two had been acting distant lately, and Seamus, the more closed-minded of the two, had been making cruel and snippy remarks under his breath lately. He would have a right good laugh at Harry if he saw him like this. Ron knew that Harry had heard all the things that Seamus said, and it made him feel sick to his stomach. Funny how roles had been reversed. Draco was kind-hearted and caring, and Seamus had become sick, twisted, and cruel, leering at Harry every chance he got.
"We were getting fitted for robes, first year, at Madame Malkins," Draco laughed. "He walked in, and I don't think I'd ever been more confused in my life. He looked more confused than me, though. Had no idea what he was doing. It was bloody adorable."
Harry was beet red. He glanced anxiously at Ron and then at Hermione, who was attempting to stifle a laugh.
"No." He gagged. "I was . . . I was buried-" Gag, "alive."
Draco nodded breathlessly, his body doubled over, his arms resting on his knees as he gulped in air, the letter he had written just a few weeks prior crumpled up in his fist.
"Harry,"
"You said something about dementors. What was that about?"
moment. Right now." Harry whispered soothingly.
"Potter?"
His mercury gray eyes darted up and down the passageway, searching the mob anxiously to quiet the apprehensive voices in his head. And then, he saw him . . . .
Harry polished off the rest of his glass and set it down on the table with a satisfying
"Piss off!" He yelled, making Snape glare narrowly at him from across the classroom. "Sorry, Professor." Finally, unable to lift his eyes to meet Ron's confused gaze, he began to speak in soft, muted tones, his voice conflicted. "Look, there's nothing you can do about it, okay? Once it's there, you can't get rid of it. I just have to deal with it. And yes, it hurts!" a vulnerable look washed over Malfoy's twisted features, catching Ron off-guard. "It feels like it's roasting, but all I can do is try to ignore it. You should, too."
Lucius puffed out his chest pompously; his lips curled with malice. "I'm your father. I can do whatever I please," he said. "You are leaving Hogwarts. For good. We are going home, and
Ron grimaced. "Well, the stupid thing was wrong then, so who's to say it wouldn't mess it up again? I'm tellin' you; you can't trust these things." He wrinkled his nose and glared at it as if he could make it disappear.
"Alright, but only because you have regained the ability to walk." Pansy quipped with a smirk as she turned to follow the rest of the class out into the crowded hall.
"Loads," Draco gasped, running a hand through his somewhat disheveled mop of hair. "Thank you for staying with me, Potter."
Professor Snape looked down at Draco with a shocked expression,  as if he'd been struck.  For a moment, the man didn't speak.  He simply watched Draco as he cried, shoulders heaving.  It almost reminded Snape of himself. . .
For a moment, the pain was so intense that Draco thought he might cry out for help. . . But then, his eyes closed, and he felt his legs buckle beneath him. His head smashed into something hard, and then everything went black. The darkness swallowed him whole.
Hermione glanced towards the door with a small smile. "Well, Harry, it looks like your new friend is up and about again."
Hermione glowered at him and turned back to Harry. "Let's go in. If he complains one more time, I swear I'm going to lose my - Harry?"
Draco snickered, his lips hitching into a smirk. "You better, or I'll have to snog you again."
"N-no, Professor. "
Ron's smile fell, and Draco cursed himself again. It was meant to be a joke.
"Bloody hell!" Draco held his bleeding finger and glared icy daggers at his owl, "I hate you with a passion. You know that, right?"
"Okay," Harry sighed, grinning broadly as he collapsed onto his four-poster bed. "C'mon, get over here, Malfoy."
"Can we just go in already?" Ron interrupted Hermione pleadingly, "It's really bloody cold out here."
He'd gone white, his eyes wide, lips pressed tightly together. His chest felt tight.
Draco slowly lowered himself onto the bench beside Harry, who beamed back at him.
She nodded reassuringly, "It's alright. It'll come to you eventually." She reached beside the bed and picked up a steaming cup of tea, "Here you are. I promise this will make you feel better, sweetheart."
"Apparently, a lot more than we did the last time."
"For god's sakes, fix your hair, Draco," Lucius Malfoy commanded bitterly from over Draco's shoulder, handing over the last of his son's luggage. "You hardly look decent. You rarely do."
"Password? "
"T-thirsty,"
After a moment, Lucius finally turned his head and left, leaving the room in silence.
"Be patient, be patient." Trelawney smiled encouragingly, waiting.
"Still, I don't think you should've hit him,"
"Will you two blokes stop whispering to each other already? It's
The Professor's black robes rippled behind him as he slowly circled around the desk and leaned instead against the front of it, staring down at Draco with a menacing glare.
His chest tightened, his breath becoming labored. He forgot about Harry and the joyful celebration happening below him on the pitch. His fingers trembled as he unfastened the buttons at his collar and struggled to breathe, squeezing his eyes shut tight as he fought to drown out the dark, twisted images shooting through his brain faster than he could conjure the ability to think.
"I love you," Harry said huskily, his throat tight. "I always did, I just. . . I didn't know it." He whispered it again. "I love you, Draco."
Harry gave her an appreciative look.
Ron looked up for a moment, his speckled face holding an expression of bewilderment. "'
Draco groaned at the high-pitched, whining drawl of Pansy's voice, a voice that so easily compared to the sound of talons running feverishly down a chalkboard. "I'm not hungry," he said savagely.
Draco grimaced at the sound of his name, and he looked up to see Harry bouncing towards him through the rainy mist, a brilliant smile on his face.
Harry watched Ron uncomfortably. Something was different now. Something seemed off. He saw himself? And someone else?
This time, Draco didn't say anything. He just nodded silently, confused as the bird settled nervously on the table in front of him, ruffling its feathers proudly. Ryu looked pleased with herself as she stuck out her silvery beak, her breath wheezing as Draco reached out to take the tiny fold of paper from her mouth.
Draco wanted to defend Harry,  but he bit his tongue and went on. "He's smart, he's witty, he's forgiving and sometimes a little too curious for his own good, but I like that about him. " he paused for a second,  staring blankly at the dungeon floor. "He's . . . gorgeous.  His eyes.. . they're beautiful. " Draco whimpered softly and cradled his head in his hands.  "But now what,  Professor?  Are you going to tell my father? Please don't! "
Harry chuckled. "Well, I'd say that that's high praise coming from you, Mr. Malfoy."
"I know,"
Draco chuckled and shook his head. "No, it's alright. I deserve that one. Yes, other than myself, Weasley."
"What was that about?"
He knew he shouldn't worry. He kept telling himself that the Slytherin was none of his concern and that he might as well drop his investigation and leave the boy to take care of himself. He could, couldn't he? Harry groaned. He could never forget about Draco as long as he was in this condition. He just couldn't. He was still a human being, not to mention Harry's curiosity was getting the best of him just like it always did. Why was Draco so ill? What had caused all of this? He had to find out.
It was warm, and bright, and filled with people. Laughter and playful conversation rippled through the air, and Draco felt a growing warmth spread through his body as the tiniest of smirks played across his lips.
"You watch yourself," Lucius Malfoy hissed, his voice barely above a whisper, his cold gray eyes staring directly into Draco's soul. The Death Eater proceeded darkly, "Associating with the Dark Lord's one true enemy? Turning your back on your family?" The older man's thin, white lips stretched into a wicked smile. "You may have just sealed your fate, my son."
Harry stirred in his lap slightly and buried his face in Draco's stomach. Ron gave him a severe look.
Draco leaned casually on Potter's shoulder and smirked down at Harry's confused friends.
Ron shook his head.
Suddenly the door was thrown open, and two grinning faces peeked into the room.
Anxious, Harry inched closer, keeping one eye on Malfoy while he delicately reached for the Slytherin's pale hand. Taking it gently in his, he felt with the other for a pulse.
Draco trembled and hastily looked away from the Death Eater, his eyes burning as tears filled them. His throat tightened, and he sobbed lightly. He was in denial. This had to be a nightmare.
"Right, sorry. I was only going to call her a-"
If he were allowed, he would gaze into Draco's startlingly sterling eyes until he was utterly and hopelessly lost in them forever.
Were they doing
He ran through the double doors, past Ron, who stared at him with a confounded expression when he saw the familiar Slytherin lying unconscious in his friend's arms.
"Well, I was almost sorted into Slytherin. But I asked for Gryffindor."
Harry smiled broadly. He flipped the note over only to discover another juvenile doodle on the backside. This one poorly depicted Harry riding his broomstick into the Whomping Willow, which had been given an evil, laughing face. Harry was a caped stick figure, and the only thing that distinguished him was the huge round glasses and, of course, the lightning scar, which was made out to be much bigger than it really was.
They could be friends now.
The ear-piercing sound of a door swinging open on rusty hinges broke Harry's concentration, and he anxiously scrambled to his feet, batting the dust off of his Quidditch robes.
"Because I have a trust-worthy face?"
He froze solid, every muscle in his body seizing, but he stiffly forced himself to face him nonetheless. He eyed up the ginger with his most pretentious smile.
"He's talking to McGonagall," Hermione surmised, observing the man intently. "Whatever their discussing seems to have aggravated her. She looks worried, doesn't she?"
"Yes, I'm bloody sure!" Draco replied a little too hastily.
what I imagined." he playfully scowled. "There's more of you lot than I suspected."
"I feared as much," Dumbledore moved to the end of the bed and looked down at the tiny figure tucked into it. "His parents will be coming soon to try and collect him. We are not to let them take him home at all costs.  We both know what caused this, and the situation will only get worse if he returns home. If it happens again, he most definitely will not make it."
"I'm lucky," Draco admitted quietly, breaking the silence with a soft chuckle. "Some people have spent decades in love with someone they couldn't have. I thought maybe I would be one of those people, but . . . he loves me back. I was lucky. I am lucky."
Lucius Malfoy's narrowed eyes were trained upon the nameless red wax seal. So, the boy wished to remain anonymous, did he? The wicked man smirked slightly, reading the delicately composed inscription on the back of the brittle paper with a curious twitch of his eyebrow.
"I know. I know, but it will be okay." He gripped the ruff of Draco's robes and drew him closer, giving him a comforting kiss before sliding his hands down Draco's arms and letting him go. "Let's hurry."
Harry's stomach lurched, and he felt his heart begin to beat rapidly inside his chest. He couldn't run now.
The glass of freshly poured white wine slipped from Lucius' delicate grasp, and his jaws dropped as a rather womanly gasp escaped his throat.
Draco's muffled voice broke the silence. "I'm sorry I scared you,"
"C'mon, Draco, eat,"
Hermione chimed in. "The eggs are good."
"I don't envy you, Harry," Ron stated as he sat down and began to pile his plate with food. He took a bite of sausage and laughed. "Mr. Flitwick alone gave us enough work to keep us busy 'til Christmas, so you should have a jolly old time."
Sitting out in the corridor, outside the infirmary, Harry fidgeted with his wand and stared blankly at the lamp-lit wall. He watched with tired, listless eyes, hypnotized as the shadows danced, the flame in the firepot crackling softly as it flickered in the dark like a bright, burning beacon of hope.
The Divination classroom was wonderfully cool, a drastic but very welcome change for Harry after being cooped up in Snape's stuffy dungeon classroom for over an hour with 30 steaming cauldrons bubbling away in the oppressive heat. Here, the windows were open, the long, velvety curtains fluttering softly in the gentle breeze as the rain fell silently from the pale, grey sky.
, my son, have no say in the matter."
"Malfoy?"A timid voice broke the eerie silence.
Draco Malfoy and Harry were standing in the middle of the Quidditch pitch later that beautiful Saturday afternoon. The sky was big and blue with a few scattered clouds, and the sun was shining down through the stands onto the fading, Autumn grass. It was the perfect day for flying.
At that moment,  Draco lifted his head,  looking a bit unsettled. His eyes scanned the room uneasily,  but then they met Harry's gaze.  Harry's stomach clenched, and although he knew that he should look away,  he couldn't.  He held Draco's poignant gaze unflinchingly, feeling his breath come uneasy.  Wings.  His stomach felt like it was filled with wings. He swore Draco's face flushed as he turned away,  but Harry couldn't know for sure.  Then Draco looked up again,  and Harry knew.  There was something in the air between them,  but he couldn't put a finger on it.
"Malfoy," he gasped, quickly running down the slippery steps. He shoved an open-mouthed Seamus Finnigan out of his way and then crouched in the mud at Draco's side, his eyebrows furrowed.
"Then get going,"
"It is. It really is." Draco agreed, beaming, his mercury blue eyes twinkling in the sunlight. "Harry?"
"What?"
Hermione shot Draco a frosty glare, gritting her teeth. "You're not helping."
"It'll be okay. I promise." Harry continued. "You won't be expelled, alright? Dumbledore wouldn't let that happen."
He gave Ron another questioning look, and the red-head jerked his head pointedly towards the little crystal ball sitting on Harry's bedside table. Draco looked confused for a moment, but then something dawned on him. He stared at the crystal for a moment before pulling Harry closer and kissing him gently on the top of his head.
"I'm dead," He muttered.
Dumbledore ignored his question and stared down at him blankly. "Walk with me, Harry,"
Narrowing his eyes, Harry leaned forward on the table and stared into the ball, clenching his fists and digging his nails deeply into his palms. Maybe it wouldn't be something terrible. Maybe. . . perhaps it would all be okay.
After taking a moment to collect his thoughts, he stood and straightened his shoulders, forcing a look of haughty indifference before grabbing his book-bag and walking gracefully out of the room.
"Well, don't take it out on me!"
"Then get going."
Harry felt a wave of guilt wash over him. Lately, his friendship with Ron had been delicate. If he told him the truth about his relationship with Malfoy, things between them could become even more unstable. On the other hand, he knew that the longer he delayed, the higher the likelihood of the truth completely destroying their friendship. He didn't know what to do.
Positioned stiffly on his stool, elbows on the table, Harry stared blankly at his open Potions book, mind wandering distractedly over the well-worn pages. His eyes flickered across the classroom to Draco's empty seat. The Slytherin was absent again. Harry wondered what his marks were for the class, and he sighed dismally, causing Hermione to glance up at him briefly over her own book.
"So?"
Draco nodded weakly, too terrified to articulate his scattered thoughts into words.
"'Morning," Fred and George greeted him in harmony, sounding strangely solemn.
Harry froze, his entire body suddenly cold. All the little hairs on his arms and the back of his neck stood up on end, and his heart stopped. "Dementors? But. . . How? I thought Draco was just sick. I mean, he looked better, and then he just. . .  collapsed. . . ."
"Harry, what if other people see?"
A strange mix of emotions that Ron couldn't read flashed across the Slytherin's face as he fidgeted with the lid on a jar of Armadillo Bile, his lips twitching, eyes flickering as if he were wrestling with the words he needed to say next. He settled for, "Shove off, Weasley! It's none of your bloody business anyway, is it?"
Harry nodded and reached up to rub his eyes before he dragged himself up and clumsily got dressed. He fidgeted with the button of his jeans and then staggered behind Ron to the Great Hall.
Lucius pointed a long, accusatory finger at his only son. "You will regret those words, boy," he spat angrily.
"Quite the dramatic, aren't you?" Harry chuckled.
They waited breathlessly for a moment, expecting a flash of light or a repellent spell.
Madame Pomfrey was hovering over a cot, wiping a patient's forehead with a damp cloth. She looked up at the Professor for a moment to give him a sad, skeptical look. "There has been no change in his condition as of yet," she sighed. "He hasn't so much as stirred even a little. Sir, I'm worried that he'll never wake up."
The castle loomed overhead, so close and yet so far. Rain clouded Draco's vision, running down his face and soaking through his clothes to his clammy skin.
Draco grinned and shook his head at himself. "Blimey, I should have been more careful. Out of everyone, you were the last person I wanted to catch on, besides Harry, of course."
"Isn't
"Look, mate," he began in a quiet, raspy voice. "I get it. Yes, you were a complete git, but you had your reasons. I mean, I would have acted the same if I had been in your situation. I know I would have. I thought about it a lot, and this thing between you and Harry will always be a bit  . . . weird for me, but, honestly, I'm glad for it." He hugged his knees to his chest and rested his head against the wall as he stared out the window into the starry night sky. He laughed. "I never took Harry for a fairy, although I will admit, I wondered about you a few times. Caught you starin' once or twice, and had a right laugh about it, so thanks for that. 'Mione thought I was mental. She still owes me an apology."
Harry looked hesitant as he glanced sheepishly at his friends.
They reached the top of the stairs, and the mismatched triad began to follow the assemblage down a narrow, twisting corridor. As Harry and Hermione continued their intense debate, Draco felt his stomach drop sickeningly. Something wasn't right.
Draco sat alone in the bleachers, grinning as he watched Harry land his broom, only to be swept up off his feet by a swarm of his classmates. As the scene unfolded before him, he couldn't help but feel a slight pang of nostalgia. He remembered observing a moment nearly indistinguishable all but four years ago, with a younger Harry at the center, the starring player.
"Ah, right! Brilliant!" Harry thrust his hand into his pocket and rummaged for a second before pulling out a very crumpled piece of paper. His hands shaking with excitement, he smoothed out the small piece of parchment and practically forced it into Hermione's hands. "There! Read it for yourself!"
"What?"
"Good,"
"The old codger didn't charm me after all!"
"Is there somewhere you need to be?" Professor Snape asked coldly, staring the young Slytherin down. "Am I imposing?"
"Yes, sir."
Draco felt his facial muscles constrict. "And I see I your mother's been feeding you too much,"
"Damn it, Harry!" He swore. He glared at the embarrassed Gryffindor with his icy eyes and huffed. "You're an impossible, git."
"Oh," Ron suddenly regretted pulling away, because now Harry was curled up in a ball, hugging his knees to his chest. He looked like a terrified little boy again.
Harry's eyes widened as he stared into the crystal. That was . . . Draco's jumper. It was unmistakable.
Hermione stared at the man in confusion. "What's he doing here?"
"Ah, Draco," Lucius' voice echoed in the empty room, "I meant to ask. Was that your owl I saw flying when I came home?"
He denied it.
Maybe, Draco thought wryly; maybe it would have been for the best.
"Checking up on our new roommate, of course," George announced gleefully.
Harry readjusted his glasses and looked at the two Weasley twins suspiciously. "Hey," he said warily, "What're you two doing here?"
"I just . . . I thought I heard something."
"No, no, it's fine. I'm just. . . not used to talking about it." Draco swallowed hard and forced himself to look Ron in the eye. He had hated the Weasley boy for so long, and yet here he was, having a casual heart-to-heart with him. Who would have thought? Draco licked his lips and sighed. "I wasn't really studying for Charms before. I skipped dinner to see Snape. I told him about the mark, and he gave me a sort of potion I'm going to have to take, but it will help with the pain, so thank Salazar for that, I guess. It will never fully go away, but it's something."
Harry pulled at his hair and then looked up dismally, trying to ignore the open-mouthed stares he was receiving from everyone nearby. Ron's eyebrows were knitted so tightly together; it looked as if he had a long red caterpillar snaking its way across his forehead. Hermione was trying her hardest not to laugh out loud.
"So tell me exactly how long this has been going on between you and Mr. Potter, and how this. . . thing. . . began. "
Ron shook his head and groaned. "Damn! The luck of that bloke."
"Harry," Draco breathed, weakly reaching out for him, just barely brushing the ends of Harry's robe with his fingertips.
"He's got a point," Harry agreed.
Ron opened his mouth to speak but quickly clamped it shut, hurt mingled with confusion and frustration contorting his face. He wordlessly returned to his unfinished plate.
Ron snorted at him and shook his head. "Switching partners isn't going to help, Malfoy. Blimey, what you
Students stopped cheering him on, and Ron quickly coiled back from Draco with a suddenly panicked expression. Draco looked back at him, his eyes half-open as he waited for the next punch. But it didn't come. His grip loosened on Draco's robes. . .
"DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL?"
Harry looked up at Draco for help, but he simply grinned deviously. "Show them the thing, the note."
"Harry? What do you see?" He fidgeted with the fringe of his quilt and allowed his gaze to shift warily back to Harry's now tear-streaked face. "I mean, it goes several years into the future, right? What . . ." his tongue darted across his lips nervously. "What happens?"
"I have got to give it to her," Pansy shrugged as she slung her bag over her shoulder and straightened her mused robes. "that old witch knows her magic."
Solidified. Frozen solid. Unmoving. Only Draco's eyes moved, slowly shifting to the boy who had just spoken as he emerged from the massive swarm of students accumulating around them between compartments. Emerald green collided with silver, and Draco felt his soul crumble at the sight of him, the pain making his heart snap in two like a twig underfoot.
"Mmhm." Ron hummed sarcastically. He narrowed his eyes and stared even more intently into the foggy crystal glass. "Oh, Professor, I think I see something!"
"Luna?" Harry teased, grinning. "Was it Loony Lovegood? I have to admit, you two would make a
Draco smiled triumphantly and then looked down at his plate, which had filled itself. "Oh, Salazar. . . What in the bloody hell is that?" he asked, gesturing towards an odd, wet, brownish lump in the center of his plate. "That is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my life."
Bubo clacked in objection, and Draco groaned.
you," Draco teased, narrowing his eyes down at Potter.
"You psyched to lose the game tonight?" Harry asked Draco with a teasing grin, quietly admiring how the light caught in the Slytherin's stormy gray eyes. He rested his elbow on the table and propped his chin up in his hand. "I'm going to wipe the drool off your friends' faces with the business end of my broom."
Draco started, quickly tugging down his sleeve as he cast an alarmed, wide-eyed glance over his shoulder.
"Draco, kindly explain to me what I just witnessed. Will you?"
With that, Draco watched as The Chosen One turned sharply on his heel and walked calmly up the stone steps. Ron and Hermione quickly joined their friend at his side, asking him what the hell was wrong with him and why he was so worried about Draco Malfoy of all people. The Slytherin could hear their patronizing voices, and he snarled in disgust and anger. He hated them. He hated them with everything he had.
Draco awoke with a start, his grey eyes snapping open as he gazed blankly into the enclosing darkness.
"Potter, Potter, Potter," he half-screamed, "The Boy-Who-Lived, the Chosen One, Professor Dumbledore's favorite. Famous, aren't we? You think everybody loves you. You can't help yourself! You're full of it, Potter, you're full of it!"
The two boys sat in silence for a few minutes. Ron stared out the window at the moon as it rose over the trees' dark, skeletal figures. Draco simply focused on Harry, listening to the sound of his steady breathing in the quiet room, watching his eyelids flutter, and his eyebrows twitch. He smoothed Harry's hair and hummed softly to himself, startling Ron from his reverie.
Professor Trelawney, a beaming smile plastered on her face, flicked her wand, and more than a dozen glittering stones flew from her desk and began to fly wildly around the room.
Bubo nipped Draco thankfully on the finger and then took off, soaring upwards into the rafters and disappearing into the blue sky.
This was going to be brilliant.
Hermione's voice softened, and she sounded - sorry. "I pity him."
"What's going on?" Ron asked slowly, scanning his friends' faces.
Somehow, Draco still looked beautiful. Harry thought. He wiped his eyes on the sleeve of his robe and then leaned in. He pinched his eyes shut, teardrops falling like rain as Harry tenderly kissed Draco's lips. It hurt. It hurt. They were cold and dead and lifeless, and it hurt. This was not how he had imagined it. He would never have imagined this.
The soft, pale skin was spotless and unblemished, except for the large, unsightly black mark branded on his inner forearm—the telling sign of a Death Eater. The knot in his stomach tightened sickeningly, and he grimaced, watching as the mark twisted and slithered. . . burning. Draco's face twisted with pain.
"Um, alright. I feel fucking disgusting. I feel like shit. Is that better?"
"Leave me the fuck alone, Ron," Harry snapped, glaring back at his friend. "I followed him here because whatever it was he got in the mail really piqued my interest. He was as white as a ghost when he read it. . ."
"Is it just me, or does the atmosphere feel a little tense?" Luna Lovegood asked softly from beside Hermione, looking innocently from face to face. "It must be the nargles."
Harry stormed off, Fred and George following close behind, bellowing the muggle song as loudly as they could. Hermione turned to look at Ron, who was drinking his pumpkin juice and staring blankly into space.
"You're robbing me blind!"
"Then who?!"
"I see myself, and someone else. . ."
Draco felt his face crumple as the tears now flowed freely. "N-no, sir, I d-do not take you for a f-fool. "
to follow him.
Harry looked up at him over his book, his lips perking up again. "Hey," he whispered breathlessly.
"You alright?" he asked in a voice barely above a whisper, leaning in close to Draco.
"Hide? Hide from who?" He queried, raindrops glistening on his long, black lashes.
Harry smiled broadly. Again checking to make sure no one was watching, He flicked the paper and then watched as the unicorn leaped off of the table and galloped silently across the room towards Draco. Feeling a bit nervous, he returned to his book, now staring at where the page had been. . . He chanced a peek and felt a smile tug at his lips again. Draco met his gaze and tentatively smiled back at him over the paper, his cheeks tinged a rose pink.
"Mean what?"
The sheets were coarse against Draco's sensitive skin as he stirred, his ice-blue eyes fluttering open. He squinted into the dazzling morning light, momentarily blinded by the sun as it streamed in through the towering windows of the infirmary. He couldn't help but wonder where he was. What had happened? Wasn't he supposed to be in the Great Hall? He frowned in confusion, searching the vaulted stone ceiling for answers.
"Oh, dear," Hermione whispered to Harry over her cauldron, as Draco hastily made his way to his seat. "He looks even worse than usual. I do hope he's been following up with Madame Pomfrey."
"Harry, there's nothing you can do,"
"Yes, Professor."
"Moment I met him."
Harry jumped up and stared at Draco in shock. "Draco?!" he cried.
"Mr. Malfoy has told me to watch you closely," Snape's gaze was burning a hole right through Draco.
Harry leaped up and stepped back, trembling as he watched Madame Pomfrey lean over Draco and pull out her wand. It transformed into a sort of stick-like stethoscope, and she placed one end over Draco's chest while she placed the other to her ear.
Harry ran up the steps through the rain, elbowing his way through the gaping throng with a rather panicked look on his face.
sound, making several heads turn.
The entrance to the office seemed overly large and imposing now. It wasn't very comforting. The thought of seeing his father, knowing that the man knew his most consequential secret was daunting, and he had hoped that this moment would never come.
In the purple, early morning light, Harry sat knees to his chest in the Gryffindor tower window, a pile of opened notes and pieces of paper lay scattered on the floor beside him. He was tapping his wand impatiently against his knee, staring out the open window into the sky as if he were waiting expectantly for something.
"I mean, I don't see it. I can't pinpoint when it happens, but I think it happens sometime soon. I'm scared, Ron. What am I supposed to do? I can't stop it if I don't know anything. I need to stop it! I can't go through that. I can't live without him. How could I? I just love him so much. He means everything to me. If he dies, I'll . . . I'll . . . ," he cut himself off, biting his lip, his thick eyebrows furrowing in distress. His voice broke, and he finally looked up at Ron again, his expression perfectly mirroring the brokenness he felt inside. "If he dies," he cried, his voice ever so small. "I'll die."
Finally, after what felt like an extremely uncomfortable eternity for Ronald, a slender, blonde-headed figure walked into the room his head bowed as he focused on the book he was holding open in his hand. He was eating an apple as he walked, his eyebrows furrowed slightly as he read.
In the back of Draco's mind, he was aware of the brush of fabric over his skin, and he heard a distant voice, but he ignored it.
Draco threw his leg over the broom and first held onto the back of Harry's jacket. Then, with some hesitation, he slowly snaked his arms around him instead, holding on tight.
Draco nodded slightly. "Yes," he twirled a lock of Harry's jet-black hair between his fingers. "That, and because I had to." A sudden sadness filled his eyes, his lips tightening with unspoken regret. "I'm sorry," he whispered.
Still smiling, Harry gathered up his pile of notes, hid them in one of his suitcases, and stashed it back under his bed. Feeling wonderfully content and blissfully happy, he finally laid down in his bed. He took off his glasses and set them on his bedside table, and then he curled up with his pillow and closed his eyes.
Harry was beaming through his tears. It was magic. All of it was magic.
"Right. Sorry,"
In which Draco pines over Harry.
"We're stopped?" He grunted, his back aching as he forced himself to sit upon the leather-bound seat. "Why're we stopped?"
"You're running your creepy little hands all over my best mate, so yes, I'd say it is," Ron retorted, narrowing his eyes. "I'm not judging you, Malfoy. I never thought I'd say this to you of all bloody people, but I just want to help, alright'?"
"We'll keep an eye on him, okay?" Ron offered weakly. "We'll keep an eye on 'im and never let him out of our sight. If your busy, I'll stand by him, okay? Keep the bloke outta trouble, so to speak.
"It's alright," Draco drawled, yawning. "I deserved it. Although one more, and ya could have killed me. I was a bit delicate."
His presence was intoxicating. His touch felt enchanting, almost electric. Draco fought the urge to vomit at the sensation; his stomach caught up in knots at Harry's proximity.
"Boys!" Hermione sputtered, laughing, "You boys are utterly ridiculous."
His fingers trembled a little as he unfolded it, the paper brittle in his fingers, worn from the wind. What was it? Was it from his mother? Father? Was someone hurt? Draco's tongue flicked nervously across his dry lips as his mercury grey eyes finally settled on the tear-stained ink. It was short and abrupt but clear as day.
"Salazar, what the hell was that?"
the Gryffindor tie. But if it meant spending more time with Harry, he could make amends with it. Raking his eyes over his body in the mirror, Draco adjusted his sleeves and loosened his button-down collar before finally meeting his own gaze. The knot in his stomach clenched, and he frowned dismally at his reflection.
"He's not brave.  He's an arrogant child who thinks himself better than his elders." Snape said stiffly.  "But do go on.   This might be entertaining."
Harry chuckled. He loved the doodles. Draco was definitely much more infantile than he had thought. Harry could tell from the loopy, nearly lop-sided scribbling that Draco was on the verge of falling asleep. Harry would let him.
It hurt to walk. He could feel the dwindling muscles in his calves and lower thighs burning as he walked. It took all of his strength just to put one foot in front of the other. He would have to remember to start using his walking stick, he thought, grimacing in pain. Still, following Harry's retreating figure, he limped through the Great Hall. He didn't know what he was expecting, but at the moment, it felt like something was pulling him toward Harry - he
"Are you alright,  Harry? "
A sudden gust of chilly October air made Draco shiver, and he hugged himself tightly, rubbing his arms for warmth. He glanced up at the sky, feeling deeply unsettled by the dark, overcast sky. He felt a coldness creeping up his spine and through his bones, and he fought the urge to panic, distant but vivid memories of dark-robed creatures clouding his mind.
Harry walked closely at his side, shoulders ever so delicately brushing. Each time, he felt like he might suffer an aneurysm. Suddenly, in one wonderful moment, calloused fingers brushed against his, and in that instant, he felt as if he were living a dream. Pulse racing, he closed his eyes and licked his lips as he gently brushed back, nudging him slightly with his knuckles, taking a chance.
"I need to hide from them, I need to hide," he mumbled to himself agitatedly through painfully gritted teeth, his eyes welling with tears. He stepped off the platform and onto the grass as the rain began to fall.
Harry had something to say that he would have liked to say out loud, but he held his tongue instead, blushing down into his lap.
Fred and George shared a mischievous smile and then immediately began to sing.
"You alright, mate?" Ron asked, slowly scanning Harry's face with a concerned expression.
The Headmaster took a step closer to the bed and looked down into the boy's sunken face. "When Narcissa and Lucius arrive, I will be here. We must keep Draco safe. Now, if you'll excuse me. . ." Dumbledore turned, his long, garish gown swishing behind him as he walked out of the infirmary leaving Madame Pomfrey looking completely baffled.
Ron licked his lips and shifted uncomfortably.
"Ron, stop! One of the prefects is coming!" Hermione pleaded.
"Bloody hell! Fine. . ."
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets and shrugged. "Um, okay."
Draco's face brightened.
Harry smiled softly, a faint blush creeping onto his cheeks. "Okay," he breathed. "You ready?"
As Hermione tried defining compassion to Ron in persuasive tones, Harry found himself glancing over his shoulder. Students scurried around them through the doors, trying to get out of the rain and into the castle. Harry ignored them, standing there blankly staring down the steps at the hooded figure bent over the railing below.
, what was his father going to do? He couldn't help but worry.
Harry carries Draco to the hospital wing, much to Ron's dismay. Malfoy's mysterious condition piques Harry's curiosity.
That little twinkle that Harry adored so much only proved to him that he had loved Draco for much longer than he had previously thought. Every time the prat smirked, Harry felt as though his heart were swelling twice the size in his chest. It was a feeling he didn't quite grasp or fully understand, and sometimes it terrified him, but all it took was a glance or a word, and he forgot that he was afraid.
Harry stopped abruptly, and Draco stiffened.
Draco felt his breath catch in his throat, and he coughed abruptly. Did Harry just wink at him? What in the bloody hell was that supposed to mean? He couldn't decide whether Harry was joking about poisoning him or slipping him some other bizarre tonic. Blushing furiously, Draco buried his face in his book and ignored Pansy's concerned questions. Still, he smiled. Were they actually officially on speaking terms? Were they friends now? He couldn't say. He could only silently hope. Being friends and loving him was better than being enemies and loving him, though it would make other things harder. Draco glanced up to see Professor Snape glancing shiftily between him and Potter, and he blushed all the more, quickly bowing his head and pretending to read.
Draco darted out the door and walked hurriedly down the hall, clutching his bag to his chest, the tears suddenly pouring down his face. All he could think about was what a fucking idiot he was. He let his guard down around Harry, and now he had drawn unwanted attention to himself. Could he have been any more obvious?
"You look so much better today, Draco," Pansy Parkinson piped up amidst the room full of babbling students, interrupting Draco's scattered and confusing train of thoughts. Her big round eyes were studying him strangely. "Did Madame Pomphrey give you some new treatment or something?"
Harry lifted his head and held the pitcher to his lips, careful not to tip it too much. Draco drank greedily, his hands trembling where he gripped harry's hands on the pitcher.
But then again,  he was sure.  Harry's head was starting to throb.  This was all too much.  He just wanted it to stop.  He'd rather duel Voldemort right here and now rather than admit out loud what he was thinking.  He was determined not to admit it.
"Draco, what's wrong?"
Draco gasped and grinned broadly. "Oh, I feel special!" he teased.
Draco boards the Hogwarts Express and tries to avoid Harry and his friends, but fails, ending in confrontation.
Harry looked to him, hopefully for approval. Ron rolled his eyes and said drearily, "Why not?"
Several frustrated groans and muttered complaints broke Harry out of his trance and drew his attention to the familiar, crystal orb perched in the center of his table. He sighed as he dismally watched the colors shift and swirl beneath the smooth, glass-like surface, first changing from a hazy pink to a cloudy blue.
"I can't . . . sit there. He has to come to me. Last time, I was sent flying across the room. Dumbledore set a perimeter spell, you see."
The boys quickly broke apart, and Draco wiped the moisture from his lips and instead held onto the back of Harry's jacket.
"Sorry," Draco mouthed, grimacing.
"Who cares," Draco grinned and pulled Harry closer, his heart stuttering as the color in Harry's cheeks deepened even further. Loving the embarrassment in Harry's face, he leaned in to kiss him. Fred and George snickered and began to hum loudly.
"Sorry,"
"Shh, shh," Draco hushed, softly stroking the back of Harry's head. "It's alright. I have you now."
"What?" Harry choked abruptly. "I'm not. I'm just. . . curious, I guess."
"What the bloody hell's wrong with the bloke?" Ron asked in horror, his mouth agape, his damp hair clinging to his forehead.
Draco groaned. "He's such a pansy."
"Yes, Professor Snape?" Harry said a little too cheerfully.
Harry grinned as he climbed onto his broom, shaking his head. "Calm down, Malfoy. It's alright. There's no one here except Ron and Hermione, and Ron is a completely clueless bugger, so we'll be perfectly fine."
Harry glowed. "Okay! Cool!" he twisted around to look at Draco. "Malfoy, you sorry git, over here!"
roughly dragging the sleeve of his romper across his mouth. "Well, now you have." He pushed back his plate. "I need all the energy I can get."
Draco sat up and took the cup into his trembling hands. When he tasted it, it was warm and sweet, with a hint of honey and berries. It was nothing like the tea he was accustomed to drinking at home, and for a moment, he felt a smile tugging at his pale lips. It made him feel. . . happy.
And then, he retched, the sounds making the others grimace.
Crabbe and Goyle paused fighting over each other's breakfast sausages and looked up expectantly at the enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall. Owls were swooping down from the great blue dome, the sunlight streaming through their outstretched feathers.
There was a brief awkward silence in which Draco licked his lips nervously and shifted his book-bag on his shoulder, glancing longingly at the door while looking a bit pale.
"Look,  I know I've been acting strange lately, "
Harry silently waited for an answer and was thrilled when he felt something fall into his lap. It was a paper bird. He beamed as he unfolded it.
"Yes, Professor."
Butterflies filled Harry's stomach, wings fluttering, making him feel sick in a strange yet wonderful way. Malfoy's lips were soft and warm and tasted distinctly of treacle tart pudding. He could felt his body melting, his heart pounding, skipping beats as it thrummed loudly in his ears. He wanted to capture the moment, live in it, savor it.
This Ron particularly enjoyed. The Malfoy could handle being called a "faggot," or a "queer" or a "little freak," but if anyone said anything about Harry, he lashed out like a snake, deadly and fierce.
"Damn it, Neville, move!" he yelled, pushing the clumsy boy rather roughly aside with his shoulder.
"Of course she does, that nosy little-"
"W-what?! No!" Harry sputtered, horrified.
"We very well can, and we will. That boy will marry Miss Trix as intended, or the heirdom will be stripped from him. I will not let our fortune to pass on to some filthy man-slut!" Lucius turned to face his wife, fuming. "He might be our son, but he has disgraced us! No one can know about this, or we will be ruined."
The portrait of his father that hung above the mantle scowled down at him, slowly sipping a glass of velvety red wine and tapping his long bony fingers against the crystal glass painted in his hand. He looked as if he might speak, but he reserved his sharp words of displeasure. All Lucius could do was grumble and fuss, his pale face growing increasingly red with every passing minute. How could his son's lacking school-boy bewitcheries and protection spells be so efficient?
Suddenly, another jolt of pain made his skull feel as if it were cleft in two. He gasped in pain and bent over the railing, his stomach-churning. He felt cold, hollow, and weak, and he felt his brain slowly splitting. What the hell was wrong with him? Was it the stress? Was it his body's lack of nutrition?
Being this close to Harry every day was going to be intoxicating. He wasn't sure if he would be able to control himself. But he grudgingly supposed that he would have to; otherwise, Ron's bulbous head really
Draco tuned him out, squinting into the sunlight as he stared upwards at the familiar owl soaring towards him, dark feathers disheveled from a long, urgent flight.
Hermione piped up quietly, her voice quivering a little. "I don't think this is a good idea, Ronald. I really don't LIKE THIS-" And she broke her sentence off with a scream as they took off and streaked across the sky towards the castle.
"Scratch that, I don't think we've ever seen him finish his plate," Ron added briefly, slowly chewing on a buttered dinner roll.
"Harry?"
Frowning slightly as he wondered what punishment Snape was silently planning for him, he unfolded Draco's response.
"Oh,"
Ronald Weasley watched as Draco tucked his arm back into his sling, a troubled expression on his face as their eyes clashed.
Draco fearfully opened his mouth to speak, hiccuping slightly between breaths.
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his sleep, and Harry jumped a little. He let out a sigh of relief before hesitantly tucking his robes more securely around Draco's motionless body.
It was horribly bright. Harry felt blinded the moment he walked into the cavernous room. His eyes burned, and he blinked back tears from the pain as he sat down across from Hermione at the Gryffindor table. The room was nearly empty. Only a few students were scattered at a few tables. Everyone must have been sleeping in.
He turned to walk away, but Harry grabbed his arm. Draco quickly yanked his arm from his grasp as if he had been stung, and Harry looked up at him in wounded confusion.
Draco begins feeling violently ill, and he injures himself very badly. Harry heroically swoops into the rescue.
The words sounded strange and foreign even to himself, like little white lies. He couldn't believe them no matter how hard he tried. Nothing was going to be alright. Harry had always been Voldemort's sole focus, but now, Draco had thrown himself into the line of fire, and things would soon get much worse. The boy had already been through so much, how could Harry ask anything more of him?
Draco stiffened at the sound of the Death Eater's raised voice, his tears now pooling down his cheeks. He didn't answer. He couldn't answer. What was he supposed to say? What could he say? If Snape knew like he seemed to, he was as good as dead. Draco roughly dried his cheeks with the sleeves of his robes, leaving them red and burning.
They were dry and rough and chapped from the wind, but they were Harry's, and Draco felt as if his heart were soaring above the clouds. This was the first time he'd kissed Harry since that night in the infirmary, and it was everything he'd ever wanted. If he could imagine what perfect was like, this was it. This was most definitely it.
"He's brave, " he began softly, his face burning with shame through his hot tears. "He's the opposite of me.  I'm a coward." He laughed softly to himself. "
"What's that?" He asked, pulling back to pat Draco's chest.
Ron sighed hugely and shut his eyes as if he were making a birthday wish. "Oh,  alright.  Fine,  but you have to start paying less attention to  ferret.  Okay? "
"Harry! There you are," he called.
Taking a deep breath, Draco leaped at the opportunity and shouldered his book-bag, and began to saunter across the aisle towards him slowly, his stomach tangled in knots. He felt wonderfully and horribly sick all at once.
Ron stared at his friend in shock, his eyes wide and his mouth gaping. "Harry . . ."
However, one particular afternoon in Potions, Ron wondered differently. Maybe he wasn't proud. Maybe, the feeling he really felt was shame.
Draco raised his head with a sudden surge of power, his lip curling upwards into a repugnant sneer. Harry emerged from behind him and took his place by his side, squaring his jaw, his eyes now a stormy shade of green.
"Oh. . . Nothing."
"There, there, not too much. That's it," Harry chuckled, "Slowly."
"I can't do this," he said flatly. "Not with them staring at us singing that stupid song!"
George ran his fingers through his messy red hair, "It didn't sound like you slept very well last night. That's all." he stated matter-of-factly.
Ron was on him in seconds, grabbing Malfoy by the back of his robes, Hermione struggling to hold the angry ginger back as he rammed a large, meaty first into Draco's pointed face. Draco felt his lip bust and his nose crack sickeningly as Weasley's knuckles collided with his skin, blood pooling.
"Hey, isn't that the family owl?" Pansy asked timidly, pointing.
"Let's leave it at that, then. You get it."
"And I'm sorry for slugging you," Ron said sheepishly, "On the train."
"Ouch!" He hissed, glaring angrily at the owl. "You are definitely spiteful. Makes sense." He glanced nervously around the room.
Suddenly, everything was still, except for the animated chatter of the ogling students, and for a second, Harry's hateful sneer transformed into a confused, half-concerned stare. Ron's bewildered gaze kept shifting between the two boys, and Hermione looked as if she might have been holding her breath. Draco swallowed, but his mouth was dry. He could feel the tears in his eyes threatening to drop, and he clenched his jaw with a weak resolution. He wouldn't break in front of him. He wouldn't give in.
"Hardly!" Draco licked his lips and finally tasted. He wrinkled his nose and pushed his plate as far away from him as possible. "I think that's what they feed the prisoners in Azkaban," he said thickly.
Draco blushed harder. It felt as if Harry had finally noticed him. The barrier between them had finally fallen, and Draco felt happier and freer than he had in a long time.
Draco looked up, scowling. Blaise was innocently taking another sip of his pumpkin juice, pretending to suddenly take an interest in Pansy's rant about ineffective healing potions. Draco scoffed. Snarling, he looked down at his plate again, drowning out the thundering voices of the children as he poked at his toast with his fork, tossing it around on his now egg-soaked plate.
"Alright then."
He hoped that he hadn't.
Harry grinned devilishly back. "Where to?"
Draco's eyes widened, but this time, not in fear, but rather in anger.
Harry blinked and looked up at the portrait of the fat lady.,  his train of thought lost.
"Born ready, Potter."
"Don't be nasty," Zabini joined in, his deep voice sounding threatening. "She treated you very well. You should remember that next time you go off spouting about 'er."
The hairs on Draco's neck stood up on end, and his skin tingled. Draco had noticed his empty seat at the Gryffindor table and had mentally thanked the stars for his absence. He'd been hoping to delay a public encounter, but as luck would have it, Harry would purposefully instigate one. Who wouldn't enjoy seeing their enemy squirm with humiliation? Harry Potter certainly wouldn't miss out on that opportunity.
"I'm gay, " he groaned into his pillow. Suddenly, he sat up with a start, his green eyes wide with shock.  "Shit! I'm gay. . . "
you were thinking."
Professor Snape stood behind his desk, and Draco watched him with fear as he leaned over the desk towards him, face hard like stone.
For a moment,  it looked as if Snape almost pitied him,  but that moment ended quickly.
"Potter," he said cheerfully, and he grimaced. It sounded strange rolling off of his tongue without a sneer.
That evening in the Great Hall, Harry relayed the information Dumbledore had given him to Ron and Hermione, leaving out the extent of their conversation, of course. Afterward, they both looked just as confused as he had.
"Malfoy, can you hear me?" he shook the boy's arm madly, but he didn't respond. He lay there motionless, his head resting in a mud puddle, his white-blonde hair matted to his feverish forehead. "He's out cold," He told Hermione as she knelt beside him.
"Draco?" Harry breathed, stroking his cold, wet cheek. "Draco, can you hear me?"
"Go away,"
Ron hesitantly stood and approached his friend, sitting down on the bed beside him. He drew his legs up off of the floor and folded them underneath him as he watched his friend come undone, covering his face with his hands and beginning to sob.
Harry looked up from his plate to glare at her. She talked to him like he was a little child, and it was beginning to wear him thin.
Ron stared at Harry in complete and utter bewilderment. "You won't believe who I married!"
Draco shook his head and rushed from the door, stumbling a little over his own feet. His vision was fuzzy, and it swayed from side to side as if he were standing on a yacht. He felt sick. He couldn't believe that the year had already gone so horribly wrong! How had things gone from bad to worse within a matter of hours? Salazar, his father, had to have jinxed him! There was no other explanation for his poor luck. Draco ran out of breath, ungracefully losing speed as he came to a halt in the castle's long stone corridor. He leaned forward, supporting his arms on his knees, gasping for air as he stared wide-eyed at the floor. How in the hell had this happened? Indebted to Harry Potter, who had allegedly saved his life. Why. . . why had he done it? With all of the hatred and contempt that the Chosen One harbored for the Slytherin, why would he bother saving his life?
"Better?" The Gryffindor asked softly, rubbing circles on Draco's back.
Ron blinked repeatedly, the confusion finally dissipating. "Well," he said, "This explains a lot."
There was a rumble of thunder overhead, and Draco shivered again, grudgingly taking the seat beside Cho Chang, who was sitting uncomfortably close to Harry. She scooted away from Draco and closer to Harry, looking awkwardly at the Slytherin with her dark eyes.
He thought, trembling.
Discomfitted,  Harry pushed his plate away and left the Great Hall searching for his friends,  leaving Draco in shattered confusion.
Harry frowned. Ron's face had blanched a little.
"Not now, Hermione."
"I think I might be. . . y'know . . . going through something similar," Ron admitted, with a slight cringe.
"Who's bottom?" Fred added.
Draco groaned and stared up at the ceiling. "Well played, Professor. Well played."
