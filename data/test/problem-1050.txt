Dean felt terribly ashamed and guilty. He’d been so unfair to Seamus. How could he think that Seamus had volunteered to do something like that? And why hadn’t Seamus explained the whole story to him?
I closed my eyes. I hated to admit it, but I was really exhausted. As soon as Astoria left, I fell asleep. I woke up hours later and took a shower. When I came down for dinner, I was actually hungry. Angel smiled when he saw me. Alfred just glanced at me and pretended not to care. I knew he did, though.
“Why not? You were part of a prophecy yourself. You were described to be the one who would kill the Dark Lord. It’s more than all right for your children to be as special as you are, Potter,” Lucius sneered.
I’m not sure how long we stayed that way. We were two bodies desperate for each other’s heat, afraid of facing the harsh reality if we let each other go.
Draco could almost see Harry smiling in the dark. The bloody prick was having fun with the situation and that wasn't supposed to happen. Harry should be feeling sorry for yelling at him and yet he wasn't. He was finding the situation amusing.
“Harry?” he heard someone calling him from the door. “I thought I heard things crashing... I would have thought it was Moony, but it isn’t the full moon yet, not to mention that he’s sleeping right next to me.”
Whatever it was, he had to find out. If his father did something to Nathan or Harry, he would never forgive himself.
“Ok,” Harry answered like a robot. He started to walk to the stairs when he turned around. “What things?”
I knew I was probably very pale. My stomach turned and I felt dizzy. I closed my eyes. If the darkness came to get me I’d welcome it. I would do anything to escape that unpleasant moment.
Draco didn’t know, either. This Bob resembled nothing of the Bob he knew. Although they looked the same, the other Bob was very sharp with his comments. But the major difference was in their eyes. He wondered how the fake Bob could have deceived Harry and Ron so easily. The other Bob had probably used some spell on them.
He ignored the warnings in his head that Seamus could be in trouble and got the keys to his car. It was time to put his pride aside and go talk to Draco at Sweet Tricks, Draco’s ice-cream parlour.
“You know how my father is… Old habits die hard. But Saulus isn’t a bad guy. I mean, he does support the corruption scheme behind the Ministry, but he’s doing a good job as the Minister for Magic.”
I was certain our lips would be terribly swollen in the morning, but who cared. Being called a sexy bastard by Harry Potter made me extra excited.
It was only for a second, but I could swear I saw the desire in his eyes, which were shining as brightly as jewels and were making me feel all mushy inside. His eyes seemed to be telling me to capture those soft lips with mine and just let myself go.
Astoria and I were afraid of what could happen to Scorpius in Hogwarts. My only consolation was that my son was nothing like me. Physically he was my carbon copy; the same hair colour and eyes, the same radiant beauty. But while I had been spoiled and conceited just to hide my deep insecurities, Scorpius was the exact opposite. He was an adorable and charming kid. He knew how to be proud without being arrogant. He was a natural-born aristocrat but without being irritating and haughty. He was my pride and joy and I would do anything for the one who had become my reason for living. I loved Scorpius more than anyone in the world, and I would curse whoever dared to cause him harm.
“No. That was never my intention. When I locked you up, I thought I’d have time to make you realise how wrong you were, and how you behaved so horribly. But before I had the chance to teach you how to be human, I was killed... So it was a good thing I cast that spell before I died,” Nathan smiled sweetly, and Nostrums made a face. He hated to admit it, but that smile had always caused him trouble. That made him even angrier.
Harry frowned but said nothing. He was now in full Chief Auror mode, his eyes scanning the area for possible problems. Instead of doing the same thing, I kept admiring his tall figure like an idiot. He was wearing muggle clothes: black jeans, leather jacket and a long-sleeved t-shirt underneath with “HARDCORE” written on it. His hair was being tousled by the wind. He reminded me of one of those male models on the Witch Weekly magazine. Why did he have to be so bloody gorgeous?
Bob leaned against the stoned wall and sighed. “I don’t know where we are. All I know is that this has been my home for three months now.”
I didn’t exactly mean to but ended up scratching his back and arms several times as I tried to bring him closer. He didn’t seem to mind, though, his movements becoming faster and more desperate as time went by. His moans matched mine as well. I felt my eyes teary. What the bloody hell. Tears, Draco? Really? Whatever. It was just better to let it all go, enjoy the moment to the fullest. The more the fire built up, the more I let myself go. And when I came it was in scorching ecstasy as I had never felt before. I think I stopped breathing for an instant, completely absorbed in Harry. He followed me closely with a strangled moan. It was a beautiful thing to see his face fully taken by desire. So I kissed him. I am happy to say I did not suddenly burst out my love for him, even though it was at the tip of my tongue.
I was the one to give my back to him this time. I wanted to hide my shame and humiliation. Even after such a long time I still couldn’t tell him I was sorry. I was still too proud. I still hated the Weasleys, now more than ever. They had Harry Potter. They’d always had him.
Don’t get me wrong. I do not hate muggles as I did before. I just think they are destroying our world in that mad attempt of replacing magic for what they called technology. That same technology that was now everywhere. I could see it that very instant on Platform Nine 3/4. Several witches and wizards with tiny mobile phones, listening to music, taking pictures of everything and everyone, filming every little bit of their lives. Most of them also had enchanted cars.
“What’s going on here, Goyle?” I asked using the same drawling voice that had made me famous in the past, and that had commanded Goyle to do my whims. For a moment I actually had him there.
Eventually, they became lovers. Seamus was hot and terribly attractive. But he wasn’t Harry. Seamus didn’t seem to be bothered by that fact. He had also been in love with someone else; a Gryffindor that Draco knew only by name: Dean Thomas.
Draco sighed, “Because you are sexy, smart, stylish and you graduated on top of your class, to everybody’s utter surprise. Isn’t that enough?”
"So the Minister agreed with your petition. Finally some good news! I haven’t been that lucky. I’ve been trying to reach Saulus but so far he hasn’t returned any of my messages."
Harry felt the anger rising at the thought. He scowled. “No, I don’t believe that. Even if that monster loved Toledo, I don’t think Toledo loved him. Toledo didn’t even hate him. Look at Nathan. He’s so peaceful. He couldn’t hate anybody. Toledo was just… doing his job by locking up Nostrums.”
Nathan turned to Nostrums, and the moment their eyes locked, Nostrums stopped trying to free himself, and Nathan became very serious.
The next day, they sat at the breakfast table and discussed their fight. Not that Harry wanted to, but Draco insisted so much that he agreed quickly just to prevent another fight from happening. In the end, Harry promised to keep an eye on Bob's actions to see if he noticed anything unusual.
‘Like that is a great challenge, Malfoy,’ he mocked. ‘Don’t forget that you were the one who almost dropped dead the few times we duelled. If we could call that duelling.’
Harry frowned, not wanting to hear the rest of Draco’s theory, but giving up to his curiosity at the same time. “What do you mean?”
As soon as he woke up from his disturbing night of sleep, Draco went looking for Seamus. He entered the gym Seamus frequented on a daily basis that was for wizards only, and he spotted him in a corner talking to some guy. Without saying a word, he grabbed Seamus by his elbows not giving a damn about the attention he was getting from the people around. He dragged a scared and confused Seamus to the dressing room and threw him against the lockers.
My hands got cold and I felt the panic rising. I couldn’t apparate even if I wanted to. He knew that, didn’t he? We were going to Paris by train, for Merlin’s sake.
“A little before Abraxas Malfoy got sick, he received some news again about the Chamber, this time from a very reliable source. The curator of the Cairo museum, Illius Mubarak, sent him some interesting news about it all. Through hieroglyphs, they found out that the Malfoys’ blood was needed to open the place where the book was hidden. The clues end there. Abraxas died a little afterwards and so did Illius. He was hit by a powerful curse as he tried to open a tomb. The location of the chamber was lost.”
Harry sighed. "I’ll get over this stupid trauma, Drake. That’s a promise." Harry noticed that Draco became a little sad and he added. "But I want you to know that I feel the same way." And Draco’s smile was back in place.
For the thousandth time, I told myself that Harry Potter was an illusion and that he would never, not in a million years, be mine. If he knew how I felt even after all those years he would laugh at my face and then send me to hell. Or to therapy. The mere thought made me smirk.
‘What? Are you going to tell me we should continue even though you can barely stand? Stop being so headstrong! Dammit, Malfoy! I’m really going mad if I’m still hoping to take you with me to Egypt when you are so weak!’
Harry made a face, knowing full well he had just made a fool of himself in his attempt to offend me. I noticed that his cheeks went red, and I was overjoyed.
Harry began to feel uncomfortable with their sudden closeness. Bob’s mouth seemed to be coming closer and immediately Harry freed his hand and stood up, distressed. He didn’t want to hurt Bob’s feelings, but he had to make it clear that he loved Draco.
As we ate, Astoria told me the last news about our wizarding elite. My wife was used to tending to the meetings of their Wizarding Club, a place for rich purebloods who still thought of themselves as better than the rest. She complained but I knew she had fun in there. I thought those meetings were a waste of time, but Astoria always had funny stories to tell me about the nonsense that went around. I was curious about what she had to tell me now.
Under curious applauses, Harry Potter entered the stage wearing an elegant custom made robe, with a green pullover underneath which matched his eyes perfectly, and a Gryffindor tie. The last item was clearly a provocation; after all, the Club was for ex-Slytherin students only. I smiled as I saw the mischief in his eyes. I have to confess that I didn’t pay much attention to the speech itself. I couldn’t keep my eyes off of Harry. I wanted to take my sweet time admiring his handsome figure; his green eyes which shone brighter at each word he spoke. The rebel hair he had tried to tame unsuccessfully. The lips that moved so sensually and, finally, the sound of his voice which wrapped around me like velvet. Our eyes met a dozen times. Each and every time I felt my heart beat faster and my face heat up. At every glance, I felt more and more alive. I would love to use Legilimency and get a glimpse of his mind. I knew that Harry had never been very good at Occlumency. Therefore I was sure I’d have no problem to get into his head. Of course, that wouldn’t stop him from cursing me until the next century.
He might not realise it, but he was concerned. I wasn’t dreaming this time. I could see it in his eyes and hear it in the tone of his voice. Harry wasn’t that good of an actor, and he could not have changed completely over time. The old Harry was still there, maybe more composed, but still human and sweet. I dared to hope. Maybe…
Nostrums made an annoyed gesture with his hands. “Yeah, yeah. I know the drill. I didn’t mean it that way.”
“Anyway, although we have our differences – and they are so many, believe me – we also have an important thing in common, which is our love for this wonderful man, Harry Potter – my best friend. I’m not very good at speaking in public, as you all noticed, so I’ll finish by saying that I wish them all the happiness and joy in the world. And Draco, if you hurt my friend, I’ll hex you.” Ron raised his glass and Draco frowned. “Cheers!”
Nostrums felt bothered by Nathan’s tears. He sighed, upset, and knelt beside him, patting him awkwardly on the head.
“Staying is not an option. Not in our case. There’s too much hate in you yet. You want me but at the same time I bet you’re fighting against it.”
Since Draco hadn’t called her back, Hermione went to Harry’s apartment with Ron. What they saw tore their hearts apart. Harry’s state was pitiful. He looked devastated and depressed. It took a while for him to explain what had happened.
Nathan shook his head, and Harry could picture him putting his thumb in his mouth shyly. “Nah. I wish. I’m just a Mage.”
“I’m sorry to say this, Harry, but we’ll have to take you with us to the station. You’ve broken some very serious rules and… Well, you see… I was ordered to take into custody pending a further investigation.”
Harry walked towards the back door and Draco caught him before he went out. "Don’t even think about getting away from me, Harry Potter. Not until you hear my answer."
"I added the H and the D." Harry talked, walking back and forth, cowardly avoiding Draco’s gaze. "I would ask you to live with me. I was afraid of your answer, of course, but I was willing to try anyway. Harry Potter was never a coward."
“Hi!” Hermione greeted Harry and Draco, and then she shot a knowing look at Hope. “I guess you’re the one to blame for the door, huh?” She looked at Harry and then at Draco. “I can’t believe you two! She steps all over you, boys.”
“Where we can go spend the weekends in our nice and cosy cabin in the woods…” Harry said dreamily, and then he kissed Draco’s belly. “I’m sure Lily and Nathan will love that place.”
“What do you mean, he disappeared?” Harry asked panicking. “Where could he go? He’s just a kid. He must be somewhere in your house!”
“Alright,” I told him in a tone a hundred times colder. “But don’t blame me if by tomorrow the Manor is all destroyed, and the boys are nowhere to be seen.”
The first thing that crossed Harry’s mind was that if Lucius had something to do with Draco’s pregnancy then he was up to something. His second thought was that the baby was another science fiction experience created to Lord knows what. There wasn’t any doubt in Harry’s mind that Lucius would want the child to himself and his sick purposes of world domination.
"Since I’ll only see you at the weekend, we should enjoy ourselves while we have the time. What do you think?" he said seductively in Draco’s ear.
“Hey, shut up!” Harry retorted. “You’re not so tough, you know? I mean, look at you. You can’t even move. I thought you were stronger, but I can see that you’re nothing but an annoying prick. Nathan is a peaceful being, but I’m not. If you want, I can kill you. I’ll be glad to.”
Draco sat down by his side but kept a safe distance between them. Harry couldn’t understand why he was being so careful around him. Was Draco afraid of him? Harry couldn’t bear it if he was afraid of him. Harry had been behaving just fine, hadn’t he? Then why was Draco acting so weirdly?
“Please, Elisabeth, it’s not Ron’s fault that I’m here.” Harry winked at her and she blushed. “You know how I am, right? All edgy and impatient.” She nodded vigorously at that. “But I’m also a gentleman, you know that. When was I ever rude to you?”
Their house was now fully protected, which allowed Harry to talk to his son every night through the fireplace. Nathan hadn’t liked to go away at first, but Harry was happy to see that his son had stopped complaining and seemed to be enjoying Sirius’ house and company. It was one less problem to worry about and he could focus on Draco and his sudden pessimism towards their life together.
“No, that was not what I mean and you know it. I’ve always loved to love you, Draco. But this time... this time was different. I don’t know exactly why but it was. I could feel you all over me. I could really feel you in me! Not just metaphorically.”
"Don't worry about it," Hermione said. "I know the people who work at the orphanage and they don't care if you're gay or straight as long as you can provide a stable home for the kid and the proper care. The wizarding community is more tolerating Draco. Trust me."
Neville took them to his office and closed the door. Then he told Harry to sit down while he would run a few tests in Nathan. Harry didn’t like to be left out, but he agreed. To his relief, the tests didn’t take too long, and soon Nathan was back again. Then, Neville asked Nathan a series of questions about how the boy used to feel. Nathan told him that sometimes he felt things – but he couldn’t describe what those feelings were – and that those feelings helped him sense if a person was sad or happy. His father, he explained, seemed to be continuously nervous and worried. Father number two seemed to be always sad because of it.
“We have an agreement with the French government. You see, Malfoy, we’ve always been watching Lucius Malfoy. Do you think we’d just let him move out of the UK without doing anything? Your father knows that if he steps out of line he will go back to Azkaban, and this time he won’t have the right to an appeal.”
“It was an accident,” Lucius said bitterly. “She panicked when she realised what we had done, and she tried to attack her medi-wizard. It was self-defence.”
That does it, thought Hermione. They couldn't stay outside the door forever, listening to whatever Harry and Draco were doing. She had a doctor's appointment in an hour and she couldn't miss it because Dr Sheila would examine her and the baby she was expecting. Besides, she didn't want to hear them having sex. She also didn't like the way Ron was staring at the door, paying attention to every sound, as if he was more than interesting in what they were doing in there.
Nostrums took advantage of their distraction to finally break free from Nathan’s spell. He smiled perniciously and took the Corona of Power from his pocket. Nathan held his breath when he saw the rounded object.
How long had it been since I had entered Borgin and Burkes? The items on the dusty shelves didn’t look so creepy anymore, but I could bet they were just as dangerous. Almost all of them had the ‘do not touch’ sign. There was a jar full of eyes on the counter. One of them blinked at me. On the walls, I could see contorted masks that seemed to want to scare me away.
Draco stopped at the door of his room completely dazzled by the image of Harry Potter lying naked on his bed. He still had to pinch himself every now and then to convince his heart that Harry was actually there. When he saw Harry at his door, he thought the raven-haired man would beat the shit out of him. But instead, Harry had kissed him. He wanted Draco as much as Draco wanted him. The question was: for how long? Draco had been in love with him ever since he could remember. Could he cope with the fact that he could only have Harry’s body but not his heart? Could he face without falling apart the day Harry decided to walk out of his life because the desire he felt for Draco faded away?
Lucius’ face turned a light shade of red. Harry couldn’t believe his eyes. Could it be that Lucius was embarrassed?
“He told me that.” Draco stared on. “I didn’t have a problem with Seamus’ past because I knew that world very well. It was something normal, I guess. I know it sounds horrible to say something like this, but it’s the truth. Normal from an ex-Death Eater’s point of view... But I saw Dean’s face and I realise how hard it must be for him. I came from an imperfect world. Thomas has no idea about it. He belongs to the slightly perfect muggle world.”
He only sighed before freeing himself and vanishing from Harry’s sight. Oh, how much Harry wanted to just send Elisabeth to hell and chase after him. Harry looked back at her, wanting to throw her out of the window. She was yelling about firing him if he didn’t start to behave properly, but Harry wasn’t listening. His mind was thinking about how pale Draco looked all of a sudden before he left.
"Oh, he’s tall, has brown hair and blue eyes. He’s not old but not young either. I think he’s in his middle forties or something. He’s a very handsome fellow. I would give him a head if he asked me to," Seamus joked.
I was exhausted. I sat on the nearest armchair to try to hide my discomfort. If he noticed anything, he didn’t say.
“Leave it, Travers. We just want the boys, Malfoy,’ Goyle insisted. He had his wand on his hand and he was ready to use it. We weren’t friends anymore. Actually, we had never really been friends.
Harry ran his fingers along Draco’s face gently, stopping on Draco’s lips. “I’m sorry. You were sexy. It’s just that… you know what I’m like after I face too much stress, don’t you? I have this tendency to laugh without a reason. I’m just glad that it’s finally over and you’re here with this sexy look and sexy tone of voice.”
“WHEEEE!” shouted the twins. Arielle and George were running around the living room and breaking everything in their way. Hermione and Ron ran to stop their kids before they could break Draco’s crystal vase.
“I’ve been trying to talk to Lucius all week. He just disappeared. Saulus is not returning my letters, either. I’m positive now that they have something to do with the occurrence, or else they wouldn’t have just vanished,” Draco informed him sadly. “I’ve been thinking a lot lately… about us. If Bob had the guts to come here to tell you about Lucius, it’s because I’m screwed. Maybe you should leave me. That way they will leave you alone.”
He opened the door of Draco’s office and his eyes immediately fell upon Seamus hand that was resting on Draco’s shoulder. They were laughing at something and Harry, once again, hated them both for having such a great relationship. They’d been lovers, for Merlin’s sake! Why couldn’t they just hate each other like some normal ex-couple?
“Oh, you know Snape. He freaked out at first but eventually, he was OK with it. He was really supportive. He actually said that I could stay with him if you kicked me out.”
I bet he was. Harry had probably struggled not to laugh. The spoiled-brat Malfoy was a weak adult who could barely make use of magic without collapsing. It was humiliating.
Harry looked at Nathan. “Nathan... So you are... the guy who kicked Nostrums’ ass in the past? You’re Toledo reincarnated? This is so unbelievable...”
Abruptly, Harry had turned Draco around. Draco had felt the cold of the ice cream touching the delicate skin of his back and Harry’s tongue licking him all over. He shuddered violently. His hands gripped the white sheet. Harry positioned himself behind him, teasing him for a moment by entering him very slowly, millimetre by excruciatingly tantalizing millimetre. Draco’s excitement increased, but Harry kept the activity deliberately unhurried.
‘At this wall we made passionate love after a fight.’ he thought. ‘He had broken my favourite CD, and he was so sorry afterwards. Of course, he didn’t like that CD, but even I didn’t care when he started to kiss me and… Damn it, Harry! Get a grip of yourself!’
“All right! If you must know,” Lucius rolled his eyes and sat down on the bench again. “All I can say to you, for now, is that I took the liberty to stew a potion called Praegnans who would allow you to get pregnant from your beloved Harry Potter. You, like a bloody fool, drank it without even noticing! I taught you better than that, Draco, but I guess your love for Potter made you soft.”
“And for a bad guy, he wasn’t so bad. I mean, he made the normal threats that villains do in situations like that, but I was actually lucky. I stayed in a very nice room, and the food was also very good.”
He caught me by my arms and pulled me. Our bodies touched. Our lips were so close that breathing was difficult.
They had barely gotten home and reporters from the Daily Prophet were all over the place. Harry cursed under his breath as Ron and Draco tried to pass the crowd to open the door.
As a thought occurred to me suddenly, I went to find the Auror named Grey. I found him outside the Manor, at the back, and I asked him to get in touch with Harry right away.
There he was, dancing with another man, everybody starting to stare, and he didn’t care one bit. He was bedazzled by the stranger’s eyes, by his strong hands touching his waist slightly, and the soft scent of musk that was exhaling from the stranger’s body and was driving Harry insane.
"I’m feeling better. I really hate to admit this, but you’re right. Longbottom is a good doctor. Or will be. Whatever," he said against his will. "Hermione helped him to prepare the potion, so the credit is hers as well."
Hermione chuckled as she kept reading. “Oh, this is priceless. Bubble baths, Lamaze, oh! Full moon baths!”
Horace was a good guy though and he liked Harry. He was trying his best to get Harry out of there, but he was having some trouble with his superiors. Someone out there really hated Harry.
“Well, the night was perfect,” Harry said, sitting down the bed. “It’s just that when I asked his name, he said I would hate him if I knew. But how can I hate someone I made such passionate love to last night? How can I hate him if my body accepted him freely? If my heart opened up its doors for him?”
Jonas undid the spell and the door flew open. Draco came back a few minutes later with the hooded man by his side, a smirk on his face. Jonas closed the door again, locked it and turned to face them. The mysterious man took his hood off and showed his true face.
My father had never quite liked the idea of me on the piano. It was an activity for sissies in his eyes. My mother, however, made sure that I learnt it, and learnt it well. The art of playing the piano, of running your fingers gently along with the keys and creating perfect harmony is magic. It transcends one’s soul. It shapes it, makes it softer and more beautiful. At least that’s how I felt every time I played it.
Harry frowned, trying to figure out what Draco was shouting about. The running water was preventing Harry from hearing him clearly. He shrugged and rinsed his hair. He was certain that Draco could handle whatever it was. He took his time in the shower until he heard more shouting, and this time he could clearly distinguish the words “divorce” and “going away to a place where no one can find me”. But what really made him get out of the shower in a hurry were the words “no sex for a month”. He wrapped a towel around his waist and made his way to the corridor. It was empty. He looked around, confused until he heard the annoying sound of the doorbell being rung repeatedly. This was followed by yet another threat from Draco. Harry raised an eyebrow and wondered why no one had answered the door yet. Draco knew he was in the shower.
“Draco...” Harry leaned against the door, tired, and stared deeply into his eyes. “I want to make it up to you. I don’t want you to leave. You’re everything to me.”
“I think he’s dead because he’s not arrested, that much I know. His name is Joe Partride. He was a Death Eater, but not a very important one. He stayed with my mother until Angel was born. Then, when Angel was 2, he scampered.”
When Harry finally got to St. Mungo’s, he ran to the reception at full speed, speaking and acting senselessly. Nathan, who was right next to Harry, explained the situation to an open-mouthed receptionist. A nurse who was passing by instantly summoned a stretcher, and after a while, Draco was brought to a large bedroom.
Draco smiled. "Yeah, I have it. Just ask Tom and he’ll give it to you. And maybe when you satiate yours and the baby’s need for ice-cream, you can actually help me with this!" He lifted the parchment.
“I just wanted to let you know, Harry.” Bob didn’t seem satisfied with Harry’s reaction but didn’t say anything.
When he came to pick me up for our next round, he made sure I ate breakfast with him and a number of other Aurors who kept calling me Jones. It was a horrifying experience. Thankfully, no one seemed to realise who I really was. Also, I made a vow to never be around so many Aurors in my life ever again.
I stopped breathlessly. My whole body trembled. I had said too many things in a short period of time. I had no idea how Harry would react. All I knew was that I was tired, not just physically but mentally as well. I was tired of being a coward, of running away from everything, of pretending I didn’t want Harry when I wanted him more than anything in the world, even more than my stupid pride.
Perhaps. Not that it really mattered. I made a face. Who was I kidding? The kids already had a special place in my heart.
“More than I am already? Anyway, could you give me back the letter now that you’ve finished reading it?”
Ah, so that was what he thought I was doing. I guess it was better to be accused of casting a spell on him than cheap seduction.
A lot of time was spent discussing whether Knockturn Alley should be closed down forever. Some stores had been empty for fifteen years or so. Some still remained intact. Since certain magical items and products could only be found in Knockturn Alley, closing it down ceased to be an option. Unfortunately, the wizarding community needed a place such as this one. Needless to say that Harry was not happy with the Ministry’s decision, but there wasn’t anything he could do but keep an eye on it. You were allowed to sell dangerous, but legal, items in Knockturn Alley. Any illegal activity would be immediately terminated. But in places like this, there would always be illegal things going on.
I used to think my character had improved after the war but had it really? How did I expect Harry to notice me if I was still the same?
So far, all I had done was watch Harry teach Alfred how to control his powers through his wand instead of wrecking everything around us. Not that it hadn’t been interesting, mind you. Harry was quite a good teacher, patient and yet strict. I still remember a time when he became a Defense against the Dark Art teacher at Hogwarts. I remember how jealous I felt for not being part of the group, which was why I had actually wanted to rat him out to Umbridge in the first place.
"But I’m glad you called me on time, Harry. He has a new kind of flu that is spreading through the wizarding community. We don’t know what causes it. All we know is that it appears all of a sudden, then it goes away, and then it comes back again more powerful than before. Some patients got a stronger type of pneumonia and unfortunately one of them died last week. But Draco will be fine. Luckily, he’s still on stage two of the disease and after a reinvigorating tonic we created at the hospital, he’ll be as good as new. Stage five is the one we should be worried about. But that isn’t the case," Neville explained. "I have the ingredients here. May I use your kitchen, Harry?"
I decided to read a book, thinking that it would distract me. Sweet illusion. I kept thinking about what Harry might be doing and with whom. I pictured him with Ginny Weasley living an idyllic domestic scene. I felt like throwing up at once.
I sat up at once. I had confessed what I wanted to Harry. Out loud. How was I still alive? Why hadn’t the world stopped spinning?
“And here I was thinking that you left them in my way on purpose. You’ve got a horrible taste for art, Malfoy.”
“What are you doing?” he asked in the same soft tone of voice that I knew was hiding something else entirely.
“We thought a little fresh air would do him good,” said Astoria. “And it did, right? Draco’s face has a lovely colour now, don’t you think?”
There was a hint of victory in my trembling voice. My eyes were probably sparkling madly with deep satisfaction. That was my moment of triumph. So Harry Potter didn’t need me as I needed him. But at least he needed my help. It was a huge step. Would I be able to hide my excitement?
Draco frowned. “You made a food list, Harry. And you arranged my entire schedule. Brutus will have to stay in the garden?” Draco looked at Brutus and the dog whined at Harry. “He won’t stay in the garden, Harry. He will stay here, with me, like always.”
They looked at each other for a long time until Nathan stepped between then and demanded a goodbye kiss from Draco. Draco kissed his cheek soundly.
Dean kissed Seamus slowly, taking his time to savour his lips. When they parted, Seamus had his eyes closed and a blissful expression on his face.
It seemed as if the clock had stopped, for all night he kept rolling on his bed without sleeping. Harry didn’t leave his mind not even for a single second, but he refused to shed any more tears for him. He was dried out, empty, numb. He just wished he were the same Malfoy he once was; that same cold-blooded bastard that Voldemort and Lucius had been so proud of. Then he could just forget about Harry and all their wonderful moments spent together. Or he could send to hell his civilized side and burst into Seamus’ apartment without further delay. But he wouldn’t do that. He didn’t even know for sure if Seamus was guilty.
We got fully immersed in the melody. He won me over completely. Until that moment he had been nothing but a means to an end – to keep Harry Potter close by. Now I was really seeing him for the first time. I saw the fragile and adorable boy that he was, a boy people like Goyle wanted to turn into Slytherin. It was as surreal as both of us playing the piano together.
“I’ll go with you,” Harry stated talking Draco by surprise. “Oh, my. I still can’t believe it! A baby! Nat will be so happy!”
Draco helped her to bring them in and when Narcissa was comfortably seated on the couch, he explained to her that Harry and Nathan weren’t there. He didn’t tell her where they were and Narcissa understood that he couldn’t.
“I’ll answer you. But before I do, you’ll have to answer me first. Why don’t you want me if I’m just like him?”
Jonas didn’t have to think much to remember. “Oh, yes! He had some strange friends in here, but he was a nice fellow.”
‘You never are!’ He seemed frustrated on top of the anger. ‘I don’t care if you’re hungry or not. You need to eat something. We’ll be facing the desert tomorrow. Do you have any idea of what that means?’
He looked up at Nostrums and stared into his black eyes. Nostrums had changed back to his original form, and Nathan held his breath at the devastating vision. Nostrums’ hair was still very long, and his beauty was like a punch in the face. Nathan’s heart skipped a beat. His body was of a five-year-old but his reaction was that of an adult. His body trembled, and he bit his lower lip nervously. He was scared, and he couldn’t tell if those were really his feelings or Nostrums’.
Silence. My body began to show signs that having Harry on top of me was making me quite a happy man. I panicked and tried to escape. Harry just locked me in his arms tighter. He was having fun at my expense. I wonder if he would find it that funny to have my erection brush against his leg.
"And I’m glad I’ve dropped by. You needed my help," he continued. "I came here because I had something to say to you. I lied to you, Draco, and I’m sorry."
Two things made me relax when my anxiety attacked me and I felt like I was stuck inside myself, desperate to simply be free, and that would be walking around my property with my dogs or play the piano.
I gave them plenty of time to think about things. Angel’s decision was immediate and rather sweet. He put his arms around Astoria and hugged her as tightly as he could. My wife almost cried her heart out.
Luckily, Harry kept quiet. He just stared at me for a long time as if trying to know what was going through my head. He looked at me as if he had never seen me before; as if I was a puzzle to be solved. The Great Harry Potter was perplexed and I was the cause of it. I felt as though I had accomplished something very important.
Louis whispered something in Harry’s ear. I clutched my fists at his audacity. I could see in his eyes that he didn’t trust me nor did he like my presence in the room.
So the night came, and in better spirits, I went down to have dinner. Angel’s enthusiasm as he filled his mouth with spoonfuls of food encouraged me to eat more than my usual share. After dinner, we went to the main living room and played a wizard’s board game that Scorpius used to love. I was marvelled when I heard Angel’s laughter every time his enchanted doll overtook one of ours.
“No. It only has one leap. Just for fun. I can assure you that he is made of chocolate and nothing more.”
Nathan would be a human being with unparalleled powers. Muggle scientists and wizards had found a way to mix magic with genetically altered DNA so Nathan would be more than just a wizard. With the proper education, Nathan would be a weapon for their causes and they would be masters of the world.
The train whistled. It was ready to leave. The gibbering around me increased. The happiness, the loud laughter, and the farewells let me slightly dizzy. I hated crowds, but I would endure it all for Scorpius.
"But you didn’t want to live, did you?" It was more of an affirmation than a question. "You didn’t even try to fight the water, Harry."
She sighed, "That's why we're knocking. The whole purpose of knocking the bloody door is to give them time to be perfectly presentable when they open it for us! I don't get you. If I didn't know you better, I would think you're interested in joining them!"
I was starting to believe in my therapist, that is to say, that my condition had everything to do with my past. I had only collapsed after those unpleasant memories had washed over me. Harry was a big part of the problem, but not the only one. I was a haunted man.
“What? Alive?” Draco nodded, and Harry sneered. “Yes, but barely. I’ve been using the Corona to suck his energy. Seamus was actually useful. You came after him. Things couldn’t be better. My slave has been following you for a while. You were very stupid, Draco. You fell into a childish trap. It wasn’t difficult to stun you and that stupid red-head.”
“Do you think… do you reckon something happened to him?” Dean asked, his heart almost coming out of his mouth. “With the Death Eaters on the loose again, maybe they got him. Oh, my God. Maybe he’s hurt or even d-d…” Dean didn’t finish his sentence. He couldn’t. “I’ll never forgive myself if something happens to him.”
“Yes, but what does that mean exactly?” Harry replied. “You said he abandoned Voldemort in the end because he had other plans. One of his plans was Nathan! Can’t you see? He’s as bad as Voldemort! Maybe he plans to kidnap my son!”
"You don’t need to know the details. All you need to know is that in the end, I was sick of Voldemort and Saulus offered me a way out. I took it without hesitation. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t transformed into a nice person all of a sudden. I just wanted out. My plans were different. They still are. The fact was that someone framed me and an Auror was sent to kill me. I bribed him and he let me go."
I wish I could say that I slept like a baby, but my state of mind was such that I had nightmares throughout the night. I woke up as if a horde of elephants had given a party in my brain.
“Draco, honey, have you eaten?” she asked taking her eyes off her weekly witch gardening magazine for a moment.
I refused to let him go when we were done. I just locked him in my arms and leaned my head on his large shoulder. His panting breath matched my own, and so did the fast beating of his heart.
Draco made a nasty gesture with his middle finger and Harry intervened, “Alright. Stop, both of you! This is a wedding ceremony. Let’s not spoil it with this old ridiculous school quarrel.”
Harry didn’t know how lucky he was. Draco was the perfect boyfriend. He always seemed to know exactly what Harry wanted just by looking at him. He knew precisely where and how to touch Harry’s body making both to lose control and avidly search for infinite ways of pleasuring each other. He was also tender, caring and had an unlimited patience towards Harry’s sudden bursts. Hermione only knew these intimate details out of confidentiality.
“I don’t think you know anything else, Malfoy. You’re just wasting my time...” said Harry in a whisper.
Nathan didn’t know what to make of anything. He felt totally lost. The five-year-old inside him wanted to seek his father’s comfort. Nostrums was right. He was a hypocrite. He had never felt such strong feelings before. He had never felt that kind of passion. He was shocked and sad. He could feel Nostrums’ desperation, the pain of unrequited love, the hatred and anger. He could feel everything, and he didn’t know how to deal with it.
“Oh, that’s just so bloody typical of you! Try picturing me kissing someone else, and you watching the whole thing from across the street!”
Saulus sighed. “There was a prophecy five years ago, a little before Nathan was born, that the child of the lion would bring peace to the wizarding world, but a new evil would rise with him. Back then we thought that nothing could be worse than Lord Voldemort, but we were wrong. A demon called Nostrums was set loose when Voldemort died.”
His statement was proof enough that his demeanour had improved greatly. If Alfred had plans to leave, he would just take Angel and dash without saying goodbye. Even with Aurors all around us, I was almost sure he could make a successful getaway. Instead, he had warned me of his plans in advance.
“He’s fine. He’s so calm. I don’t remember being that way when I was a child. I used to set the curtains on fire and teased the house-elves until they wanted to jump out of the window. I sent at least four babysitters to St. Mungo’s Hospital because I drove them insane. I could never stop!”
He crossed his arms as if to wait for my answer. I guess that was a good sign. He was angry, but he had neither punched nor threatened to take me to St Mungus.
After some time, Harry said, ‘I’m serious, Malfoy. I don’t see how you can come to Egypt with me. The idea seems really absurd now, more than before.’
Half of the people that were practically glued on the door fell forward when they opened it. Harry barely saw this. His eyes were too busy staring at Draco. When the door was closed again, he looked at a big aquarium filled with exotic fishes that used to calm him down.
And speaking of the devil... Part of me wanted to get in touch with him and tell him everything that had happened. Another part was too scared. I had no idea what was going on in the wizarding world and I didn’t like it.
“Nathan might wake up,” Draco muttered between kisses and moans. “Kids always wake up at improper times such as this. Oh, keep doing that. Yes. Hmm… that’s good…”
I went still as a statue. My wand slipped from my hand. Coward. Just because he was its true master and not me. Treacherous wand.
He fumbled around the table in search for his wand and he did not dare take his eyes away from Draco’s sparkling ones. He muttered the lubricant spell and prepared Draco’s warm entry with his long fingers. Draco’s face flushed and contorted in pleasure.
Harry made a face as Draco mentioned Severus. Harry still had issues with Snape, but he had to admit that the greasy old bastard wasn’t so bad. Severus had kept Harry company the day Harry hadn’t been allowed to see Draco. They had talked a lot, to Harry’s utter surprise. He never thought it would be easy to talk to his ex-Professor, a man he had hated while in school.
That was how Harry found him a little after 9 pm. Brutus received Harry barking madly and almost throwing him to the floor. But after the welcome feast, he bit Harry’s shirt and led him to Draco’s bedroom so his owner could have the proper care. Harry thought it was funny for a moment until he saw Draco spread out on his bed, turning from one side to another with his face flushed from the fever, tears falling down his cheeks from the nightmares he was having. Harry immediately measured Draco’s temperature and confirmed that it was indeed too high.
I nodded and smiled. Things were not fine, but Angel didn’t need to know that. He was extremely sensitive.
“Yes. Don’t worry; I’ll go there every day to see how things are going. I’m sure Daphne can handle things on her own. It’s not like she hasn’t done it before.”
Harry almost collapsed on the floor from the relief. He hugged them tightly, too tired to do anything else. Ron, George and Fred took charge of the situation, pulling both of them out of the street and taking Nathan to the Hospital. Fred stayed behind to warn the others about the incident.
Harry felt like an animal trapped in a cage. By the end of the day, he felt enraged with everyone, even Ron, who didn’t deserve his outburst. But on the morning of a new day, he was a little calmer. Just a little.
“Nathan doesn’t blame you and neither do I,” Harry whispered in his ear, wrapping his arms around him.
“Don’t say it. We’re not on good terms right now so don’t push your luck,” Draco said with a blank expression. “I know that he’s not the most reliable person in the world, but he told me the truth about Nathan, didn’t he?”
Harry followed the nurse with his heart in his mouth. His fears were quieted by Dr Jules’ calmness. There wasn’t anything to be afraid of. In fact, Dr Jules was surprised at how fast Draco’s body seemed to be healing.
“He’s confused by his feelings for Draco, or should I say your feelings for Draco,” Nathan explained, looking at Harry. “He never felt such a strong love before. I don’t think he ever fell in love, or if he did...”
“Husband? You’re a puff!?” He looked at Harry with aversion and then turned to talk to Horace, “How can you allow the kid to stay with them? Unless you’re one of their kind! I want you all out of my property! NOW! And the kid stays!”
Draco started to cry. He wanted to push Bob away, but he didn’t have the strength to do it. Bob was being strangely nice to him, and as Draco’s eyes met his, he noticed that this Bob didn’t have the same mad look like the other one. And it was then that Draco understood. He made a huge effort to stop crying. The pain ceased a little, and he sighed deeply.
“I must speak to the boys,” Harry said without taking my unpleasantness into consideration. “They’ll be taken to our Institution. They’ll be protected there. Could you call them, please?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Calm down. He’s in Paris. He was too depressed knowing that the Corona of Power had vanished, so he needed to cool down.”
I took my pills hoping to feel better. Even though the family Healer had prescribed me something stronger, I refused to take it. I was sick and needed help, but I wanted to keep the illusion that I could fight it all with my own strength. If the medicine was stronger than what would be my merit in getting better?
Harry smiled feebly. “I appreciate your loyalty, Horace, but you might lose your job if you stick by my side.”
He ignored them with a snort, pleased with the fact that very soon that disgusting town would be crying the loss of their dear hero while he would be back at his castle with a famous prisoner by his side.
“I’m not leaving until I see you eat something. And this is an order, Malfoy, just in case you are wondering.”
She sipped the water and sighed. “It’s going to be on the cover of The Daily Prophet tomorrow. The Ministry will accuse you of wanting to be the next Dark Lord. They’re saying that you didn’t want to participate in the operation because you were afraid of being recognised.”
After exchanging a fiery kiss, Harry had poured a little of the Vodka onto Draco’s chest. Draco had felt his body melting at every cold swipe of Harry’s delicious tongue on his hard nipples, then on his belly and at last on his rigid shaft. He’d suckled him until Draco had come screaming Harry’s name madly.
I felt like showing him the finger, but I realised it would be rather childish so I held myself back.
She got quiet when she saw Harry by the bed. I didn’t know whether I felt relieved or annoyed by her interruption.
I felt my body weakened, however. I didn’t want anyone to notice, so I excused myself and took refuge in an empty hall. My vision was blurred. I leaned on a marble pillar and was about to let gravity take me down when a pair of strong arms got me before I could fall. If only I could see more clearly. I knew it was Harry because of the perfume, but mainly because of the way my body reacted to his touch. I shivered from pleasure and not pain as he probably must have thought. Next thing I knew he led me to the nearest sofa and knelt down in front of me. He seemed genuinely concerned. My heart softened.
“Then it’s fine by me.” Harry shrugged. “The cabin is yours, too, Draco. You can burn it if you want to, but I advise you not to do it. I like this cabin a lot. It’s so peaceful here. I used to come here almost every weekend to cool my head. I hope you enjoy it as well as I do.”
In a daring move to a cold man like me, I embraced and kissed him. Harry’s mouth accepted mine in his willingly and entirely. His hands were all over me, rubbing me against him. Our kiss deepened and I was rewarded with a sweet battle of tongues.
In front of Harry, Bob acted like a gentleman. However, the moment he was alone with Draco in the loo, he showed his true face. He told Draco he had been in love with Harry for too long for Draco to come along and snatch him away. Bob had all the advantages on his side, or so he thought. As he explained to Draco, he wasn't an ex-Death Eater who hadn't proved his innocence. Bob, on the other hand, had been there for Harry every time he had needed him and he was also a decorated Auror. Draco was a nobody. Bob made Draco feel as if he wasn't worthy of stepping on the same floor as Harry.
Draco surrendered the moment Harry’s tongue met his and danced together. Harry’s hands eagerly travelled down his chest, burning his skin. Draco shut the door with his feet and led Harry to the couch. They stumbled down without letting each other go. Draco closed his eyes while Harry bit and licked his elegant neck. They took off the rest of their clothes and threw them on the floor clumsily.
“The book in the British Museum definitely doesn’t belong to us wizards,” he said. “There’s nothing there that could be considered dangerous.”
"Bob will introduce us his new girlfriend and he invited me and Harry to have dinner with him tonight. Of course, you and Hermione are invited as well."
“Hey, Nat, would you like to play a chess game with me?” Ron suggested. “We could go to your room and you could show me if you’ve learned the moves I’ve taught you. What do you think?”
He missed his bed, his Draco, his son, even Brutus and his nasty behaviour. He hadn’t even had the opportunity to hold his son in his arms. Nathan had met his father for a minute only to watch him being taken away like a criminal.
“That’s not true. But I understand if you don’t want to believe me. You know, however, that Matthew and the others are wrong. The muggles are not to blame for your current situation. They don’t deserve to be punished for something they don’t even know about.”
“I’m not, and Matthew knows that. You know it too, Alfred. After all, you were chased by the same monsters that created the Death Gang – The Almighty. You know very well that Matthew is just a pawn in the hands of ill-intentioned witches and wizards. It’s because of this that you’re running away with your brother, isn’t it?”
My only concern was staying in the same room with Harry without having a heart attack. A part of me was afraid of being alone with him. The other part, however, was more than willing to face his green eyes.
“FUNNY?” Draco shouted. “FUNNY? Your stupid joke ruined my relationship with Harry, you idiot! Because of you Harry broke up with me last night! He thought I was cheating on him!”
I sat on a bench nearby and stared at the floor. My eyes were lost somewhere else. I swallowed hard. Harry Potter needed me because only a Malfoy could break the curse of the book. My eyes went wide open and I looked at him. Before I could help myself, I smirked.
“Did you really think that I would let you kiss me and drag me inside if I had someone else in here?”
Hope gave him the wand hesitantly and then her lips trembled. Draco sighed as he watched Harry descending the stairs and kneeling in front of her.
I got a little closer in order to listen to Harry’s answer, and I had fun watching the thunderstruck look of some of the wizards and witches who had heard the impertinent question. “What we want is for everybody in our community to get together and help,” Harry began, “especially now that our youth delinquency has increased. I believe we are all at fault here. These kids wouldn’t have turned to crime if we had paid better attention to their needs.” I was so close now that I could smell citrus and sandalwood, Harry’s familiar scent. “The fact that these boys and girls are children and grandchildren of ex-Death Eaters only makes matters worse,” Harry continued passionately. “I hope everyone can support our cause!”
Papers flew all over the room and Harry’s computer crashed down on the floor along with a rounded-glass paperweight, making a loud noise. Harry didn’t seem to care for any of those things. He lay on top of Draco, kissing him eagerly and taking off their clothes impatiently. Draco could do nothing but surrender to Harry’s urgent ministration.
Her lips trembled and her blue eyes filled with tears. “I wanna go!” She wrapped her arms around Nathan’s waist. Draco and Harry tried to take her away, but she seemed to be glued on Nathan.
“Harry...” Sirius started, but Harry cut him off, “No, Sirius! Come back to your house and look for him everywhere! Cast a Locating Spell if you have to! I don’t care what you do! FIND HIM! I can’t deal with this. Oh, God!” Harry sat down on the couch and hid his face in his hands. “I can’t lose them. I just can’t.”
"Yeah, right. Look, stay at my place tonight. You can’t go back to your house. It’s not safe. I mean, your house doesn’t have any wards and Brutus is not a real threat to anyone. There’re plenty of rooms at home. Hermione will be delighted to have you there. She’s still angry with me..."
Draco’s business was going well too. He had opened two branches of his ice-cream parlour in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade.
Harry thanked Horace before going to where Nathan was. He found him in his room with Hermione and Ron.
Brutus whined and tried to get away but Draco wouldn’t let him loose. They started a clumsy fight and in the end, Draco and Nathan were laughing hard at the whole thing. Brutus sat on the floor, defeated. Nathan approached him and received a big lick on the face. He laughed.
Taking a deep breath, he entered the place, his wand in his pocket. The pub was almost empty. Two wizards sat on a corner, drinking and talking in whispers. Another one was having a drink quietly at the other side of the room, and a hooded figure was talking to the bartender. None of them looked at Draco, but he knew better. They were watching him discreetly, wondering what he was doing there, and evaluating how strong he was.
His mind drifted away to Harry again. He wondered if the potion would work until morning and if Harry would be too mad at him. Draco didn’t even know if he’d be back for the morning from his expedition. He didn’t have time to think about it, though. Fred was very impatient.
If you've read it so far, thank you for your time. There is a sequel coming called Just a Step From Heaven.
Draco stood up in front of him beautifully naked. Harry seemed hypnotized by his stiff manhood. Draco noted with amusement Harry’s bobbing Adam’s apple and quick indrawn breath. He took Harry’s hand in his own and slowly licked and sucked his fingers one by one. Harry groaned.
Harry sighed. “I don’t know. Neville gave me this potion to drink so I wouldn’t worry too much. Let’s just say I’ve scared three nurses for a lifetime with my anxiety. Now I’m just… waiting. There were complications, but Neville told me Draco is doing fine. Dr Jules told him that he never saw anyone as calm as Draco in that delivery room. Apparently, most men panic. I know I would. Do you think Draco will be angry at me because I didn’t stay in the delivery room with him?”
“I don’t mean about my appearance, you moron! I mean that I don’t want him to see me in here, confined like a goddamn prisoner! I’m not a criminal! I’ve given my life to fighting crime and now look at me! The hero of the wizarding world... what a joke!” Harry said with irony.
Harry shook his head, his temper rising. “What do you mean by nothing? You fainted and there was no one around to help you. Hermione should have stayed here.”
“Harry, calm down,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand and squeezing it. “Neville knows what he’s doing. He’s the doctor, not you.”
‘I’m interested because of Angel’s well-being.’ This was true. ‘But I’m also interested because technically, the book belongs to the Malfoys. And I want what’s mine by right.’
‘Why do we have to talk about it now? Are you my wife by any chance? Do you have any right over me, Malfoy? Do you? It was just one night! Don’t make me regret it, because frankly I am starting to.’
"Tell me something, Draco. If your father was really alive, then why would you want to see him? As far as I know, Lucius Malfoy was a very wicked man."
"In a way, I’m glad we didn’t. It would have been just an additional complication." Harry stopped laughing, suddenly becoming very serious.
“Coincidence? What are you talking about?” Bob asked with confusion. Lee just rolled his eyes. “Horace and my buddies were the real heroes.”
“How wonderful!” said the woman I thought was my wife. “Just take it easy, will you? Draco also needs to rest.”
Not that the place wasn’t gorgeous. Sirius’ mansion was a mix of Muggle classical architecture and modern Wizards’. The visual should have been quite strange but it wasn’t. He’d managed to make the decor in such a way that the old and modern fit perfectly. If Draco wasn’t so worried he would have appreciated it very much but Lucius, the Death Eaters and his pregnancy just wouldn’t leave his mind.
Saulus’ thugs dropped Draco near his house. Draco had asked them to because he wanted to walk home and think about the things he’d learned from his father and Saulus. Saulus wasn’t such a bad guy. Draco still didn’t know if he could trust him, but so far Saulus had been really nice to him. Lucius, on the other hand, wasn’t so pleasant. But then again, Lucius wasn’t a pleasant kind of guy. That was the reason why Draco had doubts about his stepfather’s motives. If Saulus was a good person, he wouldn’t be with Lucius. Or would he?
‘I may not be Potter, but I still have some strength left to teach you some manners,’ I grumbled all the same.
Slowly, he opened his eyes and saw Nathan smiling at him. He smiled back, wondering why his back hurt so much and then realising that he was spread out on the couch. He stretched himself and before he could react properly, Nathan jumped on top of him.
Draco's mouth opened with surprise, and Harry took that opportunity to lean forward and capture those delicious pink lips on his. Draco protested at first and tried to break free from Harry's grip. But as the kiss went on, a pleasant tingle ran down his spine and made him all mushy inside.
He lay on top of Draco, bringing him closer and kissing him ardently. Harry’s tongue invaded his mouth, imitating the sexual act. Soon their bodies started to move on their own. Harry slipped his tongue over Draco’s neck, making him let out a very profound moan. Draco buried his hands inside Harry’s black hair and pulled it up so they could be face to face. He looked deep into Harry’s eyes and saw in them the sparking fire and desire. Harry’s succulent lips were already red swollen and asking for a tender bite. His manhood throbbed just by looking at Harry’s surrender.
Harry didn't understand how everything went so wrong. One minute they were fine and in the next Draco was trying to pick a fight with Bob for no reason. Harry couldn't believe that Bob had said all those nasty things to Draco. But what if it was true? Draco wouldn't invent those things out of nowhere. Why would he?
“Horace is trying to convince his boss that this is all a big misunderstanding. So far, things don’t look so good. Someone big is behind all this but I’ll discover who it is.”
Lucius sneered, “Well, considering that it’s yours and Draco’s child, I’m sure the baby will grow up to do extraordinary things.”
Hermione looked at him, raising an eyebrow. She had to agree with Draco when he said that there was something very wrong with that guy. She’d tell Ron about her suspicions later.
“Melissa Brickwall and Joe Partridge were their parents. Alfred thinks his father is dead, but he isn’t sure.”
While Draco and Harry talked, Sirius and Remus stared at each other awkwardly. They hadn’t spoken to each other for a while, due to circumstances that they did not wish to share with Harry. Harry hadn’t understood at first why Remus and Sirius had fought and he had felt sad when Remus hadn’t shown up at his wedding.
"Yes, right." Harry kept looking everywhere but to where Draco was standing. "I still want you to live with me, but I won’t force you to give me an answer right now. The anxiety will probably make my heart stop beating but I can handle that. I handled so many things."
“Things have become more complicated than I first presumed,” Harry started with a look of concern that puzzled me.
“...and Drake told me you saw us kissing. That guy you saw with me wasn’t him. It was a friend of mine disguised of Draco. He drank a Polyjuice potion. I’m so sorry!”
“Let Harry go home. Then you can take him to the police station and he will explain all you need to know. Come on, man! We’re friends! We fought together! You can’t do this to him. Harry saved your life!”
“I don’t think we’ll find Seamus or Lee in Flint’s house,” Draco said. “He wouldn’t be that stupid.”
He wanted to tell everyone to leave him the hell alone, but he couldn’t. He had to save Draco first. Perhaps then he could pick up his family and vanish to a place where no one would ever hear about them again.
We were good friends. The silence between us was rather welcome. For an outsider, it might be strange. At first sight, we looked like a soulless couple, but it was not true at all. We just understood each other without prying too much in one another's businesses. We respected each other's boundaries. That was very important in a marriage.
Alright, I was guilty. But I really wanted to adopt the boys. The idea didn’t seem so frightening anymore. I liked them. Was it that unbelievable?
“Whoever it is, I won’t let him mess with my family,” Harry said, a determined look on his face. “This guy is still human, right? The Demon hasn’t taken his full form yet. If that’s true, then there’s a big chance of killing him and sending him to hell where he belongs.”
“NATHAN!” Harry called. Nathan looked at him, smiled, and ran towards him. Harry took his son in his arms and held him tightly. “Nathan! I was so worried.” Harry felt tears of relief in his eyes. “Are you ok, son? Are you hurt?”
“Stop! That’s Malfoy!” said a familiar voice. Even hidden in the shadows, I recognized the big broad-shouldered man as Gregory Goyle. I had neither seen nor heard of him in ages.
There was a moment of silence when all we hear were Porthos and Athos happy barking and Angel’s sweet laughter. The cool breeze rustled the tree leaves gently disturbing a flock of birds.
“No, it’s magic. And that, Malfoy, makes me wonder how exactly I can take you with me when you are in such a state. I do need you, but at what cost?”
Harry wasn’t afraid of dying, but he was terrified of what could happen to Draco and their baby if he didn’t rescue them in time.
Blue sparkles came out from its tip. Harry and I both opened our eyes widely. There really was some powerful energy flowing between us. I think Harry could feel it too because he instantly let it go, thus breaking our connection. Having my wand all to myself wasn’t the same. It was now just an ordinary wand. It wasn’t mine anymore, and I guess it would never be. It was pointless trying to make it mine again. It was like trying to ask for my heart back. I made a face. I was getting rather sentimental around Harry.
Harry sighed, deeply frustrated. “It’s not over yet, Draco. Not between us. It’ll never be over between us,” he stated before pulling out the door and letting a short witch enter with determinate steps inside his office.
“Hey, I’m right here!” Draco exclaimed, upset. “I can fight! But right now I want to find my family. I need to find Harry and Nathan!”
"I don’t think you remember what really happened, Draco. You jumped on me when the rat got closer to you."
Astoria looked at me as if I was a lost cause. There was a reasonable explanation for that. My wife hated violence. She didn’t want Scorpius to get in trouble. She was of the idea that Scorpius should report whatever was wrong to McGonagall instead of doing justice with his bare hands. I agreed with her, but what she couldn’t understand was that sometimes a boy had to learn how to defend himself on his own.
Despite feeling sick, I held myself in check. Mentioning Harry in a conversation wasn’t anything new, but with the way things were at the moment, I couldn’t help but wonder if there was more behind it. My father couldn’t possibly know about my feelings for Harry. He could, however, be quite aware of the Angel, Slytherin, and the fact that the Malfoy Manor had suddenly vanished from the map.
“Apart from the fact that you are pregnant?” Severus sneered. “Because you are, Draco. The potion never lies. It’s for real.”
Draco was blaming himself for the attack at the Ministry of Justice, Harry realised that now. That was why he looked so distressed and nervous ever since it had happened.
"I’m afraid that it’s worse than that, Harry." after a dramatic pause, Draco said, "It means that Saulus Fimcyl is Lucius Malfoy."
Astoria interrupted us a few minutes later and took him away to have tea with biscuits. I didn’t join them. I continued to play feeling thankful for my sudden peace of mind. How much I had changed in a few seconds. The piano was really magical, and it wasn’t even made by a wizard.
After all the commotion that Nathan had passed through the day, he felt very sleepy. He laid his head on his father’s shoulder with a big grin and closed his eyes, yawning quietly. Harry looked for Draco and was surprised when he didn’t find him.
Severus had explained everything that had happened with Draco in the delivery room: since any wand magic would have harmed Draco and the baby, Draco had to give birth the Muggle way. Severus told Harry how brave Draco had been when Dr Jules made the first incision for the Caesarean, and how Draco had downed pain potion after pain potion when Dr Jules needed to shift the baby to remove her safely.
“Well, yes.” Harry waved his hand, annoyed. “Just tell me when you want to act upon your clue and I’ll go with you.”
I nodded in a trance. That whole building was the worst nightmare for any criminal and ex-Death Eater. If my conclusions were right, those men and women were all Aurors, and that was their Headquarter. I finally realised why that was indeed the safest place to be, and why it would be a terrifying experience for me.
It took only five long minutes for the door to be open and the rounded and familiar figure of Vernon Dursley appeared in front of them.
“Nathan!” Draco exclaimed, surprised. He didn’t want Nathan to see him suffering. “What are you doing here?”
“I did fall in love once,” Nostrums cut him off with a deadly expression. “I just think it’s a silly emotion, and I’ll never understand it.”
“It was so long ago, Potter! I’ve learned my lesson well!” I said with a fit of anger I didn’t know I still possessed.
A hand slipped under the blanket and touched Draco's back slightly in a spot that he knew was Draco's weakness.
“Snape said that even though the delivery might be a little difficult, he thinks the baby and I will be fine.”
Harry entered the Mansion but didn’t put his wand away. He kept it in his hand just in case. Saulus led him through a large and long corridor until they arrived in a big room illuminated by thousands of candles. Harry watched the room amazed with the décor, but he soon forgot about it when he saw the little figure lying on the couch, humming a lullaby and playing with a tiny little ball that kept changing colours.
She went in first, followed by Harry. When he realised I wasn’t behind him, he turned to me with irritation.
Harry and Sirius couldn’t look at each other after that, and Sirius went back to his house to look for Nathan one more time. Remus went with him, but not before telling Harry that they would find Nat even if it killed them.
Harry only smiled, as usual. But Draco didn’t care this time. Harry was planning a surprise for him and he hoped that with the surprise came along a declaration of love.
“Really?” she crossed her arms, upset. “Then perhaps you should take him somewhere else, like the psychiatric ward!”
“It was the only one left!” Bob said brightly, stunning one of Nostrum’s minions. “Gotcha!” Bob’s eyes were shining in a strange way. “Boy, I missed this kind of action! Watch out, Draco! We still have a long way to go. Nostrums has many servants.”
Once she sat on her chair, she spilt, “One of the guys who was arrested talked. He confessed to being working for a group who believes in the return of Lord Voldemort. They are all lunatics, of course, because there’s no way Voldemort can be raised from the dead.”
“It might have slipped your mind but the Manor was once used by the Dark Lord himself as his headquarters.”
“Oi, guys! I swear we didn’t do anything!” Ron exclaimed, appearing next to them. “Your door just exploded! Hermione is trying to repair it as we speak.”
“Sorry, buddy. And I’m truly sorry, Draco. I really want you guys to be happy,” Ron said, giving Draco a clumsy hug. “I promise to behave as a perfect gentleman for the rest of the day.”
The surroundings were suddenly very quiet. Nathan seemed to be deep in thought; Harry was becoming more and more confused; and Nostrums just kept smiling bitterly, as if just suddenly realising something.
I would give anything to have the old Harry Potter back - the one who was distrustful and emotional and whose green eyes sparkled with fury in my direction. At least back then he acknowledged my existence. Nowadays he didn’t seem to care about my presence in the world at all.
"I bet I will." Draco smiled. "Since I’m not feeling a hundred percent yet, I think I’ll pass, with all due respect. But I’m touched, my Emerald. I really am." He got closer to Harry and kissed him good morning.
Brutus barked in response, actually staring at Harry the same way, both trying to mark their territory. Draco rolled his eyes and turned his back to the fridge to see if he could save their breakfast. He knew where Harry and Brutus mute challenge would lead. He was more than used to it by now. They would roll against the floor, play with each other a little and pretend to be fighting mercilessly. Harry then would pretend to be injured and Brutus would whine until Draco intervened giving him his favourite snack. Harry always allowed Brutus to win their fake fights. That was how he had won Brutus’ acceptance in Draco’s life. Kids.
But they were tired after all the action they had together and pretty soon their eyes closed-drooped as if they had a will of their own. Before they could surrender to a good night of sleep, the blond muttered, “I love you, Harry. I’ve always loved you and I always will.”
“That’s not the right question, Harry. The right question is: what will I do?” Draco grinned and opened the door. “Come in, Mr Malfoy. I dare you,” he joked.
I was a Malfoy. I wasn’t expecting The Ritz, but I had certain standards. He probably caught the disgust on my face before I could hide it because he sneered, ‘I know what you’re thinking, but never judge a book by its cover.’
“Oh, right! You’re Harry’s husband!” Bob smiled feebly. “Even though the circumstances are terrible, it’s nice to meet you. I’m really sorry for Harry. I had no idea how screwed up he was until he locked me here.”
With his eyes filled with tears, he drove home. His hands were shaking when he entered his apartment. He took a bottle of bourbon and fell down on the couch. He didn’t know how long he stayed there. He was trying hard not to cry but he couldn’t handle the pain and after a while he cried like a child. He had been “out of town” for one day and Draco had already cheated on him. He cried so much that when the night came he was feeling numb. It was then that he decided to never see Draco again.
So we finally had a name to go with her face. I didn’t find it prudent to ask for her last name. The boy was too young. I didn’t want to scare him away by asking too many questions.
Draco raised an eyebrow, thinking if he should laugh or not of the ridiculous scene. He wondered if he should just go and damn all of the warnings his mind was screaming at him. He heard Brutus barking like mad inside the house. He must have scented the strangers.
Harry entered a flower shop downtown and bought a dozen of red roses and a box of colourful pashmina scarves that he knew Draco would love. The scarves were part of a sexual fantasy Draco had told him about. Harry couldn’t wait to use them on him.
"He needed a lot of things!" Harry defended himself. "He needed clothes, furniture for his room, toys to play with, a toothbrush, some magical items so he can get used to magic... He loved the new broom they’ve released. It’s called Thunderstruck. It’s so beautiful, Draco. You should have seen it! And there was a model for kids at his age."
“Yeah, the jealousy is eating him alive. That’s good though. Seamus loves him a lot, and he will be miserable if Dean leaves him again. He deserves to find happiness after all he’s been through.”
After all, in spite of Harry’s speech telling him otherwise, Draco knew he was responsible for Lucius.
“And... we still don’t know who their leader is. I don’t think they know either. The only description we’ve got is that the fellow is tall. He wears a black cloak and a silver mask and that’s it. Lucius is still their number one suspect. No one seems to know where he is though and Saulus is playing his part very well. He gave the Daily Prophet a very long interview telling how he will make the party responsible for the Ministry of Justice’s attack pay dearly.”
Draco instantly pulled away. “That bastard! I knew it! He’s a filthy sneak! He didn’t just come here to accuse me but also to confess his feelings for you! I swear that in times like this I really wished I was the same Draco Malfoy! Bob wouldn’t last a day!”
“That family thing!” he pointed to the house. “The Weasleys, Sirius, Remus, Hermione and you, gathering around like a big happy family, drooling over Nathan, who will probably be treated like a grandson to them, and a nephew. I’m not complaining about that, please. Far from it! I think it’s wonderful. But I’m not used to it and I felt out of place. Like I didn’t belong in there. I never had a family. That’s the reason why the Weasleys had always scared me so much when I was younger. They still do, in a way. I don’t belong there and I’m sorry.”
Draco turned to face him. “You did! Actually, every time it’s the same sick game! You shout at me, then you ask for my forgiveness and then you tease me until I give up and we always end up having amazing sex. But not today! Today will be different! I’m on strike. You won’t lay a finger on me. It’s settled. Goodnight.”
I looked at Scorpius and gave him a warm smile for the first time that morning. My son relaxed a little bit. I felt even guiltier for making him worry so much. What a lousy father I was.
Harry’s day had been rather busy and unproductive. His former colleagues seemed rather distant and fearful. Every time he’d tried to talk to one of them, they’d invented stupid excuses not to listen to him. The only ones who did seem more reasonable were Horace and Bob.
“The sex was amazing, Harry. The sex is always amazing as a matter of fact. But it’s not enough. Not anymore at least,” Draco said, drained.
Draco woke up with a headache and a terrible hangover. He wasn’t complaining, though. Last night had been one of the best nights ever since Harry had come into his life.
Of course he was. He had bought a ring for him. He would ask Draco to move in with him and spend the rest of their lives together. What more Draco wanted? Then again, Draco didn’t know about any of those things. Harry had never had the chance to give him his presents.
There was a period of silent, and then it was broken by Harry's thunderous laugh. Draco felt deeply offended.
“Fear can be a good thing, Nathan. But you don’t have to be afraid of what’s coming,” Albus had said to him. “Love will protect you.”
“No, you don’t understand. I...” Harry bit his lower lips. “I’ve been attracted to you ever since our sixth year. I never felt this strong for anyone in my entire life. I cannot let you step out of my life now that we have a chance to work things out between us. If you’ve been in love with me for so long, how can you throw me out like this?”
“Hermione exaggerates things and you know it. I don’t like Fimcyl but I don’t think he is responsible for my imprisonment. I mean, I never met him before his election. Why would he have something against me?”
“That was the Valium talking! And I thought you had opened your eyes about Lucius’ real intentions!”
"I... you... Ron told me it wouldn’t be fair to make you come with me. You have your life here and your job and... I don’t know when I’ll be back."
Immediately after the conversation, Ron sent an owl to Harry and then went to Draco’s ice-cream parlour to let him know about it. They celebrated that small but significant victory with lemon vodka ice-cream, Draco’s latest creation. Of course, the ice-cream was for adults only. He wasn’t even sure if he would put it on the menu yet.
On his 22nd birthday, Hermione and Ron, his best friends in the world, realizing just how sad and miserable he was, decided to throw a party for him. They would distribute equal cards for couples and matching cards for those who weren’t a couple but were totally right for each other – in Hermione’s point of view – if only they gave a chance to themselves.
“That’s not… I mean…” he grunted. He didn’t know what to say. I was making him uncomfortable. Well, good. “Bloody hell, Malfoy! We are both adults, not teenagers. We are both married, with kids, and…”
He ran his mouth against my stomach. It became more and more difficult to speak coherently with him torturing me with his tongue. His mouth finally landed on my hard cock and I might have whimpered. I didn’t expect Harry to suck me. I also didn’t expect him to be the most skilful of men in that department, which he wasn’t to my relief. Being good at giving head would mean he had experienced it with other men, and I was selfish and jealous. I wanted to be the only man in Harry’s life. Though he wasn’t experienced, his enthusiasm and care were more than enough to make me dizzy and pleading for more.
‘I won’t give up no matter how many times you try convincing me otherwise. Astoria knows what I have to do. She understands.’
Draco glanced at one of the people he trusted the most and didn’t like the look on his face. Clearly, something had upset Severus Snape. The grimaces on his face were almost comical. Too bad he was too nervous to laugh at it.
Ron instantly wanted to go to Draco’s house and punch his face out, but Hermione took hold of him. She made Harry take a shower and change his clothes. Then she made a very strong pot of coffee and when he seemed better, she gave him a lecture.
“Do you really need to ask such a stupid question?” Lucius said, exasperated. “The prophecies with good and evil have always had something to do with you, Potter. Why would it be any different this time? The son of the lion will bring peace to the wizarding world… The lion was obviously you!”
Draco caught the thing unwillingly and in reflex, and when he saw the green and gold sock in his hand he let out a yelp of disgust and tossed it in Dobby's direction. The house-elf caught the sock with teary eyes.
‘Just give me a little more time to rest and I’ll be as good as new,’ I was the first to break the silence. ‘I promise. Besides, even if I go now, you know I will come back, Potter.’
Harry didn’t say a word. Harry never said anything when Draco declared his feelings for him. He only smiled and caressed Draco’s face tenderly. Draco felt tremendously insecure when Harry remained silent. He knew for sure Harry wanted him badly but he didn’t know if Harry loved him in the same way he loved Harry. This thought disturbed Draco a lot. But once Harry kissed him again, he forgot all of his doubts to drown in the delight that was Harry. They had spent a wild night together. It had been so intense that Draco was starting to think that the previous night was the way Harry had found to end their relationship. A beautiful souvenir before a sad kiss and a goodbye.
Hermione explained the whole thing to Draco, who was totally astonished. Afterwards, Draco’s memory started working furiously. Something about what she said rang a bell inside his head.
He tossed and turned on the couch, looking for a more comfortable position. He sighed. He was used to having Draco near him and he missed Draco's body and the way he talked in his sleep. Harry had always found that amusing and sometimes just annoying, but tonight he missed it. He missed feeling Draco's hands touching him.
“Good,” stated Harry, ready to leave. “I’ll see you later, Malfoy. Mrs Malfoy, thank you for everything.”
Almost right away, a little girl in a blue dress – that matched the exact colour of her eyes – appeared at the bottom of the stairs. She had the most innocent expression on her face. Her long silver-blonde hair was all messy as if she had been playing in the wind. At her back, her little hands were poorly concealing Harry’s wand.
“Well, good. Because Nathan doesn’t remember anything about that day. I asked him what his last memory was and he said he only remembers walking into your car after escaping from Saulus’ mansion. He has no recollection whatsoever of Nostrums, and I think it’s for the best. We could bring his memory back using magic, but I would never recommend such a thing for a five-year-old child. Just… let things come back naturally if they ever come back. He isn’t ready to deal with grown-up subjects yet. If you feel like he’s troubled about something, I can recommend a child’s therapist who is a friend of mine and has my total trust. But I don’t think you’ll need one. Nathan was a little confused and scared when he awoke, but he’s acting more relaxed now. He was even flirting with the medi-witches and nurses!”
“Can I take you now?” the stranger asked, cupping Harry’s face in his hands and kissing him, caressing Harry’s lips with the tip of his tongue.
One of the things he adored in their relationship was Harry’s sudden surprises. He thought Harry would be a little inhibited in bed but it was quite the contrary. On the outside Harry was serious and a little shy but on the inside, especially in the bedroom, he was rather passionate. Harry proved himself to have a very intricate personality and Draco loved him even more for that.
Hermione exchanged a worried look with Draco. They knew Harry would be in trouble for that moment of revenge and they were calculating the odds of getting Nathan and Harry out without further problems.
“Colin Creevey?” Draco shook his head. He couldn’t believe that. Colin worshipped Harry. He had always believed that Colin had a crush on Harry. He’d never hurt Harry unless the demon had done something to control him. After all, the demon called Colin a slave. Perhaps Colin didn’t even know what he was doing.
“Anyway,” Hermione began, “As Lucius is out of the picture at the moment, you’ll need a lawyer to assist you at the hearing, Harry. You should have thought about it before.”
Again, Dean had driven him away. Seam’s past was too much for him. All those men and the life he had... He just couldn’t bear it.
“Of course I would! The important thing in situations like this is to keep your head in place so you won’t regret it later.”
“I’m not saying that you do. But maybe it was another Weasley. Like Ginny, perhaps.” she knew Ron would be profoundly offended by the insinuation, but she had to ask. Ginny had been acting very weird ever since she had heard about Harry and Draco.
‘Everything! I bet you have a lover every country you go, Potter. You call her so intimately. She kisses you, and holds you like a lover… It’s… it’s…’
On Friday, Ron managed to get a meeting with the Minister of Justice, and he successfully convinced him that an investigation was necessary to learn the truth about what happened in the past to Harry and his son. It was settled that there would be a hearing of both sides on Wednesday and that Harry should be there with Nathan.
Harry stared at him aghast. He didn’t know why the conversation had turned in that direction all of a sudden. He should have known that Bob would throw out something like that on him just to make him pissed off. And what was the kiss for?
Harry refused to waste another second in acquiring his son. He couldn’t wait to see Nathan and take him in his arms. But he was also afraid that the Ministry – or whoever it was that had plotted against him all those years – would take Nathan away from him once more. He had to run if he wanted to stay with his son.
Calling him by his first name definitely got to him. Was I getting the signals right? Was he interested? And did it mean that we... Perhaps in the past... I couldn’t even think about it. Harry’s bloody mobile phone rang and interrupted us. I clenched my fists to try to stop my anger. I wanted to curse the damn gadget, explode it into tiny little pieces. It only got worse when I realised who was on the phone with him. Ginny Weasley.
He lay Harry on the bed and stripped in front of him. The vision of his slim naked body wearing only the silver mask took Harry’s breath away. He was having another hard on.
“I think I’ll take that shower with you if you don’t mind,” Harry whispered as they reached the bathroom.
“I still remember quite fondly of that dragon cub you tried to bring from Romania, though,” he pointed out.
“You don’t work here anymore, Mr Potter,” she pointed out again as if Harry didn’t know that already.
“Then he won’t be angry at you. I mean, Hermione knew I would probably faint if I went in the room while she was giving birth, so she told me to wait outside.”
"He asked me if he could blow a balloon, Ron. You see, I bought this painting and there's a kid playing in a yard with balloons and stuff. It's a wizarding painting so the kid talks and moves around. One of his balloons wilted."
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, I know the feeling. I’m glad everything is over, too.” Dean looked at Seamus with a warm expression.
I closed the door and leaned on it for a few minutes. I clenched my fists. What I needed was to get rid of my feelings for Potter, and fast, or I would end up dying of unrequited love, and how pathetic would that be?
“Of course he’s not jealous. He’s straight as an arrow!” Remus said bitterly. “But he can’t handle the fact that I’m not!”
Far from being offended by Harry’s comment, Neville laughed at it. His days as a clumsy and insecure kid were long forgotten. He was almost a medi-wizard now, with a lovely girlfriend and a big paycheck.
Harry almost smiled, or at least that was the impression I had. He closed the distance between us and sat next to me. I had to fight hard to remain indifferent.
The stranger kneeled down in front of him, carefully taking off Harry’s shoes, socks and trousers. Harry was now completely naked. The only thing left on was the red mask.
“Even so!” And then he felt the same unbearable pain in his belly again. “Never mind! Go faster!” he yelled. “Why didn’t Hermione tell me it would be like this?”
Nathan felt sleepy after spending so much energy, but he tried to stay awake. He smiled at Draco and said, “Everythin’ will be fine. She’s ok. I need to nap now.”
The noise was so loud I was surprised nobody appeared at once. I thought the Aurors’ Squad patrolled the Alley. I didn’t have time to make any more conjectures. I didn’t have time to wait for the arrival of the good guys. Maybe, if I were smart, I would just deliver them the boys and go straight home. Unfortunately, I was done with that kind of bad boy life for good. Before an Unforgivable curse could hit us, I quickly pulled the other boy to my side and as I held him and his brother I ran. As soon as I saw myself in an area free from anti-apparation spells apparated to the Manor with both clutched to me. I did my best not to waver and kill us all in the process. The last thing I noticed was Goyle and Travers swearing out loud and the little one hanging on to me for his dear life.
“Hi, mate. Sorry for getting here just now. Hermione couldn’t come, but she sends you and Draco her best. John has been keeping us busy… And Hermione can’t leave him alone no matter what. My mum and hers are helping us out, but you know how my mother gets when she starts to criticize Hermione’s mum… It’s hell!”
“Oh, but you didn’t say anything wrong, Harry. Only the truth. No harm done. Now, Ana told me there’s something wrong with Nathan. What is it? He seems all right to me.”
“Of course you’d have. You had Death Eaters chasing after you, and all you had to protect you and your baby brother was a wand that seemed to be doing more harm than good... Indeed, your chances were really good,” I said sarcastically.
Saulus appeared by Lucius’ side and smiled at Harry. “Please, Mr Potter. We’re not your enemies.” He made a gesture with his hand and the men surrounding Harry disappeared behind a large door. “Now, would you please come in? Your son is waiting for you quite impatiently.”
“But like I said,” Draco went on, “He didn’t do anything to me. I didn’t let him. And after I refused him, he stopped trying to have his way with me. I was very glad that he did. He looked just like you. It was very disturbing. Lucky for you I love you and I know your scent by heart. He couldn’t fool me because of that. But… Nostrums was really weird. I had the impression that he didn’t really care about conquering the wizarding world. I had the impression that he just wanted… I don’t know… recognition, perhaps? It seemed as if he was trying to prove that he was a very bad guy. He wanted to prove that to someone. And I also thought that he feared Nathan. I know it seems ridiculous, but that was what I thought. It was all so weird. I mean, why was he so worried about Nathan?”
“Could you take Nathan to your Mansion? He could stay there with you until we sort things out. I’m asking this because your Mansion in Greece it’s a very well-protected place thanks to your paranoia.”
“Malfoy, here’s the deal,” he said when he hung up the phone. “The boys can stay here until tomorrow. After that, they’ll be leaving with me. In the meantime, two of my men will stay here to protect them.”
An uncomfortable silence fell upon the room, cut off by Nathan’s yell of victory. A moment later, Ron appeared on the living room with his mouth hanging open, at loss for words.
Amazingly, I really did, not only because Harry was right to be as upset as he was, but also because his eyes looked as scary as they had been a long time ago in one of Hogwarts’s bathrooms where he’d almost killed me. Truth is, I had been afraid that my health would deteriorate and sabotage me. And ta-da! It really did.
Bastard. I smiled involuntarily. As if by some miracle, Harry smiled too. It was getting harder and harder to leave the room. I wasn’t sure of what was going on between us, but there was definitely something there, and I didn’t want it to end so soon.
It wasn’t a request nor a command but an urgent plea that Harry promptly agreed. They held hands all the way and passed through endless corridors. Harry was almost losing patience - that was how strong his desire for the other was - when they finally arrived in a big bedroom. The bed was covered in white and red petals of roses. The room was lightened by candles of different sizes and shapes.
Alfred grunted. He began to pace nervously with his arms crossed. I knew he was wondering whether he could trust me with his secrets.
Hermione’s face became so red with anger that Draco thought her head would explode, but she didn’t say anything. He didn’t understand why she became suddenly mute and agreed to go back to her work just like that, but Ron knew better. Ron knew that the moment they were alone at home, he would have to face a major discussion.
“Hey, hey! Where does she think she’s going with my brother?” the other boy shouted, and he ran toward my wife as if to strike her.
The day Seamus heard him say to him that he had finally conquered Harry’s heart, he congratulated Draco and told him to be happy. He sounded sincere. This was why Draco was having a hard time believing that Seamus was the one who had jeopardized his relationship with Harry.
Ron and Harry started to talk about what was going on at the Ministry and Draco instantly cut it out. He hated when Harry talked about the office. The conversation always seemed to lead to a guy named Bob Stevenson and Draco had a tremendous jealous streak when it came to him. Not that he had any motives to feel jealous. He didn't even know the guy and Harry didn't talk about Bob with second intentions. He was only a 'guy from work'. But somehow he had the feeling that he wouldn't like him if they met.
“This was a residence, believe it or not. It still is. From the outside, it doesn’t look so good, but wait until you see its interior. It’s unbelievable,” Bob said unemotionally. “Ernie really liked this place. Do you know Ernie?”
He explained to Harry how Lucius had gotten in touch with him and what they had talked about. He didn’t tell him about his pregnancy though. First things first, he thought to himself. A voice in his head called him a coward for not telling Harry immediately but he ignored it. He wasn’t a coward. He would tell Harry about it when he was ready.
“A beautiful mistake then. What do want you, Harry? Do you want to humiliate me? Is this the reason why you’re here? Because now you know a secret that I kept to myself all the years we were at school? Because now you know that all the hostility I had for you was just a façade? I bet you came here to tell me that you finally beat me for good. You had me. I’m still in love with you. You won. Now, get lost!” Draco tried to close the door but Harry put his feet between it and with all his strength he pushed the door open.
Harry noticed they were the same size and that the mysterious person was a man. He never felt attraction for another man before, except for one time - but he hated to think about it.
That night they went to bed earlier. Harry enlaced Draco’s waist and they cuddled against each other. Hearing Harry breathing was enough to calm down Draco, who slept a few minutes later. Harry watched him sleep for a long time thinking about how tired Draco had looked. He worried that Draco might be sick again and he promised himself he would talk to Neville first thing in the morning.
Harry put Nathan down and cupped his face. “You made me a promise. Don’t forget that!” Then he kissed the tip of Nathan’s nose, said goodbye to his friends and left.
I stood up to place a soft kiss on her forehead. Then I went to my private chamber. I knew what Astoria wanted, but I would never do it. I would never confess my feelings for Harry. Astoria had this romantic notion that everything would be finally settled and solved once I declared my undying love for him. Women could be so innocent.
Hi, if you are reading this for the first time, I have this story all planned all and completed, but in Portuguese. So I am slowly translating it to English. I am also taking my time to proofread it. So if you are reading it for a second time, you might notice some little changes here and there.
Harry sighed. “You know, it’s almost dawn. We should get some sleep. And you, more than ever, should get some rest! You’re pregnant now! Let’s leave Lucius and everything else for another time. Now let’s just rest and pretend that nothing is going on.”
“Horace,” Ron took his colleague by the arm and muttered in his ear, “You can’t take Harry in front of Nathan. Look at him! He’s only a child and he’s scared. He just met his dad and now he’ll have to see you taking him away! It’s not bloody fair and you know it.”
“Who are your parents?” I was trying not to sound like an inquisitor, but I guess I just wasn’t cut out for it.
Draco sighed. "We’re friends, Seam. Just good friends. You don’t love me. You love Dean. I know you’re just saying those things to forget about him, but you know that this is going nowhere. You’ve played this game before. You have to start facing your problems! Go talk to him or something!"
His words were magical and they almost made me melt. If Harry wanted to stay in the Manor, so be it. I was his.
“I need to be there, Elisabeth,” Harry said, emphasizing her name softly. “You know I’m the best men for the job.” Ron kicked him and he added, “And Ron, too, of course!”
Harry had already explained to him about witches and wizards but not all of it. That would take a while.
Harry nodded. “Of course. I’ll be back in a minute.” He walked towards the door and then turned around with suspicion. “You won’t try anything stupid like walking, will you? You know you can only walk if someone helps you and–”
“You can rest assured that I do not think that, Malfoy. But the fact is that we need all the help we can get. I didn’t come here just to ask for money. I’ve come because I don’t want to see another Voldemort being created.”
Once more, however, Harry surprised me. There was no anger in his stare or in his voice when he said, “She’s been known as Ginny Potter for quite some time, Malfoy. And if we could just leave her out of this for now, I would appreciate it. Besides, I don’t even know how to look at your wife, let alone mine.”
“Aren’t you a gentleman?” I said with a smirk. “How can I help you? It’s a little late for social visits.”
“He’s been missing for a week now,” Dean explained. “He used to go to my shop every day just to tease me, but this week he didn’t show up. It’s not like him to just vanish. I went to his apartment and he wasn’t there either. There was a pile of letters on the floor. I thought that maybe he had just given up on me and taken a vacation or something. So I thought you knew where he was.”
It hurt more than I thought it would. I felt my heart sink. I didn’t want Harry looking at me with such hatred. Not anymore. I was so tired of that stupid game.
“I don’t know the exact words of this prophecy and neither does Alfred. But The Almighty thinks it has something to do with Angel. The prophecy speaks of a child with extraordinary power, the kind of power found only in dark wizards. According to some, Angel is only a recipient. Until he’s 12, his soul is inclined to... possessions. But the magic behind it is way too dangerous. When Alfred heard what they planned to do with his brother, he ran away. He believes Angel will be used in a ritual to bring Voldemort back.”
“You know,” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. “I have a kitchen trauma. Aunt Petunia used to make me cook breakfast for the entire family! I just loathe kitchens since then. I obliviated myself so I wouldn’t cook ever again.”
At the sports page, Ginny Weasley was queen. Damn her and her pertinent comments about Quidditch. I hate to admit it, but she was really good.
“Yes, as a matter of fact.” Harry took out a long parchment from his pocket and showed it to Draco. “I made this while Dr Jules was examining you. Neville actually helped me. He told me all the juices I should make you with some exotic, but very tasty and healthy, fruits. He also gave me the address to a personal trainer witch who will help you with your light exercises.”
My first week without Scorpius went by slowly. My mother wrote to me from France, her new home for seven years now. Father was all right. He had been going to a lot of museums and cafés, which was bizarre, to say the least. Mother spent her afternoons drinking tea with her French friends – and what surprised me the most was that some of them were Muggles. She sent Scorpius her best and hoped to see us at Christmas.
‘Listen, I’ve told you Lucius is being watched. And if it makes you feel any better, I don’t believe he is part of The Almighty.’
“Yeah, all right,” Harry said giving up. He kissed Nathan’s forehead. “I’ll be right back, sweetie.”
I should have let Harry convince Alfred to be taken to his Institution. What was thinking? I was sick. I was in no condition of getting myself involved in any of that mess. Even so, I just stayed quiet. I was going insane.
He sighed and went after Ron. He shouldn’t have blamed Ron for Draco’s disappearance but to expect him to act rationally in a situation like that was asking a little too much. Draco wasn’t innocent but that didn’t mean he couldn’t get himself into trouble. The problem with Draco was that he was too stubborn for his own good and thought he was invincible. Of course, Harry was worried. And he wouldn’t stop worrying until Draco entered the front door. But it wasn’t Ron’s fault and Harry shouldn’t have yelled at him.
That small little question was the proof Draco needed to confirm his suspicions. Until that moment he wasn’t so sure of Seamus’ guilt, because there were many blond, tall and tan guys in London. The difference was that this particular blond had been his boyfriend only six months ago.
She apparated before Ron could do anything about it. He cursed and Draco put a hand on his shoulder.
It was hard to understand what was going on. Harry was very confused about everything. Colin was dead; he was talking to someone who looked exactly like himself and on top of it all Nathan had shown up out of nowhere. He was still trying to make sense of the world. His friends and colleagues from the Ministry were very close to him and yet he couldn’t reach them. A battle between the Aurors and Nostrums’ servants was taking place a few steps away from him, but it was as if he, Nathan and Nostrums were invisible.
Harry laughed and after a moment he caressed Draco’s erection. It was then that Draco’s attention caught on a piece of paper signed by Saulus Fimcyl.
"Are you sure? With what evidence, Draco? Nathan is the only one who can see through the spell on the parchment and he doesn’t even know how to read! Saulus’ physical appearance is very different from your father’s. No one could ever say that they’re the same person. If they are the same person that is. Maybe your father just used Saulus’ name in the past without his knowledge. That’s possible," Harry suggested.
Even though they were sweaty and satiated, they didn’t let go of each other. Harry and Draco kept their tight hug for a very long time, needing to feel loved. Draco relaxed so much that he was soon sleepy. He leaned his head against the curve of Harry’s neck and cuddled him. Then he sighed, content, and closed his eyes.
‘No way in hell? How do you expect to continue, Malfoy? You just fainted. You’ve been unconscious all day! I had to call a Healer to see you because I didn’t know what to do!’
There was a pause. I could see him struggling with himself. He wanted to tell me, but he was also afraid. I knew Alfred didn’t have anyone he could trust. He was quick to defend the leader of the Death Gang, but why hadn’t he stayed with him, hidden under his wings? Or had he escaped to protect those he called friends?
“Who said I was punishing myself?” I retorted hoarsely. “It’s just music. Music is good for the soul, isn’t it?”
"I’m getting better. The loss of my son is something I’ll never forget, but I have to move on, and I want you to help me with that. You already have, you know? When we met at the Ball I knew you would help me find happiness again, and you did."
Draco couldn’t even think of that. He would never kill his son. And there was Harry. He hadn’t said anything to Harry yet. They had to talk first.
I wanted everything. I wanted him on top of me, in me. Fire burned my entire being. It consumed me. I no longer had control over myself. All that matter was that powerful sensation that I could fly.
Draco couldn’t really do anything but bear with it since it seemed that their little girl agreed with Harry’s constant concern. Every time Draco disobeyed one of Harry’s orders, he felt horrible cramps. He had never thought cramps could be so painful. He was feeling more sympathetic towards Hermione now.
Brutus barked again and ran to the bushes, barking to something hidden behind it. Harry pulled out his wand and ran after him. He dropped to his knees instantly when he saw Draco lying on the grass in a dead faint. It was like his world was crumbling down. He’d only felt that terrified when he’d seen his son just like that after the Ministry’s attack. He called himself stupid for leaving Draco alone, for not coming back sooner.
“I have no idea. But it’s obvious that they fought each other. Nathan is still weak because of that.”
Harry’s day had been rather busy. He hadn’t just spoken with Elisabeth but also with a few friends who worked at the Department of Mysteries close to the Unspeakables. In the end, Harry managed to be included on the list of the wizards’ squad team that would break into the Death Eaters’ hiding place.
Severus had also warned him about the mood swings he would have to face during pregnancy. He sighed.
“It’s Slytherin, Malfoy!” he dropped it like a bomb. “It’s the most horrible bastard that ever existed. It’s someone worse than Voldemort because Slytherin was a more sensible lunatic if that makes any sense. But of course, it will never happen. Besides, the Book of the Dead is nothing but a legend.”
“But seriously, Potter, why did you come here?” I insisted. I was being as brave as Mr Karl. How shocking!
Yeah, right. Of course it was! He was a dad. He was somebody’s dad. Nathan had accepted him in his life as his second father. Could he be any happier? His silver-blue eyes shone with unshed tears and he was so immersed in his own thoughts that he didn’t notice Ginny and Nathan staring at him with a worried expression.
“I think he knows something, Harry. Yesterday I followed him to his apartment, and guess what; he went to Colin Creevey’s instead.”
"As a matter of fact, yes, I have. Draco and I have discussed. I was thinking about going to the orphanage for the kids who lost their parents in the war... I lost a son, they lost their parents. I think we may find some comfort with each other," he smiled weakly.
"You never were a morning person, but when you start sleeping till this hour, something isn’t right. What is it, Seam? Problems in paradise again? Is Dean being the usual prick for a change?" Draco asked.
I wanted Harry back, even if for a few seconds. I needed him like I needed oxygen, if not more, for without Harry around it hurt to breathe.
We looked at each other trying to read our minds. What were my eyes showing him? I could see the struggle in his and also a hint of desire. Was I going crazy?
“I was only joking,” he said, grinning at Draco’s offended face. “Hagrid sent me a golden key that was found among Dumbledore’s stuff, and it was addressed to me. It’s a key to one of the Gringotts vaults. I wonder what’s in there. What do you think?”
Harry wasn’t used to Draco picking fights with him or losing his patience easily.  That was usually his doing.
The big auditorium of the Junian Manor was crowded. On the stage, Matilda Junian asked for silence. Then she started with the same old rigmarole. Her words sounded a bit cynical when she introduced Harry, and I wondered if he noticed anything. What was he thinking when he accepted to get into the snake’s lair?
Harry’s eyes were covered with the pashmina and he couldn’t see anything. He was now in the hands of Draco’s caprices and although he was feeling anxious, he loved every minute of it.
Draco shook his head in disbelief. There was a possibility that Bob was going insane, being locked up in that awful place for so long. There was no way someone in his right mind could be so light-headed in a situation like that.
“He means exactly what you’re thinking,” Nostrums said with a smirk. “The baby Draco is expecting is the Lily we’re talking about. I would say you’re a lucky fellow for having such special kids, Potter, but really... Lily was a real bitch. She was impossible to live with. So annoying... She even surpasses you, little freak.”
I frowned. ‘I don’t think I look that different. But I do know that the silver-blond hair calls too much attention.’
Ron had caught George sneaking out of their house once to go after Marcus Flint. The owner of The Death Pub had guaranteed that Fred and Draco had been to Flint’s apartment, but Flint was nowhere to be found.
Saulus had finally told him why he and Lucius were so interested in Nostrums. It was all because of The Corona of Power, an ancient device that could bring its owner infinite power. Since Nostrums had already taken the object, Saulus and Lucius didn’t have any other choice but to tell Harry about it, because according to them Harry was the only one who could get it back.
I got into the room fuming and wanting to break things. Harry was playing games with my libido and I didn’t like it one bit.
I slowly descended to where Harry was as if that would somehow relieve me from my suffering. I walked through a long corridor on my right and went to the main living room. As I opened the door, I saw Harry standing against the fireplace. He was alone. His emerald green-eyes turned to me right away. My body turned to jelly. My sickness got worse. The problem now wasn’t just because I was panicking, but also because Harry was right there.
To my surprise, he didn’t question my reasons as the others had done so before him. He just took a mobile phone from his pocket and dialled Harry’s number. After a brief talk, he handed me the phone.
‘And can you really take me with you on such a long trip? I mean, can you really do that? I don’t want to disintegrate along the way…’
He started his tale with such a soft voice that I had to make a huge effort to listen to it. What I did hear kept me paralysed for a really long time. I didn’t interrupt him once. I just let him share his darkest fears with me. At first, it was hard to believe that such a thing was happening. I wanted desperately to escape from reality. However, when he reached the end of his story, I knew he was speaking the truth and that I’d have to face it.
“You don’t seem to be in any condition to take a potion as strong as the Truth Serum anyway,” he pointed out.
“Of course I believe you. You’d never killed anyone unless you had a good reason, Harry. I know that for sure. You could never do something cruel. Ever. You’re the fairest and gentle person I know. In spite of the fact that you have infringed some rules in your life, you’ve never broken the main rules of the Aurors’ Code.”
I stared at it as if I was holding a dungbomb. I respected Muggle technology, but I wanted nothing to do with it. I had allowed one of those big TVs in the house, and the best laptop money could buy for Scorpius to take with him to Hogwarts. I didn’t want my son to be left behind by the new world. I was still too old-fashioned, though. I didn’t mind being left behind.
“Well, someone saw him in Manchester, so I sent two of my men to check it out. There’s someone that has been eager to see you, but I’ve been avoiding him...”
It was hard to tell what was going through Astoria’s mind. It was even harder to imagine what was in Harry’s head when he bid me goodnight; and if he thought it very strange that my wife and I didn’t share the same room.
“Ah, but what an interesting choice of words, Potter. So you are torn between finding me devilishly handsome or just plain sexy,” I provoked him not knowing where I’d gotten the nerve to do it.
“Can’t we just forget about this for tonight? Please? I’m tired. I’ve spent almost the entire day in prison and I want my bed.”
"All right, Draco. We’ll help you," Lucius said against his will. "I don’t actually have time for this, but what the hell!"
Draco tried as hard as he could to locate Lucius again but all of his attempts were unsuccessful. It seemed as if his father had vanished from the face of the earth. He should have known that Lucius would wait for the dust to settle before coming back. Still, he hoped that Saulus would give him an elucidation to the case, but so far he hadn’t heard a word from him.
“Er... Thanks,” Harry said, not quite sure of what to say. “But I don’t think Draco will hurt me, Bob. He has nothing to do with his father.”
“Dr. Jules didn’t say anything about this. In fact, Harry, I think I’m going to stick to his list. Except perhaps for the bubble baths and the food list that seems very interesting.” Then Draco frowned. “A Lamaze Breathing course, Harry?”
“Expelliarmus!” I shouted before he could finish. Blame it on the Slytherin that still lived inside of me.
It was almost 11:00 when they arrived at Kings Cross Station. They passed through the walls of Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, panting. Sirius and Remus were already there. Sirius gave Nathan a tight hug and a top-of-the-line broomstick. Nathan thanked him but told Sirius not to keep his hopes high. Nathan liked Quidditch, but he wasn’t a good player. Sometimes he wondered if Harry would be disappointed with him if he didn’t join the Quidditch team, but he never voiced his doubts.
“He’s too small to flirt,” Harry said with a grin. Even though he was a little worried he was also feeling extremely relieved. He turned to Draco and pretended to pout. “It’s all your fault. If you hadn’t flirted with them…”
“Well, Draco trusts him. And Snape helped him give birth to my daughter. Dr Jules wants me to go home because I can only see Draco tomorrow, but… I can’t just go home. I would keep thinking about Draco and Lily. So I’ll stay here. Could you take care of Nathan for me, Sirius?”
‘You know, I finally have a chance to redeem myself for all the wrong things I did in the past,’ I said. ‘Don’t take this way from me.’
“But of course they wouldn’t be welcomed here!” Mr Karl exclaimed in outrage. He was really being brave.
Draco didn’t even have to call the dog. Brutus was already following them to the kitchen. Draco sat Nathan down in a chair with Brutus watching him as a true guardian and went to make the hot chocolate. He could use some to himself, too.
“I’m going to my Headquarters,” Horace said. “I’ll be in touch, Harry.” After saying goodbye to everyone in the room, Horace left.
After reading this Draco knew that had Fudge not been dead he would have killed him, and he suspected that Harry would want to kill him, too. What a monster! He had taken Nathan away from Harry to keep his position intact and he had made Harry believe that Voldemort had killed his son. How could he do that to him?
Ron touched Harry’s shoulder. “If Hermione had done the same thing, I would be mad, too. But try to remain calm, all right? Talk to Draco in a civilised manner. You don’t know what happened to him. It looks like he needs you, Harry.”
“I’ll handle Lily. Besides, a new life will also begin for her, so I don’t think she’ll remember the Corona.”
Horace came with his task force to take the prisoners away, and he told Harry a few things that he’d discovered about the new gathering of the Death Eaters.
Draco didn’t actually mean to do it – he never thought he’d have enough courage – but he had done it, and it was too late to go back. On top of the bedside table in his bedroom laid an empty glass, which minutes before had been full of milk mixed with a very powerful Sleeping Draught. Draco had thought carefully about that desperate measure all day, and in the end, he’d decided that he just had to do it. He had to drug Harry in order to go after Seamus because Harry would never allow him to go.
“He did. But that wasn’t his main goal, Potter. Fudge was very ambitious. He couldn’t bear to think that soon he would lose his position as Ministry for Magic. And the members of the council weren’t too far behind,” Lucius explained.
“I could finish you off blindfolded!” Nostrums boasted, even though he still couldn’t move. “I only let myself be in this situation because... because... Well... My relationship with this stupid... kid or whatever... is very complicated. I let myself get carried away by memories of the past...”
"Never mind what I know. What about Harry? You’ve been trying to arrest him ever since your lover got into the position of Minister of Magic!" Draco accused. "The order for his imprisonment came from the top, I heard it myself! And who’s at the top but you? You hate Harry."
Harry felt a pang in his heart. His eyes flickered. It was almost like he had waited for that moment with Harry his entire life. Harry was feeling the same way.
He asked himself if he should enter the bedroom or just go back to the couch, although he had the impression that Brutus was already there. He opened up the door very carefully, not wanting to wake up Draco if he wasn't asleep, and tiptoed in the direction of the bed.
“Oh, no, you won’t,” Draco managed to say while he tried to remove from his mind the devastating outcome of Harry’s kiss. “You won’t answer the door dressed only in this towel. I’ll go and you help Nathan.”
Demon Harry smirked. “Lee is very good at breaking codes. The Corona of Power has some tough ones. The symbols are hard to decipher, so Lee is here for this purpose. As for Finnegan, poor thing, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was in Lee’s apartment when my men got there.”
Harry shivered of anticipation and excitement. Instantly, his hearing and sense of smell were activated and he could feel Draco moving around him as much as he could sense the delicious perfume Draco was wearing. He felt Draco running his hands along his robes and taking it off. Harry was now completely naked. He couldn’t see, but he knew Draco had taken off his own robe as well. The next moment, Draco’s body almost touched Harry’s and the heat of their bodies passed through them.
“Oh, Harry, you’re being unfair,” Hermione replied. “It wasn’t Sirius’ fault! How could he imagine that Nathan would want to get out on his own? Even Saulus wouldn’t be able to predict that. Your son is just like you, Harry. I can’t believe you aren’t talking to Sirius yet!”
Some of the people who were listening behind the door gasped. One of them didn’t waste time in telling everyone in the office that Harry Potter, the respectable Auror, was dating a Death Eater. A gossip started to spread through the corridors. Harry Potter was gay and if that news wasn’t shocking enough, he was also shagging Draco Malfoy.
“Ron, please! Let’s not discuss something that has only a remote possibility of taking place. Of course I trust you, which is why I know you wouldn’t do anything like that. If you were having an affair, I would know at a glance. You can’t hide things from me.”
“I’m losing my patience, Malfoy,” he gently warned me. I could see the fierceness in his eyes, though.
“Whatever, Potter.” Lucius shrugged. “What matters was that Cho Chang’s medi-wizard discovered that her son was a Mage, and that was enough for us. Mages are rare in this world, and only a Mage can bring peace to anything! One part of the prophecy was true, then, but what about the other? We worried, of course. We were already trying to kill Voldemort because he was becoming way too much of a lunatic, so we didn’t want to deal with another madman … We did what we thought was right. We tried to make Nathan strong.”
“Hey! I was hurt, all right? In fact, I still am! Just because I never said out loud that I loved him, it doesn’t excuse his treachery! Of course I love him! How can he doubt that?”
He stared at Bob trying to figure him out and saw only sincerity in his eyes. He sighed. Bob was just a guy in love. He had never done anything to Harry except helping him when the situation looked pretty bad. He didn’t look like the type of guy who would hurt a fly.
When we were finally inside the room, I told them what to look for. We started our arduous task: separating any books or correspondences which mentioned the Book of the Dead. I spent practically the whole afternoon reading old yellowish letters. All of them were very interesting. Some were even dangerous. A book tried to bite one of the house-elves and it took me some time to calm down the poor creature. Another one screamed so loudly that one of the Aurors showed up at the library immediately with his wand ready. I sighed and then I ordered Swan to undo any misunderstandings.
‘This is not a spy movie. Don’t let your imagination fly that high, Malfoy. I would never use sex as a weapon. Who do you take me for? I’m very good at what I do. I don’t need to resort to this sort of thing to get the information I want. Besides, we’ve had this conversation before. Now is really not the time.’
“What I have to say won’t take too long.” Bob paused, looked around and then whispered close to Harry’s ear. “Someone tipped me about Lucius’ hideout. I didn’t want to warn anyone about it because I want to be sure that the place is the right one.”
The conversation was starting to get dangerous. Draco knew exactly where that was going to lead. Seamus would start remembering the old days and then he’d start to get closer and closer to Draco on the couch until a point where he would be all over him. Draco couldn’t allow that to happen.
Alright, he had a point. I was Draco Malfoy, ex-Death-Eater, son of one as well, and my only concern had been to cover my own arse. But that was in the past. So many years had gone by since I’d made all the wrong choices... Didn’t he notice that this room was different from the other one? I’d closed down the former main living room of the Manor forever. So many people had been tortured and killed in there that I couldn’t stand getting near it. Harry didn’t seem to realise that.
“Oh, cheer up, Harry!” Sirius said, giving him a cigar. “You’ll see him soon enough! Just look at the miracle you and Draco created. She’s going to give you such a headache! I can almost picture her when she grows up. A beauty as dangerous as a Veela.”
I put the mail back on the silver tray and took a sip of my tea. I wasn’t hungry, which was completely normal. I rarely felt hungry. Astoria usually made sure I ate something under her watchful eyes. She always said I looked too thin and weak. My once shiny silky hair was now so dull it drove me insane. I was also becoming paler if that was even possible. I hated to look at myself in the mirror and face that fragile being that was once so proud and handsome. I had to remind myself every day that I had to be strong and withstand everything for Scorpius. My life basically revolved around my son.
I made a face. The illusion that he cared for me was shattered. He could at least try not to be so rude with his host, or better yet, his key. I sighed audibly.
I closed my eyes. I hadn’t trusted Harry, but I had wanted to. Now he had me wrapped around his finger.
"So Santa has heard my prayers and sent me my princess at last!" exclaimed Harry in a cheerful mood.
It was only then that I realised I was shirtless. I felt like covering myself like some medieval damsel.
“I wish I knew, Harry, but I don’t. And I’m guessing that you don’t want me to tell anyone about it, right?”
As a skilful Seeker, he quickly tried to take away the letter from me. However, I’d been a Seeker as well. Perhaps I hadn’t been as good as Harry, but I've also had quick reflexes. I managed to move away from him. I wasn’t so quick to hide my flustered face and my heavy breathing when our bodies touched and our mouths got so close that for a moment I thought about leaning in and kissing him.
I woke up disoriented and with a slight headache. I went for a walk in the garden with my dogs. Angel came along, and he walked by my side in silence. His quietness both pleased me and let me uncomfortable. A child shouldn’t be that well-behaved, but Angel was. He was such a special child. Maybe he was to be the next Harry Potter.
And indeed, it was. Draco told Harry all about Lucius, Saulus and their relationship, which Harry had a hard time believing. Then he told him about Nathan and he had to hold Harry to prevent him from leaving the house at that exact moment to go after Lucius.
"Your godfather is a mad man! Besides, he’s not my favourite person at the moment, which reminds me... I need to call my mother to know how she’s doing. Anyway, Harry, when I was little, I had a broom and I almost broke my neck because I decided that I didn’t need supervision from anybody one day and went flying on my own. I fell and I was lucky that there was a house-elf passing by at the time. He slowed down my fall with magic and I suffered only scratches. What if Nathan decides to do the same thing?"
Saulus sighed. “All right, then. Now, we need to know who’s behind all this. We have an enemy in common that we know nothing about. Someone is gathering the Death Eaters again, and I bet this person is connected with Nostrums.”
“He’s right, mate. Trust me,” Ron said, pointing at Arielle and George, his two four-year-old twins. Arielle and George had red hair and the Weasleys’ temper. They also seemed to have a liking for pranks. No wonder their favourite uncles were Fred and George.
“Yes, go ahead, Black! Go ahead and make a fool of yourself,” Snape provoked him. “Do go on! And perhaps I can add a few spicy details about my relationship with Lupin, and you–”
“I don’t understand,” Bob said, coming out of the shadows was he’d been hiding. “We just arrested a bunch of Death Eaters.”
After the shower, feeling quite relaxed, Harry found Draco in the kitchen stroking Brutus’ ears and talking to him softly. At the table, there was a big meat sandwich and a glass of orange juice. Harry took a seat and devoured the meal in less than fifteen minutes.
“Nobody would ever believe that I’d bring them to my house, would they? Not Draco Malfoy, the coward,” I despised myself for my own bitter words. Unfortunately, they were true. “Besides, the Manor is very well-protected against unpleasant visitors.”
“Are you insane? Even if this is all real, even if the book isn’t just a work of fiction, you can barely stand, Malfoy!”
“It was a scandal when it came out,” Severus began to explain. “It all started in the 70s, when Algernon Beecher, a sci-wizard, created a potion that would be able to get his lover Anton pregnant. He kept it secret at first, and when Anton gave birth to a boy, he told everyone about it. What happened was that other couples started to do the same thing, and most of them didn’t have the right guidance. Algernon forgot to mention that Anton had almost died giving birth, and so at least 10 men died giving birth to their children. It was a mess of huge proportions. In the 80s, a law was created and men’s conceiving was allowed only with a license of a renowned medi-wizard and a sci-wizard. The numbers of deaths decreased severely after that but sometimes it still happens.”
And yet I still knew something he didn’t. I was certain Harry hadn’t known about Angel; otherwise, he wouldn’t have looked so taken aback.
I began to caress my stiffness, and Harry was there again, tempting me, showing me what I had been missing. I licked my lips and my eyes fluttered. I gave my imagination wings. Harry moaned with me while attacking my body with his mouth and tongue and fire. He bit my nipples and kissed me passionately.
Harry gently stroked his husband’s hard nipple and Draco moaned. He took Harry’s hand and brought it to his mouth where he licked his fingers one by one. Finally, he led Harry to the bed. Draco sat first and Harry sat on his lap facing him. With their legs curled around each other, Draco kissed Harry deeply, savouring every little inch of his red, cherry-like lips. Harry didn’t resist the urge to move his body back and forth but Draco shook his head in disapproval.
No, not really. But what did he expect? Listening to Harry Potter telling you he needed you was enough to leave anybody dazed and out of words.
They kissed as Draco lay down, bringing Harry on top of him. His hands frantically searched for the warmth beneath Harry’s shirt, and he felt like tearing it apart. There were too many clothes in their way. Their shirts were soon removed. Later on, Draco would find them very far away from the bed and wonder how they had ended up there. For the moment, though, he was only worried about being ravished by Harry.
“He was a spy,” Dean said, not wanting to let Horace know exactly what Seamus used to do for The Order.
Harry took a deep breath and agreed with him. He didn’t want to see Draco though. He was still trying to recover from their last fight. Not that it had been a real fight. As usual, he had been the one doing all the yelling. Draco was always the one who listened, the one who understood, even when he was right and Harry was wrong. That made things even worse for Harry. He was very ashamed of himself.
“I know. Besides, it’s not like the Ministry and I are in good relations with each other at the moment. In fact, I don’t really give a shit. Unless, of course, Lucius represents a threat to our family. Does he?”
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Harry shouted for the tenth time, walking back and forth on the living room of his house.
Harry clenched his fists. “You’re so pathetic. How can you say that? Did you call him that? Because if you did, I’ll jinx you so bad you won’t–”
So this time Astoria had sent Alfred to interrupt us. I wanted to give a big laugh. What was Astoria thinking? I should probably have a talk with her, but I lacked the courage to do so.
“Ron?” Harry called out to him. Ron didn’t look up. “I’m sorry. I’m going through a lot lately. It doesn’t excuse me or anything, just... Put things into perspective. I shouldn’t have snapped at you like that. You didn’t deserve it.”
It had been found by none other than a muggle, but the truly magical part had been stolen by a wizard who decided that the book was too dangerous to be shared with the world and therefore should be hidden forever. What the muggles had was historically interesting, but it had nothing that could tempt a wizard to steal it. The part worth stealing was long gone. And I had no idea where to begin looking for it.
Harry was so immersed in his own rage and pain that he barely notice the tears forming in Draco’s eyes.  All he wanted was to hurt Draco in the same way he had been hurt.
Not trusting his voice to speak, Harry just nodded. Draco’s eyes were shimmering in such an intense way that Harry had never seen before. He noticed that the silver-blue eyes almost seemed to have the same power as the Imperius curse, if not stronger. The sensation burned his skin and lifted him off the ground.
“What should we do? Go to the Ministry and report Seamus as missing?” Dean asked after a period of silence.
From a young age, little Malfoy had showed discontent towards everything around him. You see, he was a spoilt brat. His parents had always showered him with expensive gifts and his whims had been fulfilled at a simple click of his fingers. Nothing seemed to satisfy him.
Harry only shook his head. He got closer to Draco and stroked his face gently. Draco put up all of his effort to resist him.
I began to tell him my story. I told him about how I suspected Matilda Junian was up to something, and how I had gone to the Alley to gather some information about it. Then I narrated my fight with Goyle and the other two. Harry listened to everything without saying a word, aware of every detail in my tale.
Draco screamed some dirty words so he could tease Harry in the same way that Harry was teasing him. Their bodies were covered in sweat. Harry sped up the movement of his hips, rubbing Draco’s prostate and making him moan loudly. They came intensely, almost at the same time.
There was no sign of Nostrums anywhere. He had vanished without a trace. No one believed that a child like Nathan had driven such a powerful demon away, so Horace’s men were still looking for him, believing that Nostrums had only fled. Even though Nathan didn’t appear to be in danger from Nostrums’ possible interest, Harry made sure to stay beside Nathan the whole time he was in the magically-induced coma.
Harry noticed the sorrow in Draco’s voice, and how regretful he was for following his heart instead of doing the right thing in the past. Lucius had never been a good man or father, but still, he was family to Draco. Harry understood that. Perhaps Draco had good memories about Lucius, not just bad ones. Harry knew for sure that Lucius had taught Draco how to fly and every time Draco brought the subject up, he did it with a smile on his face.
“I went to my old department to talk to Elisabeth,” Harry began to explain. “Then I went to the Department of Mysteries and if that was not enough, I still had time to talk to Horace. It turns out that things are not as catastrophic as we thought they would be. There are a few remaining Death Eaters waiting for Voldemort’s miraculous resurrection, but we already know where their hiding place is. They will break into the place in two days and I’m going with them. Ron will be there, too. And yes, we will take care of each other. You don’t even have to ask, Draco, I mean, I’m... was... an Auror.”
"Don't be stupid, Weasley. I was only playing with Harry. We were provoking each other," said Draco with a naughty look.
“Oh, don’t worry!” She smiled at him. “Its head is strong. Unfortunately. It will survive, to my distress.” and then she changed the subject abruptly, “I’m making some strawberry and chocolate pancakes! Do you want some, dear?”
Draco paid attention to Dean’s body language and instantly realised that something was terribly wrong.
I felt less anxious. Astoria, on the other hand, remained restless. She knelt down to button up Scorpius’ heavy coat. I rolled my eyes but didn’t complain. Firstly, because we were in public. Secondly, because I was as protective as she was.
Draco smiled and added, “And he’s a carbon copy of Harry. The same hair, the same smile, the same personality...”
He was being serious and honest. That was a given. I could see myself reflected in his eyes. I swallowed hard. My heart was almost coming out of my mouth. His lips brushed mine as I tried hard not to let my eyes flutter like a blushing maiden. I waited for his lips on mine anxiously. The bloody bastard did not kiss me, though, just said ‘hold on tight’, and next thing I knew we had apparated to Egypt in the blink of an eye. I was unprepared and cursed him under my breath. I felt the world spin. I shut my eyes tightly and held Harry like he was a lifesaver. The day was extremely hot and bright. My body, which had been feeling the effects of the whole trip since day one, just collapsed in Harry’s arms.
Harry kissed Draco’s temple softly and caught Nathan in his arms. “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure Neville sees him. Draco… Do you want me to stay? I mean, I don’t want you to go through this alone, but…”
Harry, who sat on his favourite armchair, had his eyes lost somewhere else. He couldn’t believe that once again he was being accused of wanting to be the next Dark Lord. He had faced the same problem in the past when he had been fighting Voldemort. To face that all over again wasn’t easy. He should be used to it by now but the sad truth was that he wasn’t.
“That’s right, hypocritical! This Foundation of yours was created what? Twenty years ago? And only now you’ve decided to care for these particular children.”
“Maybe. Or maybe not. We don’t really know what your father’s plans are. That’s why I have to ask you this, son. Do you want to go along with this pregnancy? Because you don’t have to. We can end it right now. Whatever plans your father have will end here. What do you want to do? Do you want me to take it off?”
“Stupid Potter! Where are you when I need you?” he yelled. And then the pain ceased. He took a deep breath, relieved, and after a while walked slowly into the living room. He sat on the couch and leaned his head against it. He placed both hands on his belly. “All right, Lily. If today is the day you've chosen to be born, please wait for Harry to come back.”
Demon Harry made a gesture with his hands and two guards came to take Draco away. Draco didn’t pull up a fight. He couldn’t, for his baby’s sake. He let himself be taken, but he was surprised to see that his new prison wasn’t the cold cell in the dungeons, but a large bedroom that reminded him of his old bedroom in Malfoy Manor. He was left there, and for what seemed like hours, he looked for a way out, finding none.
"Why do you think? It was because I threatened Dursley. An Auror is not supposed to do that," Harry said with sarcasm. "I mean, Dursley is such a nice man and all. I was just mean and unfair to him."
Nathan felt sad for losing his new friend so soon, but Draco assured him that he could play with Brutus the next day.
Hermione went to the kitchen and Draco was left alone with Harry’s miniature. It was amazing how much Nathan looked just like Harry. The hair, the green eyes, the shy yet defensive attitude. Draco wondered if Nathan would also reject him and deny shaking his hand just like Harry had done it the first time they’ve met.
With his heart constricted, he and Hermione watched Harry and Ron apparating with the Hit Wizards. Bob vanished from their sight.
Harry opened his eyes wide at Draco’s outburst but didn’t say anything. Even though Dr Jules had warned about mood swings, most of the time Draco was just his normal self. It was only when Draco had cramps that he snapped at Harry. He scanned the room and viewed his cell phone a few steps away from him, lying with the rest of the stuff he had tossed on the floor when he had heard Draco cry for help. He tried to get up, but Draco was still holding his hand firmly. “Draco, sweetie, could you let go of my hand?”
My father’s words haunted me for the rest of the day. I wondered if he was part of The Almighty. Hadn’t he implied as such? He and my mother were still members of Matilda’s club even if they weren’t active participants. The Malfoys had always been part of the crème de la crème of our society. Being in France, they most likely received the Club’s new by owl-post. It wouldn’t be a surprise if Lucius was actually a member of The Almighty.
“But we did! Honestly, Harry, we were scared that he would be just like you. You don’t know the things he can do! He’s always doing something abnormal and we have to keep him under control.”
Draco knew there wasn’t anything wrong with her. Hope was too smart to get hurt. She was, in fact, too smart for her age. She was just trying to escape Draco’s punishment. Like Draco could ever punish her for real. But he couldn’t let Hope know that he was as soft to her as Harry.
I sat on my bed finding it difficult to believe that some time ago I had been so close to Harry. I had spoken to him. I had felt his male scent. I had seen him smile. I closed my eyes. I didn’t want to think of anything else anymore. I didn’t want to think of my obsession with Harry. I also didn’t want to think of what I had seen inside Matilda’s mind. I hoped it didn’t mean anything. Yet, while I was sleeping, I had horrible nightmares with Death Eaters coming back and murdering Harry. I had to do something. I had to make sure the Death Eaters were a thing of the past. But how? My father? I doubted he was going to tell me anything. Lucius had forbidden any unpleasant conversation about the past. I stood up all sweaty. I went to the window and looked outside where the moon reigned alone.
“I need to speak with you privately,” I said with a drawling voice, pointing at the other two Aurors.
“Why did I listen to Harry?” Sirius berated himself. “He told me that my presence wasn’t necessary at the hearing today, that nothing would go wrong... Yeah, right. Look at this mess! Lots of injured people and my grandson in a Hospital bed.”
A little big before midnight, I heard a knock on the door. My heart skipped a beat as I listened to Harry’s voice. As soon as I unlocked it, he got in, looked at me for a few seconds and then went straight to the fridge.
“Draco, you know you shouldn’t drink,” she scolded softly. Only Astoria had the power to be forgiving even when she was angry.
I felt my heart getting lighter. I missed my boy so much. Perhaps I should visit him before going to Egypt. Then again, perhaps I should not. Scorpius was a very clever boy. He would suspect of something wrong if I just appeared at Hogwarts out of nowhere. Parents didn’t go to Hogwarts unless they had a very good reason for it.
As he turned it off, our eyes met. We were so stupid. The biggest one of all was me, of course. For a brief moment, I had actually believed that Harry wasn’t as indifferent to my feelings as I thought he was. And maybe, just maybe, I wasn’t all alone in my unhealthy obsession.
"Really? So you just lent your name to him so he could send hidden messages to Death Eaters. But you’re an innocent man, I’m sure of that,” Draco sneered. “Innocent enough to become the new Minister of Magic. All those rumours about you buying your way in were probably just gossip from resentful people who just happen to dislike you for no reason at all," Draco mocked. "You’re not the man you claim to be. Saulus Fimcyl is a name invented by my father to misguide the Aurors. Come on, don’t insult my intelligence. Why don’t you just admit it so we can move on to other issues?"
Draco would have found the whole scene quite amusing if he wasn’t feeling suddenly very indisposed. His stomach was jolting like crazy and he was feeling weaker at each tick of the clock. He took advantage of the fact that Harry was busy trying to fix things with his boss while putting his clothes on, and he went out of Harry’s office with catlike footsteps. Unfortunately, Harry glanced at him that exact moment and gripped his arm.
He lost track of time sitting all alone in the darkroom, staring on, thinking about painful ways of torturing his father-in-law.
"Not now." Harry looked at Nathan, who was paying extreme attention to them. "I came here to take you both to lunch. Nat is hungry, even though when I arrived here, he had his mouth full of chocolate ice-cream."
“Excuse me,” he said for a waitress who was passing by. “May I ask you if a blond, tall guy with a very peculiar eye colour - a mix of blue and grey - works here?”
Harry felt his anger increasing and he shouted the first hex that came out of his mouth. A bright light got out of his wand and suspended Dursley upside down. Hermione, the voice of reason, asked for Harry to put him down or else he would be in trouble at the Ministry. Harry didn’t seem to care though. He let the pathetic man hang in the air for quite a while. After a few moments of pleasure, he put Dursley down.
