Ron insisted, in a tone less annoyed than the one he had recently gotten used to take. Maybe Hermione's scolding had finally gotten to him.
Everything was simpler when he was young and thought the world was either black or white. But now, everything became too complicated.
His body felt bruised as he painfully stood up. It was night again, but everything seemed oddly clear. He could see the horizon far away, the hills around. Maybe it was only evening then... But the stars were shining too bright for it. It was like hours had melted into one, into a time that isn't supposed to exist.
As he moved forward, he eventually came upon a crossroad. He could still continue straight forward, or turn left or right. Three choices, and he had no idea which one was the good one.
Stunned, his eyes were wide towards the cigarette then head to toe on Harry, like it had turned into a weapon somehow. The most dangerous and hideous thing on the planet. And the fact that the Gryffindor was willingly smoking that thing, seeming so unbothered by it, was a mystery that left him dumbfounded. It was obviously deadly. And he was right on that, but Harry had no care for his health, since he had none for his life.
He bluntly asked, pointing Malfoy's arm with his chin. It was the blond's turn to frown.
He didn't even know why he admitted it, but he spat out his confession with a contempt tone. Offering his honesty reluctantly but with the hope that it would be enough to silence the curious blond.
Harry answered, biting his lip nervously. He could at least give him that. But he knew revenge could take other forms than death. And he couldn't exclude those options yet.
They were talking about him, and it made the boy already bitter, to hear his former best friend say such thing. And seeing them argue over him, when he had asked the girl not to. Even away, it seems he was still a problem. But he couldn't interfere. Revealing himself now would betray his habit of leaving the dorm under his cloak, but even so, he didn't have the strength to fight with the Weasley again. So he just stood there, listening. Because even if he knew it would hurt him, he couldn't help himself but to be curious.
The memorial looked heavy, and the black haired boy instantly felt like it was crushing him. Mouth dry, he was trying hard not to let his body shake in front of the Slytherin. Focusing so his green eyes wouldn't get watery. But he couldn't hide his discomfort very well, his muscles were stiff and his breath stayed on hold. His eyes were caressing the glowing names in a disarray. So many, too many, names. He could feel the knot in his throat, so tight. In his head he was facing a turmoil of emotions, all too strong but he didn't want to let any of them out in front of Malfoy. He kept it in. Shivering but fighting the urge to drop on his knees to cry. It was stupid though, why did he even care about keeping the last of his dignity in front of the blond ? He shouldn't. Because he didn't matter... If they were neither enemies nor friends, it then meant they were now nothing to each other. Right ? So he shouldn’t bother about saving appearances and fearing to be judge by him because, anyway, the Slytherin had lost his power here, and with it, the use of dirty information on Harry. Which he would have used in the past to mock him, spread the word to destroy his reputation.
Even like this, with that determined look on her face, she still appeared profoundly kind. Her eyes not lying, she was staring at him with a deep fondness he couldn't ignore.
Malfoy laughed then stayed silent. Taking his book back, he opened it where he had marked the page and got back to his reading. Harry took his want out of his pocket and pointed it at the fireplace to start a fire. Watching the flames grow, he let them capture his gaze. Feeling hypnotized by their dance. It was warm and soothing. The crackling of wood had a strange healing effect on him, it had something homey in it. He brought his leg back up on the sofa and leaned. Like this, he could almost fall asleep. Listening again to the pages being turned, to slow breathing filling up the room. So quiet and peaceful.
Harry,”
Draco didn’t know why he allowed these sort of things to keep happening. He knew it was ridiculous. He knew he should not be sneaking into the Gryffindor boys’ dormitories. He knew he should not be meeting up with someone in a room that he shares with four other people. He knew he really should not already be semi-hard anticipating said meet up. Basically, Draco was once again ignoring all of his instincts for Harry Potter.
“Not a single soul,” Harry leant in so his forehead was against the other’s, feeling the need to be as close to him as possible, indulge in him as much as possible.
With guilt he bit his lip, averting the gaze of the Gryffindor with an obvious shame after that confession. But Harry dropped his eyes on the floor too anyway, too troubled. Processing his words, understanding again a bit better what he never allowed himself to see. The trap around Malfoy. His struggles... He would have never thought he would one day feel pity for him, thinking of how hard it must have been. But here he was, compassionate and sorry to hear him confess his weakness. Almost glad the blond actually did nothing, because he would have been doomed to fail. End up dead. Probably unaware that Harry had to die in order to truly kill the dark lord. The boy who lived, only to die better... Fucking hell. Harry was wondering why he cared about the boy living. But then again, he actually already knew somehow. He strangely never wished him dead, despite everything he ever did to him, that's why he saved him last year... He remembered how instinct took over feelings when he witnessed him near his end. He just couldn't leave him to burn.
. He wanted to turn back, his heart was beating too fast from the attention... He glared at her with resentment because she should know better by now than to carelessly expose him like this, she was sitting near the front, next to Ron who was giving him a cold face. Eyes black with anger, clearly still mad about their altercation. The girl was waving, inviting him to join them and to take the free chair just next to hers. But Harry didn't want to be near the redhead right now. He too was still bitter from yesterday. Their friendship broke, and in his mind, there was no going back. A thought that hurt him even if was the one who pushed him away. So slowly, he shook his head, turning his gaze away from the confused and sad look Hermione was now giving him. He scanned the rest of the classroom, trying to avoid every gaze, but too aware of all those eyes on him. It made him shiver, stomach compressing as if he was about to throw up. Eyes down he only focused on the desks and chairs, not even glancing above the shoulders lines he was seeing. He just wanted to find an empty spot. Finally finding some other empty chairs at the back, a desk where nobody was apparently sitting. Perfect. He walked towards it, sitting with nobody next to him either side. He didn't care if hiding in the back of the class made him look like a duffer, it was where he felt safer. No eyes in his back.
And he did as told without trying to protest again. Not knowing if he was just bending to satisfy Hermione, or if he was starting to actually consider the idea of going back. Give life a chance. Or at least, maybe try.
He stated. For now, loneliness was what he enjoyed the most. Nobody to look at him, talk to him. Bother him. Annoy him with fake smiles, or to tell him how to feel.
Harry finally asked, frowning and suspicious. Like a reflex, his hand had already slipped into the pocket of his sweatshirt to find the reassuring touch of his want. The steel eyes of his enemy seemed to have noticed, observing the pocket before going back to the emerald irises. His lips let out a bitter grin.
This was it, their breaking point. Harry knew it was bound to happen, it was only a matter of time. The redhead patience was getting weaker by the day. And Harry didn't have the strength to save it. It was easier to give up at this point.
The Gryffindor asked suspiciously and the Slytherin shrugged keeping his smile on.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Ron was trying to defend his cause. But his tone was lacking so much conviction it seemed like he was trying to persuade himself more than her.
Harry really wanted him to understand. He needed Ron to accept and move on. Because he would never be able to give him what he was asking for. And Harry couldn't deal with the pressure anymore.
Hey guys,
He sent then sighed. What the fuck was he doing ? Being all nice to him... Even just allowing anyone to keep him company.
Harry's throat suddenly felt tight, he opened his eyes to discover the platform whose sight used to warm his heart. Back then it was his favourite moment, the one where he was finally feeling home. Relieved to be back, to find haven. But now, the platform seemed to defy him, and he could feel his body shudder at its sight.
The confession seemed heavy on his heart. The feeling of him being nothing else but an enemy engraved deep in it, being so humble and offering this apology was still hard. But needed if he wanted to move forward with his life. He couldn't hold on to old grudges, live with hate. He was sick of all that fucking hate.
. As if it wasn't fucked up enough in his head...
Even thought people were clearly recognizing him, he still refused to expose his emaciated face. No longer knowing if he was really trying to just hide himself or simply hide the rest of the world trough his reduced vision. The hood only allowing him to see a sea of legs.
Harry needed this so much, to hear him simply comfort him instead of blaming him for his grim moods, to feel the pain being shared. More than he ever thought. This was the first time the two friends were collapsing together since the war. That Ron showed him something else than a pretended happiness. He had terribly missed the sincerity of his best friend. He felt relived thinking that, maybe, he finally understood now how much pretending had been ineffective on him. And for once, Harry wanted to believed it. Yes, everything would eventually be fine.
Malfoy asked at a loss, not really knowing how it worked. He was just looking confusingly at the thing held between his long and elegant fingers as if it was a puzzle. And it was almost endearing to see him so bewildered by a simple cigarette. The boy who always had so much assurance and would brag about being the best at everything suddenly looked like a lost kid in need of teaching. Truly vulnerable.
He whispered again, his voice hoarse.
He breathed, finally releasing Harry as he got up and turned again towards the window, body shaking a bit. Folding his left arm against his abdomen in a protective way. The Gryffindor sat with relief, patting his hoodie were the blond had held him, running a hand through his dishevelled hair. Which made no difference...
But there was no room left for compassion as he was only getting angrier. Rage had uncontrollably taken over everything inside him. It was nonsense to him. Malfoy had no right to feel guilty for those deaths. Because, coward or not, he never could have stopped Voldemort anyway. So there was no point, no reasons, for him to take the blame.
A soft voice rose, feminine. It had a typical dreamy and joyful tone. One that was impossible to mistake. He heard the girl now run to him, and as he looked up, with no surprise he found Luna facing him with a bright smile. He instantly felt his guts get tighter. Catch by one of the person he was particularly desperate to avoid. Too shameful to face. But now here he was, trapped in front of her. And he was feeling so small he couldn't even hold her gaze. Dropping his eyes to the floor once more. In so many ways he felt like he had wronged her. She and her dad had suffered because of him. That's why Harry couldn't hold a grudge against Xenophilius. He understood why he had done it, and he was taking the blame himself. Again, because of him people had to go through pain.
He sent to him. Wondering why he felt like he had to clarify things. Was he hoping to make him feel a bit better ? Fuck, why care ? Why try to keep up with this conversation he didn't even wanted to have ? He was not going to start talking to him just because they shook hands on sharing guilt.
Ron and Hermione were clearly bewildered by his lack of reaction, but they should have been used to it by now. Harry didn't seem to care about anything anymore. Not even the fact that they would now have to share dorm with Slytherins and especially with their rival.
He then mumbled shyly. And Harry held back any remarks he could have made on the pure blood opinion of muggles. Choosing only to see the progress and effort he had made in stopping himself. By doing so, showing that he now was aware of how wrong such statements were. Had grew.
Hermione's eyes were scary in the dim light of the common room. Rage pulsing in her neck. She too was offended and outraged by what she had just heard. Hurt even, to witness how bad and brutal the tear between the two men she loved was.
Please, let me know your thoughts in the comments. Do you think my writing is too confusing ? That I ramble too much ? Be honest with me, I want to improve :)
He had already stop believing. The faint glimmer of hope that Ron had offered him had already vanished. Because he couldn't see how, how he could get better when all these people were looking at him like he was a hero. How he could endure this feeling everyday, that of not deserving their admiration. That of being sorry for all the misery in the world.
Harry asked with an inquisitive tone, whishing more than anything that she could finally be honest with him and allow him to see her scars and pain.
He answered now composed. And a heavy silence fell on them as Harry was finding himself staring at the back of the blond's head, listening to his words again in his head. Letting himself slowly get calmer. Until he could feel the rage vanish as quickly as it came. Until he allowed himself to acknowledge how right he was.
Malfoy asked, looking at the Gryffindor with eyes shinning with hope.
Also, in a way, he was surprised to feel a bit of disappointment towards his friends. Acting so closed-minded, still hating on Slytherins just because they belong to the snake house. When actually, McGonagall was quite right. War should have taught them that hatred only brings misery. And that it's time to unite and stop labelling people as good or bad because of their house. Without even knowing them... A way of thinking that Harry didn't even realized had changed in him.
Reaching out to her, he grasped her hand in his and gave it a light thankful squeeze before letting go. It was brief but it was already so much for him, to be the one offering physical contact. She knew it and grinned widely.
He beseeched her. His heart already getting faster with the anxiety from the mere thought of them breaking up because of him. Thinking that his state of mind could be toxic to them was destroying the little self esteem he had left. He was nothing but poison, even now. Hating himself, a living burden and disappointment. Which was exactly why he was better alone. Nobody should have to endure him, the chosen one was nothing more than the bringer of misery.
He wrote a bit confused by the intensity of Malfoy's grey eyes.
I'm so sorry... I feel like this chapter is a bit shitty and confusing.
His smile widen softly, eyes grateful. Harry had never seen such an expression on him, and it was quite mesmerizing. Even though his cheek was still swollen and purple. A bruise that he found himself looking at, wondering as he frowned.
She simply suggested, stopping there their conversation. She knew that it was useless to insist. The boy was as stubborn as her. She could only hope that he would eventually change his mind someday. But she also understood that she would not be able to force him to do so. She couldn't push positivity into him. Harry had to do this work by himself, no matter how much she tried to reassure him. She just hoped he knew that he was not alone.
She snapped, crossing her arms against her chest. Looking determined and unwilling to give up. Her eyes burning with tenacity made Harry lose his temper.
Malfoy asked, closing his book and slowly putting it to his side. Brushing a hand in his platinum hair that had fallen in front of his eyes while he was bent over on his reading. But they were so silky they refused to stay pushed back and fell again, framing his face to the top of his cheeks. They had grown longer over the summer, long enough to now show small waves in them. It made him look wilder, more free. And, curiously, even more elegant than when he was keeping them carefully groomed. Even with his broken eyes and his purple bruise, he was looking fucking graceful. Harry had never had any interest in boys, but he couldn't deny, now that he had properly looked at him without having his vision clouded by hatred, Malfoy was a man of a rare beauty.
A bit overwhelmed, he dropped his gaze, ashamed of his eyes that were ready to cry. And she seemed to understand his need for a bit of pride as she let go of him, taking a step backward to give him space.
Not looking up when he sometimes crossed paths with people, he kept on walking, resolved, until he met the fresh air. Breathing in the smell of rain on stone and grass. He didn't even realized it was raining during the night. But he loved that smell, earth and dusty. A smell that seemed to fit his mind. Wet and grim.
Draco and Harry meet again for the first time since the war.
He said with a chill in his voice. Sounding uncomfortable as well and hasty to bring up any conversation that could distract them from this awkward mood.
The Gryffindor bluntly asked then.
He whispered and then went his own way. Heading back to the dorms, he sat in the empty common room. Taking the lunch box out of his bag, it was filled with pastries and he almost ate them all until his stomach couldn't take any more. Then he lay down on the sofa, closing his eyes to rest while he was digesting his meal. Hoping for a peaceful sleep. But he could only get an hour of it until the nightmares came and woke him up. It was the graveyard again... His most recurrent nightmare. He sat and rubbed his hands over his face to try to chase the images away, sighing. His heart was beating fast and he was sweating.
Reaching out to Harry with open arms, she also offered comfort. Harry didn't avoid it this time, approaching her until the girl's arms could fall around his shoulders. She pressed her hand lightly against his biceps, and Harry felt pride in her the squeeze. She was proud to see he had not turned back yet. She encouraged him and, together, they continued their walk until they entered the castle.
The Gryffindor broke it himself now that his old enemy had his attention away from his story. It was a true puzzle for him. They had always been enemies, and even if, without the war, their conflict was now meaningless, he couldn't understand why he had turned to him for company. They never liked each other after all, and even if they could let go of the hate now, why not simply ignore one another ? It's not like they could enjoy being together. Right ?
He grunted, not wanting to confess and lacking too much of imagination to improvise a lie.
He whispered. And god, it was still so fucking weird to hear him be so openly nice. Words as
He mumbled to the girl, getting his attention quickly back to her. Already expecting a scolding somehow.
What an interesting way of seeing things... but Harry rolled his eyes. Yet he couldn't deny, the familiar banter was indeed in a way soothing. A crumb of something the war hadn't destroy it seemed. And it wasn't full of hate like before, it was more perky now. A fight turned into an innocent game, a desperate need to hold on to something stable.
Harry whispered back, and was himself surprised to actually mean it.
Ron started timidly, looking everywhere but at Harry. He had never been good with the talking, giving news was not is forte. Hermione knew it and took over.
Harry stiffened when he heard the applause swell, his name being sung. He stopped, eyes wide open in panic.
Harry accused coldly, getting up. Staring at the Slytherin's back with a turmoil of questions in his head. The things he had seen in his dream was still troubling him, they had raised a new form of confusion. He was taking it like a message to warn him, be more careful. He had never dreamt of Malfoy before, for sure it was no coincidence.
Biting his lip until he felt a metallic taste against his tongue.
Shaking her head with disappointment, she sighted.
Ron growled, shaking his head before getting on his feet. He had reached his limit and this time Hermione was not here to calm him and refrain him from speaking his mind.
Not wanting to stare, Harry turned his gaze back on the parchment on which their conversation was taking place. Waiting for new words to appear.
Harry and Ron's friendship reaches the breaking point.
Their gaze met him and suddenly they both tried to stand as if to rush to him but seemed to be stuck on their chairs. Unable to get up, like glued.
Hermione's voice broke. Harry watched her as she lowered her head. He heard the knot in her throat, her breathing quivered as she tried to control herself. He felt almost guilty to be relieved to hear this sad story, to feel his friend weaken like this. Evoking her own losses, her own consequences. Because, for a moment, she wasn’t pretending anymore. And even if he felt the guilt gnawing at him, Harry felt like he could touch again, even from the tip of his fingers, the link that used to make them so unite. That link that had gotten so superficial and fragile since the war.
As always, she had figured it all out. But still, Harry felt surprised and troubled to hear someone else describe his feelings so accurately, when he himself had trouble putting words on it. It almost seemed like she was understanding his mind better than him. Which actually, wasn't that hard, seeing how lost he was... Not even able to tell anger and pain apart anymore.
He asked surprised. He hadn't seen him since their fight the other night in the common room, and it had been over two weeks now. The Slytherin never came back here after that, never tried to talk to him again or bother him in class. He had kept his distances, stayed silent. To a point were Harry had been confused to be frustrated by that. Sometimes finding himself looking at the papers on his desk, hoping to see words appear on one of it. Because Malfoy had a perk, he was actually good distraction. And he wasn't making Harry feel sadness and pain. Which was all the Gryffindor could feel when he looked at his friends now. But the blond was the only one able to make him feel something different... Annoyance.
The man shouted with a dazed voice. A voice Harry could recognize even if it was mingled between millions.
He thought to himself but kept the words in. Not wanting to start a fight. He already fought too much in his life, he was tired of even arguing. Didn't have the energy for it anymore. He just desperately wanted to find some peace. And so, with a heavy sigh, he then let himself fall on the couch, keeping a safe distance from the blond who looked at him moving with round eyes. Surprised to see him take a sit next to him, even if it was at the opposite side of the sofa. An awkward silence settled in as they both directed their gaze towards the fire still burning. Getting lost in the flames, Harry tried hard to find the feeling of quiet loneliness he was looking for. Even if he was too aware of the Slytherin next to him... he focused on the silence and the warmth, doing his best as to ignore the presence. And, after some time, he surprisingly managed to feel somehow at ease, even if he still could hear the boy's low breathing next to him. He even felt thankful that his old enemy wasn't trying to keep a conversation and was allowing him that quiet moment. As if they both needed that silence. It was almost soothing, and the room filled with a strange feeling of understanding. Without words needed, he knew. He was not looking at him but he could feel it, Malfoy needed that too. Time and peace. To think and to search for an answer. He could feel his loneliness and a familiar feeling of being lost and defeated. Pain.
Harry interrupted him, turning away, not really willing to engage into a conversation again. Anyway, the teacher brought the class to silence to start his lesson. Lazily, Harry took out some papers, quill and ink from his bag to start writing. Looking at the blank pages however, it seemed to absorb him. Pure white and nothingness. He contemplated the void. Familiar emptiness. Finding it almost funny how an untouched piece of paper seemed to be one of the things that could represent him best. A sad kind of funny. Yeah, that's what he was now. Empty.
She said as a goodbye, already turning on her heels to respect the Gryffindor's need for space, not wanting to overwhelm him by forcing her presence on him for too long. Gifted with a deep empathy, she was treating Harry like she would have treated a shy baby kitten. Going for a step by step method, even if the steps had to be small. Gently trying to get him used to the presence of others again without rushing him. That was her strength, and she had always been the most clever on how to handle a troubled mind. Unlike many others, she was very understanding and patient, giving Harry exactly what he needed.
He pushed his tongue in his cheek in annoyance, stopping himself a few steps away from him. Staring, hands still in his front pocket, but this time not holding onto his wand.
He said pointing at a sofa, then nodding to say goodbye as he walked towards it to sit. But, at his surprise, Malfoy didn't head to the Slytherin's stairs, instead he came to stand behind the couch was sitting on.
The Gryffindor started, his voice hoarse from keeping silent for so long.
Hermione continued, growling her irritation towards their lack of maturity.
He meant it, and maybe he was missing himself too. Standing up a bit, he leaned on his elbow. He sighed.
The question had the effect of an electric shock. The raven haired boy felt disillusioned. Of course he could understand, better than anyone. Only, the idea that Malfoy might have been stuck himself in an imposed destiny had never come to his mind. For him, the blond had never been anything more than treacherous and attracted to evil. He had never doubted the motives that had made him take the mark... As always, he had jumped to the easiest conclusion without giving it too much thought. Not caring to see further. Blinded by their rivalry and hatred.
He finally opened his eyes to look at his best friend. The redhead looked like he was about to cry.
: 04.09.2020
Draco woke Harry up. And maybe it wasn't such a good idea...
The answer ended up coming, shorter than excepted seeing how long it took for him to write it. A weird question, it was, that left Harry disconcerted. What was Malfloy expecting ? He was confused. As he didn't really know what to answer yet. Sure, he could let his hatred for him go away, but he couldn't find it in him to start caring for the boy so quickly. It was weird enough not to hate him anymore. He was still processing that fact. The old habit of not liking him was engraved deep inside him. It would require time for it to completely go away.
His fist clenched harder on Malfoy's top, a grey and elegant jacket made of soft fabric, as he also tried to hold his tears. Yelling with distress and outrage. But the blond didn't make any move to remove his hand or fight him. He just stared with a broken gaze. Then suddenly smirked, even laughed a bit, which made Harry's angry eyes open even wider in indignation. Not understanding what he was finding so funny, because he was not aware of how absurd he was sounding. Blinded and rendered deaf by the overwhelming feelings, he couldn't hear himself talk. Claiming for himself the guilt so vividly, like it was a matter of life and death to carry the blame all by himself. Convinced that he was the only one at fault when, actually, so many people had taken part in that war.
He was wondering.
She interrupted him firmly, getting slightly upset.
Something the blond seemed to notice then. Letting go of the smirk, looking sheepish as he bit his lip.
The Gryffindor answered, almost growling from annoyance.
He then whispered, surprising himself and catching the grey eyes who also looked confused. Yes... He believed him.
(Also added some details here and there.)
Every evening, Harry had the same ritual. Leaving the dorms under his cloak to go hide in the astronomy tower where he would lit a cigarette then sit for hours in silence and loneliness. Thinking too much while at the same time trying not to.
Harry softly said as well, putting a definite end on their argument. And now that it was settled, he turned his heals ready to leave. His heart was still pounding in his chest, his mind filled with too much emotions and the tears still asking for permission to fall. He needed to let them go, somewhere where he would truly be alone. He needed to feel it all. That guilt he had just allowed himself to share. It was still eating him inside.
The blond gathered his belongings then joined the raven haired boy.
Ron added.
She then asked and he shrugged. Actually, he didn't feel like attempting the next class... He was already exhausted, feeling his lack of sleep... and food. The thought of escaping charms to go eat and then nap was way more appealing.  He could hear his stomach rumble. For once, he was hungry. Maybe thanks to the glimpse of happiness she had just given him, it must have had an effect on his appetite.
... Malfoy never actually asked him to feel no guilt at all actually, just to stop taking the whole blame... And he was the first who allowed him to feel bad. Showed somehow some respect for it... Everybody else kept telling him he shouldn't feel guilty at all. But he... never said such thing. Fuck, Harry really couldn't get used to this feeling, that of being thankful towards Malfoy. He quickly shook his head to try to get rid of it and clear his head before new words appeared.
He felt annoyed, raising his eyes towards the ceiling with a growl. Then taking his quill to answers with sharp moves. His handwriting was much more messy, quickly wrote with exasperation.
He wasn't ready to face the stares, to let his eyes meet the gaze of all those people. He wished to hide in an enclosed space, a place he would be the only one to have access to. Somewhere far away from this crowd that was teeming on the platform.
He answered in with an amused voice, and Harry could feel he was feeling smart right now. Already moving his gaze back to the stone as if he was trying to read all the names on it, not disturbed by the presence of the Gryffindor.
But still, he wanted to try and be as invisible as he could. Wanting to disappear in the crowd, but surrounded by his well-known friends, no one was fooled.
That one was particularly painful for Harry who felt his heart and guts tighten. So now he was a waste of time for his former best friend... Things had been off for a while between them two now, but still, those were very strong words. He wasn't expecting him to be so cruel towards him. Anger would have been understandable, but this was something else. Close to hate, almost disgust. And to the raven hair boy, it felt like the ginger one was just throwing away all their good memories in the fire, spitting of what they had been. And there, under is cloak, Harry really felt like he was nothing.
He suddenly stopped, realizing he actually didn't know what is opinion of the Slytherin was anymore. He was still too confused by their encounter by the lake.
He sneered, scornful, voice hoarse from the struggle.
He started to explain, wanting to set things straight. But it was her turn to cut him short. Waving a hand in the air.
He answered quickly, without hesitation. Stating firmly with desperation.
Harry asked, narrowing his eyes. Now actually paying attention.
Shit, Harry was already regretting his invitation...
This time the shout was very clear, and very close. And, in a sudden burst, Harry opened his eyes. He was back in the common room, to the real world. And Malfoy was bent above him, shaking him.
Harry had rarely heard such anger in Hermione's voice even though she had to keep it low. It was actually even more frightening, this growling irritation. Sure, they were used to being scolded by her, but never with such a deep disappointment, such raw and cold reproaches. He saw how Ron suddenly felt small in front of her, curling up in his seat, his head getting even lower. His hands were fidgeting on his laps, one thumb scratching the other.
He brought his green eyes back to his friend. As always, she was putting on a smile. A smile so fake that it pained Harry to see it. She didn't tire of trying, but that was exactly why Harry was getting annoyed. Upset to see her always try so hard to pretend like everything was fine. When nothing was. Like he should still be protected from the truth, the chosen one that must be handled with care. That must be kept away from problems and worries. Because he had suffered enough already, hadn't he ? But he didn't like this special treatment, at all. He who had always wanted to be an ordinary boy amongst the others.
: 28.10.2020
Realizing that being soft and trying to stay calm wouldn't bring him down, the blond chose another strategy. This time meeting his provocations by pushing him on his shoulders, his face now also twisting in anger. He just wanted the Gryffindor to stop with his nonsense and was willing to try everything to make him stop acting crazy. Grabbing him firmly, he puled his face close and captured his green eyes with his. The grey turned black from annoyance.
The raven-haired boy asked, probing. Leaning forward, elbow resting on his knees. Trying to keep the blond's eyes locked in his as if to read the answer in it despite the dim light.
. He hated it even. It was offensive and it was bringing up too many bad memories. He didn't understand why the sudden provocation after that speech about, basically, getting together in a peaceful way. But the wicked Slytherin seemed to find it funny, he even winked. Maybe he was just unaware of how bad his choice of word was and didn't mean any harm by it. But still, harry was offended.
It wasn't a question nor a suggestion. It was an order.  Ron looked disconcerted, shaking his head in confusion, opening his mouth a few times but not finding his words. Trapped and pressured. It seemed the task he was ask to do was impossible for him and Harry knew he was just trying to find the right way to decline. It was painful in a way, to see that his former best friend couldn't even bring himself to say sorry, or at least try. But Ron had never been good at apologizing after all. He was stubborn and had a weird pride when it came to admitting his wrongs. They both were alike on that matter and that's why they always had all those stupid fights in the past. Not talking to each other for days or weeks over silly things.  Which let Harry to think... Sure, he would have liked to hear Ron apologize, but maybe it was just selfish of him. Maybe he should apologize too. After all, the apology he gave him the night of their arrival was a joke, empty and not real. Just an excuse, lacking sincerity, or just not aiming right. He had apologized for not being himself, which wasn't right, even to himself. He shouldn't feel sorry for that, because his mental health wasn't a choice he made after all. He too was burdened by it and if he had any control on it he would surely make things better. So now he was starting to understand, that the apology he actually owed Ron wasn't about him feeling this way, but only towards the fact that his state was causing the redhead pain, and that he had ignored that pain.
He confirmed with a sneer.
But tonight, things went a bit differently. Has he got down the stairs to the common room, there he saw Hermione sitting with Ron at a table near the door. At first he meant to ignore them, keep up with his routine and just leave, but then he overheard them as he walked closer, carefully on the tip of his toes to not make any noise. The conversation seamed like a heated one, even though they were trying to keep it low. But Harry could see fire in Hermione's eyes.
Every time Harry laid eyes on his friends, he could feel his heart tighten in his chest, the price of the war weighting on his shoulders. All the sacrifices, the mourning. He had won in the eyes of the world, but the boy felt like he had lost everything in return. A heavy outcome. He couldn't help himself but feeling guilty, although he knew he was nothing else but a pawn in this fight. A pawn without will.
He asked rising his eyebrows. Harry actually didn't even realize he was still holding onto his wand. Shaking his head, he quickly put it in the pocket of the hoody he was still wearing, since he didn't even care to get undressed before going to bed yesterday. Noticing then that Malfoy was also still wearing his clothes.
He ended up being late... But not too much, fortunately. When Harry entered the room, the students were still settling in, talking whilst the teacher was organising things on his desk, checking one last time his program for the day. Giving time for everyone to get back in the mood for studies after summer.
He whispered, shivering from the feeling of confusion. The blond grinned, grey eyes suddenly getting alive with a sparkle of mischief. Harry hadn't really tried to push him away, hadn't deny the feeling of understanding between them. So he took it as a none spoken agreement, that he was willing too, to accept his company.
Now more calm than yesterday, he decided to take another walk trough the castle. An actual one, not like the crazy running he previously did whilst being eaten alive by anxiety. Walking at a slow pace trough the corridors, he took it in. Looking around, trying to remember where the stone got broken before being fixed, brushing his hands onto the walls. He could still hear the battle in his mind. The loud mixture of spells being shouted, the screams of pain and those of fear, not quite the same. The crackling of stone, and the heavy bang of falling debris. He also remembered fire crackling in some places. It was so dark then, the air filled with dust and the floor sticky with blood. It was almost amazing how peaceful it now looked. Everything so clean, but he wished it wasn't. Except for the memorial outside, there was not a single trace left inside. But they should have left some cracks in the walls, just to remember how damaging this battle was. Because it shouldn't be all erased, like a burn it should always be reminded. To honour those who fought, but also to keep the lesson alive.
he began timidly.
His voice was unstable. He shook his head, his heart was beating so hard that it was hurting him. And, unable to bear to be in this room any longer, with all those eyes locked on him, he decided to flee despite the imploring eyes of his friends. First, stepping back with hesitation, his legs shaking under his weight, before actually turning around to run.
Suddenly hearing the girl rummaging through her bag, he turned his gaze, frowning with curiosity, to look at her. Her bag was still so small yet so filled, she had gotten used to having so much storage space without having to bother actually carrying all of it on her back... Hermione finally took out a box from it and handed it over to Harry.
: 28.10.2020
He said, pleading in a low voice, broken. For the first time, vulnerable. Raising desperate eyes to Hermione with a shaky breathe. And Harry could see on his face, how hard it had been for him. That what he had taken for selfishness was actually pain.
Malfoy said he was sorry. Harry kept on replaying the word in his head, less and less sure that he had heard properly. Because it really was unbelievable. He couldn't help but wonder if it was a trick and if maybe the blond was playing a new sick game with him.
Stay safe guys !
He asked with an irritated tone. Sure, they shared a special, but weird, moment just a few hours ago, and Harry's opinion on him ended up softening from it. But still, it didn't especially make him want to share time with the Slytherin. He was not an enemy anymore, but still far from being a friend. Right now he was just... someone. And even if his company was surprisingly not the worst, Harry still like the idea of being truly alone better.
25.10.2020
She joked and it made him successfully grin a bit more. For a minute he remembered the moment she was referring too. Back then, they weren't as close as they are now, it was only the birth of their friendship. They were just kids, still unaware of the hardships that would come to them. Innocent. Looking at her now, he couldn't help but think of how much they've grown up since then. Way too fast. But she turned into the most beautiful soul. And he was feeling so proud of her.
Harry called him, trying to get his attention, and the man jumped at his voice, startled, before beginning to shake. Pressing his body against the wall in panic, he didn't turn around, obviously afraid.
He could feel Harry tense more, his green irises turning black and his hand squeezing his wand with white knuckles.
Staying still, he was focusing on his breathing to prevent himself from thinking to much. Listening to the wind brushing the trees afar, the high pitch sound of some bats sometimes mixing into it, the buzzing of an insect, the disturbing scream of a fox and the pages being turned behind him. At first he counted them, then he had lost track around thirty. But he noticed that Malfoy seemed to be a fast reader, the sound was almost like a tempo. Constant and punctual. He almost had figured it out by now and could nearly predict the exact second he would hear him turn a page again. He wondered about what he was reading, because, if he trusted his fast and steady pace, it seemed like something really captivating. He guessed a fiction, because nobody could read a textbook that fast and seem so much into it, except Hermione... Sometimes he could even hear his breath hitch, as if something really exciting was happening in his book, making him on edge.
But to Harry it was a good thing. Enough to be refreshing. Annoyance is not a painful feeling at least.
He reminded him and looked away, making it clear that their little conversation and moment of sharing had come to an end. He was still serious about his condition, and the break from silence had lasted long enough.
Another voice tried to reach him. This one seemed very far away. Like a distant an echo. Almost otherworldly.
He burst out harshly and they both then stared angrily at each other, almost defying. Wrestling in a heavy silence, their bodies tensed. Testing their patience and trying to make the other one yield. And, eventually, Harry won. The girl's eyes turned from rage to despair and her shoulders dropped as she released her stiff muscles.
Malfoy sighed whilst getting up and Harry let out a small laugh.
The Gryffindor simply kept on questioning. Pushing the blond to be more explicit about it. Which was a good sign to the latter, showing that they could now actually have a conversation and clear things.
And it was even harder for him to let go when everybody around was just pretending that it never happened, continuing on with their life with a blindfold just to make themselves feel better. Avoiding the subject, when actually he desperately needed to talk it out. But nobody wanted to hear anymore. So everything was just staying inside of him, rotting and eating him. Global denial, which to him was only pure hypocrisy.
He admitted. And even though he sounded exasperated, the words went straight to Harry's heart with relief. So he still cared... It actually felt good to hear, making the boy realize that, hiding behind the anger, this whole situation had actually brought him more pain than he thought. He was missing Ron, even if he had had a hard time admitting it. He wanted so badly to believe that he didn't need anyone... But this whole loneliness thing was actually starting to feel heavy.
Taking a deep breath, Harry took his quill back, hesitating before writing.
He asked with an arched eyebrow that made him look mischievous and snooty.
Now he could see the boy's jaw clenching as if he was about to break his teeth. Understanding then that he was not about to let go of the matter.
The Slytherin did, indeed, not seemed to have planned to attack... If Harry struggled to already trust him, he still decided to lower his guard, for now. Putting the wand back in his pocket, he let his arm fall to his sides, hands empty. He could almost hear a slight grateful sigh escape from the blond.
Sinking in the darkness between the trees, Harry could already hear the wind caressing the surface of the water, a moist and soothing lapping coming to lick his ears. There was no happy echoes here, only silence broken by the whispers of nature. Solitude. Or at least that's what he thought he would find....
A bit further on the beach, his eyes caught a small luminous point, almost blue. That's where he decided to head to. Not to the cottage, but to that bright spot. Again he knew, his inner voice was leading him. And as he got closer, it took form. It was the Triwizard cup, standing on a flat rock. And, looking at it, was a man dressed in Hufflepuff uniforms.
Harry finally answered, his tone carrying something strong in it. A will he wasn't even aware of. Making it seem like he was looking to soothe Malfoy's remorse, determined to make him stop thinking so bad of himself. Which made absolutely no sense. Seriously, why would he care ? He was thinking too much into it, mind blurred by his own feelings. Because, listening to Malfoy gave him the strange impression of looking into a mirror. It was almost the same image, just reversed. And he was struggling to deny the connection that was growing out of it. Two boys trapped by their destiny, openly destroyed by a war they never wanted... Kids used like toys to do the messy work of grown ups. Trying to protect the ones they love and causing damage in doing so.
But meaning was forced upon him, when a black veil fell from the ceiling behind Sirius. A dark grey sheet almost transparent. Familiar. Awfully familiar.
He whispered weighting it. It was loaded heavy.
He closed his eyes, enjoying the emptiness of the room and the silence. But then he heard the door, and steps coming towards him. Someone sat on his bed, he felt the weight sinking into the mattress next to him.
He growled, struggling harder.
He heard Ron's voice call him but he didn't stop, running through the empty corridors of the castle, to the point of losing his breath. He collapsed in an isolated corner, just behind a statue. Tears rolled down his cheeks, he felt like he had forgotten how to breathe. His eyes hastily watched the corridor around him, to make sure he was alone. And he suddenly realized how everything seemed to be normal again. The impacts of hexes in the walls had disappeared, the stones had been repaired. The blood cleaned... as if nothing had ever happened.
, he mused darkly, grabbing the card and unfolding it.
Potter remained motionless, arms at his sides. I clung to the last shreds of my dignity so as not to burst into tears. “Forget it, forget what I said,” I muttered and walked away.
Draco arched his back and laughed as Harry laid a trail of kisses down his abdomen. He took his face in his hands and made him raise his head to be able to kiss him lightly on the lips. "Maybe I'm a little scared," he whispered.
He turned around, his brows arched. He was beautiful… oh Santa, you have no idea how beautiful he was. And I felt like I was dying.
Harry was only vaguely aware of how indecent they must look, so naked and tangled on the deck.
Draco nodded. In the potion that disinhibits, there was an active ingredient that was also found in the less common potions for colds. It had been easy to drop the whole investigation and get it reinstated.
Draco shook his head. “I don't remember anything… really…. nothing before this morning when I woke up and found him naked in my bed "
Harry distinctly felt a shiver of excitement trickle down his lower abdomen, catching his breath in his throat. Harry was sure he wasn't gay. It was his hands that took involved initiatives, wandering on Draco's back. His lips brushing Draco's, Draco's jaw, every inch of skin on his neck ...
The former Slytherin just shook his head as he followed Harry into the house. The table in the hall was overturned, the vase shattered on the floor. Harry quickly scanned his gaze around, recording torn paintings, crippled chairs, turned over drawers ... and the word WHORE headed over the fireplace in the living room.
He stopped abruptly as if caught by a revelation and turned with fervour towards Hermione. "I wouldn't have flirted with Hannah Abbott"
She reluctantly removed her hand from her wand. Draco turned slowly, his hands in plain sight. He had no doubt that Weasley would do anything to keep him from seeing Potter. Which was his priority at the moment.
"Mr. Malfoy, are you all right?"
"So ... did you have fun?" the girl insinuated and Harry hated the tone of her voice.
She watched him for a moment, arching the corner of her mouth in a sly smile. "Kids, put on your coats ... Uncle Harry needs caffeine"
He slowly turned over in the sheets, feeling an incipient headache pounding behind his temples. He ran a hand over his face, eyeing Malfoy lying beside him. The slightly long blond hair ... the toned shoulders sticking out of the blanket. Harry leaned towards him and touched his eyebrow with his lips, earning a small sigh.
Dear Santa Claus,
"I thought you only saw each other occasionally"
"He's probably another Roger," Ginny finally admitted, starting to run for the door. "Come on, snail!"
He took a step forward, feeling the wand press against his throat.
"Let's take these off too," the former Slytherin said with a feral grin on his lips as he tore off his jeans and boxers, stripping him off completely.
“You can still be my boyfriend. You see? The press loves us” Malfoy said, showing him the cover of a weekly. The title was The Dream Couple. "It could help you rehabilitate your reputation after ... you know ..."
Harry narrowed his eyes, letting out a sigh as Malfoy's lips slowly traced his shoulder and part of his chest covered in black ink. He felt his eyelids get heavy, his breath quickening, as he lay back on the towel. The warmth of Malfoy's body on his, his hands on his chest… on his hips… exploring every inch of skin.
“I saw you go away together last night, but I didn't believe… I didn't understand! I mean, you two hate each other! You have to tell me everything… ”she said, stealing a strawberry from his plate. "Every little, sordid detail ... has it big?"
"I don't want to know," Hermione shouted, covering her ears with her hands.
"What does he know?" he asked, sitting down again.
Draco slowly moved his aching neck. He had fallen asleep on Potter's couch in an extremely uncomfortable position. He ran his hands over his face, inhaling the good smell of coffee. He sat up, looking at Potter's and Granger's backs standing next to each other. They were whispering in a low voice.
"The Dursleys?" Weasley snapped. "They would never come to ..."
"You're going to catch a cold," Harry added, starting to take it off.
"Yes ..." Harry sighed, dipping his fingers into the former Slytherin's blond hair and squeezing some locks.
He kisses exactly as he fucks: with force ... with transport, there is nothing delicate or gentle. Just sex. Pure physical alchemy, which sweeps away anything other than body and instinct.
Harry looked down at his jeans. They were very normal jeans. What was wrong with them? They were old and worn ... Do gays wear jeans like yours?
He swallowed hard, leaning back in his chair as Potter paused in front of the desk.
"Too bad I didn't send you anything," Harry snapped, as Malfoy closed the door and preceded him into the living room.
"So it's true," she began. “You two… you got married,” she spelled out, underlining each syllable.
So there was really a lake down there somewhere. Harry just hoped the ice wouldn't shatter under their feet. He watched Malfoy take off his backpack, drop one knee in the frozen snow and take out a metal urn. He held it over his palm for a few seconds before opening it and spilling the ashes it contained into the water.
Harry realized to his horror that the former Slytherin was dumping him. He swallowed hard, also taking off the other glove while Malfoy put down the badge he had sent him next to the flowers and then turned his back on him.
"Me? But come on ... why should I ... "
"Tell me once again what you saw me do ..."
I arched my back, lids down, as I slowly moved my fingers.
"What do you know that I don't know?"
Harry laughed as Draco pulled back the blanket and lay down on him. His hair smelled good. Harry wrapped his arms around him, placing a light kiss on his forehead. After all, it wasn't too bad ... he might even get used to dealing with this fearful and incredibly docile Malfoy.
Malfoy twirled his wand and soon after a pair of blue boxers appeared in his hand. A snitch was drawn on one of the legs. Harry realized with horror that Malfoy was flipping the rubber band over to show the inner label, which carried the initials. H. P.
Hermione gave him a
He took a note and wrote only a few words. He hesitated for just a moment, rereading them ... weighing them slowly against the palate.
Stephen said he is very reserved about his private life but doesn't think he has a boyfriend. He
"We have to take you to a doctor," the witch said, lighting up the tip of her wand and pointing it in his eyes to check his pupils.
after today I guess I will never be able to get fucked by Harry Potter.
Potter smiled wickedly, bringing his face closer. Only if he leaned a few inches, Draco could have kissed him. "You really are a slut," he whispered and Draco wished with all his heart that Potter kissed him and then finish the job.
"He liked someone a while ago ... but he doesn't want to tell us who he is. He says it's already a lost battle, ”he muttered, pulling himself up. His eyes were red and circled. "I'll tell you that.." he went on, pricking me with a finger "He needs to fuck"
Lui fece un cenno affermativo con il capo, avvicinandosi alla macchinetta. Sentiva gli occhi inquisitori dell’amica sulla schiena.
I'm sorry if I made you worry with my last letter, it wasn't my intention. Sometimes I get a little melodramatic.
Harry reached a finger to its opening, finding it already completely wet. He touched it with his fingertip, barely penetrating it and making him moan with excitement. Lips parted. Harry couldn't stop admiring them. "The Sorting Hat wanted to sort me out among the Slytherins," he whispered, adding a second finger. He bent and twisted them enough to make him moan again.
“If I hadn't had all those vaccinations to go to Mongolia and still weren't afraid of getting something awful, I might consider this place at least decent,” I said.
Draco looked at him genuinely perplexed. "Why? Tell me what negative feedback you had! "
I can not handle it anymore. Really.
The girl let out a long sigh, going to sit on the fence next to him.
"Don't start acting like Ron"
The place was busier than he had expected. He moved to the rhythm of the music, his back wet with sweat. Pansy yelled at him that she was thirsty, and he followed her to the bar. Draco felt good.
A beer was manly. A beer was what Potter would drink. He gave me a glance, while the barman walked away without taking either mine or his order.
"I'm sure to scare you"
"It's sunny ... it's a wonderful day ... go on, silly!"
Pansy's house was full of people and music. And I couldn't stop thinking about Harry.
In front of his pathetic friends. In front of mine. I didn't give a damn. I just wanted to fuck with Potter!
Harry pursed his lips curtly, crossing his arms over his chest. Okay, he would listen to what he had to say. He would have pulverized him later.
She hadn't looked at Harry again. Draco suspected she wouldn't be able to do it even later. Fear had built up inside her. Her mother tried to be strong even for his father, but sometimes emotions overwhelmed her. The whole world had come apart, she no longer had friends, relatives ... He was the only one who managed to regain a minimum of credibility, but his parents were considered outcasts from all over the magical world.
Draco gave a small nod. He let silence fall between them, an unwanted guest. Potter rubbed the back of his neck, shifting his weight from one foot to the other and Draco felt an incredible surge of pride in realizing that it was he who made him uncomfortable.
"Mom ..." he tried uncertainly. He glanced in Harry's direction. He was standing, his hands buried in his pockets, his shoulders hunched in an embarrassed pose.
Harry kissed him again and Draco wondered if the potion Pansy had made him drink wasn't having a much longer effect than expected. He felt so intoxicated with happiness that he was afraid that everything could dissolve at any moment.
"You didn't send the documents," he whispered, brushing his nose with his.
"Like dating and stuff like that?"
"Why did you do such a thing? Couldn't you just dump him? "
I will keep you informed.
Harry's vision was entirely occupied by Malfoy's face.
Potter leaned towards him, his fingers playing with his nipples. "I know ... that's why I was telling you to relax" he whispered, then sinking his face into the hollow between his neck and shoulder. His body half lying on that former Slytherin.
"I go to Rita Skeeter and I force her to write that it was bullshit,"
Harry pointed a finger at her, feeling his cheeks burn in embarrassment. "Ginny and I had sex," he said slowly.
He clung to his shoulders as his thrusts became convulsive.
"Come here," Malfoy said, pushing him back. He tucked the covers back, as he had done on the night of Lucius' death. Fingers through his hair. Then he lay down on the mattress beside him, perfectly dressed except for his shoes. Head on the pillow. The hand on his arm.
"I'm going to make some tea," he announced, heading to the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, n.12.
Draco just smiled a wicked and sly smile at the same time. He leaned toward him, reducing the distance between them to inches.
He smiled as the former Slytherin appeared in the doorway with a tray in his hands.
"Come on, get out of there," he whispered, passing his arms under his to get him back on his feet. He covered Malfoy with a large bath towel, holding most of his weight. The former Slytherin stepped over the edge of the bathtub with one leg before collapsing against him. Harry wrapped him with both arms, pulling him over him ... on the floor ... their legs entwined as Malfoy buried his face in the hollow between his neck and shoulder and screamed. A broken cry of a mortally wounded animal.
"Will you stop interrupting me?" Harry said, letting out a snort of laughter.
I am sitting here in the cold writing to you and meanwhile I keep waiting for a sign. Any sign.
"I don't care what he did, I want to understand what you didn't do," Hermione replied and for a moment Harry was sure she was about to slap him again.
And I went on like this until the minutes became hours ... and the hours the whole night.
"Ice?"
Draco sighed. Although they were still rich, the Malfoy family had lost a lot of their luster and especially a lot of money after the war. They had left Malfoy Manor almost immediately and had sold it off to the state that had turned it into a library and museum in remembrance of the war. It would have been impossible for them to live there after what had happened in there.
He narrowed his eyes slightly as Mafoy's light fingers touched the back of his neck. "You have to put some more cream, you're burning yourself"
"Be more careful!" Ginny scolded him, hands on her hips and an annoyed expression on her face that made her look dangerously like Molly.
"So ..." he said, clearing his throat "what do you want ..."
"I'll bring you the documents for cancellation tomorrow," he said calmly.
"The gift was not a great idea," said the witch, slowly sipping her tea.
"Have you gone stupid?" Ron snapped, lowering the magazine. His ears and cheeks were a triumph of red. “Since when do you like Malfoy? Harry ... I understand this whole thing about being gay ... really ... but since when did you ... "
He just shook his head. “I'll pretend it never happened… and then you know what? I remember so little of the evening that nothing could have really happened"
"You can't," Malfoy replied fiercely, raising his chin a little. Harry arched an eyebrow, staring at him without arguing. Malfoy was as mentally ill as his ex-boyfriend.
"We will never take that shame home. Now, please, do you want ... "
I leaned a little towards him, the need to kiss him was very strong. Even just to flirt a little ... just a little ...
Harry let out a snort of laughter from his nose. That guy had to be completely unsane. It had to be ...
Harry tried to push his hands away… "I don't want your scarf," he grumbled. It was drenched in Draco's perfume. It was far too intimate a thing. Something that would be good for two boyfriends… real boyfriends.
“Harry was injured in a raid with the Aurors. I was contacted by St. Mungo…” he replied, crumpling the note. The heart had started beating much faster. For a moment Draco considered not moving from there ... pretending that nothing had ever happened. Except… he had to know if Harry was okay.
"Then…"
"I'm fine," Harry muttered. Hermione stared at him for a few seconds, then turned to Malfoy.
He waited until he heard the sound of someone's footsteps approaching the other side of the door.
“… When I realized I wanted to give you a blowjob,” he added, before bending over to his knees. He took his dick in his mouth and started sucking it so hard that Potter swayed on his legs.
He moaned his name softly as Draco lay back on him. The bare skin against him.
He had come home, staggering. He just hoped that in the apparition he hadn't lost something important. He leaned against the iron fence, his head clouded. Two hands closed on his uniform jacket and slammed him against the gate. "Damn, Potter," Malfoy growled.
"I found him half an hour ago. I cut the belt and pulled him down. I could not…"
Harry repeated the toast, pouring the scotch down in two long gulps. He squinted a little, feeling it burn in his stomach. He could drink a couple of pints of beer with no problem, but he had never been a connoisseur of finer spirits.
Harry quickly started down the hall as a chorus of enthusiastic shouts erupted in the stands.
Potter arched an eyebrow. "Still, I thought I had found something," he said, giving Draco a look that was pure sex. He leaned toward him, hands propped up on either side of his hips. Harry buried his face in the hollow between his neck and shoulder, inhaling his scent deeply.
"I'm going to get two butterbeers," Draco sighed, standing up.
"I do not know! Why do you ask me? " she replied, rapidly leaving the room. Her hair was all frizzy, as if she had put a finger in the socket.
Harry motioned for me to remove the sheet. It was like opening the holy gates of heaven. His cock was there, big. Partially hard already. I bent down and touched it slowly with my lips, as if I was savoring the aroma of a fine wine.
"I'm a vegetarian," he replied, taking off his t-shirt and passing it around his neck.
Ron emerged from the kitchen with his mouth full of cookies. He looked from Harry to Malfoy. He pointed to the former Slytherin with one finger, muttering something incomprehensible. His ears were incredibly red.
Fuck me ... fuck me ... fuck me ... fuck me ...
"But maybe I should take a closer look"
“Wait, you've been thinking about this since after Christmas and haven't written to him? Did
Draco looked away, trying not to laugh. "Sorry ... keep going"
"You too, Malfoy"
Harry pulled him close for a swift kiss before switching positions.
"Your ego is also beyond the bounds of human understanding," he retorted.
Malfoy shrugged, grabbing another prawn. "You can't just not show up on Christmas day with your family"
He lazily stroked Malfoy's hip, before moving away and laying down on the other bath towel. His eyes fixed on the cloudless sky.
Their lips touched each other with each thrust, their interspersed breaths echoed between the walls of the room ... the sweat dripped in hot and tortuous streams on their bodies.
"Honey"
Many people couldn't understand how he could love her. They had been friends all their lives now… and he more than anyone could say she was crazy, but she was also the most extraordinarily loyal person he had ever known. The problem was that Pansy would defend him to the point of doing something absolutely insane and unpredictable.
"We can't move him ... The doctors said he can't use ..."
He had fucked Draco Malfoy. Twice.
"Say it again," I whispered, getting lost in his eyes.
Pansy followed immediately. "I'm going with you," she reiterated at his inquiring glance.
Malfoy watched him for a moment, running his fingers through his hair. "Okay, Potter… we can pick up from here…" he murmured, before leaning over and kissing him.
And here's the final chapter ... I hope you like it :-)
Hermione struggled to her feet, letting out a moan. "I have to roll home"
"You're in a good mood," Hermione noted, emerging from her books.
"Is Malfoy blackmailing you?" he growled, feeling anger ignite his stomach.
He would not have imagined the florist's face as he secretly read it.
The ocean was colder than he expected. Perhaps because they were a few kilometers away from the beach, but the seabed was the most wonderful he had ever seen.
"If Harry is happy ..." Hermione interjected, sitting down heavily in a chair. She rubbed her belly, stretching her swollen feet forward a little. "Malfoy has been smitten with him like ... always ... and he's a nice guy, I understand if Harry ..."
Maybe Hermione was right… and maybe he just needed some good advice given at the right time.
"But I never expected you to give me this pain ..." she said, putting a hand to her chest. "You ... you of all my children ... why didn't you get married at The Burrow?"
He got up from the table, making his chair rustle on the floor. He felt suffocated in there. He reached the garden, ignoring the voice of Hermione who was calling him.
He had been away for a while now; the game was resuming ...
He grabbed a quill, straightening in his chair trying not to give in to boredom when an insistent tapping caught his attention.
But the former Gryffindor had already proved the point. He removed his hand and left his office without saying anything else.
Draco swallowed hard, shifting uncomfortably in his chair. He didn't expect that kind of response. And he certainly didn't know how to treat a very honest Harry Potter.
Draco grabbed the railing and attacked the steps, his breath burning in his chest, sweat trickling down his back. He jumped the last three steps and turned onto the street. He could hear Harry's footsteps behind him. He accelerated again, asking the muscles of his legs the impossible. It will decelerate only when it reaches the front door of the building.
He didn't want them to think he was eavesdropping. Harry turned to him, handing him the red mug he'd been using for the last few mornings… when they'd had breakfast together.
Harry's penis twitched strongly, sending him a wave of excitement that set his whole body on fire.
Potter shook his head, staring out the window. "Even a no-consequence fuck with you always has consequences, right Malfoy?" He looked back at him and Draco felt a shiver of excitement and fear run down his back. Potter is dangerous, he thought, as the former Gryffindor took the few steps that separated them.
"Go away," he mumbled, moving his hand blindly to chase him away and go back to sleep peacefully.
Harry froze, watching Hermione exit the elevator, cell phone in hand. Curly hair tied in a ponytail. She quickly reached him and from her expression Harry sensed that his situation had clearly worsened. "How did you find me?"
Draco opened his eyes, realizing that he was lying on Potter's couch. Potter's heavy breathing on his jaw.
Harry glanced at him over his shoulder. "Really? I did not know."
Thanks
Draco quickly put on his elegant coat, following him on the entrance path. "Let's go ... where?" he asked.
The former Slytherin dabbed his hair with a towel, he seemed accustomed to everything ... sailing boats, high mountains ... sports and more generally the good things in life.
It had been surprisingly easy to decide: Draco would move into Harry's apartment, which was more spacious, but he would keep his too, so he would only move what was necessary. Harry raised himself on one elbow, looking around the room.
"Malfoy, what ..." Harry said, opening the door. He was still wearing the Auror uniform. Draco grabbed him by the uniform jacket and pressed the lips to his. Harry's fingers in his wet hair, his mouth opening giving free access to his tongue. Four days of that madness ... then they would resume hating or ignoring each other ... or both.
Harry slipped his hands under his shirt and stroked his back. "Don't leave me alone," he whispered, pulling away just to look at him. "Not ... not when I need it ... but when I don't need it"
Harry smacked his lips. "Thank you. At my uncles' house, there was a beautiful sun ... I got a little tanned ... "
It means I'll get fucked soon!
“We can disappear. It is cold enough and far enough away from steep walls not to risk inadvertently causing an avalanche. Hold on, ”Malfoy whispered, tightening his grip on his waist.
A flash of anger passed through Malfoy's irises again, before being erased by a light kiss. His hands slipped invitingly along Harry's chest, then lingering on his hips.
He deformed his mouth in a yawn, desperately trying to stay awake.
He was kneeling, his arms raised so that his fingers were interlocked behind his neck. His wand was placed in front of him.
Then, to his horror, Hermione turned back to Malfoy, talking to him as if he wasn't there. "He tightened the vest so that it put enough pressure on the spot where the spells hit him to keep the pain under control."
Harry let out a snort of laughter. "And I could get you significant discounts"
Harry put down his fork loudly, snorting. It was useless to ignore the huge pink elephant that roamed the room.
"It can't be him," Weasley hissed. His wand appeared out of nowhere. Draco froze as he felt the wand brush the back of his neck. He only moved to grab Pansy's wrist and squeeze it tightly. "No," he whispered.
today I saw Harry again.
Orgy with the elves?
"Because I feel like I'm going crazy, okay?" I exploded with anger. “I want you to fuck me from our third year at Hogwarts! And not…"
No, she knew a lot more than that, but she didn't want to tell him. Hermione would never have used the expression
"You're doing it all by yourself!" Harry replied.
"That's why I didn't give you permission to eat it," Harry replied, turning them again and browning them on the other side.
"It's okay," Draco said, kissing her on the cheek. She was cold, her hands didn't stop shaking. He took them from her. "He's with me ... don't worry"
I rested my palms on the wooden panel and Potter swallowed hard. His Adam's apple moved in the middle of his throat. I wanted to lick it.
He stopped for a moment. Obscenely big. Well it didn't sound that bad, did it? That situation could basically have positive implications. Healthy advertising, for example.
he wondered, realizing he was only vaguely hysterical.
"...The king of straight sex."
"There ... there was the change of shift ... if you want to sneak in, this is the right time"
It was satisfying and incredibly exciting to see him standing there, half dead with fear.
"What do I have to do to be able to order a drink?" I said.
"Harry," Malfoy sighed, digging his fingers into his shoulders and causing him more chills.
What if it was a better fuck?
Potter looked at me suspiciously. "It's a joke?" he asked, his cheeks red with embarrassment.
His fingers moved fast and expertly.
"Saturday"
“Come on, get out of there,” he told him, wrapping him in a bath towel. Harry closed his eyes, he was shaking again. Malfoy led him into the bedroom and sat him on the bed. He slipped the towel off his shoulders, draping it around his hips, then leaned forward to clinically examine his shoulder. The fingers moved lightly on the skin covered with the tattoo ink. “You have a swollen shoulder. I'll be right back, ”he said, before leaving the room. Harry wished he didn't, but couldn't muster enough energy to protest. Harry looked up at him as he walked back into the room with a tube of ointment in his fingers.
"Maybe I like him ... a little," he murmured at the end.
Which I've always said.
Sleeping together wasn't the right definition. Fucking was the most suitable. Without kisses on the mouth, without emotional involvement, without intimate gestures or affection once they were done. On the night he had killed that kid by mistake and Lucius died, pain had united them as Harry didn't think possible, creating a communication bridge, made of whispered words and kind gestures, which they had never had before.
"What?" Malfoy whispered, lifting his hips a little to facilitate his movements.
"And a toothbrush"
On the front page there was a photo of his, it was taken at the commemoration for the war dead. His head was bowed down, Hermione's arm around his shoulders. He looked tired, drained. It wasn't one of his best photoshoots.
Hermione took a deep breath. "A friend," she exhaled.
Only rarely did she let her warmth come out in public. For the rest of the time, she preferred to hide behind a cold and haughty expression.
"what?" he replied without understanding.
"How did you find out?" he whispered.
“Yes, Potter, really. Now go, I'm late, ”Malfoy replied, freeing himself from the grip of his arms. Harry stepped back without stopping smiling.
But I turned around before I was too far away to be noticed in the crowd.
“Fiji was a mistake,” Malfoy replied, looking back at him. “Like everything else. You are the hero of the magical world, you are about to become the head of the Auror department ... I am a Death Eater "
"Are you afraid now?" Potter asked him, arching an eyebrow.
"I'm going to say hello"
I drew one of my most angelic smiles, taking the glass with my long slender fingers. "Not yet," I said in such a low voice that he didn't hear me.
Ron made a face. "It's worse than when you made out with my sister ..."
He didn't know what to do. So he watched him dress in the semi-darkness and then walk away.
"I can hear you thinking from here," he said, his voice husky with sleep. He turned to him and placed a hand on his hip drawing Draco towards him.
"Nothing ... I pissed him off and the flowers were a kind gesture to remedy"
"But I'm not!" Harry growled.
"I wish you would read my mind," Draco finally said, returning to face him.
"It was obvious to everyone, Harry"
Wish me luck, I'll still need it.
Malfoy exhaled deeply, grabbing him by the arm and pushing him out of the apartment. "Did they ever tell you you suck at these things?"
Draco
"He would have loved this day," he added. "I prefer to remember him like this ... as the father who would have liked to be here on a day like this."
"Do you stay here?" he asked in a whisper.
"No more lies," he whispered as Draco unbuttoned his jeans and stroked his erection from above the fabric of his boxers.
"I want you," I said. My forefinger flew over his jaw. Potter winced slightly. "I want you inside me. I want you to make me cum I've never done in my life "
"I'm not going away," Harry replied, deliberately ignoring Malfoy who had cleared his throat in a fake cough.
His coronary arteries would hold up, wouldn't they? He wouldn't have had a heart attack or something because of anger, right?
Harry put his hands on his knees, sweat dripping from his hair in thick drops.
Happy people, do you understand?
He put a hand on her shoulder, but that only caused another excess of sobs. Draco wondered for a moment if he was having hysterics and if he should slap her, when she suddenly stood up in a swirl of skirts and long blond hair. A beaming smile lit up her face. "It's wonderful," she said, hugging him tightly. She took his face in her hands and looked at him for a moment.
Draco evaluated her words for a few seconds. He had fucked with Harry Potter. It still didn't seem real to him. Pansy was right, of course. Harry Potter had been his erotic dream for years. He masturbated to death thinking of him, but ...
"I'm not your friend, Malfoy," Weasley growled.
“Sorry I'm late, Meredith,” he said. And it was beautiful! I know, I write it in all my letters, but dear Santa, you don't realize! Potter is really cool! The kind of beauty that makes you die, you know? That forces you to touch yourself again and again hoping that the hand you caress is his ... I masturbated to death, thinking of him.
Harry just shrugged, before glancing at me again. Oh Santa, they were the hottest foreplay I've ever experienced. I mean… he was there, naked and he was just looking at me with those magnetic eyes of his and I already had my boxers wet with semen.
Harry licked his lips, preventing himself from smiling as Malfoy's fingers quickly unbuttoned his jeans and pulled his boxers down. It was too easy ... really ...
She just shook her head, her hand still on Harry's arm. "Today is not a good day," she said, before nodding at the window above the sink. Draco looked at his father sitting in a wheelchair positioned under a pergola, a blanket over his legs, his long blond hair had now turned white. The opaque gaze directed towards an indefinite point.
Thanks again! You are the best Santa in the world!
"After dinner, don't you want to know how good I am at making breakfast?" he told him as Draco finished dressing. He turned as Harry grabbed his hand with his. He attracted him a little towards himself.
"We should first ..." he snapped between kisses, as he pushed Malfoy against the door of his room and pressed against him.
Oh Santa! You have no idea how fuckable he was!
"Come on, ask him!" she encouraged her.
Draco shivered; tears trapped in his staring eyes. Harry wrapped his arm more around him, stroking his back reassuringly. Only once had he seen him so upset. "I'll take you away ... lean on me," he whispered. Draco stayed stiff against him, but he didn't resist.
She walked over to him, ruffling his hair. "I love you. Very very much. Just make sure he's okay with it, too, before you shut him out, ”the witch murmured.
Harry grabbed him by the arm and Draco reluctantly let himself be pulled back against him. "I'm serious," he whispered into his mouth. "If we don't cancel it ... what can happen so bad?"
Draco moaned, running his fingers through his hair. He squeezed a few strands between his fingers, suddenly becoming serious. "Second thoughts?" he asked softly. Harry narrowed his eyes slightly. Draco could clearly feel a surge of irritation growing from the center of his chest. Then Harry placed a kiss on the inside of his wrist and looked back at him.
With all those kisses, Harry was getting very confused.
"Can you hurry?" he growled when the Auror moved some cushions behind his back to make him more comfortable. He didn't want him to be so close. The green eyes lingered in his and Draco wondered how he could always observe him as if he couldn't hide anything from him.
"It was so sudden that you couldn't tell me ... me, Harry ... I thought you considered me a mother now ... I thought you were part of our family ..."
"The truth ... I'm in Fiji with Draco Malfoy on a sailboat"
“The reporters will have already known that I was hit. No hospital, ”Harry muttered, looking at Hermione.
Pansy entered immediately after him, sat down on the island in the middle of the kitchen. Her skirt climbed up her toned legs and Weasley blatantly pretended not to notice.
Harry hates me! He hates me! He can't even bear to hear the sound of my voice! Please, please do something!
I feel humiliated. I just want to get under the duvet and sleep until the holidays are over.
Harry looked sadly at his breakfast without wanting to eat it anymore, the back of his neck tingling in an alarming way.
"We never could have done that years ago," Draco replied, sitting up. Potter just arched an eyebrow.
Harry clenched his fists tightly at his sides, mentally giving himself a fool. Malfoy knew how to look after himself. And it wasn't his job to protect him.
"You should be at the Ministry," he said, catching sight of Draco immersed in one of the lounge chairs. He was reading a book and was wearing a green silk robe.
Harry washed slowly, as if the emotional pain had transferred to his body, making his movements slow and tiring. When even the last trace of dried blood was washed away, it collapsed against the tiles. After an indefinite time, he heard Malfoy open the door again. His arm slipped into the shower to shut off the now cold water.
"Yes," he whispered without opening his eyes. "I stay here"
Harry took his chin between his fingers, pressing enough to hurt him a little. "Do you think I'm not capable of it?" he said with his voice rising progressively. "Do you think I would not do everything to protect you?" he cried, making the magic crackle all around them. The window panes suddenly vibrated, threatening to shatter and the flames of the fireplace flared up. Draco let out a small squeak. It looked like a caged animal, defenseless.
"I think it's a bad idea," said Hermione, pouring herself a large ration of oat flakes.
"What?"
Weasley slumped more on the bar, his hair dipped in a puddle of beer.
Draco gave a small affirmative nod.
The young witch got up and tried to run out of the kitchen with a very trivial excuse, but Harry intercepted her in the doorway. He stretched out his arms, anchoring himself to the door jamb to keep her from passing.
He handed the letter to Hermione and waited for the girl to finish reading it before asking her what she thought.
He had gone mad. Surely Hermione would have said he was crazy. Ron, on the other hand ... He closed his eyes, ignoring the urge to cry. He didn't want to know what Ron would say or think.
He was tied to the bed, but he was so manly. So dominant. I finished undressing quickly, the gestures made careless by excitement.
"So you remember what happened?"
Please make it happen. I will always be grateful to you and I promise never to ask you anything again.
Harry saw Malfoy again two weeks after Lucius died. He was sitting on the front steps of Grimmauld Place, number 12. He was waiting for him. A bottle of scotch in your hands. As soon as he saw him, he stood up. The winter coat of an elegant dark blue made him appear taller, his clothes and hair were flawless. He looked like the older version of the boy Harry had met at Hogwarts. Only the expression was different, less mocking, less disgusted ... less Malfoy.
"I'm tired. I'll call you tomorrow ”I said, giving her a light caress. She pouted her bottom lip and started to follow me, but something must have made her give up.
Dear Santa Claus,
“Just… just flashes. My memory is coming back to me slowly ... it's a side effect of the potion that ... "
Malfoy groaned, anchoring his fingers to his forearms. Harry bent over him, until he brushed the tip of his nose with his own. For a second he was tempted to kiss him ... to slide his tongue into his mouth ... but he wanted Malfoy to want him ...
Seriously. He wanted to die.
Draco flattened himself a little behind Harry, hoping Mrs. Weasley had started casting curses would hit Potter first.
"Why did you invite me?" Harry whispered.
Harry pulled him closer, biting his lower lip. His hands continued to devour Draco's skin in demanding caresses.
They were working on it ... laboriously ...
Harry's back suddenly arched as Draco leaned over him and took him in his mouth.
Harry grimaced. "What are you babbling about?”
That he had killed a Basilisk when he was twelve? Well, yes ... that was true too.
Harry nodded, but shortly thereafter had to step aside to avoid the copy of the Prophet's being thrown at his head.
"I'm leaving ..." the former Gryffindor assured him, lifting his crumpled pillows. "As soon as I can find my glasses"
After dessert, he had seen Harry enter the house and then stop in the kitchen. Through the window Draco had seen him talking to Mrs. Weasley for a few minutes. Then she hugged him and Harry sank into her shoulder. He was quick to look away as Hermione dropped into the chair next to his.
"Really? I didn't know they were cats… ”Pansy said, flicking the tip of her tongue between her teeth. Ron swallowed loudly, rubbing the bag of chips in his hand.
"You say we can arrange a visit to Azkaban to tell your Aunt Bellatrix in person?" Harry added.
"Wouldn't you rather snuggle me?" Draco replied, dropping his quill on the table and standing up.
"Master Potter"
"Study one more chapter," he told him, lying back on the pillows.
“Krum is the most overrated seeker of all time," Harry said confidently.
"What? Why?"
"And instead you get married with him ... and not ..."
She nodded. "It wasn't the first," she added after a moment and Draco realized how hollow her cheeks were and how pale her face was. He had no doubt that Granger hadn't slept a single minute. It took a few seconds to realize that there was something different about her.
The warm sun on the skin, the taste of salt on the lips, the wind in the hair. He opened his eyes again when a dolphin leaped beside the boat. He couldn't believe he wasn't in England. He glanced at the former Slytherin at the helm.
And Hermione's expression was a lethal mix of restlessness, worry and pain. For a second, he suspected Crookshanks had died in the night, but then his eyes were drawn to the copy of the Prophet's Gazette that the young witch held tight in her chest.
He ran a hand over his face and through his sweat-soaked hair. Seven days from his birthday. He still had four ... four days in which he felt entitled not to be ashamed if ...
"A couple of hours of climbing. Three with you "replied the former Slytherin, sliding his hands along his chest and stopping them on his waist. He secured a rope to the harness that he had made him wear and made sure it was firm.
"I'll wait here. If you need me, call me "
He had sent an owl to the office to warn he would take the rest of the day off and then one to his mother to warn her that he would visit them in the afternoon. He had taken a hot shower, hoping that the water would be able to wash away all worries.
I said the wrong thing.
What the fuck was he playing at?
Draco's penis was unmistakably hard. It was exciting to feel it through the fabric of his pants.
Then I dreamed that he was chasing me in the street shouting my name.
He made an effort to swallow at least a few sips of orange juice. He watched Pansy take off her light jacket and drape it over the chair. She was wearing the same dress as the night before: a provocative sheath dress that left one shoulder uncovered. She ordered coffee, grimacing as she took off her dark glasses. Even the unmade makeup was that of the previous evening.
The second:
“Does this really have to be a whole production, Potter?”
“You may be good at poker, Malfoy, but Potter’s lucky,” Blaise warned idly as he inspected his nails.
“Wait, I’ve got music,” Harry leapt up like an excited puppy to put an album onto the gramophone, turning it down as not to disturb neighbouring dorms. It was some sort of rock-ish muggle music that Draco didn’t recognise and he gave his lover an incredulous look.
“So you think I’m good looking?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco was already regretting this. He felt a deep burn of humiliation in his stomach and a simmering blush all the way from his face to the back of the neck.
Draco felt as if he had whiplash from this whole situation, and under any other circumstances he probably would’ve up and ran away, but, well... it felt so good to have somebody else touch him for the first time in a good seven months. Also, this wasn’t some guy he didn’t really know anything about he was sucking off while drunk, this was Potter. Potter, who he had just been wanking off to, now grabbing onto his waist like he
“Hey, you alright? This good for you?” Harry’s eyes flicked down in gesture towards where his hand rubbed at his dick. Draco nodded, a bit breathless, before pulling Harry’s free hand and and around to rest on his ass.
“No, I’m actually thinking about Snape right now,” Draco deadpanned. He was unable to not snap back even at a time like this.
“Of fucking course you would say that-
“You saw mine, I get to see yours, it’s only fair,” He stated, moving towards Harry in quick stomps. “Just let me see it and we’ll be even and we can leave this room never having to think about it again,” That was a lie. Draco knew he would never be able to forget the image of Harry’s cock and that it would only serve to make his little
, me and Cho haven’t been a thing in literally ages, Malfoy,” He rebutted, having gotten over the shock of Draco manhandling him in order to crowd himself into the other’s space intimidatingly.
“What?! What am I missing?” The ginger flung his arms up as people broke into peels of laughter around their table at The Leaky Cauldron.
Draco came with a strangled moan of Harry’s name, gripping Harry in a vice-like hold as he shot ribbons of white that made a mess of both their stomachs. The way Draco’s hole clenched down, as if milking Harry’s cock, had him following suit a few seconds later, pumping out his release and making Draco’s dick twitch pathetically in its sensitive, post-orgasm state. Harry bit down on the blonde’s collar bone as he rode out his orgasm, gripping Draco’s hips hard enough to bruise and keeping himself balls deep inside. It wasnt until Harry had let go of his hips, both of them panting as they relaxed onto the bed that Draco spoke.
“Now,”
“I was
“How I was going to have to give you a lap dance before you would fuck me,” Draco replied, making Harry snort.
“He’s been gone for like an hour now, how long does it take to find one arsehole?” Ron grumbled as he placed Hermione’s butter beer in front of her.
Harry stood with his mouth agape, not quite believing the request, eyes searching Draco’s face for a sign that he was joking. After the blonde’s steely glare assured him that he was absolutely deadass, Harry scoffed. “Sure, whatever,” before unfastening his belt and shimmying down his trousers and boxers.
- “Last thing I need is people asking why I’ve got a big fuck off hickey,”
“Shh, ok, let me prep you,” He soothed but Draco shook his head, slapping his hand away and spreading his legs oh so prettily over his length. “I fingered myself before I got here, you don’t have to stretch me,”
a lap dance, ok? You going to let me do that or are you gonna keep interfering?” He raised an eyebrow, leaning down so that their lips were almost touching, Harry letting out a low groan at his tone and a shifting of hips that had Draco rubbing his ass up and down Harry’s cock like he was riding it.
“Hey! You’re one to talk, you gave me a hickey!” Harry chuckled, removing the condom and tying it, flicking it into the waste-paper basket next to his bed.
this was so much better than any fantasy the slytherin could have concocted on his own.
” The blonde stuttered, eyes clenhcing shut as he pictured glasses steamed up and askew, messy hair pulled this way and that by pale hands. Draco thrust up into his own fist, letting out a low, longing moan.
"Now sleep, Potter."
Draco deliberately dropped his gaze to Harry's lips, a long, longing glance, before returning to look him in the eye. "Prove it," he hissed.
He was still lucid enough to understand that he shouldn't have been alone. He got up and wrote only two words on a card.
I took out my wallet when Potter suddenly showed up. The red cheeks from running, the glasses a bit fogged up from being out of breath ...
His room was lit by some candles.
Draco held his hips down with his palms, continuing his exploration with gruelling slowness. His mouth reached everywhere, mapping his body with devotion.
Draco just shook his head, his stomach was completely closed. He paused next to Potter, looking at his profile. Strong jaw, nose with a slight hump where it had been broken too many times. There was nothing perfect about him, but Draco loved every little imperfection.
Draco swallowed hard, again feeling the sensation of wanting to be miles away from here. Maybe their bond was too weak to resist external pressures, they didn't really know if they wanted to continue being married ...
Harry felt his brain short circuit in an attempt to decipher the girl's words. Didn't she just say it?
"We ... will ask for the marriage to be canceled. We were both stoned, don't… won't you want to stay married to
"Fred would make us go home blue"
One moment! Why had Ron and Hermione never told him?
“That ten-foot-long shark on the bottom? I was just wondering when you were going to inform me that there are sharks in these waters, "he replied, propping himself up on his elbows and looking at the horizon.
"Yes, you already said that," Harry replied, eyeing a sports newspaper article. The Cannons had lost. Again. Ron must have been in a bad mood.
He looked around trying to spot Malfoy's blond hair but couldn't see it.
He tilted his head back, closing his hand on Harry's erection, wet with his saliva. They moved their fists quickly, breathing each other's breath. Waves of pleasure followed one another in a whirlwind of excitement. Legs intertwined, Draco was only vaguely aware of how desperate they must look. The uncoordinated movements, the clothes in disorder.
Harry saw anger stir in his gaze, barely concealed by his pimping ways.
"Fuck" he exhaled, "I have to go," he said, heading for the exit.
I'll be good, I swear to you, Santa Claus.
As soon as they felt Harry watched, they stopped immediately.
"No!" Harry shrieked with all his breath.
He is still sleeping, now I go downstairs to make him breakfast. It is the best Christmas morning I've ever had.
"We should have done this years ago," Potter muttered, pulling off the condom and throwing it into an empty potato chip bag.
“A call for help from Malfoy Manor. Red sparks were reported a few minutes ago. No owl has come. "
Ginny was nodding, her lips reduced to a thin line, her cheeks red from the cold wind.
Draco covered his face with his hands and let out a groan. "We will never finish," he said, then brushing his damp and perfect hair back. Harry placed a kiss on his bare shoulder, then stroked his chest with one hand. "You're the one who provoked me," he replied, abandoning himself to the carpet beside him.
I parted my lips and he was there. Big. Hot. And that it tasted absurdly male.
"Good evening, Potter"
“We could have had a nice ceremony at the Burrow… like for Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Even something intimate ... as you would have liked ... "
Hermione slapped him on the arm. Strongly. "You're an idiot. You don't send a bouquet of roses out of kindness. You should have told him how you feel… tell him you miss him. "
He leaned against the wall, an arm around Potter's waist, as he reached the height of pleasure. He moved his fist again and felt Potter melt in his hand after a few moments, his breath against his neck. He slowly ran his palm over his back, enjoying the warmth of his body on his.
His voice broke for a moment and Harry sensed that whatever it was he didn't know how to ask. “I don't want his grave to be devastated someday. I don't even want to keep him with me ... on the fireplace ... he would have hated it, so I thought I'd take his ashes to a place he loved and leave him there ... "
Pause in which I felt myself die.
“One, after he got out. He had cut his wrists, but the doctors managed to stop the bleeding. It was eight days ago. I only left him for a few minutes ... just to ... "Malfoy's voice broke again and a more violent tremor crossed his shoulders.
"I tried! But Roger ... "
"Some flowers?" he replied, not quite sure it was the right answer.
Harry let out a groan, his penis reacting enthusiastically to Malfoy's movements and words.
I casually went to the Auror section today. Okay, coincidentally it means that I take every opportunity to pass by and that I stay nearby a lot more than I should to be able to see it.
All the fireplaces in Grimmauld Place were lit but somehow the frost had crept through the plaster, cloaking the house in a solid and heavy sadness.
Harry had spent the evening in agitation. He'd done a quick search on his phone, but couldn't figure out what Hermione had bought for Draco Malfoy. It still seemed crazy to him. Eventually, he got dressed and headed to the academy gym. At that time of night it was deserted. He had put on the boxing gloves and started training.
"Why do you think I'm gay?"
"Oh, I feel it ..." he murmured, arching his head back a little to give him free access to his neck. Harry followed the line of his throat with his lips as the ringing of the bell startled him.
Draco ran his fingers over his sweat-soaked forehead. “Don't think about it now. The curse isn't serious, it's just very painful, ”he added, taking a chair and dragging it to the side of the bed, not releasing Harry's hand.
"And how is it going ... with the undeniably attractive guy?" Harry whispered, feeling him stop just below his navel. Malfoy touched a now faded scar on his abdomen with his tongue, ripping out another low moan, before looking at him.
The Ravenclaw's face twisted into an angry expression and his nostrils dilated. Harry puckered a corner of his mouth, trying hard not to laugh. Okay, the guy whose name started with M ... or maybe S ... was really pissed.
"Offer you breakfast?"
Malfoy looked away for a few seconds before looking back at him. "We will hurt each other"
He crumpled the newspaper and flung it into the fireplace. That story would last a couple of days and then everyone would forget it. There was no need to worry.
Seen? Calm and assertive. With dogs it worked. Even with three-headed dogs.
"Perfect ... you are perfect ..." he whispered, as I began to move. I reached down and brushed his lips. But he bit me. A strong nasty bite that stole a gasp from me. I parted my lips more and Harry stuck his tongue in my mouth.
Dear Santa Claus,
“Take all the notes,” he said, handing the ones in his hand to Kreacher, “go around the shops and settle all the bills. The money is in the trunk in my room, "he ordered. "And don't ..." stopped him before the creature had time to fade "Don't punish yourself if you can't convince them to accept the money" he recommended and then dematerialized.
He pulled his wand out of his pocket and dematerialized, reappearing shortly after in front of Malfoy Manor.
Harry felt stupidly happy. The aching body, the sheets that smelled of sex. He stretched lazily on the mattress, reaching out his arms to fill the entire bed. Draco must have already gotten up.
Harry nodded to a couple of recruits, who had paused for a moment outside his office door. He finished stacking parcels of documents to be checked on the side of the desk and was about to go home when he saw an Auror swiftly pass by and headed for the office of McKenzie, the night shift manager.
Draco arched an eyebrow, leaning his shoulder against the door jamb. He inhaled the good scent of coffee, watching Harry's fingers grab the handles of two cups. They were long, strong. Draco had never known he had such masculine hands.
Draco was on the verge of replying that he had already gotten everything he wanted by tonight and that he wasn't there to be a couple. Potter took off his uniform jacket and hung it in the wardrobe at the entrance. Then he headed for the kitchen. Draco watched him turn on the light above the stove and roll up his sleeves.
Harry nodded. "A kind of friend".
Malfoy narrowed his eyes and Harry was sure he was about to put a curse on him, but the rush of anger subsided into a more submissive expression.
"And how the hell ..."
"Let's talk about it inside" he said "please"
"I do not know!" Harry interrupted him. "But I'm sure it was you who spread this rumor ... and the photos ..."
"Have a nice trip, dad," he murmured.
"What do you mean?"
"Can I offer you some tea?" she asked putting the kettle on the fire. Draco suspected that she was doing it to keep her hands busy and to hide the expression on her face. The cottage looked neat, but Draco knew his parents hadn't been able to find a single house elf who wanted to work in their service and had been forced to hire Muggles, who didn't know who they were. Yet another humiliation for his father. If only he hadn't been so broken, he probably would have reacted much more violently to that news.
“What you did for me… the night my father died… I'll never forget it, but everything that happened after that was a big mistake. Let's look at it as an isolated incident and close it here, ”Malfoy said.
"It's not funny, Potter"
He and Malfoy had suddenly found themselves ignited by the same rivalry that had distinguished them at Hogwarts, which resulted in incitements to their team and imaginative insults aimed at that rival.
"To whom do I dedicate it?" he said, recording the delightful way in which the blond curls brushed her cheek.
He shook his head as if annoyed by a fly, looking up at the former Slytherin.
Dear Santa Claus
"Is this what you think? That I would be pissed about a dinner?"
Harry found Draco standing in the hall of Malfoy Manor. Hands on hips, wand in hand, aristocratic frown on his face, he was directing two miserable house elves hanging a Christmas festoon.
"Do you want me to come with you this afternoon to your parents?"
Harry got up and walked to the door. He had already gone out into the corridor when a thought made him freeze. He turned to his friend, who had tied her hair using a pencil as a clip. "How did you know where to send what you bought?" Harry asked.
"You ... you can't give him anything ..." Draco muttered.
Harry frowned. "Malfoy?" he hissed as he blotted out the distance that separated him from Roger and grabbed his jacket. He let out a moan like a kitten's meow.
"Your elf told me to wake you up," Draco replied, sitting down next to him and crossing his ankles over each other. Harry dug deeper into the blankets.
Harry narrowed his gaze, watching Draco's mouth move but without really being able to grasp what he was saying.
"What?"
Draco shook his head. "There is only one way to speed things up ..." he murmured. "I have to go to Potter."
"... two beers for me and my friend"
"Kreacher" he called aloud, going down the stairs and reaching the kitchen, where a good aroma of stew came from.
He smiled again, pointing to the glass he already had in his hand. But how idiotic can I be on a scale of 1 to 2 billion billion? Here, in fact. Even you, dear Santa Claus, call me an idiot.
He had outlived Voldemort, he could safely have sex without worrying about a psychopathic Hufflepuff breaking into the room.
McKenzie looked at him for a moment, his brow furrowed. "Potter, are you already ..."
Harry just turned his head to look at him. Crazy. It was the only adjective he could use to describe the situation. For a moment he considered asking him to put on sunscreen. He smiled slightly, shaking his head and mentally calling himself an idiot.
"You have to prepare me," whispered the former Slytherin, moistening his fingers with the lubricant.
“I'm not dating Draco Malfoy. I'm just doing him a favor, ”he declared, looking at Hermione.
He waited for the words to take effect. He saw a rush of color turn purple in his mother's waxy cheeks. She looked him in the eye for the first time. Her hands began to tremble violently again. "What?" she repeated in a whisper.
She gently squeezed his arm, seeking his gaze with her own.
Help me, Santa Claus. I don't want Harry anymore, now I just want to forget about his existence.
"Y-yes" whispered the former Slytherin, staring now at his lips now at his eyes. Harry licked his jaw, then descended on his neck and savored the brackish water and his skin that tasted so hopelessly of him.
"Have you seen it?" Mafoy asked, taking off his mask and snorkel. A few salty drops fell from his body, crashing into Harry's legs.
I hate places that are too crowded. I just wanted to hold onto Potter's chest and be protected by his strong arms.
Draco pulled his head back and kissed him, a fusion of breaths and languages. Everything with Potter was uncontrollable. Whether they punched each other or fucked brutally. Potter's frantic movements, his hard cock… Draco loved being fucked by him.
Draco pulled the sheet back and looked at his chest. The curse still throbbed, sending waves of pain down Harry's nerve endings. "The wound is already healing," he assured. "Your body is reacting well, it will probably take less than two hours"
Draco moaned with pleasure, arching his back a bit as Potter traced a trail of kisses along his jaw. His fingers undid his shirt, stroking his chest. When his leg slipped between Draco's and his knee gently rubbed his groin, Draco thought he would come like a fucking teenager.
Draco's skin was silky and smooth, but underneath he could feel the solidity of his muscles.
"Let an old lady dream" she said, stroking his forearm. "Is it something serious?"
He raised his plate high as three children darted past him. The Barrow was full of voices, food and children running all over the place.
I withdrew as quickly as possible, heart in pieces.
"You need to rest, Potter," replied the former Slytherin slowly stroking his arms.
"Mom, please ... I know it's unexpected news but ..."
"We'll find out tomorrow on the front page of the Daily Prophet," Harry replied, raising his head just to be able to touch his jaw with his lips. "Next time you find out you want to give me a blowjob while you run ..." he added, his green eyes sparkling with desire and amusement.
"Hey," he said, handing him some encouraging little packets on his back, which prompted Draco to snuggle up against him. "What happened?" he muttered, holding it tight.
I waited all afternoon for him to send me a note to find out if I was okay. Or to tell me that I had caught him off guard but that he too felt the same.
Anyway, I was walking back to the office and my mood was bad. Last night I masturbated thinking about Harry until I broke down with exhaustion and this morning, I just wanted to wake up next to him.
Of course I immediately forgot the name.
"What can I do?"
Thanks for everything, I am a happy person thanks to you.
And not even the only guy so handsome and strong. I'll find someone much better than him, the sea, after all, is full of fish.
Narcissa Malfoy was a beautiful fifty-year-old lady with an exquisite taste in dress. She welcomed him like a queen, the table surrounded by bags and pouches. Draco kissed her on the cheek, asking if she was going shopping.
“Don't get arrested. I need you here "
So, this year I'm asking you this: will you give me a chance with Harry Potter?
"Doing it ... I was tireless ..."
Draco announced that he was going to take a shower and then made his way quickly to the bathroom before doing something very stupid, like kissing him again or snuggling against his back.
Draco angrily crumpled the note and threw it into the fireplace. He undid his shirt and slid it off his shoulders. He wondered if Potter had undressed him ...
"I didn't kill Roger," he confessed, looking back at the former Slytherin.
"Hands up. Put them where we can see them "shouted the Auror behind him.
His gray eyes were watering, but it was hard to tell if it was the glare of the sun or the moment. "Not many people would have done what you did for me," Malfoy whispered, placing a hand to the side of his neck and for a moment Harry wished his hands weren't covered by the gloves.
“I know, sorry I didn't warn you earlier… but Harry isn't a guest, he's my husband. We got married last week. "
Harry wanted to ask him to stay, not to leave him alone… not to judge him for what he had done, but he didn't need to. The former Slytherin returned to his room and observed him clinically, before reaching out to him. Harry shivered again as his palm touched his cheek, his thumb running up his cheekbone. For a second he thought he would give in… that he would start screaming and never stop.
"I do not know!" Hermione shouted. "Your jeans ..."
Malfoy smelled absurdly good. And his expression was so scared. So… docile and in need of protection.
He watched him sleep, his bare chest barely covered by the sheets. One arm behind the head. His chest was also incredibly comfortable. The scar barely visible through the hair. Draco smiled faintly, feeling only partially stupid as no one could see him. He reached out a finger and lightly touched his skin. He made his hand adhere to his collarbone and took a deep breath of his scent.
"Harry" groaned the former Slytherin, pinning him with a look full of need.
She gave a vague gesture with her hand, dismissing the subject.
Harry pulled him towards him, his arm naturally adapting to Draco's waist. “It already hurt you once. I don't want that to happen again "
They reappeared shortly afterwards at Grimmauld Place, 12. Harry helped Draco take off his coat and their eyes met again. Draco seemed to come to his senses, as if focusing on his face for the first time. "It wasn't necessary ..." he murmured, tightening his grip around the bag's buckle.
“Look, in this story you earn too! I'm making you become a perfect boyfriend! "
He had been one of the first to arrive and it was he who had killed the werewolf.
Draco had the decency to look down as he listened to Hermione's hurt voice. He knew why Potter had said nothing: their marriage was a farce and as soon as the documents were sent it would be over ...
Draco closed his eyes, deeply inhaling the smell of wet grass. Usually it was Potter who faced situations without thinking, the one who wasn't afraid to throw himself headlong into anything ... he had been more and more thoughtful, more controlled ...
In the end he had put on a more or less decent sweater, more or less clean jeans, made his hair look at least tolerable, and showed up on time at Malfoy Manor.
“I'm not sure,” he muttered, making sure no one was listening to them. She moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue, leaning towards her friend. "If I told you ..." he began cautiously "That this morning I woke up with a naked man in my bed ..."
"Harry," Draco whispered as if he were purring.
Thanks,
I just want to know who that guy is! And I want to be in his place! I want Harry to laugh at my jokes, I want him to look at me with adoring eyes, I want him to love me.
And most of all, I'm horny.
He ran up the stairs, Pansy behind him, black boots tapping the floor. He stopped a nurse and asked her where Harry Potter was hospitalized. “I'm… his husband,” he muttered, struggling to get the words out.
Harry dipped his fingers in his hair, keeping his face close to him. "I don't want to be here," he said urgently. "I don't want to stay in the hospital ... take me home"
He let out a faint grunt, hearing the former Slytherin force him to move his arm so he could settle more comfortably against him.
"No ... I don't want to leave my father ..."
It was very different than touching Ginny. There were no soft depressions ... sweet and fruity aromas ...
He decided to go on, pretending to have a love life.
Sign of assent. Smile. Sip of tea.
Draco's cheeks turned a violent red and his lips twisted into an outraged expression. "That's not the point," he replied, unable to deny. "The point is ..."
Harry frowned, feeling a tingling sensation on the back of his neck.
Harry let out a long sigh and tried to call him back, but Malfoy didn't even answer him.
He had wide eyes, unkempt hair.
His parents had moved to an estate in the countryside. His mother hated it from the bottom of his heart, but his father had found a new identity in the old aristocrat deep in the English countryside.
He nodded a little while Malfoy poured them both more scotch. “My father was cremated. I should…"
If you like, leave a comment or a kudos, please :-)
Harry ducked abruptly, avoiding the swinging sail. He grabbed the rope, following Malfoy's instructions. The sailboat leaned more to the side, for a moment it seemed suspended in a limbo of time, then took the wake of the wind and gained speed. Harry closed his eyes, tilting his head back a little.
He called his barn owl and tied the papers to his leg, advising him to be careful and not to lose them. He had quickly closed the window, pretending it wasn't all that important. He and Potter had enjoyed it, but… he just shook his head, sitting back at his desk.
It had been a long and tiring day. The rain had fallen all afternoon, making the ground slick and slippery. More than one Auror had fallen badly to the ground. The search for the missing girl had begun two hours after her parents' report and fortunately ended before dark when the girl was found. She hid in the hollow of a tree after realizing she had lost the path and her parents. She suffered from the onset of hypothermia but had no injuries or trauma. Harry felt exhausted.
"Mr. Malfoy, an urgent message for you," said one of the waiters, handing him a note. Draco opened it without recognizing the handwriting.
"He entered the house," he murmured, his fingers buried in Harry's arms as if he were afraid of being torn away from him.
“You have to stay away from him. Or I'll destroy you! " the guy shouted so loudly that he risked bursting his coronaries. "I destroy you, Potter!"
"Can you tell me ..."
Ginny nodded affirmatively, swinging her legs limply. "Did he tell you the surname?"
"He ignores you because he asked you out and you kept him on the line for months to get free drinks"
And Harry made a guttural, almost animal-like sound, which immediately reverberated on my dick, causing it to contract hard. I was sucking it off.
I'm going to go to the Auror section of the Ministry and face Harry Potter.
In the end that afternoon hadn't gone badly. Malfoy had been quiet and good by his side, pausing from time to time to look at a window.
"Come on, tell me everything." she said, throwing her hair back.
"I knew you were looking at me," Draco replied, bending down just a little to be able to kiss him. Harry's hand caressed the base of his back. Draco was on the verge of purring when Harry stepped back to look closely at him.
Harry barely bit his lower lip. "So, I'm scared ... but however absurd and hasty this situation may seem ..."
Dear Santa Claus,
I am writing to you on behalf of our client, Mr. Santa Claus, to inform you that it is our intention to proceed legally if you do not immediately stop sending letters addressed to our client.
Three weeks ago, I met this person at the Ministry and by chance I noticed the lighter mark of the leather bracelet on his wrist, as if he had recently tanned. I heard… again by chance… that he was signing the sales documents for the family home and indicated his new address on the form.
"I can't let you in, gentlemen," the doctor was saying, forbidding them to break into the ward.
"Oh no," Harry sobbed in horror.
"Uh uh uh ... so things are getting serious?" Ginny asked.
He stopped at the beginning of the corridor. He clenched his fists at his hips when he saw a group of Aurors talking animatedly with a female doctor.
Harry let out a small hiccup as Malfoy flipped positions again and sat on him, stifling his complaints with another long kiss.
I went to a club last night with Pansy and Blaise. Pansy complained about that incompetent bastard of her boss and swallowed one drink after another, without realizing that her skirt had risen well beyond the line of holy decency and was offering a captivating glimpse of the lace edge of her stockings. Blaise was in a hilarious mood, which means a step above mourning. He kept babbling about a holiday he is planning for his partner's birthday and… Okay, but who cares about Zabini.
I looked at it without understanding. "Being together" he continued "We will spend most of the time arguing ..."
Malfoy shut up instantly.
"From how happy my mother is, I think she has at least one characteristic of a French Pureblood stallion," said the former Slytherin, Malfoy was witty, bitterly funny as only someone who can see reality objectively can be. Harry was able to appreciate him, at least until he was the subject of his jokes, which still happened very often.
Were there straight jeans and gay jeans? Why had no one ever explained it to him?
There it is, the tone of
So we're together now. I mean officially.
Harry sat across from him and charmed a feather to record what Malfoy would say. The former Slytherin hadn't looked him in the face yet, he still had that bewildered look that Harry had learned to recognize in people in shock.
"Hey," she shouted, "He touched her butt," she yelled and then loaded her right hand and slammed it into the face of a reporter.
He requisitioned the stranger’s wand and then tied him like salami.
Harry felt the adrenaline invade his veins, the thrill of the chase making his hair stand on end.He licked his lips, sinking his hand into the pocket of his jacket and tightening his fingers around the wand.
“My father was a member of one of the oldest mountaineering associations. He was… incredible. He always knew which was the most correct point of support, the way to tackle a rocky wall ... I was trying to keep up with him, but ... "
Draco
Finally, Potter sat down on the coffee table in front of him. Harry studied his expression for a few moments before sighing silently. He put his hands on his legs and Draco winced.
"And have sex," I said and he laughed.
But this time it's different! I will be happy to have Potter. I mean ... a happy forever.
"What did you tell him?"
"Can you go now?" he articulated, daring to look at him again. Potter was turning away from him and Draco couldn't help but notice some red marks on his skin. He looked away again, wondering if he had been the one to give them. For a moment he imagined Potter pushing himself inside him ... fucking him with the same enthusiasm with which they had always hated each other ...
"I won," he said, supporting himself at the low gate.
"I'm sorry ... I wanted to tell you ..."
There it is, his worst nightmare. It wasn't enough for Malfoy to ruin his waking life, now he had to sneak into his dreams too.
Draco came violently, his body shaking with spasms. He grabbed a handkerchief and cleaned himself up. His heart thundered in his ears. Potter's spicy taste like a distant echo on his tongue.
