"Do any of you has idea about this potion? No one?" Snape said silkily, the enthusiasm in his eyes prominent upon seeing the confusion on everyone's faces and not seeing Hermione's hand in the air. "Of course, you would not know this particular potion as this is not in your Advance Potions textbook... yet."
Aside from the fact that the Sedatus takes all of one's mental energy, Harry felt so burnt-out dealing with a person who was very unpredictable and close to being unhinged. Draco had been quiet and subdued when they came back to Hogwarts. But lunch proved to be more strenuous than he could imagine. Draco had been agreeable when Harry suggested they sit with Gryffindors, but he all but switched when they were actually surrounded by Harry's friends. If he wasn't being a total git by ordering Harry to spoon-fed him, he would began giving Ron an earful about proper table etiquette and chastising Hermione for bringing books on the table and for being an "insufferable know-it-all", all while merrily flicking bits of food to Neville's downtrodden face.
Everywhere he went, he could see the back of Draco's blond hair, glowing in the sunlight that streamed through the window in which he sat by, looking up to listen to Professor Flitwick demonstrating the quite complex wand work of one of the variations of Atmospheric Charms and alternately ducking down to jot some notes down. Or Harry could see him dueling with Zabini during DADA, his wand stretched out in front of him in its defensive posture, his position regal and stiff yet he moved with swiftness and grace that only Draco could pull off as Zabini cast an array of offensive spells at him. Or Harry could see him sitting across the Great Hall in lunch, talking to his Slytherin friends, his face impassive even as his friends were laughing all around him.
of Malfoy's cartilage against the brunt of his fist. He was never really one for physical violence. Years of being Dudley's punching bag had gave him its ugly firsthand account. But Harry's anger had hit him full force. Violence had been an instinctive response after seeing the self-loathe and regret in Malfoy's face.
Harry paced three times in front of the bare wall until a door materialized. Wordlessly, he entered, slamming the door shut in his ire. It was very rude and outright immature of him to act this way. He could remember how much he hated when Malfoy strutted in all his aristocratic glory, being the pretentious bully who thought he was above all else, purposefully being nasty to his friends just to annoy him. He despised
Harry has no way of knowing since Draco was great at putting levels of façade. Even if he's starting to tell it's all a pretense, Harry couldn't see through the extent of his disguises. If what he saw in the blond's mesmerizing grey eyes was to be believed as the truth, then Harry, for the life of him, wanted to break down the barricades of Occlumency and see behind the inherent Malfoy mask.
“It’s not a problem, and you’re not pathetic,” Draco said, reassuringly. “I understand the feeling of being afraid to show emotions. But it’s completely normal. Well, as normal as the Boy-Who-Lived can be. We were ought to express it, lest we feel like a walking, breathing husk.” He felt like he was baring his soul to Harry as much as Harry was wearing his heart on his sleeve. “You are not pathetic, and certainly not weak for having them. We were just born from circumstances that forced us to pretend we haven’t.”
Malfoy continued writing the ingredients and processes of both potions on his parchment, not acknowledging Harry's presence as if it were something not worth overreacting for (at least for the dramatic git's part). He just continued... writing.
"Okay, Draco," Harry tried to make his voice sound as amicable as possible. "I'm just surprised. You haven't informed me beforehand."
Draco just held him tighter, lips near his ear, whispering words that were lost on Harry. Harry gripped the front of Draco's shirt, swamped with excruciating agony, wheezing and choking at the heavily nauseating lump in his throat.
Potter who had repeatedly defeated him in Quidditch, Potter who had a bunch of worshippers at his beck and call, Potter who was better at him in every single thing!
"Don't be silly, Harry," Hermione rolled her eyes. "Of course we're not. I mean, it's Malfoy," at that Ron grinned at her, "and I'm still a bit skeptical when it comes to him. But if Malfoy can bring you there, can comfort you, why would we be against it?"
Harry squirmed in his seat. It was a good thing the armchair felt soft and comfy, not like the ones in Snape’s office that left his backside aching after the seemingly endless hours of detention.
But he was no more Malfoy; at least for Harry. The Malfoy Harry knew was just one of the many masks that Draco inherently wore, probably a defense mechanism or to build a statement for himself. The Draco in front of Harry, even though layered with so many sides Harry is yet to discover, is not the Malfoy that sputtered Pureblood ideals and mock anyone base on their appearance, blood, and wealth.
were, obviously, just Saturnine's compiled memoirs from his ancient diary. He was the greatest tyrant in the fictional universe of
A prophesied hero, a demigod of the lowest kind, Warden the Illustrious, came to destroy Saturnine's pursuits of reigning over the universe. But during the fateful face-off, there was a red string of fate that connected his heart to Warden, which the Illustrious had cut off mercilessly. Since then, Saturnine forgot his plans to take over Nirvana and pursue the hard-hearted Warden instead, which the hero always turn down. Hence, the morose poetry.
Hermione soundly closed her mouth when Parkinson pinched her side as she opened her mouth for another on her dogmatic tangents. She seethed in her chair and Parkinson offered to comfort her with a wry pat on her shoulder.
, Potter?" A shrilly, sarcastic voice sounded behind him. Pansy Parkinson stood there, face soured in disgust. With Draco Malfoy beside her.
Harry realized, with a dawning horror, that he doesn't want Ron and Hermione to see him in this state, no matter how much he trusted them. Ironically, Draco Malfoy, his rival which he shared a seven-year history of animosity with, was on his bed, just beseeched him out of his emotional melt down. Harry stared unseeingly at Draco Malfoy talking gently to him, his words went unheard to Harry.
intentionally?" At Hermione's stern glare, Ron rushed to add, "why haven't you voiced this before? We would've been saved from being
"I was repeatedly calling you. What are you even staring—" she turned to the direction Harry was initially paying all his attention to. Immediately her face fell sour. "Malfoy? Why are you staring at the evil git?"
"Where do you think we'd brew the potion?" Harry asked before the awkward silence could get any worse. To his surprise, Malfoy only shrug his sharp shoulders. "What can you suggest?" Again, another shrug. It's starting to really piss Harry off. "The Room of Requirements, then."
There was a muted noise in the classroom as students began choosing their partners, before Snape shut down everyone's ideas, "I will be choosing your partners since this will be a part of Inter-House cooperation activity." That had everyone silently grumbling before the Professor snapped. "Since this is your term project, this will affect a large portion of your grade. I will not think twice to give you an automatic T if you will not cooperate with your designated partners.
Harry remembered the Draco that was crying in Myrtle's bathroom, the Draco that was sobbing in his chest last night. He was hit with the realization that he didn't knew Draco at all. Malfoy, the stuck up, egotistical git, he knew. Draco was a different person.
It was middle of Sunday morning when they finished brewing. They had already imbibed the Histrionicus potions respectively and it instantly kicked into effect. Harry could feel the Sedatus flowing in his system, and he felt like the calmest he had ever been in a long time. Turning to his partner though, Harry knew Draco was everything but calm. There's a barely-there flicker of worry that thrums through Harry, simmering beneath the calming thrall of the Sedatus.
"Don't be such a git, Draco," Harry said mildly, shaking his head up at the blond fondly, before pulling him down beside him. Draco grunted but Harry shoved a sandwich in his mouth. "I planned all this for you, you should at least be thankful."
Draco’s face was too hard to decipher in the muted moonlight that managed to pass through his flimsy bed hangings. But Harry was sure, now that the Sedatus had left his system, Draco effortlessly slipped back to his emotionless doll façade, just like he always did. Harry could only vaguely see Draco’s quicksilver eyes, they were unusually bright and they were staring down at him.
It’s hardly Advance Potion. After the kiss and the small realization during the Mind-Healing session, it’s just obvious that Harry wouldn’t be able to keep Draco out of his mind.
"Yeah. With me," he gulped when Draco gaped at him. "I mean, if you want to. I have- er, a blanket. And of course, a pillow. If you... want. I'm not—"
, a place where different species (angels, devils, vampires, werewolves, demigods, faeries, mermaids, etc.) from different dimensions co-exist together under the Social Treaty. Saturnine is a Death Lord of a Higher Deity that is spiteful in nature, evil and downright bigoted who wanted to destroy the Social Treaty so that Nirvana would be under his regime and subsequently lord over the remaining dimensions.
"Advantageous?" Minerva asked, her usually grim face slightly pinched in confusion. "I fail to see how this would be of any advantage. The potion could augment... certain emotions that might prove... destructive to both parties."
There was a drive in Harry, brought on by the mediating potion, to please Draco and to satisfy him. But the weirdest part is that it didn't felt like it was forced. Harry totally enjoyed calming Draco down, to touch his hands, to cling to him. He didn't felt like a slave to the helpless urge; but rather, the helpless urge seemed like a subconscious commitment.
Harry spent almost two hours under the relaxing spray of the shower. He need not to worry about the remaining hot water since he's the only one who use the bathroom every morning, his roommates always ended up sleeping in. Probably due to exhausting activities late night or lying awake until the dawn broke.
"Well, I did not say that both the parties would consume the same potion, did I?" Severus said, his eyes glinting happily—or as happy as Severus Snape could get. Albus stared at the Potions Master in appraisal, the twinkle in his eyes is back.
“What is that for, Granger?” Draco snapped, glaring at the bushy-haired witch. “I don’t have anytime for this sodding—”
Harry was deprived from choosing whether it should be wise to approach or not when Draco started to talk.
As Harry stared at Malfoy's side profile expectantly, waiting for him to sneer at his way, Harry thought it was not forthcoming. There will be no verbal disputes between them, just like there was no Malfoy intentionally bumping him on the corridor just to get a rise out of him since the start of term.
"Really Pansy?" Malfoy sneered, the disgust shining brightly in his grey eyes. "Frolicking with the filthy, know-it-all Mudblood. Couldn't you sink any lower?"
"Malfoy," Harry said, wincing upon hearing his voice sounding harsh. Malfoy seemed to pick up on this and tensed. With a much softer voice that he could muster, he repeated, "Malfoy. Look at me."
Malfoy meekly nodded and Harry made a mistake of staring up at Malfoy's eyes. Harry found the blond's eyes so deep and mesmerizing, it was more silver than grey with the firelight from the candelabra reflecting off the glassy surface, with golden specks surrounding the slowly dilating pupil. Harry was confused why he doesn't want to look away, or why he felt being drawn to the eyes that only looked at him with malice and disdain in the past.
“What the bloody fuck does that even mean?” Draco grumbled, fending them off his bed and fixing it, making sure no remainders of their indecorous assignations left, casting discreet cleaning charms to be sure, before sneering at his best friend. “I have you know my bed is not available for your profane engagements, Pansy. Kindly stay away from my personal properties, most specially where I sleep.”
Harry didn't pay enough attention to see Parkinson's sneer and Zabini's thoughtful look as the Slytherins left the Gryffindor dorm room, or Hermione and Ron's knowing and concerned stares. Harry fell back in his bed, mind detached, fingers still gripping the wet cloth.
"This was a place that I thought would be a nice hideout from when father invited his elite friends over. Dobby seemed to be overly fascinated by the nature," Draco said, his voice soft and quiet as if afraid to disturb the magically entrancing ambience that surrounded them. "He used to accompany me here, before father knew about our foolish dallying, that is. We played in the mud like uncivilized louts, Dobby using his magic to build me my childhood-dream castle. I would push him to the creek, and then the odd creature will pretend to drown and I would save him, but not before casting a charm to keep me afloat. In fact, he was the one to teach me how to swim, no matter how barmy that sounded."
"Wow," Draco huffed a laugh, his cheeks flushing. "Harry Potter complementing me! Never see this day would come."
When they were left in solitude in the middle of the hallway, Harry sighed deeply, feeling like all his energy had deserted him. He slightly leaned against Malfoy's body not giving a single shit about their very,
The first time he awoke, the world was still dark, if the little moonlight that managed to seep through his gauzy bed hangings is any indication. His eyes were gritty and he was too sleep-addled to find his wand and cast a
“How are you feeling, Harry?” Dianne asked him after a few moments of silence. Harry looked at her and shrugged.
"I couldn't believe Snape have not care to fix such compromising imprecision!" She continued, bushy hair getting wilder as she attempted to flip it before falling back down her face. "For whatever clinical trials he had boasted, this project seemed to be bordering on slavery. He disregarded the discrepancies of the human emotions and how it would be an antecedent for jeopardizing the person's constitutional rights to autonomy!"
Draco looks comfortable and dainty, yet still managed to look prim even when uncharacteristically slouched. Harry could see the tip of his tongue poking out and the minute frown on his brows; he wondered how Draco made such a bland position be fetching to look at.
"For the information of your asinine mind, I have gotten an explicit authorization from the Minister himself, you foolish boy," Severus sneered back, his weariness on Draco's never-ending tirade was obvious on his sallow face. "If you—"
Malfoy looked like he has something to say. But before he could, Harry punched him straight in his pointy, ferrety face.
“Is this what you came here for? To prove to yourself that you’re fucking right at everything? Well, you were. You always were right, Potter. I’m a death eater scum, I pledged my allegiance to the fucking madman to save my own skin, and you were right at your assumptions. Why don’t you slice me again? And this time, you should make sure that I’m going to be killed because Death Eater scums deserve to fucking die.”
Unless if Snape miraculously decided to be rational for once, realize that Harry and James Potter are two entirely different persons and learn to bury his childish grievances.
His bitter fifteen year old self that had been amplified by the potion went wild at the prospect of having power to do anything to Potter. Now that his arch rival was unwary and trusting, there had been so much that he wanted to do to this idiotic Gryffindor that he had no chance to carry out before.
"Of course, I haven't," Draco short of snapped. He exhaled, physically reigning in his temper, and looked apologetic at Narcissa's slightly affronted face. "It's not surprising to have difficulties relaxing amid this...very importunate political affairs. After all, you're all alone here. With only wards away from jeopardy."
"You shouldn't hide behind all these masks, Draco," Harry whispered. He belatedly realised he was moving closer and they were inches away from each other. But he didn't move away, and neither did Draco. "I don't know if it's necessary for you to be this impassive and subdued, like a fucking porcelain doll. Probably a Slytherin thing. But just like this, so open... you look so good. You should laugh more often."
Harry was hit with a painful nostalgia as he stepped beside her, getting a whiff of her faint floral cologne. Her gentle scent seemed to trigger the memories from those chaste times. Harry recalled the giddy rush of an innocent, fresh relationship before the war had ruthlessly destroyed it. Those times felt like lightyears away; both of them were too young and naive and trying to forget the impending doom that loomed over them. His heart felt heavy in his chest as he encased her in a hug.
Draco wouldn’t thought of being this vulnerable, pouring his heart out easily to anyone, much less to Harry Potter. But that’s what’s beautiful about the amalgamation of Sedatus and Augmentare. No matter how much he loathed Severus and refused to speak to him at the moment, he couldn’t help but appreciate the exquisite beauty of the Histrionicus Potion. If it weren’t for the ingenuously sadistic mind of his godfather, Harry wouldn’t have had recovered from his fear of expressing his emotions. And Draco wouldn’t have had the chance to be gripped with the hauntingly beautiful weight of all the emotions brimming in his chest that he pretended he doesn’t have his whole life.
It all clicked to Harry. He now understood why Draco was being strange upon coming to eight year, why he'd lost his derisive sneers and sharp scowls, why he was oddly docile and agreeable, like a doll programmed to yield at every command. By the things that happened in his childhood and Voldemort's reign in Malfoy manor, it was just expected that he lost all his masks and showed what he truly is; someone who readily submit and acquiesce.
Potter who saved him from the Fiendfyre, which was supposed to be Draco's death. Potter who was the reason for his and his mother's acquittal.
Draco snarled at Ginny, the hurt and anger in his face were apparent. Before he could do anything though, Harry curled up closer to the blond to ground both of them.
"Wait for me in the Common Room. And wear some bloody shoes," Harry gritted. There was a muffled padding across the floor before the door opened then closed.
I've always felt strongly about any kind of abuse and bully (maybe bec i've been bullied myself before). And Dumbledore's intentions in the canon of Harry being put in the Dursley's, literally leaving him in their doorstep, ignoring the years of abuse and bully Harry had gone through under his wretched relatives' roof was kind of... preposterous for me. I mean??? All that abuse for some bloody wards??? Lmao i don't even understand. And let's not really get into the whole fifth yr fiasco where Dumbledore 'had to' ignore Harry because he was afraid the dark lord might be spying on him through Harry. It was fucked up and it had my blood boiling in anger really
"Or it's because there's only so much Dark Magic one can endure," Hermione mused. "Premature death of geriatric causes is not unprecedented when one dabbles with Dark Arts. The longer a witch or wizard trifles with Dark Magic the longer its essence wounds around their Magical Core, thus, weakening it, and by extension, their body cells which exposes the person to terminal diseases. I even read about the Dark Arts speeding up a human's life span..."
"What?" Ron asked, face pinched as if torn whether he would vomit or rage. "My sister Ginny with Pansy Parkinson... I never thought she'd swing that way."
"I'm a fucking mess, am I? I caused so much trouble today. You even see me," he paused, clearly uncomfortable recounting what their day had been, "losing myself, which is so unbefitting. I even went so far as to steal your wand to cast... Unforgivables," he whispered the last word in horror, face paling in nausea. "And I dragged you to my father's funereal, which is just so insensitive. Merlin, Harry. I'm so, so sorry—"
"No one deserved to die, Draco," Harry said vehemently. "And I'm not saying that because of some sense of Gryffindor righteousness. I said it and stand by it because that's what a decent human should think! He's a criminal, but he doesn't deserved it any more than you and I do."
“Don’t be so selfish, Draco,” Pansy snickered, helping Ginevra up. She pulled the discarded jumper off the end of the bed and covered her indecency before turning to him fully. “We’re utilizing our available resources.”
“What am I doing here?” Draco growled lowly. “What are you doing here? Let me guess: are you afraid that I’m up to something again?” He stepped closer, looming over Harry. Harry tried not to show his guilt, but it was proving difficult as he can’t breathe with their sudden proximity, the kiss suddenly flashing in his mind. “What? You think I’m that stupid to make the same mistake of following orders’ from a madman, like my equally mad father? Or do something crazy like resurrecting Voldemort and gather his followers for a fucking new world order?”
Harry started. Even if he wasn't really being subtle with his staring, he made no effort in making his presence known and merely contented himself with watching Draco work. Without his knowing, Harry walked toward him and sat beside him. Draco didn't look up, still focused on his essay, but he also didn't tell him to bugger off so Harry relax in his chair. The small distance between them didn't deter him from staring some more, enticed with Draco's sharp jaw and long nose, the tiny details of his face now that he's closer.
The other two pairs were involved in their own bubbles. Zabini was trying to sneer at Ron disgustingly, but every time Ron said something, Zabini would laugh uncontrollably only to glare at the redhead again. Hermione was babbling excitedly about something to Parkinson, who was trying to look bored and uninterested, but Harry thought he saw intrigue and suppressed amazement in the Slytherin's eyes.
Though it doesn't really make any difference, just postponing his impending suffering. The next day came, November 1st, Harry felt even more catatonic and run-down, body falling into lassitude, as if sitting through his entire Charms class had taken all his energy and now he's completely drained—of sheer power to get through this hell or generally of living his life, he didn't know. He felt the bone-deep exhaustion that even deciding if taking the potion would be a good idea or not was a grueling task.
Harry can't believe his luck. He thought Ron and Hermione were worse, then there's Neville and Nott, and Seamus and Dean became unnecessarily obnoxious lately. On top of that, Ginny had someone she can share gooey eyes with, and Harry was left alone to be sick for his lovesick friends' mushy displays.
He was used to the hostility, arrogant condescension and jaundice in Malfoy's eyes, but gentleness...
“Of course you do.” Draco hated Pansy’s condescending voice. “You’re always a little too peculiar when it comes to Potter.”
He couldn't help but to chance a look at Malfoy and his stomach tightened delightfully at the sight of Malfoy's flushed face.
It wasn't just the shame and remorse that kept him up. It was Draco's face, contorted with disappointment, rage and open hurt at being accused of something he clearly regretted. It had only been a matter of time before Harry's inherent intrusiveness and penchant for poking his nose to things he's not welcomed would backfire at him. Draco'd done nothing this year to warrant suspicion. He had changed, far from the toffee-nosed, swelled-headed privileged kid of his past, and Harry still found this shockingly disbelieving at times. But the Malfoys recompensed for their actions during the war. More than half of the Malfoy fortune had expropriated by the Ministry, Narcissa was under house arrest and her wand was also confiscated, and Lucius was rotting in Azkaban, serving his remaining sentence for the rest of his life. Though the Ministry decided to let Draco have his Hawthorn wand for his NEWTs (a part of his stipulation), it was more useless than anything since it was heavily monitored by the Ministry. Harry thought Draco was trying harder than most to get by the year with impossible grades that will somehow overrule the mark on his left arm.
"I'm really sorry if I worry both of you," Harry said contritely. "I really didn't mean it. I'm just... we all just came out of war and we still have individual scars we need to heal. I don't want to be... you know..." He sighed helplessly.
"Surprisingly, that was exhilaratingly fun," Draco gasped as they landed on the grass, stumbling slightly, still pumped up by the thrill of flying just for the sake of flying. No rivalry, no bludgers. "I would never thought it would be this enjoyable to fly with you, Potter. Of all people."
"Before we were so rudely interrupted," Snape pointedly said, glaring at Harry. "I was asking you if you all had started on your projects," the students nodded their head, "then I will have to check on your accounts and see what progress you made on your first week. Hand me your parchments."
"There is no violation of rights when both the Augmentare and the Sedatus are variations of the same specialty of potion," Zabini countered, his lazy posture stiffening. "The effect of the Sedatus to the drinker counters the amplified emotions of the other person involved, and while the Augmentare can be quite volatile, the person could do no harm to the other because of the 'mediating factor' of the Sedatus, which neutralizes the amplified emotions and causes the drinker of the Augmentare to submit."
Seamus fell off the bench, apparently awake to catch on that bit of news, clutching his stomach in his rancorous laughters that echoed in the now speculative silence of the Great Hall. Ron's face was red, very much disconcerted at the thought of their very stern Professor fawning over Saturnine's forlorn lines. Hermione only gaped at him.
"My promise of skinning your ass and feeding it to the giant squid still stands, you know," he added to Severus. Draco turned to Harry, glaring.
"Because I let them in, Potter. Surely, your memory isn't so rusty as to forget how you acted like a good little Auror and tracked me down for the rest of the year?"
And Harry, strangely enough, is not afraid. Whether it be because he felt compelled under Draco's gentle eyes or it was indicative of something deeper that warrant introspection, Harry felt warm for the first time; not just physically, but it came down deep inside of him, under all the amplified sorrow and grief, a bubble of warmth surfaced. Draco's eyes were like a safe space, and he realize he could just feel whatever bloody emotions that were intensified by the potion, Harry knew, just by looking at Draco, that it's completely alright to feel them.
"Mate! You've been re-reading that for what? Two months already!" Ron exclaimed. Hermione tutted at him.
“You have no way of proving it were true,” Draco stiffly said. “A theory. Of Granger’s nonetheless. Have you heard about her preposterous campaign about freeing house elves? That should’ve given you some warning bells.”
"You're not going to die, Draco!" Harry was outright crying, and he desperately reached for Draco only for his hand to be slapped away. "The reason why I saved you from Azkaban was because you deserved to be freed. We were desperate children in a war, Draco. We have no choice but to find a way to survive. While your actions weren't so honorable but you don't deserve to be condemned just because of the choices you made under duress! If anyone think otherwise, I'm going to stand in their way and protect you whatever it takes."
Ginny held Harry's hand comfortingly, "and that's okay. The war's over, you don't have to be the hero anymore! If anyone deserves to be happy, it is you, Harry," She smiled wryly. "I'm really sorry if I might've come off strongly and pressured you to continue where we left off."
The most funny pair, if Harry wasn't currently angry at the noise that reverberated throughout the room, was Neville and Theodore Nott. The Slytherin was snapping orders at Neville to massage his shoulders while the Gryffindor, pleasantly grinning, had submissively yield to his commands.
"It doesn't do you any good to dwell on bad thoughts, Harry," Draco said, as if sensing where the path of his thoughts went to.
Harry’s thick and long lashes curved against the dark circles below his lower eyelids, fluttering slightly. They were depressed lowly, the dark purplish hollows that surrounded his eyes, giving off the impression of sleeplessness and exhaustion, which was, going by what Harry said earlier, likely to be true. Apparently, for days now.
"You seem to be forgetting my position here, Ms Granger," Snape said maliciously. "I have years of complex study regarding potions as a Master of my area of expertise. The variations of Histrionicus Potions are my own crafting and tested by trained professionals. While you have the propensity to exert your... vast knowledge about certain things but your textbook opinions aren't always welcomed."
“This was... weird,” Harry said quietly, his voice hoarse from crying. “I came back to Hogwarts because I want normalcy. But you,” he said, the edge of his lips quirking slightly. “Draco Malfoy had turn everything upside-down.”
The amplifying potion felt so potent through Harry's veins, burning in their wake, tasting so vile and heavy on his tongue, grating on his nerves, obscuring his reasons. Harry repeatedly felt powerful under his anger and powerless under Draco. The feeling likened to a wild animal trapped behind a cage. While he wanted to rage at Draco, there was the helplessness in him that was caused by Draco's physical proximity.
There was a shocked silence in their area, as people start to fill in the Great Hall. Ron was looking at him in amusement, while Hermione...
He was dangling at the edge of consciousness when he heard a soft, tentative voice calling his name from across the room. He blinked his eyes open, and in the dark, he saw a big blob of blur by one of the beds.
"Get out," predictably, it was the first thing Harry blurted out, stupidly enough. He didn't miss the palpable hurt in Draco's face as the blond stood and obediently walked out.
“Are you both done?” He gritted. Pansy turned to him, eyes narrowing. She must’ve seen something in Draco’s face as she pulled Ginevra to her, whispering something then letting go. They shared an affectionate kiss on the lips and hands on each other’s bums before Ginevra made an exit.
"What? Staring at each other the way you and Malfoy did last night? That was torture, mate, I tell you," Ron snarked. Harry took notice of the tensed lines of Ron's shoulders. "I knew you didn't want to go back with Ginny, mate, but you need to stop being the bloody chivalrous gentleman and confront her. Madam Puddifoot's!" Ron exclaimed, probably remembering the Cho fiasco in fifth year. "You can just give Ginny the bloody closure that she deserved before you go and make disgusting heart eyes at your blond paramour."
Harry didn't know if Draco would took on his offer to fly. After all, they had not interacted amicably outside of their Potions project. But after mounting on his Firebolt and gliding through the air, there was no room for regret or embarrassment. Harry missed this!
Harry picked it up, examining the object. It was shiny and cold against his palm and the steady and mild thrum of magic undulated from its cool surface. Harry had a horrifying thought that it might be a dark object, it was a Malfoy heirloom after all, but he remembered what Hermione told them about things charged with dark magic;
Harry gasped in mock offended, "what's so unbelievable about having to read some books every once in a while?" Ron chortled at that.
' would fail to see the brilliance behind his very own suggestion. Severus stared at Dumbledore, the only indicative of his impatience was the sharp raised eyebrow and the thinning of his lips. Albus sighed heavily.
"I'm sorry, Gin," Harry cut her off, feeling awful at the look on her face. "We'll be busy with our potion. Maybe next time."
to "distract him of Wrackspurts". Albeit skeptical, the first line of the book had him immediately reading the first book of the series in less than twenty-four hours. Harry had never stopped thanking Luna for introducing him to such great a masterpiece.
"Didn't know you were some library assistant now, Did Madam Pince hired you?" Harry blurted out before he can't help himself. Draco abruptly stopped writing, pursing his lips before he resumed. Harry cleared his throat. "I mean, er. Obviously, I'm here to, uh, study. Of course. What else."
Harry let a tear fell, then another, until he was outright crying on Draco's neck, not caring if he sullied his cashmere sweater or sounded like a pathetic, sniveling wimp. He brought back all the thoughts about his mother; his wishes of having Lily to sing him lullaby when he cried himself awake, scolding him when he dirty his clothes, telling him bedtime stories, kissing him on his forehead and hugging him to sleep. He remembered being envious of Ron for having Molly cook for him, being jealous of Draco for having Narcissa indulged him with presents, even being angry at Dudley for having a mother that tolerated her awful, bratty attitude. And there Harry was, in a cupboard, underfed, without a single memory of his parents—saved for his mum's scream just before she was killed—and without a way of knowing how it felt like to have one since they are both dead.
"It's cold, I liked the cold," Malfoy said in a soft voice, almost sounding meek and coy, though nothing escaped his heavily guarded eyes. Harry turned around, huffing out a weary sigh.
If Hermione and Ron were sharing knowing looks, trying to look discreet, Harry pretended not get angry.
Harry stared at the other's bloodied nose, feeling more and more awkward and strangely nervous by the passing tensed seconds.
"Yes," Harry answered, voice bleat and hoarse. They stared at each other, Draco's eyes filled with emotions Harry was too frazzled to comprehend. Harry's mind was oddly empty, like a dam that had just been broken. Drained. Draco's eyes were coaxing, he realized. "I want..."
“You’re hardly normal to begin with, aren’t you? Scarhead?” Draco said, voice light with humor. He was immensely pleased at the tentative grin that broke the morose lines on Harry’s face.
Harry had not cried this many tears before. Not when Cedric died before him, not when Sirius fell into the veil. He thought he couldn’t cry any longer, but to his embarrassment, he couldn’t stop the grief that settled heavily into his chest at the sight of his parents names inscribed on their gravestone. Draco had stood a few feet behind him to give him some privacy but near enough to hear the dry sob that wreaked out of him. It had echoed across the silent graveyard anyway.
; he had wanted this, and he never knew how he badly did until this very moment, cocooned in Draco's scent that he never wished to be rid of ever again.
Harry sagged even more against the seat, the swirling rage inside of him barely restrained. At least it was restrained. For now, though.
"I want to sleep," Harry quietly replied. Draco nodded his head. "I haven't slept for days." At Draco's sympathetic eyes, he added, "it's Halloween. I don't sleep on Halloween."
Harry wanted to confront (see: comfort) Malfoy, but frustratingly so, Zabini somehow figured out his goals and glare at him in warning before Harry could so much as make a step to Malfoy's direction.
“It was,” he paused, gathering his thoughts which had been filled once again with the image of a smiling, windswept blushing blond. He scratch his nails futilely against his denim-clad legs to shake himself off his particularly cloying musings. “Um, different. A good kind. But it was shocking, all together. Remember the person I talked to you about before... the person whom I hated my entire school life?”
There was a moment of comfortable silence, where Harry just stared off at the indigo that colored the sky at the wake of the twilight, the blinking stars blanketing its expanse, and Draco warred with himself, if the object in his pocket is worth showing or it would probably destroy the tenuous, temporary peace.
"Awful situation?" Draco rudely interrupted, putting his arm around Harry's shoulder and pulling him closer. "I have you know that me and Harry were going along so fine before your unwelcome presence so abruptly intrude into our space. Now if you would just, I don't know, bugger off to hell, Weasel, it would be a pleasure."
"It should be something obvious even to someone with mind of an erumpent, Potter. The deaths have been going on for months, there is no viable reason why every Death Eaters in Azkaban turned up dead because of some nitty-gritty illness."
It’s not to say it doesn’t surprise Harry, and a little bit unsettled at the easiness of which he shared a part of himself that he hadn’t shared with Hermione and Ron ever before. He couldn’t lie, Hermione and Ron are his best friends, but not even his closeness to them could make him divulge all the harrowing details of his childhood, let alone this “condition”. But thanks very much to Snape’s very creative inventions that Draco Malfoy had now had a glimpse into the person he used to hate every piece of his being with.
Potter huffed and let go of Draco's body, thankfully, but the fondness in his face became apparent and unequivocal, much to Draco's chagrin.
“You need to relax,” Draco said, quietly that Harry thought he was humming. Harry turned his head to look at him and saw Draco’s profile, his eyes closed.
The five Slytherins all shared a knowing, quite mysterious look and collectively turned to Malfoy expectantly, who stayed staring at the wall in front of them. Even the Gryffindors all expected him to say something snarky or condescendingly laugh at Harry's face for being such a sappy, hopeless romantic but he remained staring at the wall unseeingly. Zabini cleared his throat.
Draco's blond hair was messy and whipped by the wind. It was the first time Harry find Draco's hair so mussed up. He was wearing a Slytherin green sweater with streaks of black and silver on the sides. Harry's throat worked up at the sight of the blond's sharp shoulder and collar bones peaking out as the neckline of his cashmere sweater fell off his shoulder. It was an odd sight, Draco daring to look so comfortable and so distinct from his usual formal, pompous robes. He looked so delicate and beautiful.
Harry knew he would feel awful about this later. He couldn't even imagine the shame that will inevitably hunt him when the words that he rudely accosted Dumbledore would sink in. Not to mention he just triggered one of his close friends. He knew for sure Ginny wouldn't be so lenient after that. He didn't even know how to apologize for being an irrational prat. That irrational, raging part of him, that was amplified by the
"Why would... just get the fuck in," Harry exasperatedly said, closing his eyes. The door to the room creaked, the sounds of the rhubarb below wafted abruptly through the slight opening, before it was close. There was a pause, then tentative steps padded across the floor only to stopped near him.
Harry could practically hear the collective gulps in apprehension from the whole class when they saw the sadistic glint in the Professor's eyes. Harry wondered what they've written on their accounts of the potion for them to get nervous about. He had written what he wanted Snape to read under the influence of the potions, like
After all, Ginny was his friend first before becoming his lover. It would truly break his heart having to break that friendship more than having to close their almost nonexistent relationship.
At the end of Harry's speech, Draco's face screwed up with a mixture of uncertainty, fear, sorrow and disbelief. Draco's eyes showed how conflicted he was, the small part of him that had survived and grew up from a detrimental battle was waging war with the greater part of him that was damaged by his childhood. But beneath it, Harry found a sliver of hope. A sob wreaked out of Draco's defeated form as he lowered his hand, his grip loosening until the wand dropped to the grass. Harry pulled Draco into an embrace, and at the barest of touch, heartbreaking cries flowed out of Draco's trembling mouth like the force of water from a broken dam, and it echoed in and tainted the once magically peaceful place.
"Oh Draco," Narcissa sighed, cupping Draco's face. "I told you not to worry for me. It doesn't do good for your sake and your NEWTs to dwell on things outside of your control. Moreover, Severus put up additional wards that will alert both you and him should I find myself in peril." Narcissa finally turned her cool gaze to Harry, acknowledging his presence. "I was not informed that we would be having a guest."
"It might be hard for her, but Ginny's stronger than you credit her for. She can get through this if you break it to her this early," Hermione said, and suddenly grinned. "If it makes you feel better, I might've caught her more than once with Parkinson... getting out of a cupboard."
Draco turned and asked the Room of Requirements for a closet full of robes befitting for the gloomy occasion as Harry sighed, resigning to a stilted and awkward afternoon.
At that, Harry suddenly turned his head to face the rest of the hall, so fast he thought he can hear the sickening crunch in his neck. He sought the Slytherin table and immediately found Draco's eyes. Harry was briefly pleased to see Draco's odd doll façade slipped, looking shocked to be caught staring and hastily looked away.
“Do you still feel calm and relax when you read The Memoirs of Saturnine the Villain?” Dianne asked.
Draco's face fell and his eyes lost its spark, now guarded and cold. Harry inwardly cursed, thinking he had fucked it up.
, a cry for help or mourn in grief, ever. Even if he had seen his godfather slipped through a bloody veil right before his eyes.
“You’re not the one to talk, honey,” Pansy snarled at the sickening epithet. “Do I have to remind you your awful decision of dating Michael Corner? So, your opinions are nullified. Besides, I’ve dated Draco Malfoy,” the aforementioned groaned when Pansy salaciously winked at him, “before, and that’s enough to compensate my questionable dating history.”
Hermione disapprovingly frowned at him, "Harry, you can't be serious. You're not obsessing with Malfoy again!"
Harry Potter, the Gryffindor Golden Boy, the Chosen One, the Savior of the Wizarding World, the bloody privileged Boy-Who-Lived-Twice. Draco could just basically list a hundred and so things on why he hated Potter's guts but it would not be cathartic, because Potter himself is the reason why Draco planted the seeds of resentment and had grown into a very nasty tree bearing cynical fruits.
Before Harry could so much as open his mouth, a certain blond came in through the large doors of the Great Hall. Harry stopped what he was doing, spoon and fork clanking loudly against his plate, to stare up at Draco Malfoy. He had his vacant, doll-like persona on, sitting in the Slytherin table primly, talking with his Slytherin chummies.
Harry's face was hot, fisting his robes and wanted nothing than to destroy Snape's pinched face. It was not their fucking fault. It had been the Slimy Potions Professor's own sadistic and irrational choices that had them drinking the potions and recording their experiences on a bloody charmed paper!
“Wait, ‘Mione. You don’t supposed to show this git,” he glared warily at Draco, who was grasping for the tiniest bit of patience left of him, “Harry’s precious... map, do you?”
“He hadn’t slept for... months,” Draco said abruptly, finding it hard to put up pretenses at Pansy’s tone.
"Oh, another article about Harry again?" Ron snorted, smirking at Harry and reminiscing the article last September where the Prophet had made a particularly intrusive speculation of how long Harry's bits was. Harry flicked a rice at him. "What's it about this time? His favorite flavor of lu—"
"Why would I read that slimy prat's instructions!" Harry glowered at him but Malfoy's expression remained serene. "He's the reason I'm a step away from crushing your ridiculously blond head!"
The odd sensations in his ears incrementally vanished; Harry grasped the soothing lilt of the voice, he recognized as Draco's, that tried to coax him out of the overwhelming deluge of emotions that swamped over him. He took shaky breaths, hand on his shoulder and another on his face trying to ground him and Harry focused on that calming feeling, until his fuzzy eyes cleared and it zoomed on Draco's face, eyes clear and open and gently urging.
"No," Harry replied. "It's okay, I just..." his eyes discreetly traveled down to Malfoy's feet, his cheeks flushing as he stared back up at the other's face. "Why aren't you wearing your shoes? Barefoot is disgusting."
Malfoy, on the contrary, was calm and gentle. When he drank the potion, his empty eyes and dull expression were replaced with mildness, and he even have a serene smile on his face, much to Harry's indignation. He was becoming more and more vexed at Malfoy's gentle approach, Harry had repeatedly snapped at him but the Slytherin stayed collected at the face of Harry's unhinged behavior. He didn't know if this mild Malfoy is worse than emotionless Malfoy.
Harry was awake before everyone else in the Eighth year boys dorm. The sun had barely peeked out of the horizon, engulfing the whole room in a twilight gloom. Harry supposed it's too early to rise but he had not gotten a wink of sleep the whole night before and sleep would not appear anytime sooner. With a weary sigh, he got out of the silky sheets of Gryffindor red and padded silently towards the bathroom.
Harry watched Draco go, and he could feel the pit of shame and self-hatred in his stomach growing bigger. He couldn’t call Draco’s name even if he wanted to because he was choking in his guilty. He had suspected Draco of doing something illegal again, when they had just shared all the precious vulnerable moments and the most wonderful kiss Harry’d ever had. And now Harry felt like he had destroyed something before it even started.
"Well, I don't know, Severus," Draco smoothly cut off Harry's statement. "If it's really unfortunate of you, then I have the pleasure to have you a spectator to this
"They Crucio'd you?" Harry asked, angered. They were assured by Nigellus Black that Ginny wasn't punished. "I thought you were-"
There was a warmth that encased his hand and he didn't realised he had closed his eyes as they trudged up the lane towards the manor. He looked to see Draco gazing at him, and he was surprised to see the look of gentle understanding in the other's grey eyes.
"Everything okay, mate?" Ron asked him, pulling him out of his thoughts. Harry stared at his friend, who was eyeing his mushed sausage piteously. "If you won't—"
Harry nodded, "shouldn't we wake them up?" he asked, gesturing to the rest of their still snoring dorm mates.
"It's okay, Harry," Hermione told him. "We all changed after the war. I'm sure Ginny would understand it."
"I knew the feeling of being bereaved of father and I wouldn't wish that to anyone, nor would I think anyone deserved to get their fathers killed," Harry said. His fingers were itching to reach out, clenching and unclenching by his sides. "I'm very sorry, Draco."
“I’ve heard about the Histrionicus Potions from Professor Severus,” the Mind-Healer said. “So I presumed it went well?”
Draco watched Harry’s face some more. He had removed his glasses earlier when Harry was starting to fall asleep, to avoid the painful indents of the frame on his skin. His lips were slightly parted, the tiniest bit of tongue poking out, drool starting to glisten at the side of his mouth. Draco chuckled, a sudden urge to plant a kiss on Harry’s forehead, just like what his mother used to do, overcame him. Though he reckoned it would be inappropriate, but that doesn’t mean he can’t brush his fingers softly through Harry’s messy hair and swept the overgrown bangs out of his eyes. Draco’s eyes travelled down to the faint dark spots dotting across Harry’s cheekbones and tip of his nose that Draco obsessively traced with his eyes earlier. They were barely seen, not like the freckles on Weasley’s face, but they were there, evidence of Harry’s hours under the sun.
Eighth year sounds promising. Being in Hogwarts, even if it was a place of the war and countless death, was after all Harry's home. He just wanted to be normal, just for one year. He wanted to figure out his life first, to be just a child for one last time, to not be molded by the expectations of the Wizarding world, who intermittently betrayed and demonized him for years. Eight year sounds about right.
"Mate, you were staring at Malfoy for minutes earlier. Ginny practically shouted at your ears. Do you know what this reminds me of?" Ron shared a knowing look with Hermione. Harry felt agitated.
Potter, the sweet, innocent looking eleven-year-old Potter whom Draco had offered a handshake only to get turned down and chosen over that ugly, redheaded Weasel. No one had ever turn his friendship down, no one had ever had the guts to refuse him. Well, except the idiotic, messy bespectacled git!
Draco saw him in his most vulnerable, which Harry didn't normally blazoned on to anybody else, even to his most closest, much less to his past schoolboy rival. Harry supposed he should be scared; should feel raw and exposed. Malfoy would probably use this to tear him down even more, insult and taunt him.
"Apologize?" Ginny frowned as he stared at Harry's hand around Draco's. "You don't have to, Harry. I'm the one who needs to apologize. I knew you have no say about the awful situation you were in but I should've understand—"
“You were gone for the whole day, I was looking for you,” Harry said neutrally. Draco’s eyes flared and he stepped toward Harry threateningly. “What are you doing here?”
"Draco found me by the lake," Harry told them, trying hard not to get swamped with the embarrassing moments of his vulnerability. It was quite hard. "It's because of the Histrionicus potion that it was easier for me to confess, like getting pissed on Firewhiskey, except that I was still aware and sober."
"Of course you're allowed to be in a good mood, Harry," Hermione said. Harry pretended he didn't saw her stepping on Ron's foot under the table. "It's a welcoming change. It's just that..." at that, she shared another look with Ron, now tinge with nervousness. Harry suppressed a sigh, vaguely knowing where this was going. Hermione waved her wand, encasing them in a bubble of Muffling charm. "We were worried for you, Harry. I know you always feel downcast during Halloween, and that you want to be alone with yourself and your thoughts. And that is okay, that is completely understandable. We can always respectfully give you some space. But you can't just always distract yourself away from your pain and emotional negativity. It isn't healthy, Harry. It's been going on for months. And don't expect us to not notice all those months after the war wasting away in Muggle bars, sleeping with anyone so callously! I mean, there isn't anything wrong with shagging anyone you like. But this coping mechanism isn't good for you at all, and certainly not in the long run. I knew it's getting lonely, but you don't have to be alone because you have us. We just wanted to help, Harry. We're your best friends; your
"I'm not sure I will," Harry told him, traces of fear contorting his face. Draco cupped his face. Harry stared at his beseeching eyes.
"So Parkinson," Harry made it sound casual, but the teasing tone had somehow slipped out of his nonchalance.
"Besides, you would be surprised who deigned to share your love for dear ol' Saturnine," Ron said as they sat at the Gryffindor Table, waiting for the rest of the students as it's still ten minutes away before breakfast starts.
"Draco..." Harry softly called, but Draco trained the wand to his direction, his hand was badly shaking. "Draco, it's okay—"
to his face and resumed reading. Only did he hear a loud familiar shrilly gasp that he stopped again to turn to the sound.
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled when he saw Harry and Malfoy entering his office and immediately said his customary greetings of offering his Lemon drops, to which Harry sneered at.
?" both Harry and Ron chorused predictably, sharing a knowing look over Hermione's head. She stared at them with a slightly miffed expression.
Suddenly, Malfoy growled when Parkinson laughed loudly at something Hermione said, putting an arm around the bushy-haired witch. The other four people stared confusedly, while Harry only clenched his jaw, when Malfoy jumped up and accosted Hermione.
Harry panted when he crossed the threshold to the Library, his breathing apparently loud enough that Madam Pince glared at him. Harry strode along the aisle in between shelves of ancient tomes, casually browsing through some books, randomly picking a book that had seen better days. He stopped at the next section, body leaning against a shelf and eyes glued on the lone figure in the long table by the window, an open book in front of him and few others surrounding his area, idly scribbling on a piece of parchment.
Right now, by the grace of their Potions project, Harry had the privilege to closely expect the extent of the changes in Malfoy's suddenly subdued behavior.
Harry walked the distance between them and gripped Malfoy's collar, "so you mean we'll have to be with each other all the fucking time?"
The sun had already set when Draco walked the same path toward the great lake. He saw Harry sitting at the same place they picnicked, his back against the large trunk of the tree. He was hunched, knees bent close to his chest, and his wand emitted a dull light, face pulled close to The Memoirs of Saturnine the Villain: Book 6. At the sound of Draco’s careful footsteps, Harry raised his head. His pallid face was glowing eerily with the lumos, casting shadows on his face.
"It isn't your fault," Malfoy suddenly said, as if reading Harry's mind, his face serene. Harry almost snap at him but the blond held his hand and massaged it.
So no! I don't see why you should check on me now that I can very well take care of myself. So please, stop pretending that you care."
Harry's smile fell and a sudden ache bloomed in his temple. There was an unpleasant churn in his stomach at Ginny's words, the
Harry wanted to blow Malfoy's calm person instead but he found himself helpless under Malfoy's gentle command, and instead, refocused his rage to the insufferable overgrown bat who was the sole perpetrator of this predicament.
"Come on, mate," Ron rolled his eyes, but there is gentleness in his smile. "Even if I'm still grieving for Fred, I wouldn't be selfish enough not hear you out on and help you with what you're feeling. We're all in this, Harry. We've always been, since 1991."
Draco seethed, wanting to give Severus a piece of his mind, but Harry pulled on his arms incessantly. After removing 50 points from both their Houses, Severus slammed the door to their faces.
"I would appreciate a little sense of discretion and avoid divulging the harrowing details of your abominable rendezvous next time."
"And he brought me to Godric's Hollow. To visit my parents," he said slowly, waiting for the stern frowns and gaping mouths. Hermione and Ron looked at each other before she looked at Harry with a warm smile. Even Ron stared at him with intrigue, a small keen smirk tugging his lips. Harry stared at them in confusion.
They didn't even noticed he was sitting before them, heads ducking down to whisper at each other. Brilliant.
Draco just stared at him with cool eyes, and Harry stared back with heated determination, green eyes flaring with sincerity and hoping that Draco could see just how much Harry believed that everyone deserves to live no matter what they did during the war. After a few moments, Draco looked away, eyes settling on the tip of a tentacle that undulated the lake's surface. A sliver of tension left Harry, briefly relieved there wasn't going to be any unnecessary argument between them about ethics.
"Who told you to barge in unannounced inside my sleeping chambers, Draco?" Severus glared at Harry behind him. "And you brought the insolent brat with you?"
“No more of Granger’s humanitarian tangents, Pans. I cannot bear to hear anymore of her Gryffindorian benevolence.”
"Don't sound so jealous, Pans. It sounded so unlike you," Ginny snipped back, but her eyes twinkled in amazement.
For the life of him, he wouldn't even dare trade this temporary sense of security and freedom for the world. He desperately asked for normalcy, and maybe a ten feet or so of Transfiguration essay was part of the package.
Draco internally bristled at the self-deprecating words. He wanted to tell Harry that he was the bravest person he had ever met. Harry was tenacious and unwavering. He was stubborn and uncompromising to his values, and even if that included some of biases and prejudice against Draco and the Slytherin House, Harry stuck to his ideals no matter the kind of things he was forced to face. Not to mention, he was the kindest person Draco had met. That was proven during the Fiendfyre and the trials. Harry didn’t have to do that to the person who constantly torment him for years. But he did, wholeheartedly.
Malfoy's eyes slightly widened, though Harry almost didn't see the infinitesimal change in Malfoy's impassive face. But Harry saw the shock, and he looked down to see Malfoy's toes curling, as if repulsed and wanting to dig against the ground and hide themselves.
," Zabini said as if Malfoy was being an idiot and couldn't get the whole concept. Malfoy turned to Harry and made a noncommittal sound before turning back to staring at the wall.
“What do you think about him, Harry?” Dianne asked after a few moments. Harry looked up at her, confused.
The second time, he jolted himself awake. The first rays of the sunrise emerged from the horizon, dousing the whole room with muted light. Harry felt the disorientation from sleep clouding his mind, the dregs of the night's worth of uninterrupted rest clung to his consciousness. He barely registered another person's body next to him, their gangly and sharp limbs sprawled atop his body, tufts of blonde hair tickling his chin. His eyes drooped, succumbing back to sleep, until it dawned on him.
. It was Friday afternoon, three days since they had started their Potions project. There was a significant difference in their taste. While he had been angry while brewing the amplifying potion, it had brought a vile, scalding aftertaste that could be comparable to a sulfur clawing at his esophagus; not unlike the feeling of the searing rage that flowed through his veins.
"Remember what we brewed last week? It was particularly nasty. This time would probably be worse," Harry replied, as they turned the corner leading to the Potions classroom. The small number of Slytherins already stood outside.
They had all been the intrinsic characteristics of Malfoy's little self. And Harry—despite his belief that Malfoy had changed after the war—couldn't fault his (once) Slytherin rival for feeling bitter.
"I'm not!—" Harry looked up in time to see Malfoy walking out of the Great Hall. He immediately get to his feet and followed Malfoy out, missing the troubled looks on his best friends' faces.
It certainly helped a lot, the monthly Mind-Healing sessions. Mind-Healer Dianne was more than efficient at her job; she never once looked at and treated Harry as the Hero, she was professional but not cynical in her approach, there was no judgement and pity in her eyes as he recalled a brief and polished version of his childhood, she waited patiently for whatever Harry deigned to say and always knew what to ask.
Draco quietly sighed, swept an overall look at Harry’s peaceful sleeping state, before slowly got up and padded across the floor. He looked back at Harry once again before closing the door behind him. He made a small trip to the loo to relieved himself and decided to visit his own dormitory before going back to Harry’s.
. They both agreed (or in Malfoy's godforsaken passive state, Harry decided) that Harry would take the Augmentare first and Malfoy would act as the 'mediator' for the both of them.
“Okay,” Dianne nodded in understanding. “What about doing things you once do. What are your hobbies, Harry?”
"You're going to heedlessly dive-head-first into reckless trouble again? Confront the murderer like the impulsive cretin that you are?" Draco sneers at him, his hand on Harry's tightening to an iron grip. "Don't be such an idiot, Potter. Even if you're the sodding Savior, and Merlin knows how much you thirst to impose your heroic conducts, but you should not be wasting any of your precious time to Death Eater scums like my father."
Draco raised his head, two lovely pink spots high on his cheeks, as he pecked Harry on the lips before snuggling against Harry's neck.
Harry suppressed a self-deprecating groan, vaguely wondering what had become of his life, why he suddenly lost his tongue in Draco's presence. They certainly had seven years of witty altercation and acerbic imbroglios but Harry's will to come up with a sarcastic retort all but diminished. Then again, the new Draco couldn't really get a rise out of him enough to warrant the same acrimonious exchange.
The searing rage had caused his heart to furiously beat, blood boiling at every inconsequential thing that didn't usually wind him up in a right mindset. His mind was in a whirlwind of frenzied and intense emotions that it left him dizzy, black spots pulsating in his eyesight every now and then.
Harry was a frazzled ball of unconfined nerves as he gripped the Marauders’ map and trudged along the empty and long corridors of Hogwarts. He had just left the amiable (and inebriated) congregation of eighth and seventh years in the Three Broomsticks, too jittery to sit through and share their drunken revelry. It was just half past midnight, just what Harry needed to venture the hallways without unceremoniously bumping into students as he was too focused on the ceaselessly moving name in the same corridor in front of a wall where Harry had suspected Draco frequented in sixth year.
It doesn’t help that Draco always found Harry’s eyes even if they weren’t seeking each other’s. Draco would just be scribbling on his parchment and Harry would think of his next move to avoid being checkmated by Ron when they both raised their heads at the exact moment and caught each other’s eyes. Harry always felt the thrum of excitement coiling in his belly whenever he unknowingly turn his head in time with Draco turning to look at his direction and they settle at looking in each other’s eyes. There was a small, furtive smile stretching Draco’s lips and Harry always return the gesture, and he couldn’t help but feel like they were in their own world and the rest around them cease to exist.
“Are you just going to snog all day?” Draco flatly said after a fake cough gone unnoticed. The moans cut short and the people on his bed stopped... whatever indecorous stuffs they had the audacity to perform. On his bed. Finally. Pansy and the Weaslette stared at him, flustered, messy-haired and blushing, save for the unapologetic lazy grins on their lips. Draco curled his lips in disdain. “Shameless, having to do it on top of my silky sheets. Don’t you own a bed to shag each other on?”
"What the fuck have you done, Potter?!" Harry was saved from getting pounced on by the Slytherin girl by Zabini, as he held back her growling friend before she could reach Harry.
“Do you believe in alternate reality?” Harry whispered, eyes distant, glinting in the dimly lit wand.
“So, where’s Potter?” She asked lightly, trying and failing to sound casual. Apparently, she has a tact of a mountain troll. “You wouldn’t want to leave him alone. Merlin knows what things he might blow up unattended.”
It was just the right choice that he invited Draco to fly, no matter how crazy an idea it initially was, because when he turned to Draco just few feet away from him, his breath hitched. The rays of the setting sun caught on Draco's hovering form, his windblown hair looks like a golden halo around him, his skin actually glows, the usual dull grey eyes now glinting in delight, and his smile—damn, his smile—was exuberant. It was the first time Harry saw that euphoric expression on Draco. destroying his doll façade. He was used to the haughty smirks and jeering sneers on Draco's face throughout the years of animosity, but the pure, unmalicious and open laughter was so strange and new that Harry suddenly felt like he was falling off his broom in a blistering speed.
"What do you want, Professor Dumbledore?" Harry hissed angrily. Malfoy's hand travelled to touch his arm and Harry struggled to relax.
And it baffled Harry so much why he would look at Draco and see a beautiful man rather than the pointy git that loved to sneer and snarl at him every chance he get. Because this is beyond normal, he should not be looking at Draco and describe him as beautiful. He should not even find Draco pleasing to look at.
, self-righteously claimed that this wasn't his fault; that it was Dumbledore's for being such a meddling, old fool; that it was Ginny's for not being so understanding and not seeing how much Harry and her weren't on the same page anymore. And hearing
brewer," Snape paused, narrowed beady eyes sweeping over the students. "Suffice it to say, you will be paired off with another student since
. Now he felt very murderous. "Why? Because you don't trust my partner? Because he's a Slytherin?" Harry growled, "or because you're starting to care for me now that I'm a fucking adult! Why haven't you deign to check on me when I was five and the Dursley's had locked me up in my cupboard for days, without food and water? Why haven't you check on me when I was eight and I had severe cold but they didn't even send me to the Hospital? Why haven't you check on me when I was punched by Dudley almost to my death when I was ten? I had suffered abuse under the family that you deliberately had me under the custody for throughout my childhood but you never check on me. Not once.
in his system. Malfoy must've seen something in his face because he tried to reach out to Harry, but the Gryffindor stood up and looked up at the grey clouds looming overhead, promising a drizzle.
Severus' eyes shined maliciously and his lips pulled in a dangerous snarl. He stalked silkily to tower over the Gryffindor, who was now trying to hide behind Draco.
But even if they busied themselves into extra activities on top of school works, the battle scars don't heal over night. They were just children fresh out of war, and even after five months since the historical Battle of Hogwarts, trauma is bound to haunt them whether they close their eyes or bustle themselves.
"Of course it is me, you fool!" Draco raised his head, exhaling a long-suffering, weary breath. "Will you keep on clinging unto me like an ungracious, ill-bred Neanderthal?" he said waspishly.
“I can help you with that,” Draco said impulsively. He tensed, wondering if the poignant air had gotten into and messed with his head. Harry stared at him flatly. Draco cleared his throat. “I’ll help you sleep.”
“Sleeping?” Pansy asked incredulously. “No student had ever slept while under the Augmentare. You didn’t, perhaps, knock him out, did you?”
Harry gritted his teeth, "well? You call this well?" Harry had risen to his feet, face scowling nastily at the old Headmaster. Harry shrugged Malfoy's hand on his shoulder. "I could hardly ever get on without feeling like going crazy and you call this well?! And you only really thought of Inter-House Cooperation," Harry spat the words as if it disgusted him, "after the war when it was your own bias toward Gryffindors and prejudice against the Slytherins that had caused riff and misunderstandings between the Houses! And you wanted to fix this now, with this ridiculous Histrionicus hogwash, when it was already irreparable!
Malfoy was rather quiet during the whole brewing process. And Harry didn't know if it's frustrating or unnerving. On the other hand, Malfoy's constant insults and jabbing at his potion skills (or lack thereof) in the past had only pressured him. Malfoy had only made a comment the whole night, and that was to politely correct Harry when he almost mistakenly added the Fanged Geranium after the Powdered Moonstone instead of the Snake Fang. So maybe it was a good thing that he had to keep his snarky mouth shut for once.
Harry just wanted to know what Draco truly felt. The bit of vulnerability he saw in Draco's grey eyes last night had him intrigued. He was confused why the blond had to put up with this useless doll-like mask. And if Draco was hiding something behind this new vacant persona, Harry wanted nothing but to know every bit of them.
Harry didn't realize he was staring at Malfoy's pretty, long hands until they were lost inside his bag. Harry snapped out of his reverie and realized Malfoy had cleaned their area, and the two potions were already placed in separate corked glass vials.
Draco had seen Potter in his emotional outburst in Monday. He didn't know what the Gryffindor was angry about during the potion preparation, but Draco had seen enough of fifth year and knew that Potter was inclined to intense emotional unstableness. Draco had seen Potter's warring emotions in his eyes, the confusion on his face when Draco was being gentle throughout his rage, wanting to get angry at Draco but not being able to because of the potion. And Potter must've seen the same warring emotions in Draco's eyes because he suddenly grin. And that bright grin did not bode so well for Draco.
"I thought it was supposed to be tomorrow?" Malfoy deadpanned, and even his voice, Harry morosely noted, had lost its once condescending drawl.
Draco walked up beside him and just stared at the lake. Harry turned around to face the lake but all he wanted to do was face Draco and looked at him.
Harry nodded, albeit guiltily. Aside from waiting impatiently for the seventh book to be published, Harry's re-reading of the sixth book felt cathartic and therapeutic to him. It was no denying that the War of the Worlds in
"It's still embarrassing," Draco short of whined, and Harry had to suppress the urge to grin at the picture Draco made, with his lower lip jutting out petulantly. He tried to commit the picture to memory. "I was having a fit in front of half of Hogwarts, Harry. I could never imagine... it was just- and I even attacked my own friends and housemates. What would Severus think of it- well, it was his bloody fault in the first place, anyway. That... overgrown bat! I could never show my face anymore..."
With a heavy, plaintive sigh, Harry scooted even closer to Draco, relieved to hear the rumble of his chest as Draco chuckled against the top of his head.
However, as Harry was engulfed in Draco's warmth, the other's chest expanding against his back as Draco breathed, puffs of air lightly tickling the back of his neck, Harry realized that he had never felt so content, so at
"It's okay, Harry," he said, holding Harry close to him. "Don't worry. We're not going inside the manor."
"You don't want to see Professor Snape's ass, Potter, so please calm yourself down," Malfoy admonished in his gentle voice, and Harry found himself easily yielding when being this physically close. Harry belatedly realized the floor they stood on was shaking and had stopped the moment he did calm himself.
Harry curled his fingers around the heirloom, a silly sensation overlapping the cold disappointment for no apparent reason.
“Please let him...” she trailed off, pursing her lips before resolutely nodded her head. Draco didn’t waste anytime bolting out of the room.
"The Chosen One. The Savior of the Wizarding World," he snorted gently. When he opened his eyes, they glinted. There was a jolt of heat in Harry's navel at the sight of Draco's earnest eyes, and if they weren't standing so close Harry might've staggered. "You're not so special."
“—and we’ve come to realised that both you and Potter, Millie and Patil, and Theo and Longbottom have corresponding results,” she said, Draco cringed at her clinical tone. “You absorbed Potter’s emotions, as you did right now, only because you and Potter share... mutual sentiments. It’s the reason why you feel tired every time you ‘mediate’.”
Through the buzzing in his ear, he can hear the loud and shrilly sounds of metals colliding with each other and glasses falling to the floor but he didn't care. Harry gripped Malfoy's hand and pulled him up to his feet. "If you have nothing else to say Headmaster, we will excuse ourselves out."
"Harry?" The tentative voice, it's Hermione's. But Harry felt like his head was plunged deep under water, and her echoing voice seemed distance away, until he couldn't decipher the jumble of indistinct sounds that surrounded him, gradually fading in the background as the sharp buzz and whizz filled his ears, like a colony of wasps droning about. He find it hard to breathe.
"That peculiar little creature, always a pleasant surprise. He'd wanted to be a free elf, even if all the other elves in the manor condemn him for it. You know, if circumstances were so different I would've helped Granger with her campaign for House Elf rights, if that's the only thing I could've done for Dobby," Draco's voice turned wistful as he chuckled wetly. "You're probably gobsmacked how an elitist like me deigned to mingle with a lowlife like a House Elf! Preposterous, but I'm rather taken by his inanities. Dobby's actually my first friend..."
"Draco, please," Harry quietly said, eyeing Draco earnestly. Draco stopped short, glaring down his nose at him.
“Don’t be such a dolt, Pansy,” Draco grumbled, fingers fiddling the hem of his sweater, scrabbling through the higgledy-piggledy of his thoughts. “It’s emotionally toilsome. Being the mediator, I mean.”
Ginny hadn't physically changed since the last time they both stood under this same tree. She was still the same beautiful and brave girl Harry had fallen for before, with flaring red hair that framed her face perfectly and a strong and assertive personality that Harry loved about her. Even as they stare at each other right now, with the memories of the war and all the chaotic emotions between them, Harry's heart still beat for her glowing smile, seized by the gloomy wistfulness that run into him in waves.
Behind him, Harry tutted gently, "with all your Pureblood decorum, Draco, you have no sense of discretion."
Harry stared at Draco, mesmerized and fascinated. He couldn't believe Draco was deliberately opening up to him without the influence of the Histrionicus potion. Draco normally looked so guarded, but right now he was so amicable and good-natured. Seeing Draco willingly opening up to him meant a lot to Harry.
is one of the core ingredients—tasted basically the opposite of its counterpart's. Harry's potion left a sweetened caramel tang that seemed to seep into his taste buds. He immediately felt an inexplicable rush of giddiness and fondness for an unnamed thing—or,
“As you are. You still haven’t, since before the war,” Pansy said cynically, like a ruthless Professional mind-healer inanely pointing out the obvious. Draco’s lips tightened. More so at her next words: “Potter always brought out the best and worse of you, Draco.”
Harry wanted to pick a fight with Malfoy, to let out the unbridled rage and pour it out unto the calm Slytherin. But every time Malfoy pacify and soothe him, he couldn't help but feel... less and less angry with him, which frustrated Harry even more.
"I'm fine, just," Harry sighed. "I always wanted to say that to him for so long. It felt freeing and cathartic."
"Are you just going to continue staring off space like a dunderhead buffoon or I have to lecture you about the basics of locomotion because you're much of a nitwit than you let on?"
And Harry badly wish he still is the way he was before the war, as much as it sounded improbable. There was just too much part of himself that died with him at the Forbidden Forest. The war had pushed him to a certain footing where he was forced to let go of the things that he used to believed in and prompted him to face new perspectives and priorities. And it was just heartbreaking that being with Ginny wasn't one of them.
Narcissa's calculating eyes fixed both men with phlegmatic skepticism before she sharply turned and lead the way. Harry's breath evaded his lungs at the sight of the formidable manor. It was like being pulled back into the memory; the iron grip around both his arms as Greyback and the snatchers had pulled him and his friends across the huge lane, the fear that had threatened to overcome him when they were surrounded with Death Eaters who were more than willing to call Voldemort, the panic that rose in his throat when Draco...
Draco Malfoy, in his broom up in the air, shining under the sunset, is so fucking beautiful. He was always so beautiful, but with no potion in Harry's system, there was nothing that he could blame on why he found Draco such an... enchanting and captivating sight to behold. Harry gripped the handle of his broom tightly, his stomach lurching that he knew has nothing to do with flying.
Hermione seemed to comprehend because she nodded, a sympathetic look in her eyes. "I totally understand how awful your relatives treated you. And I wish you've gotten rid of the things they've caused you. But your problems matter too, Harry, no matter how much you think you're causing a burden."
“You would?” Harry softly asked. It wasn’t disbelieving nor rejection, so Draco nodded. They stared at each other’s eyes for longer than necessary, until Harry looked down.
Harry trudged his way across the hallways of the castle. It was Saturday noon, and the weekly friendly Quidditch match between the sixth and seventh years had just finished. Harry was too frazzled and sleepless to give a rat's arse about Quidditch, and his usual enthusiasm for the Wizarding sport had significantly depleted after the war.
The first time he laid in his bed, watching Draco in the Slytherin boys dormitory just across from theirs, pacing in front of his Slytherin cohorts, Ron had snorted.
It's not that Harry doesn't appreciate their presence. He went through so much with Ron and Hermione, they were his first family and if there are people who deserved to know what Harry is feeling right now, it would be the two of them. But there are just days that even the barest of human contact is just too unbearable for him and he just wanted to be left alone to brood with himself.
By the end of Draco's speech, tears were freely cascading down his cheeks, glinting in the nearby firelight. Harry could only offer comfort, hugging Draco closer as the blond clung to him like a lifeline. A tumult of emotions raging inside of him as he heard the heart-wrenching words coming from the blond. He felt so disgusted and enraged at how Draco was treated by his father. Draco had always bragged about the Malfoy clout and the influence of his family, and Harry had  always felt it was an ostentatious and superficial display. And it was the truth, Draco intended it to be self-aggrandizing and grandiose to make up for the absence of warmth and love that was lacking from his life. All the my father will hear about this was a manifestation of his insecurities and self-imposed assurance that his father will hear him, even if it was just for the sake of pretenses.
"You're kidding, right?" Dean scoffed, helping Seamus back to his seat. "McGonagall reading an angsty homo-erotic memoir of a psycho with unresolved sexual tension with a newly out of youth boy hundreds of years his junior?" Harry shrugged.
Draco had tormented Harry and his friends for years, but Draco had also been there for him when he needed comfort, baring himself as much as Harry did. And, Harry realized with a staggering force, Draco helped him in ways no one did and no one would ever be able to.
Harry had seen Malfoy's withdrawn persona brought by the war silently seething in anger every time he went back to the eighth year Common Room after a trip from the Hospital Wing. Even at Malfoy's taciturn and recessive disposition, Harry had known Malfoy for seven years and could see through his mask of indifference. Harry had caught on to the light twitch in Malfoy's left eyes and the prominent throbbing vein at his temple and translated it to annoyance. It's the only indication that Malfoy could still feel emotions, what with his doll-like, emotionless façade.
Hermione mildly poked Ron on his side. "Don't be dramatic, Ron." She turned to Harry. "What happened yesterday, Harry? You ran away unannounced. We were worried."
"Why am I having an uneasy feeling about this?" Ron muttered in an undertone. Hermione silenced him before Snape can hear and take House points.
. With a sneaky wave of Draco's wand, he casted a Silencing spell at Harry and the Gryffindor prat had lost his voice. Harry looked at him, offended.
A hysterical laughter bubbled out of Harry and he wheezed and doubled over, letting out a series of maniacal grins and snickers. Malfoy shook his shoulders.
Harry stared at the innocuous book on top of his Defense and Charms textbooks. He stared longingly at it, battling in his mind if re-reading the sixth installment of
Harry didn't know what to do. He couldn't even manage his own emotions, let alone the person whom he was supposed to hate hysterically breaking down in front of him. His history with confronting intense emotionality was when he and Cho were dating, which he eventually bollocksed up.
“Yes,” Harry said, more emotion and meaning lacing the affirmation more than he could permit. “He was there during the Halloween with me. And brought me to my parents’ graveyard.” He wanted to tell her about Draco helping him to sleep but he wanted to keep the moment to himself, something he could treasure secretly.
And it didn't left him till this very day. The traumatic assaults, gaslighting words, degradation and the ridicule he was subjected under throughout his childhood and adolescence had left a permanent, potentially incurable mark on his psyche, as what the mind-healer had so uselessly supplied. His desensitization to pain and fear had not been because of his Gryffindorian bravery, neither his being dull and over-all incognizant to the feelings of another person was the reason why he thought Cho Chang was a whinging, blubbering bint.
"I couldn't quite imagine having this heart to heart talk in the middle of breakfast," Harry said, his best friends grinned with him. Hermione ended the charm, signaling the end of the conversation. Though he's got a feeling that it was only the end of the heavy bit. "I can't believe myself by saying this, but it needs to be said. I believed that Snape's Histrionicus potion has somehow done more good than we care to admit."
"Harry?" Draco called. Harry snapped up to look at him. Draco is staring back at him expectantly, a hand tentatively cradled his side of face. Almost instinctively, Harry leaned into the warmth, relieved.
"It's not too early for someone who wanted to pass with Outstanding marks," Draco quipped, sounding almost too close as he did before. Harry started, hearing it for the first time for a very long time. "I supposed you wouldn't understand. You don't need to pass your NEWTs, do you? The Golden Boy that you are."
"You really thought you did something, do you?" Draco barked out derisively. Severus merely raised an unimpressed eyebrow. "Have your senses escaped you, Severus? You call yourself an honorable Potions Master, yet you went and conduct a probably illegal experimentation on unassuming eighth years—"
Harry made to sit beside Malfoy. Before he could even touch half a cheek on his Gryffindor sheet, Malfoy all but jumped out of his skin. The palpable distress in Malfoy's disposition, for whatever reasons that Harry couldn't fathom, had Harry feeling hopeless and alarmed.
It was just fortunate that after the war, Hermione and Ron had been understanding of his unpredictable moods. If this were in fifth year, they would be all over him, it would be hard enough for Harry to shrug them off his back, and if he did he'll end up snapping at them and straining their friendship. But Hermione had only given him a motherly kiss on his cheek and got a gentle, matey side-hug from Ron before walking towards the Great Hall, understandably giving him his well-needed distance. They still stayed beside him, asking him if he preferred pancakes or eggs and toast, but they didn't barrage him with invasive questions when Harry merely shook his head dully. And for the first time since they decided to be together again, Ron and Hermione respectfully avoided any arguments, no furtive whispering and cloying glances on top of their books. And Harry deeply appreciated their effort to give him consideration.
"Not bloody likely," Ron shook his head. "Every Death Eater, prisoned or on the run, had ended up bitten the dust. Reckon there's some vigilantes who take it upon themselves and do them in. Always the same, isn't it? Natural causes?"
Really, Harry could just do with some kind of normal. Ever since he was eleven, he had been caught in-between life and death situations, had been tortured, had seen countless death at a young age, and literally died and came back to life. His childhood and adolescent life was filled with sordid death, evil Dark Wizards, a more evil, psychopathic Dark Lord on his tail wanting him dead. And now that he's eighteen, he felt like he had not lived his life to the fullest, even if he did saved the whole world. He was not given a time to live like his age, to enjoy the freedom of being a child and being free of all the pressures involved in being adult. After the War, he was instinctively thrusted into the adult life and he honestly felt pressured.
"Why don't we go back to the Common Room so you can rest?" Malfoy gently led him to the direction of the eighth year Common Room. And Harry, of course, acquiesced.
Severus' posture was too comical, if Draco was in his right mind he would laugh at his godfather's expanse. Severus had his hand on his hips and another cradling his temple, a palpable expression of exhaustion on his face.
Sitting by the lake. Draco wasted no time and ran to the door. Before he could make it out though, Granger called behind him.
Snape's voice became soft for his next words, but the smug and pride on his tone were evident, "because this is a potion that I, on my own, devised. The two variations of the
"I don't understand you, Harry. If you can't stop obsessing over that evil Death Eater scum then I would never try to talk to you again."
Draco turned. He offered a half-smile before cooly saying, "I need to dress you up, Harry. We don't want to be in father's presence with that... rag you call clothes now, do we?"
Malfoy sat with the Slytherins three tables over, but even through the distance, Harry could feel Malfoy's frigid eyes boring through his soul. It felt like Legilemancy, but instead of pulling and diving through his memories, Malfoy's expressionless eyes reached his soul.
"Okay, mate?" Ron beamed, smiling more enthusiastically for Monday morning. His drooping eyes and tensed shoulders told Harry he too did not get a good night sleep. Or if he ever slept at all.
"I—We—" she stuttered, looking anywhere but Harry. "She helped me last year, everytime I got Crucio'd."
Harry shoved her in turn, forgetting that she has a lither form than Ron. She almost toppled over. "Why does everybody think I fancy that pointy git! That's just ridiculous."
Draco understood the concept completely. It was simple, human psychology. Draco might not be so good at reading other people’s emotions like Pansy was, be a little too self-absorbed most of the time, but he can figure out the effects of complex trauma to a person’s mind and expect a person’s behavior who underwent emotional abuse as a child. And Draco knew what Potter’s trying to convey; it’s one of the few things Draco shared with him. A very fucked-up childhood.
"Thought you could just sway me with your absurd Gryffindor sappiness, Potter?" Draco said acerbically, glaring at the picnic that was laid by the Great Lake, under one of the trees. "You don't expect me to just sit there like a lowlife peasant now, do you?"
"Mate," Ron called from his bed. Harry blearily peeked under his blanket. "Fancy to get some breakfast? I could bring some back up here, if you like."
emotions? Snape must be looking forward to either of them blowing their cauldrons or blasting their heads off.
Ron stared at her with a gaping expression, enamored eyes wide with sickening amount of fondness and affection. When Hermione looked at him cogently, he tried to arrange his face to one of noncommittal.
Even Harry himself felt his patience thinning at the absurdness of the masses and the frustrating predicament they were in. It was probably a right timing that he was about to take a mediating potion rather than the amplifying one. Merlin knows what he'll do...
, him and Malfoy not being awful at each other is definitely not you can call normal. And this is becoming bothersome. At least for Harry's part.
The day went by so fast. It was probably because all his classes for the day were shared with Draco.
"We were two different people back then," Harry said pensively. "I wish the war haven't change the way we were before."
“Potter,” the familiar Malfoy sneer contorted his face. At a different situation, Harry would probably be thrilled at the familiar sight. But Draco’s face showed no signs of the once schoolboy malice. It was all cold daggers and tumultuous incense. “Our very own hero, playing Auror again, eh? Using your magical map to stalk me once more? What do you want from me this time?”
"It's not even slavery, per se," Zabini drawled, sprawled on the loveseat opposite Harry's, looking bored. "Both the participants were under variations of emotion-stimulating and -repressing potions, but there is a power balance between the two as their emotions are congruous to each other."
She stared at the black lake, watching a tentacle rippling the surface of the peaceful water, eyes glassy. "Of course everyone was wary of Slytherins that time. There was no way of knowing her intentions so I was initially suspicious, and just like the stupid Gryffindor that I was, I called her all sorts of names. But she stayed, somehow knowing where I've gone to, bringing hot chocolates every time. Until..." Ginny sighed once more. "We almost got caught by one of the Carrows. She... she told me to stay hidden behind one of the tapestry and presented herself. She was
, technically, but yeah," Harry immediately said, although it's due to the fact that he was shocked to be addressed directly by the people who once bullied them but now became recluse and oddly subdued. Then he immediately felt defensive, "is their something wrong with that?"
"Potter," she said, her tone conveying how inconvenient it is of him to loom over their table. Harry stared resolutely at Malfoy's head, who was still reading his book as if there wasn't anything unusual going on.
was eerily reminiscent of the Battle of Hogwarts, and it didn't help that it was published just a month after the Second Wizarding War. Reading it Harry felt clinical and detached from his emotions, and he can view the war in a different, more colorful and fictional perspective without having to deal with unnecessarily reminiscing painful memories.
The reason why Harry couldn't sleep later that night is not because of the nightmares but because of soft lips and golden skin and playful eyes. Harry smiled throughout the night.
Harry could only growl at the shocked students, powerless at the tone of Malfoy's voice when saying his first name.
"I don't have any afternoon classes tomorrow," he said. Harry frowned at Malfoy but nodded his head.
, the urge to please Malfoy, or Harry's just crazier than he let on. After the unfortunate trip down Snape's sleeping chambers, Draco's mood had abysmally became even more cynical. When Professor McGonagall took 25 points from the Slytherin  after Draco purposefully bumped against a Ravenclaw Muggleborn and spat his once twisted Pureblood ideals that even the blond's fourteen-year-old self would be embarrassed, Harry utilized his flair for the spontaneity to somehow lessen Draco's embarrassment in the wake of this cursed project.
"Please Pansy, give the guy a break," Ginny said, holding her hands and pulling her towards the castle. "We're
“Wait, you shagged Justin before?” Ginevra gaped at her girlfriend, disbelief on her face. Draco would’ve shared Weaslette’s sentiment at the memory if it weren’t for the fact they had just done the dirty on his bed. “I expected better from you, honey—”
There was a chorus of snickers and catcalls throughout the room. Harry was reminded of the scene last Friday night, Nott going down on Neville. He snorted at the identical flustered looks on the pair's faces.
He pulled Draco closer, hoping that Draco felt safe with him just like how Draco made him felt the safest in a long time.
“Quidditch, used to play seeker,” Harry replied. “But it never really worked well. You know the only time I joined the weekend Quidditch game with the seventh and eighth years was... disaster.”
"That overgrown bat definitely out to get us. He probably has some kind of sadistic streak to make all of us fail or embarrass ourselves," Ron grumbled. The three of them stopped a few feet away from door to the classroom and the congregation of Slytherins.
". And right now, as Harry crush the Chizpurfle fangs into very fine powder and added the Salamander blood to the now boiling turquoise potion in the medium-heat cauldron, Harry felt the burning ire and pictured it was Malfoy's head in the mortar that he was crushing. And Harry was sure it's not highly advisable to amplify that feeling.
Harry remembered the disaster of his date with Cho in fifth year, and knew it would not bode well when Ginny said the cursed place. But Harry didn't want to quell the excitement and happiness in Ginny's eyes. It was the first positive emotion he'd seen on the girl's face. Begrudgingly, he acquiesced. With a final glare on Draco, Ginny turned and left.
A glint of gold caught his periphery, and he turned to see an ancient stopwatch sitting innocuously on top of the pillow Draco had lain last night. It was the portkey they used to Godric's, and Draco told him it was a Malfoy heirloom. Harry wondered if Draco left it there in his haste to get out of the Gryffindor boys dorm. But the object was decidedly laid in the pillow, there was no way Draco didn't see it, as if he had left it there on purpose. But why?
"I want to fucking skin that greasy git's ass and feed it to the Giant Squid," Harry spat, baring his teeth as his magic cackled around them. Malfoy tightened his hold around his hand soothingly.
"Shut up!" Harry all but shouted. The four disputing people, and the sobbing Hermione, looked up to Harry all at once. Harry struggled to breathe, to
Harry was met with a sight of Hermione and Ron bickering about Merlin knows what in the Gryffindor table. Harry sat in his usual place with a sullen sigh, staring at his best friends and grimacing at their daily dose of squabbling at the smallest of things. After the war, Ron and Hermione had decided they would continue to where they left off. And Harry was happy for them, sincerely, but there's just too much that Harry could tolerate in the couple's seven-year foreplay before he seriously feel sick.
"Not to sound arrogant, but you were the only person whom I can consider a challenge to fly with," Harry said. Draco's eyebrows arched in surprise. "It would be a pity if you lose your enthusiasm. You're such a good flier."
"Study? Potions?" Ron snorted incredulously. "Yeah, I would when Snape concoct a potion to make his hair less greasy."
Harry stared at the back of Malfoy's head, and wonder to himself why, at that exact moment he wanted his arch rival (the snarky, snobbish all-around arch rival; not this oddly lifeless version of him) to turn his head, sneer at him and say an insult or two about his hair.
"Because it's... Malfoy?" Harry said, still not getting their point. "And we're under the influence of the potions. It doesn't mean anything."
Snape sneered at Hermione. "Slavery? I have you know, Ms Granger, that this potion had underwent multiple clinical trials for two years and hereby presenting no harm of enslavement—"
"It's going to rain, it's probably best to get back inside," he said, hurriedly walking towards the direction of the castle without waiting for Malfoy to follow.
"That's why I asked," Harry snickered. Draco rolled his eyes but his hand traveled to lay at the back of Harry's head, fingers gently tugging on his unruly hair.
"Well, it's not as if there's some crash course about sexuality for Purebloods now, is there?" Ron's face frowned. "Bloody hell. My sister's gay for Pansy Parkinson? It had to be that she-devil?"
"Mate, are you off your rocker?" Ron gaped at him incredulously. "How can you say it's a good idea? We're practically bound to the Slytherins—!"
"Um. Potions partner. You know, Inter-House Cooperation," Harry stood up, both Hermione and Ron stared at both him and Ginny, frowning. Harry collected his things. "I'll be... going then."
"Or else what?" Draco sneered, unable to help himself. "You can't leave me, Potter. Even if I treat you like an appalling House-elf, just like what you deserved to be treated, the potion would not allow you."
"I wasn't aware that the Slytherins were an inconvenience to you, King Weasley," Pansy Parkinson suddenly appeared, inviting herself to sit beside Hermione. Upon catching on the reference, Ron reached across Hermione to slap the back of Parkinson's head. She swiftly swerved from the attack. "And for your information, we were as much a slave as you mighty Gryffindors were, so don't feel so special."
Until he resigned to the fact that he will always be alone, trapped in his cupboard, with no food and water and a companion to keep him safe. Harry grew up without the experience of having someone holding him close for assurance and mollycoddling him just like what Petunia did to Dudley. And Harry, now older, felt uncomfortable at the barest human touch and being inquisitive and unsettled at the smallest hints of other people's kindness.
Harry did, his lashes grazing against the surface of Draco’s palm. It was gone too soon, and Harry was about to open his eyes, when a finger caressed the line on his nose. The finger gracefully danced across his face, down the planes of his jaw, brushed his hair lightly before returning to his brows and closed lids and the curve of his lips. Harry’s muscles gradually eased, and soon after, his breath stabled and his body went limp. He was slowly falling into the painfully blissful void of unconsciousness and the fear suddenly gripped him.
“As I said, a theory. About the Histrionicus Potion,” Pansy went on sternly, glaring defiantly. “Blaise and Granger are correct in some ways. While there are certainly issues of non-consent, it is not entirely enslavement, per se. Well, not to certain mutualistic standings, anyway.”
"I'm really sorry," Harry earnestly said once again. "It's my Muggle relatives. You know how... nasty my childhood was." Nasty doesn't even begin to cover everything, but he looked at Hermione beseechingly to make her understand. He still couldn't make himself talk about it after all this time.
Malfoy, the arch rival. The feeling of being brought back to the earlier years of rivalry and petty one-upmanship, which felt like ages ago, was disorienting. Harry was left staring, gawking, at Malfoy's sardonic expression.
But the thing is, odd things had always happened where Harry is involved. When he found himself at the rooftop after being chased by Dudley and his gang; when he was suddenly at a tree after being hounded by Aunt Marge’s dog without remembering having to climb up the trunk; when he luckily got away from Voldemort and his Death Eaters at the graveyard. And in the grand scheme of things, courageously betraying one of his weaknesses to Draco Malfoy (of all people!) weighed no more than all the life-and-deaths and you’re-a-wizard-Harry’s and freakish connections with a dark lord.
Harry stared unseeingly into the heavily gloomy skies and wondered why it was too hard for him to wrap his head around Draco owning up to his mistakes. Maybe Harry was just too hard on Draco, too judgmental. But he knew the blond for too long, and Draco Malfoy's head was too far up his ass to even ask for forgiveness.
"Er, Dumbledore wanted to see you in his office," the little boy immediately run away after hearing Harry's growl.
"Draco," Harry called quietly, but just as firmly. Draco turned to look at him, his quicksilver eyes were filled with guilt and shame. Harry tucked a few loose strands of wavy locks behind Draco's ear, appreciating how beautiful Draco looked, fucking glowing in the firelight. "It isn't your fault, okay? You were grieving, that's understandable. And you had just drank a potion to augment what you're feeling. Well... the Unforgivables should've been avoided, but it's not as if anyone should know about that."
, the giddiness he felt at the object of his fondness (Harry will have to hate himself later for even putting it that way), or the longing to hear that biting voice (Harry never sounded so masochistic in his entire traumatized life)—but Harry jumped in his chair and practically flung himself at Malfoy's body.
"Hear hear, Draco," Potter said in a pleasant tone. "Don't be nasty to me. I'm here to 'mediate' you, remember?" Potter placed both his hands on Draco's shoulders. He had a mock pout on his lips that had Draco bristling. "What would happen if you don't have me? I know you value your pride so much, it would not be good to continue embarrassing yourself. You should stop treating me nastily, or else..." Potter added in a faux threatening tone, that to Draco sounded ridiculous coming from his righteous mouth.
Harry didn't even try to keep up with Draco's steps, just let him get dragged toward the eighth year tower. The havoc of mental dolefulness and heavy dread slammed into him full force, making him dizzy and distressed. His chest breathed in and expanded, air sharp against his sternum. Harry didn't even register the buzzing in his ears until he was surrounded with what he knew were voices but distorted, as they reached the eight year Common Room.
Hermione slapped him gently on his arms and huffed, "I didn't know Purebloods have the same skewed perspective about gender and sexuality like Muggles. I certainly never expected it from you, Ron."
Malfoy's expressionless eyes focused on his and Ginny's entwined hands. For absolutely no reason, Harry hastily disconnected his hand from Ginny's. He thought he heard her snicker, but chose to ignore it.
Harry wondered why they had this talk in the Great Hall, of all places. It was so heavy a subject and being surrounded with people with only a thin veil of a Muffling charm to separate them kind of make the whole point dull, like some sort of parody. If they were in a more appropriate, sacredly quiet room, the heaviness of the conversation would be more conciliating to the point of the problem. Though Harry also doesn't know if he could ever have any strength to postpone this some other time or courage to initiate this
potion for your term project," Snape drawled, flicking his wand at the board as the ingredients and processes materialized.
"It's the bloody potion," Harry mumbled, mind going blissfully fuzzy on the edges. He wanted to sleep. And maybe he can, with Draco's heavenly arms around him.
Ron had a relatively welcoming change after the War. Aside from the added firm muscles on his physique that he had acquired on his daily work-out (his chosen recreation), Ron became less grumpy and more tolerant and understanding. He even indulged Hermione on her nightly library session (her chosen recreation,
. He still wanted to defend Malfoy, still stuck literally beside him, still wanted to please him. But everytime he tried touching the blond, comfort him, Harry was brought back to the picnic by the lake, words rotating in his mind like a limbo, he felt like a rubber band stretched to its capacity; straining him until the point of wanting to explode.
Harry was briefly reminded of the time in fifth year when he asked Nearly Headless Nick if Sirius could somehow come back as a ghost. Thinking about it now, it seemed a little barmy but he was angry and in sorrow then. Harry truly understood where Ginny came.

Harry stared at Draco with obvious fondness and amusement as the blond went on his rant. His heart was thumping loudly against his chest, and there was a bubbling feeling of delightful yearning deep in his gut at every twitch in Draco's cute expression. Harry wasn't much of a dunce to not realize that he was very much taken to Draco, desperately so, and if he were being honest, for years now.

"Thank you," Draco whispered some time later. He broke free from the hug to wipe his face, voice was raw and sincere. "For listening and understanding."

Malfoy looking at him like that when he was completely compos mentis was different, and all together overwhelming, than under the influence of the Sedatus. Harry's breath quickened.
Not being able to cry after witnessing the deaths of Cedric and Sirius and so many others during the war was, apparently, not normal and an indicative of a deeper, sinister psychological scar.
"Let's just get on with this," Harry grumbled, pulling the tube to his mouth and tipping back his head.
Harry fell limply on his red- and gold-clad bed and groaned when his taut muscles creaked sickeningly. The events that followed Lucius' burial and what happened by the manor's stream were few moments that Harry didn't want to rekindle ever again.
