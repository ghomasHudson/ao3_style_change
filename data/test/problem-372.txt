And that was another thing. Harry tried to understand that it was important to Draco and Tindles that Tindles be allowed to come here and care for them. Harry had worked with Draco to compromise, to allow the elf to come and do the extra work, like laundry and floors and bathrooms. He did his best to honour Draco's and Tindles' wishes, to not do those things so that Tindles had work to do a few nights a week. So why couldn't Draco honour Harry's wishes to just throw the damned trash away when he was done cooking and wipe up after himself?
By the time Draco entered the room, a book tucked under his arm, Harry was seething, sweat dripping down into his eyes. He was reorganising the pantry as he'd already cleaned everything else he could see, but he needed to keep moving, needed to get the irritation out of his body.
Molly smiled. "I walked into the kitchen and there he was, his eyes wide and taking in all the things going on. I didn't realise it at the time, but it was the first time in his memory of being in a magical home. He was so innocent, so shy. He was afraid to ask for anything, even though he was practically starving at the time. I decided then and there that he was going to be one of mine. I didn't care if he didn't come from me, or if he was the Boy Who Lived. All I knew was that he was a little boy without a family, and I suddenly recognised the Harry-sized hole that had been in our family this entire time, and we hadn't noticed."
The real perpetrators were buried just that morning, and no amount of revenge would ever touch them. Except, maybe, their son embracing the nephew they'd rejected. Draco closed the door to the cupboard and stepped back.
Always, though, the story would end with Amil's kind and simple manners offering the people a ray of hope in their lives. Like Teddy had for me.
Harry nodded, unable to form any words with his thoughts so muddled, so he took out his essay and handed it over to Draco, who began to read.
Draco managed to focus on the face that was suddenly inches in front of his own. Chocolate-brown eyes, bushy, brown hair. "Herâ€”" he managed to get out.
Draco felt the panic rise up in his throat. "Harry," he heard the plea in his voice. "This isn't about
"Harry?" Dudley said after a few moments, and Harry realised he must have been silent for at least a minute or so. "Are you still there?"
"There's this Muggle pub in Glasgow that Pansy and I went to over the summer. They have this amazing entertainment that I think you'll like. It's a lot of fun, and we can open up the offer to whoever would like to join us. Maybe you can get Granger out of the castle for a while. I'm sure Pansy and Theo will be amenable, and Pansy will get Bones to come along."
Dudley nodded. "Yeah, I can see that. They wouldn't let him eat much usually. They made him cook for us, but then he was only allowed to have whatever it was we didn't want."
"Dracoâ€”" Harry's voice was rough and he stopped to clear his throat. "I know what I want. And I think you do too."
"You're right. I don't understand what it's like to have a family legacy. I wanted to help, but I didn't consider what that meant and I put you in an awkward position. I'm sorry." Harry's voice was so quiet, so earnest, that Draco didn't know what to say. This wasn't how this conversation was supposed to go.
He slowly got out of bed and moved to the door, shushing Lyra as soon as he opened the door. "Alex is asleep in my room. He had nightmares," Draco explained, closing his eyes as the morning light from Lyra's room made his head pound.
Updated later the same night to add: Chapter 8 finally let me finish it, and hang on to your hats, friends, because this story will be bumping to an M rating. Just a little teaser for you. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‹
They both had that "worried about Harry" look on their faces, and I felt my shoulders stiffen. "I'm fine," I said automatically.
The tenderness was almost Harry's undoing. He needed to get out of there, to go take a shower and wash off the sweat he'd worked up while cleaning, the feeling of disgust that came over him every time Petunia's words teased at his mind. And the water falling over his face would disguise the tears he felt burning behind his eyes.
They were settled in the living room, and Alex was curled up on Draco's lap as they finished reading a book. Harry sat at the other end of the sofa and met Draco's eye. Draco nodded.
Draco hummed from the bathroom where he was applying his face cream. "Well, hormones, I guess. And she's not that different. She's justâ€¦grumpy."
Alex's cheeks turned pink, and he stepped closer to her, not saying anything as the doors opened and they emerged onto Harry's floor. His steps slowed, though, as they approached Harry's room, even as Lyra's went faster.
"What? Why?" Harry turned his full attention onto the young woman before him. Her jet black hair and severe fringe framed her pale face in the evening light, but she didn't look concerned, so Harry tried to force his unexplained worry away.
Draco grinned, making Harry's stomach bubble in excitement. "Then get on with it. The man has a picture to take."
"All right. Come on, Scarhead. Let's get you home where you can mope and lament in privacy. The last thing you need right now is the bloody
But he couldn't do that. Harry, just Harry, wasn't what everyone expected, what everyone asked for. Harry didn't want to be an Auror. He wasn't sure what he wanted, but whatever it was, he wanted something peaceful, something quiet. And he certainly wasn't interested in settling down with a
It was perfect, and it was theirs. When Draco had asked Harry to move in with him, neither of them were eager to live in either Grimmauld Place or the manor. It was likely why Harry had initially seemed so nervous about the proposed venture. At least, that's what Draco hoped, because Harry couldn't possibly be nervous about moving in with Draco. Right?
Harry laughed. "Fuck you," he said and captured Draco's soft lips with his. It was even better than the first time because now Harry knew it was what he wanted and that Draco seemed to want it too. A cheer finally caught his attention from the direction of the table where his friends sat, closely followed by much of the pub. Harry didn't hurry the kiss, though, and indulged himself in Draco's tongue caressing his own.
"Yours." Harry turned his back on Draco, and Draco's stomach went cold. Harry's voice was quiet as he pulled on his wand harness and grabbed his cloak. "Right. Well, I'll just go, then, and let you deal with what's yours. Don't forget Lyra's spending the night with Molly and Rosie tonight. I might be late getting home."
"What is there to explain? You were right. I was so wrapped up in my head as to what wasâ€”and what wasn'tâ€”a Malfoy problem that I wasn't fucking thinking clearly."
"Went to talk to Dudley," Ginny said. She laid her head on Harry's shoulder. "I can't believe you came back here. You're so fucking brave."
"Yes," Draco answered, turning in Harry's arms and running his fingers along Harry's collar. "Like putting all this shit away so we have a bloody place to sleep tonight." He pushed Harry away.
Alex nodded, but wrapped one arm tightly around Draco's shoulder and put his other thumb in his mouth.
"How do you possibly have this many shoes? I've seen your closet at the Manor. There were not this many."
Teddy gripped the arms of his chair tightly, and Draco let him consider as they approached Harry's room.
"I want to make up for it, Draco. I want to apologise when he's ready. I want to be his family if he'll let me. I know I have a lot to make up for, but I want to try. For both of us."
"Stop it," Pansy's voice cut him off, a cup of tea suddenly appearing in his hands. "Granger's teams are tracking the coin. You've saved them hours, Draco." He looked down at the teacup in front of him, wondering what he was supposed to do with it. "Drink."
Lyra ran back to him and grabbed his hand, pulling him across the room until they reached a large rug hanging on the wall. "This is it."
Draco smiled to himself, recognizing the small size of the body at his back, and he slowly rolled over, ready to cuddle with the little girl. Instead, he was met with a small head of brown curls tucked into a ball, his head having been what had been wedged into Draco's back.
"You're his family," Draco said quietly. Because as much as he'd never met this Dudley and only vaguely knew there was a cousin, he knew what family meant to Harry. Of course, Harry would want to be there. "I really am sorry about your parents. We'll see you soon."
She'd known the basics. She'd known her dad was famous and a hero, and she'd known that her pa had been on the opposite side of the war, that they'd not even been friends until years later, when Teddy was a little boy.
"Hermione," Draco said quietly, "can you take Lyra and Helen out for a few minutes? I want to talk to Harry."
She gave his arm an encouraging squeeze. "What is it that they say in that film? Just keep swimming?"
"Harder than pulling him away from us now, only days after his parents were murdered before his eyes? Merlin, Harry, I can't imagine. And how can we know these supposed foster parents know how to handle that? Do they have the time? Will they care? Will they understand him?"

"There was a Potions accident," Hermione said, her voice thick with tears. "Her entire lab was destroyed."
Draco stopped before opening the door and turned, nearly knocking Harry over. "Harry, when was the last time you bought your own clothes, or chose your own food, or even decided on a haircut?"
She sat quietly for nearly a minute, then started speaking in a thoughtful tone. "Did I ever tell you about the second time I ever met Harry?"
Draco held his face in place, refusing to let her see his fear. "I'm not sure. Hermione is at the Ministry. She'll be here soon and hopefully, he'll be with her."
Draco's smile spread. "Well, then, she's a Hufflepuff, so I'm going to assume she's partial to bright colours and informal displays, am I right?"
Merlin, Draco hoped she was right. A noise at the door caught his attention, and he remembered the other child currently in his care.
Accidental magic. Hermione had said that Harry had taken a call with Teddy to follow up on some accidental magic, which meant that Alex had likely witnessed more than just Harry's attack, the child's magic flaring to protect himself, maybe.
"Papa! Daddy!" Lyra cried between sobs. "I'm in trouble and Alex isn't, and it's not fair. He hit me first."
When that changed, when they'd decided to actually try to have a relationship, they were overly careful around one another. Harry wouldn't keep any of his things at the manor, always leaving before either could fall asleep or get too comfortable. Draco followed his lead and did the same, escaping through the Floo of Grimmauld Place late at night like he was afraid of being caught.
Draco found me like that, sitting on the chair in my back garden, staring out at the autumn leaves changing colour at the edge of the property.
"Uh, yeah. I had to stop before, er, you know." Harry's face was flaming, but the room was dark and he was sure Draco couldn't see it. But Draco had done this for him, and he felt like he owed him the truth.
"Okay then." Draco smiled then took the shampoo bottle from Harry. "Let me? I want to take care of you tonight."
Hermione smiled. "I thought that might be it. I asked Helen about it, and there are a good deal of legal documents that'll need to be signed. A formal inspection of the home will have to be made, and he needs a private space set up in the house for a bedroom."
Teddy looked interested and sat back, thinking. "Well, I mean, we talked about it from as early as I can remember. I had questions about my parents, and he was always careful not to lie about anything, even if he didn't tell me more than I was ready to hear."
"You and Draco. I would never have thought that you'd get on so well, but it's like he makes you happy."
Draco smiled. "Do what you think is necessary. I just don't want that little boy to suffer again so soon. He needs at least a few more days of stability before things change again."
Draco sighed, because she had a point. "So, Alexander and Sophia Torres Obliviated Sophia's siblings and sent them to Canada."
"Come on. It's freezing out here. Let's go inside," I said, then stopped, confused. "Hold on, why didn't you wait inside? You could have just Floo-ed in."
Sitting down on the side of the bed, Draco gently tried to soothe the boy, his heart breaking. "Alex. Wake up, buddy. You're okay." What else could he say? He'd always soothed Lyra with reassurances that the nightmare was only that, just a bad dream, but Alex's parents were gone and everything wasn't just a nightmare. "You're safe."
"It was perfectly called for. I fucked up. I know I did. If you think I haven't replayed our argument hundreds of times in the last three weeks, realising exactly how much of an arse I was and how ridiculous I sounded, then you're drastically underestimating my ability to self-flagellate."
Harry muted the telly, the old movie they'd both seen a dozen times continuing on silently. "Are you ready to talk about it?"
"Yeah, it's disgusting. She won't stop talking about her. Like, seriously, we're only thirteen. Gross."
While the floor of the cupboard was completely bare â€” no boxes, no cleaning supplies, just empty â€” the walls were not. Crayon drawings lined the back wall like cave drawings â€” childish drawings of animals and jungles, wolves, stags, and large black dogs. Pushed to the back of the cupboard, packed up tight against the wall where Draco hadn't seen it at first, was what appeared to be an old camp cot, the kind that folded down with no mattress, just canvas on sticks.
Draco nodded and proceeded to fill Harry in on everything Hermione had told him. Harry listened, sitting in his boxers on the bed, absorbing every word and analysing every piece of information.
Draco's throat clenched shut at the simple words, clearer now that his husband's throat was sufficiently wet. He put the cup back down and busied himself, grabbing Harry's glasses off the table and placing them next to his handâ€”the Healers had removed his contact lenses when they put him under Stasis, so he probably couldn't see much of anything yetâ€”before starting to straighten the blankets that were already perfectly straight.
"Just say it, Mother," he said after setting down his tea. He reached over to start cleaning up the parchments and ledger books.
"And if he made them mad, they'd lock him in here with nothing to eat. He was in here for almost three days, once."
She approached and tried to reach out to Alex, but he just buried his face in Draco's neck. "What if we go with Draco, Alex? I can show you where Lyra sleeps and you can take a bath in her bathtub."
Harry sighed and this time, his yawn was long and drawn out, and his head fell to the side. "I'm so tired. I think I need to sleep some more. Will you lie with me?"
I placed my hand on the door handle and turned, but I avoided Draco's eyes. "Oh, and I just wanted to say I'm sorry for being an arse the other night. You were right."
She smiled weakly. "If they trust you, it's possible. Unfortunately, Laurel, the woman in charge of Alex at the moment, hasn't been able to track down any family or other adults who he'd trust."
Blood rushed in his ears, blocking out Dudley's voice about the specifics of the accident. Petunia and Vernon were dead. What was he even supposed to do with that? What was he supposed to feel?
"Mrs Robinson," Harry said, long ago resigned to the opinions of Petunia's old biddies, "Aunt Petunia would be glad you came today. Thank you."
Harry was watching them closely, and Draco could see his mind turning through the details. "He's going to need therapy, I'd think. And extra attention."
"Right, so, uh, flowers. I wanted to buy flowers for my partner. I bit her head off this morning and need to grovel."
Harry considered. Draco didn't really have a lot of other options. With Lucius in Azkaban, Narcissa and Draco Malfoy were barely tolerated amongst the wizarding public after the war and had finally just melted away into the background. Harry hadn't really thought about him in a couple of years.
His throat was on fire, the tears fighting to escape. "Yeah. That's good." She held out a cup of tea and Harry took it, unable to deny Luna anything. "Where's Draco?" he asked, forcing down a small sip. It helped.
He sat in the window seat in the common room, his attention flickering between the dreary winter landscape outside the window and the animation of Draco Malfoy and their schoolmates playing Muggle cards by the fire. After about twenty minutes of it, the laughter spilling through the room, Draco caught Harry's gaze and cocked his head, staring. He leaned over and said something to the group, and they waved him away as he stood and walked to the doorway heading to the boys' dormitories. Stopping at the threshold, he turned to Harry and gave a slight nod, gesturing for Harry to follow.
Draco's mind swirled the information around in his head all through dinner. Every time he looked at Alex, he could only think of what Hermione had told him. He was simultaneously heartbroken for the boy and hopeful that he'd get the chance to raise this beautiful child. The hours until he could talk to Harry alone were agonising.
The longer I considered, the more I could admit that the idea excited me. I still wasn't doing anything with my life other than raising Teddy, and it was boring when he was in school each morning. This was something small I could do to keep myself entertained, but I was sure nothing would come from it.
"Whatever. So, I'm going to sing, even if it makes me a little nervous. And you're going to find someone to kiss, even though it makes
Harry stared at him, searching for something that Draco could only guess, but when he spoke, his voice was thoughtful. "It won't be easy. The Healers say I'm not going to be back to normal for a few weeks. And your work is going to fall behind."
Molly had left some pasta, so he heated that for all three of them and made sure everyone ate at least a few bites. Alex was a bit of a struggle, there, but Lyra's giggles when she dropped the noodles into her mouth coaxed the other child into eating.
Draco leaned into the man; I felt the breath leave me, and I struggled to suck in a new one. I stood frozen, watching, my head swimming as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.
"When I got bigger," Harry continued, his cadence similar to Draco's when he'd been reading the story, "I met the Weasleys, and they became my new family. They took care of me and loved me. That's Molly and Arthur. You know them."
Teddy sighed. "It's what he told Draco. Harry has always had a guilt complex. He once apologised to me for my parents' death, as if he could have prevented it. He expected me to hate him for that."
I met Malfoy's eyes once more, and this time, the smile filled his face, transforming it into something bright and open.
"Just be there for him, Draco. And we'll be there too, don't you worry. Text us the information when you have it."
Harry's nose started to run, but he didn't realise he was crying until he tasted a tear. "Then what are you saying?" His chest was so tight. "Because I've had a bloody terrible day and none of this is making any sense."
Harry set his bags down inside the door of their flat and listened. It was silent, only the whir of the refrigerator disturbing the quiet, and he heaved a long sigh. He'd really hoped Draco would be home, that it wouldn't be too late.
Draco nodded, thankful for Hermione's down-to-business attitude. He didn't know if he could handle sympathy at the moment.
All of the eighth-years had received private dormitory rooms upon returning for school after the war. Immediately after the final battle, Harry would have loathed the silence this created, so used to the sounds of Ron and Hermione's presence after months in a tent. But the summer had been long and Harry had moved into Bill's old room at the Burrow, gradually becoming reaccustomed to a modicum of privacy.
"Oh, hey, Mr Malfoy," Charlotte said, pulling away from Teddy and standing up straight, her normally pale face turning pink under her dark-blonde curls. "I, uh, was just checking on Teddy."
"For dating?" Hermione asked, amusement in her voice. "Definitely. For crushes? Not at all. Not if you're not too distracted with Basilisks and Dementors, it's not."
How hard was it to just clean up after yourself as you went? Did he not care that this was something that ate at Harry? That Harry couldn't just let it sit there or he'd begin to hear Aunt Petunia's voice in his head, screaming at him to '
"Boscombe. Beautiful, isn't it?" Hermione's hair was blowing in the evening breeze, and she was glowing with happiness. I put my arm around her, determined to push my lousy mood away for her sake.
She started to snap at him but caught herself. It wasn't his fault she was in such a foul mood, and he didn't have a pet of his own since Cat died the previous month. She ruffled his brown curls and gave him a little smile. "Sure, baby bro."
She sighed. Teddy wasn't going to leave it alone. He never did, when she was upset. He always knew, and he'd get it out of her. Maybe that was why she'd been so happy to see him.
The next day, it was all I could think about, but in the solitude of my house, walking past Teddy's empty bedroom, I couldn't find the glee of the previous evening.
He pushed out around Harry and approached the stage, looking through a book of songs, and Harry watched the flashing lights reflecting off his blond hair.
"Thanks, everyone. I'm going to sing a song tonight that means a lot to me, and I hope it resonates with you too. I dedicate this song to my father." He met Harry's eyes and raised his eyebrows with a grin.
Draco closed his eyes, admitting defeat. "Fine." He sighed and looked at his husband. The colour had mostly returned to his face, and he looked well, but tired. "Lyra will want to see you."
done tours in the past, which made sense. You had Teddy at home and you needed to be here. But he's at Hogwarts now."
Draco smiled, trying to hide the waves of surprise and relief he felt rushing through him at Lyra's reveal. He sat down on the bed next to where Teddy was perched and looked at the young man, searching for any clue as to what his godson was feeling.
So, as he dropped Lyra with Molly for her Grandma-and-cousin-sleepover, Draco put his plan into action.
He took a deep breath. He trusted Hermione, but he didn't like the entire situation. He tried to put it out of his mind and turned to the kids.
"The Healers. Harry and I went in there, and those people were already dead. And then that man, he looked insane; he started hurling curses and there wasn't anything we could do. Even if those people had been alive, though, we couldn't have saved them. We didn't have the skills. Instead, we just got ourselves hurt, and then tried to get away. The people here, the Healers, they saved us."
Draco and I had standing tickets for the first Magpies home game every month, so that weekend, I gathered my things, layered up against the Scottish, October chill, and headed out. Draco generally met me in his box, so I tugged the hood of my jumper up over my head and Apparated to the stadium.
"Hey!" He glared at her, but she got up and started cleaning up, putting her lunch things away, so he thought about what she'd said. The Breddings biographyâ€”the
"Fine, whatever," Harry agreed, willing to say anything to make this conversation end. He turned to the room. "Do we need to do anything, then, before people arrive?"
Teddy nodded. "Yeah, I think I am. I'm going to tell Gram about it tonight, but I think she'll be relieved."
But standing outside the little stone fence that separated the front garden from the one-laned, dirt road, it looked empty. The windows that usually invited me in looked hollow, devoid of life. The stone path was overgrown with weeds, and all I could see when I looked at it was the work that needed doing, everything I'd avoided doing over Teddy's final summer before Hogwarts.
He closed his eyes and shook his head, unable to get the words out without dissolving back into tears.
Teddy nodded and shoved the wheels of his chair back towards the door. "Yeah. Yeah, there are, aren't there?"
Harry looked at Draco nervously. Alex never spoke all that much, but he definitely knew how to let them know how he was feeling. In contrast, the silence was nerve-wracking.
Alex's smile made her shoulders relax. Little brothers could be a bother, but hers was nice to be around. Usually. It was probably because she got to pick him out instead of being stuck with whatever nature cursed her with, or so she teased.
St Mungo's felt completely different than it had the night before. Healers swarmed the area and Aurors guarded the hallways, but they nodded Draco through to where he found a sea of redheads waiting.
Harry watched Draco closely, waiting for the questions, the reactions, the rejections. Draco had promised nothing would be different, but it already was. He could see it in Draco's eyes.
Lyra sat up, tears in her eyes. "That can happen?" She sounded panicked. "Someone can murder your family and you have to go live somewhere else?" She started to cry in earnest. "Papa?"
Harry had been so adamant that he could do this, that he could give this talk. It was important, he'd said, and it might help someone else. If it twisted Harry up inside, drawing forth memories of past pain, then Harry would fight through it and Draco would be there for him as he did.
"I realised later that morning that I'd fucked up. If nothing else, I could have at least heard you out and let you contribute ideas. It wasn't until days later that I really understood the bigger picture."
, sleeping on the small cot he'd conjured next to Harry's bed. He couldn't imagine what this child had been through in only twenty-four hours. Losing both his parents, seeing his uncle, someone he should have been able to trust, attacking his only family, must have been too much for the child to understand.
Draco knew better than to argue with her, so he considered her words as he took Lyra home. 'Together,' she'd said, and dammit if that didn't hit a little too close. He and Harry had always, since those first few months, agreed to take things on together. To go through life as partners.
I finished assembling the dinner and shoved it in the oven, then hit the room with a few cleaning spells.
Andi nodded. "Whoever got him back here that quickly is a hero. It's doubtful he was able to trigger the Portkey himself."
Before he came to any conclusions, Draco turned back with a gentle smile. "Okay, so, here's where you went wrong."
Harry saw the first people beginning to arrive and shook his head. He said he'd be here with Dudley, and so he would. He
"Medium, I guess," Harry said, thinking of Charlie's shoulder-length hair, then noticing Draco's hair that now fell about his own shoulders. Weird.
creating this with you. Collaborating on just about every step of the process was new and exciting and again, I am SO LUCKY to have been paired with such a stellar author. ðŸ¥° - Phe
It was only about thirty seconds later that Hermione stepped through the flames followed closely by Ron. She dropped down onto her knees in front of Draco's feet. "What's going on?" she asked quietly. "What do you mean Teddy is at St Mungo's, and why would it have anything to do with Harry?"
My eyes met Malfoy's grey ones, and I wondered if I looked as unsure as he did. Malfoy took a deep breath and held out his hand. I stared for a moment, hoping I wasn't an idiot for believing this offer of peace.
"Burgundy," Neville supplied. "That would look good on you, mate." He gave Harry an encouraging smile, and Harry was suddenly grateful for the other boy's supporting presence.
Draco moved his hand, revelling in the familiar weight and texture of his husband. He slipped his thumb over the slit and swirled it around, something that generally drove the other man mad.
"Hmm, that's the game now, then, is it?" Draco turned onto his side, crooked his arm, and propped his head on his hand. "Fine. My family invited a dark lord into my home and forced me to take the mark."
Of course, he was. And that's what Harry was so afraid of. The light changed and Harry drove on. "Don't worry. You'll understand soon enough, I reckon."
Grandmother winked at Alex and took his hand as they left the room. The room where he was now part of his Papa's family tree.
"Hey, we're taking a break to eat," Harry said, popping his messy head into the closet. "Ginny went to get some sandwiches and chips from the shop up the road. Can you help me set up the dining table so we have a place to sit?"
The question of whether or not Draco wanted me in return didn't even register. It was irrelevant. He was back with Gathii who made him happy. I knew this; I'd seen it.
Well, Harry had been doing a good job of hiding it from him. He just wasn't sure how long he could keep that up.
"That he makes you happy? It's clear he does, Harry. He seems to understand what you need like the rest of us only wish we could. I mean, Ron and I understand what you're feeling a good deal of the time, but we never manage to pull you out of it. But Draco, he seems to do it every time." She took a sip of her wine and smiled sadly. "And since you've become friends, it's like you're
"Well, I mean, twenty years of therapy has to count for something, right?" Harry pulled Draco to his side as they hesitated before the door, and he wrapped his arms around him. "It's good to be home, though."
Instead, he walked into the sterile-smelling hospital room and stared at the person who formed the cornerstone of that family lying unconscious on the bed. It seemed like days ago instead of just a matter of hours since he'd walked in to see Teddy in another room, the same monitoring charms displayed above his unconscious body.
"How do you think they do it?" he asked after a few minutes, grateful it was just the three of them. "The Slytherins, that is. I mean, with everything that's been happening, their families falling out of power, the reparations, the anger from the press that so many of them got offâ€”"
"Interesting," Draco said in the quiet when the song ended and Hermione turned it off. "So, we've figured out your oddly loud and yet unsurprising taste in music."
"Not for that! Dad, all these people love you for this really crazy, amazing thing you did for them, and I didn't even know about it. Me. Your own daughter. I felt like you'd lied to me my whole life, and when I found out what happened, it was like everything was different, and I was at school and couldn't even talk to you about it."
"No, wait! I didn't say that," Harry said quickly, looking for an excuse for why he felt so suddenly afraid. "I just, uh, well, my breath smells like crisps."
"I'm he-ere!" Ginny chimed, bursting through the door with sacks of food that smelled amazing. She placed the bags into the centre of the table as everyone gathered around. "Oi! Vultures. Not even a word of thanks."
"Okay, spill it," Harry said as he entered their bedroom, both of the children tucked into bed and the house dark. "You've looked like you might explode with whatever it is for hours."
Draco tried one more time to make Harry understand. "Look, the problems at the manor are decades in the making. I need to take a look at the estate and see how I can make it profitable again. That's not something you can just go in and save, as much as you love doing that."
"Yes, jealous. They're getting ready to start this whole new adventure, but it's theirs, and I'm just finishing mine. Teddy's gone off to Hogwarts, and I'm just here, waiting, with nothing in front of me, nobody to love me, no future to look forward to." The words sounded bitter, but I was feeling bitter.
Draco's heart twisted. Their Teddy. He nodded. "Do I look all right? I don't want to upset him or anything."
He ran his tongue over his lips, hoping they weren't too dry or anything. Harry saw Draco's grey eyes fall to watch him, and Harry blushed, pulling his tongue back in. Merlin, he couldn't do anything right, could he?
Harry moved closer and wrapped his arms around them both. "Teddy and Lyra will be home soon. What can we do to surprise them?"
"Harry brought him stew," Kreacher hissed, saying Harry's name like a curse word. "Kreacher brought him proper food. Roasted salmon and asparagus with a lemon-dill sauce."
He shuffled the glass of wine to the side and pushed up his sleeves in aggravation, picking up the sponge by the sink and starting to clean. His rant continued in his head as he went, irritably scrubbing at the drops of wine that had fallen onto the granite countertops as Draco cooked. Rosemary needles and thyme leaves were littered everywhere, even the floor, onion peels were in the sink, potatoes skins on a plate next to the cooktop.
"Malfoy, Potter, you're paired up," Trainer Jeffreys ordered. "Get up here and show everyone how it's done. I expect the two of you to set the standard for the rest of the class."
Her eyes fell on Rose, who continued to chat, happy to be home for the summer, and she wished she could be more like her. Rose didn't seem phased by what they'd learned. It was all facts and 'so interesting' and 'maybe I can interview Mum about it over the summer for a project.' But maybe it was because her parents were still her parents, still simply war heroes that helped Dad in the war, and nothing had really changed for her.
"I could, or you could just Floo from my office if you like. Then we canâ€¦catch upâ€¦while I put together the bouquet."
"You're twisting my words," Draco spat out, goaded now and no longer able to hold on to any pretence of calm. "But you can't deny that you like to fix things, and this isn't yours to fix! It's mine."
"And leave your phone here," he added before she escaped, knowing that was the only real punishment that seemed to make a difference these days.
Harry nodded and together they took a seat in one of the side pews, out of the way of prying eyes. He squeezed Harry's hand, and Harry closed his eyes and squeezed back. "Thank you," he said quietly.
Alex's are different from Lyra's, but they're special. The first notes play and make him bury his face in Daddy's neck as Daddy and Lyra begin to sing.
His senses began to clear, and Hermione eased him onto a chair he'd not noticed until that moment. She stayed with him, slowly breathing, no longer speaking.
Harry parked the car on the street in front of the house next door, turned off the engine, and simply stared.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, bracing himself. "He was hurt too, but he's at the hospital and already almost better. I bet you'll be able to see him tomorrow."

"Was it really that bad, then?" Harry's voice was soft when he spoke after a while. "How long was I out?"
Teddy narrowed his eyes, looking for a trick, but when Draco moved the chair he, himself, had been sitting in and transfigured it into a wheelchair, the younger man finally relaxed and nodded. "Okay, then." He sat down in the chair when it reached him, then looked up at Draco, his voice barely audible now. "Please tell me. I need to know."
"Well, there was definitely some fucking involved." Pansy's smirk morphed into a distant, dreamy look that made her look nauseated. Or maybe it just made Draco nauseated. Either way, there was puke involved.
He raised an eyebrow and glanced to the window seat where Lyra was eating a biscuit and playing with some blocks, her green eyes intent on the toys in front of her. "Nothing," he said quietly. "I'm just trying to work out some solutions. I'll need to research alternative farming methods, and maybe if we bring in a new steward, we canâ€”"
"I don't know," Draco said, sitting up. His voice sounded rough, like he'd been yelling for hours. "They have him, and he's alive."
Harry whirled on him. "That's what you think this is? That I just feel the need to save things and am compelled to help?" His voice was harsh. "Gods, Draco, you'd think after fifteen years together, you'd understand me better than that."
Draco's jaw dropped slowly open. He looked like he was about to say something, but nothing came out. He blinked several times, and Harry would have chuckled if he wasn't busy trying not to cringe at his own confession.
Draco's blush was almost invisible in the dim light. Almost. "Just because you haven't heard me doesn't mean I can't. It's not like I can sing the songs you've been listening to lately. I can't even tell what they're saying in some of those songs."
Like a house-elf. The puzzle pieces began to snap into place, and Draco suddenly had so many questions he had to ask, he had to know, and as much as he didn't want to hear the answers, he
Alex's head moved, and Draco assumed it must have been a nod because Hermione went to gather her things. "Wonderful. Andromeda is going to stay with Harry while we're gone. I noticed her at the door a moment ago, but she waited when she saw Alex was upset."
Dudley looked around the room that overlooked the living room and his shoulders fell. Susanne stepped up close, wrapping an arm around his. "Tell him, Dudley."
She couldn't stand it anymore. She crawled over and wrapped her arms around him and buried her face in his shoulder like she was a little girl again. He held her tight, the silence soothing her mind. "I'm sorry I've been so mean."
"All right then," she said, taking another sip but keeping her eyes trained on him. "Your relationship is very different from those you saw growing up. Your father and I had separate roles in our marriage, in our lives, and even in our parenting."
"Harry and Teddy left the ministry together around five o'clock this afternoon. A call had come in about a routine underage magic report in Durham, and Auror Michelson says Harry thought it'd be a decent training opportunity for Teddy. He claimed it'd be a good experience talking to witnesses and calling in Obliviators, if necessary, and then following through on filing the required paperwork after. Officially, Harry's name is on the sheets for Auror assigned to the call, so when Teddy came in, it didn't flag Harry's case."
"Lower your voice. You're going to wake Lyra." Draco kept his own voice level and even, hoping to get through his husband's thick skull.
He looked over at Alex then back to his friend. "I'll go over to the Burrow for a bit. I could use a shower too." He nodded at the boy. "He needs to be cleaned up too."
Harry was asleep, boneless and sated, next to Draco in bed. The moonlight fell through the sheer curtains, casting a dim glow over Harry's familiar face.
Whoa boy. The end of this story is really fighting me. This is the last chapter I've already completed. Chapter 8 is still in flight, but I don't miss deadlines, so I sincerely mean to have Chapter 8 published on time on Thursday evening. I'm more worried that Chapter 9 might be late, but if we're lucky, it'll start moving easier this week. I'm also going to be updating the title of the story with the next chapter, though it'll still have Alex's Story as part of it so that I don't confuse you. Thanks for reading! ðŸ’›ðŸ’›
He closed his eyes and nuzzled his face into my hand, and I could feel my chest swell. I loved him so much. How could this have been here for so long without me noticing?
He felt the floor crash into his knees, which was odd, but not nearly as odd as the feeling of the world closing in on him. He vaguely felt hands on his shoulders, holding him up.
Simon managed to fit me the next day, and that helped as well, even if he seemed to feel I needed to see him weekly for the foreseeable future. He helped me prioritise a few things, helped remind me of the coping skills I'd learned so long ago. And he encouraged me to continue with my plans, even when I felt useless and the dark felt all-encompassing when laying alone in my bed at night.
I could feel my pulse racing, and I wondered if Draco could see how terrified I was. Because I hadn't considered this. I hadn't even realised I felt this way until I thought he was no longer available. I'd been prepared to stand aside. There'd been no risk involved except my own, but this would be a step neither of us could come back from.
In the shower, with the water running over his body, the rage washed away and made room for the guilt.
"I won't," Draco promised, and he hoped to Merlin he could keep his word, dread curling around in his stomach.
"It appears so," Potter answered, looking put out and avoiding Draco's eyes. "I guess I'll just go down to the canteen and get some soup."
"Draco," Angelina murmured, closest to where he was standing. She pulled him into a hug, but he couldn't bring himself to lean into it. He was afraid it might make him fall over completely. She seemed to understand, though, and stepped back with a smile. "Ron is over there," she said quietly, pointing to a door with two Aurors stationed outside it.
She rolled her eyes. "Some things a big sister just knows, Dad." She paused and thought about Alex, his big brown eyes and sweet disposition. "I don't know if he's ready to know everything this summer, but you probably should tell him before his second year."
Harry felt his face warm and began a list in his head of all the curses he could use on his friends that wouldn't leave lasting damage, but that would shut them up.
, and Harry had been there, laying on the floor of some house in Scotland, and Draco. Hadn't. Known.
And then he'd gotten to work, his head ready to crack open, and all he'd wanted was a few minutes of peace, a cup of coffee, and a Pain-relieving Potion. He'd just sat down at his desk with his coffee and potion when his partner, Susan Bones, burst into their office, reminding him that he was required to be in a department meeting in three minutes and that he'd better hurry his arse in there before he got written up for tardiness for the third time this month.
Andi's eyes seemed to scan his face, but she didn't say anything. "I see. Teddy's doing well. He's unconscious."
But walking into the gallery, looking at Harry's photographs of the wild, magical jungles of South America and the calm, frigid waters of a Scottish loch, Draco felt something inside his chest unfurl.
"That was almost two-and-a-half years ago, actually, Lyra," Hermione corrected. "I'm surprised you remember it."
Second, I've bumped the rating of this story. It was intended to be a T rated story, but as I was writing this chapter, Harry and Draco had other intentions. It's not gratuitous, but it's definitely now an M rating. If that bothers you and you want to avoid that scene, it's at the very end of the chapter and when it starts, you can skip the rest without missing much plot resolution. For the rest of you, enjoy. ;)
Draco turned and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. "I haven't dared hope. I was so sure they'd find his family and take him away from us, so I couldn't hope."
anything." Draco was pacing now, and his shoulders were tense like he was ready to defend himself if Harry attacked. "I'm just
"You look like Daddy," Lyra pointed out. "Your hair is the same colour, and it's just as messy," she added with a giggle.
Gathii was a beautiful man. He was tall, the dark skin of his African childhood positively glowing, and the light accent in his voice added a level of polish that I couldn't possibly hope to emulate.
Alex followed his sister down the dark hallway of the manor. He didn't like it very much up here, the portraits murmuring as he walked past. "We're gonna get in trouble, Lyra."
Harry's stomach sank and his knees felt weak. This was it. Panic flooded his body at the thought of Draco not loving him anymore. "You know me," he said, the words breathy as he gasped to find the air that had left him. "You
It was a Saturday morning when Harry's mobile rang from an unknown number. He and Draco were in bed, enjoying a lie-in. They didn't often have the opportunity to do this with both of their work schedules being as they were, so when they did, they chose to spend the time wrapped around one another, limbs intertwined, talking about nothing overly important. The sounds of the city and the docks outside their window were barely noticeable, and it was just them, tangled together in the mid-morning light.
"What the hell is this place?" Harry yelled over the din, trying to get Draco's attention. But everyone was trying to get Draco's attention, it seemed. Because Draco looked completely fit in his perfectly tailored grey trousers and soft, black jumper, and the eyeliner he'd taken to wearing almost constantly was thicker, drawing Harry's eyes to Draco's.
And Draco could see itâ€”Harry, his magic eating away at his body, worrying about the small child he'd saved, telling him stories to keep him calm, giving him something to look forward to.
She patted his hand, then stood and shook out the skirt of her robes. "Now, I have some lunch to make those children, and you have a husband to pick up from the hospital."
The group all looked his way, shock on everyone's face. Harry knew he was stunned, as Ron was usually as clueless about these things as he was.
His ragged breathing was the only sound inside the carriage when finished, the others staring at him strangely. He felt his face heat and was grateful for the deep shadows of the late afternoon.
Harry stared, wondering how that arse would feel in his hands when the man straightened, and Harry backed away, turning to look at a nearby flower.
The sun was setting when I Apparated home, my growling stomach reminding me of my missed midday meal. I stepped through my back garden gate, thinking through what I had in my pantry for supper when a voice stopped me.
"Good answer!" Daddy says before he sweeps Alex up into his arms, and the feel of Daddy's strong arms around him, spinning around, makes him laugh. Daddy gives him a hug that feels a lot like Grandma Molly's; it makes him feel special.
"Mmmâ€¦" Draco let his head fall to the side. "Our friends are going to know what we're doing in here."
"Don't bring Rose into this, Harry," Hermione scolded when they met for lunch in Hermione's office in the DMLE. As Head of Department, it was spacious and comfortable, much more so than the cafeteria where they used to eat. "It isn't fair to either of them."
Draco put his hand on Teddy's shoulder. "They are definitely heroes. But you both did what you could, and you saved Alex."
I let my head fall to the side, looking at my friend. His pale blond hair was shining in the warm sun, and he was watching me with his clear, all-seeing, grey eyes. Something tight inside my chest loosened at the sight of him.
"Really," Grandmother answered before turning to his sister. "Now, I will overlook this running off this time since it was for such an important event, but Miss Lyra, next time I'll have our tea and cakes without you."
He walked along the other arrangements, glancing at Harry. "Do you need to worry about picking something that won't make anyone else jealous? A boyfriend or girlfriend?"
"I didn't know," Draco said again, his voice little more than a whisper in Harry's ear, "how much you'd overcome to be the person you are." He pulled back and stared into Harry's eyes, grey meeting green. "I didn't know that your little faults, those little things that drive me nuts, are actual fucking badges of what you've beat. And I'm so sorry that I've not tried harder to avoid upsetting you about that shit. So much more makes sense now, and I just, I didn't know."
The best part of Harry's new room, in his opinion, was the fluffy, dark blue rug he'd bought to cover the floor. It kept his feet warm from the chill of the castle stones, and a slight cushioning charm made it the perfect place to relax with his friends.
"Champagne!" Draco called out, truly happy for his cousin and the woman he'd grudgingly admit to being his friend.
He pointed at her with the wooden spoon he was using to stir the sauce of his shepherd's pie and scowled. "Don't start. It's barbaric. And who leaves their child at home alone while they go on holiday to another continent? There wasn't even a house-elf there to watch him. Honestly. Horrible family."
The sounds around me finally penetrated my awareness, and I turned to look around. Seagulls squawked loudly, swooping over our heads along the sandy dune where we stood, Ron just behind Hermione, watching us carefully, watching
Unfortunately, he never got that far. He was returning from a meeting, just about ready to suggest his plans to Harry, when he heard shouting coming from their shared office.
Harry couldn't meet his eyes. Instead, he looked back at the road and moved the little car they'd rented back into traffic.
"Which part?" Teddy said carefully, and dammit, that pissed her off. She was thirteen, not a baby, and people didn't have to be careful around her. Dad was killing freaking basilisks before
"If there's one thing with which I've been impressed while watching you and your husband over the years, it's been your willingness to take on everything together. It confused me at first, but Andromeda had some very pointed opinions on it and bid me watch and see. And she was right. You're stronger together than you are separate. That's something that your father and I, as much as I loved him, never really understood."
Draco sat down in the chair, situating them both comfortably, then looked at Harry. "Angelina said the night he stayed at the house and I was here, he barely slept the entire night, and when he did, he woke screaming."
Harry nodded and let Draco draw him into their shower, grateful for Draco's insistence on a flat with a large bathroom and this ridiculous double shower. Draco turned on the water, the steam almost immediately beginning to swirl around them, and stood before Harry, his grey eyes darting over Harry's face.
The thought forced another sob to escape, this one louder than he expected, and Alex began to stir. He sat up groggily, his small face trying to take in the room around him despite the dim lighting.
"How can you be happy when you don't even know what you want to wear or eat?" Draco asked, and the truth of it hit Harry in the stomach.
When Draco spoke, he chose his words carefully. "I think that you're probably right; Teddy would be very good at being a healer." Teddy seemed to relax, and Draco patted his hand. "We can talk about it more later, but if you went as far as telling Lyra, I'm guessing you're feeling relatively sure about this."
"Stop it. Please." Draco took a sip of his wine to give himself a moment, but then he pushed forwards. "It wasn't your fault. You were completely right that day. It was me. I was being ridiculous."
" The petulance in her voice took all of Draco's patience. Fuck, yes, he wanted her to be excused, but he didn't want to let her off that easily.
Teddy nodded, then hesitated before seeming to come to some kind of conclusion. "Harry once told me about how my dad wasn't sure he could be a father, how he thought about leaving my mum and me before I was born. It was the war, and Voldemort was in power, and, of course, he was a werewolf. Mum getting pregnant wasn't planned, and Dad got scared and ran, trying to go with Harry on his mission."
"Yeah," he agreed, "and not true. Because I really didn't feel like I was missing anything. I had Harry."
"He looks calm enough for this to work, thank goodness." It was Helen again. "It's so hard when they have nobody to comfort them, and they fight it."
His mouth tightened, but he kept his gaze locked on hers. "I did. I told you what you asked about, and I told you what I thought was age-appropriate."
A hand running through his hair brought Harry back to the present. He looked up into Draco's pale grey eyes, so like the morning mist outside the window, and tears burned behind his own.
He growled out the last words, and Harry nodded. It wasn't a surprise, really. Lucius probably wouldn't ever change.
The silence that followed made Harry sit up and watch the other boy. Draco was staring, his eyes narrowed and his brow furrowed.
Draco wanted to tell him to stop, that he didn't want to hear anymore, but he knew he was on the precipice of finally discovering the bigger picture of Harry. So instead of answering, he only nodded and hoped it'd encourage the other man to keep talking.
We never seemed to run out of things to talk about. His work, my stories, mutual friends, politics, booksâ€¦Ten years later and he was still interesting. When he wasn't pissing me off, anyway.
Hermione had opened her mouth to answer, but that caused her to stop and raise an eyebrow. "Really?"
Her quiet reassurance calmed Draco slightly, so he stood, went to the closet and pulled on Harry's favourite jumper for comfort, and then followed his husband's best friend to the Floo.
Lying back down and looking back up at the glowing stars, Draco sighed and his voice sounded amused. "I suppose I could have picked a more opportune time to make my stand than while sitting around the tree on Christmas morning. But they were so insistent on our plans to meet with the Greengrasses later in the day, and then Mother gifted me a book on pure-blood courting rituals, and I just lost my patience. I stood up, told them in no uncertain terms that I would not be marrying
And Harry made his decision â€” because Draco was right too. Harry needed to kiss a bloke tonight, and he needed to be happy. And Harry was pretty sure he knew just how to make it happen.
Ron slapped me on the shoulder. "No you're not, but you will be. Come on, there's a bonfire down the beach."
Draco's eyes met Ron's; Draco filed away the sorrow and pity he saw in the blue eyes to be considered later. For now, he needed to not think about any of it. He needed to concentrate on facts.
"Harry!" Dudley's voice came from the end of the hallway, but Harry ignored him and escaped into the empty kitchen. Breathe. He had to breathe. He dropped his hands to his knees and leant against the countertop, closing his eyes. Breathe.
Relieved at the distraction, Harry pushed it all to the side and tried to enjoy his friends for a little while.
What was he going to do? How was he going to get this child to relax enough to give up the memory that could save Harry's life? That would save Draco's life by saving Harry's? That would bring home Lyra's daddy?
"Well, then, maybe we'll be able to expedite this a bit. An Auror of his standing, and my position in the Ministry backing you up, made me confident, but I still expected we'd be battling a bit. But if he's willing to call it a favourâ€¦"
And that was it exactly, Draco realised. That was what he was feeling. It was like they were having this discussion about a boy that Draco had already accepted into his family.
Draco wasn't mine to be jealous of. He was my friend, and yes, he was the person there for me when I needed it. He was the first person I wanted to tell when something good happened, the last person I talked to most evenings before bed, the person who knew how to make me smile when the world around me seemed to be too much.
"You won't be able to, not really," Dudley said, walking into the hallway, his voice so quiet Draco had to lean in to hear him. "It would have to make sense for you to actually understand what went on here." He stopped by the stairway in front of a door.
"You're going to sleep in here, then? Good choice," Draco said, trying to sound encouraging. "You know where Lyra and I are if you get scared."
Harry hummed thoughtfully, slipping his shirt over his head and tossing it into the basket in the corner. "She didn't want to come in and say hi?"
She crawled into his lap and wrapped herself around him, tucking her face into his neck. "I don't want anyone to hurt you," she said eventually, her sobs turning into little hiccoughs.
I jerked my head up, nearly giving myself whiplash. Draco was sitting in his chair waiting for me, and he looked terrible. His hair was standing on end in places like it did when he ran his hands through it with worry. His mouth was taut, and his eyes sad.
, which is simply perfect. And," she said, standing and gliding her finger along another tree branch, "you look a good deal like my uncle Alphard." She pointed to a darker-skinned man several branches higher than where Alex's family resided. "He was a very kind man, and he loved your Daddy's godfather, Sirius, most of all. So it's special to look like him, I think."
"They fought. Harry called him a coward and told him to pull himself together and take care of his wife and kid."
Draco took a seat and listened to his daughter fill his husband in on everything he'd missed. It was several minutes before he realised that he was unconsciously rocking Alex slowly back and forth, soothing both the boy and himself. The longer they sat there listening to the others talk, the more the child seemed to relax, even nodding or shaking his head in answer to Harry's occasional questions.
He turned, ready to walk out again, but the guests entering behind him stopped any chance of escape. Instead, he stepped into the living room and stood to the side, letting people in around him.
"Alex," he said, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. He ran his hand over the boy's back. "It's just for a little bit."
Harry's voice was gentle, but Alex leaned back into Draco's arms, sucking harder on his thumb and breathing quickly. Draco ran a hand through the dark curls, trying to comfort him. Merlin, this was hard.
"Secrets, huh?" Draco asked, intrigued. "Hmm, we don't generally keep secrets in our house, do we? Surprises are ok, though. Is it something like that?"
"If you've read my books, you might remember the story that I wrote shortly after this time. Amil, our boy pirate, sails into a port where all the people are trapped on a tiny island. They see visitors come and go, but they stay where they are because this is where they've always been. The food they grow isn't sufficient, and the houses they've built aren't enough to keep everyone safe, but they stay because they don't know of any other options.
"Alex?" Lyra's voice came from the hallway outside Draco's door. It opened a crack, her green eyes peering in and growing wide when she saw the bed. "Papa," she whispered loudly, "you're awake!"
Draco narrowed his eyes, but he walked over to the kitchen table and leaned against it. "It was incredibly rude; you are correct."
"Yeah, okay. Tell Molly I'm taking Lyra up to her room to talk. At least that will lessen the noise level."
Draco shook his head and held on tighter, the almost silent sobs wracking his body now. "I'm sorry."
The flat was silent when they returned home, the light over the stove that Harry always kept lit casting shadows over the darkened room. Neither had said much since they'd left Surrey, but the words left unspoken hung between them like a fog.
Harry's dark hair, usually so untamed, lay lank around his face, accentuating the grey hairs that peppered around the temples. The beard Draco loved so much had been shaved by the Healers so they'd have a better indication if and when the Stasis Charms began to fail, as Harry's beard would begin to grow again. It was a better indicator than even their monitoring charms, but Draco hated it. Harry loved that Draco loved his beard. And though Draco knew it would grow back in just a matter of a few days, it still didn't feel right.
His stomach growled louder this time, and he slowly lifted the child and slipped away, letting the boy fall into the warmth of the cot where Draco had been. His thumb was in his mouth, and Draco's heart swelled a little at the sight.
"Good." Ron handed me another beer, and I played with the label, the feel of the wet paper under my hands suddenly fascinating.
The nerves in Harry's stomach began to bounce, and Harry sat in the armchair by the fire. He didn't know what to look at, so he just stared as Draco perched on the edge of the bed, curious as to what he wanted. Draco shifted and began to play with the button on his pocket watch.
"Yes, flowers for your partner. Well, roses are generally the accepted method of grovelling to one's girlfriend." Draco walked to the refrigerator full of multi-coloured roses. "You see I carry a range of colours, but redâ€”"
It was nearly two weeks later, while Harry, Lyra, and Alex were watching a Christmas movie and Draco was working on dinner, that the news came.
It was his, this room. It wasn't Dudley's handoffs, and it didn't belong to Ron or Bill. He didn't share it with four other boys or his best friends. It was his for the entire school year.
If Harry was honest with himself â€” which he tried to be these days â€” he more than admired Draco. He envied him. And that wasâ€¦weird.
"What are you going to do this afternoon?" Draco asked, his voice quiet because somehow he knew that's what I needed. "Do you want me to stay?"
"It was his bedroom until we were eleven," Dudley said. His words were quiet, but Draco heard each sharp syllable; they cut through his chest harder than that Sectumsempra curse ever could have.
Draco smiled, and his eyes lit up. Or maybe it was the light of the fire. Definitely just the light.
"None of them looked surprised," Ron contributed. "Honestly, I knew something was up between Theo and Pansy, but I didn't realise Susan was part of it."
"Definitely," she said, laying back on her pillows and squealing when he stole one out from under her, tucking it behind his back and scooting back to lean against the wall.
"Okay." Draco took a deep breath. Less than thirty minutes before, he'd been hyperventilating on the floor, and now he was here, pushing Teddy into the room. He ruffled the boy's hair, causing some reassuring growls. Merlin, he loved this kid.
Draco gave her a little smile, the biggest one he could manage at the moment. "He is. But honey, Alex's mummy and daddy couldn't be saved, so he's really sad right now."
Once upon a time, I'd seen a ballet on the telly in my aunt's living room. I think it was Christmas or something, and Vernon and Dudley must have been off somewhere, probably at their monthly, father-son, cinema night, watching things blow up. Whatever the case, Petunia had me sitting on the floor helping her wind her yarn while she watched the ballet, and I remember the fluidity with which the dancers moved. The woman twirled and jumped, confident in the knowledge the man would be there to catch her. He, in turn, positively leapt across the stage, the power of his movements adding gracefulness and beauty to the dancers nearby.
Harry thought back to the years of taunting, chasing, punching he'd endured at Dudley's hands and nodded. "He is. Or was, really. He seemed like he was changing a bit last year, like maybe we could have been friends eventually, but I haven't seen him since. No point, really."
Draco stood and began to walk the floor with the boy, shushing quietly and rubbing his small back. He found himself bouncing slightly like he had when Lyra was an infant. This child wasn't an infant, but the movement must have brought some comfort as he began to quiet, his sobs decreasing into soft whimpers.
The living room, such as it was, was not that large of a space. It was more of a sitting area that ran into the dining area that ran into the kitchen. Harry said the Muggles called it an open floor plan, but they'd both decided it was adequate, given the large veranda that overlooked the docks right off the Thames. Two large verandas, actually: one large enough to be its own sitting area, and another off the master bedroom that would be ideal for sitting with a morning cup of tea in nice weather.
"Have you talked to Simon lately?" Ron asked, and I realised I'd been staring at the ocean for several minutes, ignoring my friends.
Draco's arms came around his waist, and there was a light kiss on the back of his neck. "Let's take a shower."
"Oh," Harry said quietly, his pulse quickening at the thought of that. "But I thoughtâ€¦ Er, I mean, most of us already knew you liked blokes. You weren't exactly hiding it last term."
"Right." Draco had been there for the list of things to expect as Harry finished healing at home. Exhaustion, dizziness, loss of appetite, headaches. They would improve as the days passed, and Harry was home where he belonged, but Draco wouldn't fully relax until everything was back to normal. His stomach clenched at the thought, and he felt his chest tighten.
I said I'd post on Friday, but it's already Friday everywhere other than here in the Americas, and I have time tonight, so you're getting it a few hours early. Enjoy. ðŸ’›
Draco poured the shampoo into his hand and reached up, massaging Harry's head as he worked the soap into his hair. "I need this tonight." His voice was barely audible as he added, "I need
It made sense. Draco made so much sense, and Harry wanted to know; he wanted to try. He was terrified he'd never really enjoy intimacy with another person, and while he was sure that was fine for people who didn't want it, that wasn't him. He wanted to so much. He wanted sex and intimacy and all it entailed. And here was Draco, offering him an easy way to find out, no strings attached.
"No, it wasn't." He sat back down on the bed and watched her pace some more. "What else did they teach you about?"
Draco groaned and put down his phone. This is what he got for being friends with a Weasley. He'd thought he could handle Harry's friends, what with Weasley and Granger fucking off to Australia and staying there after the war. Harry still talked to them regularly, but they weren't a part of his everyday life. Ginny and Luna
"You were looking for signs of Harry in this house, weren't you? When you were searching the photos?"
"Arithmancy is hard, but you're smart and like to learn, so I think you'll do well. I didn't take Ancient Runes, but Vic did. She always seemed to like it." He let her sit in silence for a few minutes, and she could feel his eyes on her.
The darkness in my chest lightened just a little, and I felt able to take a deep breath for the first time in weeks.
Draco stood, ready to rush around and catch Teddy, if necessary. "Get back into that bed. You're too weak to be up and around yet."
Teddy rolled his chair over by Harry's bed and ran a finger over his godfather's wrist. Draco thought he saw them trace the lines of Harry's old Umbridge scar; Teddy had been obsessed with that as a child, his righteous anger being one of the early reasons he'd wanted to follow Harry into the Auror corps.
-And to my readers, I hope you love this story as much as I do. I have a lot of stories, but this is one of my favorites. ðŸ’›
I threw the meat into the skillet, determined to finish making dinner even if I didn't plan on eating it. I took out my frustration by mashing the meat mercilessly. Fuck.
And if I was a little bit jealous and more than a little heart-sick, well, he didn't need to know that.
The door closed behind him, and Harry moved to his bed and let the exhaustion overtake him, the smell of Draco's shampoo faint on his pillow.
Harry considered, but shook his head. "None of that really matters, though. Especially my role in it. I'm just me."
"Teddy," Draco murmured as Andi pushed him into a chair by the bed. He reached for Andi's hand and pulled her close. "How do we do this? How do we sit and wait and watch them hurt themselves?"
like. We're only going to give opinions if you can't pick between two things, but this is your choice. What do you like?"
Hermione looked him over, then adjusted his shirt and ran her hand through Draco's hair, pulling a few locks down around the sides. "Yeah. You'll do, I think."
"Draco, she doesn't remember having a sister. Literally, no memory of her. She said their parents passed away about eight years ago, leaving only her and her brother. Shortly after, they decided it was a good idea to leave Spain for some reason. She couldn't really explain it, they just decided to move to Canada."
Draco turned on his side and tucked his knees behind Harry's, putting his arm over his waist and holding him close. "She'll adjust. Let's give her a few days before we stage an intervention."
She sighed. "No, I imagine not. Come on. I came to tell you they said you could go in. I'll conjure you a sleeping chair in the corner. Will that work?"
Draco snorted but removed his arm. "As though you aren't straight as an arrow. Doesn't mean I can't admire the scenery, though, does it?"
Draco Malfoy stood before him. The Slytherin with the Amazing Arse. And he looked equally as stunned to see Harry.
Ginny patted Dean's knee then moved to the bench next to Harry, taking his hand. "You deserve to be happy too."
And Draco couldn't say anything to that. He wanted it more than anything, so he gave in and stretched on his side next to Harry on the bed. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm so sorry."
He chuckled. "Well, I mean, I'm out here in the sun, weeding. You couldn't expect I'd smell good, could you?"
But Draco'd had an obligation and Harry had been running behind. So now, after having been gone a week himself, it'd be another three days before he could see his boyfriend again. Leaving his bags by the door, he dragged himself to the couch and flopped down into the soft, purple cushions.
The three of them drifted off to the man controlling the music on the stage, and everyone looked around at one another. "Uh, did anyone else know about that?" Draco asked, sounding stunned.
"Oh, Alex, don't be a scaredy-cat," Lyra said with a huff, sounding just like Aunt Hermione as she pushed open the door.
potatoes â€” not dehydrated, thank you very fucking much â€” and began the work of peeling them. He might not cook often, or really ever, but that didn't mean he didn't know how. It had been a course they taught at Beauxbatons after the war, when he'd needed to get his N.E.W.T.s, but couldn't bring himself to return to Hogwarts.
Draco felt the urge to laugh bubble up in his stomach for the first time in what felt like aeons, even if it was only a couple of days.
She took his hand and squeezed. "He hadn't cried more than a few tears since we'd found them. He needed it."
"The power to do this was theirs all along, of course, but sometimes you need to be reminded you can hope for something more. You need someone to show you the bridge.
"No," Alex finally said, his voice ringing through the room louder than Draco had heard it yet, but it sounded panicked.
"It's justâ€¦I reckon I thought they'd be having a harder time, but here they are, back at Hogwarts, living their lives like they have some bloody second chance at things, like it's their right to just be happy!"
Thirty minutes later, Harry's bedroom had more people in it than seemed possible. Draco had pulled Pansy aside, asking for some of her clothing catalogues. Pansy, learning what was about to happen, pulled Parvati into the plans, insisting she bring along her hairstyle books. Harry was unsure how, but Neville and Susan also ended up involved and lounging about the room, leaving Harry surrounded and slightly panicked.
"There's more on there you'll like," Theo said with a laugh. "Keep it for a few days. And these, too. I expect you'll like some of them."
"After the trials, my parents just wanted to continue like none of it had happened. They were home on house arrest, of course, and while Mum can leave now, Father will be there for another two years, but still, you'd think it was business as usual from before this all started. The same routines, the same friends, and the same bloody expectations."
Hermione smiled. "Good morning, sleepyhead. You looked so cute when I came in, we didn't have the heart to wake you. And no, I'm not kidding. They're staunch, traditionalist pure-bloods, and they didn't take kindly to Alexander's marrying a Muggle." Hermione's voice became more clipped as she spoke. "Evidently, they believe the uncle was doing the family a favour, and they're threatening to sue the British Aurors for using extreme force on their son."
Harry's arms encircled his boyfriend automatically, but he wasn't sure what was happening. He thought Draco was trying to comfort him, but then he realised Draco's face was pressed into his shoulder and he was shaking, little sobs washing away in the falling water.
I thanked him and ran up the remaining stairs, eager to talk to Draco, to clear the air, before the game got underway. I got to the landing, pulled open the door, and froze.
"Stop what?" Draco asked, afraid to hear the answer. Stop fussing over him? Stop taking care of him? Stopâ€¦stop what?
"Yeah, that," his sister agreed cheerfully, before turning to Alex. Her green eyes were crinkled on the sides, like Daddy's always did when he was happy. "Found it."
Potter's face pinkened and he shrugged. "I like to cook, so making a little extra seemed reasonable."
Neville rolled his eyes. "They've only been together for two years now. It's time to get used to it."
The ringing stopped and Harry waited for a voicemail notification. Instead, about sixty seconds passed before it began again.
She pulled away and stood, beginning to pace. "They had nothing, Draco. These two kids, barely more than teenagers, ended up in another country illegally and had no way of making an honest living." She ran a hand through her hair and let out a harsh laugh. "But they were
She let the sobs out freely now, soaking Teddy's t-shirt and getting it all snotty before she pulled back. "Sorry," she muttered.
-Phe, I can't tell you how happy I am to have been paired with you. If you ever want to do this again, in or out of a fest, please don't hesitate to ask. I would definitely be eager to collaborate with you in the future.
"Dracoâ€”" Harry's voice broke before he could say anything else. He pushed his glasses up, pressed his palms to his eyes, and took a deep breath.
Draco picked up one of the throw pillows and began to worry the corner through his fingers. "I'm happier because I stopped giving a damn about what others expected me to do and started doing what
"We just talked about my toys and stuff," she said, giving a little shrug and looking an awful lot like Harry. "I let him play with them."
My only source of that laughter and love had just boarded his train and started the next stage of his life. It didn't matter that it meant I was starting the next stage of mine, and it was empty. Lonely.
"If he likes them. He might not like the same things you do, and that's okay. We'll just have to figure out what he likes while he's with us."
How the hell did he get to be here with this man? It was so much, but, well, he was Draco Lucius Malfoy, and he deserved the best, right? He snorted at his own ridiculous thoughts and laid his head down on the pillow, settling in to sleep.
And no, he shouldn't have bitten her head off for it, as it was kind of her to make sure he remembered the meeting, and yes, he could have just taken the pain potion and coffee with him, but he was too busy snarling and running down the hallway to the meeting room to think clearly.
Draco's mind began to spin with that piece of information, trying to make sense of what he was hearing. "Really?" he whispered.
â€” bars, back alleys, Pansy and Neville's bathroom â€” but they hadn't taken the time to hold one another, to really be together.
"No, I just came by to tell you I couldn't stay today. I, er, have a meeting with my editor." Which was ridiculous, because Draco knew Liza didn't work on weekends. But it was all I could manage at the moment. "Great to see you Gathii. I'll see you around, I'm sure."
Draco sat back, stunned at the anger. He shouldn't be surprised. He understood how anger was part of the process.
"Grandma Molly was talking to Auntie Angie. They didn't know I was listening, but I wasn't spying, Papa. I was just getting us juice boxes 'cause we were thirsty." She looked down at Alex and played with one of his curls. "So what's murder? And why does it make Alex poor?"
"I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable," Harry continued, quieter now that Draco was paying close attention. "I was just trying to figure it out, and Dean said I should just ask you, but it didn't seem like something I could just come out with, you know? '
him. My heart began to race at the realisation, and all I could do was pull that emotion apart, picking at it to see all the little pieces that made up the whole.
Draco just shook his head. "We had a fight this morning, so I thought he was just not home yet since he was still angry. You know how he is."
"Oh, come on, you know I'm right," he bit out, furious with himself. "You were angry with me because I was a right bastard, so you decided to go out into the field instead of going to the pub with Ron or coming home early for a romantic evening as we'd originally planned." His throat clenched again at the memory. "I picked up Indian from our place and had it ready, and I waited." Harry simply stared, his mouth open and his eyes wide, so Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and finished. "I waited, and you didn't come because you were in the field, dying. I was just sitting here. Waiting."
I let out a little huff while I chopped the onions for the shepherd's pie, then cast a quick charm to clear the smell as my eyes began to water. "You know I don't do tours."
I grabbed Ron and gave him an even louder kiss, this one on the lips, making him sputter and pull away.
He looked up, surprise in his eyesâ€”eyes, that as everyone pointed out, matched her own. "Lyra," he said quietly.
. Rosie told me all about it because she's already a big sister. But Alex is more fun than Hugo, and he'll be
She narrowed her green eyes and tilted her head. She looked so much like Harry at that moment that it made Draco's eyes burn with tears.
"Now," Morrison continued, "I want you to remember what happened when Harry came to save you. You don't have to think of the bad stuff, just remember what Harry looked like when he came in the first time." The Healer swirled his wand close to the boy's temple. "Good, Alex. You're doing really great. Think about what Harry's shirt looked like."
So why did Draco's stomach churn at the idea of seeing what was in there? Why did he want to turn and run away from it? He wanted to take Harry home, tuck him into bed, and promise him he never needed to return to this hateful place.
She took a deep breath, but when her voice came out, it was steady. "He'd been hit twice. The first appears to have been a Severing Charm; it nearly took off his right arm. The second was a Withering Curse. It seems to have hit him fully on his torso."
The thing about hope is that it can be a fickle emotion. If you don't truly feel it in your stomach, if you're only beginning to find it in your life or if you base it upon something transient, you risk shattering it completely.
Draco ignored the tears stinging his eyes and the rage flaming in his chest. "And he did the cleaning?"
"And," she added, this time the smile becoming more full, "I also wanted to tell you that Teddy's awake. He's asking for you. Andromeda already told him about Harry, but he wants you."
In the first days after Draco's and my discussion, when I'd decided to start living once again for myself, for the first time in my life I didn't think about my future as being something others could form for me. I spent those hours cleaning the house and trimming the hedges thinking about what I wanted in my future, considering who I wanted to be.
Harry stepped back like he'd been slapped, and his eyes narrowed. "Because your problems aren't mine."
liked. He'd tried things he'd never imagined trying before: woollen trousers that hugged his arse just so; chinos with multitudes of pockets that would hide his wand when he was in Muggle areas; shirts and t-shirts and jackets and jumpers; trainers and loafers and boots.
The boy's weight seemed to grow heavier and the sounds died out, but Draco kept moving. He ran a hand up over the boy's head, petting the soft curls. If he put him back to sleep here, even if he cast Monitoring Charms, he might not hear him quickly enough. He thought back to his nap earlier that day and sighed.
Harry laughed. "Yeah, I know." He hesitated. "You didn't have to do all this, you know. I'm glad you did, but you didn't have to. Thank you."
Alex turned his head to look at her, still wrapped around Draco's neck. The soft curls tickled Draco's cheek, reminding him of Lyra when she was upset.
That's where Draco was currently in the routine, and he was ready to tear his hair out. He'd not had a decent night's sleep in days, and he really didn't have the patience for this. Teddy's old room was freshened and waiting for Alex, but Lyra wouldn't let it go. He finally sent her to her room and sat down on Teddy's bed with the small boy.
Draco realised Harry was staring at him, green eyes sparkling with amusement. He raised his eyebrows, and Harry grinned.
It took her another two days to work herself up to it. She wasn't mad anymore, just confused and a little bit hurt, but she still tried to keep her distance, unsure what to say.
He heard her cast a spell and saw a white light zip from the room, then several minutes later, Pansy was there and pulling him up, and Hermione was gone. He was sitting in a chair by their bedroom window, his and Harry's bedroomâ€¦his and Harry'sâ€¦
Molly blushed and slapped him away. "Oh, go on now." She sobered a little and put her hand on his arm. "It's going to be okay, you know. It's hard to see the big picture when you're in the middle of it, but this too shall pass, and you'll all come out stronger for it."
Lyra came over to look. "Regulus Black. Daddy told me about him. He was a hero who helped Daddy stop the bad guy."
Barking out a harsh laugh, Harry let his head fall back again. "Because I'd hoped you'd be able to help me, but that's not going to help."
"Wow," he let out, trying to keep his voice quiet. The room was even bigger than he'd thought. They could fit every single person he knew â€” and he knew a lot of people, especially people with red hair â€” in this room.
Hermione laughed. "Rose has a crush on a Hufflepuff girl, but she's not ready to do anything about it."
"Anyway, Harry told him stories and took care of him, despite getting sicker, and promised he'd introduce him to his Draco and Lyra when they were safe."
I ignored him, too tired to rise to the bait. I just wanted to climb into bed, to go to sleep and pretend this day hadn't happened, that my godson, my
"Your dad thinks you're mad at him because of the way he treated Draco during the war, and because of some of the things that happened, some of the magic he had to do."
"It wasn't that much to lose, honestly," Draco said, and Harry looked over to see the other boy's face twist.
He was so tired, his mind numb from the stress and exhaustion of the previous days. He wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed, but his mind scrolled through the list of things he still had to do. Lock up the house first; let the Crup out so he had another chance to relieve himself; make sure both animals had fresh water; and he really should fit a shower into all that because he smelled like hospital. He sighed and pushed his tired body from the wall to finish his routine.
"Breathe out." She let out a long breath and Draco automatically matched it as well as he could. "And in," she said again, and he focused on the pale freckles on her nose. Strange, that. He'd never noticed she had freckles before. Maybe she caught them from her Weasley children.
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. "I'm going to regret asking this," he mumbled, then continued. "Potter, what kind of music do you like?"
It was almost an hour later as he stepped from the shower when he heard it. He froze, unsure what the sound was, but when there was nothing, he reached for his towel.
Taking a deep breath, Alex looked at the large, looming double doors. He wasn't sure if he could do this. He was only five, after all, and five-year-olds were too young to get into trouble for sneaking around manors.
"His memory is going to save my daddy, just like my daddy saved him," Lyra said, her voice sounding cold and imperious. "And I'm going to help by making him know that he's not alone, so you can start now, okay?"
"No, they're not back yet," she said quietly. "The Aurors won't tell me more, but from what I can tell, no one knows anything. Teddy's training ended at three and the other trainees all left. There was no reason for him to be anywhere dangerous."
He put the lid on the cream and turned off the light, joining his sulking husband in bed. "We knew things would change eventually. And they'll change again for Alex. It's natural."
Draco's lips twitched into a small smile from his place on Harry's bed. "You're welcome. Merlin, it's quiet in here now. We need some music."
Pansy hurried into his closet and brought him his favourite, softest trousers and another one of Harry's jumpers. He'd kiss her if he could bring himself to show any emotion, but it was all he could do to hold himself together at the moment. Instead, he let her cast a quick spell on his hair, cleaning it and settling it neatly, and then reached for his shoes.
"Oh, Teddy," Draco said, reaching out to ruffle Teddy's hair as the man tried to pull away. "He'll be happy that you're happy. I promise."
"I know, buddy," Draco soothed. "I bet they're so happy you're safe, even if they can't be here with you."
He ran a finger along Harry's cheekbone. It was tender and sad, and Harry had to look away before he saw the pity he was sure was hiding under the surface.
He should just tell him. Merlin knew it'd make it easier, but he was so damned afraid. Afraid of Draco's reaction. Afraid that Draco might think less of him, might realise that he really wasn't the brave Gryffindor everyone made him out to be, that he was weak.
Harry was talking to Susanne, but Dudley caught Draco's eye and nodded, seeming to agree with the old woman's suggestion.
"What?" she asked, pushing her blonde hair behind her ears, a stupid curl immediately falling back out into her face. She hated her curls. Stupid Dad with his stupid crazy hair she inherited.
Her big eyes were so hopeful that Harry couldn't bring himself to hurt her feelings. "Thank you, Tindles. That'd be lovely."
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, his exhaustion beginning to catch up with him again after the excitement, Alex's slow breathing soothing Draco's frazzled nerves.
Draco sipped his tea and then tried to take a small bite of his muffin. The tart cranberry burst on his tongue and it occurred to him it was the first thing he could remember tasting since this entire debacle began.
"Well, then we'd better finish unpacking," Harry said, getting up and picking up a box off the kitchen floor, "because I haven't found the wine stash yet, and the glasses are in one of these boxes."
"Right." I pulled my wand, demonstrating the overpowered Shield Charm the instructor had requested as I allowed Draco Malfoy to throw spells my way. I dropped it just as quickly and began to hurl hexes, confident in his shield.
"Yeah, really," Draco said, smothering a chuckle. "Are you okay with this? It means you'll have to learn how to be a big sister, and Daddy and I will pay attention to Alex and you both, not just you."
A few more hungry thrusts and Draco came on a shout, pouring himself over both of their hands. Harry jerked several more times and joined him, the heat of their combined release coating their joined fingers.
"Alex?" Lyra turned, obviously eager to get to the room where she could see Ron and Molly outside the door.
Harry closed his eyes and breathed in, trying to ignore the itch of annoyance that crept up his back between his shoulders. He hated when Draco left a mess, just assuming that Tindles would pop in to take care of it later. And no matter how many times Harry complained, Draco didn't seem to change.
Draco stopped, a flashback of the time so many years ago when he'd approached a similar scene with trepidation. This time, however, he was one of them. He was family.
Sometime later, he was unsure how long or how it happened, he found himself tucked into his bed. He was wearing pyjamas, and Pansy was curled up next to him, her eyes softer than he'd ever seen them before.
"Why are you sorry?" Harry was so confused. Why would Draco be sorry? He'd done nothing but be there for Harry all day. Harry was the one who should apologise for being such a mess during this entire thing.
"Alex," Helen said, "you'll really like it there. They have a bedroom ready for you, and another little boy for you to play with."
"I'll be out in a moment!" a man's voice called from the backroom. "Please, feel free to look around."
Draco leaned over as Susan began singing some song Harry didn't recognise about finding love in all the wrong places, and he laughed. "I'm going to sing something."
"Sure," Luna answered, and the look she gave Ginny was radiant â€” and extremely pleased with herself. "So?"
Draco snorted, but Harry sighed. "No, Zee, Lyra is only mad at me and taking it out on everyone else. It's my fault, buddy."
Syria. It had only been the previous yearâ€”nearly five years after that mission that had Harry gone for over seven monthsâ€”that Draco had finally learned where Harry had been during that time. Looking back, he was glad he hadn't known the danger in which his husband had truly been.
It didn't get better. If anything, it got worse. Every time Harry walked into the room with Lyra, she'd stiffen and glare, as if he'd sucked out her happiness by just being nearby.
"I love you, you know," Draco muttered against his mouth before he pulled away. "Thank you for understanding."
"Of course you do, darling. And you'll make a lovely Auror." Hermione patted her boyfriend on the hand sweetly.
He placed the potatoes and onions into a baking dish, followed by a few hastily cut carrots, some red wine and a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and finally finished off with some salt and pepper. He took some beef out of the refrigerator and placed it on top, added more wine, then covered it all and placed it in the oven.
Draco thought about it. "At the Burrow before second year, right? No, I don't think you have. Harry has, though."
Draco let out a little huff of suppressed temper. "And I respect that, but I don't expect you to clean up after me when I forget or feel lazy."
But Draco's problems were typical of anybody who'd gone through a war. Harry's weren't. He had issues with food, for example, his stomach messed up from years of having so little to eat. And he hated the dark. Really,
,' Dean had said. But it was so bloody hard, and what if Draco laughed at him or taunted him with it? Except, Draco had just laid himself out with Harry, had just asked his own confusing questions, and Harry could have used those against
Harry let out a harsh laugh. "No. I came home and basically got locked in my room. But I remember Ron complaining about it."
Susan rolled her eyes from her spot on Harry's bed. "You're just going to put your wand to the image and your clothes will take on a temporary Transfiguration to the item in the catalogue. It'll also mark down the size to fit you properly. That way, if you order, it'll all be taken care of."
I forced a smile, trying to feel bright and happy, then turned to find Hermione sweeping me into a huge hug.
Draco swallowed, but if Harry wasn't there, that means he was somewhere else. And that was good. He wasn't lying dead in some house in northern England.
Harry suppressed a snort. A vicar and church, as if his aunt and uncle had cared about anything like God or church during their lives. They put on appearances, but church clearly required too much introspection. Vernon wouldn't put up with that.
How was he supposed to know it would happen? It wasn't like he knew the bloody house-elf, or that he could expect that his Auror partner, of all people, would take the information to heart. No, it was just an innocent comment while working on a case in Potter's home study and a request for Antacid Potion, with which the house-elf quickly returned.
Dudley's news was like an awakening of every memory Harry had ever buried. Every harsh word, angry voice, painful slap, aching stomach, lonely nightâ€¦ They all came back to him like a flipbook, flashing through his mind. And there, in his madness, he had to find the humanity within himself to grieve.
And Draco remembered that too. When he'd heard about his father, he'd needed some space to cry and come to terms with it all, some time where he didn't feel like people were watching over him.
"Merlin, Hermione, I don't know. He cried for ages until we both passed out." He ran his hand through his hair, and for the first time in his memory, he really didn't care that it was probably a mess.
"â€”wouldn't be in the field alone," Hermione interrupted, her face blank. She stood up. "Ron, go with Draco to the hospital. I'm going to the Ministry to see what I can find out. Maybe Harry's there, in which case I'll bring him with me. If he's notâ€”"
It wasn't until nearly nine o'clock that Draco began to get concerned. Harry had said he might be late coming home, and it was a Thursday, which meant that he sometimes met Ron after work at the Leaky for a pint or put in an extra few hours on paperwork to get it completed before the weekend. It wasn't out of the ordinary.
Harry smiled. "Thanks. I have to get back to work in a few, and still have to walk to the Apparition point, though. Can you maybe send it over?"
Without looking at Draco, he pushed the remaining items back into the cupboard and spun, leaving the room and his untouched wineglass behind him.
"That was my primary school," Harry pointed out, stopping in front of the long, boring, brick building surrounded by automobiles. "I finished there when I was ten."
The Hogsmeade train platform was bustling with students, and Harry's eyes scanned the milling crowd. He saw most of the eighth year students moving together nearby, everyone waiting behind the younger students. They were all intermingled now, a full term of sharing a common room thawing most of the iciness of their pasts. Susan Bones, Terry Boot, and Theo Nott were chatting with Dean and Seamus, Pansy Parkinson moving from their group to talk with Hermione as they waited to board the carriages for the ride back to the school.
Draco's voice was quiet and cold, but he didn't remove his hand from Harry's. "So they were going to send Dudley somewhere private, but you were going to go to the local state school."
He felt Ron sit down on his other side. "This is Harry. He's always okay. He'll get out of this and get a message to us somehow."
"Karaoke stage, what else?" Pansy answered. "Look!" She pointed at the stage where a large screen had lyrics rolling across it and a man and woman sang to each other, each with a pint in their hands and a microphone in the other. The crowd cheered them on, and it was only then Harry noticed the music wasn't quite the quality he'd been expecting.
"Nothing," Draco interrupted. He took a deep breath and seemed to shake off his irritation. "I'm starving. Are we having dinner or not?"
Harry laughed, relaxing a little. "I like natural colours, I think. Uh, greens and blues and stuff. And, of course, red and gold," he couldn't resist adding. "Well, maybe not the gold, but that wine colour, you know?"
Draco put his hand around Harry's waist, steadying him, and relief flooded through Harry's body. He could do this. He wasn't alone.
Draco was right. I needed to start living again. Except, this time I couldn't just do it for Teddy. I had to do it for myself.
She let out a little hum. "Yeah, I think so. She's five, Draco. She's already wondering what time you're coming to pick her up."
Harry placed a kiss on Draco's head and then swiped his finger over the screen of his phone, answering the call on speakerphone. "Hello?" he greeted.
"You didn't have to do that," Draco said quietly, watching from several feet away like he was keeping his distance from a rabid animal.
Draco's head fell to the side and he looked at Harry, his brow furrowed. "Do you miss them? Your family?"
"Draco," Harry said, and he shoved his hips forward, letting Draco feel his arousal. It'd been nearly a month since they'd been intimateâ€”too long, by anyone's standardsâ€”and Draco let out a little whimper, mimicking Harry's movements.
He took a sip of his wine, then turned so he was facing Harry, meeting the green eyes he knew so well.
But he was also Harry Potter, and she never really, truly understood what that meant until this last month.
When Draco woke, it was to find himself lying on a cot in Harry's hospital room, a small head of curls nestled into his shoulder and Hermione watching with a sad smile from a chair across the room. The smell of breakfast made his stomach growl loud enough for her to hear, and she chuckled.
"Seriously?" Harry looked at the little magazine in awe, then her words sunk in. "Wait, what do you mean, 'try it on?'"
"Please." Harry's voice was almost a whine, and he opened his eyes just a slit. "I'm too tired to talk about it right now, but I thought I'd never see you again." He paused, as if bracing himself to say something terrible. "I used the Knut."
Harry shrugged. "I guess. I mean, I've only ever really worn school robes or formal robes. I'm comfortable in Muggle stuff."
He skimmed over Susan, Theo, Hannah, and Pansy huddled together over a parchment, arguing about something Harry couldn't hear. Hermione occasionally looked over and gave some input before turning back to her work with Dean and Padma as Padma demonstrated a spell. The huddles were repeated down the table, but Harry's eyes were drawn to the head of pale-blond hair, bobbing as its owner animatedly described something to Blaise, Ron, Seamus, Ernie, and Tracey Davis.
"Ah." Draco pulled another chair up and looked into the boy's watery eyes which were beginning to droop. "It took me a long time to learn that too, little bug." He held out his arms for the boy. "Would you like me to hold you for a bit?"
"I feel horrible. I made this into this huge fight it didn't need to be, and then I decided to go out on that bloody call, and all I could think was the last thing I said to you was that I never had a family." Harry's voice was thick, his eyes glassy. "And I really didn't mean that. You're my family."
He was there for me when I needed a night out, when I needed to remind myself that I was only twenty-three, that life continued to go on outside of bedtime stories and ABCs. He was there to encourage me as I searched for a new career, something I could do for myself while staying home and raising an amazing child.
We're in the second half of the story now. I originally predicted it'd be 8 chapters, but I'm working on chapter 8 right now and am not at the end just yet. I'm thinking it'll probably be about 10 chapters when complete. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and I'll be back with an update on Sunday evening.
She nodded her head solemnly. "Of course, Papa." She looked at Harry and started bouncing. "Does he know yet? Can I go talk to him?"
"Draco," Harry cut him off, his voice sharp, "I'm sure Michelle is brilliant, but I'm hungry and I'd rather not talk about it. Can we just eat?"
He stood and approached the stage as Draco's song grew to a close. Harry climbed up on the stage as Draco sang, "Fuck you," and the music ended.
"About thirty minutes on each side of the memory of Harry's entrance. That should cover everything adequately, we think, without causing Alex to relive the event."
"God, Draco, I'm not going to last long tonight," Harry said, gasping. "But I want you to come with me. Please."
"He'd only use it as a last resort," Draco managed, a numbness taking over his body. "He'd not use it otherwise, because he knows what it'd do to me."
Harry's eyes flew open, and Draco had moved the bowls of crisps out of the way, moving next to Harry. "Okay?" Harry said, unsure of where this was going.
Simon, the therapist I'd been visiting on and off in the years since the war. Mostly, I went to him when the residual trauma caught up with me, when the nightmares returned, or the flashbacks got to be too much. Honestly, I hadn't been to see him in almost three years. I'd been doing so well, so it hadn't even occurred to me to go back now.
"Harry," Draco interrupted, his voice quiet while Hermione and Theo gathered up the mess, "do you want to be able to tell everyone to fuck off or not?"
"She'll be ecstatic, but I think you're right," Harry agreed, coming up behind him and meeting his gaze in the mirror. "I can't believe we're going to do this."
I'd been running behind, so the stadium was full. The Montrose Magpies were a popular team, and on a day like today, with the sun shining and the chill of the day still somewhat manageable, the stands were close to capacity. I smiled and nodded at the ticket booth, waving as I passed, hurrying through the members' queue.
Harry huffed out a little laugh and entered, pausing a moment to look around. The essentials of the room were the same as Harry's and the others': a bed, window, fireplace, desk, and armchair. The rest, though, was bright and lush. Photographs of Draco's friends were framed around the room, and a beautiful landscape hung over the fireplace. The armchair had been charmed to have pinstripes running through it, and throw pillows adorned it, the bed, and a large cushion in the other corner that looked ripe for relaxing.
"It'll be up to Harry," he said finally, and Dudley's shoulders relaxed but his eyes were still sad.
; don't you see that? Fuck, I justâ€” I thought I knew you. I knew there were things I was missing, some missing pieces of the big picture, but I didn't realise it could be something like this, something so big."
"You're going to take his bloody side, aren't you? You're going to tell me that he was just looking out for me, that I was too young to hear it, but this is my life, my family's story, and they didn't tell me. My dad died!"
That caught my attention, and I nearly strained my neck turning so quickly. Ron was grinning, his ears red in the dim firelight, and Hermione, sitting between his knees, had a sly smile on her face.
"I think peasants probably have more fun," she grumbled. He raised an eyebrow at her, and she giggled. "Fine. No, I'm awake, Papa. And I'm hungry. Can I have some breakfast? Can I wake Alex up and we make him pancakes like Gen and Ethan like to make? I bet he's never had those before."
I'm sorry! I know, I know, so much angsty hurt-comfort, but bear with me, we'll pull out of it soon enough. But we got to meet Alex!
"He's been cursed, and they haven't been able to identify it yet. It's turning his magic against him, which is slowly destroying his body. He was in a lot of pain when we found him, but he was conscious and protecting the child. The more magic he used, the more it rebounded on him."
It all started when Draco mentioned he didn't enjoy eating in the Ministry canteen for lunch. A passing comment about heartburn was all it took to create mayhem.
"Yeah, sure," Harry answered quietly, and Draco hated that he didn't know what Harry was thinking. He always knew what Harry was thinking. That was one of the benefits of having been married so long, knowing what the other person would do or say next, but the distance of the last couple of weeks made him question everything. He consciously kept his breathing slow and steady as he poured the wine in the kitchen and brought it back to the living room, handing a glass to Harry before sitting down. There was only a foot separating them, but it felt like a mile.
Parvati cast a spell turning Harry's walls into mirrors, and Draco let out a long whistle. "I'll need you to teach me that one. It will definitely come in handy someday."
Harry nodded, and Draco's newly freshened breath drifted over Harry's face, making his stomach tighten even more. He wanted to close his eyes, but he couldn't seem to shift them from Draco's gaze.
Alex nodded, then whispered, "My daddy." He paused and his eyes widened slightly and began darting around the room. "Uncle?"
Draco folded himself down on the large cushion in the corner, still staring at Harry like he was some creature in one of Hagrid's classes: interesting and a little dangerous.
She finally found him in the garden, weeding the flower beds along the side of the house. "I've always wondered why you do this by hand," she said sitting down on the grass beside him.
But he was back, Draco was in his arms, and I couldn't do a thing about it. And why did I feel like I needed to do something about it, anyway? I felt so confused, both by what was going on in front of me and by what I was feeling. Was thatâ€¦
"Only if you want us too," Draco added. "If you want us to find you another family, we would do that. We just want you to be happy."
He looked down at his daughter, who had been so strong through this entire debacle. "Come here," he said, holding out his arms and scooping her up as she reached him. She giggled when he held her tight. "I'll make some of the sugared bananas and put them on top. How does that sound?"
That is until Hermione entered quietly behind Draco and it all fell apart. "We're ready," she murmured, and Draco nodded, the sick feeling he'd been ignoring since their conversation at the house suddenly making itself known.
Harry shook his head. "Can I be alone for a while? Please?" His voice sounded so small, like a young child unsure of himself, not like the confident man Draco had come to know so well.
"He's okay now. He's going to be okay. We're going to go in there and reassure ourselves, and then you're going to go back and rest. When he wakes up later, he's going to be asking about you. The last he knew, you were hurt badly."
"Hey, Harry," said Jimmy, the tiny wizard that worked the gate going up to the top boxes. "Where's Teddy?"
"I justâ€”" Dudley sounded as though he were having trouble getting whatever it was out. "Harry, Mum and Dad are dead," he said, his words so quick that Harry wasn't sure he'd heard them correctly.
"She's fine. Molly hasn't told any of the children what's going on, just that they're having an extended sleepover. Lyra is happy and well and playing with Rose and Hugo."
Harry rolled his eyes at the jab and grabbed for the disc in Draco's hands, putting it back on his pile. "You're ridiculous. I know what you're going to say, but you're wrong. It's not angsty."
"Well," Draco started, his stomach turning with nerves as he considered how to approach this. He and Harry had always tried to answer Lyra's questions in an age-appropriate way, and they never brushed her off. "Do you know how Daddy used to catch bad guys before he decided to teach people how to catch bad guys?"
But now he was curled into Draco like a Crup seeking warmth. His thumb was hanging from his mouth as he slept.
He'd finally given in, shrank his own Cannons shirt, pulled it over Teddy's head, then rushed him out the door. Drop-off at the school resulted in more tears, because, of course, Harry had forgotten to pack Teddy's lunch and the poor child would have to eat the school provided lunch today â€” a lunch Harry knew the boy would enjoy, but evidently wasn't good enough this time.
He was mimicking Draco. And why wouldn't he? Draco was the one who taught him how to use the Black family imperiousness to get what he wanted. It was only fitting that this child, this
He sighed, gathered his books, and forced himself to leave his room as he'd promised Hermione he'd do. She'd arranged a study group for their first night back to go over everyone's holiday homework, and she was counting on him to be there to help anyone who needed revision for Defence. Not to mention, he was stuck on his own Potions essay and sincerely hoped Draco or Hermione would be willing to help there.
Draco nodded and pulled himself up from the bed, looking around the room one more time. "And Potter?"
"They'll get nowhere, and we're looking at filing criminal charges against them for conspiracy to commit murder, as it appears they were aware of his plans. We're going to follow this through, but the point is, even if they wanted the child, we wouldn't let them have him."
Harry's voice was quiet, but his eyes were serious. "Draco, they're trained for this. I'm sure Hermione wouldn't let him go to just anyone."
Her mouth grew firm. "There are signs of a struggle at the residence and three dead bodies. Two were Spanish citizens living here for work: a wizard named Alexander Torres and his Muggle wife, Sophia. They were both killed with magic; it's too soon to say what spells were used. The third was a British citizen, Alexander's cousin. He was found separately from the others and was buried under a wall that caved in. Aurors on the scene believe the force of the wall-collapse killed him." She paused and took a deep breath. "And there's a child who appears to be unaccounted for, and Harry wasn't there."

He'd miss Harry's smile and the way he'd laugh when Draco would make a snide comment or a sarcastic observation about a coworker at the Ministry. He'd miss the way Harry would run his fingers through the hair around Draco's collar, twirling it around his fingers in fascination. He'd miss Harry's odd little idiosyncrasies, like when he'd forget to eat, but when food was finally placed in front of him, would eat like he was ravenous, finishing every last morsel. Or when Harry would get out of bed, insisting he couldn't miss his daily jog or workout, even when they'd been up all night doing their own cardio sessions.
Lyra's nightmares, however, seemed the most surprising. She woke several times that first week, crying, afraid that Harry and Draco had died, or been murdered, or had left her in some way. She didn't seem to remember these dreams in the light of day, but Draco noticed her seeking extra reassurance, crawling into one of their laps and snuggling more than usual. She followed them from room to room, cheerfully babbling about whatever was on her mind, always seeking their attention.
"I never understood children sucking their thumbs," he said quietly when Hermione handed him his tea. He lifted the cup and sniffed. Earl Grey. Perfect.
"I know, and I'm not saying anything against them, I'm only saying that he knows us. Why can't he stay with us until they find the Muggles."
Draco's throat clenched at the idea of leaving Harry even that long, but Lyra needed him. "Teddy?" he asked.
"Whatever, baby bro!" she laughed, grabbing at him. She heard Dad and Pa following behind her as they went through the barrier, escaping the watchful eyes of the wizarding public. Thank Merlin.
Hermione's hand on Draco's shoulder startled him slightly. "Do you want me to stay with him so you can go with Lyra?"
Helen sighed and stood, stepping back as Draco got to his feet. "This is why we generally take them to the foster home right away," she said, her eyes sad when she looked from Alex to Draco. "I'm sorry. It's hard for them to make yet another change amidst all the other turmoil going on in their lives. With the situation what it was and Alex being under the DMLE's care, I let it go on longer than I should have. I should just take him. The longer we draw this out, the worse it'll be."
Something seemed to flash in Draco's eyes for just a moment, but it was gone so quickly I thought I'd imagined it. "Your friends all love you, Potter. You're an idiot."
Well, no one ever said Draco didn't know when to take a hint â€” ok, Pansy did, but nobody else â€” so he tugged Harry's arm. "Let's sit down. I think you've had enough."
He felt his eyes sting at the truth of her words. It was. It was so heavy, the weight of expectations of the wizarding world. Every day, it was another prediction or question about what his life would be. When would he become Head Auror, even though he hadn't even joined the Auror Corps yet? When would he marry, settle down with Ginny, and have two point five children? When would he take a seat on the Wizengamot and start shaping the future of wizarding Britain?
"Master Harry," Tindles said in her high-pitched voice, "Master Draco asked me to help you unpack when you were home." She smiled and snapped her fingers, Harry's bags disappearing from where he'd dropped them by the door. "Can Tindles draw you a bath in the big tub?"
Draco grinned. "Just stay there. Let me." He scooted over the final distance that separated them and leaned over where Harry lay back on the fluffy rug, curling his fingers into the carpet to keep from reaching for the pale face looming over his. The blue-black light made Draco's hair glow like the stars, and Harry felt a hitch in his breath.
But Harry was opening the door and getting out, so Draco could only follow. He watched as Harry hurried over to the house, his shoulders stiff, his movements automatic as though each step were an effort. Dudley and Susanne unlocked the door and went inside, but Harry stood on the front step, staring.
"Alex," Draco said quietly, continuing to move. "I've got you. You're safe. We're here for you, little bug. Draco and Lyra and Harry. Shhhâ€¦"
"Leave him alone, love. He's just thinking deep thoughts; aren't ya, Harry?" Dean grinned and wrapped his arm around Ginny when she sat next to him.
"They've had a marriage contract set up for me since I was a toddler, did you know that? Oh, it wasn't binding or anything, but it was an expected outcome that I'd grow up, marry the virginal, pure-blood wife, and take over the Malfoy estates as a good heir should. My whole life was mapped out for me." He stopped and raised an eyebrow at Harry. "I know you're not pure-blood, but I imagine you know what that feels like."
Like many little boys, Teddy went through phases of intense interest when he was young â€” trains, dragons, frogs, weatherâ€¦The stories of Amil first took form when Teddy was temporarily obsessed with everything related to boats. From rowboats to cruise ships, Teddy had questions about them all, and anyone hoping to have a discussion with him at any length needed to be ready to discuss water-faring vessels and answer questions.
Draco woke to a bright light in his bedroom. He opened his eyes to a vibrant, transparent Jack Russell terrier floating above his bed, speaking with Weasley's voice.
Harry closed his eyes. "No, I don't have a problem with them being happy. I justâ€¦don't understand how they're doing it."
Draco couldn't speak, he just shook, letting the tears and snot run into the blanket under his face. His nose was clogged, too, and he felt disgusting, but he couldn't stop.
Draco picked up the phone and took it off speaker, watching Harry's blank eyes staring at something only he could see. "This is Draco, Harry's boyfriend. I think he needs some time to absorb this. I'm really sorry to hear about your parents. Is there anything we can do?"
I steeled myself and ploughed ahead. "I'm sorry for running out like that earlier today. I realised later that it must have seemed incredibly rude to Gathii, and with you guys getting back together like that, it had to have made things awkward. I'm really,
"You may, but you are to go to your room and think about your behaviour. I'll be up later and we're going to talk."
"If you're suffering, please know you're not alone. Open your eyes and try to grasp onto any hands there to help you. And if someone around you is lost in the dark, please be patient and keep trying. You never know when they'll be ready to look for the bridge.
"Tries to outdo me at everything. He used to leave the house a mess until I started to clean, then it was all, 'I'm entrusted to clean the Noble House of Black.' It's like it's a freaking competition."
"That day in my kitchen, though, when Draco pulled back the curtains and told me to open my eyes, that day was the day
"And how the hell am I supposed to know what it is I want?" Harry asked, his voice loud and incredulous. Draco made it all sound so fucking simple, but it
He thinks about it. A movie with popcorn sounds fun, but maybe later when it's dark. He likes watching movies in the dark. "Can we play Snakes and Ladders?" Lyra never wants to play that. She says it's for little kids, but if it's his dayâ€¦ his Adoption Dayâ€¦ well, she has to do it anyway, right?
"Thank you, Uncle Harry. I'm sorry I couldn't help you, but I'm glad the kid could." Teddy's voice was barely audible. He stared at Harry's vitals for a bit, then turned back to Draco. "They were the real heroes, you know."
"Harry," Draco gasped, thrusting against his husband's length, relishing his heat and the strength of his hand. He added his own hand to join Harry's, linking their fingers and moving up and down against their shafts, kissing, gasping one another's names. He felt his peak approaching and dropped his head back. "I'm close."
"And you don't think learning more about your actual role in the war, about all of our roles in it â€” Draco's, mine, Ron's, hell, even Molly's â€” would be a lot for a kid to take in?"
Draco opened the door, letting the light spill across the child's feet. Alex tossed in turned in his bed, caught in the throes of a nightmare. "MamÃ¡," he cried softly. "MamÃ¡!"
He felt his eyes burn and blinked back the tears, taking another bite of his soup that tasted like dust in his mouth. They sat in silence, his mother's gentle presence a comfort he hadn't known he needed.
Draco felt his chest tighten, but he knew he'd feel better if they finally got this over with. "I'm ready if you are. But I think I might like a glass of wine first. Do you want one too?"
Draco sighed. "Listen. I've done everything I can to show you I've changed, and I thought we were becoming friends. Or at least not-enemies."
"This sucks," Harry muttered, getting into bed that evening. "Everyone's told me teenagers are hard, but what the fuck? She was fine in April."
"Lyra," he finally said and picked up his spoon. The food was probably deliciousâ€”Molly's soup generally wasâ€”but he could hardly taste it.
"Well, what is it?" He turned the fire down on the hob, gave another stir, and then went to the table to sit, his knees weak.
There was a bit of nervous laughter before everyone burst out into loud guffaws. "Merlin, no," Tracey laughed. "Do you think it's been going on for a while?"
She ran off to the kitchen area and began moving around, expertly assembling Harry's dinner and humming to herself.
Draco rolled his eyes and let out a long-suffering sigh. "Write it down. Please. Between Hermione and I, we'll take it from there."
"I said fine. I'll give it a try." He didn't want to feel this way anymore, to feel like he was always one step away from something pushing him over the edge.
Draco just closed his eyes, willing his headache away. "Not this morning, love. I'm just too tired. How about some porridge."
The Harry from a week ago would have used that risk to worry over, to fret and keep him from acting. He'd have decided that this would ruin everything and that it was better to keep what you had than to try for something more.
Harry simply stared, irritation and confusion and sadness warring in his features. He seemed to settle on the irritation. "Fine. Explain."
She nodded. "I'm not sure we'll ever know why for sure, but given the vitriol coming from Alexander's parents, we can assume. And I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have some hand in Sophia's parents' fate."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I don't know. Maybe start deciding on your own what you eat for dinner and stop letting Granger bully you into eating what she thinks you should eat."
Draco found Dudley in the dining room, talking with his girlfriend and several older women. He waited for the conversation to die down and examined the walls with their tacky wallpaper and disturbingly still Muggle family portraits. It looked like it'd been decorated by someone who wished they had taste but sadly lacked any actual discernment.
The rest of the noise came from where Alex sobbed loudly, cuddled in Molly's arms as she spoke to him quietly.
"Alex," Draco said quietly, "I'm going to put up a magic spell that will make it so you can't hear what Harry and I say, okay? It's grown-up talk."
"You have no idea," she agreed. "Emergency-placement foster homes are generally only used when other, pre-approved homes aren't available. However, given the circumstances, Helen thinks we might be able to make it work."
And then??? And then she had the audacity to go and be all fan-fucking-tastic at her reading/acting. There are moments in this podfic that had me gasping at how well she captured Harry and Draco's emotions in her voice. As a writer, I feel like she's crawled into my head and painted my vision with her tones and inflections. If you're coming to read this story and have skipped over the podfic in the first chapter, I encourage you to stop and go back if you're able. Listen to the story as you read, or just listen by itself, and let PhenomenalAsterisk pull you into Harry and Draco's heads.
It was why he loved their flat so much, actually, with its large, floor to ceiling windows that brought in light and space, opening onto a veranda overlooking the river. And while Draco hadn't questioned Harry's insistence that they not cover the window with curtains, only lightweight sheers that wouldn't block the lights of the city, Harry wasn't foolish enough to believe that Draco hadn't known something more was going on.
"Ron, stop it." Hermione gave an exasperated sigh. "Harry, you and Ginny know you're not engaged, nor are you likely toâ€”"
"His Portkey must have activated within seconds. It didn't have time to do much damage, and he'll make a full recovery. There's some healing to do with his organs, but he'll be fine."
Harry was exhausted, but he was feeling elated. He'd just spent three hours ordering an entirely new wardrobe. It was astounding finding clothing that he picked out, things that
"He doesn't. We wanted to talk to you first. But now it's his turn. Teddy's going to take you to Grammy Andromeda's for a while."
Draco turned back to Hermione. "You take Lyra, I think. I'll take Alex. Did the social worker say she needed him to bring anything?"
"I didn't tell him what it was!" She twirled back to her honorary big brother and huffed. "But you couldn't tell me a secret if I didn't let you talk, now could you?"
Draco stepped outside to sit on their new veranda in his plush, outdoor armchair with a glass of wine. Merlin, he was turning into a fucking Hufflepuff, wasn't he? They'd been living together less than a week and already he was coming to depend on Harry's constant presence. Harry's current assignment would only keep him gone for two days, Neville having hired Harry to photograph some specimens to submit to Herbology Quarterly. He was sometimes gone for a couple of weeks at a time when he was deep in a project, especially now that he'd caught the eye of the art community and his nature photography was in demand, so two days was hardly anytime at all.
Draco paused, and Harry realised he wasn't the only one breathing heavily. "Oh, right. Sorry." Draco crawled back and sat on his feet, rubbing his hands over his face.
It was too much. She was only thirteen, and as much as she liked to think that was grown up, she didn't think she was equipped to deal with this yet.
Draco watched her walk away and felt strange as he considered her last words. He shrugged them off and followed Lyra's voice down the hallway.
"Harry," Draco greeted, a wide grin on his face as he drew out a chair between himself and Blaise. "Did you finish your Potions essay?"
I held her a moment, wishing the warmth of her embrace could fill the hole in my chest that had settled in over the last month.
Harry forced his eyes to remain still. Rolling them would just offend the elf, and it wasn't her fault. "I can do that myself, Tindles, but thank you. I think I'll make myself some dinner first."
"Are you seriously quoting your Mind-healer while we stand naked in the shower?" Harry asked, wiping the last of the tears out of his face and reaching for the shampoo bottle. He was beginning to feel like a prune.
Draco looked at the boy's small cheeks, rounded with baby fat, with large, plush lashes feathering from his closed eyes. His dark-chocolate curls fell in ringlets over the tips of his ears and along his forehead.
Dudley greeted people by name, accepting condolences and giving a few hugs, but Harry was ignored by almost every person who entered. Those who acknowledged him mostly sneered, though one older woman patted his hand with a quiet, "Harry, dear."
"Cheese, Potter. Lovely French cheese." He held up a baguette and bowl of grapes and berries. "This is wonderful. How'd you know my favourite cheeses?"
Draco sighed. There was nothing to be done for it, he supposed. He was officially becoming a Slytherpuff.
"You want to know, right? What if I kiss you so you know what it's like to kiss a bloke. See if it feels different than the Weasâ€”uh, Ginny. No feelings, just a friend helping you out and all."
"Yeah. It has." Dudley turned to Draco, giving him an awkward smile. "Is this your boyfriend then?" The question sounded polite, kind even, but all Harry could hear were the ghostly echoes of taunts and jeers.
make me happy," I said, and I raised my hand slowly, giving him the chance to pull away if he wanted.
"Is it still because of the war?" Draco stood up suddenly, pushing his hands in his pockets. "Or maybe because I'm gay? Orâ€”"
He was a beautiful child, and he'd been through so much. Draco wondered how much more he'd have to go through before he could start to heal. Would a family member he'd never met come to claim him? Or perhaps he'd become a ward of some well-meaning couple who'd come to care for him, but who might never accept him as their own.
The silence grew between them, and Harry couldn't bring himself to open his eyes, to see what Draco thought of him. He could hear Draco moving, though, and figured he was probably done, ready to leave.
And I hate myself for it, hate knowing that I had any part in this. Knowing that I was upstairs, in a normal kids' room with toys and a bed and everything I ever asked for. And Harry lived with this."
It was like it always was these days, like that day when they'd returned from holidays. Harry couldn't help but follow like a piece of metal being pulled along by a magnet. Draco's presence pulled him in, and Harry was helpless against it.
"Fuck. Message. Hermione," Draco said, looking at her. She'd sat up straight at his change of tone. "If I had an item with a Protean Charm placed on it and Harry had the other, could you use it to trace him?"
"Gathii, welcome back." I turned to Draco, embarrassed and afraid he'd recognise my tumultuous reaction. "I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt here."
So posting on Monday/Friday is turning into Sunday night/Thursday night (American time). Either way, you're getting an update to read twice a week, lol. I like to keep chapters around 3k words, but this one is a bit shorter. It was just a natural breaking point, but the next one will back to around 3k. Likes and friendly reviews are most appreciated! I'd love to hear from you.
"Always has been." Jimmy jerked his head to the field when a whistle blew. "Oh, wow, sorry about keeping you. Mr Malfoy's already up there. Enjoy the game!"
"All right," the Healer said, standing up. "I think I have it." He looked down at the boy who had fallen asleep in Draco's arm. "He'll probably sleep for a while now. It's hard on a child so small."
I finished the last chapters this week, and I'll be honest, I don't want to wait to post the rest. SO, stick around, because the rest of the story will be posted tomorrow afternoon my time. There's one more chapter and an epilogue. I hope you love it!
