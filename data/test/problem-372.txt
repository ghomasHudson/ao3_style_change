"No we're not, I was denied," Harry slumped to the ground and sat with his back against the wall. "It's all too much. I need a vacation!"
"Surreal." Harry muttered, used to a newspaper full of crimes everyday.
Andromeda watched them as Harry went on explaining and she smiled happily when they sat side by side, heads together, bowed over a small book to figure it all out. She let it go on for a while, just enjoying the sight. Now her attention elsewhere, she didn't notice Teddy drop his gift. The loud clap had everyone jump up, and Teddy cry for the loss of his shiny toy.
"Thought so." Draco poked some fun at him but Harry ignored it and waited until je was done. Eventually, they agreed on the bookstore as their first stop.
Silas stumped him on the shoulder. "We know, now shut up and greet our honorary staff member politely."
"Want to go shopping together?" Harry asked.
"He's homeless," She said, a little surprised. "I'm well aware Lucius is a bastard but throwing his sons future for a mere title, that is egoistic and arrogant above all else."
Harry actually smiled briefly. "Just shouting it is then."
"Nahh," Charlie answered. "Nobody working here got time for that. Their team is small and there aren't much people ready to devote their life to this demanding job."
Draco however, didn't wait for the other to come back and levitated himself up to the windowsill, jumping in and landing on his feet with a thud. He took a moment of thought, whether to go left, right or up when he heard Harry's footsteps above his head. Up it is as he went, finding Harry in the library. He asked his question again which made the black haired wizard shrug: "I don't know."
Harry took a step, tripped and tumbled down – a somersault and he was flat on his back, groaning. He grappled around for his glasses that had fallen of when he went down.
"Not what I expected, that's for sure." Harry said with a smile as he took his seat. He kept looking around. The room was busy. Dragon Handlers talked and laughed loud, with half their gear on, the rest beside their seat on the floor creating a tripping hazard nobody fell over anymore. While many people walked around, they all were used to the stuff by now. There were men in lab coats and some in robes, while others opted for muggle wear; some were reading books floating on eye level but most were socializing. They went from table to table, the groups around the room changing with the minute as they took their plates with them.
Harry, taken aback by the situation, just folded his arms and listened. He couldn't help the thought that if Mrs. Weasley would've heard, she'd washed his mouth out with soap. He was fairly sure.
"What?" Harry asked. "About the potion rings?"
Charlie just nodded. "The only thing that has ever happened since I've been here was Mr. Muller being wrestled into the Travellers inn by two old townies for a cup of Flusher Potion to clear his head after he had one to many drinks at the bar. It was funny to see, you know, the light popped on all around, it was the talk for days!"
"What?" Draco answered, moving between the shelves, having Harry trail after him.
"Language!" Andromeda glared.
"Never," Harry was honest about it. "I was kind of scared to do that, actually, so yeah, if you got time, I'd like that."
Draco didn't say anything to that. He merely checked the time and waited a few minutes. "Have you come up with anything?"
Maybe asleep - she prayed silently to Merlin, all the gods she could think of and even the devil that for the love of magic they were asleep but she had eyes; she saw Harry's ripped clothes, the blood that had, at one point, gushed but was now dried up and crusted up over his legs, arms, neck and back. It was Harry's blood that coloured the other boy in several places.
Harry found her in the back garden where she sat sprawled, legs open wide on the ground. Teddy sat between her feet and they rolled a ball back and forth. Harry looked at them happily until Andromeda noticed them.
"Oh! I didn't want you find me gone so I thought to tell you before I leave."
In the elevator, Draco noticed how pale Harry looked and with a leap in his heart was reminded of Harry's condition. "Are you alright?" He asked anxious.
"Fine," Harry put his hand up in mock surrender. "Show me the way."
"Well," Harry looked at her and relayed what the night guard had said. "Also Charlie said there isn't an Auror Office to speak with."
"Right good smacker he got!" Charlie came to sit next to Harry. but not before he danced through the room, reenacting how exactly his colleague got swiped, and landed. Charlie had to scramble up from the floor after.
Intimidating was the right word, Harry thought. Silas was slim and soft but Solomon was bulky and rough. Tall too, he towered everyone in the room by at least a head and a half. Everything about him was big and brute, rough skin, many scars. He possessed a strong jawline with stubbles, masking some of those scars and high cheekbones with freckles. Then, Harry noticed his eyes and gaped.
Couldn't they see, how could not one teacher see that Seamus clenched his quill to tightly, snapped several per class and cursed without sound every time his eyes fell to Dean's empty seat?
"Malfoy," Ron spat as both he and his sister who stepped away from the door towards the blond. "What the fuck are you doing here?"
"That I wanted to see the world.." Harry finished slowly as he pulled out map after map and different kinds of parchment and other forms of notes from the box to lay out over the desk. He never noticed Andromeda leaving him alone.
In the morning, Harry was still bleary eyed and yawning over a cup of steaming hot coffee and also very annoyed by the exciting chatter between Andromeda and Draco. He quickly learned that Draco loved shopping and was all for it. While his father had ensured he was homeless, he kept access to his own vault filled to the brim and had more then enough to spend. He was, to Harry's surprise, looking forward to get as many gifts as possible to hand out once Christmas came and went as far as calling dips on pushing the pram.
Soon, they found themselves back at Charlie's home, seated on the couch with a simple cold dinner. They took turns in the shower and all the while, the main topic of conversation remained their flight. It had been utter brilliance, deliberation, freedom.
For a moment, Harry stared warily at Draco but, he settled little Teddy on the floor who happily crawled out of the room in search of his toys. Harry watched the little boy go and as soon as he was out of sight, he crossed his arms and stared at the blonde, as if waiting for him to say more.
"Hey! I was in Auror you training you know!"
"Say.. Meda?" He turned towards the elderly Lady who was waving her wand, getting tea ready and she hummed in reply. "He doesn't really look scared.. Does he?"
"Ours? Here in England we only have two real settlements. Diagon ally and Hogsmeade. Of course, Hogwarts, the Ministry and St. Mungo's Hospital are pretty much the rest of what makes up our world, since Britain has a very small wizarding population, especially after two wars. But, yes, that's basically all we have."
Draco looked odd at his Aunt when she too, sat down with her own cup of coffee, already made by Harry previous. "Why would he be nervous?"
Charlie flew a decent speed, sometimes slowing down so he could hear Harry giggle in childish delight. "Look! A deer!" As they were out the barrier ward and when they flew in at one point, Charlie almost came to a complete stop as Harry jerked his striped shirt. "Unicorns! I see a baby unicorn! It's still gold-ish!"
The blonde sat on his outstretched robe on the floor, back against the wall. Ironically so, he had chosen to sit underneath the very sink that let to the Chamber of Secrets - the chamber of doom and death as Harry had dubbed it in his mind and Harry agreed when his mind supplied Draco looked like shit. He looked awful but still so lovely - beautifully, sitting there, carefully laying out the toys that would bring him his high.
They sat on that bench for at least another hour, Harry unwilling to let the tale go and they talked about it for a while. Charlie made it clear he told him to understand how important the shack behind them was, not to try and find a solution. Soon the air became lighter and Charlie stood up. "Now we had that little and also very uncomfortable talk, which I rather have we don't mention again, like ever.. How about we go in and see some babies?"
Dizzily, almost happily - Harry looked away from the blade he had let go off and caught the sight of Draco's arm. Fresh teeny, tiny puncture holes in grey skin, veins popping up, surrounding the dark mark and Harrys' finger glided gently over them.
Draco realised the house elf wouldn't do such a thing and rolled his eyes, balling his fists. "Forget that, just take Harry's wand away and hide it until I say he can get it back!"
Harry glanced at Draco who shrugged and then stared at the Auror. "No, we don't. There's been garbage written about me for years, so why would I?"
"Morning." He mumbled, taking a seat across the two, where he immediately noticed how pale and tired Harry looked. He didn't get a reply but steeled himself either way when he spoke again. "We need to talk."
"I can't!" Harry kicked the door once, not amused. "I've been trying for hours! None of the lock opening spells I know work!"
The first floor had Teddy's room which was originally the master bedroom and the bathroom at one side and the other side holding Andromeda's room and her study. The top floor being the attic, held many boxes in one nook while the rest was cleaned out for Harry and Draco. Two single bed on each side under the sloped roof with a thick carpet in the middle. A couch to chill on stood at the feet ends of the beds, facing towards the window by their head ends where a desk with two closets on either side was cramped in. Their room, small as it may be, definitely had earned the title home for them.
"We know." The Auror roared. "It's idiotic and a waste of time but opinions can be louder then logic."
"I'd rather say it wasn't explained completely and clearly, it was not your fault, but rather poor delaying," She smiled kindly and tapped him on the knee. "We don't say no to anyone willing to help out the Dragon Sanctuary. You must know our staff is small, and everyone is busy, overly so."
Not one, but two students were out of bed and if that wasn't all of it, they were outside, on dangerous ground.
"Are you boys ready to go?" Andromeda asked. She was bundled up in a thick cloak, long scarf and a stylish winter hat on her head, Draco was dressed similar and Teddy too, was bundled up warm. The poor child could barely move in the thick layers of winter clothes and Harry kept on snickering every time he saw Teddy and the little too large woollen hat that kept sagging over one of his eyes.
"So, we're roommates now, huh?"
Just as Andromeda was about to give the sad boy beside her some heart felt words, a heavy car engine rumbling came close to the house, the windows rattled and Harry perked up. He gave Andromeda a questioning look but she merely raised an eyebrow and a slight shake of her head, indicating she didn't know either. Harry got up, to look out the window and see what it was all about.
Kreacher, not understanding the situation, took the wand, bowed and vanished out of the room and Harry, silently cursing, grabbed the ladder and climbed on it. Atop, he took two books and and climbed down, putting them on the desk and as if a light bulb burned above his head; he walked around the bookshelf and gave a push. The shelf only wobbled and stayed in place to Harry dismay. He repeated the push, adding one firm kick and all the books were sprawled over the floor. Harry grinned but not for long.
Apparently, Harry wasn't quite alright, not yet thinking straight and his magic refused to calm down. The crack sound in the air booming alerted the Aurors. Draco barely could see them through the rain, further down the street, turning around swift. His hair whipped around his face and his shirt danced in the wind.
"Teenagers." The man sighed. "Very well on your way you go."
Harry groaned. On one hand he had a severe dislike for shopping but on the other, he was very eager to see what Diagon ally looked like during the winter.
Draco nodded and looked for words. "A muggle floo call?"
"My dear Draco, You're crazy or maybe under influence of some drug, did you use a gone-wrong potion.. a mixed up spell - bitten by something? Because you are rambling and I will not have anything to do with it, so leave me alone for Merlin's sake!" Harry told him, still breathing heavily from the run and his build up anger.
Harry snorted. "As if."
"Nobody left the war unscathed. You didn't, I didn't and Harry didn't either. He has a bad heart. It's barely functioning as it is and he's on medication to keep it working. He has to take it every day, if he doesn't, well, any bit too much strain on his body or any bit of emotional pressure sends his heart haywire. I didn't know Harry didn't take his medication as prescribed since he's been here, because, if he had. This wouldn't have happened."
"What the hell are Aurors doing here?" Draco spoke in low tones, his blood running cold. With one word, he understood Harry's need to keep quiet. He was doubtful they were for him judging by Harry's undiluted fear. He fought the urge for silence and hiding, all the times he had been chased out of the wizarding world by Aurors flashed though his mind.
He walked through a long hallway past doors and several weirdly angled stairs until he passed a receptionist. She sat facing a large dining area. Harry peeked in and it had an uncanny resemblance to the Leaky Cauldron down in London which struck him as odd considering how far away he was. He shook his head, greeted the lady behind the desk and went out the front door. Harry being to busy looking up and around, wasn't watching where he walked and smacked into someone. Ready to apologize, he was hugged and let go before his mind processed it.
All the rooms were done in clinical white. In the front room, Harry had covered the lengthy wall in a disarray of polaroid photo's of his body art work. There were thank-you notes and even some cut-outs from where is work had been featured in magazines, the making of the wall piece took him a few years to build.
Harry looked up, and caught Draco's eyes in the mirror. He flushed, Draco smirked and when Draco was about to make a, highly likely, scattering remark, Harry bested him to it. "Let's get this show on the road."
Everything had shattered. Fast.
"But what if any sort of crime happens?"
"Sorry." Harry mumbled sheepishly while Draco grinned in glee but Andromeda waved it away.
Harry took over feeding Teddy, Draco caught the attention of a waitress to order food and drinks for the table while Andromeda went over the bags they brought in to see if they hadn't made any mistakes.
Harry winced as he looked into the kitchen, the pieces where everywhere and he counted himself lucky that Draco hadn't reacted to the noise. Quickly he apologized to the elf and with his wand and the book he became to hate in hand he ran away; not quite up to being scolded by the creature was why he made a two second split decision on starting fixing the other side of the house first.
Harry sat on the couch, watching Charlie wander around the room. He relayed what had happened. Charlie hummed through his explanation and congratulated him. "Bloody fantastic!"
The rest of his sentence ended in a murmur and Draco hadn't heard. The blonde made it obvious by shouting angrily for the other to man up and say it already: "I know your a bloody Gryffindor! Scrape some courage up and tell me!"
"Side hustle?" Harry raised an eyebrow.
"It's a necessary thing, Harry. The longer we wait, the longer it take," Having said that, Draco left Harry with all the bags. "I'm going to get more stuff, goodbye."
Within seconds, Draco slumped, muscles giving in - his breath grew shallow and his heartbeat slowed greatly. The thing, his heart - although he was of the thought he didn't quite own one, the heartless bastard he was - it thumped in his chest just sluggishly pumping the blood through his veins. It was dangerously slow but he felt great. A smile was upon his face, showing just how much he was enjoying the feeling as his unsteady eyes tried to focus back on Harry, who in a rapid pace slashed numerous little cuts, relishing in his own hurt and the blood red colour finally real and there to touch - not just the unreal splash tugging at the corners of his eyes all the time as a bloody curse.
"Fair enough." Harry answered as they stood next to each, overlooking the Dragon Reservoir. From their vantage point they could see miles into it. Harry had a fun time pointing dragons out with Charlie telling him which Dragon it was, their name, age and other fun details. It certainly was a way to pass time. They ate sandwiches Charlie had made and brought with him, shrunken in his pocket and Harry shared the candy bar he was given. It was their early dinner. They talked, laughed and dithered around the campsite. The open spot was surrounded by trees and bush, and Charlie was plucking some of the greens.
"Ow! I remember! Ow! Sorry!" He squeaked, flailing his arms. "Sorry! Ow! Please let go."
Harry turned away, but quickly remembered something. "Please tell him to hold off, I heard no-one can or will investigate so I'd like to do so myself."
"And?" Ginny pressed.
Not taking offence to Draco's comment, Harry nodded. "Thanks."
Andromeda smiled when the boy went straight for the Christmas tree, grabbed a present - the ones she bought and wrapped well on time - and shook it happily, babbling fast. She went over and took the present away. "That's not even yours," She put it back under the tree and removed Teddy. "That one is for your Uncle Harry."
As she said, so it went. Fully packed with bags, Harry arrived at the Leaky Cauldron, Draco mere paces in front of him as they navigated between the busy tables to the corner where Andromeda, many bags of her own, was sipping coffee and feeding Teddy crust-less bread.
Andromeda pointed her wand at Harry. "Rennervate."
But Harry wasn't there yet, along the second stair, the boy grasped his leg which made Harry stumble, but he quickly resumed again by holding on to the railing of the stairs, jerking his leg loose out of the grip and ran again.
"There's the reason for Sirius wanting to visit."
Draco raised an eyebrow and got up from the bed. Harry looked through the window again as if somebody had stung him badly, he started to run through the room, looking for a place to hide. Even if, there was none.
She pushed the door further open and called out in the dim lit room. "Harry?" And inched closer. "Draco?"
"What now?" Solomon questioned his brother over his shoulder as he stood a little helplessly in front of Harry, with his hand out, and literally no reaction. Silas shrugged, Shelley made a motion to get on with it.
Andromeda stood up and took Teddy to the living room. There, the tree was set up with shiny baubles, an enchanted angel on top, and a little train making rounds on the track around the base. Some simple garlands were strung up, and she had used some spells long forgotten. If she thought about it, the last time she used them was when her daughter had been a young child. Now she used those very same charms to make snow fall from the ceiling and dissolve just above head-height to entertain her daughter's son. Teddy loved it. She suppressed a loud laugh as the toddler wiggled to grab the snow he couldn't touch.
"Hi." He mumbled when he finally noticed the other and sipped his hot coffee, not aware of the questionable look his way.
"Hello?" Draco tried and even gave a wave but Harry simply went through the motions and didn't reply until he presented Teddy with his bowl of mushy fruit with little chunks of baby biscuits and a dab of milk.
"Because I'm looking at everything to see where I do want to go?" Harry answered in a question, as if Draco was the not grasping it.
For the rest of the night, they kept shifting countries back and forth arguing whether on not to include it on their road trip.
"I don't know, I'll be right back." Harry answered instead and ran up the stairs, already cursing on the library. Something up there, definitely. Harry flung himself into the room, wand at the ready but, nothing out of the ordinary. The shelves seemed untouched, the books were on their place and the fire was down. Scratching the back of his head, he shuffled on his feet feeling slightly uneasy as he tried to determine whether or not the accidents in their home had something to do with the harsh treatment he'd given books previously. He hoped not. His mind not wanting to know what Draco would do upon hearing that fact but also realizing he would so not enjoy it.
Harry wanted to faint. Draco was strict in how to handle books but when it came to Hermione that was nothing. Compared to the blonde she was the devil but it seemed he had no choice. He wasn't ready to start up a troublesome fight over it and meekly nodded, leading her the way.
"Move." Andromeda grounded out and Draco slid away.
"Odd?" Charlie asked. "They're just one of many at the Sanctuary. They're a bit off, I know, but we're all just basket cases here, devoting our lives to a cause."
"Cross breeding?" Harry asked. "That's allowed?"
An hour later, after a happy lunch, Harry and Draco stood outside the Leaky Cauldron together. Andromeda and Teddy already left minutes before to the antique store above Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour .
Ron immediately followed up. "And why are you here?"
"How did you?"
"Alright," Charlie took a deep breath. "The muggle population, I'm talking world wide throughout, has in the last centuries grown exceptionally large and became a lot smarter with their technology which has reached new highs in recent decades. Now, are you aware why the Statue of Secrecy, signed in on 1689, established in 1692 and fully complete and enforced a little into the 1700 was for?"
He went back to the shop, picked up his photo and purchased a card with the sunset over the mountains and pleased to see a couple of flecks moving around on the card. He scribbled a quick few lines about his arrival and the Nursery, about how much he loved being here already and slapped the photo of him and Charlie onto it with a sticking charm.
Letters were send, rather quickly. They flew through the fire network fast and less then a month later Harry found himself packing his bag. He had gotten to know Charlie quite well and a travel date was set. Harry debated over using his school trunk but considering he'd never once fully emptied the thing he decided against it. Harry didn't fancy shovelling through seven years worth of junk and found it would have to wait for another time. Maybe when he came back from his vacation. Instead, he visited Diagon Alley and bought a large bag pack, some clothes on insistence of Hermione and some other odds and ends to bring with him. That included a gift for Charlie in the form on Honeydukes' candy from the second store newly opened in the Alley; Candy not available in Romania.
"Is it hatching?" Harry asked when they stood in front of an enclosure full of rocks, an bright grey, almost silver egg smack in the middle half way covered by coals. He wondered because the top was cracked.
Draco nodded. Harry felt he did so as his chin thumped on top of his head and knocked Draco's elbow, by doing so, he was able to move his chair to the left and Draco moved to stand next to him, still staring at the writing. "I really can't read it."
"The new years gone be great," Harry said a little drunk as he fell into his bed. "We're going to have so much fun."
Harry, with ever present grace, fell flat on the wooden floor of a large, otherwise bare room. It was dark and had no windows nothing but just a door. It took him a bit getting up. The port key trip was short but the distance far and as warned about, he felt extremely dizzy and nauseous. He did his very best not to heave as he remained where he was, not a thought was spared on getting up.
It wasn't until Harry made the dangerous move for the fifth time before he fell. When he fell, he fell hard. From the top of the ladder he went down to the floor, taking the bookshelf with him as he landed flat on his back. Books came toppling after him in fast rate. They came down like rain, landing with heavy thuds. His legs and torso were being hit a few times; one of the last books came down, right at his head. Harry saw and on reflex rolled away with a groan of minor pain escaping, hearing the loudest thud next to his head. "Damn. That would have hurt. "
He couldn't take his eyes of it, completely enthralled. Charlie was doing a little better. He had been here before but he too, was in no hurry to move onto the next sight.
"Its," Andromeda started and Harry cut in. "Home. Its home and thats where I want to be. Hogwarts isn't home anymore."
It was stunning, small but stunning. A bathroom and a kitchenette on the opposite side of the room, nicely tucked in under the loft that was clear to be the bedroom. A large corner desk on the left and a couch with rug and fireplace on the right. The walls, loft and ceiling had never been covered and remained the dark wood the hut was made of. It only took one look to know Charlie's favourite colour is purple. Everything, the couch, the rug and dozens of flowerpots, even the cabinet doors of the little kitchen were in various tones of purple. Harry was also surprised to see a lot of bookcases which didn't held that much books but plants instead and a handful of fish bowls scattered around.
"It doesn't, and on the rare occasion it's something petty kids do," Charlie shrugged. "Parents just talk it out and punish their kids accordingly. Adults breaking laws just doesn't happen, really."
"If you have a hot minute, I'll come with," Charlie said as he put the watering can away and grabbed a cloth to clean any spilled water. "I reckon you've never flown with a loaded net under a broom?"
He gripped his trunk tightly and twirl further, he was gone.
"Sorry 'bout that." Charlie chuckled and lost his grip, letting Harry tumble back again. It took them three tries and Harry still wasn't back up onto his feet. Then Charlie spotted something and abandoned his mission. That left Harry, who now was also in a fit of giggles to stand up himself.
"Leave Teddy with Draco." Andromeda ordered when she stepped into the living room with Harry following. The blonde annoyed from being interrupted again sighed but dutifully took the toddler, settled him in the corner of the couch and levitated a book for him over. He caught it and handed it to Teddy who squealed and opened it, immediately, a soft voice coming from the book filled the room and guided Teddy through the pages.
Andromeda knew what he meant. "When my husband fell away, according to the old family laws, I regained my place in the family. Its a stuffy, complicated thing, old family magicks.," She sighed. "Basically said, I'm the last one carrying the name, and so I inherited everything," She pointed at the miniature bike. "Including this."
"Why?" Charlie asked.
Andromeda closed the books she had scattered on the desk and stacked them away, making room. "Sit," She pulled out the chair and Harry sat down. She then placed a carton box on the table and enlarged it. "I didn't know what to gift you, but I remembered some maps Sirius had once upon a day. It was a bit of a hassle to locate them, not knowing if they'd still excisted but here they are."
"Then, isn't there anything to do about it?" Harry asked and Charlie shook his head.
"Offices," Charlie waved it away and made Harry follow again. "Research, labs, those kind of things, there goes a lot into running this place. We Dragon Handlers wouldn't know what to do if there aren't people keeping track and figuring it out for us."
Harry is tired. Mentally and physically exhausted. He barely eats and sleeps even less. When he does sleep, he has heavy nightmares. The nightmares though, aren't restricted to when his eyes are closed. The cruelly he sees at night follow him into the light. Throughout the days he keeps seeing the worst and everywhere he looks those awful red eyes are in sight. His own eyes, never unseeing and his body always feeling the pain - it's horrible and Harry does not know what to do when his sight is always blurred with the edge of red.
Hermione watched from afar as she saw how her friend broke further and no matter her trying to right the wrongs, she wasn't reaching trough and neither was Ron. In the end, they gave up. Almost. They still tried to keep watching his back as they found solace in each other.
Upon another dozen of no's in a row Harry dared to ask. "Are you sure?"
Harry blanched, shook his head wildly and got ready to take a bite but decided to put indeed some effort in. "I can cook as you know, but I actually can make a full traditional English Christmas dinner too.. Then again, how does rabbit for a main dish sound?"
Draco tried to read the words Harry pointed at but soon gave up. "I can't. What does it say?"
"Sorry, Mr. Gheata, we'll go now." Charlie said. He gave the old man a wave, who showed a ghost of a smile and a playful shoo-ing motion. Charlie pulled Harry along back outside. There, he flopped into the patch of grass beside the broom.
She did not say why, which, if the boys would think about it could have had several reasons. They did not think of those. Both knew Andromeda was not the youngest anymore. She needed the hold on but refused to outright say so.
Draco rolled his eyes and stalked over to Harry. He bent through his knees. "They also know where I am. Thanks to you, I'm a part of your mess."
The new Defense teacher was an idiot. The man didn't understand why the whole class fought up a riot when he stood to his point that werewolves were harmless creatures and people just like the rest outside the full moon.
Many a times Harry asked himself these questions. Maybe they all asked the same things or maybe they all had a slightly different answer, he just was at a loss and failed to understand. He needed to understand. Even now, as he sat down on the ledge of the Astronomy tower, legs dropped over the edge swinging back and forth. Every once in a while Harry shook his head to try and rid the feeling of being watched and forcing himself to stay put and not plummet himself into the touching nothingness, miles and miles down to the ground.
"Anyway," Charlie went on. "We had to wrestle her into submission and place her in a different pen, while we have no male of her breed, we hope she'll find the male Blue Double-Tooths to her taste."
True to her words, Harry only spent fifteen minutes of twiddling his thumbs, listening to the soft snores of Solomon who seemed to have fallen asleep and the fast scratching of Shelley's quill. Silas settled the cardboard box with supplies Harry asked for on the table in front of him. "This is as close to the size you asked for, if you want anything bigger, I'll put the request for funds in, and, if granted, will give you the money to buy them in town, that may take a day or so, though."
"Prim old man," Charlie sighed. He looked up at Harry who remained standing, arms crossed. Noticing Harry's foul mood, Charlie leaned back and raised an eyebrow. "So? What do you want to do?"
"You'll have to tell me the deal about the plants later, though."
Andromeda sat on the couch. She levitated a low, flat basket off the shelf and with half an eye on Teddy, she made herself ready to do some crafts. She wanted to make some tiny paper flowers for Teddy's memory books. From the kitchen, she heard the boys murmur and knew they were stalling. "Wrapping takes time boys," She called out. "Get a move on."
"That's good?"
"You willingly will go shopping and push Teddy along?" Harry asked and Draco nodded.
That pacified Harry some and a little brighter he settled more comfortably in his chair. "Thank you. I guess. Even she doesn't worry as much about grades and exams when Christmas is nearing and just goes with the flow."
Luckily, Draco was a quick thinker. He grabbed the sheets from the cart, used to provide a clean bed to work on and covered both sides to the floor with them, hiding Harry in a little tent. He figured with Aurors in the building, using magic was not the greatest idea. Technically seen, he was not allowed. Long ago they broke his hawthorn and unicorn hair wand and a simple red dot on his wrist alerted every wand seller he may not carry one. Still, he aquired one. Draco's hand glided over the intricate carved piece of wood within a hidden pocket of his pants. Now however was not the time to use it.
So Harry went, flat on his face and when he got up, the other boy laughed.
How could they? Harry, again – never stopping, always on the move rounded another corner, went trough a door and ran up the many stairs. Couldn't they see? How did they not know they needed time and a soft helping hand? Did they have no feels, couldn't they see that what the ordered them to be was impossible? Unbelievable?
"Thanks Meda, for the vote of confidence." Harry snorted and sipped his tea, slowly glossing over what they had discussed over the course of their ride and the stop at a fast food restaurant. It was there that Draco tried to pay with galleons and showed to not be entirely adequate about muggle life and how he also had refused to let them eat in his car. Harry was quite proud to announce that, with the opportunity to exchange blows, they remained hands off during their brief time out of the car. "I'm going to St. Mungo's in the morning. Get a new emergency pen and get back on my prescribed potions. I guess with that got around I'm going to need them."
"The stone," Harry asked, a little frenzy. He stood up, quickly patting himself down several times. "Did I lose it?"
"Why are you here, Harry?" She asked gently.
"It's a date, dinner in the cafeteria after?" He grinned.
"Congratulations." Draco stated and smiled slightly then promptly went back to his book.
"Eleven." Charlie deadpanned. "I got work to do."
"I'll put Teddy to bed." Andromeda said when the boys were done and sat waiting for the toddler to finish up. They smiled and got up to leave when she added the condition for doing so. "But you will come Christmas shopping with me, tomorrow."
Bernadette smiled when she explained the card. Apparently it allowed Harry to move semi-free through the main building whenever he needed help from their researchers or labs. Basically, a keycard. He nodded dumbly and her smile broadened. "You're an open book to read. You want to help. So, I thought it wise for you to have some acces, some freedom to make use of our facility to do research. We have several labs that you'll find to be of use."
The blonde too, cherished it. Harry had, in the past, offered to take it out, let it heal and redo it but the Draco had refused over an over again until Harry stopped offering and the flower stayed since. Harry was, secretly so, grateful for it.
Jovial greetings were shared and some banter, picks and pokes at Harry's outfit until they reached the local bakery in town for a bite and off they went, Charlie apparating them to the Dragon Sanctuary.
"Fair enough but what about Egypt? I really want to go there and see the Pyramids."
"That's the second time someone is putting me to work on my holiday." Harry said amused.
"Welcome to my house!" Charlie beamed, throwing his arms open wide and effectively blocking Harry's view as he didn't took a step beyond the threshold. Harry ducked under his arm to see which it turn made Charlie sheepishly laugh and step aside.
Then, one day, Harry stumbled into the first floor girls lavatory. Once, the place had been haunted by Moaning Myrtle. She had passed over because she numbly followed the old History teacher Mr. Binns when he left the earth realm. Not for the first time, Harry wished Peeves had followed as well. The poltergeist still an annoying presence in the castle.
That night, Harry talked with Andromeda for hours about anything and everything. She had gotten him excited for plans to make and things to do. That night he settled down in her attic, on the camping bed below the roof window and fell asleep dreaming of cruising through foreign cities and alongside pretty white beaches with palm trees on the bright red bike.
She tried to reason Harry, bring him back to reality, but she failed because she had yelled and cried, called the friendship between the two boys a toxic tryst that was pulling them further down. Harry had ripped away - telling her that it wasn't true and made way, leaving her behind, standing alone.
Luckily, the rest of their visit went swift. Their passport ordered, Harry was pleased that they would arrive before the end of January and he was determined to leave once they arrived. Draco seconded that thought, both itching to just go, concrete plans or not by then.
Diagon Alley was beautiful. Absolutely stunning. Harry stopped midtrack as soon as he was through the brick wall and looked his eyes out. The street was close enough to being empty and just a handful of early risers had muddled steps on the fresh snow, a light mist still hovering from the cold as the first sunrays peeked through the clouds. The early morning smell of winter still clung strong in the air.
Ron nodded. "Nobody can just waltz up to the Dragon Reservoir and get in. It's big and entertaining says Charlie and you can easily catch a breather there."
"Totally fine, just a good few cuts and bruises and he broke his wrist," Charlie said, taking Harry's fear away. "He's being fixed up, a dose of Skelegro will set him alright."
They, Harry knew, were just the few of many, going over it by the top of his head. Yet, the greatest examples of the elder generations ignoring, letting them fend for themselves and not acknowledging what was really going on came from themselves.
Draco had half a mind to turn himself in, spill the beans and see where it landed him, although that was a little too Gryffindor to his taste. He thought to hide. He thought to throw some money around and probably walk away unscathed. He could go on with his life as if it was nothing. After all, in political circles, his name still held weight, and he'd saved an emergency fund, just in case such an occasion may rear its ugly head.
Couldn't they see how Ron's bloodshot, puffy eyes never looked at anybody anymore? How he grew thinner as time went by just because he had no appetite? He blamed himself over many deaths and of course obvious one, his brother, mourning the losses every waking moment.
The voice became muffled as it got dimmed, the man moving away from the door, but the fact he was still barking at the woman became clear, for her squeaky voice answered in yells back.
Charlie flipped a leaf and was evenly enthusiastic. "Great, I don't come here too often so it's a treat for me too!"
"Really? I mean I knew that he once said he build the motorcycle to travel but he actually made ,ahh, sort off a starting plan already?"
Just as Harry was about to ask Draco if he minded a break, the bell of the shop rang. Voices filled the front room, voices Harry recognized and he paled considerably. Harry's hands shook so badly, he dropped the needle mid-stitch. Standing up, Harry walked to the door leaving the needle poking out of Draco's back just like that.
Draco stood in total silence for a minute or so, merely staring down at his fallen friend and his mind completely in shambles. "What in the world is happening?" He asked in thin air as the heavy thunder rumbled outside.
He explained a floo ticket, where one essentially buys a list of floo network names and one hops in and out of a series of fireplaces until they exit the last one, close as possible to their chosen destination.
"Well, try better." Draco also stood up and swatted Harry on the back of his head. Harry muttered an ouch without too much heat. It was more or less an automatic response because it hadn't actually hurt. Draco sat back down on the couch. The wand that lay there rolled into the cushions. Absent-mindedly, he put it back in his pocket. "What will happen if the Aurors come and catch us?"
Once finished, he ate a light meal and got ready. He taken a little too much time and suddenly found himself needing to hurry. He planned on a leisure trip to the Ministry but instead went with the floo and hurried through the halls; with mere minutes to spare had his hand on an old boot, ready to be port-keyed away.
"Learned that at Auror training too?"
A bit defeated, Draco looked up when he heard Harry's feet stomping on the steps, realizing that Harry was on the run again. Pretending he didn't hear Harry last sentence, simply because he didn't want too.
"You can come and ask me, and if I'm not there, well," Bernadette gave a sigh. "I gather Mr. Gheata can help you. But I advise you to only do so if it's of immediate concern. Otherwise I'd implore you to wait until the morning when I am back."
"You quit!" Draco yelled slightly frustrated. Harry on the other side glared. "After I finished the door breaking course!"
And Harry sat there, atop of the tower thinking that moment over and he was so angry, felt so helpless. He was wobbling his legs back and forth and screamed. He screamed from the top of his lungs into the dark night "Why are they looking at us with blind eyes?!"
"Ready?" Harry asked Draco who had made himself quite at home on the bed. Not getting an answer, Harry asked again. Draco reacted by making a noncommittal sound.
"What can we do for you?" Silas said a full minute later, giving Harry a moment to gather his wits.
They were loud and screaming over each other to get their question out the loudest in a hopeless attempt to get an answer. Their camera's were flashing and puffed up little clouds of smoke, effectively creating a mist that would ruin the photo's they made. Several quills zoomed around his head, one lost its floating piece of parchment and poked his face instead. It was chaos all around. Harry tried his best to get back on his feet and away from the group he was very close to hexing, where it not, he could not reach his wand by the way they had closed in on him.
"Insisted I shouldn't be her problem and move into a muggle motel, or something."
Harry ducked. Still in Andromeda's reach, he mumbled his apologies before she could tug his ear.
Draco, assigned to hand out the presents, strolled back and from the tree to create four piles. He seemed extremely pleased with his haul, the biggest pile. He received mostly books but also pair of quidditch gloves, and some sweets. Harry briefly wondered how he could stomach those peppermint quills but Draco was delighted. He immediately broke of a piece and popped it in his mouth. With only two gifts left, he made Teddy pick which to open first.
"I'm having my motorcycle exam today." Harry answered and pushed his cup away. "I terrified of failing! What if I haven't studied enough?" He groaned and folded his arms on the table to let his head fall onto. "Is this what exam fright feels like?"
Just suck it up and do your detention and please do, do listen to your teacher. Do as he says, follow your lessons and be good little students. Harry couldn't believe his ears when that was what they were basically told. The headmistress may have said it differently, but, that was what she meant. He knew it.
"But-" Draco started and Harry kissed him. "Forget about it."
"Basically." Harry agreed and pointed at the pieces. "One piece to talk into, it's a microphone and the other piece is a speaker, there comes sound out."
"It'll be a while before anything can be done, the Ministries, which does include the muggle men on top involved to find solutions, meanwhile, we're the last stop in order to save species."
She said when she caught Harry staring and Harry ran a finger along them. "Never, Meda, never. I'd wish.."
"Because," Draco said as he made Harry stand up. "The Aurors were here for this exact reason and I'm fairly sure they are still in the vicinity."
Harry made his way towards the elevators, Draco following and then his shocking blond hair caught the eye of a man in the left group. Given the fact many gave him a berth, it wasn't hard to miss. Suddenly, a dozen or so wands were trained on his face and the right group started flinging spells at the left group. Bystanders ducked away, Aurors were yelling and springing into action while Harry jumped in front of him, arms wide.
The toddler smiled and took the toy, brambling in his own language but surely so, she thought, agreeing with her.
"Thank you," He said and gave it a quick look. "I appreciate it."
It also kept Harry up. He sighed, turned on his other side and once again, the events played by in his head. He thought his first day in Romania was a success and when he realised sleeping just wasn't in the cards for him, he got up. He rummaged through his bag, retrieved a book on magical creatures and sat himself on the lounge chair on the other side of the glass room. The stars above, the fairy lights within along with the candle he found and lit provided him enough light to read. That is were Charlie found him in the morning.
"Well, true enough." Charlie got up, and they left together. "It's good, because tomorrow is my day off, and we have some stuff to do."
"Eat." Andromeda barked and Harry almost flipped his plate in shock. "Once you're plate is empty and you've joined in on our conversation about our Christmas plans, you're allowed to space out as much as you want."
Harry peeked into the box. "What's.."
Harry Potter was sure he'd spend the night tossing and turning, yet sleep came easy. In the morning he woke by the sun glaring down on him. The night before he never closed the drapes. Sitting up, Harry rubbed the grit out of his eyes and fumbled around for his glasses but found a slip of parchment instead. "What's this?" He mumbled, still sleep addled.
Charlie grabbed Harry again, who didn't have the time to put the paper away and made a beeline for the door behind Bernadette's desk but Harry put on the brakes. "What's over there?" He asked, pointing to the other side.
"You and I," Draco moved a finger between the both of them and huffed, as his other hand pushed his hair back in slight frustration. "We need to talk."
"Didn't you train to become an Auror? Surely you must have an inkling more than that."
He froze for a moment, quelling the feel and watched Harry, who didn't answer him. Harry darted through the room again, his breathing growing more erratic and finally ducking underneath the bed. He huddled into himself, hands covering his face and rocking side to side.
"Somewhere at the end of next week, we'll have some time then." Zhanna said, and Harry gladly accepted. He would love to go there again, especially since he requested and expected his broom to arrive soon.
"Off to the Ministry." Harry said shortly. "I don't know what else."
He started lightly when Draco dropped his head on his shoulder but he didn't move away, instead he leaned his own head atop of the blond and swished the blade again and again - never quite enough, never deep enough but it worked. Sort off. If only it could be more.
"Malfoy?" He asked annoyed twenty minutes later and another couple of dozen or so practice movements further.
"I never seen it looking like this, I didn't think it would be so nice!" Harry answered, eyes darting from tree to tree and noting the vast difference in colour and decoration choices. It definitely wasn't coordinated. The chaos just added to the festive sphere.
"So, I misunderstood." Harry mumbled.
"I know," Harry sighed. "I should be able to manage."
"It?" Draco asked.
"At least it's never dull around here." Charlie grinned.
Draco raised an eyebrow and stretched before folding his arms. "They never taught that in Hogwarts."
Immediately frantic, Draco rushed to Harry. Any moment, both Aurors would co e to the same conclusion as he had; Harry being responsible for the sudden storm. When he threw open the door and pulled away the sheets, he saw Harry still in the same spot. Only now, he held an odd stone in one hand and his wand in the other. The runes Draco couldn't decipher on the stone glowed bright and Harry was mumbling.
The place was small. There's the front room, narrow enough that it only took just four steps from the front door to reach the two other doors on the other side. These doors, made of one sided look through glass lead to the backroom and his work space.
Charlie nodded. "It's just a village, everyone knows each other well around here. No other magical settlement close enough to warrant an office." He sat up and shuffled over so he sat in front of Harry. "We barely get any tourists, and the whole town together with the Dragon Sanctuary are behind magical borders. The rare visitor from another magical settlement in Romania comes through the Travellers Inn. So everyone is registered. There's simply no need."
Harry looked it over and shook his head. "These are fine, thank you."
"Its beautiful." Harry breathed.
"But..."
It was a dark night with few stars; the moon was just a strip of silver. The wind blew softly, it was not very cold, but the mist and waves of whisperings in the air made everybody stay inside, except for those two then.
All in all, Christmas was a succes. They all loved their presents and had a fun afternoon in the kitchen. Harry had taken lead, and together they made an elaborate dinner to enjoy.
Draco's left leg, pulled up to have his knee pressed into Harry's back, served as a point to lean his elbow on - his fingers wounded between the messy locks of Harry's hair. His other hand lay just beside Harry's and the pretty knife with crusted blood still on it was still firm in his grip.
Charlie said quarters. What he actually meant was a wooden block hut, affectionately named Peony Patch. The hut the tenth in a line of twelve, on the second row of seven. The paths were sandy and Charlie's home sported the tiniest of front garden and seeing the back of the first row, Harry was quite sure he also owned a back garden, a fairly large one at that.
"You look like death." Draco Malfoy remarked when Harry stepped into the kitchen, holding Teddy freshly washed and dressed on his arm. He gave no reply and settled the toddler into his high chair and moved onto the cabinets, pulling out packs and whatnot to prepare the boy breakfast and getting the coffee machine going.
Coming closer, it was when it hit her. The fresh gush of air in the room made another smell dwell up. A smell that tore through her senses, dragging up that what she had been so vainly trying to forget but the smell, of dusty copper, dirt and human waste was all too clear. It was the smell of death. Something she had wished to never reek again, ever.
Andromeda gave it a fond smile and motioned Harry over to the desk. There we some leather-bound books. Andromeda having made them and still working on some, adding stories and pictures of her little family for Teddy when he would grow older and she might not be there anymore. "I refuse to let anyone forget their childhood tales, Harry. Better to record their lives then have them lost by time."
"I didn't mean to, but I think the situation of me kidnapping you could've been salvaged somehow, but only if you hadn't make me lose the stone then-"
She gave the boy she was talking to a brief moment to gather what she had said before continuing. "Do you understand, Draco? This is serious business. It is that I know what to do, that's what the injection is for. I shot him up with a potion that regulates his heart beatings for about, twenty-four hours. Had I not done that, or had I been too late, we would have had a very dead Savior on our hands. So," Andromeda got up. "Now you know, I expect that, while Harry has the potion running its course, you two will sort out any problems between you and come to a truce, lest I have to ban you from coming here and, or, kicking Harry to the curb. I will not have a repeat of tonight." She glanced once at Harry and back to Draco. "Have I made myself clear?"
"Very well," She made way through the room and retrieved the bottle of wine she had opened up earlier. Then, she waggled a finger at Draco and left the room, stopping when she stood at the beginning of the stairs. "You may grab a blanket out the box, you watch him tonight, see to it, that he is still alive tomorrow morning when I come down."
Harry had sent their presents, along with the presents to the rest of the Weasley clan just the day before. He knew they were falling out, they hadn't written to each other for a month or so by now but regardless, they were still his best friends. Although he had his doubts if that feeling was returned when he received a big box back from the Weasley's, signed by them all, including signed by Fred in spirit but it excluded Ron. It was the first thing Jarry noticed when he checked the card. He was a bit sad about that but the box stood amongst the other presents under the tree. There was a larger pile of presents under the tree then Harry had thought there to be.
Harry dropped his hands in confusion and looking somewhat surprised by Draco's answer but shook his head and tapped his forefinger on his forehead. "Your nuts, D'you know that?"
Oddly enough, Andromeda stepped into her study. Harry and Draco knew that was her space and while they were allowed in, they never did, leaving it and her bedroom for Andromeda to call her own and not to worry about a surprise with anyone stepping in.
Now however, five years later, at the age of twenty-three, he had cut all ties with his wizarding heritage. Well, if he had to speak in truth, that was beside the mind healer he saw once a week, a slight addiction to several sleeping potions and a certain blonde who could but wouldn't leave him alone. A blond named Draco Malfoy, who came to his shop every few days, just to be an annoyance.
"Come on," Andromeda put Teddy down on the baby rug where his toys were. "Play here, presents have to wait for a bit longer, love."
Hearing that, and seeing Charlie so uneasy, Harry took a deep breath, apologised and didn't say much after that.
Most eager he was to bring his set of Auror books and some additional works related to the study, even if, he wasn't accepted and his dream was crushed. Harry still very much wanted to learn all about it just because of his immense interest of everything that enveloped being an Auror. He decided that when he came back, he would look into what directions were possible for him that would draw on the same subjects. In the meantime, he would study ahead and thus the books were first to be packed, just in case.
"Oh, you wouldn't believe what it!" Charlie said, smiling brightly. He set the watering can on the table and began enthusiastically telling. "We have a rather moody dragon on our hands, the Swedish Short-Snout female is close to heat, so went searching for a male and she decided that my mate was too much a bother, and swept him off his broom with her tail."
From there, the plan was a visit to France, visit the wizarding community there for a few days. According to Draco, they had a very large community going and that they could sign up for a tour around Beauxbatons. Harry loved the idea but also made a point of seeing the Eiffel Tower.
"No!"
Harry loved it, soaring through the habitats, feeling hot and cold, being splashed by waved and drops of rain and being hit by bursts of sun. He ducked and dived between trees, the hills and had his feet grace flower fields. He saw dragons, tiny and cute lazing, eating or grappling with each other and occasionally one would fly beside him. He would dance, up and down and around the small creature, a game of tag with no contact or control high up in the air. He loved every minute, every moment and then the sky went coloured, then dark and Charlie, just as reluctant as him, told them it was time to touch down and leave.
"It was your magic that caused this! I told you many times! Do not use magic on them!"
That Christmas morning, they collected in the kitchen for breakfast. None bothered to either dress and fix appearances in any way. Just a lazy morning in nightwear, the table full of luxury foods, coffee and laughter. Nothing prim or proper was important when presents were waiting and they once finished and moved to the living room.
Bernadette Dell'elion tucked an escaping grey curl behind her ear, feeling confused. She was fairly sure potions that burned their lawn shouldn't be there. She thanked Harry for bringing it to her attention and assured him their gardener would be notified. He would see to it. Harry smiled, gave himself a clap on the back for a thing well done and left again.
For a moment, he stared at the single photo frame on the desk as he mused, about how far he had come. Harry had left Hogwarts mere months after the last battle had gone down. He had been haunted by the press, by the entirety of the population and he couldn't just go or be anywhere in peace.
That night, Harry and Draco raced upstairs and cleared the maps out of Andromeda's study. They took them up to their room. Draco grabbed a random map from the box. He made himself comfortable on his bed, ready to study the map from Australia but Harry snatched it from him and put it on a stack. Draco noticed he was making two piles.
She smiled triumphantly and Ron patted her on the back as if to congratulate her on a barb well done. Draco took it as a cue to change tactics.
"You got me an hotel card?" He asked, confused.
Feeling sad, he stepped out the doors of the Ministry and stood atop of the three-step stairs, burying his hands deep in his pockets and chin against his chest, staring at his feet. "Well, that didn't go as planned." He mumbled and sighed.
The chairs scraped over the tile floor, and two pairs of feet were heard thudding up the stairs.
"What?"
Harry looked around and realised the rectangular building was a stable of sorts. On either side small enclosures, their fronts solid glass doors to provide easy yet save means of supervising. Each holding their own clipboard dangling on a rope from the door handle and a small but high folder cabinet right next to the door. Some cabinets drawers stood open and their folders thrown on the tables that stood in odd angles spread across the wide middle path. Large lightbulbs kept the place lit and it was messy - Besides folders and their papers there were also books, quills and other office supplies in abundance were covering every surface. Bags of coal underneath tables or forgotten by doors, bags of dirt too and Harry spotted little packets of seeds he recognized from Professor Sprout use in class on top or beside the dirt bags, some whole and others ripped open, left where it had been done.
"It's.. Not quite right." Draco made a lazy wave at his back. "It needs somewhat else?" He said unsure and wandered about the small space as he softly mused his thoughts out loud. "Another flower? Some swirls; my right shoulder needs to be edged with another colour. I feel some is a little bland, it needs to pop and shine."
One would say he was depressed, another called him insane and yet another thought he needed love and care, or a shrink and meds. He was of opinion he just needed to get away. A breather. Away from attention, from the adoration, from the fame, the hate and from the pain he saw all around and sometimes felt.
He let the thought die on his tongue but Andromeda knew. She gave Harry a hug. "Maybe, one day we gather enough and create one but for now, I have you a different gift."
"Now, what are we going to do?" Draco asked, thinking of the previous options he thought up. It may not be too late to leave the idiot he was friends with behind. Then, he saw Harry. The man definitely was turning his gears, thinking of a plan. He hoped it was a good one. "We don't have all day." Draco hurried him.
Harry winced and self conscious, he looked down at his attire. He'd chosen three quarter pants in a light brown colour and a yellow tee, a cap on his head and he'd taken a handheld camera for picture taking with him. Since it was new, he was afraid to damage it he thought around his neck was the safest bet. Harry flushed, he even sported the enormous bag pack to match. He may have indeed dressed like a tourist but he was so overexcited to leave England for the first time and enjoy a sunny, hot country that his embarrassment was quickly gone and he cheekily said, "Well, I am one. Got to look the part!"
"Ahh.. Shut it." Harry accidentally blurted out, scrambling back upon it immediately with excuses before mumbling that they survived last time falling. Under the impression that the books should be able to handle another fall he picked up a small book and showed it to Draco: "Could it be this one that managed this wreck?"
"Another one.. of what?" Charlie asked who stopped his attempts and turned awkwardly to look at Harry.
Harry turned the book around and discovered it was a travelling guide of sorts, listing all official settlements around the world. "Huh, interesting."
Charlie laughed and told Harry not to worry, she was just stressed at the moment but a rather nice person. "Also, over there," Charlie pointed to someone covered with a cloak in the corner. "That bag of bones is Solomon, Silas' twin. He's the tour guide."
Andromeda's house wasn't big. The garden was immense but the house itself was tiny, especially considering Andromeda's upbringing. The first floor only held an entry with a closet, a small living room and the kitchen.
"Throughout the years, the Sanctuary has build quite the name and every few months or so, we are approached to capture a Dragon creating havoc in some or another country."
Harry worked on Draco's back all morning, only taking a small break to gift a tongue piercing to a twenty-one year old. He turned out to be a quite excited guy who talked so much, it made Harry's job fairly hard to do, if not almost impossible. It was only because Draco, who hadn't bothered to get up from the bed snapping at the guy to shut him up that Harry was able to get the piercing in. When the guy left after paying they both knew much more about him then either men had ever wanted to know. Some people were awkward like that and Harry was gaining a lot of experience with it.
"I can walk myself." Harry sputtered but Charlie gave no heed. He stomped straight through the garden instead of going over the path and didn't seem to mind the loud bang when he threw open the front door.
Then, with Draco's presents unwrapped, it was Harry's turn. Harry liked his gifts very much, even if there weren't that many. The Weasley box came with a new sweater Mrs. Mrs. Weasley made, a tin of fudge and lots of candy from everyone - each with a card from all the family members. Ginny's card was cribbled full in tiny handwriting, and at last she'd asked if she needed to hex her brother.
"Are you alright?" Andromeda asked one night when Harry had come down from bringing Teddy to bed. He was holding a letter he already had read and judging from his face, he wasn't happy. At all.
Harry merely nodded and grabbed his wand, ready to levitate the top row out of the shelf when Draco called for Kreacher; making Harry turn in surprise, having the why question lying on the tip of his tongue. He didn't asked but decided to see instead. With a plop the house elf came in and bowed. "Master, yes?"
"Nothing went wrong, Charles." A gruff voice with a thick, Russian accent barked through the door. "Zhanna is being her ditzy self again. The bleeding woman can't find the key."
"You're very welcome, Dear," She said and added. "Don't mind Charles to much, he's quite excited to have a close friend from home finally visit. He'll tone down the cheer soon, I hope."
"Come back when I'm not here, Malfoy."
Like, how Hermione was throwing herself on her books as if there was nothing left in the world? All she did was studying, learning and then reading some more way past midnight by the lights of a small candle until she fell asleep, using her latest read as a pillow. How she woke up, barely hours later with a cry, brushing her un-kept curls out of her blurry face, the lines of the pages pressed red in her skin and immediately went back, straight to there where she had left off?
He only woke up when he had turned one too many times in the chair and fell out of it. He hit the floor with a thump, the dull sound loud, almost echoing through the room. Dazed, he scrambled up in a sitting position and frantically looked around, his sleep addled mind barely registering that Harry wasn't on the couch anymore. The moment he realized, he almost shouted out for Andromeda in panic, only to realize that, surely, if Harry had moved from the couch, he couldn't be dead, right?
Ginny slapped a hand for her brothers mouth. "He'll be wanted for attempt of breaking the Statue of Secrecy so make sure he'll get those papers."
"Imbicile." Was what Draco snarled at him when he'd finished telling and pointed to the books. "Start getting them out. We'll find the book that made the changes so we can undo them before we end up in actual real life danger and we can't have that. I need to get out of this ruddy chair to hex you before I die!"
"It kind of does though." Harry sighed. "In case you haven't noticed, my magic is out of control and has been since.. Since I defeated Voldemort."
"Here." Harry held out the loose pages and Draco pushed the ones he ripped out in Harry's hands. "You better start learning the counters."
"I know," Harry answered cheekily. "Want to come with?"
"This one is still locked!"
"Doing a magical road trip with muggle vehicles? Like, can we shrink them and apparate? How do wizards travel to other countries? I don't really see magical folks getting onto planes, and then," Harry's mind went into overdrive. "How about passports, and visa, and-"
How she knew, he would never know, but the gift was most appreciated. Harry showed it to Andromeda and Draco, who too, liked it very much. Then, he opened the last gift; Draco's gift. Sure enough he'd given him the book as he said he would but also had given him a small camera. When Harry was studying it in awe, Draco grinned. "Thought a sappy Gryffindor would like to snap some photos to show back home, was I right?"
Draco stood, drew up to his full height and looked at him down his nose, completely ignoring Ginny. "I'll ask, nicely, what brings you here?"
He meticulously went through each item and debated whether or not to bring his supply of quills, ink and parchment but decided against it. He would see what the post office at his destination had to offer and hoped they had some postcards with pretty pictures to send.
"It's not fun though and it might, I don't know, shred you views."
As the weeks went by and the clock slowly ticked time away, Harry started or rather, fell in a pattern where he started to care less and less. In a steady pace, following the ticks, he became less attached - to people, to rhythm, to reality. He became more and more withdrawn from the works of life around him. Slowly but surely he became shallow, a shell of his former self. He lost himself, locked up in the depth's of his own mind where the gruel, the horror and pain stood up front. The longer he went like this, the further he got until there was nothing of him left. Paranoia. Just a broken boy, running, hiding and hurting.
"Whatever I say, this behaviour does not suit an Auror and despite my status, I am still within my rights to complaints about you lot to the Auror department," He shot right back, glaring dangerously. "I don't think you'll like having such a note in your file. It can still affect your job even if it comes from me. A
Draco annoyingly tapped it away and Harry laughed when he saw Draco's hair was messed up. "Me learning to be cultured is the reason you know, I never been out of England, hell, I barely even saw much of England, can't learn without going anywhere you know?!"
Charlie followed Harry. "So still like the outdoors and a challenge, though."
Draco nodded and changed subject.
She was just rooms away from Zacharias Smith, he's being hit, time and time again with face reconstruction and healing spells to undo the damage done by a nameless low ranked Death Eater who left the boy upside down for dead in the mud - his face blown away - the sight of an erupting crater a more pleasant sight.
"Think about it, alright?" The man droned on, already on his way to open up the door of his office to let Harry out. "You can owl me anytime, with any question."
"Well, fine." Draco said, he too, thinking it over for a moment. "Anyway, how interesting and all this may be, dinner is ready and Andy doesn't like to wait."
He knocked on the rickety door and they waited for several minutes. "I don't know what's taking so long," Charlie said, a little confused. "Maybe something is went wrong again, I did let them know we'd stop by."
The constant interrupting was grating on Harry's nerves, here was Draco explaining him important thing and people who had no business with them kept breaking his attention.
"Yea," Harry murmured, "He didn't go back to Hogwarts, obviously, and it turns out that once his parents got sentenced to Azkaban last week, the Manor closed itself because his father," Harry spat the word. "His father refused to sign the deeds over and allow Draco to be head of the family."
"No, it isn't. I don't mind either, it's fine, I'll gladly pay." Harry was quick to answer when he saw that Charlie wasn't very comfortable as he asked it.
"There it is," Charlie showed it to Harry. "Spinach and feta cheese pie, no meat, but oh so good!"
Draco tried to get a grasp on the situation but Harry was shut down completely. It had been a long time since he saw Harry in such a state. It was even longer ago his attacks were so severe and for the live of him, Draco didn't know why. As far as he knew, Harry was, excluding his war crimes, the goody two shoes, ever the law abiding citizen.
He waved the house elf away claiming he was alright and if it wasn't time to start cleaning one thing or another or something. It didn't matter really, so long the elf would leave. As soon as the house elf left, Harry fell back and propped his arms under his head with a heavy sigh. In the freedom of his mind he continued cursing as he looked around for points to start cleaning up his own created chaos for the second time.
Andromeda gave them a disapproving look and dinner ended up being a quiet affair. Andromeda wasn't one who spoke much. She said words of disapproval or encouragement, she prefered to listen, to send the right looks and hug or wiggle a finger when appropriate. The boys held a slow conversation between bites about the maps and some comments from Teddy that nobody understood while she listened, happily and glad to see life go smoothly.
She was about to give both a piece of her mind when Harry turned around. He was pale, shaking and barely still standing. "Andy.. " He squeaked, his hand reaching up to touch his chest. "I don't feel well." Promptly, his eyes rolled back and he tumbled to the floor.
Draco had to fight the pain in his back and the needle pricking him with every odd movement. He would muscle through it. Draco took a deep breath, only opened the door far enough to slid himself through the gap and blocked everything behind him out of sight. One look at the Aurors and Draco inwardly winced but he drew on his fake smile and brought out the best sarcasm. "Aurors Weasley and Weasley," He threw open his arms as if to welcome them then folded them and sat on the edge of the desk, locking his ankles and feigning a relaxed state. The desk was obviously rifled through, Draco noted. The almost full coffee cups they abandoned earlier were put next together on the edge, the picture frame was straightened and the horn from the telephone was off its holder. He ignored it in favor of keeping his eyes on the Aurors.
At that, they rolled, over the weeks, into a routine. Harry would take care of Teddy in the mornings then go to his lessons and spend the rest of the night studying until it was time for Teddy to go to bed. After, he would either continue studying or write to his friends at Hogwarts - Just catching up with some, or arguing with others. Apparently, Hermione still couldn't grasp that Harry hadn't wanted to be locked up in the castle and study for N.E.W.T.S and Ron couldn't accept his best mate had left him to attend alone. He hated being stuck with just his studious girlfriend and no Harry to have fun with.
"It's a crucial part of planning, Harry." Draco exaggerated his name and turned on his heel, beckoning the other to follow him to a cafe nearby. "We have to apply for a muggle and wizard passport at the Ministry's national travel department, it can take up to six weeks, excluding the holiday periods to have them ready for pick up, then we need-"
The mention of baby dragons wiped their conversation almost entirely from Harry's mind. "I'd love to!"
It took a moment for Draco to grab his bearing and when he did, he noticed the room. It, oddly enough, looked very similar to his own living room. A perfect mirror of his own open kitchen installed in the very same corner across the same front door he had, bar the clutter across the surface. The same wooden floor and the same small fireplace but here, instead of sleek dark brown furniture, everything was a mismatch of colours and looking overly comfortable and worn. A broom was mounted on the wall and at once, Draco knew where he was. The broom, a firebolt, he knew all too well was Harry's and so, he was at Harry's place. He scanned the room again, faded red on the walls, books about art everywhere and a snitch floated lazily around a potted plant which stood atop of a rickety dining table for two, it all made sense.
Harry flew over to find it. His voice went more frantic as he tried to explain it but he hadn't spoken all of two words when Draco broke. He shouted. He never shouted but today, he couldn't do anything but to be out of character. "Calm down! I can't deal with this twice in a row, four-eyes!"
The whole of making plans with Draco seemed ridiculously easy. Soon they gathered most of the maps and put them back in the box. A few remained and those were the countries they'd go to first. They decided that, if it all would work out for them and got along, they would revisit the box and continue on a journey together. One of the things that remained was something Harry immediately expressed his delight in was the party boat Sirius had mentioned that runs between England and the Netherland. Draco never one to dismiss a tiny cruise of sorts, they agreed they would go and run through straight for Deutschland. Draco wanted to hit the gas pedal and race along the Autobahn.
Harry didn't know what he was more excited about, seeing the eggs or for a fly, especially when Charlie turned to go further into the Sanctuary instead of out. He dutifully followed Charlie when they went passed the houses, some other building and onto a paved path through grassy fields and hills. They went towards a large one story building that lay way past the main structures and it was a mere dot, so far away were they. Harry silently cursed. If he had known there would be so much walking involved, he had brought some better shoes. Harry ruefully looked at the beaten sneakers on his feet and decided to get some fancy boots like Charlie's soon. He didn't think his sneaker would survive his whole vacation. the main building and the housing block up and down a hill.
Andromeda brandished her wand again, this time to levitate Harry, slowly but surely she made her way back to the house, Draco following her closely. "What is wrong with Potter?" A small bit of fright clear in his curious voice.
"Finish that sentence, Potter," Draco spoke menacingly. "I will hex you until there's nothing left."
"Thank you," Andromeda broke off a square and ate it, offering a piece to Draco who declined. "I never really have it, but once a while it's nice."
"Not yet, dear." Bernadette looked through her notes. "It says here, the gardener gave note he'll do so in the afternoon. He had more pressing matters to take care of."
Harry sighed deeply. He grabbed his coat, thanked the man and bid him farewell. On his way to leaving the building, he already had to dodge several press members, one of which he really, really rather not meet. Rita Skeeter had messed up enough for him in his past, no need to add to the future. The one thing was that, everything being said rang true and he understood the Auror departments choice about him all the more.
