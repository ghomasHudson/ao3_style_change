“Yes, my Lord. A male witch. Powerful in his own right. With him by your side, no one would ever dare stand in your way,” she said smugly.
Neville's brain turned to mush and he could not think. It was blank and he could not discern what to do, so he closed his eyes. But instead of feeling those soft lips before, he felt his forehead touch with Blaise's. He smiled a full-blown smile. He knew that his cheeks might hurt from all his smiling but he did not care. He had his mate with him now and he felt at ease, at last.
“Ok, be safe,” he said that more to Marius than the others which the others seem to notice.
"But how is that possible?" James began to reason.
They all knew the danger and they all remained silent as if processing the knowledge they had just learned. Harry’s eyes kept on looking at Marius, but the human kept on staring down at his lap, watching his knotted hands.
“Even with whatever ward is in place, once I am in it. I can do everything I want!”, she voiced out as the portal grew larger and Orion who seemed unfazed by everything passed through the portal easily. Soon he was followed by those who have the Dark Lord's mark burned in their bodies.
With steeled eyes and a heavy heart, he pierced his hand onto the woman’s heart and ripped it from her body. He could feel the warmth of her heart, the tearing of the flesh, and the slight beating of it before he ripped it clean from her. He watched as the light in the woman’s eyes faded into nothing. He acted perfectly as the onslaught of memories of who he had been while he wasn’t in control came over him like a tidal wave.
“This is now an official Unspeakable business”, Hermione took out a letter from the Head of their department and Robards has a sour look on his face as he tore open the letter and glared.
Theo covered his mouth to chuckle. “You want to skip classes?”
Marius sighed deeply. “I just found out that another werewolf is mates with a vampire.”
Ever since the two woke up from her attacks at the entrance she had already claimed Lucifer as hers, and with the Raven’s capability when Ginny Weasley was about to hit her with an Avada.
To help ease Ron’s troubles, he began to change the topic. “By the way, where is Mione?”
Dumbledore’s eyes were soft as he watched Draco look upon the crest of the members of the Council. Draco’s eyes looked straight at the eyes of Dumbledore as he began to ask, “Why do you have this crest?”
When he could speak without the urge to hit his cousin in the head, he asked, "What exactly happened?”
The Great Hall was as usual filled with students milling about, but there was a sense of tension palpable in the air that some of the higher years could feel as the younger ones enjoyed what was left of their innocent childhood. Harry’s eyes followed Orion’s as he sat down next to the older vampires who were clearly marked. The smirk and grin in their eyes were brimming with mirth and the vampires who remained neutral could feel the Slytherin house about to break into groups.
“Please, Gin”, Luna’s voice shook as she begged Ginny to end her life.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had that image stuck in his head, but something else marred that memory. As he looked at the scene properly, he saw that just by the grass on the ground sat Theodore Nott. His back leaning on the bench near the waist of Marius. Even though he seemed to be concentrated on his reading, he still ruined the perfect image that now Harry memorized in his brain.
Blaise chuckled loudly at the end of the explanation and was easily reprimanded by Neville by a single look. He clamped his mouth shut, but his grin was still evident on his face. "You really shouted at Granger?" He asked.
I am supposed to protect you. I am supposed to keep you safe, not endanger you more! I have to make sure you’re okay! What if Mother comes after you because of that?! I can’t ever forgive myself if she catches you,
Hermione gave a worried look. They might not be close, but they were all on the same side. “Don’t let your guard down.”
Hermione then stood up from her position and she explained to them what they have found.
“Careful brother, I might just slip and kill someone.” His mask slightly broke and he gritted his teeth at his slip, he could feel the smile on her face. “Don’t worry, Brother. I have kept your little secret all this time. Despite your broken bond, you wish to reconnect with him. Quite pathetic of you, but I guess even Mother could make mistakes.”
The room fell into silence almost at the exact second the question flew out of his mouth. A beat and almost in an instant too, Ron's cheeks started flaming, matching his hair somehow. The werewolf's mouth then began vomiting incoherent words, trying to give any form of answer that ended quite miserably.
“If you really wish to cause a change, Orion is the key. Get him to side with you and Slytherin will follow.”
Draco eyed the sleeve of Orion where his mark lie. Orion immediately hid it with his leg.
Orion hugged his cousin. He understood. If it ever came to the point where Draco lost the battle within him… Orion closed his eyes. He had to believe in his cousin now.
Neville was confused when Blaise released him too quickly. He looked back at Hermione, trying to make up on what Blaise meant. Hermione was looking suspicious as well and so she asked.
“I’m sorry for waking you up Beau.”
Harry chuckled before he tugged the sleeve of Marius’s robes to make him sit down in front of him. The werewolf then let out a sincere smile and Marius thought he would love to see that kind of smile directed at him more often.
The flame roared to life and out came Andromeda Black. Her face was as stern as her eyes that darted around the room. All of them stood up in greeting and she dusted off soothe that was surely not on her robes.
The Vampires who were unaffiliated to the Dark Lord made it clear long before that they have no desire to aid them in any more wars. And now they decided to join the play field, suspicious, very suspicious if he might say so. But he didn’t think he no longer had to voice it out as the vampires that stood guard seem to read what was on his mind.
The only truth in his words was that Harry was really pumped with the antidote in his system, but he was sure as hell the poison was already neutralized when he spelled Harry. But he was not going to tell him any of that.
As the three were thinking too hardly, a voice began to tear them away from their thoughts.
The Gryffindor stared at the blonde as he smiled whole-heartedly. He cannot help but look up to him as if he was the moon that soothed and eased the souls and silently, without knowing, lighting up the darkness within people’s hearts with his illuminating light.
“The pseudo-love potion he made did not result to that, I checked it twice and it was not a match. So I took it up to Robards and guess what I found”, the two of them looked at Hermione who looked like she needs more sleep and she just gestured to them later, as she stole Harry’s cup and took a swing from it.
“And your point Mr. Longbottom is?”, Neville stuttered and whe he was about to respond, the grey eyed human answered after he gave a small smile to him.
“Are you going to help us make the potion, Harry?” Marius beamed at him. But when Harry faced him, he looked so withdrawn Marius had never felt so far away from him than ever.
Black curly hair, black eyes and pale skin, Harry released a breath he was holding as he looked at the man that looked like a slightly younger version of Sirius Black. But as soon as he saw the name in the photo,
Draco only spared him a fleeting glance. "Is it not obvious of what I am?"
“No pairing it will be unfair to Nev, you will brew this potion by yourselves”, he smirked when Blaise grunted.
Marius scoffed and spat in return. “She is a witch just like you and yet why—“ he was cut off by the same female that was now looking at him with waves of disgust.
“Tsk. No need to be shy about it Granger.” Then Orion began to walk towards the two, but Hermione stopped him by clasping her hand to his wrist, making Orion glare at her and even bare his fangs. Hermione immediately released her hold on him.
“Really? The Blood Ward has always been all around us all this time and you practically grew up on his Mother’s scent, his scent will be almost identical to—“
“The Dark Lord is now currently sealed, but we all know that soon he will rise again and wreak havoc to the world. Draco—He could help us through his blood, in order to strengthen the Blood Ward that will protect the innocents.”
They also spoke about telling the other adults of their plan, but some decided against it because some of them might not approve of their plan. They knew the risks they were taking and also knew that the knowledge they found out about the Dark Lord was crucial. They debated and came to the conclusion that they would convince the adults
"How did you know of this, Lily?" Albus began to ask.
“I-“, James was cut off from his words when a huge crack appeared on the Blood Ward, he was already prepared to make an order when the clouds dissipated ending the storm.
comments and kudos are well appreciatedXD
The two Aurors looked at one another if they ever felt any magic being casted, especially an anti-apparition ward but finding none, Harry then pointed his wand towards the door to force it open but it did not budge one bit.
A few minutes later, they were followed by Pansy and Neville who seemed to be getting along. But as soon as Neville found Blaise, he sat next to him before nuzzling onto Blaise’s warmth, making the Vampire shared a look with Pansy who just shrugged her shoulders as she sat on the loveseat alone. Ron’s eyes followed her though.
"Prefects! Escort everyone to their common rooms right this instant. No one in or out until this matter is taken care of. Hurry!"
Hermione’s lips are now pursed, but she knew that the Werewolf had a point. “Tell me about the others,” she voiced out to clear away the tension in the room.
“Wait, you found us?”, Hermione released a sigh as she released her hold on Harry’s hand and stood up. Her eyes are serious and she was all business-like that Harry knows this is now work related.
Growing more curious than ever, Marius asked. “What about their other sister? Narcissa?”
She could never forget the scream and the howl that followed when Harry woke only to find Draco gone. His wolf howled into the empty darkness hoping for something, anything to call back at him, only to find nothing.
“Sorry”
“Should we also find the one who bears this signature?” Remus then said and Sirius turned to him.
But Harry was heavy so he used that advantage against Orion and used his claw to swipe at Orion’s stomach. He missed by an inch. Orion jumped back.
Blaise whistled and Neville elbowed him, making him choke.
this chapter is unedited so if there are mistakes feel free to point them out to me
"Now, let's see if I could borrow your body."
“She chose to save everyone,” Hermione replied, her eyes closed as she said so.
“You shouldn’t interfere things that do not concern you.”
“Hermione Granger, soon you will understand that all Dark Witches will always fall to their own path, which is the Darkness. It is you that should wake up from your sweet dreams.” She turned her back at her as she stomped her way to the fireplace. “Cho, come now. I need to fully train you to become High Witch.” She was about to walk away when she saw that Chang didn’t follow her. Andromeda turned her head back to see her standing straight and her eyes filled with defiance.
Draco bit his bottom lip as he let himself cry softly. His voice shook when he tried to reply. “People die around me. People I love and I—“
The room was full of wounded students and others milling about to provide help. Witches continued on healing those injured and he looked around till he saw where Fawkes is at. He rushed to the bird’s direction, only to see the Headmaster breathing so heavily that he could not understand what was currently happening.
Both Orion and Marius snapped their eyes to the doorway, only to see Theo, Pansy, Blaise and Neville.
“Not to be rude or anything but why is an Unspeakable investigating this case?”, Harry asked Hermione and she replied crossing her arms.
Narcissa’s voice was soft, barely a whisper, but the old woman seemed able to hear her.
“I was with Orion when you suddenly rounded on us near the Whomping Willow.”
“Believe me”, Blaise grinned at him and as he left the ingredients at the table he trapsied off to his partner’s side and told him of what Marius said.
“No it is fine Young Clarke, the letter we have sent has been approved by the Headmaster”
(BTW Belated Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year to all)
Orion visibly relaxed at that, but his shoulders were still a bit stiff. “So you did not plan to kill him?”
“Shame. You were still supposed to give life to a few more children using the Tree for spares, but no matter. I guess the twins will be enough, for now.”
“You would betray your friend just for Lestrange?”
As if reading his thoughts, Draco continued his thoughts by voicing it out.
Everyone began talking about possibilities. On the side, seeing them all getting along even for a moment brought a small smile to Marius’ lips. Meanwhile, Harry could not keep his eyes off Marius. It was a good thing Lestrange’s glare had gone when he talked to the others about his own search.
“HAHAHAH the most powerful witch to ever be born gave birth to a boy? She could’ve passed it on had the child been a girl, what a waste!”, she cackled in joy and decided to torture one of her prisoners in celebration. She was already about to pull one of her captives in the cage when she was spiked with an idea.
“You should eat, Marius,” Orion voiced out while he took some food for himself on the table. Vampires can consume foods just like all of them but blood is their main source of sustenance.
“There will be no problem about the tests Professor, but since I need to see Professor McGonagall for my exam later my I borrow five cauldrons?”, Snape’s eyebrows raised at this but ignored it and ordered two students to procure him what he asked.
“Shut up!” Theo and Pansy’s voice boomed again and Blaise sulked at the couch by himself. The duo turned their eyes back on the three, again. Neville knew then he never wanted to be in the bad graces of either of the two ever again.
Professor McGonagall did as she was told. She cast spell after spell of barriers to keep Harry in, preventing him from causing a massacre.
Her daughter approached her slowly. “I have never seen anything like it before, Mother. What is it?” she asked carefully.
McGonagall could not believe what she just heard. She never expected such behavior from Granger of all people, but this was something she couldn’t stop. The Challenge had been said. The only thing they all could do was wait for Chang to either accept or refuse.
Marius headed off to the Room of Requirement as soon as it was already time. He trusted his friends to be there without them meeting up. As soon as he got to the seventh floor with caution, a door began to open in front of him. He pushed the door open, only to find out that he was the last one to get to the room.
Hermione was clearly disappointed at this. She wanted to have at least studied the book where the Dark Lord’s soul used to reside. She was sure there was something about that object and the chains of power that the spirit was telling her. She just did not know what connected the two together.
“My Sire, you forgot to introduce yourself,” she voiced out and the Vampire seemingly just realized this tilted his head.
Hermione’s eyes widened. She had tried for months to destroy the Horcrux they found a year ago, but it only reformed itself proving to be indestructible.
“That Blaise is taking things slow, huh?” she said, bored now as she pouted.
“Sorry, Orion.” And Theo kept on eyeing the dog as it bounced around Pansy to get her attention. The moment Theo had been waiting for has come as the dog noticed Neville, Neville remained meek as if he was showing no hostility on Beau’s territory. The dog seemed to have understood this and left Neville alone, opting to jump on Blaise instead and began licking his face.
“Then why did the Room decide to turn into Narcissa?” Hermione thought it was because they wanted to obtain Narcissa’s Grimoire that the room took the form of her. Apparently not only that.
“So Blaise, would you care to introduce me to your mate?” His eyebrow was raised and Blaise looked at Theo then to Marius. Marius gave him a nod. So he took a breath before answering, “You won’t be going back on this, are you, Orion? Because I swear if you are plan—“ he was stopped by Orion’s voice.
Without further ado I give you this chap! (all remaining mistakes are mine)
“—is weak when your mind whirs to think.”
Hermione was crouching by his side and she seems to be asking him something. But due to the lack of oxygen, everything seemed woozy. When Marius became stable, a new individual had entered the hallway to reach the Divination classroom. She had black hair, tied in a bun and dark brown eyes that looked black in the shadows. Marius noticed the crest on her robes and found out that she was in Slytherin. All eyes snapped to her presence and suddenly Hermione was pointing her hand at the new individual but the said person just gazed at them, starting from him to Hermione, then to Ron and Harry, and finally his assailant.
“How dare you step back upon this land”, a stern but familiar voice was heard and all heads turned to see Minerva McGonagall pointing out her wand upon Bellatrix who had a gleam in her eyes as her lips formed into a wicked smile. The rest of the Professors who were left on the Great Hall now then went to side with Harry and the others, as the other vampires moved on to Bellatrix’s side, no longer fearing to reveal who they are.
“What is? What is wrong?”
Hermione gasped at this.
Bellatrix’s face crumpled into anger and she gritted her teeth. “So, my sister knew when she sealed you.” Bellatrix did not dare continue that sentence as she could feel and know that her Lord nodded.
As they reached Elmore she was already falling to the ground and Ron casted a levitating spell to keep her from crashing to the ground and Harry casted a spell in the direction of a woman whose skin burned.
“Came to visit me, Harry?” she greeted in her squeaky voice.
“I can’t. Mother will kill h—me,“ he stopped his sentence as he realized he was about to touch a corner of his memories that he never wanted to be opened. Marius seemed to have understood this and he then looked down in deep thought.
“War will soon befall the lands and even I don’t think that you would be able to escape it.”
Orion knocked on the door. Severus looked around them before he allowed them in. On a couch by the fireplace, sat another boy. The disillusionment charm fell away as he looked at a boy who looked just like him. The only difference was that the colors of his eyes were each on the opposite eye.
“Even as a human having him in our side would help us keep the Ward intact and stronger”, Remus reasoned out and Harry’s eyebrows perked up at this.
“I am a pureblood despite being born a squib, it makes me age just a bit slower than the usual muggle”, she sipped her tea and gestured them to sit down.
Draco’s breathing was now evening as he slowly regained control of himself. A small smile tugged his lips before he looked up at his cousin.
She entered her room and she stared up at the moon. She felt it, the ringing of the bracelet tightly clamped on her wrist. She easily wiped away her tears as she spelled the door to shut tightly. After that, she sat down in front of a mirror then whispered.
“Really?” Those inquisitive eyes were back on his grey eyes once more. How stubborn and troublesome.
“The lore states that only the heir and those deemed worthy of each of the Chambers could open it. None of us here is a witch.” Pansy gestured.
Marius nodded in understanding and began to carry some of the ingredients as well as they all headed out. Hermione knew there was a reason why Harry did what he did and she would be damned if she didn’t at least try to find out what caused it.
"What brought your sudden visit here?" James asked.
“I see, tell him I will be there in a minute, Thank you Izzy”, Izzy bowed and with a pop she disappeared. Marius took a shower and changed his clothes before going out to meet with Griphook.
"Do you all know the reason for the end of the First Mystic War?", some shook their heads some did not.
“NO!”, some of the other witches began to voice out their protest as some of their classmates began to leave, countless spells were then casted to try and struck down Bellatrix to eliminate the portal.
All of their eyes widened at this, unbelieving.
Luna, within the depths of her mind, was afraid because no matter what she did and chose, her connection with Nymphadora ran deeper than what she had always thought.
“Stand, Elmore”, the old woman stood up without a hitch and she led the woman to her sitting room as she switched off her telly.
They all heard a twisting of the doorknob and the door creaking as if about to split in two.
Hearing that, Harry wanted to join them to spend more time with Marius. Before he could say anything, Orion’s voice stopped him in his tracks.
After he said that, he disappeared. They all knew that he had to be quick on his feet to get to Marius before Harry.
Luna did not deny of this as she fully knew her role in the war. When she was young, it was her own mistake of wandering alone in the forest because that was where she was found. With her Father used as an advantage, she was the perfect puppet and no one could ever expect her to be a pawn.
“Judging from her age here she is now probably a retired Doctor”
“Then—” The gleam in the Dark Lord’s eyes was something that could make up for being unable to take control of Draco fully.
“Woman?”, Hermione’s question was contained with a mix of emotions that he could not comprehend.
Fred smiled and Harry stood up to give him a hug since Ron was indisposed at the moment. The sudden eruption of cheers and wolves creating a circle around Fred was not going unnoticed by the Vampires as well.
She could feel her muscles tensing. Hermione panted when she felt blood trickling from her nose. Her shoulders slumped and her hands leaned into the wooden table. A handkerchief was handed to her.
It wasn’t long after that that the others except Orion began to excuse themselves, saying they have things to do. They were alone again after that and everything seemed to be enveloped in a comfortable silent for a while, that was until the human broke it.
Marius then smiled at her. "Thank you, Luna. I don't really want anyone to know about it."
Hermione couldn’t ask.
A thud from the sword being struck to the ground startled Ron from his thoughts and he watched as golden lights began to glow from the sword and forms runic writings and shapes on the ground and like and an infinity where the two of them stood inside the circles formed.
Barty was a bit pleased by this as well. He chuckled. Bellatrix was scary as hell, but he was glad he was not at the end of that woman’s rage.
“Goodbye, Professor”, flashes of memories, of a girl that smiled and laughed like there is no tomorrow. One who spoke of achieving the impossible and making it into reality now faded into nothing.
“Fiendfyre”
It was his mother who called him next, standing by the door in her simple peach dress that looked so beautiful. Harry turned around, ready to run in her direction when he heard the voice once again.
“What is it?” Remus asked and Albus answered him.
“Am I accepted Headmaster?”, his eyes were wide and Albus smiled at this and he nodded.
“Cissy, you left the perfect gift for my Lord and for that, I will put your body to good use. You don’t have to worry a thing, I will take care of your son.”
“Will do, now, I must get to work”, Hermione replied as she called on the Unspeakables she was with to begin their work. She rushed to cast spell upon spell to figure out how to open the dome.
For a minute he saw a glimpse of someone he knew in the boy but he shook his head, he knew it is not possible. He had given the boy the following potions to brew: Forgetfulness Potion, Sleeping Draught, Shrinking Solution, Draught of Peace and added a Sixth year potion in it, Amortentia, he had not named these potions and allowed the boy to see if he would be able to know when and where one has to brew that specific potion and also he hoped that the child will fail. Hogwarts is no longer safe for humans and Dumbledore’s thought of changing this has caused this child to be like an animal to be fattened for slaughter.
Before Blaise could retort, Theo asked a question to stop the man from babbling again. “What were you two talking about while we were gone?”
“Join me my sisters, let us cleanse this world in order to create a place where we would all have our true freedom.”, Her smile was wicked as she continued on whenever anyone tried to speak up against her their voices would be constricted and they would only cough up due to the pain.
Harry released a heavy sigh as he found no sign of the human. He felt Ron nudge him on the arm and faced his best friend.
“I want you to stay away from Marius.” Harry’s eyes found the Vampire’s right after the words came out of Lestrange’s mouth. He saw nothing but concern written in there so he arched his eyebrow at the vampire, only to have him huff out.
Blaise nodded at her. Neville looked reluctant at letting him go but they all worried that Marius was left unprotected against Harry who was now a crazed wolf.
“See you later, then.”
“Marius Clarke, I just transferred here, a Fifth year but I will be taking up Potions with Sixth years like you”, he said so casually that earned him a chuckle from a the other boy and when he stopped, he grinned at him and Marius saw a spark in his eyes that he could not understand but was soon removed as the other blinked.
"No, I was wrong." Harry sighed and closed his eyes before opening them and continuing. "Because of some unknown reason, Lestrange seemed much more tamed than before. And that you are right, about all your lectures. We may not be able to change our past, so why not make the change we need in the future here in the present?"
“Did you open it?” And Orion nodded before he added, “Don’t touch the object, Marius. It’s vile.”
“Like one would love a brother.”
“Hmph! I thought you were going to leave us some prey to eat.” Barty Crouch voiced out as he transformed from a werewolf to his human form.
Ron was gaping and Harry was shocked of what he heard about the truth regarding Draco Black’s birth. Harry was about to ask Hermione why she kept this from them. But before any of them could continue their discussion, Ron began to blurt out.
Marius rose his eyebrow in question. “When I said that name I meant the constellation.” He waved into the sky where the constellation was and this made Avada look above the sky as well.
When she could finally word something between gritted teeth, Hermione’s voice wavered at first. “Why?” She took a deep breath before she steeled herself and looked at Chang in the eye. “To a witch, her magic is her everything. Her very being. It is what makes her who she is. Yet, how—how could you stomach to drain multiple witches for their magic only leaving them with the average amount of magic!?”
The Weasley only shook his head while Harry just continued on staring.
“I do not know what you mean Headmaster”, then Dumbledore smiled at this before he opened the door. The strong smell of potions assaulted his senses as soon as they entered the room, a dozen of students in pairs were chopping and mixing in their cauldrons. There were no sounds present except for the chopping, bubbling and soft whispers of students, they were all concentrated in their works that they did not notice him nor the Headmaster enter the room.
She watched as the three left the Great Hall. She followed but with one last glance at the Great Hall, she could still see that things that occurred and could feel the magic humming. She was sure she could never look at the Great Hall the same way again.
thanks for the kudos and comments once gain, you guys are amazing
“Our Grandfather married someone from the Black family and since the Black name is never allowed to be forgotten or erased, he took on the name Black as his surname. It was a small thing for him to sacrifice as he would do anything for his mate.” Orion stopped for a while. He looked toward his cousin who looked in deep thought as if figuring out what Orion really wanted to tell him.
“She may be proficient, my Lord, but right now she is still hung up on the concept of mates.”
"Yeah I could use you as a pillow and I won't need a blanket because your warmth is sufficient, but honestly you're sweaty."
Marius flinched noticing it.
The Golden Trio looked at each other in disbelief. Ron grunted and pulled a bit on his hair.
thank you Authlene for editing this chapter
Marius then began to take the book from Pansy’s hand before he said, “Pansy, there is only one way to find out.”
Dumbledore could only nod as he offered the dagger to Sirius who was the closest to Narcissa. Sirius, with trembling hands, gingerly took the dagger that his cousin usually held. He touched the scabbard of the sword and to their astonishment, a hologram of some sort appeared. The hologram showed no face, as a hood carefully obscured it. All of them waited with baited breath to find out what was going to happen but all they heard was a smooth voice.
Five years since the Battle of Hogwarts, life has been good to one Harry Potter, he and Ron had been Auror partners and they are both considered experts in their field, while Hermione Granger was working as an Unspeakable, a high ranking one.
Harry's hand made him turn to look straight into his eyes. Draco saw no fear, nothing but complete and utter trust in him. Harry gave him a gentle smile. “You can do this Draco. Suppress it.”
Orion grinned at the human. "Not much." He flashed his fangs. Clarke shrugged his shoulders at that and thus, they then began brewing the potion, watched by a pair of green eyes here and there.
"Continue, Orion.”
Draco stepped back again and a whimper was emitted by the wolf as he let his hand fall to his side.
He was suddenly called away from his thoughts when Andromeda spoke clearly and he noticed that the only people present are him, Remus, Lady Andromeda, the Headmaster, Hermione and Ron.
The two witches looked at each other before Ginny blurted out.
“I congratulate you, Mr. Clarke”, he stood up and offered his hand for Marius to shake and Marius did so, but then he remembered something.
And by the Gods he did, so he answered by walking through the corridor upon where he would grow the Witch Tree.
Outside of the dome, Harry was watching from his peripheral view Draco and Bellatrix, suddenly stopped their movements. A slash caught his eye and he evaded as quickly as hi reflexes allowed him to.
Marius' eyes widened and even Neville looked horrified at this. Theo had a somber expression on his face as he spoke about this, Blaise tried to calm Neville and Orion's eyes darkened.
His eyes pierced James’ brown eyes before he answered. “Yes. His powers are growing so steadily, but you don’t have to worry about him going anywhere soon.”
“Squeeze your hands to let the blood flow to the engraved words.”
"Because he asked me to."
“Orion?”
feel free to tell me what you guys think:)
and save two lives.”
………..
“I, Hermione Granger, challenge Cho Chang to bestow a suitable punishment to her for her crimes against her fellow Witches.”
He could feel his body slowly losing consciousness as it focused all his energy on his wound. But before he fully passed out, he could hear the others screaming in pain. He could smell the blood and hear the laughter of Barty in the background as he raved about their future Alpha.
Harry never thought that his day off would start of this way, a cold case that has now been re-opened. Though to think they never saw this coming, meaning that whoever was doing this was very smart and very old. If Hermione was right, since the wound from 20 years ago was seemingly the same as the victims they had lately. Or perhaps the perpetrator this time was an imitator or a cult continuing their work now that the Dark Lord is gone.
“Are you telling me that it is possible to change the past, bringing someone back to life?”
“You’re not mad at me for being mates with a Vampire?” His eyes were wide and unbelieving but all Harry did be gave a small smile as he shook his head.
Harry looked down at the petite thing in his arms, his heart beating loudly. His wolf was howling with uncontrolled joy and the happiness he was feeling could stay for days. He stared at his whole world. He inspected the girl in his arms and memorized everything about her. He thinks he could never ever forget how those pale cheeks became tinted with red matching the color of her lips. Those icy blue eyes that reminded Harry of the calmness of the sky, but as he delved deeper into those pools, he could see spots of silver and to him, they looked as if they were sparkling. He was probably smiling like a loon for all he cared but as he tightened his hold upon the girl in his arms, he could care less for what he looked at the moment.
Draco’s eyebrow rose at this as he replied, “Of course.” Ginny looked at Fred who is walking a few paces ahead of them and she cast a silencing charm that only covered up their upper bodies so as to not make it suspicious and to prevent Fred from overhearing them with his heightened senses.
“Is there something wrong, Marius?”
Orion released a sigh he was holding, those silver eyes could slash him any moment but his resolve was also firm. If anyone could hold Marius in a stubborn competition, it had to be him. They were from the same blood after all.
Draco nodded his head.
"I can't consume it anymore," Clarke began brushing his dark locks as if urging him to continue.  "He—he did something to me." He wriggled out of Clarke’s arms, then rolled his sleeves. There was an ugly Dark Mark that now marred his skin. He noted that Clarke’s eyes widened for a second before it disappeared and those silver eyes stared at him in concern. He did not know why he was spouting off his secrets to the human, but there was something in those eyes that compelled him to do so.
“Theo, I think I’m in love”, and Theo wanted to pull his hair out, and Marius laughed loudly.
Chang scoffed at that but something within her shifted, though no one noticed.
“Woah,” Harry voiced out, startled as well.
He could see the werewolf began to realize what he did and without any kind of warning, Harry pounced towards him. Draco activated the traps in reflex, binding chains appeared on the ground when Harry stepped on one of the traps and caught the werewolf easily. The werewolf automatically growled and thrashed, but didn't come any nearer.
“Only those of Black blood and those that the Chamber deems worthy.”
thanks for your comments and kudos..please tell me what you guys think XD
Dumbledore listened seriously, then he looked as if his doubts were confirmed. He folded his hands on the desk. He looked like he was remembering something of the past. The group waited for him to speak. When he did, it was not good news.
Marius let out a smile in reply. “I’m fine, Theo. No need to waste your energy on him.”
She waved her hand and a Fiendfyre with a shape of a snake appeared. She
Most people would’ve shaken in fear, their happiness was eaten away till nothing was ever left. But she was different than any other one of them. She knew she had always been special and so, with a wicked smile on her lips, she tilted her head up to face the faceless monster, the leader of the Dementors.
It had been two years and the Dark Lord’s faction had remained silent as ever. Hermione knew that this was the calm before the upcoming storm. She closed her eyes and she remembered what happened that day as clear as if it was yesterday.
Marius' posture straightened and he pinned them all with his eyes as if telling them to be ashamed of themselves. "I suggest you not judge a being by its race but by who they are and who they want to become. I will not just stand idly while you accuse my friends." With that, he turned his back and headed to the direction of Theo, Blaise, and Neville who was just watching him, as they heard every word.
Theo’s head easily snapped to Hermione’s direction. His eyes were sharp and he looked as if his mind was ignited as he watched Hermione. She did not back down and waited for the vampire to speak.
“NO!”
“As Lady Andromeda had tracked the last remnants of Lady Narcissa magic, we found the old cottage where she and her son seemed to live. This was located on the outskirts of Romania. The only thing we found there was a burned house.”
“Marius?”, the boy then looked to his right to see Harry, Ron, Hermione and members of the Orders arrived.
“I bid you good luck,” and Luna closed her eyes as she felt her real self-waking up now.
“I trust you. I know you will get through this because you are stronger than anything else.”
“Okay, we almost got everything other than the lunar flowers that Neville will be harvesting tomorrow night,” Hermione voiced out as she read the instructions on how to brew the spell.
Something churned from deep within him and he knew that his battle was soon going to start once again and being in Hogwarts would only call upon the forces that would harm those whom he loved. He had faith that with him inside the Blood Ward of Gryffindor, one his mother made, would hold off all that evil and darkness outside and within him.
Blaise sighed at this and he explained. “Our Family is not like the Notts or Parkinsons or Bullstrodes. Our ancestors were bitten, not born, meaning the first Vampire in our Family was bitten but all those who followed are now born vamps. We rooted from the Notts, so we are sired to them. We follow their orders only if they use the rule of blood against us. That is why the bloodlines are very important. Because if you get to control any of the families that Theo said a while ago, you get to control the Families or those that are bitten by them and those born from those bitten ones.”
When he kind of finally got some hope that the torture of those unexplained feelings would stop, he again saw another scene that made his entire body started shaking.
“Honour? You speak of honour when your family is the reason why the once whole pack was split in two”
If his Aunt truly did sever the link of mates from Orion and Fred Weasley, would it be possible to reconnect it?
Harry felt elated when he heard Marius laugh before. There was something so free in it that he could not comprehend. He felt drawn toward the human in a way he knew was wrong. He had a mate and falling for another would just cause them all bad endings. Realizing this, he decided to lock away his growing feelings before it grew out of his control.
“How did you know any of this, Marius?” Theo was sure he had never read anything, nor he had ever known anyone saying something about such potion or grimoire. Thus he eyed Marius with suspicion and a tad bit sharp speculating gaze that would make anyone directed with this gaze crumbled and confessed the truth.
“Draco can handle himself mate”, shouted Ron as he sided up next to him as he backed away from his own opponent. Harry took one look again and nodded at Ron, his eyes glinting and the two attacked simultaneously.
Pansy ignored him and opted to yawn. Orion ignored him as well as he continued walking. Marius shook his head at the duo’s antics while Theo handed Blaise his handkerchief to wipe off some of Beau’s saliva from his face.
"I have always loved a challenge. I could do this until tomorrow. What about you—" She looked down at the pendant that seemed to look up at her and she laughed as she could sense the soul trying to break out.
He made a huge mistake when he looked aup and saw those eyes, those light brown eyes that seemed gold when the sun, touches it. And without him knowing he blurted out. With a fond, loving eyes, full of hope and happiness in them.
Bellatrix’s eyes snapped to the woman’s direction who had tears rolled down her eyes. Bellatrix’s hand fell to her side as she now approached the woman. The voices of the other Centaurs asking her to keep her mouth shut or calling her a traitor was muted to her.
"WAIT!"
“So what is this mate?”, Harry broke the silence and Ron’s munching on his bacons, and Ron swallowed then opened the case file. Harry’s eyes widened at the case file and the photos in them.
“Set me down by the runes.”
“Come on let’s go”, Theo shrugged and began to follow after Marius and Neville at the other direction and Blaise grunted at the lack of response from Theo and just decided to follow him to ask Marius about what happened.
Orion was still feeling weak. The mark branded on his arm stung. Even the food at the Great Hall could not help him. He needed blood freshly from the source, that was what could easily help his body regain back its lost strength from the marking. He tried to question his Father why there was a need for them to be marked when they already gave their loyalty to the Dark Lord.
A few minutes later he then saw the human walk out of the ingredients cabinet along with a Slytherin, Blaise Zabini. His eyes followed them until they both laid out the ingredients to the human’s table and the human whispered something to Zabini that made the Slytherin look confused. Then the human said something then grinned and Zabini grinned back at him, nodded and walked back to his desk with Nott, sharing what the human told him. He wanted to know what he said to Zabini but due to the silencing charms that Professor McGonagall infused in all of the classrooms, their heightened hearing is rendered useless.
Hermione and Marius began to create the potion in silence with a few small talks here and there. Both were startled out of their work when Ron came rushing in, panting.
“Ah Professor, I’m sure you remember in our meeting this early morning, this is Mr. Clarke and he is here to take the needed exams for him to enter in our school.”, Marius kept his head down as he noticed the hungry eyes of the students and he did not dare look up.
Ginny saw that the Phoenix was just overhead of them. She was about to heave a sigh thinking that they have allies coming, but she was surprised when the Phoenix swept down his flames then took over her and Fred and somehow they were now in the Room of Requirement.
please tell me what you guys think, i like hearing your thoughts! thanks once again and see you all in the next chapter!XD
“Wait, so are you telling me that Draco Black was supposed to be born in the middle of the First War?” Hermione looked at him and sighed.
Draco woke up to the sight of the inside of the rune circle he made days after he had felt the effects of the change in his magic and soul. He looked around to search for Beau, only to see the dog walking towards him. His mouth carrying a cloak he was familiar with. He smiled and ruffled Beau’s fur as the dog settled next to him. He leaned slightly to his guardian and he was reminded that soon after he casts the ward, he would leave.
“I—uhm…but..”
Sirius smiled at her he expected nothing less. “What you hold in your hands is the Grimoire that bears the Power of Time. That Grimoire has always been guarded by the Blacks. Some say that you can even travel to the Past, anywhere in the Present, but merely view the Future as it is ever changing.”
, as soon as he entered his office he knew, he saw through the veil of goblin magic, due to his connection with Fawkes. He wanted to ask the child why he was hiding but now he thought that this was for the best.
“Yes, we have a problem”, she headed to one of the windows of her living room and closed off the windows as she then leaned to one of the panels.
Draco bowed respectfully back in return as he then stood up, breathed in, and went out of the room.
"The Sanguis Porta."
“Why are you blocking the way?”
“Harry!” Ron shouted as he stopped Harry’s hand from continually pouring the potion. Harry, slapped awake from his trance, looked at their potion that turned a bright green so far away from its supposed color: dark purple.
The headmaster blinked. That sure wasn't what he expected. "What changed your mind, my boy?"
“Unlike you, Rosier, I am using my brain.”
“I will be fine Izzy”, he smiled at her then she bowed and she popped away with Beau to the address given to her. He checked on his watch and saw that the portkey is about to activate so he held onto it along with his baggage. He felt alone without Beau by his side but he knew he will be fine, then he felt the same pull of a portkey and he closed his eyes.
Barty held onto his thigh and licked the blood from his fingers as his wound healed faster than the average wolf. Harry’s eyes widened at this and Barty smiled. “Unlike you, our wounds heal at a faster rate than you could ever hope for. Soon you will be exhausted while we still stand tall”, he laughed out loud.
Dumbledore had to chuckle at that. “That was smart of you.”
“Well, we expect a promising result, Orion. Welcome to the family and all that shit anyway. Let’s go.” Rosier and the others then left. They headed to their own respective dorms.
“You-you can’t expect me to do that Luna”, tears are now freely falling from Ginny’s eyes.
At that, Marius instantly jumped from his seating position, face painted with disbelief. “What?!”
Chapter 35: Separation
“No it is alright Young Marius it is an honor to meet and be of service”
Orion’s eyes then flashed to Hermione sharply as he began to ask. “What the hell happened in the Chamber?”
“Shut up, Nott!”
i wanna thank my beta, Authlene for everything, i am always grateful to have you as i am sure this ff would have gone south long time ago without your guidance hehe!XD
She kept up the barrier to prevent the Dementors from re-entering the Great Hall while she duelled some of Bellatrix’s guards. Their situation could not have been so much worse than it was supposed to be, but it did. Whatever Bellatrix did to Draco within that dome broke the restraints of Harry to his wolf. The takeover was so quick that instead of all of them focused on the enemy, they were split into two. One group to stop Harry’s rampage and one to defend all of them. No one could blame Harry. If they were in his
A pair of grey eyes suddenly snapped open, accompanied by ragged breathing as a hand clutched tightly the fabric of clothing around the chest; Marius woke up with a start. His lovely dog, Beau, easily noticing his master’s distress, crawled up the bed and sat next to him. The dog nudged him softly with his nose as if asking him what’s wrong, but he ignored it. Instead, he clutched his knees to his chest, remembering the nightmare he had been having ever since that night—the night he lost his mother. Beau nudged him again. This time, he sighed then give the dog a smile. He snuggled Beau’s thick fur, bathing in the softness of it.
Harry could not understand it at first but when he stared at the figure once again he froze where he stood. He felt the aura of the hooded cloaked figure seemed familiar to him and that was when he realized.
“You are afraid. That is proof enough that you did not mean what you did. Many who have done so has walked away from their past, but you. You are living with it. You accepted the wrong that you have done. You are so brave Draco.”
Marius then slowly removed Orion’s hands from his shoulders before folding his arms in front of his chest.
“Blaise, Theo keep your human on a leash, I don’t ever want him near here during nights, I will not be kind to allow him to live a second time”, without hearing a reply from the two as well he left leaving for their common room.
“What do you mean?”, Harry’s eyes furrowed not knowing what Barty was talking about. He watched as the smiling face of the man disappeared and his eyes turned cold.
“Well at least you vampires and werewolves are fast, I’m getting cold here”, he abruptly stopped when he saw a pair of rich blue eyes, but they were cold—dangerous, and yet he could not keep his eyes off him.
“I would need help to locate a chamber here in Hogwarts,” Marius said grimly although his tone held no doubt in it. He was sure that Grimoire was here as well. His Mother had told him so.
“Remus, alert all the others to prepare for any sudden movements”, a single look from his Alpha to Lily to Sirius and he fully understood and began heading to down the pack house to alert the other grown ups.
“I can’t just trust Orion.”
His hands flew to his face immediately as sobbing sounds broke free from his lips.
"Stay here. Open the door only when you deem it alright—" He was stopped when Theo raised one of his hands to stop him and Marius pouted at this.
“Oh my, Marius. Who caused you such unnatural behavior?”
“I see you have found the Heart of the House.”
“Right I’m sorry. I’ll try to talk to her, maybe”, then Hermione smiled at him.
“But you know, ‘Mione. I actually did all of this for you.” Hermione’s eyes widened and the others watched with baited breath, awaiting an explanation as to why she did such a thing.
“I lost someone dear to me years ago; he was just like you Harry, a being full of light. I—I did not have the power to protect him from what happened. I did not have the power and strength to stop myself from what had happened.”
She flicked her wrist and the fire behind Draco dissipated. She turned her back at him to take on one of the crying baby in her arms.
"Uhm…was our pack lands attacked?", his voice was meek full of nervousness and then they all turned their heads toward him looking for reassurance.
“No I will not!” She took back her hand from her brother and glared at Hermione. “Hermione, I have always respected you and I plan on keep doing so in the future. You are indeed suitable to be the High witch, but what I could never understand is why you never help the Dark witches that clearly need your help. Why don’t you ask our fellow Light witches about this incident? It would surely be much better if you asked Professor Snape for some Veritaserum first.” With that, she left the room, not at all caring the conflicted look Hermione gave her, and immediately rushing headed to the infirmary.
“Possession is taking over another body without the permission of the owner. Technically, those two souls will battle over for the control of the body and whoever loses will have their soul destroyed. Never to exist nor reincarnated ever again.”
“It’s beautiful,” whispered Lily. James nodded at her.
Orion began to pace the floor, biting his thumbnail. Harry could not help but be concerned. "I found that out as soon as I could suddenly smell him and feel the magic emanating from him," he stopped pacing and looked up to question Harry more, "but what I could not understand is that why the stench of my mother and sister's magic mingling with his magic."
As soon as Draco got out of the Headmaster’s room, he clutched his head as a headache was beginning to form. His mind flashed back to his earlier conversation with Harry and something inside of him broke once again.
This caught Marius and Orion off-guard as the others stared at them both pointedly.
“Stop fooling me, Lestrange. Why would you publicly declare that he is off-limits then?”
his mind supplied. He could not stop the scream that erupted from him as he slumped to the ground next to Harry, begging him to wake up.
“I memorized all the properties of the Black Family and besides that old cottage has been known to be destroyed, no one will be able to enter but me”
Then she remembered there were only a few records of Narcissa in the History books. She was almost non-existent.
“I-I can’t. I don’t know how. Get out. Get out of the circle now while I could still have little control over it!”
“I love you.”
The first ray of sunshine hit Harry's face who was so happily curled around Draco, his green eyes peeking slightly to see that it was probably now late in the morning. It did not surprise him as they both talked about everything all night long, but he knew there were some things that Draco still couldn't tell him. He was all right with that. He just had to be patient and wait for his mate to open up to him more.
"No. It's my free period but I was going to study—" he did not get to finish his sentence when Harry's female friend cut him off suddenly.
The Great Hall was noisy with its usual chatters as dinner continued on.
I am hoping that you will love this chapter XD
“What does this mean Bellatrix?”, Bellatrix grunted, she needed to find the child quickly before he/she gets to the hands of their enemies, she has no time to be explaining.
She tucked away the stray locks of the blond in his ears as she smiled down at him. Seeing the dark aura appearing and disappearing from his whole body, she fully knew what was currently happening within the mind of the boy.
With the last of her strength she grabbed his face with her bloodied hands and asked him. “Do wish to help him?”
Her daughter’s eyes widened—
“Come on, Marius.”
The wolf hummed in reply. “Yeah?”
Theo shrugged his shoulders. “Seeing as how infatuated Potter is with our Marius, sooner or later we would have to get along.”
Marius' eyebrow rose at this, then he remembered their argument and he released a tired sigh.
Inside the main Conference Room, at one end, sat James, Lily, Sirius and Remus. At the other end were the Vampire Party while Hermione sat at the middle, acting as a mediator.
Orion called his name and Draco could not help but feel a bit apologetic to his cousin. He kneeled down in front of him and looked him straight in the eyes.
Hermione watched as the basilisk followed Luna’s command. She then remembered with just the name.
“We will further talk about this in detail later. For now, tell us what it says.”
“Pansy!” She turned back to look at him, her face flushed. “Tread carefully. You know who how he is with our kind.” Pansy nodded and rushed away as Hermione watched the scene with a confused face.
Harry could not hear any words exchanged between them and Remus suddenly stood by his side along with Ron taking in a defensive position. “This is bad”, Remus voiced out and Harry has never seen Remus this worried in a while.
Ron could feel his friend’s sadness at his every pore. Wanting to be with someone, but that someone is not your mate is hard. It was like betraying what their lives are made of.
“There are a lot of books, Marius. I will help you. We’ll all meet up at Hufflepuff. I’m sure Theo could easily handle the rest.”
"I-I," Neville began, but he was stopped when Blaise suddenly pecked his lips. Neville turned red that it reached the tip of his ears and his mouth was trembling, unable to talk. While Blaise just smiled sweetly at him with adoring eyes.
she thought.
“We will cross that bridge when we get there. Because as much as you are mine, I am yours and no one could ever hope to change that.”
She then traced the markings, her face scrunched up at the words; it spoke of the unity of witches that she knew would never come to be. She could hear the voice of Lucius Malfoy in her mind telling her that despite her being a Black, she could not open it as her body is not hers.
“My name is Ragnok and this is Griphook, he has been managing the Black Family Fortune since the job was passed on to him”, they introduced themselves and Draco bowed in thanks.
Sobs were heard as Pansy cried alongside Orion who cried silently. Her head snuggled on his shoulder, Theo held his hand tighter and Blaise flung his hand on his shoulder patting his back and drawing circles to calm him down.
“And what is that?”
Neville was then handed a parchment where a set of ingredients for a potion were written. As he read them all, his eyes widened as he came to a realization of what exactly the potion for. He looked at Marius with lots of questions in his eyes and Marius sighed in defeat.
Dumbledore’s grip tightened on his hand as his body trembled. Dumbledore shook his head, his breathing was ragged. He looked so worn and Draco could feel it — his life slowly slipping away. Draco held on tight, trying his hardest to think of a spell to counteract or reverse what he did.
“I am Regulus Malfoy.”
Marius came forward before curling himself at one of the couches. “Not long.”
Theodore Nott died in her place, she felt pity for the mated pair, but she also had to keep Luna alive, she was now her everything after all. She had already lost once; never will she allow it to happen again.
“I beg your pardon.” Minerva began to stand up at her full height, fully prepared to duel the Light Witch who insulted her own kind along with her.
When Harry thought that he could finally leave since he needed to meet up with Ron to help him with his new homework, a sudden murmur of a name escaped Marius’ lips that froze Harry to his position. He knew he might be hallucinating or hearing things due to his sudden unusual fixation on the human. But despite its slight chance it truly was his name being called, he sat in front of Marius. He watched his breathing and he once again sighed. He had been doing that a lot lately.
“Marius, for whatever reason are the ingredients of Blood-Replenishing Potions for?”
When she saw how stiff Ron looked, she grinned before taking a step back. She turned her head to Marius who was staring at them with inquisitive eyes which she ignored. "Marius, if you wish to speak to Orion, I think it's best if you approach him after dinner." After saying that, she looked back at the Golden Trio, gave a wink, and walked up the stairs to class.
The air in the Conference Room was heavy. Andromeda sat rigidly. Her thoughts were spiraling in her head. She then turned to the still entwined thread, creating the rune. She stood abruptly that it caused the others to stare at her.
Hermione gasped at this and held Harry’s hand for support.
“Tch, I am sure you covered it up with using Dark magic,” she spat and Penelope flinched at this.
She was caught up in her thoughts but was startled when Nymphadora suddenly spoke to her, her words shocking.
As soon as the name escaped Hermione’s lips, the ghost came out of her stall.
“You have been feeding on Marius?!” Pansy screeched because those morons didn’t want to talk.
“I’m sorry Longbottom”, Neville was taken a back by this and he just looked down especially when Blaise turned to him with a charming smile.
He did not notice how Harry’s eyes widened, body frozen. The werewolf heart’s skipped a beat and he clutched his clothes just above his heart to calm himself. Harry shook his head furiously, all the while chanting,
“Obtain you? I am here to obtain a Grimoire,” Hermione answered, craning her neck everywhere to search for where the voice was coming from.
Orion sat up and was about to explain when he saw furious yellow eyes staring right back at him from behind Marius.
“If I bring you there and Bellatrix will feel the barrier coming alive once again, she will hunt you down,” Dumbledore replied, worried that Draco might be turning reckless. But his following words puzzled Dumbledore so.
Dumbledore could not hide the fact that he was a bit put out by that, but he has no control over it. Draco was free to do as he wished. He was not bound to anything anymore since his mother died. He was no longer startled when the blond began to ask.
With these thoughts in mind, he decided to do everything in his power to find out.
She watched Marius who was plunged into their world, facing it alone, but she shook her head. ‘
“Mind sharing us your theories?” Hermione then began to cut away the tension apparent in the room.
“Not just that,” Orion continued as he sat up and looked at Marius whose face was full of concern. “The barrier of the werewolves will soon break, and when they have killed them all. The muggle world will be next. They will be a feeding ground for all vampires." Orion then closed his eyes and tilted his head back, groaning in despair. “I can’t do it.” His voice lost its hope and he thanked Marius’ silence, hoping that that cousin of his would not try to be involved. He did not deserve to be in a world like this.
Hermione just released a tired sigh and Marius was now out of his Chamber. He wore a warm cloak and wrapped around his neck was a Hufflepuff muffler.
He saw innocence reflected on how Marius slept, how fragile he looked that all Harry wanted to do was to gather him in his arms and never let him go. To keep him there in his protection. He was now wearing a smile as he cautiously, as if Marius would break in one wrong move, brushed the strands of hair that tickled the human's nose and curled them up his ears.
“Hey, Marius. Why do you have such expressions?”
“Yes I remember Mrs. Clarke very well, when she was still a student here her thirst for knowledge was insatiable, that I think she has read all of the books the Hogwarts library could provide her with”, Marius smiled at this.
"Good, I will see you later then, my child."
“Where?”
Harry nodded, his smile growing fonder.
She motioned for the Young Alpha towards Draco’s direction and the boy leaped near Draco’s unconscious figure. The Young Alpha looked hesitant in touching Draco, but he tucked away the stray hair from his face and then carried him.
Orion’s eyes widened at that before a realization came. “Did you know that I can just serve you to my mother any time I want now that I know who you are?” he said smugly.
“Hey”, she smiled at his direction and Ron looked towards his palms sword now gone, he stared as if not knowing what he just did. He turned to Elmore then and asked.
He felt the Headmaster’s eyes watching him and he saw the sparkle in his eyes. He looked around to see that the others were already seated and waiting for him, so he sat down next to Orion who scooted over for him.
“I remember a potion that my Mother mentioned before. It could separate a soul from the body?”, Marius voiced out, unsure.
Marius did not know what to do, so he clutched Lovegood closer to him in hope that her smell is covered by his non-existent scent.
tell me what you guys think?XD
“That is why I told you not to worry!”, she snapped and it made Rabastan clump his mouth shut, he knew not to anger a witch, especially a Black.
There wasn’t a second hesitation as the words danced out of the human’s mouth. “Oh, come on,
Harry sat there, frozen. His time stopped, his body rigid and his wolf howled in despair and rage as if the mere thought of Draco’s death was something he could not imagine. He could not speak. He felt like even his breathing stopped and he was stuck in a loop as he could not comprehend what Draco just voiced out to him.
As they were out of the Great Hall with the rest of the students, Harry then took lead and led the students to the Room of Requirement. Hermione looked around to find where Luna was headed, she could not remove the feeling that something was up with her, despite her betrayal.
She remembered everything before she lost consciousness and she clutched her clothes at what had been done. Nymphadora had successfully infiltrated Hogwarts using her body. She knew that everything would now begin to change.
He clutched his body closer to himself as a shiver ran down his spine. He shook his head thinking it was impossible. He was showing signs of imbalance and he thought deeply at what caused this. All that ran through his mind was the one word that stuck to his mind from the whole sentence that Harry voiced out.
“Later, Granger,” he waved as he then went towards Harry and Marius, Pansy easily fell into step with him.
He looked away after that and sat beside the blond, leaning against the wall. His eyes were dead set trained on the wall without any intent of straying anytime soon.
“I know that if it comes to that choice I don’t want you to choose me over your everything, that’s why I am stealing this choice from you. I don’t want to be your weakness.”
He did not let her finish her statement as he ran down the hallway as fast as he can. He was already near the Hospital Wing that he noticed there were now a lot of students who were out in the hallway. Most of them were higher years and were staring at him weirdly as he carried the unconscious witch.
Theo gave a small smile as he began to gather up food in his plate. The look he gave Marius was absolutely unbearable.
“Ow! Nev!" A whiney voice said and as Neville fully took a peek at who it was, his heart calmed down as he saw Blaise clutching his stomach.
Before he could finish his sentence, Draco suddenly fell forward and straight into Orion who actually hadn’t meant to force his cousin into unconsciousness. He just wished Draco could calm his mind and sleeping seemed like the best idea.
Hermione did the same before she turned to Marius, silently asking what next.
,’ his thoughts shouted back at him as he felt a squeeze within him.
~~~~~~
“The reason why Marius has no scent.”
“What you are doing is a very brave thing Mr. Clarke, though I have to warn you. You are the first human in a few years to be attending this instituition as others decided not to attend this school due to some horrid incidents in the past and your subjects will be quite a lot than the others, will you be ok with that?”
“You dare order me?”, there was a glint of something within her eyes and a gasp escaped Ginny’s mouth and Theo looked up at her only to see horror in her eyes.
CHAPTER 16: The Search
“Be careful, Ginny”, he whispered knowing she could not hear him.
“No”, Harry and Ron thanked the woman for her time and when they were outside of her house a few blocks away now Harry voiced out his thoughts.
But this was not his decision to make, Luna asked her friend to end her life. Theo knows just how much emotional turmoil will that be, if Blaise or Pansy asked him to kill them he doesn’t think he would have the capability of ever doing that. His hands then fell to his sides, and then he felt a shiver ran up to his spine. He tentatively turned his head to meet the grievous eyes of Ravenclaw’s familiar, Lucifer staring right at him.
“Are you trying to make an enemy out of the whole school Marius?" Theo chided.
“Is the pattern that way?” he said as he finished tracing the pattern at Theo’s palm.
“Albus,” Lily stood. She went over to give the older man a hug. The Alpha followed his wife action by giving Albus a handshake.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come along, my dear, your Portkey awaits.” He then began to walk away along with Lyra who followed him.
Minerva coughed, getting their attention. “It was an honor to meet you, Miss Lyra, and thank you for what you have done for Hogwarts.” She just smiled at her as if it was nothing and before Minerva could even voice out, questions Dumbledore then began to steer Lyra away.
“What do you see Bellatrix?”, asked a man in the mirror his face obscured to a woman who has messy hair and is currently looking at a pool of blood created by an already dead man hanging on the ceiling his blood still flowing to the marble floor. The woman suddenly cackled, her laughter bringing a sudden chill to the other humans in their cages and making them flinch further away from her. Her shadows casted by the black candles made her much more devilish.
“AH!” Blaise’s voice suddenly echoed through the whole room. Within seconds, he was pulling Neville away from Pansy. “Pansy! I am the only one who is allowed to do that to Nev! Go to Orion or something.” He shoved the woman away before welcoming himself on the seat between Pansy and Neville.
“Wait, how did you know?” Orion asked the Headmaster, only to have him smile at him and point at Fawkes who was near his desk, perched up watching them all. Orion just sighed and slumped at one of the chairs, his head rested on his hands as they were clasped together on his knees. “You could’ve at least warned me about this, Draco.”
unedited
“Orion, we are in this together, okay?” Pansy said as she hugged the life out of the vampire. “You can’t hide if your burden gets heavy. Please let us help you carry them.” She held the vampire’s cheeks in her hand as her eyes went glassy, unshed tears appearing.
Looking down at Beau whose tongue was lolling out of his mouth, he spoke. “Stay here. I just need some air.” He patted the dog who seemed to have calmed down better than he did.
“Beau, a friend of mine is coming here to visit so be good okay?” he ruffled his dog’s fur after he was already fully clothed. Beau whined for a bit, but he seemed to have understood him. He was wearing a white shirt over it is his cloak and black pants. He then took Orion’s school robes that he forgot to give back before he went out.
Dumbledore was cut away from his musings as he then stared up at Draco’s eyes and gestured for him to continue.
"You have no right to..." He could not speak all of a sudden so he opted to weakly glare at Draco.
It has been two days since Neville met with Marius and he was contemplating on what happened. An owl hooted loudly at the Great Hall, which caused some of the others to look where it will land. The Gryffindors looked at Neville when it landed right in front of him, putting down his utensils on his plate he gently removed the letter from the owl’s leg, then the owl suddenly flew away when he was about to take the other letter as well.
“Damn you AGRAVAIN!”, its head snapped to Ron’s direction.
Ginny glared at her, then turned to Harry and Ron, before looking back to Hermione. “Until how long are you going to be blindly believing that all Light Witches are good?”
"I knew that I could never escape your sharp eyes no matter how I hide, but I can't drop the glamour yet since it was usually set for a few more minutes. It's like a Polyjuice Potion," he explained and grinned up at the Potion's Professor.
Orion sat down at one of the single seater couches and settled himself comfortably. Marius sat at the seat next to Pansy and immediately Pansy let her head fall to Marius’ lap. Neville watched the reaction of Orion from this and he noticed that he did not flinch at all. Gaining the courage to ask, he directed his question to Orion. “Uhm, aren’t you mates?”
Dumbledore gave him his handkerchief before Draco used his sleeves again. "He sucked you dry."
“Why, you are feeling old already Aunt?”, a look of surprise bloomed from her face as she laughed loudly stopping her from casting another spell directed at him. He took this chance to fire a spell at her but another Dementor just blocked his spell.
"Why is it that the more I try to stay away from you, the more I feel drawn to you?"
“We had no choice! As soon as we entered there, we did not know that we were going to be tested!”
“Snape is not a horrible teacher but he sometimes leave us to our own devices too much”, Theo said to no one as he too rested on one of the seats.
The barrier around them dissipated and the room returned to its usual size. She looked down at a subdued Chang as she then began to speak.
Harry turned to him, confused attached on his face.
“I am going to research more on about the souls in the library. You two,” Hermione pointed at the werewolves, “are coming with me.” She then turned to Orion. “I will inform you if we ever find something. Oh, and tell Marius we will begin our brewing tomorrow after classes.”
Ron then procured the photo from his pocket and Ms. Elmore’s eyes widened as she placed down her cup, she released a sigh.
They all watched closely as Andromeda wordlessly casted a spell that would reveal to them who it belongs to. The vial sparked and broke until a thin silver thread entwined with black appeared. It floated at first then it began to form a rune. Andromeda’s eyes widened along with Penelope and Sirius.
"But those grimoires were lost, hidden by our ancestors never to be found. It is said to bring nothing but death and destruction in its wake but also happiness and peace in the right hands. It seems like they have been awakened." Sirius remained silent as the others took in the information given to them.
“When did—“ Fred began.
“I will alert the others at Ravenclaw”, she said and she handed back the letter to Harry and Harry tried to hand it to a sulking Ron hugging a pillow he did not see he was holding on a while ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That is admirable of you”, Theo’s eyes were bright as they stared at Ginny’s own and she could not stop the flush that run up to her face. In order to hide it she looked away and she could not stop her voice when she stuttered.
“Clean up this mess”, she said as she left the room now bloodied and full of cadavers.
He was so worried—no,
He looked at her and saw that she was successful as the witch was holding on to the Grimoire that he once saw long before it was sealed. He felt a bit envious as that Grimoire was supposed to be his, the remaining memory of his mother. But he shook his thoughts. He had no need for things to remind him of his mother as he had her in his heart always and that was the most important.
“Huh? We are related to the Longbottom’s?” Draco blinked. He never really cared much about his grandparents as all he knew was that they were already dead, so it was quite a shock to suddenly know that.
Severus' eyebrow rose at this confused as he thought hard. He knew just how much Orion despises his parents for what they did to him, cutting him off from his mate. Then his eyes widened slightly at the word
even, than the worst wrecked winter. "
Harry’s eyes widened when he saw the fear in Draco’s eyes and obliged. He laid down next to Draco and the blonde snuggled up to him easily.
“He reminds me of you.”
No, he would not allow it. He knew the feeling of being betrayed more than anyone else and he would never ever wish it for his cousin. He would not care even if he and Potter would not get along with how Orion would pull Marius away from him. He would protect his cousin no matter what.
“What do you want from us?”
“Sirius told me about him before, he told me that his brother changed and that he regretted not taking him with him when he left the Black household”, Hermione offered him support by placing one of her hand to his shoulder and giving it a squeeze.
“Did something interesting happen?” Blaise teased in a lieu of greeting. “Marius looks a bit red.”
“Izzy, is a former Black now a Clarke elf, she is now yours. Izzy bring Young Marius to one of the guest rooms please”
The form of the woman changed then. Black curly hair now cascaded instead of blonde and her dress turned blue along with her eyes. The pale skin did not change though. And now Marius was looking at the true form to the magic inside the Chamber. He was face to face with Rowena Ravenclaw herself.
They all headed to the Room of Requirement. The tension was gone while they were on the way there. As soon as the door appeared, Marius hurriedly pushed Neville inside the room and Theo did the same to Blaise. Neville squeaked at this, especially when he noticed the door was already closed. Since Marius was the one who conjured it, he and Blaise couldn't open it.
Orion grinned at that. “Have I ever?”
"Why'd you defend him when to all of you blood suckers you refer to them as livestock?" Ron snapped at Pansy.
“We allowed you to be, well, what do you call this acquaintance with them? But, this human? What do you plan on doing with him?” Rosier’s fangs were out as he grinned at Orion’s direction.
thank you for all the comments you all left me and the kudos as well..i am very grateful and happy you liked my story XD
Orion then walked silently like the wind itself. He ignored Granger and as soon as he was in front of Harry and Marius, his blue eyes were met by emerald eyes, glaring at him. Harry looked like he had tons of things to say to him but Orion then placed his forefinger to his lips, signaling for Harry to shut his mouth. Harry gritted his teeth but didn't say anything, but seeing that Harry followed his order, this made a smug grin crawl up Orion's lips.
Harry was a bit too late to avoid a hand that came into contact with his shoulder to abruptly shake him. He was, at least, very quick to send a heated glare to the offending hand’s owner.
"How?" Remus asked.
“Hey, Harry,” he called carefully.
“You’re my mate,” she said breathlessly and the silhouette nodded. Ginny wanted to run up to him but she could see that he was just an illusion of the room. Then, her defenses were up again. Her eyes turned serious and the man as if amused by her actions raised both hands.
“Nothing. I thought I smelled someone,” the vampire said after that.
"I guess you are younger than me that's why you can't still feel the connection between us." The werewolf tentatively took Draco's much smaller hands in his and clasped them together. "But I could feel it. Your scent calls upon me and from the moment I saw you, I already knew you are mine"
Minerva McGonagall waited in front of the huge doors of the Great Hall for Dumbledore. She was baffled as to why the Headmaster would call upon her alone at this time of the night. But knowing that odd, unpredictable vampire, she just stood by and waited. Soon she heard clicks of two pairs of shoes which made her raise an eyebrow as she was not informed of another person coming along. She waited until the two figures came into one of the torches of light in the hall.
Marius just silently comforted his cousin as his mind raged on possibilities of what he could do to help.
“She chose to give birth after the Dark Lord was no more, but there are consequences of her actions. Time was not to be trifled with. In exchange for it, her life span was cut down and her magic weakened, that she was merely only able to seal the monster but not cut it down. She never regretted it for a moment as her child was her joy, her happiness, her everything. Her life. I am the last bit of her magic that remained before she sealed away her Grimoire in this Chamber.”
Marius opened the door to the Hufflepuff common room and gestured for all of them to follow him. As soon as Orion entered the room, his face was engulfed by a furry dog. Blaise began laughing at this along with Pansy. Neville tried to bite back his laugh, while Theo was mesmerized by the dog.
Orion stood up, agreeing to Harry. That was then that Harry realized something. "You knew he was leaving after the potion was done." The realization hit Harry hard. It stung that Orion knew of this longer than he did, but he could no longer argue at anything. For now, they had to protect Draco.
Draco was cautious not to hurt Harry and it seems like Harry was putting this to his advantage as he began to dash in his direction, again. Draco flicked his right hand to attack and cover up his way out, but Harry tore through it easily.
James looked up at Remus and it seemed like they both agreed about something as James began to speak. "No one must know about this. We will continue the search as to not draw any suspicions, but we will make sure that if anything happens those sent to search could return back here immediately. He has the Werewolves protection should he ever need it."
Remus bowed his head and began to head out. But before he could get anywhere, a figure came running up at them, one with red hair.
He watched as the fire erupted, took the form of a wolf and burned his home, he did not linger anymore, so he picked up Beau’s leash and began to pull him away from the huge fire that he created. His eyes turning back to their original shade of grey as he looked away. He performed his first and final act of magic, it gave him a sense of comfort and fear he could not comprehend. He clamped up his emotions, its time to walk away.
Sirius turned his head back to her exasperated.  “I have told you the same thing I told everyone at the conference ages ago.” He scratched his nape and took a seat at the chair just across her.
“We’re here,” Orion stated as he opened the door to the Hufflepuff Common Room. Harry did not realize that the Hufflepuff dorms were this close to the kitchens. He went inside to see the whole room decorated with black and orange the color that signifies the Hufflepuffs. He then felt something wet touching his hand and he looked down only to see a huge dog lolling its tongue at him.
“How is our Lord, Bella?”
“I can’t believe you Ginny. You are actually buying what he said? There is in no way that Light witches would do such a thing!” she argued.
Albus Dumbledore assured that all of Hogwarts occupants would be asleep other than him, Minerva and Draco. The new recreation of the wards was going to be cast for tonight and he was anxious. He understood so little about the Prophecy that Narcissa whispered upon them when the Blood ward of Gryffindor lands was renewed to its former strength.
“Uh I-I’ ll j-just g-go”, Neville stuttered a reply, he did not think that any one would be outside of the Great Hall when everyone is currently having dinner, so he was pretty astounded when he saw Zabini and Nott.
“It is possible unless he is a child born with magic.” Dumbledore’s eyes glazed over at Marius but soon looked away.
“Remnants of my nephew’s light magic, the last of it anyway,” she looked down at her unconscious nephew who was being held by the Young Alpha.
During their Potions class—the only class he had with Marius, Harry’s head was filled with questions about how to approach the human so he could finally apologize for what he said last time. They were going to brew a new potion since the Polyjuice Potion needed more time before putting in the next ingredient. Harry was planning to be his partner but his chance was taken away when Marius sat next to Longbottom, apparently still ignoring his very existence. That was why Harry was then stuck with his usual partner Ron. Not that he hated it but more so than the other days, Ron’s brain seemed to have truly melted as he was still in shock of what happened over breakfast.
She clasped back the necklace then she glanced down the rabbit hole to the Chamber. She flicked the blonde hair. Looking back to make sure that the spell she cast would not be broken, she fell back.
“I saw something in that Chamber. Do you have any idea on what it might mean?”
“The Dark Lord wouldn’t be able to possess them even if he were to try.” Draco’s eyes snapped from the Tree’s bark to Severus in an instant. “You have every right to be furious at me, for what I have done. But I changed the properties of the Potion used to grow the tree.”
Betaed by Luneath, thank you always.
Luna walked back to see what it was that she saw, only to have a gasp emanate from her as she covered her mouth. She looked back and there he was, standing with a small smile gracing his features. Then with trembling hands, she held up her hands to touch her Father's cheek only to find out that he was real. Then without any more words, she hugged her Father with all her might, a strained sob being released from her lips as she snuggled her head into his chest.
“Who are you?” she asked cautiously.
Before anyone could make a move Orion stood in front of Marius and held both of his cheeks with his hands, Marius—no,
Once they were all out, Marius began waving them goodbye. He was ready to turn around when suddenly Theo held the neckline of Marius’ shirt, preventing him from moving.
Another blink. Lost,
Blaise whistled. “Wow, since when?” he said to no one but himself and Harry’s head snapped to his direction. The vampire just gave him a grin before he spoke again. “Careful there, Potter. That is our Marius.”
Sirius could not stop but protest even though in his mind he knew that Draco would be safer away from them right now. So he resigned and decided to just meet the boy when this was all over.
"Percy, is there something wrong?" Remus asked Percy Weasley.
. You are not so bad after all," he teased.
“We know you might feel suspicious about our behaviour, knowing our previous animosities toward each other way before this war. If our situations were reversed, we would also feel the same,” Pansy explained.
, and when she got mad at him for playing too much in the rain that he was soaked and got sick the next day that he could not even go anywhere without her helping him up.
“Uhm… can I come in?”
Draco closed his eyes as memories of that day flashed to his eyes, the smell of blood and magic and death. Harry just clutched him tighter as if to anchor him to the present where he was. He listened carefully to what Draco was sharing, despite the flare of jealousy that burned within him.
Bellatrix held the woman’s chin in her hand as she asked, her eyes dark and malicious. “You know something I know and something I don’t.” She smiled sweetly at the Centaur but within those black eyes, anyone could only see death in them. “Tell me and I will spare.”
He along with Blaise and Theo was astounded by the look of the room, every nook and cranny was the exact same as their Potion’s classroom.
“Uhm..Marius why are we here at the Seventh Floor?”, asked Neville and he felt Blaise’s eyes on him and he made himself look even smaller and Blaise noticed this and huffed.
Harry merely tilted his head towards Marius’ direction where two witches were on their way towards them.
Dumbledore looked at him keenly and saw a bit of Severus in the child. He who also remained loyal to the Order but decided to be a spy in order for the vampires to be able to escape from being controlled by the Dark Lord.
“I’m Blaise by the way. Blaise Zabini”, he said as he offered his hand to Marius and he shook it.
Orion’s eyes widened at this. He sat up to hold on to the shoulders of Draco. It was slightly too hard, but Draco found it endearing instead.
“We are here to propose an alliance.”
He was prepared to tell them all that their search is over before it even began but if they intend to merely use that child then he is better lost than found. If they desire that child’s help and protection by his blood they have to earn it by knowing him, by accepting him not by his use but by who he really is and respect his decision and not make it for him.
As still as he could, Harry held his breath.
"What is going on here Flint?"
"Hmm…" the intruder then hummed. She gazed at Marius with a tilted head.
Marius shook his head and replied, “He is in a place where no one could find him, even I.”
The Headmaster's eyes twinkled and Severus was growing irate at his manners.
He changed the topic instead. “Why are you here, anyway?”
Bellatrix Lestrange finally reached her destination. The crack of Apparition was heard as her protégé arrived after her. Her eyes snapped to see the land where her sister used to live, only to see the cottage burnt to the ground.
He knew that he had to hasten himself for what was about to come. He had to figure out what Bellatrix did to his Corvus. But, God, he prayed—he prayed for time to stand still to just give him this moment to just be with them, to hold them.
"Tea?" Dumbledore merely asked and he could clearly feel the irritation seeping off Severus' in waves.
Orion turned to Marius. His cousin nodded. “I have seen too much of the horror that my family has done and I would never wish that for anyone. I want to protect those that are dear to me,” he explained truthfully.
The day began to fade away, and in the deep part of the castle, Luna once again stood in front of the sculpted face of Salazar Slytherin. Her bracelet once again enlarged into a huge circle in the ground, shuffling was heard from behind her.
“Protect Harry and leave this to me. All you have to do is trust me and close your eyes. Please, let me do this.”
“Well, actually I was sitting next to Orion, but came to sit with Theo to ask him to teach me about some Vampire traditions I was hard up in explaining for my essay to Professor McGonagall.” He looked at Snape with that sheepish smile of his once more and the Professor yielded, though reluctantly.
Sighing in defeat, Hermione walked away and decided to investigate things much more closely next time. She had never felt this blind. Things were happening around Ravenclaw without her knowing and she felt like she had failed as a leader. Her hands clutched tightly the Invisibility Cloak as she walked away, her mind deep in thought that she suddenly bumped into someone.
“You have no right to speak, Dark Witch. You must’ve tainted your students to push Cho to do such acts, didn’t you?”
Draco's eyes snapped to find where the Phoenix was but he remembered this was not really the Headmaster’s Office, so he looked up into the sparkling eyes of Dumbledore.
“Good morning, Marius.” Pansy approached him and handed him his bag while Blaise was being licked to the ground by Beau as Pansy commanded. Theo and Orion stood up already and was waiting for them by the door. As soon as they saw Marius ready, they then began to head out.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, a shared smile etched on their features.
He could not stop the tears that fell from his eyes to the cheeks of his twin children. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I could not bring you up in a better world. But never doubt that as long as I live, I will protect you and never ever forget that I will always always love you both, no matter what.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“They didn’t find him did he?”
As she looked into Draco’s eyes, she knew that he would not answer her. She just grinned and released him, seeing the chains settle and assuring that the binding spell was complete. She looked back at the Witch Tree now burning and her gaze fell to Draco as she voiced out. “So that was your aim.”
“Seriously, though, since when did you become a love expert?”
And as she invoked her true name something began to materialize to her right hand and she began pulling out a sword from its scabbard and she held it up the sharp blade pointed above.
Draco sat at one of the many branches of the Whomping Willow, looking up at the sky as he waited for the first signs of snow. He huffed out a breath he was holding and the puff of air he released could be seen visibly due to the cold. He no longer tugged on his cloak as he could feel his magic warming him up still. He closed his eyes at the feel of the wind on his cheek, counting down the minutes until the glamour feel away and he would be back to his normal body.
He looked toward the Alpha he was born to kill and all he sees within those eyes are nothing but the eyes of a pure wolf, desperate, rage, and the full need to protect. He watched as the blond within the dome break and he felt something within him broke as well. Soon the Dementors began to suck everything out of the huge black wolf, he released a breath.
Hermione was then taken a back—was that Lestrange’s attempt at a joke? Or was he implying something else?
“You could not accept the fact that he was not yours, and my dear all Black children born with Dark magic are always cursed to destroy, hurt and kill those they held dear”
“Why did you do it?” Hermione’s eyes were sad.
Two tiny hands reached up to hold his cheeks, two pairs of eyes stared up at him wide. He could not help but to hug them closer to him as he felt as if he was being forgiven. He held onto them tight as he knew they would soon be taken away from him. He was sure by now Bellatrix know about them. She would come for them. Draco could no longer play as the puppet. He held those two bundles in his arms and swore that he would fight anyone just to assure that they get out of this place safely.
Theo let out a soft sigh. “You are so thoughtful Marius, but some things are just hard to change.”
Albus closed his eyes and shook his head. "Forgive me, Lily, but even I, their appointed leader, could not persuade them. You know that we follow only one leader." The rest remain unsaid as they all knew the reason why the Order, one of the largest neutral coven of Vampires, did not wish to join the war.
He was baffled as to which was the true Prophecy. But between the two, there was a huge difference. One spoke of the Dark Lord's bane and another child while the other only spoke about the Dark Lord's bane.
A small chuckle escaped Marius almost unconsciously, followed by a small, sincere smile. “You’re horrible,
He was already slumped on the ground. Two hands was holding on to his shoulder and all he could hear was the pumping of Clarke’s blood everywhere. Then he heard a voice full of worry. There was no fear and Orion almost laughed at this but he could not. If he did not stay away now, he would be ripping this human to shreds and bleeding him dry.
Meanwhile, Dumbledore looked at the small shoulders of Draco as he walked away towards the exit. He remembered those piercing silver eyes that looked at him. He closed his eyes once again as a tear escaped his eyes.
Memories flash through her eyes as moments spend with the blonde girl fresh in her memory. But then, to have the capability to control that snake, she could have never have expected it. No one did. To think that she would be a witch and not a vampire.
"Come on." He pulled them and left the Golden Trio who were stunned, mouths agape.
“You are right Lady Ephira.” He then quirked up an amused smile as he introduced himself.
Marius held up his hand to stop Harry’s tirade of questions and allow him to continue. The werewolf seemed reluctant but he allowed Marius to do so.
do what I say. Now. I don’t want you dying on me or killing anyone!”
“I was about to procure something there, and lo behold what I found. A village drenched in fire and blood and ash. I searched far and wide to seek the witch capable of such a thing, behold my surprise when I felt the same signature of magic now that I met you”
“You are born the seventh witch of the seventh generation of your Mother’s family,” Narcissa just voiced out as Ginny pointed her wand at her direction.
thank you all guys for leaving comments, kudos and OMG! 209 kudos!! 49 comments!! 30 bookmarks!! 113 subscriptions!!and 2865 hits!! i cant believe it!! thank you for loving this story as i did writing it, thank you a bunch you guys are super awesome
If he could he would have asked Hermione to allow him to see his Mother’s Grimoire. But he knew that would lead to all sorts of red flags he would rather not answer, as he is intent on keeping his identity still hidden despite trusting those around him. He knew that they might be tortured for that kind of information.
“I can explain,” said the human stiffly. Neville yielded to those gray eyes as he nodded and allowed Marius to explain. “Orion can’t consume blood unless it is from the source. It was because of the Dark Mark.”
"We were actually in the midst of opening one of Hogwarts secrets; the Chamber known to have been created by Rowena Ravenclaw.” Ginny’s face was painted with shock within a second and Luna’s eyes widened slightly upon hearing what Marius had said.
“Come back to me.” And with what seemed to be like a howl from the dog, Draco was apparated to the Room of Requirement.
“The worst part of it was that in some twisted way— I liked it.”
“Rabastan”, she began then turned to the mirror.
“How could you not tell me?”, she knew her questions would all go unanswered now. Her tears dropped to his cheek and he was so cold, so cold to Ginny. She did not know what to do.
“I am glad you are awake, Mr. Potter”, she left his bedside to head to his bed foot as she took the clip with his records in them. “Mr. Weasley is still unconscious I just checked on him”
“But—“
All eyes then were directed to Ron as he stood up, his features looking serious.
“What do you know of what happened?”, his eyes were steeled.
Orion reached the entrance to the Great Hall in record time and he saw his friends waiting for him there. Pansy kept on checking her nails, Theo was leaning on the wall while Blaise was nowhere to be found and as soon as Marius' eyes saw him, he had a grim look on his features that brought warning signs to his head.
“What would you want us to do?”, he stood firm, unwavering and with determination in his green eyes that it sparkled in the light of the fire.
"You agreed to this? Their plan?" James then asked the old vampire, looking straight into his eyes.
Her eyes then darted to Marius as if she knew something that they didn’t. The human was about to ask what’s wrong when her eyes suddenly drooped shut and she was unconscious once more.
James stood up to shake the Vampire’s offered hand. “I hope so as well, Sire of the Vampires.”
In the end, he decided someone had to push the conversation going. Harry seemed to be content wallowing in silence and that wasn’t how you should solve a problem.
“Thank you.” Harry’s eyes were determined as he took in a breath and he began.
Ron looked about to puke as the scent of owl droppings assaulted his senses but he tried his best to look alright as he used his muffler to cover up his nose. Marius noticed this expression on Harry as well but he lacked a muffler to cover his nose and he was only using his hand, which is not helpful. That was why Marius took out a handkerchief and nudged it onto Harry. The werewolf gave him an expression of thanks as he took it. Marius went looking around as well for anything.
Before she could ask questions, the Vampire then turned to James, flanked by Severus. “I hope you will accept our offer, Alpha James Potter.”
“Shut up Padma. I can handle this.”
"You called for me, Mother?" She looked up to the flickered image of her mother.
"Orion, could you please pick up the ingredients while I prepare the cauldron?"
Draco closed his eyes and his mind whirred with the possibilities, the responsibility and the decisions he would have to make from now on. When he opened his eyes, they were steel grey. He looked toward his twin children within the bark of the tree, growing fast. He would have to regain his magic fast, plan an escape for his children and make sure that the Dark Lord stay the hell away from them.
“Wait, you have a dog?”
“Siruis, will the ward hold?”, his voice laced with serious at the moment and Sirius answered honestly.
"Dilato," she whispered with careful words as she took out her wand. The bracelet glowed dark and it expanded, creating a circle made by an elaborate twisting and knots of what seemed to have been vines.
“Izzy, I forbid you from punishing yourself”, the elf’s ears perked up at this and her eyes were became more wider and it sparkled with unshed tears. Seeing this one of his eyebrows were raised but he decided not to pry into the old masters of the elf.
Blaise had no idea what they were saying and Neville whispered that he would explain it to him later. Marius noticed that Theo turned silent all of a sudden. When he was about to study him properly, a movement from Lovegood caused them all to focus on her.
He sighed. "I will because I know that the real you would never want such a thing."
"It looks like you are about to reach a decision." Hermione's eyes snapped to her left as she was walking alone in the corridors of the castle, only to see Theodore Nott sitting at one of the beams of the castle, a book opened in his lap.
“Blaisey, aren’t you crap at Herbology?”, Blaise’s head snapped to face Theo so fast it almost cracked.
“What just happened?” Ron asked once the cousins were out of sight.
Shaking his head to focus on a much important matter, he began thinking of ways on how he would have his own protection and when his eyes darted to the unconscious witch, it sparked an idea in his brain as grin bloomed on his face. He closed off his potions book and made sure that the curtains were closed behind him. After that, he slowly stood up and approached the sleeping witch.
Harry’s face painted his feelings so perfectly it was almost impressing to see just how lost he was. “What rumors?”
“Very well, you may leave him in my care”
"Cheeky brat. I will not ask why you tagged me along with your ward."
“Yes. Listen to me, Harry.” Marius could see that Harry is about to reject his offer but he had to convince Harry. He had to. “Even if Orion were to fail, do you think that the Dark Lord’s followers will just let this go? No. You and I both know that they won’t stop, not until he is dead because he is one of the pillars that seals their master. They will do whatever it takes to kill him next time and at that next time, they will assure that he is
Hermione summoned the Grimoire. Dumbledore’s eyes widened at the sight of it.
“I was just telling Orion that it was because of a Vampire that almost attacked me when I was young. He claimed that my scent was very delicious to him. After that, my Mother decided that my scent should be hidden, so she casted a spell. Therefore this,” Marius said easily.
“Don’t you even dare hurting him in any way, Lestrange. Or else—”
“High Witch, if you please, Miss Chang was the one who did the deed yet why are you searching for a Dark Witch?” Minerva began to ask and a glare was then turned to her.
“Then why did he take the mark in the first place?”
“We can’t just all leave you here”, Hermione could not help but reply back even if she knew this was the most favourable outcome for all of them. If they stay, Bellatrix would triumph, because as soon as the Heirs of the Races are killed the other will without a doubt seek revenge on their stead. It will be chaos everywhere, and the Dark Lord would not have to lift a finger to finish them all off.
I give you this chapter! Enjo~y!!
Harry’s eyes were beautiful, Marius concluded easily. He had never thought of spending some time staring at them before, but now he was aware he had been wrong before. As cliché as it sounded, he couldn’t even think of anything else but stare and stare. Funny that he almost thought as if he was being sucked by those pools of green that seemed to be glinting as they reflected the light.
this fanfic is just a work of my imagination and i only own the plot
Lestrange looked back at Harry then he said at a volume that he was sure the Werewolf would hear. “Good, then. Don’t even think of hurting him in any way because Potter, I will
,” Albus corrected him. The Alpha then turned to Remus who nodded his head at his signal. Along with Charlie, Remus left to gather some of their pack members to begin their search.
“There is something that has been bugging me for a while, Orion,” Marius, no,
Blue eyes widened, fear flashed in its depths.
As soon as the door was gone, Dumbledore stood up and walked to one of the corners of the room. He picked up tea cups and sweets before placing them on his desk, offering them to Marius who shook his head and mumbled a thank you.
“I can’t read this.” Hermione began as she stood up properly, still staring at the words engraved. “The first language of magic was long extinct and the language itself was never written as it was passed on orally,” she grumbled and crossed her arms.
Harry didn’t even realize that he leaned in closer and closer to Marius’ face. Maybe it was because those eyes gravitated him or maybe he was just so screwed in the head somehow. Whatever that was, he quickly regained his body control or else, Merlin knew he would do something he wasn’t supposed to do. Like, kissing Marius, maybe.
to all those who left comments and kudos thank you veeery much XD
Hi it has been too long since I updated and I am so sorry for that school flooded me with a lot of work. Ok so this chapter is taken on the side of Draco during the days that Harry had been stalking him.
"It this dagger had fallen to any of my sisters, it would have burned their hands."
“Indeed”, James said as he looked up the sky the ward now turning invisible.
Not long after, they entered the Owlery and the cold seeped into their bones with a vengeance despite them wearing warm clothes.
The halls were quiet. Only the snores of the paintings accompanied him. Marius did not bother himself with any light or lamp as the moonlight from the sky above and the blaze of torches were enough. By the time he reached the top, he was almost too tired that he began regretting his choice of coming here.
Betaed by Luneath, thank you always!
The vampires were all groaned, thinking that it was something overly important. Blaise grinned though as he placed his arms around Neville’s shoulders, making the werewolf blush hard.
Suddenly, silver eyes opened. The irises are shifting from black to silver, but the dog was sure his master had not awoken yet. The black aura that the guardian dog had seen countless times emanating from his master the past few days was getting thicker and thicker like a black cloud that was slowly but surely trying to devour his master from within.
Hermione blinked, confusion clear on her face. She was about to ask, but the look on the spirit face told her she wouldn’t get what she wanted.
Her eyes seeked that of Bellatrix’s and the side glance that was given to her was something she found chilling. There was mirth in those eyes, but the emptiness within them was something she feared.
Orion began scratching his wrist where his mark lie. He had felt so utterly stupid, allowing himself to be marked. Now his only hope of being released from the madman was already dead, not a single one of them alive. Marius seemed to have noticed this and woke Pansy up from her nap. He nudged Pansy carefully and the vampire awoke easily.
“Orion is volatile,” he countered.
At that, Harry beamed at him and Marius felt a bit weirded out by it.
. I swear to you, Harry. Draco Black will give you the protection your land needs.”
Remus who remained silent throughout all replied. "He went to Hogwarts, did he not?"
to my dear friend and beta Authlene thank you very much!
Dumbledore looked back at him and nodded. “Bellatrix took her from Andromeda the moment she was born and was raised to be her protégé. No one knew of this but I and her. That is the reason why Andromeda would surely use you, had she got a hold of you. She would stop at nothing to take back what she lost.”
His thoughts traveled back to his conversation with Harry in the Astronomy Tower. He tipped his head back, closed his eyes as the warm water washed upon his lithe form.
Orion raised his eyebrow at Theo and replied boredly, “Why, Theo. I did not know you adore…” his eyes found Marius who was currently eating his food and allowing them to talk. “…Marius that much?” he again turned his head to Theo’s direction, causing a tick to form on Theo’s head.
dinner. No one must find out about this,” the witch softly voiced out her order.
“Something big is about to happen and I need your help.” The air became tense and all his pack mates sat up to listen carefully. They all know that everything said within these walls would not be known to anyone else.
Minerva closed her eyes as she knew it was now the end, a tear fell from her eyes. For her own failure of not being able to save Bella from the Dark Lord’s clutches.
"If you could all see this, it means that I am dead and my son has yielded this dagger to my cousin Sirius Black." They all turned to Dumbledore for this sudden turn of events, but Dumbledore shook his head. He was shocked as well.
The Asian’s eyes suddenly widened mockingly. “Really?” Chang said, voice low in fake surprise. “Wow, this is going to be nostalgic. Just like the old times right, ‘Mione?”
“What would you give in exchange?” She tested the boy and she was delighted by what she heard.
"Well Pansy, you really that curious on what we boys do?", and Theo face-slapped himself with Blaise's comment. Pansy's eyes glimmered and she grinned devilishly and Blaise realized his mistake.
“What do you mean by that?”
“You have to, a life for millions, it is an easy decision to make”, Luna’s eyes were filled with unshed tears.
Nymphadora then tucked a strand of Luna's hair to her ear. Luna could never understand why, even if she detested and did not wish to follow Nymphadora's commands, she always felt a tinge of something for the woman. Especially when she sometimes looked at her in an endearing way, as if Nymphadora loved her.
The other him laughed like his very own. "You know the answer to that question. You lost control over us and we merely did as your emotions spurred us. What you wanted. You have to be honest, you loved every moment of feeling that much power runs through your veins."
"Harry, you have to come back with me now." The stranger—Marius? Draco—then began to voice out and the child seemed to have stopped with wrapping his hand as he looked down and slowly inched away.
“It is an honour to meet the future Alpha of the Mudbloods”, Bellatrix mocked bowed as she then cackled a laugh when Harry almost lunged at her but Hermione stopped him, her wand now in her other hand prepared for the worst.
“I am just here to make you an offer.”
“He had no choice Harry, his life is in danger.”
Then from beneath the bricked floor of the Great Hall, a huge creature broke through. Rubbles of stones and bricks scattered as the creature roared as if it was its first time to ever awaken and move about. Witches all cover cast a
With trembling lips, Draco asked, “Y-you knew?”
“I think it is through here.”
His eyes looked to his right where the warm eyes of Regulus sparkled and he widely smiled at him. “Your name is Regulus.” The smile that his son gave him was wider than the rest he had seen and he turned towards Corvus. “And you, my dear Corvus.”
A chill run up his spine as he snapped his face back to the darkness.
Harry saw that and realized that it must have been so awkward. He scratched the back of his neck due to his nervousness then he began to say. “So what do you want to ask?”
Chang raised her wand as well and tapped Hermione’s shaking one. “I accept your challenge, Hermione Granger.”
Blaise and Pansy’s loud giggles then began to fill the space as soon as the question left Marius’ mouth. Even Theo looked like he couldn’t really keep his laughter to himself as Orion’s ears turned bright red.
Lily swallowed before she hugged herself as she voiced out that cruel unforgivable name of the ritual. "Horcruxes."
Harry closed his eyes to try to get some rest but Marius’ voice rang in his ears. Loud and clear.
A cackle was then emitted by the female as she laughed wickedly.
“It looks like there is nothing here,” Ron mumbled.
“Love is a weakness!” Bellatrix voiced out as she released the woman then turned back to the child. She placed her hand back to his forehead and turned him to the female Centaur.
“They are awake,” Rowena voiced out to Marius and they both stood up to see that the three were now slowly sitting up. As soon as their eyes met Marius, Rowena was back once again to her previous form. Narcissa Black smiled down at the three of them.
“Yes Master”, she curtsied.
"Don't worry, it won't hurt. Instead, I will make it pleasurable for you." The Slytherin was now gnawing with hunger. Marius closed his eyes shut as he was losing too much oxygen and in fear of being bitten or possibly raped.
The cloud within his head cleared up and he looked towards his Aunt. For once, he saw something akin to fear within her well-guarded eyes.
It felt like forever until she stopped and sneered. “Ah~h. Since when did you know of that place?” Then, with a frown, she regarded all the dark witches around who instantly took a step back. “Did one of you rat me out like the vermin you all are?”
“What Marius said before.”
Hey! Its been so long, how have you guys been? I hope you are all well! Finally found the time to write and update despite these busy times! I appreciate you all for being so patient with me hugs to all of you and a huge huge thank you!
Harry didn’t say anything.
“Marius, can you cancel your plans with Neville this hour?”
"What, didn't sleep well?"
Ron grunted and glared at the vampire. This seemed to have caused a sparkle to appear at her eyes which Ron found beautiful but he easily shook his head.
However, as he remembered how Draco was born, he now became sure of which was the true Prophecy. Sadness enveloped his very being as he now finally understood what the first passages meant, although he could not still understand what the other passages meant.
Harry was trying to sit up but was glared at by the Healer thus made him rethink his choices but still continued to sit up. “I feel fine, can I be released?”
Marius had a look of confusion in his eyes. He stared back at the wolf and could see that he was being watched carefully. He suddenly felt a sense of familiarity towards the midnight wolf.
But as he looked at Hermione, he remembered the bonds he had forged and it dug deep into his heart.
Orion stopped and crossed his arms. He watched as his cousin did magic to banish traces of blood from his shirt before he turned his attention to Orion as if waiting for something. The vampire raised his eyebrow at him. Just by from experience and observation, he knew Draco was unpredictable.
Then he thought back on the day he met Sybill Trelawney, the one who prophesized of Harry’s fate and the Dark Lord’s doom. But she also spoke of another, whose fate was closely tied to Harry Potter’s, who will heal the broken bonds between the Vampires and the Werewolves and bring unity to the Witches.
Thanks for all the comments and kudos XD
Harry growled at his miss. The roots enveloped his body as it tightened just a bit to prevent him from moving any further. Draco sighed in relief as he was able to catch Harry with little wounds here and there.
The vampire then began to talk about their plan along with Marius telling them about the Potion, the Chamber, and the Grimoire. Harry did not seem fazed by this. He had heard everything from Marius already, so he just sat there, arms crossed and holding a staring competition with Lestrange. It was soon broken when Ron’s voice brought him back.
“Y-you—”
“What do you want from me?”
“I see. So, were you successful in finding their nest?”
Orion was desperate, he knew that much, but when he heard the words that Marius uttered, he felt like he was a devil who dragged an angel to hell by its battered wings.
She clutched and fisted at her robes above her heart and her eyes widened and her eyebrow scrunched up at the realization. She shook her head slightly as she dragged herself towards Luna’s form.
Marius shook his head. “No, but I think I know of a way to help us succeed without killing anyone.”
Marius tilted his head. “What do you mean?”
Marius merely rolled his eyes once again. Avada grunted before settling down next to him. Not close to invade personal place but close enough to his side. A beat later, there was a hand held out in front of him.
Orion shook his head and began to continue. “You weren’t too far off from your theory though, Granger. He did transfer his soul to an object and my Mother was able to speak to him by allowing the Dark Lord to possess a human body.”
He looked back at his dog and gave him a small smile. He leaned down and with his voice changed when he spoke he thought at once that he sounded a bit like his mother. “Wish me luck, Beau.”
With the Aging Potion that Severus brewed himself, the children were able to grow faster than they expected and with their special circumstance, they were able to endure their training and the fast changing of their bodies. They both grew strong and wise, while Severus taught the child he was assigned to about the meaning of this war, about his Father, about his role to play, about the truth of everything.
Marius bit his lip when he fully heard himself, heard the word that he uttered. His brain was in the middle of a war now with the pounding of his heart. Especially when Harry looked at him with a shocked expression. He knew there was no holding back at what he just voiced out, so he watched Harry with serious eyes. But then those green eyes closed and when they opened, Marius knew—he lost.
“Clarke.”
“I am sure that there are no Light witches who would dare do such a thing. Only a Dark witch would do this to one of their own,” she defended but even her voice was wavering.
"Being a spy like me— Are you out of your bloody mind, Orion?!" But that steel-like determination in his eyes made the grumpy Professor be convinced. He then released the boy from his grasp as he then leaned back to his nearest chair.
“As I thought, that was the scent last night.” Lestrange walked out of the alcove he was hiding from and his blue eyes met Harry’s green ones.
“Why would we not be safe?”
Draco's body went slack, his hand fell to the side as he looked up to the other him, strong silver eyes glared at obsidian eyes.
Hermione shook her head.
“You are not thinking what I thought you are thinking right, Orion?” Marius asked warily and a bit scared.
He clutched the cloak close to him as he whispered to his guardian. “Soon, Beau, it’s just going to be the two of us again.”
“Our only hope to sustain the Blood Ward is a bloody human!?”, Ron exclaimed and he looked right about to pull on his hair out of frustration and Remus nodded.
Harry rushed to catch him before he could fall to the grass.
at the same time. That sometimes, accepting sadness wouldn’t be a weakness.
“NO!”
"Very well. But for now, you need to sleep. I will take care of the rest."
Orion shook his head. "Go, Blaise. I will not be tolerating a weeping bumbling mess of a Longbottom if he finds out you are mangled to death by his Alpha."
When the human didn't say more, Dumbledore knew it was time for them to go back to the castle. "Perhaps you should rest, for now, my boy. I will deal with everything else."
“You don’t want him to be tied down by fate just like you are?” Marius asked.
"Prepare the portal." Her mother's voice rang despite her echoing laughter.
“That is our difference, Aunt. I found someone who accepted me despite everything I have ever done. That person told me that I was brave for not running away from what I did. I know that it does not excuse what I did and it never will, but I would spend my life repenting for it. By defeating you. By helping Harry defeat the Dark Lord and finally bring peace to our worlds.” He then surprised his Aunt as he cast a spell that threw her to the farthest corner of the room. He saw a cloaked figure jumped up to her side.
tell me what ya guys think? see ya on the next chapter!XD
Harry continued to comb his fingers through his hair. Draco was feeling sleepy at this and he saw Beau comfortably sleeping by his feet facing him. Harry was about to stand and leave but Draco clutched on to his sleeve.
“There has to be some secret passage around here somewhere.”
A look of pure confusion graced each one of them.
“Draco Abraxas Black”
Her blood froze and the urge to stop and turn away was great, the future that she saw was something that shook her still. But she knew that if she does not follow she will never know the truth of what happened to her dear friend.
“Wait,
“Then accept my soul as proof of your oath to me”, she then pointed her sword atop his heart and when Ron looked into her eyes he saw clarity and he closed his eyes as he nodded. She then plunged her sword into Ron’s heart who accepted it willingly remembering what he just accepted.
“Orion, who is your mate?”
“My Lord, forgive me. I have been searching far for allies that will be loyal to your cause.”
Ron looked amazed and scared at the same time, mostly shocked. Harry was just purely astonished at the woman. She had such strength to not abandon her responsibilities and he felt in awe.
“With her death it changes a lot of things, how about Andromeda can she help us?”
Hermione waited for Marius to reply. They all knew if the information were to come out that Marius knew Draco, he would be hunted and tortured, probably killed even, for that valuable information he had.
will have to kill Dumbledore.”
“Bellatrix”, Sirius muttered his eyes widening.
Orion gave a curt nod, but Theo kept on glaring at him. He released a sigh. "Fine. Blaise, I owe you an apology for the injury I have cost you a month ago.”
“What kind of assistance may we offer you, Young Black”, Draco’s eyes no longer lingered to the tapestry and he looked back at the goblins waiting for his reply. Then slowly he removed his hood to reveal his appearance, in the light of the torches his hair seemed like gold, his grey eyes glowed amidst it all. The two goblins looked at each other before they nodded at one another.
“Since when?”, and Hermione took out a photo from her pocket and showed it to Harry. At first, Harry thought it was just a photo of a Dementor but as he looked closer, he could see the same dark sinister eyes that showed that it was nothing like a Dementor. This creature’s eyes showed intelligence and an air superiority.
“Ugh! Had it been a female she would’ve at least had the power to help us”, Ron scowled and some nodded at his comment.
“Marius—I have a mate.”
“Tsk.” Barty did not like taking orders from anyone other than their Alpha but he had no choice in the matter, the woman was not someone they should just trifle with. He looked back at the scene where the dead Centaurs now lay and the ground itself looked lifeless. Even the grass nearby looked about to die just by being near that black spot. He scrunched his nose as he whistled to his companions to enter the portal she conjured back to their Headquarters.
Beautiful. Tragic.
“We will do our best to hide it.”
“Woah there, mate. Chill.” Ron reflexively held both of his hands up in surrender and that was then that Harry realized he bared his fangs at the other werewolf.
“That is enough Ginny,” he said calmly. Of course he was answered by a snarl.
“We will search them ourselves,” Neville added with a hint of forceful determination.
A single parchment caught his eyes and the sparkle in his eyes dimmed. Written there were two Prophecies, one which Albus had directly heard from Trelawney, but the other was written by the same witch whom Albus had heard the first one from.
