She heard her three boys gasp and the Weasley twins smirked proudly as though achieving their greatest accomplishment.
She took a few and munched quietly as she looked around the now crowded room. Gryffindors were loudly talking, Ravenclaws were speaking among each other, Hufflepuffs were a happy bunch and impossibly chirpy, the Slytherins that around her and at the far end of the table seemed distant and closed off. They gave a dangerous aura that warned people away, Maeve found it intriguing.
"Let's begin the questioning. Sirius Black eleven years ago the Potters were murdered, were you ever in contact with Voldemort?" She ignored the gasps that filled the room and focused on the man before her.
He continued to eye the chain that held the locket, he wondered how hard it could be to obtain it. "No, I can't say that I have. Tell me, Ms. Potter, where did you get such a lovely necklace?" He had a pleasant smile on his normally timid face. Eyes glinting a crimson color as he waited for her answer.
"Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present
She was so lost in her own world she hadn't even noticed when class was over, Draco had gently nudged her shoulder to which she nearly dropped the book from how startled she was. Maeve smiled sheepishly at Draco who had raised a single pale brow. She placed her things away as she followed her group out the classroom, her little snakes looked at her silently asking what they should do now.
"It was a gift from a close associate, beautiful innit?" She replied, a smile curling on her rosy lips.
Maeve looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. She heard someone whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History."
He grabbed it and gently placed it in his coat pocket and began to make his way back home. He had research to do.'
"Alright, you may choose. And you only get one chance." George was the one to speak with a teasing grin.
"Letter to whom?" Maeve wanted to scoff, had this bloke no manners for privacy? As if she would tell him, he had absolutely no valid reason to know. Especially since it contained private information, and he was currently not on her list of trustworthy adults.
"Malfoy, your father is part of the ministry of magic correct?" She whispered quietly, careful not to alert the professor or anyone else to their conversation. The blonde nodded, with confusion clouding his blue eyes. "Do you think you'll be able to gather any information about what goes on behind closed doors? Anything we should be made aware of before we start putting out plans into motion?"
Petunia shook her head rapidly, she'll clear her schedule if she has to. "Good." Her devilish niece replied, lips quirked in a pleased smile. What had her life come to? Taking orders and fearing her sisters little girl? This wasn't how she wanted to live.
"It's more annoying and bothersome than anything else." Blaise spoke, before looking at Maeve. "What about you, milady? It seems like everyone is watching you as though you're the next evil Dark Lady." He commented.
Flitwick sighed and turned once more to the disruptive girl. "Three days now. And it's because first you were late and second because you seem to think slamming doors is appropriate. The third day, before you ask, is because you are still standing when I've clearly said to have a seat. Now go."
He nodded. "He is your step in, his job is to provide you with all the means necessary to achieve greatness. Or to help you in your time in need. So if you need help, he has to help you."
The two goblins walked up to her to see if she was alright. Her body was shaking with laughter, she knew or could guess this was how the Dursleys felt when she was in one of her moods. She blinked as she calmed from her laugh attack.
None seemed to realize when professor Snape appeared, not that Maeve would have cared. "I have more than enough power in my left pinkie to dismember you if I so wished and you wouldn't be able to stop me. Your blood wouldn't be able to save you. So let me give you a life lesson, blood is nothing if you don't have the magic to back you up. Do you understand?" With each word she said, she walked closer before stopping right in front of him.
And she will get it. She closed her eyes, she'll get some sleep before she changes all the rules in this house.
Maeve nodded, expecting a similar answer. "Yes, but if we have no clue about the Dark Arts, how are we to protect ourselves? In the books it gives you theories but nothing on
Still, she gave a smile that seemed strange on the face of someone so young. “I’m alright with what I am purchasing. Both Cauldron’s will be fine and the cost isn’t a worry, please just check me out so that I may continue my shopping.”
“She scares me, but not in a scary movie or crazy way, no, she scares me in the way of how could I ever live a single day without her, kind of way.”
Maeve marched to the Slytherin common room, students roaming the halls immediately parted ways to allow her to pass. Anger poured off her small body, letting everyone know she's not to be trifled with. She walked down the cold dungeon halls and snapped the password, her magic acting quickly and slamming open the common room doors with a bang.
"On your eleventh birthday, you will be receiving a letter from a place where's there more people like you, with your abilities." Petunia carried on, she felt sweat trickling down her back. The demonic child was terrifying. "You'll be asked to attend school with them to learn to harness your magic more effectively."
Soon the train was pulling to a stop, night had already fallen and the sky was filled with stars. They were told to leave their stuff in their spot that the elves would retrieve them. She whispered to Loki, making sure Malfoy couldn't hear, telling him to wait here  Every student from each year filed out, idiots shoving and playing around. Maeve rolled her eyes at the immature dimwits. They were hardly worth her time.
The Weasley boy, Ron, flinched slightly at the dark look but held his false bravado. "I just think it's so funny the way you talk, even with your upbringing with muggles." He snickered, she smiled as she could practically taste his fear.
The voice said before the bush on her left side began to rustle and out came a beautiful snake. It had silver scales and dark slitted eyes. Maeve blinked slowly, confused on how a snake had been talking to her.
The coom room door swung open as the head of house Snape walked in, a scowl firmly on his pale face. Dark eyes scanned the room before landing on her. "Potter, if you're ready, let us head out."
“Don’t worry, my man! We can handle these two. And we will definitely have time together later.” Karamo kneels down and holds out his fist for Teddy to bump.
[Ron interview/confessional: Look, it’ll be a bloody miracle if these five blokes can achieve what no one else has been able to in the past decade. But I’ll try anything to make Harry happy, you know? He’s my best mate, and he and Draco deserve each other. And if this show doesn’t work, then I’ll just lock them in a bloody closet together until they admit they’re arse over tits for each other. Am I allowed to swear?]
want to re-learn what it’s like to try and sleep without his heavy arm thrown over my waist or without his snores interrupting my REM cycle.
Draco looked offended. “Moi? A gossip? Bite your tongue, Potter. Although I can’t wait to see what Pansy gets up to with two thirds of the Golden Trio.”
Harry shrugged and sat forward to mirror Draco’s position. “I just didn’t want to deal with it. I wanted to continue to live in a little bubble where our family is untouched by the bullshit of the outside world. But I made the wrong decision, and I am so, so sorry. You are the kids’ other father, and Ginny understands that you’re going to be involved in decisions regarding their lives just as Neville is on the other side. I’m sure that when I tell her about all of this she’s going to tell me what a tosser I am and probably also give me a smack to the head.”
“Stop navel gazing, boychick.” Harry started and turned to see Saul entering the kitchen. “You’re a good looking young man so stop searching for flaws.” Saul winked and took his usual seat at the kitchen table. “I saw how that Draco Malfoy was looking at you today. I know he’d agree with me.” His eyes twinkled and Harry scoffed.
Antoni bends down and begins to shower the small dog with love. “It’s ok! Oh, he’s perfect! Hello, new friend!”
“Oh, no. I make them for myself, and Harry kept pilfering them from my bathroom so I started creating some especially for him.”
Scorpius walked back over to the table. “Hi everyone! I’m Scorpius Malfoy and perhaps if I’m good and eat my lunch we can play later?” He waved both his hands at the assembled Potters. Turning back, Scorpius asked, “What’s a Zayde?”
“Auntie Luna said she seemed to be growing another baby in her belly because all the wrackspurts kept clear away from her but the butterflies in Neville’s greenhouse were hovering by her head.” Lily continued to spin around the kitchen, using her slippers to propel herself across the polished wood. “I’m going to wake up Jamie. Don’t have sex in here while I’m gone!”
“It’s wonderful that Satan’s given you the day off to help us celebrate Hannukah,” Hermione replied.
“I may not have been faced with the same types of choices you were, and yes, OK, yes!” Harry threw up his arms. “You made some truly horrible decisions. But I was still a stubborn arsehole when I was fifteen.”
Harry knew Saul and Sophia didn’t have children of their own, and he often wondered if he was filling a hole in their life as much as they were filling one in his.
Draco grabbed Harry and pulled him into another kiss. “How do you feel about being a June bride?” he asked between kisses.
“Honestly, I’ll give you five galleons if you take your shouting match elsewhere. Some of us are trying to get work done.” Pansy didn’t look up while she spoke, sprawled over the arms of a chair and flipping through
Harry beat him to it, casting a gentle cleaning spell over both of them. “No, Draco, I’m not just saying that because you let me fuck your mouth. I mean, that was bloody amazing, but you are. You’re beautiful. And sexy. And so insanely smart. And funny, which is honestly quite the surprise.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but allowed himself a small chuckle. “Will you still have to have an arranged marriage, even if you do get your Potions Mastery?”
“Oh just go with it, Malfoy.” Harry pats him on the shoulder. “It’s for Teddy. Follow me!” he says to the group, pushing up from the sofa.
[Hermione interview/confession: I have to admit, the Fab Five far surpassed my expectations! I thought they had a good chance of getting Draco into Muggle clothing and I knew Jonathan would be able to do something with Harry’s hair, but I was sure we’d have to stage an intervention to get those two idiots to admit their feelings for each other. But now look at them!]
“Don’t I know it. He’s a wizard with getting people to open up about their emotions and engage in some personal growth. In addition to being a literal wizard, obvs. Ha!” Jonathan beams at Harry’s reflection in the mirror. He starts snipping here and there, measuring strands with his deft fingers. “I think I’ve been a very polite, good little Jonathan so far, but it’s time to put on the kettle and spill the tea. We are in England, after all! What is the deal with you and Draco? Are you lovers in the night or what? The tension between you two is so thick and steamy I would have to put on my wellies and a raincoat to wade through it!”
He opened the door to his and Ron’s room and was rendered speechless at the sight before him. Ron was standing behind Pansy, sucking on her neck with one hand up her shirt, the other tangled in Hermione’s hair. Pansy had Hermione backed up against the wall, her hand in Hermione’s knickers and a wicked smile on her face.
Harry lifted his gaze, ready to accept a verbal lashing from Draco. What he saw was much worse than a pointed barb: the look on his face was one of hurt.
“What’s it called when you only love one person your whole life? Like Jamie loves Teddy? And Zayde loved Bubbe? Is that, like, onesexual?” Asked Al, a serious expression on his face.
Draco winced and pointed his wand to his throat, saying in a magically magnified voice, “all Potter and Malfoys downstairs for WPS,
Had kissed him and then promptly apologised, looking horrified with himself for having stooped so low.
I shift in Harry’s desk chair, trying to regain feeling in my arse. I don’t understand how he sits in this wooden monstrosity for hours on end. Not that I’m going to get comfortable, given what I’m wearing. This isn’t
(He once told me that, after defeating old Voldy, his relationship with magic had changed. He’d gained a new confidence, which translated to an increase in the power and ingenuity of his spells. “I can’t explain it, exactly,” he’d said, “but I just sort of know I can do it. I imagine what I’m going to do, and, uh… it happens.”
I could kiss Harry for hours. Days. Months. He kisses like his life depends on it; like if he doesn’t kiss me passionately and deeply then he’ll lose the privilege.
“It’s purely a game of chance, Pans,” Blaise said from his perch on the couch. “There’s no way to be ‘good’ or ‘bad’ at something that requires no skill.”
Draco lifts one eyebrow and cocks his head. “You’ll do, I suppose.” A small smile plays at his lips despite his haughty expression.
“Papa, that was a terrible hug! You are usually very good at hugging.” Scorpius was standing next to Al and smiling. “Try again! Mr. Harry, I promise you my papa can give the best hugs.”
So here I am, on an otherwise inconsequential and boring Tuesday night at the end of March, standing in front of my husband dressed to the nines in lacy lingerie.
Harry became distracted by Molly trying to start doing the dishes and forgot to further question Draco in his haste to stop her and demand she sit back and relax.
“The sooner I’m legally bound to you, the better,” Harry said, his smile wide and warm. “I’m yours, Draco. Always.”
Saul cleared his throat and all eyes turned to the head of the table. “I think,” he said slowly, “that we need to remember that it’s never wrong to stand up for what you know is right. You don’t always have to turn the other cheek and remain silent in the face of bullies.”
“That’s our cue then!” Ron says. “Tedward, you and me and Hermione are going to the aquarium and then to Diagon to see what new gadgets your Uncle George has got on.”
I feel fingers trace the skin that’s bulging up around where the garter straps are pressing into the fleshy cheeks of my arse, and then Harry drops to his knees. He rubs his stubbled jaw against the sensitive skin at the inside of my thighs before trailing his fingertips down, causing my skin to break out into gooseflesh. He caresses my ankles and my calves, working his back way up my legs slowly, pausing to press kisses to random points as he goes.
He was not disappointed in his decision to brave the cold and the crowd to get his meal. The sandwich was delicious, and the potato salad was pleasantly spicy. Two days later he returned to again buy his lunch, this time ordering “The Deamus,” a grilled sandwich made with sharp Irish cheddar and chutney. By the time that winter was giving way to spring, Draco had made his way through most of the menu and hadn’t found anything he didn’t enjoy (although some of the Indian-inspired sandwiches and dishes were a bit too spicy for his admittedly delicate palate).
“Then. Don’t. Look. Up.” Draco pointed his finger at Harry’s chest and continued to shout at him. “Where else am I supposed to do this? In the dormitory? Where there is approximately three bloody feet between each bed? Or would you rather me do this in the Great Hall? How about I jump up on the table for my sun salutations? Hmm? Is that what you want, Potter?”
“Harry you are daft as a bush. They obviously mean for us to share.” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “And I have to say, Bobby, your taste is fantastic. The aesthetic echoes the Malfoy pied a terre in Paris.”
Saul caught Harry’s eye and raised his eyebrows, managing to communicate both, “you better fix this” and “I’m disappointed in you” without opening his mouth. Harry hung his head.
“Huh,” Harry said. He sat back in his chair. “Why didn’t you find a man to marry and adopt? You could always use a surrogate if you’re concerned about blood.”
“Look at me, Harry,” I try to put some authority into my voice. “There is nothing I wouldn’t do to make you happy, you daft arse. I also enjoyed this exploration of your kink... I think we’re past the stage where I’d judge you for something you wanted to do in the bedroom, don’t you?”
Draco is wearing soft-looking gray joggers, a dark green vest, and a knit cardigan. The joggers leave little to the imagination.
[The scene cuts to show Jonathan raking his fingers through Harry’s shorter, tousled curls. His usually unruly hair looks stylish and clean. Harry is turned away from the mirror, and Jonathan is looking at his work delightedly.]
Draco took her hand in his, surprised at the strength of her grip. “Draco Malfoy. Former Death Eater. Wizard. Gemini,” Hermione - she was Hermione now, he supposed - made an inelegant noise and he smiled at her. “Yes, Gemini. Currently unemployed, aspiring Potions Master. Son to a father with visions of grandeur who has gone mad in Azkaban, and to a mother who was just yesterday wearing an orange jumpsuit for collecting refuse that she’s altered to look like a classical A-line gown. And that’s using the muggle method, mind you. Sewing machine and all.”
“You can’t use a charm on a muggle kitchen instrument. Just turn that knob,” Harry reached across Malfoy’s body, letting his arm brush against the taut line of his stomach, and flicked the knob. Harry was sure he imagined that Malfoy had leaned in slightly to his touch.
“Well, I’ve been thinking about what it would be like to kiss you for at least the past two days, if not the past two years,”
After a few minutes his weight actually becomes quite uncomfortable and I have to sit up, breaking the peaceful silence in the office.
“You’re an absolute pleb, Harry Potter,” Draco said. “You have the social skills of Ronald Weasley. I wasn’t ‘in pain’ or in any way upset that you kissed me.”
“Oh, Gin. I know. I miss her too.” Harry tried to console his wife, rubbing her lower back in gentle circles.
“Saul, I’m worried that your mind’s started to go. That, or you need a stronger prescription for your glasses. Malfoy wasn’t looking at me at all today.”
My name is Edward Remus Lupin but you can call me Teddy and I am seven years old. My dad and my mum died in the war when I was a tiny baby, so I’m being raised by my godfather who’s called Harry and my cousin who’s called Draco. I love them a lot and they’re my dads. We all live together in a big old house in London and also we have a West Highland Terrier called Troglobite and a house elf called Kreacher who is very grumpy. My Aunt Hermione lets me watch your show when I stay with her and Uncle Ron and you help people look prettier and also make their lives way better. My Harry and my Draco need someone to make their lives prettier and better by a lot. Harry wears a lot of clothes that are too big for him and sometimes have rips and Draco says that it drives him spare. And Draco only wears wizarding robes even when we have family time and I get to wear my jimjams. But what’s the most important thing for you to fix is that Harry and Draco are in love with each other but they pretend that they
Mouth parting slightly in surprise and eyes wandering up to her forehead where a faint lightning shaped scar remained, the goblins couldn’t get rid of the mark fully but at least the dark magic tainting it was gone. “By the gods, Ms. Potter, I’m terribly sorry for the inconvenience! I shall have everything ready for you. Please follow me to get your measurements done.”
"I'm certain that he is not the one who betrayed my parents. Now, if you'll excuse us, we mustn't be late." She followed Lord Malfoy towards the fireplace and watched him pull out a handful of green powder.
She threw the powder before shouting as clearly as she could, "Ministry of magic." Her eyes squinted shut as she felt herself stumble. When she was steady enough, she opened her eyes and glanced around in wonder. The ministry was a large marbled building, with people bustling about.
"Well, if it isn't little miss Potter, the girl who lived. Think you can walk around acting as if you own the place?" He sneered, accentuating his ill-favored features. She felt pity to those who gave birth to him, or perhaps that's where he's gotten his looks from.
Maeve stood up from her crouching position, straightened her dress out and walked out to find her aunt and cousin sitting in the family area. They were huddled together. "Petunia, you'll have to drive Vernon to the hospital. You'll not speak of this to anyone, unless you want to be punished." She smiled sweetly, sending shivers down her aunt's spine. How could such a beautiful, angelic looking child be so demonic?
Soon, the Herbology professor was letting them out on account that they write a five page essay on the importance of using the plants in the correct fashion. Honestly, herbology was the equivalent of botany in the muggle world. Maeve and her little group walked out together, staying further away from the other students as they all made their way to the classroom 2E, class 99. A hiss from around her arm had her turning away from her talking companions.
Soon the other students trickled in, a handsome boy with sandy brown hair and pretty blue eyes stood to the right of Zabini. The Raveclaws on the left and the Slytherins on the right, a clear divide of houses. Maeve sighed inaudibly, when she took over the magic world she was gonna strip away the bloody prejudice.
Also I know the part about the school seems unrealistic but I've had some pretty harsh teachers and since I was a gifted student I had more expected of me. I just wanted my character to be a nerd.
The man led them to the lake which had a row of boats. "Alright, no more than four to a boat!" He instructed. Maeve walked to the nearest one, followed by Malfoy and two others.
"Alright children, anything you didn't finish will be done as after class check out. Now put the book away and you may get out your lunch boxes." Mrs. Colt instructed with a cheerful smile.
As the sun began to rise, more students began filing into the Great Hall. Including Blaise Zabini and the pug faced girl, Pansy Parkinson, and Malfoy's two lackeys from the train station. As soon as Zabini spotted them he made a beeline towards them. He sat beside Malfoy, Maeve smirked when she saw how Parkinson stayed as far as she could.
Her question broke the twins out of their stupor. "Your father is prongs, the greatest prankster to walk these halls along with his friends? And your godfather who betrayed your parents is padfoot?" Fred sounded so out of it Maeve would have been a little concerned if he wasn't wasting her time just standing around.
Maeve snorted into her hand. "Please, we could breathe a little too loud and she'll probably dock points off. We don't have to do anything for her to hate us, it's an automatic given with us being Slytherins."
Loki peered curiously at his human with his slit eyes, her green ones staring back at him. They glowed faintly with her thrumming magic that flitted through the air around him. She paid no mind to the students who gazed warily at the serpent or how her group looked at each other with a look of understanding. Understanding what, she did not know.
Finally after waiting a solid five minutes Draco walked in leading the two other boys ahead of several other first years. Pale blue eyes landed on her and a wide grin overcame his face, cheeks flushing a rosy hue, Blaise and Theo glanced over in her direction as well before they also smiled. Seemed she was not the only one feeling lost without them by her side. They practically ran to get to her despite her not being that far from walking distance, but she knew as how that must have felt as she felt the strain of being away. It was similar to how she felt with Loki, yet different. Though she couldn't place her finger on it.
"Forgive me, professor, but I do not wish to offer any more information. Surely, you'd understand, privacy is a vital thing in a world full of secrets. Now, I must be going. I wouldn’t want to be late to any classes. It would be something I'd  like to keep out of my marks." She smiled, and turned. The look on his face as she uttered those first two sentences would keep her vigilant.
They stopped at a rather unassuming wall, though Maeve knew better, after all magic could deceive anyone. She felt the magic pull around the air, it was pure. Quite nice. She grabbed a hold of her trolley and glanced at her dreadful relatives. "Well, I suppose this is it. I hope you know just because I won't be there doesn't mean you can get away. I own you Vernon Dursley. That pretty little mark on your arm will always lead me to you." She had a vindictive smile on her angelic face.
"Now would be nice, Ms. Potter." Maeve rolled her eyes at the irritating man, she smiled once more at her friends before walking away. Snape trailing behind her, walking along with her to the Transfiguration classroom. The young raven haired girl couldn't exactly understand why that horrid woman would like to speak to her, unless she told Dumbledore about their first encounter. McGonnagal probably wasn't impressed to be told off by a mere eleven year old. She smirked at that.
Several students shivered as her eyes shifted passed them, a small knowing smile formed on her lips. "I am going to assume none of this will reach the professors ears? Because I'll be very displeased by that." She hummed approvingly at the nods that spread out. "Good."
"Is something funny? Please do tell, I'd love to laugh as well." She prompted with a smile that promised a world of pain.
As the years went by, the Dursley household quickly fell into the control of young Maeve Potter. She soon taught them the rules they were to follow lest they be punished. Vernon Dursley was the first to learn that the hard way.
Petunia nodded, cursing herself for letting this demonic child boss her around. Lily was never this way, always kind and polite. She was glad to be getting rid of her for the rest of the school year. Though, she had half a mind not to repeat her thoughts out loud.
His eyes flashed a crimson color as he eyed the locket around her thin, pale neck and a smile curled at his lips. "Yes, your godfather was released from Azkaban, correct?"
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
Maeve learned that focusing her magic on Latin words made it come out stronger, so as she passed the driver she whispered a little spell she made up. "Timor accedit nox vestra." It was to show your greatest fear when night came. That spell had been her greatest accomplishment.
Maeve thought his rant was pretty hilarious. But she also knew he was right. Those parasites shouldn't be telling her what to do.
She smirked as she stared at the parasites that were shaking in fear, She replied back in snake tongue, relishing in the terror apparent on their faces.
"How can this be?" His voice cracked at the question, it must have hurt to realize you had a daughter with a woman you haven't dated yet only to find you never really saw her grow up.
"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing." McGonagall had passed out matches and gave them clear instructions on only transforming the matches into needles and nothing more. Maeve hid a smirk as Morag tried to light her match on fire and was scolded by professor Mcgonagall.
Loki merely hissed in amusement, he was glad his human was showing more emotion than in the past. At least he knew she wasn't a heartless robot. That would have been something truly terrifying.
She asked, wanting to be sure that of she allows her new snake companion to come, he could follow through with her promising threats to her relatives. Loki gave an equivalent of a nod, with his snake head. A smile graced her face, yes, she'd have much fun.
She was lost in her thoughts, walking around with a wide, enchanting smile on her pale, unblemished face. Petunia watched her niece warily, she looked like an innocent child. But she knew the truth, that was a demon spawn.
"We can meet up before breakfast on the quidditch field, Fred and I enjoy going there early every morning to watch the sun rise." George said with flushed cheeks, freckles standing out.
"Well, I have spoken to your head of house and the headmaster of the way you've spoken to me during our first lesson." The female professor was the one to answer. "And I've requested to have a meeting to discuss why such behavior is inappropriate."
“May I ask where your parents are?” He rose a dark brow at the lack of guardian present, still clearly put out with what he most likely assumed to someone from a lower class.
Neatly rolling up her parchment, she tightened it gently around the owls talons. She patted the owl softly on the head, before ushering it out. "You know what to do." With a hoot, the tiny animal flew away.
The boy pursed his lips in thought, he could always bring up the minister and his incompetence, that always gets father speaking up a storm but what would he say should he get suspicious? He voiced that to the young witch, she would know what to say as she was brilliant. He watched her think as she tapped a small pale finger against her lower lip.
The tiny professor had them read chapter one through six of The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk. He claimed he wanted them to have a clear understanding of what each spell could do and the negative affects it could have if done incorrectly. He said by tomorrow they would be working on the levitation charm.
As dinner came to an end and the houses retreated to their respective common rooms, Maeve and Draco bid each other goodnight, Samael having flown to the owlery with the other birds. She decided to open the package tomorrow as she was far too exhausted, she did her nightly routine and dressed in her pale blue nightgown and braided her hair before getting in bed smiling at Loki, who curled around her.
As powerful as Severus knew he was, he couldn't help the shiver that slid down his spine. Potter was dangerous, that he knew, but there was something else. Something lurking in the background, waiting to be released and he prayed he was nowhere near when it happened. He'd just have to stay on her good side and provoking her would do no good. "There's no reason to read again, not when class is so close to ending. Just sit quietly and patiently until it is time to go."
As soon as she stepped foot on the ground, Maeve could feel the burst of magic rushing around them. She looked all around her, for the first time in forever she could feel childish excitement welling inside her. She took a glance at Malfoy and saw similar look of amazement on his face, looks like mask was capable of fully breaking.
“Well, I don’t have much cause to interact with that part of society.” Draco sighs. “I swear I have no issue with Muggles any longer. I’ve learned the egregious error of my ways and also learned a lot about muggles and their culture in the past decade. And to be perfectly honest with you any hesitation I have in immersing myself in their world is that I’m simply overwhelmed by it all. Did you know that an electrical current can kill you?! And the internet!” Draco shudders. “Hermione and Harry have both tried to give me tutorials on using electronic mail, but with little success.”
“Well,” began Al, “Jemma Goldblum said that her mum talks about Dad at home a lot, wondering how he could be happy partnered up with a Death Eater. And a few other boys have made jokes about you, you know, being -”
“Oh you absolute angels! I love you all. I’m so excited to keep watching you grow as a family.”  Tan says, wrapping Harry up in a hug before moving on to Draco.
“Thank you, Zayde!” Lily said, sitting up straighter in her chair and patting her riotous hair down with her rather grubby hands. Harry flicked a gentle cleansing charm in her direction before she grabbed a biscuit and ingested whatever germs she had picked up at school.
“Depends,” Harry said. “Would your mother have threatened me at wand-point to fix whatever I’d bollocksed up between us?”
“Of course I love Draco,” Harry says immediately, then freezes, his hands still in a bowl of fenugreek seeds.
“For that kiss… you told me last week … please, forgive me.” Harry hung his head, feeling like a complete arse.
“Oh, Harry. It’s cute that you even have to ask.” Draco climbed off the bed and pulled his pants on. “Are you coming?” Draco looked behind him, quirking his eyebrow.
“Scorpius is certainly taken with Albus. He hasn’t stopped talking about him since we first met you at the deli.”
“Huh.” Harry turned to address Malfoy, letting his thigh rest against the other boy’s as he shifted his weight. “Did you notice anything sorta, erm, weird, going on between Pansy, Ron, and Hermione?”
Draco closes his eyes. “I suppose I understand your point.” He’s silent for a few moments before he says, quietly, “I think I’ve loved Harry since before I even acknowledged that I was gay.”
“Yes, but you’re the Chosen One. Call and remind them that you broke into the Ministry once before and you’ll do it again if they don't acquiesce to your demands.”
Harry turned to look at Draco and smiled. He leaned in to be heard over the din of the dining room and replied, “No, thank you for coming! It’s wonderful to have you here. You’ve been such a help - I don’t know what I’d have done without you tonight.”
Jonathan cuts him off. “Just think about it, sweetie.” He squeezes Draco’s shoulder. “Now, back to the Singing Sorceress herself!”
Draco was startled out of his reveries and back to the chilly London afternoon when he nearly ran full-body into a couple who were standing in a long queue. He managed to side step them, and wondered for what they could possibly be braving the January temperatures.
Harry had no idea how long he’d been walking, but he noticed that dusk had settled over London when his stomach grumbled. He glanced down at the battered watch on his wrist without actually noting the time, and looked around while trying to remember the last time he’d eaten. Harry had left Grimmauld Place in a daze, feeling overwhelmed and stir crazy. The insomnia that plagued him since he’d run out of his supply of Dreamless Sleep a week prior was making it difficult for him to keep the door shut to the grief that constantly threatened to overtake him. When he’d had gotten out of bed that morning - pointedly ignoring the stack of unanswered letters from his friends and adopted family “just checking in... we haven’t heard from you, Harry, and we’re worried…” - Harry was seized with the need to leave the stiflingly stale air of the old Black home. He’d dressed and stepped out of his house for the first time since he’d locked his doors, closed his Floo connection, and put up as many wards as he could come up with almost a month ago.
He steps further into the room and pushes the door shut with his foot. His Auror robes are off and in his arms, so he’s down to a pair of dark trousers and a white oxford shirt. His tie is askew, his hair is (obviously) an absolute mess, he needs a shave, and he looks absolutely
“Teddy is actually the son of my late cousin Nymphadora, and Harry is his godfather. When my Aunt Andromeda began displaying signs of dementia, Teddy was about a year old. Harry and I had already begun to mend our relationship, and we’d both spent quite a lot of time with Teddy.”
Harry blushes. “It’s very experimental. Turns out that despite my heritage, I can’t handle too much spice, and recently it’s been hard to convince Teddy to eat anything that isn’t brown.”
Teddy smiles. “I like it when I get to help, so I like doing it the Muggle way. I can’t wait until I get my wand.”
“Yeah, OK,” Harry responded breathlessly, eager to return some of the pleasure that Draco had bestowed upon him. He flipped over and sat between Draco’s open legs. Harry opened the lube and squirted some onto his fingers before sliding down and hoisting Draco’s legs up so that his calves rested on his shoulders, giving him better access to Draco’s arse. He reached down and breached Malfoy with the tip of his middle finger, waiting for Malfoy to adjust to the feeling before giving him the rest of his finger. With his other hand he fisted Draco’s cock and stroked him slowly, timing his tugs to coincide with his finger penetrating Draco’s arse. He may be new to this, but he knew that Draco would need a lot of prep to take his dick. Plus, he was in no hurry: having Draco spread out beneath him, letting out breathy little moans as Harry sought out his prostate was driving Harry mad with want. After a few minutes, he added a second finger and finally a third, using a copious amount of lube.
“Yeah Gin, I’m sure,” Harry replied, shouting a bit to be heard over the din of the Hogwarts Express pulling out of the station. He adjusted Lily carefully from where she was tied to his chest - she had somehow managed to fall asleep in her carrier despite the noise, and her knee was digging into Harry’s rib.
“He’s a great kid. You’ve done a wonderful job with him.” Harry put the dry dish in the cupboard and turned to face Draco.
“Yes and no. We actually do have a working Floo, but it’s only connected to Ginny’s flat, the Granger-Weasley’s, and The Burrow.” Harry ran a hand through his messy hair as he talked; Draco tracked the movements and idly wondered if his hair was as soft as it looked. He’d quite like to run his own hands through the inky black strands, perhaps pulling a bit and scratching his nails along Harry’s scalp…
Malfoy continued to laugh. “You can sleep in Pansy’s bed tonight, you hapless oaf. She’s sharing with me, but I’m sure she won’t mind.” Malfoy finally stopped laughing and Harry looked over at him.
Draco blushed and he let a small, shy smile play at his lips. Harry walked forward and touched his fingertip to a drop of water that was clinging to a strand of Draco’s hair.
“Hellooooo Draco Malfoy! I’m Tan France,” Tan moves to shake his hand. “Your son Teddy nominated you and your partner Harry for a makeover on our television show. We’re part of a team that’s here to give you a total boost!”
“Oh, err, hello,” Harry said, his voice hoarse from disuse. He coughed a few times in an attempt to clear his throat and blinked rapidly, trying to stymie the tears that he felt welling up as visions of a long white beard and King’s Cross station came to mind. “I’ve never been here before. What do you suggest?” He felt a tear slide down his cheek and he hurriedly brushed it away.
“I’m not sure about ‘trademark’ look, but I suppose I started growing my hair out during my last few years at Hogwarts. I just lost interest in the upkeep of my shorter style...” Draco trails off, meeting Jonathan’s gaze in the mirror. He lifts one shoulder in a shrug. “It’s easy enough to manage at this length, and I can tie it back when I’m brewing potions.”
“You really give yourself too much credit, Draco,” Hermione had teased him one day in his lab in Paris, her hair in a frizzy halo that reminded him so much of her at fourteen that he had taken to calling her ‘Granger’ all day.
Jonathan tips Harry’s chin up with his pointer finger so that Harry is looking directly into his eyes. “Life is short. Love is terrifying, but it’s also a mystical, magical rainbow journey full of baby goats wearing onesie pajamas. Do a George Michael and have a little faith, boo boo. You two could have so much happiness together.”
Harry held his hand out and a few moments later a bottle smacked into his palm. He smiled and held it out to Draco, but he shook his head at Harry. “That’s for you.” He may not have ever fucked a man before, but Harry knew the spells they needed before penetrative sex. He waved his hand and cast safety and gentle cleaning charms. Draco yelped a bit. “Warn me before you go cleaning out my arsehole! Salazar, Potter. Manners!” Draco smacked Harry’s arm lightly before he leaned down and took Harry’s left nipple into his mouth, simultaneously using his other hand to gently twist his right nipple between his fingers, eliciting a gasp from Harry. He moved sinuously down Harry’s chest and stomach, licking and sucking until he reached the hard length of Harry’s cock. Draco grabbed the base with his hand and licked a hot strip from fist to tip. Harry hissed in pleasure, his hips jerking up.
“She’ll probably forget in a few minutes, Dad.” Al had walked completely into the sitting room and was using his toe to move a plastic car back and forth across the carpet. “Are you mad at me?”
“Oh, erm, I’ve never...done that before. With a bloke,” Harry replied, embarrassed at his lack of experience. “I mean, I’ve done other stuff - loads of other stuff! - just not that.” Draco - if it turned him on to use his first name, then he would now be Draco to Harry - reached up to tweak one of Harry’s nipples, and Harry responded by moaning and grinding his hips into Draco’s again. He could feel the hard length of Draco’s erection against his own through the thin layer of pajama pants, and the friction was intoxicating. “But, I mean, we could try it! We
“To be fair, most of the recipes are Sophia’s. I’ve just … added to them. She was the real cook in the family.”
[Moments later the camera shows Harry being escorted back to the chair, his hair now wet and a towel draped over his shoulders.]
Draco couldn’t help the bark of laughter that escaped him. Potter? Hugging him? In the middle of a muggle deli? For a moment he was worried that he’d passed out in his lab and would be slapped awake at any moment.
“Oh for Christ’s sake! This is ridiculous,” Harry said, huffing. He stood up from the table and dragged Draco with him, walking to the center of the room.
“To my recollection, it was a toddler, a dashing young pureblood, and one gormless git,” Draco says, a small but genuine smile on his face.
“No. I’m afraid that if I open my eyes I’ll realise that I’m dreaming. That I’m in my bed and this is just a very vivid, very sexy dream. It’s happened before.”
been a fun conversation to have with the kids). “As the resolution from last week to begin with the youngest Wottfoy was passed, I cede the floor to Ms Lily Luna Potter.”
“Of course. Right. Well, I’d best be going. I’ll collect Scorpius in the morning. Goodnight, Potter.” Draco swept out of the room and walked briskly to the front hall. Harry hurried behind him.
The two exchange a look before Harry clears his throat. “Well, err, neither of us have particularly fond memories of childhood meals before we left for school. So we make a lot of new things that none of us have ever tried, or we try and recreate some of our favorite Hogwarts meals if we’re feeling uninspired.”
“Oh, well… no, I mean, would you like to have a cuppa?” Harry scratched at the back of his neck, his cheeks colouring.
The three Potter children entered the kitchen just then, taking their seats and talking over each other.
“We did, Teddy. Is that… OK with you?” Draco asks, uncertain. “If Harry and I were to be more affectionate with each other? Because that’s what we were talking about in private. We want to be in a romantic relationship, but if for some reason you don’t like it, then we want to talk it through. As a family.”
Harry smiled, looking equal parts relieved and disappointed. “I suppose I owe you from the aftermath of George’s birthday last month.”
“Thanks, yeah. Teddy’s a great kid. He’ll be home next week, although I’m sure you already know about that.” Harry looked up at Draco suddenly, as if just realising something. “Actually, you and Scorpius should come over for seder next week! Passover falls right over Easter this year, so we’re hosting a big family seder. We’d love you to come.”
When Harry didn’t move, Malfoy turned back around and hopped back into a push-up position before snaking his upper body down and out so that his chest was pushed up towards the sky. With a smirk back at Potter, he rose onto his toes and back into the V-position that he had started in.
Draco took a deep drink of water. “I’ve so carefully planned out what I’d say to you, if I was ever face to face with you again. This is not what I’d imagined.”
“Err….” Harry begins, looking around the room. “This looks fantastic, but why are some of my things in here?”
“Fuck me, Harry. Please. I’m ready. I don’t want any more prep. I want to feel your big cock splitting me open.”
“Live your truth, henny!” Jonathan shouts suddenly, snapping his fingers in the air. “Wear what makes you feel beautiful!”
Draco’s face softens as he looks at his son. He walks over and crouches down to be at his eye level. “Oh, Teddy. You are the kindest, most thoughtful child. Harry and I are certainly not unhappy with our lives! But if it will make you feel better to see me wearing Muggle trousers, then I suppose I will have to suffer through the indignity.”
“Yes, I did papa. I think Al is my best friend. I’ve never had a best friend, so I’m not sure but I think this is it!” Draco smiled down at his son, glad that at least one Malfoy and one Potter were on even footing.
Well, that, and Saint Paul had never been in love with, nevermind married to, Harry Potter. Plato was much more on the nose when he decried love to be a serious mental disease.
Hermione sipped her coffee calmly. “Get your stories straight, you two, or I swear I’ll floo Narcissa straight away and tell her you eloped.”
“Well, actually, people mostly have sex because it feels good,” Draco said, “and because it is a physical manifestation of their desire and love for one another.”
Harry waved his hand dismissively. “Scorpius was perfectly well behaved. He even complimented my pancakes and told me that you’d should take cooking lessons from me.” He smiled.
“Sure, Lils,” Harry said, arranging what Draco assumed were the rugelach onto a small plate. “Here, why don’t you take some of these up to Al and Scorpius?” Lily clutched the plate with both hands as if she were carrying the finest china, and made her way slowly out of the kitchen.
Harry’s tongue suddenly stopped and Draco looked behind him. Harry had his eyes squeezed shut and he was holding the base of his dick tightly, breathing heavily. “Good God Draco I almost came. The mouth on you.”
Malfoy suddenly looked uncomfortable, but took a breath and said to Harry, “I won’t bring this up again as it clearly upsets you, but I just want you to know that if your muggle relations truly did force you to cook for them as barely more than a toddler then...well, then I hope to never meet them because I would hex them to within an inch of their life. And trust me, I know some
That night, the Eighth Years were yet again gathered around the fire. Padma had suggested that they play a drinking game, and an hour later they were all properly sloshed and armed with much more information about each other from playing several rounds of “never have I ever,” a muggle game that Blaise had learned from his American cousins.
Jonathan’s fingers get stuck in Harry’s hair as he tries to run them through the mass of curls. He carefully extricates them, maintaining a big, genuine smile. “Well, this hair has never met its match. And that match is me! Duh! I’m going to tame this mane, and you are going to strut around the Ministry for Magic like a pageant queen on her victory tour, henny. Let’s get you shampooed and ready!” He claps his hands in delight, then takes off Harry’s glasses and places them on the table in front of the chair. “Allons-y!”
Harry seems to realise this, however, and he takes his wand from its holster and performs a complicated series of swishes and flicks. And I suddenly find myself without the panties, but with everything else intact.
“Ok, so you’re not going to have babies even though you’re getting married? But you will be having sex.” Albus summed up the situation with a scrunched, pinched look on his face and Scorpius’ already pallid complexion paled a bit more.
“Yes! I have an aunt named Pansy but she’s not really my aunt. Papa says that family is who you choose, it doesn’t matter that she’s not blood. He also says that blood is overrated.”
“I asked you something a few years ago, but you didn’t give me an answer and instead you chucked me out of your house and so I haven’t brought it up again.” Draco frowned, trying to remember the reasons behind the handful of times he and Harry had had such big rows that he’d banned him from his Knightsbridge home. Perhaps Harry wanted to try bondage again? He hadn’t seemed too put out when Draco admitted he didn’t fancy being tied up, and he certainly hadn’t kicked Harry out over it. But what else could Harry have hidden in his gym bag, if not ropes? Maybe a riding crop?
(And yes, of course I’m familiar with the Judeo-Christian worldview. I’m a wizard, not an illiterate.)
A few minutes later Jamie Potter came running into the kitchen clutching an envelope to his chest. “Dad, can I use Skops to send this?”
[Scene cuts back to the Potter/Malfoy residence, where Teddy is fast asleep on the sofa surrounded by unwrapped presents. Draco and Harry sit on either side of him.]
“Err, hello, Draco,” Harry said, holding up a brown bag with the Weinberg’s Deli logo stamped across the front. “I’ve brought you lunch.”
Harry huffed out a small laugh. “I mean, I know you know that I can be a bit thick from time to time. But I was especially thick in this situation. When I got the letter from Lily’s school, my only thought was to minimize the damage. If I didn’t make a big deal out of that little arsehole calling me ‘The Chosen Fairy’ in front of Lily, then, perhaps, the whole thing would just go away. Her teacher assured me the kid had been disciplined and his parents talked to, and so I didn’t want you to have to hear about it at all. I wasn’t thinking about handling the incident as a parent; I was thinking about handling it as your partner, trying to, I don’t know… shield you from a six year old?” Harry sat back in his chair and raised his hands as if in resignation. “I know it was shortsighted. But I didn’t mean to disclude you from anything regarding Lily or making decisions about how to parent her. I didn’t even floo Ginny about it, which it’s now occuring to me was also idiotic.”
They lapsed into silence. Harry wasn’t sure how to respond to Malfoy’s last statement - he had no idea what it was like to live the weight of such heavy family obligations. But if the war had taught him anything, it was that life was precious and altogether too short, and people should take every chance at happiness that was presented to them. When he told Malfoy as much, Malfoy snorted and told him he sounded like one of those wizarding self-help books that take up an entire section at Flourish and Blotts. Harry had responded by flicking muddy water at Malfoy’s still pristine button-down shirt, and a small water fight ensued. When Dr Song came upon the two of them covered in brown water but laughing, she took their bucket of cleaned pottery with a wink and an approving smile.
Harry glances at Draco with a soft smile. “I quite like your new look, actually. You can still be all overly dramatic and swish your hair about, but you can see more of your face now.”
[Antoni confessional/interview: cooking as a family is a great way to bond and solidify relationships. I chose this recipe because it’s healthy, hearty, and simple enough that even Teddy can partake in its preparation!]
your child. She certainly claims you has her other father, and I was under the impression that you wanted her to be, well… ours.”
“Potter, you wound me,” Draco drawled, cradling his wine glass in his long fingers. “Are you implying that at fifteen you didn’t long for our offspring to socialise?”
[A decrepit house elf wearing a stained tea towel shuffles around the kitchen getting a breakfast of toast and fruit together. Draco, grasping a large mug of coffee, and Teddy dance in the kitchen to Golden Years by David Bowie. Harry enters yawning, looking sleep-mussed but smiling fondly at the scene. He picks up Teddy and spins him around.]
[The camera pans from Hermione to the Fab Five, who are rendered speechless. Karamo has his mouth hanging open and Antoni looks impressed and a little turned on.]
Draco pulled off. “Oh no, Harry. None of that.” He took Harry’s hand and placed it on the back of his head. “Fuck my mouth, Potter. I want you to.” Draco licked the slit of Harry’s cock before opening his mouth, waiting.
Draco smiled into Harry’s neck and bent his head down to press a kiss to his stubbly jaw. “You need a shave, oh fiancé mine.”
I cooked for my aunt, uncle, and cousin when I lived with them. Up until the day I left for Hogwarts.”
Harry quit the Aurors and decided to move in with Saul to help him run the deli. He’d been as good as living there while Sophia was sick, and after the media shitstorm that happened when his and Ginny’s divorce became public he was more than happy to leave Wizarding London.
“Potter, I’ve never successfully cast a nonverbal hex, but so help me Salazar I will if you don’t continue eating my arse right this moment.” Harry smirked and added another finger, beginning to slowly fuck his tight entrance. Malfoy dropped his head down, groaning loudly; he reached blindly behind him and found Harry’s head, pulling it back towards him. Harry was almost painfully hard and it sent shivers down his spine to have Malfoy demanding his ministrations. Since both of his hands were occupied, he lifted his head and told Malfoy to touch himself while Harry continued to finger and lick his hole. Malfoy complied and grabbed his leaking cock with his free hand.
“So, Harry. What do you wear on a usual work day?” Tan asks, ruffling through a drawer of mostly white undershirts.
Teddy stands up a bit straighter and takes a deep breath. “Well, if it’s a school day then Draco comes and wakes me up and I brush my teeth and wash my face and put on my school clothes.”
He unzipped the bag and dug his hand around inside of it until he produced a small box that he clutched in his palm. “Draco,” Harry said, opening the box to reveal a gold band nestled in black velvet, “will you marry me?”
Their apparent cessation of hostilities had come to an end, however, when they were forced to share a trench during the Eighth Years’ spring trip to excavate a wizarding archaeological site in Suffolk. Dr River Song, the newly appointed Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts, had come to the post after completing her PhD in Medieval Archaeology and “traveling the universe” with her erstwhile husband. She claimed that she had always wanted to teach, and after missing both wars due to what she termed a “glitch in the space/time continuum” (the entire Eighth Year class could agree on almost nothing, save that their new professor was
And so, standing in front of Dr Song now, Harry closed his open mouth. He was tired, he was hot, and he was bored of fighting with Malfoy. Instead of protesting the situation further, he squared his shoulders and told himself to, in the words of Minerva when he tried to get out of rooming with Malfoy last September, “grow up and make it work, Potter.”
Karamo clears his throat, looking between the two men with raised eyebrows. He turns to the little boy standing nearby. “So, Teddy! Tell me about a day in your life. Why did you nominate your dads to be on Queer Eye?”
He chuckles and adds a second finger almost immediately. I let out a sound somewhere between a whimper and a groan and fuck back onto Harry’s hand.
Just then Lily and Hugo came running into the dining room, waving the afikomen in front of them and squealing with delight. “WE GOT IT, ZAYDE!” said Lily, climbing onto her grandfather’s lap with little regard for his personal space. Saul winced as Lily’s knee connected with his stomach.
“And at night, you can watch the stars,” Bobby explains. “No matter the weather, you’ll always be able to see them clearly. And you can ask your dads to move the view around, so you can see the Draco constellation and Leo, and even Andromeda and Sirius and any other of your star-named family members.”
Tan stands behind him and adjusts the jacket, smoothing out the lines at his shoulders. “You look like a million pounds, Harry. Every man needs a real suit, and this one fits you like a glove.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply but Harry interjected. “I think we’ve gotten off track a bit here. Sex is a very important part of a relationship, and no you don’t have to be married to have it, but you shouldn’t do it with just anyone. You can end up feeling, erm… sad? Regretful? Unfulfilled?”
“Bienvenue! Welcome to my laboratory, Draco!” Jonathan says, sashaying up to his client and giving him two air kisses on either cheek. “You look positively sickening in those muggle clothes. Tanny did right by you! Now, follow me!”
When I finally hear his voice in the corridor, I throw off the cloak and quickly arrange myself so that I’m sitting in his chair with my feet kicked up onto his desk, legs crossed at the ankles. I spare a moment to place the photo of the entire Weasley clan face down. They don’t need to watch what’s about to happen. (I turn the one of us on our wedding day to give photo Harry-and-Draco a
Draco’s cheeks darken a bit, but he responds quickly to Harry. “I am never overly dramatic. I am only ever the proper amount of dramatic.”
“But you don’t tell each other ‘I love you,’” Teddy points out. “Don’t you two love each other? Aren’t we a family that loves each other?” Teddy’s little eyebrows rise on his forehead, demanding an answer.
“Circe’s perky left … Malfoy?!” Potter looked just as shocked to see Draco was to see him. And he, bastard that he was, looked incredible. His black, wavy hair had been given some sort of direction so it looked more ‘tousled’ than ‘rat’s nest’, and his tan skin seemed to glow in the afternoon light. He’d upgraded his spectacles since Hogwarts and was now sporting plastic black lenses that suited his angular jaw line, which was darkened by at least a day’s worth of stubble. The blue apron that he wore over a fitted shirt and plain denims did nothing to hide the fact that he’d filled out from a malnourished, exhausted teenager to a grown man. His shoulders were broad and he looked as if he’d even grown taller.
He’d sent Astoria to gather Scorpius this morning at the Potter residence. He knew it was taking the coward’s way out, but he didn’t think that he could manage to actually look the man in the eye yet.
There were twelve different sections in the binder, each denoted by a large, labeled tab. The menu, guest list, decorations - everything had been meticulously thought out and then organized and stored. Given this experience, Harry was sure that Draco would be a complete nutter when it came to planning a wedding.
“Kreacher makes me breakfast in the kitchen while Draco has coffee and we listen to our morning music and sometimes we dance to get all of our wiggles out. Then Harry comes down because he’s not a morning person like Draco so he’s always a bit late but he makes sure I’m at school on time before he goes to work at the Ministry of Magic.
Harry and Draco both open their mouths to speak, but Karamo holds up his hand. “Teddy, can you tell us more about that feeling?”
“Fuck right off, Potter. You know you love me.” Pansy stalked over to the kitchen island, not a strand of hair out of place. “Are we pretending that I didn’t just hear that you two are fucking engaged?”
“Oh, you’re no fun!” complained Pansy. “I can promise that Draco would be absolutely delighted to see your massive cock. He’s the biggest size queen in the greater London area! And I think we all know he’d be perfectly happy to have you -” Pansy was cut off by Blaise’s hand coming to cover her mouth.
Harry chuckled and began to undress. His left foot got caught in his denims and he struggled to stay upright, crashing into the bedframe. “Ow! Bugger!” He cursed, righting himself. He looked up to see Malfoy struggling not to laugh at him as he pulled up his own flannel pajama bottoms.
Draco smiled at their reflections: he was on all fours, waiting for Harry to push into him. He bit his lip and watched as Harry took himself in hand and positioned his cock before entering him slowly.
“Harry?” I ask, suddenly worried that I’ve gotten this all completely, horribly wrong. “Are… is this OK?”
All at once, Malfoy began to spasm around Harry’s fingers, and strips of white cum painted the dormitory door. Malfoy screamed in pleasure while Harry gently lapped at his hole, helping him ride out his orgasm.
The man peered at Harry for a moment before he reached into his trousers and pulled a handkerchief out. He passed it to Harry and said, “Matzo ball soup. That’s what you need.” He strode back over to the silver door and pushed it open, sticking his head in and shouting, “Sophia! We have a matzo ball emergency!” With the man’s back turned Harry took the opportunity to wipe at his eyes with the cloth, feeling both grateful and embarrassed. A moment later a petite old woman wearing a floral dress and a blue apron came rushing out of the door. She was wiping her hands on the apron as she came behind the counter, speaking a language Harry didn’t know. “Ton nit shrayen in mir alter kaker!”
“Wait, no! I thought -” Harry began, but it was Draco’s turn to hold up his hand to stop Harry from speaking.
[More hugs go around. The scene cuts to show Draco, Harry, and Teddy waving goodbye from their front door. The Fab Five pile into their SUV and drive off.]
“That’s our cue to leave you be for the night!” Tan says, standing up from where he’s sitting at the table. “Thanks for your hospitality. I can’t wait to continue this journey with you two!”
“Dads! You’re being complete nutters. Karamo just told us how to communicate with each other!” Teddy stomps into the room, standing between Draco and Harry. “You’re in love and you want to kiss all the time so you should have the same bedroom. That way you can do that gross staring at each other thing and it’s easier if I have a bad dream ‘cause I can just come to one room to get cuddles.”
Draco laughed. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have set her on you this morning. But I couldn’t face you, and it was either her or my mother. I assumed you’d rather have Astoria at your door than Narcissa Malfoy.”
Harry pulled Ginny into as best a hug as he could manage with an 11 month old child strapped to his chest. “Bye, Gin.” Al and Jamie grabbed a hand on either side of their father, and together the four of them walked back through the barrier and out into King’s Cross.
Harry smiled and shook his head. “I was jealous of you, then. You were so comfortable in the knowledge that you were a wizard, and that you were headed off to a boarding school that you’d been preparing for your whole life. And I just stood there, hoping you wouldn’t notice that I had no idea what was going on and that every time I saw someone perform magic I think I actually jumped a bit. And then we got to school, and you were a giant prat.” Everyone laughed. Draco blushed an even deeper shade of pink.
Bobby makes a sound of agreement. “Ok everyone, let’s get ready to get down and dirty with the United Kingdom’s brightest wizarding hero and his one true love!”
“If you hurt him, though, you know I’ll fucking kill you. I’ve done things for that bloke that most people wouldn’t dream of. And I have a whole arsenal of others ready to hide your ferrety body if you step out of line.” Ron smiled. “So. Yeah. Don’t fuck this up.”
“Thank you so much for telling us how you’re feeling, Teddy,” Harry leans forward and scratches behind Troggy’s ears while he talks. “You can always come to one of us, or to both of us, any time. Day or night. Rain or shine. We’re here for ya, kiddo.”
PS my Aunt Hermione wrote this but I told her what to write so if there are spelling mistakes then they are her fault. I am a very good speller.”
“You are entirely correct, as always, Saul. May I suggest we move on to Scorpius before I have to take him to his mother’s?” said Draco.
“OK, so, Harold! Tell mama what’s going on with this mop. I mean, obvi the unruly curls are your trademark, but what’s the deal with this gravity-defying ...thing?” Jonathan finishes with a question. He’s stood behind Harry, who’s sitting in a stylist’s chair, looking at him through the large mirror that’s on the wall opposite.
[Footage shows Draco and Teddy taking coffee and biscuits to Harry and visiting with him at his desk in the Ministry. Draco glares at the camera periodically.]
“I can’t speak for Harry,” Jonathan says, continuing to snip here and there with his shears. “But from where I’m standing, what you two have going on is not one-sided. Have you ever thought about telling him you like-like him with your whole heart?”
Granger nodded. “Yes, well, I always thought that if I saw you again I’d hex your bollocks off. But here we are, you with testicles intact.”
The next afternoon, Harry and Malfoy sat in the shade near the cabins washing the pottery they had unearthed that day. Harry had to admit that when he heard he’d be going on an archaeological excavation he’d assumed it’d be somehow….sexier? He imagined that he’d be digging up all manner of treasures, maybe even battling complicated curses that ancient wizards had placed on their tombs. After Ron went to Egypt before second year and told him all about the complex muggle-repelling hexes and Dark Objects that were now housed in museums, he’d gotten his hopes up. Instead, it seemed like archaeology was a lot more about sorting through fragments of broken clay vessels while keeping meticulous notes and a lot less about battling unspeakable ancient evils.
“These are iconic!” Jonathan screeches, twirling around. “My cousin had a poster of you wearing one of these! I think it must’ve been during your Hogwarts years because you hadn’t grown into your shoulders yet. And boy have you filled out, you gorgeous hunk!” Jonathan winks.
“Yeah, you’re right, Hermione. This is just too bloody much for anyone to take.” Harry stood up and marched over to the large bay windows that overlooked the lake. Draco Malfoy was currently bent over double on top of a large purple mat, his arms outstretched so that he formed an inverted V-shape. His blond hair was gathered into a knot at the top of his head, and he was clad in thin black joggers and a tight long-sleeved shirt. His eyes were closed, and he appeared to be concentrating deeply.
[B-roll of a Teddy pulling up red knee-length socks and straightening his tie plays while Teddy’s voiceover continues.]
(Harry had said as much to Draco as his alarm went off that very morning and was met with a groan of “coffee first, then sentiment!” and pillow to the face instead of the kiss he had expected. His beloved was
Saul, still grasping Draco’s hand, beamed at him. “Ah, so this is Draco Malfoy!” Draco blanched and looked back at Potter, who had his put hands over his eyes, a blush rising on his neck. Dudley laughed again.
you for other men. I’m going to ride that big cock of yours until you forget your own name.” Harry’s stomach flipped.
“Are you sure this is how you want to do this, Harry?” Ginny asked, reaching out to grab a handful of the back of Al’s shirt as he tried to launch himself at his brother.
Harry’s eyes grow comically large. “Err, tension? What? We’re not lovers! There’s no steam!” He splutters.
.” Harry throws the robes on the small sofa and takes several steps forward before stopping suddenly. “Is this—did I forget a holiday? Or an anniversary?” He asks, looking concerned.
But sometime later, as Draco lay gasping beneath Harry, he whispered, “I’m glad you found your way to me, too.”
Harry took two steps forward and put his large, warm hands on Draco’s hips. “You’ve wanted to kiss me since we were fifteen?” He asked, smiling. “So, that bloke who you’ve been in love with ...?”
“Hello, Albus,” Draco said, putting a hand on his son’s shoulder to stop him from running off. “Scorpius and I came early to help you prepare for all your guests. Why don’t we ask your father what we can do to help?”
“Nope! I’ve put up with your archaeological bullying for two sodding weeks, Draco. I’m done. You’re mine, and I’m going to take you back to your cabin, ravish you until you’re incoherent, and then we’re going to finish drawing the top plan of our trench.”
“Speaking of knickers,” Malfoy continued, “You should see me in a pair of stockings and a garter belt. I’ve got the best legs in Slytherin.”
A few catcalls and cheers rang out around the room, while a lone voice yelled “bloody hell! You’re getting married?! Fucking cheers, boys!”
Draco shrugs. “I’m sure they’ve seen worse than the saviour of the wizarding world snogging his boyfriend.”
“We try to always have dinner together, but sometimes Harry has to work late or Draco is trying to finish a potion so we don’t get to every night.  But mostly we eat as a family. Kreacher cooks but also Harry and Draco help because sometimes Kreacher forgets ingredients because he is very old.”
(And if Harry’s dreams had begun to feature blond, lithe men with ridiculously expressive eyebrows and soft grey eyes, then that was his business. And his right hand’s.)
“I can’t wait to plan their wedding!” Tan says excitedly. “Do you think we could do a special episode? How long before one of them proposes?”
[Harry interview/confessional: Of course, I mean, Draco is an adult! He can wear whatever he wants! I just wasn’t expecting to see … those.
Draco opens his mouth to respond, but Jonathan claps his hands together and shouts, “Let’s get this party started!”
“And, right, sorry for the mess. We’re in the midst of a renegotiation of chores.” Harry tried to set Lily down but she let out a cry and clutched at her father. He sighed and straightened up, still holding his youngest.
Saul pushed back his chair to stand as Draco hurried over to him to shake his hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir. Your establishment is extraordinary. I think I’ve tried most of the menu and I’ve enjoyed it all.”
His arms were shaking, but Harry controlled his movements so that he didn’t shove into Draco all at once. Little by little he pushed in, his dick enveloped slowly by the tight heat. Finally, he was fully seated in Draco, the curls of his dark pubic hair resting against Draco’s entrance. Malfoy’s erection had wilted, and so he grasped Draco’s shaft and gently pulled, glad that his hands were still covered in lube. He leaned down to press kisses to Draco’s chest and neck, biting at his collarbone and sucking on his earlobe, waiting for Draco to adjust to the sensation of being filled.
“Come on Harry, fuck me. Fuck my tight little hole. I want you to make me come all over myself because I’m such a little slut for you.”
“Are you in love with me, though? More than as … as two men who share a son and are trying to keep a family together and have thus spent many years in close proximity might love each other?”
“Don’t say that, Teddy!” Draco calls over his shoulder. “I don't want you to leave for Hogwarts a day earlier than you absolutely have to. I can hardly believe you’re going to be eight years old.”
!” The last time Albus and Scorpius had carried out an “experiment”, the upstairs toilet had been unusable until a plumber came to fish what turned out to be an entire (dismembered) Barbie doll out from the pipes. Draco and Harry agreed that they didn’t want to dampen their children’s’ creativity, but he wasn’t sure how much abuse the old home could weather.
“Harry! Don’t use magic in here! You know it makes the coffee maker wonky,” Draco admonished, going to check the status of his beloved machine.
“It’s fine, really,” said Draco as he helped his son into his coat. “Scorpius loves the Underground. And if I’m honest, Floo-travel always makes me queasy.”
Ron swallowed. “Listen, mate,” he began, a serious expression on his face. “I know we’ve had our troubles in the past. I never liked you, and I’ve always been jealous of your easy friendship with Hermione. You two operate on a different field than the rest of us mere mortals.” Draco raised his eyebrows, taken aback at the honesty Ron was doling out.
Hermione looked up to stare at her boyfriend, who was holding the pieces of a broken quill in his clenched fists. “Ronald…” she began.
I invested in a black ensemble, as I figured that it would present the most stark contrast with my pale skin. The silk, thigh-high stockings are topped with lace and have a seam running up the back of the legs, which the woman at the shop assured me would make my legs look longer and leaner than they already are. I have to admit that the stilettos that I’ve managed to jam my feet into accentuate my calf muscles nicely (although I’ll be lucky if my toes aren’t currently bleeding). I chose the garter belt that sits around my hips because of the small bows on the clips that hold up the stockings—they seemed to add something almost demure to the otherwise completely wanton display. And after careful consideration, I decided to wear the lace panties that Pansy had gifted me, as they seemed to have quite the effect on Harry.
“Albus Severus Potter get down here right now! I need you and your brother to finish setting the table because Jamie only put out plates!”
“So, in Judaism, there’s this idea of finding one’s ‘destined,’ called b’shert. Saul always refers to Sophia as his soulmate, as the one that God had intended for him. Sophia would always roll her eyes and smile and tell him that it was quite the universe if God wanted them to go through a war just to find each other,” Harry laughed softly, his eyes shining. “I used to think that Ginny was my destiny, you know? That she was the one that the universe - or God, or however you want to imagine a sort of higher power - had chosen for me. That we, like Saul and Sophia, had endured a war and had still come together. But we never had what they had. Gin and I fit together neatly, and we had a nice marriage. Our children are the light of my life. But sometimes I think that I’d like to fall in love someday. To really fall in love. To feel the type of love that people write novels about. And if you’ve found that, then I think that’s really special. And I also think it’s unique. Not everyone has the chance to find their missing piece, you know?”
Draco didn’t respond. He didn’t know what to say to Harry; he didn’t know how to communicate that his situation wasn’t pleasant or special but was actually painful and often sad.
To stave off his impending organsm, he concentrated on watching the expressions that crossed Draco’s face, wanting to catalogue every groan and brow furrow. Harry pulled Draco up and into his lap so that they were both sitting straight up, Draco’s legs wrapped around the outsides of Harry’s thighs.
Harry collapses more on top of me than next to me, given that there are two grown men trying to share a loveseat. We’re quiet for a while. I stroke his hair and he presses kisses to whatever parts of me he can reach.
“No, Hermione, it’s ridiculous! They can’t just pretend that’s acceptable behavior in a common area! I should never be subjected to that much of Harry’s arse!” He gestured over towards the bay window, where Harry and Draco had at one time been practicing yoga together, but had apparently devolved into fevered snogging on their mats in the past five minutes.
[Scene cuts to the Loft, where all five of the guys are in various levels of distress, crying and mopping at their tears.]
[Jonathan, Bobby, Karamo, Antoni, and Tan are all standing awkwardly, watching the back and forth between Harry and Draco play out. Troggy yips from where he’s sitting in Antoni’s arms.]
Draco began to lift himself up and down on Harry’s cock while he pulled furiously at his own erection with his right hand. “Yeah, you like this Harry? Do you like it when I ride your giant cock?” Malfoy spoke to Harry while he looked directly into his eyes. “I want you to fill me up with your come, Potter.” He punctuated this statement by clenching the muscles in arse, causing Harry’s orgasm to rip through him unexpectedly. “Bloody hell!” Harry yelled, squeezing Draco’s hips with his fingers while his own jerked up and down slightly, riding out his orgasm.
I smirk and turn around, throwing my arms around his neck. “Have at me,” I tell him before I lean in and kiss him.
“Mate, you literally stalked him for our entire sixth year. Everyone with eyes was on to your obsession!” Ron called out.
Sophia leaned over and patted his hand. “Thank you, Harry, for everything you did. Look at you, not even a man and setting the world back to rights? Ess! Eat some more soup. You’re skin and bones, kemfer.”
“I know!” Teddy looks at Karamo. “I know my dads love me. They write it in my birthday cards and Harry said it to me on Christmas.”
“Let’s do this thing!” Jonathan yells after a moment, jumping into the air. “We have our orders, boys! Ooooh, I never thought I’d be in the army but she can work some camo! Trust!” He begins stomping down the street in an imitation march.
Harry pulls out a plain-looking envelope and hands it to Teddy. “You have to open it carefully,” he explains, using his wand to magically clean Teddy’s sticky fingers. “We only have one copy of that for now.”
I cocked my head, trying to suss out what was causing him to act like a 12-year old who’d been caught wanking. It wasn’t like Harry to be prudish about sex—at least, not since I’d blasted away those walls a decade ago with my refusal to accept his nervous stammers when discussing our sex life—but it seemed that this particular lingerie-related kink was something that made Harry uncomfortable.
“Don’t play coy with me, young man. Look, you have the bone structure of a Grace Jones and David Bowie love child so you certainly don’t need to hide behind your hair. I’m going to give you some texture and show you some ideas for styling it so that the next time you and Harry want to have a night on the town, he won’t be able to take his eyes off of you!”
Harry had turned to Hermione, hoping that she might commiserate with his experience with Malfoy. “Don’t look at me, Harry. Pansy doesn’t mind doing all the excavating; in fact she’s quite adept with a trowel. And she always compliments my recording techniques. Have you ever noticed how nice her hands are?” Harry didn’t have an answer to that, so he looked around at the rest of the table. All of his classmates appeared to be enjoying themselves on this project. He and Malfoy were apparently the only ones who couldn’t find a rhythm.
“Oh, he did tell me. I just didn’t realise that you’d have stayed … but, hey! Here you are. And please, call me Ginny.” She held a freckled hand out to Draco and smiled, if a bit tightly.
Draco winked and sat up, grabbing the lube from his bedside table. He opened the cap and spread some onto his fingers, rising up onto his knees so that he could reach back for his hole before squeezing a bit more out and looking at Harry expectantly. “You ready?”
“Who’s staring at who’s arse?” asked Lily, running into the kitchen with her homework folder clutched in her hands. Draco thought that she looked like some sort of Dickensian orphan: the long plait that he had so carefully woven her red hair into this morning was fighting a losing battle to keep her unruly curls off of her face, her jumper was falling off of one shoulder and was covered in what he assumed (hoped) was paint splatter, and her leggings had a hole in one knee that definitely hadn’t been there before school.
Draco’s attitude towards muggles and their world had changed drastically in the years following the war. While his father was given a life sentence in Azkaban, he and his mother were sentenced to two years house arrest and ordered to do community service with the newly formed Muggle Liaison Service. They were directed to clean up muggle parks and green spaces in an attempt, he thought, to humiliate them; they were also forced to take part in a series of seminars called “Understanding Muggles: How to Stop Thinking Like a Bigot and Start Being a Decent Human.” Despite the fact that he was forced to take the Mark in order to keep his parents alive, and despite the resentment and hatred he felt towards the Dark Lord, he had held onto the belief that had been instilled in him since he could walk: that wizards were superior to muggles in every sense.
Tan mimes flipping his hair behind his shoulders, smiling. “Let’s wait and see what Mr Potter decides on wearing. He was the real challenge - once Draco saw how his own arse looked in Muggle trousers I could tell he’d never go back to those dowdy robes.”
Draco laughed at that, shaking his head. “I’ve already married one woman I didn’t want to shag, I’m not going through that again.”
“Why are you crying? Is it that bad? Oh, Merlin. Please, Draco, don’t let this ruin our family! I’ll get over it. I prmmmph…” Harry’s voice breaks off, and the sound of fabric being pushed into the microphones that both men are wearing on their shirts is heard, along with the distinct sound of lips smacking against each other.
“Mr. Harry sure seems to like spending time with you,” Scorpius said as he and Draco walked towards the Underground station.
“Can I ask about how you two came to have this arrangement? With both of you as guardians of Teddy?” Bobby questions, helping himself to another Jaffa cake.
“Well, maybe a Healer could transfigure the right bits. Is that what two wizards do when they want to have a baby?” Scorpius asked and turned to face Harry and Draco.
Harry waved his hand dismissively. “Hermione’s already cleared your way. She’s been warning us that she’d convince you one of these days to accept one of her invitations to this or that event, so we’ve all been expecting it to happen eventually. Ron calls you the ‘silent spouse’ in his marriage, by the way. He’s half certain she’s going to leave him for you.”
“I swear to Merlin if you three don’t start cooperating you’re all going to lose screen time for the next year!” Harry yelled, forgetting he was holding a spatula and not his wand so the summoning charm he tried to cast at the comic book failed.
“Oh yes queen! Look at how elegant she looks!” Jonathan yells, clapping his hands. “No-maj fashion agrees with that body. Tan you’re a genius!”
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Malfoy suddenly looked rather angry. “You’ve wanted to kiss me for the past two years, and you’re only now doing something about it? You fucking coward! You took down the Dark Lord and you couldn’t admit to wanting to snog me? We could’ve been shagging this entire year!” Malfoy closed the gap between the two of them and unceremoniously pressed his lips to Harry’s.
Draco coughed pointedly and continued, “As I was saying! The latke committee is assembling at exactly noon…”
“You wanted to shield me from a six year old?” Draco asked. He uncrossed his legs and sat forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “A fucking six year old? Do you know what names I’ve been called in my life? What names I’ve heard bandied about regarding our relationship? Hearing you called ‘The Chosen Fairy’ doesn’t make the top twenty. It’s not even creative!”
Harry nods and carefully picks Teddy up from the sofa. He wakes up but allows himself to be carried.
Harry was dumbstruck. That might be the nicest thing that Malfoy had ever said to him, even if it did include the threat of violence to other humans. “Erm, thanks, Malfoy.”
“Hullo. I’m Scorpius. I’m five and a half. Are you five? We look like we’re the same age. What are you drawing?”
“I have to admit, Malfoy, that’s not what I’d expected you to say. But if that’s all you have to say to me, then no, I don’t want to discuss anything with you. Please bugger off. I’ll look into the potions.”
Draco stood in the deli feeling like he had just been hit with the full body-bind curse. He hadn’t laid eyes on Harry Potter since his trial had taken place in the month following the war, but he’d thought of him nearly every day. Draco knew that he was in love with Harry - he’d accepted this fact in the middle of their fifth year at Hogwarts - but it had taken him several years to stop hating himself for it. Realising he was gay was one thing, but realising that he wanted to push his self-proclaimed arch nemesis into the nearest alcove and snog him senseless was something else entirely. He had a recurring nightmare in which, after being rescued from the burning Room of Requirement, he tried to embrace Potter and was immediately thrown back into the flames by his disgusted saviour.
But that also means that I remember all of the experiences and gestures and gifts that we’ve shared. The first time that Harry smiled at me, our first kiss; how many different pet-names he’s bestowed upon me.
If there was an establishment that warranted this level of customer loyalty just steps from his lab, he reasoned that he ought to try it. Draco nodded absently and stepped in line, surreptitiously casting a gentle warming charm on himself and his companions. “Huh! Must be a vent somewhere giving us some warm air.” The young man looked up and around him, searching for the source of the warmth. Finding nothing, he shrugged and busied himself on his mobile device.
“Mmm,” Draco said noncommittally and glancing around the room for Harry. Somehow, in a house teeming with people, Draco had found himself alone with Ron. He clicked his engagement ring on the stem of his wine glass absently, hoping he would be saved by someone else joining the table.
“Harry, Draco. Let me ask you two a question. Were your families affectionate when you were younger? Did your parents tell you they loved you very often?” Karamo asks.
He jumped in surprise at the sound of my voice and dropped the knickers like they were on fire. “Draco! Er, hello, love! How was the party?” He sat on the bed and crossed his legs as if he were trying to hide his obvious arousal from me.
“To make it up to me, I want you to accio the lube over here. Wordlessly. Wandlessly.” Draco was now sitting up on Harry’s hips, smirking with his arms crossed over his chest.
“Excuse me, but what are you queueing for?” he asked one of the young men he almost walked into moment before.
Jonathan waltzes across the room with Tan. “I never want to leave this room! I live here now!” Jonathan declares. “It’s so homey and perfect for your cosy family.”
“It’s no problem, you know that. And Ron told me to remind you that he’s bringing the apple sauce so not to bother with that store bought stuff. He’s made at least four variations this year, so make sure to compliment all of them - he didn’t come to bed until two this morning because he kept tinkering with the cinnamon ratios.” Hermione leaned a hip against the island. “I wouldn’t say no to a cup of coffee, actually, boys. I know I’m supposed to be off caffeine but I just need a quick fix.”
“Get back to me when he starts asking questions about sex,” Harry sighed, thinking of Jamie’s progressively more difficult-to-answer queries.
“Looks like you had a successful morning!” Karamo says. He’s reclining and wearing a black sequined bomber jacket and tight jeans. “Take a load off and join our picnic. I’m sure Tanny forced you to work up an appetite.”
A knock at the bedroom door causes the two to jump apart. Harry’s eyes widen as he looks directly at the camera. “Bloody hell, I completely forgot the world was watching us!”
“In all seriousness, I really can’t thank you lot enough for what you’ve done for our family. It’s been life-changing.” Harry looks around at the assembled group. “Our relationship with Teddy is better than it’s ever been, and who knows what it would’ve taken to get me and Draco to this point without that salon chair and Jonathan’s subtle manipulations.”
"What would you like to discuss, headmaster?" She would be polite for the time being, it wouldn't look good if she were rude. Might even be suspicious.
Professor Sprout looked taken aback at the respect in the dark haired girls voice, If she hadn't judged them far too quickly then she would have known that most of Slytherin were a respectful bunch. She gave the young lady a hesitant smile, maybe she wasn't so bad after all. "Well, by all means, please. Make yourselves comfortable. When the others arrive then class shall commence."
That question was bothering her deeply. She wouldn't want to hurt those that were like her but if the need comes, well rules were meant to be broken. Even she was prone to that.
Maeve sat in an empty seat near the door, Draco beside her, Theo and Blaise in the desk behind them and Daphne sat beside Neville who moved from his previous seat next to Lavender Brown, a perky gryffindor that Maeve remembered from the sorting. She didn't seem bothered by the nervous boy leaving her, instead another girl sat beside her, a pretty indian that had a rich brown skin tone. Despite being in 'rival' houses, Maeve couldn't deny her obvious beauty.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Maeve's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Maeve's forehead.
To Maeve Alarica Potter, I leave everything I have in your possession. My manors, money, and all my Wizengmont seats. I hope you know how proud your parents and I are of you.
Several first years flinched at the loud noise and some fifth years had drawn their wands as an act to protect themselves from any oncoming harm. If she hadn't been so irked she might've applauded them for their quick thinking, but annoyance slipped off her body like a tsunami. Maeve glanced around searching for her friends, she really needed their presence. Despite it being only a few days of them knowing each other, they were like a ray of sunshine on her darkest days.
Before she could reply, someone from behind her cleared their throat. "Ms. Potter, we should be heading back."
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
She’d return in two days to retrieve her clothing and then she would get her wand, it’s not like she needed it at the moment. Her magic never needed a stick to do as she asked, Magic was free and shouldn't need anything trying to contain it. Something to look forward to in the future.
A lady with soft features and blonde hair pulled into a neat bun was present behind the counter, Maeve placed the basket upon the empty counter and allowed the woman to look through them.
"Say Zabini, do you happen to know if we get our schedules today? Malfoy and I weren't mentally present last night during our warm welcoming from the two upper years." Malfoy snorted in an undignified manner, Maeve snickered under her breath.
"Well, first I'd like to know, in your opinion, why this class was named Defense Against the Dark Arts?"
Dumbledore looked on with rapt attention, Potter had defined the Slytherin hierarchy while only being a first year, this will not do. Her having power over the Slytherins will get in his way of control and that will not do. He will simply have to sway her to his side, after all it is for the greater good.
"Why?" Her horse faced aunt asked miffed. Maeve refrained from rolling her eyes. "So that I could get a head start." -because unlike your son, I actually do the work and pass.- Petunia huffed, before dismissing her with her hand.
Maeve had noticed that the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy that stood in front of her, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
"If I must, Draco would you be a dear and write a letter to your father? Have him get in contact with me, we have much to discuss. And Blaise and Theo, try not to get into too much trouble. We have a reputation to uphold, after all." She smiled sweetly at them as they nodded to her orders.
"That's rubbish! Being Slytherin means being ambitious with something to prove! Don't they remember that Merlin, the greatest wizard of all time, was a bloody Slytherin? And he wasn't accused of being dark and evil!" She snarled in anger. "Where is the suppose equality that old nutter talked about!?"
She narrowed her green eyes and smirked, assured of her answer. She pointed to the left first. "That's Fred," she looked to the right, not giving Fred a chance to refute her claim. "And that one is George." Both twins looked shell-shocked, jaws slacked and eyes widen. "Now, I am certain I am correct and I'd appreciate your assistance already."
"Would you care to join me here?" She politely asked leaving room to decline. Having already sat down and soft red cushions she peered at him curiously. Malfoy gave a slight quirk of his lips, obviously pleased at being invited inside her compartment.
Maeve rubbed her fingertips along the smooth spine of the book, she sighed in content. Her love for books was something she could never figure out. Was it because while reading she never felt alone? Or was it because your favorite characters never truly leave you? Or was it something deeper? She didn't know nor did she particularly care, she just enjoyed it and nothing could take away her pleasure.
The most dangerous woman of all is the one who refuses to rely on your sword to save her because she carries her own.
The redhead turned with a glare that burned out when he made eye contact with the furious raven haired girl. Despite being much shorter, he felt like she was towering over him, he gulped in fear. Though he'd be no brave soon to be Gryffindor if he showed it, so in an act to cover his wounded ego, he puffed his chest. "I don't take orders from little girls." He spat.
Diagon Alley? Goblins? Maeve figured these lots were a bit crazy, she placed the paper down and reached for her own, having bought her parchment yesterday night.
The trip to Kingscross wasn't very long or eventful. The Dursleys stayed as quiet as possible, they tried hard not to disturb Maeve. Said girl was merely thinking about Hogwarts. The magic school separates from different houses, as told by Hogwarts: a history.
Maeve watched amusingly as he scurried up the steps leading to the boys hallway. Boys were such malleable puppets, so simple-minded and controllable. It was almost laughable.
"I've already said you were both mine and I do not take kindly to those that try to degrade and humiliate what is mine." Maeve spoke calmly, her green eyes never leaving the professors table.
"We can start with the abandonment of the girl who lived. After all, who leaves a child, barely a year old, with a family of magic hating muggles and then refuses to believe said child when she says she's being 'abused'?" She says with a wicked smirk, green eyes glinting dangerously. Loki hissed in cruel amusement. "Imagine the fall of The Great Wizard Albus Dumbledore! The public will be dubious and easy to mold. I'll come along and give them something to believe in, I am the one who saved them, after all." She smiled.
Almost instantly, she felt in reach out and wrap itself around her. She smiled as she opened her eyes. It was in the center of two buildings, remaining hidden in the shadows.
Daphne leaned forward and tapped the shorter girl on the shoulder before whispering, "Do you think since Draco is the godson of professor Snape we should let his father know of the treatment if it gets out of hand?"
Green eyes drifted towards the burning red-orange flames, it was almost hypnotizing. The lovely colors reflected beautifully over emerald orbs. Rosy lips curled into a stunning smile, taking the breath away of those present around her.
Pointing her wand forward and twirling it in its correct hand movement, Maeve said, "Lumos." A bright light appeared at the tip of her wand and she slightly smirked at Flitwicks awe. For the counter-charm, Maeve made a movement as though drawing a single wave in the air and she said, "Nox." The light vanished.
"Well, first, did you know about your godfather betraying you and your family?" George asked hesitantly, he watched her carefully for any signs of discomfort.
"Gringotts first." She whispered to herself. Loki shifted slightly as he peaked his head out from her sleeves. He looked to also be in a state pf wonderment.
The young girl hid a scowl and mentally scoffed, -this old biddy thinks she has the right to reprimand me when she was the one out of line in the first place?-
The redhead on the left had a small mole beneath his right eyebrow and the other twin had a tad bit more freckles splattered across the bridge of his nose and cheekbones. George was on the left and Fred was on the right if the way they addressed each other was anything to go buy. She watched as Fred smirked, she got the feeling he was planning something and hopefully nothing that would put her in harms way for their sake.
Theo was happy for his friend to finally have a real family member by her side, he'd heard snippets of how her life with her muggle relatives was and he would really prefer she never go back. Thinking back to when she mentioned her talking to Dumbledore, he knew something must have happened to upset her greatly. The look in her eyes was down right murderous, Theo hoped he was wrong. Despite knowing he'd follow Maeve to the ends of the earth, he didn't really know if they would be able to get away with murder, especially if it was the headmaster who would die.
"Oh, Maeve! There you are, I've been searching for you!" Coming to a stop in front of the four Slytherins was the bushy haired Gryffindor who had been insulted by the young Weasley boy. She smiled revealing two large front teeth. "I've been meaning to speak to you about--"
She made it to classroom 4F, the teacher was said to be a ghost who died in his sleep, professor Binns. Hopefully, he could teach her the necessities to get around the wizarding world. She was the first student to arrive and made her way to the back, picking a seat and making sure the table stayed empty for Zabini and Nott. Malfoy would be sitting beside her as he was the first one she met.
"Please, Weasley, I wouldn't talk when obviously your parents still can't afford decent clothing. Would you like me to donate some of mine?" Malfoy replied, with a smirk but his eyes held a promise of pain.
"We finally have DADA, it'll be with Gryffindors, unfortunately." Draco mumbled, his hatred for the lions was a well known fact. Maeve let out an amused huff, class was sure to be interesting now. Especially since the lions were known for their lack of tact, they'd probably start yelling when one of her snakes lets out a sarcastic comment.
The tall, blonde man opened the door and allowed her to step in first. "Albus, I hope you don't mind letting us use the fireplace. It'd make our trip far more easy." He drawled with a cool tone.
Maeve tightly gripped Marge's pudgy face in her small hand, "Do you understand?" Her mouth twisted into a sardonic smile, eyes shining with amusement. She released the hag before turning to her aunt and uncle. "Petunia, I'll be needing a ride into London tomorrow. I do hope you're not busy."
The nursery room door was blasted open. Lord Voldemort, a man with serpent features stood at the entrance glaring at the defiant woman. "Stand aside and I shall spare you!" He ordered, trying to keep his word to a loyal deatheater. The redhead woman shook her head, tears forming in her brilliant green eyes.
"Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Maeve noticed redhead twins catcalling, she supposed they must also be Weasleys.
She pushed open the small door and hunched over to walk out. Her cousin, Dudley, stomped down the stairs. He shoved her out the way and headed to the kitchen where aunt Petunia was shuffling about.
"He seems the type to be scared of his own shadow, I wonder what subject he teaches."  Mused Zabini. Maeve narrowed her eyes at him when they made contact, something dark lurked around him. It gave her a migraine.
When everyone else had arrived, professor Sprout began her lessons. Class went on without a hitch. Maeve and her little group were actually surprised with the amount of loyalty their house had shown them, she assumed it was because of the display of power and magic she had shown back in the common room. She knew the snakes valued self-preservation above everything else, so with more power meant more protection. They knew who to follow when it came to power, and if it happened to the girl who lived then so be it.
"Good morning, I've come to let you know I'm headed out. I'll be going to the library, you don't have to wait on me for dinner as I'll be out late," She said with a faux smile. "Oh, and like I've warned before don't try leaving because I will find you. Remember Vernon, I own you." She giggled, waving and leaving them to themselves.
thank you to those who have stopped by and read, leaving a comment or Kudos. I appreciate you all xx
She led them to an empty compartment before bothering to introducing herself. Malfoy stuck his hand out, giving her the option of accepting it like a proper gentleman. She smiled sweetly. "I'm Maeve Potter." Her voice had an airy tilt to it.
A squat little witch with a patched hat over her flyaway hair stepped into view, she was professor Sprout, the head of Hufflepuff house. The three students knew they were quiet early, especially by the look on her round face. She eyed their ties, emerald green, with a wary eye.
The young dark haired witch nodded, pleased with the answers she received much to her aunts relief. She motioned with her hand to lead the way, she had things to do than stand around. Fortunately, her relatives knew this and were quick to follow orders. Such good little pets.
§I ssshall name you Loki, norssse trickssster god. I have a feeling you'll be mossst missschievousss.§
"Yeah, it was made known the night of your attempted murder and then written in the daily prophet for the world to see. He was sentenced to life in Azkaban, our dad says there were rumors of him being sent with no trial." George explained.
Everyone sat down silently at tables, not even bothering to sit separately as before. And it was thanks to Maeve that it happened. No one but professor Flitwick knew what this mean, the older students will know as well. Despite the fact that Ravenclaw and Slytherin are more lax around each other, the house of snakes preferred not socializing much. The fact that they allowed others from a different house sit beside them was practically unheard of.  He knew this meant a big change was coming.
Maeve watched as the previously nervous man rushed up to the now free man with tears in his eyes. They enveloped each other in a tight hug, the green eyed girl let a soft smile curl at her lips.
Another goblin showed, sitting behind a beautiful mahogany desk. Large mountains of gold was behind him, she came to realize that goblins loved gold and would flaunt it any chance they got. With that information, she knew exactly how she'd be able to get her way should she need something from them.
She knew she had them hook, line, and sinker. The way they submitted to her pleas. The look in their eyes said everything.
She nodded goodbye to the gingers as she walked towards the Slytherin table, Draco left the seat beside him open for her. "Good morning. Sorry for arriving late, I was speaking to the twins."
The green eyed, raven haired girl only sighed exasperated, honestly couldn't this girl understand that her presence clearly isn't wanted any further? "Listen here you obnoxious little girl, I do not care for being respectful or obedient to a man who has tried to force a friendship upon me. Now, do be a good doll and leave me be, I've got things to do."
Maeve checked her work over and nodded approvingly. It all seemed in order. The other students were working in pairs. Dudley and Piers were mostly talking and laughing, their work laid forgotten.
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last-- "Potter, Maeve!"
Later on in the night as everyone settled into bed, Maeve was sat at her desk with the lamp on. Reading was a favorite pass-time for her, she read every chance she got. She could hardly wait for when she entered Hogwarts, imagining all the books they could possibly have.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
Maeve could feel Quirrells gaze on her, it seems she'd have to investigate this meek acting professor. No one was as they seemed and professor Quirrell appeared to have more secrets hidden beneath his turban than anyone knew. She'll have to find out and if it is a threat to her, well, she'd just break him until he forgets his own name.
She gently nudged Loki awake, a soft smile on her face. "Show time." She whispered quietly. Loki lifted his head and looked at her.
"Messrs Padfoot would like to say I told you so to messrs Moony that I had always said we'd be the best."
Before she could attempt to leave Dumbledore stopped her with a very fake grandfatherly smile. "Ms. Potter, please sit. I would like to see how well you've adjusted to returning to the magical world."
Draco rose to his feet. “Hello, Ms Weasley. My son Scorpius is here playing with your children. I would’ve thought Harry’d told you?” He glanced at Harry who was grabbing several toys off of the floor and throwing them into a bag.
“Are you fucking kidding me? You just cast wordlessly and wandlessly, you complete wanker. Do you have any inkling how hot that is?” Malfoy strode back over to Harry and grabbed his biceps, bringing their mouths together again. Harry groaned and guided his hands to Malfoy’s hips, bringing them flush together. Malfoy was a few centimeters taller than Harry, but the  difference was negligible, especially when they were pressed together head to toe. Malfoy broke the kiss to focus his attention on Harry’s neck, alternating between sucking and licking the tan skin. Harry took the opportunity to run his hands through Malfoy’s hair again, letting his nails scrape lightly against his scalp. Malfoy moaned, pressing his groin into Harry’s again.
Jonathan pushes forward. “Yes, little man!” He leans down to high five Teddy. “We’re here! Where are my two gorgeous bachelors?!”
Granger’s eyebrows were now making a valiant effort to disappear into her hairline. She looked absolutely shocked.
“I deserve all the credit that’s ever been given to any mortal, Granger. But to what are you referring in this instance?” Draco drawled from his prone position, carefully studying the reaction happening in the cauldron below him.
“Did you leave after the first war with Voldemort?” Harry asked, finally taking a bite of the rugelach. It was sweet and crunchy and perfect.
“If that’s OK with you, of course,” Draco adds, resting a hand on Teddy’s shoulder. “We would have to go to the Ministry and answer some questions and sign some more forms. But we want you to be
“Well if you’d come with us last month to the lecture on 1980’s muggle popular culture in North America then you’d also be in on the joke!” Hermione and Draco were both giggling now.
“Don’t change the subject, Mister Vanquisher of All Evil! Are you going to tell Draco you love him in a ‘I want to have your babies and hyphenate our last names and buy a summer home on Fire Island type of way’?”
“Hermione, would you please stop referencing the size of Harry’s dick all the time?” Ron pleaded with his girlfriend, leaning over Pansy to take her hand. “It’s enough to give a bloke a complex!”
“So, Teddy nominated his two dads, and his Aunt Hermione also wrote a letter of support. She is a very thorough woman, and assured us that Harry and Draco are completely ‘head over heels’ for each other but won’t admit it. She also sent along sixteen pages of hand-written notes about Harry and Draco to help us.”
Harry got up, flicking off his friends and turning to go to back to his cabin and away from these horrible, horrible people.
“Careful, Malfoy, you wouldn’t want to strain yourself and accidentally compliment me,” Harry responds, amusement in his voice. He knocks his shoulder against Draco’s and smiles. “I’ll take distinguished, though.”
Draco placed a three-ring binder on the table in front of him and began to mete out papers with a complicated looking schedule printed on it. Harry glanced down at the binder and was again hit with a wave of love for Draco. His binder had become an ever-present accessory in the past few weeks, as he had begun planning the party the minute that Saul had suggested it as a way to have a “housewarming/formal blending of the families.” Harry also felt that it was important to establish new traditions with Draco and Scorpius in order to ingratiate them into the huge, crazy family that Harry had assembled over the years.
“Schmuck schmuck schmuck!” said Lily, kicking her stockinged feet back and forth beneath the chair while she drew. Jamie snorted, finally looking up from his book.
Loving Harry Potter is an exercise in self-restraint. Some days I want to throw the half-filled mugs of tepid tea he leaves all over the house at his giant head; I want to burn the old Chudley Cannons shirt that hasn’t fit him since Hogwarts that he continues to wear; I want to strangle him with the wet towels he leaves on the bathroom floor. I want to banish him to an island populated by a thousand Harry Potters so he is forced to experience the utter frustration of what it’s like to live with him.
“I expect your full report before we arrive back at school, gentleman!” Dr Song called out to them from where she was squatting in front of Ron and Tony’s trench. She raised her sunglasses and winked at them before turning back to her work.
Draco shrugs nonchalantly. “Well, he certainly looks less like he’s just rolled out of bed.” He clears his throat. “I suppose it’s a much more...distinguished look for him.”
This time Harry pulled back. “Get on the bed, Draco. All fours. Arse in the air for me. Now.” Draco shivered. He couldn’t get enough of Harry taking control like this. He complied and looked over his shoulder, waiting to see what would come next. In the past three or so years, Harry had become completely attuned to what Draco wanted and needed in bed. Gone were the days of Harry waiting for Draco to ask to be spanked or bent over the nearest flat surface and fucked.
Now, though, Harry was faced with a deep ache in his chest, a new sort of yearning that he’d never felt before. It was beyond a simple erotic desire for Draco - it was a need to see him in the kitchen every day, to wake up next to him and to kiss him goodnight. To see his smile and hear his sarcasm and experience his dry wit as often as possible. It took Harry’s breath away how much he wanted.
“Boychick, the Malfoys are here,” Saul called. Harry’s head snapped up and he turned around to see Scorpius and Draco standing in the doorway of the kitchen. Draco was holding a bottle of wine and looking incredibly handsome in his dark gray trousers and pale blue button down. He wasn’t a flashy dresser, but Draco always looked elegant and effortless. Scorpius was a miniature Draco, wearing dress pants and a dark blue shirt, looking around the kitchen curiously.
Teddy looks puzzled but sits on the sofa. He takes his task seriously, his eyebrows drawing together in concentration as he slowly unsticks the wax seal and pulls out a stack of papers. “What is this?” He asks Harry and Draco, who are seated on either side of him.
Harry rolled his eyes and Draco huffed indignantly. “I knew that woman was after you, Harry. She’s always leering at you and staring at your arse.”
“As you know, on Saturday night we’re having our first ever Wottfoy Hannukah Party. The festivities start at 6, but we need all hands on deck in the afternoon. Draco made a schedule of duties, and an assortment of Weasleys, Weasley-Grangers, and Dudley will be over early to help us set up.”
“Hello! Everyone! Can I please have your attention?” Harry yelled, waving his hands around to get the scattered members of his friends and family to focus on him.
Draco stopped clearing the table. He looked at Harry and sighed. “I’d say we’d have a shot if not for your ex-wife’s team cleaning the floor with us last week.” He sat back down, unsure if he was happy to spend more time with Harry or if he was being masochistic. Pansy would probably say the latter, and she was an infuriatingly good judge of Draco’s habits.
“Love you, Harry,” I say as he massages my poor, abused toes. Sometimes he makes it so easy for me to forget about the wet towels left on the bathroom floor and the half-drunk cups of tea strewn about our home.
to know -  Harry,” Draco’s voice breaks a bit. “Did you mean what you said in the kitchen? Do you love me?”
Harry’s mouth opened and closed several times. He folded his arms across his chest again, and glowered at Malfoy, muttering something about “completely missing the point.”
Draco snorts. “I’ll submit to whatever ridiculous, non-permanent changes you want to make for the sake of my son. And besides,” Draco cranes his neck to lift an eyebrow at Harry and level him with a smirk. “You love my hair, Potter. You’d mourn its loss.”
“Draco, love of my life, fire of my loins, if you don’t get out of the bathroom in the next ten seconds I will blast open this door!” Harry was waiting for his turn in the shower, standing starkers in their chilly bedroom save for a towel wrapped around his waist. It was useless to try and shower if Draco was in the bathroom and they actually had something they needed to get to, as their being naked in front of each other was a recipe for being late.
Harry emerged from the closet clutching his blue nylon gym bag and looked suddenly nervous. He approached Draco again, returning to his knees in front of the chair where the other man was still sitting, waiting for Harry to clarify whatever it was he was doing.
“I’m going to … err, go see if Kreacher can bring us some biscuits? Perhaps an early tea?” Harry says unnecessarily loudly, his cheeks still red. He runs out of the room.
“Thank you, Mr Potter.” She began reading over Malfoy’s meticulous reports. “I appreciate your words. But just to make sure that you’re not simply placating your professor with empty promises, you two will be in charge of cooking dinner tonight.” She smiled brightly at them, winked, and strode off towards Ron and Tony’s trench.
Harry sighs and closes his eyes. “I mean, I have no idea what’s going on in that head of his. Some days it seems like he’s about to strangle me for simply existing, and then the next he’s leaving me little notes in the lunch he’s packed for me.”
“Well, my compliments then, Potter.” Draco turned and smiled at Potter, who put his hands on his hips and looked at the floor, blushing.
“Don’t be a sore loser, darling,” Pansy responded, cackling and clapping her hands when the dreidel fell on
“Yeah, yeah. I know I’m an ‘uncoordinated git,’ get it out now.” He gestured for Malfoy to continue laughing.
“Yeah, it’s quite good,” Teddy says, considering. “So then I go to school and at school, it’s OK but not as good as at home. I have to learn maths and how to write, and it’s really hard work. But then Draco picks me up from school and we have tea and sometimes we visit Harry at work.
Realising it was past noon, Draco decided to brave the elements - today it was icy pavement and freezing wind - to explore his new neighborhood in search of sustenance. He was curious about the “trendiest area of London,” and hoped that he would find out what made the neighbourhood worth the price of rent. He turned left and began walking carefully down the street, noting that there were three cafes a stone's throw from each other, all advertising “organic, fair-trade coffee” and decorated in the minimalist style he associated with Scandinavian design. While Draco was no stranger to muggle economic practices, he was still mystified as to how three businesses in such close proximity to each other could stay in business.
“Why do you still refer to each other by your last names?” Karamo asks. “Is it a defense mechanism?”
Draco snorted. “I’m glad I don’t usually smell like whatever potion I’ve been working on. I’ve a laboratory just down the street.”
Malfoy was smirking when Harry looked back over to him. “Oh, I’m sorry, Potter. I didn’t realise you had such antiquated views of sexual relationships.”
“Of course we are! But, well, officially, we are your ‘guardians’. Draco and I decided that we wanted to make everything formal and adopt you.” Harry explains.
Harry chuckles. “You’re right, mate. I know that in this house we always allow each other to finish a conversation because it’s very bad manners otherwise. But when you heard me say that to Draco, that was the first time that I’d ever told him that I loved him.”
“Oh my dear, sweet, precious, adorable little Dray Dray. You wouldn’t be giving anything up! You’d be adding another layer to the Potter-Malfoy-Lupin sandwich of love!”
“Are you ready, love?” he asks a few moments later, pulling his fingers out of me and reaching for the lube to wet his shaft.
Jamie looked between all three adults and shook his head. “Grownups are so weird. Mum, can we go now? I wanna watch Doctor Who.”
Harry’s hands were still on Draco’s hips, but his thumbs were tracing slow circles where his pelvic bone stuck out from his body. “Are you OK?”
Draco shook his head. “Not romantic love. I love Astoria, but not in the way she loves her new wife.”
Harry smiled and took a deep breath. He knew from experience that this charm was particularly unpleasant, though blessedly quick. He backed up a few paces and steadied himself. “Ready,” he said. Malfoy flicked his wand and said the incantation, and Harry felt fire racing through his veins as the spell burned up the alcohol still in his system. After a few moments he shook his head as if trying to clear it, and looked at Malfoy. “You ready?” Malfoy braced himself against the side of the bed and nodded. As he didn’t know quite where his wand was, Harry waved his hand at Malfoy, focusing his thoughts on the incantation. Malfoy went rigid for a few seconds and then relaxed, opening his eyes to glare at Harry.
Harry raised his eyebrows and turned his head to regard Malfoy. “Cooking? Cooking is what boggles your mind about muggle life? I’ve been cooking since I was five. It’s not difficult, and it can be enjoyable.”
Saul and Sophia never tried to get Harry to talk more than he wanted to or was able, and they were sensitive to him when he couldn’t finish a story. A plate of rugelach and a kerchief were always pushed towards him when he needed it; a warm hand placed on his arm to let him know they were there. They gently encouraged him to write back to his friends and family, and they wrapped Hermione and Ron in tight hugs when he finally brought them ‘round to the deli.
On a bright Sunday in mid-April, Draco was forced to bring Scorpius with him to lab to check on the progress of a new Wolfsbane draught he was working on. Draco tried to avoid bringing him to his lab - he loved his son with all his heart, but not only was Scorpius terribly clumsy, he was also a precocious child and prone to poking and prodding any and all experiments he found in the lab - so he promised him a treat in exchange for good behaviour. After he’d finished taking notes on his potions, Draco glanced at his pocket watch and was pleased to note that it was just past two o’clock in the afternoon. Weinberg’s should be open, and their lunch rush (weekends were no exception to its popularity, he’d found) over.
Harry laughed and threw his arms around Draco’s midsection, burying his face in his stomach. “You’ll not regret marrying me, love. I promise I’ll work on not being such an insufferable git.”
Combining two households the month prior had been an enormous task, particularly since they had decided to move into the Potter/Weinberg townhouse in Shoreditch rather than into the much larger Malfoy home. Harry and Draco agreed that it would be for the best not to ask Saul to leave the home he had spent almost sixty years in, and the proximity to the Deli that Harry and Saul ran and to Draco’s potions laboratory made the decision an easy one. Fitting two more people into the already cramped space, however, was another story. The chaos of having four children under ten, one octogenarian, two owls, four goldfish, and one prickly pureblood under a single roof made Harry... blissfully happy. His home was rarely quiet before the addition of Draco and Scorpius, but their presence had added a joy to his days that he hadn’t known was possible. He wouldn’t call his marriage to Ginny unhappy - they had enjoyed a contented relationship and their children were absolutely the best part of his life - but they had never achieved anything resembling the spark that existed between himself and Draco. Every morning that he woke up next to Draco was a gift.
His pale skin flushed slightly under the attention of a pretty girl, he straightened up and walked towards her, companions in tow. "I'm Draco Malfoy." He spoke as he bent down and grasped her trunk tightly, hauled it up all while glancing at the sleeping serpent in his cage. He didn't question it, very smart of him. "That's Crabbe and Goyle." He must have seen her eyeing them in curiosity.
Entering the Great Hall, Maeve was quick to spot her twins, Lee Jordan, and Cedric Diggory. As soon as they noticed her they made a beeline towards the Slytherin table where they sat at their usual spot. She smiled and led her group over, nodding at the older years and taking her seat. Draco sat on her right as usual, followed by Blaise on her left with Daphne beside him and Theo next to Draco. Her twins sat in front of her followed by the rest.
A hand rose up and the green eyed girl nodded at the boy she remembered from the train, Gregory Goyle. "Vincent and I are still eating."
"Alright class, today we will be reading a short story and writing our thoughts on how you'd best rewrite it." Mrs. Colt said, standing up with a stack of packets in her hands. She walked around passing them out. "Each story will be different so that it is unique to you. Take your time as you have today and the whole summer to finish It. It will be graded on how well you put it together, not on spelling or handwriting." She explained.
He pulled out a blade and a parchment paper. -What is with parchment with these wizards? Are they that much out of date?- "You will need to cut your palm and spill a few droplets of blood onto the paper, it will reveal if your the real Maeve Potter. And then we will do the inheritance test." He instructed, handing over the gorgeous blade. "Nothing to worry about. After the blood is given the would will heal itself up, you'll hardly feel it." He assured, most likely seeing her hesitancy.
The blue-eyed boy glanced up at her, and smiled charmingly. "Yes, I'm quite alright. I was just thinking about our classes today. We have Defense against the Dark Arts today, right?"
Malfoy seemed to have a perfect grasp on his mask as he didn't show his shock to much, just a minor widening of his eyes. But it was quite alright, as she is known as the girl who lived. She reckoned she'd be surprised to meet a supposedly famous person as well.
“Yes,” She noticed his expression and cleared her throat. “Worry not about the price, I’m perfectly capable of paying for the supplies.”
Maeve woke to the sun brightly shining on her face through her sheer red curtains, Loki hissed in dissatisfaction. She giggled softly, her companion was such a spoiled baby. She tossed the blanket off her too warm body and sat up, skin flushed as she smiled brightly. It was her birthday and she'd get to see that letter her aunt had informed her about.
Mrs. Colt stands up with a smile on her pale face. "Alright everyone line up and I hope you have a wonderful summer vacation. Remember to rest up so you can have a good next year. Good job with all you've done. Now remain together while we walk to the pickup in the front."
"Purity." The door swung open and allowed her in. She walked into the freezing room, sighing in distaste. -Why was it so bloody cold!- She thought grumpily. She made her way up to her dorm room where she knew would be increasingly warmer than the whole bloody dungeon.
She missed her little friend while she was in class, it was lonely and she felt more vulnerable without him by her side. Maeve would ask him tomorrow to stay with her, as she knew with him, she'd never have to watch her back. He'd always protect her, no matter what.
"It has something to do with Dumbledore, I'm sure of it." Maeve said, glancing up at the professors table. Her three boys nodded, agreeing. The senile old man had to have secrets and that made him very suspicious in their eyes. "I hope I can get through herbology without hexing that woman! Her glaring irritates me so bloody much!" She growled in annoyance.
He went through several names before stopping at the name he's been waiting for. I-it's so g-good to ha-have you here, Ms. P-potter." He stammered, brown eyes glinting red, though Maeve was the only one who caught that.
Malfoy stood near Zabini waiting for the raven haired girl to return. "You think she pushed her?" He asked.
"Did she really have to eye us like that? Are all teachers going to be against Slytherins?" She questioned Malfoy, who in returned sighed.
"Those bloody dolts won't know what hit them when I'm through with them. The foolish witches and wizards that believe they can control me will pay for leaving me with muggles." She glanced at her friends with a fierce look in her eyes. "They need an able leader, because headless chickens need someone to follow and who better than us?"
"I'm fine." She said, even though she felt far from fine. Her body hurt like hell, but she can handle it.
A regal looking owl, most likely from Gringotts, flew towards her. "That's a bloody Great horned owl!"Draco shouted in awe and a hint of fear in his tone. Several students shrieked in terror at the owl. She snickered as he landed, perching delicately on her shoulder like royalty.
What on earth is on the third floor that would warrant death? Was this old man nutters? What was he playing at?
"Quite late to be wandering around, is it not? If I recall, Slytherin has a class in four hours, should you not be resting?" He inquired with a single raised brow. Maeve had always found it strange to hear no stutter whenever she was around but everyone said he had a terrible one.
"Lucius," Snape gave a curt nod, before gesturing to the girl behind him. "This is Maeve Potter, a friend of Draco's."
Quickly getting dressed, she nudged Loki awake. He had told her last night he wanted to go, she could never deny him anything. Loki uncoiled before slithering inside his humans sleeve and curling around her arm.
She folded the paper and placed it neatly in an envelope and tied it on the owl, tight enough so it wouldn't fall by accident but loose enough so that it didn't harm the little guy. "Well, owl, you should know what to do." She opened her window and dismissed the owl, who gave an offended hoot before flying away.
"I must show the other!" She was practically jumping with anticipation. "Would you accompany me Loki?" Her serpent denied as he wanted to bask in the warm before he was forced to endure the cold once more. She giggled before giving him a small kiss on the head and rushing out.
Maeve nodded in acceptance. She glanced at Theo who was sitting silently and ate his breakfast. "Are you all right? You're awfully quiet, something on your mind?" She wondered, eyeing him in curiosity.
"No matter, Sirius has been determined innocent and I'm quite sure he'd be alright with taking me in. Hopefully I get to visit him before Dumbledore does. I'd hate for my poor godfather to be in the headmasters clutches." She pouted mockingly, Maeve knew Sirius would have loyalties to her only, but she'd speak to him just in case. It wouldn't do good to just assume and have things backfire on her.
"Well, I suppose I should go and write my acceptance letter." She turned and walked out the kitchen leaving her stunned relatives behind as they watched the tiny creature trail after her. Vernon, baffled, turned to his wife for an explanation, who in turn merely ignored him. She was just glad the letter had arrived.
A student from the lion's side snorted at her proper way of speaking. Cold green eyes flashed towards them. Quirrell watched closely, seeing what she'd do.
She made it to chapter three before realizing closing time was approaching, placing her things away she followed a small group of older kids out the door. She glared at two particular girls who did not move after she so kindly asked them too. "Would you please get out of my way, I have to be somewhere." Her smile quickly faltered as the tallest of the two rolled her eyes, smacking her gum loudly.
She lifted a brow and smiled. "Yes, I suppose it is. I hope Defense Against the Dark Arts proves interesting."
Loki was in his new cage, curled up and asleep. She paced around her room, debating if she should just wake them up herself. In the end, she just let them be, they'll wake soon enough.
After dinner, Maeve wandered around the quiet halls when her housemates went to their common room to rest up before their next class. She sent her boys away, all she wanted at the moment was to be alone. She had much to think about and plans to set in motion.
After folding her clothes and taking Loki out hiding him under her clothes, she walked to the metal bed in the center of the room and laid down. A few minutes later Griphook walked back in with another goblin wearing a nurses jacket. "Ms. Potter this is Axehammer, he will be conducting your healing ritual." He introduced the other goblin who merely grunted.
Maeve raised a brow as Mcgonagall called them out. "I do hope you'll be paying attention and not fooling about." She firmly said.
Malfoy shrugged elegantly, his face set in a cool, indifferent mask. "He's a Weasley and his mother is most likely a harpy with the way she's always shouting. Father says despite them being pureblood, they bring nothing but disgrace to the other wizards and witches. Mr. Weasley works as head of the misuse of muggle artifacts in the ministry of magic. The man is obsessed with everything muggle. His family is known as bloodtraitors simply for that fact."
"Perhaps, I was a little to kind. What I meant to say was, Get out of my way or I'll make you. I have zero patience or tolerance for pigs who don't know their place." She snarled, toxic green eyes glowing with magic and anger. "And look when a person is talking to you, have you no manners?"
Maeve smiled, before glancing around. The sun was setting, it was getting late. She sighed, Petunia would most likely be upset over Mrs. Colts comments about her special Duddykins.
Maeve walked a little in the front, Malfoy and Zabini to her right and left with Nott bringing up the rear. Students in blue and green parted like the red sea and allowed the small group to step through first. Without knowing, Maeve carved a path for herself and others following in her and through that path, she begin the change in the Slytherin hierarchy, p lacing herself at the top of the pecking order.
“I’ll be picking them up in person, so please owl me when they have been completed. If you’ll excuse me, I have to pick up my school supplies.” She paid the two hundred galleons with her Gringotts card and then walked out, ignoring the way Fairchild proudly boasted about having Maeve Potter in his shop.
She felt herself jolt in shock. "Potter you say? And you are Sirius Black and a Remus Lupin? How strange."
She took it out of his hand and opened it, clearing her throat, she said, "I solemnly swear I am up to no good."
I was listening to 'You should see me in a crown' by Billie Eilish if anyone wants to hear that. It has nothing to do with this chapter, I just really like the song
Quirldemort watched in fascination, he recalled having similar thoughts and questions but he had been much older. Around sixteen, so her asking at a young age proved her intelligence. She'd be of good use, perhaps.
Maeve placed her notebook neatly on the corner of her desk, just as several students walked. Dudley was the last to enter. He looked like a baby elephant as he waddled over to his desk next to his best friend, Piers Polkiss, a scrawny rat faced boy.
She leaned forward with a deceiving smile. "Goyle, love, you wouldn't mind calling down Draco, Theo, and Blaise, right? It would be really kind of you," her voice dripped with honey as she spoke to the gullible boy. So easy to manipulate. "I'm sure you know where his dorm is, a smart boy such as yourself would know very well."
She paid the fee and walked to the back, the driver had better pray she never sees him again. She wont be showing mercy. There were a few more stops before they reached main London.
"Ready, Lady Potter?" The soft voice of the man who brought her here spoke from behind her. She nodded as she followed the man into the crowded lobby, they weaved their way past shoving witches and wizards. They were careful not to hit either of them, which was good as Maeve was not in the mood to be pushed around.
Maeve would keep an eye out on him, for now she'll sit and wait for the trial to begin. A broad, square-jawed witch with close-cropped grey hair and a monocle stepped forward. She cleared her throat and the room went silent.
Maeve couldn't hide her shock. "That's amazing, really impressive. We have our very own runes nerd. See, we'll be in control in no time." She said with a bright smile.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.
Blaise watched, amusement thrumming in his veins. Their little dark lady was exceptional at words, he could see the way Draco was crumbling just to be of use to her and if that meant using his own father, so be it. "It's alright, I'm sure if he were to ever find out, he wouldn't be upset. It's for a good cause, after all." He smiled, cheeks flushing a light pink that stood out against his pale skin.
She hummed thoughtfully, a smile curling at her lips. "Good, because I require plenty of help from him. He does work in the ministry after all, which is very useful to us." Maeve looked at a Draco with a small frown. "You don't mind, right? He is your father so if you think we shouldn't use him, I'll respect your decision."
She kept her face expressionless as she was quite aware of the Weasley presence. "Yes, I said Potter. You see, I'm the daughter of late James and Lily Potter. I am eleven years old."
§Loki, what ssshall I do, ssshould the other ssstudentsss ssstep out of line? I wisssh to remain unssseen until further ado.§
Maeve glanced at the clock on the wall. 11:40, just 3 more hours and she could head to the library. Her aunt would pick up Dudley but then conveniently forget all about her niece. She'll have 15 minutes after the bell to tell Mrs. Colt exactly what to say to anger Petunia.
They ignored all the looks they received by having two Gryffindors walk alongside them, whispers followed them but would quiet down when Maeve would look at them. Rumors had begun being spread about Maeve becoming the next Dark Lady but she'd wear that title proudly. She was the first of her group to enter the Great Hall followed by Draco, Blaise, Theo, and then the twins. She knew the youngest male Weasley was most likely seething at his seeing his older brothers do what he hadn't.
Severus Snape would definitely become a hindrance to her progress and would have to be dealt with soon as possible. Dumbledore will no doubt be a thorn in her side and he would only continue to get worse. The three aforementioned Weasleys would be handled as well, she'll have no one come between her and her path to greatness.
"I see. So that old fool has been meddling for far longer then I had expected." She said slowly to herself.
"Hello, Tom. I'm Maeve and I was hoping you could help me get into Diagon Alley?" She asked, hating how she had to act. But it always got the job home.
Grabbing her bag, she looked at Loki and held her arm out, waiting for her snake to slither on. Loki made the gesture of shaking his head in mock irritation before coiling around her thin arm. She snickered quietly and walked out the room silently closing the door, the fireplace lit casting an earthly glow and spreading warmth around the common room. Unlike last time Draco wasn't present, however another student was.
“No, you may not. Your job is to assist, not question things that do not involve you.” Maeve replied, already done with entertaining the man with her presence. “If you could go on with getting what I requested then the sooner I could leave.”
Turning off her lamp, she walked to her bed to get some much needed sleep. Loki curled in next to her, absorbing the warmth her body provided. She smiled sleepily, -goodnight Loki.-
She raised a brow at the lack of stutter, she was well aware it had to be fake. Though, Maeve couldn't understand why he never faked it when he spoke to her. Was he not worried about what she could do if he was hiding something?
She watched as his eyes once again flashed crimson and listened as he spoke with no stutter. "The school board and ministry have decided it best to teach the younger how to defend themselves to those who pose a threat." He replied in a steady voice.
Maeve put down her pencil and smiled proudly at her work that she did based on the short story she was given. She glanced around the classroom, her classmates all looked to be struggling. It was disappointing at how little they all learned.
The bus pulled to a stop in front of her and the driver took his time opening the door, her control was slowly fading as her anger began to emit from her body. When the door opened she nearly growled, oh was she planning on giving this man the curse of a lifetime. She got on, a vicious glare on her face, the man took no notice of her death look and instead smiled fairly greeting her with a dreadfully cheerful good morning.
"It seems we have Herbology with Ravenclaw first. I truly hope they do try not to overachieve. It would be much to exhausting." Maeve murmured. "We should get going, don't want to get lost."
If he were to lay a hand on her in any way today, she will retaliate in the most gruesome matter she could. So no, she'll not turn it in. She could wait till next year, after all she could always revise and edit her writing.
While Maeve was a very beautiful little girl and very polite, everyone stayed clear of her. The children because Dudley used his weight to attack them. The teachers and other staff members because the Dursleys could string very convincing stories of how the young girl was a little on the mental side. And her parents, before they were killed in a car crash, were dangerous criminals.
"I know exactly how to get people like her to do as I say, not to worry." Her smirk could only be positively devilish. She glanced around and noticed some students leaving. Most likely heading to dinner. "Come on, loves, let's head to the Great Hall."
In a few hours, Marge would arrive and the Dursleys would struggle to make sure everything was perfect. Maeve was quite excited, the large whale hadn't been over in a while so she doesn't know of the change. It would be the perfect moment to show Marge exactly who ran the show.
As she read, Maeve was also diligently taking notes, writing what felt important and highlighting the words that she ought to memorize. While doing this, the eyes of their professor could be felt though she did her best to ignore the man. His heated stare was no doubt noticed by Draco who inched slightly closer as though attempting to shield her from his godfather. She smiled as she continued on her notetaking.
Loki hissed in agreement. Deciding to get ready for the day, Maeve walked to her closet and pulling out a black long sleeved shirt and a black and white checkered mid-thigh skirt, knee length socks and her leather doc Martin's. She quickly changed, tucking the shirt into her skirt and brushing through her dark curls, placing them into twin space buns. Little baby hairs falling in curls down her forehead and her nape.
"I would like to know what possessed Dumbledore to try and set up a friendship with a girl you've never spoken to and expect you to be alright with it," Theo said, sounding puzzled.
Maeve eyed them doubtfully before agreeing and then went their separate ways. "What was that about?" Draco inquired, as they walked in and headed to the Slytherin table.
Maeve, for the first time in a while, let a true smile appear on her face. The smile that was reserved for Loki as he was her best friend, Malfoy was definitely a human best friend candidate. She looked away and pulled out a parchment paper to begin writing a formal letter, she'd have to write another to Gringotts, or pay them a visit, to let them know who she chose to be her legal step in for important occasions where attention was needed.
The twins nodded enthusiastically, bright grins upon their freckled faces. "Of course we are. Aye, Fred, reckon Ronnikins will be upset?" George snickered at the thought of their younger brother blowing a fuse at them befriending a Slytherin.
"Hogwarts is beautiful, such a shame that weak minded people are here as well." Maeve stated as she saw the redhead from earlier insulting another person, a girl with bushy hair who seemed to have pointed out the smudge of dirt on his nose. She sighed in disappointment.
Maeve had gotten up extra early the next morning, wanting to check if the owl had returned with another letter. She quickly got dressed in a plain white shirt tucked into high waist cuffed mom jeans and converse. Loki had also gotten up, as he sensed his humans anxiousness.
She hissed into the quiet room, her small friend uncoiled itself from atop his heating stone. Slit eyes peered at her as a forked tongue flickered out its mouth.
There was a storm in those green eyes, a grin that was a tad too sharp found its way onto her deceptively sweet face, Severus did not like the look. Not one bit. Dread pooled at his gut, he knew something was wrong. Just as quick as it came, it was gone. The tension that filled the room had drained away and Potter looked at him with innocent eyes but he knew differently. He saw the darkness that stewed there and he was not fooled. "I've read it twice already, I doubt that I'd need to read it again. Don't you agree, professor?"
"What was that about?" Zabini questioned, Maeve shook out of her head and glanced at him and Malfoy, who had a worried expression.
Maeve shook her head, loose curls bouncing over her shoulders. "Honestly, I had no idea Hogwarts was even a real place until a month ago. So, no, I had no clue my father was this prongs lad or that he created an ingenious map with his mates." Her green eyes stared at the redheads intensely. "You said yesterday that it was your father who had mentioned that my godfather was sentenced with no trial, correct?"
"That old halfwit really thinks he can control you? He must be completely bonkers to assume you'd follow his orders and be alright with it." Draco said as he pulled out his charms book.
Grumbling hatefully to herself she pulled out her money bag to get the amount to pay. She pulled out a pound, knowing full well she was not going to give a tip. It could've been worse, she could have punished him. He should be grateful.
"I'm Blaise Zabini." The dark skinned boy introduced himself, holding his hand out with an attractive smirk on his face.
He swallowed the food in his mouth, nodding. "Yes, I had my owl deliver it while you were reading your letter, I've also written my mother asking her for the books about occlumency and legilimency along with my notes."
The staircase was slightly colder having been separated from the fireplace, though it wasn't much to bothersome so she could handle it. She opened her door quietly in case Loki was resting, he could be quite testy when he was annoyed and Maeve wasn't up to handling an upset snake.
Stalking forward, like a predator preparing to pounce on its prey. Maeve stood in front of Vernon's body lay prone on the ground. "What should I do to show you exactly who is in charge?" Tapping her small index finger against her chin in thought, she nodded her head. "I know, I'll just make sure you never forget."
"You lot can go about your day, might want to take a nap before our next class as it is astronomy and I would hate for you all to fall asleep and possibly not learn anything." She waved a dismissive hand and the surrounding group parted ways leaving her with her friends. "Such well behaved snakes, I quite like the way they obey without much thought." Maeve smiled darkly, her boys chuckled quietly from beside her. Together they made their way to the library as they planned to study history on their own, yet again. As said from before, Maeve refused to have her and her friends settle for less simply because their professor was absolutely dead.
"Wake up! Wake up girl!" Maeve woke to her aunt Petunia screeching. She blinked the sleep away before slowly sitting up. "Are you up?"
The two shared a glance before nodding. "We're with you, of course." Said Malfoy confidently. Zabini nodded with his words. Maeve slightly grinned, she'll show everyone exactly what she and all the the other Slytherins are capable of doing.
Maeve watched as her housemates began doing as told, she hardly felt the need to do the same. She had already proved she could do it so what was the point in even pretending to try.
Maeve smirked, looking back out the window. It amused her when adults were creeped out by her. All she had to do was stare straight at them and then they began to become uncomfortable.
Maeve wiped a stray tear from her eye, as she smiled gratefully. "Thank you. And you know, since you both are being such great help, I wouldn't mind if you refer to me as Maeve."
Maeve scowled but did as told. How much trouble could she honestly get into for merely putting a measly witch in her place? She didn't think it was very fair for them to stop her, but she understood someone like Dumbledore would never like 'dark' magic. Well, as far as magic could be dark.
She hummed, charms class was right about now. She'll join her housemates during History of Magic, despite already knowing how it would go. She truly hopes Lord Malfoy is able to arrange that meeting, professor Binns has to leave. There was simply no other way around it, Dumbledore would have to find his replacement quickly or have another teacher stand in for a while. The heat that filled the common room had warmed her enough that she was well all right to head up to her dorm, Loki must have been so very lonely. Maeve snorted at that, her little serpent friend much rather preferred his own company than of others.
Theo cleared his throat and looked around at the other first years that were not so subtle at hiding their interest in the conversation. "It would be better to discuss this in a more private area."
She pursed her lips, the light shining from the gloss. It was almost time and Loki was being childish.
Without much hesitation she opened it, a small object was wrapped protectively with a soft cotton fabric. Which was strange enough, but now without much coverage the magic was more noticeable. It coiled around like a snake looking for its prey.
She paused in her steps, it seems she was right after all. The headmaster sat comfortably on a cushioned chair, no doubt something he transfigured. "Have a seat, Ms. Potter."
"Yes, so I know when I need it, they'll send their support. I need not worry of the small chance they'll betray me. They are a loyal and vicious lot."
Her teacher, whom she didn't bother remembering the name of, was a woman with no backbone. As Dudley was known to be a huge bully (the term huge used loosely) their teacher turned a blind eye. Merely because she found Vernon Dursley to be intimidating, and Petunia Dursley is quite vicious in her gossiping.
"You set up the trial?" Her godfather, Sirius Black, asked with a hoarse voice from no doubt never speaking.
"Of course, school has just begun but I'm certain it'll be easy to handle." She grit her teeth in annoyance as she felt his magic probe at her mind, with irritation she flung up a mental shield that'll keep him from seeing anything important without him noticing. "Headmaster, may I admit something?" The dark haired girl wanted to hear his answer, to see his reaction. Then she'll know his true intentions. For his sake, he better not answer incorrectly.
Maeve hummed as she walked down the cold dungeon halls, she was thinking about their next class. Astronomy, she hoped it was an interesting class. She'd quite literally bore herself to sleep if she wasn't a little entertained. "Pureblood." She said the password, she'd have to talk to someone about that. The idea of being a purist was idiotic when she herself was a half-blood.
He raised his palm and she nearly scowled at the blatant disrespect in the gesture. "I'm sure what has been happening is a big misunderstanding, perhaps if you speak to your aunt and explain your feelings, things will change."
The dumpy woman hadn't seen the warning look Vernon tossed her way, as she tramped closer to the still smiling young girl. Suddenly she froze in the center of the room, her eyes widened. She wasn't able to move!
Petunia Dursley ñee Evans had always hated her sister's freakishness and the fact that she and her husband had gone and gotten themselves blown up and dumped their daughter with them angered her greatly. Lily Evans had always been the perfect child, the favorite daughter in their parents eyes. Petunia had been jealous at the time, for her younger sister had everything. The beauty, the brains, and than the magic.
Just to be clear, I don't know how trials work so I'm sorry for any inaccuracies during the court scene!
She turned her attention away from the now silenced redhead and towards the teacher. "Anyways professor, I had a few questions about this class if you'd be willing to answer them."
Snape was appalled to know that these boys obeyed without much thought, even his godson who had claimed he wanted to be the Slytherin prince much like his father. The greasy haired man had no idea how the Potter scion gained the loyalty of two children of two well known death eaters and the son of the black widow, a woman who married different men who died of unforeseen circumstances and took all their money. He didn't think he wanted to find out.
She stumbled into her dark room, the cold air assaulting her immediately. Loki, who was curled into himself on her bed, lifted its head before unraveling and slithering towards her. She giggled sweetly at her best friend/familiar.
Rage boiled beneath her skin, how dare this man assume it was a misunderstanding? If she had really been being abused he would have allowed it to continue and for what? A pawn to use in the war he was causing. She'd kill him if he weren't useful at the moment. "Of course, headmaster. If you don't mind, I'd like to head to my dorm room. Hopefully I haven't missed too many classes." She stood as he nodded, dismissing her with his famous grandfatherly smile.
"Pansy Parkinson, you will take a seat and you will be silent! One more word and you'll be dealing with much more than detention."
"Oh, really?" Maeve answered with an amused smile. The long necked blonde flinched slightly, her confidence faltering for a moment before she regained composure. "Do carry on." She said, an innocent smile on her soft pink lips.
She let out a bubbly giggle that sounded a bit mad, her pale cheeks flushing a rosy color. It felt nice letting loose with people who wouldn't judge her and even go along with her mad plans. Friends, she hadn't any friends before, it was slightly better than having followers-only slightly.
"So you had no idea your father, James Potter, was prongs? That he and his friends created the map?" Fred glanced at his twin, he didn't know what else to ask without seeming insensitive.
He hummed before looking her in the eyes, seemingly searching for something. "Well, I'll let you go off to look for your little friends."
Instantly, the garden sprung to life. Each and every flower blossoming beautifully. She was still learning to control her magic and soon she'll be able to do more things, bigger and stronger things. With a small, breathtaking smile, she made her way inside.
Once the Dursleys were sat down, Maeve directed her attention back to the still frozen ape. "Now where were we?" She asked with a charming smile, eyes glinting with malice.
She couldn't hide her shock, much to her displeasure. First she finds she's not one, not two but heiress to six houses with so much money. And then she finds out about the blocks and manipulations placed on her.
Guess you popped in?? Look out for more clues that will come in chapters further along. I have so much planned for this book!
She walked down the quiet halls towards the Slytherin common rooms, Loki wrapped securely around her arm. It was time to look through the package that was sent to her by Gringotts. Humming softly, she reached the door to the common rooms, she rolled her eyes as she remembered the password, honestly her snakes were such bigots.
Maeve thought it was an appropriate time to head back to the Dursleys so that she could read up on the Magical world. It was time to take her place.
"Excuse me, Lord Malfoy, but I wish to greet my godfather." She stood up and walked towards the two men who were whispering sweet little words to each other. Her eyes widened when their lips smacked against each other, she shuffled on her feet awkwardly. "Pardon the interruption." A blush formed on her pale cheeks when they jumped apart and looked at her.
Pansy was the first to be called and Maeve knew she was hardly paying attention with the way she fumbled and messed up. "We'll be working on that during your detention, I hope you know that. Mister Crabbe, if you will."
They hung out together outside since they had no more classes to attend to for the rest of the day, dinner was approaching and they walked together to the Great Hall. Students standing about in the corridors or also heading to eat dinner. Maeve and her small group sat at the end of the Slytherin table after greeting the Weasley twins, the dark haired girl watched amusingly as Draco began filling her plate with various options of food and Blaise offered a cuppa which she took gratefully.
"Oh, I wasn't aware students would be arriving early." She had a strained smile, clearly four Slytherins with her alone made her uncomfortable.
You have chaos in your soul and lightning in your veins. You, my dear, were made for wild, magical things.
Soon a woman stepped out of the backroom with Liam leading her out. She was tall, thin, and very beautiful with fair skin, dark hair, and stunning unique amethyst eyes. A measuring tape in her left hand and her wand strapped to her right arm, Maeve wondered if the tape was a magical item since it didn’t look too different from what the mundanes used-should she call them muggles as that was the term the goblins had used?-
- Mrs. Colt would never say it to aunt Petunia's face, but I know how she truly feels about Dudley. I should convince her to tell Petunia how much of a pig and bully her son is. Just to see what would happen.-
“May I be of help, madam?” Maeve was jolted from her observings when a handsome man looking no older than mid-thirties with dark wavy hair and bright eyes, he had a kind smile as he walked over to her though his eyes showed that he doubted she could afford anything. And the way he was eyeing her mundane clothing had begun to irritate her.
"He looks sort of savage, don't you think?" Maeve glanced at Malfoy, who was eyeing the halfbreed in distrust. A slim, dark skinned boy agreed, nodding his head. She didn't say anything, even though she also thought the same.
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Maeve could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right, the rest of the school must already be here, but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.
She let out a breathy laugh, shaking her head. She let Loki climb up her arm before curling itself around. Maeve knew Loki had only wanted to come so he could threaten to bite people. Even if she'd never follow through unless her mistress was in a dangerous situation and couldn't protect herself.
Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
She hoped the pain would be nearly gone by the time she left gringotts, she still had shopping to do. She trudged towards the door and into the hallway where Griphook stood waiting for her. "Are you ready to head to your vaults and hear about who Lucifer Morningstar is?" He asked, she nodded even though she was exhausted and felt she'd collapse soon.
"Move along now," she said sharply. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start. Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."
'Braxton left the comfort of his home in the middle of the night after a heated argument with his father. He hiked into the woods behind his house. The only light to guide him was the moon that lay pale in the dark sky.
Professor Sprout constantly had an eye on the Slytherins, like she was expecting them to start cursing students and misbehaving. That thought only fueled the anger in Maeve's eyes as she glared at the short woman. She was making her unbelievably angry, with her short-minded head.
He rolled his eyes, with a small pout. His pale cheeks flushed pink when Maeve patted them teasingly. "Shove off." He muttered childishly, his pout growing.
Petunia scowled at Maeve, the little brat was much too small for her age but she was still such a pretty little girl. The clothes from her Dudders didn't hinder her beauty. Instead it made her seem like a modern Cinderella.
"I stated clearly that one must give respect to get respect, and you all know the way McGonnagal had treated me when we first encountered. She looked at me distrustfully and then proceeded to be prejudiced against us. It's not right, Dumbledore couldn't give a proper reason only that adults deserve their respect. What a barmy buffer."
Quickly changing into her nightwear and brushing her teeth, Maeve whispered a goodnight to Loki before finally sleeping. Tomorrow, someone from the ministry will be picking her up to attend the trial.
Maeve was almost impressed, though less so as she caught sight of Granger who practically vibrated in her seat. The bushy-haired girl seemed to want to prove she wasn't a dunderhead, of course just like everywhere else, she'd only come second to Maeve.
He looked quite savage, actually, with long dark hair and beard. Beady little eyes that anxiously looked around. Part giant crossed her mind, she shrugged it off as she, too, walked around him.
"When do you suppose Zabini will be awake?" she bit into a blueberry muffin, covering her mouth slightly.
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause...
McGonagall soon dismissed the class with a pile of homework on the subject of the spell they learned. The snakes filed out in an orderly fashion while the Hufflepuffs scattered disorganised. Maeve walked alongside Malfoy as Zabini and Nott talked among themselves behind them.
"Pardon me, but I would like to request to see my account manager. I was told I should visit here first." She politely explained, not knowing exactly how these creatures responded to rudeness, she decided to play it safe and be respectful. After all she wouldn't want to insult those managing her bank.
It has come to my attention that a Sirius Black, current Lord of the ancient and noble house of Black, has been sentenced to Azkaban supposedly with no trial. Now, I want to be clear that I am in no way familiar with the laws of the magical side of the world, but I'm fairly certain that having no trial is very much illegal. Therefore Mr. Black is in need of one lest he rot in prison for allegations that were not proven in a correct manner. I wish for the Potter's account manager, Silvertooth, to set up a meeting with the ministry of magic. As Sirius Black is my godfather and I am Lady Potter, I can formally request for a trial to be done for him. Make sure they understand why I am meeting with them. Also, have it known that if a trial is not set up, this little incident will be all over the papers. I'm sure reporters would love to interview the girl who lived only to find her distraught over the fact that they have wrongly imprisoned her godfather and refused to give him a proper trial to prove his innocence. Thank you.                                                                        Signed, Maeve Potter.'
"Maeve Potter." She simply stated, she watched in confusion as the goblins eyes had widen before they trailed up to her forehead where her scar was. Subtly, she hid it behind her bangs.
"Right, you don't believe in magic. That's alright. Whats not alright is the fact you don't know the rules. That's just not going to cut it." Maeve tsked in disappointment, shaking her head. "Rule number one is the easiest one to remember, I'm in charge. So know your place. Rule number two, disobedience is not and will never be tolerated. Punishment will be necessary. Number three, the most crucial one, nothing that happens here will be spoken of."
Finally class was dismissed, Maeve rounded up the other first year slytherins and was pleased at how quickly they obeyed, which was good as she really didn't want to punish one of her own, not saying that she wouldn't. "Our next class is Transfiguration which puts us at a disadvantage because despite being an adult, the moody old bat that is our professor would discriminate against our house. I want each one of you to be on your best behavior, don't give her a reason to dock points. Show her we're better than her pathetic lions. Understood?"
"Respect is earned, madam, and you've done nothing to earn such respect." Maeve then stood up and looked to the two snakes who were watching the exchange. "You two needn't worry about writing notes as professor Mcgonagall clearly doesn't have her priorities straight. If she wishes to disregard students wanting to learn then she clearly," the raven haired girl looked back to the infuriating old biddy. "Needs to find a new position as being a teacher seems unfit for her." She had a smirk on her face as clear as day, challenging the harridan to deny the accusation. There were too many witnesses for her to make an excuse.
The librarian glared at them when they walked through, eyeing their ties critically. Maeve withheld a sigh, -was everyone prejudice? Everywhere we go, someone is looking at us warily.- She hated it with a burning passion. It's like they were waiting for the next villain to appear. and it was becoming rather irritating. They sat in the far back in a secluded area, where anyone was bound to miss.
hexes.” A flush blossomed on Malfoy’s pale neck and ran up to his cheeks, and he quickly turned back to his task of ripping lettuce for salad.
Saul chuckled but bend to whisper something in Lily’s ear. The little girl giggled and said, “Sorry everyone!”
“It can be, but the beauty of Indian cooking is that you can usually adjust the spice level to suit the tastes of the eaters.” Antoni answers. He takes several tomatoes and onions and places them on the kitchen table, next to a chopping block. “Karamo, will you help Teddy cut these while I show Harry and Draco how to make their own sambar powder?”
“We’re not.” Antoni replies. “I’m a no-maj, but my ex was a wizard. He got permission to tell me after we’d been together for five years. We broke up eventually, but by then I’d already been grouped with these madmen.”
Harry put his hands up in surrender. “All I mean to say, Draco, is that you should give yourself the chance to be happy. You never know what’s going on in another person’s head. Unless they’re dead or married or something, then what’s the harm?”
“Err, well, the Dursleys were… I mean, my uncle was quite… rough with me when I was a child.” He glances at Teddy, who’s looking at Harry with wide eyes. “But, once I got to Hogwarts, people hugged me all the time. Hermione was constantly doing it, and even Ron would when we said goodbye for summers.”
They walker up another set of stairs before reaching a large wooden door, Lord Malfoy rapped his knuckles gently and waited. "Come in." Dumbleodore's voice sounded through the door, it caused Maeve to feel like hexing him a hundred times over.
Even if Sirius Black was family, Maeve wasn't going to have anyone hold her back. She'll destroy anything in her path capable of getting in her way. Family or not.
I just want to say a thank you to @lalacsulalac for offering to read through my draft and helping to fix any mistakes I may have made. Also thank you to them again for giving me the idea to use proxy instead of step-in, yours sounds so much more professional.
Lily Potter knew she was to die as she heard the killing cursed used on her, now dead, husband. She placed her daughter in her cot and stared into familiar stunning green eyes that would put the finest of emeralds to shame. "Maeve always remember mama and papa love you with all our heart. Always believe you are special and powerful. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Papa and I will never leave you, not really, okay?"
Just wanted to say that this will probably not follow canon, there will be some parts that will be completely different. Hope you all still enjoy this as much as I enjoyed writing it.
"Excellent." Maeve clapped in innocent pretense. "I'll be going now, get to the hospital and get help and remember I was never here." She patted their heads before standing up and walking away. It was time to get back to the Dursleys.
Upon entering the girls loo, Maeve was hit by the strong smell of lavender and vanilla. She scrunched up her nose in distaste as she walked into an empty stall to change as quickly as possible. The need to get away from the awful, most likely cheap, perfume is what fueled her into moving faster.
Maeve was proud that it all went according to plan, she knew her godfather had to be innocent. He was her fathers best friend, why would he betray someone he considered a brother? And that Remus Lupin bloke, she honestly hadn't seen them being together coming. Though she supposed they were cute together, seeing them reunite had caused a pang in her heart that she didn't understand. She just shook it off with her being happy to have some form of a real family, they seemed nice enough. Hopefully they weren't in Dumbledore's clutches and if they were, oh well.
