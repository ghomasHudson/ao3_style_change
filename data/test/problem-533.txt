And he suddenly just wanted Draco here. He wanted him to yell at his mom for him to take them back to Hogwarts this minute, and he was so spoiled she’d probably give in. He wanted to be back in the Gryffindor dorm. He wanted Neville in the bed next to him wishing him a goodnight and for this entire terrible day to just be
"Yeah. Why'd you do it for Neville, of all people?"

“Voldemort…” he breathed, noting Quirrell’s expression facing him change but not giving a shit as his eyes fixated on the creepy face in the mirror. Stuck in disgust and terror as it seemed to bare its teeth at being addressed.
The twins crossed their hearts dramatically.

"Yep!" He slipped it out of his pocket to hold it up as proof that it was still perfectly undamaged but frowned as the smoke immediately turned red under his touch. "Still don't know what I've forgotten though…"
“On another note, since Gringotts is managing your mail wards, we scan everything that comes in. Predictably most of it is junk or fan mail that is sent to your donation vault if you wished to see it. Anything we deemed urgent would’ve been forwarded, however things that you may have interest in that are not explicitly urgent I simply held for when you would next visit. There are two in particular I think may be of some interest.” He explained the envelopes, and Harry lifted the top one with the Ministry’s seal with numb fingers.
“Guess not…” He allowed, and it wasn’t like he didn’t feel tired as hell. The fuzzy, sinking feeling of wanting to go back to sleep hadn’t really gone away yet aside from the brief moment he’d been angry, and it wasn’t hard to sink back into it easily.
“What the quaffle am I supposed to do with all of this?” He asked of no one.

And what have we done with the lions now that's upset them?"
He snapped sharply, taking a menacing step forward to get in his face, and Ron took an automatic step back—but his face got red in anger and glared back just as hard.
September seemed to go quickly after that, and while the stress of worrying about Draco’s short temper and how he was being treated within his house was replaced with the more intense worry of if he was ever going to talk to Draco again
“You know, this really feels like you’re just calling me insane over and over again. Not very tempting discourse, you know.” Draco rolled his eyes, and Seamus glared daggers at him from across the library table.
Just because he had no one didn't mean he had to abandon himself too.

, but Harry thought himself a pretty good liar and Neville was just flat out terrified—Snape had never seen the blond Gryffindor with any other expression, so how would he possibly know he was significantly more terrified at this moment than any other?

Like an actual bloody boogeyman he had tried so hard to pretend wasn’t real—or that it couldn’t touch him if he just didn’t go near the forest again. Let Hagrid or Dumbledore or the centaurs handle it, not plain, weak, eleven-year-old him.
Strong as hell, but they were Slytherins just the same as everyone else in their house and despite Montague being a not-so-small support beam of how their connection worked, they’d dropped him like a ton of bricks the second he’d started to sink. Who even knows how many broken deals and canceled favors got tossed around when cutting ties with him, and for snakes who took that stuff insanely seriously, that was going to be the center of their gossip and speculation for a long time yet.

“Of course it does! The soccer teams are supposed to be separate from the houses, so they have to be totally different from the colors the houses use!” Harry didn’t miss a beat, flashing him a grin that had the Irishman admitting defeat immediately. He turned back to the shirt he was holding that was slowly turning the right color. “Okay stop! I like that—what does everyone else think?”

him dead. If he was interpreting the mushy emotions on the ugly little face, the dark lord was already very aware of his hatred for the boy in front of him.
Harry’s stomach dropped and he quickly released the elf to search through his bag properly this time… in short order  he found his enchanted journal and winced when he realized the edges of the pages had been completed dyed with fresh red blood he’d probably smeared there in his careless searching through his bag. He hadn’t been thinking… no wonder, if Draco saw all that unexplained blood he’d have a right fit.

Draco had, obviously, asked why Hedwig had showed up at his house seeming really distressed.
“I like that idea better—let’s get out of here.” He agreed, and Harry made to stand up when he suddenly focused on the book he was hiding behind instead of the scene beyond them, and blinked.
Harry's eyes went wide, and his mind left the awkward conversation about ten miles beneath him as his heart and mind leapt from his body and made a mad dash for the heavens.
Harry had already proven he had the ‘intent’ part down in Transfiguration this morning and while he took some cursory bullet-point notes automatically just because, he stopped paying true attention quickly. He noted that almost every pureblood and half-blood he knew of in the room was also either staring out the windows or writing notes back and forth to each other. He figured if you grew up knowing about magic then this was a really stupid class to have to sit through, but everyone had to take it so they were all on the ‘same page’.

“No, we’re free for the day until Astronomy tonight.” Harry answered her curt tone, and she nodded once.

Harry frowned at that, shooting him a curious look. “Huh? The
At her words though he snapped his head to the side to look at his father, who smiled wryly.

No one had come near the shed all day, and it was well after dinner and about the time Petunia usually called it a night that Vernon came out into the yard once more with wide flat objects Harry couldn’t make out in the dark. He didn’t realize anyone was there to be fair, but when he’d heard grunting and huffing he’d carefully tip-toed to the windows at the front of the shed to try and see out in the darkness of the new night.
“Old habit.” Draco sat up and began putting his clothes back on. Harry, perfectly clothed, thudded back down into his chair and began rummaging around in his desk drawer for a snack. He found a stash of chocolate frogs and began munching. Draco took a deep breath and said, “My mum. She wants to meet you.”
Potter flushed. “I don’t have a –”
“Oh, this is good,” Harry said. “Why haven’t I had this before?”
“He wasn’t joking about this,” Harry said, patting his belly, “and he wasn’t joking about the other thing, either.”
“How noticeable is it?” Harry asked, dragging his hand across his stretched-out navel. “The weight, I mean.”
“Very,” Ron said, and cackled drunkenly. “I mean, you look good, I’m not saying you don’t. But you’ve suddenly got this – this outright belly, and the way you eat, mate, it’s only gonna get bigger.”
Harry had just polished off the last crisp and was starting to feel pleasantly full when Hermione called them to the table. Dinner was simple but plentiful, great bowlfuls of pasta and a variety of sauces, plus bread and butter and a few vegetables that Harry didn’t bother with. He had a plate of pasta with alfredo, then a plate of pasta with marinara, then a plate of pasta with plenty of butter and cheese.
Draco thought of the beautiful redhead and gritted his teeth. “Yes.”
"And how are you now?" Draco asked quietly. The compassion that spread in his stomach made him dizzy.
“Hi, what can I get you, dear?”
“Don’t know”, I mumbled, trying to hide my head under Harry’s absurdly large hoodie, not wanting to show that I kind of like the idea of me and him, wandering in the snow, holding hands, drinking hot cocoa. I nibbled his soft, tanned skin.
His forearms on both sides of Draco’s head, Harry looks down on the blonde man.
"Mr. Malfoy?"
Hermione, who wasn't at all surprised to see him here, or rather quick-witted enough to know it didn't matter now, pressed a plain glass bottle with a dark red, clear liquid into his hand.
And then his tongue was on me and I moaned. Quickly it circled over the wrinkly rim and I felt my stretched hole helplessly clench around nothing. Harry licked a wide strip from my heavy balls to my tailbone and I bit into the pillow to muffle my screaming.
“Draco”, Harry growled.
“Baby?”, he asked in a calm voice and I knew, that he was asking for my permission to go on.
Placing a soft kiss against Draco’s inner thigh, right under his balls, made the blonde’s cock twitch in interest. “Fuck you, Harry. Just tell me!”
“Oh, shut up”, Draco grumbled, feeling his cheeks heating up. He took a last glance towards the stage. Harry smiled at him.
When Harry woke up, he wasn’t quite aware of his current state. He wasn’t aware about the bed he was lying in, about the singing birds outside his window, about the sunlight shining through a big gap in his curtains, about the sweet-sour taste in his mouth… But what he
"Well," Potter stammered and blushed slightly under his beard. "It actually went quite well. At least I think I managed to fix the broken rib by myself. I'm learning too, you know. But I think my lungs got something. Breathing is a bit difficult and hurts a lot". Again he coughed rattling and pressed his flat hand against his torso.
The stunning spell almost on his lips, Harry chokes, when he sees a shock of white-blonde hair glinting in the dark backyard.
Draco made himself another cup of coffee, black and strong, and took it to the small balcony, where hardly anything fitted except a chair and a small bistro table. His thoughts drifted back to Potter. How did he do? Did his colleagues at the curse ward manage to get him fixed?
In one jump Draco was on his feet, kneeling in front of the chair. He grabbed the young Auror by the shoulders and shook him.
A thick finger stroked up and down my crevice and I shuddered. Harry massaged my tight hole, the ring of muscles twitched under his fingertip. Gently he pushed inside me. My head fall back and I groaned.
"Harry Potter? He's doing all right. I heard he made quite a fuss down in the ER, the poor boy. Up here this morning he also had a little panic attack, but we were able to calm him down again."
Draco’s hand raked through Harry’s tangled mess of black hair and Harry intensified the grip on his waist and the kiss in the same moment. Electricity seemed to rush through his veins and he could swear he felt little sparks erupting from his lips, when Draco just let out the tiniest whimper.
Be gentle with me, it's my first work :D
And with that death knell, she flung open the door to the auror’s department, grabbed his arm, and ushered him in.
“Thanks,” he said, tucking in.
“He’s fatter, that’s for sure.”
“I like tying your shoes,” Draco said dreamily.
“Insubordination,” Harry said weakly.
“I told you!” Ron said.
“Stop,” Harry begged.
“Well?”
He didn’t, technically, need the money. Not yet. But the truth of the matter is that he was lonely. Working in an office, surrounded by other people – even if those other people did not like him – appealed. So he’d taken the job.
“So how’d you get into Cursebreaking, anyway?” Potter said, and they were off.
“Just checking.”
Gamely, Harry licked his lips free of chocolate and sat up straighter on the couch and dropped his hand from where he’d been absentmindedly petting his belly.
“Good, finish it up and then report back immediately, yes?”
“Feel like it, too,” Harry said. “Can barely tie my own bloody shoes anymore. This one’s started doing it.”
Draco was back at his side, one hand resting casually along the back of his chair, and Harry took a moment to look at him, how lovely he was, so cool and upright and calm. He quirked a questioning brow Harry’s way.
“Of course I do,” Draco said. Potter didn’t seem to have an answer for this, just a nervous half-smile, and Draco was suddenly seized with the terror that after all this, they’d actually have nothing to say to each other, nothing to talk about. His mind went absolutely blank.
“Well,” Hermione said, and crossed her fingers.
“Right, of course,” she said. “If you want to put your things down, I can show you the break room, it’s just down the hall.”
Draco bit his lip. “It’s fine,” he said. He sounded dubious, and said it again, more convincingly. “It’s fine. I want to know your friends. You came out with Pansy when she was in town, and she’s absolutely horrible.”
“Very good. Pansy, can you give us a girl who’s got a pure soul and a clean mouth?”
Potter paused and swallowed his mouthful, then pushed his glasses up his nose and gave Draco an odd, considering look. “We both of us had a time, didn’t we?”
“Pink,” Pansy said. “Just in case he hasn’t cottoned-on that you’re gay as the day is long.”
“Fish and chips.”
“Masterful leadership,” Draco drawled. “I can tell they really respect you around here.”
“No, darling.”
Draco found, to his horror, that this got him so hard he had to unzip his trousers immediately and take himself in his hand. He saw Harry notice this over Pansy’s shoulder and grin.
“Bed,” Harry agreed.
“See you Thursday, yeah?” Ron said. “I’ll do a roast, you can stuff yourself silly on those mashed potatoes you love.”
Harry felt himself blush in the dark. “Yes.”
“I get that too!” Hermione said.
“Just here,” Draco said, and sucked the patch of skin beneath Harry’s chin. Then, abruptly, he stood. “Well, work to do.”
“It ought to be,” Malfoy said. “It cost more than your entire flat, probably.”
Harry hiccupped. The cake was almost gone, and Draco had watched him drink quite a lot of wine. He reached over to tousle his hair fondly, then stopped at Pansy’s warning look, and withdrew. Mustn’t mess with the hair, he repeated to himself.
“You,” Harry said, hoisting himself to his feet and leaning awkwardly over his belly to kiss Draco, “are incredible.”
“Well,” Ginny said, looking Draco up and down. “You certainly grew up nicely.”
Harry was shrugging out of his jacket, and Draco was briefly distracted by the way his button-up flannel rode up the slope of his belly, wrinkling beneath those softened pecs. He was looking so thick, lately, thick and round and getting rounder almost by the day. How would someone else describe him, Draco wonder. Podgy? Paunchy? His ass had grown, too, was sweetly wider and juicier. He watched as Harry sat with a thump on the couch, too unused to this new weight to understand how to get himself gracefully in and out of chairs. He arched his back, pushing on the side of his belly as if trying to rearrange it, and Draco realized that it was sitting fully on his lap, now, resting on the tops of his thighs. Just a week ago, it hadn’t been, and now it was. Did Harry notice? He seemed more uncomfortable than usual, grunting a bit as he tried to get situated.
“He’s always whinging about it the next morning. Oh, shouldn’t have had that last slice of tart, that sort of thing. The sweet tooth on that man…” she clucked her tongue.
“Naturally, Potter, I’m not an imbecile.”
“More lunch,” Draco said.
Harry let out another shallow sigh. The thought of Kreacher cheered him a bit – or rather, the thought of Kreacher’s pancakes and bacon, which he was planning to have for breakfast tomorrow. “Fine,” he said. “Tell Hermione I said goodbye, would you? There’s no way I’m making it upstairs in this state.”
“Crikey,” Ron said the following Thursday. He looked Harry up and down, grinning. “You’ve been packing it on, haven’t you?”
“Granger’s got four more months until she’s full term,” Draco said in his ear. “You think you can keep up?”
“You are really selling this.”
“Oof, not sure if I can,” Harry said. “I’ve just had three cinnamon rolls. Maybe if you rubbed this thing I could fit a bit more in it.”
“Two and a half,” Harry said.
“It’s true,” Fleur said sadly. “Look at ‘is belly!”
Draco frowned, finding he did not like the thought of Potter burning calories he couldn’t afford to lose. He pushed the buttered loaf closer and was gratified when Potter picked up a thick slice and began sopping up the cream sauce.
The blonde man washed himself and slipped naked into his cool sheets afterwards. The exhaustion from work, the hot shower and the relaxation that orgasm had brought him - all this made him fall asleep quickly.
„I can’t believe you never tried!”
“Aww, c’mere, baby”, Harry chuckled, pulling Draco closer to his chest. He lifted his thumb up to Draco’s mouth, gently pulling his plumb lower lip from between his teeth. “Stop biting that pretty lip of yours, love… How am I supposed to kiss you then?”
Draco feels dizzy and clear at the same time. He sees Harry moving slowly on top of him, feels his cock sliding in and out of him. The pressure against his prostate is back, making him leak precome on his stomach. Green eyes above him, divine smell around him, strong body on top of him… This is just the perfect place to be.
In the afternoon the two got visitors again, who had nothing to do with a medical emergency. At a timid knock, a bushy brown head slid through the door.
"Granger!
“Less talking, more fucking!”
to me!”
After the meeting, the young healers made their way to their wards. Draco took the elevator down to the ground floor and directly behind the door of the emergency room he was welcomed by a resolute but good-natured looking master healer with short black and white hair.
are you?!”
"Potter, shut the fuck up." The words were much softer than Draco had ever said them and before he knew what was happening he felt soft, full lips on his own.
We stumbled back onto the main road. Well, I stumbled and pressed the cane even firmer against my prostate and Harry strutted like the bastard he is.
The blonde healer straightened up again and wiped his face. What the hell had happened? Potter had apparently caught some bizarre curse. Draco believed that this Italian thing was just a strange side effect. The real problem had been the panic attack at the sight of a wand. He also seemed to have hallucinations. What did these... Russians, Benson said? What had they planted in his head, what had triggered such a reaction?
"Darling, that's all right... I'm with you..." He gently stroked his friend, who only opened his eyes again after a minute.
Harry palpated his bleeding nose, twitching a bit, when a small twinge shot through, but all in all he concluded that it wasn’t broken.
“Fuck, fuck…”, Draco sobs. He can’t think, can’t talk. He nearly feels overwhelmed and struggles with his breath.
Draco nodded resignedly, collapsed on his stool and breathed deeply once to return to his usual professionalism.
A not unfamiliar voice made Draco look into the other corner of the room.
“Are you fucking serious?!” Why was his heart pounding so loud in his ears?
Ron stared and he quickly covered his glowing red ears. “Lalala, I can’t hear you!”, he sang, and I chuckled.
, that's it! That's enough now!
“And with the guys I was with after, it was never a question that I’m the one topping”, Harry continued, looking up to Draco with a sceptical look.
Harry wrapped his lips around Draco’s cock again and his fingers around the base of his bollocks. He heard Draco’s moan turn into a pained whimper when he increased the pressure and pulled the sensible balls.
"Save the small talk, Potter, and sit down."
Draco’s finger was back at his entrance, gently massaging Harry’s rim. He didn’t even notice that his back and thighs were tense, until they relaxed more and more. He even felt his rim getting softer under Draco’s hands. It definitely felt pleasant.
Pansy makes her way back to the bedroom and snatches her muggle mobile phone from the nightstand. She dials Ron’s number, biting her nails while waiting for the redhead to pick up.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked down on him. “How could I
Suddenly there was a heavy knock at the door and a nurse from the foyer stormed in.
"I hallucinated that all the people I love would be tortured and tormented until they finally turned against me because Voldemort convinced them that I was to blame for their suffering. And I saw all of their dead or injured bodies, screaming for help."
"Harry, hey, wake up! Everything is fine, it's just a dream..."
"I know what you're thinking. I'm used to it already. Yes, I was a Death Eater and yes, I did some things I'm really not proud of. But now I am here. I have changed. And I finally want to show what I can do. I want to learn and heal and make my contribution and for that I need your support".
“’Mione went home to see her parents, since it’s the first Christmas after the war. Ginny and Luna are at Xenophilius’ place. We can ask Neville! What about Pansy, Theo and Blaise?”
“Yeah, baby… that’s better…” Harry closed his eyes again, his skin tingling.
“I was fucking missing you! Can you let me in?”
The black-haired man smiled and Merlin… that was the most beautiful smile Draco had seen in years.
Draco mockingly raised an eyebrow. "Am I the healer here or are you?"
As before, he stretched Potter's head back and held his jaw apart with one hand. With the other he let the light blue liquid drip into his patient's mouth. With a cough and a snort and a confused look Harry Potter awoke suddenly and stared into Draco's relieved grinning face.
Harry’s eyes feel tired and sore, but his mind is awake. He was stirring and twisting around in bed, feeling itchy and too hot, for about 2 hours. Irritated he gives up on moving from side to side and throws the blanket from his shoulders, leaving it pooling around his knees. He just can’t sleep. So, with the help of a few pillows, he props himself up against the headboard and starts reading, even though he has a hard time concentrating. Already after a few pages his thoughts wander back and forth, but mostly to the man he loves. He wishes nothing more than to be with Draco right now. Sighing softly, he turns the page, the rustling of the paper the only sound in the room – except a gentle tock against the window. Harry’s hands stop moving and he tilts his head. Has he misheard? Another tock wakes up his Auror instincts. There is someone outside the window.
Phew! Lucky me...
A warm rush of breath swept over my ear. “Fuck you.”
grade.
"Do you have pain?" Draco's voice was now honestly worried. He couldn't bear it at all when his beloved was suffering. "Where?"
The man took of his sunglasses and grinned. “Harry, to be more specific.” He offered a hand, which Draco took, cheeks burning red.
have to tell him that his fiancé bailed on him!”
"I think you' re also a great benefit to the ER. I congratulated your chief healer Jones directly on her recruitment. Such smart guys are always needed."
“Fuck, you look so hot, baby…”
Draco gasped and groaned at another hard thrust against his prostate.
He looked up and down his body. “What’s wrong with it?”
Draco looked down into those beautiful eyes. "I think it would be nice if we could manage to be friends," he replied honestly and saw relief streaming through Harry's face. That nasty little voice in the back of his head, shouting to him that he might want more than just to be Harry's
Ginny didn’t need to be told twice. She held his belly in her hands and beamed at him as if he really was the pregnant one. “Sorry,” she said, “you’re just so fucking cute like this. Emmaline, is he not precious?”
“But getting back to the

it exactly, but he wasn’t going to bring it up of his own volition either.
"Right." He agreed against his better judgement, but it was true. Draco was his friend now and it didn’t seem like he was going to escape that fact—dark lord connections or not. Besides, at least the blond seemed reasonable about the whole thing—which was more than could be said about many of the witches and wizards Harry had met so far for sure. He sighed and let go—in for a penny, in for a pound as they said. "And I've no clue what

And he realized
“I guess.” Neville shrugged a bit, readjusting his bag. “I’ll be happy to see Gran. Uh… for maybe a couple days.” He grimaced, and Harry smiled sympathetically. Neville seemed to have a love/hate thing for his grandmother—he clearly loved her and thought highly of her, all while simultaneously being scared out of his wits of her.
Draco seemed to carefully note the sudden silence and took another bite of his lunch pointedly as if this weren’t anything unusual. Harry shifted so his bag was resting at his feet, getting comfortable as if nothing were wrong.
There was a small, blue-flowered plant potted in a beautiful white teacup from Neville, with a note of instructions for its care and identifying it as a Blue Lace flower, which supposedly gave off a calming effect with its soft blue pollen. A pair of leather flying gloves from Seamus, chocolates from Hannah, a pretty hand-made bookmark from Susan, a crocheted handkerchief with his initials on it with a box of rock-cakes from Hagrid, at least three kilos of various candies from his slightly-less-close but no less friendly connections around Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw, and a new book on centering his mind from Hermione

Seamus and Dean seemed like nice guys, though they hadn’t had much of a chance to talk last night since it was late by the time they got back from the feast and they were all practically in a food coma. They’d done the obligatory exploration of the spacious, frankly lavish-yet-cozy room, claiming their spots and getting settled in just enough to not be total messes come the morning, but had retired pretty quickly. Dean seemed muggleborn as his posters were of muggle football teams, but Seamus could’ve been anything as he was enthusiastic about everything he encountered, but not overly shocked either. Seamus seemed a little slow on the uptake sometimes since sarcasm clearly flew over his head, but he’d noticed Neville’s silence and been genuinely nice to him without getting in the shy boy’s face about why he wasn’t saying much.

The best part was that the beanie was designed to be baggy at the back which meant there was plenty of room for his hair to grow out a bit and no one realize what he had going on under the hat, which left him free to grow his hair out as long as he wanted and then work on cutting it more normally instead of the crazy hap-hazard thing he'd been doing up until that point.

he could then use it to achieve his goals—and if that wasn’t the very definition of a Slytherin he wasn’t sure what was.
"What the heck Harry, you said you'd never played before!" His dormmate was in a right fit as he glared at the ball ten meters behind him, but the light in his eyes told Harry he wasn't actually in the least bit upset. In fact, he could've sworn he saw that same glint in McGonagall's eyes when she introduced him to Oliver, so he knew he was probably doomed.

And it kind of felt like an echo of what he’d felt when he’d learned he had his mother’s hair.
Harry was anticipating a very loud night back at Gryffindor tower to celebrate their win, and so took this opportunity of being ignored to have a quieter dinner at the Slytherin table.
important, even if they had no idea how or why.
That night for dinner he laid out a Thanksgiving feast any American would drool over, setting the table immaculately and scrubbing the kitchen spotless. He whipped up deserts and filled a basket with sweets in the place he knew Dudley looked first. When his aunt and uncle got home, Vernon praised Petunia and she took all the credit as Harry knew she would—he remained in the pantry organizing his stores and mentally cataloging for future meals and entirely out of sight while they enjoyed what he’d done, him already having eaten his fill as it was made and in much healthier quantities. They ate themselves into a food coma and then retired to the living room to watch TV and talk about nothing; Harry cleaned up every dish and packed the rest in neat lunch boxes for tomorrow, though they’d eaten most of horrifyingly enough so he had new sandwiches and chips to toss in too.
There was a lot going on in his head but remembering that Draco was still his best friend and the Monroe family was now
Lu had only taken notice of her because her sense of style was even weirder than Harry’s, and had quickly noticed her year mates avoided her like the plague. And then her shoes had started going missing and Lu knew something was up. He wasn’t planning on getting involved with the first years’ drama until he’d casually mentioned it to Susan during lunch one day, and she’d steadfast

But even as he thought that, he couldn’t bring himself to think that he was
He was buying a lot of things because Draco told him to, he realized belatedly, but it all seemed like decent advice, so he went with it.
He stuck one below the window in the upper center of his new living space and immediately the soft, periwinkle, sparkly wonder started working, much to his relief. The increasingly hot shed
To be frank, he was really impressed.
Making Severus his son's godfather was a tactical move worthy of Slytherin, nothing more—Severus had always been aware of this, and of what Draco meant to his father.
just happened.” He paused for dramatic effect but was clearly too eager to wait that long. “
And he had been, for about five minutes now.
“Gifts?” He blinked.
Harry smiled in amusement at the two—they took the twin thing very seriously apparently. It was also encouraging they didn’t give a quaffle about his hair other than to joke around about it, which he appreciated. They seemed nice.
And his father had a grave too. It felt… clearer, somehow, separating the graves although they were definitely laid side by side. He never met them after all, he didn’t know what they’d say to

"If you cannot be civil then simply ignore his presence entirely, is all I'm asking." Lucius’ tone was reasonable and calm—there was little wonder how he charmed his way into high ranking positions, he was worse than a politician and his grey eyes were sharp like a snake. "And you will do it because you too love my son, and you will be dooming him to either hate you for ruining his chances, or suffer through your own failure. Are you truly so petty? If you are then we've no more reason to speak, as I cannot abide those who would purposefully injure my son so." His voice had ice sliding down it, only just so slightly threatening to be cold if Severus did not answer correctly right now.
or they were willing to commit the social blunder of ignoring how awkward them listening in on this would be in the name of gathering information. Not that he could blame them.

It was calming here.
The original plan was to room with Goyle and Crabbe, since his family had alliances with them. Neither Vincent nor Gregory were all that bright so his father had arranged a 'follow my son around and guard him' sort of deal that both families had been fine with—it got them on the Malfoy's good books, and the two's parents figured Draco was going to be climbing the ladder, so to speak, and so to come along for the ride couldn't hurt. Neither set of parents had much faith their sons would be doing any social climbing on their own after all, so wanted to do what they could for their children while they had the chance before sending them off to Hogwarts. Both were dark families though, and with the Malfoy's switching to grey his father had negotiated a different deal—something to do with the three families’ businesses and the Crabbe and Goyle parents weren't thrilled with the lost advantage their sons had, but were soothed by the increase in wealth coming into their vault.

And despite the surprise Neville’s mother hen traits were, it was not that he didn’t mind the moment to rest: Astronomy was held at midnight and he was still an early riser so that was definitely going to take some getting used to. He thought it was kind of stupid, to have a class that late on Wednesday night, and then they’d just announced that flying lessons would begin next week on Thursday afternoons, so the current hour Harry was wasting down at Hagrid’s. It was poor planning on someone’s part because he was already tired as hell from the sudden lack of sleep and then adding something dangerous (as McGonagall had implied) like flying and he failed to see why this was a good idea for eleven-year-olds. Astronomy couldn’t be on a Friday, for example, when they didn’t have to get up and get on with the rest of the week? And it wasn’t plenty dark enough at 10pm instead of midnight to see the stars?
“Monroe actually,” He corrected
Theo frowned deeply while Blaise tisked in annoyance.

Even with how much time he spent at Gringotts, sitting with Axeclaw and visiting three vaults with an extended stay in two, when he left he was still walking down Diagon Alley pretty much alone since he still had half an hour until the earliest shops opened, and an hour until a lot of the main ones he wanted to frequent opened. Given that there wasn’t a soul in sight, he took to getting the lay of the land without a huge crowd of people in the way, walking down the Alley and seeing the shops once more. He ended up by Knockturn Alley and remembered Hagrid’s warning not to go down there.
So… yeah, this was awkward.
like his dad but holy shit the longer he sat across from Mrs. Malfoy the more he saw Draco’s future and if that wasn’t terrifying he didn’t know what was.

In fact, he was only half sure most of the

Draco let his talent instead of his father’s money do the talking instead, which Harry liked quite a bit honestly. He wouldn’t have judged Draco either way, not out loud at least, since there could’ve been a million
For now it was just the boys playing, Lu, Seamus, and Dean against Harry and Neville. Neville had been hanging back by their make-shift goal on the most part since no one seemed to be able to keep up with Harry if he got the ball, but he wasn't very good at getting the ball
Draco’s words from that morning rang though Harry’s ears as he quietly mulled that over. An

If only he had been brave enough to do such a foolish, terrible thing. Horrible as this coming lesson would be… maybe, Severus thought, maybe having Lily in the end would’ve made it worth it. He didn’t know, and he realized he would never know. Because he’d been a coward, and he’d thought of his own hide first and foremost… not risking being bold or anything Gryffindor-like even for just a second to be with his childhood friend.
Magic is one thing, but no one ever said anything about ghosts!” He blurted out before he could stop himself, and Draco snickered quietly beside him.
“What will you do now that you know?” She asked, and Minerva frowned deeply at the paper in front of her, entirely disturbed.
He could see where Daphne was coming from: friendship didn’t trump business. Daphne herself was one thing, she might be conflicted to find another way to go about doing it that wouldn’t directly hurt him, but her father didn’t necessarily have the same concerns. And if he didn’t care if Harry got hurt in the process, this might end up really badly.

"A curse just for killing? Christ wizards are so excessive—a cutting curse to the neck not good enough for the great and overly dramatic Lord Voldemort, huh? Would've saved you a lot of death and humiliation if you weren't such an egotistical drama queen."
Harry had gotten a clean bill of health from Madam Pomfrey just earlier that morning which really only continued to surprise him as everyone else around who was raised in magical families seemed totally unperturbed by how fast magical medicine worked. That meant today he was allowed to participate in some mild exercise to get back into shape before his quidditch match next weekend, and if his chosen activity was football, all the better to let his still sore shoulder rest up a bit more.
Boy x Boy
"She's pregnant Sev."
Bottom Severus Snape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Marauders Time:
today's the day! Today's the day I'm gonna tell him!!
“So full,” Harry gasped.
“Fuck,” Potter said. “You’re a menace.”
Merlin, I’m enormous, he realized. He was twenty-three stone and feeling every ounce.
Harry laughed.
“Yes?”
“I’d love to come over,” he said. “If you manage to finish this lasagna.”
“No,” Potter said, sighing a little. He was getting full. “No, that’d be me.”
Harry paused briefly to wonder if he’d ever get over being called sir by grizzled men twice his age, then moved on. He stuttered briefly as his eye caught the next assignment.
“Oh, we’ve got to report on everything,” Potter said officiously, then relented with another laugh. “No, actually, the janitorial staff handles the toilet paper. Anyway – thanks for the coffee.”
“A date,” Pansy Parkinson pronounced. “Definitely, indisputably, disgustingly, a date. Oh, if I could go back in time and tell the little prat I used to snog that one day he’d be head-over-heels for Harry fucking Potter.”
His second thought was that Potter looked completely different.
“That’s dinner,” Harry said.
He turned to leave, and didn’t look back. But he did allow himself a small smile as he heard the crinkling of a brown paper bag.
“Well, yes. And that I’m adding a bit of a belly.”
“I made shepherd’s pie,” Ron said. “One for me and ‘Mione, one for you.”
“All right, well, thank you for your professional input. Haven’t you some work to do?”
Harry paused, then unwrapped another frog. “We’ve met.”
“Fine,” he said dramatically. “I suppose I might as well put this theoretical bisexuality into practice.”
“Yes, I really went out of my way,” Draco said drily, and Potter let out another startled-sounding laugh.
“But how can they fit one day and not fit the next?”
“Merlin, I thought Hermione was the pregnant one! Ron told me you’d packed it on but I didn’t believe him! Look at you!”
It was true, there were beads of sweat on his forehead from the effort and, if he was honest, from the pain. His jeans were unbuttoned again but he still felt squished into them, and the sensitive skin of his taut belly was rubbing uncomfortably against his t-shirt. He was full up to his very lungs, glasses sliding down his damp nose and pulse pounding in his ears.
“For a meal, I mean. I mean, you always bring me food and, and it doesn’t seem fair, I should, I should take you to dinner, I think, maybe. Maybe tomorrow? I should maybe take you to dinner tomorrow?” Harry was aware he was babbling but had absolutely no idea how to stop.
“I feel awful for him if he’s a boy,” Ron confided. “Hermione will never get over it.”
He may as well take advantage while he could.
“Define bad,” Draco said, then relented. “It could have been much worse. I think she likes Harry, actually. She’s always a soft touch for a celebrity.”
“What,” Draco said, “you never entertained the idea of a Granger-Weasley sandwich?”
“You need –”
“Mine gets itchy sometimes,” Harry confessed. “I think because it’s so stretched.”
Potter’s hand, already closing around the paper sack, stilled. There was a moment’s silence and then Potter said, “Nor am I.”
Harry felt himself flush. “How can you tell? About the stretching charm, I mean.”
“I agree,” Ron said, and Harry looked at him in surprise. “Not,” Ron added, “that I’ll stop giving you shit about it.”
“Ice cream,” Draco decided, and pushed to his feet. He was quite naked, and he let Harry admire him for a moment. Harry himself looked absolutely debauched, trousers and boxers around his ankles, shirt flung to the side, belly still so swollen it was almost shining. Draco let himself put a kiss on that tortured skin, right above the flattened belly button, and felt Harry’s hands briefly grip his hair. Then he went into the kitchen for the ice cream.
“Here,” Ron said generously, adding another scoop of sugared berries and another mound of whipped cream to Harry’s plate. “Have a bit more.”
“I – you should know, too. I love you. Also.”
“Not my intention.”
“Can’t imagine it,” Ron marveled, not for the first time. “Malfoy in the kitchen.”
Pansy slapped Harry’s belly lightly. “Hips,” she said, and Harry canted his hips so she could tug off his jeans, not without some difficulty on both their parts. By the time she was done, Harry was panting.
“My point is, I know overstretched trousers when I see them, and the charm’s not going to cut it anymore, boss. You need new clothes.”
An old, bitter part of Draco hissed at this. Trust Potter to bring that up, to glorify himself and humiliate Draco. But a newer, better part of Draco managed to look Potter in the eye, to see that he wasn’t trying to win points or one-up or humiliate: he was simply stating the truth.
“You’ve certainly gained a few, haven’t you?”
“C’mon,” Draco said, reaching for him, and Harry let himself be hauled to his feet.
“So,” Pansy said after Harry had cleaned his first plate and started in on the second. “Where exactly in this process does the sex usually start?”
“Anywhere,” Draco confirmed, though he met Harry’s eyes to make sure. Harry nodded fervently and attempted to swallow the enormous bite Draco had just fed him.
“Is it just me,” Wendy said to Draco one afternoon several weeks later, “or is your boy-toy, my esteemed boss, looking extra-round today?”
“Not true!” Harry shouted.
“It’s me that needs protecting,” Harry said, swallowing cheese. “Ron won’t quit poking my belly.”
“Yes!” Hermione squealed. “We’re having a baby!”
“Er –”
Draco placed a hand on the side of Harry’s belly. “Yes, a bit.”
Draco’s hand paused, then resumed, its firm rubbing. “By ‘like this,’ do you mean rather fat?”
Potter raised his eyebrows. “Why?”
Draco made him another piece and stroked his belly gently as he ate it. He could feel the swell of Harry’s hip pressed into his own side and he leaned down to mouth at one of Harry’s pudgy pecs through the cotton of his shirt. Harry let out a little whimper and let Draco fill his mouth with more bread and cheese.
Harry let out a soft belch, which turned into a sigh. “Well,” he said, “that’s me done, sorry, this is my couch now.”
After all, everyone knew the way to a man’s heart was to his stomach.
“Excellent,” Harry said fervently, and it was. The meat was tender and juicy, the gravy flavorful, the potatoes creamy, the crust flaky and buttery. He noticed with some consternation that he’d already eaten about a quarter of his, while Ron and Hermione hadn’t even gotten that far in the one they were sharing. He forced himself to slow down, to stop shoveling the food in like it was going somewhere. Vestiges from a childhood of deprivation, Draco had once said, and Harry had snapped at him not to pop-psychologize, but probably it was true. He had some more bread instead, layering it thickly with butter, and more champagne.
“Yes, but don’t worry, she’s quite gay. Engaged to a woman on her Quidditch team, Emmaline, she’ll be here too.”
“I was told aurors were out in the mornings,” Draco said, then winced. He didn’t want Potter to know he was avoiding him; didn’t want him to know he still held any power over Draco whatsoever. But Potter only nodded.
“Okay, we’re all agreed that my knees are very sensitive, please can we get going?”
“So how much do you weigh, total?” Pansy wanted to know.
“I’m not – ow! – not felled by – ow! Christ, I’m too – oof! – full for this.”
“I ate a gallon of cookie dough ice cream last night and barely even felt it,” Harry confessed. “I think my capacity’s growing. Along with the actual belly.”
“I mean, you know. Er – emotionally.”
“Had a dinner party last night,” Draco half-lied. His mother had been over, anyway. “Too many leftovers.”
“Give it up, dearie,” Harry’s mirror advised. “It’s a lost cause.”
“Yeah,” Potter breathed. “Bet it’s – gorgeous. If it’s – anything like –”
“I’m going to need encouragement to get that down,” Harry said, nodding at the lasagna. “I’m absolutely stuffed.”
Another crack and Kreacher appeared with a steaming wheel of baked brie and a hot baguette.
“He’s different,” Harry said. “I mean, it’s strange – his personality’s essentially the same, only… pleasant.”
“That’s eighty-four American,” Draco murmured, unable to help himself. Eighty-four just sounded so much more impressive than five.
The floo trip into the Ministry was unpleasant, to say the least, and Harry found it difficult to concentrate on the meeting he led each morning. Usually he paced around as he spoke, but today he sat gingerly on the edge of a table, mindful of how full he still was, and rattled off the day’s agenda.
Dinner was a joint effort between Draco and Kreacher, a huge pot of beef bourgeon with sides of buttered noodles and buttered peas, with the requisite loaves of bread and butter. The good food and good conversation distracted Harry from his self-involved thoughts, and he let Draco fill and refill his plate until the others had long since stopped eating and his belly was even more roundly swollen and aching than it had been. He draped an arm over it, sighing in satisfaction and fullness as he watched Draco dish him up one last plateful.
“Try me,” Harry said.
Not that hearts had anything to do with making Potter lunch. No, this was purely tactical.
“Are you planning me a second dinner?” Harry said, wide-eyed. “Why? You don’t want your mum to see the way I eat?”
“A lot of fish and chips,” Draco added. “I’ve had a craving, myself, and I can never get the batter right.”
“Never was much good at that,” Potter gasped. He turned his head yearningly and Draco obliged him, meeting his mouth in a hot rush, a kiss that started out gentle but almost immediately became something more, urgent and insistent and desperate. He got his tongue on that little white scar, at last, sucking on Potter’s tender lower lip and then biting down. Before he quite knew what was happening Draco found himself straddling Potter’s lap, that stupid face between his hands, kissing him for all he was worth as Potter arched his back and groaned. That round belly pressed into Draco’s torso and he couldn’t stop himself from rutting up against it, Potter making the most amazing little noises beneath him, pushing at Draco’s shirt trying to get it off him.
“You are too kind, Little Lord Malfoy,” Kreacher said. “Will you want me to start on dinner?”
“I couldn’t,” Potter repeated, but more doubtfully this time. Draco rolled his eyes. He ought to leave it be, ought to turn and go, but Potter really did look too thin, his jawline sharp, his t-shirt hanging from those broad shoulders as on a clothes hanger. And why should Draco care? It was good office politics, he told himself. If he wanted to get ahead – if he ever wanted to make a damn friend – it was in his best interest to keep Potter from badmouthing him left and right. How could he badmouth if his mouth was full?
“Of course.”
“I have no doubt.”
“This has to be, what, four stone?”
“Yes, and right here, even,” Hermione said, “right around the belly button.”
,” Harry protested, buttering a hunk of bread. “Just… some.”
“Six?” Draco said avidly.
“You’ll think I’m mental,” Potter said, reaching for his second slice of focaccia, “but I’ve actually started to like paperwork a bit. Don’t tell anyone. Maybe I’ve had enough adventure for one lifetime, you know?”
“Yes,” Draco agreed, breathless for totally different reasons. “We should, we should get you flat, get you comfortable.”
Draco stood very straight, fixing his expression into what his mother called the Unmovable Malfoy and willing Potter to understand. He might not be asking for atonement, but Draco needed to give it. It was a truth he hadn’t quite realized until this very moment.
Harry balanced the plate on the crest of his belly, supporting it with one hand and stuffing two more eggs into his mouth in quick succession.
“Nah, invite her,” Harry said. “She’s always good for a laugh, and I’ll feel better if it’s not just me and your mum in a staring contest.”
“I’m sure you’d be beautiful no matter –”
“Let’s get you out of this jumper, hmm,” Draco murmured, and Harry leaned forward over his belly enough that Draco could pull the jumper off. Bare, his belly looked enormous and pale, a swollen moon, and Harry pressed a palm soothingly against it.
“Oh, I doubt that,” Draco said. “I rather think Kreacher and I are on the same team, generally.”
“How fat I’ve let myself get,” Harry said baldly, and felt Draco’s fingers tighten painfully on his thigh.
“Then we won’t.”
Draco was looking at him with raised brows. “You certainly ate it fast enough. All the Weasleys are bringing you food and telling you how big you’ve gotten, I’m practically vestigial.”
“I think so,” Harry said.
Malfoy looked surprised, then avid. “Courtesy of your godfather, I assume. I can only imagine what kinds of horrors you found in there… Rugs cursed to smother you? Teapots that eat your face?”
“Draco,” Pansy said, “Draco, you’ve got to call your mum and cancel, we are absolutely drunk.”
Potter skimmed a hand over that mess of unruly black hair, and smiled.
Harry smiled as Ginny reappeared with not only the drinks, but also a heavy plate of salami and more cheese, which she set on the coffee table in front of them. Harry leaned to reach for it, then paused, startled, when he realized how much his belly was getting in the way. Draco beat him to it, leaning with ease and holding it up for him. Harry nodded his thanks and piled salami onto a cracker, his face a bit red. It was all very well and good to joke about being nine months pregnant, but Merlin, he really was getting big, and fast. He ate another mouthful of cheese, another mouthful of salami, and looked down at how his stomach was creeping forward on his lap, not even full yet, but so round. The plate of cheese and crackers was clean now, and a few more bites finished off the salami.
“Yes, yes, you’ve told me this before. Anyway, isn’t a tie a bit much?”
“Well, you must be hungry,” Molly said, then flushed. “I don’t mean because you’ve – I only meant –”
“Right, excuse me. I meant, take the trousers that mysteriously aren’t closing, just this morning, for no reason at all, and lay them flat on the bed. Then, with your wand held lengthwise…”
“Thank you for that,” Draco said.
But to his own surprise, he did. He went back the very next day, lunch sack in hand, and found Potter glaring at the coffee machine.
“I want a motorcycle,” she said clearly.
“Aside from killing Voldemort, yes. Ugh, how did I fall in love with someone who calls him the Dark Lord?”
“Well, better too snug than too loose,” Pansy reasoned.
“Draco, I hate to break it to you,” Harry said, “but I’m getting rather fat, and I don’t think she’ll miss it.”
“It’s good,” Potter murmured. “Thanks.”
“Anywhere?” Pansy asked Harry, looking delighted.
“You’re the one feeding me crisps,” Harry said, mouth full.
“Speaking of,” Harry said, dropping the file on the desk. “We’re partners for this case.”
“Probably.”
“Oh shush,” Molly said. “Harry, I for one am thrilled to see you so comfortable. You were always such a thin child, it used to worry me awfully. This is much better, if you ask me.”
“Would that be – do you want me to?”
Harry pushed another egg into his mouth, then another, taking advantage of the fact that for once, no one was looking at them. He finished the second plate with a little burp of triumph and Draco stacked the empties on the coffee table. He caught Ginny eyeing him from across the room and grinned at her. A moment later she was at his side, offering him a plate piled high with cheese and crackers.
Pansy reappeared, floating three glasses, a bottle of wine, one fork, one plate, and the pan of lasagna. Draco hurried to arrange his coasters to accommodate the hot pan while Pansy settled herself back on Harry’s lap, snuggling around the round swell of his belly. She looked so slight compared to him, blond where he was dark, small where he was thick, and Draco felt his interest begin to stir in earnest.
