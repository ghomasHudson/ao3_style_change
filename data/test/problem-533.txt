“So what’s on the agenda for tonight?” Draco poured them each a cup of tea, making Harry’s extra sweet in hopes of coaxing him into a lighter mood.
“It’s unnatural- a sin against God himself! We did all we could to squash it out of him. Our greatest shame is failing to make him normal. You’ll all burn in hell for your perversion come judgment day.” Petunia spat at him.
“I’ll try.” Harry shuffled into the tent and collapsed onto his bunk, falling asleep almost instantly.
“I’m buried in paperwork, Zack.” Harry groaned, motioning towards the teetering pile in front of him.
“It’s just- everyone from our Gryffindor dorm gets together once a month and we drink and play billiards and catch up. It’s always a lot of fun, so I was wondering if Slytherins do anything like that.” He looked slightly uncomfortable.
“How are you doing? I’m sorry I had to miss your birthday.” Harry rested his hand on George’s cheek, searching his brilliant hazel eyes.
The taste of his skin, the softness of his hair, the unspoken promise in his emerald eyes, the feeling of their cocks rubbing together through their clothing, and Harry’s scent- Salazar help him, Harry’s scent. He pulled Harry's shirt up so he could smell it more easily, exposing his chest to the chilly night air while he pumped with fast, even strokes.
“I thought we had cured you of this abnormality. Apparently, the lesson didn’t stick.” His Uncle seemed to regard the damaged skin with a sick fondness. “Perhaps another visit to conversion therapy is in order.”
“Right. Or steamy snogging sessions if they aren’t going to...go anywhere.” He hedged uncertainty. "Before we continue, I need to know if this is going to go anywhere."
“You think my life is perfect? You know NOTHING! You weren’t there when I was getting locked in a cupboard under my uncle’s stairs because something unexplainable happened. You weren’t there when I had to sneak food in the middle of the night because I had asked too many questions and got sent to the cupboard without dinner. You weren’t there when my cousin used me as his bloody punching bag and bullied any of the kids in school who dared to be nice to me. You don’t know what it's like to be despised by everyone in your family and not even know why. You’ve never had to feed your owl what little food you were given and live off the cheap broth for weeks just because you’re magical or be suddenly forced into a world you know nothing about where everyone already knows your name and expects great things from you because of something that you don’t even remember. You don’t understand what it feels like to be attacked by Voldemort twice before you’re even fully aware of who he is or what it feels like to be ostracised by the whole school because you can talk to snakes or fight a basilisk with your eyes closed while your friend’s life hangs in the balance. You’ve never had to fight off a hundred dementors at once before they got the chance to kiss you and the closest thing you have ever had to a parent or be forced to watch a classmate die just because he was there! You weren’t tortured in a graveyard and forced to duel Voldemort on a broken leg or attacked by the daily prophet for telling the truth or forced to use a sodding blood quill! You haven't had to watch all of your friends face death eaters knowing that you’re the one who put their lives in danger! You never had to watch your godfather be murdered right in front of you or be possessed by Voldemort or watch Dumbledore die or be responsible for Mad Eye’s death! You weren’t the reason Draco was forced to torture people or the reason your friends got captured and tortured for information about you! You didn’t have to carry out an impossible mission given to you by someone who only ever saw you as an expendable pawn or face your death wandless because you were the last Horcrux. You didn’t have to watch your first love die in battle or lose the only other person you love because being with him too fucking painful, or - or-” Harry couldn’t go on any longer.
“Yeah, I guess I have. We actually get along surprisingly well.” Harry said bemusedly. “You know, when we’re not trying to hex each other.”
Maybe he had misread the signs. Every lingering glance might have simply been professional courtesy. All of the playful jokes could have been just an attempt to diffuse the hostility of their past. Every fond eye roll could have merely been for his benefit. Each casual touch that had set his skin on fire could have purely been accidental. Was he projecting his inane attraction and reading too deeply into things?
“We’ve got it covered, Mr. Malfoy.” Bill shot Draco a friendly wink. “If we need anything we will send for you.”
"Draco's wand." Harry said reverently, cradling his hawthorn wand. "I lost it in the forest. How did you-"
“It ripped open your chest?” The haughty wizard scoffed in disbelief. “I’ve never heard of a spell that can do that.”
Pansy sighed impatiently as she knocked for the third time. Draco didn’t normally sleep in and she was eager to see what had become of their nefarious planning. Did Harry stop by or not? She gave him a generous additional five seconds before digging her spare key out and letting herself in.
He can’t quite believe any of this is real. Sirius just got knocked back, he’d be popping around the other side of the dais any moment now. He’d shake his hair out of his face with a laugh and go charging right back into battle.
“The bloody idiot used gilly weed! There is never a guarantee of how long it will last! What was he thinking?” He hissed to her out of the side of his mouth.
Theo’s jaw dropped as the redhead turned and pulled Draco into a passionate kiss. When they broke apart they both downed their drinks and slipped out the back. Was he dating both of them?
“Your sacrifice is truly noble. We all thank you for your service.” Blaise patted Theo on the back, earning a round of laughter from the group.
“Yeah, what’s it to you?” Ron scrunched his eyes up in confusion and Pansy resisted the urge to smack him.
Alright, so this was originally part of chapter 19, but then I realized it was 23 pages long so I broke it up into more manageable sections. This is Draco's Housewarming party and there are some cute Drarry moments! I hope you love reading it as much as I loved writing it!
“He will be ok, Draco.” Pansy leaned her head on his which was the only form of comfort she could offer while they were all huddled up together for warmth.
He was meeting Harry just up the street for lunch so he decided to walk. The sun was shining and the streets of Barnton were filled with happy shoppers slurping ice creams and laughing together. It was picture perfect. Heat simmered off the tarmac and Draco rolled up his sleeves. Summer was in full swing.
“Maybe next time we can see if it’s possible to rent out a private pod.” Harry suggested as they moved closer to the platform, coming to a stop on the bottom step.
What seemed like an eternity later they finally arrived at the infirmary. Draco shouldered the door open and was pleased to find that his assumption had been correct. The room was completely deserted. Some supplies had fallen onto the floor, but the beds were unoccupied and Madam Pomfrey’s office door was ajar, revealing it to be empty as well. Draco let Greg go and levitated him onto the closest bed before rushing over to the supply cupboard. His hands were shaking as he pulled vials and sprays out. It was one thing to read about the theory behind healing magic and feel that you understood it. It was another thing to perform it without any training or practice.
Draco blinked as inspiration struck. He could tell him he was a dancer. After that revelation, it would come as no surprise that he was gay. Draco could come clean of all of his secrets in one fell swoop, kill two birds with one stone as it were. He smiled when he remembered the tickets Madame Juliette had given him. It was perfect.
“A toffee flavored latte. It sounded good, but it tastes horrible. You don’t have to drink it, I can go buy something else.” He tried to hand Draco his cappuccino back again but Draco waved him off.
“That’s only because we were with the girls and his parents. If I just waltzed up to him on his own I’m sure he’d hex me in half a second.”
“It’s a green chili pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated in eggs and cheese.” Granger answered automatically.
Hello, lovelies! I am being (jokingly) THREATENED and (lovingly) BULLIED to hurry things along till we get to THE KISS. SO. Here is the next chapter one week ahead of schedule. If you feel cheated out of the string of non-dates, worry not! AFTER I get to the kiss, I will take time out to write some up for the Outtakes and Oneshots series and you will be able to find them there. As always, a huge thank you to my darling AlexClio and my lovely SandZhark for beta reading for me! This is officially the longest story I've ever written and it's largely thanks to them and their continued support (and death threats and bullying, of course)
MASSIVE HUGE SHOUT OUT TO SANDZHARK! They helped me fix some of the finer details because I am not very familiar with ballet or the performing arts, and of course, we need a shout-out to my precious baby Puff Ari for being my reading guineapig and letting me know how the content reads! Hope you enjoy this chapter!
"That's alright. It's not your job to know. It's your job to get through it." Draco gave his hand a reassuring squeeze.
“I honestly haven’t had the chance. I haven’t seen him since everyone else started to get here.” He moved away from her fingers, trying to dodge the next round of rib poking.
However, the biggest damper on the season was Halloween. The death of his parents had gotten no easier as he aged, in fact, the growing isolation that he was burrowing himself into had led even his chosen family to feel disconnected from him.
“Wow, rooming with Draco, I’m sure you must be enjoying yourself” Ron said genuinely, giving Hermione a look and giggling lightly.
“Ok… what’s your question?” he replies, bringing his attention back to the pan in front of him. He looks hot when he cooks, Draco thought.
Harry felt the nerves in his spine ignite, he had his differences with Draco but he knew the pain of losing his parents. He wasn’t sure how Draco would react to the news of his parents being targets of the Renovation, but he knew that he had a right to know. If Harry had an option of coming to his parents aide, he would do it without hesitation.
His sleep was restless and light, waking up at even the slightest noise from outside. The insomnia that he had thought he had outgrown was now coming back at full force, depriving his body of any rest.
Walking back into his apartment after so long had felt so foreign, he could barely see it as a home anymore without the lingering smell of Harry to warm up the atmosphere. His eyes were bloodshot and puffy from his altercation earlier, and he was deeply exhausted. His apartment was still in shambles from the raid, he cast a quick cleaning charm and made his way to his bedroom as it did its magic.
Harry nodded while pouting his lips, putting his forehead into Draco’s shoulder in defeat. Draco ran his fingers through his hair, feeling the soft curls in between his fingers.
“You alright mate?” Oliver questioned, Draco nodded slowly, making up an excuse as to how work was busting his ass, it wasn’t a complete lie, work had been getting a little more difficult lately, having him work later hours. But that wasn’t the origin of his issues, if anything, it helped distract him from them. Oliver didn’t seem to be fully convinced, but he knew better than to integrate Draco when he was in a bad mood.
“That looks like a face of regret if I’ve ever seen one.” Casper said, his demeanor waiting for a response. After being partners for years, Harry’s emotions have become transparent to Casper, oftentimes he knew what Harry was feeling before he even did.
He took a seat on the padded chair furthest from Harry, avoiding eye contact and fidgeting with the hem of his sweater to appear busy.
“Yeah sure, it may have started out like that, but Merlin, at one point you could sense the sexual tension!” Hermione argued, laughter starting up in between the two of them.
“Goodbye, Harry. It was good to see you again.” Draco simply stated, leaning down to Harry and placing a soft kiss on his cheek that spent a spark through his body.
What Draco felt he truly needed was a break, a vacation maybe, anything to allow him to just relax apart from everyone in his life, Noah specifically. He still didn’t know how he was going to act once they had to finally see each other again. He already had about 3 missed calls and a couple of texts from him asking to talk, all of which he had ignored. Draco didn’t understand what there was to talk about, they had never been exclusive - obviously - and Noah had every right to go and propose to his girlfriend.
Casper got up from his chair with a wink towards Harry, clearly amused. He was not nearly the wingman that he thought he was.
Sitting in his office chair at work, Draco was deep in contemplative thought, going over the interactions between him and Harry that stood out to him. Aaron knocked lightly on the door, a pointless act as it was already half open.
“I do not! I just have to be in the mood.” Aaron insisted. Draco nodded in agreement, not fully convinced.
“To say the least.” He snarked back. He didn’t mean it, in fact, he enjoyed the first few months of living with Harry immensely. It was only in the last few weeks that things have gotten hostile. Nevertheless, he wanted to hurt Harry’s feelings, prove to him that he didn’t need him.
Once he arrived at the store, the clerk was just opening up the till, which gave him plenty of time to wander around the store and meticulously pick out the necessary groceries while the place was still relatively empty. He was glad he had reminded himself to bring muggle money on the trip as he thought about the hungry glare that would have been imbuing off of Malfoy’s face.
The morning chill was getting under Harry’s clothes, biting at his skin and leaving him shivering. It was early evening, the sun was just setting over the townhouses in a small suburban area of England, Casper and Harry were forced to make themselves scarce in between the alleys, careful as to not have anyone see them. There was supposed to be a raid later on in the evening, ex death eaters gathering to gain revenge on another disloyal wizard, the problem was, they didn’t know how many would show up, they were hoping that they wouldn’t be outnumbered. They had arrived earlier in the day in order to evacuate the pureblood and his family, escorting them back to the ministry and returning to the town once again. The day had been long and draining on Harry’s body, his muscles carrying a dull ache that pointed attention to itself whenever he moved. Although he was used to working long hours, it was mainly from paperwork, rarely did they have to spend the whole day on the field.
“Unfortunately, it is in this exact state that I am able to be the most honest. I can’t be nearly as brave when I’m sober, not to be this honest anyway.” he tried to explain.
“Let’s go inside.” Harry said, receiving a dramatic groan from Draco at which Harry only laughed at.
“Well, I’m sure he feels out of place, and an unwanted visitor at that. Why don’t you try making more conversation, maybe make him feel more comfortable?” Of course Casper would suggest that. Harry didn’t want to make Draco feel more comfortable, he didn’t even want him there in the first place.
“Come on Marie, don’t pester him, surely he’d tell us if there was anyone” Noah complied as he gave Draco a wink. Butterflies rose in his stomach but he mentally shut them down. Noah was far from straight, Draco knew this from their drunken nights after the pub where one thing led to another and they ended up waking up the next morning with a pounding headache and a lot of regret. It wasn’t enough to end their friendship but placed them at an awkward in-between that they had chosen to not mention to Marie and Oliver. Not to mention Noah had a girlfriend, a long term one at that, which made Draco feel all the more guilty for whatever feelings he had been trying to suppress ever since they first hooked up.
“What about the rest of the Malfoy family? Lucius? Narcissa?” Harry and Casper watched, barely breathing.
So they stuck to surface level discussions, how Draco’s job was treating him, whether he was eating well, he doesn’t even think that she knew he was living with Harry in the first place.
How do you guys like reading the same situation but from both POV's? I'm also going to be done my semester in 2 weeks and after that my updates should be more frequent (2-3 times a week!)
“I thought it would be shite when I first got there if I’m being honest, but it was actually fun, dare I say” Draco replied, tripping over some of his words.
Draco changed into a pair of casual sleep clothes that were left for him on the bed, the clothes hung loosely around his body, as he was a little shorter than Aaron. He unraveled into the bed, sleep becoming him nearly as soon as he hit the pillow.
Aaron finished the dinner preparation and plated them both portions. They ate together, chatting about their families and how they got into alchemy. Aaron had apparently always been exceedingly gifted at it in school but his parents made him switch to “manlier” electives as he got to higher years. Stupid concept in Draco’s opinion but their parents weren’t known for making the soundest decisions. He offered to clean up after dinner in exchange for his hospitality, but Aaron insisted against it, saying it would make him feel uncomfortable.
Harry dove right into the function, saying hellos and hugging his old friends, leaving Draco to awkwardly stand behind him. His chest felt tight with anxiety as he continued to feel unwelcome, he cursed himself for even agreeing to come in the first place.
“Malfoy! Wait up!” He heard a voice call for him as he walked. He hesitantly stopped, unsure if he wanted to hear what Harry had to say.
Harry entered his office, slumping down into his chair with a groan, resulting in a questionable look from Casper.
He reflected on their conversation, unable to place Harry on a spectrum between friend or lover, for he was always somewhere in between. Draco was surprised by his own pull towards Harry, they had always been tied together by a string, their lives intertwined wherever they go. But it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough to have passion and love, for it was never stable and it was never sure.
Harry poured himself a mug of coffee, glancing into the fridge to find empty shelves. He had forgotten about their need for groceries entirely and the grumble of his stomach was quick to remind him. He figured he would walk over to the local grocer and grab some food for the week, eager to get their needed ingredients before the inevitable Christmas rush that would follow in the next few days. Setting down his now finished coffee mug that he practically chugged, he grabbed his jacket from the front door, making sure to write a quick note for Draco on the kitchen table.
“I don’t think pancakes are supposed to be burned Potter.” Draco teased, his mouth up turning into a smile. Harry turned around startled, pulling his wand out in defence. His shoulders relaxed as he realized who it was, his face falling back to one of indifference and his body turning back to the stove.
Harry simply nodded in agreement, not wanting to talk about the situation any longer. They needed to get started on the preparations for tomorrow.
“Took you long enough, always keeping me waiting, huh?” Draco replied, his tone cool and nonchalant.
“Cadmus! Don’t be a fool. Those Ministry pricks got to him before we did.” her voice was sharp, matching her appearance. It was deeper than Harry imagined, but still maintained an elegance to it. She had a disgusted look on her face, her eyes judging everything they fell upon.
“So, you never did tell us Draco, have you met anyone? It’s been three months since we’ve last got together like this, surely you must be on the lookout” said Marie. Easy for her to ask, she’s been with Oliver since her school days and had never really had to date.
“Yeah whatever. Don’t bother Harry, I’m sure he’s just looking for a shag and you happen to be the closest thing. Merlin knows that's his way of picking men anyway.” He stormed off down the street, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
Draco loved when Harry got slightly awkward, clear that he’s trying to choose his words wisely yet failing miserably.
They walked over to the hall where the couple was standing. Hermione brought Harry into a tight hug as Ron and Draco shook hands, both avoiding eye contact.
Casper and Harry entered the Ministry, eager to get to their first meeting of the day as it was with Marvin and a few other auror’s to discuss the instance with Draco, how long he was supposed to be staying with Harry would also be covered, he was hoping for no more than a week. They walked into the board room, it had cold dark grey walls and dark brown furniture. The worst part about working at the Ministry was how unwelcoming it all felt, as if they had been trying to crush any ounce of joy that dared walk into the place. The pair took a seat at the table, waiting while a few more bodies filled the room, and Marvin seated himself at the head of the table.
“Where the hell are you going?” The man exclaimed, Draco ignored him and continued walking. His eyes wandered quickly against all the seats of the bar looking for the familiar head of brown hair, and surely enough, there he was. The man he spent his entire adolescence hating.
“Tell me all about it.” Casper sighed, pulling up a chair and taking out a notepad, resembling a makeshift shrink's office.
Hermione and Ron had been dancing, he wasn’t really sure where Harry was either, and quite frankly he was disinterested in finding him after the things he said earlier, particularly when he was the one that was in the wrong.
He rested his glass on a table, his ability to focus fading as he tried to light the cigarette in his mouth, his point of view disoriented.
But what if it was all a one time occurrence? He would wake up and realize the dreaded mistakes of the night before and try and sneak away quietly, the two of them back to awkward silence and lack of eye contact.
“I’d rather not talk about it” He responded, he walked across the kitchen and reached into his cabinet, getting out a scotch glass. He pulled out a chair next to Draco and sat down, pouring himself a drink. Draco stiffened slightly, probably still not used to being in such close proximity to Harry.
“Do you want to fuck or not?” he exclaimed, the irritation thick in his voice. The man quickly rose and began following Draco to the outside of the pub.
The door was a simple mahogany wood, relatively unvarnished in comparison to the rest of the space. As Harry unlocked the door, Draco was greeted by a vast space, beautifully decorated with mid-century modern furniture, all green and wood tones. His jaw slightly fell agape as he walked further towards the kitchen. One of dark granite and dark wood cabinets, with glossed silver appliances. Draco loved decadent interior spaces but had never gotten around to properly putting together his. He placed his bags down by the island and took a seat on the couch, which were leather and were so perfectly plump they looked as if no one had ever sat on them.
Draco nodded, taking a gander around the room with his eyes to avoid having to maintain eye contact. He understood what Harry was saying - in theory. But it simply didn’t feel like it applied to him. Him and his family terrorized people for years, and despite his changed ways, he feels that nothing will ever make up for it.
There was something so intoxicating about the beginning of an infatuation with someone that was incomparable to anything Draco has ever felt; the way his body responds naturally to whatever Harry does, as if he had been subconsciously hungry for the tenderness of his lips on his skin his whole life.
Draco rolled over on the bed, eyes still shut yet burning. He felt incredibly drained from the day before, his emotional state had taken a toll on him and the copious amounts of drinking didn’t help either. He cringed as he thought about his behaviour from the night before, being all giddy and flirtatious with Harry was definitely out of line. He was glad that nothing happened, but still annoyed at the leftover sexual tension that he was feeling, a tent formed with his sheets, proving just how much he needed that hookup with Harry last night. He hadn’t gotten laid in a while - well, realistically it had only been a few weeks - but for Draco that felt like eons.
A silence fell in between them, Harry had overstepped an invisible line that was drawn before them, like he always did. He always took what he wanted, in spite of the consequences.
“Oh and Harry, I would appreciate it if you kept what you heard about Lucius a secret from Draco.” Marvin threw out halfheartedly. Harry stopped mid-way out the door.
Yet he still found himself wondering about the what ifs. Maybe Harry had changed, maybe it would be different this time, maybe everything would figure itself out and all they needed was each other. Though he knew none of these things were true, for they were destructive when together, their passion unbound.
“Hm?” Harry mumbled, his eyes focusing on the bell pepper that he was sloppily chopping on his cutting board.
Just like that the illusion was shattered and Draco was back in the kitchen of a man who didn’t love him.
The wedding was just a week away and Draco had been desperately clinging onto each day, hoping it wouldn’t pass on to the next. Having to go and be happy for Noah when he in reality quite resented him for having to face his emotions and on top of that, be rejected, was not something he was looking forward to. Although the last few months have been difficult, a flurry of strange men in his bed and too many times Aaron has had to come to his aid to get him out of his alcohol binging. Luckily, for the most part, that was a thing of the past. Apart from a few gruesome nights where he catches himself slipping back into those habits, he has been mostly healed from the incident. He knew it would still hurt being at the wedding and seeing him and Aurora live out their happy ever after - if it can even be called that considering all the things Noah is keeping from her - but they were friends first and good friends come to each other's weddings. So he had RSVP’d and was dreading the day.
As far as he knew, Harry wasn’t one for sharing intimate details about his feelings. Draco had been - ironically - the most open out of the two of them, drunkenly confessing about his life since the beginning of them living together. So to see this more vulnerable side of him, was something that Draco was dying to see again. He loved how open he was able to be, despite his obvious inebriation and lack of a filter at the time.
They counted to three before throwing the drink down their throats, the familiar burn leaving Draco nostalgic for his early twenties. It was almost all he ever drank when he first started partying.
He watched the door every time he heard the jingle of the bells above it, anxiously eyeing whoever walked in to see if it was him. Draco took a few deep breaths, closing his eyes and breathing in through his nose, and out through his mouth, stilling his heart beat.
The mix of emotions that Draco was feeling that morning were enough to have him confused at where the two of them stood. After Draco finished in the shower he walked out to Harry having breakfast in the kitchen, reading the Sunday paper like he hadn’t just been in him just 12 hours earlier. He simply offered him some eggs and went on with his business like usual.
Draco took the balloon from him with an intense look of concentration before bringing it to his lips and taking a deep breath. When he pulled the balloon away he blinked several times in quick succession, then ginned.
“I’m sorry too.” Harry pulled his hand back. “Our rivalry wasn’t exactly one-sided. I did and said some pretty awful things to you and your friends as well, and for that, I am very sorry.” Harry broke eye contact, taking a bite of his ice cream at long last.
Draco launched into the carefree tale with relish. It was refreshing being able to talk about something other than the war. Harry was the perfect audience, asking questions and making comments when appropriate. He became so involved, in fact, that he didn’t even seem to notice when the next song began to play. Draco changed their steps to match the new tempo without missing a beat. When Draco was through, Harry took over the role of storyteller and began detailing how he became close with both Fleur and Bill Weasley.
“Yeah, alright.” Draco gave in, his heart feeling like it was trying to twist itself into a pretzel at the prospect of facing Harry’s old dorm mates.
“It was fabulous! Theo and I got engaged.” She gushed, holding out her left hand to show off a rather ostentatious ring.
“Hands in the air, Thranduil. We have you surrounded.” Harry pulled off his cloak and stuffed it into his pocket, canceling his disillusionment charm on Zach before pointing his wand at Thranduil's heart.
“Potter, Harry?” a pretty witch in violent green robes called with uncertainty. She squinted at the paper as if her file must be a mistake.
“Then I don’t need to know right now.” Draco smiled, laying back on the blanket and looking at the ocean. “I love living here. I don’t think I will ever get tired of this view.”
“What?” She gasped in outrage. “They’re the heathens! They’re polluting this place with their debauchery!”
“This game will be over quickly.” Dean announced as he came over to grab his drink. “What are you two up to?”
Everyone would be so much happier if he weren’t around to complicate their lives. Always feeling like he was holding Ron and Hermione back. Like Fred and George were only with him out of pity.
"What, like be my actual boyfriend?" Draco had laughed. Theo wiped that sarcastic smile right off his face with his reply.
“Muggles come up with the strangest things.” Draco beamed as he watched the balloon bounce into the others.
“That the best part of my day would ever be spending time with a pretentious prick like you.” Harry tilted his head into Draco’s caress, his green eyes dancing in the moonlight.
He heard footsteps echoing in the hall and shoved the sketchbook under his pillow, pulling on a fresh set of plain black robes. By the time the knock came, he was ready. When he opened the door it revealed twin expressions of fear on his parent's faces.
Draco gave him a fond, exasperated glare before pulling out more bunched up tissue paper. He gasped softly when he found the sleek black box, pulling it out of the bag with a flourish.
“I-I-I need-” Draco was shaking with the power of the onslaught. “Merlin, please help me. M-m-make me feel anything but this.”
“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for.” Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, his thoughts racing.
Draco’s eyes flicked over to the Gryffindor table where Harry was flanked by The Weasel and Granger, deep in conversation. He looked worried and Draco wondered if he had seen the article yet. Harry’s green eyes suddenly met his and Draco panicked. He flicked him off before quickly turning to Theo, pretending to be in the middle of a conversation.
"Aunt Andi is fine, or Aunt Andromeda if you prefer." She beamed. "It is just so good to actually see you. I had already been disowned before you were born and I never thought I'd get the chance."
“I’m sorry.” He said helplessly. “I didn’t know what a little prick I was being, I was just spouting off what my parents had told me.”
He frowned when his quill made a line too thick, throwing the entire image off balance. This was the problem with drawing using a quill. There was no margin for error. He pulled back and looked at his handiwork. If he could darken the details on the other side….
“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!”
“Well, owls didn’t exactly make the list of the dead.” Hermione reached out to stroke the grey owl and it hooted at her happily.
Draco merely nodded in acknowledgment, gracing him with a twisted half-smile that made Theo’s poor heart stop in his chest for a full second. He trudged reluctantly out of the great hall in search of his most terrifying best friend.
Seamus joined in a little late, but soon the whole table was toasting together while Neville blushed furiously, muttering something about not wanting to be embarrassed. The odd camaraderie was almost instantly broken by Draco nearly spitting out his beer.
Draco brought them to a rustic breakfast-brunch-lunch cafe tucked away on the boardwalk. Harry had never seen so many breakfast options. He contemplated what to order as he sipped his coffee and was a bit startled to discover Draco was watching him.
“I asked how that raid went last week. Did you end up catching the muggle baiter you were after?” Seamus asked in an exasperated tone.
He always seemed to retreat when the subject strayed too close to the war. She understood his reluctance, but one day he would have to face those demons. Something told her he would have to face them soon and she would be there to help him when he did, but she could give him tonight. Tonight they celebrated their son and the wonderful man he had grown into despite everything that happened.
“It’s not our fault you scratched on your only turn.” Draco leaned over the table elegantly, cleaning the striped balls from the felt with sure movements. He didn’t miss a single shot and Dean glowered at him, but the dark glare was colored with a healthy amount of respect.
“So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?” He demanded. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”
“Then I’m happy for you.” Hopsin smiled warmly at him. “You were always pants at dueling anyway. I haven’t the foggiest how you managed to duel Voldemort twice and live to tell the tale.”
“While Potter may be an idiot, he isn’t stupid. He will have a plan. He wouldn’t just jump in the lake without a backup plan. Breathe, Draco.” Theo murmured in his ear, scooting impossibly closer.
Her white tea set with its black floral pattern made him think of the tea set Harry had given him and the symbolism it held. He was a Black. Perhaps it was time he started acting like it.
“You, Draco, Theo. You all insist on suffering in silence and not letting anyone help you. It’s infuriating.”
He was painfully reminded of Fred and George hugging him in a similar fashion when he was having one of his breakdowns and he couldn’t help the sob that escaped from his chest. Pansy and Hermione only held him tighter.
Some of the shelves held books on various topics. From ‘Quidditch Through the Ages’ to Advanced Potions texts, Draco had it all. Harry was amused to recognize a few works of muggle fiction hiding amongst the wizarding books. Other shelves held paints and paintbrushes, empty canvases, and the largest collection of pencils Harry had ever seen in his life. The remaining shelf space simply held knick-knacks and keepsakes. He was gratified to see the origami elephant he had jokingly given him during one of their study sessions had a place of honor next to a crystal figurine.
"Oh, Harry." Sirius gave him an understanding smile. "The concept of 'good and evil' is not a broad enough spectrum for morality. The world is a complex place filled with complex people. No one is completely 'good' just as no one is completely 'evil.' Everyone has the capacity to do good or bad deeds, or even morally grey ones. Sometimes you’re going to have to be the villain in someone else's story, just don’t forget to be the hero in yours.” Sirius was pacing, the background of the mirror was constantly shifting.
“No, you’re bloody well not!” She snipped, slamming the water down on Draco’s bedside table. “I knew breaking out that third bottle was a bad idea.” Pansy huffed, grabbing Draco by the collar and dragging him to the showers.
Draco looked back at Harry expectantly. His wide eyes were captivating pools of liquid moonlight and Harry found it impossible to disappoint him.
"At the beginning of the night, you wanted nothing to do with me. Yet you danced with me anyway and I just… why?" Harry felt heat flood to his ears. He had never been eloquent, but now he felt downright stupid.
This chapter hurt me to write. A word of advice: BRING A BOX OF TISSUES! If you've stuck with me this long, thank you so much! Your loyalty means the world to me! As always a huge shoutout to my darling beta AlexClio and my lovely omen SandZhark! This fic would not be nearly as good without their continuous input.  Happy reading!
“Well, if that’s the case, you’re forgiven.” Harry reached out and grabbed Draco’s arm, pulling him down the last few feet to the cafe they were supposed to meet at.
Now that he was unencumbered he climbed up behind Harry easily, wrapping his arms around his waist. He selfishly took a moment to relish in the sanctioned closeness, resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
Memories of last night slowly began to surface and Harry threw his arm across his eyes dramatically as he remembered some of the less spectacular parts of the club. The overwhelming jealousy when he came back from the bathroom to see Draco being grabbed by a stranger was a new sensation. He had never experienced anything like it before. It wasn’t that he thought Draco would ever be disloyal, but just seeing someone else putting the moves on his boyfriend awakened a beast inside of him. The venom in Draco’s voice when he told the redhead he wasn't interested, however, made the green dragon of jealousy in Harry’s chest purr in contentment.
"This was fun. You should come to Gryffindor night more often, Draco." Ron slapped Draco’s shoulder, causing him to stumble slightly.
“Come on, I’ve got lunch all planned.” Harry released his jaw and grabbed his hand instead, pulling him out the door and down his front path.
“Good, because that isn’t why we’re going in there.” She retorted before grabbing his hand, dragging him through the villa, up the stairs, and into her bathroom with Hermione trailing behind.
Harry didn’t know which way was up. All he felt was pain. If Remus hadn’t been trying to hold him back only moments previously Harry would have collapsed onto the floor.
“A verdict has been reached, the Malfoys are cleared of all charges. I will write up the paperwork and get it pushed through before the end of the day.” She said in a crisp tone. “Now, if you don’t mind, Mr. Potter, I would like for us to get back to the matter we had been discussing before you exploded into the room.”
“The logic here is pretty simple. You’re not the one who attacked me, therefore it wasn’t your fault. Lighten up, Malfoy, or I’m going to have to make you sit with your parents.” Bill poked at him.
“I, erm, am actually not seeing anyone at the moment.” Harry did his best to not look at Draco and miserably failed. His expression was stony as he glared into the distance.
“Thank you, Kreacher. That’s all I needed to know. You can...er, go visit Regulus’s room?” He shot Harry a worried glance, but he nodded in affirmation.
“I’ve got you.” He whispered. “Let it all out.” Draco was mildly surprised when Harry obeyed, letting loose a loud sob as he buried his face in Draco’s chest.
“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” suggested Dumbledore. “What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too. And after all, you don’t really need help. . . . I have no wand at the moment. . . . I cannot defend myself.”
Without further ado he hopped on and took off, spiraling upwards as fast as he dared. A feeling of weightlessness consumed him and he let loose his first genuine laugh in what seemed like ages. It felt good to be airborne again, just what he needed after the claustrophobia of the tunnel. When Vince and Greg caught up to him he grinned over at them.
“I’m sorry Harry’s being an idiot.” Pansy said without preamble, joining him in the wings while they waited for their scene.
He hadn’t heard anything about how she was doing this whole time and he felt slightly guilty that he hadn’t thought to ask.
The song seemed to last five lifetimes as he watched the other dancers having fun. He and Parvati nearly ran into Malfoy as he dipped Parkinson in the middle of the floor. Parvati was not pleased and took over leading. Harry had no complaints. It was much easier to follow her movements than to try to count them out on his own. At long last, the final notes faded. Harry dropped Parvati’s hand and rushed off the dancefloor, looking for Ron and Padama.
“You didn’t go out a lot with the twins, did you?” Draco slipped his hand inside Harry’s as they moved up another few feet in the queue.
It happened so suddenly she almost passed out from the shock. The carefully controlled calm was disintegrating. It felt like someone had poured acid directly onto her brain and it took all of her willpower to stay silent as the damned bubble that kept her a slave to the Dark Lord’s will burst. All of the pain and anger and fear she had been denied to feel came rushing back to her now and she couldn’t stop the gasp that escaped her lips.
There were dark smudges on his under eyes where the eyeliner had been rubbed around and odd little streaks stretching to his left temple. He looked like an adorable, sleepy little panda. Harry made the mistake of telling him so and got called a trash panda for his trouble.
He blinked and stared at his coffee table in groggy confusion. The box and tea tray from last night were gone. In their place was a coffee carafe, teapot, and two mugs with a piece of parchment placed between them. He frantically cast his mind back, trying to remember if he had locked his door last night. Not that burglars would make him coffee after robbing him, but it was worrying all the same. A vague memory of locking up before stargazing with Harry surfaced and he breathed a sigh of relief. It must have been his mother or Pansy. They were the only two people with spare keys.
“I wouldn’t count on it, father.” Draco’s voice sounded weak, even to his own ears, and he cleared his throat.
Harry took care of the bill before anyone else could blink, taking his leave shortly after. The rest of them apparated together to a handsome villa in the countryside. He shot Pansy a quizzical look. It wasn’t really her style, but she just smiled and nodded for him to go inside.
“How did you manage to put this all together?” Draco immediately set to work unwrapping the dishes of snacks.
Madam Maxime rushed to greet her champion, wrapping a large blanket around her shoulders. Snippets of rapid-fire French floated back to where Draco and his friends were sitting and he strained to catch the conversation.
"Merlin, Malfoy- don't stop." Harry whimpered, threading his fingers through his perfect blond hair. "Fuck, you're amazing."
With a lazy flick of his wand, George set the music playing. Tears of happiness pricked at his eyes as the opening strains of Once by Pearl Jam filled the room.
“I knew the threat to their hair care products would work. Daphne is so vain I’m surprised her head can fit in this tiny room without suffocating the rest of us. Tracy is almost as bad.” She rambled, curling up on her bed and looking anywhere but at Hermione.
Everything exploded after that. Blaise was swearing up a storm while Luna decried her outrage at their shameful behavior. Harry’s Aunt and Uncle were up in arms, making wild gestures and Harry was yelling for everyone to calm down. Vernon was slewing an endless stream of derogatory slurs with spittle flying off his mustache, Petunia was screaming about disrespect and ungratefulness, and Draco was flabbergasted by the visceral bigotry. When Vernon said something especially heinous to Harry Draco surged forward only to be pulled back by a vice-like grip on his wrist.
Harry let out a soft moan of appreciation, tilting his head to deepen the kiss. Draco kept it chaste and sweet, pulling back after only a few tender moments. Harry stayed frozen with his eyes closed and Draco pressed their foreheads together, rubbing noses in a quick Eskimo kiss before withdrawing completely.
It wasn’t long before Draco returned victorious, buying everyone a Bramble cocktail in celebration. Dean was a graceful loser, toasting to Draco’s win with genuine happiness before vowing to crush him in the next game. Everyone groaned at that proclamation and refused to hear any more on the subject. Despite Dean’s best efforts to goad Draco, they didn’t end up playing another round. Dean went into full pout mode when he didn’t get his way, which Harry thought was hilarious. Seamus hopped off his chair, swaying unsteadily for a moment before pushing himself up on his tiptoes to give Dean a consoling kiss. Dean seized the opportunity to steal Seamus’s seat, pulling the indignant Irishman into his lap despite his cries of protest. When Harry looked over at Draco with a wicked grin Draco glared at him.
"Tell us about Lucius Malfoy. How did he save your life?" the same witch squinted her eyes at the Malfoys.
Snape set music playing with a lazy flick of his wand and Draco sighed, holding his hand out to Pansy as he stood. She took it and gave him an encouraging wink. He led her to the floor and let instinct take over. He moved flawlessly, leading her around the common room in elegant spins and twirls. For the big finish, he dipped her in a sweeping motion and smiled at her elated expression. Pansy had always liked being his dance partner when her family visited the manor. He was slightly shocked when most of the house broke into applause and he flushed in equal amounts of embarrassment and pleasure.
That’s how the Dark Lord had survived the rebounding killing curse all those years ago. He had committed the greatest atrocity known to wizardkind. He had made a horcrux. The Weasel’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he immediately became nauseated. He said another horcrux down. As in the Dark Lord had multiple. The thought of it was enough to make him gag. Greg and Vince shot him worrying looks but he shook his head. There was a massive explosion nearby and a high pitch scream cut through the sounds of battle.
“Healer Grey noted that you were working through childhood trauma during your last session. I’ve read your file and feel I can keep up if you wish to continue with that, or we can talk about something different. Which option would you prefer?” He studiously turned the pages and Harry had the strangest urge to yank it out of his hands.
Before anyone could answer the fireplace flared bright green and spit out a blushing Hermione and an apprehensive looking Pansy.
“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade to keep an eye on things. I didn’t see you get off the train with your friends so I started to worry.” She kept her gaze straight ahead as they started down the carriage-carved path. “When the last carriage left for Hogwarts and I still hadn’t seen you I hopped on board and started combing each compartment. I figured you must be hiding under your cloak or something so I tried summoning it.”
“You aren’t sick of me yet?” Draco teased, but Harry caught the small flash of insecurity that crossed his face.
“I like the idea, but the execution is all wrong.” Pansy rolled her eyes, tucking her dark brown hair behind her ear. “A big banner would never work. The teachers would just take it down.”
“I know he doesn’t like electronics, which is too bad because this would be perfect. You should have seen the work we put in to make his house electricity-free.” She was rambling and Harry guiltily tried to catch up.
This mark meant he could never be with Harry. No long shots or small possibilities. He was a Death Eater now. Harry could never love a Death Eater. He had heard the most trusted talking as the Dark Lord was carving and burning the dark mark into his flesh with magic. Apparently, the last person to scream while receiving the mark was someone named Regulus. Apparently, he disappeared without a trace. Not even the Dark Lord seemed to know what had happened to him. Draco didn’t take that as a good omen. He tried harder to hide his pain after that.
“There would have been records!” Draco grabbed another book off the large pile next to him and started frantically flipping through it.
“Hermione and I will throw a dinner party. Oh! Or we can invite him to your housewarming party! It wouldn’t be too hard to get him to come.” She felt the familiar fire of mischief ignite inside of her.
Kingsley poured three drops of the flavorless potion on his tongue, giving Harry a wane smile. Harry returned it then took his seat at the witness stand while they waited for the potion to take effect. The entire room was still staring at him and he was just beginning to feel jittery. He wished they would stop. A few moments later, everything that had been worrying him or making him uncomfortable ceased to matter. It wasn’t quite like being under the imperious curse, there wasn’t any of that blissful calm feeling. It was more like his entire perspective shifted so that all of the eyes on him no longer mattered. The only thing that mattered was the truth. It was paramount that the truth be told.
“We decided you guys couldn’t handle us if we joined forces, you can relax.” Harry shot George a quick wink.
“Ugh, no. I just escaped. Let’s start with you, how was your day?” She snorted into her cup before the blissful flavors of caramel and mocha coated her tongue.
“Don’t let me keep you.” His mother reached out to give his arm an affectionate squeeze before standing up. “Go spend time with your boyfriend, I have errands to run.”
It was refreshing, only having his art projects to worry about. He supposed he should feel worried about the trial, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. The Wizengamot would most likely rule them all guilty regardless of any evidence brought forth. He hadn’t heard of a single release thus far. He didn’t deserve to be released.
"Well thank Merlin for Pansy and horrible dancing then." Harry reached up and cradled his face in his palm.
“Nothing with tequila this time, yeah?” Neville gave Dean a meaningful look as he turned towards the bar.
“Here, I grabbed a few options. I like the shorts but I’m starting to rethink the shirt. Try the graphic tank top under the teal shirt first.” She ordered.
They finished their ice creams and chatted about light-hearted, trivial things until it was time for them both to get back to work. Harry walked Draco to Arimere’s Art since it was just down the block and hesitated outside the door.
“I was actually about to head out.” Harry said dully. Not like it mattered. It never did to these people.
The others made noises of agreement before dropping their whiskey and Irish cream shots into the dark stout and slamming it all in one go. Five empty glasses hit the table in rapid succession and Harry could feel the rush of the alcohol flooding through his veins.
“About what you feel you didn’t even do.” Draco shrugged. “Or we can talk about something equally unpleasant, like my time as a Death Eater or shopping with Hermione.”
“Fresh blood! Wonderful, let me have a look.” Ari grabbed the painting, tapping it with his wand to unshrink it. His eyes grew wide when it reached its full size. “Oh, Pansy.”
Draco froze, his back going stiff. He deliberated on turning around to confront him but the sounds of the rest of the cast were growing louder and he really didn't want an audience when he got officially dumped so he kept walking. He grabbed his duffle off the bench by the practice rooms and stormed out of the building. He was barely even aware of walking to the Vantage. He did notice, however, when the engine roared to life. Where exactly was he planning on going?
“You are.” Draco realized he had been gazing at Harry for an uncomfortable amount of time. He distracted himself by polishing off the last of his tartiflette before his staring could become embarrassing. “So this cinema is like the theater, but in a picture?”
“I don’t know.” His voice was shaking and he kicked himself for appearing weak in front of the others. “I can’t tell.”
The Globe was everything Draco had dreamed it to be and more. They had caught a late afternoon rendition of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and Draco was over the moon. He had been to Wizarding theater before, but muggle theater was in a league of its own. They were so creative and managed to do so much with the limited resources they had. It was absolutely fantastic. After the play was over and everyone had cleared out Harry helped him sneak onstage and Draco reveled in the exhilaration of standing on such a hallowed piece of history. They decided to not press their luck and left before they could be chased out by a security guard for the second time that day. When they stepped back out onto the bustling London streets he turned expectantly towards Harry, lacing their fingers together as they walked.

Harry only paused to consider his terms for a brief moment. It wasn’t too much to ask, he didn’t think. Besides, who was he to turn down free food?
“Of course it isn’t, sweetheart.” His mother smirked and for some reason, he felt his face grow hot.
“The way their eyes light up when they get excited or the look on their face when they’re happy. The way they move or the way they say your name. Actual aspects of their personality, like the way they treat their friends or their inferiors. The way they hold themselves or the way they think. They should make you happy and make you want to keep striving to be better.”
Screaming from below reached them and Draco stiffened, casting a quick glance behind him. The sounds of an all-out battle was echoing up the stairs. How many would die tonight?
What seemed like an entire lifetime later the main character flew off into the sky and the scene faded to black. As music started playing and words began to roll across the screen the lights of the theater came back on and the entire theater seemed to break into conversation.
He had exchanged a few more words with Ron while she was pondering the implications of his rapid mood shifts. He was already halfway up the stairs to the boy’s dormitory before she even registered that he had moved.
“He will be happy to hear that. You should invite him over for tea to thank him." Hermione's tone was much too innocent.
If you have any adorable Drarry moments you want to see included in this fic or in the outtakes, leave them in the comments section and I will try to work them in!
The group of people around them that had seen what happened burst into polite applause, causing Harry to look over. He made eye contact with Draco’s father and gave him a curt nod before turning back to the Dark Lord.
“I can’t just ask the hero of the entire sodding wizarding world out for a friendly chat!” He grit his teeth.
“The coffee. I took Pansy’s advice and tried something new. I don’t like it.” Harry wrinkled his nose at the strange nutty flavor that was lingering on his tongue.
“Harry, please. The sooner you cooperate, the sooner we can be done. Why do you insist on drawing this out?” Malfoy sat back in his chair, resting his elbows on the armrests in a perfect picture of tranquility, and for some reason that irked him to no end.
Apparently, the big finale to their perfect day was some muggle invention called the cinema. Draco knew he wasn’t exactly an expert on all things Muggle, but he hadn’t ever heard of movies before.
Pansy plays both sides of the fence, Hermione drags Harry shopping, Harry picks out a thoughtful gift, Draco finds that Ginny Weasley is actually sort of funny, and Harry and Draco bond at a beach party.
“He thought he was. Dumbledore and I had just returned from hunting down one of Voldemort’s horcruxes. He ordered me to put on my invisibility cloak and then petrified me so I couldn’t move. Draco didn’t know I was there.”
At long last Madam Pomfrey declared him patched up enough to go. He jumped off his cot and rushed out of the tent before she could call him back again. As soon as he left the tent he almost ran straight into two people. Harry froze when he caught sight of Ron, bracing for whatever scathing remark he might have.
“Oi, he saved you from Azkaban. The least you can do is buy him a coffee.” She slapped his wrist playfully.
Fast food turned out to be a cold restaurant made up entirely of tile and plastic seating. There was a room towards the back that opened up into something Harry called a play place for muggle children. The entire building smelled strangely delicious and Draco decided he could forgive the garish red and yellow color scheme. He stayed close to Harry, glancing around curiously at the plastic display box with strange little toys inside and a monstrous machine set into the far wall.
She could pump information out of a wall if she set her mind to it. Theo smacked himself in the forehead and groaned.
The man's reply was lost in the sound of an explosion but Draco didn’t care. Of course Harry would never consider using hostages. Wasn’t it just classic Harry to defend Slytherins- the children of the same Death Eaters that were ready to kill him on sight. It was asinine. It was idiotic. It was completely and utterly Harry, and Draco loved it. He jumped When Harry started shouting. He sounded much closer than he had been just a moment ago and Draco’s anxiety kicked back into overdrive.
“You will burn in hell! You’ll all be condemned for promoting their filth!” She screamed as her partner led her away.
“I’m glad you could make it. Go! Enjoy yourself! Hermione helped me clear the upstairs so we could put a dance floor in and I know a couple of people have drifted out by the pool. There will be a ball dropping in the front yard at midnight, so don’t miss it!” She touched his arm affectionately and gave Hermione one more hug before returning to her previous conversation.
“I should probably go. I’m sorry.” Harry grabbed the first shirt off the floor he found and put it on, fastening the buttons at an impressive rate.
“Stop! STOP!” Draco shouted, rounding on Snape. “You can’t force someone to hurt their soulmate! They feel everything their soulmate feels over their bond. It’s worse than barbaric. What the bloody hell is wrong with you?”
Harry turned around at a loss for words. When Draco’s pale eyes, glowing in the moonlight, locked onto his own he said the first thing that came to his mind.
“I see. Those poor dears.” His mother tutted. “Hurry up and read the last two books, I absolutely must know how the story ends.”

“He would be a fool not to fall madly in love with you, sweetheart.” His mother shot him a conspiratorial wink. “Tell me about him! What is he like?”
Harry almost laughed until an echo of Fred saying something just similar enough before he died made Harry’s tart turn tasteless in his mouth.
She was suddenly very alert and watching Draco’s every expression. He sighed and shook his head. Seeing Harry in his Quidditch gear? Is that what he had come to? Was tight leather really going to be the highlight of his year? He looked around his abnormally messy bedroom. The mess was the result of being cooped up here all summer. It was the only place he could be free of the Dark Lord. Yes, it is exactly what it had come to.
While Draco was busy feeling sentimental Harry had polished off his chips and was preparing to leave, completely oblivious to how his words had affected him. Draco couldn’t control the delighted laugh that escaped before he leaned over the small table and kissed him. Harry made a surprised sound but returned the kiss, placing a hand on Draco’s cheek to prolong the moment.
“You have the right to remain silent,” Harry repeated, grabbing the ropes and jerking the perp to his feet. “I suggest you exercise it.”
She gave him an understanding smile before shooing him away. His father’s study wasn’t terribly far from the library and he reached it in record time. He didn’t remember to knock until it was almost too late.
“I returned to the drawing-room where my Aunt was carving… the foul word for muggleborn… into Granger’s arm. I cast pain relief spells as surreptitiously as I could, but it wasn’t enough. Granger was still screaming and there was nothing I could-” he stopped mid-sentence, choking on the raw emotion that had risen in his throat.
When he entered the living room he found Harry looking at his old sketchbooks, turning the pages almost reverently. A warm feeling settled in the middle of his chest at the look of wonder on Harry’s face.
“Yeah.” Fred nodded, then cast a quick Tempus charm. “You tell ickle Ronniekins when you were going to be back?”
Any time he sat down and tried to coax a picture from his brand new sketch pad, courtesy of Hermione, nothing would come. There was no desire to even draw his favorite subject. Memories that he had tried to bury would always float to the surface. The war haunted him like a relentless phantom. He glared around the room, hoping to find inspiration.
They descended the stairs and walked through the foyer together, chatting and laughing. When they reached the outside Draco almost stopped dead in his tracks. Pansy had positively transformed the patch of beach that he more or less owned. She had set up poles made out of driftwood and strung up netting and fairy lights between them to make a sort of canopy that protected the muggle style boombox, drinks, and snacks from the sun. A table was set up with disposable cups and plates and large bowls filled with enough snack food to feed an army. The boombox got its own table with a large selection of compact records next to it. Hermione had called them CDs. Beyond the canopy was a roaring fire with massive pieces of driftwood circling around it to serve as benches. What shocked him the most, however, was Harry chatting animatedly with his father while the Weasel and Weaselette were going through the CDs together.
That pulled him up short. The truth was he wouldn’t. For whatever reason cleaning Ron’s face for him would be weird, but cleaning Draco’s wasn’t. He couldn’t say exactly what made it different, it just was.
“You can’t just...hold on, you might be onto something. Stay right here.” Hermione frowned thoughtfully before disappearing.
“Apology accepted.” Draco smiled and Harry was somewhat miffed at having missed the opportunity to see such a wide smile on Draco’s real features.
Draco slowly released his grip on the plexiglass, flailing slightly when one of his feet tried to slip out from underneath him. He caught his balance and turned to beam at Harry.
Draco looked hot. There was no other word for it. His heart was hammering at the mere sight of him. Draco had traded his ghastly green healer robes for a rich maroon shirt that he had tucked into rather tight looking black pants that put his hips and perfect arse on display. The red looked good on him, complimenting his pale skin and giving him some color. Harry gathered his resolve, gulped down the last of his drink, and stood up.
“Ah, I see.” Draco smiled, then gave his mother an accusatory glower. “Wait, are you telling me you and father knew Harry liked me too?”
“No! I just-” He sighed in frustration. “He said he didn’t have many friends and he’s been locked away and cut off from everything for a year, and I…. I just know what it feels like.”
“Freshen yourselves up.” The Dark Lord hissed gleefully. “I think it is finally time for this silly little game to come to an end. Potter dies tonight and I want you all to look your best.”
If you've stuck with me this far, thank you! Your reward is coming!!!! If you're just joining, welcome! I hope you're enjoying my fic! If you like what you're reading, leave kudos and a comment. If not, leave a comment on how I can do better. As always; Happy Reading!
“I had a feeling you’d go for the Mojito.” Harry looked much too self-satisfied, but Draco didn’t mind.
"My apologies, I was caught up with a problem customer." Draco intoned as he took the proffered gift. "This is beautiful. Did you make this one yourself?"
"You bet your arse I was. I even ran away to your dad's." He laughed. It was like a switch flipped in his brain and his face progressed from happy to horrified in .2 seconds. "Harry- Lily's sister and them… they're not...are they... abusing you?"
“Perhaps your younger students were not old enough to hear about your role in the war or understand how much you had to go through to make the world they live in today even possible. To them, it may seem like you’re just forcing them to listen to tales of your glory days. I can think of a particular professor who did the same thing when I was in school and I thought he was an absolute wanker. Have you tried omitting anything personal from the curriculum now that you’re getting students who were too young to take part in the war?” Malfoy was twirling his quill thoughtfully.
"Your godson is coming here?" Draco queried from behind his own steaming mug full of rich-smelling coffee.
“I…” Harry’s face turned contemplative as he considered Draco’s question. “I don’t know, actually. My first instinct is to say no, but if you had asked me out after the Yule Ball I might have said yes. Well, I would have told you to sod off first, but I probably would have changed my answer later.”
Draco wasn't sure what his dominant foot was, but he pushed off towards Harry and was pleased that he was able to make it to him without incident.
It was Ron and Hermione and himself sitting side by side at the Gryffindor table in the great hall. Hermione’s nose was scrunched up in amusement and Ron’s mouth was wide open, obviously in mid-laugh. Harry could almost hear the bark-like guffaw through the picture. Then there he was, lips curved in a smirk as he tried not to laugh. He remembered this day. It was one of the last carefree days they had had before the war started in earnest.
“You aren’t your father, Draco,” she said softly, rubbing soothing circles on his back. “you are not doomed to repeat his mistakes.”
They watched Teddy toddle around pretending to be a Polar Bear for a little while longer, but soon enough it was time to go home. Teddy was reluctant at first, but Draco handled it like a pro. He got down on one knee so he was at Teddy’s level and fixed him with a serious expression.
Suddenly something he said clicked into place and he couldn’t stop the snort of laughter that escaped his lips.
“Don’t give me too much credit, you’ve put a lot of work into it too.” An achingly familiar voice sounded behind him and Draco dropped his menu.
Their first date! 😍😍😍 Fair warning: there is cute fluff overload in this chapter. Not sorry at all, the boys deserve it after 24 chapters of angst. Now that I have reached such a good pausing point,  however, I *do* need to give my other fic some love. It's what would have happened if Regulus didn't die in the cave and ended up destroying all of the Horcruxes before Harry was even born. Pairings are Jagulus (Regulus Black/James Potter); WolfStar; Jily; and EVENTUALLY Drarry. It's called Power to Save the World if you're interested and you can find it on my profile. Keep in mind this doesn't mean I'm abandoning Home or going on hiatus with Home, updates will just be happening a tad slower because I'm going to be working on Power as well now.
Draco understood now why Harry had said this experience was hard to explain. Harry continued to feed him candy until Draco had tried everything he had bought; Good and Plenty that somehow reminded him of licorice wands, Goobers which were like chocolate-covered peanuts, Maltesers that tasted like chocolate covered air, and Everlasting Gobstoppers which were little round hard candies that changed color when you sucked on them. It was impressive for muggle manufacturing. It had been a bit overwhelming at first, but by the time their feature film began to play he had grown somewhat acclimated to the oddity of watching people move across what Harry called a screen.
“You going to be alright?” Theo’s tone was softer and Draco wasn’t sure which was worse; his friend and teammates anger or his pity.
Draco eyed the tall glass with a sprig of mint poking out of it and the shorter glass with a mound of ice that looked like a volcano uncertainly. Neither of them looked particularly appealing.
His world stopped spinning and his vision pinned. The only thing he could see was Harry’s wasted face. He heard the Dark Lord call for silence as if he were at the far end of a very long tunnel. Hagrid jerked, moving Harry’s body, shakily placing him at the Dark Lord’s feet. The Weasel was shouting something, and it seemed to rally the crowd but Draco still could not pry his eyes away from Harry. They were all silenced again and the Dark Lord droned on, but Draco didn’t hear a word. The spell was easily broken once more and there was a flash of commotion to Draco’s left yet he still could not look away.
“Breakfast will be ready in the kitchen when you is ready for it!” The elf replied before disapparating with a loud crack.
An uncomfortable pressure was building into a dull pain in his balls and he rolled onto his back with a sigh. He slipped his fingers beneath the waistband of his pants and pulled them down just far enough to free his aching prick. He closed his eyes as he gripped himself at the base and slowly worked his way up to the tip. Thoughts of Harry consumed him as he increased his rhythm.
“Here, take my wand and get out. You have to get out of here. The Dark Lord is coming, do you understand?” Draco pressed his wand into Harry’s hand.
Blaise opened his mouth to say something, but Draco didn’t catch it. The front door had opened to reveal a sullen-looking Harry walking beside a much too chipper Luna. Harry’s eyes found his almost immediately before they flicked away and Draco stiffened. He gave up on getting any more stretching done and abandoned his friends without a word, wandering aimlessly backstage. He still had twenty minutes until rehearsal officially started, but he couldn’t stand to face him yet.
“I love you too.” He paused, making sure the words were true before he voiced them. “I forgive you, you know. For everything. I don’t hold any of it against you.”
Harry sat dazedly in the medical tent as Madam Pomfrey tended to his wound. The Horntail’s spikes were venomous and apparently, Harry was allergic. He winced slightly when she started dabbing at the gash.
If he were being completely honest with himself, the entire past twenty-four hours were unbelievably idyllic. Strolling down the boardwalk hand-in-hand, having a picnic by the sea- it was like something lifted straight out of a fairytale. He still wasn’t entirely convinced this wasn’t some weird, strangely realistic dream.
“It’s just eyeliner, you big baby.” She tutted, grabbing his chin with one hand and forcing him to tilt his face up. “It will draw attention away from the redness in your eyes.”
“Get that friend of yours in here to see me and we will call it even.” His lips curled into a mischievous grin.
“Everything is fine.” Bill said lightly, putting on what Draco supposed was his relaxed version of the pureblood mask.
"It's okay," Harry cut Ron off before he could get the words out. He knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it. "Forget it."
“Mr. Shacklebolt.” She inclined her head respectfully while still maintaining eye contact as she approached the high table for her dose of veritaserum.
“Come here, oh mint to my lime.” Harry smirked, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him closer. “Kiss for good luck?”
“No one can help me.” He said forlornly, drawing in ragged breaths as he fought off a debilitating panic attack. “I can’t do it...I can’t. It isn’t going to work! If I don’t succeed soon he’s going to kill them! Merlin, I….”
Harry tugged at his shirt nervously, frowning at his reflection. He wasn’t entirely sure why he suddenly cared about what he wore. Maybe shopping with Hermione the other day had shamed some semblance of fashion sense into him. Well, if a clean Radiohead t-shirt and his nicest pair of jeans counted as fashion sense.
“Well, I learned from the best.” Draco rushed forward to give his mother a hug. She welcomed him with open arms, planting a quick kiss on his cheek. “It’s good to see you, mother.”
Draco looked pointedly at his bare chest. There was no telltale chain leading beneath his tan tank top. Now that he was allowed to have more than a cursory glance he saw it had a Kraken dragging a ship down to Davy Jones's locker printed on it. How appropriate for a beach party.
“I did.” Harry felt a mischievous grin spreading across his lips as he offered Draco his arm. "Shall we?"
Lucius made a strangled cry and she made eye contact with him. Blue held silver until he seemed to understand what she was trying to communicate. It wasn’t his fault. She did not hold him responsible for the atrocities she suffered in his stead.
“What in particular was I right about this time?” Draco picked up his tea and carried it over to the lounge area to join him.
“I can pay for it now.” Harry reached for his wallet. “Could I possibly buy birthday candles off you, too?”
Malfoy opened his mouth to retort angrily, but then seemed to deflate in front of him. He rubbed his face with both hands and when he emerged he was suddenly calm and composed again.
When the song was over Draco didn’t even bother to check the scores, he just handed Harry all of his tickets.
“You’re sorry?” Theo cried incredulously. “You don’t get to be sorry, Draco! You get to make a choice.”
“Close your eyes.” Draco demanded. Harry obeyed instantly. “Now drown everything else out, just listen to the music. Let everything else fade away.”
Granger glanced over at their table, shooting them a sarcastic smile and a little wave as if she didn’t have a care in the world. Draco was appalled by the overwhelming sense of relief that flooded through him. He gave Snape a small smile as he approached their tables. His godfather responded with a curt nod before rounding on the Gryffindors who were stupidly still talking.
Pansy knew she shouldn’t still be here, eavesdropping on what was clearly a private conversation, but she couldn’t help herself. Not only was the information totally juicy, but now she was genuinely curious.
“Ow. You made the room spin.” He griped, managing to pull himself halfway up before collapsing back onto the shower floor.
“Stay back!” Thranduil was backing away from them, pointing his wand first at Zach and then Harry. “You can’t prove anything!”
He slid it through to his mother’s cell and then disappeared, Draco could only assume, to deliver one to his father. That was unusual. He didn’t normally buy them each a paper. Draco unfurled the pages and gasped at the headline.
"Likewise." Andromeda accepted the milk and sugar when he handed them to her, mirroring his movements before setting them back on the tray. "Now, if memory serves, you were on the Slytherin Quidditch team. What was that like?"
“I am.” Draco reached out to caress his cheek, reveling in the novelty of being able to do so. “I do have plans in the evening though that I can’t get out of.”
Greg and Vince both blinked at him in confusion. It wasn’t much, but it was all Harry needed. He shot off the disarming spell and Greg’s wand went flying into a pile of junk. He lept after it, diving foolishly into the wall of forgotten relics. Draco dodged a stunner from Granger and the Weasel fired off a body bind curse at Vince. It was pandemonium. Draco considered stunning his friends just to make all of the shouting stop. He couldn’t believe Vince had tried to kill Granger. What happened to them while he had been stuck at the manor?
The pie was delicious. They both ate two slices before Draco wrapped the rest and put it away. When they were both settled with mugs of hot coffee Harry pushed the gift bag towards him.
Harry bulked at the thought of putting more people in danger. As usual, Fred and George seemed to read his mind.
When he turned around he found his father standing there with a guarded expression and his mother hovering directly behind him. Lucius Malfoy cut an intimidating figure against the post-show chaos. He was wearing an impeccable black suit and tie with his white-blond hair cascading over his shoulders. He didn’t look angry, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t. Draco’s gaze flicked over to his mother who gave him an encouraging smile.
“Really?” He arched an eyebrow at her. “You’re having me on, it’s just a bunch of vague shapes and paint splatters. A house elf could have painted this.”
Pansy smoothed her skirt as she walked into the brightly lit pub and glanced around. There was no telling where he might be. She went straight to the bar and was about to order a drink when an amused voice on her left demanded her attention.
“It must have been an interesting relationship. How did that happen?” Draco climbed up onto one of the stools with as much poise as he could manage.
Harry gaped. "Would you do that? That'd be great." He beamed. "He would have a field-day, meeting someone from the old family again." He looked at Malfoy in surprise. This man had turned out quite different from what he'd expected.
"You know, I've never given it a thought until now, but yes, it seems very likely that he killed them."
"What do you think, the blue or the yellow?" Potter threw the colour samples on the table. "I've chosen this wallpaper for Lily's room and I can't decide which to go with it."
Malfoy looked down on his plate and pushed the food around with a frown on his brow. "Well, it didn't make any difference, anyway. I think I sent out a hundered applications, but no-one wanted to hire a Malfoy, no-one wanted a Death Eater. In the end I said, screw it all. It wasn't as if I needed the money, after all. I went out clubbing, a lot. I couldn't care less. It got pretty self-destructive there for a while." He gave a short snorting laugh. "I was so
She and Minnie had spent many long evenings talking about him, while drinking the smoky single malt they both favoured; the tragedy of his childhood, how malnurished he was, the apparent evidance of abuse and their exasperation that they could do nothing about it. But he also had such an unbreakable spirit, a remarkably strong magic and an irrepressible ability to love. The-Boy-Who-Lived. To save them all.
"That won't work, would it?" Ron reflected, but as he spoke, and before any of them were able to react, the wall opened and Harry disappeared into Slytherin.
Malfoy gave him a long silent look. "Well, anyway. After the war… and everything... I had to get away, away from the Wizarding World, and I found this place. It became a haven for me for a very long time and I made friends here that didn't care where I came from or who my father was. They only wanted to drink and dance and get off. It was very liberating."
"I don't think you should." Potter reached out his hand and put it over Draco's at his side. Almost as of their own free will, their fingers intertwined.
"I... I don't..." Harry stuttered, once again wishing he could summon words to express himself and what he felt. What did he feel?
He turned to face Draco again. "When I saw you dancing in that club... You looked so bloody hot, and all those men were pushing and trying to get close to you, to touch you, and I..." He inhaled deeply. "I guess I've always had a bit of a problem controlling my anger. We were lucky I didn't blow the place up by accident. Anyway, you ran out and I followed you into that alley."
"Don't tell me," Malfoy laughed, "you live in that horrible old town-house that was in Sirius' will?"
At the left on the tabletop there was a box of what looked like tissue. Draco grabbed a handful and closed his eyes. He could do this, he had endured far worse in his life; coercion, torture, Dark Spells and old-fashioned whipping. This was merely a little girls bum. He peaked through one open eye and decided that it'd had to do, and lifted the child into the now perfectly filled bathtub.
With a snorting laugh Draco gave Harry a long wondering look before he continued. "You know the old school-joke about the dating habits in the different Houses?"
"I do not!" His perfectly shaped eyebrows rose indignantly, and he jumped off the desk and threw himself down on the chair at his own desk instead.
Harry stood, a little unsteady and cast him a dark glare. "I don't know of what filth your mind is made of, Zabini," he growled, "but I don't have to stay here and listen to your insults." His heart throbbed at a crazy speed and rivulets of panic clashed up and down his spine, leaving cold sweat in its wake. "Our sons happens to like one another, that's all. I wouldn't go near this place if Al hadn't nagged us about it until he was blue in the face."
He followed them up the stairs and heard Draco talk hushly to his mother at the top of the landing, and then Narcissa turned to Harry. "Would you be so kind to bring me a chair, Harry?"
Harry looked up and saw thick bulging arms, a broad chest and short cropped hair. "Hey, you look jus'like Charlie Weasley. Are you also a dragon-tamer?"
They started eye-fucking each other. The difference wasn't that big from how it used to be, but whenever Harry turned to look at Malfoy,the smirks and the sneers had another innuendo.
Pomfrey grunted. "Oh, I'm sure it was." She pointed her wand at his face and muttered a spell. With a tingling sensation, his nose seemed to stretch, and the pain was almost gone as well. "When will the two of you stop these childish fights, I wonder?"
Harry came back only a few nights later. He'd sworn he never would again, but the thought of what Malfoy had done to him was too strong to resist.
There was something etherial, almost Veela-like over the way he moved. The stoboscope-light that pulsed behind him made it hypnotic to watch. His white-blond hair flicked over his eyes with each jerk of the neck, his hips swivelled and rotated. He had pulled the sleeves up over the elbows and thrown his hands up in the air. Against the pale skin the bluish mark on his arm stood out, dark and ugly, marring the perfection of this breathtakingly beautiful man, making him real and human. Harry gasped and felt his cock swell in his pants.
Draco seemed to be asleep. Harry lowered himself gingerly down at his side, with his teacup and the latest issue of a Quidditch magazine, careful not to disturb him, but when he looked at Draco, he met his grey eyes. "So, this is how we do things?" he said sleepily.
Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose and squeezed his eyes shut. "Maybe. I have a couple of demands, though."
One lube-covered finger slid easily in and Malfoy added one more right away. He worked them around, but Harry clenched up again.
"Let me clean us up a bit," Malfoy said and reached  for his wand on the bedside table. Harry stopped him with a hand on his arm.
Potter shoved his hands into his pockets and grinned slyly. "Weren't that a bunch of fifth-years? And Hufflepuffs too? Sure you don't need my help to scare them away?"
Draco looked at Potter's body. This was nothing like the soft bulge over Gregory Goyle's waistband. Potter's belly was small but taught and protruded firmly from his skinny frame. He really ought to eat more, Draco could see the outline of his ribcage.
Harry sat back and narrowed his eyes at him. "The blood-status of the child, is that really an issue? I thought that kind of thinking was longe gone."
Draco swallowed. Well," he drawled, "don't talk to me about shitty holydays. At least you didn't have to consider the visiting hours at Azkaban."
Robards hummed and fidgeted with the parchment in his hand. "I know we said some harsh things that day, but there's no need to make such a hasty decision."
Harry grinned and snogged him fiercely, just because he could, then popped a piece of toast into his mouth. His jaws ached a little when he chewed, and that made him blush.
Shacklebolt tapped his wand on the podium to ask for silence and the room got quiet. "Honorable members of the Council of Magical Law," he started and let his Delphic gaze swipe over the witches and wizards of the Wizengamot. "You have all heard the testimonies towards these accused, both about their crimes before and during the war, and more surprising, testimonies in their favour, and today I will put it to a vote. You will decide if these three people are guilty of crimes of war, crimes against our Wizard society, or if there are, as have been vouched for, attenuating circumstances."
Then there was the Charms-project, where Flitwick divided us into groups of three and encouraged us to "Create a useful Charm on an ordinary everyday object."
He stood and shrugged off his robes and rapidly opened the buttons of his shirt and pulled it off, revealing a crisscross of scarring, both on his back and chest. The ones on his front Harry identified as the faded marks of the
He felt slightly nervous and wiped his hands absentmindedly on the front of his thighs. He wished he'd dressed differently now, when both Draco and his mother walked in wearing robes, but the truth was Harry hadn't worn robes in a long time, and they were all a bit snug. All the same, he felt a little inadequate in his usual jeans and a burgundy jumper.
He came closer, cupped Harry's chin in his hand and ran his nose slowly along Harry's cheek up to his ear. "Do you think you can trust me, Harry?" he whispered. I quite understand that it might be a bit difficult, given our history, but you did last time and that turned out satisfactory, didn't it?"
Malfoy chortled softly. "You really ought to read the gossip-pages in newspapers more carefully, Potter," he said and emptied his cup before placing it on the coffee-table. "All my father's fault, of course. That's what happens when you force two people together without any of them having a say in the matter of their own marriage." He got to his feet again, walked around in the room until he placed himself behind Harry's chair. "It was quite the scandal at the time, though, her finding me in bed with that man."
Potter took both of his hands out of his pockets, and while he rubbed the back of his neck with one of them, to Draco's surprise, he held out the other to be shaken. "I've been thinking," Potter said, "that it might be time for us to bury the hatchet, call a truce, after all that's happened. If you like?"
Draco walked stiffly into his father's study. He'd never been here at this time of day before. His father usually summoned him in the evening, right before bedtime, to reprimand him for something he had done or neglected. But today the morningsun flowed through the high window, making rays of dust dance merrily among the dark-varnished furniture.
"Ginny'll kill you if you're late for the warm up and her pep-talk. You can't risk that, now that she's finally talking to you again."
"The world's changed since the war," Malfoy continued, "and I belive I've changed with it." There was a light tinge to his cheeks as he looked away.
"Ah, the truth. A bit overrated, don't you think, the truth. There's never only one way to see things, surely you know that, in your line of work, as well as I do."
Poppy's brow wrinkled in thought. Nothing apparent came to her mind. If this had been a young witch on the other hand... well.
Then Granger took a step inside and looked around at the decorations. "Oh, how lovely, it's a Yuletide party!" she exclaimed with a forced cheerfulness. Some of the seven-years had put up a holly wreath over the mantlepiece, and a string of fairy-lights at the ceiling flickered in bright red, green and yellow. Blaise couldn't give a rat's arse about Christmas this year, but he had to admit it made the room feel more welcoming.
Seamus grinned, apparently not sorry at all for what he'd done. "Well, something to dissolve his inhibitions, a dash of Veritaserum,
To his astonishment the house-elf appeared with a distinct crack. "Master Draco called," the old elf croaked out. He could barely stand and trembled all over. It was clear to Draco that he was in no way able to help him with the child. But he must have decades of experience of childcare, and since he had taken a shine to Draco when he started to pay him visits at his den, maybe it could be worth a try to ask.
"I have to know. IS YOUR WIFE YOUR SOULMATE, MALFOY?" Harry was practically shaking with rage. "I can't stop thinking about it. The thought goes round and round in my head, it's driving me crazy. I even dream about you, damn it."
Draco couldn't remember a time during the seven years he'd known Blaise Zabini when he had spoken this passionately about anything. Always cool and composed, Blaise, so unlike Draco's own immature outbursts.
She was, as always, frighteningly practical. She said, "Harry, what do you have to lose. As it is, you've got nothing. You live a kind of half-life, with no time for your friends and only work. I'm actually surprised that you've been able to find time to go to this bar once a week. That's far more than Ron and I've seen you in a year. That means, that this thing with Malfoy must be important to you. There was a special connection between the two of you from the start. So, go for it, have a drink with him, talk. Who knows, he might make you human again."
"It's an Identification potion," she continued, "so that you'll be able to recognize your soulmate, your true love or whatever you'll call it."
Malfoy slumped back. "Fair enough, I suppose," he muttered. "Remember Miles Bletchley? He played Keeper for us our first five years."
"No fucking way," Harry exclaimed. "I couldn't stand him in school, and he's still an arsehole, as I see it."
He put his hand on Potter's neck and pulled him closer. Potter resisted a bit, but Draco was determined and drew him closer. He buried his face at the crook of Potter's neck and whimpered, "Oh, Harry."
"I've already spoken to my superior officer and requested desk duty from the first signs of pregnancy." Harry winced a little when he thought about the piles of paperwork that would be his from now on. Ron had cheered with joy, along with the other Auror-partners, at the prospect of not having to do them for a long time. But it would be worth it, everything would be worth this; a baby. A child of his own, a new start, a different life.
"I was the one who wanted to talk, remember?" Harry snapped, a little more harshly than he intended.
"Serious enough to meet him again, as it seems." Hermione closed the file of Ministry parchments and started to lay out the plates and the cutlery Ron placed in front of her. "What
"You're a good dancer, Draco." Zabini's low voice carried an undertone Harry couldn't quite figure out. "Why don't you show Potter how it's done?"
Harry stopped, bewildered. "But… crush on who?" He knew he was stalling, but he needed to hear it, for Malfoy to say it.
He was back in his own living room and according to the debris and broken items around him, Harry wasn't emotionally balanced at the moment, wasn't dealing very well with his anger issues.
"Merlin's beard, Potter, are you all right?" Malfoy kneeled beside him, supporting Harry's head with his hands.
Draco shrunk the portrait and put it in his pocket. What was left was an empty square on the wall. "What are you going to do with her?" Harry asked. He couldn't help being a bit curious.
"It was hell getting you up the stairs," Potter continued. "If you got any bumps and bruises, they're from then."
Malfoy gave a wry smile. "Among other things, but it was a start and an eye-opener." They walked around the museum, side by side, barely speaking, until they made it to the main entrance again.
When Harry approached the café, Malfoy was already sitting there with two cups of coffee under a discreet heating charm and a giant piece of apple-pie in front of him. He drummed his fingers nervously on the table and searched the entrance repeatedly until he spotted Harry.
It took some time for him to compose himself. The whole night, apparently, but as he walked the corridor to the Great Hall, he felt constrained and confident again, with the Malfoy air and the Malfoy mask, forever the Slytherin Prince.
"Then take this one, Dad," Albus leaned over and rubbed his head at Draco's arm, smearing chicken-fat and tomato-sauce all over his robe-sleeve. "I like him."
Suddenly the flames turned green and Malfoy whirled out elegantly in Harry's living room. He was dressed only in a silky blue dressing gown and his hair was in his usual ponytail, but it was also a bit damp, as if he too came directly from the shower. A lose strand hang over his eyes and Harry had to fight the urge to reach up and push it back behind his ear.
Harry let go of the wobbling cock with a slurping sound and grinned. "If you like?" He moved up and straddled Malfoy's hips and gripped Malfoy's prick with his hand. With the other he continued to probe a digit in and out his hole to open himself up. His own shaft was leaking as it rubbed against Malfoy's in a glorious way. Harry panted heavily and tried to add another finger.
"Here?" Potter croaked, red as a peony in the face. Poppy sighed. These youngsters with their twisted morals. Some things were perfectly alright to do, like semi-public masturbation; she knew what went on in the showers. Other things made them so tiringly embarrassed. "I have no particular preference of where you relieve yourself, Mr Potter, as long as it is in the cup, but there's a loo behind that door over there, as you very well know by now," she said, and her mouth twisted into a skew smile.
Mr. Cook chuckles. “Well, you’ll have opportunity to prove yourself just fine, as my partner and I will be stopping by to check in on you and Teddy periodically until you are either deemed fit or not.”
“It’s not ridiculous! You’re going to look me in the eye and tell me you’re not one bit nervous about meeting with them?”
Harry glances at Draco, who wants nothing more than to groan. He really ought to teach Harry how to lie. Stay calm and confident, make sure to sprinkle in enough truth so that it’s impossible to separate what’s false.
He looks up from his reading for an approaching theory exam a couple hours later. Draco is at the foot of the couch, just home.
Still groggy, Teddy only looks at the Care-Seeker, face expressionless. Harry gives him a gentle jostle.
Certainly he isn’t invited in any case. This is clearly a blanket flyer. It’s being mass-distributed and not even by magic. The wizard shuffling down the corridor likely doesn’t even know Draco lives here.
Draco's head tilted back as he moaned openly, subconsciously thrusting up into Harry's hand and then back down on his finger. Harry's finger sunk all the way in at the movement, and Draco's muscles tightened around him. But Draco didn't seem uncomfortable, nearing on the exact opposite as he crashed his lips back to Harry's in a desperate kiss. Harry began to twist his hand on Draco's cock, sliding it up and down and keeping his other hand as still as he could while Draco came up and down on his finger.
Teddy gives him away. But as Draco’s frown turns to him, Harry tries to appear nonchalant. “It wasn’t a
Harry's face turned bright red. The clatter around them had died down and the lights had softened, and Harry realized that the restaurant was ridiculously romantic. "I didn't mean it that way. Do you mind?"
"Well," Draco tugged Harry's hand closer and graced his teeth over the knuckles. "Ravenclaws has stress-relief sex to improve their grades. Hufflepuffs does everything in group, nobody's left out. We Slytherins pride ourselves with having calculated relations, always looking at what a person could gain from the date. Guess what the Gryffindors are famous of?"
"Can't get enough of dungeons at Hogwarts, can you?" James teased. "That's snakes for you. Ouch," he added as Al pinched him.
"Fuck you, Potter!" he spat and smacked Harry's hand off his arm. "So much for being friends, huh," he scowled. "You think I'd want someone to kiss me out of pity? I don't need a sodding consolation-prize."
"No," Harry gave a short laugh. "It's a private matter. I'm not with the Aurors anymore." At that Malfoy's eyebrow shot up, questioning. "I went on parental leave when my daughter was born."
Dissappointed Harry turned and focused instead on the heated discussion at his own table, while they all waited for the food to arrive. Harry was starving.
There was a surprisingly homey atmosphere in the room. The colours on the walls and the furniture were all modern, and it clashed boldly against the high windows and the stucco decorated ceiling.
After the war I pretended for a long time that I was alright. I attended Auror-academy, as one of the youngest ever, and I continued dating Ginny Weasley. I kept telling myself, that this was what I wanted, that I was happy, but of course, Ginny wasn't that easy to fool. One night when we were in bed together, making love, she stated, "You're thinking of someone else. You're not with
"It's not great!" Malfoy spat and finished his beer in one long draught. He looked intensely at the moist on the outside of the glass and followed a watery pearl with his forefinger before he met Harry's gaze from under his fringe. "Astoria's decent enough, I guess. I'm sure we'll learn to get along."
Harry also asked for a large bottle of water, as he felt the need to sober up a bit. He felt stupidly nervous in Malfoy's presence and was very glad they were in familiar surroundings.
"Bullshit!" Zabini snickered. "You love dancing, you always dance. Go on." He gave them both a little push. "Dance with Potter here, teach him your moves."
"Oh. Is it a 'sitting down on the sofa with coffee'-confession or a 'standing in the hall putting the coat on'-confession?"
"I can't see why you're so worked up on the idea about Harry and Malfoy," Ron said with a dark glance at his wife. "I mean, it's still Malfoy. And we don't really know if it was the Identification potion in the first place. Maybe Harry just fainted from being tired, maybe it was bad Indian curry. It could be a hundred different answers and now you're playing Matchmaker for our best friend, trying to set him up with a man we know absolutely
"You're such a halfwit, Potter," Draco huffed. "No one cleans the gravel from their trainers in the shower. Did you momentarily forget how to use your magic?"
She was, in no way perfect, Neville knew that of course. She had been mean and haughty as a young girl, and during the year when the Carrows controlled Hogwarts she had done nothing to protest against the injustices. She had kept a low profile, but Neville knew she'd been scared, scared out of her wits, scared enough to try to end it all by pointing out Harry that day of the final battle. Neville'd heard later from Harry, that she had come up to him after it all was over and, in tears, had begged Harry to forgive her for what she'd done.
Harry thought it must be a sure sign of Malfoy getting slightly inebriated, the way he started ranting on about some wine-tasing he'd done while in France, of the villa the family owned near Montpellier and how the wine tasted there in the sunny afternoons on the patio. His voice drawled on and on and the melodic sound made Harry sink into his soft chair and close his eyes and...
