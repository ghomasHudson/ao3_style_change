“I’ll try and be more gentlemanly next time then.” She spotted another boy in a fake Ballycastle Bats uniform. “Hey Vince!”
I could hear some humming come from the bathroom, and I got out of bed to see what Malfoy was doing.
“Oh that’s so nice.” She poked his nose dismissively. “Now lets have dinner while its hot or I might have to torture a house elf.” She grinned sweetly and pulled on a curly lock of hair. Draco followed her.
"Casey Way's Curlifier 5002, the perfect way to regain your old curly hair. Simply apply straight to head and watch for instant results..." I looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. "You're going to make your hair curly again?" He nodded while grinning.
"Ron. Ron Weasley." The boy smiled. A Weasley? Draco tried to keep his face impassive and his opinion unbiased, but it was difficult with what his father had told him about Weasleys. Apparently they're just as good as Weasels, they live in a filthy hovel, have too many red haired children, and are as poor as dirt. Draco tried not to let any of that affect his view of Ron.
“I’m wearing them you blind bat.”
Draco flushed. "Okay, okay, fine, but none of the extravagant stuff really benefits me. Other than the library."
“I’ve never told anyone. And you can’t tell anyone! It’s really important you don’t tell anyone.” Draco knows he barely needs to tell Blaise this. Blaise is helpful. Blaise wouldn’t tell.
“-giving off sparks!”
“And how do we do that?” Potter asked.
Trousers left on from the night before were colour charmed to look like uniform, and school jumpers were thrown across rooms to make sure everyone was covered up. Most already had their ties tied to their foreheads so that they could transfer it into their outfits, and everyone was scrambling to get to the bathroom to brush out the disgusting taste of last night from their teeth.
"Ready when you are, Ludo."
At least, I assumed it was him, since he was so covered in his own luggage I could only make out the tips of his hair.
“Seems more like a couples costume to me. But anyway, come with me Via. Lets get Draco a costume.”
"What do you mean, Potter?"
“Yes!” Pansy yelled at him as she returned. “You will make a wonderful Veela Draco, you’re so pretty.” He scowled.
Aunt Bella cooed at him delightedly and reached over the table to hug him. “You have made Auntie very proud of you. And I’m sure the Dark Lord will be immensely happy to have such a competent mind within the ranks. You will grow to do great things oh yes you will.” She held his head and shook it around slightly with glee. He tried to make sure she didn’t crick his neck. “But even if you become our Lord’s right hand man, don’t forget about Auntie.” She held his head a bit firmer, threateningly, and he stared up at her imploringly.
“My name is Draco. Now you tell me yours.” He ordered. The intruder’s eyes widened.
“I like it. Like the way you say it. Draaake. Drake. Sounds nice.” He told Blaise.
He was sat on the floor and leaning against the potions shelf, resting a heavy Latin book in his lap. And then one of his romance paperbacks tucked within the bigger book.
After realising that I'd been staring I awkwardly cleared my throat and averted my eyes. What the hell was that about?
"Hold on a second Malfoy." I began searching through my case of school things and parchment, while finally finding a rectangular narrow box. I opened it up and revealed it to a confused Malfoy. "Ta-da!"
As if sensing eyes on her, she turned round to face Draco. He smiled at her but she only scowled at him and turned back around.
“This is why I didn’t talk about her, because you’d butt heads! Now go away! Leave me be!” Via told him, trying to push away by his back.
“Hey Octi,” he greeted her and took great pleasure as she glared at him in embarrassment.
He saw Terry and Anthony and Michael. He saw Hermione and Neville. He saw Harry. He saw pity.
"What do you mean, you didn't need a gift? Don't muggles give gifts at birthdays?" Draco asked, cocking his head.
He was WORTHLESS. He was NOTHING. He was STUPID and IGNORANT and DISAPPOINTING and DISRESPECTFUL and REPULSIVE. He was lucky to be born a Malfoy, but none of that matters now. He was a RAVENCLAW. It hadn't quite sunk in yet, but with his face tucked into his knees and a ringing in his ears, he felt hopeless. Even if he could swap houses, the damage was done. His father still wouldn't love him. He just wanted to make him proud.
She pulled out a long sleeve black top and a pair of black tights with a small black skirt. She wanted to make her pale skin look as pale as possible in a contrast. She wore her small red slippers on her feet, ruining the effect somewhat, but vampires were known to be very silent hunters.
On the way to the library Draco hears a sneer from behind him.
I picked up a lock of my hair to check if it would reflect in the mirror. It did. So that's my hair?
They ended up settling on a black button up dress shirt, dark grey trouser and a white jacket. The white jacket had some contrasting green details, ivy, which were arranged around the hem and the sleeves. It also appeared to be crawling up his neck at the back of the jacket, giving it an eerie but elegant effect. Perfect for a Slytherin Prince. To top it all off, he had a dark green tie, pulling the whole outfit together.
“Not right now. Not if you don’t already know.”
“I’m sorry for being gay. I really do want to like you back.”
"Gahh!" I fell off the sofa, taking a couple of cushions with me. From the carpet I could see Malfoy looking down at me with a smirk. I scowled.
"Sure, whatever Malfoy.Truce?" I held out my hand to shake, suddenly taken back to first year on the steps of Hogwarts.
The cold was seeping through his coat, and the cold numbness was far crueler than his brain’s numbness. His hair was covered in ice. He probably looked like a twat.
He rose his gaze to try and make out Via, but couldn’t see her. He shouldn’t bother her anyway. She was with her friends. She was fine.
I was going to have the classroom scene but I feel like I'v made you wait for long enough, I'm sorry for the infrequency when it comes to chapter updates, I am going to try harder. If you'd like me to add a minor headcanon or something like that then feel free to comment, this is a very relaxed fic. A comment and a kudo are always appreciated! Stay strong my amigos!
" She scowled at the hat's comments.
’ on his arm. It was something pretty serious, a-and,” she took a breath, “that is something that Draco will have to tell you himself. But I am worried about him. Especially around Professor Moody.”
"What do you mean by that?"
"Woah, Viktor Krum posters! They're everywhere!" He went closer to one to see how it moved, but all it did was blink and scowl harder. He loved it.
"Of course young Mr Malfoy, you are a true charm prodigy. Well done indeed!" He congratulated the boy. "Now, as long as everyone's okay and not hurt, I'd like the rest of you to focus on your levitating. We still have five minutes left!" He resumed the lesson to normal. Except it wasn't. Everyone was still staring at Draco.
He was only walking for 30 seconds before he nearly knocked into someone, a glare of light blue uniform. He looked upwards and saw a girl with thick and curly blonde hair.
He guided his mother to her room, where she lay on top of the covers face up. She fell asleep within a minute of laying down.
“Why?”
The first ‘movie’ they’d watched was called ‘Gremlins’. It was about a stupid boy who doomed his town because he couldn’t listen to simple instructions. How difficult was it to care for a pet? The ‘gremlins’ themselves looked quite creepy, but thankfully a muggleborn boy called Jack Thompson informed her that they weren’t real muggle pets, or real creatures at all. That relieved her a bit.
The second sign was that he had a pounding in his head that refused to go away.
“You do tend to go overboard.” He dug into his pocket and pulled out a sugar quill, which he then snapped in half. “Here,” he offered her one half, “to the Malfoy siblings.”
After her was Neville Longbottom, who performed a great many gymnastic feats that Draco knows for a fact he wouldn’t have been able to perform otherwise.
Everything from the night before returned to me at once, and I looked up at the ceiling from my bed to see the faded stars stuck on, looking dull in the daylight than shone through a window. I looked over to Malfoy's bed to find it empty yet immaculate, as if no one had ever touched it before.
"I think...I think it's because what Ron lacks, like a bit of intelligence and understanding, Hermione makes up for. And vice versa in the sense that Ron can relax and understands friends and family . How he's a pureblood who knows all about the Wizarding World, and Hermione's muggle born who knows about the muggle world, they each help each other understand. They're so different, but they share enough similarities to get on and be friends, and then date. They bicker and quarrel but it's how they love each other. They help each other's confidence, they've been through a war together, and after surviving and fighting and getting through the grief, they still want to be together!" I cut myself off before I carried on rambling. Malfoy seemed to be lost in thought on this.
“I’m gonna stay here for a little bit, I still need a moment.” Draco told him. Vince smiled.
That sent Blaise into peels of laughter, and for Draco to pout like in one of his usual tantrums. Vince was watching the whole debacle with a confused look, whereas Pansy and Greg had just ignored the interaction in favour of homework.
“I am doing wonderful my little student. We’ve gotten a lead on Potter, and we plan to trap him! He has been so fickle lately, trying to get at the Dark Lord’s horc-“ she glanced up at him. “The Dark Lord’s weaknesses. It has been difficult but we’ve finally got him! Isn’t it exciting!” She smiled madly and he tried to meet her grin.
“Harry!” Sirius cried.
"I don't know, the principle I guess?" Letting people know that it might be locked for a reason because they get their wands out? No clue." I nodded and with a click, opened up the door. Malfoy went straight into the bathroom to stock up all the bottles and I promptly collapsed onto my bed, not even bothering with my clothes.
“I mean ride my broom! I just wanted to fly.”
“You have a crush on Greg.”
"We stretched the rules of my parole and having to be back at the flat with Mark by sundown. So Luna here, the little rebel, decided to Apparate to this place called 'Densey Land Paris' for the day. I think it's a 'theme park', and has a lot of 'rolling coasters'. I don't know what those have to do with coasters, but the smaller ones are quite fun."
“Cheers.” Draco retuned. He then cleared his throat and cupped one of his hands round his mouth in order to project over the cheering crowd. “Oi! Blaise! Your alcohol’s here!” And just like that the table was swarmed by a hundred students, all desperate to be rebellious.
“Disgusting.”
He was lead away by a teacher into the chamber.
The flames within the goblet turned a sudden red, with sparks flying from it thematically, keeping every person in the great hall on the edge of their seat. The very next moment, a charred piece of parchment flew out of the goblet and fluttered down. A gasp rang out across the hall.
He frowned and opened up another book on transfiguration. He had a theory brewing that a more permanent form of transfiguration would take more internal magic. It would drain him, but wandless magic relies more on a wizard’s emotions and internal function. If he tried very hard he could probably transfigure the cushion into Cushion wandlessly.
Potter responded by grabbing a book from behind himself and opening in turn. Draco glanced at the cover and snorted.
And to my surprise, it was easier.
"How are you feeling today, Mother?" Draco asked her timidly. She smiled down at him, her blonde hair falling in tresses down her shoulder.
"Here." Draco said as he gave Octavia 25 Galleons. "Keep that, and don't tell Mother and Father that we had change. That's how you get more money later." And he pocketed his own remaining Galleons into a pouch. Octavia nodded at the wise knowledge she was bestowed and hid her change.
Draco felt like asking why the Dark Lord would not simply take the blood of another enemy, as he seemed to have many crawling around -ready to be squashed- but apparently he needed the blood of his greatest enemy. And Draco would never (outwardly) question his great lord.
“W-well you were really good at Transfiguration!” Octavia blinked at the girl.
" - And that's how electricity works."
It was definitely an off day.
“Normal?!”
“Then kiss me!” She ordered, pointing at her lips. He looked at her nervously.
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder, and the doors of the Great Hall opened.
"I'm guessing we pretend to date this year, then?"
Pansy went and dragged him by his pyjama shirt down to her eye level and smiled threateningly. “Good, because if you do, you will find my limited edition Louis Vuittons so far up your ass you will be choking on the heel.” She patted him on the head and turned to Draco. “I don’t know what he is doing here, but have fun! We’ll talk about the...’thing’ tomorrow!” He nodded and waved her goodbye.
“The whole what?”
What was he doing, taking Draco? What good would it do?
“The champion for Beauxbatons...is Fleur Delacour!” He announced.
"It's ridiculous, I got my hopes up so far..."
Please comment any ideas you might want in the story as I am very open to them!
"Octi! Be polite when we're public!" Octavia went red.
"Thanks, but I think I'll go with the legal way. But if it doesn't work out, I'll keep it in mind." They smiled at each other uncertaintly. I was only happy someone had reeled in S.P.E.W a bit. "You seem quite knowledgable about the Ministry and it's inner workings, do you mind explaining that to me tomorrow in a bit more detail. I'd ask Ron but he doesn't really like...politics." From the expression on Ron's face you would have thought he'd be more than happy to teach Hermione about the politics he didn't know.
He walked up briskly and took the hat. He sat on the stool and waited with a cool expression.
When he returned I deemed it time ask a burning question that I'd been wondering about.
A little more seriously, Potter asked “Do you really know a way to stop everyone hating me?” He frowned. “It’s getting a bit old.”
"The Potter family riches ring any bells?" I thought back to my vault full of gold in Gringotts. Sure, it was a lot of money, but it didn’t have 250 thousand Galleons. So I said as much.
She missed the old gang a lot however. Martha was so popular with so many girls who all already knew about girly things and being social and being fun and being half blood and all that, so Octavia felt distant. And Danny was a bit boring sometimes. He always seemed to tuck in on himself, and wasn’t up for very riveting conversation.
“Perfect. Later then. Goodbye Drakey, our group’s oblivious and supportive Veela.” Blaise wrapped his arms around him and squeezed.
"Those two looked nice." Terry's voice came from directly behind him.
He’d heard about side effects of excessive use of the Cruciartus Curse on people as well, but refused to acknowledge it. He wasn’t going to St Mungos to become some bedridden Longbottom; a poor victim of the war. He wasn’t that far gone.
Draco's face pinched in anger. How dare he swear in front of Via! "Language, Weasley! There are kids here!" Octavia bopped him on the head.
"Not a strong enough answer. Wait for someone else to try."
"I remember it pretty well since it was my first day of Hogwarts and it was one of the first times I'd stood up for myself. Didn't you blush bright red when you were rejected?" I teased, watching as a blush spread down from high on his cheek bones as he scowled playfully.
The next step seemed to be that sound would suddenly erupt from the hall, causing chaos and pandemonium, but no. It seemed it was too late to have an effect, everyone was still quietly shaken.
“To officially commemorate our Slytherin-ness.” Martha had said.
"I was thinking more of a 'favour' from you Draco. You blonde, single stud." He wiggles his eyebrows unnaturally well.
"What is the racket in here?" Her voice asked in a dreamy fashion. Her eyes were distant and her hair was loose. She was still in a white nightgown, the one Draco liked most. It was pretty and flowing and Mother felt mot comfortable in it. It made her look like an angel.
“What’s Greg wearing?” He asked.
He turned to Potter with a wide smirk. Potter raised an eyebrow. “You really love controlling a room. Being the centre of attention.”
I could feel my face turn a bit red but I couldn't stop myself from staring. From this angle his hair framed his face in natural ringlets, making his face seem impossibly paler. The rest surrounded his head in a sort of halo, twisted and turned in a fashion that looked purposeful, yet accidental. He had no hair parting, it simply defied gravity around him, much alike Hermione's but far more different. It was a curly and frizzy mess of a hairstyle.
“Oh sorry! I just, uh-“
"I'll just stay here Malfoy, on one condition. I call for a truce." I walked over to him.
“Eh, not really,” at a sharp glance from Blaise he clarifies, “he’s not that handsome. Or attractive.”
Next to the door leading up to the dormitories stands a tall statue of Rowena Ravenclaw, made completely of white marble. She stood regally in front of a large niche full of books, a door in the center, most likely leading to yet more books. In front of the statue was where Meredith stopped.
Potions and Transfiguration class. 2nd September 1991.
“As if I’d ever tell a Blood Traitor.” That answer was followed by being spat at.
“Well I was in the library helping Viktor do some studying before his task.” He began. Octavia wiggled her eyebrows but he didn’t raise to the bait. “And he gets distracted by Granger of all people! Thinks she’s ‘dedicated to her studies’! I’m dedicated to my studies, thats why I was helping him!” He takes a breath as he realises he was getting worked up. Octavia pat his back.
She’d never forgive him for not letting her drink with the older kids. It wasn’t like she’d never had a small sip, she had been to France with Mum before, and drinking with the older kids would have cemented a place in popularity amongst her peers. But he just
“We were going to practice some magic? How about we go to the libra-“
Dumbledore reached up to catch it as it fell, and read it out loud.
Greg snorted. “The only reason Draco uses last names is because he thinks it sounds cool.” He mocks lightly.
He woke up with a sack on his head. This was not normal.
Draco flinches at the name. “Eh, I’m the one who was bothered enough to torment you on a weekly basis, not yearly. I mean if you really count up the grievance we’ve both caused-“
SIBLING POV CHANGE
“I still can’t believe there’s no quidditch this year” Vince mentioned offhandedly, cheek on his fist.
“Wait, really?” Pansy guffawed as the other boys exchanged a shocked look. “Blaise, you didn’t.”
"You better not be like this for the rest of holiday." She told him as they left the box down the purple carpeted stairs.
"C'mon guys, breakfast is in 15 minutes, the post will be here soon." Anthony told them, packing his things into his schoolbag. Draco jumped out of his bed and rushed to the mirror. He supposed he could keep what he had on, he didn't think it smelled too bad yet. His hair however...
“Nearly eighteen.” Draco adds casually, although he was very excited. “In less than a week I’ll be eighteen. I would’ve been allowed outside then, and would’ve gotten the-“ the Dark Mark. But he didn’t think that would be a wise thing to tell them. He didn’t know how much they knew. So he pursed his lips.
"Ha! Remind me to thank Mrs Goyle for that one."
"She couldn't come with me to King's Cross. Too many people. I said goodbye to her at the Manor." He would miss her so.
“You were lurking. Lurking is a pervert’s sport.” He told her a-matter-of-factly. Her face opened up into a surprising grin.
While he'd been doing this, Narcissa had gotten out a cook book and had layed baking ingredients out on the marble island. She smiled at him.
He hesitantly walked in, making it past a couple of house elves to get to a large table where much breakfast food was sat. He saw a group of bottles neatly tucked together, and read the sign they were labelled with.
“It’s in my room.” He said quietly and lead the way there, seeming to be done with the kicking. He went up a couple of sets of stairs and entered the bedroom right beside the library. Regulus’ old room. Taking a look inside Sirius saw that the library had practically merged with the room, being covered wall to wall in stacks of books and paper. A studious kid, Sirius supposed.
“A...pet?” Her smile was grotesque and Draco clutched the wand in his pocket.
He started with the alcohol bottles, the most important items to rid the evidence of, and collected them all in a bag, the shattering noise of the glass causing some in the room to wake and groan. He didn’t care. After they were all in a bag he charmed the bag away, to a void he guessed, and got out another bag.
He figured the best way to clean up would be by collecting the rubbish together in plastic bags and then charming away the bags so there’d be less items to rid off and waste magic on.
Potter and Sirius turned around and cringed in unison. Draco stroked Cushion some more, entertained.
Greg and Vince were the only ones Octavia would let call her Octi, though Draco doesn't know why. Maybe it's because they never say it to tease her, as it's always genuine with those two, or because of the speech impediment Vince had when he was younger, where he had great difficulty pronouncing long names. Whatever the reason, Draco knew the boys loved having a younger sister figure. It made them feel more mature and responsible.
“I ‘ave doubt that it vas very fun without me att-end-ing.” Dobromir cut in as usual. What was with him and cutting into conversations? He was flexing his muscles and Draco had a dark time determining whether or not he was joking.
He couldn't wait until Hogwarts.
“Well yes, but I don’t see how that’s important-“
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
“Ew.” He stated. “Like kissing? That’s real grown up stuff.”
"But Mother, we should really finish making the fairy cakes. They're nearly done!" He sighed in relief as she calmed down to a smile.
They entered Ollivander's quietly.
"What's S.P.E.W?" He asked suddenly. Ah. Damn it. Hermione must be trying to start it up again. She grinned hesitantly at Malfoy's question, glad that someone had asked so she could further explain house elf rights, but wary of that someone being Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Have you even been outside before?” At Sirius’ question the kid flushed and holy shit. It was a joke!
He landed on a grassy patch outside, the growl of the engine alerting the household of his arrival.
His legs are were getting tired so he manoeuvred himself and Blaise onto the floor, hidden inside one of the castle’s many crevices. The music from the Yule Ball was still blasting loudly. Blaise was humming to it.
And everything was okay.
.” Draco elaborated, waving a hand dismissively.
"Oh you may not think I'm pretty,
So to his feelings, he squashes them down, gently mind you, and puts them safely in a drawer. They’re to be forgotten and kept a secret but regardless he keeps them safe.
“Could you teach me wandless magic?” Potter asked him, moving close to the bubble and Draco felt scrutinised. He hated feeling scrutinised.
A scarlet clad figure on a broom shot out onto the pitch from the entrance far below to a wild applause  from the Bulgarian supporters.
“Hello there handsome.” Blaise’s voice was softer than usual. Less dramatic.
Pulling himself away from his awe, Draco focused on what that actually meant. He wasn’t in London anymore.
He held his wand and focused on the spell as he aimed it down at the feather. "Wingardium Leviosa." Before he knew what was happening, the desk disloged itself and began floating towards the ceiling. "Merlin." Draco whispered as it continued to rise towards the ceiling. Everyone was ducking underneath their own desks for fear of the getting hit by his falling down. This was not good, not good, not at all! His internal panic was too much, he couldn't control it - he was useless - he couldn't do a simple spell right - he was bad - he - he -
“We’re still rich enough to do that.” She poked him. He shrugged again.
“Then why do you want him to-“
“Suuuurrrrreeee.” Blaise leaned over Draco and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I do have an actual question though.”
“I thought you had a truce?” Vince asked, grabbing the badge to press it again.
“I’m making far too many deals with Malfoys lately.” He commented and Octavia smirked.
"It's because every single Malfoy since the beginning of Hogwarts was in Slytherin. All of my ancestors. My lineage is based upon being a Slytherin. And being rich. The Black family on Mother's side was also completely compiled of Slytherins, my cousin Sirius. They were disowned and burned from the family portrait. He's now in Azkaban." At Harry's confused look he elaborated. "The highest security wizarding prison in Britain. People have been disowned for less. It's considered disrespectful and traitorous to differ. I'm lucky to be here." He wiped at his eyes with his arm.
"Within limitations. Obviously I'm not going to sacrifice myself or anything for the ghost of Godric Gryffindor, but a pretty good favour. What do you want? Money? Advice? A password to the Slytherin common room? Potion ingredients from Snape's stores? Illegal reading material? A Hogwarts secret? Alcohol? Sleakeazy's Hair Potion?" Potter's eyes widened at the array of choices.
“‘Ow polite of heem!”
"What in Heavens name has happened to this shirt Potter. What did it ever do to you for you to feel the need to wear this day in day out, and for you to not to take it out of its misery?" He continued to ruffle through my clothing.
“Well...it definitely cant be those last two,” with a quick glare from Draco, Blaise put his hands up in surrender, “I’m sorry but its true. That’s where you get most of your laughs from. Where your creativity shines. Your incredible and witty insults.” Draco rolled his eyes but felt secretly pleased. “And what do you mean you have too much to do?”
“As if you’re not a worse drama queen.”
“I guess so.”
Draco is introduced to the Ravenclaw Tower. 1st September 1991.
Draco cocked an eyebrow, half thinking that it was over, and half being on the fence.
"Stupid boy!" The man grabbed Draco's arms away from the books he was holding, gloved hand flush against the boy's bleeding gashes. Draco gasped in pain and shock and tried to take his hands back. Lucius yanked the boy's arms away to stay in front of him, the force of the pull enough to topple every one off the books. Draco watched in despair as each hardcover hit the blood stained carpeted floor, everything out of his control. His hands were shaking on a minuscule level while they were in his father's cruel grasp. He faced the man's eyes, fearful for the punishment.
Well it’s ridiculous.
“Those are the Halloween decorations , Hogwarts likes to go all out.”
He heard a branch snap and his snapped to alert, shushing the three. "I heard something."
“You are such a git, stop making up fabrications out of my life!”
He went to sleep.
Not that there would be much difference with these idiots.
"What!" Draco yelled in anger, thumping a hand down on the table. Similar reactions were gathered across the four tables, with many quidditch players looking ready to plot a murder.
“How about we agree on it being a dream. I think that’ll be best.” She nodded into his hand before getting up, tottering slightly on her high heels.
The path was filled with other scared people, and Draco could see a mother frantically searching for her daughters. His stomach churned again, and he kept his gaze forward.
"You will organise yourselves into pairs and will prepare a simple potion to cure boils; Mendaron. Please get out your textbooks and go to page 5. The instructions will also be written on the board." He explained. "The ingredients and tools are in the cupboard to the left. Do not spill anything or there will be consequences." And they all got to work.
Hopefully it wasn’t close to what Blaise was doing to Theo Nott’s face while he sat on the best armchair, Nott sitting on his so called ‘best lap’, snogging the life out of each other. It was like two dementors except they were horny teens.
"Yes or no, final time I'm asking, do you want a piggy back?" He offered again, getting off of his knees and brushing off the filth.
“So...” she prodded gently.
"Tell me about it." Draco mumbled, trying to hide his dread. "Hey, uh, would you two like to see what the library is like at break? I haven't seen it yet and want to see how it compares to the one at the manor."
“Shuddup you bastard.” He muttered groggily.
“Not yet!” She scolded. “And not if you still want to duet with me later!” Blaise backed away with his hands up in a surrender.
“It’s doesn’t matter, you addiction to sugar can wait.” She walked beside him to the dorms. “Why the gloomy face?”
“Really?”
With a little more unease, I went back to my breakfast.
It was rather expository, as most of Dumbledore’s speeches were. Octavia had already taken a guess that they’d be reusing the Goblet of Fire, it was only the item they’d used every other Triwizard Tournament.
"My parents have been talking about dating boys this year, and they've been hinting towards you," she told him with an apologetic smile. He sighed and returned the smile tiredly.
"It's called improvising and being creative. Not all students get a new adventure or mystery to solve each year, so to entertain ourselves in the Slytherin common rooms we'd have competitions of who could make up the best insult, or threat, or who could collect the most abstract thing from one of the houses dormitories."
“Why did you do that?” Asked Greg, before nearly tipping over his inkwell. Blaise shrugged with a smirk.
"Do you want any help?" Harry asked.
"Hah, she looks like a mini you! Except, you know, a girl." Octavia's scowl deepened, and her fists clenched tighter. Just at it looked like she was about to punch Weasley, Draco held her hand back.
"I've told you before, and I'll tel you again, stop spreading such lies and propaganda!"
After a second of deliberation, Potter agreed with a smirk. Draco rolled his eyes as he began to walk back to Slytherin dormitories.
Successfully this time.
It was almost 7pm and Aunt Bella still hadn’t returned from her rounds yet. Apparently she was collaborating with some other death eaters to take down some nay sayers. Her plan had really reached it’s penultimate stage, and they were incredibly close to allowing the Dark Lord to be reborn. They were putting together a Regeneration Potion and desperately needed Harry Potter’s blood. They had not yet captured him, and were growing very desperate.
You know the drill, if you like it and haven’t yet pls give a kudo, if you wanna be reminded of updates then bookmark or subscribe, and to help me fuel my shit work ethic for faster chapters, any comments are always appreciated!
"However, you seem confused at my request. But I can't see how that could be. I specifically remember ordering you to memorise all 25 of the Pureblood laws. Completely. In and Out. Back. To. Front. And if you can't recite them backwards, then are you saying that you disobeyed me? That you enjoy disappointing your parents and your heritage? Is that what you are trying to communicate through those Abraxas forsaken stutters?" He circled his son, his cane raised threateningly, daring the boy to breath out of line.
"Y-yes sir."
==============
“IS THIS A HICKEY?!”
Draco was having one of his moments.
“Hey Draco, you know when you explained how to translate the Tagalog into German and then back into the ruins, can you over the part where you...” he trailed off as he noticed the position the trio was in. His face went blank. “Not even going to ask.” Pansy cackled.
“See you later!”
"Don't call me that!" An indignant shout came from the closet.
Draco looked over to Potter, making eye contact with said boy. Draco looked away quickly and looked back through his Omnioculars at the game, his ears going pink instead. Octavia looked back to Potter to see a bewildered boy staring at her brother. She interrupted his staring by giving him a wave, causing him to flush and look back to the game.
The gathered around him again.
"Awww," a coo interrupted them. "So sweet. I'm glad you two have made up. At least now there's another person who knows about the 'muggle' world in our group. Neville doesn't even know what a microwave is!" Hermione said.
He’d been dragged on stage with Blaise and performed an unsurprisingly terrible rendition of ‘I Want It That Way’ by the Backstreet Boys, one which many people applauded anyway, did a less terrible rendition of ‘No Scrubs’ by TLC with Pansy, and an absolutely brilliant (if Draco said himself) rendition of ‘Don’t Stop Believing’ by Journey alongside Draco. The song ended in the entire dorm singing it and a hilarious voice crack from Potter that Draco would hold over him for the rest of his life.
"Um...so, like, any favour?" Draco frowned.
“You are the worst.”
“I don’t want to do anything further, you know? We can do this instead.” Blaise kissed Theo’s neck and Octavia felt uncomfortable again. She was about to leave but the scene kept playing.
When her brother and his friends returned to the dungeons that night, it was chaos. Greg and Vince were both questioning Draco incessantly, while Draco determinedly attempted to ignore them both. Blaise was trying to stop the two boys from pushing too far as Pansy looked at them all from the sidelines with annoyance.
Potter snorted again. “You seem to have no problem getting attention. All of Slytherin seems to bend to your will, you sit next to Viktor Krum at every meal, and every Beauxbatons student I’ve met seems to be obsessed with you.” Draco flushed happily.
Then she noticed a small cardboard box next the armchair, one which Draco’s hand was dangling over.
"Yes, exactly! Preach it! Ravenclaw pride!" Michael agreed loudly, trying to stand up. Anthony snickered and dragged Michael back to his seat by his robe.
Potter really ought to learn fashion. He’s in the public eye now! He needs to pick out a higher quality accessory or two. If Draco were a celebrity you wouldn’t see him showing up on the front page of the Prophet looking like Potter does.
"Ah Fudge," Lucius offered his hand to be shaken, "how are you? I don't think you've met my wife Narcissa? Or my children, Octavia and Draco?" Draco gave Fudge a fake smile and Octavia gave him a stilted curtsy. Fudge carried on introductions as the children walked over to their seats.
What was he going to do?
He tried to do it subtlety with Greg and Vince, sending a small jinx towards Greg so that he’d wake up without being embarrassed. He gave them some awkward privacy before deigning the both of them with hangover potions.
"But Narcissa! They're the animal of the Malfoys!"
And then we were just kind of staring at each other.
“You really do look like a Veela. So sparkly.” Draco rolled his eyes.
A few more students were sorted into their respected houses until Draco was called up. He put all his worries out in front of him, and then folded them neatly away. He then put them in a drawer in his mind, and locked it up. He was a Malfoy, and he was going to go up in front of the entire school to be sorted into Slytherin. Now is not the time to panic.
"Come on Potter, let's make you presentable." He began heading out the door.
I love you all! Until next time! xxxx ❤️
The other people in the box heard her, and turned to see the hilarious situation. The three weirdos started laughing as Ludo Bagman said "Now we can't have that! Someone slap the referee!" Sounding amused.
memories of your seventh birthday!"
"I mean how did someone so crude and jealous as Weasel manage to seduce someone as intelligent and as pretty as Granger. He makes her know-it-all attitude look worthy of being a 10 when compared to him. How'd he do it?" I was surprised at his offhanded compliments for Hermione, even though they were veiled in other insults.
“What do you want?” He asked Blaise. The other boy pouted.
With that last word, everyone began to stand up to go up to the dormitories. The other first years followed a prefect around, but Octavia stayed by Draco.
“So this is my hair curler, all natural, so we can style and twist our hair to look absolutely stunning!”
"I...also thought that it was pretty brave of you." Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
He woke up a couple more Slytherins, providing his favourites with hangover potions, and the rest with mild pain charms as he sent them off to their rooms. He continued to clean up the mess, and not much to his surprise, no one returned to help.
“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” Then the golden trio exchanged a secretive glance with each other and Hagrid. It was then that Draco remembered the dragon incident from first year.
Books were his true love. Whether fact or fiction, something was always gained from a book. Because of Rule Number 13, he'd had plenty of experience not talking. Books were a sign of being educated. One of the only things allowed. They let his 'flights of fancy' fly free, let his imagination run wild, let his mind be challenged. He was almost fluent in both Latin and French as well as English. His goal was to learn Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian by the time he was 25.
“Okay...cool beans! I’ll see you in a bit!” Martha propped a smile up and headed to their room. “Hey Mia! I love your hair, how do you get it so thick?”
...” he listed and let out a large snort at Potter’s expression.
Once upon a time there lived a princess in a tower, who had long, flowing blonde hair. An evil witch had kidnapped her as a baby and had cut her off from the outside word, trapping her for forever, and using the princess’ magic hair to fuel her immortality.
He placed the rest of the potions on a table before charming the entrances to the common room from the dorms closed with ropes so no young ones would come in and distract him.
“Um...okay...then...”
“You said you weren’t THAT blind, so just get them. They’re right in front of you.” Draco continued to wear them. Potter reached around the floor for them for a second before moving towards Draco.
“I think we have Defense Against the dark Arts.” Pansy answered. Draco jolted.
"Oh, mine are gorgeous! They're a lovely pale pink colour, with frills and sparkles. It goes splendidly with my hair and complexion! But I'm considering getting my hair cut again, before the event where we wear our dress robes. What do you think I'd look best with Greg? A short bob, a pixie cut, or really long hair?" Greg bumbled over his next words.
Lucius had originally been meaning to send him to Durmstrang, but since Narcissa's accident, had wanted the boy closer to home in case something were to happen. Draco was perfectly okay with this. He heard Durmstrang had a terrible Muggle Studies course. Although he wouldn't have minded learning how to perform Dark Magic. At Hogwarts they only supervised Defense Against the Dark Arts. He supposed with the libraries extensive information on the topic he could learn how to do it on his own time.
"Pouvons-nous faire quelque chose pour vous aider?" Octavia added in, tripping over a couple of her words.
After about five minutes of delicious food, I heard some shuffling chairs to the side of me. I looked over and saw Luna and Neville sitting by me, Luna being the closest.
“Of-of course.”
“Don’t apologise. Because then I’ll feel compelled to forgive you. I’m not going to go running to a teacher about what happened, but I’m going to put to situation in our back pocket. I’m not going to forgive, or let it go, but I am letting it slide for a while. So put away that pout before it comes with a matching pair of puppy dog eyes.” He immediately stopped his pouting, unaware he was.
These were looked down upon by many pureblood students, though they soon became interested as the siblings introduced more items they were sent. A pack of incredibly detailed and intricate tarot cards, fake blood, ‘magic tricks’ that
“Ew, Pans, don’t encourage him. His muffling charm is shit and I don’t want to listen to that when I’m trying to sleep,” Draco told her with a smirk, pleased that he’d finally gotten a genuinely embarrassed reaction from Blaise as Pansy howled with laughter.
“Oo...wee...jee?” Vince sounded it out slowly. The third years all nodded.
“I am NOT drunk.” Draco stuck out his tongue. “I am only a tiny bit sloshed. A little buzzed, tha’s all.” He waved Blaise away.
"Nobody Mother." It's cruel, but there's less of a chance of her having one of her turns if she forgets. So he figured it was for the best.
“We are going to have a sort of ball or dance or an occasion to look pretty. That’ll be fun.” Said Pansy while spell checking her homework.
“How about you act like an upstanding pupil and I don’t punch your teeth in?” She threatened, rolling a sleeve up. “Or would you rather get your teeth curb-stomped?” Potter shuffled away slightly.
“That you’ll forever be hanging onto me and the gang. We all adore you, you know this, but I do want you to have some friends your own age. Also, Blaise is a terrible influence.” She giggled. “He is! He’s disgusting and I’m scared you’re going to learn about things you’re not ready to learn about. You need disgusting over-sharing friends your own age, you know.” She rolls her eyes.
“Give up Aleksander! Drako told me himself s’at he does not care for s’ose who have a death vish. He told me he vishes s’at I stay alive!” The short boy said proudly, and Draco flushed a deeper red.
“Well I wish you weren’t my sister!”
"Wotcha got in here then?" He started rifling through.
“Pretty please.”
"Yes Mother, we were just playing with jam. I was silly and spilled some." He lied. She floated over to him barefoot, stepping in the puddles of blood. She bent down and kissed him on the forehead.
She dog eared a page.
"Come on in."
“It’s not about him, it’s about Potter.” The group all turned to him in confusion. “No! That’s not what I- it’s not- just look!” He stumbled before pressing down on the badge. The yellow badge with red text began to spin before being replaced with the message ‘POTTER STINKS - cheer for Diggory!’ In green text. Pansy let out a cackle.
"Sure, no problem. I am going to be quite busy though, I am taking every subject possible this year, with some extra activities, such as McGonagall's Animagus course." Hermione's eyes lit up.
"Sorry, it's just I've - I've lost my pet toad Trevor, I can't find him. My nan's going to kill me." The boy panicked. The boy had dirty blonde hair and was wearing a brown and green striped jumper. He was fiddling with his hands anxiously and looked to be shy of Draco's presence.
"Should I leave you and the dress
Draco had a better kick off so he had a bit off a head start, but Potter was gaining on him. He tried to cut Potter off momentarily by inching him into the side off the pitch, but Potter manoeuvred around him. Now they were head to head.
“You are banned from reading a book ever again.”
"Don't worry about him guys, he knows this is the closest to sleeping in a room with a girl he's gonna get," Anthony added again. Michael and Anthony shared a laugh, and Terry and Draco followed it awkwardly.
"Stop spreading such lies."
“He’s not my boyfriend!”
"Master Lucius is looking for Master Draco, and has sent Dim to call for him. Master Lucius would like Master Draco to meet him in the third floor drawing room please sir." She saluted.
"Where's you mum?" Harry asked him from behind.
"Draco, how kind of you to meet with me." Lucius Malfoy's voice cut through the quiet. Draco quickly fit his hands behind his back and stood up straight, imagining a pile of books on his head. He would not let one fall.
“Ugh...shite...” he muttered, then looked up in shock. “Sorry for swearing.”
"But...you weren't?"
“Who are you?” He repeated “and what are you doing here?”
Octavia held her head in her hands. “It makes so much sense.” She laments.
Then he was alone to his thoughts.
He’ll push all of those feelings down and lock them in his ‘Never To Be Opened’ drawer and pretend they don’t exist and that will be fine.
"Well, the label isn't too specific, but it says that it's a large, so I'd guess that you're a medium, so you'd need something like..." He ruffled through a nearby rack having spotted something, "this!" He held up a smaller long sleeve green shirt. He shoved it into my chest. "Change into this instead." I took the garment and turned to walk back into the booth.
“But he didn’t curse me!” Potter yelled. Draco continued to flail in the air helplessly.
“What. Happened.” She ordered it out of him.
"It is!"
“Yes yes, of course of course, but Draco there is an issue.” She grimaced fakely. “This will be one of those events that goes on for a couple for days. I will have to leave you here for a bit.”
After that song ended, another one began. Draco danced with Blaise willingly. It was weirdly fun. Even though he had glitter in his hair and the music hurt his ears and he kept nearly slipping on spilled drinks, it was fun.
“Eager though I know all of you will be able to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” Dumbledore continued, “the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an agreed restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age – that is to say, seventeen years or older – will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” – Dumbledore raised his voice slightly for several people had made noises of outrage at these words – “is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the Tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below Sixth and Seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion. I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.”
“It was at the Quidditch Cup. Me and Octavia saw them in the campsite.”
"I don't see the great appeal honestly," Draco mentioned. "I mean, I get that they're attractive and everything, I just don't get why everyone loses their minds around them. It's called self control."
Octavia pointed to their mother, tapped her head and shrugged again.
The students who hadn’t yet returned to their dorms were all collected around one of those tely-visions, many eyes transfixed with wonder onto the screen.
"Erm, I, uh, don't know? And you don't have really long hair?" Pansy sighed impatiently.
With a look of confusion and slight shock still on his face, the boy awkwardly walked over to Sirius to wake him. As he does so, Draco tilts himself, and then casts a cutting spell to the ropes around his legs, trying to be subtle. The boy doesn’t notice.
“Malfoy!”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I-I am s-sorry for m-my st-tupidity Father." The boy stuttered out, bowing his head.
“You admitted that you were earlier!”
Draco had felt on edge since the Quidditch World Cup. And he didn't like it. It felt wrong for him to be this worried all the time, constantly having to know that Octavia's fine and isn't going to be taken to Azkaban because of some thing their father did. And he kept imagining what it'd be like to have the Dark Mark on his arm, the disgusting symbol a dark contrast to his pale skin, so clear, so obvious...
“I’m not sure, I didn’t see him leave. He’s probably in his room, you can talk to him at breakfast.” Blaise nodded as he accepted this before rising to his feet.
[][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][]
"What's a microwave?"
Harry and Draco go back to the common room and discuss things with Luna
Blaise rose a hand. “What are you doing making badges, Drakey?” Draco’s head snapped towards the other boy, who was grinning madly. In his raised hand he was holding up a small yellow badge.
He rolled his eyes and sat down on one of large velvet green chairs that lay in the common room, shooing away the nosy Slytherins. He spotted Amanda Green writing frantically in her large pink fluffy book, a book she dubbed her personal ‘Gossip Column’.
"I hate that noise." He said matter of factly, taking a small step away from the potion. "It's really awful. Can you get it to stop?"
“Oh yeah, please tell some.” Vince asked her. She grinned.
"Octi, Octi, always such a meanie, Octi, Octi, the mean octopus." Draco sang under his breath, causing Octavia to blush brighter.
And another.
“We should do this again...” Draco told him and softly kissed his cheek. Blaise smiled awkwardly.
Wooooo booooyy. So that’s chapter three. I’m sorry if it’s a short bit shorter but I didn’t want to drag it out for an ideal word count. I’m sure the next chapter will be longer and hopefully better. Warning: heavy flirting and dumb teens being dumb teens.
He knew this wouldn’t happen, but his addled mind hoped that it would. It wasn’t like he was getting up anytime soon either.
“I was just thinking about how you put that little mudblood in their place this morning.” Her grin was sharp. “How you taught that scum how much better Purebloods are.”
“-you are absolutely brilliant you are! Now if there’s anything you can do about my hair...”
“Sir had acted stupidly, very stupid Master Malfoy has been.” A gravelly voice muttered beside him. Draco tilted his head from where it rested against the back of the chair towards the house elf.
"Malheureusement non, c'est ma deuxième langue."
When Lucius was teaching Draco about his ancestry, and how all Purebloods must go by the particular codes, Draco had asked this same question. He was subsequently shunned for his insolence and was told not to dwell on flights of fancy such as 'individualism'. He never brought it up again, with his mother or father.
They arrived outside the tent, the noises of the campsite loud and proud. Octavia could hear the Irish singing their anthem and smiled.
"Merlin, it wasn't our idea to waste time having a long chat with a French girl!" Weasley tried arguing before being shut down by Granger.
Now it was time for the icing.
She snorted. “They all do.”
“Wha’s the matter?” He asked and Draco shook his head.
He’d ended up lying in the frost and snow to freeze, and couldn’t bring himself to get back up.
Fuck his shoulder hurt.
It was the morning after the Yule Ball, and all of the Slytherin 4th years had gone a little bit wild with their smuggled hip flasks and hidden bottles of firewhisky. But, in their defence, The Weird Sisters had been playing at the ball, and you couldn’t not party when you were at a party.
Draco priest himself away from Vince and coughs. “Anyway, I wholeheartedly think that you should dance with Greg. 100%. Tear him away from Pansy if you have to! Your costumes are the ones that match anyway!” He tells Vince, encouraging him and feeling like a right Cupid.
Octavia was pretty sure Draco had died three times over from both shame and embarrassment before he went to bed. She wasn’t surprised though.
"I was not stalking you!"
Blaise is on his knees. “Do we really need to yet? I mean, it’s just a little fast-“
"Just a small explanation-"
If he went to the dormitories, then he was usually greeted to the scene of Vince trying to awkwardly flirt to an oblivious Greg, and that was only cute as long as it didn’t get boring.
After a couple more minutes Danny seemed to have gotten over his shock quite well, nearly drifting off at Shelly’s underwater tricks. They eventually all had to return to the dormitories, but not before Octavia tried to memorise the way there for a return journey.
"Nice save."
The week after the Quidditch World Cup was...weird. Narcissa had become quite paranoid and over protective, checking on both of her children every couple of hours to know that they were still in the manor. Octavia tried not to blame her mother, but it was becoming quite suffocating.
“What’s your deal?” She confronted, and his smile fell.
He hummed noncommittally.
“Yes, they are real.”
He yawned quietly and let his head droop onto his shoulder. As his eyelids grew weak his head begin to lean sideways until it hit something soft. He closed his eyes and sighed.
"Can't you believe this Octavia? The Quidditch World Cup! And we get to witness it. Who are you rooting for? I'm definitely rooting for Ireland, their beaters and chasers are just too good to defeat, even with Viktor Krum on the Bulgaria team!" Draco gushed to the younger girl. The boy looked to be about fifteen, with the girl looking to be eleven. She looked quite uninterested in the conversation, having her head stuck in a book.
Draco’s supposed it didn’t matter. He’d decided that he was going to die in the snow anyway. He gotten accustomed to the biting cold on his bare neck. Almost comforting as he associated it with an early demise. It felt easy.
He tried to move closer to whatever he was leaning on to block out the pounding in his head, but that only made the giggling louder. He scowled.
"Thank you Hagrid. I will take them from here." She pulled open the doors wide to reveal what Draco assumed was The Entrance Hall.
“They were okay. I had Transfiguration and then Herbology, it was so-so. I was pretty good at Transfiguration, my match stick was nearly a needle!” She told him happily. He smirked at her.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Well I think he should've gone to Azkaban like the guilty toad he is. Least then we'd know whether to worry or not. If he isn't coming back, I say good riddance!" At that Hermione tsked but didn't add anything in disagreement. I felt oddly like defending Malfoy, but knew if I did then Ron would get mad at me, and Mione would looking at me like a puzzle she needed to solve, and I really can't take any more of that after Sixth year. So instead I shrugged and looked back out the window to the drizzle.
“Hermy-own-ee, she looks very dedicated to her studies. Is she in the library often?” Viktor continued to ask Draco. Draco pursed his lips.
His immediate reaction was to pull his wand out.
“As if
Potter glanced at the cover and blanched. “Uh...plants?”
"I'm a Chaser. I'm pretty fast on a broom and always manage to get the Quaffle through the hoop. I did it one time when I was upside down, and the trajectory was perfect enough to throw the Keeper off and get into the hoop. I always practice Quidditch with my brothers and sister. My sister Diana is a Seeker, and she's the best at it. Her trophy is probably in Hogwarts. She plays professionally now, for the Holyhead Harpies. She plays with us less, so now my younger brother Albert is our Seeker, and he's pretty good at it. My brother's prefer to be Beaters so there's usually an uneven number of Chasers, but it doesn't matter, because I'm still good enough." He said this all in a matter of fact voice. He carried on
"Careful what you wish for Potter, you probably won't be able to handle my full beauty." He posed with his hands above his head like a magazine cover and I started snickering. He turned back to the shelf and began rifling through a set of bottles.
Draco’s hands immediately went to his head and found that his hair was floating above his hand in haphazard locks.
Finally, Hermione was called up. She turned to him with a quick nervous grin before walking up proudly. She sat down and put the hat on her head right away. It took about 10 seconds before the hat yelled out:
"Okay I got first question! What school house do you think you'll be in? I'd like to be in Gryffindor because it sounds like the best. Albus Dumbledore himself was in it!" Hermione shot out.
She looked at him incredulously. "What?"
I laughed. "Yeah I'm doing okay, although I'm being forced to buy a new wardrobe in Hogsmeade by Malfoy here," I answered, gesturing to where Mlafoy was stood awkwardly behind me. Seamus broke the embrace to gape at Malfoy.
"Uh, thanks Potter. I have to say I like your hair as well. It's also a welcome change from the usual birds nest. Very neat and tidy. I guess we've swapped looks, huh?" He gave me a half smile.
"Lets make some fairy cakes." Draco smiled tiredly back. His mother loved making fairy cakes. He did most of the actual baking, and he was thankful it was easy, while she handled the decorations. Even in this state, she still had an incredibly careful hand when applying icing and sprinkles. She always made them look beautiful.
When their lips met it turned out he didn’t have to worry about any of that.
"Well, that and yelling at Barty Crouch while he's blaming you for summoning the Dark Mark, kicking him in the shins, and then running away to save your younger sister. Pretty brave and self sacrificial." Potter put on a thinking face. "One might even say you were acting...Gryffindor." He smirked widely. Draco gagged and shivered in disgust.
"Baddock, Malcolm!"
(See the end of the chapter for
He continued to read.
I took out all my anger and frustration at her. I screamed and shouted at her. I ended it all then and there. I made her cry. I packed my bag the same night and spend the last week of summer at Grimmauld Place, tucked up in my room thinking about everything.
But Draco already knows Potter has that control over him.
If he had to choose anyone to be his wife, it’d be Pansy. He hadn’t really fancied any girls, and an evil little voice in his head told him he was broken because of that.
“I mean, when I’m an over protective little sister, I end up threatening the faculty, so you probably have a better approach.” He let out a bark of laughter at that.
“Yes, well it’s not a bad trade for the Triwizard Tournament,” said Blaise, leaning back on the sofa, his head on Pansy’s lap and her using it as a bookrest.
“I have only just turned sixteen, so I am not el-ee-gee-ble yet. I vish I vas. S’e goblet is a great honour.” He looked ashamed.
During the day the first years had also borrowed (stolen) a ‘tele-vish-on’ to watch ‘movies’ on.
. “Where the fuck is his office? I will curse him to Merlin-damned AZKABAN!”
“Well for one, he’s over on the dance floor basically grinding against Amanda Green!” Blaise exclaimed while pointing into the crowd. Draco could just about make out the forms of Nott and Green and frowned.
The effect was ethereal.
“People have been using the word for decades, why put up a fuss now?” Draco asked, growing a tad bewildered with Granger’s behaviour.
And Draco was made of no such metal.
“How could I ever forget how much you have done for me? You’re practically a mother to me.”
* mwah mwah mwah *
He looked around the room and saw Octavia, Martha and another little demon friend. They were the gigglers. Draco clutched his head and groaned.
A second player zoomed out.
Potter pulled a hand through his hair distractingly. “Um, I don’t really need anything. It’s fine, honestly.”
Potter cocked an eyebrow. “What about him?”
She’d known him since they were both five years old. Her mother was making connections with the family and Pansy simply had to come with her to Malfoy Manor. Draco had shown Pansy his room, proudly boasting about his toys and his new plastic broom, and then he played dress up with her.
“That’s not- we’re not- it’s only a truce!” He defended clumsily before being hushed by Madame Pince. He hunched his shoulders. He’d die if he was ever banned from the library. “We’re not exactly friends, we just have a truce. We’re really, or, we were rivals.” He explained to Viktor. Viktor smiled.
So really, Draco absolutely does not have a crush on that speccy, green eyed, messy haired tosser! And he will never have a crush on him!
“And with that I am done with you. I am going to bed.” He told them tiredly.
second of all, id like to say that i am working on the next chapter, my life just fell apart for a month and i had super bad writers block. im not as into the drarry fandom as i was but i still love this fic and wont give up because it's so fun to write
It doesn't look like me!
After gagging in disgust she composed herself a bit. “Did I sleep in my makeup?” She asked tiredly.
The all collapsed at the Slytherin table and Draco immediately hid his face in his arms.
Otherwise here’s some drarry angst and Draco being messy and unloved and I’m gonna cry again
Thankfully he stopped pretty soon, just looking angrily at the lake while sat on the dock. Octavia tread purposefully on the wood, being sure that her shoes made noise to alert him of her presence.
“On’y jus’ hatched,” Hagrid told them, “so yeh’ll be able ter raise ‘em yer selves! Thought we’d make a bit of a project of it!” He seemed quite excited about them, which spurred Draco’s curiosity.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ugh, why is it so cold," he whined pathetically. I poked him with my foot from the other side of the sofa.
"It'll be fine. Right Malfoy?" Draco gave a nod. "See? I'll be back in a sec."
The next morning was...odd, one could say. As Octavia and Danny glued themselves to Martha when they entered the common room, greeted to the site of about a hundred older Slytherins scattered around. The site that caught her attention the most however was of course, her brother.
She wished.
I hope you’re coping well, and I hope you have a fab day xxxx
“That’s how they get you. First it’s minor favours, next second you’re working as a house elf for the Slytherin dorms.” She joked. He laughed.
“I’m not Draco Malfoy!” Draco interrupted spitefully. Sirius rolled his eyes.
“Good book then?” Potter interrupted his reading. Draco looked back up again and nodded. “Because you haven’t turned the page in five minutes.” Draco tried to hold back his flush.
And that was okay.
“There! Now you’re fierce and scary!” She presented Octavia with a mirror. It was then that something occurred to the vampire.
"Children!" Lucius intervened after he was done throwing playground insults at father Weasley. "Enough!" They acquiesced again and both slumped back in their seats in unison.
Granger
Blaise was getting into it, now doing some more jagged and off movements, as he obviously grappled with doing what Moody was making him and what he wanted to. Eventually he was forced to resort back to dramatic stage dancing with a reluctant frown on his face.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! Leave a comment and a kudo and I’ll see in the next one!
“Hey Octi the Octopus, how are you?” He rebutted, and they smiled at each other.
Okay then.
She yawned and began to lay down on his lap, looking up at him. She smiled.
After many twists and turns around the castle, we'd reached the classroom. I sat down on a seat in the back and Neville sat next to me, tucked into the corner. Miss Lou Freebush hadn't noticed us walking in, and kept her back to us while scrawling on the chalkboard.
“I’m not Hermione.” He jerked his head round to look at her. Confusion flashed over his face before recognition.
They left the room deep in conversation, leaving me to pack my school bag alone. I grabbed an inkwell and a quill, some parchment, and the textbooks for the classes I would have that day, before double checking my schedule. DADA for the first two lessons.
"Thank you for your service. Come along Mother, we really should be going home now." He grabbed Narcissa's hand and steered her away from the others.
"I-I'm sorry."
"Via," Draco hissed, "Mother told us to stay in one spot! And we're not going with them!" He gave the trio a side eye.
"Oh yes! I went with Lucius Malfoy and Amy Clover and Abelia Parkinson and Gaston Goyle, and sweet Andromeda and Bellatrix. Bella always had the funniest jokes. You've met your Aunty Andy and Aunt Bella haven't you?" He hadn't. Andromeda Black was considered a blood traitor and Bellatrix Lestrange was a convicted criminal who had been stuck in Azkaban since before Draco could crawl.
“Haha...ha...he....”
“What happened to your dreadlocks?” Draco asked, pointing to where one seemed to be heavily frayed and ripped. Blaise (
So when she found out that not only was he smart, he was confident, funny and sensitive. It only made sense that she developed a crush on him.
“They’re very close. Why do you want to know?” He hoped his question didn’t seem possessive. He’d die if he ever came off that way. Viktor blushed again.
“So that’s a mermaid?” Danny asked after a minute of the mermaid and the children staring at each other. “Mermaids are real? Okay then. That’s cool. That’s totally cool I’m totally fine. Totally. I am handling this so well.” His voice began to raise.
“I’m sorry Harry, but I’m going to have to wait until tomorrow to answer your questions. I am tired and frankly done with this little shit,” he gestured to said little shit in the chair,” for at least tonight.” Harry nodded sadly. “Now I’m going to sleep down here tonight. To make sure he doesn’t get away.”
You can keep your bowlers black,
“You’re such a nerd.” She let him drop and he caught himself by the back of his hands.
“Sorry girls, I’ll do your makeup in a bit, first I have to help my best friend ‘Tavia with hers.” Martha grinned at her, and Octavia beamed in response.
"What an arse." Octavia said plainly.
"Well Snape is kind of a jerk..." Hermione shot him her look. "But! But we shouldn't do anything rash until we've had more lessons with him. We can't properly judge a character based on two hours with them, it isn't a fair test. Maybe he just had a bad day?" Draco shrugged.
"Ditto."
“Wait, you know you have a crush on Greg?” Draco asked the fearful boy. Vince nodded slowly. “And you haven’t acted on it?”
“How’d the fuck he do that?” A second year Hufflepuff broke through the quiet loudly, waking the teacher’s table, and starting the whispers that spread throughout the hall. The volume was an odd hushed sound that made Octavia feel uncomfortable.
“Why aren’t you in Gryffindor celebrating you victory as youngest champion in history?” Draco taunted slightly. Potter’s face closed up.
“Nah, I’ve been playing cards since I was five. I inherited a really nice set after Grandfather Abraxas kicked the bucket, but I was never supposed to play with them. Decoration only, father said. So I asked the Manor’s portraits to teach me how and forced the house elves to learn how to play too, so I could have some regular practice. I am 80% sure that I accidentally started a gambling night amongst the house elves for who gets which chore to do.” Draco explained while fitting on his other shoe. He took a hand through his hair and looked to Blaise.
He doesn't stop running until he gets to a clearing and sees some tents. He can hear many mothers calling frantically, but then he hears his own.
“Took me a while to piece together, but once it clicks...”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Draco is toning down his assholeness because of Via but he still gets turned into a ferret. Moody straight up abuses Draco in the book though like seriously I’m concerned. There’s no way he got through forced transfiguration and then being tossed around like a sack of potatoes without suffering an injury like damn.
“Let’s talk about you.”
“Draco?” Blaise began, towering over said boy slightly. “Am I sexy?”
“I was joking, Merlin you’re wrapped up tight.” Blaise turned to girls. “Hello ladies! Pansy, you’re looking spicy tonight!” He bounced his eyebrows. Pansy crossed her arms.
"I will be giving you 3 raps to your arm, merciful for your ignorance if you asked me, but for every book that falls off your head, you will be given three more. Do you understand?"
I don’t even know what this is ahsgehusbebdjebehdbejdbe
After all the sorting had finished, McGonagall asked us all to sing the Hogwarts song to bring out some cheer into to new year and we all stood and yelled it. Dean and Seamus seemed to have managed to perfect saying every other word to what the other was saying, which caught a few laughs at the table at their version of finishing each other sentences. Everyone seemed to glow with mirth a bit after that, and even Amy Gates had managed to crack a wet smile. McGonagall then stood at her podium and announced "Let the feast...begin!" smiling like she'd always wanted to it.
"So Pansy, what do your dress robes look like?" Octavia asked. The girl brightened up immediately.
"Oh Brother, how far you have fallen. Once a great Malfoy, now nothing but a poster thief." Octavia narrated dramatically, causing Weasley to wheeze harder.
"What's your position?"
“And why should I tell you, small fry?” A rough voice came from the intruder. They tried to fidget in their binds, but the spell only tightened.
Draco exited the bathroom, the ‘bruise’ looking faded and more unnoticeable, trying to find his missing shoe.
“Wotser’ password?” Draco asked Blaise. Blaise would know. Blaise was helpful.
Martha waved her off. “Nonsense, now walk me through your costume. What are you going for?”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Introducing my Ravenclaw bois and giving more information on Terry. Also adding some Ravenclaw dormitory info.
Draco nodded. "Father was angrier than ever and the Manor was quieter than ever. I just focused on my books. And look how much luck that did me." He added bitterly.
"What do you mean you don't deserve gifts?" Draco got many gifts at Christmas and Birthdays. But over the years it had evolved from toys and sweets to purely books. Father knew what Draco liked, so what's the point in spending more time looking for gifts when books to study will do just as well? Last Christmas he'd gotten a butterfly in a jar from his mother. He didn't question how she did it, but knew he had to set it free as soon as possible. By Boxing Day the butterfly had died in the jar and Draco had a funeral for it in the grounds later that day. His birthday gift was a book of bedtime stories he'd left in the kitchen. She'd picked it up and re-gifted it to him obliviously. He was just thankful it wasn't another animal in a jar.
“Well it certainly isn’t my fault I have a sister so dull that-“
He wraps his arms around the larger boy and holds him. He’s still not super used to hugs and affection and whatnot, but it’s worth it when Vince calms down. Draco pats him back.
But things were a bit better. They were fine.
“Yeah I’m fine. Just a bit stressed about uh, Potions homework. Haven’t done it yet, and you know how much of a stickler Snape can be.” He’s convincing so she goes along with it. Shen tucks away the scene she witnessed in the back of her head.
“Hi Malfoy.” The surprise greeting made him jump, and he glared to where the voice came from.
"Oh, here's one!" He opened up the door and began piling in his luggage. Harry started of with his owl, which Draco just had to comment on. "She's a beautiful owl."
“So wouldn’t you be far more grown up now?” She batted her eyelashes. “And mature?” She drew circles on his arm with one manicured nail.
“Okay, okay, jeez. We’re still on for that duet though, right? I gotta know so I can let Leo know to charm a song onto the black screen.”
"NO HE WASN'T! He wasn't...he wasn't flirting with me! He was being annoying. An annoying git. He wouldn't stop talking to me and kept trying to reccomend food when I was already eating something. He tried to ask about the rides we'd been on and he wouldn't leave us alone!"
Thanks you so much for reading! If you enjoyed, please drop a kudo, bookmark, or subscribe so you can keep track of my terrible update schedule 😅
“What a wannabe Slytherin you are.” Draco mocked. “Fine, how can I repay you immediately?”
"Krum." He said quietly.
Potter lay his hand gently on Draco’s face, cupping his cheeks softly. Draco blinked through the blur dumbly as the boy caressed one cheek with a calloused thumb
"They didn't have anything to do with it! Let them go!" Potter's voice rings out and it's the last thing he hears before he gets to a silent part of the wood. He doesn't stop running. He needs to get them both back to Narcissa and out of this mess.
“So you’d say that you two are on good terms?” Octavia asked after a moment to collect herself.
The way to go that Draco always thought about was jumping off his broom. He’d take it onto the quidditch field at night, fly it high into the clouds, and then he’d fall off. He thinks that’d be a nice way to go, to get to fly one last time. If he fell back first then that meant that the last thing he’d see would be a starry sky at Hogwarts.
“Wow, thanks Greg! This is great!” She gave him a quick hug. He looked elated.
“You’re disgusting. Now show me how to use the hair curler.”
Pansy crossed her arms. “Don’t raise your eyebrow at me like that, you look like Draco. Disturbingly so. And yes, I am a cat, a black cat. Very unlucky.” She jokingly winked at Greg, highlighting her black eyeliner and sparkling eye shadow. Greg grinned.
“AND I NEED YOU NOW TONIGHT!” Draco joined in.
“I-I never said that!” Weasley protested, and Granger snorted. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“It’s Draco. As aware as he can be of others, he is the most oblivious about himself. His lack of self awareness knows no bounds. Unless he’s brooding and being too tough on himself.” He pouts and crosses his arms in an imitation of Draco. Octavia snorts.
Draco opened a roll of parchment and wrote in the nicest calligraphy he could manage:
“Why did this go so wrong so quickly.” Potter mutters to himself, his head in his hands.
“Do you still have that Viktor Krum poster?” He flushed.
“Language.” Blaise grimaced. “Ew sorry for that, Draco is affecting me. And yes, as far as my gaydar can tell, there is definitely a Potter thing going on.”
At the wedding the next day Gale crashes it, and reveals the spell he cast. He claims that out of spite he took away both of their magic , and that they could no longer use a wand. They presented all the spells they knew for the audience while holding their wands and it appeared to be true. Since they were now squibs, the Wizarding community denounced them and exiled them to live among muggles.
“I still hate him Drakey. The way he killed that spider right in front of us!” He raised an eyebrow at Pansy. “Oh, and he turned you into a ferret.” Draco rolled his eyes and took a sugar quill out of his pocket.
As they entered the room, they took in the pure theme of it. It was full of festivities that morning, but now it was on full power.
before slumping in his seat and crossing his arms. The three weirdos were still staring at them, so she turned around to face them head on.
“What?”
“Malfoy, I have a proposition for you.” Potter interrupts his thoughts and if only Blaise could of heard him say that.
“Just shut up! Fine, you got me, tonight I hung out on the Quidditch pitch with someone. It was a boy, shut up Blaise, and there was no romantic involvement.” Draco admits, crossing his arms and attempting to become one with the chair.
“Draco, we’re rich.” Octavia stated.
“I thought it was nice.” She argued, but she didn’t really. It wasn’t really much of anything. It was just two mouths. But she was grown up now and grown ups did it all the time.
He picked up the quill.
The next day was buzzing with an energy Draco could hardly stand. Since it was a Saturday and he finally had enough time to laze about, he was planning on lying in bed and hardly moving. To spend the day relaxing. Greg and Vince refused. They teared apart his curtains at a far too early time and practically demanded that he accompany them to breakfast, where they were going to watch people put their names in the goblet.
“And another thing,” Draco whispered in Blaise’s, nibbling on it slightly to tease him. Blaise’s shoulders tensed up.
"Language!" Draco yelled at her over Weasley's laughter.
Harry looked ready to talk again.
The picture movie was called ‘Scooby Doo on Zombie Island’ and had a talking dog. It was really weird, and Potter was getting oddly invested in the drawings. For all he knew about the tely-vision, he didn’t seem to have used it that much.
Octavia looked to the side to see her father facing off with the father of that ginger family, the Weasleys. She then let her gaze travel to the famiy, which included the people she saw earlier that day. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. All three seemed to be staring at the siblings in varying levels on confusion, Potter looking especially weirded out.
He tried to coax Draco out of his hideaway space, and with unfortunate success. Potter lead him out from his enclosure and into the main body of the library with the desks. Where Granger was.
It is cubbently 3 in da mornin becos YOLOOOO. I hate meself too dont worry I apologese. Yoooo I am writin the nex chapter of Double Trouble I am soooo sorry it has been a tuff month for me. Enjoy!
He always put her first, since the beginning. Back then it was probably because Narcissa had told him to be nice to a guest, but since that first encounter Draco had always put Pansy’s needs first.
. Better listen to him Blaise.” She played the part and sat down right next to Draco, one leg over his lap. If Octavia didn’t know any better than she’d almost believe they were really dating.
“Makes sense.” She turned back to Potter with narrowed eyes. “Since you’re here, you better no go crying about our party to Dumbledore. If I hear you squealed one word, I will hex your face so hard no one will ever be able to recognise you!” She gave him a small once over. “Then again, I might be doing you a favour.”
Vince cocked his head. “How does what make me feel?”
“Why?”
’.” He used quotation marks. “But since she loves Potter so much she lent her services.” He took the badge back and inspected it. “I’ve just got to secure the charm work and test all of them before I can start selling them.” At Octavia’s look he shrugged. “Gotta make a profit.”
“As long as you actually get some sleep instead of studying or reading those trashy smutty novels of yours.”
He was pulled away from looking at Potter via a tug on his sleeve from Pansy. He focused on some parchment instead. The lesson continued in relative silence until the bell rang.
"Well, with feet that size, hard not to," he commented, calling himself to attention, though he feared giving a piggy back to Via may have ruined the effect.
"Night Potter."
“Of course. I’ll do my best. I’m sure we’ll make you look great.” Greg smiled thankfully.
"Ah, a little late to be getting your wand for school now, isn't it?" The man himself asked. Octavia grinned sheepishly. "Oh, no matter. As long as you get it before school begins."
"You still haven't explained this to me, what is a film?" Malfoy asked confusedly, gathering our empty mugs to put in the kitchen sink.
"Okay Malfoy, let's talk." Potter said, shocking everyone in the cart.
"C'mon Terry, the cauldron's stopped sizzling." Draco tried to comfort the forlorn boy. Terry nodded along and they both got back to work.
"Just breath Potter, focus on your breathing. I want you to try an breath in for two seconds, and out for two seconds. After that try three. Just keep a steady pace. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth, like this," he demonstrated for me, his voice even and calm, his touch soft like I was a china doll. So I focus on breathing. I tentatively put m hand on his heart in an attempt to mimic his heartbeat, and he thankfully doesn't react to it, other than a flicker of his eyebrow. His mantra about breathing continues in the back of my head as I start to come back to the room. As soon as my breathing resumes normally, I turn to him awkwardly.
Octavia would love to say that she didn’t bask in the attention, but, well, she did. All these people focused on HER. At first she figured it was because of her brother, but it was because of herself! According to one sixth year Macy Lacefield, her magic was worthy a pureblood Malfoy.
"My parents were always dead set on Hogwarts because they wanted me to become a Slytherin as they had, and the other schools have different houses. Wanted to live out their nostalgia through me I guess." Pansy said, pouting and crossing her arms. Octavia patted her shoulder pityingly while leaning against Greg.
From across the hall, he saw Hermione as she collected her schedule from Professor McGonagall, her large hair being a beacon and a half. They made eye contact. He froze.
Terry and Anthony both had owls go to them. Anthony received a letter from an owl that flew off as soon as it was delivered, while Terry got a small sack full of letters and a clingy owl that immediately stole a sausage off his plate.
“Don’t cross Auntie again Draco, you got off easily.” Draco bit his tongue to avoid crying. She loves me, she loves me, she loves me really. “Goodnight my little Death Eater in training.” She pat his head and got up, leaving him in a haphazard pile on the floor. “Auntie knows best!” She cawed joyfully as she exited the room, with a skip in her step, and Draco nearly threw up.
"I think my parents only ever planned to send me to Hogwarts, but of course if I misbehaved there were the usual threats of sending me off to Mahoutokoro or Ilvermorny or Uagadou," Vince grimaced. "I can't imagine going that far from home."
“Come on boys, let’s go see the goblet.” He switched round and exited, calling the boys to follow him.
"Oh shut it you!"
snort at the name. He flushed brighter.
“Of course I will Auntie. I wish you luck with catching Harry Potter.” Aunt Bella squealed in excitement.
* Billie Jean - Michael Jackson
“Ah, shit!” Harry exclaimed quietly as the cat scratched him to get out of his hold. “Worse than Crookshanks.” He muttered.
"Because he's a biased oppressor!" Anthony said, slamming a book down on the table to make more noise, calling them to the attention of more Ravenclaws
“Who kidnapped you?”
Draco pulled away in confusion.
He really
"So am I! I can't wait for the first lesson, though I'm not looking forward to keeping a mandrake leaf in my mouth for an entire month." She grimaced.
"Mini Malfoy's going off the Hogwarts this year?" One of the Weasley-boy-(possibly-twins) asked her. She scowled.
The night before the wedding, Gale managed to sneak Rowan out of his home onto a La Rochelle dock. In the moonlight besides the sea was where Gale Proposed to Rowan, promising his heart and magic if he would take it. Rowan did. And so Gale cast the spell onto the both of them, bonding their hearts and their magic forever.
"So, when did you two become friends?"
He was going to break eye contact, really he was, but then he just...didn’t.
“I’m not of age. I’m only in fourth year, and even if I was old enough, I wouldn’t try and compete. I don’t particularly feel like dying.”
"Oh I do love ice cream! What flavour would you like?" She snatched the pouch excitedly. One of her more childlike times then.
The blurry figure came closer and put what I assumed were my glasses in my clammy hands. I shoved them on my face to then glare at the smirking face of Draco bloody Malfoy. He was already dressed and had washed out the black hair dye, his hair back to his 'natural' platinum blonde.
At lunch they met up with Michael once again at the Ravenclaw table.
“Sure. When it’s with homework or quidditch. But you’d not actually hang out with them without the group to coddle your inept social abilities.” Blaise put a finger over Draco’s mouth to shush his protests. “They were almost like your bodyguards for so long and now that you’ve given them time to become themselves, you aren’t friends. You haven’t tried to get to know Greg and Vince instead of ‘Crabbe and Goyle’, and they’re trying!” Blaise continues to shush him. “You never have time for them outside of tutoring, but now that I’m going to be helping your with that, I expect you to be nice to our boys.” He pulled out the extremely sad face. “Do it for the children.” He began to whisper. “Do it for lil Octi.”
“Hush now Draco, let the boy speak.” Pansy tugged Potter towards her with her surprising strength and looped their arms, trapping them on either side.
Draco stared miserably at the Viktor Krum poster he’d stuck to the wall inside his curtained over bed. He lay on his stomach and hugged a pillow while looking sadly into Viktor Krum’s dark and mysterious eyes. It somehow failed to make him feel better.
Her eyes washed over the great hall, trying to find anything of interest. She saw Greg and Vince walk in from the Slytherin common room, surprising because she figured that they’d be with Draco. They looked happier than usual, and seemed to be walking a bit closer to each other. Happy looked better on both of them, far better at least than their bodyguard scowls. They looked normal. Octavia was pleased.
Draco is in denial
“Are we ready to do this?” He asked. Martha nodded. Octavia pursed her lips.
I hope you enjoyed that a whole lot! I have another one shot in the works already so that may come out within the next week if my double trouble is still on a break.
"That's enough, Draco," A sharp voice interrupted the boys recitation. The boy stopped his pacing back and forth. Lucius stood up swiftly his robes falling to the ground in dramatic fashion, a cane in one hand. He moved towards the boy, towering over him as he circled.
“Just help me look scary.”
For starters, the protagonist in question was more of a
Draco picks up his wand, satchel and Octavia, and tries to take another runner. He needs to get them both the HELL out of there.
“Goodnight.” He sighed and rested his face on Blaise’s ever so broad chest. Blaise froze up.
“If you even recognise me! The transformation from before and after will be drastic!”
He had a large smile. "Wasn't that amazing?!" Draco smiled back. It was relatively tame magic but for someone of Harry's upbringing, he could understand the excitement.
'Dad is acting crazy'.
We fell into an easy silence. Luna took her knitting needles out of her bun and set about making something new, maybe another beanie? Malfoy turned towards the fireplace and began shooting colour charms at it, getting use out of his wand again. The charms grew more complex, only making one side of the fireplace one colour, letting the colour spread along it slowly, or cycling through a set of colours, like Luna's hair dye would supposedly do. He filled the fire with stripes and dots of colour, changing the logs and the flames, sdding shapes for the fire to take.
She shrugged. “Mere curiosity, I suppose.” Now Draco didn’t trust that for a minute, but he accepted it and miserably ate his sandwich.
“I always knew you were secretly a drunk.”
"Not a chance Potter, you haven't earned it."
Sirius sent a body bind hex towards Draco and for the second time in twenty four hours, Draco collapsed to the floor helplessly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Not like she was trying that hard anyway...
He was also trapped for all of his life! But not in a tower...and his hair wasn’t magic...he was instead?
“I mean, I guess he’s teaching us something. Regardless, using the Cruciatus in front of Longbottom and the Killing Curse in front of...well, you, probably isn’t a thing he should put on his next resume. Or the fact that he has a habit of turning teenagers into ferrets. Not the best teacher we’ve ever had, in my book at least. Even that werewolf was better...” he began to put his broom away before Potter put a hand on his arm.
"That then brings us to the fact that after Sirius Black died, you inherited the Black family fortune, who I believe were the richest of the Scared Twenty Eight. I would have inherited it, because my mother was Narcissa Malfoy née Black, but Sirius left it to you. The Blacks stole, they blackmarketed, they Muggle-baited, they manipulated, and they lied. So by pureblood terms, means that they were incredibly wealthy, possibly more so than the Malfoys.
"Has that creep Tom Vicars been harassing you again? I can take care of him if you'd like." Luna giggled at this.
He sniffled loudly. “Okay then, right-wait, he’s having a ‘moment’? What spurred that on?”
“Ew.” They both said in unison. Draco shivered and turned to Pansy.
“Mmm-Malfoy...” the other boy seemed to complain in his sleep.
"I'm proud to say we were. The immaculate presentation we maintained in the public eye was strangling, so when we had time to ourselves we could really let loose. Our truth or dare games could include stolen Vetiserum from Snape, there were many heists to steal alcohol from the kitchens so that we cold drown our sorrows or celebrate victory. The gossip and the blackmail was always fresh and ready on a silver platter thanks to Pansy, and we had unlimited access to the darkest hexes we wanted thanks to our Mansion's libraries." He said all this with a wistful look in his eye. Wow. I have to admit, I never really imagined much at all going on in the Slytherin dormitories. I thought they just studied or made evil schemes and plots together. I could never have imagined them playing something like truth or dare together, or gossiping away about trivial things.
“Snow snakes.” Blaise said, and they were allowed into the common room.
This is why it felt like a cold slap to the face when she finally didn’t win.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, about 20 ghosts streamed through the wall and the children. He heard yells and screams, one coming from Neville, but couldn't but watch the transparent figures in fascination.
Oh drat.
“Drakey!” To the left of him, Pansy called to him. When he looked at her, she smirked and put one hand on her waist, the other hand gesturing for him to come towards her. He did so.
“I mean, at least he has a more open look to experimenting with dark magic? It is a large field that Hogwarts doesn’t even try to elaborate on.” Blaise pointed out to try soften Draco’s scowl.
“That’s because you’re straight.”
“I was wondering if your beautiful self could pick up the alcohol.” He booped Draco’s nose. He scrunched it uncomfortably. “Just from the kitchens. The bottles will be laid out on a table with the label ‘for Blaise Zabini’. You can’t miss it.”
I walked through the door and a little bell jingled above me. I looked around the shop to take the small space in.
"Drakey, I distinctly remember it looking exactly like that. When we were younger it was the second worst hair next to Goyle's."
"It's been okay. I went to see the World Cup, and Via's joining us at Hogwarts this year..."
"Hi Draco. That was pretty cool, what you did in there." He complimented.
Sirius sighed and held his nose again, hissing as he realised it was probably broken and had begun to bleed again. Stupid fucking kid.
Moody then asked the class about the Unforgivables. Or, at least Draco knew he was talking about the Unforgivables. Little others seemed to catch on.
Draco was running around frantically, spelling up paper cut outs and decorations to every corner, wall, and in between. Pansy was leisurely setting up a snacks table, but she harshly batted away Blaise’s hand as he reached for something.
"Yes, well, Disney employees flirting with Draco aside, it really was a nice day out. Draco really passed for a muggle. We didn't get to see the fireworks they said would be there, because we had to be back by sundown, but I promised we would let some go this year, maybe Christmas." I grinned at her.
“Oh come on, please?” Potter begged and Draco let out an undignified snort.
“I will be wasting the rest of my day with my books. Whoever thought socialising was a good idea has clearly never experienced a bad Saturday.”
He started snickering at my bright red face.
Draco leant against Blaise a bit and giggled. He might have been a tad drunk. Okay, a lot drunk, but in his defence; he was sure his vodka had been spiked.
“Let’s play a different game.” He’d suggested, and they’d swiftly moved on to Kiss, Marry, Kill. He’d held her tightly though, and had stroked her hair. He hoped the message was clear.
“Gross.”
Other people’s chatter and the noise of the film slowly became nothing but static and he leaned into whatever was on his left further.
“Well I am grown up!” Pansy sniffed. “Mother says I’m growing up to become a lovely young lady. And lovely young ladies deserve nice boyfriends. And you’re nice.” She poked him on the arm. He stuck out his tongue.
In the hallway I could see Dean and Seamus, Seamus who was wearing a suspiciously large maroon shirt which was slipping off of his shoulder, and Dean who was looking at him with adoration yet amusement. They seemed to have both only just woken up, Seamus leaning on Dean's tall frame in order to stop him from falling over from exhaustion and both looking like they were still wearing pajama bottoms.
“First of all, don’t say those things around Octavia! Second of all, what do you mean by that?”
Margaux however, stayed beside him and lay a hand on his shoulder.
“Terrifying?”
“Just because they’re not very pretty, doesn’t mean they’re not useful.” Granger told him crossly.
"W-what, r-r-really?" Draco asked. That wasn't control, he was going to drop the desk!
He ignored the decorations in the common room and fled straight to his dorm and collapsed on his bed.
“God, I can’t tell whether you’re acting like an old lady or an old man. Either way, your morning bitchiness is showing.” Via told him off.
“A Veela, yes.” Octavia finished. Pansy squealed.
"Really? And muggles have been developing this for the last century or so? Incredible! If only the wizarding world were more open to adapting, we could really evolve faster than ever! This technology could fly past better, right down to revolutionary!"
I was beginning to fear their shared intelligence and cunning, and I could tell that Ron felt the same way as he hastily changed the subject.
He was through.
"I guess it is, but focus on the game, mate. Lynch is back up!"
“No one deserves to live in Grimmauld Place for that long, especially stuck and being raised by a batshit Bellatrix.” He said gravely. Draco fumed.
Draco glanced at Hermione who smiled at him. He would've used the technique his charms teacher did, but she wasn't exactly the nurturing kind. He simply used the teaching advice from a book his substitute tutor had left out one week, The Many Good Ways To Teach A Child Magic. Draco had liked the substitute teacher, Mr Melbourne, he was kind, but Lucius had thought he went too easy on Draco and had gotten his old charms teacher back as soon as possible.
"Quit it with the voice Potter, it sounds freaky!"
“Okay, I won’t tell anyone.” Blaise crossed his heart and Draco nodded again satisfactorily. “You wanna know a secret about me?” He asked.
--------------------------------------------
“Shut up lightweight.” Draco snapped.
Draco remembered what Blaise had told him a while before and leaned against the wall to sink down onto the floor. He pat the space next to him. Vince obediently sat down. “How does that make you feel?”
"I'm autistic." Draco turned to him in surprise. Terry averted eye contact. "High functioning, so you don't need to worry or anything, that anything'll happen. I'm fine, my Mum just wanted there to be a time for McGonagall to check on me in case I'm overwhelmed. She does it for the other autistic kids as well, so we do it as a group." Everything was clicking into place.
“Hello all you pretty young things.” Blaise suddenly burst out of the bathroom walking...backwards? He was wearing the red leather pieces Draco had been forced to transfigure.
"No such thing!"
He hadn’t spoken a word for over 48 hours too. He was usually very talkative, shown especially when he makes an arse of himself. He never knew when to shut up.
“Well you have said that all eyes are on you. I can see why everyone paying attention to you may seem appealing. I wouldn’t mind it.” Draco admitted, checking his nails casually.
"And we're here!" Lucius interrupted the two as they came across the large empty space. He clapped his hands. "Well then, let's get set up!" The case floated down from where it was levitating and Lucius began to pull out one of the outlines for the large tent that was to come. "Well, we can't use magic to set up, but I suppose some extra help won't be of any bother!" And he began to click his fingers, his children rolling their eyes once again. "Libby, Bell, Turnip, Patter, Tog!" And at once five house elves Apparated in front of the family.
"Look, Pansy, I didn't know it would turn out like this! I didn't remember my hair being like this!"
"I-I'm a Chaser, and I'm pretty good at it. I'm quite fast on a broom and always manage to get the Quaffle through the hoop. I did it one time when I was upside down, and -" He carried on rambling to Anthony in a similar fashion to when he did to Draco. Getting to talk about this seemed to make him so happy, and Anthony gave him his full attention.
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
“For your information, I do not read these romance novels for the sex, I read them for the romance.”
They both mounted their brooms in unison.
"Blaise, I highly doubt they'd have a task that could utilise your only skill, being a massive flirt and pervert!" Draco told him.
The kid tried another spinning kick before Sirius caught the foot mid air, tugged the kid’s leg towards him and cast a sleeping charm, watching as the once confident boy tottered around slightly before falling unconscious.
“...no.”

“If you’d please come to the dining room I am serving soup.” Kreacher bowed. Aunt Bella nodded.
"You shall keep up with your studies, be the best flyer in your year, the top of your class. You shall continue studying your languages and dark magic. There is still time to save you and put you onto a better path than this. Make powerful allies, stay away from Mudbloods, and write to your mother regularly. She has been...unmanageable since you left." His voice softened when he mentioned his wife. "Take the tutoring lessons in charms. Even if it is done by a half-breed, you do need to improve drastically. Oh, and Draco?" Draco rubbed at his teary eyes with the back of his hand. "The only reason you'll be allowed back to the manor come the holidays is for your mother's sake. If she does need you however, you will stay at Hogwarts and receive no gifts. Don't disappoint me again, or there will be consequences. One step out of line and you are off to Mahoutokoro School of Magic until Seventh year." Draco flinched again. He made a mental note to pick up a bit of Japanese. Just in case.
"Yep, them three. Why are they here?"

"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has it's own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn you house points, while your rule breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours." Draco hoped so too.
They both gave her hair a ruffle as they walked past to sit down, and Octavia allowed it more graciously, giving them both a younger sister smile.
"How about we pick out some dress robes instead of you going on and on about your crush on your precious Potter?" Draco went pink and spluttered for a moment before just picking out some items.
“But you’re my Drakey-poo!”
"O-o-oh no, I-I'm s-s-so s-s-sorry, I just, I-I-I w-was tr-trying to levit-tate th-the feather a-and I l-lost control I-I'm s-s-so s-so s-sorry I-" Draco stuttered out in fear. Only second lesson and he was already a failure, was what he going to-
Then, one by one, Moody began to cast the curse on students. By the uneasy looks their professor was getting, Draco was glad he wasn’t the only dubious.
"Makes you look like a runner bean. You're far too tall, you realise that?"
Vince nodded again. “What I was planning to do was crush my feelings down and let them wither over time.” He described. Draco looked at Vince with horror.
“We’re just asking the Baron some questions!” A little blonde third year piped up. Draco raised an eyebrow expertly.
It's then that Octavia heard Draco mutter, "Mad Eye Moody," fearfully. She gave him a questioning look and he gulped. "A retired Auror. Kind of famous and infamous at the same time. Put a great deal of people in Azkaban, but made a lot of enemies. Became incredibly paranoid. I saw him once when I was younger. He was set to...investigate Father. Someone had reported some suspicious actions. He came to the Manor and nearly turned Father's office upside down. You were just a baby at the time. Scared me to death, but I was only four. He didn't find anything." As he whispered this, his eyes never left Mad Eye's movement. The man had sat down at the teacher's table and it's then that Octavia realised...
“Better not be fucking permanent.” He muttered.
The first volunteer was Weasley, who talked about the Imperius curse. Draco felt a faint tint of annoyance, at Weasley’s easiness in mentioning an Unforgivable. If many of the Slytherins were to mention on, they’d immediately be suspicious. Except perhaps, Katy Turncoat. She was Muggle-Born.
