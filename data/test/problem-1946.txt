Soon she saw Draco, with closed eyes, and brushed against his face with hers. At least the Slytherins gave each other enough space to breath and didn't lay blankets over each other. She rubbed against him again, and this time his gray eyes opened and felt the area she had touched. His hand froze when he saw the caracal's wide black pupils, and the little candle light flickering in her eyes. She was glad that he didn't make a noise, that he understood, as he stared into her cat eyes, what she wanted. Draco put his blanket and pillow by another boy and turned into a ferret. She crept along the wall, missing feet and heads, and made out the outline of Ginny and Luna waiting for her at the door. She pushed the door open with her weight, letting Luna climb over her, Ginny fly over her, and Draco scramble in from under her belly. They went as animals, and didn't stop till Harmony pushed open an empty class room. She changed into a girl, and her heart slowed back to that of a human's heart rate. At first she couldn't look at Draco, as she thought of what she was about to tell him.
The girl opened the door, and though he knew that it was Harmony, she painfully reminded him of another. Behind her came Draco, and he lifted a brow at him. He closed the door. "Professor," Harmony began, "we want to know more about the Dark Lord." Severus looked from the two and the frown persisted.
Draco reached the Medic wing and shifted Potter's weight to one arm while opening the door. "Madam Pomfrey," he called out. A light poured out from under a door and a woman with the official wand and phoenix medical badge came out.
"The Septicemic Plague Curse," Snape deduced unsurprisingly. "Present symptoms are high fever, vomiting, rapid heart rate, and delirium. All he needs is time for the spell to wear off." Harry wouldn't have thought it possible, but Snape did appear to care for him; poor Malfoy indeed. "Crabbe, you may leave now, and Poppy, force him to drink all of the pain killer potions."
"Well, then you can just look at the reactions of people. Take Snape for example. Have you ever noticed that when things went wrong for Harry, Snape tried to protect him." Blaise grinned as he leaned forward, watching Ginny closely.
Harmony's mind wandered, not caring to hear all of Ron's amazing qualities. Something was bothering her, like an itch to the back of her mind. There was something up or something that she was missing out on. Harmony ignored the owl post as it dropped newspapers and mail. But there was something disturbing with the owls. There were too many of them, and they were all frantic. Packages dropped into food and owls screeched in fear. And then they were all gone. The students anxiously looked around the room before unraveling their papers. The absence of chatter was replaced with gasps. Harmony did not have a paper, but Hermione did.
"You know there is a shower room," Draco said, "I was just going to go, but I think that you need this more." He handed her his towel and Harmony looked at him strangely.
"Damn it, just leave me alone." She walked a few steps, before he materialized to her side, placing his hand on her bare shoulder.
"YOU!" Voldemort roared from the back of her throat, like it was a curse. She searched the girl's eyes, not even having to read her mind to piece parts of it together. "How- No. Severus lied to me!"
Harmony drew in a sharp breath before closing her eyes. This could not be happening. Draco stood rigid along the wall, watching the two.
"Excellent, and it has only been the third day of school. There is no need to mask your face here. Anyway, since we are still on the part of protecting, let's go over the protronous charm."
"We will go rent a flat near Diagon Alley, behind that stationary store. You are to be my fictitious friend Nancy Harpy's niece, Harmony Maystone. Poppy will check in on us and maybe Severus. We will learn a lot." She paused a bit at Harmony's pained expression and added "and will have much fun" as an after thought. "Sirius may be allowed to visit as well."
Then the growling began. They pulled apart to see a great black dog baring its teeth, and snapping. Harmony's eyes widened. "Shite. It's OK," she held her hands up to the dog. Draco put his arm in front of the girl and faced the dog, not realizing that was driving Sirius even madder.
"He hasn't killed me yet." Harmony replied with a half smile. If she was in her caracal form, she would be purring, contentedly.
The moment he thought that, he stopped. It was easy to see her and forget who she was. All he had to do was repress the little fact that she was the Dark Lord's enemy, and that she would probably die by his wand. It was all effortless to forget, to forget what he was doing. But it wasn't that simple. Draco clenched his fists tight and forced his body to halt. He felt his mind divided and conflicted. It was impossible to forget.
There were a lot of ridiculous theories floating around when it was discovered that the boy wonder was missing. Not at first of course. It seemed like everyone but him was too busy celebrating to realize that Harry was even gone. But then he was gone for a week, and then two. It was discovered that Potter's things remained in his room. Even his owl was still in the owlery. Letters to those close to the boy couldn't find anything. It was then that the theories began. Perhaps Lady Voldemort was just a decoy and Potter was off vanquishing the real one. Or maybe Harry had gone off riding on the Dark Lord's dragon and had gotten lost. Or eaten. Someone at the ministry had even commissioned a team to track down that beast to find any clues to the boy's disappearance.
"Sure," Draco said and got up. Blaise raised his head from his hand, and gave Draco the thumbs up before smirking. The message was clear, try not to make a fool out of yourself, and Draco put his wand away before grinning back at Harmony. "You ready?" he asked.
"In Dumbledore's possession is a ring that he has destroyed. He told me only that it was yours, but I could tell that he was hiding more." Severus was treading in dangerous water.
"The one that smelled like turnips who got dismembered from a bludger?" Ron leaned forward mouthing the word dismembered.
Ginny looked over at Draco's arm as well, pulling up his sleeve to see the design mirrored there. "Oh wow," she shook her head, "You guys got matching tattoos? Of Dragons? Why? Where?" Ginny demanded.
"Now we need the tears of a dieing pig," Draco pointed to a shelf too high for the girl, and after she pointedly stared at him, he easily reach up and retrieved some. "You could use accio," Draco remarked, and Harmony shrugged her shoulders, "or try to reach it, it's funny when you can't." They ignored Ron as he continued to gape as they worked together. Harmony kept piling the ingredients on Draco, and soon he could barely hold the list.
"Easy, all you have to do is picture someone you hate," she brought the hammer down in another crash of splinters, "then bash away."
"I sent him a picture of me kissing Harmony," Draco laughed, "Potter knows that I won, but still refuses to admit it. He's such a child." Blaise gave him a funny look as he watched the retreating form of Potter, and Ginny rushing after him.
"Harmony, what are you doing here? And what have you done to poor Frisker?" Leighton laughed as Draco scowled. But Harmony was eyeing the tall woman by his side. "Oh I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Candice." Leighton introduced them, and Candice waved. She was seriously pretty. Too-perfect pretty. Bordering on veela looks. But Harmony was taking in the flame red hair of the woman, trying to find as many features that looked different from another red head that Harmony knew-and found few. She silently vowed never to tell Ginny about this.
"Guys, I'm really not in the mood." She was just glad that all of the mouth ridden curtains were drawn.
"You can't lose something you never had, Hermione," Ron smirked. They gathered their belongings almost ready to head out.
Following Ginny's lead, Harmony took a glass and looked at it skeptically, before taking a sip. The drink was sweet and rich, fruity with a hint of something that Harmony couldn't identify. Harmony drank deeper, finishing it, and placed the empty glass by the side of the pool. She heard a light chuckle as Blaise stepped near and replaced it with a full one.
'I didn't know what girls like' was evident enough. She thanked them all and allowed Madame Pomfrey to drag her to her room for the check up.
"A blue-eyed black lemur," Kingscross answered him, "or also known as the Sclater's lemur. Here Dash!" Leighton held out his arm, and Luna dropped from the tree, landing on his head. They stared at her, and Draco was surprised to see that she had wide ice blue eyes. There was something creepy about looking at the lemur, like there was a familiar face behind the unkempt fur, one with human intelligence. He could see the wisdom, even as it examined the top of their Professor's head.
Hedwig swooped low and Draco veered after her, the ground rushing up closer and closer. He only jerked out of the dive when he saw that it was not Harmony, but a mouse that Hedwig had in her sights. Hedwig pulled up from her dive with a rodent clenched in her talons, and perched off in a nearby tree to devour it. Draco took the opportunity to land. He lay down on the grass, not even caring that it was dirty. He stared up at the leaves of the tree, which were blurry with the rush of motion as if he was still flying and Draco vowed never to do this again. So this is why wizards typically didn't use owls to find people.
I have been informed by the Headmaster of your turning and would be delighted to offer my guidance to you. We will have such a phenomenal time learning witch decorum and dancing. As of the moment two of my close friends are visiting so I will collect you tomorrow. I know that Dumbledore has told you that you would only stay with your relatives for a day, but I know that some more time with them may be constructive for your relation with them. People change Harmony and many for the better. Best of Luck
"Draco!" He heard the curt call of his father. Draco paused in his walk, before he chose to ignore it and keep on going. His father's long stride caught up with him, and Draco felt a hand at his shoulder. He looked into the other man's gray eyes impassively.
Harmony watched as the Great Hall door's opened once more, and Snape lead the Slytherins in as well. Harmony instantly spotted the platinum blonde hair, and relaxed her shoulders. She hadn't even thought of what she would have done if he was one of the missing students. His eyes raked through the sea of students till he found her green ones.
"Ron, I'll be fine," Hermione placed a hand on his back, propelling him towards the girl who had yet to spot the beaming boy. "I've just about had enough of shopping, and am ready to get back to Hogwarts."
The first few weeks of June found a subdued Draco Malfoy. He didn't even have the energy to be hacked off at the Gryffindor prats who acted as if they had won something. Who glared at him as if he was supposed to be sorry that the Dark Lord was dead. As if he cared.
"Merlin, you are impossible." Harmony jolted back, startled. She tried to read his expression, but couldn't. "Don't touch me."
"Sorry, Sir," she muttered. Draco looked at the man and wondered if something had happened. He wanted to roll his eyes when Blaise looked at him instead and smirked.
"Ah," he rasped, "I see you looking at that necklace." Indeed there was a necklace hanging in front of Harmony but she shook her head. He shuffled over and slowly bent down to see. "No?" he pondered. He followed the finger that was pressed against the brightly lit glass, and he saw the two rings that were in the corner.
He walked by their compartment and immediately saw Potter and walked on. He didn't know exactly what to do to get him alone. He walked passed it again and saw Granger, Red head, and Longbottom also inside. The rest of the Weasleys were in a compartment closer to his own. Draco figured he would do it the old fashioned way, and just jump right in.
"Alright, well done," Snape said, "50 points to Slytherin." Harmony stopped in mid strike, realizing that it was the first time Snape had ever rewarded points to her before. Maybe her mum was right, Snape wasn't so bad after all.
"This is getting complicated," Ginny said, "let's go with flooding the dungeons. It's easier, since they live under the lake."
Draco loosened his tie and then patted his shoulder. "I can take a punch," he said and Harmony snorted. "I'd go through much more too."
Draco didn't say a word. He felt rooted to the spot as white hot anger thudded through him. How dare she.
"Ginny!" Harmony shouted, and from the wall she took down her own weapon. She held a machete way over her head as a paw swiped down at her. It knocked away her weapon. "Shite." A giant paw pinned her shoulder to the wall, and spells were reflected from its back that Luna and Ginny were sending.
"What are watching?" Luna asked, "Draco's not doing anything." To her it would not look like doing anything, but Harmony knew what Draco was up to.
"Magical Fitness," Draco said "the female population does it to lose weight or something, but it's like an unwritten rule that only girls sign up for it."
Severus almost forgot the meeting he had with Harmony. He was sitting on his desk, absentmindedly. He frowned down at his hands, and saw that they were cracked and bony. He felt a pain inside, like he was missing something. There was a slight knock at his door. Harmony was right on time. "Come in," he said solemnly.
"No girl can resist my charms, plus there's plenty of me to go around!" She was momentarily disgusted because she could identify that voice. The fire brushed her legs but thankfully she didn't feel the burning, unfortunately the bristles of her broom alighted with fire.
Something grabbed her, but she continued to fall through the darkness. She couldn't see anything, only herself.
"Hurry up, get in the car." he said shoving her trunk into the back. Harry held onto Hedwig and sat onto the green leather seat. The car accelerated in motion and she ignored the glares that Vernon was flashing her from the mirror. It was going to be fine since it was only a day with them. Harry had more important things to think about. She watched through the window the passing landscape and the void canvas of the sky.
"As I recall, I am teaching one class," he motioned them over with both his hands. "I don't care about any of the differences or rivalries, it doesn't matter to me." They stood in a cluster in front of him, severely aware of the other. "When ever I have a lesson, feel free to sit on the floor, and when ever we practice we will get into groups. This is our playground." He spread his arms around.
Draco panicked when he lost track of the owl. There was nothing in his line of vision except clouds everywhere, and he had no idea where he was. Draco hovered in the air, looking for any sign of motion. A flurry of wings brought her into his focus once again, as Hedwig pulled up close to him, and seemed to examine him with her wide amber eyes. If Hedwig hadn't doubled back, Draco had no idea what he would have done. He vowed to buy a huge sack of owl treats when this was all over.
When Draco found out where they were, he wished that they were miles into the open sea, with sharks included. There was nothing below his feet supporting him. They had portkeyed alongside a cliff and had just missed the surface by five feet. Miles and miles of open air separated them from the ground. "Oh my God!" Draco yelled, and he had no time to curse out the Professor who deserved to drop dead. Because at that moment, that was precisely what was happening. Gravity was a cruel bitch sometimes.
"Just get on, Harmony." Draco made room for her, and Harmony placed a hand on his shoulder. She didn't say any thing more as she placed herself behind him. She wrapped her arms around his torso and rested against his back. He took off gently, and maneuvered between the spaces of the devil's snare. She could feel the muscles of his back and arms as he flew, and Harmony wondered if she would have had trouble flying the two of them. He was as powerful of a flyer as he was graceful, and Harmony felt safe as he brought them up.
Of course he had to be a bloody ferret, and the awful part was that he knew that it felt right. His chuckles came out as dooks. Perfect.
Through the whole winter break, his father had seemed withdrawn and distant. Though they had done all of the usual things together, it was all wrong. The Quidditch match in South America, jackalope hunting in Alaska; it all seemed hollow. And that was all before his father had discovered the clothes.
Harmony felt eyes burning through the back of her softer yet still short hair. Every time she looked behind her, even though she couldn't see who was glaring, she saw a certain smirk get bigger and bigger. It had to be Malfoy. Ron and Hermione gave her a funny look, to which she replied, "someone keeps staring at me."
"Sounds great," Blaise looked amused as he picked up his bag. Harmony held Draco's hand as they walked in between Harry and Blaise. The dark skinned teen had a bemused expression, as he examined them. "So where are you going to learn magic?" he asked.
McGonagall handed her a heavy package which she knew would be a textbook, and thanked her as well. On the table she saw a brown package and cautiously opened the soft material. She was marginally surprised when it was a bag from Margaret's Secret Lingerie store and could imagine skimpy dressed mannequins wearing flashing bright under garments and poor little Snape shielding his eyes from the bright colors. She took a few steps back, and held up a pair of light blue sock with patterns of kittens etched into them. She was so surprised since she had expected a bottle of rat livers.
"So, what are you doing here, Harmony?" Ginny asked, "is it to cheer Draco on?" Harmony sat next to the girls and decided that going as Harmony had not been as good of idea as she had previously thought.
"If you want forgiveness, then earn it. It's up to you to continue to be with her, or not." Draco stared at Snape's hard expression with surprise. "But if you run away from her now, then you will lose her forever."
Harmony had the mind to stop them, to send Draco away, but something inside of her couldn't. She saw passed his reflection and watched the whiteness blur. She did nothing as he sat across from her. "Harmony," he said, "look at me."
"I don't know if I can leave you alone now, Potter," Draco replied in a smoothness much like that of snake scales. "I assume that you don't want others to know, I just want to compromise with you," he waited a moment before continuing. "I don't want to fight with you for the rest of these years, I can be your friend."
"Castreo!" The Slytherins laughed as a spell caused a blow to her crotch. She winced, when it hit her, but otherwise it didn't leave her gasping on the floor with tears if she had been a boy. Crabe, Goyle, Pazy, Nott, and Blaise howled with laughter as Harmony glared at them.
"Father!" Draco shouted, but something else stopped him. Mr. Malfoy screamed and kneeled to the floor. He was clutching an arm that now hung uselessly. Draco watched Harmony with an open mouth, not being able to read what lay behind the anguish. She staggered to Black, and Draco found that his body too could move. Those nonexistent weights that anchored him soundlessly dropped to the floor. He ignored his father who still clutched his arm as he went to the trembling girl.
"What are you talking about, I add sugar and honey in all the time," she said. Her face distracted him for a moment.
"Ron and Herminone should be upstairs dear," McGonagall reassured Harmony, before she and the rest of the advance guard began to walk over to a distant room.
"My name is Harmony Black. Bitch." Harmony stated, carefully enunciating the bitch, and glaring coldly as Voldemort gaped.
"So what do you suppose that I do about this?" Draco pointed at his wet shirt, which Harmony was wary not stare at for more than a second.
"There are the dungeons, the students may be there." Draco suggested. He didn't notice the others giving him strange looks. Harmony realized that he didn't even think it was odd to have dungeons in his house.
All of a sudden, Ginny's lips were on Harmony's-kissing her. Full out snogging her. Draco could see from where he was sitting how the Weasley-girl's tongue moved around the inside of his girlfriend's mouth.
"Oh, I'm sorry I thought your contenders were kids your own size, but I could be wrong since I have yet to meet someone of your bulk."
Harmony dipped her feet into the water, enjoying the warmth and its turquoise glow. She heard the padding of feet before Draco sat down next to her. He held her hand, and Harmony stopped to look at their intertwined fingers, before raising her eyes to his face. Up close, she saw it. The hint of tension that came when he was trying to hide his emotions. She leaned in to give him a quick kiss on his cheek and to whisper, "did I get you in trouble with your father?"
"Alright," he said after a pause, "but how are we going to get there? The Manor will be heavily guarded, we can't fly in, or walk in through the main doors."
"Oh." Harmony replied. But it wasn't until she exchanged some of the galleons for muggle money that she understood for the first time in her life how much money she really had. The weight of the money bag felt heavier than it had before, weighing down her pockets, begging to be spent.
"So how do you guys normally have it locked?" The room that Proffesor McGonagall had given to her only opened when she turned the knob in a certain way. They were mostly the same.
Oh it's you again. Harmony heard the hat say to her. I suppose that you'll want to be put in your old house then?
"The Dark Lord severed his soul, and placed the pieces into different objects. It could be in anything, in a locket, in a diary, or even a tiara." Draco regarded the misery in those green eyes, and felt an ache inside. "My father was ordered to retrieve a tiara in Hogwarts and wanted to bring me back. I'm sorry that you lost your family," Draco finished, and Harmony looked down at her hands.
"Potter!" came a voice from Snape's office, "Remove your presence from my door this instant, I do not want to hear another thing from you!" The ferret squeaked and Harmony shot up and began to run, just in time before the door burst open and an angry Snape stepped out into the hall. "No running in the halls! 25 Points from GRYFFINDOR!"
Draco joined Harmony at glaring at Leighton. There was nothing perfect right then. "We will work on the healing arts, seeing how there is so much inflicting, and yet so little mending." Draco hoped that this wouldn't be a long lecture on how important healing was. "Take a seat younglings," Leighton said while pointing to the cushioned floors. He sat with them in circle and all at once, the room dimmed.
But it wasn't what he really wanted. Draco shook his head, and lifted the locket from his neck. Draco didn't want to settle for less, and in no way did he desire to hurt her. Making her jealous would not cause her to fall for him. No, he needed something else.
"Anyway, Potter sure pulled a number on us, I'd stay away from him if I were you. Theodore's ready to just about crush the git. Seems like his father has something to do about it. Be careful Draco, you just may be next." Blaise looked at him and rolled his eyes as Draco still pretended to not be listening. "So is Potter a good kisser?"
Draco picked up where she left off, "we went to Maui, to Salzburg and Budapest, spent a week in Brazil, we flew through the Grand Canyon, swam in the Great Barrier Reef, walked on the Great Wall, toured a couple major cities and national parks. That kind of thing."
"Are you finding it hard to believe? It's the third time you've made your presence known." Luna said, "At least they don't think you're somebody else."
"The development of magic comes as much from internal aspects as external ability. A three to one fight may be an equal match with the agility, wit, and prowess of a strong wizard or witch. Control and discipline over the body is stability over the magic. Physical strength and mental strength are interlinked. Control over magic is manipulating it without succumbing to its power, to its possible use to corrupt and ill the world."
They arrived at the flat and Harmony stripped off the pale pink cloak that was supposed to mark her as a girl, or a flamboyant transvestite for that matter. She was glad that the flat allowed her a private room and washroom, and she dragged her trunk to the foot of her bed. It was only four in the afternoon and McGonagall wanted her to shop for proper clothes to fit a young lady.
He smirked when something came to him that even Salazar would have approved of. That night Draco slept with the locket shoved and locked in a suitcase that only opened to his voice with the password that he only knew. He wasn't going to risk another sleepless night with the possibility of Leighton and Harmony getting it on. Like Hell he would be foolish enough to torture himself so.
He paused a moment before venturing on. "So why aren't you in class, someone read your palm and say something devastating, like you would be a virgin till age 34?"
"A girl can hope," Ginny smiled, "and maybe eventually he'll see something special right in front of him." They neared the common room and Harmony hugged Ginny.
In order to apparate to the Malfoy Manor, Harmony had them go through the shortest Hogsmead tunnel, and still she felt like they were fighting time. She had no way of knowing if Narcissa was still breathing. The last thing Harmony did before Dobby apparated was to throw the invisibility cloak over them with all of their arms holding each other. A crack split the air, right before her whole being shifted, like she was squeezed down a tunnel with an opening the size of a Galleon. She almost lost balance when her feet touched a hard floor.
"Don't worry dear, I made a sign and locked the doors so that only individuals of life threatening injuries could seek my help. You must be very hungry." Harry nodded her head and turned towards the headmaster and Snape.
"No," Harmony sushed him, "nor is this the place." She got to her feet and leaned on a wall closest to her. Then she looked at him, "Thanks."
"Never been here in my life," he said, and Harmony didn't bother thinking too deeply how ridiculous that sounded.
"Please," Harmony whispered, too soft for them to hear. She didn't care any more whether she hurt their feelings or not.
Harmony stuck out her hand and Draco lifted the locket from under his shirt. It was warm when it touched her skin, and Harmony slipped it over her head. "Better?"
Students timidly walked up to the front and eyed the hammer they were given. Only Crabbe opted to use his meaty fists, which accounted to a howl of pain, and snickers from the Gryffindors. There were hollow taps throughout the room, like the sound of screws nailed to walls. "Hmm, I thought that you all would be overjoyed to vandalize school property," Leighton said a minute later to the pathetic hammering.
He thought that he could lock away the image of Harmony and Leighton, but his mind thought otherwise. At the worst times, Harmony would be pressed against him and Draco would snap a quill or hex the nearest thing. When at last he saw Harmony, even as a boy, Draco wanted to push her against a wall and claim her lips as his. He would make sure that Leighton would never cross her mind. It took all of Draco's self control not to corner her, and even more control to stop worse thoughts from making him violent. He trailed behind Harmony with a scrowl itching his face. He did not have to worry about the Slytherins bothering him, because they very well knew what a cross Draco could do.
As if the room were a forest relinquishing its leaves- it felt bare to the students. They looked about unsure towards their professor, to which he snapped his fingers. Immediately the floor softened from under their feet, turning the room into blue and red blocks of padding. The two houses naturally separated from either side and Leighton looked back from the two and sighed.
"Really? I think I dozed off at that part," Harmony's eyes, laden with unsuppressed apathy for the assignment, directed to the placid looking glass surface.
All at once a spell from Harmony struck his father's face, and Draco knew that there would be more blood to pay. "You!" is father spat, and cupped the wound at his face. The wand in Harmony's shaking fingertips was wrenched from her grasp and flung away with a spell. "Who is this?" His Father directed at Draco.
Dumbledore was human, and thus fallible. But this was madness. "Harry, your parents before they passed away, they didn't name you Harry, I just used that to fit with your illusion. They named you Harmony."
"Thank you," Draco said, before pushing himself further to make it to Harmony. When they reached the room, Harmony was still bent over Sirius's body. He had not known that pain could rebound to him if he were to ever hurt another person. Or that seeing another's suffering could bring him to his knees. The sight of Harmony with blood and tears mingled together mourning somebody she had loved, was worst than any physical pain he had experienced. It was a twisting ache, that magic would not heal. "Harmony," Draco said. "I am here."
"All the better," Draco said. Harmony felt as if there were more than one pair of eyes watching her, watching them. She looked around as couples danced with each other. She hadn't always been the best dancer, and she never danced in heels before. She was going to suggest that they sit, when he started to move. He danced a little at first, and she laughed when he missed a step or did his own flare. Harmony followed him, swinging her hands and tapping her feet.
"Well he's certainly making an impression on you," Luna commented, "and I think it's rather nice of him to think so much about his special someone."
Harmony turned to Draco. "I'm sorry, about him. He get's like this sometimes." Draco brushed the hair from his eyes, and shrugged his shoulders.
Dinner was a bit of an awkward affair considering Snape and Sirius kept on giving her furtive glances as if she would blow up like a rampaging girl, or start giggling. It was funny too watching both of the grown men glaring at each other next while one was wolfing food down and the other grinding the pasta into liquid.
"I'll be right back, Harmony." She did not respond to him, as if she was in her own world where he did not exist. His father gripped his arm tightly as they left the room. He was still in pain. "You should get that checked out," Draco said. His father gave him a look, which shut him up.
"Or wrestle," Draco grinned, "though I'd have to win". Harmony scoffed at him, in reply. "Well, we should only do that if it comes down to it." Draco touched his leg to hers and she shrugged her shoulders.
"Holy hell bent mother, she's possessed!" Ron covered his ears and eyes, fearing to be the next victim.
"But Harmony, we have not even gotten the panties yet." Ah hell, someone kill me now. She did not just hear McGonagall saying panties. Ewwww.
"When my Father came to collect me on Christmas, he probably meant for me to go to the Dark Lord and get turned into a Death Eater. Now my mum has to pay since I refused to do it." Harmony said nothing in reply, just listening to him work out his thoughts. "Maybe that's what happened to Theodore instead. His Father broke out of Azkaban, and wants to get up in the ranks, even if he has to offer his son to do so." He wondered if Theodore was already a Death Eater, but it explained a lot if he was.
"A map that shows where everyone in Hogwarts is," she said, "they'll be here in less than five minutes."
"Are you serious?" Harmony asked, looking at her choices of bathing suits. They were all bikinis. Harmony held one in disgust; it looked like someone had cut out a few little triangles, held them together by pieces of string and then decided to call it swim wear.
"How dare you," the girl shot, "You're dead!" Some of the Gryffindors laughed at Parkinson's elephant ears and the girl left in distress. No one else came forward to say who had cast the spell. Harmony couldn't believe that she still didn't know the spell to clear the water from her soaked body. She shivered in her cloak and her shoes squelched with water. She hated the Madidus spell. Her house mates hung back a bit, to make sure that nothing else would happen before leaving as well.
"I'm not going to repeat myself, Kreacher, why is this locket so important?" Harmony asked as the house elf began to twitch.
"No," he simply said, as he took a ladle and made counterclockwise circles in the blue liquid. He had to concentrate. The room was too silent, and Draco looked up at other partners. Instead he saw Professor Snape's crossed arms. There was a frown on Snape's lips as his eyes were on Harmony. He looked at the girl, and saw that she held an open bottle to the cauldron. Draco grabbed her hand, stopping the miscellaneous brown substance from flowing in. "What," he asked, "do you think you're doing?"
He couldn't believe it. The rejection hurt more than the first. It was unfathomable, and twice by the same person. Bloody Potter! Draco made his way back to his compartment in silent fury.
"That's not how I see it. You stood up against your father, and told him that you would not be one of the Dark Lord's followers." Snape said, "Draco, what happened was not your fault."
"Ron, look at you, you ate half the table yourself," Hermione interjected. Harmony just then caught the identical half smiles of Fred and George, who sat diagonal from them. Seconds later a first year shot up as his drink exploded into rainbow dust and butterflies. Harmony joined in on their smiles.
"Yes," Draco said, and immediately he felt the strain of Snape's mind on him. The man dug as if he could rip out chunks of Draco's thoughts, and Draco sealed up his mind even more, determined to give the older man nothing.
Remus Lupin woke with a pounding in his head, much like a killer hangover. He groaned. It must have been a rough night, considering the state of the room. Curtains were shredded, furniture dismantled, but at least there were no dead bodies of animals. Remus rearranged his clothes, finding a new assortment of tears that would need mending. He stopped when he heard something across the hall, and he knew it wasn't Kreacher's usual shuffling. He unlocked the door and stared as if a ghost had passed.
Harmony looked taken aback, and took a few steps closer towards him before stopping. "The Great Hall is in a huge commotion, with everybody asking each other for a dance, I barely escaped from Ginny." The space between them seemed to be widening.
"Sirius," Harmony pulled away a bit, wanting a better look at her God Father, "what are you doing here?" He was so excited, that if he was still a dog, he probably would be whining.
"Do not tell me, I cannot bare to listen and possibly have it forced out of me," Severus looked away from the headmaster, his eyes downcast and near loathing.
"What is the meaning of this!" Draco spat. He felt cheated. "Why the hell are we here, in some kind of warped playground?" There wasn't anything animal like or natural about the place. Kingscross breathed in heavily.
She didn't think anything as his hard chest pressed against her back, or if he held her too tightly. She just thought it strange the way Draco was looking more and more upset from it all. "Now if a boy has you pinned down," Leighton said, looking at each of them in turn, and holding Harmony's hands behind her back, "remember there are ways to fight." He had her on her back before she knew it, pinned at her shoulder with a strong hand. The rest on his body wasn't touching her, and was kneeling next to her. She looked up at him in shock, and knew that he would be too heavy to throw off. "If you don't have anything, and you are desperate, use magic. A burst of wandless magic, is just as powerful as a fist to the face." Harmony realized how close he was, and why Draco had been looking at them oddly. She grabbed his arm, and with the thought that she did not want to be manhandled, a burst of magic from her hands threw him off.
"Really?" Snape asked, "but you look quite comfortable there." She forced her legs to stand and she faced him. "Alright, but remember to shield your mind, the worst attacks are the ones to your heart. You can feel my presence, but you must expel me from your thoughts. You must want it." He paused a moment before mumbling legimens. And everything became numb. Before she knew it, she was on the floor once more. But she felt something subconsciously. Something Snape was sending her way. Like a breath whispered into her ear the words, don't trust him, formed in her brain.
Draco had to nearly pry the girls apart before he could pull Harmony away and out of the water. Blaise held his breath as they passed him, but Draco didn't even look his way. The only magic that Draco performed was summoning a towel, which he draped over Harmony carefully. The two of them walked out of the room-Harmony rather unsteadily, and Blaise was sure that he wouldn't see either of them again that night.
"What are we to do now?" he asked her, "we aren't heading to the roof anymore." She felt like doing something crazy, and if she wasn't going to do something, she might just press into him in a bear hug.
"And there was this beautiful flower chick." She carefully did not react as Fred and George interrupted Ron. They signed in unison as they described her. "She danced like a tulip in the wind, but only twice did she grace the dance floor. And not with either of us dishy men."
"I am!" she said, and once again Snape was in her head. He was delving further into the memories that she desperately wanted to hide. She didn't want him to see her kissing Draco or witness other personal memories. When ever he got close, her mind became blank, and she thought of nothing. Sometimes she showed him things that she didn't care for him to see. She allowed her memories of previous potions class and divinations to fill her mind. Snape seemed to notice, but didn't offer any encouragement. He probably thought it was better to see nothing, than to see the memories that showed who she really was.
Harmony sat up with her back against a cool stone wall. She then noticed the thin black cloak draped over the lower half of her body. She looked up at the standing young man. He was an envious height a bit over six feet tall with a pale yellow shirt and tan pants that melded with his well built frame. His light burnt amber hair swept to his side to the length of his eyebrows. He had a rugged look with slight stubble that defined his square jaw. As if he felt her eyes he took his away from Sirius to rest on green. Only then did she catch herself, she had been checking him out. She abruptly turned to Sirius and hugged his dog form by hiding her face, at least she wouldn't be a deathly pale color anymore. She couldn't believe that she was behaving like such a girl.
"I want pay back," she said, "I'm planing something for the Slytherins, care to join me?" Draco saw the glint in her eyes and smirked.
"You'll regret this," Ron spat. Before Ron could get a curse out, he was tied with invisible ropes that bound his arms, legs, and mouth. The students parted as Leighton hopped off from his desk and flipped his wand in the air.
Harmony got comfortable on the grass besides the road to Hogwarts, and her mind began to wander. Was it a mistake to come so nicely dressed? Especially since she was meant to meet up with Draco. She still had him classified as dangerous. She could picture Ron's disapproval to her actions so far. She knew that nothing good would come from her interactions with Draco. She sighed, and leaned against a tree behind her. She needed to relax her mind.
A warm tightness filled her chest, and a small smile slipped through. She met his steel grey eyes and the smile grew. "Do you want to go to the dance with me?" she asked.
Ginny scanned Harmony's new look critically, targeting one new addition. She grabbed the girl's hand and turned it, looking at the ink design that started just at her forearm, and curved its way up to her shoulder. "Oh no, you didn't."
"Which would mean," Leighton smiled, "that each of you will be given code names." Harmony smacked her forehead with her palm, shaking her head in disapproval.
"Because Albus has already left Hogwarts. If there is an attack-" she stopped her sentence and clenched her wand, "I fear the worst is yet to break in." Harmony could feel her Professor's thoughts as if they were her own. Her mind was miles away on a certain Dark Lord, and as Ginny stood next to Harmony, she had to stop her thoughts from turning dark.
A few days had passed since she had been drenched in water, and Harmony had put it behind her. It was after classes when she was going to meet up with Ginny and Luna in the library, when she got the feeling like something was following her. The feeling didn't leave her when she checked that no one was behind her. She picked up her pace, and could have sworn that she heard foot steps. She made it to the library, and sat with the girls at a table. "Hey," Harmony said, "I think I have a stalker."
"Harry, I hope you are feeling better, you were in there an awfully long time, and no visitors were allowed." Hermione said as if to ask why the Hospital Wing was blocked.
"And keep the late night festivities to only three times a week!" Harmony nodded once more. "And I don't want to hear any stories about boys." Harmony gasped, and Sirius winked back. "I'm serious."
"That's not fair, she's my friend too! I have important gossip to go over with her, you can't take her for the whole trip."
"Really?" Ron looked bewildered, "but I thought that you two would make a cute couple." Harmony looked behind her at the Ravenclaw table and realized that Cho Chang hadn't come to her mind in ages.
Though all he wanted was to bring her close, he let her go. He couldn't do this anymore, to be with someone and having it feel so right, when it was all wrong. He took a step back to admire her once more. She looked at him curiously. "Thank you," he said simply and turned away. He didn't go that far before he felt something tug at his arm.
As it turned out, Ginny couldn't have the locket longer than two days before the girl started going ape shite on everyone. When she had over heard Ron tell Hermione that he thought this was the worse he had ever seen her PMS, two women had him glued and hexed, and Ron learned the hard way about female related tact. Luna on the other hand, was immediately crossed out from locket bearer. The moment it hung around her neck, her eyes rolled back and she went into a trance. In fact, when her mouth opened, she began to prophesize. "The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking more than your blood. He will steal everything from you. Death is at knife point, waiting to carve out your heart. The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking…seeking…seeking…" Harmony jumped when she heard that, remembering those same words from Trelawny, right before she had switched into magical fitness. Ginny, Draco, and Harmony stared at the girl when the locket was safely removed. "Well," Luna said, "that was certainly peculiar."
"It's OK," he said and Harmony leaned into him. She trailed her hands over the thick material of his shirt till she rested them at the back of his neck. Harmony could read the happiness in his eyes and she grinned back. Her head rested against his chest and she shut her eyes from the swirl of colors and students. She relaxed as she felt his arms around her, strong, and Harmony allowed the moment to sink in. "There's a photo booth," Draco suddenly said. Harmony followed his line of sight and saw that Collin had a set where he shot photos of couples.
The blood had been removed from her school robes, and the torn up fabric mended. She still wore the bandages over her chest, and when they were cleaned, she traced the pink outline of a faint scar over her heart.
A scene when they were only eleven plastered against her mind, of a younger Draco asking her to be friends, and herself as a young boy rejecting his hand. She could make out parts of his face, she knew that he was serious, but something was behind his proposal.
"This is so weird," Draco said as the people took no notice of them. He seemed to be enjoying himself very much, and when they got far enough, she pulled the cloak away and changed back into Harry.
"And you will tell him," Severu's head shot up, meeting the headmaster's eyes. "But there is something else you must plant in him." Dumbledore pulled out a ring atop a hand that looked like it had been scorched and blackened beyond recognition. "Do you remember this?"
"Yeah," Harmony muttered, "we will do it to night. Tell Luna." Harmony closed the door and locked it shut. All she wanted to do was curl up and sleep.
"Ok, what do you guys think of this," Harmony asked, "The mixture of unicorn sweat and fungus produces a mildew of such potency that when swallowed could make the drinker's pores open and shoot out rainbows of butterflies."
"Wow," he said in what could have been a laugh, moving to kiss her cheek, and she moved her head to kiss him again. He went for her neck, and enjoyed the hitch of her breath as he gave her a soft kiss there.
"I don't know," Ron said, "you seem so different." Hermione joined them at the table and caught the last words.
Ginny sidled up to Harmony, hooking her arm through Harmony's one free arm, causing Draco to scowl. "Hey Harmony," Ginny said, as if Draco wasn't there, "did you hear about the Hogsmeade trip?"
"Well, I'm going to drink it later, so better that it tastes good," she whispered. He could not believe it.
"I'll try it." Harmony pulled her shapeless Duddley shirt from over her head and covered herself with Draco's. It was still too big for her, but it didn't look as awkward as the other. "It feels nice," she said without thinking.
Draco shook his head, "I'm serious." He leaned closer to her, "try me." This was the chance that she was waiting for, to develop her skills in order to get into Voldemort's mind, discreetly. "I'm sure that my mind is much more pleasant than Professor Snape's."
"I don't think I could do anything to make this room any worse," Harmony said. The mold would just collect, and was a fragrance compared with every thing else. "It's revolting."
"I have already put my family and myself at risk, Professor. There's not much more that I can lose."
Severus Snape sat at his desk for awhile longer. He did not linger through the halls, watching for children to give detentions. He hoped that he could right things, that the Dark Lord's wrath would be away from the girl. And though the blackness would always remain, there was still a light that touched his heart.
"Don't I?" he asked in feigned innocence. "You couldn't have forgotten me, and I know all of the pretty girls." He looked her up and down once more; it gave her the shivers to be seen so blatantly.
"What, no hi, how's it going, nice to see you again?" he grinned even more as she gave him a pointed stare. "Fine, Dumbledore hired me, apparently there's a shortage of Defense Against the Dark Arts professors willing to take a job at Hogwarts. And as to how I did that, I'm a wizard Harmony. I can do magic."
"Oh," Harmony mouthed out, "Your animagus animal and protronus are the same." Leighton smiled at her.
"I want to apologize." Harmony turned to the window, and shut her eyes. Why was he doing this? She didn't want to hear any more.
The day passed easily enough, Transfiguration with McGonagall had them turn needles into small crowns. Hagrid had shown his students innocent enough looking rabbits with antlers. Harmony was beginning to feel that the day would turn out for the better, until that was when she checked her schedule and saw the inked in letters spelling Divination. She cursed her fowl luck.
He stopped at the Quidditch equipment room and Harmony almost bumped into him. He lifted the cloak from her and Harmony stepped away. "I remember you using this cloak," Draco said, "at Hogsmead one year."
And then the plunge began. This was not like flying on a broom, zooming with a portkey, or teleporting by flu powder. This was a lot like falling to death. And at that exact moment, Draco knew that wings would not sprout from his shoulder blades. A chorus of screams filled his ears and his own vocal cords uttered his own cries. Manly cries of distress. "We are going to die!" Someone screeched. Though they had been falling for only seconds, the surface already crouched to spring on them. "The ground is right there, it's going to kill us!"
"Oh really, I was asleep the entire time. I guess she didn't want anyone disturbing me unless it was an emergency. You know how protective she can be." Harry smiled a bit "I feel loads better thanks." Ron had his mouth full, so he couldn't really say any platitudes.
"I'll return when you are rested Harmony, and place that spell to conceal your face. Take care." Dumbledore left and she shut her eyes.
"Sure," Ginny shook her head, "Look, It is not my business if you end up happy or not, but with Harmony, it becomes my business, and as impossible as it seems, she's opened up to you, Draco." Ginny closed her eyes, before allowing her emotions to go to far. "Don't let your pride get in the way."
"No, but he would have given me a detention if he had seen it." Harmony shivered as a draft of cold wind hit her face. They reached a stairwell which they usually met, and Draco leaned against the banister in a relaxed manner. "Hello," he said when they got close, and she allowed the magic to drop from her face. She hooked her glasses into her shirt collar, and Ginny cocked her head to the side.
He was numb as he held the girl in his arms, and his mind urged him to act quick. "I'll get the Basilisk fang," he said, and stood up. Ginny scrambled to where they were and pointed the way.
"Nah, I like this angle better. Plus I can be with you two," she said and waved a flag with a raven on it.
"Legillimens!" Harmony delved into his mind, and came out almost empty handed. She went deeper, forcing her way into his thoughts. He felt her go blindly against him, and Draco presented a memory which he thought frequently of. It was the time that they had their first date, as he liked to call it, at Hogsmead. It was a simple memory as he walked with his arm around her, touching her bare shoulder. It brought him something akin to happiness, as he allowed a passing thought to be noticed. The one word, beautiful, left him, and Harmony pulled away abruptly.
"I've got a secret, but I need to whisper it to you." Whoa, Harry wished that she had said that on Cho or any unsuspecting girl. She gulped down her pressing fear and hoped that she wasn't turning pink from humiliation.
"I'm counting." Ron got onto his knees and put his hands in front of his body. "Heck, you can even do girly push ups if you want." Ron's face was mortified as the Slytherins laughed at his predicament. He felt his body shake as it strained to do even one. "All the way." Ron's face flushed with embarrassment as he sucked in a shuttering breath. He collapsed on the floor by the fourth one, and Leighton sighed. "That's enough," he said, "since I stopped you before you hurt anybody. But meet me after class in my office, Ronald." Ron stood up quickly and shook his head.
But it was strange that he was so interested in her. Almost to the point of being obsessed. He had always gone out of his way to put her on edge. Was this any different? Harmony watched as the two seekers dived. The snitch had been spotted, and Harmony saw way bellow, the snitch. It was easy to see who was faster, who had better control over the broom. It didn't look like Draco was just falling, he looked like a hawk catching its prey. He had gotten better since the last time they had a match, and as the stadium became silent, Draco reached out his hand at the same time as leveling the broom. Once the snitch was in his hand, the whistle was blown. The Slytherins howled at the win.
"I'm glad that I got to go and get out of this blasted house. But I would be careful if I were you. Be wary of who you talk to, you may trust somebody with your life, but who really knows the person within?"
Harmony was careful to tread softly over the creaky floor as she made her way to the stairs. The grip around her neck had not loosened. She needed water.
"Because it's embarrassing! Hell, it's a nightmare just for me to accept it, let alone the madness that would happen if it got out. I don't want things to change right now. Just this once, I don't want- I don't know- to be so..." Harmony put her head in her hands, feeling torn. She wanted to tell Ron and Hermione, but she couldn't. They had been friends with her for too long, if they found out, it wouldn't be the same. She was trapped.
Harmony cradled Sirius Black's head and tears welled up in her eyes. Draco could not understand why. Here was the man who had sold out her parents and had tried to kill her, and Harmony whose tears fell upon him. Black was dead. But still Harmony clenched the man's robes and brought her head down to the dead man's chest. Draco felt a cold dread as he wondered why she looked as if she wanted to join him. Traces of Blood stained her clothes and he stepped closer.
"You two are getting really close," Ron remarked, "are you guys going out?" Probably it wasn't quite so smart for her to have the globet to her mouth again, because this time the juice did meet its target. "Because I'm fine if you are, you can tell me." Ron dragged his hand over his face and squeegeed the rest off.
"That kind of stuff doesn't matter! You don't know him, Malfoy's are bad, they are just evil..." Ron tried to explain earnestly. He was clearly concerned about her well being. It was almost touching.
"I will do anything to be with Harmony." Snape's eyes widened, as if he had not expected to see the truth so plainly in Draco's eyes.
"A most painful and humiliating death indeed," Voldemort said in glee, "he says he can stop me? Hah! The fool will die before he destroys the second one."
Magical Fitness was not what she had expected. Girls had giggled at her, possible at her unflattering pajama bottoms and oversized shirt. She figured that if she had to go to Hogsmeade, then she might as well get shorts and shirts that didn't make her look like an air ballooned turtle.
"I was going to tell you mate," Ron stumbled through, "but Hermione said that it would be best to keep it on the down low. That you would feel bad or something," he began to laugh nervously.
"What is Draco in here for?" Dumbledore asked. He knew that if he opened his eyes a crack he would be able to see the stars twinkling in the vast blue depths.
"Oh Merlin," Hermione chocked out. Harmony looked at Hermione's troubled face before the Daily Prophet was passed before her. It read, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has Returned, and in smaller print, seen breaking into the Ministry of Magic. The news spread and fear along with it. Harmony gave back the paper for Hermione to read, and she realized that students were looking to her. Harmony's eyes searched for Dumbledore, but many of the staff including said Headmaster were absent. She had no idea what Voldemort had been planing, what he could want at the Ministry of Magic. She looked to the Slytherin table and saw that many of the Slytherins had mixed reactions. A good majority were in fear, some had tiny little smirks, and only one looked troubled. Draco Malfoy sat separated from his usual friends, whether from choice or from them ostracizing him, she did not know. He was reading his paper, but his brow was nit, and he was biting his bottom lip. "Harry."
Leighton smartly chose not to go after them with battle axes, and instead greeted them from atop his desk. He sat with his legs hanging over the mahogany wooden frame and his elbows on his knees. "Come, come, don't be shy." Leighton jumped to the floor and looked at them closely.
"Not before magical fitness," Harmony said, "I guess I never really thought about it." She had always been so thin, and didn't think that bulking up would have even been possible.
"Look, Frisker doesn't even need the locket," a wide smile filled the insufferable arse's face. The man held out his hands in a placating gesture when Draco glared. "It's a joke, lighten up."
With the snap of a twig breaking above her, Harmony moved on, training her ears to hear all around her. She looked up above her, and then back on the ground to make out any shadows. Her nostrils flared as she picked up the sent of another animal. It was close by, and Harmony stalked across the brown deaden leaves. Her mouth began to water, and she slowed to a crawl. She only had one time to pounce, and she wanted to win the hunt. She could feel her heart pounding through her veins, and was overwhelmed with how natural it felt.
"But the other man she was with," Hermione included, "now, he was something." Ron looked offended. "You on the other hand," Hermione assuaged, facing Ron "are so adorable and delectable and..."
Snape's detention was much different than Draco had expected. For one, they weren't cleaning cauldrons with their toothbrushes, and secondly, it had been much more of a learning process than his actual class. Of course it had been a lesson of occlumnecy, but it was something Draco needed. He had to block everyone from finding out more about him and Harmony. He wasn't an open book for the other students' enjoyment.
Harmony lifted a hand away from her forehead laden with cold sweat. "I haven't done anything to you, I swear," said a different voice, one filled with concern. Where was she? Gray filled her eyes, she concentrated on that.
"What are you talking about? This is totally unnecessary, I already said that I would go all dressed up, it wasn't an invitation for you to do any of this."
"The hell," she mumbled. The owl had flown away and she wondered what kind of encrypted, convoluted message this was.
"So how do you get the face lift to look like Harry Potter?" Draco asked as he kept in pace with her.
"There is something more about it, it's dark, I don't think you should keep it." Kreacher hissed at that and stuck out his hand further. "What are you going to do with it?" Harmony asked.
Draco titled his head before taking her hand. "This way." Harmony followed Draco. "This side is where the boys sleep, and each year is split up in levels. We can either sleep in the room where everyone sleeps, or buy our own. Most of us have our own rooms". The walls were mostly bare, except for the skulls and bones. The air was thicker than in the Gryffidor room, and was perfect for mold to sprout.
"If that is all, then see me after class. Oh, and fifteen points from Gryffindor, for an unsightly display." Snape pivoted on his foot to make a curt exit. The door swung shut.
'There is still time to save Draco's mum,' Harmony thought. Voldemort looked to his forearm where the dark mark burned black.
"Oh, just a few more hair clips and I will be finished." After a bit of touch ups, she cleaned up the battle field of bottles and such. "There." The ropes that restricted her slid to the floor. "Now change into this," Ginny said and held out a light cream dress.
It was simple enough. Guard everything in his mind, and close off all other thoughts. "Legilimens!" Snape shouted. Draco took a step back as he felt Snape's mind intrude in his thoughts. He guarded himself well, as he hid the most precious things. He allowed his face to remain impassive as Snape left him empty handed.
"Voldemort was resurrected using my blood, which turned him into a woman," Harmony explained as she led Ginny and Luna away.
Harmony's eyes widened as she pulled away from Draco, and turned to see Lupin looking worse than usual. "No," the man said slowly watching her strangely, "who are you?"
Harmony's eyes burned from lying awake all night, and she was not amused with the feet that paced at her door. She had the mind to throw her shoe and yell that she was trying to sleep. When the second pair of feet lingered by she cursed under her breath. It didn't matter that they were Ron and Hermione. They were whispering, not so quietly, in front of her door.
There was no red carpet, lit candles, or velvet love seat when Harmony brought Sirius into the room. At first she wondered if this was the right place that Draco had showed her. There were piles of furniture and miscellaneous objects, but Harmony could have sworn it was the place. Sirius, in his dog form, began to sniff all around the room. Soon enough, he found a bone too big to be anything human to entertain himself.
"Yes, but are you sure that I should be doing this, Sir?" Draco asked. This certainly was beyond illegal, not to mention completely intrusive.
The peace was momentarily broken when the compartment door thrust open, and Ginny burst in, hugging Harmony. She pulled away to get a good look at her and gave a half smile. "Maybe I shouldn't have spent half my summer worried about you. Look at you!"
"I don't know. I really- Damn it." Draco muttered, "Snape said that the Dark Lord was angry because of me."
"Are you recommending yourself? Sorry Ron, but I'm going to have to decline. I couldn't bear to hurt Hermione's feelings like that."
"How do you know who I am? Dumbledore going around letting the entire faculty know?" He faced her and she took in his brawny frame, his imposing height. But he did not give off an aggressive air.
"No!" Severus nearly shouted, starling the two standing, "right now you need to concentrate on blocking him out, and protecting yourself. You do not need to worry about anything else." He gripped the arm of his chair. "It is getting late," he seethed.
He vaguely could recall the horrors of Health class in the muggle schooling, but even that could not answer the question of his retarded growth and lack of puberty. The human body seemed like a foreign subject for there were no classes on it offered, at least that he knew of.
The two shot hexes at one another, and seemed almost evenly matched, until the Dark Lord shot a green light at one of the Hufflepuff students, and Draco knew that he had shot to kill. The wand was pointed next at his face. Draco froze, as all the blood drain out of him. He had never had to think about his own death before.
Harmony slumped a bag over her shoulder and left the Gryffindor room. She couldn't help but feel the emptiness of the house, and left in a rush. She checked the passageway before throwing the cloak over her shoulders. The sun had set hours ago and curfew passed along with it.
"Yeah, but you didn't want to hex me dead." Draco shrugged his shoulders and simply met her eyes. "I can tell the difference between common hate and cruelty."
Pain seared his arm, and Severus leaned against his office door, before slamming it shut. He grit his teeth, mumbling rotten words that soured the air. Harmony had caught him off guard, and he did not want her to see him clutching his forearm. He wiped his brow, unaware of the sweat that gave his pain away. He made it to his desk and opened one of his drawers with his wand which only responded to his wand tip. His hand swept over brewed bottles, selecting one shaped like a spinning top. He flicked it open, before downing it. Severus closed his eyes, trying to escape in his mind.
Harmony looked at her mum weirdly. She was friends with one of her professors? Then why did he fail her in everything?
"Of course it's not, you are much too special to be ground down by anything less than courageous, perfect, and pure."
Harmony watched as they feasted on their victory, piling their plates and chatting it up. She caught him after dinner in the halls, and passed him a note which explained that they were going to meet in the girls bathroom on the first floor that night. The one with Moaning Myrtle.
The Dark Lord stood over her, twisting the wand that he took from Dumbledore in his long fingers. He flipped the wand up and wood became steel, elongating to a deadly point. "Such beauty," he whispered. Voldemort kicked the body over on to her back, and her neck lolled off to the side. He raised the sword high, poised over her heart. Even though Harmony didn't have a human face, the whites of her eyes shown in shock, and reflected the image of Voldemort swinging the knife down. She gave a low hiss, as Draco shot up.
"Well, as a baby I was magically concealed as male, but now the spell is gone and this is me." She shrugged her shoulders. What else could she say? Maybe scare them and say that she was pregnant.
"I can't," she said at last in a bit of frustration. It was difficult to do, to use her mind like that.
"How much are they?" she asked, drawn to the plain looking rings. She had given most of her money to Ron, and hoped that she had enough. As she looked at these rings, she could imagine the cool gray metal. The old man straightened his back and smiled. He knew that he would probably not sell those rings in his life time. Though he did not look it, he was quick with counting money. He knew that he had given the red headed boy 14 Sickles and 3 Knuts back. So at least he could make that much.
"Not if there is a hawk and a lemur making a ruckus," Luna said, "and who knows, maybe a bear could barge in as well."
"But you look much better as a red-head." He continued quietly. Pleased to see that he had finally coaxed some sort of reaction out of her. "I don't know why you are wasting your time with that Corner fellow, you could do much better than him."
There was something amiss about the place Harmony had drifted to. The air smelled of smoke, and a heavy fog masked the long twisting trees, and blotted out the rising sun. Gusts of oncoming winter caused the trees to groan, and branches whacked against branches. There were no animals, not so much as a bug or a bird in the sky. She followed a cobbled road with an iron fence. Peering through was a stone manor. It was beautifully designed, and had pillars that curved like snakes, ready to engulf the roof. Her feet crunched over brown leaves, over stone steps. She watched the manor as she headed towards the entrance. Everything was too white about it, that the unlit interior made it look hollow. When Harmony stepped through the door, she half expected alarms to go off announcing her. She trespassed unnoticed.
"But," Draco said, "I want to be with you." All at once she felt his chest against her, along with arms that embraced her. She met his direct gaze as he searched her face. A warm hand met her cheek and this touch trailed over the shape of her lips. She pressed her palms to his waist, gripping him. His light caress traced down her jaw and rested to the back of her neck. Her breath caught as he wrapped his other hand behind her back and lowered his head. His lips brushed against hers, tantalizing her by not quite touching her. Delicious warmth tingled her body as he fully claimed her lips. She didn't want him to pull away, and gave a slight protest when he did.
Students were milling about, working their way to the start of dinner. Harmony leaned by the grand doors, allowing countless students to pass her.
One of Snape's eyelids vellicated. He turned to the redhead boy and glared at him, superciliously, down his hooked nose. "Weasley, would you like a detention as well?"
"No Potter, you're not even worthy to fight me." Voldemort kicked the dragon and it reared up, anger making tendrils of smoke seep through its snout. It lumbered her way, tearing out trees, all the while Voldemort watched with piercing red eyes. The dragon over came her easily, and soon the felled trees made a clearing. She had no wand, and Harmony knew that with one bite it would be over.
"Thanks," she said as she felt the warmth that lingered there. Draco slowed to her pace and turned to her. "So, why are you here?" She asked him.
"Ginny, nothing is going to happen, I have no interest in starting a relationship with anyone, male or female. I will be fine." Harmony stuck her chin in the air, attempting to jut out her jaw line in defiance. Which failed to look anything but petulantly cute.
"Excellent," Harmony replied, reaching up to place a hand on his chest. "I know plenty of fun things that a couple of muggles like us could do."
But she was here for Draco, wasn't she? She didn't know why it mattered that she was there, but it did. Harmony caught Ron's disapproving eye from where he sat and smiled. They both knew who she wanted to catch the snitch. Harmony turned to Ginny, and wondered what she thought of Draco being close to her. Harmony didn't think that Ginny hated Draco, but the other girl definitely cared.
He stood there with his arms crossed, and though it was dark, she could clearly see the displeasure he wore. He roughly swept a leaf from his messy hair, and Harmony crept closer to him. There was a loud rumble of a growl, the shriek of a beak, the howl of a lemur, and something like a mew of a cat. "That's not funny!" Draco said, his head turned in all directions, "this game isn't fair." Harmony got closer to him, brushing her head against his leg playfully, and taking a small nip at his robes. "Really, how am I supposed to play hunt with all you predators!"
"Blimey, Malfoy is such a git!" Ron announced to no one in particular. "He can do what ever he damn well pleases, and they all act like it's perfectly acceptable!"
"Guys I am fine," Harmony grumbled. Leighton still had his eyes on Harmony, and Draco could see that he cared for her.
"Yes, what is it?" Came the reply after the door opened. The potions master was hunched over a cauldron that smelled suspiciously like turnips. His black eyes never left the potion.
"Stop it." Ron scolded as his cheeks turned to a flaming red hue, much to the twin's utter glee. They rested an elbow on each side of Ron's shoulders.
Harmony felt the locket and hid it under her shirt. "It's nothing." She ignored Ginny's searching eyes and returned to the window, glad that the white could blind her from her very thoughts.
From under the cloak, Harmony could make out counter tops, sinks, pots and pans. Though she couldn't see, Harmony was glad that they were some place that wasn't, say, in the middle of Voldemort's chamber room. "No one ever goes in here," Dobby said, "none of the masters and Mistresses did." Draco squinted in the dark, and he frowned, not recognizing any thing.
"For the Dark Lord," Draco guessed. The silence that followed was answer enough. "What does he want? Is it something you got from the room?"
"That's none of your concern, but I am here for another reason." His father looked down at him as they conversed, watching Draco for anything. Draco did the same.
"It pleases me to say that a Hogsmeade trip has been scheduled for the weekend. So plan accordingly." Dumbledore paused, awaiting a reaction from the students and seeing their mortification, sat. He didn't realize that his beard had pulled up and exposed more of his undergarments than any student cared to see. When it was clear that he was very much finished, the volume of the room picked up as children began talking simultaneously. Happiness danced upon Ron's face, making him forget elderly unmentionables.
"Oh right, half the fun is watching the Professors rip out their hair or beards, as they look for the evidence to incriminate me, while only having leads to the other houses. I know. But my detentions are lessons for me."
"To help Harmony," Draco said firmly. Severus had not anticipated this. He should have though, Draco was mostly on Harmony's mind. But was Draco safe? He looked at him, trying to read him without intruding. He saw the mistrust there, and knew that they had the same eyes. He nodded his head.
"I can handle boys just fine without your help," she told him, "What, are you scared that I will go after other guys, or something?" She added jokingly, attempting to conceal her unease and erratic emotions.
Harry shrugged her shoulders, not caring. Any bigger and Dudders would be a beached whale. "Wow Dud, I guess there is still hope for us all."
Blaise sat at the Slytherin table and sipped his pumpkin juice, eyeing Draco who had one of those glints in his eyes. Like something brilliant was about to happen, well, terrible for others in most cases. He was about to ask what was up, when something caught his eye. Harry Potter was coming their way, and looking very much like a girl. Wasn't Potter at the Gryffindor table? He looked over and saw the boy wonder get up from where he was sitting. Blaise's jaw went slack. Two Potters?
"That's a load of tripe," Ron replied as he speared three sausages onto his fork. Harmony had not yet experienced one of Snape's infamous detentions. They had it planed so that the detentions served as a cover for their occlumency lessons. She sat with her face planted in her palms.
"But the professor isn't here yet, the bear isn't real." Harmony blasted a stunning spell over her shoulder. Which unfortunately didn't work.
Cedric Digory. Harmony had tried not to think about him all summer. The one who I had lead to death. Never again. I don't want to see their eyes, or hear when they say it wasn't my fault. It was.
As she backed away from the approaching dragon, a branch caught her foot, making her fall. This momentary distraction allowed for the dragon to pounce. It sailed in a perfect arch, claws extended and jaws ready to rip her in half. Harmony could see Voldemort's bliss, right before zoning in on the dragon. It was when they made eye contact that she felt a warmth over her heart. She didn't fear the dragon, or approaching death. She thought of her parents, of Sirius, and finally of Draco before closing her eyes.
"I'm alright, just tired," Harmony said, rubbing her eyes from under her glasses. Ginny took her hand before she could protest.
She found it odd that Draco had changed direction. Now they were heading away from the frozen yogurt, but that's what they had decided on, right? She looked around behind them and saw a familiar wizard just a few feet away. Their stood the newly elected Minister of Magic.
Harmony sat next to Draco on the Hogwarts express in their own compartment, leaning her head against him. Her hair came down in waves to her shoulder, and her tanned hand held his. "Excited for your first day at Hogwarts?" he joked. She smiled back at him.
"I only do Occlomency, not Legilimency." She explained further, "So that Voldemort won't be able to get into my head." That piece of information seemed to bother Draco.
Sirius Black? He hadn't even known that Sirius had a kid. But that made sense. Sirius was a looker back before his stint in Azkaban. "Oh, that explains it." Charlie said. From the corner of his eye, he caught George stifling a snigger and Fred pretending to vomit.
She didn't say anything. Instead, her hands brushed against the back of his neck as she pulled him in. Harmony's lips were on his and this kiss was like none of the others. She kissed him fiercely, again and again, and in-between Draco felt the heat of her breath. He didn't know how long it lasted until it was over and Draco saw Harmony run out with her Firebolt in hand.
"I see, well on behalf of the Ministry of Magic, we are sorry for any inconveniences or harm that may have come to any of you or your immediate family. If you chose, we will escort you to St Mungo's Hospital."
"Yes," she laughed and shot a spell at him. The class was soon to find out that Draco was able to hold his own, by successfully blocking spells wandlessly, and that they fought like they meant it. The other students tried not to imagine what their real fights were like, and watched as Harmony and Draco laughed, enjoying their game.
It was a white dragon with an eye of sapphire that swirled like mercury. The door opened once more and she half expected it to be Draco. Ginny, Ron and Hermione slipped in, and Harmony stuffed the dragon back into her bag. "He didn't do anything to you, right Harry?" Ron asked.
"Potter," came Snape's low growl, "Detention!" Harmony said nothing as she wiped the vanilla, making the brown stain further.
"Harmony," Sirius said, and smiled. She looked at his taught face, at lines that she had not remembered. He did not look so well, and his long black hair appeared wire like. "It's good to see you."
"Oh, my glasses got a bit scratched up when I woke up, so I can manage." He desperately hoped that Hermione would not offer to fix them.
They said goodnight to Luna and continued on a different corridor. Harmony and Ginny walked side by side and just in case, she put on her glasses.
When Draco made his entrance to the common room he made out the two imposing figures. "Crabbe, Goyle!" he called out, they came to his side at once and smiled.
"You mean like on my knees? God, I just got one of those house elves to wash my pants." He chuckled. Harmony's eyebrows twitched.
"Really? And you're talking about Draco Malfoy?" Ron shook his head in disbelief. "I knew your father and there's no way that he would have approved. There are better men out there."
"Ah, now the fun begins." Blaise said, pulling Ginny near. He wrapped an arm around her waist, grinning. Blaise led Ginny inside, turning over his shoulder to ask "you two coming?"
The room was small, much like the size of her room at the Dursleys. It was the color of sand paper with one lone window with the Quidditch field in view. There was the standard desk and bed that she was used to, and to Harmony, it was perfect. She had laid out her meager possessions on the desk and knew that she had to do something with the bare wall.
It was dark. A small boy sat with knees drawn to his forehead. He sat like that most nights under those stairs.
"I am escorting this first year back to her dorm," Draco tried half heartedly. Harmony was tempted to shout in protest at the 'first year' part. She gave a light snort.
When he looked at her, her face looked slightly amazed and then a light pink dusted her cheeks. Draco really wanted to know what she was thinking.
It was crushing her, she could only gasp as she tried to pry the paw off. Why the hell was there a bear here? And why hadn't it ripped her head off yet? The bear's shaggy fur began to recede, and the sent of pine and wood lessened. The force slackened and a hand remained where a paw had been on the wall. She let in a breath before opening her eyes and turning her head to see Leighton's honeycomb colored eyes and grinning smile.
"Severus, you aren't like the other inept fools, you haven't yet failed me." Voldemort stopped to caress his snake Nagini, and the snake looked at Severus, flicking her tongue. "Take off your mask." Voldemort struck the Death Eater mask, leaving Severus's face bare. "What is Potter up to?" Voldemort asked close enough for Severus to smell the rot of unkempt teeth, and Severus's expression remained impassive.
"A ring?" Voldemort asked, as if petrified. "It cannot be." The veins protruded from his face and neck, like black strands of hair on dead skin. "What else?" he demanded.
Luna and Ginny pulled her close, and the sting of parting caught her throat. "This isn't the end," Ginny whispered into her ear, and Harmony tore herself from them without words to betray her. They would fight for her, rallying the students.
"First year, when someone jinxed Harry's broom, Snape was the only professor attempting a counter jinx. And Snape officiated the next match. Third year, back when everyone thought Sirius Black wanted to kill Harry, Snape was never around, and you could always find him patrolling near the Gryffindor tower. Last year-"
"Harry where were you? You missed the entire sorting hat's song," Hermione asked as Harmony sat across from her between Ron and Neville on the extended bench. Ginny eyed her from where she sat a few seats from Hermione.
"The Dark Lord plans to hunt you down. He's going to go to Hogwarts, after you, and it will happen soon." Snape drawled. And seeing Harmony unfazed Snape seethed, "Don't you even care?"
"Yea, I'm fine, just the whole stress with Cedric and Voldermort is really bringing me down." Harry lied through his teeth, but he knew they would buy it. Hermione instantly responded by wrapping her arms around him and he stiffened a bit.
The snowy owl swept out of the open window and Draco followed, high into the air and above the clouds. The rush of the wind and the freedom of the open skies lifted his spirits for the first time since his mother's death.
The timing couldn't have been any worse when Collin made his rounds through the tables, handing out photos. He watched as the small boy with the large camera headed their way, shuffling through his brown bag before extending a hand with an envelope. Draco didn't thank the retreating form of the boy as he stuck the pictures in his bag. His swift retreat was thwarted as Blaise grabbed his arm. "Well aren't you going to open it? Hell, maybe the kid switched the photos up, and you got Ginger and Granger snogging it up. Come on Draco," Blaise said as Draco pushed him off, "we both know that you are dying to gloat about her." Draco glared at Blaise and the boy lifted his hands up in the air. "Alright, alright, I'm done." Draco took a few steps and sighed when he heard Blaise stand up as well and grab some toast.
"That brings back good memories." Snape said in a peaceful tone. Draco wanted to open his eyes to see if Snape really was smiling with such a tone of voice. He had heard that Snape's smile made babies die, and grown men cry.
Harmony wanted to yell in frustration, maybe to even call for help, but she had no idea where she was. Ginny had blindfolded her when she was ambushed in the common rooms. "Your glasses are here in this purse, which you will bring with you." Ginny held up a lavender bag. "It's a good thing that I retrieved your invisibility cloak, and snagged one of your dresses."
She pulled out her wand and slicked her wet hair from getting into her eyes, "who cast that?" she demanded. The laughter increased, and it was as if she were up against most of the Slytherin house. "Ya bloody coward!" They continued walking in the hall, and some of them bumped into her.
"No!" Moaning Myrtle shrieked and jumped to the toilet, which erupted in a splash as the ghost disappeared in the pipes.
"Why can't you ask me properly?" She began to chop erratically, mixing things that were supposed to be separated.
"Yes, but there seems to be a lot of people with air in their heads, and not just at Saint Mungos either." Luna said. Harmony snorted.
"Yeah," Harmony rubbed her eyes from under her glasses, "Hermione has the sense to teach him. I'm gonna see if any one else needs help," she said.
"It is quiet nice and extravagant here," Luna remarked before Kingscross counted to three, and they left. The familiar grounds of Hogwarts were not welcome to Draco's eyes. He didn't look at the others staring at him, and strode out the room, before he had to hear another word to grate against his brain. Tomorrow was the Halloween dance, and when his head hit his pillow, he fell into a fitful sleep.
Draco closed his eyes, and imagined himself shoving the venom in Leighton's stupid face. He opened his eyes, realizing that this could be a test. The others were looking at Leighton oddly, and Draco wondered if one of the Gryffindor saints would volunteer. Bless their souls. Draco looked at Harmony, realizing that she would be the one suicidal enough. Draco felt his arm twitch. He couldn't allow that. Draco could feel the sweat begin to bead on his forehead. Leighton, the turd, was still smiling. His hand was moving, and Draco marveled at its progress. One inch, two inches, it almost left his lap. See, he wasn't a coward, his hand was nearly to his neck. There was still time for Draco to pass his hand off as fixing his hair, but Draco ignored his self preservation. This was for Harmony.
She had been ignoring him as much as she could, but she didn't know what to do about him. Those words on the train that he would make her change her mind hadn't left her. She wouldn't have been so worried about what those words meant, if it was anyone but him. Like it was inevitable. Harmony bit her lip, hoping that he wasn't planning anything. It was worse than a threat.
"Sure," Harmony said, "then I'm glad that at least one of us will know." Harmony lifted her potions book in front of her head, so that maybe Snape wouldn't see her. She glanced at Draco once more, knowing that potions occupied most of his attention. Since the locket had been destroyed, Harmony didn't feel like someone else's emotions were clouding her judgment. It started slowly at first, but she began to feel like she did before the locket. Even before Sirius died. A nervous kind of excitement bubbled inside of her, something which made her mind drift and think of things which she had tried to bury. Like that kiss. She noticed other things about Draco. He didn't stare at her during the Great Hall anymore, not that she paid any more attention to him than what was necessary.
He told Harmony when they were in Magical fitness of what happened to his mother. "She's being held hostage?" Harmony asked as they sat on the bench.
"Yeah, I think that I got the basic first aid. It's hard to practice mending bones when there isn't anything broken to fix."
"We already know how to destroy it, right Ginny." Ginny leaned closer to the girl and held Harmony's hand.
She needed to change back soon, and not be caught inside Hogwarts. She figured that if everyone was outside, then she could find somewhere that no one was. The stair well had to do, and Harmony put on her glasses and stuffed her hat and mittens away before her face was male again. She went to the common rooms and hid Luna's gifts in her suitcase and draped her winter cloak on her bed. All she had to do now was wait for the Gryffindors to come back. She didn't want anyone to suspect her. She sat by the fire as the first students came in.
"Later, let's get out of here first." Harmony said, dropping to her knees to pry out the loose floorboard, pulling out the two wands, the firebolt and her cloak.
"Get a good night's rest," Ginny patted Harmony's messy hair. Harmony looked at Ginny and for a second thought she saw grief from the girl, but Ginny smiled and held her tightly for one more moment before letting go.
The afternoon classes had ended and many of the students lazed about outdoors. There were four more days of schooling until they would be going home for summer break. That was only four more days to learn Potter's secret. Draco desperately wanted to know. He stood outside his favorite teacher's office wondering how to go about and persuade him to obtain that book.
Draco stood from his seat and leaned closer to him, bringing a hand to block the exit. Potter's emerald eyes widened and Draco slipped his other hand to the side of his face and pulled off the stupid looking glasses. "I know what you really are, Potter" Draco whispered close to his ear. Potter's look of complete surprise and then poorly concealed indifference confirmed his suspicions; Potter was a girl after all. Draco smirked triumphantly and noted how she looked a little fearful and confused; he liked that look.
She saw the words that he didn't need to say as she held his gaze as he leaned closer to her. His kiss brought her a small smile that molded to his lips and she only had to stop when her heart rushed till it hurt. She rested onto her pillow and Draco pulled his chair even closer so that he could hold her hand.
Draco followed, just pausing to mention, "Oh and we were never here. If I hear one word otherwise, you'll soon find that you haven't yet encountered the wrong sort of wizard."
"I've already made my choice," Draco said with a cool composure. Death's grip of fear would no longer stop him.
"He is meeting us there, and we will have company soon, you better change." McGonagall said as she got a better look at the girl in front of her. "You look a bit riled up, is the wind strong?"
The heavy smell of dirt mixed with humidity hit him first. There were trees that reached up as far as he could see, with extended branches and leaves that covered the sun. He could still see clear enough, and the others had their necks bent looking up. Something leaped above him, but it was too far to see. "Welcome to Madagascar," Kingscross said smiling, throwing his arms back in the process. An animal was screeching from far above them, and Draco thought that it wasn't so impressive, just a bunch of large trees and little vegetation.
"Harmony, as a friend I want to help you in any way I can, but if that means following your wishes, and allowing something bad happen to you, then I can't do it." Ginny held out her palm to Harmony. "Trust me."
"Stay here, Dobby," she said to the elf, "wait for us." Dobby nodded his head, and they slowly made it to the far corner where a stream of light drifted underneath a door. Their wands were pointed out, and Harmony held the invisibility cloak in her other hand before draping it over them once more. "Where are the dungeons?" Harmony asked.
Harmony returned to blindly watching the moving scenery, trying to regain her tranquility. They had already changed into their Hogwarts robes, and the sky turned inky with purples and oranges. She could still catch the subtle scent that strayed from the unoccupied seat in front of her. It was a mixture of soap, mint, fresh laundry, and something else she couldn't identify.
"Well that rather depends on who you know," Draco said coldly. "Besides, it's not really a difficult matter to stage the death of a couple of muggles."
"You have all lost something this break, and I hope that it does not become irrevocable. Pain comes in many forms, but no matter how small or large pain seems, it is only a moments agony. Pain will pass, if you let it go. Now, where does the solution reside in most venoms?"
"I used to think it did, but now I realize that the gender was not the important part, but what makes the prophecy substantial is you Harry. What you have become. You have a choice to act and save these people, it's a lot to ask for and do."
"No, Harmony," Dumbledore said. "But we will leave this place, we do not want to draw attention to you." It was a small relief, but nothing to be certain of. "I will tell you the details soon, and we will leave tonight." It did not make sense, the less she knew, the less prepared she would be. It was her fight as well, and she wanted to stop Voldemort from killing anymore people. She ate her breakfast in silence.
"I have enough people misunderstanding me," Harmony began, "there is nothing going on between me and Leighton." She put up a hand when it looked like he was going to interject at that. "I am taking these lessons to prepare for war." To her relief he did not say anything snide, instead he nodded his head with a calculating face.
Snape really wanted to intoxicate Malfoy, and the man walked over to Harry who scampered back to his bed. Luckily, Madam Pomfrey didn't force him to down any more potions which would have been a choking hazard. Snape withdrew an orange bottled potion from his robes and dangled it between his long fingers.
"Something tells me that even if I don't allow you here, you will still manage to slip in. Remember those who have joined today, that these lessons are for Cub and for her survival. None of you will use what I teach to harm other students." He looked directly at Draco, who did not blink. "If you fall behind, then you will have to practice if you want to continue. These lessons will not be easy." All of the students nodded their heads. "For the next two months we will begin something new. Step back."
"Yeah Hermione," Harmony laughed, "what happened next, Ron?" Harmony got a good playful smack from the red faced girl. They all laughed, and she remembered what it was like to be with them. "I am happy for you two," Harmony said sincerely.
"Before, I hated his guts. Even more when he started to take notice of you in the beginning of the year. It just infuriated me. He's alright now. He's still obnoxious, but it doesn't matter what I think about him. What matters is what you think."
"And leave you with it?" Draco said while watching the dog. "Hell no." Sirius was taking steps closer while growling. "What's with this dog?" Sirius jumped at Draco, ripping at his robes.
"I'll come back when you are feeling better, and we can talk more in my office." He retreated faster than Harry thought possible for an old man. Harry continued to grumble even during the nurse's rapid assessment, and he was utterly brassed off. He accepted the food given to him, ripped at it and angrily masticated the food when a wave of nausea forced him to slow down.
"I'll get you!" Ginny shouted. Harmony had forgotten that the girl knew the snowball chasing spell, and soon a ball of snow hit the back of her head, knocking the glasses from her face. She grabbed a fistful of snow and aimed it at Luna. The girl hopped away, and Harmony caught a snowball that Ginny had thrown.
"Shh," someone said in the glowing dark, "he has super hearing, he can hear you." She was tempted to say that he had could read their every thoughts, but knew that she would be berated if she did. Draco took the list from her hands and read off what they were supposed to get.
"When I saw you at Hogsmead with that girl, I thought you were just playing her. Fooling around with her heart. Have you fallen into your own trap, Draco?" Draco laughed at him.
Because you're crazy. Draco eyed the water like venom when Luna placed it into his hands. Anyone could slip it in a drink, and poison someone. It would happen so fast. "Draco," Leighton said, "it seems like you know why."
"I love you," was what he said. Draco didn't know who was more surprised at the words, Harmony or himself.
"Sure, if we could think of a way to sneak off without your mum and six brothers finding out and murdering us."
Then the visions clouded her. There was nobody but herself, in the darkness. Hogwarts and her friends were gone. Nothing, just an emptiness. The eyes opened in the black, and she knew that Tom Riddle was there. Give up, she heard, you will fail. There is no love for somebody like you. Something twisted at her hand, and scratched her body. Overwhelming sorrow mingled with hate flooded her senses. She couldn't do anything as something twisted around her body. She chocked on her own loneliness as arms and vines looking like snakes grappled with her. There was no noise, not a sound came from her lips. She was torn, torn from the snakes and dropped to the floor.
"It's k" Harmony whispered, and the young man tending her lifted both of his hands in a peaceful gesture and backed away. Sirius cautiously nosed the girl and his eyes were unreadable hollow pits.
"Really, it's abbreviated as Sex for the Magical Education, X-rated, " He laughed at her priceless face of horror.
"Hurry," she said, and went about to pry the locket from Harmony's hand. Draco ran through the tunnels, and his feet clamored against the damp stone tiles. He didn't stop to catch his breath, and followed the path leading to the main chamber. An expanse of room opened up and pillars of snakes met the ceiling and threw shadows across the ancient chamber. The skeleton of the Basilisk reared through the room and Draco reached for one of the fangs from its mouth and tore it off.
"I've been here before," Harmony muttered as they passed door after door. Some were open, and they could see uninhabited chains against the walls. She wondered how anyone could have a dungeon in their house, with people screaming to be let out.
Had he miscalculated? No that wasn't possible. He scrutinized them. When both Potters hugged, he saw that male Potter was an inch taller. He looked at the boy's feet and saw the two inch heeled boots, and then went to Harmony's flats. When Harmony took off her coat, she wore a clinging shirt. Potter, on the other hand, was obviously wearing a bunch of layers. At least five, he estimated. Their voices were remarkably similar, Harmony's just a tad softer. But there was no hiding those same eyes and hair.
"Let's keep in touch." Harmony added before walking off to finish her letter (which Charlie didn't know was to a dragon of a different sort.)
"Leave me alone!" Tears hung from her eyelashes. He tried again to hold her, but she would have none of him. "I said don't touch me." She said harshly, and looked behind him to where his father was.
"Voldemort killed everyone I care about. I don't have to do this. I want to," she reminded herself. As long as Voldemort lived, death would follow her. Harmony could never hide for the rest of her life, knowing that Voldemort was out there, murdering and tearing the world apart.
Harmony went through the halls, passing the Ravenclaw and Slytherin banners. It was near impossible to forget that the match was today, and even though she wasn't playing that day, Harmony felt the excitement build in her. She joined Ginny at the Gryffindor table and pooled her plate with toast. "I'm glad we're not playing today, the weather would have frozen me off my broom," Harmony said. The room was chattering loudly, and Harmony wondered why a quidditch game was brining such a fuss up.
"Yes," he said slowly, "your face." She felt her cheeks, wondering if some stray crumb was left from dinner. "It's bad enough to see it in class. Change it." It didn't take longer then three seconds as she understood him and dropped the magic from around her face. Harmony felt awkward as he scrutinized her further.
"I think nothing is wrong with him. I think he just wants to flirt with Harry here. Half the Hogwarts population wants to anyway, even the male ones." Came a voice from behind a glossy page.
"This scar somehow connects me to Voldemort," she shrugged her shoulders. Draco looked deep in thought.
"Yes it's Potter, I mean Harry Potter. I found him passed out in the halls." Madame Pomfrey frowned at the prompt and hardly believable story.
"Oh, then can I have your number?" Malcolm asked with a toothy grin. Harry rolled her eyes at his hopeful look.
The moment that the dungeon lights extinguished, Draco knew that Professor Snape had returned. Outside Snape's office, Draco rapped swiftly on the frame and entered. "Professor," he said, "may I have a word?" It didn't mater that Snape still wore his traveling cloak, or that the man was overdue on his lunch.
Her hands crumpled the thick parchment and she took off her glasses to rub her eyes. The only plus was that Dudley was out with his gang and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were leaving her be. Her temporary room felt so stale and stuffy. The window was open but that didn't do much to ventilate the air. Not to mention she had no air conditioner and the day would only grow hotter. She changed her shirt to that of a thinner one and hopped into her only pair of graying shorts. The park would do her good.
"I don't see why they give us so many stupid tests," Ginny said, "before break." Luna laughed at the magazine she was holding then let it fall to the table.
"I know that you are looking at that bracelet there, and I think that she will love it." Ron stared at the gold coins that were being offered to him, and he shook his head.
Blaise led them through a house that could have easily fit the Burrow eight times over. He stopped in front of glass sliding doors that seemed strangely misted over, pulling them open to reveal an indoor pool.
"Really, you can't be seen by anyone," Harmony said, "and when you hear the door of this room open, make sure before you show yourself that it's me." Sirius looked down at the girl and nodded.
"What rubbish is this?" he asked and he heard another click. A new image took its place of women talking excitedly.
"Draco..." Harmony murmured, as if the word slipped out of her unintended. He looked into her eyes and read the confliction there. That was enough. It was all he needed to see. Three short steps and she was in his arms, and he was holding her against him. At that moment she was the only thing that existed.
"Well first I heard you coming down the hall, so I stood by the door under an invisibility charm. Simple. So how have you been with shifting your face?" Harmony gave a wide smile before her face reverted back to that of a girl.
"Do you not feel anything?" their professor asked. Draco did feel comfortable here, but he was reluctant to go further. This wasn't where his animagus form lived.
"Harmony, how many lessons do you have with Snape?" Ginny said quietly as they took two empty armchairs in the common room. The room was empty, save for a few 7th years snogging in a dark corner.
"I know that I have such an enthralling mind, but I hoped that you learned something." They looked at each other, and Draco could almost see her thoughts flit from behind her eyes. They were rather green and inviting and Draco was tempted to drift into her thoughts and learn more about her.
She huffed in relief when the front door didn't swing open and push her off into the hard concrete. "Is that a flying carpet, Professor?" she asked with amusement.
The spell on Harmony dropped as she stared at Mr. Malfoy. She did not gain the satisfaction she thought she would have. She felt hollow and as she stumbled to Sirius. Her body was drained. "Sirius," she whispered and put a hand on his chest. A part of her still hoped, but she knew. Knew that the very last part of him was leaving, and he would be dead.
"Well, I happen to like them, but you will find out in good time. Now how have you been concealing your appearance? Polyjuice? Charms? Potions? Face Creams?"
"That's why I like you, Draco. I'm so glad that you don't hang out with Crabe and Goyle anymore, I couldn't stand the way they stank."
Lucious offered his hand, which Draco took, and he felt the familiar tug at the core of him, as his father apparated. They appeared with a crack amidst the hustle of the hospital, as green robed wizards and witches with face masks scattered about.
"Why are you two even asking Harry what happened? You've already overheard it from the meeting last night." This time Hermione turned red.
"At maximum till you would be twenty. You would also regrettably be much less developed than others your age." This didn't make sense.
"Nope, but that can easily be fixed." Harry wished that she was still sleeping so that she could sick a few dementors on him, just to frighten the boy. She instead rolled her eyes. At least he didn't know that it was her. Dudley must have a whole collection of pick up lines or something and she wanted to be spared from his sorry attempt.
But her mind drifted to the Slytherin table, to where Draco Malfoy sat. He had been acting so strange last night. She too as well. Who knew that she would have danced with him, and like it. That she played it over and over in her mind. She could almost feel the warm chain mail of his shirt, the hands that had brought her closer to him. She could see the gray of his eyes behind the metallic of his mask, the shape of his lips, his small smile. Draco was on the tip of her tongue, and it took all of her effort to not turn around and watch him. She wanted to know how he was, what made him leave so abruptly.
It was bloody perfect. He knew that his girl had a bit of a thing for her friend. Some lingering feelings for what used to be Harry Potter. He knew that it would only take some gentle persuasion, perhaps the right circumstances to bring them to the surface.
"Hello dear, is something the matter?" Pomfrey said as she strode past rows of house-elf clean medical beds. She stopped, taking in the scene of a very unconscious Harry Potter, carried in the arms of a very conflicted looking Draco Malfoy. (It was a good thing Draco did not bring Harry in ten minutes earlier, spasmodically twitching with his eyes rolled back) "Good heavens!"
"What the bloody 'ell is going on in here?" Harmony asked. Fletcher gave a wide grin and lifted both of his hands.
"What do you mean, my lord?" Severus asked coolly. The room seemed too small to contain a wild beast. The curtains were drawn, books spilled over the floor, and there were cracks and holes in the walls. Voldemort looked at Severus as if he wanted to strike the man.
"You know, Harry started trusting Draco about half a year before he disappeared. The two of them were acting really strangely. Hanging out with one another...Staring at one another." Hermione said. Harmony met her gaze steadily. "I have another question for you." Hermione continued, "are you Harry?"
He heard giggling and looked up. Ginny was brushing wet strands away from Harmony's face. Her hands went to the back of Harmony's neck pulling her close.
"Things change, and people grow up," Harmony said, "and I'm not asking you to be his friend, just don't judge everybody!"
"Dash," Harmony corrected herself, "where is Dash?" The Professor pointed above his head, where there was an upside down girl with long hair who hung from the rafters. His pointing hand waved to her.
When Draco returned to his bed, he stared at the ceiling of his bed post, unable to close his eyes without seeing them together again. When light seeped through the drawn curtain, Draco gave up the idea of sleep and changed to go fly. On a broom, Draco could forget. He could allow the wind to sweep him away and the cold to numb him. As he swerved by the bleachers, Draco flattened himself and became a black streak against the dawn. He closed his eyes, and did not allow fear to cloud him. A faint mist swirled around him and Draco slowed his pace. As his breaths came in short films of vapor, Draco lifted his head to watch the pinks melt into oranges over the horizon.
"Yeah, that'd make it a lot easier to sneak in," Harmony said. Harry took them to different entrances, and told her the best ones to go through and where they ended up to. After the third one, Blaise looked at him in something like respect.
"Why? So he can watch me suffer." Harry stared pointedly at his Potions Professor who in return sneered.
She was sucking on an ice cube when she heard a load crack to her far right. Harmony reacted instantly, pulling out her wand and crouching low under the table. After a few moments of silence, nothing still moved. She was tempted to hide in the café store, but figured that it would be more dangerous during night. She bit down on the ice cube, cracking it in half. Harmony crept through the side of the café towards the back further, away from the apparation. If she had been able to use magic she may have investigated, but she knew the Ministry wasn't too hot for her.
"We'll come again," Hermione said and led Ron out of the room. Ron, still unsure of what to do, frowned. When the door closed behind the two, Harmony let out a breath.
"You fly well," Harmony said and shrugged before leaving. She didn't want him to know how much she had admired him.
She turned her attention to the land below her, and saw the beauty there. The white of the snow covered the tree branches, and grass fields. They went over the lake, nearly skimming the black surface. Harmony went faster on her firebolt, passing Draco. She leaned on the handle, making herself flat. Faster. She was over the forest now and dodged trees that stuck out. She could hear the whistle of air in her ears, and the faint sound of Draco behind her. The cold air struck her face, and she welcomed it.
"Well if you two have been trying a year, then it's obvious nothings going to happen," Charlie retorted, annoyed at the jab about the old man.
"Good Morning, class," Leighton's voice boomed throughout the room, ending all side conversations. He stood firmly in the center of the room eyeing each student. Harmony lifted her head along with a few students who sat up a bit straighter. From one of the cloths that he held he pulled out large handle with a chain at the end, connected to the chain was a large spiked metal sphere." I understand," he said as he lifted the mace well above his head and progressed to swing it in long circles, "that you've covered dueling, magical creatures, and forbidden curses."
"You look a bit flustered," Ginny whispered, and Harmony snorted. She had most definitely not been thinking about a shirtless Draco.
"The Dark Lord's revival went awry, and now his body is incomplete. He believes that if he reclaims the fragments of his soul, then his body will be whole again." Draco could tell that the older man was withholding something from him.
Snape was glowering at some first year potion essays when Harmony came to his door. He frowned at the girl, and not from his usual pretense. She stood at his office awkwardly. "What is it?" he asked her in a drawn out voice, as if it took his whole breath to say those three short words.
He didn't love Harmony. No, he didn't really know what love was. But he needed her. It was worse than terrible, but he cared for her, enough that it didn't bother him that she was Harry Potter. He laughed at himself. What was he becoming? He used to be so bad arse. She had changed him.
"School will end in two more days my girl, and all of the professors are willing to excuse you for missing work."
"There's no point in you all fighting, she has a boyfriend already." Ginny snapped at them, sobering up the mood in the room. Charlie's face fell before he could stop himself.
"It's from Master." Kreacher's eyes were glued to the locket, as if it nothing else in the world mattered.
"I don't really know how, I just woke up here." They both looked skeptical at his response. "Don't you guys have some more classes?"
"Well it was nice seeing you again Leighton." Harmony laughed, and Leighton winked at her, as he and Candice walked into a little store called Honey Bee Bakery together.
"I think she's waking up," Luna said and brushed away the girl's bangs. Harmony's eyes fluttered open and she sat up.
"Their eyes won't leave me." Harmony whispered. Ginny walked over and pulled Harmony into her arms. "These feelings… maybe something is controlling me. Ginny, I just don't know who I am anymore, like I'm just split." Ginny just kept on holding her. Harmony didn't know how long she cried there.
He couldn't see Harmony's eyes, but could still practically read the words that must have been floating around her pretty head. She was going to be a human sacrifice. She was going to die for him. "No, Harmony, don't." He said. This couldn't be happening. He couldn't lose his mother and his girlfriend on the same day.
Ginny laughed at her. "I would bet ten galleons that Professor Snape luves you," Ginny pushed her from where they sat, "Now hurry up before the rest of the girls come pouncing in here."
"14 Sickles," the old man said, "but usually I would charge more." Ron happily handed the old man his change, feeling good that Harmony had enough for it. The old man pulled some wrapping paper from a pocket in his apron, and the gift wrapped itself.
He rechecked his list before answering. "There is one more, but…It's not really recommended for males, in fact the last recorded guy to take the course was the Head Master Dumbledore."
Harmony went to a little sandwich shop first for a small lunch before making her way to the dim little book shop labeled "Bound Pages". She had never been in that store besides last night and saw that it was a bit stuffy and uninviting. The door opened with a jingle from a graying bell held above the door. Harmony stepped into Hermione's dream heaven, shelves upon selves of book meet the ceiling all a variety of sizes, colors, and conditions. There were even couches and benches where people could read and relax.
"You may learn something if you actually paid attention, Sly," he said. Draco had started using that instead of Potter whenever they were in class.
"Why did the Dark Lord break into the Ministry of Magic?" Harmony asked, mindful not to say Voldemort.
"What has gotten into you?" He shook his head as if in denial, "there are rumors that you are friends with Potter." He spat out the last word with disgust.
"What's all this for, er, professor?" Harmony asked as she directed a finger to the walls of weaponry. She did not want to know if he would somehow torture the kids in detention.
"Thanks Harmony," Ginny said as she turned to the door, "It means a lot to me. Alright, I think you are set, I'll see you on the dance floor." The girl left and Harmony sat on her bed, excited for the next hour to pass. She cursed as she realized that she couldn't just walk out of her room. she got out her invisibility cloak, only to realize that she didn't have anything to put it in. She couldn't just stuff it into her school bag and go to the dance floor with it bumping against her back.
"Anywhere else cold?" he asked her, and within seconds, heat swelled through her. With difficulty she swallowed.
"Obviously not culinary class for you then," Draco said a bit perturbed. They went along other classrooms.
"Thank you Ronald," Leighton said. For the remainder of class, Draco tried not to think. He didn't pay attention to what the other students were happy about. Once Leighton ended class, Draco was out the door and pushing past the others.
Draco regarded him lazily and explained in a blasé manner, "The Dark Lord used the manor as his base, and certain magic needs to be cleared from it before my home is safe again." He leaned back against the leather seat and watched as the students dragged luggage out of the common room.
Wizard dancing with Sirius was much better than when they were learning to Ball room dance during the Triwizard tournament. Sirius knew all of the regulated moves and could teach her to spin around and know the proper steps at the right beat. By the end of the afternoon they looked like a decent pair, and he was able to show her some of his own moves that were fun to mimic.
"Horcruxes," Severus repeated, and Voldemort glared at him, "so if the missing parts of you were to become whole once more, then your body too."
"Alright," she said, tipping her broom at a soft angle. Another wind swerved her left, and taught muscles strained as she steadied her broom. They were at a safe distance to the ground and were able to soar almost parallel to the forest.
"Alright, now, we don't want to lose anybody. On the count of three. One. Two. Three!" Draco latched onto the tiny key, with his index finger and thumb grasping the thin metal. He had closed his eyes so that he wouldn't get disoriented from the spinning colors, and when they reopened, they were all situated in Kingcross's office. "Now the next one!" Leighton pointed to a torn book cover, and before they could fully regain their balance, one, two, and three was shouted out, and desperate hands gripped the portkey.
"Let's go to class," Harmony said as she slung her bag over her head, allowing the weight to shift on the convenient hollow of her waist. They walked undisturbed the entire way to potions.
"I hope you all are familiar with your animal instincts, because we will be going on an adventure," the Professor paused, "Well, multiple ones." The students shared four concerned glances, making him smile reassuringly. "It will be fun." They weren't convinced.
"Exactly," the headmaster replied, "when the blood drawn from Harmony was used to resurrect Voldemort, he drew too the magic that was infused in her blood. The magic that I cast onto her, so strong that it changed her gender completely. But it is different for Voldemort, instead of masking his gender, it is reacting in a most surprising manner. Making Voldemort into a woman. But it is a dangerous and painful process for him."
"Professor Snape can make a counter potion that will negate the effects." Dumbledore noticed Harry's defectiveness. "I know that you find it hard to trust him, but I believe in him, I would entrust him with my very life." Harry looked into his eyes and there was only remorse that reflected back at him.
Harmony's eyes opened and she jolted from her bed. The darkness contorted around her and she flinched from the hand holding her. Where was she? She looked into Ron's eyes. Cold sweat trickled down her scalp, and her heart raced. She brought her hands to her head, and cradled her body. "Harry!" Her scar burned and she thought that she could smell smoke. She let out a shallow breath as she repeated to herself that she was in the dormitory. Ron wasn't a figment of her imagination.
"Didn't I tell you not to use that nick name," she hissed at him, well aware of his friends eyeing her and listening to her every word.
"Yes, but Voldemort did not hear that far. That was why I asked your parents not to tell of your birth or gender to just anyone. I was unsure if the prophecy would apply to you, since you were a girl, and because there was another with similar circumstances, Neville Longbottom."
She steadied her broom, glaring at the Dark Lord, and felt her disgust mount. The dragon's scales shimmered the color of midnight and spikes aligned its back, making Harmony wonder how she was sitting without being skewered. Rows of teeth smiled back, gleaming wet with saliva and venom, ready to take an arm from her, in its thin, elongated body. In the dragon's eyes she could see her reflection,dripped with the color of blood and she clenched her wand tight. "Ah, Potter," Lady Voldemort smiled viciously, "it's so nice to see you." Harmony could feel the power behind the dragon's wings as the wind unsteadied her, and all she could think was, oh, not again.
"True," Ginny laughed, "hey, I know you think boys are 'revolting', but what do you think about Dean Thomas?"
"Er. You look great too," she said and watched as his smile grew as his eyes lowered to the dragon necklace.
"So, you're saying that the tiara was part of the Dark Lord's soul?" Snape nodded his head. "That's mental. So if parts of the Dark Lord's soul are destroyed, then he will never be fully restored, right?"
"Oh and before I forget, another 40 points from Gryffindor." Snape ambled over to see the wreckage for himself. He waved his wand to clear most of the potion off of Draco's face. "And escort Malfoy to the washroom without blowing anything else up." Harmony quickly shot up, extinguishing the fire below the cauldron. They walked from the back of the room with questioning stares passing their way.
"Leighton," Harmony's voice was soft and tickled him, as if she was whispering in his ear. "do you know a lot about dark objects?" Draco heard Leightion's rough laugh.
"Again," Harmony gasped out and Draco lifted an eyebrow, "on brooms this time." Draco smiled at the challenge.
"Professor," Draco said, "What if she tried to go into my mind, and see how I block my thoughts, then maybe it won't be so bad." Snape seemed to regard him with interest. He put his fingers to his chin and brushed his long fingers to his black hair.
Which did indeed happen, but not in the context brought from Draco's hand. Dumbledore stood from his chair gaining the attention of the present students. The winsome dotard took a brisk look to his lower robes, and to the student's delight, they were in place. He cleared his voice for effect as well as taking in a deep breath. "I am pleased to announce," he began as the students' eyed the pink fluffy sleeping cap atop Dumbledore's head, "that in celebration for Halloween, there will be a masquerade party for all students." A hoot of cheer came from the mass of students, and realizing that he was being ignored and that his tea was brewing for ten seconds too long, he abruptly sat down. The teachers had matching nit brows; save for Leighton who looked to be too busy enjoying his honey smeared pancakes.
"Perhaps, not knowing will be better," Severus grumbled, but he shook his head. He knew that was wrong. "What would you like to know?"
"Thank you professor," Draco said. Draco looked back to where his father could have caught up with him, but there was no one watching in the shadows. Draco leaned against Snape as they walked back to the room.
At least she wasn't wearing the locket, like last time. That had been too unbearable for the both of them. Her anger had made her susceptible to his attacks, till she had left humiliated and exposed. She felt marginally in control compared to then, and hid what she could. She didn't know if he was impressed or just glad that they were getting somewhere after the months of her failing at it pathetically.
"I know a good one Draco." He looked over and Theodore Nott gave him a wicked grin. "It's called the Curse of the Septicemic plague."
"Alright," she met his grin with her lips, "you can be with me, so long as it's when I'm not looking like the boy who lived." Draco pulled her into a hug and touched her short cropped hair. She couldn't believe that being with someone could bring her such joy. The tightness in her chest returned as she felt him against her with his warm palms now brushing her back. Their lips joined and Harmony still had to reach up as they kissed. She was almost surprised that the lip gloss wasn't all over him and she thanked Ginny in her mind.
"Very good Cub," Leighton said, "an insect indeed, but a noble insect nonetheless. No further questions. Because the mind is the key to catch your power animal, concentration is important. Now put these blindfolds on."
"It's ok, Ron, we're working together now." Harmony found the jar of chicken blood and emptied some in a flask. "This smells revolting," Harmony passed it to Draco, "you hold it." Draco took it and fastened a cork into the flask.
"Thank you," she said to them, "Er, thanks so much." She was so glad that she could have a proper birthday, where no one beat her up or cursed her existence.
"Your father is protecting her," Harmony said, "and if anything else happens, we'll go and save her." He didn't think that they could stand up to the Dark Lord, but he wanted to.
"I thought I heard a rat behind me," Harmony said, "but I was mistaken, it was you." Draco grinned down at her, and chuckled.
His room was sparse, neat and orderly. There wasn't anything so telling about the boy, except for the fact that it was a tad too dark. All of the furniture was either black or green, and Harmony especially wanted to take down the skull engraved into the wood. He closed the door and Harmony could tell that he rarely, if not ever, had people over. It didn't feel like a room, kind of like the room she had at the Dursleys. "You could use some decorations," she said.
She had not expected to see him, not so soon at least. Draco Malfoy opened the sliding door without so much as a knock and looked passed the distrusting faces of her friends to a very disgruntled looking Harry Potter. Thankfully, she didn't get the urge to stare at his lips and wish for something more. Instead a cool dread permeated through her, and she sat frozen against the glass.
"Why do you have these?" Lucius asked quietly, with a calm that Draco did not trust. Draco didn't answer, keeping his face impassive, revealing nothing. He didn't have to. "It's that girl isn't it?" Draco looked at the faint scar on his father's cheek, a remnant of Harmony's wandless magic. "So you dress like a muggle now. What else has she convinced you to do?" Lucius continued, staring at his son as if he had never seen him before.
"Alright," Leighton looked at the mouse, "I'd think all of those spells would give it a heart attack. What would you do if that happened?" It looked like Draco wanted to throw the mouse at the eighteen year old's face in response.
One thing she liked was roaming the shops on Diagon Alley, looking in the Quidditch shop, gift shop, and book stores. It was a nice change not having people point at her while walking and whispering madly to each other, like they were nibbling ears. She could not ignore the daily prophet so well though. She still made the front page, minus the dress and girly looks. The worst was seeing the Wizarding World's reaction to the Daily Prophet's slander. Most of them sneered at seeing her boy face in the paper. They were all so fickle, believing her to be a savior and then discarding her when she brought bad news.
"Oh! Well then, I hope that she looks like a toad then, right Harry." Ron corrected himself. Harmony nodded her head and closed her eyes. She was much too glad when the two left her to close her eyes and wait for the train ride to end.
"Harry!" she waved, and scrambled out of her seat to give Harry a bear hug. The boy smiled at her and hugged her back. Now the Slytherins had their attention as the boy wonder stood at their table. He could almost see the growl on Pansy's face and the hate on Theodore. Harmony seemed oblivious to the onlookers, and Draco smirked as he saw the glare on Harry's face that he shot over her head. "I haven't seen you in ages!".
"I saw you with her, over the summer," he said angrily pointing at Harmony, without looking at her. He couldn't stand to look anywhere else. "And I see you once more, without your disguise, with her no less! Say, what are you doing with these girls, way after school hours, in such an illicit kind of gathering where God knows what could be happening. You are deceiving everyone, and none of the student's parents would like to hear that you, looking like a 7th year, are our professor. When my father and the press hear about how this school is run, then its over for you, Sir!" Draco ended with a hiss of mock respect.
Pain seared her scar, as the touch upon her skin became corrosive. She looked up in shock, into the swirling blood eyes. Ropes held her body to a gravestone. "You are mine."
Ginny kept giving her strange looks, and Harmony unconsciously felt for the locket under her shirt. She was a taught string with fraying threads, sooner or later something had to give. She probably could have made it all the way to Hogwarts, if Draco hadn't appeared, that is.
Ginny ran to the Dark Forest, passing the body of Mad Eye, centaurs, and other people that she didn't have time to identify. She couldn't think about death right now.
A gasp could be heard as Petunia stuck her long face over the banister. "Don't Vernon!" she called out.
"Sure that will work," Harmony replied, "except for the fact that the man hates me." Ginny scrunched closer, squishing Neville who was between them. She pulled at Harmony's collar, forcing them inches apart behind Neville's back.
Draco dropped his wand to the ground and brushed dark hair away to check Potter's temperature. The touch radiated a burning heat and Draco lifted an eyebrow as he looked at Potter. The dorky glasses had come off and it was like looking at him for the first time. Draco could make out the scar that contrasted against the blanched skin, the eyelashes that were much too long for a boy, and the slightly parted full lips that just made him want to laugh at how ridiculous Potter was. Even Potter's skin was soft and smooth, and Draco shook his head. No way should a boy look so effeminate. Sure Draco knew that he himself had devilishly good looks proving that someone up there loved him more than those common peasants, but at least that someone had gotten his dishy looks with his gender right.
Harmony felt the magic, seductively flitting across her mind, compelling her to move forward. "Fuck you," she hissed. His eyes narrowed.
"Then you let this thought or memory fill you up." He knew which memory. Their kiss still made his face relax, made his heart pump harder. She gave a little smile, and Draco watched her lips intently. "Then you say."
"I found out what I wanted, and I was also able to accept me." Draco took a breath, "As well as the parts that I couldn't allow myself to acknowledge." There was unmistakable sincerity in his voice. And it was like Harmony could see Draco's thoughts through their eye contact, his fears and his adventure from last night. And there was an outline of a small animal.
Harmony had a good laugh about it for a few days, going to all of her classes with a smile, and Harmony felt excited about the upcoming Valentine's day dance. When the day finally came, Harmony locked herself in her room, trying on the meager amount of dresses she owned. She didn't want to look like a fool in a dress. She had a couple from the summer, but as she threw each one into a corner, her eyes began to drift to the one Ginny had given to her for Christmas. At first it had embarrassed her to wear it, because it hugged her body and was rather short. The stretchy material of the silver dress reflected the light and shimmered.
The ferret lifted a paw, and continued on, scampering faster now. They were heading up a few flights, and she had to carry it, when it nearly fell through the faulty step. "You better be leading me someplace, and not just getting us lost." The ferret stopped suddenly, and brought its nose along the wall. Harmony doubted that many students traveled this hall, if any. There was not much, but Harmony did amuse herself by watching a portrait of trolls receiving ballet lessons. The ferret was going back and forth along the walls three times now. Harmony was surprised to see a little door that she had overlooked, and the ferret pushed against it, and disappeared from sight. It was much too small for her, and as she crouched to fit into the tunnel like space, her shoulders hit the walls. She could see light from the other end, and the smell of flowers. "What the?"
"To hell if I know," Harmony shrugged, "they'll think he hates me and that I really didn't give a damn about his class. I don't care so much either way."
"Alright," Draco stood up, and the locket returned to his neck, "So long as you're happy. Anyway, we should destroy this locket soon, it's bloody annoying company."
Harmony became more aware to her surroundings. She felt Malfoy's reluctance to let her go in the way that his arms tightened around her. Heads were craning to get a better view. She began to turn a ruddy hue, as color swept back across her checks. At last her breathing stabilized. Spilled octopus ink seeped into her pants leg, and the smell of putrid embalmed chickens hit her nose. Draco propped her in a sitting position, where she put her palm to her scar to ease the throbbing ajena. "I-Er," she tested her vocals, her voice came out scratchy and raw. "I was clumsy professor, and knocked into a shelf I didn't see."
The smile warped into something cruel. "Malfoy's do not back down," Draco told the image of his mirrored self, "they re-strategize". On his way down to the Great Hall, the younger Slytherines steered clear from Draco, as if they felt his strange cheer, or at least heard him laughing to himself. In fact, Draco was in a terrific mood. And that meant something wicked was to come.
They spent the next few days working on different routines and styles of dance. Sometimes Snape would watch and berate Sirius for dancing like an inept monkey. She didn't mind so much being the girl in the dances, and being lead around in circles. It had been much the same as dancing at the Yule ball at any rate.
"Really?" Draco said wrapping his arms around her, "well I know something muggles like us could do right now." And with that said, he kissed her, tasting the sweetness of her for the first time in a month. He looked down at her curiously, as she pulled away from him.
"Dumbledore thinks that you should be watched," Sirius lead her to the cave entrance, and Harmony rolled her eyes.
He killed her to be beautiful, but the fine blond arches, and silky hair looked appalling, like make up plastered on a monster. She felt revulsion clench through her and Harmony hunched up, ready to strike. The door burst open and Death Eaters stopped as they witnessed their Lord. Lucious Malfoy dropped to his knees in horror.
"And who wants birthday cake!" Mrs. Weasley exclaimed enthusiastically, distracting everyone and shooting Harmony a dirty look.
"Detention!" Snape shouted from where he sat, "Potter and Malfoy for unnecessarily speaking!" Many of the students did a double take when Draco's name had been called, and Draco looked on with disbelief.
"I'm glad," she bit her bottom lip as she smiled. She would have thought it all impossible to believe, but as she kissed him, it was hard to imagine anything else. No one else would taste like him, act like him, or make her feel this barmy. It scared her for a second, that someone could elate her so, and that it had been Draco Malfoy no less. But it subsided as her heart beat faster, and she couldn't deny her jumbled fervor.
This winter holiday break would be the first time since June that Harmony was apart from Draco. Harmony told herself that she wasn't one of those girly girls. She knew that she didn't need a man around all the time. So when the invitation to spend the winter with the Weasleys came, Harmony took it without a second thought. Draco could have uninterrupted time with his father, she could have uninterrupted time with Ginny, and everyone would be happy.
"You're getting lots of attention though," Ginny said, and Harmony saw that many heads and fingers were pointing her way. She shrugged her shoulders. "They're calling you the Hogsmead girl, and Draco's girlfriend."
"My God!" Harmony nearly shouted, "Where's Ginny!" Harmony, Luna, and Draco looked between their feet to the ground below. There was no way that she could have survived. They then looked up, and Ginny was no where. Draco could picture the red head reaching out for the ledge of the cliff, and her arms snapping when she made contact. It wasn't a pleasant image. "Leighton!" she screamed, "Ginny's gone!" Draco was surprised to see the fear in Harmony's eyes. It didn't make sense to him.
"Nah, then I wouldn't be a mystery. Bye boys." She left them and walked out the entrance to be joined by Dudley and some very annoying cat calls from his gang.
Albus Dumbledore arose from his chair, tugging his beard free from where it got stuck in his lower robes. He readjusted the blue silk with magical dignity and cleared his voice.
"Almost," Ginny nodded, "which means that there is still light." They shoved their books in their bag, and Harmony, Ginny and Luna pulled on their warm stuff and jumped into the snow. "The wind is perfect!" she shouted, "Milvus!" A yellow kite trailed from the end of her wand and shot into the sky. Harmony and Luna sprung kites from their own wands and ran ankle deep in snow. A light flurry sprinkled their hair and Harmony balled snow in her gloves. She chucked it at Ginny, and sped off.
"It's hard to explain…" she tried and brushed fine hairs away from her eyes. His gaze was still on her, waiting. "I picture what I want in my mind and project the image through magic onto my face."
"Brains aren't balloons," Harmony said while writing her potions essay on the mixing properties of fungus and mildew. Meaning that she was just making it up. She doubted that Snape would read it. He would take one look at it and say, 'What is this? This looks like a chicken dipped its talons in ink and did the cha cha over it!'
"Harry Potter." They both jumped in their seats as someone stepped from behind a bookshelf. Harmony hissed as a trail of hot chocolate ran down her leg, and she glared at the Headmaster.
"Really? I had no idea." He said in a mock sincere voice and moved an inch from the door. He really was asking for it.
"Do you even KNOW what you're talking about? Are you going to let him CONTROL you like this?" Ron and Hermione just stared. "You don't even know what he's DONE TO ME!"
Harmony went to her closet and pulled down what jewelry she had. She owned the wooden carving of a doe, some string bracelets, and a dragon necklace. She picked up the dragon and slipped it over her head. "That looks sexy," Ginny said, "it's a good length too." The dragon's tail curved and ended a few inches above her sweetheart dress. She would have thought the dress low for her taste, but it didn't show anything too revealing. Harmony smiled at the mirror and Ginny handed her one last thing. "This is lip gloss," she said, "you can have it." It glittered like the rest of everything she was wearing, and Harmony wondered if this was a tad too shiny, like she was an ice sculpture.
"You are a girl, deal with it," Ginny said, "I'll just make it shiny." Ginny filed her uneven nails and painted them. She pointed to her feet and Harmony frowned.
"I am busy," Snape said through clenched teeth. He saw her disappointment, and he nearly bit his tongue as he shouted, "detention!" at her. "Be here in my office at 9 o'clock sharp." Harmony hid her bright smile as she took a step away and the door slammed behind her. She failed to notice the ferret by her feet and nearly stepped on its tail, and only realized its presence when she heard an angry hiss.
"Are you two going out?" Harmony took a knife and nosily scraped her plate, no longer able to listen to their giggling and whispering. Their Ruddy cheeks and sidelong glances told her everything. "That's so lush," Harmony said.
"Er, right," Harmony muttered, wishing that she had some ice cold water to cool her senses. Her body slid to the floor, and her forehead rested on the knees she brought close to her chest. A headache, she repeated in her mind, and not the embarrassment rushing to her head.
"Exactly why were we holding meat in front of a bunch of hungry crazed hyenas?" Draco said in a voice of poorly concealed anger. "Were we to hold signs up as well, with the words 'eat me'?"
"I have one rule," Leighton said, "don't use what I teach against another student." Leighton looked down at Ron and shrugged, "Do you know what happens to students who break the rule, Ronald?" Ron whimpered at the man's feet. "That's three hundred muggle push ups. Starting now." Ron's face was beginning to lose color. When the binds fell from his body, he jerked and sat up shakily. Draco couldn't help but smirk as Ron began to sputter incoherent words.
"You must be kidding." Harmony rolled her eyes before wiping off her Harry Potter face cream mask. She tucked away the glasses, and faced the other girl.
The announcement came early May, just before midnight, as an amplified voice of their head of house. Harmony woke up with a start, having heard the announcement repeated, in her ear once more. She quickly put on her Potter guise and glasses after throwing her black cloak over her thin pajamas and placing her wand in her inner pocket. "Gather in the common room, everyone wake up..." She scratched her hair, ruffled it all up, so it looked like the end of a rooster. Just in case, she skipped over her slippers and put on her shoes.
"Hospital wing," Snape said, pointing to the exit, and Bulstorde walked down with Pansy, shooting Harmony a sneer. "Anyone else?" Snape asked and no one answered, "how about you, Malfoy?"
"They made a ten year old cook their meals, priceless muggles are, so did those hideous beasts not let you eat if you didn't do what they said, or lock you in a little closet," he joked a bit.
An unexpected loathing filled her up as she glared at her two friends. "That's enough," she said "get out."
"Are you sure that you don't want me to try taking some galleons out of my vault?" Draco asked her for the third time. And Harmony just shook her head, no, without an explanation, just walking straight into the bank.
Through the wisps of clouds, Draco could see the outline of the Hogwarts Express as he outstripped the train, following the flight of the owl. As he watched the wide wingspan pump through the air, he wondered why he never paid attention to how fast owls flew before.
"Alright, mate," Ron yawned, "if you act up again, I'll be right next you." She smiled back at him, but was unsure whether he saw it, or if he was already asleep. Harmony went under the covers, not wanting to go back to sleep. She grabbed her pillow and stuck her face into it, feeling the sticky heat.
"Draco!" Harmony growled. She transformed back into a girl. "So that ferret is yours," she said looking around for it. Draco looked awkwardly back at her.
"Please," she said, "go." Something grabbed his shoulder, tugging him back. Draco looked in surprise at his father, who was pulling him away.
"What's new about that?" Ginny asked with her quill tickling her nose. "You got about a thousand of them."
Draco had never thought that someone could work him up in twists and knots as if he were an unraveling scarf. He held her hand and looked down at Harmony, thinking that if a thousand dementors decided to crash the party, that not a single one of them could take away his happiness.
He slipped it between his fingers and waited a good minute before unfolding the parchment. It was foolish thinking to hope, and Draco didn't allow a smidgen to show. It read:
Voldemort's body thudded to the ground and Harmony watched as the many faces that she had stolen left her one by one, till platinum blonde hair fell away and her nose caved in.
"I for one hope that this professor is hot, so that I have something to look at during class," Ginny added with a faint smile.
But you have been doing so well in Gryffindor! All of your friends are there, and you so bravely defeated the Darkest Wizard of the modern era. And your animagus form is an African cat, it's a lovely fit.
"Why if I didn't know better I would think that you were actually interested in seeing me," he leaned closer to her, right over the cauldron staring into her eyes. The heat from the smoke drifted her way and she wisely looked away, right at the moment the contents in the cauldron exploded upwards hitting Malfoy full on the face. He looked absolutely horrified at the mustard yellow mess covering him, making his superb features unrecognizable.
"You're," Uncle Vernon sputtered out, "you're not allowed to do magic out of that, that school of yours."
"Nah, he was just trying some new intimidating tactics, didn't scare me a bit." Since when was she such a good liar? Maybe she just didn't want to alarm them. "He just said the usual threats and how his father was coming after me." Now that would be scary if Malfoy Senior would come on to her as well. She shuddered lightly, bad mental images.
"But there is more," Severus said slowly. "Dumbledore did reveal that he was destroying all of these objects in order so that you would never be complete."
Then her nervousness heightened, making her want to throw the invisibility cloak around her tiny body. Harmony had spotted Draco. He was thankfully not a walking diamond and no longer had to avoid the light as if it were a plague. She rose from the grass, and forced her legs to move. She did not notice the student's stares as she passed. Her better judgment told her to turn around and just hide. But she never ran away, not from danger: she faced it. Draco caught her gaze, his eyes widened. His previous sour expression slackened, and transformed to his haughty smirk. She stood in front of him, not allowing any of her misgivings to appear on her face. She had just surrounded herself between Draco and his friends.
They both turned towards him and he gave them a bored glance, then something lit up in his face. She saw his eyes glow with a predatory smirk. God, did she want to leave. "I just though you yelled that you were not a 'weak little boy', but that can't be right." She gaped at him, had she said that? Even Leighton turned to her. Damn that bloody prat!
When Harmony stood in line with the other first years to be sorted, she was a little unnerved. Even though she looked nothing like Harry Potter, she felt like someone may point at her and say, 'Potter has returned' and everyone would cheer.
"This place is beautiful," Harmony said softly and turned in a slow circle. "What are we doing here, Leighton?"
"Whatever," she said and started to walk to the dorms. She didn't care if she had hurt Ron's feelings. He didn't have to be such a prat about it. What, as if he knew better about how she should live her life.
Harmony choked out a gasp and the anguish gripped her further. She wrestled free from her bed and stood on the cold floor hugging herself. "Damn," she rasped, and massaged her dry throat. She had been so close. A hate bubbled inside. A part that despised herself for being alive, and another for desiring death. But what was worse was that everything surrounded her reminded her of him. For good reason too, since she was in his house.
"Remember you can walk out of my door anytime you wish. Even if you don't believe me, it's still going to be true."
"Now, first order of business, I want each student to destroy the desk that you and your partner share, but without the use of magic. If you chose not to use your bare hands, you may take a hammer. If I see any wand movement, you will give me fifty muggle pushups." From a small wooden box from the front, he pulled out a faded red crate of hammers. "I also do not want to see hammers thrown at other students. Or wood splinters for that matter. The desk is the target, not each other. Now begin."
"Well that's silly…So it's for exercising?" Harmony pondered, as Draco nodded at her, having vague memories at a time in her muggle schools where they had something called physical education. "Can you show me?"
Harmony wondered if it was safe to do so. She looked behind her, to check if people were there even though she knew that they were alone. She looked at the walls, and the only painting was one with a sleeping blue baby. She brought a hand to her face, allowing the magic to dissipate and reveal the real owner behind the guise of Harry Potter. She didn't want to see his expression, but their eyes connected and she was all too aware of the focus his gray eyes fixated her with. She hadn't even processed that she may be making a mistake by showing him. "That's…wow." She quickly changed back to her boy face and hoped that he wouldn't say anything demeaning. Concentration forward, she marched ahead. She could almost feel the smirk that was searing into the back of her head.
"All right then, on to harder meditations and mind discipline. You will now try out concentration techniques which includes closing off your mind. I know that every wizard or witch has at one point used magic without a wand. This was mostly on accordance with times where strong emotions or desires come to play. It will be a time for nonverbal spells." He sat on the barren floor cross-legged and Harmony plopped down a foot away from him. "Take a deep breath and empty your mind," Leighton closed his eyes and she followed him. After a minute she began to fidget, not understanding exactly what to do. The silence was unnerving. She peered through a sliver of her eyelids and saw the complete relaxation from Leighton. She noticed the tension in her shoulders, the unwillingness of her body to be still. With a deep breath she began to relax, and once her body calmed, her mind ceased its stressing. It was like ridding herself of earthly bonds.
"Leighton wouldn't," Harmony said, "unless we bribe him with honey dukes candy, he probably ate all of the ones I'd gotten him for Christmas."
"You thank me a lot," Draco said aloud, as if he hadn't thought of it entirely, "I think you give me too much credit."
"Then make sure Harry doesn't die," Draco said, "my life depends on that." Through the grave silence, footsteps were approaching. His father noticed as well, and looked down at Draco. There was pain in those eyes and Draco wished that there was another way. "I'm sorry," Draco almost whispered. Mr. Malfoy took a step towards him, and he saw his father's arm come for his wrist. He only hoped that there was no wand there as he turned around and ran for those footsteps. He couldn't bear to see his father so.
Two loud cracks announced the apparation of Fred and George, who attempted to merely materialize in the center of the room, and who instead landed on Ron and Harmony's laps.
"I can see that you are busy," Draco said with a bored glance around the three girls, his gaze then fell on Leighton and his eyes blinked twice as he noticed Leighton's appearance. It was like a dark shadow engulfed Draco, in cold loathing. A slight sneer spread across his features. "This is unbelievable, you. I've seen you before. Merlin, it's a good thing I came, so I could report this."
"Shite, Trelawny alert," Ron whispered under his breath. The next few seconds had the two staring aggressively into the ball, rubbing their temples, and giving little chants in order to feign that they were actually progressing with their Sight, and not just slacking off.
"A little slow there." Leighton gave a wide grin, and Harmony watched as seven years evaporated from his face.
"Oh God, what happened?" Ginny asked. But he ignored her as well, continuing to walk down the hallway, making his way down to the kitchens.
He looked closer at her in a bit of surprise and a slow smile spread over his face. "In that case I'll look forward to you thanking me in the future, but I seem to be wrong about you, you are quite capable." Harmony took a sip from the rich hot chocolate as steam framed her face. Her thumb traced the cup handle and she allowed herself to relax. "That scar," he began waving to her forehead; immediately she drew in a quick breath, her mind scrambling for a smooth lie. "It looks remarkably like the scare on-"
"Then don't thank me," he said as liquids vanished with his wand and he set up the rest of the potions at the wall opposite the door. They worked in silence for the remainder of time.
But which one is the real one? Oh the girl, she's all over Draco. And the impostor? Couldn't be Granger or Ginger. Lovegood can't act. He looked over to the Gryffindor table and counted the red heads, noting that the youngest was missing. He smirked.
"Don't give me that. Girls are just as capable as boys...try putting your weight into it," Leighton said. Pansy turned away as if insulted. A sickening crack speared through the room and heads turned to the small figure they saw as Harry Potter standing over the remains of his desk. Ron stood next to her with his mouth ajar
The door clicked as it closed and the three girls sat in a momentary silence. "What the hell just happened?" Ginny asked. "Why would he want to meet you, and why was he acting so strange?"
"By the foulest act of dark magic," Leighton said, "an act of such evil, it is a violation of nature."
She stared in to the mirror and saw her hollow checks and blood red eyes. She hated this mirror, as if it laughed at her. She touched what used to be her nose and grinned with black chipped teeth. Disgusting, like a rotten apple. She touched the smooth surface, and her long nails screeched down her face. It cracked under her hands and a laugh left her lip less mouth. She had her three horcruxes, but not the locket. She had forced the poison down Peter's sorry mouth for nothing. How else was she supposed to be complete? Her scalp was like an ugly dead scull and melted with the white of her skin. "What are you looking at?" she screamed. "I will become the most beautiful!" The mirror fell to pieces and she screamed. Screamed and laughed till she woke up. Harmony shot up from her bed, and touched where she hoped she still had a nose.
She looked at him, deciding to believe what he had to say, or call him a dirty liar. His dark grey eyes told her nothing. "Alright, Malfoy," Harmony said, "I understand, we can try this friend thing for real." The corner of Draco's lips lifted.
"Can't you see that you ARE disturbing us," she ground out, hoping to distract him. Of course she could not, it was Draco Bloody Malfoy.
"Like you could name me any better," Harry spat a tad bit offended. Harry's heart almost stopped when he witnessed something impossible: Snape was smiling, and oddly he didn't have the urge to commit suicide, but he wouldn't believe how beautiful such a smile could be. It blinded him, the perfect balance with such an abnormally large nose.
"Shh, just wait." Ginny closed the door, and went through her robes before taking out an elongated ear.
Harmony looked up at Draco's face to see him smirking again. It irritated her. "Why are you doing any of this?" Harmony inquired, wondering whether he wanted to make a fool out of her, or if he was serious. The tray came down, separating them. "What do you want from me?" Draco regarded her with a cool silence, deciding instead to sip his tea.
Harmony knew how. Third year was the time that he had been a complete arse to her about the dementors. It was not a cherished memory as it had been before, and Draco hoped that she wasn't thinking about it now. Granger had her hand up and Leighton called her name.
"Harry, there is a time for many young adolescents, when their bodies start changing." One of Harry's eyebrows rose since he heard that line before, and he did not want to hear it from a shriveled old man. "It is perfectly normal for boys to start growing hair in new places and girls to start menstruating and developing. Are you following me, Harry?" Harry gaped at Dumbledore. No way was the other man serious. Sure Harry wasn't much grown and still looked like he was twelve, but he was not completely ignorant.
"Secondly, you and I both know that when Potter's things were found, they weren't all found, or everyone would have heard about the fact that Harry kept women's knickers and dresses."
"Thanks Draco," she said and put the glasses on her face. She stuffed everything into her bag. "Make sure you see all of their reactions," Harmony said.
"Thank Merlin for that hangover remover spell," Blaise said, and stretched out to grab some vanilla pudding. "How are you this fair morning?"
The advantage of having a relationship with someone who could practically read your thoughts was that the two of them rarely fought. And when they did it was only about the essentials. Their first real fight happened many years later, in 2011, walking out of the movies.
"Oh man Harry," Ron shuddered, "that man is pure evil. Remember that detention he gave us. That was bloody awful. He made me clean each cauldron inside out, with my hands! I don't want to know what he makes you do, I feel so terrible."
Alright no need to shout. I know where you will do best. It was lovely talking to you again, a much more interesting mind than all of those eleven year olds...
"Race you," she shot from over her shoulder and began to run. Draco laughed before scoping a handful of snow into a ball and chucking it at her back.
At least when Luna showed up, he didn't feel out of place. Harmony and Ginny came together, soon after. Impossibly, the ghost got disgustingly close to the girl who looked like Potter. He glared at the ghost, contemplating whether there were ways to reducto the thing. Once the pest dived into the toilet and out of sight, Harmony allowed the magic to fall from her face, and he watched as she went to one of the sinks.
Harmony and Ron fell into easy old jokes, talking about nothing important, and that was fine with her. They were in a jewelry shop at Hogsmead and Ron's eyes always would dart to the most expensive things in the shop, and then quickly look away. But he would look back again and frown. "Ron," she said, "you really don't have to stress, Hermione will like anything you get for her."
