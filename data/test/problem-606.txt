“Yes.” Harry answered with a nod, unseen in the gloom of the room. “I would never hurt Draco. He is my mate.”
He opened the lid of the box to reveal three small vials filled with different substances and a tiny note attached.
“I promise.” He nodded with a small smile, climbing out of bed and quickly leaving the hospital wing.
Draco swallowed again, shuddering at the very idea of what the Vampire was talking about. Prey…was he Harry’s prey? Was Potter going to use him, drink from him, and then toss away his empty corpse? The idea made Draco sick. “What…what are you going to do to me?” he whispered, all of his Malfoy training not even enough to keep the fear from his voice.
“A neglectful mate.” Harry teased lightly. “Although, I wouldn’t blame you for being reluctant to share our bed with a vampire and whatever else I turn out to be.”
“Yes” Harry finally admitted after a long moment of silence, the word barely a breath. “I should feed twice a day, to get what I need.”
Harry frowned and took a step back, a bit disappointed, and Draco for a few moments was tempted to pull the other boy back against him. "Oh. Are you sure?"
Draco paused in his train of though, his eyes going wide as he thought of something. Slowly he looked up at Harry, his stomach coiling in knots. “Harry?” he asked tentatively. “If, say…someone wanted to kill me—if they actually tried to kill me—what would you do?”
“They’re worried about you.” Draco explained, turning his back to Harry as he stripped and dressed for bed. “They’d like to see you some time soon, make sure you’re alright.”
“You’re awake, my pet.” The cruel, high voice slithered out for the darkness towards him, and yet Harry remained silent, waiting. “No doubt you’re hungry.” Voldemort smirked and the door opened, light filtering in from the hallway. A body was pushed, whimpering in fear, into the room, landing sprawled on the carpet. The Dark Lord kicked the young man and laughed, grinning through the darkness at Harry. “I brought you a little treat. Enjoy.” He laughed again before turning and leaving the room, the door closing behind with a click of the lock.
“Surely you aren’t implying that my son is somehow involved.” Lucius said, affronted. “He’s only sixteen!”
"And the other one?" Harry asked, arching an eyebrow when Draco flushed dark red. He looked at the vial of clear almost gel and a dark smile spread across his lips. "Ahhh...something to make the nighttime even more spectacular, indeed. You're a sly snake, Malfoy."
“Well?” Harry practically growled, crossing his arms over his chest and leveling a cold glare at the blonde. “What are you playing at?”
Dragging himself from his post at the window overlooking the ground, draco reluctantly went to open the door, blinking in surprise when he came face to face with Dumbledore. “May I, uh, may I help you, Headmaster?” he asked, voice a bit rough from disuse, and Dumbledore frowned at him.
Trembling, Draco squeaked and struggled, Harry’s muscular arms more than enough to hold the struggling blonde down. A soft hum came from Harry’s throat and, though he did his best to resist it, Draco soon found himself relaxing, and eventually he stopped fighting. With quick movements Draco’s pants were pulled off and tossed on the floor, but in his Siren Song filled mind the gesture barely registered.
“My Lord.” Harry finally spoke as he stopped mere feet from Voldemort, his voice coming out a slippery hiss. He looked up, black eyes flashing in the dark room as he regarded the figures before him. Voldemort sat languidly in his throne, no doubt foolishly believing that the Dark being before him was his to control. On his right stood a women who sent loathing through every fiber of Harry’s being. After Voldemort she would be the next to fall, of that Harry was positive. On his left stood a masked figure, his face hidden, but Harry still knew who it was. He could recognize Lucius’s power, his very scent. The man who had been responsible for giving Harry his mate. Perhaps he would spare him, for the lone fact that his father’s death would be sure to upset Draco, and Harry would never hurt his mate.
Draco slowly nodded, taking in her words and filing them away for when he was ready to think about the vampire ordeal again. “I’ll remember that, Madam Pomfrey. I’m fine now, can I go?” he asked, trying his hardest not to sound impatient. He had enough to worry about without adding a trip to the hospital wing to the list.
“Seamus Finnegan.” Blaise mumbled quietly. “I, uh, I ran into him, quite literally actually, after the incident with Potter. We started talking and one thing led to another…” he trailed off with a defeated shrug. “You know he’s always been pretty fit. Not to mention his accent is to die for.”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, arching an eyebrow at his best friend as though nothing had happened. “What is it?”
Hours before, Dumbledore had come to Draco’s room in the dungeons, informing him that his living space would be moved. According to the headmaster Harry had torn the room in the hospital wing apart, trying to get to his intended. They had to promise Harry close proximity to his mate in order to keep him from killing Snape when he had gone to take more blood samples. Next, to Draco’s great displeasure, the old coot had warned him of what would happen should he not cooperate. He would be sent straight to Azkaban, charged with murder, and his family’s fortune would be seized. Needless to say, Draco was not willing to let that happen. Now, however, he was regretting that decision.
into your bed. I have yet to get you in my bed, actually.” He pointed out, shifting away from Draco and standing up. “Now come on. If we’re going to go to Hogsmeade we’d better get going now before I change my mind, lock you up in here forever, and have my wicked way with you.”
Finally Draco found his voice, swallowing hard before the words slipped out. “But, but that man…from the paper.” He breathed, staring at Harry with wide eyes. “Isn’t he…aren’t you two…” he trailed off, blinking in surprise as the Vampire started laughing.
“It won’t hurt.” Harry shook his head. “I won’t kill you. Just relax, I’ll protect you from him.” He promised, the siren in him cooing softly, calming the boy.
Harry chuckled, shaking his head as he reached out, lifting the other teen easily and bringing him onto the bed. “Shhh, I won’t hurt you.” He cooed gently, trying to relax the other teen. “I’m not what he thinks I am.”
Dumbledore nodded, a frown crossing his features, but before he could ask Draco was ushering him out the door and slamming it with a dull thud in his face.
Slowly Draco nodded. “Alright.” He finally agreed. “Just don’t go watching me in my sleep or anything creepy like that.”
“Please, Harry.” Draco whispered, a humiliated flush warming his skin, though he was too needy to care overly much about it. “I…I can’t take it anymore.” He admitted. Every other time he’d been left in a state of arousal after Harry’s feeding Draco had quickly scurried to the bathroom for a quick wank. Now, though… well the bathroom wasn’t really a viable option. He reached down and stroked himself, trailing fingers down his shaft and letting out a deep moan.
His heart rate slowing, Harry slowly calmed, his wings folding before disappearing once again into his back. Ever so slowly the creatures within him withdrew, slinking back into the shadows. Their job was done.
Blaise looked up as Draco came rushing through the secret door, setting his book aside and studying his friend in concern. “Draco, what’s wrong? I heard Potter’s back, why aren’t you with him?” Carefully he crept over to Draco’s side, gently wrapping his arms around his best friend.
Breathless, Harry nodded, his eyes wide. “Very, very good.” He panted, starring at Draco in wonder. “And I still have to wash you.”
All Draco could do was give a small nod and a whine, urging Harry to just do it already. Pressing another kiss to Draco’s skin, Harry took a deep breath before he bit into Draco’s skin, feeling the burst of blood against his tongue as his hips shot forwards, impaling Draco in one go. The man beneath him screamed, though in pleasure or pure pain Harry couldn’t quite tell. Draco blood was pumping thick and fast into his mouth as he drank him down, moaning at the taste. It was better than anything he had ever tasted before, better than life itself.
Sighing, Draco shook his head, rubbing his eyes tiredly. “I’m not going to decide that now.” He said firmly, uncurling from his position and stretching his arms over his head. He glanced at his forearm and made a face. “Did you really have to do that, Harry?” he asked with a small pout.
The Vampire smirked a bit at that and the Incubus perked up. Carefully Harry reached around Draco, knocking his hand away to replace it with his own. He let a conservative amount of the Incubus’s powers out, just enough to push small concentrations of magic to his fingertips. He stroked Draco lightly and the other boy let out a short shriek of surprise as pleasure spiked through him.
Hey guys! Slight warning here for attempted rape. This beginning isn't quite what I wanted... but I promise it gets better!
Both professors stepped over, neither of them affording Draco a smile. Even Severus looked worried, something that Draco knew to fear. “Draco, a Incubus is a creature of pure lust and desire. They have attributes that allow them to capture and seduce their prey. To put it bluntly…they feed off orgasmic energy. That’s also why they’re so popular as sex slaves,” he muttered darkly. “Now. I’m not sure how much of the Incubus will show up in Potter; the last time I checked his blood the Vampire’s virus was consuming everything. I could actually see it converting Potter’s cells and the other infections.” He paused, taking a deep breath. “There may also be a trace of Siren left in him, though luckily that creature complements the Incubus. From what I can tell, Potter will be able to sprout wings at will, his voice will be able to placate his victims, he’ll drink blood, and he will have an insatiable craving for sex.” He recited these in the same voice he would use to list Potion ingredients.
Seeing the trust and acceptance in the other’s eyes, Harry nodded and let go, allowing the Incubus to take over completely. It would be better if he couldn’t remember this; this moment he had so long denied Draco and yet was giving to another.
“What present?” Harry frowned, his brow furrowing. At the mischievous glint in Draco’s eyes Harry understood and laughed, shaking his head. “Ah yes,
“Preposterous?!” the blonde man rounded on Dumbledore as his eyes flashed. “Uncalled for?! There’s a bloody vampire in the school and you dare to say it’s uncalled for for me to be concerned for my son’s safety?!”
Slowly Draco took a few steps backwards, preparing to run, keeping his wand trained on the figure that had yet to move. Taking a deep breath, Draco was about to make a dash for it when he suddenly found himself pressed up against a stone wall, a hand at his throat.
Sadly Draco was snapped out of his Harry induced trance and looked at the Gryffindor curiously. "Were you...checking me out?" he asked.
Harry blinked and slowly nodded. "Yeah, they're in my dorm." he lied smoothly. "Come on, let's go get them."
On this fine December morning, Draco Malfoy could be found skipping down the corridors, decked out in dark green especially for the holiday, on his way to breakfast. The two friends wandering behind him, Pansy and Blaise, were looking quite terrified at his happy behavior.
A cold laugh that made shivers run down Draco’s spine escaped from between Harry’s plump lips. “Don’t I? You’re mine, Draco. All of you.
Harry shook his head, tongue shooting out to lap away a couple of spilled drops of blood on his lips. It was then that Draco noticed Harry was trembling with repressed desire. He wanted, no needed, more of Draco’s blood. And yet he had stopped, holding back. But why? “Drink.” Harry commanded softly, still staring at Draco. “You need the sugar and energy, it will help.”
Dark.” He murmured, shuddering a bit. He licked his lips, hunger once again flaring within him. He needed to feed…and soon. “Are you almost done?” he asked, trying and failing to hide his impatience.
Malfoy clucked his tongue. "Tut, tut, Potter you really are a stupid one. You ate a brown then a white piece didn't you. Interesting..." he trailed off, "I always wondered what would happen if Veritaserum and Aphrodisiac were mixed.”
The Headmaster nodded. “Your knowledge is true, if incomplete. You see, Mr. Malfoy, a Vampire will have an…intended. I would use the word mate, except what a Vampire feels towards its intended will not be mutual, unlike the mating of Veelas. A Vampire’s bond with their intended is completely blood driven. They must drink their intended’s blood or they may die. Do you understand me, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco was rather ashamed of the low moan that erupted from his throat as Harry's tongue slipped into his mouth and slid against his. Really as a Malfoy he should have more self control...but then again as a Malfoy he should also make the most of this situation.
A smile flashed across Hermione’s lips and she reached across Harry to grab some food. “Good thinking, Harry. We still have three weeks until they start. If we begin preparing now we should be more than ready to go come exams.” She stated, voice stern and bearing no room for argument.
you, wasn't it?" he took out his wand and twirled it in his fingertips, a subtle threat that Draco immediately picked up on.
Pressed firmly up against Harry’s chest, Draco let out a breathy groan as Harry fed, hips wiggling a little bit back as he felt where Harry’s stirring cock nestled almost perfectly in the cleft of his arse. “Harry…” he breathed, knowing that he was growing hard and overwhelmingly aroused just because Harry was drinking from him, sucking and lapping the blood from his veins.
Draco grumbled against his chest. “No, I didn’t!” he protested weakly. “I just didn’t want him to hurt you, that’s all.”
“Harry…” Draco whispered back with a breathy moan, leaning up to press their lips together in a searing kiss that left them both breathless and in an even higher state of arousal than before.
The vampire in bed blushed brightly, ducking his head a bit. “I just…found myself here.” Harry admitted quietly. “I…I can’t be away from you much longer. It hurts.”
“I know you didn’t,” Harry said sharply, flashing his fangs. “You have no choice in being my mate just as I have no choice in having you as my mate. We’re destined, Draco. You were made for me, and I for you. That’s why your blood can sustain me.”
“Yours?!” Draco nearly shrieked, trembling even more in fear. “Did you ever think that I didn’t want to be yours, that I never asked to be yours?!”
Luckily for him Harry was too preoccupied with his own worries to notice. “What about the sun?” he asked, eyes going wide. “I mean, I know it’s supposed to be gloomy and rainy all day, but what if the sun comes out?”
become more intimate, mostly due to Draco’s rather noticeable reaction to the Vampire drinking his blood. And yet, Draco realized, despite how the Vampire claimed to want it, Draco had yet to be truly taken by Harry.
Draco was panicking. Nothing had happened, or at least that’s what Madam Pomfrey kept on telling him, and yet Draco was still panicking. He had been told to follow the professors to the hospital wing, lie down on a bed, and wait, though he wasn’t told why. Rumors had spread through the school like wildfire the moment Harry was whisked away to the hospital wing, most centered on the way that Harry had looked at Draco split seconds before he had gone down under the stunners. There had been complete and utter yearning and hunger on his face, as though he wanted to devour Draco.
By the time Draco managed to get to the Entrance Hall a crowd had already gathered, and despite his best pushing and shoving Draco couldn’t break through to the front before Harry was whisked off to the Hospital Wing. He was largely uninjured, a broken nose and exhaustion the only things he had to recover from. Nonetheless Draco waited for the crowd to disperse before he hurried up to the Hospital Wing to see him.
Quickly Severus nodded, bowing low as he inched towards the door. “Of course, My Lord. I assure you, it will work as I promised.”
But then again Draco Malfoy always looked suspicious, especially when it came to things having to do with Harry Potter.
Harry took a step forwards before his legs gave out on him and he crumpled to the floor. The ground rose up to meet him before his world descended into darkness.
“Honestly, Draco, you didn’t have to buy me all of this.” Harry could be found grumbling hours later. The pair was heading for the The Broomsticks, laden down with quite a large number of bags, the majority of which contained clothes and other presents that Draco had purchased for Harry.“Of course I did, Harry.” Draco answered sweetly as he got them a table, helping Harry set the bag down. “Although I really should have gotten it all sent directly to the castle.” He added thoughtfully.
Harry looked down, warring with himself. He shouldn’t admit his weakness to his mate…but then again his mate
Harry let out a soft, whispering laugh, closing his eyes and breathing deeply. “As you wish, mate of mine.”
Draco let out a soft breath of air, his stomach twisting a little, though in anticipation or disgust he couldn’t yet tell. This was what he had been afraid of. He was starting to like Harry, yes, but that didn’t mean he was ready to give his body over to the Gryffindor, right?
The moment she left Harry sighed, his shoulder slumping. This was it, his chance to end it all. He just hoped the creatures inside of him were strong enough to get the job done.
“That should be enough.” The vampire murmured, licking his lips. “Will you come back tomorrow?” he asked softly, looking up at Draco nervously.
Draco shuddered as he felt Harry nuzzle his neck, light lips brushing against his throat. “Y-yeah. I’m Draco, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry gave Draco a weak smile and a slight shrug of his shoulders. “You found pleasure and release, that’s all that matters.”
To Draco’s surprise Harry actually paused, a shudder running through him. Moments later Draco was flipped over onto his back and found himself staring into Harry’s eyes again. They were dark now, flecked with the sickly yellow of the Incubus. “Go!” Harry snarled, shuddering again as he tried to keep the demon at bay. “Go before he hurts you!”
But maybe, someday… Draco thought connivingly as he slipped back into his rooms, someday he could use that to his advantage. It wouldn’t hurt to have the Golden Boy wrapped around his finger, blood-sucking monster or not.
For a few days nothing happened and Draco began to grow worried. What if the plan didn’t work? Nothing like this had ever been attempted before and some of the Death Eaters were skeptical, but Voldemort was completely certain that the potion was sound. The only thing the Dark Lord was not certain of was exactly which creatures would appear in Potter and consume him. But they would be Dark, and that was all that mattered.
Quickly Harry nodded. “I will keep him at bay whenever I’m in your presence. He will not harm you.” He promised, unaware how hard it would be to stay true to that one simple sentence. “I would only come out at night, once it’s dark.”
He pushed the door open, smiling as he caught sight of the familiar head of unruly hair. “Harry!” he grinned, hurrying over and throwing his arms around his vampire. “Thank goodness you’re alright, I was so worried!” he gushed. He didn’t notice the stiffness of Harry’s body nor the lack of arms returning the embrace until it was too late to take it back.
“Will it hurt?” Draco asked quietly, his body yearning for what Harry had asked and his heart clenching at the news that Potter had wanted him just as he had wanted Potter. “Will…will you kill me?
“Yes, but that was two hours ago and won’t last you all day.” Draco waved his confusion off. “I’m terribly sorry, Harry dear, but I’m not about to let you…drink from me in public.” He practically purred, letting the insinuation hang in the air between them.
The blonde shifted uncomfortably, looking up at Harry wearily. “Don’t do that.” He mumbled. “It’s freaking me out.” He admitted quietly. When Harry had first thrown him onto the couch he had been almost certain the vampire was going to have his way with him, something Draco couldn’t tell if he was afraid or excited for. But instead the furious vampire had branded him and now Draco didn’t know quite where they stood.
“He shouldn’t take this much,” Madam Pomfrey admonished with a small frown, bustling over to take the goblet from Draco once he had downed the potion inside. “If he is not careful he could drink until even blood replenishing potion cannot save you. You should rest after, perhaps sleep if you need it. And eat; food will help with the dizziness.”
Stretching, Harry rolled over onto his side...and almost screamed when he saw the head of bleach-blonde hair next to his. Then he saw the box of chocolates.
As time passes, Harry and Draco get to know each other better and slowly their bond develops. When a revelation is presented, Draco realizes just how far he's fallen.
“Yes.” Dumbledore concurred. “I do believe the original plan was to use getting you, his mate, back as incentive for joining his army. Voldemort did indeed make Harry into a monster and a weapon. But as always, he forgot about something very, very important.”
The chambers were quiet and lonely without Harry’s presence gracing the rooms, but Draco couldn’t bear to be anywhere else. He couldn’t stand the thought of going back to his dorm, where he’d have to pretend that he wasn’t being ripped apart inside. Where he’d have to pretend that everything was alright.
Dumbledore glanced at the young vampire for a moment before directing his attention back to the blonde. “Mr. Malfoy, I need to speak with you in private. Mr. Potter, if you would please return to your chambers, Draco will return to you once we are done.”
A slow smile spread across Harry’s lip at the questions. “I can’t say for sure.” He admitted. “Some of them die. But I can promise that if I kill you you will love every moment of it. I’ll try not to, though.” He promised. “I’ve wanted you for too long to only feed once.”
It was early in the morning when Draco had the thought that made him almost cry out in heartbreaking pain. Maybe the reason why no one was panicked, why Weasley and Granger kept on assuring him that everything was fine was because Harry
Draco blinked in surprise before thinking hard. “Well…I know that Vampires can’t stand sunlight, it burns their skin, and they have to drink blood in order to survive. As for Incubi…all I know is that they’re based off of desire and lust. I don’t know anything else.”
"Malfoy you little fucker! You're the last one I'd want to bugger!" Harry growled, eyes blazing with anger. "Dang! Why can't I stop rhyming!" he growled. "It's terribly annoying and messing with my timing."
There was a soft rustling sound and a weak fire flared up in the fireplace, giving just enough light for Draco to make out shapes and even deeper shadows. “Draco…” a voice croaked, weak and dying. “Why…why come back now?” Harry asked and Draco finally managed to locate the vampire, sitting in his chair by the fire. As Draco got closer is became apparent just how badly the absence of Draco’s blood had affected him.
Draco readily agreed and Harry left their table to fetch the drinks. Once he was alone Draco sighed, resting his chin in his hands. Five days. That’s all the time he hadleft with the amazing Gryffindor, the young man who had managed to go from being the bane of his existence to the light of his life in mere weeks. And now…now all of that would be gone forever and Harry would go back to hating him, not remember any of what happened between them. But Draco would never forget.
Draco stifled another moan, nodding slightly. “Yeah, I can.” He answered, some of his usual snark present in his voice. “I’m the one who invented them, after all. If I knew they would help you maybe I wouldn’t have.”
As the time passed and Draco found the deadline of his time with Harry fast approaching, he’d come to realize that he wanted it. He wanted to have that between them, even if it was only something for him to remember Harry by. He wanted to really and truly belong to Harry before the young man and his affections were ripped from his grasp.
lost something of great importance to him. Draco. Ron glanced over to the Slytherin table and bit his lip as he studied the other boy. That was something else Ron wasn’t so sure about. Yes, he still didn’t like the blonde git, but there were times, like when he caught the heartbroken, defeated look in Draco’s eyes whenever he caught sight of Harry, when Ron wondered if things would be better off if Harry hadn’t forgotten. There was a part of him that panged with sympathy for the Slytherin, knowing just how hard it would be if Hermione suddenly stopped loving him.
At that Severus stiffened, glancing at McGonagall before he answered. “It is my belief that the Dark Lord is the one who infected Potter. He had me make a potion that would have enabled him to infect Potter with the creatures’ blood, as long as he had them on hand.” He paused, giving Draco an almost sympathetic look. “I also believe that the Dark Lord may have put your blood in the potion, ensuring that you would be Potter’s intended. Your father may have been involved.”
Slowly Harry sat up, looking through the darkness to the figure who stood just inside the doorway. He remained silent, letting his magic reach out and sense what was around him. He already knew who the figure was; he could feel the Dark power radiating off of him.
“I will.” Draco muttered darkly in reply before he sighed. “Do you think you could ask a house elf to bring me some food? It might help me regain my strength faster. And a blood replenishing potion, just in case.” He added as an afterthought.
“Oh shut it.” Blaise laughed, flushing brightly as he slapped Draco’s shoulder playfully. “If you saw what he possessed, you’d be gagging for it too.”
present. My very bloody valentine.” He smiled, rolling over so he was straddling Draco’s hips, kissing him soundly.
It wasn’t until the second day of his captivity that Harry had a visitor, the soft knocking on the door more than enough to tell him who was on the other side. He moved off the bed, leaving the warmth of the other sleeping teen, exhausted after another round of feeding. As the door cracked open he quickly pulled on a dressing robe, not wanted to scare Narcissa Malfoy with his nudity.
The next day Draco could once again be found outside Harry’s door, after minimal prompting from the Headmaster and Snape, shaking slightly as he tried to calm his pounding heart. This time he would just go in, let Potter drink, and then get his arse out of there before the Incubus had time to make an appearance. Taking a deep breath, Draco knocked on the door before unlocking it and stepping inside. He had just heard is click locked behind him when his breathe hitched and he froze as strong arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him up against a muscular chest.
“Not thinking about running, were you, Malfoy?” a voice hissed in his ear and Draco shuddered again, the tone sounding oddly familiar.
Once morning came Draco awoke with a groan, finding himself with two strong arms wrapped around him, a warm body pressed along his side, and a formidable hardness forming in his boxers. He swore mentally as his rather pleasant dreams from the night before came flooding back into his mind’s eye. Did he really dream of Harry kissing him? Of Harry drinking from him and stroking him until he came with arched hips and the breath of a name upon his lips? Clearly, whatever the case, his body had certainly liked the visions his psyche had conjured, though Draco himself couldn’t quite figure out how he felt about them. It wasn’t usually normal to be attracted to your worst enemy, was it?
“You disappeared around the same time Harry did. We’d have to be stupid to think that was a coincidence.”
Draco sighed, shoulders sagging. “I can’t pretend that I’m okay with you doing that…but I can see why it was necessary.”
he thought as Harry looked at him. Draco quickly looked away and got started on Step 2 of his genius plan.
The Slytherin gasped softly as, before his very eyes, the wound at his wrist started to heal. In moments, all traces of what Harry had done were gone. The dizziness Draco had been feeling, however, didn’t disappear with the bite marks, and he collapsed next to Harry, closing his eyes. Next to him Harry shifted and in moments strong hands had flipped Draco over, cupping his slight arousal through his robes and trousers. Draco made a soft, breathy sound, opening his eyes to look up at Harry in confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked sharply, trying to squirm away as Harry started undoing his pants.
Harry grinned brightly and started unwrapping his presents, slowly going through the ever decreasing mound of gifts. By the time he neared the bottom of the stack he had gotten a book on fashion sense (from Hermione), a set of hot Quidditch player posters (from Ron), a necklace with a crystal lightning bolt that was supposed to be able to tell his mood (from Luna), a sock (from Dobby), and a garter belt (from Seamus), just to name a few.
"All it says is WD. I don't know anyone with those initials." Harry sighed, looking at the vials forlornly and idly wondering if belonging to this person would be a bad thing. He felt like he recognized the tone behind the words...
“Potter…” Draco breathed, moved by Harry’s state to gently take one of Harry’s hands in his own, kneeling down next to the other young man. The unfamiliar feeling of guilt rose up in Draco’s chest. This was his fault. His fault for staying away. His fault for ignoring his vampire and not giving him what he needed to survive “I’m so sorry…” he whispered.
Draco was going to die. That, he was certain of. As he stood outside the thick, dark wood door behind which he knew a Vampire sat in wait for him, Draco could hear his blood rushing in his ears and his heart hammering in his chest. He didn’t want to do this. Every bone in his body yearned for him to turn around and run as far away as he could. But he couldn’t.
For a few moments Blaise could just gape at Harry, his eyes wide and full of fear as Harry showed fangs. Quickly Draco placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders, trying to distract Harry from killing his best friend. “Nothing, Potter, we were just talking.”
Harry chuckled, wiggling his hips a bit so his cock slipped between Draco’s arse cheeks, smearing pre-come. “You seem a bit…eager, Draco.” He teased, keeping a tight hold on the Incubus as the siren leaked through, eliciting more noises of absolute pleasure form between Draco’s lips.
Hours passed and Draco didn’t move from his spot, trying to get himself back under control. How could he go back there? Back to that monster that used to be known as Harry Potter? Draco knew how. He’d be forced back, forced to give his blood and eventually his body to the mighty savior of the Wizarding world.
Blaise nearly choked on air and spent a few moments spluttering as his face and neck heated up. “I, uh I…it’s fine. Great, really. He, uh, his…” he looked away, swallowing hard. “His cock his wonderful.” He admitted sheepishly.
At hearing those words from between Harry’s perfect lips, Draco’s mouth went dry and he swallowed hard. A certain part of him was very interested in that idea, but already Harry had exited the room, leaving Draco to get dressed.
“Because that’s not creepy at all.” Draco murmured before he yawned, glancing at Harry. “How’d you sleep? Did, um, sleeping with me help?” he asked, blushing lightly.
A shudder ran through Draco at those words and a greater twist of guilt sprang forth inside of him. Trying not to think about what he was doing, Draco climbed up onto Harry’s lap, straddling him and presenting his neck to the vampire. “Drink.”
“Yes.” The vampire admitted slowly, staring at Draco with eyes so dark they were almost black, but still recognizable as the color that so identified the Boy Who Lived. “I didn’t expect to see you out and about tonight…but I’m so
A low growl erupted from Harry's throat and Draco was struck by just how incredibly sexy it was. For a moment Harry was tempted to refuse and try to walk away, leaving Draco there...but then his brain registered what exactly Draco had said. "Wait...did you just say please?"
"What's that, Harry?" Hermione asked curiously and Harry explained to her about the Christmas present and the potion he had taken. "Can I see the note?"
At his table, working with Neville, Harry was minding his own business as usual. "Hey, Harry." Neville asked, while attempting to put the wrong ingredients into their cauldron. Harry quickly grabbed the dried up chrysanthemum from Neville's hand as the boy continued what he was going to say before being so rudely interrupted by the author's narration. "Hey, Harry. I saw you got a huge box of chocolate this morning. Who's it from?"
“Now listen here, Potter-“ Blaise started before a sharp warning look from Draco shut him up. Draco didn’t want to see what would happen if they messed with a possessive, pissed off vampire. Why did Potter have to have chosen
"I think in this case it means tongue." Draco couldn't help the smirk that slid beautifully onto his lips.
“Protect you, of course.” Harry responded immediately without batting an eye or a moment of thoughtful hesitation. “And I’d most likely kill whoever was trying to harm you. You’re my mate, Draco. I’d protect you above all else, even my own life.” Harry promised with a certainty and reverence that startled Draco. The blonde felt his heart flutter, an almost imperceptible feeling, before he quickly pushed it out of the way. There was no room for those kinds of emotions in this mess.
There was a long pause and finally Harry nodded, standing and stepping away from Draco. “Very well, then I won’t,” he said, voice barely above a silken whisper. “You should go. Tell
“So?” Ron raised an eyebrow in question, swallowing and glancing over at where Draco was keeping his steadfast attention on his food at the Slytherin table. “It’s nice, isn’t it? Not having to deal with the git.” He asked tentatively, watching Harry closely. As much as Ron liked having his best friend back, a part of him was still on edge, watching and waiting for if Harry regained some form of his memory. Both him and Hermione had been careful around Harry, as if testing the waters just to make sure there was no chance of getting bitten.
Panting hard, Draco couldn’t stop the shivers that ran down his spine, tremors shaking his body. He’s come so close to being raped by that…that thing. Squeezing his eyes shut, Draco let out a choked sob, sinking to the floor and pulling his knees into his chest. He never signed up for this when he decided to join the Dark Lord; he had never imagined anything like this.
After a few moments so that Draco could have time to catch his breath, Harry pulled away slightly, ignoring his still present and prevalent erection in favor of fumbling around with the soap to wash Draco with.
Harry stood before the Room of Requirement and waited to be admitted. Yes it was 12 in the morning-er afternoon, or is it morning? Whatever. So of course the place where dreams come true HAD to be the Room of Requirement. Or Disney World...but they don't need to know that.
Potter as the Dark Lord’s weapon…Draco mused thoughtfully. But that would all depend on whether Potter would end up following the Dark Lord, something of which Voldemort was certain, but about which Draco wasn’t so sure. Even with the infection, Harry would still be Harry, right? Nonetheless, Draco couldn’t help feeling a little proud that he would have a hand in Harry Potter’s downfall.
Dumbledore smiled, conjuring a chair next to Draco’s bed and sitting down, rather effectively ignoring Draco’s father. “Mr. Malfoy, what do you know about Vampires and Incubi?”
Harry's eyes widened and he looked a bit sheepish. With all the wonderful, coincidental Malfoy snogging, he had completely forgotten about finding out who had sent him that present. "No." he shook his head. "Although..." he glanced over at the Slytherins to see Draco had taken his usual seat facing the Gryffindor's, "I have a lead."
A sly grin spread across Draco’s lips as he regarded his friend. “Ah, so you’re a bottom now too, then? My my, things
Draco looked down, his body betraying his state of arousal from the memory of the vampire pulling his life force from him. Cursing himself, Draco reached down, giving himself relief from the aching problem.
Letting out a soft sigh, Draco nodded. “Thank you, Harry. I-I don’t know how much you can remember about before you were turned, but, well, there’s this man… and he’ll probably try to kill me at some point in time. Most likely in the very near future.”
sorry, Potter. I'm a bad, bad Slytherin." he said, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Which vial did you take?" he asked suddenly.
A slow smile spread across Harry’s lips at those words and he nodded once, a light dancing within his gaze as he regarded Draco. “That I can do.
Dumbledore smiled slightly, eyes cold with restrained anger. “Well, Mr. Malfoy, Professor Snape has done some tests on a sample of Potter’s blood and has found traces of multiple Dark creature viruses in his system. The most prominent of these are currently the Vampire and Incubus, which Severus believes will in the end consume the other infections.”
The whole time Harry’s body was changing as the Incubus took over and the Vampire in him melted back to the shadows. His skin seemed to glow with an unearthly light and a set of translucent, dark-feathered wings sprouted from his back. The biggest difference in Harry, besides his newfound strength, was his cock. Draco whimpered as his eyes dropped to Harry’s manhood, trying to take in the horrible sight.
Seeing as well as feeling Draco’s discomfort with his answer, Harry quickly tried to back peddle, reassure Draco that they needn’t have sex if the blonde didn’t want to, as much as Harry craved it. “But it’s okay!” he quickly exclaimed. “I don’t want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. I know you don’t find me attractive or anything…” he mumbled, ducking his head and looking at his hands as he trailed off into silence.
Shivering, Draco shifted a bit uncomfortably, not quite certain how he could respond to such a comment without giving the vampire the wrong idea. Instead the Slytherin sat up, stretching and running a hand through his hair before getting up and going to the wardrobe to get dressed. There were a few long moments of a deep, uncomfortable silence before Draco spoke again. “Do you need that, Harry?” he asked softly, not turning from the shelves of clothing.
Draco let out a bark of raspy laughter and the two young men grinned at each other, satisfied with their actions and still within the glow of orgasmic bliss.
Harry twisted Draco’s left arm up, making the blond hiss in pain, and nuzzled it with his nose. There was a pause and Draco held his breath, his eyes squeezed shut in fear. Then a scream of agony was torn from the Slytherin’s lips as Harry clamped his teeth over his forearm. Draco could see the blood blossom from the wound before Harry closed his lips over it, sending even more pain shooting through his body. Unlike every other time Harry had bitten him there was no pleasure, only sharp bursts of paralyzing pain.
There was a slight pause before Draco nodded. “Yeah, I am. If you need contact then I will give you that contact. What kind of mate would I be if I didn’t?”
In answer, understanding what Draco wanted to know, Harry nodded. “Many times.” He said, unable to keep the silly, happy smile from spreading across his lips. He had brought his mate pleasure and that made the vampire within him preen with pride. “You were out for many hours and…your hardness wouldn’t go away. I didn’t actually touch you.” He quickly reassured Draco. “Just…just your trousers. I think the hardness was an after-effect of my drinking from your neck. I’m sorry.” He apologized, ducking his head in shame.
But that wasn’t the only thing making Draco panic as he lay in a bed in the hospital wing, staring at a door set in the wall across from him, behind which he knew a newly created Vampire lay in wait. What was making Draco panic the most was how fast Harry had changed. From what Lucius had told him, whatever Voldemort did to Harry was supposed to change him slowly over the course of a week or two. The symptoms of each creature were supposed to show up little by little, not all at once.
Chuckling softly, Draco shook his head. “Not necessarily, but I’m going to continue studying potions. Maybe open an apothecary or something.”
Or that least, that’s what he kept telling himself, even as he jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom, vomiting in guilt.
“Yeah.” Blaise nodded, having found his voice again. “We were just hanging out and talking.” He said, wiping at his mouth.
In a flash Harry spun around, teeth bared and showing fangs. “Unless you want me to feed on your blood and body!” he snarled, taking all of his strength not to leap at the vein pulsing in Draco’s throat, calling to him. “Now go!”
! Otherwise I never would have let you do that to me.” He grinned as Harry’s eyes shot wide open. “I must say…” his expression turned coy, “I’m flattered you liked my pictures that much. I could always do a photo shoot for you…a very special,
Harry had been drinking from Draco’s throat for weeks now and yet still, every time it left Draco surprised at how good it felt, how little it hurt. And Draco found himself almost missing the sensation of feeding every time Harry finished and pulled away, licking the wound. It left Draco wanting more, already craving the next day then Harry would need to feed again.
"You haven't eaten the chocolate DAMMIT!" a voice erupted from the darkness. "You do have them with you don't you?"
After a moment of thought Draco shook his head. “I’ll just drink it while you’re, um, doing your thing.” He answered, fingers of his outstretched hand twitching to get Harry’s attention. “Now come on, we don’t have all day.”
That made the vampire snicker, hands traveling down Draco’s body to rest atop the rather prevalent bulge within his robes. “I do believe your body begs to differ.” He smirked giving a light squeeze and making Draco gasp sharply. “How long have you wanted this? How long have you wanted…me?” he grinned, fangs dangerous and sharp, shining in the dim light from the moon filtering through the window.
Harry awoke in the early dawn with a gigantic smile on his face. Now many people would wonder why it is that the Boy-Who-Will-Most-Likely-Die-In-The-Next-chapter would have reason to smile on this sunny morning, and rightly so. Well the reason for Mr. Potter's happiness will not be stated here in this very sentence, so you best read on in order to solve this most intriguing of mysteries.
Draco swallowed hard and slowly nodded. “I don’t really have a choice in giving him my blood, do I?” he sighed in resignation.
Harry chuckled, finger running over the pendant at his throat again as Ron groaned. “You always know just what to say, Hermione.”
Harry smirked, pulling the box of vials out of his pockets. "Now Malfoy, what are these other potions?" he asked calmly, although his voice held a hint of warning.
“I guess, yeah.” Draco grumbled, peaking up at Blaise with a petulant glare. “You don’t have to sound so excited about it, you know. He hates me again. He hates me and…and we never even got to shag.” He huffed, trying to get his anger at Harry for forgetting him to overshadow the emptiness that had taken up residence inside his chest. It didn’t work.
“Don’t call me darling.” Draco croaked, trembling slightly in fear and terror. “I-I’m not your d-darling. Just t-take my blood so I can go.”
“Draco?” A soft voice came from the edge of the room and Draco looked up to see Harry peaking in at him, a worried expression etched into his features. “Mate? You seem…distressed.”
"Of course I got good presents, you dumbass." Draco scowled at her. "I always get good presents, the very best. No, what makes it so wonderful is I finally devised a fool-proof plot to land Potter in my bed." he smiled evilly.
For a moment Draco felt his stomach plummet, an emptiness spreading across his chest. “I…what do you mean?” he managed to get out, mouth becoming dry. Harry…could be cured? That was good, wasn’t it? He asked himself. But then why was he having such an adverse reaction to the seemingly welcome news?
Harry yawned as he awoke on the grass of the Quidditch Pitch, stretching out in the quickly setting sunlight. He felt sore all over, as though he’d been lying in one position for far too long, which, Harry supposed, must have been what happened. He distinctly remembered falling asleep in the early afternoon warmth on the pitch and he guessed he must have slept all afternoon. Harry got up, stretching his arms up, over his head, and groaned as his muscles popped pleasantly. In the dying daylight Harry made his way back up to the school, completely oblivious to the changes racing through his body.
"What potter?" he asked, clutching his sides as he rolled around on the floor. "Wait." suddenly he stopped laughing. "You weren't rhyming!" he gasped. Harry paused for a few moments, grinning.
Over with the Gryffindors Harry couldn't believe his luck. First he found Draco, possibly the hottest bloke in the entire school, twice trapped under enchanted mistletoe, then the Slytherin just had to remove practically his entire top layer of clothing. Honestly, it was so lucky that little Hufflepuff hadn't been paying attention as she ran through the Great Hall with pumpkin juice. Wait...luck...Harry gasped and he got out the small box that now only contained two potions and read through the note again. "One to make your wildest dreams come true..." he whispered, starting to wonder if maybe...
"Of course it just had to be you." Draco growled, making himself sound angry and like it was the worst possible thing in the world to happen instead of being very very pleased and not believing his luck. "The Weasley Twin's enchanted mistletoe." He nodded to what was hanging above them in the middle of the corridor. "It chooses a person at random and traps them under it until another person comes along and traps them too. It doesn't let either of them leave this spot until the requirements are fulfilled." he explained.
Harry grinned, showing fangs that no longer made Draco shudder. “Your blood is very rich, Draco. I didn’t need much to feel full.” His grin morphed into a look of concern and his other hand moved to brush Draco’s hair gently from his face. “Are…are you alright with what happened?” he asked gently.
The blonde rolled his eyes, fixing his hair before he got into bed. “I can’t say no when you’re already all comfy in bed, now can I? Anyways, it’s not like you going to rip my throat out in my sleep, you’re not that much of a monster.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You don’t have to sound so bloody smug about it.” He muttered petulantly. “That really hurt.”
After a moment Draco nodded, satisfied that Harry wasn’t going to kill the old coot, and got out of bed, quickly pulling on his robes. He yawned as he walked to the front hall and saw the Headmaster. “Headmaster.” He yawned again. “To what do we owe this early morning visit?” he asked, feeling Harry come up behind him.
“No, Mr. Malfoy, you do not.” McGonagall nodded. “Without your blood Harry could die and I’m afraid we cannot let that happen.”
At the gentle touch Draco’s dams broke and the next thing he knew he was sobbing into Blaise’s shoulder, tears cascading down his cheeks. He barely even noticed as Blaise maneuvered them over to the couch, allowing Draco to curl up against his side as he continued to cry. Blaise stroked his fingers lightly through Draco’s hair as he waited for the blonde to calm down enough to speak. The gentle touches soothed Draco slightly and eventually his shoulders stopped shaking and the sobs subsided enough for Draco to form coherent words.
"I'm going outside to make out, care to join me?" Harry finally replied. He clapped his hands over his mouth yet again, eyes widening. He DEFINATELY had not meant to say that. He had meant to say, "You're a delusional scrawny ferret." but it just wouldn't come out.
At the time Dumbledore had said something about them getting some much needed fresh air and a chance to stretch their legs, but Draco didn’t quite buy it. The headmaster always had ulterior motives, Draco was positive of that. After all, Draco knew just how well Dumbledore was at manipulating the strings just to his liking. Despite his reservations, however, Draco couldn’t help but feel giddy at the thought of finally getting out of Hogwarts, and with Harry nonetheless.
It took only moments for the professors to see something was going wrong, but by the time Dumbledore reached the Gryffindor table it was too late. “Don’t…don’t touch me!” Harry almost screamed as the Headmaster tried to pick him up. Where Dumbledore’s hand had touched him there was a searing pain, boring deep down into his soul. Still Harry struggled, inching painfully towards the doors. He had to leave, that was all he knew. He had to leave before the hunger consumed him and he acted upon it. From the corner of his eye he saw a blonde head look over at him, its owner rising to his feet. The hunger intensified, overwhelming him with need to consume what was his. Before Harry knew it, he was on all fours and leaping at Draco, not even hearing the five stunners that hit him before everything went black.
Even as Harry stroked them, the siren within him occasionally letting out soft crooning noises that sent jolts of pleasure shooting through Draco’s body straight down to his cock, the two boys rutted against each other. Their hands felt and explored, never before having such great expanses of soft flesh revealed to them.
“No!” Draco squeaked, trying to push Harry off of himself. “I-I gave you my blood, you don’t get anything else.”
For a few moments Draco just blinked at Harry in surprise before he slowly nodded. “Some…some hot chocolate would be nice, if possible. “ he said quietly, thinking that chocolate could possibly help to calm his nerves.
Almost a month passed and Draco was true to his word. Every day he came to Harry’s room so that the vampire could feed from his throat. Although he left the door to Harry’s room unlocked, he had yet to venture forth into the rest of Draco’s chambers, afraid of invading his mate’s privacy.
“Draco?” Harry’s voice jolted the blonde from his inner voices and he opened his eyes to see the vampire staring eerily at him.
Carefully he went over the events of the day. "So I sent the box in the morning, which was probably when he took it. Then I got trapped under that mistletoe and he ran into me. That could have been coincidence, I guess. The second time he seemed almost as though he was looking for me. I guess it's possible...and the third time..."
“You do know, don’t lie to me. He was going to take you and it would kill me. But he couldn’t take you.” Harry purred and a feral smile curled across his lips. “He also wanted to punish you, hoping that you would be ravaged by the monster I became. He hoped I would rape and rip you apart.” He licked his lips, as though the thought was more than slightly appealing to the beasts within him. “I will kill him. He wanted to turn me into a monster, to destroy Harry Potter and only leave the beast within. So I’ll be the monster and I’ll kill him.”
Giving Draco a stern, hard look, Madam Pomfrey checked his vitals again with her wand and reluctantly agreed. “Alright, Mr. Malfoy, you may leave. But no strenuous activity for the rest of the day, and you must promise to eat a decent dinner and rest.”
for himself.” He sighed, running a hand through his hair and looking rather lost and vulnerable in that moment. “So you see, I
The blonde teen glared up at Dumbledore. “You try letting a Vampire drink your blood and see how much you like it,” he growled.
For a few moments Hermione could only gape at Draco before she swallowed hard, finding her voice again. “Now look here, Malfoy-“ she started before Draco cut her off.
“Oh, and Malfoy?” Hermione called to his retreating back. “If you hurt him we’ll dismember you.” She warned seriously.
“Malfoy.” A calm, cool voice sounded above him. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” there was a shove against his chest and Draco went sprawling backwards, his breath knocked out of him.
For a few moments Lucius gaped at Dumbledore, the perfect picture of complete and utter surprise. “And how could he possibly have been infected by that many Dark creatures at one time?”
Harry was quite glad that nobody had asked him about his gifts, after all, this year was like any other year where he didn't have anyone to give racy or romantic presents to. For Harry Potter was very much alone in life. Despite this, Harry still felt that somehow this year was going to be different somehow. Perhaps it was because Harry had finally let Collin Creevy get his way and Hogwarts now had an official Harry Potter Fan Club. Or maybe it was because Harry had finally discovered that he had hordes of fangirls who all wanted to have his babies. Either way, Harry was still excited.
Draco swallowed hard, his stomach beginning to rebel against the information he was taking in. “I…how long will it take to become effective?” He asked quietly, a sense of growing dread settling in his stomach.
“Without its intended’s blood, a Vampire will get very ill and most likely die.” McGonagall spoke up. “It is possible that the Dark Lord meant for Lucius to pull you from the school, thus cutting off any chance of Harry gaining access to your blood. He may have thought that Harry would die and the other creatures would take over, effectively turning Harry completely Dark. He could then be used as a weapon.”
Harry needed no prompting and without further ado he attacked Draco's mouth, kissing him with amounts of tongue that should be illegal.
Harry winced and chewed on his lower lip with one rather sharp looking fang, almost immediately drawing blood. “I already said I was sorry,” he mumbled, looking down. “I can’t do much else, I need your blood to live. You’re my mate, Draco…you’re mine.”
Draco nodded eagerly, hoping against hope that Severus could be proved wrong and then he really wouldn’t have to let the new vampire drink from him. “Yes.”
“Harry.” The blonde whispered again, and then soft lips were against his own, he was kissing Harry Potter, and Draco Malfoy’s world descended into bliss.
“Good morning, Mate.” Harry answered with a content hum, continuing to stroke Draco’s hair. “Have a nice sleep?”
"And YOU" Snape reminded him, "need to be getting ready for your joyous class with the flamboyant Hufflepuffles. " Lucius scowled at him but nodded.
“Harry’s still Harry.” Draco nodded with a smile. “He may have been turned Dark, but there’s still some of Harry left in him.”
Once he was alert enough to notice Harry’s actions as the brunette started gently washing Draco’s body, he frowned, catching the hand containing the soap. “What about you?”
“As you wish, Draco.” Harry murmured sadly, cupping Draco’s hand in both of his own and gently drinking from it. Draco closed his eyes, waiting for the rush of pleasure that accompanied the feeling of Harry drinking from him, but it never came. All he felt was a cold, dull ache where Harry’s teeth pierced his flush.
A shiver ran down Draco’s spine as he heard Harry’s promise, knowing from his tone and the hiss within his voice that Harry was completely serious. Sometimes he forgot that he was living with a vampire mixed with an Incubus and a siren; a monster that could kill him in seconds if not for the bond of blood and whatever else that connected them. “O-okay.” He murmured, starting as gentle arms wrapped around him, holding him close.
Harry quickly nodded. “Of course, Draco.” He agreed. There were a few long moments of silence as the pair sat in front of the quietly crackling fire. Then a smirk spread across Harry’s lips and he glanced over at Draco. “You sound like you care about what happens to me, mate of mine.” He teased gently.
“Perfect.” Draco smiled, snuggling against Harry’s chest. “Oh, and even though we missed Valentine’s Day, I still expect flowers and chocolate tonight, since you got your present last night.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco nodded. “I know I am. But I promised that I would give you my blood and so that’s what I must do.” He sighed softly and sat on the edge of Harry’s bed. “I…I’m just afraid that it will hurt.”
“And Hermione Granger is not stupid.” Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. “You are correct, I’m involved, though I didn’t want to be.”
Carefully Harry picked Draco up, moving him to the bed once he’d made sure the blonde’s breathing and heart rate were close to normal. He carefully lay down next to Draco, holding his mate close in his arms as he waited for Draco to wake up.
Draco smiled against Harry’s lips as the kiss deepened, spiraling towards more intimate contact. Maybe Valentine’s Day wasn’t so bad after all.
“No, I am not implying that Draco was involved.” Dumbledore shook his head, the twinkle that normally resided in his eyes gone. “I think that this was the work of Lord Voldemort.” He let the sentence hang in the air as he turned to Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, how are you feeling?” he asked gently, making Draco blink in surprise.
Harry spazzed as a note magically appeared by his hand. "AAAAAAHHHHH! How'd that get there!" Harry yelled.
"Fine then Sevi-Kins." he said in a sugary sweet voice before quickly turning tail and fleeing to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
Draco desperately wanted to be able to answer that voice, to tell him that he had a lot to lose, but he knew it was useless. What did he have? His modeling career? Hardly fulfilling work, and not something he was overly attached to. His potions? Yes, he loved the work, and had worked hard to become as good as he was, but what was it bringing him besides recognition and money? Nothing. Even his friends had disappeared from his life, leaving him alone with no one who could get close to him. No one but Harry Potter, apparently.
Harry thought for a moment trying to figure out how to respond. He decided with, "You are a fucking moron, Malfoy, but you're really damn lucky you look so hot I could jump you right here, so I won't hex you into all oblivion." Harry took a deep breath and said. "What would you like Malfoy? coffee? Tea? Me?"
Leaning forwards, Hermione gasped softly as she studied the symbol of Harry’s claim. “You were never marked by You-Know-Who?” she asked after several moments of thoughtful silence.
“Of course.” Harry quickly nodded, getting out of bed and helping Draco up. He led the blonde to the door, smiling sadly at him. “I’m sorry again for what happened. It will never happen again, if…if I see you again.” He finished quickly, swallowing hard as he slammed the door closed behind Draco and slunk back into the darkened corners of his lair.
"You sure about that?" Harry smirked and Draco's ears turned pink. "That's what I thought." Harry chuckled and took out the clear vial. "Ahh yes, I think we'll make good use of this. Clothes off, now." he commanded, already starting on his own.
Once Draco reached his chambers he headed to the bathroom, planning on taking a nice long shower to wash away the feeling of Harry’s hands on him. Sighing, he rested his forehead on the cool tile as hot water pounded down on his back, closing his eyes.
A frown flashed across Draco’s lips and he slowly stood, reaching out to place a hand tentatively on Harry’s shoulder. “Are you sure?” he asked quietly.
Still not breaking apart, the two teens slowly made their way over to the bed, which was conveniently only two feet from them. Harry pushed Draco down on the bed beneath him and the blonde moaned into his mouth at their bodies lined up with each other.
Harry shrugged. “As ready as I’ll ever be, given the circumstances.” He answered, grimacing a little. It still irked him that he was missing over two months of memories including time that contained the memories of him slaughtering the Dark Lord. Although, to be honest, after waking up soaked in blood with Voldemort’s head clutched in his hands, sometimes Harry was thankful he couldn’t remember the abject destruction he had caused.
Draco rolled his eyes, shifting so he could slide his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Potter, you’re an idiot.” He huffed. “I was waiting for
A shiver of horror ran through Draco as the Headmaster smiled at him, the irritatingly calm twinkle back in his eyes. “We have reason to believe that you may be Mr. Potter’s intended, Mr. Malfoy.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry murmured as he pulled back, licking his tongue across the wound he had made. “But…I need more.”
Exhausted with the pure force of his release, Draco nearly collapsed in Harry’s arms, sagging against the other teen in an effort to stay on his feet. “Harry…” he breathed, sounding rather dazed, and Harry smiled. Within him the Incubus was thrumming with content, having feasted on Draco’s stunning release of sexual energy. After keeping it bottled up for so long, the Incubus’s feast was truly a delightful one.
After a few moments of thinking it over Harry nodded, relaxing slightly back into the pillows. “Thank you, Draco.” He paused before voicing his next question. “Are you sure you’re all right with me being here?” he asked quietly.
“Okay.” Draco finally mumbled, trying to keep the deep emptiness that threatened to consume him out of his voice as he started trembling. “Thank you for informing me, Headmaster.”
A huff left Draco’s lips and he folded his arms across his chest. “It was necessary because if you’re going to be with a Malfoy then you have to dress like a Malfoy.” He answered haughtily. “We have an image to uphold, I can’t be seen with a mate who dresses like a street urchin.” Harry made to retort about the state of his clothing, but Draco cut him off. “Not to mention I like spoiling you and it’s going to infuriate my father once he realizes our fortune is being spent on the Boy Who Lived and there’s nothing he can do about it.” He finished, smirking evilly.
The Vampire pulled back, licking at the wound he had made for a moment before he answered his difficult mate. “If I remember correctly, mate, it was
Sighing, Draco had to agree with the vampire, he was already feeling slightly dizzy from blood loss. “Fine.” Draco muttered, huffing and folding his arms. “But after a break you’re going to drink until you aren’t hungry anymore, okay?”
Voldemort nodded at his disciple from his throne, fingers straying along the scales of the python that sat wrapped around his shoulders. “Dolohov, Yaxley.” He commanded to two of the men who lay waiting in the shadows for direction. They stepped forwards, bowing their heads in fear and respect.
The vampire growled low in his throat at being interrupted, but the sound secede the moment Draco pressed a hand to his chest. Harry dipped his dead down in confusion. “Yes, mate?”
The Headmaster nodded with a pleased smile. “Of course, Mr. Malfoy,” he said, leading Lucius to the Hospital Wing doors. “Thank you for your cooperation, we’ll keep you updated.” Lucius nodded, sweeping out the door without even another glance at Draco. Dumbledore smiled and turned to look at Draco once again. “Now, my dear boy, I’m sure you have some questions for me.”
"Fucking hell, this AGAIN!" Draco growled. "And let me guess, Harry sodding Potter is just going to come strolling down this corridor to snog me and who knows what else and...and..." he trailed off, realizing something. "Oh...fuck." he murmured in amazement.
Turning his attention back to Bellatrix, Harry smiled, showing his fangs. There was a cracking, ripping sound and then Bellatrix’s head was rolling on the floor, eyes staring blankly at the other Death Eaters. Harry stood slowly, wings spread, and turned to face the remaining wizards. The evil grin that spread across his lips mixed with the carnage surrounding him was more than enough to send them running. Within moments Harry was alone, the only sound the dripping of Voldemort’s blood as it ran down the throne, pooling  at his feet.
Draco snorted. "Drop the act Zabini." he growled, making Blaise scowl at him. "Of course I did, I'm not about to let this wonderful opportunity pass me up." he finished with a smirk.
