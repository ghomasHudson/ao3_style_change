He hoped that his parents didn’t see the contents in any of the files. Narcissa always seemed to crack his codes with all of his devices. It was like some secret parent talent. Not only were there embarrassing photos of him scattered everywhere but there were also some...tapes. Tapes of him and the neighbor. Tapes that his parents just couldn’t see. He’d be kicked out of the house for good, shunned away from the entire family! It wasn’t so much of him fooling around with Harry because if he were a girl, it would just give his parents more of a reason to put him in an arranged marriage. But he wasn’t a girl. The fact that he was having a relationship with another man was more so the problem. It just wasn’t tolerated in their household.
“Want Pansy to talk to him?”
“I hadn’t seen her since breaking off the engagement,” Draco noted. “I’d thought she’d be a least a little unhappy to see me. I couldn’t possibly believe that she or her family had anything to do with it. But maybe she’s just pulled the fleece right over my eyes?”
He still felt badly for losing it on her the day before, despite her gracious acceptance of his apology.
“Draco?” Harry’s tone was hushed, so as not to startle him.
The game was spectacular. The chasers were tensely competitive, keeping the points within 10 of each other throughout the match – meaning that it was all going to come down to the seekers. Ginny pulled off an incredibly tight turn that had Harry’s stomach lurching in sympathy in order to catch the snitch from right under Puddlemere’s seeker. A strange, muted sensation blanketed Harry, and he turned to see that Draco had cast a charm around him to lower the intensity of the wild cheering that engulfed the pitch.
Every room he peeked into was bright and fresh. Homey and comfortable. Before, in Grimmauld Place Harry could always feel the unpleasant prickle of dark magic on his skin. Now, it felt safe. If it weren’t for how disoriented Harry felt about this all, he would have been relieved to be here and gone straight for a nap.
When Teddy giggled, Malfoy set his plate down on the table and lifted the boy into the air with both arms. He dropped his jaw down as far as he could manage and pretended he was going to take a bite of Teddy’s toes. “What do you think,” he growled, “can I open my mouth as big as a dragon? My name means Dragon, so I should hope that is good for something.”
“Yeah. I’ve been feeling cooped up is all,” Harry replied sullenly.
going to fix this!” Malfoy’s voice was tense and certainly louder than appropriate in a hospital. He was nearly shouting at poor Niamh.
“You like him,” Harry accused.
“Kay.”
you. Just… having you next to me.”
Resentment unfurled in Harry’s chest, licking up his throat bitterly. “Fine,” he said, pushing out of his chair. “I’m going to go to bed, I think. Long day.”
“I couldn’t say,” Harry snarked, “I don’t remember. I doubt it though.”
Malfoy hesitated for a long moment before he said, “To remember what most people think of me, maybe. But also to remember what we’ve been through together.”
“Dudley?” Harry asked dubiously, suddenly remembering that Pansy had mentioned George going to look for Malfoy at Dudley’s the previous evening. “As in my cousin Dudley?”
“We continue to look into the gang lead by the Dolohovs, but at this point it is not a strong enough lead to result in any charges being placed.”
She tutted and pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s cheek. Then she turned and did the same for Harry, who sat in stunned silence as she walked out.
Hermione and Ron came over for dinner, through which Ron easily carried on a single-handed conversation about the Chudley Cannons. Harry noticed Malfoy ducking his head to hide a smile at Ron’s truly ridiculous enthusiasm. He wondered if, normally, that smile would be aimed at him.
George reached out to peel it off, laughing, “I love this stuff.” He ignored Harry’s complaint as he prodded it back into its container with his wand. “Pansy reckons the two of you need to fuck it out.”
“Anything deep fried and greasy – never got much of that growing up. And Merlin, was I missing out.”
Harry woke to hushed voices and immediately realized that he needed to eavesdrop. He’d had enough experience with people trying to shelter him to know that now, when he’d lost his memory, was definitely one of those times that people would do that.
“For this first one I thought maybe someone should, just in case you find it disorienting or gives you a terrible headache or something…”
“There’s only three from Ginny?” Harry asked as he skimmed over the vials, feeling a little hurt by it.
Harry cleared his throat, “I’m not sure I could manage to fall back asleep just yet…”
months’ worth of studying?”
Well then.
Draco turned to Harry, his brows tugging down even as his lips curled into a surprised smile. “I didn’t know that one.”
“You-” Harry gaped, unable to comprehend this.
Determining that Draco was best left to sleep as long as he needed, Harry slipped out of bed to let Gandalf out and feed him his breakfast.
“Where’s Ginny?” Harry asked, feeling as though she really ought to be by his side. “Hogwarts?”
He headed to the main floor and pulled a pair of trainers on. Then he crept down to the kitchen and out the door into Grimmauld Place’s small garden. Frost coated the cobblestone patio, and Harry had to grab hold of the doorframe so he didn’t slip on his first step out the door. That would be a shame since all he could think about all day yesterday was how badly he wanted to go out for this run.
“Try me.”
A terrible kink in his neck was the first thing Harry became aware of. The second was a cool hand on his forehead. Then the whoosh of the fireplace once, twice. The tingling sensation of a spell cast over him.
“Longeman interviewed Kreacher after the attack.”
“Yes sir,” she replied with a mischievous grin. “I take it you’re feeling alright, then?”
Hermione met his eyes questioningly, Harry indicated she ought to go on with an unsteady jerk of his chin.
These were some of the first scenes I imagined for this story but I had the hardest time deciding what order they should go in the plot, so hopefully it feels like it flows okay! I finally feel like I'm getting my groove back, so hopefully posts will be a little more frequent (though I definitely can't promise anything, sorry!)
“One a day only. For this first week at least. If you have any headaches, dizziness, confusion you stop reviewing immediately. And you book back in with me before continuing to watch anymore. Got it?”
Harry finally turned to look at him. He seemed just as uncertain as Harry was.
you feeling?”
“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” Hermione asked, all but wringing her hands with anxiety.
Harry’s muscles tightened. “I hardly think it’s likely that Draco Malfoy did this,” he bit out, with far more certainty than he would have expected.
Malfoy insisted that Harry take the lead with Teddy on the way to the park after lunch. Teddy clamped his small hand around Harry’s and toddled along the sidewalk, seeming to know where he was going. Once in a while, from where he strolled behind them with Andromeda, Malfoy would call out a direction because apparently Teddy did not, in fact, have the ability to successfully navigate just yet.
“No, it’s… you didn’t mean…” Harry looked over to Draco helplessly. He didn’t want him to feel badly. He was sure that the fact of it hurt Draco just as badly as it did Harry, after all.
At this, Draco nodded, his gaze drifting back to the fire, a troubled furrow to his brows.
“I’m sorry. That’s not fair of me,” Harry said, hoping that his regret came across as genuinely as he felt it.
“Oh, well… alright.” They let an embarrassed silence stretch between them before Harry made a decision. “No, I think I’d rather not watch them; unless there’s any bits of conversation or whatnot that you think are really important?”
“I want to apologize to you.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile back. “I suppose you always did intrigue me.”
That afternoon Auror Longeman requested a meeting with Harry for the following day.
“Harry,” he nodded, mouth pressed tight.
feel important.
“Deal,” he whispered.
“Yeah, he’s got a great mind for the investigative work. I’ve been systematically compiling a list. Going through the records of Death Eaters and their family members, thinking of anyone who might want revenge on you.”
“It’s a surprise,” Harry insisted, squeezing Draco’s hand a little tighter and tugging him down the alley.
“Huh.” Harry mulled this over.
“Yes Healer,” Draco said solemnly.
“Nah,” Harry shook his head. “Seemed pretty sincere to me. She’s interesting. Reminded me of Luna a little. Maybe I should give Luna her details. I bet they’d have a great time designing custom gowns together.”
“Trainee Malfoy,” Longeman said coolly, finally turning to look at Draco, “I recommend you remember your tenuous position within the DMLE as well as the way your past actions reflect on you in the current circumstances.”
“Well,” Harry spread his arms sarcastically, “Here I am. I’m fine. Just fancied a run.”
“I’m content to be as close beside you as you’ll let me be as often as you’ll let me,” Harry murmured back, nudging the side of Draco’s neck with his nose.
“I just… Urgh,” Draco tugged at his hair while his lips pouted just a little. God, could he cut Harry some slack and stop looking so kissable? Finally, Draco found the words to explain, “You don’t remember anything.”
“Of course I do,” Malfoy tipped his nose up. “I’m not a luddite.”
Longeman shifted in front of the door, filling most of it up with his large frame. Harry would bet all this Galleons that this man was the resident bully of the Auror department.
“He was here earlier. He’s had to go to a training seminar. He’s becoming an Auror.” Hermione gestured to the bedside table which was crowded with colourful flowers and confectionaries. “The lilies are from Ginny. Peonies from Molly and Arthur. Candy’s from Ron, George. Neville, too, I think. The card with the very imaginative portrait of you is from Teddy, I think Dromeda drew the stick men and he just scribbled it in.”
The breakfast sandwich that was shoved into his face looked delicious, Harry had to admit. An everything bagel with cheese and egg overflowing the edges.
Ginny came that afternoon. She pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek and told him that she still loved him, just differently. And that they were both much happier than they’d been together. Harry wasn’t sure whether that was hurtful or a relief.
Pressing a kiss to his cheek she said, “Of course. You’re doing alright this morning?”
He laughed as the past-Malfoy asked about the telly, then sat with rapt attention once it was turned on. Malfoy of present times shrugged good naturedly in response. Goosebumps raised along the back of Harry’s neck as he watched the news report alongside their past selves. It was clear that the stories of increased suicides and drug problems causing catatonic states were actually due to the dementors. He watched interestedly as the two said an uncomfortable goodnight to one another, and Malfoy left the flat. Looking on as an outsider, it was evident that gears were turning in each of their minds, both troubled about the dementors.
Niamh rested her hands on her hips and nodded, “Could be because of the concussion, headaches and whatnot. Could be the stress.” She turned to Malfoy, “How long have the two of you been in contact again?”
Licking his lips and looking rather unsteady, Draco nodded.
Spending time with Ron was a strange sort of relief, because he alone refused to walk on eggshells around Harry. He’d make references to things that Harry couldn’t remember, his only modification being that he would pause for the slightest instant to allow Harry an opportunity to ask a question if he’d like. Otherwise he’d natter on with no concern about Draco or weddings plans as though Harry hadn’t forgotten all of it.
“Particularly noteworthy days will have more, of course,” she was saying. Though he didn’t say anything in response, Malfoy must’ve been with her, because the next thing Hermione said was, “I’m really proud of you, Draco.”
for good luck!” Ginny insisted.
He flapped his freckled hands at Harry until he shifted over in the bed so that George could lay down next to him. His weight on top of the covers tugged them off of Harry, leaving his right side chilled. Harry didn’t care, he was so relieved that someone was here to distract him from pondering how fucked up his life was.
Finally, Hermione said, “So they’re organized chronologically, of course. The labels each have a shorthand note with the date and the key event contained within the vials. And then each label’s colour corresponds with who the memory is from. So green is Draco, orange is Ron, and mine are blue. Then there’s red for Ginny, George is pink, Luna’s turquoise – there’s just the one, I think, but it’s an important one. Molly’s memories are purple and Andromeda’s are yellow. Of course, you couldn’t possibly review them all, so we’ve chosen only those most pertinent to your present. ”
“This is bloody
of memories left.”
“Certainly, Healer Brady. Hermione’s been working hard to gather and organize memories appropriately for Harry to view as prescribed.”
“Right,” Harry said, feeling a little wistful. “Have a good day, then.”
Malfoy left his hand wrapped around Harry’s a moment too long after they’d side-alonged. Harry didn’t feel the need to comment on it. The gates of Hogwarts loomed above them and Harry watched Hagrid’s lumbering figure approach.
He remembered going out for a couple of dinners with Dudley just before his memory had become a blank stretch of time. Hermione, Ginny, and Mrs. Weasley had convinced him to give Dudley a shot after he’d told Harry he was happy that Harry wasn’t dead. They’d grabbed pizza and Harry had found great amusement in telling Dudley all about magic. But it was difficult to see how he’d become genuine
At that, Harry ‘accidentally’ let another putty loose in George’s direction, which caused sufficient distraction.
“Right. Well I’m glad to see you’re getting on so well, Astoria.”
He was overwhelmed and confused. The last week of living together had been tense and awkward and somewhat forced, even with those few, shining moments where’d they’d been able to relax and be themselves. But it felt as though they were on the edge of something, maybe. And Harry so, so desperately didn’t want to lose the chance to build back whatever it was he and Draco had had. Malfoy watched him steadily, waiting.
After seeing the alertness with which Draco carried himself the other night when he’d taken Gandalf out, Harry decided perhaps it would be better if they went together. It might be a good opportunity to get to know each other more, after all. They could make it a daily time together.
kissed him goodbye that morning.
list due to the information that Pansy and Neville had been able to dig up on the whereabouts of different pureblood families including the Goyles, who’d fled to the Americas, and the surviving members of the Yaxley family), Ron had raked his hands through his hair and voiced it.
“Brilliant, Ginny,” Harry smiled fondly. “I’ve only ever seen her play seeker during pick-up games at the Burrow, though. That time she played for Gryffindor was when I was banned.”
“So you’ll do it?” Malfoy’s voice was tight.
“Harry!” Arthur wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders and carried on his conversation with Dromeda about muggle food preservation techniques and the best ways in which to pickle beets. As though it were a perfectly normal fatherly act.
Harry opened his mouth to protest Malfoy’s presence, but Niamh beat him to it. “Wait outside,” she instructed firmly. But why would he be waiting at all?
“And the year?”
“I am hungry,” Harry admitted after a moment.
“But…” screwing his mouth up, Harry could find any words. He settled for an awkward shrug.
“Shouldn’t you be less shite at potions since you’re such a great cook?” Malfoy retorted petulantly.
thrown in the mix. Evidently Harry had given Luna an exclusive on his coming out. By the time he’d emptied the chest out around him, Harry had a distinct taste of bile on the back of his tongue. The things the
He did have a fair bit of energy this morning. And he was determined to be in a good mood to counter how very unpleasant he figured this appointment was likely to be. He was glad it was Niamh and not Healer Cunningham who would be managing all of his follow-up, at least.
“Dull life, Draco darling. We both would have hated it equally.”
“See?” George said smugly.
Longeman, out of spite Harry expected, scheduled the meeting for precisely five o’clock. Probably Longeman had realized the reason Harry wanted the meeting later in the day was to ensure that Draco could be present, and five o’clock would make it so Draco would need to apparate immediately after his last lecture and wouldn’t have even a moment to catch his breath at home first.
A shout tore itself from Harry’s throat as he flung himself up to a seated position and his wide, panicked eyes surveyed the dark room around him. A moment later the door swung open to reveal Draco’s silhouette, his wand held aloft.
“No, we’ve all finished with school. She’s off flying with the Harpies. Bucharest this week, I think.”
The man’s eyes were rapidly filling and panic was bubbling up in Harry.
“Thanks, Dromeda. That’s nice of you.”
And now that he was back in the kitchen, cornered by Malfoy, the constricting feeling was back full force. The lights in the kitchen felt too artificial, the stainless steel appliances too clinical.
“I’m sorry Draco,” Astoria looked sympathetic. “I try to steer any conversation to my business and do my darndest to keep away from the vile gossip.”
“Teddy!” Harry crowed. “How’s it going mate? And what’s with the hair? You look as though you’re off to see the Weasleys!”
“I can’t recall if I mentioned it to you, Mr. Potter, but according to your house elf you and Mr. Malfoy had been having a row just prior to your assault.”
“You know,” Harry said on impulse, “I’ve dealt with a lot of truly fucking evil people in life. But Gilderoy Lockhart was the worst of them all.”
Draco was looking paler than usual, with a mask of cool indifference that Harry had been seeing less and less lately. Ron was the sort of blotchy purplish red colour he only turned when he was absolutely livid.
“Yeah,” Harry said with a chuckle, “Yeah I do.”
“Alright,” he said uncertainly as she gave Malfoy’s arm an affectionate squeeze before stepping into the floo and whirling away.
“I guess. So you don’t like to talk about it, then? Did you do those drawings in the study? They’re brilliant.”
I know this name, but I know it,” Draco said, frown deepening by the second. “No, no, no,” he murmured as he ran his finger down the list.
“What’s your favourite?”
Peeling his head off of the table, Harry frowned at her. It wasn’t at all like Niamh to have such poor bedside manner. Speaking of bedside, why was she in his kitchen? He caught sight of Draco over her shoulder, he was still wearing his Auror robes and his jaw was held tight.
Malfoy fled, closing the bathroom door behind him. After a moment of staring at the closed door and pondering how the motion of kissing Harry goodbye had clearly become second nature to Malfoy, Harry picked up the hand mirror and studied his tattoo some more.
Truth was, he’d been eating just the bare minimum that they’d let him get away with. The only moment he’d felt any of his appetite coming back had been right before Ron had gone and ruined it with his thoughtless plan to reunite Harry and Malfoy over lunch.
“It’s alright if you don’t remember, Draco. You know that Hermione, Ron, and Pansy are all looking into her too.”
“I think,” Ron grimaced, “I’ve got another apology to make. See you after my shift though?”
After the game, the Weasleys hosted the Harpies and a plethora of their friends and families for a celebration that had the Burrow bursting at its seams. Every ten minutes or so, Draco would detach himself from whatever conversation he was engaged in to check in on Harry and make sure he wasn’t feeling too fatigued or had a headache.
Bright laughter spilled out of Draco, “You’re a dunce.”
The door to the pub squeaked open, letting in a draft of cold air along with Hermione and Ron. Draco straightened but didn’t move away from Harry. Hermione’s eyes landed on them immediately and she waved a file folder in triumph as she approached.
Ron grinned, “This barmy bird tried to break into Mungo’s when you were brought in.” He ignored Hermione hissing at him that they weren’t meant to overload Harry with stories. “He’s the one who found you, after you were attacked. Anyways he made it all the way to the lifts, and this nurse was losing it. But Oscar wouldn’t leave until Draco pulled out his strict tone. He sounds like mum when he does, it’s awful.”
Staring down at the pages of notes in front of him, Draco sighed. “Fine. But we can talk more about it tomorrow, let’s go to bed.”
“No chance this is all just some hallucination brought on by some nutter WWW product you conned me into testing out, is there? Alternate Universe Altoids or something?”
“Ah, Draco, ‘Arry!” The full effect of her bewitching smile washed over them as she gave them both a kiss on each cheek and passed the baby to Draco, “’Ere, take Victoire, she misses her favourite uncle. ‘Arry, how have you been?”
Encantado’s sign was glowing softly, the letters sparkling in a subtly enticing way that looked classy rather than gauche. There was a wizard in dress robes with a genial smile on the stoop, holding a list of reservations.
“Well,” Harry replied with a chuckle. “I’d love to hear what you want for your stag, but can you give me some of that pain potion first?”
Harry had been quite pleased when he’d come up with the idea yesterday. He’d made sure to pull Hermione aside after dinner to ask advice on where he should take Draco. This morning, Harry had sent Oscar on a double mission to pick up flowers and book reservations at Encantado’s.
“What is your worst memory?”
“Hmm. Have you been having nausea?”
When Harry pulled back, wiping furtively at his tears, Draco took his place in Molly’s arms. Harry was surprised to see that Draco hugged Molly just as desperately as he had. He bent awkwardly over so he could bury his face in her shoulder and hung on several moments too long.
She beamed. The woman looked like an angel on earth. Harry had to remind himself that Draco was firmly gay as jealously squirmed in his gut. And, of course, they were there to determine if she’d been involved in the crime of assaulting him and erasing his memory. Which was not on most people’s check list of desirable traits when seeking a romantic partner.
“Yeah,” Harry said, pushing the blankets off and standing up.
“You alright?” Malfoy asked softly, after a while.
“It’s Mr. Malfoy,” Kreacher whispered to Harry, turning wide-eyed from the closed door to regard Harry who stood at the end of the hall. “Is Master Harry wanting to let him in?”
Heading to the kitchen, with Gandalf at his heels, Harry figured he may as well watch a memory. Ideally, today would be the last day he’d be stuck with only watching one. He let Gandalf out into the yard, and when he opened the door for him to come back in, Oscar swooped in with a happy hoot.
“What’s your favourite colour?” Harry asked.
“Please. Not as strong as you have it, with milk if you don’t mind.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, completely surprised that was how Draco thought of the day. “You lied. You clearly knew who we were and you didn’t say anything. That’s why I testified for you.”
“Let me help,” Harry said. When Draco appeared hesitant, he pushed forward, “By that I meant I’m helping. We obviously made a good team with the dementor stuff.”
Malfoy flicked his eyes over to Harry’s for the briefest moment before returning his focus to the screen, “Jeff Goldblum.”
Malfoy shrunk a little under her assessing gaze. “Just a couple of days.”
“Let’s call it quits and head home for the night. Make up some hot cocoa, what do you say?”
Draco thanked her and pressed a kiss to her cheek before holding the door open for Harry. A chill winter wind had picked up while they’d been inside, and they both hunched their shoulders against it.
Draco was already pulling out the list of people who might have interest in harming both he and Harry, while Harry and Ron shook their heads.
“Good! It’s nearly noon,” Harry said, smile broadening as he revealed the large bouquet of colourful spring flowers he’d hidden behind his back. “Will you do me the honour of accompanying me to dinner this evening?”
Everyone had the good grace to pretend that the state of Harry and Draco’s fragile relationship hadn’t regressed. Everyone, that is, but Molly at Sunday dinner. She’d tutted over them and told them a not-at-all pointed story about a fight she and Arthur had had when they were young, and how important it was to cut one another some slack.
Hermione started repeating the name over and over, as if it would trigger some sort of recognition in the well-organized bookshelves of her brain.
A shiver ran down his spine and he swallowed heavily. He nodded a few times before Fleur instructed him to go out into the garden to say hello to everyone else and then turned to Draco, to begin a conversation in rapid-fire French.
“Yup,” George popped the p.
“Merlin, no!” Harry huffed and scanned the ecstatic crowd. “I’m perfectly happy to be out of attention as much as possible. Does that surprise you?”
“I’d made you promise not to,” Draco said, apologetically.
Scanning Draco’s tired face, Harry noted, “It’s the middle of the night.”
With a shrug, Malfoy said, “You taught me how to do a Patronus, you know.”
“And your full name? And birthday?”
“So,” Niamh said, handing a list of care instructions to Harry and Hermione each, “You are to rest for the next three days
Hunched over the pensieve, siphoning a silvery memory back into his temple, was Draco. His hair fell in front of his face and his bottom lip was held tightly in his teeth. Harry waited until Draco had finished with replacing the memory before stepping into the room.
“I invited him to move back in,” Harry said, not sure why his tone was so defensive. “I want to start figuring this all out. I’m ready. Just waiting around and pretending none of this has happened wasn’t doing me any good.”
Draco reached out and squeezed Harry’s hand gently.
Searching for something you couldn’t remember having was a whole new level of frustration, Harry thought as he hauled himself up into the attic of Grimmauld Place. Especially in a house with so many damned rooms. He’d already thoroughly searched his bedroom, the master suite, the sitting room, drawing room and even Malfoy’s study to no avail.
, here. I figured the two of you could review it and see if you know any of the names.”
Chuckling, Harry said, “Guess we’d better get moving.”
Both Malfoy and Hermione snapped, “No!”
There was an edge of panic in his voice and Harry immediately felt badly for frightening him.
“I’m ready to ask some questions,” Harry clarified turning from her to Ron, who was chewing on his bottom lip nervously.
A booming announcement echoed around the stadium, announcing the entrance of the Harpies. The entire west side of the stadium jumped to their feet screaming alongside them as the players were announced and flew a loop around the pitch. Ginny slowed down as she approached the Weasley’s box so she could throw a wink at Harry and Draco before racing to catch up with her team.
Harry couldn’t help but snort at the look on Draco’s face, which caused him to choke on his tea and begin to cough violently.
“Thank you,” Draco sighed. “I’m going to go let Zinnia know you’re back alright, then… and head back to class.”
“Then let’s get you up to bed, shall we?”
“Why not?”
Malfoy’s gaze faltered once more, and he picked up a paper to rifle through the pages. “To remember, I suppose.”
“About damn time,” Harry grumbled to the Ministry owl as he scribbled a response insisting that the meeting occur after five o’clock in the afternoon.
Harry frowned, uncertain where Ron was going but suspecting he was already fumbling through it just as much as the last time. This wasn’t likely to soothe his blinding headache, anyhow.
Thanks for reading! Comments welcome :) Stay safe everyone
Harry raised his brows.
He frowned when he saw light climbing up the stairs from the floor below. He found Draco at his desk in the study, with his hands buried in his hair. His auror robes were hanging off the back of his chair and his badge rested on the writing top beside a scattering of papers and a quill balanced in a half-empty ink bottle. Gandalf was sprawled on the floor in front of the desk, dead to the world.
When Draco arrived back and sent Molly on home, Harry wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or trepidatious. But when Harry turned down dinner, Draco simply pulled a chair up to Harry’s bedside and asked if he was feeling confused about the memories he’d seen.
“Have you been eating?” he asked.
After dinner, Ron and Malfoy headed up to their training room to spar. Apparently they had a bit of an interdepartmental physical defense competition coming up, where the use of defensive magic was strictly prohibited.
“Except for the fact that very recently you almost fucking DIDN’T!” Draco was so angry now that he was flinging his arms for emphasis. Harry thought that if he did so just a little more aggressively he’d lose balance and tip himself over. “And yet, you seem to believe you know better than a team of trained Aurors.”
Harry cringed. The thought of having Malfoy with him during something as intimate as a healer’s appointment was deeply uncomfortable. He immediately regretted it when a hurt expression slapped its way onto Malfoy’s face before he tamped it down and settled his expression into a neutral mask.
With a snort, Harry broke the envelope’s seal and scanned it’s contents.
Draco blinked, then turned to Harry. He shook his head in a motion somewhere between the gesture for “no” and the move you do to get wrackspurts out. “No,” he said in a tone more definitive than he gesture was. “No, we are going to enjoy our dinner. Annalise, please carry on.”
“You’re avoiding calling me by name, aren’t you, Harry?” Malfoy asked now, snapping Harry out of his daydreaming.
“Watching Cedric be murdered,” Harry whispered into the dark. “If we hadn’t agreed to work together, if we hadn’t wanted things to be fair for both of us… Maybe I would’ve left him behind and he’d still be alive.”
Their telly set up was truly amazing. The screen was far larger than any Harry had seen before (and the Dursley’s were always the sort of people who thought that bigger was better). And the surround-sound really immersed you in the film. Despite that, just as he had in the memory earlier, Harry found himself watching Malfoy. The man smiled at the fun moments of the film, and winced when the characters found themselves in danger. Once in a while he’d glance Harry’s way to see what he thought of the movie, and Harry would smile to reassure him.
“It’s not your fault, Harry,” Draco smiled sadly. “And I have no intention of letting her ruin our evening.”
“Oh!” Draco startled.
Kreacher appeared in front of them, offering a glass to Draco, “A cup of water, Mr. Malfoy?”
Comments and kudos welcome! Stay safe and healthy everyone <3
The curled up in the sitting room on chairs that looked too fancy to risk dropping greasy breakfast food on and dug in.
Draco’s brows drew together sharply. “Where’s the pensieve?”
“Learning how to fly. Flying,” Malfoy told himself firmly before casting again, “
, 2000.”
“Oh,” Harry said, feeling a little regretful to hear it. “Well, what would you like to do with the day?”
Saturday morning Harry and Draco decided to watch the next memory together. In it, Harry dragged Malfoy along to Grimmauld Place to practice his patronus against a boggart. Given the fate of Malfoy’s father (sentenced to the dementor’s kiss for his war crimes), Harry had been correct in guessing the boggart would take the same form for Draco as it did for Harry. It was strange to see Grimmauld Place as it had been. Dark, dirty, and unwelcoming. It was strange that Harry had become so accustomed to the place as a warm home after only about two weeks.
The-Harry-that-was collapsed on the sidewalk, showing no sign of recognition. He was, in fact, covering his ears with his eyes screwed tight. Malfoy ran towards Harry, stopping a few metres away as a dementor turned to face him with a hiss.
“Are you seriously calling
The thought of transporting via magic made Harry’s whole body tense protectively. After an unpleasantly jolty elevator ride, they emerged onto the main floor and wound their way past those unfortunate souls waiting to be triaged. They slipped out the window and onto the road, which was full of muggles rushing around so busily that they didn’t notice the three people who walked straight through the glass of the condemned department store onto the walkway.
“We were just wrapping up, Healer,” Longeman smiled stiffly at Niamh.
Harry glared at Draco, who was illuminated warmly as they passed under a street light. “Sure I do, that was the rule of the game. To make it so we could get to know each other as we are.”
Dudley responded with a dismissive noise and tossed a chunk of cheese and sausage into Oscar’s open mouth. The owl had been inching across the table towards the meat lover’s pizza throughout dinner. Whining, Gandalf pawed at Dudley’s legs until he dropped an even larger piece of pizza for the crup.
Merlin. Harry’s heart jolted uncomfortably back into its proper location.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco stepped forward and wrapped Harry in a tight hug. Harry could practically feel the words
The moment the pop of apparition sounded, Harry tossed his book aside and headed to the front hall. As the door opened, he froze, suddenly (and ridiculously, he thought, irritably) shy.
Malfoy stumbled over the spell the first two times. The third time he managed to pronounce it properly, but nothing happened.
With a shrug Harry admitted, “I want to take you out on a nice date.”
Ron scooted his chair as close as possible to Harry and gripped Harry’s bicep firmly. “You’re my best mate, yeah? You’re like another brother to me. We’ve been through some wild things. Some mad in the greatest fucking way. Some terrifying and absolute shite. I wouldn’t change a thing of it though if it meant I might not be friends with you. And I know I’ve not always been the easiest bloke to be friends with, but I hope you know how important you are to me. And Hermione, too. So, Harry- will you be my best man?”
“Er…” Harry grimaced. He really hadn’t thought it was obvious. “Yeah. I have. I’m not exactly sure what to call you. I mean, neither option really seems right.”
“’Lo Professor, good to see you.”
“He didn’t do it,” he replied in a low growl.
“Apparently,” Harry said as she guided him back to bed with a strong arm around his back, “I’m to be treated like a child for the foreseeable future.”
“I see,” Harry replied gently. He reached for Draco, “Either way, it’s late and you’ve got training in the morning. I don’t want you off your game and coming home with any missing bits because you weren’t paying proper attention during duelling class.”
Years of being treated like a child while having to deal with adult situations had left Harry particularly affronted with the idea.
With a soft chuckle, Draco asked, “Do you think you’d have a preference when you do feel ready?”
. Harry’s soul was preparing to clamber right out of him to reassure Malfoy.
Malfoy quirked a brow up, clearly suspicious about Harry’s timing.
way,” Draco said once he’d determined Harry wasn’t likely to drown himself in his tea.
Ron’s fortitude drained away, and he shrunk an inch or two. Malfoy stepped back just enough to be able to stride past Ron down the Alley without having to push him out of the way.
“What?” Harry scowled
His first full day home, after spending much of the previous night feeling sorry for himself, Harry determinedly avoided thinking about how he shared the home with Draco Malfoy. He kept to the few rooms that he’d already seen. He avoided looking at the walls and the front of the refrigerator (he’d thought about removing the photographs that made such restrictions necessary, but he didn’t want to make it too obvious to Hermione that was avoiding looking at them).
Harry thought perhaps the statement was meant to come across as apologetic, but it felt more demanding than anything.
After, Teddy and Andromeda headed home for the afternoon straight from the park, leaving Harry and Malfoy to walk the few blocks home on their own. Malfoy withdrew, becoming tense and silent.
His stomach was twisting with an unpleasant mixture of excitement and anxiety.
Now, he turned their brief interaction in the middle of Diagon Alley in his mind as obsessively as he’d done with their more distant ones. The way Malfoy had approached him as though he wanted to grab hold of Harry, but knew he couldn’t. The way he’d held back his anger to ask how Harry was, before telling Ron off and storming away. The riot of emotions that Harry could see in the small movements of his lips and brows and hands. How those piercings looked in real life. The way he had looked inarguably striking in his uniform. Harry was surprised to think that Malfoy would probably make a great Auror. Commanding and collected, even when he was distraught.
“I’m sorry for Friday. And Tuesday.”
“Let me tell you,” he insisted, “we’re better friends than we were then. Anyways. To answer your question, I am alright, mostly. As alright as I’ll ever be, I think. Still use you as a buffer for mum, sometimes.
it would probably still be there, somewhere. It just didn’t seem important enough at the time to be easily accessible in my memory now. Hence my current method.”
George’s letter explained that the object was a sensitive piece of magic, that wouldn’t do well with the many other enchantments and charms in his shop (or his flat on the floor above the shop) until it had settled for the proper amount of time. Squinting his eyes as though it would help him filter out extraneous objects, Harry looked for the orb. It was apparently glass at the centre, wrapped within thin strips of various metals, similar in appearance to a remembrall. George said it was meant to capture sounds for replaying at a later time. Harry had no idea whether it was meant to be used as spy-ware or like a muggle CD player.
Harry froze in the middle of the stairwell.
“Yes, er, well… seemed like the closest to correct, I suppose?”
Walking properly into the room, Harry chuckled, “Yes, I’m sure he was delighted to have someone with proper Black lineage in this place.”
!” Teddy said, clearly on a roll now. “Gandy
Harry trailed after Malfoy out of the room, feeling utterly stunned.
late for dinner. Just because I’m missing out on a half hour of the Weasley marathon doesn’t mean I’m late. Half your siblings aren’t even here yet anyways!”
“Hey,” Harry smiled awkwardly.
He’d broken, repaired, and replaced half a dozen photographs to their place on the wall by the time Ron came in. Harry looked up at him dolefully from where he’d flopped onto the couch. Heaving a sigh, Ron offered him a cup of tea and regarded him steadily.
“What the
I unfortunately can't promise that I'll maintain this frequency of updates, but I have a few chapters written in advance now which I like to do before posting so that if I need to shift and iron out some plot points I have more space, so I'll do my best!
“Merlin,” Harry shook his head. While he’d managed to come around to the fact that he was, indeed, more interested in men than he’d ever been in any girl, it was hard to hear he’d been such an arse as to do that to Ginny, who of course he cared about.
“Where do you think he’s going?” he asked.
“Alright,” Draco conceded, letting Harry pull him to his feet.
Ginny preened dramatically and fluffed at her hair. Harry hadn’t even noticed, but it was shorter than it had been last week at the hospital, cut into a soft, waving bob.
At Harry’s nod, Malfoy called for Kreacher, who immediately popped into the room. “Could you please clean up?” He wrinkled his nose, “Sorry, I burnt dinner so that one pan’s a bit of a mess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Grand,” Niamh said with a look of satisfaction. Harry wished he had the range of motion to roll his eyes. “And what is the last thing you remember? What day was it, what were you doing?”
Deep purple smudged under Draco’s eyes and his muscles carried an extra tension.
Malfoy gave him a reluctant smile in response. “I’ll admit you do the vast majority of the cooking. Breakfast for dinner is about the most I can manage. Usually, anyways,” he chuckled lowly and something sparked in Harry’s abdomen. “Now I think of it, that’s probably why it’s your favourite. Just to humour me.”
There was probably over two-hundred memories in the case, the vast majority were green.
“I’m fine, Harry. I just need to figure out who Clarice Brunetto is.”
“She’s right famous,” Harry spoke loudly into Draco’s ear once they’d settled in. At least a quarter of the people wearing Holyhead robes had
“Is Draco here - ” Her eyes landed on Malfoy’s slumped figure just behind Harry. “Thank Circe’s golden cunt. Draco! You can’t just disappear into the night!”
Harry took that to mean:
Teddy nodded enthusiastically, shifting around on Harry’s lap so he could see both Harry and his grandmum. “Lion RAWR!”
The next morning Harry woke early from a nightmare that left nothing but a lingering sense of anxiety. He tried for a while to fall back to sleep, it was still dark out and he didn’t want to cause Gandalf to stir and become excited. Recently (and Harry wasn’t quite sure which of them had started it) he and Draco had begun to leave their bedroom doors open at night and the crup would lie on the hallway floor in between them. Finally, Harry sighed and crept out of bed. He hushed the whimper of excitement from Gandalf as he glanced into the dimness of Draco’s room to confirm he was still sleeping.
Thursday morning, Harry headed to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes – ostensibly to help George stock shelves.
, “We’ll keep ourselves occupied.”
“And Gandalf?”
He cracked his eyes open and winced at the light. Merlin, what a terrible headache he had. Before he could complain about the brightness, Niamh’s head was blocking the source of light. She looked sideways, and it took Harry a moment to realize that it was actually his head that was sideways, pressed against the unforgiving dining table.
As it turned out, Draco had a bank account which didn’t have a card, but with a lot of money available, and some investments that he could sell if he needed more, which seemed quite unlikely. There were also two extra credit cards in his name, which Harry promised he would teach Draco to use when he was able to go out again. They also found the contract for the flat, signed for him by Mary, and the form that gave her the authority to do so on his behalf. The flat had been bought for a sum that had Harry moaning, claiming that it was a ridiculous amount even for a huge, posh, new flat like this.
“Not everyone in the magical world knows everything about, say, animagi. It’s like that, basically.”
There was another piece of information that greatly disturbed him: After about two months awake, he was able to lick his lips, and realised that he had grown a beard. Presumably muggles had some odd ideas about beards, as Mary had thought it was perfectly acceptable to just let him, Draco Malfoy, 23 years old, grow one – to save him the friction from shaving, apparently. She understood now that he was distressed, she said, and promised to get rid of it as soon as possible.
“Gift baskets sounds good,” he decided.
“Yes, and...”
So he missed Pansy. He wanted to know what she thought about everything: The illness itself, of course, the muggle technology, the funeral of the Queen Mother, Mary The Muggle Nurse (would she be in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, hypotethically?), what strategies he could use for making sure he did not reveal his ignorance about muggle matters… he needed Pansy, but all he had was himself.
“I suppose the beach and the sea bring some nature, but no, I haven’t seen anything like gardens yet. My radius of movement is still fairly small. But next week we are taking a taxi, that is a muggle car with a driver, to a place where I will be fitted for a wheelchair that is better for outside use, and Kenny says that should increase my radius quite a bit, so I’m excited for that. And we’re planning a taxi trip to the castle, with Harry, too, before it gets too cold.”
“Absolutely. Now, tell me about how your tastes got so broad!”
So that was another chapter speedrunning an entire year of recovery. Still, there's been some growth and learning as well. And next chapter our story begins in earnest.
“Thank God, because I have done everything I can, and to be honest, I don’t know if she’ll make it, but what the fuck do I know anyway, I’m not a doctor. We just need to hold it together until they’ve left, and then I’ll scream for a bit. Shit.” He nodded decisively. “Such a lovely woman, too. This must have been terrible for you, mr. Malfoy, finding her like this.”
“There we are, then, this could be it. Was it a big fire?”
“Well, that should be alright then. How long does the process take?”
“Hum. Strawberries?” The first local strawberries always came just before his birthday. Well, perhaps they were earlier this far south, a bit, but still, they should be in season. And even if they weren’t, muggles moved food over distances, he’d read that somewhere.
A third detailed the known causes, most of which he knew, as they fit with the questions he had been asked by the Healer.
“I don’t see how that can be fixed, really. The connection could be there, it could exist, but Mother would need to know enough to buy a phone in the first place, and then know the spells to use, and how to use them, and on top of that she would need to know which part is the SIM card, remember how Kenny had to do that part for me, and then she would need to get the information about her number to me. That is a lot – she doesn’t even know where I am, I think.”
“You were there?”
They made tea by boiling water in the microwave, first Harry, to demonstrate, and then Draco. That part was easy: Power to the maximum setting, time to one minute, open to see it at a rolling boil in the mug, hopefully. Snape had grown up among muggles, Draco suddenly recalled – he wondered if the man had ever experienced with using a microwave instead of a cauldron. The thought felt equally absurd and likely, somehow.
“Well, I certainly did when I came here, and I had not been privy to whatever seems to be happening to wizarding attitudes towards muggles, so I feared for my life until Harry told me I was being very silly.” A drama queen, he had said, but Draco wasn’t about to tell anyone that, not even Pansy.
Another loud, long beep, and then a friendly woman’s voice saying “Hello, The Little Chocolatier, this is Brenda?” and he immediately went into his politest dealing-with-salespeople-mode and hoped that would be enough.
“I don’t understand, though,” Harry said, “Why your nurse would buy something this posh. Why you would, oh, that makes perfect sense, especially after the chocolate, but why would she not shop around for a bit, find something a little more reasonably priced?”
Draco nodded. That made sense. Mary certainly didn’t work all the time, that would be too much. And she didn’t have the cleaning lady come in anymore, she did that herself, because she had more time than she had at first, caring for him. And Vicky no longer got the groceries, Mary always went out to get those herself. And she talked about how nice it was to have more time to read. They spent quite a bit of time chatting, too. All her time certainly wasn’t occupied with helping him.
He numbly allowed her to take him side-along, and headed into the living room to collapse on the chesterfield.
“Alright,” Harry nodded.
Aberforth nodded at them gruffly, though his eyes were smiling, “Boys.”
I hope you enjoyed! Sorry for the slow burn torture ;P
“I’m sorry.”
Niamh did, indeed, up Harry’s memory allowance right up to three – with the caveat that he drop back to one and check in with her if there were any concerns. She hesitantly agreed that he could ‘
Draco smiled, “Well this is one you already know most of the answers to. I enjoy Quidditch, chess, movies, walks with Gandalf, time with our friends…” He hesitated, and while his cheeks were already flushed in the cool air, Harry was pretty sure they darkened with embarrassment.
“That’s fine,” Harry snapped. “If that’s all, I think Kreacher will see you to the door.”
Instead, Draco looked completely discouraged. “My sanity?”
There was  moment of silence.
“Her. I know this name – Clarice Brunetto.”
Draco burst out laughing, “You dunce.”
“Right, then,” he leaned forward and allowed the memory to suck him in.
“Yup. Hermione being very Hermione-y and inviting herself over to help with Dementor research, that dinner with Dudley – which really helped put things into context, actually,
The Harry and Malfoy of present-time stood a ways back as they watched their past selves begin to argue over whether or not Harry needed to be accompanied home. Once Harry’s past-self began to walk away with Malfoy trailing silently behind, Harry finally turned to look at the man beside him.
“Yes, ma’am,” Malfoy looked up at his friend, lips quirked up into a playful smile.
“Oui, merci Annalise.”
Harry didn’t even pretend to hesitate before plunging into the next memory.
The crisp evening air and the fog that swirled around the street lamps was calming, and Harry linked his fingers with Draco’s and inhaled deeply.
“Did you do better than the last time?” Harry asked in amusement.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy was terribly attractive, and his past-self had obviously done something about that.
“Thank you,” she reached to squeeze Draco’s hand. “But I’ve been terribly rude. Talking so much. How are the both of you? Has your recovery been going alright, Harry?”
But then Harry would think about how they’d gone from what Harry
“Can’t believe I fucking listened to you.”
“How was your day?” Harry asked worriedly.
A sprout of guilt raised up in the middle of Harry’s irritation, but he wasn’t quite ready to let go of the issue.
Harry bit his lip and broke the eye contact, which had caused something of a riot in his stomach. “It’s your turn.”
“Just… Just leave m alone, Hermione,” he ground out.
Harry winced, “Me too.”
Harry smiled a little to himself as he poured the water. He didn’t turn around to see Malfoy’s reaction as he said, “I know how you take your tea, Draco.”
Molly managed the situation quickly, getting Harry back on his feet and ushering him to carry the unconscious Draco back to his flat. Harry kept his hold on Draco’s hand while they followed them along.
With teary eyes, Draco looked up to the roof and rolled his lips into his mouth for a moment. “I… I don’t care what they think of me really. The rest of the world has never understood. I just – I need you to know who I am."
Being careful with it seemed a bit more of a challenge when Beauty the boarhound (Harry was aggrieved to learn he’d missed the passing of Fang that summer) jumped all over Malfoy to wash his face. While she was just a puppy, she was still ridiculously massive.
The way Malfoy was looking at Harry, as though he needed to soak in every last detail, made Harry uncomfortable. He focused all his attention on picking a loose thread on his jumper before saying, “Malfoy, today’s February fifteenth. Well, sixteenth, now I suppose.”
There was a moment of quiet before Draco replied, “You do?”
“You’re engaged?” He asked, delighted enough that he nearly forgot his own predicament, before realizing with a plunging dread that not everything might be as it seems. “To Ron, right?”
“Right.” Frowning, Harry turned away from the trick wands and glanced around the shop to check that they were alone before divulging his concerns. George listened attentively, without so much as a teasing smirk.
Andromeda slipped her arm over Harry’s shoulders as he stood watching. “You going to eat something, Harry?”
And yet.
Something tugged at Harry’s heart as he watched his past self, choked with emotion, pull Draco into a tight embrace.
Draco sat with Harry, helping him untangle the memories. Harry seemed not have lost any parts of the memories he’d seen, luckily. He just needed a little help clarifying them and sorting them into a mental time line. It was as though the lens into his memories was fogged, blurring what Harry could see. Draco came along and wiped away the fog for him.
“Yeah, uh…”
And yet, over the months that had been scrubbed from his memory, they’d truly, undeniably become not just his best mate’s family but
Harry gaped at him for a long moment before realizing that Draco wasn’t being at all serious. “You ridiculous, dramatic git!”
Harry was not sufficiently braced for the ball of feathers that bounced off the side of his face before settling properly onto his shoulder. The bird nuzzled itself into the crook of Harry’s neck.
“Yes, well. I thought I’d be in some trouble for showing magic to a muggle, didn’t I?”
, a monthly calendar with the Auror training schedule marked in a neat hand, and a photograph.
Ginny and Draco moved onto discussing Quidditch. “Harry,” Ginny looked back to him, “I’ve got my first game of the spring season a month from this weekend, you’ll be there right?”
Harry wondered. Was she concerned Harry was ready to go back to brawling with Malfoy?
Harry followed along as their past selves headed to the park and watched his own image become blurry as he headed across the field with Andromeda. Turning to watch how Teddy thrived on Draco’s undivided attention, giggling happily while strapped in a baby swing, Harry felt warmth flood him. He completely missed the signs of the dementors coming in.
“Tomatoes are a fruit,” Malfoy said, amping up his posh accent for the effect.
Draco chuckled, “I’m partial to the good semi-dark chocolate from Honeyduke’s. The kind Professor Lupin used to keep in stock.”
“Yes,” Draco replied, grimacing. “I wrote back to Healer Brady to ensure it was alright. Because the next two memories on the roster were really one situation. It’s just split between me and Molly.” At the confused look on Harry’s face, he added, “Remember the newspaper with the photograph of you carrying me unconscious down Diagon Alley?”
Rolling his eyes, Draco explained, “Well most of the Weasleys are at every game. Luna and Nev, too, when they’re not off in some exotic locale investigating strange life forms. It’s just that everyone but us has missed a game or two. And Ginny had a phenomenal starting season last summer and fall. So she’s got it in her mad head that we bring her luck.”
want to get to do that?” Harry added.
“I think,” He said in a wavering voice, “I’ll just pop over to the Burrow for a bit, say hello to Molly.”
He didn’t need to finish the thought for Malfoy to understand what he was getting at. Malfoy had said the previous day, Valentine’s day, was meant to be special.
“It’s alright, Oscar. Really,” Harry said, rather charmed by the owl’s protectiveness. Oscar hopped from Hermione’s arm back to his shoulder and nibbled on his hair before flying away.
“We could just go somewhere muggle though,” Hermione suggested as Harry bent down to ruffle Gandalf’s fur.
Harry could understand that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” Dudley said mouth full of pizza, “How
Harry wavered on the edge of asking Draco about his mother, but remembered he was meant to answer the question as well when Draco raised expectant brows. “Er.. I like Quidditch as well, obviously. Relaxing with friends. Cooking. I can always get into a good movie,” he smiled at Draco, feeling as though this was the sort of thing two people might connect over on a first date.
A gaggle of teenagers, whom Harry supposed must be seventeen or eighteen since they weren’t away at school, giggled as they walked by. One of them was bold enough to drop his gaze to Harry and Draco’s interlocked fingers and waggle his brows at them. Harry favoured him with a wry grin. It was good to know that not everyone in Wizarding London was stuck in the belief that Draco was evil and Harry was only bewitched into homosexuality.
He watched Harry with steady, grey eyes until Harry gave in and nodded his agreement.
Dudley looked highly skeptical, “Is this revenge for the time I told you Freddy Mercury was real royalty? I’ll believe it when I see it.”
It was really quite beautiful.
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco bit down on a smile, blinking back his tears. “Fuck,” he muttered, “I’ve got to go to training.”
By the time dinner rolled around their friends had abandoned them to deal with the awkwardness themselves. Draco eyed Harry shrewdly, leaving Harry feeling as exposed as he had the night before.
feeling stood out so clearly in Harry’s memory was because of what he know knew about them). They’d interacted during the trials, too. That had gone alright, Harry supposed.
“Other than the first day afterwards, great. Draco was able to help me untangle the order of the memories reasonably well."
Malfoy grimaced sympathetically at Harry.
“I just…” Ron waved a big hand in the air, grasping for a good explanation. He dropped it with a sigh. “I’m sorry, Harry.”
He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Alright then. Okay. I promise I will stop looking for Clarice Brunetto. But, Harry, you need to keep watching the memories.”
They spent a happy hour following Teddy around as he clambered up play structures and down the tot slide. When he was strapped into the swings by Malfoy, Teddy screamed for Harry.
“Teddy, Lord of Sandwich Making,” Malfoy said in a dramatic Shakespearean accent, “will you help me decide what ingredients I require for the most perfect of sandwiches? Then, we shall be off to the park to celebrate, methinks.”
“What did he say?”
“After Jennings had that injury last year and she took on the role of First Seeker she’s been steadily wowing the fans,” Draco grinned. “She really is something.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry swallowed the lump in his throat as he sat down across the table from him. “I’ve been avoiding saying your name, but you’ve been…” Harry settled on “guarded,” feeling it sounded reasonably diplomatic. “It seems like you, I don’t know… censor yourself in front of me? You’re so much different when there’s other people around. Or you’ll joke a little and then just… shut down?”
“Are you ready to hear about your life, Harry?”
“Hm.”
“Well,” George said, voice quiet, but warm, “I’ve started seeing someone. I quite like her.”
Harry snorted, “You sure seemed it last night.” Malfoy blushed and Harry, feeling a little guilty, added, “I want you to stay. I want to get to know you.”
“Ron’s been helping,” Harry noted, leaning his hip on the desk and picking up a piece of parchment with his friend’s distinctive scrawl. It listed all muggle surveillance cameras in the area.
“No, really. This all impacts you as much as me; you ought to be there to hear what they say first hand.” Worried that this still wouldn’t come across as sincere enough for Malfoy he added, “And I bet you’re the sort of person who will pay proper attention to what the healers say, which you know, I’m not. So I need you to make sure I don’t forget anything important.”
Frowning, Harry grabbed a book and decided to wait in the sitting room until the two made it back safely. Diggle probably would have ensured they came back home, Harry knew. But he wanted to make sure for himself. When they returned and Malfoy looked surprised to see Harry up, Harry told him he just couldn’t sleep after his long nap earlier.
“No, I was up.”
Hermione shook her head in response. “It happened twice. The second time you were caught by surprise. Draco Malfoy was nearby though, just having been to a muggle bank, and he managed to conjure a non-corporeal patronus. He saved you.” She paused, letting that sink in with Harry, before continuing on. “Between your own encounters and news reports you’d seen, the two of you realized that there was a serious problem with dementors invading muggle areas of London following the war. Draco was sure that he could figure out a way to destroy them, and so you began to work together.”
Twisting around Harry found his skin clear and smooth. “Huh.”
Harry’s stomach lurched, “Guess so.”
Harry’s dreams were fragmented and stressful. On waking, a sharp headache pushed out all memory of what it was he’d been dreaming about anyways. With relief, he found a pain potion on his side table which he took down in a series of small sips. The sound of soft voices drifted from downstairs.
“No? Why not?” Harry asked, affronted.
Draco jumped to his feet, “The fidelius charm has been compromised for
Harry stepped out of the floo and some part of his heart that had been askew clicked into place. Sunlight streamed into the sitting room and the smell of cinnamon and baked apples drifted from the kitchen. Molly rushed into the room just as Draco stepped out of the floo behind Harry.
Hermione reached across the table to squeeze Harry’s shoulder. “And we’ll be right here when you get back.”
“I forgot about that. Why did we agree to go out in public? I thought we were avoiding public. Surely going to Ginny’s game was enough time in public for one weekend.”
start that process until you’ve been given go ahead by me, yeah?”
being checked into hospital and presumably treated by St. Mungo’s finest.
“Nah. Why?” Wiggling her brows she asked, “Wanna talk about him?”
” Draco snapped, leaning forward and fixing Longeman with eyes like flint. “With no progress made on the case you’ll be pulling his security detail?”
“Sure,” Harry promised. “Sounds like a plan then.”
Harry choked on his oyster, which thankfully, was quite slippery and managed to make it down alright in the end. He widened his eyes incredulously at Draco.
Harry undid the buttons and then nudged Draco to lift his hips up so Harry could pull his pants and trousers down towards his knees. In all the weeks Harry had been contemplating this, he’d imagined he would feel much less certain about it. Perhaps if Draco weren’t so hesitant, he would have been. But he wrapped his fingers around Draco and pumped a few times, before lowering his lips with a small smirk.
Suddenly Draco’s sweet smile twisted nervously. “There’s something I should’ve told you a while ago. But I suppose I was too much of a coward to.”
Hermione grinned at him, “You definitely put the most effort into this part of the house.”
selfish right now?” Draco hollered. “You have no fucking clue, Harry. You have no idea how terrifying this has been for everyone that cares about you! If you did you wouldn’t be jaunting off for foolhardy runs. And you know what? If it’s selfish of me to be scared for your safety, to be upset that
“Well, I happen to know that Hermione has a study schedule written up for you already,” Malfoy replied as he pulled the door of the study closed behind them. “Come on, next floor’s got the best room. I can’t believe that Ron didn’t make sure you saw it right away when you first came home.”
Taking a step away from the counter so he was within two feet of Harry, Draco asked in a deathly quiet voice, “Do you think I am the kind of man who doesn’t honour his word?”
Despite her concerns, Molly was ecstatic to hear that Harry and Draco were back together and made treacle tart to celebrate. The two of them graciously received comments ranging from congratulatory to rather inappropriate teasing from George and Bill.
Now, seeing the despairing reluctance in Draco’s eyes, Harry’s heart ached. He was grateful for the warmth of the fire at his back and how its soft light somehow lessened the harshness of the topic.
“Right. Sorry,” though he looked a little sulky about it, as though he wanted to point out that neither of their memory selves had been talking anyways.
Harry could’ve stood there like that all night. But Draco pulled away.
“Merlin. So… every one of his books?”
“October tenth or so. It’s not like I’ve been doing much with my days, haven’t been keeping the best track.”
She passed him a pain potion and waited for him to gulp it down before carrying on with her lecture. “You could have caused yourself serious brain damage today. As it is you’re probably going to have a massive headache and dizziness for the next day or so. You’ll certainly have some confusion around the memories you watched today for a long time, possibly forever. That said,” she flicked her eyes over to Draco, “he is not to rewatch them. You may talk through them when he is feeling better and do you best to untangle them that way.”
“Harry,” Draco chided.
“Packed it. We’re bringing it back.”
Stay safe and healthy everyone.
“Ugh. I did not.” What an unpleasant discovery.
“Well, this is a pleasant surprise,” she said in a tone that was either phenomenal acting or truly genuine. Addressing the elf that entered the room she added, “Thank you, Sable.”
Hermione’s eyes danced with amusement. Harry knew it was ridiculous that
Turning back to the scene, Harry watched as the Dementors approached his past-self and as Draco’s past-self snuck behind them to cast a shapeless patronus. Harry’s patronus immediately followed, and between the two of them they pushed the dementors over to an intersecting alley, where a talisman glowed on the ground. Harry held his breath as Draco raised his wand and cast another spell, causing the scene to light up with blinding light.
. Harry assumed Draco didn’t want to further risk the very delicate state of their current progress. And in turn, Harry didn’t want to push Draco to be honest if he didn’t want to be.
Hermione pulled her chair closer to Harry’s bedside and settled his glasses onto his face, where they were now able to rest comfortably. Picking up his hand in her own, she tilted her head to the side and studied him cautiously before answering.
“What if it was something irrelevant?” Harry questioned.
Harry watched with pure delight as Draco became acquainted with his aunt and cousin. Only the smallest bit of him felt sad that he couldn’t remember Teddy at the truly adorable age he was in Draco’s memory. The little boy, though shy for a moment, took a quick liking to Draco which was elevated when he opened his gift– a toy wand from WWW. Thinking of how Draco was with Teddy nowadays, and the way he’d been with Victoire, Harry wondered if Draco wanted children of his own one day. Harry might like that.
He landed on damp concrete, next to a towering glass building. It took him a moment to recognize Malfoy, whose face was hidden by an umbrella tilted against the drizzling rain. It looked cold and grey out, but Harry couldn’t feel the temperature. Just as he began to follow the Malfoy of the past, the present version of Malfoy landed next to him, his light dress shirt looking out of place on the stormy street.
“Okay,” Harry said.
“I’m sorry,” he murmured. He wanted to offer himself as Draco’s safe place. But he knew that wasn’t the right thing to do. Draco had lost his parents, in perhaps, an even more terrible way than Harry had lost his. If anything, they were two orphans clinging together to stay afloat.
Draco flung his arm at Harry some more, “I
“Yes. I’ve arranged for my friend Master Dermot Halloran to apprentice you for your mastery and then you were to begin your professorship here.”
It was Hermione who noticed Harry standing awkwardly at the door, like an intruder. She nudged Malfoy, who jumped to his feet.
“Fuck, fuck,
Turning to Harry with a little, secret smile, Draco said, “Don’t take this to mean I haven’t been grateful to have you in any capacity these last weeks, but I
“Yeah, I-” Malfoy shook his head, “I don’t know. It doesn’t make much sense, that’s why I never told you.”
They worked quietly together on finishing dinner. Malfoy seemed to know which tasks Harry preferred and took over the others, chopping and mixing while leaving the management of the stove to Harry entirely.
“Mr. Potter,” Longeman greeted dispassionately, passing his robe off to Kreacher without so much as a glance his direction.
up, Harry realized.
Draco drained it and set it next to the sink with a thud. “He’s here?”
“Ah, well,” Harry heaved a sigh.
“Alright then,” she said. “Be careful, though.”
Bile rose in his throat. He felt as though he’d been petrified.
Harry stood on the front steps of Number 12 Grimmauld Place feeling nauseated. In his memory, he had been back no more than twice since the battle at Hogwarts; each time only to ensure that Kreacher was getting along okay. The place had held a few too many memories for Harry’s comfort. Now, apparently, it held not nearly as many as it was supposed to. According to Hermione he’d been living there for over seven months. Seven out of the sixteen months Harry had lost and would never get properly back.
Tea could solve anything, right? At the very least, Harry needed some to soothe his nerves. He’d been about to head up to bed when the first knock had sounded, freezing him in his steps. He still had an Auror posted outside of Grimmauld Place, and with that knock Harry had known who must be at the door. Anyone else either wouldn’t have made it past the Aurors or would have just used the floo.
Harry squeezed her shoulder and replied seriously, “If I don’t leave this house, I will go mental.”
“Well Draco, I didn’t think it would be quite so tactful at the time to exclaim with pure joy. But since then you’ve found a partner – although I’m terribly sorry to hear about what’s happened to you both, I can’t imagine how anyone could be so hateful as to do such a thing to another person- and my parents have moved to France where they leave me largely alone.”
“What the fuck happened?” Harry asked, heart racing.
“Just, please Harry, ask for someone to join you next time. They can run two metres behind you for all I care.”
“I am. Are you an idiot?”
“Chronological order, I think. I’ll keep it to the basic facts for now. Alright?”
“He did,” Harry agreed. He pressed a kiss to Draco’s cheek for the pleasure of watching it turn an even deeper shade of pink and hearing the girls gasp in delight. “We’re… properly together again, I suppose.”
“If you do, then you haven’t gotten to know me well enough yet!” Draco shouted. “Or maybe it’s just that you still think I’m only in it if it’s easy? We,” he waved his hand sharply between them, “have
He stood from his chair and turned to face Draco. “I’m – God… I’m sorry. You’re absolutely right and I’d never even thought about it.”
Longeman nodded, not as though he agreed but as though he’d expected as much of a reaction from Harry. “We will, of course, keep you informed of any important updates,” he said.
Brow furrowing, Draco replied, “Well that’s hardly what I would call it. It’s just… two weeks with no progress. The case is basically a write off at this point. But I’m not allowed to be involved, and Longeman is particularly cautious about giving me any form of update so… I just thought I might do a little thinking on it myself.”
“I think so,” Harry replied smugly. He swept Draco’s hair out of his face and leaned in to kiss him firmly. “How about a stroll with Gandalf once you’ve got some breakfast in you?”
Harry hadn’t set foot in it since that afternoon he’d slept in it. The emptied nightstand and closet had garishly highlighted the division in their lives.
Shooting a scowl at Draco before turning back to Ginny, Harry promised, “I’ll be there.”
regret.
There was that chuckle again. Harry let his lips curve up a little in quiet triumph.
Turning his face away from Harry Malfoy muttered, “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.”
“Little bit. Your head must be feeling better. I heard you put up quite the racket.”
“But?” Ginny raised her brows.
“Huh,” Harry backed out of the room with a shrug. “Never seen it. You going show me the rest of this place or what?”
Draco’s eyes darkened and he swallowed nervously as he looked up at Harry. He stuttered out, “Well, then, I suppose…”
Hermione nodded, “You decided you didn’t want to. You’ve been doing your NEWTS be correspondence this year, planning to get your mastery in Defence Against the Dark Arts.”
“What’s wrong?” he asked.
Kreacher appeared in the room, and firmly guided Longeman out, a dour look on his wrinkled face.
“Well. First thing you need to know is that we’re better friends than you might remember.”
He was on his way to his favourite lunch place, the Harvest Café, which had been one of the first businesses to reopen following the war. The owners were amongst the few people who treated Harry normally. Which at the Harvest meant with an abruptness bordering on rude. He’d hardly had an appetite, but the thought of a greasy bacon sandwich made his stomach rumble in anticipation. After his (he could barely acknowledge the truth in his own mind) temper tantrum of the day before, Harry was back to wanting to pretend his life was normal and just enjoy a lunch out with his friends.
“Red,” Harry said.
He heard Draco mumble “Oh no,” and the scene became blurry, fading to black. The next second Harry was back at his kitchen table, with Draco sitting opposite him, looking green.
Unable to meet her eyes, Harry mumbled, “A lot, I think.”
Deep sobs began to claw their way up his chest and throat. He dropped to the ground and cried. Gandalf crawled into his lap once more, and Harry cradled him closely, glad for the creatures innocence and warmth. Eventually, he pulled himself off the floor and stumbled up all the flights of stairs to their bed. He crawled into the right side and inhaled a faint scent of mint.
find a way to destroy the dementors. You brought Ron and I, and a bunch of other people in to work together on the charm. A charm that used love magic to destroy them.”
Their eyes locked and Harry felt himself waver towards Draco.
” Draco hissed scathingly.
He was enrolled in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, and Potions. All the core subjects with the exception of Herbology, which he couldn’t say he regretted.
Snorting, Harry replied, “I wouldn’t worry about that.”
“I swear it, Dudley,” Malfoy grinned, he’d changed out of his Auror robes into a loose pair of trousers and an oversized knit sweater and Harry couldn’t help but notice how very good he looked. “They recommend we turn our skin camouflage because there are counter-charms to disillusioning ourselves- you know making our selves nearly invisible so long as no one’s paying too close attention- and they’re too cheap to buy enough invisibility cloaks for the force!”
Niamh sighed heavily. “No, I suppose not,” she conceded. “But if you are feeling too overwhelmed I want you both to know it is important to take a step back.”
Even though most his nightmares recounted the past, Harry was always a little worried that there might be a psychic component to them. Like whatever cosmic power rules prophecies might be drawing on whatever Harry’s brain already possesses to let him know that someone was in danger.
So Harry reached for the next memory, another green labelled vial marked
He was, too.
On the third day, just after lunch, Harry had brushed off Hermione’s suggestion that he go to lay down and had instead gone into the drawing room and grabbed a book from the top of a pile on the side table. Unfortunately, it was obviously left behind by Malfoy –
“I need you
“Can I… can I give you a hug?” Draco asked uncertainly.
Memory-Malfoy quickly began to campaign for what Harry supposed was the beginning of everything, their working together to find a way to destroy the dementors. He was enrapturing, really. He talked in a speeded, excitable manner that drew Harry in, even if there was the occasional arrogant comment that caused him to bristle. And while his past-self put up some front of reluctance, it was very obvious that he was intrigued by the prospect. Harry found himself sneaking frequent glances at the present day Malfoy, who was watching the scene with a wistful expression. A couple of times they caught one another’s gazes, both turning quickly back to the memory with reddened cheeks.
to feel ominous but most certainly did. Harry observed the hairs sticking out of his prominent nose while he cast a series of charms that glinted in the air above Harry.
After she left, Harry found a spare bedroom to sleep in.
Smiling a little to reassure him, Harry said, “Well, I was all ready to come up here and give you a piece of my mind. But…” he waved a hand towards Draco.
Hermione didn’t leave Harry’s side until Molly and Arthur arrived to spell her off. After that there was a constant flow of visitors. Everyone who was important in Harry’s life, except apparently, Malfoy. When Ron arrived, in his Auror’s stone grey robe with red sleeves, he looked rather exhausted and worse for the wear. He rushed his parents out and reassured Molly that he’d stay with Harry until visiting hours were over.
Harry kept his face neutral as he listened to Malfoy get to his feet and walk away. “Goodbye, Harry,” he said in a tone that panged oddly at Harry’s heart.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Thank you, Niamh, for everything. But can I please leave now?”
As the entered the house, Harry said, “I uh, think I’ll go lay down for a bit.”
The three of them watched Malfoy go in silence. An unpleasant squirming sensation arose in Harry’s gut.
“Oh,” Harry frowned at the table. After a moment he turned to Malfoy and asked, “You’re coming in with me?”
“I know, I know,” Malfoy ruffled his flappy ears, “I smell like Gandalf, don’t I? I really should’ve stopped at home for him and Oscar, shouldn’t I have girl? That way you all could’ve played together.”
Harry answered Fleur absently as he watched Draco coo over the baby in his arms. Reaching to run her fingers through Draco’s silky hair, she giggled. They looked as though they could be truly related, Victoire’s downy curls the same white-blond. Harry couldn’t believe that he’d missed this little girl’s entire life. He remembered that Fleur was pregnant, sure. It had only just been announced in the last of his memories. But to see her, maybe ten months old…
Draco smiled in understanding and dipped his head to press a kiss to the side of Harry’s neck. “A bit of both options,” he said gently. “Though you tended to top more, sometimes we’d mix it up.”
“Really?” Draco asked dubiously.
“So first thing, Harry, is some diagnostic spells.”
Malfoy returned the smile, “That’s good. Do you think you’d prefer watching them on your own?”
“As for the awkwardness, I might have an idea…”
He was different, smoothly practicing his purebred manners, Harry thought. Draco seemed much more himself at Grimmauld or the Burrow.
she’s connected to this Harry. I can’t explain it, but I just know.”
“I’m feeling great,” Harry reassured her as she began the charms to check his vital signs. “My appetite’s back. Haven’t really had any headaches. I am ready to pick up the pace on remembering things.”
This wasn’t the first time he’d hurt Draco over the last several weeks, especially as their bickering had begun to pick up recently. Harry felt awful enough about the rowing (though he felt equally as frustrated) but he’d also been making thoughtless misstep after thoughtless misstep. He’d notice Draco hold back his reactions, only showing the smallest signs of upset. His eyes would tighten a little, or the corner of his mouth would twitch. And he would never tell Harry
With a generous smile, Malfoy acknowledged the awkwardness. “Before, when we first became friends, I just absolutely refused to acknowledge how awkward it was. I knew I could convince you to work with me, so I determined that’s what we were going to do, no matter how much you argued.” He paused to eye Harry slyly, “mind, your arguments were on the weak side. Perfunctory, one might say.”
“Oh,” Harry mustered up the good will to say. “Well great, then. Thanks for checking in. And, you know, for taking all that time off.”
It was definitely the best room. A deep, inviting couch rested against one wall, with heavily cushioned reclining armchairs on either side of it. They faced a large television which had a surround sound speaker system. Shelves on either side of the telly were lined with films. Deep red velvet curtains were pulled across the window, but sconces lit the perimeter of the room in response to a flick of Malfoy’s wand.
Harry jumped off the bed and clapped her on the shoulder, “Brilliant, Niamh, thank you. Oh, also – can I watch telly again?”
Whenever you’re ready, Harry. Whenever you’re ready. He’d heard the sentiment so many times in the past week that if he got a sickle each time, he could take himself out for one hell of a nice dinner.
There was so much in that, Harry didn’t know what to unpack. He turned to Hermione, and was relieved when she beckoned Oscar over onto her arm. “Oscar, love, we need to take a muggle cab home, and you won’t be welcome. Would you go ahead and meet us at Grimmauld Place? I promise we will get him there safely.”
“When you’re ready,” Hermione rubbed his arm.
Draco let out a little gust of relieved breath and pulled his cloak back off the hook.
Draco knew Harry. He wanted Harry. Draco loved him.
Niamh and Healer Cunningham had made it very clear there was nothing they could do about the memory loss. But that didn’t matter to Harry. What mattered was what Hermione said. Which, like a blow to the gut, was exactly what the healers had said. She’d looked at him beseechingly when she acknowledged that yes, she had been able to bring back her parents’ memories. But that was because she had proceeded with delicacy and caution in the spell work she used to obliviate them, and had woven in a way to reverse it. With Harry, she explained, the obliviation had been like blunt trauma. It
Smirking, Draco said, “Harry, you told me everything relevant about your life.”
“So you’re looking at your old memories?” Harry raised a brow quizzically.
For a long moment, Draco stared at Harry, as if debating how he wanted to respond. Finally, he heaved a sigh and said, “It’s been two weeks since you were attacked. And we’ve no news from Longeman or his team.”
He was grateful he had that memory, at least.
Harry didn’t want to admit it, but he did have a headache. He wasn’t feeling up for all that much.
“Treacle Tarts. Or Chocolate Frogs. Yours?”
How could he know when it would be the right time, though? They’d been living together for less than a week and Harry and Draco had had so much between them that Harry didn’t even remember from before they’d even begun their romantic relationship. He hadn’t seen more than a fraction of it yet. He didn’t want to rush things and make it too confusing for either of them. While Harry found that his heart ached in response to nearly every look Draco sent his way and he certainly couldn’t deny how attracted he was to Draco, it was all just too much.
The long row of Draco’s memories was broken by a single pink one. Harry watched with interest as he confessed his friendship with Malfoy to George, who was a surprisingly great listener. He picked up the next green vial and felt his heart fly at the look of happiness on Draco’s face when past-Harry told Draco that George knew they were friends. He watched as Draco studied the Black family tapestry in Grimmauld Place, and Harry encouraged him to meet Teddy and Andromeda.
“Well,” Draco said, looking down sadly at the last half of his tea, “I’d best be off. Can’t get away with missing any more of my training seminars.”
Malfoy shook his head firmly, though his expression was apologetic. “You heard Healer Brady, Harry. Just one a day for the first three days.”
“When will the wedding be?”
They apparated side-along, keeping their hands linked as they headed into the pub.
Harry snorted. “I know. I owe her an apology.”
Trailing his fingers along Draco’s chest, Harry said, “Let’s move back into the master room.”
before we take things any further… this time round? No pressure of course.”
away.”
“Why would I ever want to keep this trash?” Harry whispered to himself, horrified.
“Your turn to ask a question,” Harry prodded.
“He’s your
A queen size bed, with a simple wooden frame and a plush white comforter sat in the middle of the room. There was a nightstand on either side of the bed, the one on the right had nothing on its surface, the one on the left had a pile of magazines and a glasses case. Harry assumed the left was his side, with a twist of his stomach. His eyes ranged over the two cream toned armchairs tucked into the bay window and he noticed a door. Heading through it, he found a walk in closet, which was entirely bare on one side. Through the other side of the closet was a bathroom, he barely glanced at it, before heading back out into the hall where his friends waited for him. Waited as if it would have been too intimate for them to be present while he rediscovered the bedroom he had shared with his partner.
He pulled them apart for but a moment to beg "Harry, please," And while he might've not known what he was begging for exactly, Harry did.
He just couldn't understand Draco Malfoy. He tried so hard to, but came up short. This proud, disagreeable man of whom he hated his whole life, of whom he thought would never be anything but his fathers lackey, is fighting against his family. Against Voldemort. Harry was, quite frankly, in awe of Draco. He had saved him, Ron, and Hermione, a plethora of times already, in these early stages of this war.
Harry was sitting in the tent, trying so hard to stay vigilant; to be aware of any sound, any movement, but it was in vain as his attention was constantly wondering to the man lying asleep next to him.
With last tender kiss, Draco hung his arms around Harry and rested his head on his shoulder. He whispered something Harry couldn't quiet hear but understood nonetheless.
Draco knew he was close when he's breath started to hitch and the pleasure tilted on the point of too much.
Draco, of course, refused to let go, instead using his hand to stroke the rest of which he couldn't get with his mouth and looked up at his lover. That seemed to do him in as the next moment he tightened his hold on Draco's hair and started fucking up into his mouth wildly till-
He gave a short nod, not knowing what Draco was asking but ready to let him do anything.
The man in question was sleeping across from him. Though one could hardly call it sleeping. Harry could see the twitches and mini tremors that shook through him and, against his better jugdment, all he wanted to do was hold him. To bring some comfort to him in any way. He deserves that, Harry thinks.
He got further down on the ground, to where he was lying on his stomach, fit snug between Harry's legs. He looked up, for reasurance and found soft eyes staring back.
"I want to, Harry, please," and fuck, when Draco gave him those eyes he's cock started to twitch once more.
Harry, who noticed the signs aswell, breathed out, "You can let go,"
He looked in Harry's eyes, hand still on his neck, gently holding it. He doesn't believe he's ever seen one man so handsome. He traces the freckles, tracks all of them with his eyes, till he's staring at his mouth.
As he sat back down from the check, and put his wand down next to him; He heard a whimper come from Draco. He tried to pay it no mind, 'It'll pass just like the rest of them,' he thought. But it didn't. It got worse till the point of him panting, trying to scream, make any noise till-
Draco shot up, breathing as though he'd ran a marathon, a crazed look in his eye. It took a second for Harry to realize Draco was talking, as he was still unerved at seeing him like this.
"You don't have to," Harry started as soon as he broke out of his haze and realized what Draco was doing.
He found a rythym soon enough and started bobbing his head up and down, only choking when Harry would lose control and buck up into him, or use his hand to guide in further. Not that he minded, really.
"Shit, I'm sorry Draco," Harry began, but without saying a word he got back up onto Harry's lap and started to kiss him. So he can taste it too.
Harry tried to say anything to comfort the other man but fell short, resulting at him just staring at shaking man with symphathy.
All the while, Harry has let this happen; not really knowing what to do. He knows he shouldn't enjoy it but he does. He enjoys the grounding feel of Draco's hand caressing his neck, brushing along his hair, which had grown long. He enjoys the glazed look in the blonde mans eyes when he's roaming over his face. Most of all, he likes that it's Draco doing all these things.
Finally, after what seemed to be forever for Draco, he took hold of Harry and gave a small, unsure stroke. The guttural sound that the man produced cleared any hesitancy he might've had.
"H-He killed you, then me. I-I couldn't do a thing, he was too fast," Draco strangled out, looking frantic at him.
Draco, however, was very interested in his partners needs and started wriggling his way down so he could start undoing the pants.
"My good boy," Harry gruffed out as he held on tighter to Draco and closed his pants up for him, not caring about his own release.
He pulls Draco close to him, to where he's practically on his lap, and deepends the kiss. He can feel Draco's hand finding their way further into his hair, and can hear every whimper and moan he makes, every little jolt and push he's body releants. His sole, undivided attention is all on the man atop of him.
