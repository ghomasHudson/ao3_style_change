His chest rises and falls at the same pace as mine before he pulls out of me and lets my feet drop to the floor letting go of me instantly and walking over to his clothes to throw them on, leaving me leaning against the wall to stop me from falling over.
''Work for you shall begin 9 every morning until around 6pm and then you shall be free to do whatever you please'' she smiles turning to me ''Treat our home as yours and please make yourself comfortable'' she says before walking up to the door ''Your uniform is on the bed dear'' she says before leaving the room and shutting the door behind her.
I walk around trying to find Mrs Malfoy before hearing voices from the dining room assuming it's her from the female voice.
He leans back over me slowly on the bed as his cock rests against my pussy ''I'll go easy on you at first, how about that?'' he says gently picking up his hand to brush a piece of hair out of my face and I nod up at him reluctantly.
''No dear, it's your day off. Relax'' she smiles before walking into the kitchen leaving Draco and I alone together at this big, empty dinner table.
''Draco dear!'' his mother shouted from downstairs causing him to quickly step away from the girl in front of him rubbing the back of his neck with heavy breath.
''Incredibly proud as always'' he said walking towards me and sitting on the bed while I scurried around the room finding everything I needed to throw into my case.
His lips places pecks across my neck and nibble and bite down on my skin only making me moan more through the intense euphoria he'd given me.
I turn to him when we get to the door with a smile as he edges towards me placing his hand on my cheek.
It's not until I almost trip up the stairs that I notice I had been staring at him for a little too long, causing him to grab me to keep me from smacking my face off the hard, wooden stairs.
''I've missed you too, both of you'' I say looking back at Elara ''Ok, I'm going now. Stop trying to keep me hostage'' he smirk at both of them grabbing my bag off the sofa and placing it over my body.
I groan impatiently as I yank her head to the side making her wince and I lower myself to her level picking up my other hand to grab her chin harshly to look at me.
''Of course'' I say before reaching up again to place another kiss on his lips then letting go of him and opening the door.
''Don't lie'' he whispers dragging his fingers up above my skirt to the hem of my panties making my hips lift up then back down quickly as he fiddles with the fabric between his fingers ''What did you Carter?''
''For being a brat'' I answer sucking a breath in as soon as I feel his finger rest back on my sensitive clit.
''And you accepted'' he snaps back then picking up his hand to push back his hair ''and anyway, I believe the proper description would be a sex worker not a prostitute-''
I arrive back to the manor and walk down the path to the doors to see Draco standing outside against the wall smoking a cigarette.
She lowers her head to place a kiss on my jawline making me tilt my head back as she traces them to my neck.
''No Juliet'' he said firmly with a short chuckle ''No'' he repeated more seriously this time looking deeply into his friends eyes.
''Yeah, I think you might have to help me to bed'' she says through shaky breath and I nod down at her.
Maybe this could be the job that could provide her with enough money to get her a better place in the future.
He walks over to me and undoes the buttons to his shirt, pulling it down his arms and throwing it to the floor to reveal his pale, toned chest. He was like a sculpted God. A statue made perfectly for a museum. He wasn't too muscly, nor to slender. He was just perfect.
''Still not found anything?'' Theo asked her as she sighed heavily placing the quill onto the newspaper which sat on her white sheets, shaking her head in defeat.
My heart must have just skipped 10 beats at least when I find that I have to suck in a harsh breath.
His hand rests naturally on my hip. I don't even flinch at the delicate touch. My eyes remain on his as he edges a little closer to rest his chest on mine and look down at me.
''Charming'' I roll my eyes before pushing him out of the doorway making him stumble back a little and walking over to his bed.
''Making girls feel like shit'' she snaps again and I sigh rolling my eyes to look away from her ''Seriously? You have done nothing but flirt and perv around me-''
''Why-'' I moan before I can even finish my sentence ''Why don't you want me around-around other boys?'' I ask through my breathless moans having to grab his leg and squeeze it tightly.
''I really want to fuck you right now'' he whispers picking up the pace of his fingers causing me to clench the table, more at his words than anything.
''Myself mainly, if you must know'' I answer naturally, not really caring how I come across to him anymore.
He chuckles as he watches me before cumming inside of me soon after and pushing his cum further into me with his cock.
''I could just lock you out'' he smiles at me teasingly and I can't help the smile that comes on my face.
''Then fuck off and do something else'' I snap at him making him suck on his bottom lip to stop himself from laughing.
''That's funny. I've been working here quite a few weeks now and I recall dusting that painting quite a few times. I believe it's been there ever since I first came here'' I smirk up at him causing him to shake his head with a frown back down at me.
''Are you like, a natural blonde then?'' She asks with a squint to her eyes and I frown at her in annoyance.
''Do you want to bite it instead?'' She whispers in a way that almost makes me lose myself and all rational thought.
And again, the belt hits my ass cheek and I feel like I can picture the rush of red that must cover my fair skin right now.
I lick my lips and wrap my arms around his neck. He lowers his lips to mine and kisses me deeply, placing his hand on the back of my head and pulling me in even more. His lips begin to move down my neck before he stops still and pulls away from me.
I walked slowly towards the living room seeing Draco sat there with his head in his hands on the sofa in front of the large fireplace which crackled with orange flames.
''No, we're just friends'' I say, humoured that she'd think me and Theo were together after so many years of us being friends.
''If you call this nice you have low expectations'' he answers tilting his head towards me ''Who's your friend?'' he asks and I bite the inside of my cheek.
''I know'' he mumbles under his breath tensing his jaw ''Still going to miss you though'' he breathed out looking up at me with glistening eyes.
''Why do you think I've brought you up to my bedroom? For a chit chat?'' He mocks me making me scowl at him in disgust.
''You're mad'' I breathe out through trembling breath, reaching out for the glass of wine in front of me with shaky hands and picking it up to down the liquid due to the dry throat I now suddenly have.
''I can go now?'' I sneer at him from where he stands and he nods back at me swirling his belt back through his trousers to buckle back up.
''Look at you'' he says lowly behind me only making me more wet at the sound of his soft, husky voice while he strokes his fingers over my ass cheek in circles ''Pathetic little slut'' he says before slapping my ass harshly and chuckling darkly afterwards when he notices me almost scream and slap my hand over my mouth.
It's like his words had such power because as soon as he said that my hand clenched harder around his hair as my hips jolted almost rocking the chair off it's legs. My teeth bit down hard on my bottom lip to keep me from screaming at the top of my lungs at the intense orgasm I had just experienced with a breathily 'fuck'' falling through my lips.
I really couldn't understand what his deal was today. It had been a week since we had sex and now he's suddenly acting all annoyed at me without reason and keeping me hostage in an old office in his house. He hadn't even spoke to me until now after that day.
She stood there and for some reason hoped he would look at her again. His stare burnt her skin, but it was nice in a way, a weird way that she cursed herself for liking.
''I don't know. What do you want me to do?'' he asks allowing for his hand to move to my thigh and trace circles there.
''I'd love round two, but I've just only woken up'' he says with squinted eyes as he scratches his head.
She unbuckled his trousers with quick pace, then pressing her hands into his boxers as he groaned into her lips, her hand now motioning his cock up and down. His lips lowered to her neck where he placed an array of eager kisses across her porcelain skin.
Juliet moved out of the way of he door to the side, bowing her head to the floor to resist looking at him for any longer than she had already.
''Sometimes'' I simply answer and he begins to tap the desk with his finger as he stares at me ''Stop tapping''
I turn to him with a tired expression and a nod, my eyes following his as he comes in front of me and places his hand on my cheek, my back placed against my door.
''Because I like it when you're all feisty. I've noticed just how fierce you are over the last few weeks'' he smirks walking with his hands in his pockets which I can't help but find incredibly attractive.
''Look. I don't like you or find your personality in any way appealing'' he smirks ''However, I really need to get you and my anger out of system and I love hate sex'' he bites his lip with a small sigh ''So?'' He asks ''Will you let me fuck you or not?''
I shake my head and look back over the books to chose another one. I will not feed into his childish, idiocy today.
''Well, we do need hosts for gatherings. So I suppose that will come in useful'' she said with her formal posture and tone ''Do you know how to do chores? Clean, make bed, cook et cetera?'' she asked.
He made me feel things earlier, things I didn't know I could feel. No-one has ever enticed me as much as him and I hate to even think that. It mentally pains me that such a horrible, callous being could be stuck on my mind right now, thinking of what could have happened if his mother hadn't interrupted.
''Fine, I won't pay you. Make you feel better?'' he asks with a rise to his brow and I bow my head to the floor ''Oh darling don't be ashamed'' he says lifting himself back up on the bed to sit up and look at me ''It won't happen again, don't worry. You don't have to feel like you're a dirty floozy, no matter how much we're both thinking it'' he says with a vile expression on his face, as if he's laughing at me from the inside.
He loved being this close to her, having her all to himself. Even if it was just in these little moments and spurts of sex they would sometimes find themselves having with each other.
''Fuck, you taste impeccable'' he smiles into my pussy as he presses two fingers into my entrance thrusting them in and out in fast pace causing me to suck in a breath and moan through the pleasure.
She slumped on the bed next to Juliet and Theo pushing the newspaper away from Juliet onto the floor and making Theo shuffle over to make room as she laid her head on Juliet's lap.
''Smoking's bad for you'' I mutter walking into the manor and taking off my shoes and jacket to see him walk in behind me still puffing at the cigarette as if it's his only other addiction than drinking.
''I told you last week when I came to see you. Everything's going fine'' I smile at the boy over the phone. He truly is very caring.
It's just me and him here now. Who's to say he's not going to murder me and hide my bones somewhere so no one can ever find me?
''That one doesn't go there'' he stated looking at her from behind as she turned around to look at him.
''Love you dick head'' I smirk back seeing how he lets out a breathily chuckle before I leave the block of flats and get into a car to get back to the manor.
''Oh, are you two together?'' she asked looking towards me and I shake my head with a light chuckle.
He then cracks his neck from side to side with his eyes closed before looking back down at me once again.
''Maybe you should be a gentleman and help me'' she says and I swirl my tongue on the inside of my cheek just looking at her and hearing that silky, smooth voice that's enough to lure you in.
''You need to keep that imagination of yours under control darling'' I snap back with a sneer as I notice her wrap her arms around her body timidly causing me to relax into a frown ''I can't be doing this with you'' I say calmly.
''You'll have the money put in my bank tomorrow?'' I say in disbelief once again looking at his smug face as I wrap my arms around my figure.
''I think it smells nice. Don't you?'' I rase my brow at him before turning back around to look in front of me.
''Oh, would you like me to write it for you?'' I ask coming closer to him fiddling with my hands at the front of my figure.
''I-I thought this was for you to-fuck-to let out your frustration'' I moan throwing my head back then grabbing onto his arm as he begins to add another finger and pump them inside of my pussy more vigorously.
His hair colour was like his fathers, icy blonde and swept to the side neatly. His skin was fair and pale and his jaw looked enough to cut through skin. He looked handsome. Incredibly handsome as he sat there in a black suit. His eyes shone far and beyond through the picture striking me straight away with how blue they were, almost like the Bahama waters. He could have seemed kind, like someone you'd be enticed into straight away just with those eyes, however, his expression said different. There was a coldness to him which radiated through the picture, a coldness which set goosebumps onto my skin as I stared at him as if he was actually here right now in front of me.
''T-Theo'' she stuttered through the force of his fingers inside of her before he slowed down his movements to a more moderate pace.
I grab the decanter and pour him some whisky then pulling the bottle away, but as soon as I do he grabs my arm before I can put it back on the table, his skin on mine shooting electricity through me.
''Mmm, I'm imagining it right now'' he says and I can see his smirk in my head that he definitely wears right now ''What else do you wear?''
''Now I do have a son who I believe is just a little older than you. You said you were 21 in your application, correct?''
He continued to kiss me, trailing back up from my collarbone, to my neck, then my jaw to my cheek. Kissing anywhere he had access to, anywhere my my lips.
''Sit with me?'' he asks and I shake my head at him with a scowl ''Oh come on, I'm sorry for yesterday'' he smirks again.
''That is what I mean. You just interrupted me as if it was nothing. You are incredibly impolite'' he says looking down at me as if he's someone higher of purpose.
''Yes mother!'' he shouted back down the stairs, his eyes still stuck on Juliet's as his chest rose and fell then shaking his head to the side to look away from her quickly feeling like an idiot for even touching her.
I feel my phone buzz in the front pocket of my dress making me stop cleaning and picking up my phone to answer it straight away, placing the polish and rag on the little table in the corner of the hallway.
''Lured you in? Oh you can actually go fuck yourself'' I almost shout at him before huffing and turning around to sit back on the desk ''So you not letting me out then?''
A tear trickles down my cheek which makes him come forward quickly and brush it away for me ''I'm sorry, fuck I didn't mean to make you cry-''
''Great. So I'll have your room ready for you in around 2 hours then?'' she asked lifting herself from her chair which I did straight after ''I'm sure you'll be able to grab your things by then? Unless you need help?''
''Are you on the pill? Birth control?'' He says clearly to me as if he's getting impatient and I just stand there with a frown as he huffs at me ''you know, to protect you against those vile creatures people call children?'' He shakes his head.
Narcissa's eyes looked like they began to tear before she looked towards me with wide eyes, picking up her hands to brush away any tears that had nearly fell and giving me a small smile ''Sorry dear was there something you needed?'' she tried her best to make herself look like she wasn't upset but you could clearly see it in her eyes.
He smirks looking down at me devilishly, my eyes head tilting to the floor as I begin to feel intimidated by him.
''Was I feisty when you fucked me? When you humiliated me afterwards?'' I suddenly say feeling a rush of resentment flow through me at the thought of that night and the way he brushed me off as if I was not worth anything more than a quick fling.
''Get back to it then, I'd hate to distract you'' he says with his book now open in front of him, not giving her the slightest glance.
He towered back over her, pulling his cock out of his boxers to line with her entrance teasing her with his tip until he slowly pressed it into her allowing him to come back forward to her lips and motion them back on hers to surpress her moan.
''Right'' I say under my breath feeling agitated at the boys attitude and beginning to walk over to the cupboard where the cleaning supplies were and grab the polish and rag out only to turn around to see him staring at me as he sips his whisky.
He closed the door behind him and locks it. I watch him from the middle of his room as he walks over to his desk in the corner and leans his back agains it with his palms rested on the dark wood.
''Forgive me Madame. I just wondered what you'd like me to do'' I say in a quiet tone through the awkward atmosphere circulating the room as I looked at Draco then back at his Mrs Malfoy.
I smile and lean forward grabbing her by the waist and pulling her to sit on top of me. Her legs now straddling each side of me as my hand rests on her back to keep her held up securely.
''Juliet, will you join us?'' she asks and I remember her asking yesterday and I practically said yes.
He walks over to me looking down at me with a sigh ''I said lie down. You've already pissed me off and disobeyed me so you can stand back up'' he looks back down at me with a mean expression. A harsh swallow coming from me as I stand back up listening to his every command of me.
''So go do whatever expensive shit you do. I have to go clean for your mom'' I say hopping off the desk and he grabs my wrist making me turn back around and raise my eye brows at him.
''It's ok, it really is'' I smile at the sweet women looking back at me ''They died when I was 15 so, it's a lot easier to deal with'' I lie with a smile.
''And my friend Elara, yes'' I quickly rush out before she can say Theodore's name in front of Draco.
''What are you doing?'' I breathe out as his hand flattens on my stomach and I turn my head slightly to look at his face.
His lips curl up into an evil smile throwing me back down to lie flat on the bed and he stands up causing me to lean up on my elbows to look at him.
I nod, then walking over to the bottle of wine on the tray and walking over to the drinks table and pushing it over to them at the end of the dining table where they all sat carrying on with their conversation.
He was mysterious and never seemed to talk to anyone. He just sat there and minded his own business. He would barely speak to his mother other than to shout at her, which I found not the best to hear.
I lift my arm to push him off me but instead I end up grabbing his shoulder and pulling him into me even more, causing a groan to escape his lips as he nibbles on my skin.
''It's only 7, I'm sure you'll get there'' she smirks looking at me deeply before sighing and standing up straight ''Come in'' she suddenly says making my eyes widen at her ''Wellllll, are you coming in or not?'' she smiles kindly.
''I hate you'' Draco hissed at her ''you know that? I'll never stop despising you, you pathetic excuse of a mother''
I walk over to his desk and sit down ''Of course. Only because you're being less of a dick today'' I smirk picking up the quill on his desk as he towers over the back of the chair looking down at me as I grab the parchment in front of me and I await for him to tell me what to write.
''My friend's'' I answer, finding some calmness in the way he begins to brush his fingers now through the back of my hair making me tilt back more subconsciously.
''Like the book, yes?'' he asked biting the inside of his cheek as his eyes looked back over every inch of her body.
I pick up the whisky and walk to where Draco is sitting ''Whisky?'' I ask him quietly making sure not to interrupt the conversation between his mother and the person who seems to be his girlfriend.
Draco seems to raise his head up to look at me for a second before looking back to his whisky glass on the table.
''You just going to lean in front of me all night?'' I ask her watching how she looks down at her hands on my thighs then back at me.
''Then why are you here?'' he asks, not bothering to move his forehead from mine as he pushes a piece of hair behind my ear ''Being nice to me''
''I-I appreciate your-'' he pauses again as I write what he says ''Gift'' he says as if he's unsure of what he's even talking about.
Then suddenly he whips his black, leather belt across my ass causing my knees to buckle and for me to scream in pain to the point he has to grab me and pick me back up to take my previous position against the wall.
''So beautiful'' he breathed out before lifting her up onto the kitchen counter and pulling her skirt back up again to grab her panties and pull them down, letting them drop to the floor.
''Now, you're going to be a good little girl for me and never do that again, yes?'' he says suddenly stopping his hand still in my panties making me turn my head to him as he looks at me with tensed jaw and a stern, threatening face.
''Stand up'' he asserts me and I stand in front of him slowly making him grab my wrist and pull me closer to him.
''Fuck Malfoy'' I moan and he smirks down at me, clenching his hand now around my leg above his shoulder.
''Fine, I'll be back in a minute with your milk'' I say before stepping away from the door to walk away until I notice it swing open from behind me making me turn back around on my feet to look at him in the doorway.
I then saw Narcissa walk out of the living room and flee for the front door, grabbing her coat and slamming it shut.
My other hand picks up to grip my hair then slam back down in front of me, not knowing how to hold myself together in front of him as he pleasures me in this silent, dim-lit library.
''If you could just clean up in here that would be great, the cleaning supplies are in that cupboard'' she sniffled before walking out the room quickly and making her way up the stairs in quick movements.
''Is this a hobby of yours?'' she snaps at me making me turn back towards her with a confused expression.
One which seemed to be the father, who had long, platinum hair which flowed to his shoulders. One seemed to be the mother, who was a beautiful women with dark hair and blonde resting underneath. Then lastly, there was a boy who sat in the middle on a leather, emerald green chair with his mother and father's hands placed on each shoulder, one who looked around my age, assuming this was Draco the boy Theo informed me about.
''I'm not going to murder you'' he assures me rather seriously as if he'd read my mind before a humoured smile finds his lips ''not yet anyway''
''I'm obviously not going to sit on your lap Malfoy'' I snap back at him closing my eyes for a moment as my only form of peace right now.
''Alright, Merlin'' I sigh and hear him chuckle soon after as I hop back off the dress to notice it's now stuck on a splintered piece of wood on the old desk and I yank the material off it, causing a tear at the bottom of my dress ''Shit''
I huff and walk over to the chair at the back of the room and sit in it watching how he places the two books he had just rudely taken before me back onto their places on the shelf.
I stood there debating on her words whether or not I should just walk out of here and forget the whole thing. He can be mean at times. That certainly wasn't in the job description, to have to deal with someone who may be mean to me.
''I am actually'' I lie through my teeth looking back at him with a raised brow and he sucks on the one side of his cheek trying not to laugh at me no doubt.
''What do you mean?'' She breathes out as I lift her shirt over her head and throw it on the floor beside her.
''See you later princess'' he smiled only making her smile more then turning back to Narcissa to give her a small smile before turning his feet to walk back up the trail to the front gates.
I was starting to wonder whether the happy, smiley expression she held was really true at this point. It seemed far too forced.
''You didn't know me?'' he turns his body more to face me with a confused look on his face ''Me. You didn't know me, Draco Malfoy?-''
''I'm only down the road'' I whisper down at him watching how he places his hands on either side of my hip with a deep sigh.
''Fuck off Malfoy'' I say before reaching the top steps and reaching my door the same time he does his.
I frown at him ''What are you doing?'' I whisper with a humoured smile finding my lips at him kneeling on the floor in his black formal shirt and trousers.
''So how?'' I ask then sighing and softening my features ''Did you want to talk about it?'' I ask trying to be a little more calm.
Draco sat there drinking whisky as if he was dying to get away from the table with the only thought in my head thinking, why doesn't he?
''Come here'' he says getting a needle and cotton out of the draw and placing the needle in his hand as he unravels some of the thread nodding towards me to the position in front of him.
''I miss you too. To be honest, it's just really quiet here. Mrs Malfoy said to treat it like a home but I can't help but feel a bit awkward''
''Why hello there Theodore'' I say playfully over the phone to him allowing a small chuckle to come through the phone.
''I would if you don't won't those pearly whites to turn yellow and those perfect nails to become stained'' I mumble and he chuckles again at me as I begin to walk away ''And of course, hair loss and thinning of the follicles'' I say before turning back around to see he's took the cigarette straight out of his mouth.
''Actually, no. But I have been a waitress'' I smiled hoping she would accept that as a reasonable type of experience.
She walked back into the kitchen to Theo who was now putting the kettle on and stretching his arms wide into the air.
Both breathless with a small laugh coming from both of them, he hugged her closely with her head falling into his shoulder while he stroked down her back with his fingertips.
''No. I've come to the conclusion that you just must be a terrible kisser'' she smiles biting the inside of her cheek at me only making me chuckle at her.
He brushes his hands through his hair not noticing I'm currently looking at him trying my best not to laugh.
My breathing is still staggered all over the place and I can feel the humour on his face at me right now.
''Really?'' I ask him with crossed arms and he nods with a smirk ''You're hilarious Malfoy, you should be a comedian'' I say with a straight face before turning around and grabbing the polish to begin polishing around his room quickly.
''Ok. I won't touch you again'' he smiles putting his pinky out in front of me ''Promise'' he smirks and I sneer at him with a tut and turn my head away ''Come on, pinky promise and I'll never touch you again''
He tuts at his mother then looking back at me again with a stern expression ''Drink, now'' he demands of me, his mother shaking her head to the table and his father sitting there not saying another word ''Carter-''
''You should try harder then'' I say unbothered, flatting out the bed to make it perfect for him, the same as everything else in his room is.
He smacks his glass back down on the table making me flinch as he smirks back at me with a dark chuckle coming from his mouth.
''Awah, that's kind of him. When did he get you that?'' I ask with a kind smile, knowing full well he's talking utter rubbish.
''I just need to let you know that before you begin. He's a nice boy really, just some trauma he hasn't quite gotten through. So if he's ever mean to you, simply ignore him. I can assure you he will never mean it. He's harmless really'' she said, her lips curling back up into somewhat of a sad smile more than anything, her eyes looking lost of hope.
I then pull her head down further onto my cock until she's taken all of me in and keep her head lowered on me before pulling her head completely off me and pulling her to latch her mouth back down on my cock again.
''Just get out'' he snaps, his eyes flashing to look at mine full of anger and vexation, turning back to that stone cold, grey shade.
''What are their names?'' I ask, trying my best to spark up a conversation with him to take his mind off his own moodiness he battles with in his head.
''Your hand is so cold'' I whisper, trying to mix the warmth of mine with his as I rub his hand with soft strokes with my thumb, finally noticing his hand had now fully relaxed in mine.
''Where have you been?'' he asks, puffing out the smoke into my direction which I roll my eyes at and grab the door handle.
''Come sit down'' he says gently which was quite different to the attitude he had downstairs with his mother only minutes ago.
''Theodore Nott'' she said in disbelief ''Haven't seen you in 4 years'' a smile came up on her face, her eyes seemed to be suddenly full of hope.
I drop his hand out of mine and stand up out of the chair ''I think you're fine to write your little letter now'' I smile before walking to the door.
''No'' I shake my head with a smile and a sniffle ''Don't be silly'' I let out an awkward chuckle ''How's your hand feeling?''
I walk back over to her slowly looking over her figure ''What do you want me to do then?'' I ask her before standing in front of her and untucking her shirt from her skirt for her.
''I can't I have cramp in the right hand too'' he huffs down at me as if he's actually making sense right now.
''Were you named after Romeo and Juliet?'' He asks with a squint to his eyes as if he's truly interested.
''Kiss me then darling'' I whisper and just when she goes to lean forward into my lips I turn my head with a chuckle.
She felt her orgasm arising. Electricity flowing through her veins as his cock continuously hit her G-spot while flicking her clit in quick pace. Her legs began to shake before her head threw back, slapping her hand over her mouth as she moaned through her high cumming all over his cock as he still chased his.
''And what do you mean I lack modesty?'' I snap at him only causing him to deeply sigh at me with a sniff.
''You'd look like a right princess in a manor'' he said with a smile as he watched her reading the advertisement still.
''Were you never taught etiquette?'' He frowns and I feel my temperature rising at him ''You lack modesty. You don't care to avoid impropriety, do you?'' He asks looking deeply at me.
I arrived to the Malfoy Manor the next day right on time, being sure not to disappoint, at least not straight away. The gatekeeper let me in and told me to walk straight through and await them in the dining room which made me feel a little scared if I'm being honest. Walking into a strangers home without them actually letting you in themselves did feel strange.
He leans up quickly and slaps me over the cheek then yanking my chin to look at him, the stinging on my skin beginning to burn from the harshness of his hand.
''Yes'' I hear him call from outside the room and I stall, dropping my hand from the handle immediately.
''Depends. Are you going to be a good little girl for me?'' He asks digging his fingers into my hips.
''Your father won't be joining today. He has a heavy work load'' she puts simply as Draco rolls his eyes to his plate picking up his fork and pushing his food around.
''You don't go around with other boys anymore. Understood?'' he asserts me and I just look at him as he sighs at me.
He folds the belt in his hands looking down at me, his one hand then resting on my back to arch it more, pressing it down further.
''It was nice seeing you again Mrs Malfoy'' he smiled then turned to Juliet with a smile and pinching her cheek making her scrunch her nose up ''I expect to see you next week'' he smirked at her only making her roll her eyes.
I revert my eyes from him and place the decanter back on the drinks tray pushing it back where it came from the standing back at the side of the room again waiting for this day to be over so I can just go to bed.
He added another finger soon after beginning to thrust her with more force in fast motions while his thumb played with her clit. Her hand grabbed his shoulder digging her finger nails into him through his t -shirt as he fucked her with his fingers so roughly.
He comes forward and places a kiss on my cheek then leaning back up and dropping his hand from my face.
''No, not really. My friend may have mentioned your name a couple of times but, other than that, no'' I say and he scrunches his nose up at me.
I didn't know why I felt the need to come in here and check on him, but something made me compelled to do so.
''Pretty pretty girl'' he whispers with a smirk and I moan when he slides a finger inside of me, hitting my G-spot instantly beginning to thrust it in and out in moderate pace.
I go to reach for one of the books but he reaches his hand before me and grabs it opening it in front of him and pretending to read it which I grit my teeth at.
''Good'' he whispers more to himself looking to the side of the room and moving his tongue on the inside of his cheek which causes my stomach to do flips just watching him.
She sighed as she felt his eyes burn onto her back, having to place her foot on the bottom shelf to lift herself a little higher as the boy behind her simply enjoyed the view with a snicker escaping his lips.
''After you'' he says and I hesitate looking back behind me at the stairs wondering whether I should run for the hills.
''Fine by me, I could do with a break'' I smile only making him look at me even more pissed off that before.
''Well-'' I murmur nibbling on the bottom of my lip ''My shoulders are aching'' I say before looking up at him as he nods towards his lap ''Are you actually going to-''
''You're not going to stop teasing me about that are you?'' he asks quietly with his one hand rested on the counter beside him.
I cum inside of her with light moans falling off my lips unable to control the intensity of it as I pull her further into my chest.
He licks his lips looking down at mine before flickering his eyes back on mine ''I'm sure you'll find a way''
She licks her lips looking down at mine then back to my eyes again before she thinks I could have noticed.
''We've missed our girl'' Theo corrects her with a smile coming up to me and hugging me soon after ''I've really missed you'' he whispers then pulling away from me.
''Awah look, she's scared'' he mocks me walking around the table slowly in calculated steps before he stands in front of me, towering over me in an assertive manner.
''I'll leave you to your shower then'' I say with a slight curl to my lips and she chuckles at me with a nod like she's unable to even speak right now.
I'd finished cleaning the rest of upstairs with the exception of Draco's room which I make my way to now.
''Where is it?'' Theo asked quickly peering down at the paper with her ''Because if you're thinking of moving out for a job I don't want you to be far away from us-''
''Just one more'' he whispers stroking a hair behind my ear and I nod at him with a small sniffle which he smiles proudly at, as if the sight of me crying in front of him right now was something he was extremely proud of.
We give our thank's to the chefs. Well, Narcissa and I do while Draco just leans back in his seat letting out a yawn then looking across the table where his father would usually sit with a squint to his eye.
''Can you at least answer me that? Since you've been so horrible to me since I started working here'' I ask calmly and he sighs deeply at me ''It's not a big deal obviously, I just would like to know''
''I can make do with 5'' he smirked pulling her into him as he slammed his lips onto hers letting his hands glide up and down her side.
She lets out a loud moan into my shoulder like music to my ears as she tries to surpress it by biting down on my skin, cumming all over my cock which was enough for me to finish.
He pulled out with a smirk before pressing back into her with force almost knocking the wind out of her with a loud moan, causing them both to chuckle into each others lips.
I stood there unable to hold myself together. I felt like I was falling apart, crumbling under his hold on me right now.
''Thank you so much'' she says with a sniffle ''Have the day off tomorrow and maybe you can join us for dinner?'' she asks with a kind smile.
The letter said she could come for an interview tomorrow at 1pm which she was actually very excited for.
His back was still turned as he leant back over the table with both hands placed flat on the wood with a huff.
''Bit late for that one'' he said in a sarcastic manner smirking back at her as he stood up straight and let out a deep sigh and a sadistic smile finding his face ''If you both would have just died in that war'' he chuckled lowly running his thumb against his bottom lip and tensing his jaw through his anger.
''Mmm'' he hums back tiredly before lifting himself from the floor and placing the needle back in his draw ''Done''
I pull my other hand up to gently massage his hand in mine, looking at his slender fingers and the veins which protrude through his skin. His hands are larger than mine. Mine look tiny compared.
He pulls himself out a little before thrusting back into me in one harsh slam causing me to scream and lift my head up to bite onto his shoulder.
''Good pay too'' she said glaring her eyes over the words ''Really good pay and, it says here it's a live-in job''
He leans forward and brushes his nose against mine again and just when our lips are about to meet he quickly pulls away from me, taking around two steps back and running his fingers though his hair leaving me against the counter feeling weak still from his touch.
My heart feels like it's going to beat out of my chest at the rapid rate it's now going. He isn't even touching my skin, yet I feel the iciness of his hands hovering over my leg as he works on my dress.
''I don't recall you having a say'' his father hisses back at him ''You will do as you're told. Stopping being so ungrateful''
''So, is that a yes?'' He asks again ''I'm not that much of a pig to make you do something you don't want to do. So I'll only ask one more time. Do you want me to fuck you, or not? And I can also assure you, it will never happen ever again''
''Wouldn't you like to know'' she raises her brow at me and I shake my head at her with a roll of my eyes.
''Ok, maybe a bad idea to leave you in the shower on your own'' I say with a sorry face and she places her hand onto my shoulder to keep herself up.
Juliet was out of her depth after leaving Hogwarts. She had left too soon, in year 5 to be exact. Therefore she never completed her studies. However, there was reason to this.
I slide slowly down the shower tile to the floor with the water still trickling onto my head as I pull my knees to my chest and hug them tightly with sobs coming from my mouth which I don't feel I can control.
''Well, we didn't see that one coming did we'' I say before turning around and walking to the stairs to which he quickly walks beside me.
''Is he your friend?'' he asks and my head tilts to him at the same his does to mine, finding his blue, crystal like eyes glistening at me.
''You know, you really are the vilest person I've ever met'' I hiss at him and he just looks to the corner of the bathroom away from me again ''You can't just do that and then act as if I'm fucking diseased or something-''
The sun shines bright through the windows today as I dust the halls upstairs, adding a bit of light to the place.
I face back forward and pull my one hand up to rest on the back of his head clenching his hair in my hand while he sucks on my clit in fast pace and his 2 fingers curl up inside me, pumping me rapidly.
I go to unclasp my hands from her waist but her knees almost buckle to the floor making me have to catch her in my arms.
''No no I can do that. Thank you so much'' I rushed out at her as she walked around the table to stand in front of me.
I walk over to the mirror and pin my hair up letting two pieces frame the sides of my face and brush my outfit off to make sure I look presentable enough. I slip on some black flats and make my way down the numerous amounts of stairs wondering how the hell I'm going to walk around this place on the daily.
I never really noticed Draco in school though, for some reason I never recalled him even being there at the same time, year and house as me. I was far too in my own little world with Theo and Elara and going to classes and back to the dorm. Keeping to myself mostly.
''Turn around then'' he smirks with the needle still placed between his teeth as he pulls out some scissors and cuts off some cotton.
It'd been a couple of weeks I'd worked here now and the time passed by. I was getting more used to the job day by day. Narcissa was extremely nice to me, as for Lucius, he wasn't really ever around much and I don't believe we had even talked.
He walked up the stairs gesturing me to follow him and I did, every step I took behind him watching the back of his figure.
''It's like you have a million mood swings a day'' I say and I feel him touch my thigh again making me look at him.
He was never around during the day, it was as if as soon as the sun rose in the sky he had to get out of the manor. I suppose Draco would act the same if his father was here all the time. He'd probably leave the manor and never return by the looks of how they act around the dinner table.
''No'' I say clearly back to him finding my confidence at the boy who's nice persona had suddenly now changed once again.
I frown in confusion ''Erm, six?'' I say as if I'm asking if it's the correct answer to a question I don't recall being asked.
''Who's to say you have to be happy to smile?'' I ask and he frowns at me ''I smile and I'm not really all that happy, not entirely''
''I need to take out my frustration'' he says looking down at me with a serious expression ''Do you understand that?'' He tilts his head to the side as if he's genuinely asking me if u do.
The thought of joining them for dinner wasn't the most exciting thing ever, however at this moment in time, I believe the only thing that is best to do is smile and say yes to the broken woman in front of me.
''Lovely'' she smiled again ''I must inform you before you work here that he can get quite, shall we say, frustrated at times. Mostly with the world'' she rolled her eyes to the floor then looked back up at me,
''Shhh'' he hushes me placing his finger on my lips which he then lets drop slowly to my collar bone making my breath hitch, his head leaning froward to whisper harshly in my ear through so much hatred ''You talk to me again without being spoken to first, I will place a knife against your throat and let the blood pour to the floor along with your lifeless body''.
''Draco listen to your father'' Narcissa says pleadingly beside him and he shakes his head with a breathily laugh and a smirk.
His fingers stroked up her pussy, gathering all her wetness to begin circling her clit in gentle strokes causing her to moan with delight and a smile curling up onto her face.
''You want me to talk?'' he asks in a hushed tone, his fingers still tracing along my skin gently making me throb.
He pulls me forward slowly so I'm sitting on top of him, both of my legs straddling his as he wraps his arms around me burying his head in my shoulder and placing a kiss on my shoulder.
''Malfoy'' I breathe out before letting out a small moan when he begins to kiss down my neck and closing my eyes.
She lifts her hand to push a strand of my hair off my forehead then places it back onto my shoulder. I can't begin to speak of much her one finger on my head just now gave me tingles throughout my whole body.
''Apologies, Carter'' he smirks before dipping his head back down and flicking his tongue on my clit making me moan at the feeling.
''I'll give you four because I have to clean downstairs still'' I say crossing my legs and looking up at him with a smile which he soon returns.
Narcissa sits at the end of the table as the chefs bring out the dinner today since I'm not working.
''5 minutes'' she smirked making his lips curl up as he walked towards her, taking in her whole figure bit by bit ''and then I have to apply for this job'' she made clear as he towered over her placing his hands on her waist licking his lips down at her.
''I shall see you in a little while'' she said looking towards the entrance ''Williams'' she called out to the gatekeeper who was stood near the door and poked his head around the corner ''Please show Miss Carter here back out onto the grounds until she returns later today'' she said politely to the man who gave her a nod as a response and guided me towards the door.
So now, she had to fend for herself which only made things more difficult. She no longer lived in the house she grew up in. She now lived with her friends Theo and Elara in a tiny flat in Wiltshire since it was all they could afford.
''Alright, I suppose I can keep you company for a little while'' I smirk walking into her room and walking over to her bed to sit on it.
''No'' he snaps picking his head up and stopping all movement ''No you're not'' he asserts me as if he had control over every feeling in my body.
''I think you like my mood swings'' he smirks dragging his hand back up my thigh but I place mine on top of his to stop him going any further ''Don't you want to go again?-''
''Juliet, is it?'' I heard come from beside me and I stood up immediately to face the women who stood in the entrance way to the dinner hall. My hands placed formally in front of me.
I open the library door not bothering to keep it open for him with him having to put his hand out to stop it from hitting him in the face.
''You falter a lot. It's like you lose every bit of strength, even if I'm in the same room as you, you lose your cool'' he says looking deeply at every feature on my face, then brushing my hair behind my head and placing his hands on my shoulders to brush down my arms,
She begins to undo the buttons of my shirt one by one until my chest is revealed to her, her fingers stroking down my skin like bolts of lightening marking me.
''Can you just sit down?'' he snaps, my eyes widening at him at the audacity of him being annoyed at me for not sitting down when he literally tricked me out of my seat.
''I only joke you know'' he whispers through a smirk, beginning to rub my shoulders with his large hands causing me to let out a relieved breath ''Feel good?''
''We most definitely do'' Astoria said joyfully, carrying on talking about whatever boring shit it was, I didn't care to listen very much to her.
''Can I do something for you?'' I ask kindly with a small smile trying not to annoy him or anger him anymore than he seems to be.
''It arrived yesterday. He's a very kind man who's been a friend of the family for years. He paints them himself'' he says rather confidently gripping the back of the chair.
Juliet stood back up with a sneer on her face which she couldn't help as she began to arrange the books once again onto the bookshelf, being sure to stay at the end that he was not at.
''Fuck off'' he snaps at me looking to the side of the room which I chuckle into my lap at, fiddling with my hands and tapping my feet still ''Stop fucking tapping'' he hisses and I stop straight away trying to contain my laughter at him.
''That doesn't matter. I'm used to people treating me like shit when I was a waitress with all those drunks looming around me-''
He stalls for a moment holding the door as he stands inside the manor as I turn around to look at him from the doorstep.
''Swallow'' I assert her and swallows with a light hum closing her eyes and snapping them back open again to look back up at me.
My chest tightens at his words, not knowing what to do with myself. I'd had this before, from drunken men in a restaurant when I was a waitress, but this was different. Draco was ten times more assertive and seemed to be even more aggressive.
''I don't recall you having a degree in clinical psychology, because that's certainly not what you're here for'' he says not tilting his head to look back at me ''I believe your shift is finished''
Draco, Narcissa and Astoria all sat around the dinner table as I stood at the side of the room with my hands placed in front of me, awaiting to be called upon if needed.
I sit on the floor in front of the chair he's sitting resting my arms around my knees and placing my head back on the lower back of the chair.
And again and my knees buckle beneath me through my scream, my body almost falling to the floor to the point where he has to grab me by the waist with his one arm in a strong hold to keep me up and pull me against his chest.
''I wouldn't mind it'' she whispers almost into my lips and my eyes flutter closed as my hands lower down to her ass to squeeze it tightly causing her to let out a small moan.
''You should go inside now'' he quickly says and I stand up and look over to the car to see Astoria get out of it.
I shut myself up, not wanting to aggravate him anymore than I already have with the few words I had already said.
My eyes shut for a moment before flying back open to tilt my head behind me to check no one was coming back into the room.
''Like I said I'm bored and I really don't want to be left alone with my thoughts today. So can you just walk the grounds with me?'' he asks and when I don't answer him he huffs soon after ''Fine'' he mutters walking towards the door and opening it to walk out into the hallway.
Bigger than I've ever had and I think he has noticed the way my eyes widen in worry, wondering if he's going to literally tear me a part.
''No you don't'' I say playfully to him before leaving his room and shutting the door behind me with a smile curling up on my lips.
''Do you with other girls?'' I hear myself ask him without even realising making him flick his eyes back on mine with an awkward sniffle.
''Go lean against the wall. Can you do that? Or are you incapable?'' he asks and I shake my head ''Words Juliet, fuck sake-''
''In you'' he whispers stroking his hands down my arms from behind ''I'm so very interested in you'' he mumbles under his breath and I tilt my head up a touch unsure of what to do at that confession.
''Is this because I didn't give you a drink?'' I ask and I still receive no reply ''I think baby's may be more partial to milk, so I can grab a glass now for you if you'd like?'' I smile to myself at my terrible humour.
He lifts his head up and pulls his fingers out of me lifting his hand up to his mouth and sucking my cum off his fingers with a humming sound at the taste, closing his eyes and tilting his head back as I watch him breathlessly.
''Of course'' I whisper before he pulls his head out of my shoulder to look at me and place his hands on each side of my arms brushing them down comfortingly.
''Turn around'' he chuckles and I do, causing him to place his hands on my waist and opening his legs more to make space for him to pull me down to sit between his legs and move his hands up to my shoulders.
He lets go of me quickly when the library door opens making me walk to the other side of the room as if I had been looking at the books on the shelf the whole time; to which we both knew was utter bullshit.
''What about your parents Juliet?'' she asks making me tilt my head up and hold my fork still at her question and I notice Draco does the same, with the exception of keeping his head held down ''What do they do for work?'' she smiles.
His nose brushes mine before he lowers his lips to my cheek and places a kiss there causing shivers through my body as his hand grips tighter on my hip pulling me right into his groin.
He grabs his cock and lines it with my entrance, teasing me with his tip before pressing it slowly in and pulling back out again, a small moan escaping my lips at just that.
''Car accident'' I say dabbing at his hand gently ''Not anything extraordinary. A car crashed into them and they died'' I simply say then placing the towel back onto the bathroom counter.
His head dips back to look at me again with a roll to his eyes before stepping back from me and walking out of the room.
''It is'' he smirks pulling his hands out of my panties and grabbing me by the wrist and throwing me onto the bed so my back hits the silk sheets.
''I-'' she pauses with a sigh ''Forgive me for overstepping, but I was just wondering. You and Draco are same in age and, well, maybe if you're comfortable, you could go see if he's ok?'' she asks pleading me with her eyes.
I hear him chuckle from his door and look over to see him looking at the floor with a smile and his hands behind him as he leans against the door to probably keep himself from falling asleep standing up.
''Shower's warm'' she smiles before stepping back and walking towards the shower, dropping her towel just before she walks in.
I look at him and pick my hand up to shove his out of my face making him chuckle at me and sit up straight in his seat.
He places his finger to his lip with a hushed chuckle and I chuckle back at this sudden burst of silliness he has before he gets under the table and in front of my legs, yanking them apart causing me to suck in a breath.
My face falters, feeling disgusted in myself for even considering to take money off him in the first place.
I wrap my arms around her letting her back rest against my chest as I leave kisses against her neck and shoulder before spinning her around to face me quickly which she gasps at when I pin her up against the cold tiles.
She looked up at him with glistening eyes as he did on hers before smiling and leaning up to grab a book off the shelf, his eyes leaving hers as he pulls the book out and walks away from her to sit in the chair beside the small fireplace leaving her standing there stunned.
''Yes?'' She asks with a frown and I look to the side then back at her placing a confident look onto my face to distract myself from how my body are tensed right now.
''You and Theodore are friends? Small world we live in'' she said flicking out her wand and casting a spell to allow my bags to float up in the air and through the open window upstairs ''That shall be your room, would you care to come see?'' she smiled moving out the way of the door to let me through.
''Tired? It's like 11am'' I say looking back at the sheets as I push the silk duvet cover over the tog.
I like to be alone, but ever since she's worked here, I enjoy being around her presence. Her presence feels kind, warm and inviting. Even though most of the time she's hitting me back with comments that only make me laugh. She really is quite funny.
There was one picture hung upon the wall that caught my eye, that one picture of what looked like the family all together. Not a happy one, nor a sad one. More of an expressionless one in which there were 3 people.
''Well done, you remembered'' I say up at him finding it a little annoying how he'd even ask something like that.
''Higher'' he said keeping his eyes on her when she turned back around to face the bookshelf and get on her tip toes to higher herself to the next shelf ''Mmm, not that one. Next one''.
''It's just, he doesn't talk to me. He doesn't like me being near him anymore. He never speaks anything but cruelness'' she says with a tear flowing down her cheek making me sympathise for her even more ''I really am sorry for burdening you and telling you all this, but I'm desperate. It's hard being a mother'' she cries and I nod back at her.
Possibly that he said something at the dinner table without screaming and shouting or scowling at everyone in his sights. She smiles, obviously thinking he was being kind by his previous sentence.
His teeth graze against my ear ''Go lie on the bed'' he whispers before pushing me forward causing me to stumble a touch.
''I must be off, just came to drop Juliet off safely'' he said placing his hand on my lower back and smiling towards Narcissa.
''Goodnight dick head'' she says and I let out a soft chuckle before standing up straight and walking towards the door, giving her one more quick glance before leaving.
My hand comes down to grab the back of his hair but he slaps it away and presses my wrist into the bed in a harsh hold, his veins prominent in his hands and knuckles a pale, flushed red as he clenches his hand around my wrist.
''Be a strong girl now'' he whispers gripping me with his other hand by my hip and spanking me with his belt again, tingles shooting through me from the pleasurable pain as I squeal with my mouth closed biting down hard on my lip.
''Apologise then'' he hits back making my eyes grow wide at the thought of apologising to this idiot towering over me as I pierce my lips shut without a word ''Apologise for being a brat Carter'' he says trailing his hand back down my stomach to my pussy and hovering over his hand over my clit with a devilish smirk.
''And you caught me, so I'm ok'' she says slowly with a frown ''So, thank you'' she gives me a forced smile before going to shut the door but I place my foot in the way of it so she can't.
''I've been a dick, so maybe let me try to do one nice thing'' he says and I look away from him for a moment.
''On a king sized bed?'' I ask with a raised brow and she nods with a hum ''Sit in your seat then Carter'' I say nodding down my my lap.
I breath out and nod up at him. He then released my hand and placed them back on the desk looking down at me.
I chuckle before placing my hand out in front of him with a shrug ''It's my job to help with anything you need''
''Please sit down lovely, there is really no need to stand before me'' the woman said and I simply nodded with a smile before seating myself back down in her chair. A lump arose in my throat, not knowing what to say at all in front of this woman.
''Ok I'll walk with you'' I say and he just carries on walking not answering me back as I follow him to the door which he opens to let me out first.
''Goodnight'' he says before going back to his bedroom door and walking in there, closing the door gently behind him.
''Why am I here?'' I ask trying to change the subject for I know everything he says is completely true.
Her eyes drain with tears down her smooth, fair skin. Her mascara smudged and running down her cheeks
I frown at him then turn around to look at the book there with a shake to my head before looking back at him.
''The bed Juliet'' he hisses harshly at me making me nod and walk over to the bed and sit down on it hesitantly.
''What's wrong princess?'' I whisper biting my lip at her as she lets out an annoyed cry clenching her hand into a fist in the back of my hair ''Do you want me to kiss you?'' I smirk conceitedly at her as nods eagerly pulling my head more into her so our noses are touching.
''Quite a brat aren't you?'' He asks and I can't help but scowl up at him as he chuckles down at me ''Do you have a Romeo, Juliet?'' He says mocking down at me and I shake my head at him.
Theo lifted himself up and sat in front of her instead grabbing both her hands in his ''Please tell me you're taking the piss'' he smirked at her and a curl came onto her lips.
Juliet wasn't working at the moment and was trying to seek a job. She'd search through papers, knock on windows to shops but nothing seemed available. She'd lost her last job being a waitress at a Restaurant in Diagon Alley due to it getting shut down for not having much business.
''Admiring me?'' He asks then tilting his head to the side to look at me as I sit there unable to say anything  ''It's ok, I get it. I have that affect on people'' he smirks looking deeply at me.
He looks up at me with a devilish smirk ''It looks pretty on you'' he says making my breathing falter a little ''You should keep it there'' he whispers looking across every feature on my face.
''These fucking curves'' he shook his head closing his eyes before snapping them over again onto my figure, his hand then tracing to my panties and stroking over the front of my clothed clit ''Like a fucking goddess'' he mumbles under his breath making my heart flutter.
His head then pulling out of her shoulder to look down at her with a smile, placing his hand on her cheek so kindly and pulling forward to place a kiss on her soft, plump lips which he craved so much.
''No don't apologise'' he shakes his head as if he's annoyed at himself ''Touching is a little strange, that's all''
''In the end I didn't accept'' I interrupt with a murmur looking to the floor with that rush of guilt coming through me ''Is that why-'' I tilt my head back up to look at him ''Is that why you didn't kiss me? You thought I was filthy?'' I ask with a sad expression and his face falters into a more confused one at my question.
''So fucking pretty'' he mumbles into my skin as he continues to leave an array of kisses and bites along my collar bone.
She sucks on her bottom lip and I notice her swallow and look to the side looking like she feels a little embarrassed.
I walk into the dining room suddenly stopping still in my tracks as I see the same boy from that photograph leaning over the table. I can only see the back of his head, but his stance is more than powerful as he talks to his mother in a rather aggressive manner.
We ate dinner, then afterwards sat at the table for a little longer. She offered me wine and I accepted gracefully. We talked, and it was nice. She was very warm and inviting which was surprising considering the husband she has.
''It's actually quite warm'' I cut him off annoyed at him for not just answering me as he sucks on the inside of his cheek,
He grabs my chin harshly pulling my head up to look at him as he looks into my eyes with a scowl. I swallow harshly at his hold on me, wishing him just to leave me be. His eyes glare down my body then back up to my face in one swift movement then tilting his head to look me deep in the eyes with a squint to his.
''Fine'' she huffed picking back up the newspaper and flicking through the pages again to find her eyes had grown wide at one of the advertisements ''Maid?'' she tilted her head back up to Theo as if she was asking if he thought it was suitable enough.
I suppose it's because I said I lived with his parents, but I choose not to read too much into his expression at me.
I began packing some of my things that I found to be necessary to take with me, such as clothing and valuable possessions being sure to pack as light as possible.
He groaned throwing his head back with a roll to his eyes, then pulling out of her and buttoning back up his trousers as she sat on the kitchen counter watching her friend with a smile.
The final hit. A moan coming from my mouth as I only drip more in my panties from arousal. My panties are so soaked that I was beginning to wonder whether I'd just came from just him spanking me.
''Don't call me that'' she whispers into my neck as I clench my fingers on her waist ''I'd hate to soak your trousers''
''Not unless it's a stare of admiration, no'' I walk over to the other side of his room watch how his eyes follow me once again with a smirk and I resist the curl that tries to find my lips.
''Maybe I should just become an escort'' she mumbled to herself and the brown haired boy knitted his brows at her, not knowing whether to laugh or take her seriously ''I mean, they do make good money-''
She felt him smirk into her skin before his hand was soon finding its way to the hem of her skin tight skirt she wore, dragging it up to just below her stomach as his hand brushed over her lace, black panties which were soaked already.
After everything had been finished for dinner, the three of them seated at the table and I poured them each the wine the chef had chosen for the meal earning a thank you from Narcissa and a nod from Lucius before walking around to Draco side and pouring him a glass to which he lifts his head up and gives me a small smile before quickly dipping his head back down to the table again.
''Well where does it go?'' she huffed feeling quite frustrated with the boy who seemed to be smirking humorously behind her.
I began gathering the glasses and cleaning the table hearing Draco and his mother talking from the living room rather loudly. Loud enough for me to hear without any issue at all.
I bring my one hand up to grip her chin and pull her head back to look at me, those blue eyes glaring down at me.
''You want to cum princess, hm?'' he smirks down at me almost mocking me with a pout and knitted brows and I nod quickly up at him ''Say pretty please''
I nod once ''I'm sure I'll be fine'' I smile and she steps away from me looking pleased with my answer.
He walked back towards her as she stepped back until he pushed her against the library door with a slam of his hand on the wood beside her head making her flinch to the side.
''And that, stop that too'' I rush out again and she lets out a breathily laugh at me, pulling her face more towards me and pressing her forehead against mine.
''Thank you'' I say stepping through the large black door in to the hallway as she walks ahead of me upstairs signalling me to follow her.
''Good girl'' he whispers beginning to circle his finger on my clit again as I let out another soft moan lifting my hips as he presses a finger into my pussy.
He shuts his door and leans against it looking over at me ''You go from timid to rude real quick. Has anyone told you that?'' he frowns as I begin to change his bed sheets.
I go over to the bed looking down at the very cliche maid outfit placed upon it. A short black dress with a white collar and a pair of black stockings. I pick the outfit up and quickly put it on. I pull the stockings up my leg trying my best not to rip them with how thin the material is.
I grab her by the back of her neck and pull her towards my face ''Such a submissive little slut for me'' I smirk whispering almost into her lips as she closes her eyes with her chest pacing up and down.
He looks back up at me with a scowl ''Fuck off'' he mutters flicking the cigarette out the open door and closing it.
''I believe you're already touching me'' she breathed out as his eyes levelled back onto hers with that smirk.
He opens his bedroom door making me frown at him in confusion as he steps to the side putting his hand out in a gentlemanly like fashion to let me go first.
''Hardly without tripping all over the place'' I smirk before setting her feet onto the floor and turning the shower on for her.
''You would be correct my dear Theodore'' I murmur walking over to the window and looking out onto the grounds through the square window and leaning my side against the window sill.
''Well that's good because I was going to go to my room'' I smile seeing how he rolls his eyes at me and looks to the side with a cheeky smile ''Go on then, I'll see you out-''
''Look at me'' I snap at her and her eyes flicker up to mine through her long lashes, my thrusts getting deeper.
I tried to keep myself from smacking the bottle of wine over the girls stupid face, wondering how it would be to turn that red lipstick on her lips to blood instead.
''I'll just finish up in here then, if you want me to?'' I say and he nods back at me ''So you can stare at me for a little bit longer'' I smirk as he looks to the side with a smile.
''We're not 10 mother'' Draco scoffs turning his head away from her as she walks over to him and leans down to press a kiss on his forehead which he scrunches his nose at.
I turn around and look up at him with a frown ''Mr Winkles?'' I say with a look of disbelief and he nods down at me seriously ''Ok then'' I sigh and turn back around placing the quill back to the paper.
Draco never spoke to me, obviously. If I was in the room he'd simply walk back out or if I had walked into the room he was in to clean he would just ignore me, most of the time he read a book or drank. It was all he ever seemed to do after 2 weeks of observing him.
I wake up and hit the shower, feeling the hot water run down my spine as I tilt my head back to wash my hair.
''Whose is what Malfoy?'' I sigh and I feel him lean forward in the chair and place his finger tips around a strand of my hair playing with it between his fingers.
''Remember how I said one of my mates was involved in the whole death eater thing?'' he asked and she nodded slowly back at him ''Well. Draco Malfoy was his name, so''
I pull off my shirt and the rest of my clothes until I'm completely naked before walking towards the shower and opening the door to join her. Her back is turned to me while she lets the warm water trickle down the front of her body.
''Fuck, you're soaked'' he chuckles behind me before latching his lips to my jawline and placing kisses there to my neck.
''Yep. You proud of me?'' I smiled widely at him and he chuckled down at me letting his head tilt to the floor.
''Sounds very friendly'' I hear Draco mutter beside me causing his mother to look down at him in shock as he pushes his food around with his fork still.
''Magic Theodore'' I simply say brushing my hands down his arms ''It's an incredible thing'' I smirk up at him and he nods down at me with a small smile.
Her lips are soft on my skin. That really doesn't help how much I want to press mine on hers so much right now.
He helped her off the kitchen counter allowing her feet to touch the cold, tiled floor and picking up her panties of her.
''You must act quickly Draco, she won't wait around for you'' Lucius says sternly and Draco shakes his head facing down into the table ''What now boy?-''
He turns me a little to push me into the counter, my ass pressing into the black, marble vanity. His hands grip my hair pulling my head to the side to gain more access to my neck again and I feel him bite down harshly on the same bruise he'd created with his teeth that one night.
His eyes grow wide with a smirk ''You think I want to confide in you?'' He chuckles ''that's hilarious''
He looked drained around his father with a lack of life. He was playful from what I had seen, maybe even funny at times around me despite how irritable he was. However, with his father, he was anything but.
Theo placed his hands on her shoulders massaging them gently as he leant his lips down to her ear ''It's alright you know, you don't have to rush looking for a job'' he whispered with a kind smile as her head tilted to the side to look at his face smiling back at her, his hands lowering to wrap around her waist from behind her on the bed.
''Ah'' I wince grabbing the back of his head and playing with his platinum locks between my fingers.
''Nothing'' he breathes out with a shrug looking at me ''There's literally nothing wrong with you'' he says then smiling and picking up his thumb to graze against his lip to which looks like he's trying to cover his smile ''I mean you are really annoying and bratty, but apart from that, nothing I guess''
''You also never answered. It's a yes or no answer it's not that difficult even for your pretty little mind'' he says looking at me closely and leaning himself off the desk to walk back towards me.
''Darling, even if you did take the money I offered you, I really wouldn't have thought anything bad of you'' he says unbothered with a humoured smile ''I would have taken it'' he smirks and I shake my head at him with a smile finding my lips.
''Why are you calling me anyway?'' I ask him, jumping onto the desk to sit down and play with the hem of my dress.
She grabs my cock in her hand and begins to motion it up and down in slow pace making me groan instantly. I pull her head more forward to my erection and she licks a stripe up my cock beginning to teasingly swirl her tongue around the tip.
There she was, the women from the photo walking slowly towards her with an inviting smile on her face.
His hand dropped to the bottom of my dress fiddling with the hem of the black material and sliding it up my body to pull over my head and throw onto the floor beside him, leaving me in just my black lace bra and thong.
What the fuck am I even thinking right now? Read to her? Why would I want to read to the girl? How moronic.
I turn around slowly in front of him as he bends down to level with the bottom of my dress, his fingers picking up the bottom piece which is torn between his fingers.
''Wiltshire, around 10 minutes away'' she answered hearing how her friend sighed in relief with a smile ''The Malfoy Manor'' she mocked a posh accent looking up in Theo who now seemed to be gritting his teeth ''What? What is it?'' she sighed watching his face fall.
''What's wrong baby?'' he whispered coming forward to kiss her on her neck again, all the way to the top of her ear ''Tell me what you want'' he whispered, her eyes flickering shut at the sound of his husky voice in her ear.
''Astoria is here'' she called up to him causing him to close his eyes shut with a scrunch to his nose.
''700'' I smirk up at him trying to be a little more confident as he smirks down at me with a small chuckle.
''What?'' I snap at him, feeling aggravated at the way he stares at me from across the room like a pompous idiot.
''Are you just going to stare at me?'' I ask while polishing over his desk being careful not to move anything out of place.
''Yes Carter. Quick before I change my mind. I don't stay kind for long'' he says and I sigh before lifting myself off the floor and looking down at him sitting in the chair.
''You two do make a lovely couple'' Narcissa says looking between them with a smile as I pour some of the wine into Narcissa's glass too noticing how Draco stays exceptionally quiet throughout this whole conversation, his eyes placed down on his empty whisky glass which he seems to find even more interesting.
''Do I at least get a kiss before you go?'' he asks with a cheeky smile and I rase my eye brows at him as he comes more forward to me ''For your best friend?''
I bow my head down quickly noticing that I was staring at him causing me to feel incredibly embarrassed but also a little threatened in his presence.
He leaned away from my neck and let his eyes devour down my figure before coming back up to my eyes.
He then lets his hands off me and comes back up off the floor to sit back down in his seat beside me while I'm still searching for oxygen, pushing his black sleeves of his shirt back up his arm from where they must have fell.
''Believe me, I'd rather sniff white lines all day than have to stay here with you pair of fucking-''
''I'm ok, but thank you for the offer'' I smile before gesturing his hand to walk ahead of me to the front door.
''You obey me. When I tell you to stand, you stand. When I tell you to sit, you sit'' He says and my eyes glare across the other side of the room finding his gaze nerving before he yanks my face back to look at him by my chin ''when I tell you to look at me, you look at me'' he says before smirking down at me and letting my chin go.
''Red lace, hm?'' he says with a sneer ''His favourite?'' he grits his teeth making me chuckle and shake my head.
''Get here you pathetic little bitch'' he hissed at her making her breath out in disbelief at him and shake her head.
It's only now I realise I'm completely frozen as he stands there in nothing but his Grey jogging bottoms and no t-shirt with his hair laying messily with a strand dangling on his forehead. He looks like he'd just only woken up.
He tilts his head back with a moan ''Ugh, say that again so I can record it'' he smirks biting his lips down at me.
I wonder what he thinks of me. Why he looks at me so often and why he is all of a sudden a little more bearable to be around.
''No, I moved in with my friend and his parents and then we-me and my two friends got a flat together when we reached 18'' I reply seeing how Draco tilts his head up to look at me with an annoyed scowl.
Draco didn't look at me once as he sat next to the brown haired girl at the dinner table drinking along with her and his mother. His face still looked sour, as if he didn't want to be there.
''I asked you first'' I challenge him with my eyes only making both of us slowly smile at each other.
''Yes. Nothing deep, but he's-'' I pause as we continue walking to the bottom of the stairs, her eyes glancing on the side of my face hoping I go on ''He's a little calmer, I guess'' I tilt my head to give her a smile before we reach the last step then walking towards the dining table.
No girl has made me feel like this before. Normally it would be a one time thing and then I couldn't care less where they go or what they do, after all, I didn't really care for them. But her. She is something else. I don't like her though, I could never actually like someone, that's ridiculous.
''Did you need anything else?'' I ask him and he sits there as if he's searching for something before looking behind him at the paper on his desk and holding his one hand in the other rubbing it with a small wince ''Something wrong?'' I say edging closer to him.
''So fucking tight'' I moan slamming all of my cock into her, her moans echoing thorough the bathroom walls as the water from the shower falls down on us both ''You're such a little bitch''
''I really don't understand you'' I whisper to him looking in front of me instead of his face for fear I may stare at him forever.
She moans loudly letting her hands rest flat against the marble tiles letting out a few curses under her breath.
I go to turn around and make my way somewhere else but he opens the door and leans against the doorway looking at me.
He turns me back around slowly and I place my trembling hands back against the wall with my eyes clenched closed. His hand smooths the marks on my ass with the coldness of them, instantly soothing my skin before the final hit.
''Fine'' he says grabbing the door handle and opening the front door before quickly closing it again and turning back around to look at me slowly ''It's a bit cold actually. Think I might just go to my bedroom instead'' he smiles back at me, that entertained smile.
''And why's that mother? Hm? Enlighten me'' he snapped at her clenching his hands into a fist on the edge of the dining table, so strongly that the veins in his hands became more prominent, being easy to see from where even I was standing.
''Where were you then?'' he asks and I sigh in annoyance ignoring his question as I walk towards the library ''Mother said you have the day off'' he says still walking beside me with his hands placed into his pockets.
''I already know you do anyway. I hear you through the walls'' he says with a smile finding his face and my face drops.
He stands from his chair and comes behind it ''It would be much appreciated if you could'' he says gesturing his hand for me to sit down at his desk.
He lifts his head grabbing my cheek and looking down at me, my eyes to my lips then back to my eyes again. He licks his lips as he watches me.
''Yeah, I'll have the money put into your bank tomorrow'' he says naturally as if what we did was nothing.
''Yes, what a stupid question'' I mutter looking to the side and I feel her place a kiss on my cheek making me instantly look back forward to her.
''I'm ungrateful'' Draco mutters to himself with a sarcastic tone as he picks up the wine and downs it in quickly, placing the glass back onto the table.
''Who says that anything else will come with it?'' she asks creeping closer to me until her hand is placed on my chest ''I don't want you, not like that'' she whispers ''To be honest, I don't particularly like you''
''I better be off then'' I say standing up from the sofa in the living room of the flat where Theo and Elara sit with me.
His arm instantly grips around my stomach to keep me from falling once again and turns me around quickly to push me against the wall and drop the belt to the floor.
''How are you sorry? You did nothing wrong'' I mutter back at him then tilting my head up to look at him ''Sorry, I just hear that a lot'' I smile kindly at him and he smiles back down at me.
