The incredible presumptuousness of this statement annoyed Draco only slightly less than the fact that what Potter said was true, at least in part. It wasn’t the prestige of the thing that Draco cared about most, not exactly.
“I couldn’t get him to leave,” Pansy explained, shooting Potter a harassed look. Potter opened his mouth as if to respond, but no sound came out, and a moment later he closed it, never taking his eyes off of Draco.
The honest answer, he realized, was no, he wouldn’t have. In a way, Pansy’s blithe acceptance of what had just moments ago felt like a life-shattering piece of information to Draco was oddly reassuring. If Pansy knew – had known all this time, even – and wasn’t bothered in the slightest, wasn’t even the least bit shaken, then maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t the end of the world as Draco knew it.
Draco’s hands stilled. Leave it to Potter to ask the questions he least expected, and least wanted. He knew there was no good reason for him not to answer, but it was a moment before he was able to find the rights words.
“It’s advanced magic, Occlumency and Legilimency, but you’re by far the most advanced students I’ve ever taught.” She looked around at the eighth years, still smiling. Draco wished she would stop. “Of course, we’ll just stick to learning the theory, because any sort of practical application is, by its nature, rather invasive, and I don’t want to force anyone to give up their privacy in that way.”
They were both breathing heavily. Draco could see the rise and fall of Potter’s chest, fast and irregular. A chill hung in the air and Draco wasn’t sure if it was real or imagined, the fading ghost of memory.
“Are you…?” Potter began, then seemed to think better of it and changed course. “Does this happen a lot?”
“It’s something I intend to continue pursuing,” he answered earnestly. “I think it’s something I could easily become passionate about.”
It sounded so straightforward when Pansy said it. Draco wasn’t so sure it was really that easy, but she said it so assuredly that neither Blaise nor Goyle seemed to know how to contradict her, so for the time being that was that.
, I promised I would take it easy, and it’s not as if brewing potions with Potter is particularly strenuous.”
Contrary to what Draco had always believed, it turned out that Potter was not a total disaster when it came to Potions. In fact, although Draco would never say it to his face, he was actually pretty useful to have around. With Potter helping prepare ingredients and taking notes, testing out formulas was much more efficient than when Draco worked alone. Even though Draco could have easily written up a very basic project proposal to submit, Slughorn had given them a whole week before they needed to let him know what they planned to do, and in that time, Draco was determined to have some preliminary results to show. With Potter’s name on the project, Draco wasn’t too worried about being outright barred from entering the contest, but just to be safe he wanted to make sure their project looked promising.
“Well… good.” Draco was quickly growing uncomfortable again under Potter’s aggressively green gaze. He reached for his book bag, searching through it briefly before pulling out a thick stack of parchment, each page filled with the neat, elegant script of his handwriting. “I’ve been working with a combination of Shrake spine and unicorn hair, for the purifying properties…”
Potter made a noise of surprise but didn’t pull away, only hesitating a second before his hands were tugging Draco closer, one on his shoulder, the other on his hip. The kiss was not cautious or soft, nothing like the first time. It was bruising, a kind of desperation in the way that Draco’s mouth moved and in the way that Potter pushed back, a different kind of duel.
He was going to be sick, just as he was then. He was going to fall to his knees, crying and shaking, and still the screams wouldn’t stop, they wouldn’t stop…
Though he tried to suppress it, he couldn’t quite help the noise he made when Potter’s hand finally wrapped around him. He knew that the angle must be somewhat awkward with how close they were standing, but he didn’t want to put any more space between them, not even to let Potter move his wrist more freely. It didn’t matter, anyway. The motion was still good, fantastic, even. Without thinking, he found himself moving to meet Potter’s hand, chasing after his release.
As if in response to his unspoken need, Potter’s hand moved towards Draco’s belt, stopping at the buckle. His fingers were so close to where Draco wanted them, only a few centimetres and a bit of fabric in the way, an easy barrier to cross. Draco waited for them to tug on his belt, to remove the remaining obstacles, but instead he felt them move away, Potter’s hand settling back on Draco’s waist.
“Er, right.” He cleared his throat. “I wanted to ask if maybe you’d reconsider. About the potions competition.” No use beating around the bush about it, it wasn’t as if Potter expected friendly banter.
“Good, good,” Slughorn nodded thoughtfully, smoothing his moustache. “Well, if you boys need any help or advice in the meantime, you know where to find me.”
Anger twisted on Potter’s face and Draco was satisfied to see that it matched his own. This was the way their relationship should be, the way it had always been: hostile, vindictive, simple. Much simpler than having to think about the pressure of his lips, or the movement of his body, or the cruel tease of forgiveness that his friendship offered.
“Basilisk,” Potter answered simply, as if it were the most normal thing in the world to have been bitten by one of the world’s rarest and most deadly creatures.
Potter inhaled sharply as Draco went down to his knees in front of him. He made quick work of Potter’s belt, but he paused when he reached the zipper, looking up at Potter through his lashes in a silent request for permission. Potter was watching him with a half-lidded gaze, eyes darker than Draco had ever seen them. He licked his lips and nodded, the barest of motions, but it was all the encouragement Draco needed.
A large sofa and a pair of armchairs were grouped around the crackling warmth of the fire, which looked particularly inviting given the dreary rain that had been pattering against the windows all day. One of the armchairs and the far side of the sofa were currently occupied by a group of three students, all of whom appeared to be busy studying. They were angled away from Pansy and Draco, but he could see a head of bright ginger hair bowed over a book on the sofa, a bushy-haired brunette leaning back against the redhead’s legs, diligently scribbling away on a piece of parchment.
Draco waited, expecting him to say more, but nothing else came. Potter was watching him carefully, much calmer than Draco felt. Unbidden, an image came to his mind of a cupboard under a staircase, crowded with shabby bedding and decorated with cobwebs; he saw the red-faced man slamming the door and heard the click of a lock. A sick feeling tugged at Draco’s gut.
He looked around. Each desk had a small pile of grey fabric on it; between the Professor’s expectant expression and Pansy’s not-so-subtle whisper, Draco was able to put it together. Charms was not his specialty, but he had a general affinity for nonverbal magic, so it couldn’t be too difficult. With a tiny nod of confirmation from Pansy, he flicked his wand through the quick series of motions necessary for multipart spell-casting, managing to assemble the wool swatches into a respectably sturdy pair of gloves.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Draco’s voice was low. Though he was looking at Slughorn, the words were for Potter. “I’d never have been able to do it without you.”
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Weasley cut in before Potter had a chance to speak. Granger bit her lip.
That evening, Draco holed himself up in the library after dinner in an effort to give Potter some space, since it seemed his strategy of trying to force the Gryffindor into conversation wasn’t working. Isolating himself with a stack of books also seemed like a good way to refocus his attention on what mattered most: the potion. They had recently discovered that the addition of Bubotuber pus, while promising in its healing properties, seemed to react poorly with the Shrake spine over time, resulting in several shattered vials and a deeply unpleasant smell that, try as he might, Draco had not been able to remove from his best pair of dragonhide gloves.
had provided ample fodder for the wildest of theories about Potter’s involvement in the situation, and given Draco’s reputation, he wouldn’t be surprised if everyone had somehow managed to twist the event to make him look like the perpetrator rather than the victim.
They watched with bated breath as Draco dripped the potion onto one of the squares of skin. Their previous trials had resulted in everything from severe charring to a rash of bright purple spots, and even their best attempt had still caused a mild outbreak of boils, so it was impossible to expect too much. And yet every time, Draco couldn’t help but hope. With the addition of the Mandrake root, maybe…
He was almost finished scribbling down the details of the Mandrake root’s effects when Potter spoke up.
“Yeah.” The smile came easily to him now when he looked at Potter, the green of his eyes, the kiss-stained colour of his lips. “Will you help?”
They followed McGonagall up the stairs, immediately breaking into whispered conversation. Whether the other students were more excited or apprehensive, Draco couldn’t tell. Once they had reached the third floor, McGonagall guided them to a large wooden door flanked by the stone bust of a very old, square-jawed wizard.
Thank you so so much to everyone who has been reading or is still reading, your likes and comments mean the world to me and I really hope that you enjoy this chapter!
Draco spent the rest of lunch waiting just outside of the Great Hall, pacing as he tried to work out exactly what he wanted to say. He knew Potter had the next period free and Draco hoped to catch him alone for a moment before his own Advanced Arithmancy class. But when he finally spotted the familiar trio heading towards the stairs —
For some reason, Potter seemed irked by this response. His frown deepened, a small crease appearing on his forehead.
Any hopes Draco might have had of returning to his research were long gone. For the rest of the evening, in a way that was almost becoming a habit, his thoughts were wholly occupied by Potter.
Draco breathed a silent sigh of relief. At one point in his life, detention might have seemed like the worst punishment imaginable, but now, it sounded like a gift. Maybe Miranda McKinnon had harboured some malicious intent when she pointed her wand at him; maybe she hated him for being a Death Eater and had wanted to watch him suffer. Or maybe she was just a scared little girl who had seen and endured far too much and was simply trying to do what she thought was right. It didn’t matter. Maybe it wasn’t much, but Draco couldn’t stand to think that he was the reason for any more punishment.
playing at?” Potter took a step forward, eyes flashing. Neither of them had lowered their wands. “You’re the one that started digging through my memories, you had no right—”
It was lucky, Draco thought with a sort of dark, private humour, that both he and Potter were used to late nights with little sleep. They took full advantage of the later curfew that the eighth years were afforded, even daring to push past it on occasion when they got absorbed in their work. It was something of a precarious balance, working on the potion while also trying to keep up with the regular workload of their classes in preparation for their N.E.W.T.s at the end of the school year.
“Did you come here just to watch me undress?” Draco asked, the coolness in his voice belying the way his heart had begun to pound as pushed his shirt off his shoulders. The question seemed to do the trick – Potter turned his gaze away from Draco’s bare torso, cheeks red.
Potter said nothing, only leaned forward slightly, hands pressing into the sheets. He was close enough now that Draco could smell the warm, woodsy scent of his cologne, and he realized that it would be all too simple, if he wanted, to push himself up, just a little bit, and meet Potter’s lips with his own.
Pansy pursed her lips and levelled him with a glare. She looked rather like his mother when she did that, which was enough to make him yield.
Pansy sighed, flipping her long hair over her shoulder as she stood. “Fine, fine, whatever you say.”
Finished with the buttons, Potter let his shirt slip to the floor, and Draco had to swallow hard to keep down the odd sort of whimper that threatened to leave his throat. There was suddenly so much bare skin on display, unexpected and unasked for –
Draco started at him blankly, uncomprehending. It made no sense – he didn’t want to get rid of any of his scars? How could that be? Surely Potter, more than anyone, knew the burden that a scar could be; surely he must understand the weight of being forever marked with a relic of misfortune and suffering, the pain of being permanently branded with a reminder of the past. What kind of person wouldn’t want to be free of that?
Draco should’ve seen it coming. It was a testament to how distracted he was that the loud banging on his door caught him by surprise.
Whatever progress they might have made towards civility vanished with the sudden coldness in Draco’s voice. Potter shook his head, his expression almost disappointed as he muttered a perfunctory “Whatever, Malfoy,” and moved to leave.
Up to that point, the shop had seemed empty of anyone else, but as soon as Draco approached the counter, someone appeared so quickly it was almost as if out of thin air. Startled, Draco took a step backward, nearly treading on Potter’s foot in the process. The shopkeeper – a squat, bearded old man in olive-coloured robes – squinted between them, lips pressed in a thin line. Maybe Draco was just being paranoid, but he felt sure the man recognized them, although he said nothing as he accepted the coins that Draco handed him, and he disappeared from sight once more almost as soon as Draco turned away.
Draco couldn’t tell if he felt more confused or exasperated. Potter had been so adamant before that he didn’t want the extra workload, that he was much too occupied with everything else in his very busy life. Why the bloody hell did he suddenly want to be involved?
Everything about Potter was gentle as he pulled away, from the way his eyes traced the lines of Draco’s face to the small smile that curled his lips.
“I think it’s a great idea,” Potter answered, and something in his voice made Draco wonder if maybe he understood exactly why Draco wanted to make this potion. “Amazing, actually.”
Abruptly, the memories were gone. Draco stumbled a step back as if he had been shoved. He only had a second to feel disoriented before he was overcome with a renewed slew of memories, this time his own: he was fifteen, pressing a hand over Pansy’s mouth to silence her giggling as they stole firewhiskey from her parents’ liquor cabinet; he was alone on the Quidditch pitch, the sun just beginning to rise as he practiced; he was eight years old, tugging on his father’s sleeve to get his attention, only to be brushed off; he was standing frozen as screams echoed around him, his wand shaking in his hand, his vision blurred by fear—
Time was a fickle thing. Draco could remember enduring days in Azkaban that had felt like years, each minute longer than the last. Now, when he might have wished for more, the hours felt like they were slipping through his fingers.
Draco was not prepared for this response. He had been expecting Potter to ask what was in it for him, to take advantage of his obvious position of power over Draco in that moment. He hadn’t expected
“Are you sure this is safe?” Potter twisted the tap until the water stopped flowing, frowning at the murky surface below.
He made a point of meeting Potter’s steady gaze. Potter didn’t flinch, but Draco knew he got the message.
It was only the beginning steps of an overwhelmingly finicky process, and though it was a double period, Blaise and Draco did not speak again for the rest of the class. Draco preferred it that way; focusing on the careful measurements and the soft sounds of bubbling soothed him as he worked, even as his classmates grew more and more visibly frustrated around him.
“Here,” he said, thrusting the vial he had just uncorked into Potter’s hand. “Pour that in the cauldron and stir it clockwise until it boils.”
Draco felt his cheeks warm. “Well, that’s easy for you to say, isn’t it? You’re not the one being stared at by some pervert while you strip.”
“You really should take it easy for a bit.” Pansy’s voice came from the other side of the privacy curtain as Draco dressed. He had managed to negotiate with Madam Pomfrey to wear his own pyjamas rather than the abhorrent hospital gown she had first offered him, but after almost four days, it was nice to finally put on a pair of real trousers again. “Or for tonight, at least.”
Draco blinked, face growing warm when he realized that he had been so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he had missed Potter’s question.
It was easier when it was just the two of them, heads bent together over a cauldron, stealing kisses. When they were alone together, Draco let himself consider it. He weighed the words on his tongue and watched Potter’s expression, wondering how he’d react if Draco said it, if he would smile.
“Gods, no. But my mother cares about bloodlines, not fidelity.” Pansy resumed her place on the floor, flipping back through the pages of Witch Weekly to find where she had left off. “I’ll have a semi-regular fling with some gorgeous half-blood who looks just enough like you that my mum won’t question why our children don’t have the Malfoy eyes, and you can have an affair with a fit Quidditch player. Everybody wins.”
Ashamed, Draco shook the thoughts away and forced himself to raise his gaze. Despite how vehemently he had been arguing with Pansy only moments ago, Potter looked calm now, although the green of his eyes was darkened by an emotion Draco couldn’t identify.
Potter rolled his eyes, but Draco could see that he was smiling too. “Yeah, yeah, you were right, is that what you wanted to hear?”
“Of course.” He blinked. The canopy above him seemed different, somehow, although he couldn’t quite put his finger on what it was. The fabric was still the same, the colour unchanged, and yet… “I know you like to think you’re so mysterious, but it hardly takes a genius to know your type.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, and Draco wished he wouldn’t say his name like that, all soft and rounded at the edges, warm like the light of the fire reflecting on his glasses, almost as if he was glad to see Draco standing there. It was too much, too obvious. “What…?”
Potter’s chair was set close to the bed, and although he was leaned back in his seat now, Draco wondered if maybe he had propped his arms on the bed while Draco slept, or if he had even reached out to touch Draco’s hand, as Pansy did. The thought made his stomach twist. He avoided Potter’s eyes, hoping that maybe, if he forced himself to focus on something else, he could dispel the indecent images that plagued him. But staring at Potter’s hands, clasped loosely in his lap, proved to be no better—Draco could not stop picturing how the Potter of his dreams had used those wicked fingers to torment him into bliss.
Draco let out a sigh of frustration. “I’m not upset. It’s just weird, is all. The whole conversation was weird. You should’ve heard the nosy questions he was asking, and the way he smiled, it was so…”
He was in the prefects’ bathroom, steam thick in the air as he moved through the murky water. He was tracing his fingers along pale lines of scar. He was leaning in—
Draco directed a rude hand gesture his way. His potion had turned a dark blue colour with the addition of the aconite, indicating it was time to start adding the powdered moonstone with two counterclockwise stirs every thirty seconds.
“Not bad, not bad!” Finnigan appraised, already making himself at home on the sofa. As other students moved forward to explore the room, Draco stayed back, hands shoved deep in his pockets.
Potter shook his head, smiling a little. “It’s nothing, really. I’ve just never seen you laugh like that before.”
A few seconds passed in which Potter remained blissfully unaware of the surely very awkward encounter that was about to occur, and then Granger quietly cleared her throat, drawing his attention. His eyes flicked over to her, then moved to Pansy, expression rapidly shifting to confusion as his gaze finally landed on Draco.
“Is that good or bad?” Potter raised his head from his arms to look at the potion, expression caught somewhere between hopeful and concerned.
It had been three days now since he and Potter had spoken. They’d exchanged a few stiff “hellos” in the common room here and there when courtesy called for it, but never more than that. Draco wasn’t even entirely sure who was avoiding who at this point. He had been careful to keep his distance ever since Potter caught him eavesdropping in the library, even though Potter had pretended he hadn’t, but Draco knew that they couldn’t keep this up forever. Soon enough, Slughorn would expect a report on the progress they had made with their potion, and if Potter had no idea what was going on, it would be all too apparent that they were no longer working together. Then Draco would really be in trouble.
Professor Flitwick came bustling down the hall then, squeaking out an apology for his lateness as he ushered the students into the classroom. Draco took his usual seat in the back, which made it easier to ignore the pointed glances and carrying whispers of his classmates. Ignoring Potter, however, proved much more difficult; twice during the lesson, he caught the Gryffindor looking over his shoulder at him from across the room, not even seeming to care how many of their classmates noticed.
They locked eyes and Draco’s heart stuttered. For a brief moment, Potter smiled, and like a reflex, Draco smiled back, just a little.
his bleary mind supplied, reluctantly letting go of the lingering visions of bare skin and frantic kissing from his dreams in order to focus on the two people who sat on opposite sides of his bed, paying him no attention as they quarrelled.
“We still care about each other,” Potter shrugged. “Her brother is my best friend, and the Weasleys are pretty much my family. She’s always going to be a part of my life. And it’s not like we broke up because we hated each other or anything.”
Potter huffed a laugh, looking both pleased and embarrassed at the compliment. “And here you thought I would be no help,” he teased.
“Come on, out with it, Malfoy.” Draco could not focus on what Potter was saying. At the sound of his name, all he could think of was what it would feel like whispered against his skin. “What is it?”
Potter sighed, resting his chin on one hand and drumming his fingers on the edge of the table as they waited. It took all of Draco’s willpower to stop himself from stilling Potter’s restless hand with his own.
But he was sure about this, so sure that he felt as if his bones were aching with it. And he could try to tell Potter that – tell him
He applied it to only a small section of one of the scars, just where it began up near his collarbone. The potion burned as it touched his skin, dark tendrils of smoke curling away from his body like the smouldering remnants of a fire. The smoke was darker
He shrugged, his whole demeanour uncertain, like he was waiting for Draco to tell him it was a stupid idea and there was no way it would be helpful. Except it wasn’t a stupid idea, not at all. In fact, it was such a good idea that Draco was in the midst of a small internal crisis, trying to decide it was acceptable to kiss Potter square on the mouth right there in the middle of the shop.
“I think you’ve already celebrated plenty tonight,” Draco teased, although the flush of alcohol had long since faded from the Gryffindor’s cheeks. “What do you suggest?”
“No.” There was an odd glint in Pansy’s eyes, and when she smirked, Draco felt the first tinge of suspicion. “I think we should work here in the common room, actually.”
Sitting in that courtroom, head bowed and hands trembling, Draco had been sure that he would never see sunlight again. The sky had been clear and blue the day of the trial; he had soaked in every second of it as they brought him from Azkaban, where they had kept all of the Death Eaters awaiting trial after the battle at Hogwarts. Those few blissful minutes of warmth, he had thought, would surely be his last. They would hear of his cruelty and his failures, they would see his cowardice, and they would throw him straight back to that tiny stone cell. It would have been no more than he deserved.
Although the question was directed at them both, Draco knew both Slughorn and Potter were looking to him for an answer. “Yes, Professor, that shouldn’t be a problem,” Draco replied. “I have some ideas already.”
“What are you on about?” Despite his annoyance, Draco made no move to shake off Potter’s hand. At this point it seemed like pig-headed Potter probably wouldn’t let him leave without a fight, anyway. “Not two days ago you told me—”
“Thank you for the demonstration, Mr. Malfoy,” Flitwick squeaked. “Perhaps just a bit more attention next time, hm?”
“We are very fortunate that, for the most part, we have been able to restore the school to its former condition in time for the start of term, and I am sure you are all excited to be back and ready for your classes tomorrow morning, so I shall send you off to get a good night’s rest,” McGonagall finished. “Eighth years, if you will please stay behind.”
At some point, Potter’s hand came up to rest against Draco’s head, the touch so soft that Draco didn’t notice it at first. Even as Draco began to move faster, Potter’s every other breath a gasp, his fingers against Draco’s hair were gentle.
He inhaled deeply, the air in his lungs painful. His voice was too loud in the empty corridor. Potter’s hand was still on his arm, somewhere near his elbow, and he used the light grasp to pull Draco towards an empty classroom, closing them inside.
“Well… thanks.” Another word Draco was unaccustomed to saying to Potter, but this one at least felt a little less painful. “I’ll tell Slughorn tomorrow. Or, actually…” He remembered Slughorn’s words from earlier, cautioning him not to pressure Potter into something he didn’t want to do. “Could you tell him that you changed your mind?”
Fortunately, Draco did not have to endure it for long. As Professor McGonagall — now Headmistress McGonagall — stood to give the customary start of term speech, Potter’s attention shifted towards the staff table.
He wasn’t sure if Potter believed him, but he didn’t press. They separated when they reached the common room, Potter saying something about an unfinished essay, Draco saying little more than a cursory goodbye. He had promised to meet Pansy for dinner, but instead of continuing down to the Great Hall, he went to the library, ensconcing himself at a table in a deserted corner near the restricted section.
Pansy sighed in relief as she was freed of the weight of the last two volumes. Then, eyeing his collar, she advised, “You should probably do up the rest of your buttons first.”
“Mr. Malfoy, since you have more experience with Occlumency,” Professor Hayward was saying, her words sounding oddly distant, “I think it would make sense for Mr. Potter to attempt to break into your thoughts, while you try to defend against him.”
He tried to focus through Arithmancy, which as a general rule was too demanding of a subject to allow for any distractions, but last period Charms was a different story. Potter was already sitting towards the front of the room with his friends by the time Draco arrived, which meant speaking before class was out of the question. Instead, Draco tuned out Flitwick’s review of combination nonverbal spells in favour of staring at the back of Potter’s head as if that bird’s nest of black hair might give him some sort of insight. What was the best way to convince Potter to help him? Should he appeal to Potter’s saviour complex? Should he offer to help him study in return? Potter had said he wanted to focus on his N.E.W.T.s, and Merlin knew he wasn’t the bookish type. Would that be enough?
“You will find your things already in your dormitories, which are down that hallway,” McGonagall gestured. “As you are all adults, you will be given a bit more leeway than you have been allowed in the past — a later curfew, and open leave to go to Hogsmeade. However,” she interrupted Thomas and Finnigan’s shouts of glee, “I expect that you will all conduct yourselves as
“It’s the most prestigious potions publication in all of Europe.” It was a silly question, Draco thought. But then again, Potter had been raised by Muggles, and he’d clearly never had much interest in any kind of academic achievement. Perhaps he simply didn’t understand. “You should consider it an honour to even be offered the chance. I, for one, don’t want to waste it.”
They stood there like two people stupefied, caught in mutual shock and wordless understanding. Draco didn’t have to ask what Potter was doing there; on some level, he knew. But the silence was too much, and after seconds that seemed to last years, he finally dared to break it.
But in the end, his anxiety had proved to be unfounded. The next day, Potter had smiled at him in the hallway before class, small but meaningful. Then, halfway through Transfiguration, he had passed Draco a note asking if he wanted to work on their potion that night after dinner, smiling again when Draco replied back with a simple scrawled yes.
Draco was almost certain that any more public interactions with Potter would only make things worse for them both, but he also knew how painfully oblivious Potter could be. Judging by the way the Gryffindor kept glancing in his direction, it seemed he wasn’t about to leave well enough alone, so when class ended, Draco told his friends to go ahead to Transfiguration without him.
” Draco spluttered, gaping in shock at the Gryffindor inexplicably undressing right in front of his eyes.
The logic seemed straightforward enough, but another twenty minutes and three applications later, the skin still remained resolutely scarred.
“What are you doing?” Draco grumbled, having nearly stumbled into her when she abruptly came to a stop in front of him. “Aren’t we going to the library?”
There was a familiar glint in Potter’s eyes: it was the look he wore when he was seconds away from stealing the Snitch out from under Draco’s grasp; the look he wore moments before aiming a jinx; the undeniable look of someone who not only refused to back down but who knew they would triumph. It made Draco shiver.
Pansy finally glanced up. “Oh, sorry, was that insensitive?” She arranged her features into something that might have been an attempt at looking supportive, but mostly just looked like she had smelled something foul. “What I meant to say was – wow, I’m so surprised, thank you for trusting me. I hope you know that I love you no matter what.”
“No,” Potter answered quickly. He glanced over at Weasley and Granger, then amended, “Er, well, yes, I guess I do, with both, but I’m useless at it, I swear.”
Potter stood unmoving, face flushed, his green eyes fixed on Draco. As the silent seconds ticked by, measured only by the pounding of Draco’s heart, it dawned on him that Potter wasn’t going to say anything else – because he didn’t want this to stop.
It felt like a lifetime ago that they were in that bathroom, so different than the one they were in now. A lifetime ago that he was the boy full of rage and fear, bleeding on the floor.
His fingers were steady as he tugged down Potter’s trousers, just enough to expose where he was straining against the material of his underwear. They remained steady as he touched Potter through the fabric, brushing featherlight against the hard heat, rubbing softly over the small wet spot near the tip. Potter’s breathing hitched and Draco could see his palms pressed back flat against the wall, like he was clinging to it for support.
He didn’t have to look up to know that Potter was still watching him. Where else would he be looking? There was nothing else, not right now; no distance beyond or between, just them and their ragged breaths and rapid hearts – Draco’s much too loud, too obvious. He could feel it racing as his fingers ran along the edge of Potter’s briefs – only a hint of teasing – before hooking over the elastic and pulling it down. He licked his lips and swallowed once, heavily, and then his mouth was around Potter’s cock.
“What’s up with you, anyway?” The Weasel’s voice carried from behind the shelves to Draco’s right, loud enough that it wasn’t quite muffled by the oppressive quiet that Draco was half certain Madam Pince charmed into the walls of the library itself. “You’ve been acting weird all day.”
He whirled around. “What do you want from me, Potter?” The anger had soured, the taste of it unpleasant on his tongue. There was something desperate in the way the words came out, as if clawed from deep in his chest. “Do you want me to apologise? Is that it? Well, fine. I’m sorry, alright? I’m sorry for—”
, I will personally… Oh.” The threat faded on his tongue when he saw Potter’s grin. Of course, the Gryffindor was just messing with him. Draco scowled, shoving his stool back from the table. “You’re not nearly as funny as you think you are, you know.”
“Fine, fine, not tonight.” He shook his head in exasperation. Between her and Madam Pomfrey, you would think he was still eleven years old. Turning his attention back to Potter, he said, “I have some correspondence I need to take care of anyway.” Pansy's expression had reminded him of his mother’s letter, and he knew it was probably best to respond soon before she began to worry too much.
Before Draco could ask the question ready on his tongue, they were interrupted by the arrival of Professor McGonagall. The Headmistress’s expression was stony as she strode through the doors of the Hospital Wing, although upon noticing that Draco was awake, the firm set of her lips seemed to soften slightly.
“Why don’t you go spend a few weeks in Azkaban and see what it does for your appetite?” With one swift movement, he snatched the stirring rod out of Potter’s slack hand; the potion had begun to froth and was dangerously close to boiling over. “My personal habits are none of your concern,” he snarled. “And in case you haven’t noticed, you look like shit too. When was the last time you slept?”
Eye contact was essential for Legilimency, and Draco didn’t shy from it now. A resolve had taken over him, an eagerness even – after so many weeks of wondering what lay behind Potter’s gaze, he was going to get to see for himself.
Draco immediately tore his gaze away, flushed and embarrassed, turning his back to Potter so that he wouldn’t have to see that awful smirk on his face.
The way she said it, like she was implying something else, made Draco squirm. But there was no way she could know. Was there?
Potter nodded. When Draco continued to stare at him, he added, “It sort of bit me when I killed it.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, of course I still want to,” Draco said brusquely. Relieved as he was that Potter still wanted to work with him, he wasn’t about to give the Gryffindor any reason to think he was
“Why don’t you back off?” Potter retorted, seeming to come back to himself. He reached as if to grab the stirring rod, but Draco smacked his hand away.
“I just did, alright?” Potter evaded, sounding more defensive than Draco thought he had any right to be. “Now, what kind of potion are we making?”
hexing him, for all he knew. That, at least, would make sense — much more sense than Potter smiling at him, or wanting to help him, or telling him that his ideas were amazing. Whatever game Potter was playing, it was messing with Draco’s head, and he didn't know how much more he could take.
How cruel Potter was, Draco thought, to provoke him with those suggestive words and that heated look—that impossible look, as if he might have actually
Draco was getting very tired of being told what he could and could not do. “I didn’t promise that I would
“I guess I’ve lost my taste for them,” Draco answered with a shrug. It was the easiest answer, even if it wasn’t necessarily the whole truth. He’d always had a sweet tooth as a child, but now he couldn’t think of the last time he had actually craved the cakes or candies he used to love. Did he still like sweets? He wasn’t sure anymore.
But if Potter had a problem with the frequency of their meetings, he didn’t show it. He followed all of Draco’s directions without protest, and after that first meeting, he never showed up even a minute late. Their conversations were simple and mostly focused on their work – there was no hint of the suggestiveness from the stairwell, which Draco was beginning to think he had imagined altogether – but at the least their interactions no longer felt so awkward or forced.
been using his fork to slowly pick it apart into smaller and smaller pieces until it resembled little more than a crumbled mess. In his opinion, that counted as an entirely valid use, but it seemed Pansy thought otherwise.
Though, Slytherin wasn’t the only house affected – after everything that had happened last year, and the battle that had nearly destroyed the school, many parents had simply been too afraid to let their children return to Hogwarts.
Robbed of the ability to further pulverize his food, Draco shoved his plate away, appetite long gone.
Draco’s fingers tightened reflexively around his wand. “They don’t allow prisoners to use magic.” His mouth felt very dry. “How did you convince them?”
They leaned in at the same time, Potter balancing his hand against the wall beside Draco’s head. “Maybe I was.”
work. But at that point, it would be so prohibitively impractical that what even would be the point?”
It didn’t help that, after the first day, Potter continued to visit each afternoon. He always had some small excuse—to bring Draco an assignment or to convey a message from Slughorn—but he tended to linger longer than was necessary, his glances heavy with a significance that Draco refused to acknowledge. Between Madam Pomfrey’s watchful eye and Pansy, Blaise, and Goyle’s frequent presence, their conversations never lasted more than five minutes and consisted only of banal pleasantries and the occasional half-hearted insult. Yet every time Potter left, Draco felt a strange twinge of disappointment. He told himself that it didn’t mean anything, and that it wasn’t worth worrying over, but it would be much easier to convince himself of that if he didn’t have so much damn free time in which to obsess over it.
Unable to stand there a second longer, he added an abrupt, “I’ll see you tomorrow, Potter,” and turned to climb the last steps to the main floor. Though he wanted nothing more than to flee to his dormitory, he kept his pace unhurried as he headed to the Great Hall. He knew Potter was behind him, watching, and it would look weird if he skipped dinner now after he had expressly said he was going to meet Pansy.
Draco shook off Pansy’s hand from where she was still gripping his sleeve, like he was a wild animal liable to bolt at any moment. It was too late to run now.
Draco’s heart thudded as Potter’s eyes flickered to him, making it clear exactly what the research was for. He’d had no idea that Potter was doing research for their potion on his own.
He opened his mouth, hoping the right words would come to him, but in the end nothing did, and the door closing as Potter left was the loudest sound between them that night.
Draco recoiled at the image. He realized, then, what Potter was doing: he had wanted Draco to see these memories, to force them upon him in a way Draco could not deny. But unluckily for Potter, Draco knew how to push back.
Draco rolled his eyes. He had never found the Weasel to be very bright, but these accusations seemed particularly unfounded – he had not done anything even remotely suspicious for at least a few months now, and certainly not since coming back to Hogwarts.
It was a ridiculous thing to complain about, since Draco had practically begged Potter to help him; obviously he had been hoping Potter would agree. But now that had said yes, and after the way he had looked at Draco—the way he was looking at Draco so often nowadays—the Slytherin couldn’t stop thinking that none of it made sense. He was the last person Potter should be doing anything for.
They worked quietly together like that for a while, and although it wasn’t exactly companionable, it at least wasn’t wholly unpleasant, which was better than Draco might have expected. After about twenty minutes of silence, Granger rolled up the essay she’d been working on and set it aside, reaching for her bookbag. Draco spared her an idle glance as she began to search through it, noticing her efforts gradually become more frantic.
“What do you mean?” Potter’s response was much quieter, and Draco found himself leaning over in his chair to try and hear. “Everything’s fine.”
“Oh no?” Whether it was mischief or mockery in Potter’s tone, Draco couldn’t quite tell. “So does it always take you twenty minutes just to get your trousers off?”
—suddenly threatened to overwhelm him. He swallowed and stepped back, holding the stair railing to keep himself steady, and mustered an approximation of a sneer.
In unspoken agreement, they took separate paths to Transfiguration. It might not be enough to stop the gossip or even the harassment, but at least for now, Draco was content to keep the secret of exactly how much time he spent in Potter’s company.
“Why not?” Pansy asked innocently. “You and Potter have been spending an awful lot of time together these days. I thought you’d want to sit with him, since you two are
Draco didn’t reply. Pansy seemed to take the hint. “Well, anyway, I have some Transfiguration reading to finish.” As she stood to leave, she reached over and ruffled his hair affectionately, making Draco scowl. “I’ll see you at breakfast in the morning?” Her tone left little room for negotiation, and after standing her up for dinner, Draco didn’t dare argue. He nodded and Pansy departed, the door clicking shut behind her. Though she was gone, her voice lingered in his mind.
“Oi, mate, I think Potter’s coming over to talk to you.” Draco barely felt Blaise’s nudge against his shoulder. He had already looked up, eyes finding Potter’s in an instant. The Gryffindor was still halfway across the Great Hall, but there was no mistaking where his intent gaze was fixed. Draco’s stomach swooped, the part of him that still burned with remembered touches wanting nothing more than to see Potter, to speak to him, to be close to him again.
Draco was so hard it was almost painful, unable to help the way his nails dug into Potter’s skin, although Potter didn’t seem to mind. His hips had started moving against Draco in an achingly unsatisfying rhythm, the friction so good and yet nowhere near enough. His breath was coming in gasps, lips hovering just over Potter’s. He flattened his palm against the small of Potter’s back beneath his shirt, guiding his movements, seeking something faster, harder,
Draco, who had been in the middle of trying to cast a very casual and definitely not practiced glance across the Great Hall to where a certain Gryffindor sat eating his breakfast, forced himself to focus his attention on his best friend.
“Actually,” Potter said, green eyes meeting grey like flint striking stone, “Malfoy is a great Occlumens. I think he should give the demonstration with me.”
“As if.” Pansy brushed his comment off with a wave of her hand. “Anyone with even a passing attraction to women is interested in me. Anyone with taste, at least.”
The confusing rush of guilt and shame and gratitude that Draco had felt with that one gesture had been worse than all the hateful stares of the Wizengamot put together. Disgust and anger he could handle; he had many years of practice in those. But Draco could not bear what he saw in Potter’s eyes then, nor what he felt inside himself.
Draco held up the ingredients he’d collected, all of the bottles small enough to fit in one hand. “A few possibilities,” he said, the glass clinking as he adjusted his grip. “I think the dittany leaves could be useful. I’ve tried using essence of dittany before, of course, but maybe with the whole leaves…”
”  Draco ducked his head, his nose practically pressed against the books as he tried to see if Potter’s expression would betray the same flash of irritation that was in his voice. “I told you already, Ron, he’s not up to anything. We’re just working on a project.”
But the Irish idiot didn’t seem keen to let it go. “How many curses will it take for you to realize that no one wants you here, Malfoy?” Finnigan jeered.
“Mandrake root.” Draco held out a handful of the gnarled objects for Potter to examine before tipping a portion of them into the cauldron. At first, nothing happened, but after three stirs, the potion fizzed and darkened to a rich chestnut colour.
They met at the main gates late that Saturday morning, the clouds overhead heavy with the promise of rain. They’d both wrapped scarves around their necks against the brisk autumn air, Potter’s striped in Gryffindor colours, a bright flash of red and gold, Draco’s a pale grey, the same colour as the overcast sky.
He knew he shouldn’t ask, shouldn’t even care really, but his mouth was quicker than his judgment. “Why did you break up?” He couldn’t help but think of the rumours that Pansy had told him, of Potter’s
“Oh, thank Merlin,” she cried, flinging herself at him in what Draco thought was a thoroughly overdramatic fashion. “You’re alright! Oh, I was so worried!”
“But you said yourself, you don’t hate him anymore,” Pansy pointed out. “Which, by the way, when did you stop hating Potter?”
“Draco.” Pansy’s voice was suddenly very close to his ear, her fuchsia nails pressing into his wrist. “Potter is
Pansy glared. “You said you’d meet me in the Great Hall for dinner and you never showed up,” she accused, folding her arms across her chest. “What do you call that?”
Draco managed to hide his smile by leaning over his notes. “Very, very occasionally, I’m sure. Now keep stirring, I don’t think we should start from scratch just yet.”
“Why?” Draco pushed away from the desk, turning to face Potter fully. The distance between them was no longer quite so careful, both of them toeing an invisible line. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen if they crossed it, and he didn’t know which possibility he was most afraid of.  “Why do we have to talk about anything? Why can’t we just—”
“You know,” Potter dipped a tentative finger in the water, then lifted it to drip a few droplets onto the inside of his wrist, right at the base of his hand. “Like how you test milk for babies after you heat it up, to see if it’s too warm?”
“What if I want to help with the work?” Potter asked, pushing his hair back from his face. He looked slightly flushed, probably from running up the stairs.
As her only child, she had always worried over Draco more than was perhaps necessary, but her fretting had reached new levels ever since Draco had told her he planned to return to Hogwarts. It was understandable, of course, but now that he was gone, he could only imagine how frayed her nerves must be, alone in the silence of that old house, still so heavy with nightmares. Draco wasn’t about to add to her anxiety, not over a few shattered ribs and some minor petrification.
Immediately after the question left his mouth, Potter flushed, as if he’d said something he shouldn’t have. He was right, of course, but Draco didn’t pause to wonder how Potter knew that.
“What is ‘as you suspected’?” Draco demanded, looking from Madam Pomfrey to Pansy and then finally to Potter. Although he had been too distracted when he first awoke to give much thought to the pain in his ribs and the curious lack of feeling in his left arm, he was now acutely aware both that something might be very wrong and that, for some reason, nobody seemed to be offering any explanation. “Is anyone going to tell me what happened? Why am I here?”
Pansy raised one perfectly arched eyebrow as she smoothed her Charms notes on the arm of the sofa, a feigned disinterest so well-crafted that Draco might have admired it, if he weren’t so apprehensive about whatever was about to come out of her mouth.
How humiliating, that Potter should once again be the one to act as his saviour. Draco knew his face was red, both from shame and anger, but more curiously, so was Potter’s. He averted his eyes as Draco glanced over at him, cheeks flushed as if embarrassed that by the fact that he had rushed to Draco’s side.
Draco frowned. “Why would you want to do that?” He stepped forward, hoping Potter would take the hint and move out of his way, but the Gryffindor didn’t budge. “You said yourself you didn’t want any extra work, and I am exempting you from any obligation. All you need to worry about is liaising with Slughorn. Now get out of my way.” He attempted to move forward again, this time using his shoulder to try and shove Potter out of his way. The other boy didn’t put up any resistance and Draco almost thought that would be the end of it. That is, until he felt Potter grab his arm.
“If you say so.” Potter shrugged, leaning his shoulders back against the side of the tub. His dark hair stood in stark contrast to the pale stone behind him, and the soft light from the candle-filled chandelier above the bath cast a pleasant glow over his skin. His gaze wandered interestedly around the room, eyes eventually settling on the lone piece of décor on the walls, a large, gilt-framed portrait of a mermaid. “You know, I don’t think I ever really took advantage of this place like I should’ve. It’s actually pretty nice.”
He was pleased to feel the way Potter shivered when his fingers dared to sneak under the hem of the Gryffindor’s shirt, skating over the soft skin of his abdomen. But the tables were quickly turned on him, Draco gasping as Potter’s knee pressed between his legs. His head fell back against the wall, overwhelmed by the hard line of Potter’s arousal resting against his own, and Potter took the opportunity to trail his lips down Draco’s neck. His thumb traced the line of Draco’s jaw and settled over the rabbit-fast beat of his pulse, keeping Draco’s head tilted so that he could kiss all the way down to Draco’s collarbone, leaving a bite at the juncture of his shoulder and neck before tracing a teasing path back up with the tip of his tongue.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he just pulled Potter towards him, the press of their lips marked by the lingering spice of firewhisky and the exhilaration of success. “First,” he smiled as he broke away from the kiss, Potter chasing after him, “I have to make some notes, so that we don’t forget everything and have to go back through this whole trial-and-error process all over again.” He gave Potter one last kiss before he stepped away, Potter reluctantly letting go of his waist. “Then we can celebrate.”
It was a longer answer than he might have normally given, maybe longer than Potter expected, but the other boy just nodded, seeming to understand.
“I’ll meet you there, Pans.” Draco pushed her hand away, impatient. “There’s something I have to do.”
“Five minutes late is still late,” Draco answered, realizing as he said it that he sounded exactly like his mother. He looked up briefly to see Potter roll his eyes. He continued to fuss around with his potions equipment, arranging everything just so while Potter watched in an interested sort of way, leaning his elbows on the table. Draco didn’t know how he could look so relaxed; after their last conversation, even a quick glance from him was enough to make Draco tense up. He hadn’t even been able to tell Potter directly about where to meet him that evening, choosing instead to send him a note during Transfiguration telling him the time and the place.
The first tinge of anxiety had only just begun to set in when he heard Potter moan, a quiet sound that Draco felt like a jolt of heat straight to his core. He repeated the action that had provoked the noise – pressing the tip of his tongue against the underside of Potter’s cock as he pulled back, catching slightly on the head – and was immediately rewarded with another groan. It was restrained, as if Potter was trying to hold the sound back and hadn’t quite succeeded, but it was more than enough to ease Draco’s concern. Despite his inexperience, Potter seemed to be enjoying it.
Pansy sat up, tossing her magazine aside. “Come on, would you really have preferred that I make a big deal about it?”
Shaking slightly, he pulled himself out of the bath, modesty forgotten as he grabbed at his clothes, not bothering to dry off as he threw them on as fast as he could. He tried not to glance back to where Potter still stood in the bath, utterly silent, perhaps from shock, perhaps from something worse, something like disappointment.
When he pulled back, Potter chased after him, tilting his head to deepen the kiss. The first brush of their tongues was unlike anything Draco had ever felt, his whole body alight with it. He was sure that kissing had never been like this before, not even close. If it had been, maybe he would have kissed more people. This was addictive, headier than firewhiskey and the burn far more pleasant, a searing heat low in his stomach that seemed to grow in intensity the tighter that Potter gripped him.
“Now, I know it’s not much time, but I’ll need to submit your names and a brief explanation of the subject of your project by next week. Do you think you can come up with an idea by then of what kind of potion you’d like to develop?”
But Madam Pomfrey put up a fight, and it was only after making both him and Pansy swear that he would return the minute he felt anything amiss that she officially released him, although she was still shaking her head as she left him to change.
“I think it best that you leave now, Mr. Potter.” Although she didn’t so much as look at the Gryffindor when she spoke, her tone left no room for debate. Draco felt a stab of disappointment.
“Don’t you dare go writing to her behind my back,” he warned, knowing all too well what she was considering. When Pansy didn’t answer, he continued to glare at her until she finally gave a sigh of resignation.
“Sure,” Draco said, smirking, and he could see how Potter’s eyes flickered down to his lips, just briefly. “Or maybe you were just looking for an excuse to press me up against a wall.”
Something tapped softly against the side of Draco’s ankle, nearly making him jump. He glanced under the desk, spotting a folded piece of parchment wriggling by his foot like a small animal. He looked over to where his friends were sitting to his left, making a quick assessment. Pansy appeared to be half-asleep, and Blaise, inexplicably, seemed like he might actually be paying attention to what the teacher was saying; Goyle, Draco knew, could never have managed to successfully charm a note to walk itself over to someone.
Draco was nervous; he had been nervous ever since he first made the suggestion two days ago. But now as he left the common room, the anxiety seemed to increase with every step he took. Somewhere around the fourth floor, he began to feel like he might be sick. By the time he reached the fifth, the nerves had almost gotten the better of him, and he might have contemplated just turning around and forgetting the whole thing had Potter not already spotted him.
He didn’t move, even as he felt the burn of Potter’s fingers like a brand against him. He didn’t move as Potter traced one of the long, thin lines of scar across Draco’s chest and down towards his ribs, his touch featherlight, uncertain. He didn’t move as those fingers brushed over his sternum, unable to tear his gaze away from the sight of Potter’s tan skin against the pallor of his own. As Potter followed the diagonal lines of scar tissue, Draco followed the curve of Potter’s hand, captivated by the bitten fingernails and calloused palm and heat, heat,
” The word echoed off the marble walls, too loud. “You know nothing about my relationship with my family.” Draco kicked off his shoes and socks, perhaps a bit more aggressively than he usually would. One skidded dangerously close to the edge of the bath, barely an inch away from toppling into the water. “Don’t pretend you do.”
“Yeah, alright.” He pretended to be very interested in his quill, avoiding Potter’s eyes. “That could be useful.”
you echoing around them; he was staring at a pair of pale, elegant hands, busy stirring a potion; he was on the cold floor of a bathroom, horribly vulnerable, looking up into the mirror where grey eyes watched him; he was sprinting across the Great Hall towards a fallen figure, shoving students out of his way; he was in the hospital wing, leaning over a bed.
“I thought you two might be interested in submitting. It’s fairly competitive, I’ll tell you now, but you’re two of the brightest Potions students Hogwarts has, and I think you have a good chance.”
Draco paused in his writing to look across the table at Potter, who was staring at him with his brow furrowed. Not for the first time, Draco wondered just how thick Potter could really be.
Despite the dismissal, Draco didn’t move, too taken aback by the sheer preposterousness of Potter’s statement. “My
The voices were quite annoying. How dare they interrupt him when he was so pleasantly occupied? Slowly, Draco blinked his eyes open, struggling in his drowsy state to try and make sense of his surroundings. The long, high-ceilinged room was lined with narrow beds dressed in clean white sheets, all of which were empty except for the one Draco currently occupied. Even with the late afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows, the place had a cold, sterile feeling about it.
“You—” Whatever Potter had intended to say, Draco would never know. The words faded into a drawn-out groan as Draco leaned back in, flicking out his tongue to taste the wetness at the tip of Potter’s cock. He kept the motions shallow, licking and sucking at the head to give his throat a break before he wrapped his lips around him fully once more, surprised by how much he liked the weight of Potter on his tongue. He found a comfortable rhythm much more quickly this time, searching for the patterns that drew the greatest reactions from Potter. He wanted to hear him moan; wanted to feel him come.
“Yes,” he replied. “Sometimes. When I was younger, I wanted to be a professional Quidditch player. I loved competing. But now…” He shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it would be the same. I still fly, though. I don’t think I could ever stop flying.”
That green was the colour of excellence, Draco reminded himself. It was Slytherin’s own colour, the colour of generations of purebloods, which Draco had always been told made him special, almost like royalty. He should be proud of that colour.
“I, um—” Potter cleared his throat. Draco followed the movement of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed with an unusual fascination. “Yeah, I’ll do it. Okay.”
Draco winced as he rolled up the leg of his trousers. The skin underneath was raw and red, and it was beginning to blister in places. Draco had expected as much; the potion had been just below boiling when it spilled. But as he looked closer, any thought to the pain disappeared.
As Draco fled, another thought came to him, along with a sick, hopeless coil of dismay that crowded in amongst all the other emotions tangled in his chest: the potion had not worked. After everything, they were right back where they started.
Pansy rolled her eyes, tossing the fork aside with a clatter. “You hardly ate anything,” she said, eyeing his discarded pie. “And you look…” She glanced him over critically, one eyebrow arched. “Thin."
All of that disgusting honesty, and Potter was still going to say no. The prat couldn’t even bother to make up a reason.
“At least this one’s not thirty years old,” Draco reasoned, begrudgingly nibbling at a piece of toast. “Do you remember when your mum was dead set on that one?”
from his dresser and wrapping himself in his newly purpled covers, Draco settled in for a long, sleepless night. He wasn’t foolish enough to believe that merely changing the colour of a few fabrics would be enough to keep the nightmares away, but at least now he could stop thinking about that bloody green-eyed git.
Potter ran a nervous hand through his hair. “I, er…” He glanced at Pansy. “I wanted to know when you thought we should get back to work on the potion. If you, er, still wanted to, that is.”
doing me favours. I don’t get it.” He raked his hands back through his hair, a rare gesture for him given how fussy he was about his appearance. “I don’t get
The door creaked as it opened, Potter following close behind him. The apothecary’s owner had never been particularly fussed about the maintenance of the shop, and while in any other circumstance that might have bothered Draco, who was generally a stickler for order and cleanliness, he couldn’t deny the place had a certain charm.
The change wasn’t dramatic, or instantaneous. Time went on as it had before, the days filled with a repeating pattern of classes, studying, potion experiments, and hidden kisses. And somewhere in the routine of it all, there were small moments in which the difference could be felt.
At Pansy’s response, Draco looked up. She was chewing her lip and fiddling with the strap of her bookbag, staring off in the distance as if deep in thought. Draco’s eyes narrowed.
“Mr. Potter, I should remind you, is a skilled potion-maker himself,” Slughorn added, as if reading Draco’s thoughts. “I do believe that together you could have created something great. But I will not force him into participating if he’s unwilling. I should hope you won’t either.”
More than that, though, he missed having Potter around while he worked. There had been something pleasant about Potter’s presence that Draco couldn’t quite put his finger on, something almost comforting. They weren’t friends yet, exactly, but Draco had begun to believe that with enough time maybe they could be. But with each new day that passed without a word between them, Draco grew more and more worried that he had lost that chance for good.
?” he repeated in disbelief. “Your idea of a nice coming out moment involved the phrase ‘yeah, no shit’?”
“Well, before you were hexed, I sort of got the impression you wanted to talk to me, or yell at me, or something.” A small smiled played on Potter’s lips. “You weren’t going to attack me, were you? I would hate to think I lied to Professor McGonagall.”
Much as he didn’t want to admit it, Potter wasn’t so bad as he had always thought. And if Draco were being honest with himself, he was almost looking forward to spending the afternoon with the Gryffindor. Confusing and awkward as their interactions were, something about Potter made him excited in a way he had not been in a very long time.
Potter acted as if he could not hear them. His gaze had not wavered from Draco’s face. “Yeah, alright,” he answered, interrupting his friends’ bickering.
Draco could not help the triumph in his voice as he held up the synthetic skin, now flawlessly healed. “I told you it was working!”
Yet, there were moments — when their eyes met, or their fingers interlocked, or their heartbeats matched in the same rhythm — where he couldn’t help but think that they both felt it, something inexplicably
Nevertheless, he approached Slughorn’s desk with apprehension, keeping his eyes fixed forward even as he felt Potter step up beside him, unpleasantly close to his side.
Draco sat back on his bed, spreading his hands against the green silk of his duvet. Someone—Blaise, probably—had changed everything back to its original colour. “We just talked,” he answered. “I… sort of needed his help with something.”
Unfortunately, that feeling hadn’t lasted long. The snide remarks he had ignored on the train began to multiply somewhere around the Great Hall, becoming louder and more conspicuous by the minute. He couldn’t decide what was worse: the blatant shouts from the other tables or the bitter whispers from his fellow Slytherins. Hated by some for his allegiance in the war, despised by others for not being loyal enough, and always, always criticized for his lenient sentencing — there was no direction to turn that didn’t meet with hostility and loathing. It was enough to turn anyone off their food, really.
or anything, it was just… well, I sort of helped Cedric on the first task, and he was returning the favour, giving me a hint. The clue in the egg was actually a song, but it was in Mermish, which is why it sounded like screeching unless—”
He just needed more time. More time to figure out their potion; more time to figure out how he felt. Until then, Draco was doing his best to keep their increasingly complicated relationship — was it even a relationship? a friendship? something less definable? — a secret. The number of times he caught himself staring at Potter while lost in thought was perhaps not anywhere within the realm of plausibly platonic, but overall, he’d thought he was doing a pretty good job. Despite the risks they sometimes took, no one seemed to suspect anything was going on between them, least of all that they were getting each other off in empty classrooms.
Draco hadn’t expected Potter to join him. After the usual Halloween feast, one of the Gryffindors had brought out a couple bottles of firewhisky back in the common room. When Draco had slipped away, too wary of the combined weight of his classmates’ dislike and too distracted thinking about the potion to join in the revelry, Potter had been busy laughing with his friends, face flushed with alcohol. Draco hadn’t wanted to take him away from that. He had thought that he’d just work alone for a little while, test out a few more recipes until the chaos in the common room calmed.
“Draco?” Pansy whispered, clutching his hand so tightly that even with the petrification, Draco could feel the sharp sting of her nails digging into his skin. Her voice and the grounding touch were enough to bring him back to the present.
Maybe Potter was just trying to move forward, and Draco was the one clinging to the past. Maybe it was okay for things with Potter to change; everything else in his life had, so why not this?
With one last deep breath, he shoved down the uneasy flutter in his stomach and headed over to where Potter was waiting for him just past the statue of Boris the Bewildered. Oddly enough, Potter looked almost as nervous as Draco felt; he couldn’t seem to stop running his hand over his hair, as if caught in some futile quest to smooth it down. The characteristic gesture nearly made Draco smile, but he quickly suppressed the urge.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “Isn’t this what you wanted?” Draco’s eyes widened, already stammering a denial. “Weren’t you complaining about being the only one that had to undress?”
“Merlin, it smells terrible in here,” Potter muttered, eyeing a bizarrely shaped horn just above his head.
That Pansy had known Draco liked men before he himself had even consciously realized it was perhaps not particularly shocking – she was closer than family, in many ways, and it wouldn’t be the first time she seemed to know him better than he knew himself – but it was irritating, nonetheless. “Then why didn’t you say anything?”
“Get some rest, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall advised. “I will inform your Professors of your absence for the next few days.” With a nod towards Pansy and Potter, McGonagall took her leave.
Draco had already anticipated this response. Before sixth year, when some apparent miracle had occurred that catapulted Potter to the top of the class, Potter’s abysmal Potions skills had been a popular subject of derision among the Slytherins.
A slow grin crept across Potter’s face. “That’s a terrible excuse, and you know it. Just admit it, Malfoy, you miss working with me, don’t you?”
“Er, alright, I guess.” Potter looked over at his friends somewhat helplessly as he stood, wand in hand.
Draco’s back was starting to cramp from the awkward way he had to bend over in order to see anything through the gap in the books, but he wasn’t about to move now.
“Due to the exigent circumstances of the last year, we have had to make some adjustments to our classes,” McGonagall was explaining. “Exigent circumstances” was a nice way of putting it; they had hardly received any real education last year under the brutal tutelage of the Carrows, and the battle that destroyed the castle had also cancelled all end-of-year exams.
Draco frowned. Granted, he had never exactly been in a real relationship before, but the idea of staying friends with someone after breaking up seemed just plain ridiculous. “How?”
The realization was enough to spur Draco back into motion. He pulled Potter’s lips roughly against his own, using his hold on Potter’s shirt to move them further away from the desks. He guided them blindly, tripping a bit over his own feet before he felt his back hit the wall, inadvertently biting Potter’s lip as the other stumbled against him. Liking the sensation, Draco did it again, this time a quick, deliberate pressure of his teeth against Potter’s bottom lip before he soothed over the spot with his tongue.
Draco pushed away that line of thought before he let it go any further. It didn’t matter why they broke up, and why should it? Potter’s personal life was of no concern to him.
Finnigan looked between Draco and Potter, eyes narrowed. It looked to Draco like he was considering shoving Potter’s hand aside and ignoring him, but after a moment, Finnigan lowered his wand.
He was still staring across the hall hoping that Potter might look his way when a sharp intake of breath from Pansy drew his attention once more.
The whispered word echoed around them. Potter looked so small sitting there, and suddenly, all Draco could remember was standing over him on the Hogwarts Express at the beginning of their sixth year, the sound of bone crunching under his heel as he broke Potter’s nose and left him to bleed. Even then, much to Draco’s fury at the time, Potter had still seemed strong. But not now. Now, he seemed broken, and somehow that felt so much worse.
“Isn’t it obvious?” More fabric was tossed aside, although Draco didn’t dare look around to see what it was. “I’m joining you. It’s only fair, right?”
“Not enough, apparently, because if you’ll look at the picture she’s attached…” Pansy plucked the small, butter-stained photograph out from where it had fallen onto a platter of toast, holding it out to Draco in the same way she might offer someone a particularly revolting insect. “She’s expanded her search to include Durmstrang students now.”
Draco frowned, immediately searching out Potter’s dark head a row over, unsurprised to find a pair of green eyes already watching him. Perhaps it was just habit, too many years of antagonism conditioning him, or perhaps it was some other self-defence instinct that drove him, but Draco didn’t hesitate before crumpling the note in his fist, scowling at Potter before he looked away.
.” The knot of anxiety that had twisted Draco’s stomach since Potter first entered the room began to fade a little as he spoke, settling into a topic he felt more comfortable with. “They have the same general purpose, but some work better for certain injuries or for certain people than others. This one, for example—” he indicated the potion in the cauldron, “—is thought to be more effective on scars resulting from dark creature injuries. It’s perhaps one of the most advanced in the field, so I’ve been toying with the formula. Using it while it's warm seems to help with the efficacy, but as far I know, it’s still not powerful or sophisticated enough to safely eliminate the traces that dark magic leaves in the skin, so it can’t ever fully heal those kinds of scars.”
The silence seemed heavier in the smaller space, tension pressing against every corner. Draco leaned back against the nearest desk, his hands clutching the edge. Potter, perhaps realizing it would be a mistake to come any closer, maintained the deliberate distance that Draco had placed between them.
He didn’t know if Potter replied; he wasn’t listening anymore. A wild idea was buzzing in his head, loud and insistent and outrageous enough to drown out all else, even his annoyance at Pansy.
This seemed like a particularly odd question to Draco, and he wasn’t so sure she was talking about potion-making anymore. But Potter seemed to understand her, whatever she meant. The lingering confusion had cleared from his expression, his eyes now intent as he stared back at Pansy.
It was ridiculous to even consider it, absolute lunacy. But some wild urge drove him, and, forgetting his injuries, he attempted to use both of his arms to support himself as he moved to close the distance between them. Draco could almost feel the heat of Potter’s breath on his lips when his left arm collapsed under him, and he cried out as he fell back against the bed, pain lancing through his ribs.
“To be fair, you were the one who woke me up in the first place,” Draco pointed out. “You’re quite shrill.”
Potter, it would seem, was not satisfied with this answer. “That’s not it,” he said, shaking his head. “You hate me, Malfoy. You wouldn’t come asking me for help if it were just about the prestige.”
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He thought that perhaps Pansy expected him to tell Potter to leave, or demand to know why he was there, but something made Draco hesitate. Both Potter and Pansy were staring at him, waiting, but Draco’s mind was whirling. He hardly knew why he was in the Hospital Wing in the first place, let alone why Potter might be sitting at his bedside; it was too much to take in at once, and he could hardly decide which question to ask first. Not to mention, the pain in his ribs was killing him. “Erm, what—?”
“I still think you should’ve just gone with Theo Nott. He’s a bit of a tosser but at least you’d have nice-looking children.” Blaise began to serve himself toast, throwing a few slices onto Draco’s empty plate as he did.
Briefly, he worried that it was going to be all too obvious that this was his first time. He wasn’t sure if he was doing it right, and he didn’t know if Potter would tell him if he wasn’t. It had seemed intuitive enough, the way to move, the pressure to use, but it wasn’t quite as simple as he might’ve hoped. He tried to pace himself, but it was hard to remember to continue to breathe, harder still to try not to choke.
Potter nodded. He was looking at Draco with that unfathomable expression again, the one that made Draco want to pull his hair out and Charm all of his possessions purple.
The heat of the bath felt suffocating. Or maybe it was the heat inside him, pressing against his lungs to the point of pain. He could see the movement of Potter’s throat as he swallowed, and the way his eyelashes fluttered as he leaned in. He was so close now, close enough to see every detail, even through the steam rising off the water in a shimmering haze, clouding the room, clouding their judgement. Everything around them was misted shades of marble and gilt, the water soaking them in tones of crumbling ash, but the colour that Potter kissed him was entirely green.
Draco stood, reaching for the collar of his jumper. “Of course it’s safe. You saw before, it didn’t hurt the synthetic skin at all. And I tested a bit on my hand earlier, it’s completely harmless.” Potter didn’t reply, but Draco could tell he wasn’t convinced. He sighed. “If you’re really so worried…” He gestured at the water with a dismissive wave. “See for yourself, test it on your wrist or something.”
Potter blinked, shaking his head as if to clear his thoughts. “No... no it wasn't that.” He smiled then, laughing a bit. “It was because of Moaning Myrtle, actually. That time I came here in fourth year, she, uh, decided to join me. Didn’t seem to understand why I might not want her there.”
’s first edition of the new year. However, Slughorn had requested that they show him an initial version of their potion towards the beginning of November, so that he could review their work and make suggestions for improvement, if necessary. With Halloween already fast approaching, their days were quickly running out.
Gripping Potter’s hips, Draco reversed their positions with one quick motion, pressing Potter’s back against the wall. He was unsure about so many things in his life, about who he was and about what his future held. Doubt was a constant companion for him.
Back outside the shop, Draco hesitated. They had come to Hogsmeade for the specific purpose of visiting the apothecary –
Draco reached across the divide between them, grabbing the front of Potter’s robes and pulling him forward. He wasn’t ready for words, not just yet, but he could make Potter understand another way. Before he could second-guess himself, Draco brought his free hand up to Potter’s neck, fingers pressing firmly against the warmth of his skin as he used the grip to bring their lips together.
With one last dirty look, Finnigan turned back to his friends, all of whom were watching Draco with wide eyes. Draco could feel Potter’s gaze on him too, but as soon as Finnigan moved away, Draco turned his back. If Potter thought Draco was going to thank him for his intervention, he had another thing coming. Although Potter might have prevented a fight, Draco wasn’t so sure that this outcome was any better. Aside from the fact that he detested being the object of Potter’s ridiculous saviour complex, the last thing he needed was to have more attention on him, and Potter was doing nothing to help the gossip.
Draco shifted his focus to his own bed, determined not to think on it any longer. He rifled through the stacks of neatly folded clothes in his trunk until he found his pyjamas. They were the black silk ones he always wore, his favourites. Yet for some reason as he pulled them on and his gaze landed on the delicate emerald green trim, Draco felt a strange flicker of displeasure.
He was hugging his mother while she cried, telling her everything would be alright, even though he knew it was a lie; he was bringing food to the prisoners in the cellar, careful not to make a sound lest his aunt find out that he had disobeyed; he was on the marble floor of the manor beneath a merciless white hand, the agony of the Cruciatus Curse unbearable, the price of his family’s failure; he was curled up against the cold stone wall of a cell, silence all around him, no longer afraid, only empty, empty—
Draco’s chest constricted painfully as he looked at the space where his friend’s bed should have been. The room felt wrong without it. What was the point of making the new dormitories look familiar when everyone knew that nothing was the same? It was ridiculous, really.
There was still no sign of the owner, or any other employee for that matter, which was something of a relief. It was easier to focus when he didn’t feel like he was being watched. In the past, he might not have given it a second thought, but nowadays, the eyes that followed him were too often filled with disgust and hate. He was also all too conscious of Potter’s presence, of what people would think seeing them together, although it was ultimately unavoidable. They’d have to cross paths with someone at some point, someone who would raise an eyebrow at the pair of them together, maybe worse. But for now, he was content to be left alone, without their every interaction being scrutinized.
Though it was not the same dormitory as his previous years at Hogwarts, it looked remarkably similar. The only difference was that there were three beds now instead of five, absent Theo Nott’s and Vincent Crabbe’s. The first, Draco did not miss. Theo’s father, unlike Draco’s, had been sentenced to life in Azkaban for his crimes. Either Theo didn’t dare to show his face or he didn’t care enough about his education to return to Hogwarts. In either case, it mattered little to Draco; they had never been close friends. But Crabbe…
This chapter ended up being a lot longer than anticipated, but hopefully it's worth it for all the lovely sexual tension!
“It’s fine,” he said with a small smile before turning his attention back to Pansy. “Ron’s not wrong, actually. I’m sure this won’t come as a big surprise, but I really struggled with Potions when Snape was teaching it. I was so miserable in that class that I was just determined to always hate it. But I guess that meant I never really gave it a fair chance as a subject.” He shrugged. “Things are different now, though. There’s no reason to keep hating it anymore.”
Pansy was still staring over towards the fireplace. When she didn’t immediately answer, Draco followed her gaze.
Potter didn’t answer. Unable to handle the weight of the Gryffindor’s stare, Draco pushed himself up from the floor, brushing a few stray bits of Mandrake root off his trousers as he stood.
It was only when he was in the quiet darkness of his dormitory and halfway under the spell of sleep that Draco returned to the stairwell and Potter’s low voice, allowing himself to imagine a different ending to their conversation, one where he hadn’t stepped away.
Upon hearing his own name, Draco could no longer resist. As quietly as he could, he got up and moved over to the bookcase that stood between him and the subjects of his eavesdropping. He briefly considered casting a nonverbal Disillusionment Charm over himself, just in case, but decided against it. Even if he were caught, which he doubted he would be, he had a good enough chance at plausible deniability. It wasn’t as if the Gryffindors had a monopoly on using the library, and he had been there first anyway.
Weasley’s expression turned mutinous. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but before he could Granger grabbed his hand, pulling him towards the door. “We’ll see you at dinner, Harry,” she called over her shoulder, dragging Weasley away even as he cast Draco one last mistrustful glare. Draco watched them leave with a scowl, waiting to ensure they were really gone before returning his attention to Potter, who was watching him expectantly.
Draco watched him hurry out the door, unmoving. He didn’t know what else he had expected, but he couldn’t help feeling a sharp stab of disappointment all the same.
For the second time that evening, Draco found himself asking, voice slightly choked, “What are you doing, Potter?”
“When the curse hit you, it shattered three of your ribs and petrified the surrounding tissue,” Madam Pomfrey explained, gesturing at Draco’s bandaged chest. “I’ve given you a healthy dose of Skele-Gro, which seems to have done most of the work mending your ribs, but the petrified muscle will require a Mandrake draught. Professor Sprout and Professor Slughorn are working on it now, but you’ll likely be here for another day or so until it’s ready.”
Draco closed his eyes, overcome with his own foolishness. For a moment, he had dared to forget who he was, and how everyone saw him. He had dared to believe that his skill and intelligence were all that mattered, had dared to hope that possibilities like these were still open to him. Slughorn was right; it was obvious, so painfully obvious that Draco hated himself for not seeing it.
Potter, squashed between his many friends on one of the sofas, glanced around when he heard Draco’s name. Draco forced himself not to look over.
They fixed their clothes quickly enough after that, cleaning the mess with a simple spell. Draco gathered his bookbag in silence, much more aware now of the sounds from the hallway. He wouldn’t have known what to say even if he wanted to, and for once, Potter didn’t press. Reality seeped back in between them, the icy edges of it pushing them apart, and for an instant Draco couldn’t help but wonder if they had ever really closed the distance at all.
Potter crossed the room to where Pansy and Draco stood. “I ran into Slughorn at dinner,” he explained, bending down to pick up the books that Draco had dropped. “He told me that he finished the Mandrake draught earlier this afternoon and had just left it with Madam Pomfrey. I figured that meant you were probably being discharged about now.”
, I might still have a hope of being accepted into the St. Mungo’s Healer Training Program.” This cost Draco something to admit; he had given up on his silly childhood ambition the day he took the Mark, back when he thought he would die before he’d ever finish school. Saying it out loud now, when it was still a near-impossible dream, sounded foolish even to his own ears. “Satisfied?”
“Fine.” He had no idea how Potter knew that he was trained in Occlumency, but the Gryffindor must be vastly overestimating his own abilities if he imagined this idiotic tactic was going to work. Potter could try as hard as he wanted to force his way into Draco’s mind and prise out his thoughts; it didn’t matter. Draco had faced far worse opponents without breaking.
They both spoke at the same time, words clashing. Potter laughed a little, gesturing for Draco to go first.
Just as he suspected, he found Potter waiting for him outside of the classroom. Without a word, Draco turned and headed to a small alcove down the hall where they stood less of a chance of being overheard, knowing Potter would follow.
Potter, on the other hand, was looking resolutely down at his hands, avoiding meeting anyone’s gaze. Unfortunately for him, the stares of his classmates were all too telling.
The corner of Draco’s mouth quirked, his expression almost fond. “Myrtle’s never had a great grasp on the concept of privacy.”
you?” Draco didn’t even know why he was shocked. Who would have dared to say no to the great Harry Potter’s face, only weeks after he had defeated the Dark Lord and ended what most had believed to be an un-winnable war?
He jerked his hand away as if burned, water splashing between them as he concealed his arm once more. But Potter had already seen, he was sure of it. Rationally, of course, he knew that Potter was aware of his Mark. It wasn’t exactly a secret, not to him or anyone else at the school. But Draco couldn’t help the visceral shame he felt; the knowledge of how despicable it was – of how despicable
They could hear more students in the hall now, laughter echoing. Objectively, Draco knew that they must be nearby, perhaps just outside the door, but it felt like they were a world away. Right then, the only thing that mattered was the warmth of Potter’s breath on his lips and the firm grip of his hand, bringing Draco closer and closer to the edge.
“Sorry to keep you boys from your lunch,” Slughorn said, his chair groaning in protest as he sat. “This won’t take long. I only wanted to make you aware of an opportunity open to our N.E.W.T.-level students. I take it you both read
It was all exceedingly normal. Still a bit awkward, sure, but Draco was starting to think that maybe that was just him. Sitting alone in the Potions classroom with Potter that evening, it was difficult not to let his thoughts stray. Even the most innocuous exchange left Draco’s mouth a little dry, remembering the roughness in Potter’s voice when he’d said Draco’s name, just before he came.
Draco had never done anything like this before, but he found that, somehow, he wasn’t nervous. For perhaps the first time, he relished having Potter’s eyes on him, his own nerves settling under the weight of the other’s gaze. He was curious, more than anything, when he leaned forward and pressed his mouth against Potter, the taste of cotton and something muskier against his tongue. He only lingered for a moment, just long enough to decide that he liked the feeling, and more than that, that he liked the way Potter responded to it.
“Shouldn’t you be taking it easy for a while?” Potter asked, glancing at the only recently unpetrified side of Draco’s chest. Pansy snickered.
Draco thought back, trying to understand how on earth the tournament related to the Prefects’ Bathroom, but nothing came to mind. “Care to elaborate, Potter?”
Draco felt he was going to be sick. He was out of options; there was only one thing left to do, his very last resort. When he spoke, all he could see was green.
Peeking through a narrow gap between two books, he managed to glimpse the heads of the two Gryffindor boys and the bushy hair of the Granger girl, who was busy examining a series of leather–bound tomes on the opposite shelf.
by the brightest minds in potion-making was impossible to resist. Even if it meant having to put up with Potter as a partner, he could not let this chance slip through his fingers. But would Potter feel the same?
“Well, that’s too bad,” Potter replied smoothly. “I suppose I should go tell Slughorn, then, that I’ve decided not to participate after all.” He smiled even as Draco’s face twisted with fury. He had Draco now, and he knew it.
After a few minutes of struggling, Potter spoke up. “Let me help,” he offered, reaching out a hand to adjust Draco’s pillows.
Though it was still mid-afternoon, the heavy clouds made it seem much later, all traces of sunlight obscured. The breeze from earlier had died down and the air felt weighted in its stillness, charged in the almost electric sort of way it always did just before a storm.
Slughorn looked thrilled. “Wonderful!” He clapped his hands together. “And you, Harry, what do you say?”
Potter’s face was calm, but his irises blazed, emotions glittering like sparks. He would be so very easy to read.
, that told him he was no one, nothing — quieted, pushed far enough away that for a few hours, he could pretend he didn’t hear them at all.
Draco could feel that both Pansy and Potter were staring at him, but he did not look away from the Headmistress.
Potter’s hand began to move, startling Draco. He knew that this was much too risky to continue; they hadn’t even locked the door when they’d come into the classroom. They needed to end this now, before anyone else wandered in. It was foolish to keep going, and yet when he met Potter’s eyes, he could not seem to summon the words to stop him.
Now thoroughly confused, Draco glanced down at his necktie, expecting to see the customary green and silver stripes of the Slytherin uniform. Except, his tie was not green. It was purple, the exact shade that he had charmed half his room last night. He felt heat begin to rise in his cheeks.
“Seeing as Mr. Potter was the first to rush to your aid,” McGonagall looked over at the Gryffindor, who was picking at his nails, “I think I can presume that was not the case.”
“Alright, tomorrow, then,” Draco answered. Sensing Pansy’s imperious gaze, he begrudgingly added, “And we will
Refusing to back down from Potter’s aggressive observation, he stared back stubbornly across the hall. He would not cower, not to the likes of Potter. But as the seconds dragged by, Draco grew more and more unnerved. Why wasn’t Potter turning away? He had suffered many unpleasant looks that evening, but for reasons Draco could not explain, Potter’s gaze made his stomach twist more than any other.
The mattress dipped under Pansy’s weight, her arm coming to wrap around him as she curled into his side.
was the kind of honour he’d only ever dreamt of; obviously this was an opportunity he could not pass up. And yet...
He clung to the memory, replaying it in his mind over and over again, so that when sleep finally found him, it continued even into his dreams.
Only months ago, “appropriate punishment” would have meant the Cruciatus Curse, administered either by the Carrows themselves or by a student under duress. A student like him, threatened with his own torture and that of his family. Bile rose in his throat as he remembered standing over a boy of no more than fourteen—perhaps even a third year Hufflepuff like Miranda McKinnon—and raising his wand, hand shaking as Amycus Carrow hissed in his ear all the things that could happen to Draco’s mother if he didn’t obey. He remembered the screams.
Slughorn sighed, setting the quill back down. “Mr. Malfoy,” he seemed to be choosing his words carefully, “Though you may have been cleared of all charges at your trial and granted significant clemency in your return to Hogwarts, I cannot pretend that any submission attached to your name alone would make it very far.”
Draco wanted to say something, anything, to alleviate the stiff discomfort that seemed to have crept back between them overnight. But what could he say? Even as they turned in the description of their project and the details of their preliminary experiments to Professor Slughorn, Potter held himself at an exaggerated distance, unusually rigid in his posture and stubborn in his forward-facing gaze, studiously avoiding Draco’s frequent glances. His cursory pleasantries sounded brittle, to the point that even Slughorn seemed to notice something was off, and he was out the door of the classroom before Draco could even try to stop him.
“Merlin’s pants, Potter, is this the Inquisition? Do you plan to burn me at the stake if I answer wrong?”
“It might even be our best so far.” The cheerfulness in Potter’s tone was baffling. If the potion reacted that poorly with healthy skin tissue, it had almost no promise on scar tissue, but somehow Potter still seemed to view it as a success. Draco had never allowed himself to indulge in that kind of foolish optimism, and yet somehow, at Potter’s words, he felt his spirits lifting. Relative to their previous tests, Potter did have a point: maybe this attempt wasn’t ideal, but it also wasn’t nearly as bad as many of the others.
“I think we should add Wormwood Essence.” Potter lifted his head. His eyes were glazed, as if Draco had pulled him out of a reverie. “No more than four drops.”
Also, just a quick note - I haven't added a separate tag for disordered eating because in Draco's case his lack of appetite is a symptom of PTSD. That being said, it's something that will continue to be referenced in future chapters much in the same way it has been already. I wanted to mention it just in case it's triggering for anyone, and if anyone feels strongly that it should be tagged separately please let me know!
“Good, I think.” Draco didn’t want to get Potter’s hopes up too high, or his own for that matter, but he couldn’t keep the eagerness from his movements as he reached for one of the pieces of synthetic skin he had already prepared, very nearly knocking over the bottle of Murtlap tentacles in his haste. He was more careful as he applied a small amount of potion along the line of artificial scar tissue bisecting the piece of skin, watching with bated breath as it smoked slightly upon contact. A few seconds passed, and then the scar slowly began to smooth, fading until not a single trace of it remained.
He pushed down the wave of nausea that had almost threatened to overcome him, looking at McGonagall with a steady gaze as he said, “I don’t want her to be punished. The McKinnon girl, I mean. It was just a mistake.”
Draco was barely listening. As soon as he unfolded the paper, he knew what she was talking about. It was on the second page, in the top left corner. The headline read,
In his dreams, furious curses turned to desperate pleas, ones that Potter answered all too willingly.
Pansy plopped down next to him, kicking off her shoes and curling her feet up beneath her. “Alright, explain. And don’t leave out the details.”
“Even then—” Draco cut in “—we wouldn’t be able to use synthetic skin, because even the very best synthetic skin still doesn’t store or process magic the same way that a human body does. Even if you did use some sort of dark spell or managed to get a dark creature to bite a piece of it, it might make a scar, sure, but it wouldn’t be fundamentally the same as a comparable scar on a living person. There’s no way around it, really. Testing on ourselves is the only option we have.” It all seemed very simple to Draco, but seeing Potter’s reluctance, he pressed, “We know the potion is safe to use, so what’s the problem?”
“Because I’m a good friend,” she answered with a shrug, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “What was I supposed to do, inform you of your own sexuality? I wanted to let you have, you know, a nice coming out moment or whatever. I wasn’t about to force you into something you weren’t ready for.”
They spent the rest of the lesson in near silence as the students struggled with the dual challenge of nonverbal magic and concurrent charm casting. When the bell finally rang, there was a collective sigh of relief.
Potter looked up at him, startled, then glanced down at where Draco’s fingers encircled his wrist. Draco quickly let go, bothered by the slight contact, even though less than a week ago he’d been touching Potter in far less innocent places.
Draco knew better than to try and avoid Potter. They shared half their classes, not to mention a common room, and they still had a potion to finish. Avoidance was a short-lived strategy at best. Still—
Draco frowned, leaning over the skin to examine it more closely. It had been easy enough to create a facsimile of a scar using a silver knife and a simple healing spell. It was the kind of wound that even the most basic scar-healing solution could vanish in an instant, nothing at all like the scars caused by dark magic that they ultimately wanted to heal, but it was better to start simple. If the potion failed at this stage, then there was no point in testing it on anything more complex.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath. The stairwell seemed much smaller all of a sudden, and much warmer. They were still standing just a hair too close, and maybe he was going mad but Draco was pretty sure Potter wasn’t talking about Pansy. The thought gave him a thrill that was somewhere between excitement and panic. His thoughts were beginning to race too fast for him to control, and his heightened awareness of their proximity—
“Mr. Potter?” Draco could see the way Potter tensed at Professor Hayward’s question before he raised his head to look at her. “Do you have experience with Occlumency? Or Legilimency, perhaps?”
“Your scars.” The water rippled around them as Potter stopped just in front of Draco’s knees. Draco gripped the edge of the seat beneath him, bracing himself, although for what exactly he couldn’t say. “The ones we’re testing the potion on, they’re… they’re from…”
At that moment, by some cosmic stroke of bad luck that Draco could only imagine was karma, Potter glanced at the shelves beside him, exactly where Draco was peering between the stacks. As quickly as he could, Draco ducked down, holding his breath to keep quiet. But even as he crouched on the floor, heart hammering in his ears, he felt certain that Potter had seen him. He glanced towards the table he had abandoned, wondering if it was too late to make a quiet dash back to his books and pretend that he hadn’t been eavesdropping when Potter and Weasley inevitably came to investigate. It was only a few yards away, maybe…
Draco didn’t have to strain this time to hear Potter’s response. “It’s all of them!” He had never heard Potter snap at his friends like that. Seeming to remember where he was and the lurking threat of Madam Pince, Potter dropped his voice as he added, “Just… leave it, okay?”
Comprehension finally dawned in Potter’s eyes. “Slughorn thinks that if we do it together, they’ll accept your submission.” It was more of a statement than a question, but Draco gave a tight nod.
Draco let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. McGonagall had started speaking, but it took Draco another long moment before he could focus on what she was saying. That infuriating green stare had gotten under his skin, a particular talent of Potter’s.
There was something in the teasing way that Potter spoke, a subtle suggestiveness almost, that Draco didn’t care to think too much about. He could only hope that the flush on his cheeks had not begun to creep down the back of his neck, where Potter would surely notice it. “I thought you didn’t want to test the potion on yourself. I thought you were
“You’re a wizard, Potter,” he said. The eaves overhead didn’t quite meet, and cold rain fell through the gap, forming a thin curtain between them, blurring Potter’s features. But even still, Draco could see the green of his eyes. “There are spells for that, you know.”
“What are you grinning about?” Draco snapped. “Even that little Hufflepuff girl thought I was going to curse you!”
There was a moment in which Pansy and Potter just looked at each other, indifferent to the other three watching them. Then Pansy gave a small nod, seemingly having made up her mind about something. “Good,” was her only response, the tension that had built in the air dissipating as she went back to reviewing her Charms notes.
“Malfoy.” Draco had never liked the sound of his own name so much. But Potter’s fingers were more deliberate now, trying to guide him back. “Malfoy, I’m—I’m going to come.”
Draco drew back the curtain. With Madam Pomfrey gone, there was no need for privacy; Pansy had seen him in various stages of undress too many times to count.
He thought then of another green, a truly abhorrent colour: the green of a pair of eyes behind rounded glasses, the same ones that had fixated on him from across the Great Hall.
“All these potions, and none of them do anything?” he asked, waving a hand at the vials on the table.
“What are you looking at, Potter?” he spat, leaping at the chance to try and discover why the messy-haired idiot couldn’t seem to leave him alone. “Not got enough attention already? Hoping I’ll bow at your feet, like everyone else?” His voice rang out through the stone hallway, drawing everyone’s attention.
“He can’t tonight,” Pansy interjected, stepping forward to place a protective hand on Draco’s arm. “He still needs to eat dinner, and he promised Madam Pomfrey he’d spend the night resting.”
“No,” Draco answered automatically, forcing his expression into a practiced neutrality. “No, everything’s fine.”
