He’s able to lose Hermione in the crowd of students, and soon he reaches the empty corridors, climbing up to the Astronomy Tower.

And thus, every week, they met again and again. They had dinner, they had dessert, they played board games and listened to the Wireless.
On Friday evening, Harry is relaxing with all the other Slytherin students who are not doing homework tonight, preparing more cards and games for tomorrow. Meanwhile Draco is, as usual, marking again.
“Did you sleep well?” Harry asks.
Bartholomew snorts. “As if we
Blaise keeps an attentive countenance as the words spill from the three third years. After making sure that they can complete the spells satisfactorily, he brings them to Slytherin to start on their new lounge-conservatory.
Potter startles at the sound of his name. “What do you mean?”
: Hey, you didn't want these students anyway ┐(￣∀￣)┌
: Very gap moe 🤭
Harry shakes his head. “You know that if I don’t go, Hermione’ll come to Slytherin instead.”
Flitwick quickly explains what’s to happen, and Sprout agrees.

Clothes don’t transform with the person. To save clothes, the students have to strip before the transformation occurs. Draco casts a heavy warming charm around the area, so that Nolan isn’t cold as he takes off his clothes. Draco also turns around as the moon rises.
“A silencing charm?”
That evening, many major papers released a special issue all about the removal of Slytherin from Hogwarts. Rumours say that the vote was unanimous! Rumours say that all Slytherin students will be expelled! Rumours say that the Slytherin dungeons will be destroyed!

“I’m sure the Weasleys will still adore you, Potter.”
Dennis Creevey sits in class, barely listening to the Professor up front. He wants to leave, he wants to find Harry and get him out of Slytherin. Harry’s a good guy! Dennis didn’t mean to hurt him, it wasn’t his fault...but McGonagall and Flitwick gave him detention anyway.

“Hey, Harry, where were you? I was calling you,” Ron says.
“But, Mr Malfoy…” Michelle says tentatively. “What would happen to us?”
Creevey sucks in a sharp pained breath. “You don’t understand!” His eyes redden, a glistening gathering at the corners. “That wasn’t meant to happen…”
Hermione, who had the (mis)fortune to work with him again, spotted the ring early.
Alyss is a good student—all the first years are, regardless of their blood status. They’re attentive and active during the tutoring sessions that some of the seventh years hold. There aren’t any tests for the first years today, and even if there were, they wouldn’t act like this.
“It would blow your mind,” Draco drawled. “Potter, come here.”
Both of them look at each other.
Unlike Blaise’s serene countenance, Draco is more alert, especially with all the unknown people on Hogwarts grounds.
A little smile grows on Harry's face when Draco casts a cleaning spell on both of them.
Nolan tilts his chin up at his ‘father’ who is drawing his wand. “No father is better than an arsehole like you!”
Draco mutters, “Pans, why are you being so maudlin for. It doesn’t suit you.” He cringes when Pansy’s grip

The Ministry End-of-War Anniversary event is in the evening. Plenty of time for Draco to lube Harry up beforehand.
With one last shove, Draco draws his hands back, crossing his arms and blocking the doorway to the rooms. “Listening to
In the Slytherin Commons, Harry holds the paper and shows it to Draco. “What do you think?”
Harry grins. “I knew I won you over. Welcome to the Harry Potter fan club.” He takes the badge and pins it immediately on his Weasley jumper.

Draco pulls a disgruntled expression, but it’s hard to hold facing Potter’s smile—a smile that’s directed at
Actually, seeing Draco mark things all the time has majorly put Harry off being a professor. He used to think that professors tortured students by setting long assignments, but now he realises they must be torturing
Malfoy’s eyes sparked. In an odd tone, he asked, “Next time?”
Ron freezes. “Erm. Ah. As long as you take a bite first…”
Potter’s lips quirk up. “Fancy,” he says, sitting next to him.
“I already know,” Pansy says. “But what I want to know is
“This...counts as sex, doesn’t it?” Harry says, a sleepy edge to his voice. He doesn’t know what he was so embarrassed about before. He feels good and Draco feels good too.
and weren’t quite ready for anything yet. That seventh year where he had none and his body started undergoing puberty. The eighth year when Madame Pomfrey got him started on the transition potions properly.
“As long as you’re careful.”
“And while werewolves are now stipulated to be registered by the Ministry, weredragons are not. Correct?”
When Draco wakes up the next morning, he brushes back Harry’s hair with his fingers. He can feel that Harry’s magic has settled back overnight.
Of course his words are true. And of course he would prefer it if he could gather his enemies to one place and set fire to them. Unfortunately, he has the moral obligation to help these children grow up better than himself.
“I’m not kicking you out.” Malfoy’s face is shadowed. “If you leave Slytherin, then it will be due to your own initiative.”
“Now, come on, baby boy,” Draco said sternly.
Draco acts like he’s fully focused on his food. Harry can’t help by dart glances at Draco; and Draco in fact is doing the same, only he is a tiny bit more subtle about it.
Hermione’s lips purse. “That’s true. If those Aegis members really wanted to help, they would join the Aurors. Oh! Harry, have you figured out what you want to do?”
“Well, Harry, you know I love you regardless,” Luna says.
Potter rolls his eyes. “Don’t stare at me so much then.”

“HARRY! And Malfoy!” Hagrid stomps into the clearing, with Luna Lovegood by his side. Hagrid smiles widely as he looks between Draco and the thestrals and Harry. “I knew there was some good in you, Malfoy!”
“—And your son has been earning a lot of royalties just by existing,” Mr Parkinson says jokingly. “All those dragon toys, who made them so popular? Not to mention the charmed devices available on commission.”

“Rather than a bite from another weredragon, Mr Malfoy had been infused with some blood concoction to achieve the same effect. As such, he is not covered under the Ministry’s mandatory animagus registration laws, nor the Ministry’s mandatory werewolf registration laws,” Pomfrey says.
Narcissa has been trying to improve Draco’s reputation with that second article...but the first one is going to have the much greater negative impact.

“...Fine,” Potter grumbles. His body appears, silvery material pooling in hands under the dim light. “But like, what the fuck. How did you know?” There’s a pout in Potter’s tone.
Draco gets up early to see the few Slytherins who are heading home for their Winter Break. He hands them two new protective badges. He also pats the thestrals pulling the carriages.
Harry grits his teeth. “Right. That bastard.”

Draco hung back with his colleagues though. Unspeakables were a natural isolated bunch...and Harry was busy with his friends.

But that doesn’t mean he falls asleep.
For the burgeoning Astronomy Tower, Draco collaborates with Flitwick to build a spell that allows one to see the stars through the clouds that often cover the Scottish skies. They also cast another spell on the viewing devices that allows one to see the stars during the daytime.

Draco’s hand itched to rub Harry’s hair, but he restrained himself.

Draco pauses. “You

Since the start of his joint apprenticeship in charms and potions, Draco has been staying with Harry in Grimmauld Place in London.
It was a rare Saturday that Harry and Draco could spend together. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry when he saw the frown on Harry’s face. “What is it?”
With a wordless spell, Draco
At exactly 5:55 pm, there was a knock on the front door. Harry leapt to his feet and hurried to open it.
“What are you
It was addicting.
Hermione’s eyes widen, taking in the scene. “Move, move!” she shouts.
To the awe of the students, the block of stone floats over the Hogwarts site, aligning itself right at the center. The magic is so thick that it is visible to everyone present, pearlescent and glowing.
Harry blinks up at him. His green eyes are wide, pupils blow, the blush constant. “Please, daddy, fuck me, fuck me hard.”
Draco strokes Harry’s back. “Comfortable?” He pulls Harry’s glasses off, setting them to the side.
Outside, Blaise and Pansy are looking towards Hogwarts castle. In the distance, the Slytherins are hurrying towards them.

“I don’t know, that sounds better than having Mrs Weasley ask me why I broke up with Ginny, and seeing George without Fred.”
In the late afternoon, Robards and another Auror trudge wearily to Hogwarts. McGonagall greets them at the gate.
“Mmm.” Draco’s tone seemed to promise Harry a lot of trouble in the future...
: Pansy is so annoying.
Draco sighs. “A shame it was not Aegis…”

Harry laughs. “Of course, Teds!” He helps Teddy onto one of the swings and pushes him up and up.

“We’re going back to Hogwarts.”
“Hm, hot chocolate and cookies, children can’t resist that,” Draco says, ruffling Harry’s hair. A tingling feeling spreads over Harry’s scalp. He ducks his head.
Granger rolls her eyes. “Yes, yes, I know that you’re good to just your Slytherins. We all know that the problem is me, unable to get comfortable with someone who worked for an anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn terrorist group. Add in sexism and racism coming from muggles and muggleborns and

, too clingy, too cloying. It was then he understood that Harry must have felt the same way. Harry never wanted Draco because Draco wasn’t worth the want.
Draco languidly sits up, face expressionless. Garren wouldn’t dare to argue with Draco in front of so many people.
“Of course, you’re the Headmistress of Hogwarts,” Bartholomew says, his lip curling in distaste. He doesn’t sit down, instead towering over Draco. “I shall begin the recording,” he says, spelling out parchment and quill. “Where were you last Friday night?”
“...Fine.”
“That’s a lovely suggestion,” Flitwick praises Jamie. “Some other students suggested a magnifying front board, so that those seated behind can see.”
“But isn’t it better to have a family name towards the end of the list?”
“Harry!” Molly Weasley wrapped him in a big hug, as she did every week. “How has your week been?”

Harry’s brows drew together. “But...But I was going to make treacle tart.”

Draco grumbles, and that makes Harry grin
The date is chosen such that it's away from the full moon, though over the last few years, werewolves, through various training, have started to gain some control over their transformation the way Draco can control his. And with the introduction of the scholarships and monetary support in honour of Remus Lupin, as paid by Harry, there are now also more Healers and magical academics studying medicine relating to werewolves.
Garren smiles warmly at the students. “It should be laying down the magical foundations.”

And Malfoy (Draco Malfoy) has been seen with Narcissa Malfoy at one (1) charity event. (Malfoy’s hair in the picture doesn’t appear very long, though he looks remarkably like Narcissa Malfoy)

“I was merely taking advantage of an opportunity,” Draco drawls. “Potter needs more help. We’ll reschedule the co-meeting to a later date.”

“Whose fault do you think this is?!”
“Agreeing so easily?”
, he wanted it too. He squirmed, pushing his hips up to deepen the penetration. He moaned when Draco slapped his arse.
Malfoy carefully sliced through his lamb and constructed a biteful on his fork containing all elements before taking a bite. His eyes rested on Harry. “Very delicious.”
Meanwhile, Pansy is telling Draco and Blaise her findings. Neither are surprised.
Pansy nods in agreement. “If we go forward, rest assured that you won’t be any less safe than you are now.”
During the day, while his friends went to proper jobs, he was either sitting in his art room near the top of the house with its large charmed sun-filled windows or writing on the couch in one of his living rooms. Sometimes in the afternoon, he might pick up his friends’ kids if they ended class early, and sometimes in the evening, he had dinner with his friends and their families. Every Sunday, Harry went to the Burrow, which was the noisiest day of his weeks.
? We may have reduced Slytherin numbers since the war,” she says, voice dry, “but you’re not the fourth year you once were.”
“You’re both thinking about it. Go on. Fuck him.”
Draco’s serious expression almost falters at the light happiness of Hogwarts.
“Draco, Draco, Draco.”

With Draco’s sharp hearing, Potter’s breath has quickened.
slightly?!!! More than once, Solicitor Malfoy would cross his arms, such that his ring hand and finger would be in clear display…
Draco wakes up early in the morning, weak light filtering through the Forest canopy. Potter is snoring lightly beside him, his curly black hair poking out from the blankets and resting near Draco’s shoulder.
“Tea?”
“Malfoy, good evening, come in,” Harry said, quickly backing away from the door.
“Yes,” Granger bites back, glaring at Weasley.
with magic more than once,” Harry says. “Me, and many other Slytherins. I don’t think there will be any magical rejection.”
At that, Harry’s eyes widen. “Fuck! Aegis! I forgot about them…”
One of the students hastily hides their wand, but the others don’t care. Some of them dare to sneer at him.
Draco raises a brow. “Why are you complaining? I used
“Good,” the goblin replies, smirking. “You keep an eye on that
Draco immediately heads for Greyback. Harry will deal with some of the others, and Pansy and Blaise from the back.
Harry props an arm on the back of the seat, and twists his body to look directly at Malfoy. “And the goblins seem to like you.”
“Smashing, they love you now,” Draco drawls, lips quirking up. “I’ve become last week’s gossip.”
“If you’re in the Forest and need help, come here to them.”
,” Draco hisses. He can feel his magic now racing down their bond, doing whatever it can to keep Harry alive. Somehow, Harry’s magic has dropped so low that his body has started shutting down, but there’s no physical injury. Something is very, very wrong.
Harry’s body twitches. Draco thunders forward, falling to his knees. He lays a hand on Harry’s chest. Where Harry’s magic should lie is a great emptiness—
Harry tugs her off and heads towards Draco, but Granger jumps up from her seat to follow them out. Weasley looks at them, mouth stuffed full of food, but ultimately doesn’t get up.

Draco immediately relaxes as the bonds between him and the rest of the Slytherins shorten.
Draco beckoned him over. Harry went easily, handing Draco one of the mugs. But instead of drinking, Draco took both mugs and placed them on the coffee table. Then he placed Harry in his lap and peppered kisses over Harry’s face.
Draco’s career meeting with Professor Garren is on Tuesday afternoon, and a few minutes in, he’s already moved from sabotage to contemplating murder.
“Fine.” He hands the plate over and stares at the box a moment longer. “Malfoy…” The moment he touches it, the box opens.
Nolan laughs happily, deciding to ignore Harry. “This is so cool!” The other students watch enviously.
Meanwhile, similar internal changes are also being made to Hufflepuff. The entrance of Hufflepuff is also further widened, with big wooden doors and plants crawling across the wood.
Harry shakes his head, playing unwilling to say.
Harry’s glad that Pansy gave him and Draco a separate room now. With everyday being so busy, the only long stretch of time he gets to have Draco to himself is these eight or so hours during the night—so what if Harry is unconscious for most of it?

“We’ll come back later,” Pansy whispers as she gives him a farewell hug.

On the surface, being in this new Slytherin House has been good for him.
“And yet, here we are,” Draco drawled, reclining back. Harry’s eyes flashed with heat, and it was inevitable for Harry to straddle him and kiss him.
McGonagall looks at him, unamused. “Good day, Mr Malfoy and Ms Parkinson. I look forward to seeing you at the feast tomorrow.”
“What indeed,” Filius says heavily. He’s under no illusion about whether Draco Malfoy will tell him what happened.

The thrusts all increased in intensity. Harry couldn’t hold himself up any longer, collapsing onto Charlie, body limp, a cock sleeve for Draco and Charlie to pump into.
Harry grinned, his eyes sparkling. “Oh yeah? It better be fantastic.”
Draco and Harry sit down on a sofa away from the commotion.
Pomfrey sighs. “Very well, Mr. Malfoy.” She dissipates the privacy charm and opens the curtains. “Get some rest.”
Draco’s heart skips a beat as his fingers itch to touch.
Rose looks hesitantly at Draco. “Was it...that orb?”
“Not a literal dragon?” Charlie joked.
“Shut up, Creevey,” Pansy snaps. “If you really want to help, scram! Fucking

Draco grips Potter’s shoulder. “Listen to me, and you’ll do well in Slytherin.”
It takes Draco a bit of work to tease out Potter’s favourite classes and hobbies. Eventually, Draco is able to write out a list of possible careers for Potter to think more about: ranging from charity work (Draco wrote that, because it would suit hero-Harry-Potter), to teaching (Potter says that Granger suggested it), to baker (on account of Potter’s sweet tooth and Draco refilling Potter’s hot chocolate

“Let's go back,” Draco agrees. The thestrals carry them back to the edge of the Forest, and they fly back the rest of the way.
“You’re teaching them?” Ron makes a face.
Draco reclines on a sofa, watching the students, both Slytherin and non-Slytherin, playing together. The fraction of non-Slytherins is still smaller than Harry would like, but to Draco, it’s already a giant change.
“What happened to the sweet boy who liked getting head pats?”
Potter smiles weakly. “If they did, you’ll have to call me ‘Weasley’ instead of Potter.”

Harry’s arms were firm around his waist. How long had it been since Draco had sustained touch? Draco sucked in a rattling breath. Breathed again, and purposefully moved to the side, loosening Harry’s hold. Purposefully started preparing dinner.
Harry mentally pulled himself from the gutter when he saw Molly and the others spilling out from the Burrow.

Mentally, Harry pats himself on the back for his superb acting. Time for the next question!

“Not everyone is willing to work with us Slytherins, let alone join us.”
Draco liked to joke when he caught Harry looking at him, faint smile on his face. He would wrestle with Harry, and make him laugh. But truthfully, he didn’t mind those moments. It would be hypocritical of him: he had caught himself doing exactly the same.
Robards gnashes his teeth. “You Aurors! Don’t you think we have enough on our hands? If you have so much free time running around like this, I’ll assign you an extra daily shift!! And you! Auror Hitchly, you are now suspended for a week, pending further review!”

Two small Slytherins quickly jump up from the sofas and walk over to them.
Pansy accepts his change of topic, but Draco’s only half listening to her. He can hear the whispers around the Great Hall. Can feel their gazes. He knows they’ll get worse outside the presence of the professors.
Pansy soon returns with the Third Years. With a wry expression, she nudges Nolan forward. “A certain kid didn’t want to return to go to lunch right away.”

“That’s not the main problem!” Harry snaps. “Who goes around setting someone else’s bag on fire?! Malfoy didn’t seem fazed by it, but he’s a fucking prat anyway.”
“Wow, you students must be fans of Slytherin to wait for us every morning,” he tells them. “Do you want an autograph from us?”

Minerva McGonagall gives the Aurors in the office an imperious look that makes them all remember the innate fear of a teacher about to reprimand them.

Fire had rolled in Draco’s stomach. He stormed out of the Manor, seeing red. He transformed, alone, in the Malfoy Grounds, gritting his teeth so he wouldn’t scream.
“I’m sure Mr. Malfoy is capable on his own,” Garren says with a cold smile.
“Francis, I’ll send your parents a letter, telling them that I have forced you to stay back,” Draco says.
McGonagall’s lack of denial is proof. Pansy narrows her eyes.
“Yes.”
On the other side, Draco in silver robes is being led by Lucius Malfoy, followed by his attendants: Pansy and Blaise.
That Friday evening, Draco finds out that the second years skipped potions and walked out of Muggle Studies without telling him beforehand.

Draco makes to pull out, but Harry keeps him locked inside.
“Harry,” Hermione prods him, breaking him of his thoughts. “Are you even practicing? We have tests and assignments due next week, this is important! Don’t tell me you haven’t done them…”
Harry stands there, arms crossed, showing his full displeasure. “Well, Malfoy, did you enjoy your random midnight stroll around the Forbidden Forest?”
Mrs Norris stalks up to Draco and Blaise, sniffing.
“Are you two planning to fight in bed later?” Pansy says in a much too interested tone. “If you marry, you can both share the title.”
Harry’s head tilts down for a moment, his gaze on their touching hands. Draco caresses Harry’s hand with his thumb in encouragement.
Draco’s expression immediately drops. He holds Harry and turns his head to the snickering students. “Is that how you talk to your step father and your step-step father?”
. Aren’t you meant to be smart?”
Draco steps forward. “He doesn’t do it on purpose, Granger.”
“Did you

“I will.”
“Hannah, Neville, Hermione, Ron, we’ll have to ask you to help us,” Blaise says in a measured tone. “The three of us used a lot of magic to keep Slytherin together during the move.”
Draco’s magic runs lightly across Slytherin and Hogwarts. It’s not actually done yet. They still need to make the fine connections between the Slytherin Dorms and the Hogwarts castle, and as part of the new Hogwarts plan, they will be extending the Slytherin dorms up a few more floors, so that they’ll have one floor at natural ground floor height.
Potter grins. “You know us too well!”
As they’re arguing, a house-elf apparates in with a crack.
Jamie’s eyes sparkle. “Mr Malfoy is going to show us his dragon transformation! It’s not fair that some of the Slytherins have seen it and others haven’t,” he adds ‘sneakily’.
Draco stares. His heart thunders in his chest. “I...this…” He turns wide eyes to Blaise, to Pansy, to Jamie, and Harry and Felicity and Aster and—and—

There’s a slightly grey pallor to Aster’s pale skin. Draco makes a mental note to drag Aster out into the sun on the weekend.
Σ(°ロ°) It's real?
Harry’s lips turn down. “Still...but...”
Harry’s eyes widen in mild panic. “
Draco has to force out his next words. They’re extremely difficult to say. “I’m sorry.”
Later that night, Harry sits on a familiar-yet-not sofa in the Gryffindor common room, holding his mug of hot chocolate against his lips.
“Young children need to set up good habits!” Draco retorts. He asks one of the seventh years to look out if any of the younger students sneak down again.

“You might die before that happens,” Pansy says, a hint of frustration in her voice.
In the afternoon, Minerva McGonagall calls Richard Garren to her temporary office.
“Handcuff him,” Pansy suggests with a wink.
“Why don’t you go see how Aster is doing?” Draco says.
“...You’re not useless, Potter.”
Draco sighs in exasperation as he summons Potter’s dropped books. “Potter, don’t be so embarrassed,” he drawls. “You’ll see a lot more salacious things in the future.”
Draco hums.

The students look at him expectantly, with Harry and Nolan closest on either side of him.
Harry laughs. “Did you study a whole stack of romance novels, Malfoy?”

Draco’s husky voice made Harry shiver. Harry’s eyes lowered shyly. “Okay.” A teasing hand caressed Draco’s chest, following the lines of his scars.

But then, Flitwick splits everyone into groups.
“Mum?” Harry laughs and runs before Draco can tackle him.

Draco smoothly hands over his wand. Under Hitchly’s prodding, the recent spells casted by the wand comes out. There is absolutely nothing incriminating.
“No, I don’t want to go to the Great Hall.” Harry shakes her off and hurries out.
Draco’s eyes darken a fraction. “Yes. Clearly, none of them harmed myself nor Harry.”
Aster smirks. “Especially green-eyed Potter, right?”

“Okay. Be careful.”

Mary sneers. “I sincerely hope you weren’t helping out Greyback that night,” she continues in a quiet, threatening tone.

At the moment, Felicity comes over. “Hello, would you like to join myself and Pansy? Not suitable for boys.”

The air is cold, whistling past him as he cuts through the air. In the brief moment of exertion, Draco’s circling thoughts fade.

Harry ignores Blaise, slowly descending the stairs instead, wand ready in his other hand. He knows that Draco is quietly following him.
Harry blushed. “That—you—next time, I want to split the bill!”
Jamie’s first reaction is to ignore them.
Draco sweeps his gaze over all the Slytherins gathered. “Thank you to everyone for their magical contribution. But don’t think that it’s a bribe to stay up. Unless you want me to
“Draco!” Harry shouts. “Don’t kill them!
“You love this. You love me,” Draco said domineeringly.
“No.” Draco squeezes Harry’s hand in comfort and glances at Blaise. “It’s time.”
“Yes.” McGonagall describes how she was woken by Hogwarts when it came under attack, and how those Aegis members cast destructive spells to the side of the castle, despite the students standing on the Slytherin balcony.
Draco and Blaise share a look. Blaise heads up to the mezzanine library area, while Draco walks to the central firepit.
“But to keep your magic close to you is a skill in and of itself. It has similarities with occlumency, so Pansy is
Harry proverbially rubs his hands together. Well, Harry’s not surprised. A lot of people like Harry, and clearly it is just as inevitable that Malfoy would like him too.
With lessons now held in the classrooms again, McGonagall has split the classes into two, instead of the previous year-level-wide classes that had been necessary when the professors were also busy rebuilding. Although the classes are split such that there are students from two houses, more often than not, students from various houses will gather together after class to do their homework together and to play: in the library, in the new student lounge rooms that Hogwarts has constructed, on the new playground outside… The school now has so many more spaces that encourage and facilitate cross-House friendships.

Harry’s ears immediately go red as he yanks his hand back, rubbing his palm on his clothes. “In public,
By the time the Wolfsbane is finished, a number of other Slytherin students have arrived to use the Potions laboratory. Sticky Potter won’t hear of remaining to continue practicing his potion, instead following Draco and Aster back to the Slytherin Commons. Aster discreetly sends off tonight’s vials of Wolfsbane (though it’s no secret which Slytherin is a werewolf—disappearing every full moon is rather obvious).
And it is indeed Teddy, trotting out with a card in his hand.

Michelle nods for the three of them. “Yes, sir...Mr. Malfoy? Did you know those Hufflepuffs?”

Pomfrey walks back to the castle. The remaining students turn hesitantly to Draco.
The front entrance opens and Pansy nudges Harry out.
“—I’ll accept your change of topic,” Draco says magnanimously. He packs the chocolate apple cake up and puts it away. He then pushes the ginger treacle tart to the center of the table. There are two spoons on the side: the tart is to share. “Youngest first.”
With the magic of Draco, Harry, Blaise, and Pansy wrapping around the Slytherin Dungeons, the entire set of walls and floors begin to shift.
Malfoy’s expression becomes a touch colder.
Harry nods earnestly. “Yeah, I would.”
And did Harry learn his lesson about annoying people? Not at all, since it has worked out mind-blowingly well with Draco. Literally.

“DRACO!” Harry slapped him on the arm.

Ron eagerly reached out and popped an hors d'oeuvre into his mouth. “What’s Malfoy doing in the kitchen anyway?”

Eventually, they return to the Common room to warm up and change clothes. Not long later, in the early afternoon before the Christmas Feast, Harry disappears. It’s not
Draco knew the exact moment Harry fell asleep: the smallest
He looks out the window, his heart skipping a beat when he realises that it’s already mid-morning.
Draco feels cruel, but he has to reply,
“Draco!” Harry jumps to his feet. “Pansy! You’re back.”
Nolan gasps louder, not to be outdone. “Mr Malfoy, you’re awake!”
Then he imagined Draco’s hand holding it…
McGonagall rubs her temples in defeat. “Your schooling will still continue, of course. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and Hagrid have agreed to teach separate lessons for you, and Professor Vector is willing to provide some of her class notes.”
“What is it?”

“Hermione took me on a date,” Ron says. “The food was very good!”
Mary smiles coldly. “Come back soon. Dinner is just in an hour...”
“Oh.” Harry looks down, mouth twisting. Does that mean he needs to find a diviner?
To be contrary, Draco looks over to the Gryffindork’s table in time to meet Potter’s bright green eyes across the Great Hall. Potter quickly looks away, as does Draco.

Draco’s gaze softened. “That’s a good boy.” His gaze sharpened again when he looked at the panting, post-orgasmic Charlie Weasley.

Harry automatically looks to Malfoy, who’s packing up his books.

She turns to the Ministry officials. “You said you didn’t want Slytherin in Hogwarts. Now, there is no Slytherin in Hogwarts. Happy?”

“I’ll need to question the students next,” Robards says.
Malfoy made a look of approval. “This is very good.”
A hand rubs his head. Harry’s heart immediately goes all soft. It definitely means something! He turns his head to Draco.
“Sometimes, things can be fixed. But the rejection of Slytherin is too strong. It would be better if everyone could start anew.”
Draco privately thinks,
: ...Why is he so cute??? Why???
“What the Dark Lord had
Draco grabs them both in his hand. “Didn’t I tell you that dragons naturally have two cocks?”
“Like how Draco asks if the Slytherins are sleeping well. Like how he stayed back over the Winter Break, because there were other Slytherins who were staying back.”
Draco and Harry sit with their backs against the wall; with a strong unwillingness, Granger and Weasley sit opposite them. Draco makes sure that Harry starts before beginning to eat breakfast himself.
“When?” Ron jumped in. “Harry just told us!”

“That is one. Second point is that not all our enemies are muggle-lovers. Be accurate.”
“ARGG!!” Greyback snarls. “When I get you...oh, you will wish you were dead.” His eyes glint with cold burning light.
It doesn’t make the ruins look any better.
“Heh?” But nonetheless, Harry gets into the cart that Draco points to, and very soon, it’s zipping down the vaults. “Where are we going? Why?”
All the house tables have been truncated in half, in order to create an open space. The typical floating candles have been replaced by jack-o-lanterns, with an array of carved faces, and peculiar music plays in the background (later, one of the Slytherin first years will inform him it’s muggle music). The other students are also dressed up as...
Granger stares, a flush rising to her cheeks. “You’d choose
Harry makes a face. “I know.” He slumps. “Anyway, I was planning to hang out with Hermione and Ron after dinner, we have some Magical Creatures work to do.”

Before the business of the Slytherin separation started, Narcissa was expending a lot of effort trying to arrange a marriage for Draco.

“Maybe I’m getting
Harry slowly wrapped his own arms around Draco in response.
Malfoy’s lips twitch. He sweeps a hand towards the exit. “Now, shall we return to the Great Hall for lunch? Or I can call some house-elves to provide us with a meal here.”
In one school of thought, Draco is highly aware that he should force his Slytherins to attend class. They’re facing a

The next day, Harry was briefly awoken by a kiss when Draco got up, but he soon fell asleep again when Draco petted him.

So instead, Harry’s standing outside Gringotts again. It’s a bit before Malfoy’s previous lunch-time, and Harry’s thinking of taking Malfoy down to Muggle London to a pizza restaurant that seems pretty popular. Pull out Malfoy’s chair, get the bill—
Draco’s lips pressed firmly, and his tongue dominated Harry. A large hand rucked up Harry’s shirt, teasing his skin. Harry shivered at the sensation, unconsciously breaking the kiss.
Draco’s lips unconsciously curve up.
Nolan’s eyes dip. “...Yes, Mr Malfoy.”
“There is hardly anyone willing to do the long calculations necessary for any sort of accuracy,” Draco says. “It is easier to find a diviner instead.”
Draco tilts his chin up. “Are you

“If worse comes to worst, I’ll step forward,” Harry says slowly. “Who's to say that I didn’t polyjuice into you before catching Greyback?”
With a swish and flick, the wrinkles on Harry’s clothes disappear. A grin grows on Harry’s face. “Thanks, mum.”
Minerva looks up, stunned. “I have a conjecture.”

When they return, Draco will have to soak all the temporary wands in a solution that will clear their entire history of usage, and then scatter them.

“They’re not a free pass to ignore your surroundings,” Draco warns them, after explaining the badges’ function. “But if you’re ready, the shield charm can cover you and a friend.”
The exertion burns off the initial rush of energy and helps him settle into big-creature-six-limbs. The flying clears his head, clears the mindless urge to hunt down Aegis, and leaves Draco with a bad taste in his mouth.

Blaise stands up, bored of watching the annoyed shouting of the Ministry team, who have just lost their expected break. He returns to Slytherin House to report back to Pansy.

“It’s definitely not something the rest of us can do easily,” Pansy says. “I just don’t understand how Aegis was able to make so many of them.”
“Why?”
“Yes, hello,” Granger says hesitantly.
“You should change the password, I could slip in any time.”
As they approached the kitchen, Draco emerged. He was wearing an apron with a cute picture of a chubby dragon that Harry had drawn. He came up behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry’s eyes immediately shone as he rested back against Draco’s chest.
“—I can go faster, alone,” Draco says. “I need you to hold down Slytherin.” Not even waiting for Pansy’s protest, Draco runs out.
“Report,” Draco says once they exit.

to tug the dragon out of Harry’s arms and put himself there instead.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Thanks for insulting me, Malfoy.”
Hermione knew that Malfoy had feelings for Harry during school—she had analysed her school years, and in retrospect, it was very obvious and Hermione really didn’t know why she hadn’t seen it earlier.
Harry: …
He’s thinking about how warm it is to spend time with Draco and Pansy and Blaise, and even the annoying Nolan...
McGonagall smiles wryly at both Jamie Ottley’s enthusiasm and his confidence that he will be able to take part in the rebuilding.
He calls a house-elf to deliver him breakfast. It appears on his bedside table, along with a rolled up newspaper.
Oh yeah, I also wrote a short original fic, it’s an omegaverse setting with an A/A pairing~

Harry took out a fresh sheet of paper and wrote his perfectly calm and measured reply.
Draco grumbles. He lets his head fall to the ground and temporarily allows the thestrals to use his tail as an equestrian jumping obstacle. He should just turn back into a human and conjure up
Harry smiled, his eyes brightening. The pride on Harry’s face was clear to someone like Draco Malfoy, who had spent years studying Harry’s expressions.
Harry gives a noncommittal shrug. The Slytherin Commons is more than that; it seems as though it’s changing every day whenever Blaise and Draco convene with Hogwarts and the house-elves. “It grows on you. I’ll see you tomorrow. Seriously, Ron, Hermione, you’re both still my best mates. But I really
“Ah, my, I’m feeling popular today,” the portrait-witch says, half-self-deprecatingly.
Harry grinned. “It should be. Luna has been very kind in teaching me how to make proper tea. I have a reference sheet for different temperatures and time, though I still can’t do a tea ceremony like she can. By the way, she’s my literary agent.”
“That—you didn’t
—there are no such
Inside, there are several early risers already awake, either studying or having breakfast. Draco decides to get some work done. Harry dithers, but eventually decides to accompany him. They both smile shyly at each other as they take a seat at the same table in the mezzanine library.
Students from the other Houses look on in a mixture of envy and disdain at the Slytherins having a ‘party’. But they don’t make any big moves out of fear of the thestrals. They just talk among themselves. They don’t want to believe what McGonagall said.
After Harry finally disappears from view, Draco turns back to Hogwarts castle. In the same way that Malfoy Manor’s heartstone is located in the main hall, the center of Hogwarts is located in the Great Hall.
After ensuring that they know how to activate the badges, Draco cautiously exits Slytherin first. The coast is clear—no sounds, no scents that shouldn’t be there. Draco relaxes and escorts the students up to the Great Hall.
Potter smiles. “Yes. Look at this basket! I need all of you to help me eat me the food inside.”
“Contact the papers. No photos of Harry today are allowed to be printed.”
Potter has a satisfied expression on his face as the other wolves slowly approach. They eat, eyes constantly flickering back to Draco, and they curl up on the enlarged quilt with their heads warily facing him.
: ┐(︶▽︶)┌ If you say so~
, but Harry’s chest fills with emotion.
: The Ministry sucks!! So bad!! Horrible!
: o(>< )o But I
Draco lifted his hand and traced Harry’s cheek. “But we’re doing that now.”
The young thestrals stop messing around and hurry forward in the right direction. Draco pats them and lets them go off to play with the young Slytherins and temporarily adopted young non-Slytherins. The Slytherins show the non-Slytherins how to play.
As Harry tears the silver wrapping, he uncovers a milk chocolate treacle tart filled bar, a slim box containing a handwriting correcting quill, and a charmed badge that flashes:
He knows that will make them even more exposed. It’s not sustainable, and each of the eighth and seventh years will have to work harder. Already, he’s recruited some of the sixth years into escorting the lower years.

Jamie bows his head, chastised. “How did you even know
He reads through the article, and the coldness turns to heat.
Draco’s small finger in Harry’s hole doesn’t feel like much at all.
He was feeling particularly upbeat, since Draco had given him another surprise visit. Well, it was hard to say whether it was a ‘surprise’ anymore since Draco had been over during the late evening or the early morning more and more often. Neither of them said anything, but it felt a lot like Draco was slowly moving into his house.
Harry was able to avoid venturing out to busy wizarding places on account that he didn’t

“Malfoy?” Potter tilts his head, looking up at Draco.
: *dragon side thinking: MUST KEEP (MY) HARRY SAFE*
Harry usually avoided Diagon Alley to the best of his ability, but today, he had promised to help busy-Hermione and go fetch her delicate potions order that absolutely could not be owl-delivered.
(Malfoy’s partial to earl grey and chiffon cakes. Harry’s partial to—he quotes Malfoy—the most sickly sweet desserts.)
“Make it 70% for me, and I’ll allow you to go ahead,” Draco says. “Contract, if you please.”
—which parts into an archway with a rustling of leaves.
“Here,” Harry decides.
Aster exits Transfiguration class with relief. Class hasn’t ended, but Professor McGonagall, who continues to teach Transfiguration, has given permission to Aster and their friend, Mesa Wattle, to briefly visit the Hogwarts Library for some books that will be useful for their current transfiguration project.
“I need to access my vault,” Harry says quickly.
Draco shoots Harry daggers, but his eyes grow warm as he pats Nolan. “Yes, yes, let’s go back for breakfast, okay?”
a Mummy kink.
Draco’s lips curl up in pride.
Blaise drawls, “Why are you complaining, Draco? Pansy is simply taking the initiative for you.”
In the privacy of the Slytherin Common room, Draco finally asks Harry about his meeting.
Unfortunately, both Greyback and Aegis are clearly focused more on South England, than Scotland where Hogwarts lies.
The feeling of hot come worming its way inside of him was too much for Harry. “I’m about to—
“Even if you sacrificed yourself and allowed us to use your lifeblood, it will still not be enough to save Hogwarts,” Draco says, eyes narrowed as though he suspects Harry was planning to do just that.
data fed). The bigger the better! Ideally, we would have f1 = 1.
Sometimes, but not often, Harry used to sleep—just sleep—in Draco’s bed. Short naps, where Draco was just a warm body, a state of sleeping Harry had been used to before he and his latest partner broke up. And some of those times, Harry would hold Draco in his arms, and Draco would pretend that Harry wanted him, instead of missing someone else.
“Just hold,” Draco says gently. “You can do it, Harry. It’s
While Healer Murie hurries away, Charlie Weasley steps to McGonagall’s side.
He never imagined that his mother—who is still under house arrest—would take the initiative to see him first, to the point of going through all the procedures to be able to visit Hogwarts.
Harry walks closely next to him, asking in a lowered voice, “Why aren’t the first years coming? Their first class is on the ground floor…”
The information about Draco’s declaration spread...which students or professors was it? Do those requesting duels have any connections with Aegis? It would certainly be convenient for them to let someone else come in and destroy Malfoy Manor for them.
“Should I go?”
The master bedroom is just as destroyed as the rest of the Manor. Drawers and bookshelves and personal items are strewn across the floor. The walls show damage—as though Aegis were trying to find any hidden compartments or rooms.
Potter pulls a face and shoves Draco lightly. “You git. In fact,
before he strides out of the room.
Draco stares. He definitely thinks Draco is. “I had believed we were going to ignore each other for the entire year.”
Harry grits his teeth and squeezes back. “So, Malfoy,” he says, smiling a grimace. “What brings you to Gringotts?”
“It looks good,” Granger says, eyes darting to Draco.

“That is all. Enjoy your dinner.”

When Draco went to sleep, Nolan, Martin, and Mesa had piled on him, blankets draped over top. They are now back to their human forms, sleeping peacefully.
Draco looks at the pudgy stomach Harry keeps poking, to the soft wings and the big apparently-cute-looking eyes. “The resemblance is lost on me,” he says drily.
“You’re right.”

Complicated expressions abound.
“Harry, House assignments are constructs
“Ah yes, unfinished developments and old council flats. A fantastic view,” Draco said. But then Harry hooked his little finger with Draco’s and Draco could no longer find a complaint.
He snuggles up against Draco.
Harry throws any sense of embarrassment out the window and pumps the two cocks together, squeezing them tightly. Faster, twisting them just how he likes it—
Harry crossed his arms. “This is about
“Because then you would have been branded a werewolf too, I know.” Alice deflates. “Sorry. I should be angry at Mary and not you. People here are good.” She takes her friend into the hubbub to where some of the other third years are, one of them being Sequoia Hawks.
“We’re here to see whether or not he’s a good cook,” Ron said with utmost seriousness. “So yes, I’m hungry.”
Draco’s heart rate picks up. His hands get clammy. He doesn’t want to say it. But it’s the perfect opportunity to do so.
made by Malfoy, these students from the other Houses wonder…
Draco squeezes his butt cheeks, making Harry squirm.
Minister Shacklebolt opens with some preliminary welcomes and opening words, and then moves to the agenda: “It has been two weeks. The Ministry has gathered an impartial team of expert magical theorists to analyse the progress thus far. The rebuilding of Hogwarts is highly sensitive. The foundations must be solid and thorough. Everyone, please do not obstruct their examination.”
the cries of, “
Well, that Greyback’s loss.
“Yes, Headmistress!”
More than one person looked jealously at Draco’s meticulously prepared lunch, with its numerous colours and delicious scents. But they were not allowed to have a taste, and could only suffocatingly go to the Ministry canteen, or outside, for their loveless lunch.
Harry moaned as Draco deepened the kiss. He felt like he was falling, yet his heart seemed to be flying. His entire body slowly melted, kept upright only by Draco’s grace. Soft moans and gasps filled the air as Draco pressed closer and closer. Harry was moved until he was lying down on the sofa, yet Draco only paused for the briefest of moments before capturing Harry’s mouth once more, covering Harry with his body.
‘Fuck, Harry, you feel so fucking good,’ Draco whispers, his lips tilting up in an involuntary smile. ‘You always feel so bloody good in me.’
Potter still wears glasses—Draco wouldn’t know what to do if he stopped wearing glasses—and the eyes behind them are just as intense as they’ve ever been throughout the years in Hogwarts. But every time Draco catches Potter off guard as he looks off to the side, or forgets that he’s in company, something simmers beneath that carefully curated persona. Draco has to hold himself back from shaking him by the shoulders until whatever is out of place snicks back into the familiar order of Potter.
Draco has discovered Firewhisky to be an excellent houseguest.
A year seems longer when it’s broken up into months.
When Draco stirs and curls in on himself slightly with a shiver, Harry heaves a sigh and stoops down to pick him up. Draco is definitely heavier now than he was at eighteen, or even twenty five but years of Auror training have increased Harry’s strength enough to be able to lift Draco with ease.
“Pans,” Draco says, “He’ll understand.”
She shakes her head stubbornly.
His eyes are unreadable behind his sunglasses.
Malfoy looks embarrassed again. “It’s my birthday, Potter,” he scowls, struggling to keep it from morphing into mortification and not quite succeeding. “Be nice.”
“Draco,” says the woman sitting across from him in the chair, “we can’t do this unless you tell me what you want.”
“Wait,” Potter says, his sandpaper-rough voice doing things to Draco he’d rather not think too deeply about.
“No, I did not. Malfoy’s mother is a Black, he has Black blood. The wards and the charms recognise him. I wouldn’t be that idiotic, Harry.” She sounds more exasperated than she has any right to be, bringing Malfoy into his house.
Draco can feel the blush creeping up–
Draco throws his hands up in the air and disappears back into the room, hopefully to put on a shirt. Within seconds, he’s back, a black T-shirt creased at the hem just enough to make him appear artfully tousled. Harry and Parkinson stare at each other awkwardly as Draco does his buttons up.
Harry gets up as quickly as his shaking legs allow and Draco almost drops the cup he’s holding at the sudden movement. He walks over to Draco slowly, giving him the space and the time to back away if he wants to but Draco doesn’t. Instead he stands there, the coffee cup shaking in his unsteady hands, his eyes widening with every step Harry takes towards him.
Granger gives him a pointed once over and he is suddenly aware of the way his breath is shallow, his fists are clenched and his eyes are burning. Talking about Potter fucking always does this to him.
There is a third loose end.
“Don’t be a snide prat with me, Draco. What apology?”
“I’m alright, Lovegood. I appreciate the concern but I assure you, I don’t need it.”
“No one,” he murmurs, looking down at the grain of the wooden dining table. “That’s the whole point. They’re much too lonely.”
When Draco finds the coffee cup and the newspaper, he stubs his toe on the edge of the table in his surprised distraction. Fairly certain that Harry would not poison him, he takes a sip. The taste throws him back seven years when they were still going strong, still so desperately in love, still sleeping in each other’s arms.
“And what do you say?”
Harry kisses like he casts– with effortless ease veiling astounding intensity that yields all the results he wants. Within a few seconds, Draco is losing the last vestiges of his self control, gasping and reaching up to cup Harry’s face in both his hands. Harry’s done his hair up in a topknot with a few strands lose about his face and Draco twirls a finger in the one falling into their eyes and tugs gently. He feels Harry smile against his mouth, and the universe seems to snap into alignment for Draco.
“Tell me how to make it up to you,” he beseeches when they’ve pulled apart finally, simply looking at each other.
“How could I not?”
He looks at her, certain that she has gone completely insane. “I didn’t even bring dress robes, what makes you think I’m
“I didn’t know it scarred.”
“Harry!”
Malfoy men have dragon heartstrings, the voice in Draco’s head that sounds exactly like Lucius tells him when he stares down at his trembling fingers. It is almost six in the evening and Draco has thrown on navy robes and brushed his fingers through his hair. He thought of taking a shower but dismissed the idea as unnecessary and requiring too much effort in the afternoon. He regrets that now, grimacing as his fingers drag through matted, stringy hair. He’s in dire need of a bath, he hasn’t taken one since… he can’t even remember the last time. But the only way to look presentable in company will be to salvage whatever is left of his hair for now and for that he… needs to look in a mirror.
“I asked,” she repeats, frowning, “if you would mind partnering with me.”
Sometimes they happen in places like his tongue, or his heart, or his nail beds– nothing helps then, but they try anyway.
Now Malfoy is beet red. The pink of his cheeks is stretching down, disappearing under the collar of his robes. Harry wonders for a split second just how far that flush stretches before shaking his head at himself in mute horror.
‘Oh yeah?’
door, Malfoy!”
“Then I suggest you get to it.”
Draco sags against the granite countertop and doesn’t resist when Harry cups his face in his hands.
Scorpius had hoped for a last pastry before death– a relished, rich one purchased for him by his fathers from some patisserie in France. He’s never really been spoiled, but there are advantages to both your fathers having excessive gold in their vaults saved up for your future.
“But I did. Open the door and you can see for yourself.”
“I think you’ve had enough,” Blaise says, reaching for the bottle between them, placing it on the floor beside his chair. “That’s your third shot of this shit and your fifth drink since I’ve been here, so either spill why you called me choking on your tears or let me go back home.”
“Which one would I like, do you think?” Draco asks and cringes immediately. It sounds like he’s asking for a book recommendation, or… or… an ice cream order or something.
Really?”
‘I thought,” Harry enunciates, “you didn’t want to see me.”
He looks up to see Potter smiling.
The smile on Harry’s face is feral.
“You know what I mean!” He hisses at her. “You said we were friends!”
Some claimed their marital issues were ruining their work lives.
Now, his lips quirk just a little, crinkles appearing around the corners of his mouth. Draco’s heart aches something fierce.
“We were supposed to be partners at the Academy together,” Ron says. There’s an undercurrent of… something there that Harry can’t quite place.
“I’m sorry,” he says again, and bats away the thought which whispers his father’s disappointed words in his ear.
It’s a selfish thought, but it’s normal at the very least. Jealousy is familiar.
“I’m a Gryffindor, not a self sacrificing lunatic,” Harry says.
Draco looks at him for a moment before smiling softly. “I’m proud of you.”
They pull away after what feels like hours and seconds all at once and Draco stares at Harry, at the green of those eyes, blown a little dark by his dilated pupils, at the kiss swollen curve of his lower lip. His spectacles are a little skewed on his nose and Draco absently fixes the angle of them and only realises what he’s done when Harry’s eyes flutter a little and his expression flickers to one of pleased surprise.
Potter laughs, a low and rich sound, different from the previous evening’s mildly tipsy mirth but thrilling nevertheless. After a few seconds, which is nowhere near enough time for Draco to revel in the overwhelming warmth of it, he cuts himself off. Draco turns to see him standing in the middle of the street looking positively mortified. “Sorry,” he says, eyes wide, lower lip caught between his white teeth. “You told me that and I started laughing, that’s so insensitive—”
He lets his head drop onto Harry’s cold chest and wonders for how long it had been empty.
Harry seems to know this because whatever he does, he doesn’t even touch Draco’s dick. Instead he keeps licking around his arsehole, sometimes with firm hard strokes and sometimes with languid ones with the flat of his tongue.
“You’re
‘I want you to come on my face,’ Harry tells Draco, gripping his rapidly reddening cock by the base. ‘I want to feel your eyes on me and your hands on my chest and your come on my skin.’
“You were saying?”
Draco tuts. “No, Potter. You want some sleep and want me around, you’re getting in and taking a damn shower. You reek. Can I trust you to stand up and not fall over for the ten minutes I will be leaving you alone?”
“Take them off, then,” he says, and Draco’s breath hitches. Undress Harry.
A few more questions about budget and no more mentions of him, and the court is adjourned.
“Can I take this off?” Harry asks, stroking the collar of Draco’s shirt. He’s heard from others how questions make sex boring, how the moment should be too intense for words when it’s right. But this moment right here—Draco cannot imagine one more perfect. The question ruins nothing, merely fuels their desire further. What shame is there in such a blatant expression of desire?
“What did this one do?”
He doesn’t know why Potter is here. Dench didn’t know either. When Draco asked, Dench told him in no uncertain terms that if he was going to look a gift horse in the mouth and ask it to trot off, Dench would ride it and trot off too.
Seeming to sense Draco is serious this time, Harry immediately leans up, looming over Draco. There’s a reassuring look in his eyes that puts Draco’s heart at greater ease than his words, “I do. I wouldn’t hurt you, ever.”
“I am not here to tell you Draco Malfoy is a perfect man. I am not even here to tell you that Draco Malfoy’s scales are balanced. I am simply here to say that a boy my age, a boy I have grown up seeing laughing with his friends in the Great Hall deserves to not be locked up in a place that produced Bellatrix Lestrange, Fenrir Greyback and countless others with gruesome war crimes to their names for the rest of his life. Draco Malfoy deserves a chance to balance the scales because he has proven he is capable of it. He deserves the chance to learn.”
Harry stares.
Voldemort he could say in the darkness of his room at night with the curtains drawn around his bed and the blanket drawn up over his ears.
Draco mentally counts along. He breathes, slow and deep and exaggerated until the fog clears and the fireplace and Granger and the hideously green couch swim back into focus.
Malfoy looks guilty and then briefly annoyed. “They’re
It’s Harry who moves first. He heaves a sigh that echoes through the empty room, raises a hand as though to touch Draco before he thinks better of it. Abruptly, he turns on his heel and stomps away down the corridor, his boots thudding on the wooden floor.
‘I could never, um, ask you for it. So I left it here and thought I’d forget about it.’ He sighs. ‘It’s not like our sex life was ever missing anything so I, um, didn’t even think about it all that much,’ he hastens to clarify.
“I was going for intense but all of those work fairly well too,” Draco says with a smirk. “Lucky me, you know?”
Harry doesn’t know what he’s talking about until he remembers. Malfoy’s letter to him after his testimony. A stiff thank you, a formal apology, a promise to make himself scarce from Harry’s life. He hadn’t been in the most stable frame of mind and the letter is a pile of flaky ashes now. He knows Ron and Hermione received letters too but he has no idea what they had done with them. Whether they had forgiven Malfoy or not.
“You said you were leaving,” Draco says, suddenly uncomfortable and frantically searching for a change in the subject. “Where are you going?”
, shit, Parvati—”
here? Why is he here?
Malfoy nods.
Azkaban is cold.
“I’m trying to gather up the loose ends,” Harry says, sitting on the floor, eyes closed, wedding ring clenched in the palm of his hand. “But there are more than I can count.”
he doesn’t, much too afraid that he’ll cross a line and Harry will walk back out.
He does not want to tell Harry about Voldemort’s time in the Manor. Maybe someday, but the wounds are still fresh and on Draco’s worst days, when nothing makes sense and he misses home, they bleed him dry.
A swishing sound, hisses. Cold floors, dark rooms. Maniacal laughter.
“And you’ve already spoken to three people about it?”
“He’s having an affair,” she blurts out, a few uncomfortable moments into the quietness. “I’m sure of it.”
The Mind Healer cleared Harry to testify a week ago.
There’s no response. When Scorpius looks up, they’re smiling.
Harry might have saved the Wizarding World but Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, the Weasleys, they are reconstructing it. So Harry had raised the bottle of gin in Ron’s direction, as though toasting to what he said and taken a healthy swig of it while staring into the fireplace.
Harry’s cheeks pink up delectably. “Thought we were sticking to first names now,” he mumbles.
She screams awake from nightmares where she’s pleading to Bellatrix to spare her, nightmares where her parents cannot remember who she is no matter what she tries. She has panic attacks when she sees too many galleons because it reminds her of the Geminio curse in the Gringotts vault.
“Malfoy, you–” Weasley breaks off, gathers his thoughts with conscious effort and tries again. “What exactly do you think you need to apologise for?”
looking.
“Well—” begins the man—Barrister Dench, Harry notes—“Testifying for my client is a bit of a risk to one’s reputation as an upstanding man of wizarding society.”
It’s more disconcerting than he’s willing to admit.
Before Draco knows it, he’s reaching out to grip Potter’s wrist before he slips back under his Cloak.
It hurt when he rips the ring off his finger. It hurts even more when he places it on the table.
But it is too late. He’s spiralling already
Now Malfoy looks as though Harry has lost his damn mind and that’s
“You’re safe,” Draco agrees after a moment.
next, this is what it will smell like.
Harry’s blown pupils darken and his teeth come out to sink into the soft flesh of his full lower lip. On anyone else, the act would seem cheaply coy, but Harry does it so instinctively that the ache in Draco’s balls tightens.
He says as much. “You didn’t,” he concludes when Draco doesn’t say anything. “You told me what you needed and I gave it to you.”
“Pardon me if all of us can’t be as crass as you, Potter,” Draco says immediately.
Draco and Harry don’t take turns to sit with Scorpius. He knows that’s what Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron do when Hugo’s autoimmune disease plays up. Aunt Hermione takes a couple of days off, then Uncle Ron. They’re divorced, not dysfunctional.
He sees the way Granger looks wildly between him and Potter, how Ginevra looks up from her heated argument with Finnegan with an indecipherable expression. How Longbottom drops his fork when Potter greets him, how Thomas’ face breaks out in a smile.
Potter had asked. Draco doesn’t think he can bring himself to fully acknowledge just how much he wants to.
By the time he tugs Draco’s T-shirt off his shoulders, Draco’s hands have come up to grip his. “Can I?” he asks, an each of Harry’s words from earlier, reverent and wondering, and Harry gasps his assent. Draco goes faster than he did, undoing the buttons with efficiency, but the moment Harry’s shirt falls away to reveal his chest, Draco’s hands slow their movements to a snail’s pace, exploratory fingers running over the curves of his ribs, the muscles of his abdomen.
“I have little to say in my own defence,” Draco says. His father would not be proud of his honesty. But then again, his father is not in a courtroom full of people who are looking at him with considering eyes, weighing on a balance that will be flipped with a wrong look, a haughty tilt of the head. “But I would like to take this rare opportunity to do something I have never done before, though there has been more than enough reason.”
He clears his throat, trying to ignore the obvious tension.
“Mm,” Harry responds, sucking his spoon into his mouth.
“What happened there, Malfoy?”
Draco is startled into a bitter laugh. “Are you serious?” he asks, when Potter simply stares. "That was… that wasn’t even a sliver of what I deserve.”
There’s a sound and Harry’s making it.
It is soundless and she is barely moving but her entire body is trembling and where her face is pressed against his chest, there is a growing wet spot of tears. Awkwardly he rubs her back, hoping it helps, praying she recovers soon enough to do something about the other two thirds of the trio and so worried about her that he can barely think straight. If a few months ago someone had told him he would have a sobbing Granger cradled against his chest, a stunned Potter and a catatonic Weasley in the same room and he would be more worried about them than his own wellbeing, he would have hexed them hard enough to land them in a different continent. But right now, he can’t help but be grateful that he stepped in when he did.
The day for those discussions draws near fairly soon.
Sometimes when he is inordinately late, Draco is furious, his rage dripping from the angles of his posture– the fierce jut of his hip, the cross of his arms, the tremble of his lips– which makes apprehension set Harry’s synapses into overdrive. Sometimes he is understanding, taking off Harry’s robes with a sigh and a gentle kiss to his forehead before bringing dinner to the couch. Those times Harry feels like a right arse for the lines of worry that are becoming more prominent on Draco’s forehead and the guilt he feels threatens to corrode his principles away.
“That isn’t funny, Malfoy.”
He pulls away–
Potter hesitates. Draco picks up on something he isn’t saying. “Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas’ memories have been submitted. As have Ginevra Weasley’s, from the times Mr Malfoy was summoned to torture members of the underground resistance group within Hogwarts—Dumbledore’s Army.”
“Do you want tea?”
The chill in his bones when Draco had run away.
took the case.
“I thought the memory charms weren’t reversible,” Harry ventures, tentatively. Hermione’s parents in some little village of Australia are living peaceful lives away from Voldemort’s reign of terror and its subsequent fall, completely unaware of the daughter who left them there.
He whistles for Archimedes who comes sweeping in within a few seconds. He must have been out hunting in the backyard. He ties the letter to his leg and sends him off before returning to his task of cleaning out the East Wing bedrooms.
“There are Healer oaths, Malfoy,” Hermione says, not looking at the Mark but instead at his face. “They can’t refuse to treat you. You’ve been acquitted.”
“There isn’t one,” Draco replies and wonders how safe that is.
“Wasn’t he the Minister’s Undersecretary—?”
Draco looks into those earnest, bright green eyes that hold more weight than words ever will and his throat feels dry when he asks, “Yeah?”
She fills the workspace with inane chatter in a low voice while they chop and grind and stir. She talks about the things that happen in the Gryffindor common room, things that are apparently happening in Auror training that Weasley writes to her about, the last interesting book she found in the library.
Death says nothing. It’s a familiar response. When Scorpius looks at them, they appear contemplative.
“Alright,” Potter says, getting up. “I’ll leave you alone.”
Voldemort, Voldemort, Voldemort. He would whisper it, trembling, tears streaming down his face, his heartbeat ricocheting off the walls of his frail, frail body. The name held power, tasting like bile on his tongue, his meagre dinner already in his throat.
She’d looked up, surprised, and tentatively pleased, and the smile that had broken out had been infectious. “Yeah. Yeah, reminds me of the little neighbourhood shop I’d go to every weekend because all my pens ran out of ink too quickly.”
‘Wait here,’ he hears Draco say and wants to snort a reply about how he can’t exactly go anywhere in the state he’s in, but his mouth isn’t cooperating.
“No!” Draco says, eyes wide again. “No, I—I didn’t mean to offend, I didn’t mean to imply you should stay just to save me, I—” He cuts himself off and draws in a deep breath. “I’m learning,” he says eventually. “I’m trying. And I didn’t mean to push you away. I did something I couldn’t forgive myself for and I took it out on you.”
“For?”
Now Draco does look as though someone has slapped him in the face. “Malfoy—?”
His voice is raspy, unrecognisable. It is exactly the way it sounds after the times these thoughts eat at him from the inside, every time he can’t bring himself back to reality. Sometimes it takes hours, sometimes it takes days to achieve true lucidity. Sometimes it feels like hours but only minutes have passed.
“Well, yeah, of course,” Ron says, brow furrowed. “Why wouldn’t it be? You’re as British as it gets, mate. But part of you’s Indian, isn’t it? Even if it’s just the skin for now. Maybe it could be more. You won’t know until you go.”
“That was rude, Potter. If you find it ridiculous, you should just say so– umph!” He shuts up abruptly when Harry almost pounces on him, kissing him breathless. When he pulls away, Harry says softly, “It’s not ridiculous. If I’m being honest, it’s hot. So,” he kisses Draco again, “wonderfully,” again, “hot.”
And waits.
“I’ll ask Ron to send Pig.”
In dreams, Harry is happy, and in life he is not, so Harry measures time in light and darkness and the space between them is filled by relief.
“I didn’t forget, Malfoy.” Her smile had turned positively mischievous. “If you agree, we’ll be each other’s first project.”
“Potter demolished half the house. I haven’t done anything like that.”
“Because they won’t care about this?” Potter asks, gesturing to his own forearm, echoing Draco’s words from earlier in the evening.
“Let me touch you,” he begs, remembering Harry’s instructions to keep his hands under his head during the blowjob. Harry looks up, and their eyes meet in a fierce collision of desire and
Granger’s clearly too stunned to speak so it’s Draco who says, “Yes, sit down, try not to blow everything up and maybe we’ll see about finally getting this Potion done. Granger here has been fucking it up the last three times we tried.”
don’t you?”
He tries to vocalise it, “I wish I could but—it’s just—with the Forest and everything else—I don’t—”
, he thinks defiantly.
“No further questions,” Cosgrove says, taking a step back.
Scorpius shrugs, and chokes out a laugh. “Son of the most famous couple in Wizarding Britain, probably one of the richest blokes– I was supposed to inherit the Potter, Malfoy
There’s an uncomfortable lull. She cracks her knuckles and he taps a Celestina Warbeck tune on the wood of the chair.
“Uh,” Draco begins, feeling slightly incredulous, “Invading his personal space without permission? Kissing him without permission? Continuing it without checking to see if he’s alright? Having no regard whatsoever for consent?”
This is
“Harry,” Hermione says after a moment, “I’m proud of you.”
Harry smiles. ‘Everything. You.’
—he wants to be buried in the soft grey of a graveyard on a winter morning, held in place by Draco’s eyes, bid farewell by the comforting scent of Hermione’s hair and Ron’s coffee.
But on other days, the guilt morphs into frustrated anger laced with learning, still strangling but somewhat sweeter because Potter’s patient explanations wring it out of him. It’s proof that Potter talks to him enough for Draco to now understand what merits guilt and somehow the warm weight of Potter’s regard and unrelenting faith is heavier than the wince of shame as he takes in his inherited surroundings.
“Potter, I swear to Salazar–”
, if you will?”
Harry groans. He hears Ron drop something in the kitchen and Malfoy’s jaw drops. “No,” he says. “Thank you, but I couldn’t possibly–”
‘You still didn’t tell me when,’ Draco reminds him.
They have vaults in France too, but Draco can’t access them yet because his father still hasn’t signed the necessary papers or died for Draco to have unfettered access.
He hates himself for doing this to her,
“What sets you at peace?” Harry asks, because the light in Malfoy’s eyes pleads and flickers with the unspoken desire to be asked, though the question is unclear. He wants to speak, he wants to spill, he wants to stop holding back and Harry doesn’t know how to tread around this minefield of discovery but he tries anyway because this is what he came to do.
That day he went to town to buy groceries for the first time in his life. There had been Muggle money leftover from the pockets of the prisoners, none of the Death Eaters had seen use for it and it had remained in a drawer, locked away in an inconspicuous room of the big house. He had dug it up, taken a breath and come back with food he didn’t know how to cook.
“Where’s your courage, Gryffin-boy?”
“...I lied in my letters,” Draco shamefully admitted. “She was just so

With his words, the uncertainty spreads across the students gathered.
A sourness grows in his heart as some of his ‘fellow’ Gryffindors, one by one, get lured into friendships with the Slytherins.
“It would be better if I talked to each of them separately,” Draco said seriously.
“Draco,” Pansy says, quickly walking up to him. “Some students spotted Potter walking out of the castle, and some of the Quidditch team spotted him by the Forest this afternoon.”
Harry glowed with satisfaction. “He can make desserts! It’s perfect, I make dinner, he makes desserts.
Blaise gives Draco a nod, and he leads them in.

“Ah, darling, don’t think you can escape me,” Narcissa said pointedly. “You used to get along with Astoria Greengrass back at Hogwarts.”
“You!”
The two of them had been friends during their first two years at Hogwarts. Aster had taught them about nonbinary people have always existed amongst wizarding folk, and how they, along with trans magical people, used to be counted on for some of the more complex rituals and questions and as healers for the community. In turn, River Hall had protected Aster against the muggleborn and halfblood arseholes who didn’t think nonbinary people should exist or existed at all.

Another Auror sneers. “They didn’t help us at all!”
Filch sneers. “Mrs Norris? Did you find something banned on the students?”
Blaise prompts himself up on an arm, lips pursed as he examines Draco’s face. “When you healed Draco, did they go back to Jamie?”
