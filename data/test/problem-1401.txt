“You’re sure about that? I can keep them all away for awhile, but a lot of people are worried about you. I’m sure Ron and Hermione will be beating down the door if they have to wait another day. Not to mention our young friend…who at the very least admires you enough to conceal events on your behalf.”
Draco was playing his last card, the tearful breakdown, to good effect. He muttered between sniffles, "I just wanted you to share this with me. All I wanted were special memories to take home, but you won't do anything but what you do at home. It's like I'm here all alone. It's... it's like you don't care about me at all! I try and I try, but..."
The fat man was fresh in from Moscow, fringe of snowy hair curled with expensive oil, nose red from years of good liquor. The woman on his arm was the envy of many, slim and pale, long dark tresses slithering down shoulders like snowy alps, her dress as black and shiny as the crude oil that had made his fortune. The dress was on the floor now and they rolled on the bed of a five star hotel in Brussels, her kittenish giggles almost out of place coming from a woman with such a normally cultured and haughty air about her.
“Harry…I’m sorry…”
“Tease. You can’t wait to get out of here, can you?”
“A lesser man maybe, but a smarter man would have known that I really…really…wanted him to do exactly that.”
We spoke of more than that. Much more. He likes me, boy or girl, dress or slacks. It sounds like an old line, but I think he wants my mind and soul, not just my flesh. Being gorgeous doesn’t hurt my chances, but he really is looking for something more, and I wonder if I can be that to him. He has a restless mind and a passion for living that makes me remember when I was glad just to be alive. It can’t be wrong to want that near me. It just can’t.
“Hmmph. I can guess at the source of your stress. I just saw a very saucy young man walking from here, looking like a cat that just got its fill of cream. You don’t seem to deal well with the notion of being his teacher, do you? Take this, and drink it all. It’ll calm you down a bit without leaving you sluggish.”
Granger’s eyes softened suddenly, and a mixture of guilt and embarrassment flickered across her features.
Bouncing across small waves, shaking like a monkey on a stick, picking up speed as we go. The weirdest and most familiar moment is that second when we go from skipping across waves to genuinely flying. One second we are of the earth, the next we are in flight. You can actually feel the loss of that connection to the earth. Uncanny. Suddenly, it’s not so bad, and I’m curled around Harry, looking out the window at the clean blue lake beneath us. Freight ships on the horizon. Small fishing boats along the coastline. Endless, deep, dark blue water.
“It’s okay. I understand. I’ll be waiting for you…when you come back.”
“I'm sorry! Maybe this was too much. Did you not like it? I didn't...I don't want to be pushy...I just...”
Are they alive? Do they know what their child does? My father wouldn’t admit to having a son that does the things I do. My mother is probably too drunk to care, or too stoned on Valium to remember that she has a son. How would his parents feel about him? Harry Black, the killer that brought home a whore. They look awfully young in the picture…perhaps the age I am now at the most. Probably just a bit younger. Are his parents even alive?
I kick off the high heels I’ve been wearing. My feet hurt, and I realize that I just lived through seven years of wearing flats! I’m out of practice, but I’ll get it all back. Then it’s time to lose the skirt and top, and it’s only a few more scraps of cloth before I’m stark naked. More champagne. The mirror is huge. More like a wall than a mirror. The boy in the mirror isn’t eighteen, and that comes as a shock.
“I know, love. It hurts…and I understand. You have to wake up. Let the wards down, Harry. There are people who love you out there. You need their help. If you love me, you’ll know what I’d want you to do. Let them help you, Harry. I…I love you.”
“You need to eat. You’ve been in here for almost five days, Draco. People are worried. I wanted to see if I could help.”
These were the things that Harry had learned to live with after Draco had lured him into a web of sexual gratification and exploration. Explorations that only stopped when Draco had achieved his penultimate goal…creating in Harry a lust to give himself to Draco as a bottom.
Draco cut him off before any more misconceptions took root. “Would you…for me…oh, bugger all! This is coming out all wrong. Harry, would you be my first? I can’t know what it was like from your side until I’ve tried it, but I know if it’s with you, then it just can’t be bad. Would you?”
And slides it across the desk to me.
He can be stunningly violent, and he’s good at it in a way that makes the rest of these people look like the dumb brutes that they really are, but under that lurks a gentleman, who doesn’t seem to have any desire to hurt the weak…specifically me. I can’t help but appreciate that. I’m sure you can see why.
For those who aren’t in the know, gelato is what happens when you go to make ice cream, and ignore everything that isn’t delicious. All that’s left is pure goodness. After gelato, ice cream is permanently passé. I hope Doc Snape is happy! This isn’t just raining on my parade…it’s shitting in my sherbet! Grrr!
Remus sipped his latte slowly, still not sure if getting anything with caffeine was the hottest of ideas. Dora seemed like she was in a fairly good mood, and even though it was an unusual place to meet, at least for Remus, the atmosphere was cordial enough.
Slim hips rose off of Harry, and Draco closed his eyes while he pressed back against the stiffened length behind him. Poised for entrance, Draco hung just above it, brow wrinkled in concentration while apprehension overtook him.
“Mr. White and I are very close. I didn’t mention it before, because the others were around, and this isn’t really for their ears, and I can’t name names without the white noise generator on. When my godfather, Sirius Black, was killed, he was working for Mr. White, the way I do now. My father’s job was more like security analysis, and his best friend was Sirius Black. They were both early employees of the Phoenix Corporation. When Sirius died, I was fifteen. I inherited both estates, but I was just a kid. There was no one to take care of me. Mr. White was the one who made all the arrangements. He took care of me when no one else was left.
“Let us divide the duel into three parts. It is only my opinion, but I think that almost all of you might have acquitted yourself well during the first portion of the duel, had any of you been in my shoes and well prepared. A fair number of you might have done well even into the second part of that duel, owing largely to speed of response and calm while casting and responding. Good shields are of course essential. The last third…was different from anything you have seen…for a reason. To duel at that level, you must be fighting for your life, even if it isn’t genuinely on the line. You must treat every spell as an attempt to end your life, or you will surely slip and let one overwhelm you or otherwise rattle your nerves.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------
“Bloody hell!”
“You shit! You absolute shit! You’re holding out on me and you know it! Spill! What’s your secret?!”
{*You will not harm him! GO! Back where you came from! Harm no one in this place!*}
Draco looked up when Harry’s mouth slid away from him, wondering what was interrupting an otherwise amazing blow job, and realized that Harry was quite suddenly crouched above Draco’s waist, with one hand still holding Draco’s erection steady beneath Harry’s waiting body.
He was almost delirious himself, and couldn’t recall when he’d come, but the milky evidence of it was there, streaming down the sides of his waist, and dripping from the head of his own half erect prick. All Harry knew was that he felt magnificent and alive again, after weeks of feeling like his was a living death, and he knew he’d made the right choice.
“Have fun. Don’t…you know…drown…or capsize…or anything like that, okay?”
Draco floundered, unsure and silent. He obviously hadn’t thought out what he wanted to say. Harry turned to leave, sighing in disappointment.
The young man was muttering despondently to himself still when Harry hesitantly touched his shoulder. Grey eyes, rimmed with red and still wet, snapped upwards when Harry’s fingertips made contact. The question in them was hung between pleading and defiance, and Harry winced inside, hating the little echoes of another time and another person that bedeviled him then, but he still got the words out calmly.
Pansy’s in rare form today. We’ve been bedeviling the younger years for our own amusement all day. One of those ordinary lazy Sundays in the Common Room, lounging indolently and enjoying our primacy. With Blaise and Nott firmly in the camp of allies, and Crabbe and Goyle effectively on the payroll as my henchmen, there’s not a person to be found who can bother us for more than a heartbeat…and then they pay dearly for it.
As the day ended and Harry made ready for bed, Ron stepped into their room looking refreshed and content, as well as damp. Harry eyed him suspiciously, wondering what the ginger goof had done to deal with the heat. Everyone else was making do with pathetic Cooling Charms that only lasted an hour or so at most, and then left one instantly sweltering as soon as they wore off. Harry usually woke up and used the spell every two hours. Now that he thought about it, Ron had slept pretty soundly the last few nights, and only seemed to suffer during the worst heat of the day.
“I see a few weeks on the continent hasn’t changed you a bit. Any noteworthy events from your travels? Just so you know, I’m not refusing the idea of new furniture or changing the topic, but we can get back to it later.”
At the head of the table, he glanced at the man beside him, not a murderer or broken by regret, confident, literate and gentle, the husband and fellow father that had marked the last two decades of his life as memorable for their excellence, and Draco leaned toward Harry's ear.
“Mmm-hmm.”
“He joined the Nazi party and returned to the continent before the war took hold. He was a scientist and an economist without peer. He was very high among their ranks when the war ended. I engineered his capture, attended his trial, and testified against him. He was hanged for crimes against humanity, and for participation in genocide.”
TBC!!!
“C’mon. Let’s roll!”
“It’s alright…Drake. Perfectly normal response in a most abnormal situation. You may not realize it, but that really has very little to do with why you’re here. Be frank with me, if you can, because I mean to be frank with you.”
Chapter 34: Something Amiss
In the silence of the night, burrowed into the crook of his arm where I can properly rest, we chat sleepily of things that randomly cross our minds. We really are still getting to know each other. So many tiny mysteries…waiting to unravel. We are close…closer than either of us have ever been to another, but it’s been so fast that we still have to learn the little details. The things I ask him fill those tiny blanks in my mental image of him.
His musings had been working their way toward this conclusion ever since the year began, and his little ‘arrangement’ with Malfoy was at the core of it.
“Books. I studied books. Hermione helped me get them.”
“Aw, c'mon, Harry! You look like you've seen a ghost!”
”I’m not saying that your apology is unaccepted…but…why now? Why here?”
“Oh…uh…it’s nothing. Really, love.”
Draco smiled like a cat and sat down on the bench lazily. He leaned back comfortably and spread his legs, sliding his hand toward his groin and the rapidly growing cock that dangled there.
“How! How can you say that! Say those…things! I LOVE YOU! I’ve never loved anyone like this! ONLY YOU! How…”
Harry takes up Malfoy's implied offer from the night before, and thinks he's ready to handle it.
It came out more of a muted croak than Harry had meant, and Malfoy’s only acknowledgement was to roll closer and flop an arm over Harry’s chest. Draco’s face was now about an inch from Harry’s, and the man was mumbling in his sleep.
The Echoes Of Yesterday…by Samayel
“Draco. Please.”
He stood in the alley, thumbing the switch in his pocket. If he tripped it here, the blast would cover him in rubble from the wall. He only remained near out of a desire to know what became of his enemies. Not that it was personal, but he preferred the jobs where he could be closer to the target. He could work this way when asked to, eliminating targets in a haze of smoke and falling rubble, but it wasn’t nearly as interesting as seeing their eyes when they died. He’d never liked bombs, but the irony was that he was a skillful hand with them…and in a way, a bomb had brought him to this lifestyle.
“Whew! So it’s like that is it?” Ron looked a bit pale after Harry’s confession. “What can I say, mate? If he makes you feel that way, there’s nothing else for it. I can give Malfoy a break if you promise you won’t be a stranger here, but if he hurts you in any way, Filch will be cleaning up what’s left of him for weeks!”
Not that he was upset by this. He wasn't unhappy...just full of uncertainty. Draco was...well...a lot to handle. He'd landed in their midst in a desperate bid to save his life, prodded by his own mother to get as far from Voldemort's camp as possible. Lucius and Narcissa had discreetly agreed that at least one Malfoy should be on each side of the conflict, and Draco had been their 'safety'...a third party they could ally with the Order and use as evidence of their compliance with Voldemort out of fear. The gesture had reaped them certain benefits after the war when the dust had settled and all were brought to account. The Malfoys were still wealthy and still in possession of their titles and lands, unlike certain other families that had lent their support to the Dark Lord. Everyone had kind of expected that victory and peace would have signaled Draco's return to the Malfoy estate. Inexplicably to all, Draco had lingered around Grimmauld Place...and Harry...long after it was necessary.
“What for? I go where I please…but if someone asked politely I might consider it.”
I don’t want to watch the news anymore. It makes my stomach lurch when I think of all the scrutiny that Harry will be avoiding when he goes out again. They’ll all be looking over their shoulder for someone, and it won’t be so easy next time. Harry’s good. Ron said so…and I saw him in action in prison. But no one…no one is perfect.
I lost my temper, and what I said was unkindly. You have my apologies. I hope you’ll at least trust me that they are sincere. What I expect from you is this: whether you accept my apology or not, you should ask my permission to enter my quarters when that circumstance arrives. If I say no, you will be expected to conduct yourself like an adult, and accept that choice. If I say yes, then you may come in and feel welcome. Depending on the circumstance, I may say yes, or no, for any number of reasons, and because we’re speaking of my living quarters, those reasons don’t need to be explained to anyone else. That choice is mine to make. You may speak now, but try to be civil if you can. It reduces people’s respect for you when you fall back upon insults and sarcasm in lieu of actual communication. I should know…because I lapse occasionally myself. Alright?”
"I don't know. I'm sorry for the outburst. I didn't mean to worry you. I have…I have things to see to this morning before classes. Please forgive me. I promise that I'm fine."
“Then give it here, Ferret-face! I’ve got a hangover from hell and I wanted coffee…that’s why I brewed it, and you’re drinking it all up while you bitch about it. Give it here!”
Draco simmered a moment, then realized he’d just been complimented.
The Curse (Part 4 of 7) by Samayel
Every muscle in Harry’s body tensed at the mention of wanking. He couldn’t believe Malfoy had just announced that he wanked, in here, every night, at ten o’ clock! What the hell would motivate Draco to tell Harry anything so presumably personal?
Draco sat in perfect silence for a moment, eyes downcast and heart heavy. He'd opened doors he'd rather have kept closed just to get this far...and some of the time he'd kidded himself about what he was after, what he desired from all this, but he wasn't kidding anyone any more. Certainly not Granger, who couldn't have been brought into this based on falsehoods. He couldn't even afford to deceive himself, because a false footing on this path meant failure, and he wasn't a great fan of failure...in fact, if forced to choose between failure and honesty, he'd take the honesty. He put the cup down and looked up.
“Oh. Alright then. I…I think I can deal with that. I’m not very hungry, though. Are those éclairs?” Harry suppressed another smile.
Draco groaned piteously. His voice was oddly hoarse when he whispered back. "Please...I...I wanna come. I can come again...I'm sure of it. Lemme..."
One of those damnable fingers had gently worked just a first knuckle’s worth of its way inside of him, and the faint, wet friction was making Draco absolutely crazy. Harry’s mouth pulled away for a second, and a hand gently nudged a leg a little further upward. When the spongy heat of Harry’s tongue was added to the motion of that finger, Draco gasped and tensed sharply.
Draco looked at the squat little house on the other end of the busy street, squinting with concentration. It took considerable talent to pierce the veil of illusions and wards that ringed and guarded it so carefully. It wasn't a place that invited being found, and the resident had made sure that anyone not intended to see it would pass it by without a second thought.
Draco raised the pace again a mere minute later, battering that wonderful spot inside Harry with amazing precision. Harry had opened himself utterly, reducing the friction, craving further faster contact between Draco’s cock and the place inside that needed its attention. Little lights burst in Harry’s vision, and he almost slipped into a happy, numb, trance-like state, only aware of the pleasure that thrummed through his body in waves, until a mounting and uncontrollable urge to come pulled him sharply back to reality.
It had also been three years since either he or Draco had had more than two alcoholic beverages in a single session. A glass of wine with dinner, a champagne toast here or there, a cold beer on a warm day or with close friends. That was the limit...and it was hard to want to drink when life seemed rich and full. His friends were constantly coming and going, regulars against all odds at the Manor that had once housed a family greatly feared by wizards everywhere. Now it was the social center of the Wizarding world, a hub of activity and friendship.
“Hello, Harry. Come on through if you’d like. I’ve nothing but a bit of paperwork to keep me company right now, and the break would be most welcome.”
“Heyyy…mmm…Blaise is sleeping…and I called for my ride already. I jus…I thought you toe…you two should know…thanks for the great dinner. I’ll see you again soon, ’kay?”
A lot of people may not know this, but I did my homework on this subject. There are two types of orgasms that men can have: the traditional penile one, and the more mysterious and slightly frightening prostate orgasm. There is no happier or more sexually contented creature on earth than a queen who likes to bottom and knows it, and has been blessed with a reasonably sensitive prostate. It’s a two-edged sword at times, since I lost interest in coming the popular way after the first time a date made me come ‘inside’. Masturbation frequently lacks charm anyway, and was out of the question with an audience made up of psychopaths. Nothing quite satisfies the way being pounded through the mattress and headboards does, but at the moment I just don’t care. My fingernails are too long to stimulate myself the way I like, and they get in the way a bit while I try to find a way to get a proper stroke, but I finally find one that does the trick.
“Aside from the fact that it just had a laser scalpel aimed at it for most of the last hour and it‘s still almost completely numb…just peachy…thanks.”
TBC!!!
“Nothing to be sorry for. Happy birthday.”
Harry didn’t really take his eyes off of his work, which at the moment consisted of a table covered by a single enormous blueprint of Blaise Zabini’s home. Exits and entrances had been circled in red ink, and the location of the primary power line and fuse box had been noted as well. Not that a home invasion was being planned as an absolute, but since Drake would be in there, completely surrounded by Zabini and his cronies, Harry had insisted on drafting a complete plan for extracting Drake at the first sign of trouble. Unspoken was the fact that, if it came to that, Harry would have to kill everyone in the house except Drake, just to ensure the absence of any witnesses that could trace involvement to Drake. Harry scribbled notes in the margins of the blueprint before nodding softly.
Harry looks back, after his trysts with Draco, and wonders how he let it things get so far out of hand.
“Shit! I’m sorry! That was out loud? I thought I was just thinking that! I was mentally stuck on the whole twelve hour thing! Sorry! Never mind. More wine?”
---------------------------------------------------------
"Maybe it is pathetic, but when I had to work to keep you from leaving...it was more effort than I've ever put forward for anyone...or anything. Maybe it makes you uncomfortable...but you made me feel things I've never felt before. I felt...good. Contented. Like I had what I wanted and I didn't need anything else. I just...the way I've lived my life...the way we met...I wish I could erase all that, but I can't. Wishing is for idiots...and you've made me that kind of idiot."
I am sorry he read some of the chapters on our time together. They weren't meant to be shared, but he is more like me than I could have guessed. Even so, if I'd known that my teenaged son was going to read through this, I definitely wouldn't have waxed eloquent about what a glorious prick you have or how gifted you were when you put it to work in me! Almost a third of the pages in this thing aren't fit to be read by anyone not properly of age!! For Merlin's sake, there's an entire entry dedicated almost entirely to how much I loved sucking your cock!
Draco stood up, chin set defiantly, eyes blazing.
I use the bottle to massage his neck, taking a short break to throw in some sea salts and set the tub controls to activate the spa jets.
Kingsley slipped back in through the door of the office, a cup of coffee in one hand and a handful of videos in the other.
Draco had been at what Harry considered his best, which meant that he’d been enthusiastic, and almost forceful, when he pushed Harry back against the wall and pressed their groins together while he worked his mouth down Harry’s neck and collar. Harry whimpered when a soft love-bite suddenly turned savage, and the straining erection pressed against his own felt enormous and distinct against his hipbones.
There were things that needed doing first, of course. He needed a formal meeting with Minerva to declare his intentions. He needed to return to teaching his classes long enough to give Ron a break. The poor man was exhausted from keeping a double schedule, even with young Draco as an assistant.
I can’t leave here without knowing. I can’t. If I go, I can’t come back, but if I stay…there’s no way to know what might happen. Killing time is essential to maintaining my sanity. Not that different from prison really, but given a choice, I’d choose this.
“I know.”
My intervention canceled your expulsion, and you should know that, since you’re of age, charges could have been brought by the Ministry, had we be inclined to do so. I don’t think either of those are productive choices. The little I’ve heard from Harry, as well as your other professors, all points toward your exceptional quality as a student. No one would want to see that enormous potential wasted. To be specific, I hope you might come away from this with a better ability to rein in your anger and frustration. That might go a long way toward giving you a better outlook on things, not to mention the ability to stay out of undue trouble in the foreseeable future. Who wouldn’t want that for you?”
The handwriting, well known to him, was what shocked him first, and as he read he knew that his faintest suspicion had been correct, and that somehow, someway, it had come to pass that his child and this letter were inextricably linked, though not in any way he could have imagined.
“Heh. C’mon. You know you’re happy. She’s happy. Why be secretive? No one will think you’re less macho just because you’re in love.”
I must be mad. In this bed I have a partner who, for all their naiveté, is worthy and gentle and warm, and yet I rise in silence and dress, letting him slumber in innocence. I belong here, with him, in the warmth and safety of his arms. Is it pride that drives me so? Is it some unwillingness to abandon the course I set for myself? I surrendered much for this victory. I gave so much of myself, even suffering these doubts and fears, alone with no one to share them. Am I to have nothing for them, no reward at all?
Chapter 18: Irony and Memories
“He’s telling you the truth. I got in just before six, and he was already asleep on my couch. Draco couldn’t have been anywhere near Pansy last night. Now let’s hear where his child is!”
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t done this almost weekly since his second year at Durmstrang. It wasn’t a mystery as to why people did it. It felt good, particularly at the finish, but pain and pleasure were objectifications of the flesh…states of mind that people allowed to control them. It was insipid to say the least…but it did have a draw.
“Harry! Shut up and listen to me closely! Please?”
That’s when he started with a few of the others. The irony was that, as fucking horrible to me as he was, half of Slytherin was jealous of the amount of time he’d spent with me, even if they didn’t know the details. They practically lined up to be used by him, but he never went so far with any of them. I half think he played around with the others just to make sure that I’d see him with other people, and suffer appropriately. We’d never even kissed. I watched him snog other people in public for the last few weeks of school, and I really think he just did it to rub salt in my wounds.
I’ll sleep, and dream, and eat and paint and play and come alone for as long as it takes. Harry will be back, and he’ll make me not-think and just feel, and what he makes me feel is good. I can wait. For him. As long as I have to. Maybe I’ll stumble onto an answer or two while I’m waiting, and maybe…just maybe…I’ll work out what I want to be and what I want to do. But I know what I want to say. I whisper it into a pillow that holds a hint of his scent every night.
I am getting used to it…being alone sometimes. It’s been a week since Harry left. I’ve enjoyed myself for the most part. Sometimes there’s such a thing as too much aloneness. I think I’ve accepted that this is where I live. I’m starting to feel less out of place and more at home. I wish I had things that made it ‘mine’. Like a picture of me and Harry somewhere, so I could have it by the bed. Maybe some mementos of a place we went together. I have ticket stubs from the museums, but they don’t look good on a wall. I have memories, but they only live behind my eyes. I’ll ask him for photos of us when he gets back. It would help a lot…I think.
“That’s because you’re a Slytherin and your mind works in ways much more convoluted than a normal human’s. I still suspect the hand of a Slytherin in the engineering of the London Orbital Motorway.”
Maria loves my outfit, and I’d bet just about anything that Therese wishes she could get away with wearing something like this. They’re headed for bed before I get finished with my makeup, and while I didn’t really mean to, I wind up keeping Ron waiting while I finish my primping before we leave. My ass is already shaking in the bathroom while the satellite radio pipes in some dance music. Poor Ron. He probably hates the music, and I’m pretty sure I have the usual effect on him in this outfit. I’m small and soft and pretty, and his gut instincts cry out, ’It’s sexy…try to fuck it!’ while his brain is shouting, ’God damn it! Cancel that boner! That’s a boy!’. I’ve seen that uncomfortable look on a thousand straight men before. It’s just adorable, and it’s exactly the ego boost I need to start the night.
Hermione Granger gulped her tea and flipped to the pages concerned, holding the book with evident distaste and flinching while she read the handwritten notation and descriptors that someone had painstakingly penned at least two centuries before. It was clearly the product of a truly vile mind, and her hand shook slightly while she absorbed the meaning in the words. It dawned on her that Malfoy was likely right. It was small wonder no one had ever heard of such a spell...given that anything this loathsome would have been destroyed by the Ministry if found.
------------------------------------------------------------
The first and second year classes had been easy. The third and fourth had been fairly tolerable as well, but after fifth year, dueling practice was more closely intermingled with standard assignments, and keeping up with it was difficult at best, and downright exhausting to boot!
“Anything wrong, love? You look a little peaked. Dinner's almost ready, and the kids have worked up an appetite on the pitch today. Wore me out, they did.”
“Harry.” Draco inclined his head in greeting.
"Oh...My...God! Weasley cock! My hand...my dick! I have to wash. Ew!! Just...just...NO!"
Ron finally turned crimson and snapped. "You too, Harry?!" Then stormed out and left while the other students collapsed in the hall laughing until they could scarcely breathe.
“What I want…is to see you living as good as you deserve. No strings attached. None of this bullshit with you living with some old guy you don’t even like. Not after what you did for me. I know I never asked you to do it, I just set you up for the fall, and I know the time since then and now couldn’t have been easy. What I’m saying is, there’s a place for you here if you want it. Always.”
They were already peeling off clothes with identical calm and familiarity. There was no ticklish fumbling from Harry these days. It was easier to talk, easier to smile, and easier to drop pretense and get right to sex every time they met.
“You’re kidding?! She’s so…demure, I didn’t think you’d have it that bad. I had to fend off a quiz about whether we snogged when they weren’t watching. I dodged that one and steered my way back to safer ground. You know, hammering home that it’s a perfectly normal thing to like who one likes and all. Thank God their mother has her wits about her. No bloody idea how I’d have managed all this on my own. Scary how smart they’re getting. Or how wise. Like they have the world all figured out and they’re just a few years from being grown already. What did you run into?”
“You’re late.” The words come like sizzling acid, disdain in every syllable. Ron cracks immediately.
“Whatever he needs me to do. A lot more than I did for the last guy. You were right…Harry is different, and there‘s no one and nothing I want more than him.”
“Sort of. The spell only works when you get near the person you most admire, then you completely abase yourself in front of them. If he really hated Harry, he wouldn’t be acting that way. Ironic, don’t you think?”
“Daddy…you’re worrying again.”
With that, James stood up and hugged his parent, taller than he had any right to be, and was off to his bachelor's night. Draco quietly strolled to the library of the manor, and found a shelf of private volumes that hadn't been opened in many a year. In the sleeve between two pages, a single photograph had been tucked away years before. You couldn't tell at a glance. Nothing was all that different. It was a snapshot taken of himself, Harry and an infant James. The clothing had been bulky and apportioned just so as to keep his condition hidden. To the casual observer, it was Draco and Harry, same as they had ever been, with newborn son held between them. There was a hidden truth in that picture...that no matter the shape or form, the person was the only real constant. The experiences that shaped a person weren't purely dependent on the sex of their birth...and the way in which a person saw themselves had little to do with their beginning or end. Some things simply were, without regard to flesh, or other people's perceptions of the world and how one fit in it. It would have been thought scandalous in his day, near twenty years ago...but times changed, as times were oft wont to do, and what once had been a private thing perhaps wasn't half so scandalous as he'd once imagined it was. He'd tell Harry of the conversation later. Whatever they'd kept from others, in twenty years they'd kept nothing more from each other, and never would. It was Draco's fervent hope that the same would be true for his son and his soon to be daughter-in-law. If he could have made a second wish...it would only have been for the happiness of his children and theirs.
The Echoes Of Yesterday…..by Samayel
I know what you’re thinking…what you must think. He didn’t do anything. Not really. He knew that I idolized him, even if I didn’t yet understand why. He didn’t…he wasn’t like me. He wouldn’t have had anything to do with me if it hadn’t been for the assignments I finished for him. Unlike here, relationships between students are strictly prohibited, because it’s an all male school, and they take pains to discourage ‘friendships’ they think might go to far. They teach that it’s weakness, and I still think…I think Yves’ classmates, his real friends, pushed him into it…into making a joke of it.
Harry waited in his office quietly, sorting papers for his next classes tomorrow. By now, Hermione must have finished her appointed meeting with young Draco, and the lad would be on his way for a final meeting with Harry for the day. All that remained to be reviewed was his class schedule, adjusted for Hermione’s twice monthly lectures, and a brief overview on how Draco’s ’project’ was coming along.
“Shite! It gets worse than what we covered so far? What…did ya blow the whole of Slytherin in a chorus girl outfit, humming old show tunes all the while?”
Harry stalked forward, and looked down at Draco’s prone and naked form. Draco was trembling from head to toe, and his eyes were glazed, as if in some trance, looking upward at Harry in awe.
“No…really…it would be completely alright if you shut the fuck up. I don’t ask for the inner secrets of your love life. I just clean up after them! Upholstery, dude, it’s not a bedspread! Can’t just shove it in the wash and call it a day. Things between Hermione and me are just fine, and that’s all you need to know. Please…forget I said anything. I’ll even disapprove if we can just move on and get down to business.”
Until today.
“FUCKING HELL, HARRY! How can you let him say that shit to you? He’s always calling you ‘stupid Gryffindor’! You let that Slytherin shit walk all over you, fucking insulting you in your own house, in front of us! What the hell is wrong with you! No one cares if you’re a poof, but for fucksake have some pride!”
“While I was out, they ran tests, spells for memory and consciousness, trying to figure out if I’d ever wake up. They found the memories of those last seconds. What was in my heart…what was in my mind when the curse hit me. They told me after I woke up. It was too personal…then. Even more so after Draco left me. He wanted me to see him on the side from his wife, like a dirty little secret we’d keep to ourselves. I couldn’t believe it. That he’d even ask that of me. They told me he used to sneak into the hospital ward to be with me while I was out of it and still healing. Every night. He left at dawn so others wouldn’t find him there. After all that, he still had the nerve to ask me if I’d accept sneaking around on the side. I went ballistic, Ron. I think I chased him off. That’s when he left. With me cursing him up one side and down the other. That’s why he left. That was the last I saw of him until he…until he died.”
Draco sat still, thunderstruck and silent. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he gulped and took a breath, and the sighed and nodded.
Like a vision of heaven, the door to the suite opened and a woman dressed entirely in black emerged, chin upright and defiant, eyes hollow with grief but still bright and alert.
Draco was so reserved, and his face rarely gave away his inner thoughts, but at least when he and Harry talked, Harry could tell when Draco was being sincere. It was different for Harry, who was used to being untouched except for blows, unloved, ignored and silent by cruel necessity. Harry’s reserve melted away whenever Draco was near, and his smile and demeanor gave away the depth of his affection in a way that almost made words unnecessary.
Ron’s head whipped back around. Harry’s black shirt was torn in the corner, and wetness was visible down the fabric of his right arm…the one he’d had out the window. Harry was calmly applying a makeshift bandage from the black bag on the floor.
There is a cold rag on my head. I’m on silk. His bed. His sleeves are rolled up and when I open my eyes and look, all I can see are the cords of tensed muscle in his arms. There are scrapes healing on his knuckles. The antibiotic ointment gleams on them. I feel light headed…and a little nauseous. Harry Black is snapping a cell phone shut and picking up an icepack. He pauses when he looks at me and sees my eyes open. He called a doctor. A doctor is coming. Why waste time on a doctor for someone who knows too much and is going to wind up in some morgue? I’m too confused to think straight, but he’s smiling while he puts the icepack on my head.
Harry wasn’t sure how much time passed. It could have been minutes or hours. Eventually, Draco began to stir in his arms, coherent at last. Dazed, unsteady, and with a furious blush rapidly spreading across his face and body, Draco stumbled upright and lurched toward his clothes, forced to stop by the sudden need to vomit.
“Okay. No more talk like that. I promise. Some things aren’t worth risking. Especially sex with you.”
I lean in close, my finest Cheshire cat grin only a whispered breath from her ear. Each word is perfectly aimed to let the offer brush a soft breeze against the perfect shell of her ear.
“What are you waiting for? Get down here and kiss me!”
Harry walked away from the pitch, still biting back anger and adrenaline, leaving the two Slytherin boys on the empty pitch. How they got back in undetected was their own problem. Harry’s problem was much more complicated.
I can call the week that passed a good one…and I would sooo not be lying. So many things to get used to, but I’m learning. I hate mornings…it’s like my religion…but after seven years of waking up when everyone else does I guess I’m okay with structured, routine schedules.
Strong hands running up my back while he whispers confused and grateful words of need. I can tell. He, in his own way, is sometimes scared of what he feels. The strength of it. The way it complicates. But it’s too powerful to just ignore. The time for that is past. We’re both in too deep to escape. We have to make our way together now, because nothing else would ever be enough.
“And your point is, Ron?”
It had gone surprisingly well, all things considered. Getting into Slytherin’s common room was easy once he had the password. Zabini and Nott shared a room, and a little magic was required to get in, but they were sleeping targets, and a couple Silencing Charms and Body Bindings later, with the assistance of his cloak and the application of Levicorpus, Harry had removed them from the Slytherin dorms with no one the wiser.
Draco slipped his robe on over his uniform and adjusted his badge, then strolled away in perfect calm. Harry sighed softly with relief, letting his breathing return to normal, hoping he could get on with a cool bath and a decent night’s sleep. He stared studiously at the mirror as Draco sauntered away. Draco turned just before he reached the entryway.
’When I found him, I could tell he’d let himself be a dependent if I let him. Tempting…because he’s so fucking beautiful. So smart…and funny…and not from this fucking world in bed. I could…I could make him do anything I want. He’d do it, just because I told him to. Who wouldn’t want that? Someone who fixates on you…only wants you, depends on you for everything and hangs on your every word. Jesus…it’s every man’s pipe dream! Naturally, I managed to completely fuck that up. Oh, no…Harry couldn’t have a boyfriend that does exactly as he’s told and stays quietly uninvolved. I had to want him to be well. Whole. Complete. Doesn’t that just complicate the ever-loving fuck out of things?’
The music started up. It was time to go. He loved to be the center of attention, or at least half of it now that he had Harry alongside him...and there would be more than enough attention to go around today. Draco turned away from the mirror and opened the double doors to the garden, stepping out in perfect style.
Big Chicago Part 13.….by Samayel
“That’s where you’re wrong, Ron. Harry deserved this a long time ago. I’m surprised he managed to be a perfect gentleman about this for so long.”
Minerva’s first concern was Harry. She’d genuinely believed that the man could handle more than he imagined, and it had shaken her quite badly to think that he might genuinely be ill. If Malfoy believed he could handle walking through painful wards, then he could try if he liked. The worst that could happen would be his failure, and others would come soon enough. There was still the chance that he might succeed, and even the best wards were more vulnerable from the inside. It was worth it.
{*I could do all those things…but I wouldn’t. That’s how much I love you. I couldn’t hurt you. Even with all the power in the world, I wouldn’t use it to hurt you. It’s over, Draco. Don’t be afraid. I won’t let anything happen to you, love.*}
A minute or two later, Draco was arched and stifling a cry between gritted teeth, thrusting into Harry’s hand as white drops jetted onto their clothes and rolled down Harry’s wrist.
He’d choked down pills every day for weeks now, and that just had to be the difference. Who knew? Such a little thing, but such a big difference. They still made him want to puke just looking at them, but what the hell? You couldn’t argue with great results.
Draco blushed. “Well, yeah. I wanted this to be perfect for you. No compromises. So I…I uh…I studied.” The last word was almost a garbled whisper.
Those words had sealed Nott's fate, and his blackened bones had been all that was recoverable from the wreckage of the Nott Estate. Harry had been suspended quietly, and the incident had been hushed up and buried. His friends in the Ministry had evaporated after making a final favor of clearing his record and protecting his name, and at nineteen years of age, Harry was alone in Grimmauld Place, walking down empty halls that had once echoed with Draco's voice.
Ron was stifling outrage, purpling and biting his lip while he waited for Harry to stop.
TBC!!!
It had been sheer hell these last couple of weeks. Then the devil himself came to town. Rufus Scrimgeour, Special Agent, FBI. He’d brought his own fawning toady, that pipsqueak asshole Dawlish, along for the ride. The investigations into every mob related homicide in Chicago had been nominally turned over to his command, and the staff of the Organized Crime Task Force had been transformed from leaders into assistants overnight.
He steps back, sliding an arm around my waist, and I just curl in and get comfortable.
“Harry is my everything now, Pans. He’s in plastics, hovering near the top. You know…seven figures a year. Just my style too. Tall, dark, handsome, cock that won’t go down until the sun comes up. Sweet, sane and generous. I’m keeping this one, and he only swings my way. Don’t even think about working him. He won’t budge.”
“I know. I wouldn’t have said anything…inappropriate, sir. You have my word on it. I know I acted hastily, but…”
Sleep isn’t coming tonight. I’m in oversized silk pajamas in a bed so big that it makes me look like an infant, holding onto a pillow and wishing the sun would come up. I’m afraid…and I have every right to be.
“This might sound a little weird…given the time you’ve had of it, but I don’t want you to do anything you don’t feel comfortable with. I don’t have a big itinerary or anything, but I had some loose plans for the right now, starting with getting a check up. I was thinking dinner here tonight, a good night’s rest, maybe some shopping tomorrow if you feel up to it. Anywhere you like. Just some time on the town before we celebrate that birthday you have coming up. Other than that…read to your heart’s content, make music, enjoy the food, and live. Find out for yourself what you want to do with the rest of your life.
They’ve figured out the game we ran in New York. Our policy prohibits the taking of innocent lives, and only under the most extreme duress do we even take direct action against law enforcement and politicians. Central to our secrecy and security as an organization is that we, as much as possible, do not involve ourselves directly in the processes of governance. We steer people and situations to the conclusions we support, eliminate obstacles or create them, disrupt activity or communications by Riddle or his cronies, but we do not kill at random, we do not take innocent lives, and we do not kill without due consideration regarding the target. As a result, Riddle’s people have moved the game into the hands of perfectly normal citizens, and to a certain degree this ties our hands.
“I…I had other concerns. I like to read, and childish games never interested me. I was smarter than most of the other students, and they liked being upstaged about as much as my teachers did. Sometimes being good at something doesn’t make you any friends.”
The Heat Is On! ……By Samayel
Then we shall discuss your history, and perhaps a measure of your future, as well as diverse other matters that may strike me as we chat. Alright?”
“Best sex ever…now interrupted…however can I help you?” Sarcasm dripping from every word.
---------------------------------------------------------
Among the upper class, being beautiful is a way of life. It is the norm. People wonder why the spectacularly wealthy always possess the glow of good health and look younger than they are. There is a reason for things being that way. It’s called money. Doctors, nutritionists, dentists, plastic surgeons, personal coaches and an endless array of professionals who can help you change anything you don’t like about yourself. All it takes is money.
“Harry’s not like any of you think! You’re all wrong! All of you! He’s better than that! He’s more decent than any of you, more worthy! You haven’t got the right to…”
That was the truth. It had nipped at his heels every day of these last decades, and he’d fought back with spells and potions and finally whiskey, but it had never gone away. It was alright to cry, knowing this, now while he was alone. Some things just hurt because they did, and there wasn’t anything wrong with that. Oddly, he couldn’t quite help smiling and laughing a little at it all while he cried.
Law enforcement goes a big rubbery one when it comes to drugs. They love them. Not the way club kids do…at least not always, but they universally owe their budgets and careers to drugs. If it wasn’t for people trying to party or just forget, the cops would be forced to concentrate on either serious criminals or traffic infractions. Drugs provide a steady stream of busts that are often uncomplicated, and move thousands of people through a system that employs clerks and lawyers on a scale that no Wall Street firm ever could. Drugs are bread and butter, and if they vanished like people wished, the system would collapse overnight. Like blood-gorged ticks on the back of a dog, law enforcement survives on the flesh and blood of junkies and fools.
Someone is screaming. He’s taking over. Making sure there are no questions. Bile is dripping off of my chin while I shake uncontrollably.
“I beg to differ. I’m pretty sure thought wasn’t involved, because I thought I made it clear that this insipid Hufflepuff bullshit is off the menu. Was I unclear?”
Draco leaned just his face forward, lowered his voice, and smirked. "Oh, I didn't cook this up. How about some hospitality...for news of Harry Potter?" The look in Hermione's eyes told him that he'd struck the mark, but the woman was stubborn just the same. It couldn't be helped...they really did have a fair measure of bad blood between them.
“Sometimes you scare me way more than You-Know-Who.”
Big Chicago Part 12...by Samayel
“You got it. Peace!”
“Do it then…if you can. Find him, and break the wards if you must. I’ll summon others in the meantime.”
“You won’t think me impertinent if I answer honestly, will you?”
Remus didn’t have an office. He had a motel room, a pocket full of business cards, and a cell phone. On the bright side, he knew all the right people in this town, and he had resources in the police precincts that a lot of guys in the same line of work just didn’t have. He had a laptop computer, several cameras, and a little black book with so many informant numbers and contacts that it wasn’t hard for him to dig up dirt on cheating husbands or insurance frauds. It wasn’t exactly a noble cause, but the pay was just enough to keep the clerk at The Lucky Ace Motel from throwing him out.
Ron carried the coffee cups with a steady hand. Range practice had been fun, but time with Hermione when she wasn’t overwhelmingly busy was better. The only downside of his weapon of choice was the extra kick when it fired, which could diminish accuracy if you didn’t stay well practiced. When he wasn’t repairing or maintaining the handful of vehicles that were in regular use, it was essential to keep his skills up to par. Sure, he was nowhere near Harry, but who the hell was? Some people were in a class of their own. Still, the pistol range provided an awe-inspiringly good way to excuse extra office time…with Hermione…and besides…the coffee was always the expensive foreign stuff.
“Get in the corner.”
In the meantime, work has ebbed just a little, and the free time has been glorious. The people here know me. I’ve started dressing as I like, but always tastefully…never gaudy or clubby at work. I had to get permission to re-pierce my ears, but it was worth it. They frown on identifying marks that can be recognized from one identity to another, but because of my unique ability to be either gender, which is held to be of value, I was able to have the healed scars of old piercings from years ago reopened. The first posts will come out soon and I’ll wear what I like when I like it, but for now I have a set of steel posts in each ear, as well as the hoops hanging from the current holes.
But nature wasn’t the same for humans, and his difference was purely internal. What then was their excuse for labeling him as weird or a liar? Some pathetic need to raise themselves up from the muck by pulling everyone else down into it? He’d never spoken of these things openly, to anyone, and there had never really been anyone to speak to about them.
…onto a hardwood floor.
The Heat‘s On Hold.….by Samayel
At that moment, Harry had no fear of death, or of killing, for having lost so much in his life, the warped creature once named Tom Riddle had just taken the one thing left that mattered most to him, and death held only the promise of freedom from the sorrow he knew would come when his rage slid away.
I pick through the library again. I won’t be reading poetry before bed. I need a real distraction. One that will keep my attention off of romance! Even though it usually bores me to tears, I take a book on economics, An Inquiry Into The Cause Of The Wealth Of Nations, just to guarantee that sleep will look good. Harry doesn’t keep a lot of liquor in the house. Some scotch…the top shelf, single malt kind that gets imported from Scotland. There’s some gin and vermouth for proper martinis, and there’s a few import beers, several bottles of wine and champagne, and that’s about it. I don’t want to be a lush like Mother, so I settle for mixing some orange juice with one of the lesser champagnes. It’s called a mimosa, and it’s a perfectly acceptable drink for almost any occasion. It won’t be enough to get me drunk, but it’s something tasty to sip at while I read.
“You caught me. Guilty as charged. I’ve been here missing you so much I thought I’d implode. Are you sure you can leave town for more than a day?”
Begging piteously to be shagged into the mattress, off the bed, and through the floor, was not a thing heard from Malfoys. It simply wasn’t in their character…until tonight. Draco pleaded openly, frantic to be filled, sated, joined with Harry as closely as they could be. There was little that was rational or calm in the wide, gray eyes that looked up to Harry hungrily, and when Draco saw the thick prong spearing upward from Harry’s groin, his entire body shuddered with need.
Harry stood gobsmacked, weeping erection still unfulfilled and jutting out in front of him.
Some parts resonated, clear in his ears while he fumbled with his own thoughts in silence. Catatonia. Grief. Stress. Withdrawal. Dreams. He heard them, spoken despite his presence, which was ignored by all concerned while they made their way to the infirmary.
Thank God…thank God I can write off my past like a blank slate, because he doesn’t care about what I have done…only what I can do. The person who did those things is ebbing away like the flotsam along the beach, and the tide is carrying away the last of the old. Something new…and better…is being born, and Harry didn’t give his heart to a faithless whore. With every word that brings him closer to me, he brings me closer to him, and every minute next to him steals away an hour of the empty hell that used to pass for my life.
“Child-molestin’ son of a bitch. They should just let us kill him.”
‘This conversation isn’t happening. My child didn’t ask me that. It didn’t happen, and I live in a world where a question like that will never be asked.’
Needless to say, with such a lofty goal, I’m dedicated to finding an opportunity…
Ron’s towering rage dissipated in a flash, replaced by total confusion…and a general sense of relief that the offending screen was blank.
“You’re on. See you later.” Ron closed the bathroom door and went about his business, leaving a very cheerful Harry to get dressed for the new day.
I know it was coke that got you into trouble, and that can’t happen here. Understand? I’m not making a value judgment…the problem is that it brings other bullshit along with it, and this place is secure and meant to stay that way. There is no wavering on that. What we do outside of here is irrelevant, but we don’t bring trouble here.
It wasn’t hard to slide a little more in at a time, because if you combine the considerable experience I had before prison, and the years of it that came after, I’m very comfortable opening my body up to entry. I know how to make it simple and comfortable. The only disappointment is that rubber, or plastic, isn’t warm and alive, and there aren’t strong hands on my hips or shoulders. No lips to rain kisses onto my shoulders. I was really just pressing the thing in and moving it slowly to stimulate the lonesome and aching place inside of me that cries out for Harry. I haven’t used a toy in years, and frankly it’s so awkward, posing that way, one arm twisted to reach the base of the toy and manipulate it, that it’s hard to properly enjoy myself.
Harry had finally drifted back to sleep after a light supper, which he‘d only taken in because Prewett had been adamant about his eating something. The food at Hogwarts was always good, but it still sat like a lump of lead in his stomach. The Dreamless Sleep had worn off hours ago, and his next dose hadn‘t yet been delivered. Hovering on the brink of slumber, memories came easily, suppressed by Dreamless Sleep the day before.
“I suppose I could tolerate ice cream. If you let me order any flavor I want and promise not to fuss over me in front of other people so much. It’s not so bad at home, but really, Daddy, it’s not like I’m five! I’ll be twelve in seven months. Don’t be so stodgy in front of the other kids…I don’t want them to think my father is an old fogy!”
“Okay. Granted…but you still ought to offer something more than words. I’ve been traumatized…I deserve some very, very serious comforting.”
I was very cross with you…for months. You deserve to know why. Harry…I didn’t want to talk about certain parts of my life. I felt that they were mine and mine only, and that I had the right to keep them to myself. I still have that right…but I know that, sometimes, I’ve hurt people by letting my past dictate my present. You’re one of them. I see a lot of things…clearer than I used to. Other things have been explained for me, and they make sense in a way they never did. You were right to make me get help.
He tried to remember the way Draco’s tongue slithered around the head of his cock, and the way those elegant hands had manipulated his iron hard and aching length. It was fucking unreal. Malfoy gave head like it was a work of art, and Harry was his living canvas. Both the blonde’s hands, as well as his lips and tongue, were in action.
‘The house-elves will be busy tomorrow.’
Draco’s eyes had narrowed and his voice was a furious hiss. “Not yet, you’re not…but you fucking well will be! I told you-”
Harry turned and opened the door to his office, watching as Draco rather sluggishly rose and ambled in, looking un-amused but calmer than he had been the day before. At least he wasn’t as actively insolent, but Harry was familiar with every form of teenaged slouch and sneer. He’d seen them all, and it was obvious that while Draco was covering it a bit, he was still irritable.
Harry sighed expansively. “Aww, thanks. I don’t mind staying, but I don’t mind going either. I’m not getting that much done today anyway. I think I’ll write letters to owl the kids after I get home. Sure you’ll be alright with me off?”
“Well, let’s just put it this way, Dee. You wanted suffering, and a lengthy stay with the authorities, preferably under circumstances as unpleasant as yours were. I can make arrangements that will place additional evidence where law enforcement can find it, with Blaise’s name and accounts tied to it, using almost nothing but the internet. Illegal pornography. The law is so violently strict about criminal sexual conduct that he won’t get a very fair trial, and that nearly guarantees his conviction. The more disgusting the crime, the more visceral the reaction from judges and juries, and the less they look at little facts that might result in his going free. Angry people make snap decisions.
Lastly, since professor Potter will require considerable rest, and this is the first year since his start that he has been ill, Hogwarts is ill prepared to replace him on short notice. At the moment, it appears that professor Ron Weasley, a veteran of the war alongside professor Potter, will be teaching as a substitute in the interim, until I feel that Mr. Potter is ready to return to his duties.
“THE Hermione Granger-Weasley?! The one who wrote ‘Quantum Physics And Its Applications And Operations In The Magical Universe’? I almost saw her speak at the World Of Magic Symposium in Brussels, but I couldn’t get permission to attend. I was fifteen and school was in session. Please tell me you can get her to come, even if it’s only for a day!”
Harry stretched and attempted to stand on wobbly legs, fighting dizziness that nearly overtook him while Draco snickered at his efforts. "That's why I'm not moving, love... at least not until I have my wits back. Might be a bit yet, though." Harry smiled at that, then suddenly blanched white as a sheet, his mouth a rictus of horror and shock. He pointed to Draco's backside, stammering and gaping. Draco felt a creeping sense of wrongness, just from the look on Harry's face. "What is it, love? I said I was fine."
Harry has been gone for days. I stopped watching the TV…nothing but Daddy running off at the mouth and the usual nonsense that people call news. The latest scare-mongering over a flesh-eating virus that one person in a million ever catches. Sound bites from politicians and other criminals. Advertisements flogging away at why we desperately, frantically, urgently need to BUY THIS NOW! What a fucking joke. The right pimple cream won’t get you a date with a cheerleader, the right cologne won’t make you a celebrity, the right soda won’t make you an athlete, and the right beer won’t make your boss stop being an asshole and conjure up a beach full of sun-worshipping female volleyball players. It’s enough to make you puke, but it pays the bills, so that stations can keep broadcasting material handed to them on scripts, or quote ‘research’ handed to them by special interests, in between ‘reality shows’ that are spectacularly unreal.
It bothered me...more than I'm comfortable saying out loud. I suppose that's the point of the journal. I can say what I thought, and what I didn't dare speak. My only feelings on Draco were disgust that he was necessary and useful...until I came to in the hospital and started remembering things. The only memories I had at first were just him being a pompous beast in between the occasional round of violent sex. Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Finding out that he...he unraveled what was going on, tracked down the spell, and got Hermione to help by basically begging and apologizing...just to give me my life back? It's an understatement to say that it spun my world around a bit.
Draco Malfoy was staring at the image of his father, whose gaze had fallen to Harry, smiling affectionately and speaking words that Harry could feel more than hear. So like the dreams he’d lived with, so clear compared to misty memories. A healthy handsome young man, dressed sharply and confident in his stance, lean and tall and full of life. Until Harry’s gaze flickered just a few inches to one side as he stepped forward, silent and almost entranced.
And then he’s out of the room and gone. I can hear him sniping at Harry on the way down the hall and on the way to the elevator. Harry will be back here any minute. I feel terrible…but tomorrow…I could be going shopping. Who says all changes have to be bad?
Harry was unbearably gentle, still kissing Draco with same soft intensity that had carried them this far. Draco took matters into…well, not quite his own hands per se, but all it took were a few experimental shifts of his waist to show Harry that he was comfortable…and hungry for more. The same firm but carefully paced movements quickened only slightly, increasing in intensity and depth, each further push making Draco’s eyes roll back into his head while his teeth gritted with the damnably pressing need to come. Even now, Harry still found small ways to keep Draco’s hands from finding their way to his erection, now almost completely recovered from the initial surprise and discomfort of entry.
Harry was getting control of his swimming vision, and hadn’t the faintest clue what to say. He watched in gasping shock as Draco raised his come coated right hand to his mouth and let his slender, pink tongue slowly and deliberately lap away every drop from between his thumb and fingers, all the while staring at Harry with an almost savage glee.
“You mean it?”
How I would like to make them eat their angry words, a rousing supper of crow. I could. If I made Harry my own and chose this existence for good and all. They would be left stewing in their venom, amazed that they were wrong about me. It’s in my power to make such a thing real. There must be a way. I just don’t know how to claim all that I desire without losing some part of it.
“Yes. Not all of it. A portion was for me. I held the book and...I KNEW...I...parts of the text are still in my memory. I would like to read it all, because I don't have your gift for memory, but I know things, things I never could have hoped to hear. I know that he loved me, even if we parted terribly. What that means to me...is incalculable. What I felt for him, then it wasn't a mistake, or a waste. I've lived with the fear that our parting meant I'd been a fool..and I know otherwise now. But I also know he wanted you to be well, and healthy, and grow to be strong and wise and good. He wanted to be there to see all your dreams come to fruition...and that was stolen from him, and that privilege has been passed to me. It would be an honor to call you my kin, and I'm grateful for it no matter how it came about.”
“Oh. Yes. It was very good. I liked it. I usually read textbooks. Not literature. It was…very different. He was…Lord Byron that is…a very passionate person, wasn’t he? It struck me that way.”
Draco put his arms behind his head and stretched back comfortably. Thoughts of Harry drifted behind his closed eyes and through his mind.
“Nothin’ personal, right? Just…lotsa crazy stuff goin’ on these days. I knew you were all right though. I mean…it’s you. Ya’ wan’ me to take yer coat? Or jacket?”
The Echoes Of Yesterday...by Samayel
His room was ahead, and in that still quiet he studied and wrote, always pushing to exceed any expectation that might be placed upon him. Tonight was no different. A request of the elves for dinner, quickly eaten and barely savored, and study until dusk. The calm rote of study was soothing, stripping away layers of thought that clamored to run wild. In here, adrift in text after text, drafting inch after inch of parchment, he was free. Free from the imagination that whispered promises that could never come true.
“I haven’t any reason to be antagonistic toward you, so take this as you please and understand that I’m trying to be as direct and honest as I can. Draco, the events of the past week seem to hammer home that you don’t deal well with frustration of any kind. The loss of your temper, and a rather spectacular loss of it at that, is why we’re here now.
Harry’s day started well enough. John Prewett administered two potions to Harry before classes began, breakfast was quite good, and Harry easily passed off rumors about his ’incident’ the day before to a simple flu that had gone uncaught. The brat made no appearance that morning, at Harry’s room or during breakfast, and Harry was pleased that his orders had been obeyed, though he hadn’t expressly forbidden the young man to join the school for breakfast. Harry’s classes ran smoothly, save for the answering of questions about whether he was well or not, which were actually kind of sweet. The majority of his students were very fond of him, and had genuinely worried for him over a single missed day. Once Ron and the others had seen that he was alright and seemed well enough, the questions died to down to a bare minimum, and Harry felt that he could get on with something like a normal day.
Draco stood at the door of Harry's suite, intoning the last passages of the diary. Within, Harry had heard someone speaking at his door. His skin prickled uncomfortably and he felt oddly cold, despite the fact that there was no reason to feel that way. Some impulse made him go to the door and listen to the strange monotonous speech outside, laying aside his annoyance at being disturbed. The voice sounded vaguely like young Draco's, but it was more like muttering than clear speech, and that wasn't anything like Draco.
‘Not this time, Potter. You do it for me. I’ll do it for you. Everyone wins, right?’
“Right. Well. I suppose. Tea it is. I take mine with-”
The ultimate goal, of course, is to eliminate him completely. He’s quite elderly, and in due time nature will finish the job for us, but he has access to superb medical treatment and has survived the ravages of age for some time already. Nonetheless, we try to force his direct involvement in these affairs, or at least make it necessary for him to communicate personally with his stooges. He generally uses third parties to convey messages and conduct business, but when he is enraged, his ego drives him to intervene in person. That’s what can allow us, or rather Harry, a ’clear shot’ at removing him from the worldly equation, and putting a stop to a decades long run of graft, crime, murder and corruption.
“Okay Mr. Wiseguy! Lemme ask you this! If we went to a pool hall, and I drank beer and ran the table and wiped out all the rookies, having the night of my life, while every chick in the place rubbed her tits in your face and tried to grope your crotch…for two hours…would you call that a great night on the town?”
So much pent up emotion, so much anger and grief, all poured into a single act that shattered the silent tension that had hung between their past encounters.
It was still odd, feeling full 'there', stretched open and slick and with Harry warm and alive inside of him. He could hear Harry occasionally gasp or hiss with pleasure, and Draco just focused on savoring the sounds he was causing and enjoying the sensations that seemed to keep his cock utterly rigid and dripping pre-come into the soft cloth that imprisoned his dick.
Had he really changed so much? He’d mishandled Draco’s son the same way…even with twenty years to sort himself out and know the right from the wrong. It was at the heart of why he was leaving this school behind. What moral center could he claim to have, and still be so selfish, so quick to vent anger when he was finally cornered? The man wasn’t really so much better than the boy he had been, and that was a shameful thing to think, but there you had it. The same rashness that had cost Sirius his life, the same anger that had caused calamities and accidents in his youth, and the same quickness with which rage flared in his heart and hand. So…maybe the younger Draco had brought it to the surface like no other could…but that excused nothing.
“Pleeease…Harry! Don’t…don’t make me wait anymore! Fuck me…now…god, pleeeease! I…I can’t wait another minute!!”
His tongue slithered across the whorled pink surface before him, and any faint shred of self control that Harry possessed evaporated on the spot. Within minutes, Draco had reduced his lover to tears and begging, none of it coherent, none of it answered. Harry’s cries were met with a solemn resolve to keep at the task, and when Draco finally chose to relent, it was only because his tongue was thoroughly exhausted.
Draco Malfoy’s nostrils were flared, and his eyes gleamed with a feral joy.
I get handed off to the maid and the cook, who actually bow for me when I arrive. The only tragedy is that I hate being seen the way I look right now. Frowzy and hagridden, dressed in the things a man I want to forget bought me, and stinking of the cesspit from which I came . I get guided to the bedroom suite. The bathroom is larger than four or five cells put together. Carpets so thick my feet get lost in them. I beg for privacy so I can bathe, but it’s really because I don’t want to be seen gawking anymore.
It was flattering, if a bit disconcerting at first. He liked that Harry responded so well to him, and that knowledge made him feel a surge of pride and more than a little lust. It was Harry’s quickly rising need for more that ultimately began to make him feel less confidant, and more than a bit nervous.
A moment like this can’t be purchased. It can only be absorbed. Right now I know how much I really have. This closeness…this warmth. You can’t get this in a store. Admittedly, shopping is a nice way to kill some time, and it certainly gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside…but not like this. I’m safer here than anywhere in the world. I have everything. I have Harry. All of him. More so than anyone else ever has, and in a way that transcends anything I’ve ever known. This isn’t just a special day for Harry. It’s just one of an endless string of special days for me, all made better because I can wake up here, like this, with him.
"You just left. I remember bits and pieces of things. I had a lot of therapy...not just healing. The mental kind. It took a long time. I wasn't used to being around people in a normal way. I remembered things though. Not in any order, just kind of jumbled up and popping out at random. I was about two months into my therapy. One day...I remembered something you said to me...that night. It was clear as day. About not lying to me...about wanting me to live long enough to know that...and after that things got...bad. It was pushed out of my head.
Harry snapped out of his stupor in time to throw his two cents worth in.
I wanted to. God, I wanted to be angry forever. I wanted someone to vent everything that pissed me off through my whole life...someone to hurt to make me feel better. Then I realized I was just like him...before. I don't really want to go into exact detail on how that made me feel. I'll hand it to you lot here in St. Mungos...you're a fair hand at talking someone down from the edge of madness or suicide.
The door closed with a muffled click. Harry suddenly had an epiphany. There was only one reason a Slytherin, particularly Malfoy, would divulge that much information!
Harry was slowly straddling Draco’s not inconsiderable manhood, and sliding down the length of it as calmly and surely as could be. The feeling of being enveloped by slick, tight warmth was making Draco fight to hold onto his self control, and Harry knew that he would have little difficulty making his hasty plan a reality.
All this…all these nice things…none of it means shit without Harry! I can’t…I can’t lose him. Not and keep a shred of sanity. I NEED him…not money…not drugs…him! The others will be here in a few hours. When did I start crying? I need a shower…again. I need a stiff drink…and some time to compose myself. I don’t want Harry to see me like this. I don’t want him thinking of anything but surviving out there. If I were a distraction…and it got him hurt…could I live with it?
_____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____
Harry smiled. In Draco's nervous, roundabout way, it was high praise indeed.
Amazement was in Draco’s eyes while he watched, and felt, Harry lower himself steadily onto the prick beneath him with green eyes blazing all the while. Harry’s face never showed anything but raw hunger, and Draco was keenly aware of the fact that, from this position, he had very little control of anything, but at the moment he truly didn’t give a damn!
“Shhh. Don’t worry. Ron knows what he’s doing, love. He’s taken off and landed a hundred times in planes like this one. It’s a calm day…we already checked…and it’s supposed to be perfect flying weather most of this week. We’ve got flotation gear and more, and a plane this size can practically act like a glider without engines.”
“So…uh…how about some ice cream at Fortescue’s? Your sister should be back any second…where did she go? There she…almost out of the line…matter of seconds, really.” ‘Hellish, exhausting, incredibly long seconds. Lily! For the love of God and Merlin! Please hurry! Just once!’
The mini-skirt is black leather, but done pricey and well, not the dirt-cheap hooker look. The top is barely enough to cover my strapless bra and falsies, but leaves plenty of pale, tight midriff and shoulder to look upon. I’ve been a little lavish with the make-up perhaps, but Blaise always liked that more than Harry does. The thing was, I was always witty and clever…and I can look one way and be another. I can play the game and be the pretty little tart, and then turn around and show who I really am inside. I wonder if it’s the irony that attracts him, or just the thrill of getting both worlds in one package. The slut in the bedroom, the perfect companion everywhere else. Does Harry want that too? Not that I’m complaining, but there are times when good looks just aren’t enough…and I wonder what my strongest suit really is.
The part I couldn’t tell you, the part I didn’t want to think about, was how badly I wanted you to just take me, use me as you pleased, even if you threw me away when you were done. As soon as it wore off, I wanted to crawl away and die. Those were things that I wasn’t supposed to feel anymore, and being helpless isn’t something I handle gracefully, but you probably already knew that part.
“Mr. Malfoy. If you’ll come with us, we have some questions we’d like you to answer. It seems that your former wife, Pansy Parkinson, was killed in what appears to have been an accident in Belgrade last night. I’m sorry to say this at such a time, but we’d be interested to know your whereabouts last evening, since foul play has not been ruled out. If you could accompany us to the Ministry, we’d like to have this matter resolved as quickly as possible.”
My family wanted this for me. No one offends the Dark Lord and walks away free and clear. I had to do it! One Malfoy already failed him, can you imagine what he’d do to another who drew his ire? I can. I wish I couldn’t, but I can.
The Echoes Of Yesterday...by Samayel
Harry hadn't been upset at all when told that Draco had found them, and promptly placed them where they could be added to an album at some later date when the rooms were properly finished. He'd flipped through them one by one, grinning the entire while, talking about the week that Draco the Elder had first come to Grimmauld Place, the weeks afterward that had led to them being close, their first kiss, and then telling the story behind each picture without a note of horror or regret.
So logical. So analytical. I can look back at it and explain it all so very well. And it doesn’t change a fucking thing. My heart knows he wouldn’t do that to me, but the rest of me knows that powerful men use their power however they please, and my gut instincts won’t let me ignore them.
The man in the mirror was unkempt and red-eyed, with eyes that had bags under them that you pack and travel to Europe on, and a mustache as streaked with gray as the rest of his thinning brown hair.
“I’m sorry.” Draco felt odd even saying it. He’d apologized on occasion, but for anything so egregious, and usually with a calm air about him the entire while. This was very different.
‘God…did I do anything to precipitate this? Could I have wanted to…unconsciously? No…can’t be. I never wanted this! Steady on, Harry. You can deal with this too. Hell of a first day out of the ward, but at least I still have time to sort these things out before picking up classes again. Let’s get this first part over with right now…then worry about whether it’s still possible to work around him.’
"Ah, Professor Potter, how timely. I should like to introduce you to our newest arrival. Please make the acquaintance of Draco, Lord Malfoy."
I agree entirely, but I use smaller words on average. Not that I don’t like the way he thinks, since he acknowledges things that most people with lots of ready cash won’t even say out loud, but I do have one niggling problem…my own conscience.
There was an oblique reference to his request months ago that Draco address his usual peremptory commands as polite requests. This note felt like Draco had taken that to heart. Harry grabbed his silverware and started eating, only to realize, two plates later, that the food tasted uncommonly good today.
Harry grabbed her into a hug that nearly crushed her, laughing like a maniac all the while.
Too many heavy thoughts. Too sobering for an early morning. He still didn’t have apologies written for anyone. He hoped that Prewett would be reasonable about the timing. It might take awhile to work out something that would be acceptable without being utterly humiliating.
Minerva sighed with relief and placed her cup on the desk with an air of satisfaction. “There will be a statement for you to sign, Harry, but I think that will be all I’ll require. I find it much easier to believe in a love struck youngster doing something terribly foolish than a calculating seducer wreaking havoc at the age of twelve. Nonsense…the things that come out of that school! I’ve more than a few things to see to this morning…is there anything else that either of you would care to discus before we start the day?”
The words dropped off my tongue like anvils. I feel like I can breathe again, and the quiet smile that looks so good on his face is back again. I can believe he doesn’t want to hurt me. I can believe that…but I just can’t believe that he won’t wind up doing it anyway.
“I’ve finished the first and second years’ papers for the week. Anything else, sir?” The faint hint of acid that usually marked any comment from Draco was absent for once, and Ron paused to rub his temples.
Harry stopped and turned around slowly, privately loathing the way Draco’s gaze made him feel flushed and hungry all over again.
“Don’t deny yourself the pleasure of a good meal because of concerns about the quality of the meat. Neither the beef, nor the man who directed its preparation for us, are British, so I suspect you’ll actually enjoy it, and in defense of my homeland, there are certain dishes in which the appropriate preparation of beef is actually quite a specialty here.”
It was looking a bit like they’d have to call it a mystery or hand the case off to the feds. The local impact was chilling. Tension had flared between the criminal organizations whose members had been killed in the riot. No violence yet, but a lot of ugly chatter on the street. The last thing anyone wanted was for someone to light the fuse on this powder keg of emotions…and then someone did. This morning as a matter of fact.
"Whatever can I help you with, Potter?"
Harry's eyes softened as a few stray tears ran down his boyfriends’ cheeks. He wished Draco understood how little he cared about being called racist and homophobic slurs or about getting a little scratch. None of that mattered so long as Draco was safe and happy.
A/N Hey, I'm not sure who all is keeping up with this but my school starts up again tomorrow so I don't know how often I'll be able to update once that starts. Everything is going to be chaotic bc we are doing completely online for the foreseeable future. I'll try my best to keep up with this story! Thanks for reading!! (And please comment bc I loveee to hear from you!)
. That's why Dad and Papá whispered about him behind his back, why Pansy and Blaise always exchanged worried looks, why Harry was sighing, why-
"Go, on. We'll be here."
Harry stared at her wordlessly. An accident. Somehow Parkinson had become Pansy and Mione had
"Hey, hey,
Draco bit the inside of his cheek to keep from snipping at Harry about his nosiness and how overly familiar he was being with him. He released a calming breath and turned to face the other boy.

“Is it now? How convenient that you seem to know what unbecoming means yet still managed to snake your way into a married woman's pants! You are such a
"You know, I've tried apologizing to him. He won't listen."
apologize for something you don't control. Certainly not for being triggered. We didn't know, now we do. We'll be more careful, hmm?" Draco said stroking his thumbs over Harry's face. Harry gave him a weak smile and nodded.
The third time Draco made his way up to Harry's flat he had never dreaded it more. Whatever had happened, it had been loud. Louder than any sort of yelling he'd ever heard before. He knocked on the door and for the first time, Harry wasn't the one to answer it.
Harry nodded dumbly as he followed Draco out of the bedroom. Harry silently lead him downstairs and towards the front door.

be taken good care of tonight.
"Pansy, you need to quit asking that of him. Draco is allowed to tell whomever, whatever, whenever he likes. You don't understand what it is to live with the urge to do what he does and it is unfair of you to ask him to promise he will stop. And you,"
He doesn't.
Draco was silenced by Harry's lips kissing him. Draco melted into the action letting him take control of it. So Harry did. He pulled Draco into his lap, one hand cupping his face tenderly and the other resting on his lower back. Harry felt Draco's fingers lace into his hair and tug lightly.
They both shot up, gawking at him, wide-eyed and shocked. Ron was dishevelled, to say the least, his hair sticking up at odd ends, cheeks flushed a dark red and huffing deep breaths before he took a large gulp of air and fixed Harry with a dark look. Oh, Merlin.
"I can't really remember, everything's sort of fuzzy, I think he put something in my drink. What happened? What did he..."
hurt him.
This was not happening, this was not happening. Please --
Draco sat on the floor for what felt like forever as he calmed himself down enough to breathe somewhat normally. Holding onto the thought of seeing Blaise and Pansy again seemed to help settle his nerves, he couldn't wait to see them, even if this torturous party was the cost.
"You'll be fine, Cub. And if anything happens we'll be right here across the street." Dad said softly, as he held onto Draco a little tighter.
you next time, Lucius, do not doubt that."
"Sorry," Draco whispers against his lips, brings his hands up, and strokes the sides of Harry's face to remind himself of where he is, "I'm wasting time. But, he didn't deserve
"Until you tell me otherwise, I'm sure it was just the wind. And I'm in flat 1C, in case you needed it. Have a goodnight, Harry."
“Yes, I’m a complete tosser. However, can I make it up to you?” He asked, nudging his nose against Draco’s softly, pulling an exasperated huff from him.
you for sticking with this story despite my erratic  and inconsistent updating schedule. Thank you for reading, my lovelies!
This was so
Too afraid it might make him realize his mistake and make him leave. Make him hate Draco. He doesn't believe he would survive that. Doesn't believe he would
When he finally pulled his eyes away from Harry, he was met with identical shit-eating grins from their friends.
"Don't give me that look, Dragon. Me and your father agreed it would be good for you to get out." Papá said, giving Draco the '
"I'm only here to check on Harry, then I'll leave," Draco said, a stony expression settling on his face. He was furious with how rude this man was being but he had to play nice if he wanted to make sure Harry was alright. He said nothing else, however, his glare could've burned holes into the ignorant git's face. And he'd deserve it too.
He sighed happily, Draco's expensive (probably French) cologne consuming him. Harry had never wanted something to last forever as much as he wanted this.
Draco groaned, his voice becoming more shrill with exasperation with every sentence he ground out. At the end of his rant, he took in a deep breath and released it in a huff. Potter had really sent him into a rage at the strange form of coddling.
snort at. He wriggled around in Harry’s arms meeting pretty green eyes focused on him as he did so and wove his arms around his neck. Draco lent up and gave him a quick peck to his lips.
"What d'you know about him?" He nodded at the unnaturally blonde boy helping his parents with the groceries. Harry had had an odd obsession with the bloke ever since he'd moved in across the street from him and it didn't seem to help any when Ron offhandedly mentioned they went to the same school.
, effectively glueing his tongue to the roof of his mouth and silencing him.
"I can't do this."
"What's the matter, Cub?" Remus asked quietly, and Sirius was grateful for it. He didn't think he would be able to speak without panic seeping into his words. Sirius could practically feel his nerves jumping out of his body. He was terrified to find out what had happened to his son.
Harry looked alarmed, nearly tripping over the last step when he took in the scene completely. Ron sitting on the sofa, tears streaming down his face, still very shoeless. Hermione, also with tears streaming down her face, trying to wriggle out of Draco's grip who held her tightly, his eyes stony, lips twisted into an unimpressed scowl and wearing a bloody white shirt.
"Goodnight, Pans."
It wasn't like he hadn't had the slur thrown at him before, but he wasn't expecting it here. Although, he wouldn't put it past this man to throw out slurs so casually.
"Oh, bugger off,
Malfoy finished saying as he walked out of the kitchen with two mugs in hand.
"Yeah, alright," Harry babbled, face feeling flush and mind fuzzy from the kiss, a dopey grin settling on his face, "I suppose I do have a 'bloody hero complex', but I'll only admit it as long as you keep snogging me like that."
"Draco, my love, what is it? What's the matter, my precious pet? Was it too much? You know you can always safeword out. My sweet prince, tell me, please?"
"Mione?" He called again as he padded his way up the stairs. Again no answer, Ron shrugged. He figured she was probably busy looking over some kind of paperwork or other, she never could hear him when she was reading anything.
"I'll keep you company, you lot go on."
Harry and Ron sputtered simultaneously. Ron dropped a hand on top of his head, "I've been complaining about you both to Luna for the past week." He muttered, giving Harry a mortified look. Usually, Harry would've snickered, only his best mate could manage to do something like that, but he was busy staring at Luna and Draco.
"Mother, I will not pretend to be someone I'm not and I refuse to stay in this suffocating mansion with that poisonous man." Draco coolly replied turning to face his strong-willed mother. Her blue eyes pierced into Draco's and it took all of his self-restraint not to duck his head in shame. He couldn't bear to disappoint his mother.
fell from his lush lips in between panting gasps and guttural moans. He looked utterly debauched. Sinfully attractive as he bounced on Harry's cock in his lap in the centre of the throne room, not a care in the world. Harry loved the way his lover got after he killed a man.
They should all know not to mess with Draco unless they wanted to deal with Harry.
Pettigrew shrank into himself, shoulders hunched in submission. Harry scowled darkly at the pathetic excuse for a man. Despite his late father's fondness of the short and rotund lord, Harry could find no use for him.
. It made him seem helpless. He was

One moment Harry's fury was rising steadily with each word that the lord spoke aloud and the next Pettigrew fell silent and crumpled to his knees with a resounding thud that echoed in the nearly empty throne room.
difficult. He was damaged, he was all
Draco froze, stunned.
Draco tucked Harry's head under his chin, while he had one arm supporting Harry's back and the other trailing soft lines on his arm. He kissed Harry's head a few more times as he let Harry calm his shaky breathing.
"Sweet thing, you don't have to apologize, especially not for something you didn't do. I'm alright, I've had worse," Harry said as he wrapped a hand around Draco's and brought it to his lips. He kissed his fingertips, his palm, the soft inside of his wrist just where his pulse was at and hummed quietly. He loved kissing his wrists, feeling his pulse on his lips, reminding himself that Draco was here, was real, was
But he never asks.
Draco stumbled his tired body over towards them and poked at their faces until they woke up.
do this.
He felt something press into the palm of his hand. It was rough and sort of prickly and strange. For a second he thought he was holding a thing stuck full of needles and the feeling startled him enough to open his eyes pulling him back to reality.
"Hey Mione, did you hear me, love? I said we ca-" Ron began to say but all the air left his lungs and all of his words fell away when he fully opened their bedroom door.
"Surprise, darling!" Pansy nearly shouted, pulling Harry away from Draco the second they made it to the table and planting a kiss on his cheek. "Draco and I managed to track these two lovely people down for you."
"No, sir." Harry softly replied, glancing away from Draco's piercing silver eyes.
Draco thought he heard Theodore say but his mind was cloudy and his entire body felt leaden and he couldn't tell up from down anymore, let alone who had spoken. For a terrifying moment, he thought it was Riddle's voice. He watched blearily as Theodore carried him into a bedroom and laid him down.
Before Draco knew it, he was wrapped in a group hug and despite his dislike for the worried glances he melted into their comforting embrace. He guessed he really couldn't complain.
"Traitor." Draco stuck his tongue out at him in response and Papá, being the very mature adult he was, returned the favour.
The phone hung up with a quiet click and the prospect of dinner with Harry and his family left him feeling a little fuzzy and warm, a small smile hung on his lips as he set the phone down in favour of finding his parents.
"No. You don't run away. You don't run from me, never me. Tell me what happened."
Harry continued to apologize, his shaking hands grasping blindly at the broken shards. His breathing was coming in short panicked gasps as his body shook furiously.
And they were back to Potter again. Bloody hell.
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his already messy hair. Draco usually loved it when he did that, but right now it just reminded him of the situation he was in.
"Mmm, yeah." He hummed in agreement.
Draco let out a huff and glared up at her annoyingly tall and elaborately decorated ceiling. It was covered in magical paintings of the sky which changed depending on the time of day and weather outside. He watched as the sun glided off to the corner and the moon replaced it, it was beginning to get later than he had planned to stay, but he wasn’t quite finished yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's eyes studied every inch of Draco as he closed his front door. He stood rigidly, warily eyeing the room, scanning his surroundings. He looked tense. Uncomfortable. And Harry badly wanted to be the person that made him feel comfortable.
me, Pans, not while I am this close to hexing you.” He snapped as he fixed her with a cold look and stopped pacing. The words silenced her enough for him to try and collect his thoughts. He stood facing her, hands on his hips as he shook his head in near disbelief, only that was the issue. He
His son nodded mutely but focused his eyes on the floor hoping to avoid Sirius' gaze. It was a bad habit of Draco's. Sirius hated it.
"Have a lovely time trying to deal with Narcissa Black once she hears about all this, I'm sure she'll gladly put the fear of Circe into you herself." Harry laughed coldly, then turned and pulled a stunned Draco towards the hospital wing.
, Harry. Couldn't have given me a little warning could you." Draco laughed breathlessly, sliding off of his lap, his cheeks a darker shade of pink, courtesy of Harry, who only smiled at him innocently.
Draco's face flushed at the words as he stared at her wide-eyed.
Harry chuckled darkly and stilled his hips suddenly. His pet whined piteously and tried to grind down on him. He tutted at him and held him fast before Draco got the chance to. Harry used skilled fingers to untie the red silk around his torso and let it fall away, leaving Draco bare and exposed.
," Harry said his voice reaching a new level of incredulity with every word, "He bloody
"Ron, what-"
“You wanker.” He groused only for Harry to laugh and sit up so they sat Draco straddling his waist and Harry wrapping his arms around the small of his back to keep him from falling.
"That's-that's really amazing, Draco, I'm happy for you." Harry stuttered, a nervous smile playing on his lips, he was hyper-aware of how
Laughter swirled in the room and they all ended up sprawled all along the floor, their heads resting together, making a circle. They stared at Draco's ceiling, a happy feeling floating in the air after the impromptu tickle assault.
"You are my sweet love, my gorgeous pet, my beautiful, clever, and cunning husband. You are my secret keeper, the one who has saved me from myself and others more times than I can count, the one I trust most."
Fuck, he should answer before it went to-the ringing stopped then and Harry was no doubt leaving him another voice mail. He gave it a few seconds and reread the last few messages Pansy and Blaise sent in their group chat, lovingly named
"And don't be daft about it, don't get yourself hurt!" Pansy added quickly as he slipped out the door and headed for the lift once again.
"Bugger
Draco snorted as they interrupted one another once again.
He gave Draco one last meaningful look before pulling him into a sweet kiss. It was soft and slow, so different than their usual clash of tongues and teeth, but held just as much passion and meaning, if not more. He felt Draco's hold on him soften. Hands slipping from the tight hold on his shirt to lace around his neck and tangled in his hair. Harry replaced a hand on his cheek and pulled him closer, tilting his chin to lick into his mouth with a skilled tongue.
The man froze a little and opened his mouth and closed it a couple of times before responding. "I broke a glass. As for the shouting, I wouldn't know anything about that." His voice shook a little and he sounded like he didn't believe himself either.
"Ready?" Draco asked pulling open the door of the restaurant they were meeting everyone at, including two special guests that Pansy and Draco had invited.
"I-no, I'm not...I don't..."
Dudley snorted a little.
"Pansy you absolute trollop! How could you!"
"Just," Draco huffed angrily at the new wave of tears that streamed down his face, "Just hold me for a minute, Harry, please?"
“I think I’ve seen this curse before,” Narcissa said, “but I know neither the incantation, nor the counter-curse. I do remember, however, that it’s not a widely known spell if it is the one I think it is. It— I think it was Severus’ own invention.”
Throwing his arm out towards the door, he flung a silent Accio towards the drawing room upstairs, never ceasing to pour soft healing spells into Severus’ arm. Draco’s puzzled look told him that his behaviour must look odd from the outside, but he couldn’t really bring himself to care right now. With a swoosh, the book came flying into his outstretched hand and Draco jumped, staring wide-eyed at Harry as if he’d suddenly grown another head.
“I’m a light sleeper. Something must’ve woken me up,” he responded nonchalantly, examining his fingernails as if there was nothing of interest going on.
“When you came to Hogwarts, Harry, all I could see was James. I’m not sure you understand just
Despite having seen Draco shirtless plenty of times, Harry raked his eyes appreciatively over the pale chest as if it was completely novel to him. No, he would never get used to that sight, he was sure of it. His gaze travelled up to Draco’s face and found himself breathless as he took in Draco’s flushed cheeks, slightly swollen lips and dishevelled hair.
“Of course I forgive you,” he said. Relief flashed on her face and she smiled again, more genuinely this time.
“Pardon me? Which bet have I supposedly lost?”
Severus hesitated, then, choosing his words carefully, he slowly replied, “I suppose I’m not entirely sure either. I appreciate you as a friend and I would like us to continue to develop that friendship. In your words: I like you, and I’m obviously attracted to you as well. But as you said, it’s difficult sometimes to tell the difference between friendship and romantic feelings.”
“Just take the damn quiz!”
“Er, well— It’s nothing, sir,” said Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blinked at him. “It’s that easy?”
Ron’s face turned crimson and he seemed lost for words. Ginny shot him a reproachful look that made him shrink away from her, and Harry felt a wave of gratitude for her.
in the first place, he was too mortified at the situation to put that down on paper.
“I can’t say for sure when or how it would have happened, but I don’t think I would have stayed loyal to the Dark Lord indefinitely. Looking back, I am appalled that I ever supported such a twisted man, such horrid ideals. When he decided to go after Lily, it opened my eyes to what he truly was. So, as an answer to your question: No, I don’t think I’d be a faithful supporter of the Dark Lord and his goals, but I’m not sure if I’d still be a Death Eater—I’m not sure if I’d have found the strength to leave or to approach Dumbledore, if I’d even have thought of approaching him for help. But I’d like to hope that I would have found a way to break free, somehow.”
“Minerva, what brings you here?” he asked, hoping that his Slytherins hadn’t caused any trouble for him to deal with.
Harry didn’t want him. That was to be expected. No reason to be upset. He’d simply keep his distance from now on, allow the boy to live his life in peace. He could protect him from afar, there was no need for him to be
The door to the potions lab opened and Severus turned to greet Harry, only to find himself looking at Draco instead.
“Relax, close your eyes,” said Snape, and Harry almost laughed. Relaxing was probably the last thing he’d do in Snape’s presence. But he had to learn this, so he forced himself to lean back into the dusty cushions, breathing deeply.
It was a rainy Friday and Harry was meeting Ron and Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron. Remus gave him a cheery smile as they stepped outside into the rain to apparate—they really had to fix the Floo access at Grimmauld Place—and Harry tried to find the same enthusiasm for the day ahead of him. It wasn’t like he hadn’t missed Ron and Hermione, he definitely had, but seeing them meant either confronting a whole slab of uncomfortable topics in public or endure hours of subliminal awkward tension as they all carefully refrained from addressing them. It was impossible to predict which it was going to be—either was equally likely depending on their moods.
“Ready?” called Remus. “On the count of three. One—two—three!”
“So, where does that leave us?” asked Severus.
Two and a half hours later Remus pushed open the door to Severus’ quarters. The rest of the lesson had gone swimmingly, but even though Remus had barely had anything to do except occasionally assisting a few younger students, he was mentally exhausted.
“You went all tense the way you usually do when you’re worrying,” Draco replied, snuggling back into Harry’s side.
know what Harry wants?” Lupin snapped, looking immensely worried.
“Alright,” said Severus, stepping back to where he’d started before, “the team with the last man armed and standing wins.”
“So? I like men, but I also like women. Why are you so sure Sirius didn’t like both, too?”
“It’s not my fault you’re slower than a Flobberworm. Just move your pompous arse so the rest of us can get to the castle
“Sure,” Harry replied with a shrug, gesturing for Severus to lead the way.
Harry tensed instantly, but Narcissa quickly put up her hands trying to appease him.
“You will absolutely not go up there!”
he responded, looking back at Draco.
“It’s alright. You don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to,” he said softly.
He couldn’t keep the sarcasm out of his tone entirely, as much as he tried to, and Hermione’s eyes narrowed slightly.
It was now or never, and suddenly, Draco could barely breathe. If there had ever been a time for some foolhardy Gryffindor courage, it was now.
“Alright then, but please eat while I tell you. You’ll need your strength again soon enough.”
As a result, Harry spent the entirety of Saturday in his dorm, periodically messaging Draco through their linked journals and reading Severus’ old Potions book. His father had grudgingly allowed him to keep it, on the condition that Harry asked him about any spells he found in there before trying them. Most of the notes were things Harry already knew from Severus’ teachings over the summer, but there were more than just a few spells hidden in the margins that he had never heard of before. He assumed that Severus had invented them himself, like he had Sectumsempra.
Dumbledore gave an affirmative nod.
I just had my first exam and need to cheer myself up, so I'm posting this chapter early and hope your reactions do the cheering up. I present to you the longest chapter so far: 5663 words of Drarry crack. You’re welcome.
“With supervision,” Severus snapped.
“Eight minutes,” he declared, setting his wand to buzz after the time was up.
After three days, Draco’s frustration with Potter’s downtrodden mood got the better of him, and he threw a mild stinging-hex at Potter just before the Gryffindor could slip into his bedroom.
“Is that so?” he drawled, growing more irritated by the second. Minerva nodded affirmatively, a smile spreading on her face. “Well, that’s wonderful. Except that it’s clearly not true since James isn’t Potter’s father.”
because Malfoys were part of the absolute elite, he’d promptly been rejected for a goddamn Weasel and a mud— for Granger.
Remus didn’t try to get him to talk as he gulped down a plate of food Narcissa had set aside for him at lunch, along with a piece of chocolate Remus practically forced onto him. The food did help, but it didn’t vanquish the empty feeling in his chest. Nevertheless, he felt considerably better by the time their peace was disturbed by Snape stepping into the kitchen.
“I believe he mentioned renaming it to Defence Association, so it can keep ‘DA’ as its shorthand. Was that all you needed? I was about to leave in order to help Filch at the gate.”
Ron hesitated for another moment, then nodded slowly. “Alright then. Thank you, Harry.”
, Harry thought grudgingly. For some reason he’d been looking forward to entering Severus’ quarters by himself for the first time. But no matter.
The hand around his wrist disappeared and he broke off, scrambling away from it. He staggered backwards into a wall, trying to orient himself.
“Seems like Draco had enough of hiding,” Narcissa said eventually, still chuckling.
“I’m aware that he’s changed quite drastically, but that doesn’t mean we can simply demand to know why. Remember your manners, Draco,” Narcissa admonished.
He grinned at the memory of Umbridge trying and failing to access the headmaster’s quarters. But nevertheless, that didn’t mean that the castle was
(See the end of the chapter for
“You should join the Order,” said Remus.
“I’ll ignore this prophecy business for now, Potter, but don’t think you’re off the hook,” Draco threatened, before continuing in a much warmer tone. “I don’t know much about Sev’s time as a Death Eater, only that my father was somehow involved in recruiting him. What I do know is that Sev is a good man. He’s my godfather, I’m not sure if you knew that already, and he’s been there for me when my actual father wasn’t. Especially since I started at Hogwarts, we’ve grown pretty close. Close enough that I went and asked him for help to run from the Dark Lord—and he didn’t let me down. Yeah, your history with him is very different, and he really doesn’t treat students that aren’t Slytherins very well, but I know him as a good, caring man towards those he values. I think you can trust that he will protect his own, and you are one of his own now. If he still had any feelings of loyalty towards the Dark Lord—which I honestly doubt—they disappeared the moment he realised that you’re his son.”
Professor Sinistra momentarily distracted him as she pulled him into a conversation about the schedule for the third years this term, but before long Minerva involved herself and Severus was free to return his attention to the hall. As his eyes wandered down the Slytherin table once more, an unexpected face made him start a little. Cassius Warrington. Hadn’t the boy graduated at the end of last year? Severus frowned slightly. Could he be the one? He’d have to look into the reasons for Warrington’s return.
from before, but at least he was
“Again, an understatement,” replied Draco, nuzzling closer into him. And Harry had to agree, he was beyond exhausted.
Admittedly, they could’ve talked more if they hadn’t been so busy snogging, but while still trying to prevent anyone from noticing what was going on between them, their time together was already significantly limited and they obviously had to make use of every second to satiate their hunger for each other. Between daily apparition practice followed by duels with Remus in the garden and nightly conversations in his room, daily Occlumency sessions and discussions about healing magic with Severus, as well as the meals Narcissa insisted on, there was barely any time for them to sneak into each other’s rooms without risk of being detected.
of memories that would get them worked up. It was a miracle nobody had noticed anything, especially around the full moon. Once, Harry had almost walked in on them, and they’d only managed to avoid it because Severus had been smart enough to place a ward at the
“That’s Bill,” Harry whispered to Draco, indicating Fleur’s partner. “And that’s Charlie.”
“This is my fault,” he said softly, sounding far more fragile than Harry had ever heard him. Harry frowned again, confused.
“What? Look at him!” Malfoy gestured at him wildly.
“No!” Narcissa objected vehemently. “They’ll take one look at his Dark Mark and send him straight to Azkaban, or worse, they simply refuse treatment and let him die right there.”
“Well, now that that’s done, would anyone care for some birthday cake?”
Draco pulled him tighter against his side.
“Instant Darkness Powder, imported from Peru,” Fred announced proudly. “Dead useful if you need to make a quick disappearance. Twice as effective if used together with a Decoy Detonator.”
“Sir, you have an entire cauldron of Felix Felicis on your desk,” said Harry, doing his best not to let his amusement show. “Why don’t you fill another vial so we can each get one?”
“It’s from Dumbledore, he wants to start our lessons this Saturday already. Right after dinner, at seven.”
, boy oh boy do I have content for you! And for everyone else, I'm getting back to focusing on MTP on November 1, when NaNo starts. (My master thesis internship starts the same day, but I do hope I'll get to write despite that.)
“My apologies,
He forced himself to slow down and draw more air into his lungs. His heart slowly calmed down again as the images faded. He gave Severus a watery smile and picked up his wine glass, taking another sip. The slightly sweet taste of it spread in his mouth, grounding him.
An unbidden pang of jealousy went through Draco, as he realised that he himself had not received such an invitation. But who was he kidding, it was to be expected. His father was a Death Eater and the Malfoy name had suffered greatly from that revelation. Not that Draco cared all that much anymore, but it still stung some deeply ingrained part of him to be overlooked.
“That is none of your business!” he snapped, aware of how all three of them were watching him.
“Were there pretty girls?” she asked eagerly, and Draco had to suppress a snort.
“Bloody brilliant?”
“Severus!” he called again, his voice slightly frantic. “Severus! No, you
“How would I know? I thought he looks like Black when I first saw him, but Lupin insists that that’s impossible. I don’t know who else Lily was close to around that time, we weren’t friends anymore.”
Severus cleared his throat and the boys looked up with matching embarrassed smiles. Rolling his eyes, he made his way over to Sirona.
“I will hex you into next week, Malfoy, if you don’t let me pass.”
“Oh, you’re looking for Harry? Whatever for?” she asked innocently, having schooled her face into a neutral expression.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are not of age yet, I am your mother and you will not argue with me!” Without raising her voice, Narcissa somehow managed to convey an immense amount of authority.
Sirona greeted him with a quiet hiss as he entered the empty dorm, and he gave her an apologetic pat before letting her coil around his arm again. She didn’t like to be left behind, and by now he rarely did; meeting Dumbledore had been somewhat of an exception, and he hadn’t expected to spend all night in the Room of Requirement.
“He’s not really like that, Ron, I’ve told you before.”
Severus watched stone-faced as Potter bolted from the kitchen. Although he was loath to admit it, he wished he could do the same. Wished he could avoid the undoubtedly unpleasant conversation that was bound to unfold.
“Well, it seems he found some charms placed on you, which he removed. You collapsed during the process.”
to learn them in the first place?!”
Running a hand over his face he leaned back in his chair and mentally went over the past week. Three Order meetings, all prompted by Death Eater attacks on public places. Moody was planning raids, Kingsley was trying to gather more support in the Ministry but was met with resistance at every turn. And apparently Rufus Scrimgeour, Fudge’s successor and the new Minister of Magic, was looking for Harry. Remus thanked the gods that they had Grimmauld Place under a Fidelius charm, Harry didn’t need any more nonsense to deal with. Especially since Severus had suddenly decided to retreat back into his shell completely.
“Do you take me for a fool? Of course I know that it has to stay secret. How much detention do you intend to give the poor boy in order to see him?”
He snapped out of it as a tiny second year student squeezed past him and went up to his dorm. Within minutes, he was ready for bed. Ever since Harry and he had started to take their showers together whenever possible, his habit of showering in the evening had been slowly replaced by a preference for morning showers. All Harry’s fault.
“What is it?” one of the twins asked eagerly.
and I apologise for that, uni has been killing me and all my bigger stories were put completely on ice. So, I'm uploading this chapter despite the lack of any progress whatsoever because it's been months and I feel bad for making y'all wait. I still haven't been able to continue, but I hope to get a chance to take a few days to truly sit down and write soon. But for anyone who's getting worried or is losing faith:
He considered going downstairs to find Narcissa, then immediately decided against it. He wouldn’t know what to do if he came face to face with Po— Harry, although he was keenly aware that he couldn’t avoid the boy forever. It would be nearing dinner time soon, which meant he’d have to leave the safety of his room.
“Shit, Harry, where did you get these?!”
With a sigh, he checked the time. Just a little over eight o’clock. The moon would be up soon, and if Harry’s earlier insistence was any indication, only strong wards would keep the boy from potentially risking his neck just to keep Remus company. Even though Remus trusted the Wolfsbane potion—even the dose that the boys had finalised—for the most part, there was always a risk that something went wrong. He had come close to hurting Harry once before, he didn’t intend to do it again.
And just like that, Remus’ anger melted away. Damn the man and his ability of being so damn
“I was weak, I can admit that by now. I was hoping to gain the Dark Lord’s favour, hoping that he could open doors for me, provide opportunities I would never get on my own. This way of thinking is what ultimately made me tell him about the prophecy I had overheard. But even back then, even as I told him about it, I had my doubts about supporting him, doubts that began long before but were overpowered by the influence of my surroundings. They were, however, slowly growing stronger—because of Lily. Because of that night she came to see me, to say goodbye. The night you—”
The worst part by far was that he’d found himself intrigued by this new version of Potter. His behaviour hinted at elaborate thought going on behind those green eyes that looked so much like Lily’s.
“Darling, do you mean to tell me that your earlier claim that Harry never owned his own clothes before was
He read over the letter twice, overall quite satisfied with the outcome. It hinted at big news, which was hopefully enough to somewhat prepare her for the impending shockers, while not making it sound negative. It was as good as it got, and with a little luck, she’d be distracted by his sudden interest in healing and runes and arithmancy. Perhaps that would be the biggest shock of all for her.
“No?” Harry grinned. “Too bad, Tonks is cool.”
“Draco insisted on brewing me a shampoo,” Severus replied, willing the blush rising on his cheeks to go away with little success.
I hope you like the little dose of Draco-Severus content :)
The First Wizarding War. That’s what they called it now, twenty years later. As if it had always been clear that there would be a second one. But they hadn’t known, had they? Nobody had told them that You-Know-Who would fall, only to rise again. Well, there was the prophecy. Even back then, there had been a lot of speculation about this supposed Chosen One, and when Albus Dumbledore had eventually approached the Potters, advising them to go into hiding, they had all assumed they would stay in hiding for years, until their child was grown.
The class stilled immediately, heads turning towards the two men staring each other down. In that moment, Draco couldn’t help but feel that their relation should be plainly visible to anyone who looked at them. They were the same height, had the same high cheekbones, the same sharp jawline. Suddenly he was glad that his mother had cut Harry’s hair short, it’d be even more obvious otherwise.
Harry was left sitting alone with Narcissa, an awkward silence settling over them. It made him feel antsy and he began to fiddle with the lid of the teapot to keep his hands occupied.
Ah, so that’s what this was really about. Perhaps it was time they talked about that, too.
“But—”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry gasped.
Draco’s mind is reeling, looking for an excuse and coming up empty. He only stares, wide-eyed and increasingly panicked because he has to do
Harry nodded sheepishly. Bill let out a whistle, looking amazed.
“The room’s ‘abilities’?” Dumbledore raised a questioning eyebrow at him.
After a few seconds, Narcissa ended the spell with a silent flick of her wand, while Draco murmured a Finite to make his core disappear again.
Narcissa laughed. “Have you ever prepared food for fourteen people?”
“Me too,” Harry agreed. “But we don’t have a choice, do we? It’s only a matter of time until people figure out why I’ve changed so much since the end of last year, and we’re relying on everyone believing that I don’t know who my real father is.”
Draco looked aghast and opened his mouth multiple times as if to interrupt, but Harry never gave him a chance. Now that he had started, he had to finish.
“Are you telling me you’re not even going to comment on his new look?”
“Sounds like I won’t have much to do,” said the man.
Feeling dizzy, he sank down onto the bed. He couldn’t grasp a clear thought, it was all too much. Who would put such charms on him? And why?
Severus whirled around to see Harry standing in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest and his face set in a stubborn mask, Draco and Narcissa standing a few steps behind him.
“I custom ordered them,” he grinned.
“Good night.”
He eyed her suspiciously, but eventually gave in. There was no point in trying to deny Minerva McGonagall. “The day before her wedding. She came to say goodbye, after that I never saw her again. Still, we weren’t
she said, and promptly slid down Harry’s arm and towards her basket.
child?
The fourth floor turned out to be by far the neatest, with Remus residing in Sirius’ old room that had been entirely refurbished. The empty bedroom next to it was just as clean and organised, as if waiting for its inhabitant to arrive any minute.
“Sirona?” Harry repeated questioningly.
“They’re Slytherins, Death Eater children,” spat McLaggen and several others made agreeing noises.
Harry’s potion hissed, signalling that it was time to add the Sopophorous Bean juice. He took his silver knife that he’d bought at Severus’ insistence and crushed the bean to get the juice.
For a long while they sat in silence, each caught up in their own thoughts. Severus’ mind was racing. Potter—
son. Sirius loved Harry because of who he was. Sure, their relationship might have started because Sirius was his godfather because James made him that, but it ultimately developed on its own.”
“Fuck,” Severus hissed before he could catch himself.
“Wotcher, Harry! Blimey, you look even more different than the last time I saw you,” she said with open amazement, before quickly adding, “Handsome, though! It’s a good look on you.”
“May I, Mr …?”
Draco wished he could see Harry’s face, as the Gryffindor huffed in mock annoyance, clearly embarrassed. He laughed softly, but was cut off by Harry suddenly pushing him onto his back, hovering above him.
“I’m glad you worked things out with him,” said Remus, keeping his voice calm. “Now would you care to explain to me what the
Albus took that in calmly, barely showing any reaction at all.
about Harry? Now that he thought about it, he imagined to remember that Draco had reacted almost immediately when Harry had almost collapsed after healing Severus earlier. Remus had been so focused on the man that he had barely payed any attention to Draco.
“I’m sure, mate, really. Please, keep it.”
I’m sorry. 😬
Again, Draco kept his mouth shut, even though after what he’d heard from Harry he was fairly sure he knew exactly what Slughorn wanted Blaise for.
Conclusion number one: His father hated him.
“And you trust that?” Draco sounded doubtful and Harry frowned again.
“Yes, I’m fine,” he responded automatically, but as soon as the words were out, he hesitated. “Actually, I was thinking about what Harry and Narcissa told earlier, about how Harry healed me. I feel like I remember…
Earlier in the week they’d already had half a fight because Harry had to tell her not to stare at Draco so obviously. She hadn’t taken it particularly well.
Hermione sucked in a sharp breath. “A
“Aren’t you tired?” Remus eyed him with a hint of concern.
“Harry, I need you to come with me, okay? Can you follow me? Just keep breathing and follow me, love.”
, not the main thing. He turned to Harry, counting on his boyfriend to support him, but instead Harry’s expression was grim and thoughtful.
“Harry doesn’t approach magic like you do—like
Draco tuned out the ensuing conversation during which Daphne resolutely refused to reveal her latest boyfriend’s name while Pansy and Blaise kept pestering her. His thoughts went back to the DA and Theo’s unexpected support for Harry.
“Then no.”
Remus hoped that his smile came across as reassuring, but in reality he himself was not entirely sure time would be enough for Harry. There seemed to be so much standing between them, so much history, so much mistrust and anger. But looking at Severus, Remus could see that the man really wanted to try his best. He just hoped that Harry would once more prove how kind he was and give Severus a real chance, eventually. The boy clearly had a lot of healing to do. Who could blame him?
So he did.
“But there’s nobody else!”
Despite this first step, though, our boys shall continue to take it slow.
“Git,” said Harry, shoving him playfully. “Seriously, though, what do you mean? They’re all simple spells, why
“You’re right, I hadn’t considered that. What did you have in mind?”
Catching Draco’s eyes for a split-second to see the mirth reflected in them, Harry went back to his station and began to clean up.
Feeling guilty, he pulled out some parchment and began to write, only to feel stuck immediately. What the hell was he supposed to tell them? He couldn’t very well break the news that he was Severus Snape’s son in a bloody
“Good night, Draco.”
Lupin laughed while Severus’ insides turned to ice. Could it be? Would Lily really have an affair with this
“Draco willingly went near a transformed werewolf?! He’s
“Because he brought Harry there.”
She stared at him, utter shock written on her face. “You can’t be serious.”
fancy yourself clever, you drop this now and forever,” growled Severus.
Harry looked taken aback.
Nevertheless, he forced himself to break the seal and pull out the letter, unfolding it with slightly shaking hands.
Severus nodded, his mind racing to try and find a solution. He couldn’t abandon the potion. If he did, all the effort that had gone into brewing over the past week would be for naught. Remus
Severus drew a sharp breath and his eyes fluttered open. Relief crashed into Harry as black eyes found his. His vision went slightly blurry as he blinked back tears, still gripping Severus’ hand tightly.
“Come on, Draco, your mother will have breakfast ready soon.” He pulled the blanket down.
Nevertheless, while the book was certainly interesting, it seemed far beyond Harry’s skill-level, and he wanted to understand what he was doing, rather than just blindly learn spells. He opted for a bigger book, whose title sounded somewhat broader—
Narcissa laughed softly, and she must’ve signalled her permission somehow, because there were once again steps coming up the stairs, without halting this time, until they stopped right in front of Remus’ room. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, very slowly, the door was pushed open, revealing the silhouette of a noticeably tense Draco Malfoy. Remus heard him inhale sharply, as he took in the scene before him, with Harry curled up against Remus’ side, the large wolf wrapped around him protectively.
The quiet hiss from behind him made Harry turn around to see Sirona slithering towards him. He held out his arm for her to coil around his wrist.
By the time he was able to focus on the meeting, the Dark Lord was already in the middle of a rant. Something had gone wrong, some mission inside the Ministry failed. Severus suppressed a groan. It had only been a month since Harry had derailed the Dark Lord’s plans and his mood had been downright foul ever since.
“Done,” Draco confirmed, taking one last look at himself in the mirror.
A gentle hand settled on his shoulder and he glanced up to see Narcissa looking at him with an expression of grim determination. Her lips quirked into a half-smile as she told him, “I know I haven’t been in your life for very long, Harry, but my son holds you very dear, and I’ve grown to do the same. Anyone who tries to harm either of you will have to go through me.”
Severus relaxed. Not that bad then. He motioned Narcissa to continue.
found you interesting. I already told you that I was jealous of your friends. I always wanted you in some way.”
“We can’t just skip days,” Severus replied, and Harry thought he almost heard a plea in his voice.
“There’s nothing to be done about it,” he said, stirring the potion twice and setting his wand to buzz in precisely six minutes.
“Sectumsempra!”
By the end of second year Draco couldn’t ignore anymore that he disagreed with his father’s ideologies. The desire to please him hadn’t lessened in the least, despite Draco’s inner conflict. So he’d kept up his perfect pure-blood mask, his air of superiority, his shield of hostility; kept everyone out, denying that he didn’t really want to be like this at all. He had teased and bullied, out of jealousy and desperation, hoping his father would eventually be satisfied.
Severus replied, “She’s been arrested, actually, for the mistreatment of students, abuse of a position of power, and use of an Unforgivable Curse on Miss Edgecombe.”
“Your mind is still recovering from the Dark Lord’s possession of you. It would be utterly pointless to have you attempt that now,” he drawled.
Resting their foreheads together, they just held each other’s gaze for a moment, then Harry whispered, “What would I do without you?”
“No, no, you’re absolutely right, Harry. Really, without you we never would’ve managed to get the shop. We’ll figure it out next time, alright?” said Fred.
Remus smiled, but his eyes had turned oddly sad.
Harry couldn’t remember to ever have been happier than he was now, standing in his kitchen with his tear-streaked face buried in Severus’ shoulder.
“Well, there’s a little more to it, but essentially, yes,” Severus replied.
“It’s not impossible,” Minerva insisted, emptying her glass as well before standing up.
“Then why is he suddenly shutting me out the
He held himself back at the last second.
“What is it?” asked Harry, mildly irritated by her attitude.
“You— Are you saying we have to keep our entire relationship a secret?!” Draco cried incredulously. “We’ll barely be able to see each other!”
“That’s brilliant!”
Yay, updates! Narcissa sure is quite a woman, isn't she?
But today, Draco had been different. Angrier, rawer. The look he’d given Harry when he’d come up those stairs had been such an unlikely mix of anticipation, heat, and—oddly—
Term was only one more week, maybe Ron and Hermione could visit him on their way home. He longed to talk to them about—
“I’ll just go change out of my school robes,” he says. He needs a minute to compose himself.
Dumbledore chuckled. “Of course, seven thirty then. Will you inform Remus? I believe he will travel by Floo.”
Severus smiled mildly.
She smiled sadly. “Because of Draco, of course. Even though Lucius never had any interest to be with me—or any woman, if you understand what I’m saying—he needed to produce an heir. Right after our wedding Lucius consummated our marriage once, magically ensuring that I would give him a male heir. If I had left him, he’d have kept Draco from me, and I could never have abandoned my son.”
Ginny left only a few minutes later to check whether Dean and Seamus were done with their argument. The rest of them fell into an easy conversation about classes and Quidditch, until the compartment door slid open once more, this time revealing a nervous looking third-year girl who apparently had a note for both Harry and Neville. It was an invitation from Slughorn.
to talk to him, he doesn’t want to speak to me!”
“What did she say?” asked Draco, as Harry shifted closer to him.
“Blaise! Merlin’s beard, don’t sneak up on me like that,” Draco complained, snapping the notebook closed. “Is your lunch with this Slughorn person over already?”
Draco just stared at Harry at a loss for words. That’s what he’d been doing these past few days?
“Narcissa planned it to be ‘open ended’ if I recall correctly,” said Remus.
“I know, sorry. I know. I just hate it.”
“And you couldn’t go to your own room?” Ron snapped, still obviously unhappy about Draco’s presence. Draco flinched slightly, but before he could even begin to move away, Harry tightened his arm around him, pulling him closer.
“No, not in front of the boys,” she declared firmly.
Harry wrestled with conflicting urges inside him. Part of him wanted to bolt, didn’t want to know, wanted to get away and be alone and comfort himself with Sirius’ things. And yet another, smaller part of him was buzzing with anticipation. He might have a father, a living parent, right in front of him.
“I’ll be there before you miss me.”
“So?” asked Harry, who had settled into his chair again, as soon as Severus was served. “What is it you need to tell us?”
He couldn’t afford to lose his cool now.
Before his anxiety could talk him out of it, he resolutely put the pyjamas back into the drawer and simply stripped down to his pants instead before crawling into bed and casting a privacy charm in Sirona’s direction. No need for a baby snake to see…things. Potentially. Maybe.
Draco’s eyes flew open at the unexpected touch even as it sent a shiver through his body. The heat in his stomach flared. His hands were still moving of their own accord, still stuck on the task of pulling Harry towards him even though Draco’s mind was thoroughly distracted by the lack of fabric under his fingers as they slid further around Harry’s waist towards his back—and stilled suddenly. A tight knot of tension coiled rapidly inside Draco’s chest.
“No, please, you don’t have to do that. Just look for the things you wanted to buy for yourselves. I really don’t need a lot,” he assured, but Draco’s mother dismissed it with a wave of her hand.
Ron’s eyes widened, then narrowed in suspicion. Harry pushed his book further towards him and turned to look at Slughorn, who had just finished to introduce himself.
Draco blushed further and shook his head, causing Harry to chuckle again.
“Furthermore,” Minerva continued, her voice gaining a careful undertone now, “I couldn’t help but see some…resemblance to someone else in his new face, a resemblance I would have expected you to notice as well.”
Harry’s eyes flew from Narcissa to Snape and back again. “See
“I’m already in a bad mood,” Draco grumbled.
Ron looked shocked. “You didn’t actually go to Sn—”
canon plot I’ll reiterate again:
For a moment, Remus was frozen, then his anger returned. In two strides he was at the door, ripping it open to reveal a wary looking Severus. The sight of so much caution in his face took Remus aback and he was able to rein in his anger a little.
“Well, what’s the point of the DA when we have proper Defence classes again? If we get an actual teacher, that is. In any case, don’t you think Dumbledore will want a reason?”
When the realisation that he might have a crush on Draco hit the first time, Harry had pushed it away immediately, because that was just
“You can’t—”
“He doesn’t have the ring anymore. The aurors took it when they arrested him. As I am his wife, his possessions were given to me when he was sent to Azkaban. The ring is with me, he has no chance of finding us.”
“Must’ve been some powerful charms if messing with them knocked me out cold,” said Harry, frowning.
“Harry, look at me.”
“Certainly,” Albus agreed, his eyes twinkling with excitement.
. Naked. Remus could feel himself flush bright red. Gods, what was wrong with him? He’d never been the type to be shy, especially not around a full moon. And it wasn’t like Severus would give a second thought to what he’d seen, the man was straight.
Remus hesitated and Severus raised an inquisitive eyebrow at him. With a sigh, Remus relented.
Gratitude and stubborn petulance warred in Draco. “That’s not— I mean, thank you, really; I’d love to come for dinner with you two. But you understand that having dinner with my boyfriend and his father once in a while is not what I’m talking about. I want to spend time with Harry alone, talking, practising spells, reading, cuddling—none of which I’ll be able to do anymore once we leave Grimmauld Place.”
“That doesn’t make him trustworthy,” Ron retorted.
“Can you forgive me?”

Albus sighed.

“What the
Harry gave a hollow laugh. He wished he could believe that. Not wanting to think about the prophecy anymore, he began to devour the pancakes Narcissa had served. For a while, neither of them spoke.
Harry’s sleep-addled brain was too slow for his mouth. “Yes?”
“Are you saying you are Lord Black
“Why, Potter, that is positively Slytherin, didn’t know you had it in you,” drawled Draco, his tone belying the flicker of delight he felt.
Severus merely shook his head. “You saw his reaction,” he said, gesturing towards the stairs.
“Because this is your house,” she replied with a smile. “Its servants should obey you. Not that they wouldn’t have obeyed you either way, but this way your word is stronger than that of other people—besides mine that is. But I doubt you and I will ever give them such contradictory orders that this would become an issue.”
Who was alive.
“Hear me out, please. While Potter resides there it can’t be used as headquarters, not until he has mastered Occlumency. The house is big enough to room four people without issue, and Narcissa would feel somewhat at home. If we make her feel welcome she might be a useful ally in this war, and the same goes for Draco. The boy is talented, and quite powerful, too.” He frowned slightly. “There is, of course, the issue of Draco and Potter being rather at odds with each other, but I believe with Narcissa there to control Draco it’s manageable. It’s the safest place for them, probably the only safe place at all.”
Why would you treat him like that? I swear to Merlin if you don’t
Severus thanked him and left, making his way to his quarters quickly. Unsurprisingly, he found Draco pacing back and forth in his sitting room, flinching slightly when Severus entered.
“Sorry, it’s just that Kreacher doesn’t really like me. Or anyone. It seems you’re an exception, probably because you’re all pure-blooded and a Black and all that.”
Draco inhaled sharply, terror flitting over his features. Harry’s face betrayed no reaction at all, but he did reach out to Draco, taking his hand and giving it a squeeze. If Albus was surprised by that, he didn’t show it.

Severus lifted his head and looked at him sadly.
“Passively supervising. Your plan is wonderful, cub, you won’t need me.”
“You can
“Yes,” he finally bit out reluctantly.
Draco laughed and shook his head.
“I have no idea how to be a father,” he whispered.
He got out of bed and turned towards his trunk to pull out fresh clothes, before quickly getting showered and brushing his teeth. His stomach was rumbling. Time for breakfast, no matter what hour it actually was.
“It’s hard, I know. But if it’s any consolation, your little performance at the gate was remarkable. If I hadn’t known, I would’ve believed it was real.”
Severus gave him a crooked smile. “Well, not a lot, but I did apologise. He—” The smile widened. “He asked if he can call me Dad from now on.”
Harry also knew how to decipher his moods by now, could tell when Draco tensed up or retreated behind his defences. Most of all, though, he knew so much more about what Draco truly thought about things. The day after Dumbledore had unexpectedly shown up at Grimmauld and Harry had revealed his past with the Dursleys, Draco had told him about his own childhood before coming to Hogwarts. About how Lucius had raised him to be the perfect Malfoy heir, disregarding almost all of Draco’s needs and wishes. Harry had simply listened, holding back any comments, so as to avoid derailing the conversation into something it wasn’t supposed to be. That talk had been about Draco and Draco alone. It all made a lot more sense now.
“Make them obey me,” he clarified.
Walburga was still ranting into the icy silence in the entrance hall. Seemingly having recovered from her shock, Mrs Malfoy held up her palms appeasingly and pointed at the portrait.“Would you like me to quiet her for you, Mr Potter?”
“Harry? What’s going on?” she asked gently.
was just exaggerating with the whole ‘Chosen One’ business,” Hermione breathed, her eyes wide.
Harry was watching him calmly, his face impassive.
But Draco didn’t stop. No, Draco seemed to redouble his efforts after this first encounter, despite Harry’s ongoing outwards indifference. And Harry found himself appreciating it, in a twisted sort of sense. While Remus was trying to give him both space and caring attention, Narcissa had firmly retreated between invisible rules of conduct keeping a polite distance, and Sna—
“Harry!” George flung his arm around Harry’s shoulders, apparently having escaped from his mother. “We’ve been looking everywhere for you, follow me!” And with that he pulled him away. Harry stumbled after George who turned their slow struggle through the shop into somewhat of a tour, pointing out their different product ranges. All of a sudden, the mass of people thinned as George pulled him into a much more muted room at the back of the shop where Fred seemed to be waiting for them.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” he murmured, before planting a firm kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco felt him smile and relaxed. They could still tease and quip at each other, that was good.
“He was my godfather because he was James’ best friend. He never would’ve been if Mum hadn’t concealed who my real father is. He never would’ve had any reason to like me or care for me.”
Everything felt different, somehow. His physique hadn’t changed as drastically as his face, he was still lean and rather skinny, but his shoulders seemed a little broader.
Harry was taken aback. “Legilimency? Why?”
“Never mind,” said Draco, taking a deep breath and reminding himself that Harry’s approach to magic just was like that. “Legilimency — why Legilimency?”
With a start, Remus realised that he had the house to himself. Risky, foolish ideas began to form in the back of his mind, and he willed them away forcefully. He would absolutely
“Not to worry, child, you have not offended me. I shall remember you, Harry Potter.”
“Precisely. We shall accompany him on official business,” said Dumbledore, gesturing for Harry to stand and step closer to the Pensieve he’d placed on the desk. He pulled out a small bottle filled with a silvery substance. He handed it to Harry, who removed the stopper and poured it into the Pensieve.
“Have you talked to him yet?” Remus asked. “About your history with each other? About the prophecy?”
“Or he might not,” Moody said grimly. “You heard Severus; he looks just like Sirius. Sirius died last night.”
Remus watched him patiently.
They duelled like this for a good while, longer than usual if Remus’ perception of time was any good. Either having the high ground really made a pronounced difference, or Harry was holding back. Remus suspected the latter.
Moving slowly, he got off the bed, carefully steadying himself on the wall. He hadn’t eaten in a while, and a wave of dizziness washed over him as he stood up. When it had subsided, he noticed that he was wearing fresh pyjamas. His robes must’ve been in shreds, which meant that— He felt a blush creep up his neck. They’d probably had to undress him to treat his wounds.
When he’d questioned his mother about it, she’d merely claimed that she didn’t know who Severus was working with to keep them all hidden here. Draco would bet his money on Dumbledore. Who else would dare to stand up to the Dark Lord?
He had just flipped it open, when Blaise’s voice made him jump in surprise. “What are you doing?”
, and yet it was only half of the room. Granted, the room was big, but the dimensions of it still felt off, as if the left side couldn’t possibly be the same size as the right; and yet it was.
Slowly, so as to avoid spooking Draco, Remus lifted his head to nudge Draco’s arm. It was as much as he could do right now to show the boy that he was accepted here. Draco’s eyes widened as they met Remus’, but he didn’t shy back in fear. Instead, he remained for another moment, his gaze travelling back to Harry, then he turned and left much more swiftly than he had entered.
Like the prophecy.
Harry followed her gaze and his insides tightened a little. Ollivander’s store front was in shambles, broken glass littering the floor behind the windows, the door hanging lopsided from its hinges. Even if he hadn’t already known, anyone could see that Ollivander had not closed and left his shop willingly.
“Why don’t you take mine?” He pushed his brand new book towards Ron, grabbing the battered old copy from the cupboard in turn.
“Feel free to guess away,” Harry snapped. “It’s not like I suddenly resemble my real father perfectly, like I did with Da— James. The only reason why I looked so much like him is because it wasn’t actually real. My mother did a thorough job when she put those charms on me.”
“Is there anything to report regarding our old friend, Dumbledore?” the Dark Lord asked coolly, his voice sending a shiver down Severus’ spine.
The page was covered in notes, all in the same cramped handwriting as the ones on the Draught of Living Death pages. He scanned over it and sure enough, the very first instruction of the textbook was circled and annotated—and the note matched what Severus had taught them, as did the next one, and the one after that.
Draco snaked his slender piano fingers around Harry's chin, making him look up and meet his eyes.
"You, Harry James Potter, are the bravest, kindest, most beautiful person I have ever met and I forgive you."
And he's right. Draco would kill them and every other nasty Death Eater if he could. He would fight them with everything he had if he could. Throw every dark and dangerous curse that Aunt Bella taught him right back at her and revel in her suffering for what they did. Draco can feel the anger thrum under his skin but it simmers down into anguish again with the way Harry sighs. The way his pretty face smiles at him mournfully.
Harry's voice cut into his thoughts then. He sounded nothing if not determined.
Harry looked away from him and seemed to shrink in on himself at the question. He said nothing and Draco took that as his answer. He stifled a sigh and put his hands in his pockets, bouncing on the balls of his feet. He couldn't imagine how Harry must be feeling. It must be awful and he must be terrified.
Riddle.
It was bloody Potter. The other boys stood looking just about ready to maul Blaise. Potter's eyes were alight with something akin to murder and attack. His hands clenched into fists at his sides. The unasked for show of bravado that he was supplying left Draco feeling exasperated, his good mood souring. Apparently, Potter was set on nannying him in his own driveway as well.
"But the both of you need to quit making the other feel responsible for your feelings. I am going to get grey hairs from trying to keep myself composed as well as you both. And I will not handle it well if you two decide to send each other into depressive episodes. I care far too much about you both for any of that. Alright?"
"And nothing!" Harry bellowed, silencing the rat-faced man, who looked cowed by his outburst, "You forget yourself, Pettigrew. I am your
how many of your
“Firewhiskey?” Harry asked as he stood collecting their rubbish from the dinner they'd eaten. He figured the alcohol might make this easier on both of them. Ron shot him a nervous look and nodded in response.
"But-but Papá!"
Knows that if he ever asks, Harry will frown and get that painfully endearing confused look on his face and answer back with a question of his own.
"I couldn't hate you, mate. You were my first friend ever, you fought alongside me through a war, you even pushed me to go after Draco despite everything he’d done to you and your family. I couldn’t hate you, Ron.” Harry said calmly, patting his shoulder. He wished Ron would just come out and say it. This amping it up was making him anxious.
Harry grinned at him and pulled him into another hot kiss.
"Oi! Fuck off." Harry replied, his words lacking any of the anger. He stuck his tongue out at all of them. They would know about being whipped, wouldn't they, always tangled up in each other. Draco laughed prettily into his chest and he couldn't help but feel giddy at the prospect of what was to come.
“Do you even regret it? Feel the slightest bit guilty, anything?” Draco asked weakly, collapsing into one of her many armchairs, propping his legs up onto the arm and leaning his back up against the other. He gave her an imploring look while she raised a perfectly shaped eyebrow at him.
"Where are my shoes?" Draco asked stumbling to his feet, patting down his jeans for his phone. His limbs still felt wrong and his hands were still shaky but he had to leave. He had to go home. Oh God, Papá would be worrying himself sick by now.
"I can't believe you right now.
He tuned into Lucius Malfoy's shouting then, his voice rising even louder than before. It bounced and echoed throughout the courtyard, grating Harry's nerves.
"I know. It's alright." Luna said lightly, finally releasing Draco, and rubbing her hands up and down his arms comfortingly. "I know, Dray."
"Would you mind if we continue this another time? Perhaps we could grab lunch tomorrow?"
I don't need some overly protective dimwit harassing me! Yet there he is every bloody day walking me home because I refuse to get in his car! And if that wasn't irritating enough, he even sent his minions to essentially stalk me at school when he can't. I wouldn't mind Hermione if she didn't constantly drool over Weasley, which she does. Such a disappointment really, she's quite brilliant while that ginger-haired heathen is a complete menace to society. We came here so I could get a little peace, heaven forbid that ever happens thanks to Potter and his mongrels!"
"I know, I know, it'll be alright." Remus shushed him, pressing soft kisses to his mouth and wiping tears from his face he hadn't noticed yet.
"Uh... so, how do you know each other?" Ron asked. Draco jumped a little at the voice then flushed pink and stepped away from Luna.
Remus only smiled at him sadly and swiped a few tears away. He pressed a firm kiss to his lips.
"They...I was supposed to be their nephew, but instead, I was sort of like their house elf. They used-used to make me do all sorts of work, the cooking and cleaning usually. If I...if I ever um burned the food or broke a-a dish, they'd yell and they'd-they'd h-hit me or-or..."
