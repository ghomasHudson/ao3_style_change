“Still on the fence with you,” Weasley says lowly, turning his glare now towards Draco, who gives him a dry look before pulling out a bag of PopRocks from his bag and holding them out in silence. Weasley eyes them dubiously, before growling and snatching the bag away. “A short fence,” he amends grumpily as he opens the bag.
“Let me get this straight, Miss--”
” comes a voice to their right and, abruptly, fake-Moody is being knocked to the side, stunned, as Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius, and McGonagall come rushing at them.
Draco could smack himself when he finally realizes what he’d missed. Of course. He’d forgotten the most important factor that played into most everything this school year. Umbridge.
But has he really? He essentially ran into an active war zone with a bunch of his friends, who are as much inexperienced teenagers as he is, with a plan he sorted out as he got there, and then ended up being stuck as a cat majority of the time without the ability to cast spells. The Order showed up, anyway. Couldn’t Draco have just stayed out of it, left the professionals one less idiot kid to worry about? They would have shown up, saved the day, and Draco could have welcomed them all back with a snarky comment about checking with the Order first next time.
Umbridge curses under her breath, looking around again at the empty space. “Miss. Parkinson!” she snaps, apparently finally calmed down enough for words, “Tell Mr. Filch to keep a particular eye on the Astronomy Tower from here on out. I want these hooligans caught! The rest of you! Search the castle. They couldn’t have gotten far.”
“How are we supposed to find all of these quickly?” Draco demands, also trying to spot anything.
“JORDAN!”
“You are,” Draco tries to assure, but Harry’s smile has turned sad again. They both know that isn’t entirely true. Draco trusts Harry more than anyone, save maybe Max, but the Slytherin is wound tight. He keeps things close to his chest and while there’s plenty he’s shared with Harry he wouldn’t with anyone else, that didn’t mean he was perfectly capable of letting go. Not the ugly parts of himself that he hated. Not the parts that hurt more than they healed when he let them out.
“No, I do not, George,” says the one named Fred. Lovely. At least Draco had names for this particular conversation. “Especially since the dreadful Miss. Skeeter mentioned him by name.”
Draco’s body goes still at the seemingly casual comment, fingers freezing where he’d been picking at them, and gaze going unfocused. After a beat, the tense atmosphere very swiftly returning to the room, Draco’s eyes snap up to Granger’s, expression blank. “Umbridge was with me the entire time last night. I didn’t have an opportunity to take anything without being seen. I assumed you took it when you erased her memory.”
“Don’t jest with us, child,” Lucius snarls, the first signs of anger that Draco is seeing, and the hand around his wand tightens dangerously. “That prophecy pertains to you, too. You think we don’t know you’d want that? You think us fool enough to believe you so selfless?”
“You started falling and… I saw a figure standing over Vivian’s body. They must have been jinxing your broom, and that would need direct eye contact so I just… reacted,” Harry says and Draco begins to notice the shake in his own voice. Maybe the arm around his shoulder isn’t just for his own benefit…
by Agatha Christie, 1933.”
“Correct. Five points to Gryffindor,” Sinistra says simply and Hermione lets out a sigh of relief. “What are the origins of the name ‘Astronomy’?” Oh, she wasn’t messing around, was she? She was just jumping right into the next question.
Slowly, like he might spook an animal, Draco backs away, shimmying around the table until he can sit at a seat farthest from Granger. He still wanted to keep some of his pride, and that meant sitting at the table he’d originally wanted, but he was going to make sure he had a clear path to the exit if Granger snapped any further.
The Gryffindors all look to be a mix of furious and terrified, but the Slytherins are a different story. Millicent, Warrington, Montague, and Verteaux look gleeful - giddy in a disturbing way that Draco hates - but the rest? Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle are painfully still, their expressions blank, but that’s probably more telling than anything.
The Slytherin common room greets them and Draco feels an immediate kinship to it. It is large, with a high, curved ceiling, walls made of rough stone, and decorated with tapestries and paintings of Medieval events and people of Slytherin. Orbs made of glass hang from chains all over the room and green light emanates from them while a massive fireplace sits off to the left, crackling with a fire that warms Draco’s bones, and a Slytherin emblem sits atop it.
Umbridge arches a brow just as Luna shrieks, “DUCK!”

“But what is
“Uhg, dad,” Eric groans, clearly embarrassed by whatever his father must have done, and Draco smirks, momentarily glad he can’t see the man’s antics.
“Yes, I was there,” Draco says, trying to sound sarcastic, but his smile is uncontrollable by this point. Mostly, he’s relieved to not been kicked out of school, but it does sound exciting, and Harry’s energy is infectious. “I hardly know anything about it, though,” he admits at length, shrugging, a broom in both hands. Hermione had lectured so much about it before their flying class that Draco had tuned her out for most of it. Now he wishes he’d listened more.
“Your father has proven himself to be a failure to the Dark Lord,” Bellatrix had scoffed, sneering at a family portrait on the wall, particularly at Lucius. Draco stands where he’d been left, unmoving, unthinking, probably not even breathing. “Prestige in the name, but not in the name… But the Dark Lord, in his eternal mercy, has given you the opportunity to… reestablish the family name.”
Draco eventually moves on to another Charms book Hermione had, curiously going over each spell he found, wondering what the limits of this magic may be, and Hermione moves to a book on the history of Hogwarts. While Draco was interested on what they could eventually do, it seemed Hermione was interested in what had already been done. He supposes she wants to get a better foothold in this Wizarding World, and so does Draco, but he figures they could always do that later.
“Are you afraid of something, little dragon?” Narcissa asks softly, a hand brushing away some of Draco’s bangs.
McGonagall’s expression didn’t change at first, but her lips did thin. She looked particularly unhappy and Draco wondered if he had said the wrong thing. “How much do you know of your past?” she questions instead of answering and it makes the young boy angry. That wasn’t what he wanted to hear.
Draco scoffs at that, snarling and looking away. “She fucking should be,” he snarls, ignoring the frowns some of the others send him and instead glaring down at his lap. He had no patience for the students that had sided with the Ministry. He didn’t care what they believed or what their parents said, the Ministry had been monsters and they should have known better. He didn’t care if that made him seem harsh. They’d laid the clues in all the articles they’d published, Harry and Dumbledore had explicitly said the truth, Umbridge had made everyone in this school miserable, and all of it had been ignored in favor of flimsy comforts.
“These people are dirty and dangerous. They want to disrupt the traditions long kept sacred by my ancestors. They--“
He hears very distant footsteps, far enough away not to be a worry, but definitely making their way towards them.
Draco stares back, frozen, but then Harry is breaking away and moving towards him at a march. Draco hops down, shifts back into a human, and then has his arms full of Harry.
Draco blinks slowly, staring at Harry, before he’s smirking. “You really do have a hero complex, don’t you?”
“Did he now?” twin two questions, pretending to sound intrigued.
Potter tightens up, hands squeezing Draco’s hand and shoulder, his head pressing into Draco’s shoulder a tiny bit more forcefully before he loosens with a deep sigh. “I’ll tell you…” he begins after a few beats, “If you tell me why you were up here.”
“I honestly think she’d be something like…” Weasley begins, hands flailing a little as he tries to think, “You know those massive pythons?”
After walking what felt like the entire Ministry, stressing over getting caught, getting roared at by a dinosaur, getting soaked, nearly getting struck by lightning, getting soaked again, and dealing with everything Weasley… Draco was ready for a nice, long nap. A shower first did sound nice, but definitely a quick one, and then he was getting some rest. He could proofread his notes and send them off to Skeeter later.
At the age of six, Draco learns that there are different kinds of monsters, not just the ones in his closet, but that Muggles may not be part of such a category. His parents and their social circles say otherwise, but Draco is not so certain.
“If I can at least start on it, then I won’t have to do as much later and I’ll be free to do what I want on the weekend,” Draco replies, not looking up from where he’s rummaging through his bag. He doesn’t even startle when Muddy’s head pops up, instead giving her an unimpressed look.
Max hums over the radio, going up and down in pitch as they consider their answer, before the noise of them snapping their fingers can be heard. “A person!”
Then the T. Rex – which Draco thinks it is prudent to remind himself is SUPPOSED to be extinct – begins to pull back its lips, showing more of its fangs, until it is stomping to face them and letting out a mighty roar. In response, the two boys scream, and Weasley slams the door shut just as the dinosaur is taking a step towards them. They both begin scrambling backwards, as if the massive creature will be able to break free and get to them, both speaking far louder than seems necessary.
“You could have said ‘The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood,’
Harry makes a pained noise, but otherwise doesn’t answer. Sinistra’s office is just ahead and the door is already open. When they pause at the doorway, waiting to be invited in, they see that they’re not the only ones that were called in. Vivian stands just within, her arms crossed, and when Sinistra nods the boys inside she looks back at them with wide eyes.
” Granger shrieks, loud and shocked enough to garner the rest of the DA’s attention. The rest of the students had mostly been mingling at this point, some still giving Daphne and Astoria’s spell a try, but now they’ve all gone still, staring over in worry.
“Forget about it, Malfoy. It doesn’t matter,” Potter growls lowly. Despite not looking at Draco, the blonde still sees Potter’s eyes flicking around, like he’s looking for an escape.
Polyjuice Potion required a piece of the person one wanted to turn into. If Not-Really-Moody was regularly making the potion, that meant he was regularly getting DNA from the real Moody. But… where could the Auror be…?
Draco bites his lip nervously.
“I don’t like you and Malfoy teaming up,” the bespectacled Gryffindor mumbles and Weasley throws his arms out wide.
“I have to do this,” Draco whispers one morning in May, sitting alone in the library with Eve, his books forgotten.
“No. He does not,” Dumbledore smiles slightly, like it’s a bit of a joke to him, and Draco continues.
Draco really hated working with Gryffindors…
Mrs Nubble narrows her eyes, but thankfully her husband takes over the talking. He was always more of a people person. “Professor McGonagall. Hogwarts…” he pauses to make sure he got the name right, but Draco doubts he actually forgot, “Is a real school. A boarding school. For witches.”
“Honestly, Potter, have you learned nothing?” Draco snaps and Potter glares back at him, crossing his arms. “The Goblet wasn’t just cursed, its very ‘mind,’ if you will, was rewritten. Someone would have to go to extensive lengths to do that.”
“Sure. So long as you’re prepared to accept nothing you say will make any difference,” Draco replies, smiling sweetly and fluttering his lashes in the most obnoxious way he can.
“Yeah, Longbottom,” he grunts, looking away before he can become too sentimental, “We can try tomorrow.”
” Eve says clearly, the end of her wand sparking with golden lights as she points it at the bone.
Draco leans back to watch, a small smile on his own face as he observes how much energy and love this family has for each other. They have their issues, he knows after observing Harry so closely, but right in this moment they are one, happy entity. They love each other so, so much and it makes Draco…
“Very well,” he shrugs, sauntering over to Potter’s side, smirking. He pulls down a few ornaments in silence, before leaning towards Potter and whispering in his ear, “You know… You’re not very intimidating when you’re all red like that.”
And then, as sudden as it started, the figures stop. They go completely still in their twisted positions and the twirling of the room stills. For a moment, everything is motionless, including the teenagers, but then the blacks and whites of the room begin to meld again. The colors smear and dull until they are back to the calmer, neutral grey.
Hope you all enjoyed the chapter! Leave comments, they are my life blooooood! And have a spectacular day!
Theodore and Longbottom both pat Draco’s knee, clearly pleased to see him alright, before going back to sit around Ginny.
“Muggles?” Draco repeats, testing out the word on his mouth. It sounded rather silly, like a made-up word no one thought twice to question, but the woman said it with so much confidence he had little choice to believe its validity.
A few months, and a few more private performances, later, with no further comment ever leaving Lucius Malfoy’s mouth, Draco stashes the violin away in his closet, swearing to never pull it out again.
~ ~ ~
Chapter Word Count: 29,979
“I’m sorry… the mob?” she sounds confused and maybe even a little worried for Draco’s mental state.
“I think you’ve been hanging out with me a little too much, Granger…”
Draco hums, not being deterred by Harry’s push, and instead shifts in even closer than he’d been before. “You’ve got a long way to go, however. Next lesson is learning how to say ‘no’ when people ask for a favor. Think you can handle it?”
But he’s also so tired. The stamina his fear and adrenaline had given him has vanished. Not just his body, but his very mind is exhausted. He has experienced every emotion he can imagine in a single night, planned a massive rescue mission on the fly, failed said rescue mission just at the end, and had to handle not falling apart in the middle of the Ministry so that his friends could be saved.
“Maybe… Maybe because…” Longbottom taps frantically on the side of a pot he’s attempting to transport. Draco watches him struggle with the weight and offers no help. “You two weren’t friends back then…?”
“WHAT?! And they’re still making you do it?! Oh, that’s some bullshit right there!” Max immediately explodes with indignation and Draco watches as Potter just about glows at their support. “Is that even allowed?”
“Nevermind that, how did you manage to calm her down?” Sirius demands right back, his eyes wider than usual.
Or perhaps in Slytherin
For a moment Draco and Potter catch each other’s eye and Draco hesitates, just for a moment. “The Militus Charm,” he says lowly and he sees the uncertainty in the Golden Trio’s eyes. “I truly do believe it could be beneficial to us. It is a lesser known spell; few enemies would know how to counter it.”
“He’s too young to drink, love,” Max’s mother’s giggling voice cuts in.
“What are you visualizing now?” Draco asks, ignoring Muddy’s demand that Sophie get her a live mouse if she wants to keep petting her, and instead focusing on the task presented to him.
“Harry got a Firebolt on Christmas.” That does manage to garner some of Draco’s attention and he rolls his eyes again. Of COURSE Potter already had a replacement broom, his Nimbus 2000 reduced to toothpicks after his fall, and it was a Firebolt, no less. “But it was sent to him from an anonymous sender and…”
It wasn’t much, but at least it was something to ease the guilt.
“You like him, then?” Draco observes, less of a question save for curtesy’s sake, and Max immediately begins to splutter.
“You make it far too easy. Anyway, where was I?” Draco taps his temple for theatrical affect, before snapping his fingers and continuing. “Right. Well, clearly Eve, Leandra - who was with us - and myself now all know of your little club.”
.oOo.
” Daphne shrieks and Draco sets a hand on her shoulder to try and calm her down.
“I was hoping to ask you a question, professor, but…” the blonde trails off, glancing to the side. “It isn’t a question to do with classes.”
The eagle owl blinks out at him for a few moments, measuring the situation, before slipping out of the cage in one, smooth motion, wings spreading as she flies into the air. Some of the other owls hoot in surprise and she dives at the employee’s head, snatching at his hair with her talons and making him shriek rather loudly and dive behind the desk. Draco’s lips immediately crack into a grin at that just as the eagle owl swoops towards him and lands heavily onto his shoulder.
“If you’d have let us explain, Granger, you would have known already,” Eve snaps, which only manages to make the Gryffindor puff up.
“Thank Merlin,” Eve breathes a sigh of releif as she shuts the door behind her. “I’m so… so…” Eve lets out a short, guttural growl to express her true frustrations. Usually, Draco would wait to let her explain everything on her own time, but he’s really not in the mood to wait around right now.
For a moment Harry works his mouth like he can’t figure out what to say, opening and closing it before swallowing and shaking his head in a panic. “Of-of course not! I just… I was… I was supposed to be somewhere else, is all,” Harry finishes lamely, looking back down at the table. Some of his nerves seem to be shifting now that he’s talking and now he just looks sad.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” Max’s father says through the connection, voice wobbling in and out like he’s moving around, probably trying to avoid Max. “It’s fine to want things and be upset when we don’t get them, but you need to recognize that you are a very well-off young man. There are people out there who don’t even get what they
Having heard just about enough Dumbledore orders McGonagall and Snape to keep watch, the two agreeing immediately, as Dumbledore leads Potter, Draco, and Sirius towards his office.
“She’s probably hiding out somewhere. You ARE pretty exhausting to be around,” Sophie smirks, her glossed lips sharp with the motion. She had such round, soft features, but was able to make some of the most cutting expressions. They almost rivalled Pansy.
“Yua Hushburn,” Eve’s mother introduces herself, but does not stop giving Duke a hard stare. She was a hard one to win over…
It really is beautiful, the two boys stopping to admire the view. Draco doesn’t even try to hold back the smile on his face as he looks all around him, eyes sparkling as they take it all in. He must look like a fool, but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t think he’s ever been at peace like this before. Despite all the families and children, it has been relaxing and quiet, faint orchestral music playing from distant speakers Draco can never find, and the sounds of water all around him.
“Did you get all of the photos, Malfoy?” Potter questions, looking at the blonde pleadingly.
With a beautiful, well-practiced flourish the seven-year-old Draco Malfoy takes a deep bow, holding his new violin in one hand and the violin bow in the other.
“Here, here,” Weasley says, also approaching Potter, and Draco watches the lions in quiet contemplation for a few moments, before smiling and clapping his hands together.
Somehow, though, he still liked them. They didn’t do anything special like magical candies did, but they were still sweets, and how could a growing boy say no to sweets?
“No one agreed to that, you just decided it yourself,” Astoria says sharply, but her sister hushes her with a stern look. Harry looks like he might be sick when Daphne looks back at him.
“Yes. Is there a problem?” he demands, but Ron doesn’t seem put off. Instead he actually looks even more unhappy.
It was thanks to his capabilities to leave early that he ended up at the Room of Requirement before any of the other students. It is also how he ended up running into Dobby during the last DA meeting of the year, who was in the process of decorating the entire room with Harry Potter themed Christmas decorations.
“Which means we need more damning evidence,” Eve scowls, looking away and glaring at a random patch of grass.
“It means you can talk to snakes,” Blaise offers, not getting off his bed but leaning forward, eye flicking between Draco and Muddy. “It’s, like, a really rare characteristic. Usually it’s passed down through families.”
Dumbledore watches the fuming boy in silence, waiting as Draco slowly begins to calm down. “You have grown so much, Mr. Malfoy,” the Headmaster finally says, pride lacing his words, and it makes Draco sick.
“Nothing,” Potter sighs, dejected. They’d wanted to get in a class as soon as possible, but they’d not been able to come up with a suitable location at all. So far, the Shrieking Shack was looking to be the most promising, but it was still a last-ditch option.
“Really,” Draco says a bit more firmly, “It’s okay.” He had wanted to meet Sirius, had hoped he might show up when he’d found out James Potter would be showing up, but when he hadn’t Draco had felt both disheartened and a little relieved. “I wouldn’t have known what to do with myself if he’d shown up anyway.”
Dark detectors were strangely sentient things in the most peculiar of ways.
He isn’t sure how long they are out there, but eventually Potter moves to lay on his stomach, settling into the grass while Draco starts taking pictures of the surrounding area. It is when he is pointing his camera at a line of thick trees that he sees a dark shape.
“And after you graduate?” Harry questions, one brow arched higher than the other. He didn’t look too pleased with the prefect’s reasoning and Draco felt like he could agree. He wanted to win, he loved winning, but to only make it about one’s self seemed detrimental to the cause.
Krum watches them, startled, then looks at Draco, who shrugs and grabs his still outstretched hand.
When the article does drop the whole castle is abuzz. Up until then it had only been a rumor that a body had been found in Hogsmeade, but now everyone knows.
“I don’t.”
If Ebru had been telling the truth and insinuating what Draco thought she was insinuating, this pin was Draco’s ticket into the Records Department. Whenever he wanted!
claimed to be so weak to that one.”
Madam Pomfrey took care of Montague as soon as he was brought in, scowling something furious, and waved her wand urgently over his prone body. Draco and Tracey were quickly shooed out, the mediwitch focused, and the two Slytherins ended up lingering outside the hospital wing.
Draco meets Dolores Umbridge a few days before he goes back to Hogwarts. Despite not going to the Ministry as much during the August month, he still makes a point of dropping in a few times.
Abruptly, like the world is slowing down, Draco freezes at the new voice. His back goes stiff, spine rigid, before he manages to turn around and look for who has just interrupted his panicking.
“Sure thing, Drae-Drae!” Vivian walks away and Ron lets out a surprised laugh.
They mostly stick to basic hexes and spells out of their own textbooks, but whenever Draco is around they try to go over at least one spell from
When he opens the letter and reads the incredibly short passage, however, he promptly drops it back onto the desk with a gasp, his eyes wide in terror.
“I am,” Leandra nods, giving Granger a reassuring smile and nod.
“Aww, poor Malfoy,” Granger had said, patting the blonde’s back patronizingly.
On Draco’s twelfth birthday he received his new disposable camera from Max, but also a surprise gift from Eric.
“I would not say kitten…” Luna had tilted her head and set her finger to her chin, thinking. “I would call him a Meeto.”
” he says calmly, and then the tip of his wand starts to glow like a Lighting Charm. However, rather than a white light, the light begins to revolve in a rainbow of colors. “It’s just a variant of the Wand Lighting Charm I came up with in second year. That’s all,” Draco explains with a shrug, watching as the colorful lights play on his friends’ faces.
“He meant me, dad,” Harry mumbles quietly and James immediately starts to laugh.
All because the girl had answered Draco’s question. She’d seemed so confident for a moment, too.
As it turned out the girl had a very similar problem to Draco. Strange things happened to her that she could never explain. Strange things like what happened to Draco.
Potter makes an exasperated face, but then Eve is speaking, her own expression bored. “He’s completely useless at receiving positive feedback.”
seen is quite promising, though,” Luna assures. “I am very curious about the black orb that was created.”
“You’re both hilarious,” Draco deadpans, his face burning, while Potter snickers and Eve smirks. “Get your stupid snacks and let’s go.”
Draco smirks, applauding Granger’s cursing capabilities, and catches Edgecombe’s eye for a moment. She’s horrified again, tears rolling down her face, and it is clear she won’t be saying much else until she manages to calm down.
The other fifth year boys are already in their dorm, ready for bed, save for Theodore who is standing in the bathroom doorway with his toothbrush in his mouth. They all appear to be in the middle of hushed conversation, then immediately drop off when Draco steps in.
“Get over here! Hurry!” Harry calls and Hermione and Pansy leap into motion, attempting to run behind the troll to get to the boys, but the beast swings blindly with its club at the sound of footsteps. Hermione screams again and Pansy lets out a string of curse words no eleven-year-old should know.
“Come on!” Potter yells at him and Draco doesn’t have to be told twice.
, too!”
“Well, what was he supposed to do?” Weasley demands from his best friend’s right. He looks equally furious. The only one who doesn’t is Granger, who is stiff and fidgeting, clearly wanting this to be over already.
“The task is tomorrow.”
“Sh-sh-she’ll need f-food,” the employee stammers, slowly peeking out from behind the desk, eyes as wide as the owls around him. He then brings up a hand to point at a nearby shelf filled with all kinds of owl treats and feed. The eagle owl spots him before he can say anything else, however, and hoots loudly at him. The employee yelp and dives back behind the desk.
It wasn’t just Moody Draco didn’t want to see him heading to his office, it was the students. All it would take was one well-meaning Ravenclaw to approach Moody on the pitch and let him know one Draco Malfoy was probably looking for him but hadn’t heard he wasn’t in his office anymore to ruin the whole thing.
Certainly, there are still stresses later in the day, but not anything like Draco would have expected.
Draco’s brows rise in surprise, not expecting the honest comment, and lowers the slinky so he can pull the radio closer. “Really?”
Tonight was one of those nights. Max had awoken from a nightmare - something about being chased by a stampede of animals and not being able to outrun them - and called up Draco in hopes to bounce a few study topics off him.
Outside they weave through the halls as fast as they dare, Sirius bumping into his legs multiple times whenever someone passes by in the other direction. It is as they are slipping back out, into the Atrium, that the Aurors come rushing through, heading for the Records Department to find out what all the ruckus is about.
The Room looks like it does when he meets up with the Golden Trio, large meeting table and all – the landscape outside the faux windows is a crystalline, winter wonderland, like Draco likes it – which works for him since he’ll be meeting with the Gryffindors later anyway. The space where they practice spells is there, too, except now, in the corner, is a very tempting pile of pillows and blankets.
“Draco, we are out here at ass-end o’clock, in the rain, breaking the bloody law,” Eve snarls, “So help me Godric if you don’t finish this right now I am going to make you eat your socks!”
“There was this awful portrait at Sirius’s house of his mother,” Potter explains, holding the cup of ice cream but not yet trying to eat any. Draco, on the other hand, looks down but can’t help but notice there’s no spoons. He frowns. “She was a bigotted monster of a woman and she made living in that house miserable.”
“You have an inclination towards explosions,” Tracey states bluntly, head very slowly tilting to one side, “What if you blow up someone’s internal organs while they are still inside them?”
Draco scowls as he glares and throws an Earworm Jinx without thought, smirking when Weasley yelps as “21st Century Boy” by Bad Religion gets stuck in his head.)
The rest of the day runs smoothly for Draco, much to his relief. He has no more run ins with Sinsitra, Theodore and Millicent mostly leave him alone, and he manages to distract himself completely with his classes. He also has no Quidditch practice that evening, which he doubted he’d be able to go to so soon after his near-fall.
Hermione…
“I don’t have an anatomy class either,” Max says flippantly before proceeding to outline the hand bones. “Carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. The carpus is located in the heel of the hands and--”
He has little time to consider it, however, because Max is grabbing his arm and yanking him out to the empty space that surrounds the jukebox. “You’re supposed to dance to disco, you know! Papa says so!” Max grins, then tries to urge Draco into squirm-dancing with them.
For a long stretch of silence Eve’s mother glares the man down. Duke, for his part, keeps up a calm presence, although Draco thinks he sees a bead of sweat roll down his temple.
It is so much hassle to just be a visitor without an official escort… Draco certainly wouldn’t be doing this again.
“Yes. I’ll keep quiet. Might even give you an opportunity to reestablish some trust here. But if you ever hint at crossing the line again…” Draco glances away, smiling to himself, and sighs. “Well, Mrs. Daisy Hayworth, I will take your name and every name you have ever used and

“One kid, quiet kid, just pulled out a knife in the middle of class and started swinging.”
So, Draco went to Hogsmeade and quietly climbed onto the Hogwarts Express, because the school thought that was what he was supposed to be doing, but his parents would not be waiting for him at the station. No, he had someone else waiting.
“The only thing going for him was his hair, and even that was probably fake.” Draco knew one thing about Umbridge, and that was that Umbridge had been a Slytherin, and any proper Slytherin would enjoy a little joking at the expense of someone they dislike.
Draco had gotten accustomed to timing his radio calls with American clocks many years prior and evenings in England were always the best time to contact his Muggle family. That used to mean the Astronomy Tower was his best hiding place, but ever since Umbridge had locked the place down, Draco had grown a bit more adventurous.
Potter flinches around his scowl, only slightly. “You have no idea what it’s like. I
When Draco is just turned fifteen, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned, and Lucius Malfoy is sighted as one of the Death Eaters that returned to his side… Draco must accept that the real monsters out there may very well be wearing his father’s face.
~ ~ ~
With a resolve to act as normally as possible Draco decides to just ignore them, opening his new book and beginning to read about the adventures of a character named Bilbo Baggins. At some point he manages to maneuver the half empty box of jellybeans and the chocolate frog onto his lap, which took some rather painful jostling, before he settles.
“Is this a warning or an invitation?” Draco arches a brow.
Draco freezes, every muscle in his body seizing up at the silky voice that comes from behind them. Nevermind…
Harry either doesn’t get Draco is trying to lighten the mood, or Draco has simply failed at the attempt, because he looks away, adjusts his glasses, and starts fidgeting again. “Sure,” Harry mumbles and Draco’s silver eyes thin. He really wanted to know what was up with Harry’s reactions to any mention of his own sorting. It seemed very specific, but not immediately detrimental to Draco, unlike Ron’s previously unnerving expressions.
“Yes,” she begins and both boys begin to brighten, “I turn my eye away from your late-night wanderings.” They quickly deflate, looking sheepish as Sinistra stares at them, then turns away and walks out.
Okay, Draco kind of remembered that, but not very well.
“Yes!” they say in unison.
Everything feels normal again, they no longer appear to be standing on a wall, and instead find themselves in a positively HUGE hall. The walls are made of glass and the vaulted ceiling is so high up Draco sees birds flying above them but can’t identify them from this distance. There are doors that line the hall, and thanks to the glass walls they can see that the doors lead into equally sized glass domes, each with a compressed world within. The immediate one to their right appears to be a swamp of some kind, and the one to their left is completely underwater.
“Why not?” someone calls and Draco cringes. Mrs Nubble throws her head towards the hall and scowls.
Within a blink he is back on his legs as a human, shaking out his arms before pulling out his wand. He can feel the others looking at him in question and he simply waves them off. “I have an idea,” is all he offers before raising his wand and reciting both incantations for both charms.
“Yeah, me and Harry--”
~ ~ ~
“AND YOU DIDN’T TELL ME UNTIL NOW?!” Max roars, finally finding their voice again, and Draco scowls.
Draco mostly just ignores him.
“With fangs.”
“So, you requested Skeeter not print the article?” Draco questions.
The table is quiet for a few beats, soaking up everything they’d discussed, until Granger sighs miserably and says, flatly, “Pureblood culture is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“We don’t know if that will happen. I’m a special case, remember?”
What kind of name is “Bee Gees?”
A loud banging at the front door, however, has them startling out of their reprieve with a sickening drop in their stomachs.
“Yes, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco groans, in no mood to even attempt to build up a tantrum of any kind. He was awake, but at what cost? He felt utterly spent and he desperately wanted to get some more sleep in. Who knew healing was so exhausting?
“Only the outskirts,” Luna says lightly, like it is no big deal at all. “Dumbledore gave me the job while Hagrid is gone, and so long as the sun is still out, I am relatively safe.”
“Must be an English thing ‘cause I’ve never heard of him.”
“No one is making you do anything, Scarhead, calm down,” Draco keeps cackling and Potter shoves him. The blonde looks back down at his magazine, then folds up a close up of a punk kid sticking their tongue out and holds it over his mouth. “What if I got a tongue piercing? Eventually.”
“What about you, Leandra?” Granger asks, trying to change the subject. “Have you ever made your own spells?”
Lily eventually finishes off her braid, Hermione still struggling with her own, messy hair, and Draco swats at her hands so he can do it for her. He often would get suckered into braiding Ada’s long hair for her when they had to do more strenuous chores, so he knew what he was doing.
They lapse into an awkward silence after that, much to Draco’s discomfort, and the blonde shifts in his seat while the other two boys keep glancing at each other, seeming to be having some silent conversation with their eyes. They obviously knew each other, and for a while if Draco were to guess, and he felt very out of place now that he didn’t have Hermione with him. Maybe he shouldn’t have left her, even if she was being a pain…
Harry is bumping his shoulder, however, and drawing over his attention. His smile is small, but he’s thankfully no longer panicking over his friend or nervous over Draco’s response. “It’ll be okay,” he says quietly so only Draco can hear him.
“And you approached… me?”
Still, McGonagall had been amazing. Draco had always known she was powerful, but to stand up and fight back against so much on her own… She was a wonder.
“Either that or the prophecy is even more important than we realize and the Order is remarkably incompetent for not allowing you to just… take it, hear it, then destroy it,” Draco shrugs.
“He very well might be. I may even need to take him away for a while.”
“A galleon says he’s a bug,” Blaise snickers and Draco glares.
“Do not keep me in suspense forever, Mr. Malfoy,” she chirps far too pleasantly, especially after the vile she’d spat only a moment before, but Draco plays along.
“Oh, well, me and a bunch of friends from school went to the local pastry shop and there was an ant hill in the parking lot so we dared David Martinez to stick his whole hand in it!”
“By Salazar, I’m turning into a Gryffindor,” he growls, massaging his temple. Potter looks to him, confused and about to ask for clarification, but Draco is already moving forward and grabbing his hand. He pulls the other boy into his space and sets his free hand on the curve of Potter’s waist.
“Floo
They all sit down to drink tea and nibble on the rock cakes, which are hard as actual rocks with raisins in them. Draco dislikes eating both rocks and raisins, but he gnaws on them anyway to be nice. At one point, when Hagrid is looking away, Ron smacks a rock cake on the edge of the table and it doesn’t crumble, instead making a dull, thunking noise. He and Draco exchange horrified looks.
“Good thing, yeah.”
“Uh, yes? Daphne? Astoria?” Harry ventures, attempting for calm and professional, but his smile is thin and uncertain. Draco can’t tell if the girls are upset over something, or just being intense, and he suspects Harry can’t, either.
“Yes, mom,” Harry mumbles, trying to avoid her eye, but when Lily sighs he glances up, panicked by whatever she is about to say or do.
“He sounds nice,” Draco agrees, unable to stop his own, small smile from forming at Harry’s pure excitement.
They fall asleep like that, curled around each other, finally finding the rest they so desperately need.
It’s a frightening thought, that if he had never gone out into Muggle London, Draco would probably be following his parents, his father especially, without question, because questions were frowned upon.
have weapons. Great, terrible weapons… Draco had seen them at the museum. But the Muggles seemed more interested foolishly pointing them at each other than pointing them at the Wizarding World.
Draco considers their options for only a moment before glancing between the twins, an eyebrow arched. “Have any of those Whiz-bangs of yours with you?” he questions, watching as two, matching grins answer him.
“Ireland versus Bulgaria,” Draco replies, glossing over the “sweet” comment.
Draco and Granger are.
“Always knew Snape was up to something,” Weasley mumbles, glaring off into the distance.
“Sweet Merlin, I really don’t care,” Potter mumbles pathetically, not loud enough to get the two to stop talking, but enough for Draco to glance down at him and smirk.
” Max near shrieks through their hysteria and Potter lifts the radio up.
Those were probably the nicest parts of a very, very stressful week. It was nice to see Potter momentarily brighten up, but it did not take away from the dark cloud that constantly hung over the boy’s head. The Leaving Feast didn’t help much, either, the feeling of mourning permeating the entire hall, and dead silence following Dumbledore declaring Diggory’s death a deed done by Voldemort himself.
Ungracefully, and after a short hesitation, Potter plops down in the grass beside him, leaving plenty of space between the two. “And you snuck by Hagrid to do this?”
“Potter…” he starts quietly, but Potter shakes his head.
“Mr. Davis,” he says as he stands back in front of the desk, “Why do the prophecy files not have a transcript of the actual prophecies in them?”
Draco could applaud her, if he was that kind of person.
“I’m beginning to get the feeling you didn’t want to be in this house,” Draco whispers, leaning towards Harry so only the other boy can hear. He’s met, very suddenly, by surprised, green eyes.
but it looks like Potter might be pulling ahead. A dark shadow passes in front of them, but Draco is too hyper-focused on the Snitch and Potter’s hand is slipping back, the perfect opportunity, and Draco’s own encircles around the golden ball.
“The native term is ‘Long,’ but Lung Dragon is not incorrect,” Huang-Jun replies. What Draco had swiftly learned from speaking to Huang-Jun was that he was remarkably eager to share as much information with them as he possibly could. He likely had never had a respectful audience, judging by all the horror stories he’d recounted of his time here, locked up in the Ministry.
“I think I met your father,” Draco now turns to Ron, deciding he’ll be safe from having to talk to Arthur Weasley now that he’s on the train. “I was getting my books for school and he was in the Muggle section. Arthur, right?”
“He’s always been a bit of a heights junky,” Ron says, a few paces to the side, looking at his best friend with an arched brow.
” the black figure says.
She’d even made a great, big deal about it, inviting students of her choosing - all Slytherins - to her office to be given tea and badges and power. They had capabilities on par with the prefects, now, but with Dumbledore still in charge there was no telling how long that might last.
“Your families like picking up scraps, do they?” It is, to his great shock, Draco realizes it is Harry who has just spoken. The blonde glances over and sees the other wizard glaring across the table at Theodore and Millicent, his green eyes hard. On his other side Blaise, who has been silent this whole time, actually snorts. When Theodore and Millicent seem too shocked to say anymore, also not expecting the biting comment from the seemingly anxious boy, Harry says, “Then shut up.”
Chapter Word Count: 78,435 (OH LAWD)
Which is a dreadful mistake, really, because Draco is immediately pointing his wand at him and saying, “
Draco looks at Sirius for a long moment, face carefully neutral, before he takes in a deep, agitated breath, then lets it out in a gust. “For the last four years Potter, Granger, and Weasley have been fighting a fight that should not have been their responsibilities. For the last year, I have also been part of this.”
“Inside. Inside, everyone,” Dumbledore orders, binding up fake-Moody’s body with a flick of his wand and floating him inside as quickly as possible. McGonagall, with hardly a second thought, repairs the broken castle wall, getting all the rubble out of their way, while Snape follows after Dumbledore with a vial of veritaserum in hand.
“What is it?”
It is busy enough here that no one takes notice of him like they did in the Leaky Cauldron, which he is grateful for, and McGonagall gives him a few book title suggestions before stepping to the side to let him wander. She must have seen his excited expression and thought it was finally time to let him explore.
“Why is something like this present in a place of learning?” Draco questions, crossing his arms and glaring at the photo of an astronaut walking on the moon. “Although, I suppose it could serve to show the problems caused by propaganda, but I see nothing on such a subject.”
Approaching them, Potter spots him first and immediately steps up to his side, pressing close and hissing, “Make them stop!”
“¿Como estas?” Max continues, voice chipper but slow, making sure every syllable is pronounced perfectly.
What a pompous name, too. “Axis Powers,” as if they were the center of everything.
“Same rules about the tail. Get back under the invisibility cloak,” Draco says and Eve begins unfurling the cloak she’d stuffed under one arm. “We’re getting those idiots out of here.”
Hermione is glaring at him, not pleased at all, but Draco isn’t going to let her win this one. He didn’t regret what he had done, not a bit, and he doubted he would have even if he had gotten a year’s worth of detention. Theodore Nott was a jerk and he wasn’t going to let him get away with any of it.
“Excuse you! I am plenty tough!  I’ve been to jail, you know,” Max exclaims.
What? What?!
“That is ‘Come As You Are’,” Krum whispers.
For a second Draco catches Pansy’s eye. They don’t nod or move or even try to express anything, yet Draco thinks he knows exactly what she wants to say. She’s solid and decided. Whatever is going to happen is going to be bad, and they cannot let that pass.
Draco isn’t sure how long they are up in the air, but when they land the sky is beginning to lighten and the stars are vanishing. They still have time to get some sleep in, especially if they skip breakfast, but they both share the sentiment that they may have overdone it. Still, Draco is grateful and happier than he has been in a while.
“Match made in heaven, right there,” Weasley mumbles. “Looney Lovegood and Miss Horror Show.”
“Maybe peak tourist season really isn’t a good time to look for peace and quiet,” Potter says with an arched brow and they both turn to head back to the road and call the Knight Bus back to pick them up.
“Yes ma’am, I do. And yes, Draco, I ride a motorcycle. I’ll show it to you some time if you’re so interested, but for now…” Here, Duke’s demeanor turns serious and he looks to Harry, “Rest. There is no reason for you to be in danger in this location, no one should believe you’re here, but be careful and return to the Order once you are feeling better.”
“I…” Edgecombe gulps, shaking where she stands. “I was… I was part of it…”
“Alright, alright, thank you,” Draco cuts them off, cheeks glowing pink in embarrassment and a scowl on his face.
“Doing what?” Draco demands, standing up straight.
“Why don’t we send you and Harry a care package?” Max’s mother says, a bit more brightly. “One for you and one for him.”
When he stands up straight and turns back to his Head of House, she has turned her gaze skyward, eyes reflecting the moonlight like they had before. “The Astronomy Tower is off limits outside of classes,” she says, voice neither stern nor conversational. It simply is. “But I find coming up here to be quite calming,” she continues and Draco’s brows furrow in confusion. She looks down at him and for the first time there is an odd twinkle in her eye, but that could just be the stars. “IF one is working on extra Astronomy work, of course.”
“You’re the Ministry’s number two enemy, just behind Dumbledore. You shouldn’t go anywhere near them,” Draco said softly. He was sorry he couldn’t take Harry. He would have loved to sneak off with his boyfriend – and that word still made his insides hop with every thought – but he had to be pragmatic.
“Hello, Draco,” Luna greets pleasantly as Theodore, who was clutching his chest from the surprise, glares at him.
How could they still not see that their actions had consequences? He understood that Potter was frustrated with everything going on, and by proxy so too were Granger and Weasley, but to just jump in without thinking… It was very much like them, yes, but that wasn’t an excuse.

Potter, after all, was an underdog and not a very smart move to bet on, logically speaking.
“You’re paying attention to me, are you? How sweet,” except his tone is anything but sweet, and Potter scowls a little deeper, looking away. Draco glares at him, waiting for him to say something else foolish or to leave, but for a while Potter remains silent, looking anywhere but at Draco.
Draco wanted nothing to do with that hateful behavior anymore. He even was finding his Uncle Severus Snape’s classes difficult to deal with what with his blatant favoritism and mistreatment of the Gryffindors. He’d once loved these classes, but there was a fine line between cruel and teasing, and Draco wasn’t sure how to identify Snape yet.
“He finished
A ghost-like form curls upwards from the shattered prophecy, which Luna did try to describe to them, but something’s gone wrong. It doesn’t speak. It’s mouth moves, angry and urgent, but no words come out, and then it curls into itself as if in pain.
The witch pulls out her wand once more and waves it once through the air. “As perfect as ever, Mr. Ollivander,” McGonagall says and Draco’s eyes widen. Wait, Ollivander had sold McGonagall her wand? But…
But, out of all the professions Draco could confidently get a read on, journalists were not one of them.
He wanted to help, but Max was right. They were just kids with little to no power. What were they supposed to do?
Massive, massive tanks of water, filled with brightly colored fish, small sharks, rays, coral, and all kinds of other aquatic life greet them as they step into the main attraction. The room is dark, but the tanks have blue and purple lights that waft out, giving everything a dreamy feel, like Draco might just be underwater too.
“Quirrel was trying to save me?” Draco asks, baffled, but then considers that. As frightened as he was, Quirrel was still the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. He must have some experience under his belt dealing with jinxes.
“So… what? That’s what we are? Representatives of what they encompass?” Blaise says, glancing over at the figures who stand still and silent, like sentinels.
He’s a mess and Draco loves him.
“Punting your butt?” Pansy suggests, tilting her head towards Theodore with a smirk.
He says his good-byes to his mother, kissing her cheek and wishing her luck dealing with Lucius alone for so many months. She gives him a disapproving glare at that, discreetly pinching his bicep until he squirms away, smirking.
“What are you doing?” Harry asks Vivian as she pops her Halloween CD into the player. She grins at them then sets the device on a table in the middle of the room, headphones set beside them, muffled music already playing from them. She points her wand, a twisted thing with a metal handle, at the headphones.
They finish up decorating in record time and, upon a request from Draco, Dobby goes and fetches them two party poppers. The moment the door opens and Potter finally makes his appearance, both Draco and Dobby startle the life out of him with the poppers, before exclaiming, “Have a Harry Christmas!”
“How… how the hell’d you even get stabbed?! What, did some spoiled rich kid just fucking snap in the middle of Biology or something and start flinging their scalpel?!” Max questions, clearly worked into a tizzy.
“You did what?! Malfoy, you idiot, why would you run towards something like tha--”
“Yes, yes, you have a big family of magicians,” Eve groans, rolling her eyes skyward, then waggles her fingers at Weasley. “We asked about you, though, dweeb. What’ve you got?”
The voice isn’t one that Draco is familiar with. It isn’t one of the students, it was too deep and calm, but it cuts through the chaos as a Death Eater topples to the ground. Then another voice, also older, yells, “
“Have you guys figured out what you’re going to do about the secret club?” Max asks, sounding curious and concerned.
“But, none of us know how to cast that, yet,” Granger says, pauses to give Draco a questioning look to double check that she’s correct, and when he shakes his head she continues, “How are we meant to teach it?”
Draco hesitates, just a moment, but it clearly is noticed by the Golden Trio, who tense even further. “We are… but previously it was only over empty promises, ‘morality,’ and other houses. A Slytherin could only trust a Slytherin. No one else would ever have our backs. Don’t question it, you know it’s true.”
“I like that he found it by mistake,” Max giggles, pointing at the part of the sign that outlines its original discovery. “Wonder if I’ll ever discover something crazy by accident!”
“Maybe, MAYBE, in college, but not wherever you are,” Max retorts with feeling.
The grip on both his shoulders he feels, though, and the hands squeeze harshly, giving him a sharp shake. “…lfoy! Foc… Brea… Malf…”
seemed easy enough to understand, he decides, then his brows raise at the next book. “Oh! A book about Transfiguration. That’s what you teach, right?”
Most everything was bills. They didn’t get magazines, the Nubble’s hated most pop culture, and not many people needed to stay in contact with any of them that couldn’t call on the landline. Ada did have a pen pal from the States, and Mrs. Nubble set said letter to the side as she flipped through everything.
When Draco is eleven and running through the Forbidden Forest with the Boy-Who-Lived, he realizes that the monsters could very well be on their own back porch.
Draco’s face turns pink and his eyes only widen, now with a touch of horror. “I-I’m not sweet!” he yelps in indignation then shoots a glare past Lily when he sees not just Harry but Blaise, too, holding back snickers.
Eventually, as the sun gets higher and higher, Potter does begin to stir, squirming to hide his face from the light until Draco raises a hand to block out a line of light over Potter’s eyes.
“How can you tell?” Draco questions, but this time it looks like the twins are actually agreeing with their brother.
Harry is stiff and shrunken inward, like he’s trying to keep the attention off him, and his eyes are glued to the table. Beside him Ron looks fidgety and unhappy and for a moment they lock eyes. The redhead shakes his head, powerless, and Draco’s heart drops. Was this a common occurrence? He certainly hoped not…
“Hopefully they’re not poisoned,” Draco mumbles.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How do you reckon that?” Finnigan calls, his brows furrowed, scratching his temple with the tip of his wand.
“When you stop insisting on sneaking around,” is the reply and Draco’s eyes narrow. With a swift movement he raises his camera and snaps a picture of the obnoxiously grinning Potter, the flash now making the boy wonder shriek.
They don’t get to go out every day during their eight-day reprieve. Three of those eight Draco is warned ahead of time by Dumbledore to keep Potter inside at the Dursley’s. Despite Muggle London being one of the safest places at the moment, there are still bound to be unfriendlies snooping around on occasion.
“Yes, that is what I just said,” the blonde says, brow arched, unimpressed but very much amused. He may not have liked the swarm of people at the Leaky Cauldron, but this? With such a small crowd? He could get behind.
Max is cut off by the sound of
Draco sighs deeply, sliding further down onto the floor, realizing this conversation was far, far from over.
“I call it the Tail-Growing Hex,” Tracey says slowly, vacant eyes not a good combination with a giant, deadly, venomous weapon. “I know other tails, too.”
“Well… yeah! But, that’s what you should do, y’know? Mama and Papa told me they were really proud of me and my class for asking all those questions. They want me educated on it all, but none of us are super, crazy religious either.”
“Stop…”
“I guess I understand the second one,” he says slowly. After all, if he survived an attack that killed all others a title like The-Boy-Who-Lived seemed rather appropriate, but… “Why the other one? Why The-Boy-Who-Vanished?”
“We overheard Madam Pomfrey speaking to some of the Order members earlier,” Luna explains. “He’s not reacting the way he should be to magical stimuli. He’s alive, but… He isn’t waking up.”
“Yes, Draco?” she urges, watching her son.
Dumbledore takes the folder and opens it, finding file after file of information held within, and his brows rise, clearly impressed. It is not every day one can say they impressed the great Albus Dumbledore.
Draco makes sure to stay quiet through the whole lesson, although a few Slytherins do actually speak up in concern. Not enough to enrage their new teacher, but enough to show that not everyone is eager to bend over backwards for her.
Eve, Leandra, and Granger are already at their usual table when Draco and Harry arrive. Weasley will likely be joining them shortly, right after his Quidditch practice, surely smelling like a barn.
to be a part of this, to not be left in the dark for once in my bleeding life, and no one will just help me. No one, not a single person, will just fucking
“Did it now?” the muggleborn retorts and Draco scowls as he looks back at them. They all look rather entertained.
“Aw, you know that’s not in our nature, Draco,” Pansy coo’s, stepping over and sitting down on top of Draco’s trunk and keeping him from opening it. He scowls down at her and instead circles around to his bed, tossing his satchel atop it.
“You are in high spirits today,” she notes with her bland voice.
Tomorrow morning he, and many other students, would be heading out for Christmas Break. His bags were all packed and ready to go, but Draco himself wasn’t faring too well. He’d had every intention of speaking to Potter the day after the last DA meeting. The day after Potter had kissed him then run away.
“She wears too much perfume for me to determine that,” Draco says, looking through his camera again. He thinks he spies some leathery wings above the treetops of the Forbidden Forest, but they are gone a second later and he isn’t sure if he imagined them or not.
They’d fit into each other’s spaces so easily, it just took them a while to figure out how to make it a good thing.
” says the black figure.
“What did those files say were housed here?” Weasley questions as they pass by a door and spot movement from within the dome behind it.
He writes out a simple letter for Cecil Duke, asking how he’s doing, how things are at the Ministry, and discretely wondering what all this fuss about Podmore was about. It was subtle and simple and, hopefully, Duke would give them some answers.
“I want an owl.”
“You could match with your Hufflepuff girlfriend,” Draco smirks and Eve pauses to reconsider. On Draco’s shoulder, Potter’s breathing has begun to even out.
“Which song?” Draco questions, smiling and arching a brow. Eve smirks back at him.
He also knew these projects often stacked on top of each other. He’d seen it happen once before, about a year prior, while Max had still been attending classes for the year. They had homework to do, tests to study for, and a science project to do all on top of building a working, model plane, studying the tigers at the zoo, experimenting with a rock polisher from the store, and learning how to work with resin crafts. It had been so much to just listen to, and soon Max had begun to spiral.
“Oh, and our teacher taught us a neat tune to remember the quadratic formula with! Wanna hear? Maybe it’ll help you when you get to it!” Max offers and Draco thinks something in his brain had broken. What was a
I will send more at a later date,
“Kicking your ass?” Draco offers sarcastically, glancing again at all the new students currently inhabiting the Great Hall.
“I’m serious!” Eve continues, looking around at them all. “Listen, I’m not one to kinkshame but maybe, just maybe, if your aim is to strike fear in the hearts of man, reconsider the use of anagrams like it’s some sort of kindergarten project.”
“I enjoy taking photos. When I came upon this incident, I thought it prudent to record the following events.”
He will not allow himself to wallow.
With that thought in mind he forces himself to write out letters to all of them, keeping any tears from welling up, and contemplates whether he really wants to send them or not. He’s been sending letters back and forth with Sirius a couple of times by now, most of those being awkward and uncertain as they get a feel for one another, but he’d hardly sent his foster family anything. Sitting here now, alone, Draco feels guilty about that.

“And the body… was never found again! Woooooo!”
“What?” said redhead barks, partially defensive but not putting much heat into it, “We never get to have this many treats at home.” Harry smiles at him and Draco’s arched brow only goes higher. He supposed he shouldn’t judge. After all, he hadn’t said anything to Vincent and Greg when they had gotten so much.
They needed to begin sowing the seeds of doubt in the Ministry into the public’s minds. It would have to be crafty and subtle, but it could be done, so Draco finishes up his second letter to Skeeter and sets it with Dukes.
When the sun is finally beginning to set and students are returning to the castle from their day out, they also make their way back inside. “You know,” Draco observes as they both wait around a corner for a group of older students to walk by. They were going to the library to meet with their friends. “I detest sounding like Skeeter, but it would make sneaking around quite a fair bit easier if you were an Animagus.”
“I promised them I would get further information on him to use against him. One of them must have hoped to scare Bagman into talking before actually getting the documents…”
The whole year had been a complete mess. Not only was the boy Draco had met at Madam Malkin’s THE Harry Potter, but he also apparently hated Draco’s guts for no good reason. Draco suspected that Weasley brat had said something about him that set him off, but he didn’t exactly have proof.
Where Draco has grown soft for this boy before him, Eve definitely has not, and she doesn’t let down until Harry is growling and ducking his head in defeat. Eve hums, then nods to Draco to get moving, and Draco nods back.
They don’t say anything for another stretch of time until Max sighs over the connection and says, “I’m gonna head out now. Gonna try to do some homework or something… Bye, Draco.”
“You might not want to tell anybody, though,” Blaise cuts in, sounding like he’s already over this discovery. “It’s associated with Salazar Slytherin and snakes, so of course it’s got a bad reputation.”
“I will do my best, father,” Draco says with a nod, still smiling.
“My dude, Draco will not
Off to the side Weasley gives Potter a disbelieving glare, like he cannot fathom why Potter would even be suggesting more Slytherins, but Draco ignores him. He feels immensely pleased that at least one of the Golden Trio is taking this seriously.
And Sirius lays, face down, only a few paces in front of it.
This, finally, catches Umbridge’s interest, and a bit more flattery and promises on dirt on Potter is what wins her over.
“Because of what happened yesterday? Are you daft?” the Slytherin glares back. It was clear the trio was on edge, which was making this conversation more infuriating than it needed to be. “You’re an idiot for attacking Montague like that, but I certainly don’t agree with your punishment.”
“Oh, the irony,” Potter smirks, which manages to get all three of them cackling and moving on.
A traitorous, evil part of Draco’s brain pulls up a memory from five years ago, Draco standing in the Holocaust room in the WW2 museum, asking why anyone would hate a group of people so much. Max had said they didn’t know why people were like that. Didn’t know why someone would actively choose hate for no reason but to hate.
But Ada was his least disliked. Usually.
.oOo.
Not long after that breakfast is ready and everyone is sitting excitedly around the table. Ada demanded Draco bring her back something cool and slipped him a few pounds while Frederick offered to let him borrow his camera to take pictures. Draco turned down the camera, but he did take the few pounds. The Nubbles had given him some money as well. They weren’t sure of the general price of things, but they assumed they could always return to purchase any remaining supplies if necessary.
Whatever this room was, it was powerful, but it didn’t appear dangerous. The figures were just talking, not even moving, and it did appear like Blaise was onto something. They weren’t opposites, they were simply…
Surprisingly, or not so, it appears most of the people waiting for Harry and Draco are Gryffindors. The rest of the team has members of their own house waiting to grab them and congratulate them, but that isn’t the case for the two, first-year boys.
He seems right, too, when Umbridge releases a high twitter of a laugh, the sound like nails on a chalkboard.
Draco shifts to rub the side of his face against Potter’s hair, like a giant housecat, and the boy’s words end on a sob, but no crying follows. So, because he isn’t exactly sure what else he can do, Draco begins to purr. It is loud like a motorboat, but something about it must put Potter at ease, because slowly his body begins to slacken, shaking fading, until he’s asleep once more.
“You ARE the bigger asshole, I’ll give you that.”
Potter immediately turns an interesting shade of red and turns to his best friend so quickly Draco thinks he hears his neck snap. They proceed to have a very immature slapping match and, while they’re distracted, Granger leans towards Draco.
“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch and Draco found himself nodding, his body vibrating. He was still a little nervous, but now that the opportunity was finally presenting itself, he felt much, much more excited. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle. Three… Two…”
“And has a dreadful personality,” Potter mumbles, also bringing up a finger like he plans to pet Draco’s head, but Draco whirls his head around fast enough to bite the offending thing before it can touch him. “OW! Jeez, a really, really dreadful personality…”
“Okay, yes, hello everyone,” Ron waves his hands dramatically to cut off any further pleasantries. “Can someone please tell me what is going on, now?”
Ron moves to stand by the broom by Harry’s other side, while Hermione goes beside Draco. The poor girl looks like she’s about to shake right out of her skin, but she has her shoulders back, chest puffed, and head high.
The Records Department is on the same floor as the Atrium but sits far in the back, through a series of hallways and corridors that all look strikingly similar save for the numbers and names on the doors.
“Is that… Is that all you know?” Draco demands, his right hand tightening into a fist, but Eve eases it with one of her own hands.
“Malfoy changed, didn’t he?” Granger says, looking back at the ginger, who grumbles and looks away, clearly not pleased but not having anything else to say.
The corridor, and what Draco is very tentatively identifying as Moody’s scent - which is positively rancid and smells like a poorly made potion instead of a man - leads not further into the castle, but instead right back out. Draco ends up making one big U, growing more and more confused as he hops back out onto the ground.
Draco nods, still petting the shadowy fox, thinking about what this memory must say about him. He is proud of himself for finally succeeding, and he can’t wait to pass on this tutoring, but he can’t help but feel bad, too. He’s meant to be the selfish one, he’s constantly telling people there is pride in taking care of one’s self, but…
“You think,” she says and Draco sees Harry flinch when she yanks his hair even harsher, “that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Tie him up.”
“Krum. I’m serious. Tell no one. And…” Draco glances over to Potter, who has stood up as well and is looking at him with a mixture of suspicion and concern. “Please, allow me to speak to Potter in private. I do not want you getting involved.”
Despite Draco knowing next to nothing about Muggle religions, he still thought he had a good handle on what they were like. Ideals for Muggles, not too different from pureblood ideals, in that you were born into them and encouraged to constantly follow them.
“Your mother is a wise woman, as always,” Draco admits, looking up to his ceiling, his eyes following the grain in the polished wood. “I suppose, then, I am too fearless for your silly horror stories.”
“I am making a formal request to Headmaster Dumbledore now to allow you both your own brooms,” she explains then finishes off her writing with her signature. She looks up and whistles once and a moment later her office door opens on its own and a small, sooty owl flies in. Draco only then realizes there are no windows in this office.
“Didn’t have Chang, you mean,” Draco drawls, because he can’t help himself, and smirks when Potter looks up at him sharply. The other boy opens and closes his mouth a few times, like a fish out of water, but then decides whatever he wants to say isn’t worth it.
“There is one other thing, professor. One thing that I think you’d be interested in,” Draco leans forward, setting down his cup of tea and looking at Umbridge seriously. She arches a brow over her tea, sets down the cup, then folds her hands atop her desk.
“Sounds like he’s the right guy to teach a class about critters then, don’t’cha think?”
The whole of the remaining Slytherins were already told of her arrival, the strictest of prefects they knew how to avoid, and everyone was smart enough not to test both Eve’s and Granger’s wrath.
“That was a box jellyfish…” Eve mumbles, staring in shock at the downed Death Eater.
Draco moves forward, pressing his face to the glass of the window, trying to catch one final glimpse of the merman, but he can’t see anything. Only shadows of small fish as they move by.
“Maybe it’s because its been years, but I just don’t remember you being so… like, listen Draco…” Max struggles for a moment to find their wording and Draco glances over at the radio, expectantly. “Like, you’re not white, you’re translucent.”
Harry snorts without humor, offers Ginny’s hand a squeeze, but sits up and pulls both his hands in towards himself. “Doesn’t matter what I want. There’s no way to talk to him.”
“I think it’s lovely,” Leandra says, standing on Eve’s opposite side.
For a moment they simply look at each other.
But Draco can see them and, when he finally glances up at the group around him and spots Leandra giving him a knowing look, he suspects perhaps she does too.
Draco has no idea what they are talking about, so he has to assume it is Muggle related. He’d ask Eve about it later.
~ ~ ~
but Draco has no other option but to take her hand and be apparated away.
“I’m going to get Luna. This is ridiculous,” Sophie finally groans, grabbing Daphne’s elbow and dragging her away. As they go, Draco can hear Daphne ranting and Sophie blandly telling her to calm down.
A year later he died, suspected of a broken heart, to which it took every fiber of Draco’s being not to scoff. A broken heart wasn’t a cause of death, but rumors weren’t meant to be very accurate.
Narcissa has to take a slow, steadying breath, her brows pinched in mild agitation as she thinks, before she looks at Draco with a very stern look. “I am not happy with you for lying to me,” she says sharply, Draco flinching immediately and ducking his head. “But…” He glances up, his mother still looking tense as she picks up a piece of the broken camera in her son’s arms. It looks like the lens, and she studies it a moment.
“Food must be good; no one’s talking,” Draco hears a girl with straight, mousey hair tied into a ponytail - Daphne Greengrass - say a few seats down and he glances over. She must realize he’s looking because she glances up, turns pink, then clears her throat. “Sorry. Dad always says that.”
by Franz Kafka, and
What am I meant to think?”
“No, Potter, screw you! We’ve been sitting out here for at least an hour and you didn’t mention a thing! Low blow, boy wonder, low--”
Weasley opens his mouth, prepping up another retort, when Eve cuts them off, sounding completely done with their bickering. “You do know ‘Hushburn’ means ‘shut the fuck up or I’ll set you on fire,’ right?” The two boys hesitate, glancing back at the girl, before grumbling and doing their level best to ignore each other for the rest of the interview.
~ ~ ~
Draco snorts and pulls the radio towards him to look at it, not wanting to look at Potter as he speaks. “When I was six I wandered away from my parents and ended up at a museum in Muggle London. I… I met a family there. A Muggle family. Their youngest, Max, is our age and we…”
“I was in an’ outta Gringotts ‘fore any o’ that happened,” Hagrid is quick to say. Too quick. Draco exchanges a baffled look with Harry before taking a calming breath.
After Astronomy the students mill down the tower’s stairs, sluggish and ready for bed, but Draco lingers with Harry. Hermione and Ron offer to stay, but they both urge them to head out. Sinistra walks past them, looking at them blankly for a long, few moments, then says, “You may stay for ten minutes. Then please return to bed.” She then leaves as well, leaving them alone.
And bugs, Draco scowls, smacking at a mosquito that perches on his hand.
And it was
“Ron’s terrier went a tad… off the rails, too,” Harry snickers at his friend, making pink rise on Weasley’s pale cheeks.
Now, though, Draco feels uncomfortable and unhappy. Potter is clearly upset about something, and Draco can’t figure out what. Maybe it’s not even something specific, maybe it’s just the evening as a whole, or the year as a whole, finally catching up to him. Usually, though, when Potter comes to Draco in assistance with dealing with these moods, they do so in complete silence. Sit, read, study, just be in each other’s presence. They don’t usually get this deep.
“The real world is a cruel mistress.”
“It’s fine. The color will change after we add--”
“Agreed,” Draco croaks, nodding, and the two boys turn away swiftly and keep walking down the hall, conversation left behind along with what they had just seen.
“I’m playing errand girl for a child, now?” Skeeter sneers.
Draco releases a long breath and leans more heavily against the stone wall behind him. “Is that the only phrase you know?”
“You can’t adopt every stray you see, you know,” he hisses and she looks unaffected, simply pulling out her book once more.
“What are you talking about?” one of the twins, Draco thinks it’s George from an earlier conversation, leans into the talk. “We malarkey all the time!”
When Lucius finally stormed out of the sitting room, a pompous whirlwind of self-righteous bullshit, Draco took a shuddering breath before kneeling down to pick up the remains of his camera.
It’s a little shocking whenever Daphne curses. She’s a “proper” girl, and it is so rare for her to fall back on foul language.
But… look at the death the Axis Powers had caused, too… how could anyone claim any country was a hero after all of this death? How could any of this be celebrated after all the wrong that had been done?
~ ~ ~
His mother had blindly brought him
“Merlin, just shut the fuck up!”
She hurries over to Draco’s side, patting down her robes, then pauses to glance at the wintery landscape outside the faux window. “You always pick a winter scene,” the muggleborn says as she takes a seat beside Draco.
“Yes, let’s,” Max snickers and they both walk away, Draco’s head held high and Max attempting to mimic him. Max’s father, unfortunately, tries to prove just how cool he is for a while after that until his wife comes over to “comfort” him.
With conversation moving on Draco finds his eyes rolling over the rest of the High Table. Hagrid is throwing back his drink. He looks different in better light, more human, but still very hairy. McGonagall is speaking lowly to Dumbledore, who smiles and nods occasionally, and the man with the turban is turned away, speaking to the woman in the constellation robes. Seeming to sense his eyes on them the woman turns cold, calculating eyes towards Draco, looking at him thoughtfully and--
“That’s what I’ve assumed,” Harry shrugs.
“Be more careful with your things,” he says firmly, pointing at the blonde and frowning until Draco nods an affirmative. Then he’s taking up his aviators and slipping them onto his face. They must be magic because the one side that sits where he is missing an eye and ear doesn’t slip down his face.
They meander through the halls of Hogwarts for some time, never going to Ravenclaw Tower and never moving too far away from Umbridge’s office. Draco isn’t sure if Edgecombe is having second thoughts or stalling.
“Wait, wait, what?” Harry’s eyes widen comically as he turns to the Slytherin beside him. Throughout the entire conversation their hands had been laced together between them, and suddenly Draco is flinching from how tightly Harry is squeezing his hand.
“I gave Potter the Walkman you sent me,” Draco says quietly into his radio the first evening back in the manor.
Draco found the rest of their house mostly competent despite all of that. Sophie was still his Transfiguration partner most of the time and he found he quite liked Daphne and her soft voice and love of classic literature. Tracey creeped him out, but she creeped most everyone out, with her weird obsession with poisons and acid and chaos. Blaise was also a very competent student, but he kept to himself so much that Draco had a hard time determining how he felt about him, and Pansy seemed obsessed with gossip and didn’t mind jumping back and forth between sides depending purely on which entertained her more.
Vivian groans. “I didn’t see who they were either… Just a shadow and then BLOW! Stunned,” the redhead shakes her head, crossing her legs and breathing deeply. “Didn’t even see them raise a wand or nothin’!”
Hermione is the first to smile directly at Draco and step forward, wrapping him up in a hug and squeezing him tight. “I didn’t understand most of what was going on up there,” she admits near his ear, “but I know you were amazing.”
Valentine’s Day, despite all of Draco’s fretting, turns out to be one of the more relaxed days of Draco’s year. The teachers don’t give too much homework the week before, there are all kinds of sweets both in the common rooms and the Great Hall, and even Umbridge is keeping her general distance. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if love was her natural repellant.
Potter hesitates, eying the book like it, or Draco, might bite him, before he shifts and moves over to sit beside Draco, leaning in close to get a good look at the pages.
“I bet you’d be a dog, Weasley,” Draco says, discreetly pulling at Potter’s sleeve until he begins to sag into him. It looked like the Boy Wonder’s energy reserves were beginning to plummet after all the excitement that day.
They’ll just have to do it when they get back…
The blond snorts lightly, his breath ruffling Harry’s hair, then reaches over to help scrub off the drool with his sleeve. “Couldn’t help it,” he mumbles, voice still rough from sleep, and leans in to kiss between Harry’s brows. The lion huffs slow, happy laughter, pressing up against Draco in a demand for more attention.
Draco doesn’t even have a chance to intervene before Harry is yelling, “
She turns back around and, in one fluid, furious motion she pulls a knife from her belt and lunges downward. The knife is plunged into Sirius’s ribcage and Draco hears Harry call out through the roar in his own ears. Blood coats the long, vicious-looking knife when Bellatrix pulls it back out, her laughter shrill and gleeful, and more blood is already pooling under the unconscious wizard.
“Later, Potter,” Draco whispers, raising a hand to run his nails up and down Potter’s back. It makes the other boy positively melt into him, but he doesn’t seem finished.
Draco doesn’t question it, though. Instead, he eyes the tall boy as he hops back into conversation with Max. Eventually Longbottom gets back to work, but Draco decides waiting around an extra hour or two more than usual isn’t that bad of an idea.
“He’s dreadful, Max! I’m telling you, Harry Potter is a right git!” Draco paces angrily through the Astronomy Tower. It was night out and he was supposed to be down in his dorm, asleep at the moment, but he couldn’t get his mind to shut off. Sneaking around the castle was hard, but thankfully Peeves avoided the dungeons and the entrance to the tower wasn’t too far away, so it had become his late-night hideaway.
“Earth to Draco,” Blaise sing-songs, right before chucking a pillow at the blond, Draco scrambling to catch the projectile and launch it back at the other boy. He and Theodore were grinning like mad, while Crabbe and Goyle looked a little lost, but still entertained.
“Only in passing, sir,” the blonde replies with a nod then glances back to look at Harry, whose tan cheeks are a brilliant shade of ruby. Why did the boy look so embarrassed, now? Was it because of his father, or… “Did… Harry mention me, then?” he asks, sounding as casual as he could, and judging by Harry’s panicked squeak he suspects he got that right.
Weasley throws his powder and disappears in the green flames, Draco hardly waiting before he’s following after.
McGonagall doesn’t wait to continue, calling out “Finch-Fletchley, Justin,” who becomes a Hufflepuff. When it was Greg’s turn Draco straightened up again to watch more closely.
“Oodles…”
“I know. She’s been showing me around everywhere and teaching me about this world.”
Damn it all, he was supposed to have been able to get in before the task started. Sirius was probably already done and heading down to the pitch, and Draco hates that he hopes his own godfather may be the culprit just so that this whole mission won’t be in vain.
“And you clearly saw right through them,” Draco hums, matching her cheerfulness, his hands curling into fists at his side until he’s sure his nails will draw blood.
Their library table was always a mess of her notes and books, scattered as she attempted to go through them and find what she needed. It left Eve and Draco to stare at her in wonder for a long while before finally stepping in.
“Right… speaking of Max…” the Gryffindor says slowly and, with a grunt, he sits up and crosses his legs. “That’s what I was getting at earlier.”
I will
“I… might have taken a glance at it the other day. You left it open and I peaked over and…” Eve stops, her eyes widening in surprise when Leandra levels her with a displeased glare. A Leandra-glare was a rare thing, indeed.
“Proof?” Draco arches a brow, confused why Snape would come to him with this. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it hits him and he narrows his eyes. “This is because of last year, when I proved Sirius Black’s innocence, isn’t it? You did not take it so well.”
Draco would offer the odd girl a smile, if he could, but he hopes his eyes translate the sentiment well enough. Luna smiles airily, then turns and hurries into her common room.
“Is mama talking about the brain again?” Max’s voice springs suddenly into Draco’s ear as the Muggle child slides into the booth beside him. “Mama’s a brain scientist!”
(not really a song, but can you imagine Draco with Mrs. Nubble???)
Even with the potions in his system, however, Draco’s mind still hasn’t fully recovered from the rapid-fire events of the last… however many minutes. He doesn’t hear the door to the infirmary open, nor does he see Dumbledore enter and speak to the resident mediwitch. He only notices Dumbledore when he has stepped up to his bed, a twinkle in his eyes, and a very soft smile on his face.
He also wonders where they plan to even have these classes. They will need to be secret, but what kind of places in Hogwarts would work for that? And empty classroom seemed the most logical,  but that had plenty of issues of its own.
Max’s laughter fills the room and Draco can’t fight the faint smile that flutters onto his lips.
“That’s why I am assuming this rubbish with a superpowered piece of jewelry might have begun as something less savory,” Draco explains, “Pureblood prejudice against blood-traitors is pretty blatant. Spitting at them, mistreating them, calling them names. Prejudice against pureblood families from outside of Europe, however, is a bit more crafty. Damaging rumors, secret conspiracies, passive-aggressive aversion.”
Potter, reluctantly, stands as well, then clearly thinks something over before he’s stepping forward and wrapping Draco up in a tight hug. Draco’s arms are pinned to his side, but even if he could physically reciprocate, Potter is pulling away before the action can process in Draco’s head.
They’ve done this before, it shouldn’t be hard anymore, but Weasley turns out to be a bigger hazard than they could have guessed.
Gemma goes on and on a bit longer, bashing Gryffindor at one point and making Draco scowl, and explains the password for the dorms will change every fortnight, so they need to keep an eye on the noticeboard. She warns never to hand out the password and not to bring anyone into their common room. “No outsider has entered it for more than seven centuries,” she adds smugly, and Draco really, really doubts that. Seven centuries? That’s too long for something like that.
It’s quiet and peaceful and Draco’s brain begins working without his permission.
Behind her, Weasley looks grave but determined, surely agreeing with her, and Mrs. Weasley keeps gently running her fingers through Potter’s hair.
“That was amazin--” Ron begins but Draco quickly, and sharply, shushes him. They shouldn’t say anything while they’re still in earshot of Theodore and Millicent, they have to remain in complete control until out of sight.
“Not unless the culprit is a pureblood that they trust and, thus, their Trace records are generally ignored,” Draco flippantly. “Good for them, as they attempt to fix the blunder they have a very willing underage wizard at their disposal to help them out.”
“Why are you here if you clearly wish to be somewhere else?” Draco Malfoy, age six, looks up at Max’s odd older brother. Eric is tall and spindly, with brown hair the same shade as Max’s but with a purposeful messiness to it that Draco can’t understand.
Draco sighs and does just that, because what else can he do?
As it turns out the centaur, Firenze, managed to scare off the hooded figure after Draco and Potter had absconded, then rushed to try and find them. The forest was no place for children, he’d said, and Draco couldn’t have agreed more.
“They,” Draco pauses to giggle, “they found the spell in some old tomes and didn’t know what it did and,” a bit more giggling, “Well, they used it on a mouse. But nothing happened! So, they kept using it over and over and over again until the mouse killed itself. Same thing happened with every mouse they used it on.”
“At the end of World War 2 America-- “
The conversation goes on for a while longer, until the sun has finally set and it is time to head for bed. Not much else is said, not much else needs to be said, until they come to the point where they will head for their own houses. Still, tired from the day, they have little to say, and instead just smile at each other.
He hands over the picture. “Do you know who this is, Minister?”
“I know, right? Just the other day my friend at school had to move and it was so scary and stressful! Well, it was only a few streets away, but now I can’t walk to their house anymore, I have to get my bike, and…”
That surprises the other boy enough to get him to step back. He’s back to looking suspicious and frustrated. “Seriously?”
The room falls silent, looking over at the spacey girl, but she does not acknowledge them further, so they go back to their own talking.
“That kind of stuff doesn’t exist,” Draco rolls his eyes and finally stands up, brushing dirt off his trousers. They were from a charity shop a few blocks away and were incredibly soft, if a bit raggedy.
“To have you sacked on the grounds of a condition that has little to no bearing on one’s character, and that, through basic logic, one can determine you did not deliberately acquire, is a repugnant affair that should be openly admonished.”
Harry falls silent, looking down at his shoes as he scuffs them on the stone floor, and Draco rolls his eyes skyward. “Alright, well, whatever, I’m going to go eat dinner with Slytherin for once. I won’t force you to, but I would quite like it if you came with me, seeing as you’re my only friend over there.” With that Draco turns away and marches back into the Great Hall, back straight and stride confident. He offers a nod towards Hermione when he sees her, and she smiles back as he makes his way to his house’s table.
Nonetheless, it meant Max’s father had a ton of bizarre little machines and inventions with him at all times. He had a crossbody bag full of “disposable cameras,” “GPS’s,” and “pens.” It also meant he was incredibly excited to examine every piece of machinery in the WW2 museum, dragging his family, and subsequently Draco, along for the ride.
“It was part of a ‘proper pureblood upbringing’,” he grumbles, using air quotes and everything.
The door opens and closes on its own, leaving Draco with the dumbest of smiles on his face, and a bit more energy in his step as he turns and heads into his bathroom for a shower.
“She spoils Tsuki, too,” Eve rolls her eyes.
“I am here to surprise my father,” Draco replies evenly, his head held high and he blinks down at the official in disdain. “I already know where his office is, so don’t bother.”
“Thank you.”
“He did WHAT?!” Weasley yelps, grinning like a fool as, quite abruptly, this all becomes far more entertaining to him. Granger also looks surprised and reaches up to cover her mouth to likely keep from giggling, while Harry just looks mortified.
“Well… I’ve just been worried how you might be feeling as the only one in our group who hasn’t mastered both the Patronus and Militus Charms yet,” Harry says abruptly, settling to just drop everything in a rush, but it leaves Draco confused.
” he says clearly and shadowy wisps jump from his wand, merging and shifting until they trot onto the ground as a puffy, arctic fox. Draco is still mesmerized by how the shadows move within the Militus, how they look like wrought iron but alive.
Across the Great Hall Draco feels eyes on them and he looks over. Theodore and Millicent are glaring at their ensemble, looking more vicious than usual, and then Theodore’s eyes flick towards Neville and his gift. The tall boy’s eyes get a glint to them and then he’s smirking. Draco glares back at him, but can do nothing except keep an eye out. He has a feeling the upcoming flying lesson is going to be an eventful one.
“I… don’t think they are, actually,” Blaise cuts in, moving suddenly from his spot against the wall to crouch beside Draco. He sets a hand between the snow leopard’s shoulder blades, urging him to settle down, and Draco does grudgingly. He doesn’t take his eyes off the figures, though.
He can’t lose his radio. He can’t lose the single connection he has to Max and Max’s family. They’ve helped him through some of the worst times of his life. Take his camera, take his records, take his books, pictures, candy, and “cassettes.” But don’t take his radio.
“Beautiful, Draco, positively beautiful,” Max’s mother is saying, her voice a little faint since the entire family is trying to speak through their radio.
Standing in the middle of Draco’s dorm room are Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson. They’re looking at Draco rather smugly as he enters, like they know something he doesn’t, matching, thin smiles. What a lovely way to wrap up his Thursday.
“I want you all to quit forgetting that the only reason Potter is in this situation to begin with is because someone wants to murder him!” Draco roars, Weasley snapping his mouth shut, Granger looking away, and Potter scowling even deeper.
“The Ministry is officially announcing the return of Voldemort,” Harry says in amazement, eyes wide as he reads.
Out of the corner of his eye Draco can see many of the other students, namely Potter’s friends, steaming in quiet fury. Draco hopes he isn’t as obvious as them.
“I think I don’t have any other choice…”
you to tell me. I’m sorry about the other day. I don’t… like fighting with you anymore. Well, I never did, but it used to be because I didn’t like you and you were obnoxious and self-centered, but now… I just don’t like it…”
“I’m sure it must have been very taxing,” Potter says, a small, teasing smile on his face, and for a moment he and Draco lock eyes. Potter’s green eyes are distant, but not as distant as they had been. Ever since the end of fourth year there had been that underlying layer, but now there was a touch of playfulness and a glow of gratitude. They laugh at Draco despite the pain just beneath.
“Back away! Back away!” Lily commands, hurrying over. Seamus jumps onto his stool as the “potion” pours onto the floor then begins to eat at the legs of the table and stools. Nearly all the class is up on their stools a second later. Lily attempts to get Neville out of the vicinity, but it is too late, the concoction already hitting skin, and she hurries to vanish what remains of it.
“Yeah! Or you’ll go grey faster than Percy,” says the other, also smirking. It made it near impossible to tell them apart, but there had to be a way and Draco wondered if he could figure it out.
“No, but I am certain you are going to tell me,” Draco drawls.
“‘We?’ It’s not just you trying to be a nice boyfriend?” Draco arches a brow, scrambling to get some of his shields back up, but they fall short when Harry smiles, a little sad.
“I didn’t hear nothin’, the cheering was too loud, but I saw… well, here’s the weird part. I saw Sinistra mumbling some gibberish, but I
“Your ten minutes are up,” Sinistra says behind him, having apparently come back up when Draco had his back turned, and the blonde looks back, too drained to feel startled. He looks at her and she stares at him with her blank, calculating eyes. She almost looks like she’s trying to figure out a puzzle, but it is hard to tell and Draco doesn’t feel up to deciphering anything.
“You were? Why?” Weasley questions, eyes thinning suspiciously.
“Breakfast for Linner?” Max’s mother questions, but she’s smiling.
The natural response was panic. After a full year of having to be careful in public it had become a normal fear. They couldn’t let anyone know, especially Umbridge. But Umbridge had been stopped by a furious staff and the Roper family had furiously demanded her immediate removal for putting Sophie in a temporary cursed sleep.
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Right, he had a job to do, and they were counting on him to do it quickly. He wastes no further time as he turns and rushes out of the room. His first thought is to go to his godfather. Snape is part of the Order, Harry told him so, but Draco thinks he has another solution that would be even quicker.
Finally, after getting so tense he was near shattering, Draco moves, hands scrabbling at his robes before he pulls out a bundle of photographs from an inside pocket, tied together with string, and hands them over. “I have no use for these. Do with them as you see fit,” he says sharply. The photos are some of the ones he had taken when getting the damning evidence against Peter Pettigrew. These particular ones he had made sure to hide away, never to allow anyone but Lupin to see.
“No, Max, you aren’t. They barely even made you get glasses, remember?” Harry tries to reason and, finally, Draco takes pity on him.
“To new opportunities!”
“Well done, Neville!” Harry’s calls out, hurrying over. Sirius has turned back to give them cover, trying to buy them a chance to run. They’ll be slowed down by Tracey having to drag Weasley, but if they can keep this up they might have a chance. “Which reminds me…”
“I believe this is yours,” she says through gritted teeth, trying to keep her composure, and she holds out her hand where she grips a squirming Muddy.
” he says lowly, clearly, and from his wand shadows begin to emerge, curling around each other and compressing. Twisting, moving designs like wrought iron, like they had been on Sinistra’s cobra, now curl around the form of a sly-looking fox. Draco’s Militus stares back at him, sitting regally on the carpet, its pinprick eyes unnerving.
Draco had shut up after that. Granger kept smirking at him smugly.
“Wouldn’t I be intruding? Isn’t this as much of an escape for you, too?” Potter asks and his voice sounds thin. Almost confused, but not quite. It makes something in Draco’s gut twist, so he puts on a smarmy mask and gives Potter a bland look.
“I’m fine,” he whispers, then forces himself to step back, “We can’t get distracted, though. I don’t know how long Umbridge will be at the Tower before she starts looking all throughout the castle.”
“Why can’t he be crazy AND a genius?” calls the redheaded girl from down the table, a big smile on her face, “They tend to go hand-in-hand anyway.” A few of the other Slytherins look at the girl like there’s some inside joke there and she begins to laugh. Draco hardly notices, still staring at the food in amazement.
“Myself and Granger have an idea,” he’d begun to explain to Longbottom, earning the Gryffindor’s full attention, “That, depending on the individual and their life, it may be easier for some to learn the Militus before the Patronus, or vice versa. It is entirely possible that you will have higher success once we begin training on the Militus Charm.”
“You doing alright, Draco?” he asks as the other gives Harry a once over.
Most of these documents have to do with Crouch’s work and not his personal life, but Draco does come across a few interesting bits the more he digs.
He didn’t cry too often over the radio, but after that he still lost count. Sometimes he was handed off to another member of Max’s family who was better suited for the particular problem. Eric was great with things to do with anxiety while Max’s father was just good at making Draco smile again. Max was good at simply calming Draco down enough to talk, but Max’s mother was the true MVP.
Draco blinks owlishly before his face turns pink and he scrambles to muss up the slicked back, blonde locks. He feels ruffled and surprised as he finally says, “Harry Potter?”
He ends up buying the green lava lamp, too, and they walk out the door laden with items Draco doubts he will ever, actually use. He doesn’t care, however, because he’s happy, Eve is chattering, and Potter is smiling and laughing so much that, for a while, all their problems really do just disappear.
When he tries to talk to Hermione about it that evening, however, she wants nothing to do with him, still upset about what he had done the previous night. It seems their exciting Potions class wasn’t quite enough to put her into a good mood with him, so he leaves her be and lets her sort out her grievances. There’s no point in pushing her, he knew that, just as there was never any point in pushing him. They both needed time to manage their negative moods when they got to be too much. They were truly birds of a feather…
All through October Hogwarts had slowly gained more and more Halloween decorations. By the actual final day of the month everywhere Draco looked there was some kind of charmed bat or cartoony ghost or floating candies. The pumpkins were his favorite though. He’d seen Hagrid growing the massive things for some time now and had, on more than one occasion, climbed up the largest ones and declared himself king of the gourds.
“Oh, yeah, definitely! You listened to me even when I got super obnoxious, you danced with me, and we got to pick on my brother together! It meant a lot to me… Papa always says it’s important to love ourselves, but sometimes people need reminding that other people love them, too, so we should always let people know when we appreciate or care about them, and I super appreciate you, Draco!”
“What a coincidence. So am I,” Harry smiles, free and joyful like he hadn’t been in so long, and Draco presses down until their lips are meeting in yet another kiss, his purr and Harry’s laughter intermingling with every move.
“Obviously,” Draco replies, “I’m stunning.” Eve discreetly elbows his side.
“Were they at least nice snakes?” Eve asks sweetly, nudging Potter’s shoulder playfully.
A small, humorous smile plays at Narcissa’s lips, her eyes twinkling with an openness she dares not show to the outside world. Here with her son, however, her edges soften. “I do,” she replies lowly, “What would you like to know?”
“Roger that, Draco,” Fred mock salutes.
That is until, right as January was starting and classes were starting up again, Max came onto the radio with an unholy groan of misery.
“It’s cause and effect,” Blaise reaffirms, looking around at the room. Draco looks, too, and he’d frown if he could. Did it look like the black and white of the room was suddenly… different? The black looked lighter and the white looked darker, seeming to be losing their contrast to each other. “But it’s also things that… seem like opposites?” Draco tilts his head in consideration with his housemate.
“That is very kind.”
“People experience disassociation in a variety of ways. Some feel a separation from the body, like they are floating just above looking in. Others may feel reality has shifted just a little sideways and they cannot reintroduce themselves. Others might feel a clear split between themselves and the world around them, or like a wall has constructed itself around their presence of mind and they are instead ruled by instincts. Who are we to question what someone experiences in their silent traumas?”
There, in front of Draco’s eyes, is one of his and Skeeter’s articles. “The True Lives of Nagas” by Daisy Hayworth. Each one of these articles began with “The True Lives of…” creating consistency for readers. Draco hadn’t expected them to garner a fan name, however, and certainly not “Creature Files.”
It isn’t that the thestrals need any extra attention. They’re well taken care off by Hagrid, Luna, and Tracey - with the occasional assistance from Theodore - but Draco still finds himself drawn to them on a regular basis. Sometimes he brings meat, sometimes he brings playthings, sometimes he just brings himself and his camera…
Dead silence follows that, Draco staring at the two men before him with blank, cold eyes. All his life he tried to imitate his father, saying what he said, doing as he did, but now… Now he channeled every last bit of Narcissa Malfoy into his stare.
on your head?”
He’d pulled files on all the professors at Hogwarts, mostly as a precaution, when he’d been in the Records Department. Most said everything he already knew, and he’d avoided them unless he felt suspicious of them. These were his teachers and most, if not all, were probably innocent. It wouldn’t do to make things awkward unless he had to.
“Going with a wizard would surely be an additional ‘fuck you’ to your relatives,” Draco smiles, resolutely refusing to call the Dursley’s Potter’s “family.”
Eve and Granger, however, don’t quite get why he’s so excited.
It is not for the first time that Draco has edged away from an over-eager Max when they start going on and on about Thompson submachine guns. He feels queasy, and the dainty hand on his shoulder helps center him.
“And if none of this helps? If I still can’t cast a Patronus Charm?” Longbottom flaps his hands desperately, eyes comically wide.
“They must be larger on the insides,” Draco muses as the two begin to walk, both looking around at the expanse in amazement. There are hundreds of doors and hundreds of domes, each seemingly unique.
Harry is fucking terrified and Draco isn’t sure what to do with that. He’s scared too, but he hasn’t been facing off against Death Eaters this whole time, unsure if he’ll make it out alive or not.
Draco releases a breath and forces his shoulders to loosen, nodding at Potter as Weasley begins to speak. “I guess…” They all look over to the ginger, who looks pained with what he’s about to say. He can hardly get the words out. “I mean… yeah, I guess… Even
Fudge eyes Draco closely, before taking in a deep breath and laying a hand on the blonde’s shoulder. “Your concern is exemplary, and your father would be proud, but it is unnecessary. The truth
The Snaffler test is a success, thankfully, and Harry only sustains small bruising against his shoulder when the Bludger-Acting ball had smacked him. A healing potion from Vivian’s bottomless bag fixes that up in a jiffy, though, and then the two boys are taking a normal Quaffle and going back out, into the air, to practice even more.
Eve had gone off to examine some hair products while Potter lingers near Draco, both uncertain where to even begin. They get help from a store employee, a girl named Terry with wild, black hair streaked with a rainbow of colors, an oversized leather jacket decked in spikes, torn up jeans, a flannel shirt tied around her waist, and so much black jewelry in her face she looks like a cactus.
“How much farther?” Draco hisses under his breath, glaring daggers at the back of Theodore’s head, who turns to shoot his own glare back. He doesn’t get an answer.
When the blonde steps out of the bathroom, feeling far more refreshed and ready for sleep, he catches a shadow outside their window. He had spotted the giant squid multiple times since that first night, sometimes as a distant shadow, but one time so close Draco saw its eye looking back at them. This shadow is smaller, though, and at first Draco thinks it could just be a fish, until he spots what he thinks are arms near the front.
“Okay, then where is it?” Weasley snaps back at the blond, Draco’s hackles quickly rising, but Harry is the one to come to the save.
Draco hesitates, eying the radio suspiciously, before he takes a deep, weary breath and asks, “I will regret asking this… What does pizza have to do with this?”
“I am finally
Plus the same picrew to design how I imagine the good Slytherin gals Pansy, Sophie, Tracey, Daphne, and Astoria
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, tell me where they went!”
Whatever rumor Lucius must have heard, however, was likely nothing good…
“I want to go to Leadenhall Market. You’ll love it! It looks like a Muggle version of Diagon Alley, so you’ll feel right at home.”
A few hands raise and Draco looks out to identify everyone. Daphne, Astoria, Eve, Angelina, and even Leandra all have their hands raised, but that’s it. Draco knows he, himself, has managed to fight it off, along with a good number of purebloods in Slytherin, but he’d really expected more people to have been able to.
