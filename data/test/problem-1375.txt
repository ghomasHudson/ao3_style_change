“Yes, we’re almost there-” Draco broke off as a hooded figure stepped in front of him. He let out a muffled scream and made for his wand.
You are the bloodiest Gryffindor in the history of Gryffindors. Of course you have taken it upon yourself to save the Weasley girl. Of course you couldn’t leave it to the adults for once in your life. I will not waste my time worrying this time. There’s probably nothing down there in the Chamber. I have no idea how Ginerva got down there but it wasn’t anything to do with Salazar Slytherin. It wasn’t. You’re going to come back. You’re going to come back in a few days and we’ll end up screaming at each other on the train back home. In a few hours everything will be fine again and you will be back safe. Not that you’re not safe right now. I’m sure you’re having a perfectly fine time with the Weasleys down there. You’re perfectly fine and I’m sure by the time I’m done writing this letter you will be back. And probably awarded hundreds of house points for some bullshit you did down in the chamber. Anyway, you make my life miserable. There are so many ways I could be spending my time and yet the only thing I can seem to do is worry. So, screw you Potter. I hate you.
“Not yet,” Blaise says. “She wants to do it before we get introduced to the whole prison population though, apparently somebody told her that bondings may stop alphas from attacking me, did you know that?”
“And… you know why he wants to be there.” Somehow, Draco immediately knows she’s talking about Harry.
“Everybody here wants to only speak in cryptic riddles.” Draco roll his eyes. “What on earth is that rubbish supposed to mean?” Lucius’s eyes flash. No matter how hard he tries, when he starts yelling, he has a bit of a west country accent. When he speaks again, he struggles to maintain his breathing and sound as posh as possible.
It feels incredible though. Draco has never experienced it, except in class when it was taught, but he always feels calmed when he just imagines this hold. In this situation, if Draco had just been physically beaten, a touch like this would sooth his shattered nerves until they could sew themselves back up.
to Draco, per se, but people in the real world always touch omegas, even ones as tetchy as he is. He is embarrassed to realize how much he’s been touched, even by strangers. He used to think he was shunned. Absurdly, he misses Pansy, even though she always lied to him. He misses the twins when they lived in Malfoy Manor. He misses Celeste.
“Crack the walls, Draco!” He’d originally been angry at Blaise, but maybe the water could get to Astrid too. She’s climbing onto Maleka’s top bunk as Draco’s water rises.
Lucius doesn’t pretend it’s a possibility that Draco won’t be here permanently in two weeks. For that, Draco is thankful.
Once, maybe two years ago, Draco had gotten off one of those planes somewhere in the Balkans and followed a shadowy man into a secluded wood. The muggle police had apparently discovered a stash of Dolohov’s horrible drugs and the only solution was to burn a lab. As soon as the torch touched that gasoline, the fire quickly followed the path of black liquid from right next to Draco’s feet the whole way into the little shack. It started slow and then exploded, all at once. There was an anticipation to that, a kind of drama that Draco wasn’t used to. He dreams about it sometimes.
Pansy looks confused, possibly for the first time he’s even known her. “What exactly do you want Draco?”
be, but I cannot help you with violent crimes.” Barnaby looks as if he is being punished. “I know that you are something of a sweetheart, Dra—”
Potter looks more annoyed than surprised. However, it’s impossible that he could prepare for the stinging slap that Draco gifts him across the face, which Draco didn’t expect himself.
Lucius is doing a remarkable job of ignoring him. “Do you see me crying every time something goes awry, Draco?”
If Astrid weren’t an insufferable person, he may have told her that he could feel the foundations down to where they were bolted into the ground. He could almost tell the exact dimensions of every room North and South of himself. If he concentrated enough, he was sure he could sense his father, pacing up and down his cell and mumbling to himself.
they took Felix to boost the research,” Draco says testily, an indication he didn’t believe it then and doesn’t believe it now.
He needs more, he needs them to be wearing fewer clothes; and the thought of how it would feel if they were naked only makes Harry rock his hips harder, desperately seeking friction. He slides his hands under Draco’s shirt, all the way up his back, and Draco shivers under the slow drag of his fingernails. His shirt rides up at the front and Harry can see a glorious patch of pale skin, Draco’s toned stomach, and a trail of dark blond hair under his navel, going down and disappearing under his belt. The sight alone makes Harry’s mouth go dry. He wants to slide his hand down that stomach, wants to drag his fingers over the coarse hairs and cup that bulge, feel the hard evidence that Draco loves it just as much as he does.
“Yes,” Draco says lowly. “Remember that illegal potions case in April? The one with the pharmacy, Risewell's, I believe it was called?” At Harry’s nod, he continues. “We’ve finally got the samples for testing—extremely potent Amortentia, that one. I decided to take the interns off that particular case, it was… distressing.”
Harry had almost forgotten the overwhelming feeling of being full, of being so intimately close to another person it set his body on fire. There was a steady pressure of mounting arousal building up deep under his belly as Draco set off an agonising rhythm, carefully pushing in and out as he stretched Harry to fully accommodate him.
And anyway, it doesn’t have to be the case for Draco. But it might, quite, definitely be a little bit for Harry.
Draco’s shivering, his legs barely keeping him in position, and Harry adds his tongue alongside the two fingers, adding to the stretch and laving his abused hole with wet, gentle swipes of tongue.
Harry’s curiosity wins. “For… you know.” He hangs his head, too embarrassed to look at Draco right now.
,” Harry moans and captures Draco’s mouth, again and again, every hungry, bruising kiss leaving him blind with desire.
For years, the Ministry has been tracking them down, exhausting its resources to keep playing a frustrating game of cat and mouse. They were smarter than Voldemort’s lot—taking cruel, mindless bloodlust out of the equation has left more space for calculated risks, politics, and clever manoeuvres that required brains rather than brawn. The latter were either dead or locked up in Azkaban so the former could rise to the surface, with full vaults and a
? Is there anything you can’t do?” Malfoy’s voice is still strained but apparently, he’s never in too much pain to treat Harry with a spectacular sneer. “How do you do it anyway?”
Harry smiles and follows him, anticipation stirring in his gut; he’s calmed down a bit but his cock is still half-hard and so is Draco’s, judging by the telling bulge he shamelessly parades down the hall. They barely cross the threshold and Draco is on him in seconds, holding him by the hip, one hand fisted in his hair and Harry moans, and steers them in the general direction of the king-size bed. There’s a single lamp in the corner, bathing the room in a warm, golden glow, just enough so the room isn’t pitch-black. Harry gently pushes Draco down onto the sheets and watches him crawl up the bed to make room—propped against the headboard, he looks like a god of depravity, all tousled hair and flushed skin dappled with warm light. His shirt is open at the collar, his bare toes are digging into the sheets—he’s absolutely, devastatingly gorgeous. Harry quickly follows; he takes off his shoes and socks and climbs onto the bed to straddle Draco’s hips.
And now that threatening, desperate look was back. The instinct to hide, to run or play dead peeking out from deep in his subconscious as Draco snarled at Harry, telling him he’s an idiot, telling him he has to save himself, to make sure he survives whatever fate throws at them next. If his eyes shone with unshed tears, Harry didn’t acknowledge it.
If the faint outlines Draco could feel against his back were any indication, the rest of Potter’s body was built just as deliciously as his arse, and thank the Maker for chiselling that one out with some extra divine care.
Harry extends his hand without thinking, he sometimes does it on instinct, and stops half an inch from the middle of Malfoy’s chest, focusing on the spell. He can feel the heat radiating from his body, extending to accept the magic Harry’s channelling into the spell. Wandless magic has got surprisingly easy in the last few years—Harry discovered he had a knack for it by accident and never really stopped, but only after Hermione made sure he’s not going to burn his own hand off. During a trip to India five years ago, they met some older witches and wizards who were taught to use their magic like that by their grandparents, and Harry has been fascinated with honing the skill ever since. Apparently, his little talent is a combination of genes, luck, and the exceptional magical capabilities he apparently possesses. It started with small things—Summoning a quill so as not to get up and distract himself from work, unlocking drawers when the key was nowhere to be found, casting a quick
By the time Harry got to the longest, thickest feathers, outlining the tips of the wings, the air in the room was imbued with Draco’s scent. Harry was so preoccupied with the task, he’d simply let it encapsulate him, not realising how potent it was until he took a break to admire his handiwork.
“Oh, I know, let’s make it a bet!” Ginny says, looking around. “Any of us can propose a candidate to go out with Harry. If he ends up going to the wedding with one of them, the person who introduced them takes it all!” Her eyes are already gleaming the same way they do before a Quidditch match. The fiercest of the Weasley clan is already calculating the odds, her fingers carding through Luna’s hair with renewed vigour. She pauses. “Unless, uh. Harry, are you okay with that?”
As soon as Harry comes over, he hears the man’s low voice. “Shame he doesn’t like sharing, I wouldn’t mind watching you two,” he says, smiling impishly as he looks Harry up and down. In different circumstances, Harry might even pause to look back at him—he’s reasonably built, with thick, black eyelashes and stubble that would feel
The thing about war was that it never changed. Magical or not, fought with wands, or bombs, or rifles—it was always the same. It was people riled up against one another, fighting a fight they never wanted, for powers they never met. It was like waiting at a train station with no schedule—something was bound to happen, but it was impossible to know when, and only time would tell if things to come were good or bad.
On the other hand, perhaps he did need a fresh look, maybe his technique (or lack thereof) was the problem. Or maybe Harry himself was the problem, maybe there was something…
“No, no! I don’t think that!” Harry says defensively, a little ashamed his thoughts went straight there. Some apocalyptic part of his mind just assumed that if Draco knew an attractive, affable young man, it was only logical they would hit it off and ride off into the sunset together. “So…”
Harry immediately understood what Draco meant about the difficulties. His wings were… magnificent, in size as well as looks. Two huge appendages looming over Draco’s back, covered in large, sharp feathers that got smaller and fluffier towards the bottom; the longest ones, near the outer edges, were possibly the size of Harry’s forearm, reflecting the dim light from the lamp in the corner. The feathers weren’t exactly white—it was a delicate ivory, similar to Draco’s hair, only accentuating his porcelain skin.
Summoning a generous amount of lube, Harry circles his index finger around Draco’s hole and casts Cleansing and Protective Charms, feeling the muscle give under the pressure, nearly sucking his finger in. Without warning, he slips it in to the second knuckle, making Draco yelp and buck under the steady grip Harry has on his hip. Slowly, he starts to pump his finger in and out, trying out different angles until Draco clenches around the digit with a low moan.
An older Auror walks out of a frosted glass door with a ‘Head Auror’ sign, carrying a specific air of authority that immediately feels imposed rather than earned. The corner of the stranger’s mouth twitches imperceptibly as he stands by the entrance on the opposite side of the large room. Calm and collected, he patiently waits to be acknowledged although he is not one who likes to wait, nor has he ever gone unnoticed for so long.
a few vials, despite being explicitly told not to take anything outside the laboratory,” he says, lips folded into a thin line, clearly still bitter about the events. “Anyway, I didn’t manage to research it as much as I would have liked to, but I learned enough not to trifle with it.”
—Harry wants to show him that no pain needs to be inflicted in order to distract, that he can make Draco forget his own name using pleasure as his only tool.
“Draco.” Harry runs a hand through his hair. “I’ve had a rough night. If it’s bad, I can ask Claire to bring you the bottled kind. Or tea. Or coffee—”
It’s bad, it looks so bad, and Draco’s bleeding out, letting out soft, choked gurgles, and Harry doesn’t know what to do. There are footsteps in the background but he can’t lose his focus, he can’t let Draco die after everything they’ve been through.
“Yes sir,” the other one nods and each of them grabs Malfoy by one of his elbows. He doesn’t put up a fight, just throws Harry one last glance and it’s a warning, a plea, and a flowery
, and Harry’s repressed need unfurls in his chest, the love, the need to nurture and care too big and scary to keep it all in, and Draco carries them through it and Harry doesn’t think he has ever loved that much, that openly.
In effect, those above him leave him be; the lesser ones know their place. The ones he deems his equals are scarce and the only one in the vicinity is nowhere to be seen, forever going against all odds and expectations.
Harry tightens the hold around his wand, not very keen on saving Malfoy’s arse. At the same time, if Malfoy gets killed, they will be back to square one.
“For the record, I did knock, you were all just too busy screaming about how hot I am, which, well,” Draco says in that calm, collected voice, the smallest smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
They part, and Draco takes a step back, gazing at Harry with a heavy expression. Harry closes the door shut and rushes down the hall.
“I wonder what he was looking for with me, then,” Draco said, his brow furrowed in genuine bemusement.
They had a fight that night—a nasty, unnecessary fight with Draco yelling at him to go after the man, to get that spot back just in case something bad happens. Harry screamed back, about Draco being insane, thinking Harry would go anywhere without him, no matter what happens, no matter how many wars erupt around them. He wasn’t going to run away—he was tired of running and hiding, and the thought of losing Draco, of being separated, made something dark and ugly fill his lungs and make his throat burn. Draco’s face was twisted with fear and anger and he looked at Harry as if
, and he could swear there are sparks dancing between them as Harry feels the soft crackle of bone bending to his will and mending back together.
Harry’s injuries turn out to be superficial, with only one deeper gash that’s quickly dealt with thanks to a little bit of Dittany. He’s discharged in under twenty minutes which means he can now go and find out about Draco. Covered in bruises, in a jacket that still carries the stench of curses, Harry corners the first Healer he sees, demanding information on Draco’s condition. The young man doesn’t know much and, quite terrified, asks Harry to have patience and maybe to go get some rest, explaining that the Healers are doing everything they can to stabilise Mr Malfoy. It’s all the same shite they always say to stifle people’s conscience and get them off their back and Harry takes advantage of the adrenaline still buzzing in his system and demands to see Draco.
“Do I look like I’m deaf, Mr Swan?” Draco asks and the boy shakes his head vigorously. “Good, I should hope so. I assure you, I am quite capable of opening a door myself, especially seeing that I am not the one who was assigned a task. A task that you failed, Mr Swan.”
“Life, Harry, my dear boy,” Ginny says gravely and Harry snorts. Fine, whatever. He’s done this so many times already, it can’t hurt to just go along with it.
They’re silent for a while and if Harry’s heart was speeding up before, it’s now completely out of control, fluttering with pride, and yearning, and understanding that dawns on him as he weighs Draco’s words. Because Draco, to be with Harry, to truly be with him, needed to feel that he chose it. And this, it’s Draco choosing him.
“If you agree to take the deal, then yes,” Harry grits out. “If you decide to defect later on, or don’t give the testimony needed to take them down, you'll automatically be tried with the rest,” he says. “So what’s it gonna be, Malfoy?”
), Harry decides it’s best to leave. As he conducts a sneaky retreat, the barista finally notices him.
-liked him in a way that implied thinking about him when he shouldn’t, and Harry knew because Pansy told Hermione and Hermione told Harry and while it all felt a tad juvenile, Harry had held that information close to his chest and kept coming up with reasons not to pursue the topic lest he irreversibly messed things up for the both of them.
He watches the little purple crane flutter over his head, doing a few circles and then it’s gone, flying to the other side of their floor where the Forensics Department resides. Harry can almost hear Draco’s exasperated scoff among the stifling vapours of his potions—he likes to pretend to be extraordinarily busy every time Harry comes over and makes a big fuss out of ridding himself of all his protective gear while Harry smiles at his theatrics. Draco thinks he looks like a mysterious genius emerging from a cloud of fumes in all his mad glory, looking like he has just devised a plan to take over the world. But he actually looks like a goofy mad scientist with tousled hair, goggle imprints around his eyes and a flush across his cheeks, and no amount of tight-fitting, black robes, no matter how good and intimidating they look, will wipe the smirk off Harry’s face at the sight of it.
Wand. His wand is lost somewhere, so Harry focuses as hard as he can, feeling hot, desperate tears burning his cheeks and blurring his vision as he gently folds his palms over Draco’s ribs, just like he did all those weeks ago. He doesn’t touch him, doesn’t want to cause him any more pain, and Draco watches with a half-present expression as Harry keeps whispering the spell he had once sworn to never forget:
“Bloody hell—you fucking sex-crazed maniac,” Draco rambles, trying to get a better angle, “you’re going to get us both fired—
They don’t really revisit the topic when Malfoy comes back, just stay in the room until it’s lunchtime. Harry casts some subtle Glamours and a few Repelling Charms at the both of them and they go out to the little town centre for a supply run. Leaving the hotel for a while is like a breath of fresh air, Harry feels he can clear his head a little instead of staying cooped up with a brooding mobster and his own racing thoughts.
Harry’s stomach sinks; the two Aurors he summoned to take Malfoy to the holding cell. They’re new, he doesn’t even remember their names—at the time, he found it rather fitting that they resembled Crabbe and Goyle, flanking Malfoy from both sides, just like back in school. If there was something about them—something unsettling, something not right—Harry was once again blinded by his own annoyance, by his conviction that Malfoy was lying. His heart races as he listens.
“What?” Harry and Ron ask unison. This is bad. Ron should be allowed not to know these things. Harry, on the other hand…
It can’t be a social call—while not exactly discouraged, they aren’t very common in their line of work. It must be a simple checkup, their mystery co-worker must be looking for some missing reports, and damn Potter who puts his thirsty arse first and paperwork second.
Pansy makes a disgusted sound and Draco points his glass at her, the drink sloshing dangerously close to the edge. “Oh, don’t you give me that”—he mimics the sound with a grimace—“shite. You once made me listen to a, frankly
Harry is decidedly not comforted by the fact someone enjoyed a date he didn’t show up to—it feels like a bitter metaphor for the entirety of his dating life.
As if on cue, Harry’s phone vibrates sharply against the table. He swipes it in a blink and walks into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. He can hear some indignant yelps and a cascade of offended babble but as soon as the door closes, Harry unlocks the screen.
“Not very dignified for a man of class like you,” Harry says seriously, running his hand through Draco’s soft hair, now finally free of dried blood, feeling the scab of his wound scratchy under the pads of his fingers. He kisses the spot, just because he can, with some amount of naive hope he could kiss it better.
A slowly growing fire crawled down Draco’s back, taking the blood in his veins to a place that was already so hard to control in Potter’s presence. “See the footrests up there?” He pointed at the burnished golden bearings attached to both sides of the seat, strangely glad his hand didn’t waver. “Yes,” he murmured, watching Potter’s eyes darken. “And the ones below, near the base?” Draco asked in a low voice. Potter licked his lips, and then, Draco was sure he was thinking the same thing. “It is said the king could entertain himself with two ladies at the same time, however, I have seen configurations including up to six people—”
“Fine!” Malfoy closes the case with a metallic clasp and stuffs it back into his pocket. He whips his wand out again and taps it twice on the paper square. In a matter of seconds, it expands at the corners, revealing a simple, brown paper folder. Harry sees the odd folds and parchments inside and his curiosity is now officially piqued.
“Something’s wrong,” Harry says slowly, unable to shake off the feeling it has something to do with the suited men he saw—he doesn’t want to think whether any of this has anything to do with Malfoy.
Ron cranes his neck to look up at his fiancee, who takes in his flushed face and unfocused eyes and lets out a little laugh. “And how many did you have?”
knocks—three times, soft and polite, a perfect manifestation of his insanely proper upbringing. Hermione always does, too—hers is usually more frenzied and louder as she never visits Level Seven on social calls, only when it’s urgent or work-related. Ron sometimes forgets, usually when there’s food to be had at Harry’s desk, and always says sorry as soon as he sees Harry’s face. Ginny, after being berated for barging in, lets out a melodramatic sigh and makes a whole scene out of leaving, slamming the door and knocking so hard the glass almost shatters, reentering with a shit-eating grin at Harry’s flat ‘
?!” Draco whisper-shouts as if the Minister of Magic himself would jump out of the utility cupboard any second.
“What about me?” Harry snaps out of his reverie and looks around the circle. Ron is staring down the neck of his bottle but his ears are red, and even Draco looks decidedly less bored as he quietly sips his wine. “What?”
Harry laughs despite himself, a relieved, painless sound leaving his lungs like a breath of fresh air and he keeps kissing Draco, and carefully touching him all over as if making sure he’s not going to break.
Harry bites his tongue and continues. “It’s a standard safety measure. It’s not permanent, and it only works if I tune into it,” he explains. “It’s like a wiretap? You know, so I can hear you? But I can only use it in emergencies, if you disappear or something—”
If he’s honest, Harry absolutely loves doing this. He loves everything about it—a pliant body coming apart under his mouth, the heady scent of an eager lover, the feeling of opening someone up with just his tongue. He wants to see Draco wet and loose, wants to get him ready to the point he’s screaming for Harry’s cock; he’s not going to hurt Draco, he
“Is this, mmmhm,” Draco grabs him more firmly, and Harry groans, his legs instinctively spreading in invitation. “—going to be a problem?”
Harry starts talking. He tells Draco about the lunch and about Amy, and he doesn’t skip the lab bit, knowing Draco would like to hear about it. The story gets a little stilted when he gets to the hyacinths part.
Draco shrugged and, just as he was reaching out to take the fag, Potter’s cold fingers wrapped around his jaw and then, cool, soft lips encircled his own; Draco breathed the smoke in on instinct, straight out of Potters lungs. They stayed like that for a few more seconds, lips still touching, and Potter deepened it, inch by inch, until he carefully coaxed Draco’s mouth open, slid his tongue inside, and right then, Draco stopped thinking altogether.
There were also dangerous objects, ones imbued with old, dark magic—creepy figurines that made an individual cough blood when held with bare hands, armchairs one could never get out of, or an inconspicuous music box that, when open, played a melody that made them both extremely sleepy, and Harry managed to snap out of it and shut it closed at the last second. Every time they stumbled upon an object like that, Draco would have to go all day in a state of constant half-arousal, watching Potter being competent, and powerful, and focused. Draco had a hard time wondering where else that focus could be directed.
,” Harry groans into their kiss, and Draco murmurs soft encouragements, tells him how good he’s doing, how lovely he’s taking it, how gorgeous he looks impaled on his cock.
“He’ll be fine when he comes to,” says Harry, feeling his wound scream in pain. The hand he was casting with hurts too, not used to channelling so much magic. He manages to Summon his wand he must have dropped when he was injured and slightly wobbles, losing his balance.
“I know you don’t think highly of me but—” He licks his lips and lets out a nervous laugh. “It was low, even for me. So, my apologies,” he says almost off-handedly but Harry can see a barely-there twitch in his jaw, a long finger wiping condensation off his glass and, inexplicably, he believes it’s sincere.
He doesn’t need to be told twice—Harry pulls his trousers down with his underwear, groaning as it brushes against his cock on its way. Finally naked, he crawls over Draco, stroking his hand over Draco’s thigh and hip, up to his waist and takes his mouth in a bruising kiss. Draco pulls him closer by the hips until Harry falls on top of him and they both cry out in pleasure as their cocks rub against each other in the crook of their hips.
“Oh,” Malfoy chuckles, his perfect canines flashing in a knowing grin. He licks his lips, looking straight at Harry. “I’m quite certain I do.” Harry looks back, unblinking, and doesn’t falter although the obvious innuendo throws him off-balance just the slightest bit. He brushes the distraction off before Malfoy speaks again. “On top of that, I come bearing gifts,” he says, inclining his head, eyes wandering around the room for a few seconds for dramatic effect. His demeanour is somewhat extravagant compared to how he used to be—there’s a flamboyant, playful quality to the way he carries himself, but it doesn’t detract from the underlying seriousness of someone who could stab a man in a blink of an eye. He points his sentences with peppy gestures and moves his head and shoulders around a lot, in the charming, animated way of a notorious flirt. Not too much to distract Harry from what he’s saying, just enough to let him know that the darkness lingering behind his winsome mask can twist that smile upside down whenever he chooses. It slowly dawns on Harry that Draco Malfoy is a fancy dagger in a gem-encrusted sheath—nice to play with until there’s blood on one’s hands.
That seems to soothe his nerves a little as Malfoy stops in front of him, entirely too close, and his soft, sweet smell assaults Harry. He breathes in despite himself.
He presses his tongue inside Draco’s mouth and sinks down on his cock in one fluid move, making them both groan into the kiss.
Harry takes his shower cold but it does very little to wash out the flush suffocating him from the tips of his ears down to his neck and chest. The involuntary reaction to the intimacy of Draco tending to his injury is just proof that this forced proximity is starting to get to him. He might be reasonably attractive, but it’s still Draco Malfoy, who’s somehow become Draco along the way, and now, Harry’s standing under a cold spray of water, trying to will his painkiller-addled erection away. He drops his arms loosely by his sides—the injured one wrapped in a solid
Harry sighs, crumpling up the letter, and checks the clock over the door. He still has fifteen minutes to spare so he sends a quick note to Draco using an internal Ministry memo—they usually decide on lunch using those and Harry always folds his into a paper crane rather than an airplane. It’s a small nod to Draco, a little memento of their past and Harry finds it more amusing than he should, especially with the snarky messages they tend to exchange during work. Neither of them has ever mentioned it but Draco visits Harry’s office often enough to have seen him send hundreds of those and not one paper crane and knowing Draco, Harry’s sure he noticed.
“Yes sir,” Robards nods, turns on his heel and promptly leaves the office. Harry bats away the memory of Malfoy saying there’s a Family spy in the DMLE. He did mention it but it has gone without comment as his bosses looked over the evidence.
“He always talks like that when he’s drunk,” Harry responds automatically and shifts on the couch, poking his socked feet at Draco’s thigh. Draco lifts his leg without a word so Harry can tuck them under him, giving the prat a little kick while he’s at it.
“But it could still make something… happen,” Harry feels his blush is back. It was a stupid idea to begin with but he’s still curious.
“Oh my god,” Draco stated, immediately turning his head away. Harry snorted quietly and plopped down on the empty barstool next to his.
“You’re Harry Potter, I’m sure she’ll recognise you,” Ron reasons, but falls silent as soon as he meets Harry’s glare.
“I like looking at you,” Harry said in a low voice. He couldn’t help it so he licked his lips. “That shirt. That’s a good shirt.”
Harry starts with the angry-red Stinger marks, casting simple Healing spells over each of them and watching as the inflammation slowly subsides. They turn just a faint pink and without thinking, Harry applies some Dittany to every discolouration. He hears a soft gasp and realises he could have just given him the ointment, that he didn’t have to put it on Malfoy’s wounds himself but it feels right for an inexplicable reason so Harry doesn’t overthink it. After those are taken care of, Harry gets to the bruises that fade quickly with the help of the Murtlap and Nogtail balms. Malfoy is eerily quiet throughout the whole process, keeping his hands palms-up on his knees.
He casts some Freshening Spells he had learned from Molly to make his clothes feel a little less sweaty and grimy, and changes into an old AC/DC t-shirt he fishes out of the Mokeskin pouch, one of many he had found in Sirius’ room. After a second of deliberation, he gets another one for Malfoy to sleep in—it’s Blondie, and Harry snorts. While it would be interesting to see him try to relax in a dress shirt, Harry’s not a sadist, and maybe that little scrap of comfort will make all the difference in the amount of headache Malfoy would otherwise send Harry’s way. As he rummages around the Extendable Charm inside the pouch, Harry’s fingers brush against Malfoy’s wand. It can’t be his own—the cool, soft pull of magic is unmistakable and for a second, Harry wants to take it and cast—something, anything—to maybe feel like he did back then, to find something he has felt he’d lost for some time, somewhere after the Hogwarts Battle, to reclaim that feeling and stifle the ache he could never put his finger on.
Harry thinks about Daniel and the images of his happy childhood he got a glimpse of during the course of their conversation—it was full, with smooth, clean edges, dappled in sunlight and laughter—not a single crack in that flawless, picturesque vision of a young man with a dashing smile that he is now. He’s
There’s a pause and no sounds come for the other side of the room, not even the rustle of fabric as Malfoy stands, unmoving. “My world has a different definition of
Harry closes his eyes for a second, taking a steadying breath. He’s partly to blame for the utter recklessness of Draco throwing around retorts like that—he never tells him to stop, he’s not even sure he
Draco derangedly thinks what is about to go down in this little, unassuming bistro. They didn’t discuss how they were going to break the news and while Draco logically knows Harry wouldn’t change his mind, he finds himself fidgeting—it’s ridiculous, knowing that these people are their friends and he’s almost certain they would not have a problem with it. His heart skips a beat at the memory of Harry using the word ‘boyfriend’ last night—it’s apparently what they are now and Draco isn’t sure he wants to laugh, cry, scream or do all three. Harry told him he
It was a late afternoon and they were dozing off in bed, warm, naked, and dazed; Draco was splayed across Harry’s chest, his sure weight like a safety blanket, his long fingers loosely curled around Harry’s jaw. They’d just made love, possibly for the thousandth time since they first met, their skin dappled in sweat and vivid lovebites. Harry looked down at the beauty resting against his heart—Draco was staring at him through squinted eyes and pale eyelashes, with a soft smile stretching his pinkened lips. Harry’s own face must have mirrored that wondrously lovestruck look as he traced Draco’s cupid bow with the tip of his finger, brushing the soft curve and making Draco scrunch his nose with a laugh.
Exactly three days later, Draco opened the door to see Harry Potter, his assigned Curse-Breaker, looking roguishly bloody handsome and maybe a tiny bit nervous, standing on his doorstep.
“It was—aaah-acceptable,” Draco pants as Harry thrusts up, rubbing their clothed erections together.
seeing him cast, or watching his fingers hold it with a delicate, deadly force, like a feather falling onto a landmine, it’s a duty to his job and his own sanity he can’t quite bring himself to carry out.
Malfoy tilts his head. “For the record, it’s disappointing to immediately know you’re not asking about my incredible physique.
It’s the hottest thing he’s ever seen—Draco taking his cock like he’s hungry for it, gagging, and whimpering, and swallowing around it. Harry picks up the pace, his knuckles almost white with how hard he’s gripping the silver locks, and feels his orgasm getting closer, pleasure ripping through him in sizzling waves, mounting higher and faster, as he thrusts, and thrusts, and thrusts into Draco’s mouth.
Harry shrugs. “Some criminals can cast wandless and this way, only an Auror with the key can open it.”
Instead, Draco pushed him against the wall; his eyes were like thunderstorms, dark silver mingling into the black of his pupils, his hands fisted in Harry’s shirt and shaking with anger. It was a rare thing, to see Draco like that, especially after leaving the wizarding world—back then, Draco’s eyes were like a steel wall, cold, hard, and unyielding, always vigilant, waiting for the next blow to send him crashing to the ground. The further behind them those times were, the more Draco’s resolve seemed to soften—Harry’s heart threatened to burst with affection as he watched the love of his life slowly acclimatise to the relative safety of their new life. During the past year, Draco had stopped jumping at every sound of a car passing outside, he smiled more, even at strangers, he even hummed while making dinner again, the sweet sound had made Harry devour him against the table as soon as he had heard it for the first time in years.
“Right,” Draco said and took a deep breath. “Well. It’s a very… personal matter, as you can imagine,” he said and turned around to resume the pacing. “My wings are— They’re causing me problems.” He stopped, and looked at Harry with a serious expression. “And I… require assistance.”
“I… yes,” Malfoy says in a strange voice. “Thank you, I’m— Grateful. For what you did,” he says hastily and retreats to the bathroom without addressing any of the thoughts racing through Harry’s mind.
“You’re—mmmmhm—beautiful,” Harry murmurs, kissing and licking his way down, dipping his tongue into the dimples in Draco’s lower back. The only response he gets is incoherent moans. “Want to taste you,” Harry whispers, giving his arse cheek a playful bite.
The use of his first name for the first time since it all started throws Harry off—it rolls off Draco’s tongue in a manner so unfamiliar and, at the same time,
They’re fighting back to back now and Harry can feel the scorching heat radiating off Malfoy as his spells take a darker turn and, while not strictly illegal, they’re ones that require strong intent, to maim, to injure, to
, Draco,” Harry says urgently, dread filling his lungs at the thought Draco might get hurt when they’re so close to the finish line he can almost taste it. There’s also the matter of the fierce, protective fire sizzling deep in his belly, a crippling panic as he imagines anything happening to Draco—it can’t happen, not now, not when they’re—
Draco shifted, fingers fiddling with the hem of Harry’s t-shirt. “I’m,” he stuttered, and unfurled his wings.
“Well, you could try and talk to him,” Blaise says as he enters the room, Levitating a generously stacked charcuterie board and a new bottle of wine in front of him.
, rolling between slender, bony fingers as Malfoy waves it in the air before Harry can stop him. It’s the same one he’s always had, hawthorn, ten inches, the Dark Lords’ bane. The same one Harry returned shortly before the trials and hasn’t felt upon his palm for the last ten years. A ridiculous notion enters his mind, whether the wand would remember him, whether he would feel a cool, misty wash of Malfoy’s magic, just like the one he felt when he first held it. That sliver of its owner’s personality was a feeling Harry has unconsciously associated with Malfoy for all these years—like a moor at dawn, like old stone after a drizzle—temperate and ominous until it reveals the secrets it holds. It’s disconcerting, to remember it so vividly still, but Harry forgets all about it when Malfoy starts muttering incantations.
It’s not just a carnal want, to have Draco naked and sweating under him, it’s more than either of them is prepared to accept—Harry wants to swallow that bitter note in Draco’s mouth and turn it into honey, he wants to dissolve the knots in his muscles and absorb the mordant smoke filling his lungs. He takes a breath and slowly drags his teeth down the column of Draco’s throat.
If Draco’s referring to how touchable Harry thinks his hair looks right now, then yes, it’s as hilarious as genocide. He raises his eyebrows in question.
, an acknowledgement just for them. Draco doesn’t look up but there’s a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips before he hides it in his wine glass.
“I can’t— Shit. If nothing’s wrong and you’re caught with it, it will only hurt your case,” Harry explains, wondering why on earth he thought this would be easy, as if Draco has ever made anything easy—all things involving the two of them have always been nothing short of a tornado of circumstances, sucking them in with an unyielding force. “It will be fine. I’ll go back to the Atrium and take a look around, try to call Ron—”
For once grateful for his substantial knowledge of the Muggle world, Harry navigates the store easily enough, getting them not only some food and drinks, but also a few essentials like toothbrushes and towels, just in case they end up in some lower-standard places. He snorts at the image of Malfoy having to deal with things as simple as brushing his teeth or hanging up his clothes without magic and immediately berates himself for finding it amusing.
Harry has been calling Ron all morning, ever since he first read his text. His friend hasn’t answered any of his calls and Harry’s currently trying to rate all the dark scenarios in his head from ‘pretty bad’ to ‘everyone is dead’. He blames himself; for dropping his guard, for letting himself get distracted, and he wants to blame Draco a little, too, but knows he couldn’t do that without lying to himself.
Despite their history and initial antagonism, they turned out to work surprisingly well together. The mutual tension never dissipated or simmered down, just transformed over time into something private, loaded with things unspoken, and skyrocketing in strange moments, like during raids, or when they were alone in the office after hours, or in crowded bars after work. The dull ache needling at the inside of Harry’s chest anytime he looked at Draco for too long had become familiar in the way a person missed something they never had the chance to get.
At that, Harry pauses. “He’s—” He licks his lips, trying and failing not to think about Draco and Teddy.
Awestruck, Draco looked down, took the time to take him all in; pliant like honey, melting under his hands onto the seat, Harry Potter made the most gorgeous bottom. The allure lay in his extraordinarily competent and commanding demeanour, so harshly contrasting with how he was in bed, how this beautiful, malleable side came to life. And Harry was truly beautiful, inside and out, and Draco was sure there was something about his hands and lips, and smile, but his poor mind, now fogged with nearly numbing desire, was currently most partial to the greedy little hole he’d just sucked on, now all wet and pink, and his perfect, tight bollocks and flushed cock. Draco pressed forwards until he was lined up, sliding the head of his cock between Harry’s cheeks, up and down, and letting out a ragged breath with every stroke.
He takes a few deep breaths to pull himself together but feels like there’s nothing left to pull—all the emotions Harry’s been trying to keep inside are spilling out, thinned with alcohol and skewed judgement. Harry’s feeling braver than he has in months, alight with the kind of resolve that has accompanied him through death itself, and in his momentary beer-addled stupor, he realises he’s going to say or do something incredibly stupid, and maybe just as bold.
Their good morning kiss turns into a full-on snogging session full of soft laughs, warm lips and roaming hands. It doesn’t go any further than that, for now—the initial urgency has been sated, the overwhelming need to have each other
“Look,” Draco’s voice is full of wonder as whispers the single word into his ear and then Harry sees it. The ceiling mirror.
Draco, however, doesn’t move. He doesn’t even breathe, as far as Harry can hear, he just drills his steady, silver gaze into Harry and there’s a thunderstorm behind his irises, and a little twitch Harry can feel under his fingers but Draco doesn’t shake him off and Harry doesn’t let go. Not until Draco understands. “Yeah,” his voice comes out raspy. “Okay. I know you don’t.”
Malfoy doesn’t say anything and Harry feels a little bad for a moment, knowing very well Malfoy asked for this as much as Harry himself did.
Hermione at least sounds remorseful which isn’t much of a consolation. “Maybe it’s just a happy coincidence?”
someone before!” He hisses, a little impatient. Ron narrows his eyes at him and Harry groans. “Mate, we were in a bloody dorm together, I told you those things!” He gestures wildly to Ginny who’s currently in the middle of a heated debate with the girls on the other side of the room. “I dated your sister!”
, rings in his ears like a broken record. From up close he can see Daniel’s perfect hair that’s just a tad too dark, just a little too short to run his fingers through—it’s not the hair Harry dreams about tugging on, and waking up to seeing it spill onto the pillows. His blue eyes are like a clear, cerulean lake reflecting a cloudless sky, there are no gilded speckles, no thunderstorms rumbling behind them, they don’t glisten like quicksilver, sharp, alive, and oh, so beautiful. Everything about Daniel is soft; the angle of his jaw, the gentle arch of his cheekbones and the hand Harry feels brushing his face is too large, a little sturdy and—
“Wait, fuck, wait.” Harry bites his lip, imagining how badly it must hurt. The thing most Healers don’t tell you is that magically accelerated bone-mending hurts almost as much as breaking them. He can see a few droplets of sweat beading at Malfoy’s temples as he tries to play off the agony with long, calm breaths—what he’s forgetting, though, is that Harry had so many injuries in his life; he knows exactly how painful it is.
After a few minutes of silence, Draco speaks again. “And mister Porridge isn’t a bad person. I think he’d be…
One look at Kingsley—the stiffness in his posture, the twitch in his jaw, the impatience in his eyes—makes Harry’s blood run cold. This has to be about the Family.
They ended up in another wing, just to be safe, locking themselves in a small utility closet, and Draco still remembered the moment he first slid his cock inside Potter’s arse. He sometimes thought about the way Potter kissed him as if he was a starving man, the way he ripped Draco’s shirt open and swirled that sinful tongue around his nipples. He remembered every second. The hoarse moans Potter had let out on every thrust still rang in Draco’s ears on the odd night when he woke up with a start in a pool of his own come. The feel of that thick cock in Draco’s fist, and its wet slaps against Potter’s taut stomach as Draco pressed deeper inside of him. Once every few months, he had to walk through that same corridor and pass the door to that closet, and every time, Draco wondered how many times Potter himself wandered these halls, if he thought about them fucking at all, and if he ever wanted it to happen again.
Only once has Draco thought it could perhaps become something more, something beyond calculation and lists. He always hastily suppresses thoughts like this for a number of reasons but mainly because good things have never been a particular abundance in Draco’s life so he takes it for what it is and keeps taking until Potter stops giving.
in most  wed-bed-behead scenarios amongst Ministry workers and, in fact, if there was any bedding involved, Harry often made sure it happened once and never again. His fidelity or the will to commit wasn’t an issue as much as people liked to think but Harry was maybe too lazy or too unperturbed to correct anyone and since he was never an especially strong good things-magnet, he took things for what they were and never questioned a good shag. It wasn’t that Harry was a particularly rude person or an unenthusiastic lover, but having a famous last name oftentimes came with a peculiar set of drawbacks he was too tired to combat, and in the end, he always thought back to the time when a certain person he was cautiously starting to like asked him about his last will.
Harry checks if it’s at least plugged in and turned on, still managing to earn himself a begrudgingly impressed look from Draco. He secures the door and holds out his hand for the change he handed Draco earlier and finally manages to turn the bloody thing on.
“You look like someone pissed in your cereal,” Draco states more than asks and Harry jumps, too lost in thought to notice Draco staring.
that gazed at Draco so intensely, it wasn’t even Curse-Breaker Potter, for that matter. It was Harry, who asked Draco to call him that one day, wearing a shy smile, eyebrows knitted and hopeful, and Draco’s entire mind was occupied with them ever since. Harry always paused when he saw Draco in the mornings, evidently pondering over his chosen attire—Draco kept reminding himself he was still in the comfort of his own home, and it wasn’t like Margaret Thatcher was visiting—he usually went for fitted linen shirts, simple charcoal slacks, always barefoot. There was one instance of a very old, very loose garnet sweater he got from Luna Lovegood of all people—and cherished quite a great amount—even though it was already coming apart and showing off a significant portion of his collarbone. Potter seemed very preoccupied with that single patch of skin and Draco wasn’t going to play an oblivious, blushing stripling or pretend he didn’t see it. In fact, that hot gaze only wanted Draco to ask Potter to put his mouth there and start sucking.
“What I think— Well. I think goodness doesn’t come easy to you. Before, everything was a… transaction, wasn’t it? Someone scratches your back, you scratch theirs,” Harrys says, looking at him with a slight smile. “Like with the question game.”
Harry just knows Draco’s wearing a smug smile, even in pitch-black darkness. “So eager to know my secrets?”
“Are you very sore?” He murmurs against Harry’s hair, fingering him leisurely and slow. Not to go another round, neither of them would be capable of such a feat at the moment, it’s just strangely comforting and intimate, to have that empty, uncomfortable feeling squashed for just a while, to ease the transition. Harry mewls softly as Draco fingers his own come back inside him and it shouldn’t be so hot, or make him feel claimed but in that moment, it makes his breath hitch.
Harry opens his mouth but nothing comes out and Draco comes closer. The couch dips under him and Draco sits down, a little further away than usual, giving Harry space for some unfathomable reason, and it’s infuriating when he’s just understood that distance from Draco is the last thing he wants right now.
When they part for air, it’s with a loud, wet smack, their lips spit-slick and bruised, and Harry swipes his tongue under Draco’s upper lip just once, just to taste him again.
Harry’s brow rides up despite himself. It’s rather useless to point out that Aurors get taken off cases to which they have any personal ties—a pain in the arse of a rule but a necessary one nonetheless, especially with corruption piggybacking its way in, the Ministry its
The hotel is small and… unassuming, for lack of a better word. They walk across a morose-looking car park—the concrete is cracked and overrun with weeds sprouting through the gaps, extending and growing all over a pile of old rubber tires that’s displayed under the fence for no apparent reason. Harry chuckles under his breath, seeing that Malfoy wants to ask, and he almost prompts him to, but the blond decides against it and follows Harry inside.
The chair was, indeed, made to measure, however, Draco remembered the late king was a man of quite a bulkier posture than himself. He decided against standing in the metal placements, carefully stepping onto the cushioned base—he needed to be closer, to touch Harry, needed as much skin contact as physically possible.
“Archie is turning 129 next month!” Luna exclaims, all giddiness and smiles. “Isn't that sweet? And he's in such great shape! He swore his knee wouldn’t stop him from dancing at the wedding!”
The waitress is back and she walks over to the occupied table. “Everything all right there, Archie?”
“Er,” Harry starts, as a wave of panic hits him, making his cheeks burn. In the corner of his eye, he can see Ron perk up a little. Draco doesn’t move at all. “I… I never—” Honestly, should it matter? Harry takes a gulp of his beer. “It’s, um, hard to say—”
“Nice efficiency there, Auror Potter,” he drawls, his voice still a little hoarse. “One feels reassured, with their life protected by Wizarding London’s finest.”
Draco watches him for a few seconds, searching his face for some kind of indication and it seems that he gets it—he lifts himself up with catlike grace and pulls Harry up and off the couch, straight into his arms.
He groans. “It’s out of my jurisdiction, however, rest assured that if you fire it, I will stick it so far up your arse, you’ll be coughing gunpowder,” he says coldly. “And I
“I’ve been called worse,” Harry said, settling down with a grin. “Are you staring at McLaggen because you fingered him in sixth year and then he ghosted you?”
“Wait,” he whispered, and gently pulled Draco back by the wrist, flushing at his questioning glance. “We can— Here,” he said.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, regretting every decision in his life that had led to this moment. “The Floo address is twenty-seven Argyll Road,” he muttered.
Potter bit his lip, peering at Draco from under his shaggy, black hair. “I thought we could… hang out,” he said and huffed out a laugh that had no right to be so attractive. “And I’d get the chance to ogle
The thing about Draco is, he finds it difficult to ask for things he’s not sure are okay to take, to be given freely. He loves to be dramatic about it, almost martyr-like, stuck in a hopeless self-punishing cycle he’s still learning to break. Back before their friendship had cemented itself in the cracks and spaces that separated them for most of their lives, Draco had trouble believing and accepting anything remotely good if it bore the tiniest hallmark of selfishness, convinced his life should continue on the path of servitude, no matter if it were his father or some made-up sense of responsibility. Draco likes to say Harry has a Saviour Complex and revels in self-sacrifice but perhaps he just doesn’t see how similar they are in that department—the only difference being their house traits. It should be silly, to stick to some ‘made-up system of dividing people into groups based on randomly selected character traits’, as Hermione likes to say, and Harry
to be good, and not just for me, but for yourself. You’re so clever I sometimes can’t keep up with you, and you’re strong, Draco, sometimes I think you’re so much fucking stronger than I am,” he says, right against his temple, kissing over his hair, and Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s waist. “And me?” Harry laughs. “I’m stubborn, Draco I’m so fucking stubborn it’s insane. I spiral, and I don’t think before acting and I forget about people’s feelings. I just do whatever I think is right and—” He exhales. “And you. Well. You pull me back.”
Just as he’s at the door, Harry remembers something and quickly runs back to the bedroom—Draco’s still there, now with underwear on. Harry crosses the room in a few quick strides and before Draco can ask what on earth he’s still doing here, Harry kisses him one more time, deep and slow. “I love you.”
“Of for the— You know that’s not what I mean, you lackwit,” Draco glares at him with furrowed brows. “Your water is different than any I’ve ever tasted,” he says and examines the glass’ contents once again.
him to stop, and that fact is terrifying enough on its own. And, perhaps, the whole question game, Draco reading him like an open book, Daco knowing exactly where to push to get a reaction, lies deeper than either of them is willing to admit. It should stop, and neither is willing to make a move to do so, and it never fails to send a shiver down Harry’s spine.
He comes out, teeth clenched painfully, and Summons his wand from the nightstand. It’s peculiar how Malfoy never made a move to snatch it, to put his cunning to use and get what he needs through his usual shady methods.
. He wanted Draco to stop but also keep going, because if he had ever stopped, Harry’s ice-cold resolve would have shattered on the ground, like the last sword knocked out of his hand. It was all want, want,
“I can eat on my own!” Harry looks around their faces, slightly offended at being excluded from the conversation.
Draco shrugs, perfectly at ease. “It’s going to happen one day anyway, and I’d rather have Ginevra on my side, to be honest.”
, Potter,” he says quietly and Harry catches him absently running his hand over his ribs and lightly pressing his fingertips to the now faded marks. His face softens just a fraction and Harry quickly turns around.
Malfoy is quiet for a while but finally, he says: “You look like shit.” Harry gets the impression he doesn’t really mean it. “Let’s go then,” Draco murmurs and his magic sucks them into the vortex of Apparition.
Harry isn’t one to shun any scientific research or oppose progress in any way, but he can’t stop himself from despondently thinking it could have been any other plant and he would actually consider asking Amy out for another date. It’s difficult for a number of reasons—there’s no-one to blame for the situation, maybe except aunt Petunia and her reprehensible upbringing methods. Neville had no idea, Amy
Whatever Potter’s been doing while away, it has done wonders to his physique—he’s all broad shoulders and veiny forearms, trimmed waist, thick thighs, and that wretched pert arse of his. He looks every inch the superhero the wizarding world believes him to be, along with a beard and a mop of unruly hair that now somehow looks rakish rather than unkempt.
“Turn around, baby,” Draco murmurs, and Teddy lets out a little whine. Draco stabs his index and middle finger once, twice more inside the boy and Harry kneels on the edge of the bed, puts a calming hand at the small of his back. Gods, how he wants this. He comes closer and rubs his hand over that wet, hot place where Draco’s fingers disappear in Teddy’s hole and his cock drips precome at the sensation.
The usual programme was interrupted by a pale-looking reporter—his face looked sick even on the fuzzy, black and white screen. He was sitting in front of a desk, holding some papers in shaking hands. His eyes nervously skimmed left and right, presumably reading from a prompter.
Hermione hums knowingly. “For a man to be secure enough with his masculinity to express platonic affection through physical touch,” she explains. “It’s a very refreshing behaviour model these days—macho men are so last century, love” she shakes her head, earning herself approving nods from everybody except Ron.
She gasps in mock-scandal. “I so am the public! Just you wait until we unionise and take over this shithole you call a government.”
It doesn’t take long for Draco to start laughing too, the low, belly-deep rumble reverberating in the small room, crinkling the corners of his eyes and giving him an adorable, dopey look he would deny wearing under the threat of death. When they both calm down, Draco picks up the crumpled paper and unfolds it.
“Off, off,” Harry whispered, fumbling with Draco’s flies, feeling him arch under his touch. “Turn around, fuck, please. Let me, Draco, say yes, say yes—”
. Harry feels a little overwhelmed to have it laid out for him and be so, so simple. It doesn’t feel simple, it’s not, it’s more than just that, and calling all those complicated emotions between him and Draco
“Sir, is… everything okay?” Harry asks slowly. His right hand tingles slightly as that bad feeling spreads from his core and Harry clenches the muscles in his thigh to make sure his wand is still in his holster. “You look—”
Harry watches Draco intently, thinking about his one encounter with the potion. It didn’t seem as bad as Draco made it out to be. “All right. So what did you manage to learn?”
He bends down to pull Harry’s lip between his teeth. “I thought we were on the same page here,” he murmurs.
A bored, young receptionist eyes them both with unabashed interest and Harry’s painfully reminded that while he’s wearing his Transfigured uniform and a pair of dark trousers, Malfoy’s apparel consists of all things that scream
“Are you going to say something or would you prefer a show? I’m quite adept at those,” Malfoy breaks the silence easily, with a patented, impish smile but lets it go at Harry’s impatient glare. “Right,” he says, palming absently at his chest. Harry watches as he pulls a slim, silver cigarette case out of his inner pocket. It looks like an heirloom, judging by the tarnish around the intricate floral designs in the corners, each adorned with gleaming onyx. It’s a beautiful trinket and however strange it may sound, smoking fits Malfoy—a cherry on top of the whole infuriating, decadent, audacious whirlwind of oddities that is the man before Harry. He opens the case and pulls out a tiny paper square and, after a second of deliberation, looks at the neatly lined cigarettes inside. “Do you mind?” Malfoy asks.
“Well, he’s almost nine so I’m assuming breastfeeding is not needed anymore!” He pauses at Harry’s amused look. “I would… Order something?” He waves his hands chaotically as if the air between them carried all the answers he needed, perhaps with a little help from Teddy himself, who’s unfortunately absent to settle the debate.
It all feels slightly criminal and maybe that’s why they keep doing this dance, where instead of opening doors, they pick locks; instead of admitting what they need, they allow the other to steal it and keep it close to their chests. That’s why they keep touching themselves but never each other, and talk about philosophy but not what they truly want.
—Harry!—” Draco’s words come out very fast as he struggles to breathe and talk. “You’ll hurt yourself—ahhh,
“We’ll get to the bottom of it,” he says. “If there’s an informant, they’ll eventually slip, or we’ll find out ourselves.”
Draco shakes his head. “I’m not one to tell others what they need, least of all you. We both know you’d do the exact opposite, given your track record of doing what you’re told.”
“No,” Harry whispers, slowly adjusting to it, clenching experimentally and earning himself a broken whimper from Draco.
“I think it’s very manly to be in touch with your emotions,” Luna pipes in with a sweet smile. The girls are sitting on the floor, Luna’s back to Ginny’s chest, with her girlfriend’s arms locked around her waist.
They move on after that, skillfully steering the conversation to safer topics; they discuss the weather like any proper Englishman ought to, concluding that it’s shite; they talk in hushed voices about Quidditch, and Hogwarts, and a great number of unimportant, safe things. The pleasant buzz of alcohol is back and running along Harry’s veins and he discovers, with no small amount of mild outrage, that Draco Malfoy, once his cagey vigilance is sedated with enough alcohol, and his edges are dulled with a few soft glances, is actually quite decent company. Empty glasses seem to multiply on the table in a timelapse and for the first time this evening, or this month, for that matter, Harry can truthfully say he feels relaxed.
was looking for, or perhaps what he’d been looking at for months and was only coming to terms with this particular drug of choice. “Apart from your flawless body and cutting sense of humour?” He smiled softly, looking down at his glass, hating the strange vulnerability in his voice.
“Every magical child wanted to meet you as soon as they were old enough to understand who you are,” Draco says coldly and Harry realises that the slight tremble in his voice has nothing to do with any sort of sadness or empathy. It’s fury, ice-cold and cutting, seeping through Draco’s teeth like poison. “Every family would have gone
Harry feels a wave of heartfelt gratitude towards Draco. It’s one of the little things Harry discovered about him and never told another soul. It started with small, nearly imperceptible gestures and by the time Harry had a name for them, Draco fell into a habit of bringing him coffee when he spent too long cooped up in his office over case paperwork. Sometimes, there would also be a carton box with a piece of treacle tart inside, despite Draco always emphasising how much he hates the stuff. He would come uninvited through the Floo and just
“Well,” Draco breathes, still trying to chase Harry’s mouth. “This welcome, however exciting and quite diverse, is also remarkably confusing—”
He’s panting into Draco’s mouth, sweat clinging to his chest and temples, hair falling into his eyes and Draco watches, completely drunk with lust, realising he’s been doomed for longer than he even knew.
with another man for that matter, but the sliver of nervousness that he’s been feeling in the back of his mind dissipates as soon as Draco is on him again. He latches his mouth onto Harry’s neck, sucking and licking his way up, and Harry bucks under him when Draco catches his earlobe between his teeth. He nibs at the sensitive skin, laving the spot with his tongue, and it goes straight to Harry’s cock—he lets out a low moan and paws at Draco’s arse, digging his fingertips into the firm flesh. They settle on a slow, delicious rhythm and it’s so insanely good, Harry thinks he might come in his pants like the virgin he is if Draco doesn’t stop the relentless, devastating drag of his hips.
“Mine,” Draco growled in his ear, his movements growing more desperate, irregular, and he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s cock to bring him over the edge. “
Draco finishes the question for him. “Why did I come out so late?” He flashes Harry a smile, his perfect, white canines glinting in the dim light. “You see, I didn’t think all the Death Eaters in my family or Voldemort couchsurfing in my house would care much for hearing about my journey to self-realisation,” he says with an amused snort.
“What? Ah, I suppose,” he says distractedly, a rueful smile creeping up on his face. “Seeing Dmitri again reminded me— It’s an old Russian folk song,” he says sifting through the odds and ends in the kit, discarding a pack of plasters but setting aside a few rolls of bandages.
This is it. It’s happening, he thinks, and there’s excitement stirring in his stomach as he slowly rocks against Draco feeling his blood rush and his cock fill. He’s not sure how it’s going to happen yet but that doesn’t stop the sparks of electricity going down his spine, doesn’t make his shallow thrusts any less eager—he needs more, he wants to make it count, he—
Draco looks. There’s saliva and precome dripping down his chin, glistening all over his kiss-bitten lips, tears drying at the corners of his eyes, and he’s panting, watching Harry with black-blown pupils.
It’s done anyway, it’s not like Harry can find a Time-Turner and go back a few hours, preferably to get hit by a car so he wouldn’t have to come here and… Now he sees what Hermione meant with the
Harry takes Freddie, who’s already looking a little droopy, his eyes closing more and more, and the three of them step inside the bedroom. Harry carefully puts the baby in the crib and strokes his tiny, adorable little face until he settles. It doesn’t take long before he’s fast asleep and they leave him there, setting an Alarm Charm in case he wakes up. They talk quietly and Draco once again proves to be that soft, calming presence that makes everything a little bit more bearable—although he would probably scoff at the fact that being able to keep his voice down is an achievement in Harry’s eyes.
Encouraged with the milder reaction, Harry palms at Malfoy’s side more firmly, feeling the fine bone under the pads of his fingers, and focuses on the magic flowing from his core and slowly spreading, banishing the pain and filling in the cracks of the fracture. He risks a glance up and Malfoy’s hand goes a little higher, fingers now digging into the soft place where Harry’s neck meets his shoulder, Malfoy’s thumb grazing his Adam's apple. As soon as their eyes meet, Harry feels a renewed surge of power seep through his fingers, a red glow illuminating the pale skin under his hand, so bright he can
during all those weeks. The first time they really talked, the first time Harry realised Draco was beautiful, their first kiss and— “The— When we left the Ministry. On that hotel roof.”
Draco turns to leave and for a second, Harry doesn’t move. Suddenly, his body shifts on its own and he grabs Draco’s wrist. It’s warm, and smooth, and so slender, Harry can feel his pulse quicken under the paper-thin, alabaster skin. “Draco,” he gulps. “I don’t think you’re evil.”
fairy godmother comes to her in a dream and teaches her a recipe for a potion that will cure her beloved,” Draco rolls his eyes at Harry’s stifled laugh. “It’s not a good book, Potter, I told you.”
“It’s not Draco! Okay?” Harry raises his hands, stopping that particular train of thought, face already burning. Harry wonders when or how his assistant started giving him dating pep talks and thinking it’s for Draco, of all people—
The room was bathed in a dim, coral glow as the sky turned orange—it was nothing like a sunset, more an infernal chasm slowly advancing on their fragile, crystalline bubble. Time was rapidly slipping away, the last grains in an hourglass that didn’t have enough sand to begin with. Harry kissed Draco again as the song slowly came to an end, and he thought how beautiful Draco was, how put-together he seemed while Harry’s whole body was falling apart at the seams. Being helpless was not something he was particularly good at, Harry thought, as he crushed Draco against his chest, the gold ring ice-cold around his finger.
Malfoy notices he’s still clutching Harry’s clavicle and hastily lets go of him, scrambling to find his discarded shirt. “You seem… disturbed.”
the necessity of bedrest in cases such as his,” she says, pointedly not looking at Draco. “I’ll leave you two alone.”
? Harry wants to ask, but thinks better of it, grateful for the velvety darkness around them obscuring the burning flush across his cheeks. He refuses to think too much about that particular line of work, or what Malfoy must have been up to during those allegedly boring banquets of his.
“Of course, the Saviour and his unmatched power,” Robards rasps, moving away from the fountain. Harry can see through his technique so easily he wants to laugh—he stands against the man who had taught him everything he knew and while an old dog can still learn new tricks, Harry also has a few aces up his sleeve.
Draco huffs. “Please. We both know you’re fantastic with children and we’ve pretty much established my idea of something as simple as infant nutrition is vague at best.”
“That’s right, darling,” Harry says, bending forward and over his back, kissing the knobs of his spine and slowly working his finger alongside Draco’s cock. “We’re gonna go slow, okay? Just like this.”
He expects Draco to maybe make a joke about Harry’s cock-potential going to waste or something of the sort, but Draco kisses him, deep and filthy, bumping their hands together, his fingers ghosting over Harry’s. Harry finally gets the hint—he casts the usual set of sex spells and Summons some lube that’s now dripping all over their tangled fingers and spreads his legs shamelessly, taking advantage of the lube and stroking his cock with a quiet hiss. Draco watches him, licking his lips, and grabs Harry’s wrist to make him stop.
“Of course.” he said, wondering, not for the first time, what exactly was going on with his parents.
It hadn’t been his idea. He had just been trying to keep his head down and get on with his studies for the first few months of school. And he’d been doing a fairly good job of it as well in his opinion. But then one day Blaise heard that Weasley was on the Gryffindor team. So he wrote a song. Pansy had actually cried with laughter the first time she had heard it. The song was hilarious, he had to admit it. Though he knew the second Potter heard the song he would blame him. Because everyone thought that he was the one who came up with all the terrible schemes the Slytherins pulled half the time. It was getting rather annoying.
“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right. It’s Christmas after all! Poor lad probably needs a break anyway!” Slughorn grinned and raised his glass. Flich shoved him away, grumbled something under his breath, and left the room. Draco rubbed a hand to the back of his neck, and looked cautiously around the room. Could he make a break for it?
“Draco! Merlin, I thought you were still stuck there!” Ginny’s voice sounded far away to his ears. He felt as if he was watching the scene unfold from above. He could see himself, arms wrapped snugly around his knees, breathing harshly.
“Oh, yeah everything’s fine don’t worry. I just wanted to ask you something.” Harry gave him a shy smile and stepped forward to give his hand a reassuring squeeze.
“Yeah well, he’s also the reason I was there in the first place.” Harry replied darkly, curling his hands into fists. Draco couldn’t breathe. He was right after all.
Harry opened then closed his mouth. Draco clamped his lips together to keep them from trembling. He felt naked. Those were only meant for him. Those letters were his most secret possessions, he had never meant for anyone to see them. All of a sudden anger bubbled inside of him and he was finally able to speak.
“There’s another one like this, do you know how to fix it?” He asked, turning to face Borgin. He didn’t look very happy.
“Why don’t you go to the hospital wing then?” Theo suggested. Luna was shaking her head next to him. How did she know so much? She probably knew things he didn’t know himself.
“They’re going to be here any second.” He said thickly, doing his best to ignore the tightening and swirling of his stomach.
In February Draco took Harry to a lake, only to be attacked by some snatchers mere minutes after they had gotten there. The lot of them spent longer than Draco wished to admit thinking. They spent hours with books spread across the floor, pouring them. Draco soon discovered that Harry couldn’t focus for longer than 15 minutes. Which frustrated Hermione to no end but Draco found rather endearing.
“I don’t know…” He didn’t want Potter to hate him more than he already did. Surely the song could only make things between them worse. But honestly how could things between them get any worse?
“Tell me the truth! I’m going insane over here trying to figure this all out and I can’t, and I want to help you but I can’t if I don’t even know what’s going on!”
“Doesn’t matter.” Draco heard him murmur softly. “You best be on your way then boy, be safe. Crazy world we live in now.” He gave Draco a firm look before giving the Leaky Cauldron a sweep with his eyes, as if to make sure no one was listening in on them.
And Luna wasn’t even around to talk to him. He could send letters but that wasn’t nearly the same thing.
“Er-no. I’ve been kind of distracted lately is all.” By lately he meant his entire schooling but he would never tell Severus that.
Okay perhaps he was being a tad dramatic. Harry was still his boyfriend after all, and being near him made Draco so bubbly he didn’t know how to contain himself. However hiding things from one’s significant other was never an easy task. Draco simply did not want to hide things from Harry. He wished he could share every single detail of his life with him, and he wished Harry to do the same. But he was a death eater. Who would probably be dead quite soon.
“This has been the most boring ride ever and the train hasn’t even started moving.” She glared at Granger and Weasley, and he had a feeling there was more to it than that. No one said anything for the majority of the ride, only to decide which pair would go next to patrol the corridors. After a very long two hours the head boy and girl came in to tell them that they could go find their friends now. Immediately Granger and Weasley practically sprinted out of the car. Draco and Pansy raised their eyebrows at each other. That was odd. Odder than usual anyway. They wandered out of the car and looked around for the rest of their friends. They found the car with Theo and Blaise, but Luna was nowhere in sight.
Draco can’t remember, suddenly. The man was wearing a tan trench coat, which had been oddly fashionable.  “A muggle.”
Since he’d arrived, Draco has been running on the assumption that he was imprisoned in the Azkaban of nightmares in the North Sea. It turns out, New Azkaban is across the strait in actual England. It’s welcome news -- England is beholden to international law -- but Draco and his legal team will have to find a way to cross the water.
She’s outside on the balcony, which can be seen from the street. As soon as he pops into the alleyway her eyes settle on his. She gestures simply for him to walk upstairs.
Potter puts both of his hands into his hair like he’s standing in one of those muggle plane metal detectors. His face gets bright red – a feat for somebody so dark – and he turns to the wall behind him.
This older Draco looks nearly identical to a young Lucius but with slightly different bone structure around the jawline. He has a huge bonding bite on his neck.
“Good. There’s a lot of paperwork involved with that now.” He buttons the jacket on his cloak. “They used to just throw you to the dementors if you wanted! Now you need to jump through hoops.”
Astrid looks up slowly, for shock value. Draco is only a little bit appalled by her black eyes. They are a signature in the Yaxley family, and they are as upsetting as the legend. He doesn’t flinch at her disgusting gaze, as he’d be much more alarmed if she’d had her mother’s face.
His face softens around the edges, like Draco has said something impossibly sweet. He raises his hands, altogether more enticing because of the imagined height difference, and he runs the palms over Draco’s cheeks. It feels like coming home.
The lawyer looks confused, “how could you drop the suitcase with a muggle in Moscow when you murdered Antonin Dolohov in London on the same day?”
It is not surprising that the Dolohov family has a bit of a better lawyer. He looks like a bulldog come to life. This man reveals that Draco had been peddling muggle drugs from England to the continent for the past five years, working for Dolohov. Narcissa gives him a signature raised-eyebrow look at this information.
She was detruit. How could that possibly be up for debate? Celeste has been the only person whom Draco has seen crack open brick and concrete because of her pain. Right before his sixth year, when she had died in the Manor, there were fissures all in the wood in her floors. It was like she was trying to sink through to the dungeon.
in history who has been wiped clean of his magic. Normally, the universe just lets nature run its course. Now, Draco will live on indefinitely.
Finally, the pictures of Dolohov’s blown out head make Draco sink further into depression. Nobody wants an omega who can stomach shooting an alpha through the head and trying to find the bullet to hide the evidence.
He pulls away and Draco’s eyes snap open, not bothering to hide how upset he is. He knows that this isn’t real.
They both stare at each other in an imaginary field. Now that Draco has his bearings, he studies himself more closely. This version of Draco doesn’t look as much like Lucius as he did at first sight. His hair is just as long, but it’s slightly wavy and falls in thick curtains down to the middle of his back. There are laugh lines all over his face: in the corners of his eyes. On his forehead.
It is unsightly. It had happened yesterday morning. To be frank, Draco doesn’t really remember the incident at all because – as Barnaby has so lovingly pointed out the previous week – his mind is being fried by his own excess magic. He has been told by staff that another inmate had tried to steal his books, so Draco punched him in the face and received a charming cut from an old screwdriver in return.
“—Then you know the risks.” Granger says it very seriously, like she’s telling him a secret. “You know what kind of magical energy is required.”
Astrid is looking at him like he is the dumbest person in the world, and perhaps he is. “He’s not in withdrawal! He’s just all sad and mopey because he saw her and now: she’s gone.”
The worst part is seeing Dolohov’s wife crying into somebody’s chest. No - the worst part is that Draco doesn’t feel sorry for killing her husband, but bitterly jealous. Somebody like
“Draco.” This is the second time she’s used his first-name in the proceedings. It’s odd. “Harry is very powerful but not powerful enough to make a cell explode but with nobody hurt or maimed on the premises. It’s a health condition on
“Not quite,” somebody says, leaning against the door. Draco jumps nearly through the ceiling at Lucius.
. Dutifully, Draco holds out his hands and waits for them to click in place. Barnaby struggles with the clasp, and Narcissa shoots him a look as if Draco’s handcuffs are the height of inconvenience.
Another day, another trial. This time, the location is the makeshift chamber the Dark Lord used to free the dementors. It sounds more dramatic than it feels.  Draco is sitting in a lawn chair that has moss growing on it.
Harry is obviously drunk. He is heavily favoring one side and his face looks murderous, like the stupid robe has truly upset him.
When he flops across his cot and turns his back to Draco, something inside himself snaps. Things move so quickly. It’s like Draco is watching from outside of his body. Draco stands, waltzes over to Potter like he’s sleepwalking, and pushes his shoulder back to face him.
Astrid screams at the top of her lungs for about half an hour, even when the guard comes to give them lunch. When Draco looks down at his tray, he sees that they’ve given him a knife, which they only do at dinner.
“Hey,” Potter reaches out and cups his cheek in his hand. He traces the side of his cheek, right where that stupid cut from muggle prison should be. For some reason, Draco isn’t surprised to feel that it isn’t there. “Focus. Don’t go there.”
Barnaby’s genius plan to reduce Draco’s sentence is to bring in a doctor who tells the entire courtroom how Draco’s symptoms can only be caused by the lack of a single person in his life who cares for him. His rage, physical strength, and magic are still perfectly intact while his mind goes. This is the opposite of alphas, who maintain their minds but cannot maintain their magic.
Celeste Yaxley had told Draco that right before she slit her wrists with her letter opener, which Draco had informed Pansy when he’d left for this place. And she’d... agreed to bond Blaise Zabini.
Lucius must see the blood start to drain from his face. “They were trying to help me. They wanted me to show them how to access… another world.”
Parkinson’s pregnant now so we’ll never be able to get you to stop touching her and keep your magic—”
Typically, just when Draco expects to be the center of attention, nobody pays him any mind. Even though they’re not looking at him, Draco would recognize Blaise Zabini’s coffee colored skin anywhere. But it’s not him Draco is anxious about. The two girls that are playing some kind of game with dirt on the floor are much more nerve-wracking. Their mother died in his house a year before the war really started. Draco hasn’t spoken to Astrid nor Maleka Yaxley since.
Does he smile at this? Is he supposed to laugh? “We attended the same school, didn’t we? We all discussed the Olympian spirits, right? Which one did you get on the quiz?”
That’s that on that.  Granger decides that Draco will return to his omegas wing as long as he is “no longer a threat” and continues to “monitor his own magic.” Another year will be added to his sentence. Granger spends the last fifteen minutes discussing the new plans for the prison and a sponsorship deal with Sleakezy’s hair potions where Draco can pursue manual labor for free, another incredible way to throw his magic into the universe and never get it back.
“Lovegood, can you hand me that blanket?” Granger makes a face. Not Lovegood. Another lackey. Another girl with big hair. Not Looney.
Barnaby is mentioning the colloquial term for being destroyed by his own magic when there is no alpha for Draco to bond with. As an omega, he cannot use most of the magic building inside him, so it attacks his brain and his motor functions as his magic grows stronger. Three more years of this, by Draco’s estimate, and he’ll destroy half of the B-block where he’s currently being housed.
“Did you have a girlfriend or something?” Draco asks one morning, while he’s trying to wash his face in the stupid little basin. Granger’s fancy prisons have these little bathrooms attached to the side, but she’s managed to overlook that Draco would trade the bathroom at Malfoy Manor for one second without Blaise and the Yaxley sisters.
Once, Draco witnessed a couple on the street near Diagon Alley. This was before the war, so it had to be over fifteen years ago. As they were walking, an acquaintance stopped them and gave the omega a hug, followed by the placement of their hands on the omega’s cheeks. This is the most common initiation for the passing of magic. It happened so easily, so casually, that Draco had always assumed that would happen to him one day.
Draco is starting to get impatient. “Yes, Father, I know, the everlasting omega power, I’ve heard this before.”
It’s too much. It’s already too much but when Potter’s hands come to cross across Draco’s torso, he twists like a feral cat to break free. The garden goes black, like he’s crossed from summer into the dead of winter.
As the month trudges on in Azkaban, the mental effects of solitary confinement have become more drastic. Nobody has ever been
It feels like decades before he can gather himself, wipe his eyes to notice that he’s positioned in an all-white room, crouched over his own knees, holding himself in a squatted fetal position. He’s soaking wet.
"Draco, please,” Dream Harry begs. He gets down on his knees before Draco, takes his hands. It’s incredibly overwhelming, even though it isn’t real. Draco is doubled over and tries to pull his hands away to steady himself, but Harry objects. “Draco. Listen.”
That’s not surprising. Draco’s hormones are soaking the cell so much that he can feel it himself. If Potter said one spell it would be magnified by a thousand, a dangerous issue for Draco, but he can't stop it. Knowing that Potter is in trouble for something – that’s sweeter than candy. It makes his head spin.
Pansy stares at him, long and hard. “I guess it’s good then that everything in this industry is about what you like.”
The door slams shut so loud that the sound reverberates in the cell. For a second, Draco just stands there, clutching the scratchy linen that Granger assured him was a step up from regular Azkaban. It’s a four-person room with barely enough space to breathe, but his cellmates do seem to be immersed in something.
The sound reverberates through the cell, and Astrid looks at him with anticipation. Draco’s magic activates the runes circle, just as Astrid Yaxley so wanted, but Draco has no plans to break out of this prison. He quickly changes the magic permeating throughout the entire cell to freezing, foul black water. It rises quickly in a smaller room, much quicker than it ever did in Celeste’s suite in Malfoy Manor.
Past Harry wobbles alarmingly where he stands. Draco, his eyes rabbit quick from snorting the cocaine he was meant to drop off, doesn’t make a move to catch him. Suddenly, Draco’s memory returns full force.
Draco feels adrenaline thrashing in every bone of his body. In a moment where Draco should wake up spluttering and shaking, he emerges feeling victorious. He is still alive.
Despite how scintillating pushing dirt around the floor and staring at a blank wall is, Draco does expect one of these people to look up and say something to him.
His omega would know that Draco wasn’t truly being cherished as he desperately desires, but the bite would help him. It would, very possibly, stop him from permanent impotence and the explosion of his omega magic. Draco is desperate.
Harry is smiling. “I forgot you like this.” He shrugs. “You used to be so defensive about everything.” Draco rolls his shoulders back, ready to throw out an insult of his own, but Harry holds his hand. “I want you here. But not yet.”
He looks resigned, but also weirdly like he loves to humor Draco. Like he knew this might happen. He stands and for a moment they just look at each other.
What story. Draco tries to wrack his brain for what’s even happening. He asked Potter questions about why he was here. He filled the room with magic, which theoretically should make Potter want to spill his guts. He was sitting on the bed crisscross applesauce.
Draco goes to Azkaban in the next week because he was already planning on it. His mother and himself are allowed three visits with Lucius every six months. As always, Lucius looks wan and sick upon arrival and his mother withholds every type of affection, even though they are perfectly allowed to touch. After a short discussion about Draco’s latest career accomplishments (notably, murdering an alpha drug dealer with a muggle gun), his mother strides out of the cell and leaves Draco to his own devices. The strangest part is, still, that she doesn’t touch either of them. The guards always look alarmed, which spawns an awkward moment where Lucius and Draco stare at each other. Draco knows that it is the bone-crushing loneliness he doesn’t usually see surface.
The part of this interaction that kills Draco the most, even to this day, is what happened afterwards. The man grabbed that omega woman by the waist after she had said goodbye to the stranger on the street and, laughing at the abruptness, she leaned in to kiss him right in the center of London. He whispered something to her, and they walked off, never having stopped touching the whole time.
There’s no way to really react to the news, especially because he expected this exact outcome. But Draco does look at the pictures of Dolohov’s face and feels quite sick. He barely remembers the incident, but he does recall digging in his forehead for the bullet. It had been a moment of pure self-preservation. He didn’t expect him to go down so easily, especially after working with him and his cronies for five years.
Draco has always been taught – in school because dynamic wasn’t something his family ever discussed – that omegas were special. The world’s magic has to be born from somewhere. It has to be generated by the connections between people and can be amplified by close relationships. Omegas are natural catalysts for power by carrying love and devotion in spades. An omega can intensify a mediocre wizard into the next phase of his capability. The old stories say that Merlin himself was a relatively weak wizard who relied on his children, all omegas, to amplify his power. A powerful alpha cannot sustain his own magic, they need something to fan it.
“Am I correct when I say that you had known Antonin Dolohov before your employment in his drug cartel?”
“Anybody could do that,” Harry says, cocking his head to one side. “Isn’t a fantasy supposed to be something extraordinary?”
had an omega wife that cared this much for his stupid, ugly ass. Draco doesn’t recognize this woman at all, so she couldn’t have been around during the war. A part of Draco that is entirely omega is screaming – why did that bastard choose her?
Draco quickly recovers from the heart palpitation this news gives him, and grins. “Not only a cold-blooded murderer but an extremely powerful one!” He puts his hands across his forehead to appear as if he’s swooning.
She holds up her hand in a gesture to stop him talking. For some reason, he does. “Harry has reported that your power is stifling.”
says what he’s thinking. “Do you feel better with an alpha?” There is a long pause where Draco tries to convey with heavy eye contact what the elephant in the room is.
It forces omega magic out through the skin, in basically whatever form that takes. For Draco, it’s a fucking ocean of freezing water bubbling in the air above him and crashing onto Draco’s face like a tidal wave.
In a moment of extreme embarrassment, so much so that he can see his mother flinch in the corner of his eye, Draco lets out a long omegan whine that is meant – biologically – to show extreme distress. In theory, everybody in the area should desire to rush to his rescue. It is a sign of true submission.
He’s in a huge open kitchen with a large wooden island in the middle, something Muggle that Draco has only ever seen on the continent. There is a weird appliance in the corner that Draco runs his fingers over, jumping a little at the loud beeping noises that it makes.
though, a small voice in Draco's head reminds him. Lucius is not permanently, clinically insane from withdrawal.
It turns out that Draco has been prescribed the blood let (read: the magic flush) so that he can go to court. Unlike what Draco had thought, it was not a recommendation of a faceless doctor. It was the recommendation of Narcissa, although a welcome suggestion to the Azkaban staff.
Draco hates to speak in code. “He told me to tell Harry Potter – who won’t be here, I’ve read the witness list – that I can travel to other dimensions.”
In all his life, Draco has never associated his omega with an animal. It’s not something he’s proud of, to be certain, but the omega traits have always been a part of him. Not something separate. Not an animal.
Blaise’s lawyer, whom Draco recognizes as the Parkinson representative, jumps on Barnaby with even more force than Dolohov’s had. Draco was housed in a low security ward with omegas instead of alphas, who would be raping him or worse. Draco was allowed to leave to go to required meetings with his officer – Granger – at any time. Draco had no reason to attempt to murder Blaise Zabini in cold blood, self-inflicted trauma or not.
For a split second, Lucius does look somewhat sympathetic. He quickly schools his features. “Ask Barnaby if you can visit me when you come to Azkaban for good.”
Draco can’t focus when he’s confused. He’s shaking like a leaf against Potter’s chest, which makes the hold incredibly awkward. Draco cringes a little when Potter presses his nose against the juncture of Draco’s jaw and inhales deeply. It’s so contradictory to the night in the holding cell, that Draco feels like he’s having a panic attack.
Draco could. This room is small enough that he’d be able to use that same idea to fill the whole thing with freezing water. When they’d discovered Celeste, she’d had the water up to the bed skirt. Draco knows – he
It is possible that Lucius is demented. While it is harrowing to finally see his father lose it, it is also a comfort to know he is not the only detruit in these walls–
, he is a criminal and a murderer and he has been since he was sixteen. But the Boy who Lived is not, as far as Draco knows, a criminal nor a murderer.
Draco listens to her prattle on about how he’ll be staying with omegas, how he can expect a psychiatrist, how he’ll have a “job” to do every day. Only one part of this is interesting.
Maleka is nodding next to her. “I miss my mother and father.” She sighs, somehow still unsettling, staring into space. “It’s so important to keep my magic, but there’s no reason for an omega not to visit.” Celeste Yaxley has been dead for seven years, so Draco is starting to seriously wonder about Maleka’s sanity when she says: “of course, that’s rarely possible from the grave.”
In school, they teach all alphas this embrace. It’s supposed to be casual, appropriate for any person and not just one’s mate. It is to be used in stressful situations when an omega’s magic is going out of control, but it is used often. It’s a well-known embrace that Draco recognizes immediately.
This kind of behavior – going blatantly against his client’s wishes – may be acceptable if Draco's sentence were to be truly reduced. However, this his highly unlikely. Draco particularly relishes days like this where his own lawyer adds insult to injury.
“Has she bonded you?” Draco asks Blaise, ignoring the others. His voice has started to crack, just a little, with the new information. Astrid is yelling to her sister about Celeste’s various crazy murmurings near the end.
When it is finally Draco's turn on the stand, Dolohov’s lawyer asks him to explain the events as they occurred.
“It’s not illegal,” Draco mutters, while spluttering water from his lungs. It’s so cold, it numbs him. He doesn’t even really feel lit.
She tilts her head to the side. This had been a large point of contention for them, over the years. “Wouldn’t fuck me
Draco sinks into his chair and stares at his hands. Somewhere between his awful cry for help on the stand and now, Draco has made his way to his seat next to Barnaby. He doesn’t remember how. Everything seems to be going white around the edges, like he’s dying.
Draco doesn’t have anywhere to go, if he broke out of prison. Since Maleka, Blaise, and Astrid are three of the most tragically inept people perhaps on this Earth, Draco doesn’t feel they deserve to break out of prison either.
Maleka finally looks up, her twin black stare only a little bit unsettling now. She tilts her head to the side.
“Can you turn it down a notch?” Potter asks, laying on his back now. “I feel like I’m about to suffocate.”
His story isn’t straight. Draco knows he went on the plane with the drugs. He returned to London with the empty suitcase and gave it back to a man with a long beard like Dumbledore. He had thought it was a muggle for many years, but recently he noticed the alpha pheromones and assumed it was a wizard. It is much easier to traffic drugs as a wizard.
Harry howls with another hoot of laughter. It startles Draco for the second time. “You know it! You know the history!” He says it like he’s barely restraining pointing his finger.
Granger cocks her head to the side, slowly starting to row the boat again. “I am aware that you mentioned it during holding.” Apparently, Draco mentioned it during holding. “But that’s not where you speak to him, is it?”
She cuts him off again with the same hand gesture. She looks nothing like Narcissa, but they are wearing an identical facial expression. “I am trying to tell you that we have programs for omegas like you at this prison. It will be nothing like you are probably expecting.”
“Sorry.” Potter whispers, his breath tickling the sides of Draco’s ear. “I’m – I’m sorry about everything.”
“You’re the one dating Pansy?” Draco asks quickly. He can’t stop himself. Even as it comes out of his mouth, he knows he’s going to pay for it brutally. Pansy has been his only real alpha in five years and if his body and magic realize she’s fully with Blaise, a person Draco is forced to live with now, he can kiss his remaining sanity goodbye. He can already feel his magic rising in his throat and threatening to choke him.
“The practice room for Dumbledore’s Army.” Draco supplies, easily. Potter raises his eyebrows. “I saw it once.” He doesn’t remind Harry that it was with Umbridge, but he can see that he knows already.
“No, no, no, no, no.” Potter sounds a little bit desperate, and quickly gathers Draco’s upper body against his chest. “Focus on where we are. Focus on the trees and the sounds of the birds.”
Draco doesn’t care. Unlike Celeste, he doesn’t need a source to crush his enemies. The guard quickly feels the sickening amount of magic in the air and calls for Granger, slamming the door behind him.
Draco slams the phone onto the desk so hard that it sounds as if there is an earthquake in Wandsworth Prison. He glares at Barnaby through the glass divider.
Draco wraps his arms around himself, still freezing, but shocked to find that he’s not wet. He’s even more surprised to find himself wearing Slytherin robes, especially because Harry is wearing a muggle suit.
“Not every omega is a simpering fool.” This implies that Draco is one. “Not every omega needs an alpha to kiss them goodnight.” This implies that Draco does. “And no omega needs an alpha to be magically powerful.” This, finally, is objectively true. “We are the strongest of wizards – we have no weakness but ourselves.”
“Your Honor, he is clearly lying to avoid a longer sentence!” The lawyer is holding somebody’s hand, somebody on Dolohov’s side. “This omega no longer has an alpha because of Draco Malfoy’s actions!”
to avert his eyes. He’s never had a problem with alphas before, but this is somehow different. He doesn’t have anything to offer now except submissiveness.
In Draco’s inexpert opinion, that seems slightly unnecessary. Runes circles are used to boost magic and Draco imagines that this room has excess magic in spades. Additionally, runes circles need the sound of a metal gong to begin.
He wasn’t a very good model. He had horrible stage presence and was incredibly shy in front of people, resulting in very weird looking photographs of him slouched over on a few editorial pages.
“The dementors won’t bother you.” Narcissa spits. “You can sit here in peace. You won’t be forced into anything else now that you don’t have enough magic.”
?” Draco asks sitting in the grass that doesn’t feel like grass. It feels scratchier, cheaper. It feels like he’s in a cheap imitation of his mother’s garden.
“My Confundus is not ideal, Mrs. Weasley!” Barnaby is always playing the victim. He continues to spout excuses throughout Draco’s quick trip to St. Mungos and his return to house arrest in Malfoy Manor. Draco starts to completely tune them out.
“Is that the secret code around here?” Draco asks. “Nobody can tell me dick and I’m supposed to be okay with that?”
It’s not even a sex fantasy (which would somehow be better). In the fantasy, he is physically beaten. On his face is a large black eye that stretches to his temple and an open gash that cuts from his neck down to his left nipple. Even though the story behind the wound is vague, those specific injuries are always present.
When she hands him the blanket, Draco can’t remember why he’s asked for it. The worst part is, she asks him how his past
In the first stony silenced minute Lucius reaches out and slaps him across the face. “You’re letting them get to you.”
It’s shocking. Is he changing the future by saying the wrong thing? Is he supposed to know what he said two bloody years ago?
His mind continues. For some reason, this imaginary Harry starts to move the hand around his waist up and down, far beyond the limits of what is considered appropriate for non-mates. He brings Draco’s head down to his shoulder and strokes his hair, slowly, reverently, and shushes him, murmuring softly into Draco’s ear until he sobs.
None of this makes any sense to Draco, but Potter seems to be genuine. He hadn’t even noticed that the garden had gone extremely dark in the couple of minutes when Draco was being too uncooperative. As he settles back against Potter, the sun seems to peek from behind the trees again.
and it is dying for attention. He’ll stay for a few hours and drown in her easy companionship, and even that will help a little. “If I die in prison it’s on you.” He does mean for this to be a joke.
The white muggle shirt he’s wearing is open because it’s been split from the collar to the armpit, presumably by Draco himself, as he’s trying to staunch the flow of blood with a Wizard’s travelling cloak. Sometimes, he’s pressed in an alley behind the Leaky Cauldron. Other times, he’s imagined himself in Knockturn alley. Either way, it’s twilight. The entire scene is bathed in blue light.
“Wait – Stay here!” Potter hisses. “Just—don’t think about the logistics of it. You don’t want to go back there either.”
So – the answer is constant incompleteness. The answer is to stare longingly at every man he sees on the streets. Draco must accept begging with his eyes to be held by everyone he comes into contact with only to flinch away. He’s just supposed enjoy the consistent magical ability, even though it will slowly drive him insane.
Potter hisses like he’s so frustrated he can’t help but let something out. Draco wonders if this is how he treated his wife; whom he apparently beats.
Nobody bats an eye when Draco is cutting them a check, but at the trial everybody wants to find out he’s been working for Gringotts or something. Draco thinks that his mother should realize that people always choose money over pride, even omegas.
Leaning against the tiny Azkaban holding cell, in the blue light of evening, Draco can almost imagine the scene is about to happen for real.
I kept feeling like everything I was writing was deteriorating in quality but I'm sort of happy with this. I'll start working on chap4 so hopefully it won't be another 4 months :)
Right before Barnaby can ask Narcissa if they are going to lunch after this, Draco keeps everybody back to ask a question. The look of shock at his vocality is mirrored on each of their faces.
After a while, the magic starts to burn when it’s forced from him and the tsunami becomes weaker. It doesn’t pound over him in a block but falls like a heavy rain. It doesn’t suffocate anymore, it just pours.
Day 3 of solitary conferment waiting for his trial is the first that feels like torture. He is starting to believe that his magic is sentient and feels so bad for him that it creates Harry. If most of it hadn’t been flushed out through his pores, he would have definitely convinced himself of this. As it is, Dream Harry seems weaker and weaker. The thought of never seeing him again makes Draco feel like he’s going to throw up.
The lawyers exchange looks with each other, each scrambling to make a comment about Draco’s insanity.
Draco feels so angry all of a sudden, he can feel himself exploding latent magic all over the room. Seemingly despite himself, Harry smiles, which makes Draco even angrier. “You told me you wanted me to stay in the garden! You told me not to go! Well, now I don’t want to. I’ll stay here forever.”
Typically, the ministry lackey is Granger. Draco is less surprised to see her than Barnaby (who detests these sort of events) and is certainly shocked to see his mother.
He is sentenced to no more than ten but no less than five years in Azkaban, effective beginning tomorrow. Barnaby is celebrating, as Draco has gotten a “light” sentence. He may even be allowed some privileges (without any explanation of what those are) due to the prison reform bill, expected to pass in the Wizengamot next month. Granger is there rattling off about that, but Draco doesn’t really hear it.
“Domestic violence?” Draco lifts one of his eyebrows and watches Potter roll his shoulders back. Jackpot.
Older Draco looks disappointed. “Which fucking version of us went to the Hallow’s Eve gala?” Draco is so thrown by the change of subject and weird phrasing that he doesn’t think about the answer. “It was you – it wasn’t me.”
Draco’s magic is not as forgiving nor as beautiful as muggle gasoline. Potter’s anger detonates in a split second, consuming the cell with blue fire.
Narcissa and Barnaby are arguing about something while Draco slumps into a chair he doesn’t recognize. “Rose garden...” he mumbles trying to place where he even is in the Manor. Granger puts her hand on his shoulder and deeply shocks him, to the point where Draco doesn’t really recall who she is.
from Pansy’s balcony for everyone to hear. Perhaps it is a testament to his continued sanity that he doesn’t.
Just when he settles down to try and sleep, another prisoner barges into the room with a huge cacophony of sounds. The guard is asking if he can do anything to make this new prisoner more comfortable, which makes Draco want to scream again.
“The omega?” Draco asks bitterly after picking up the phone again. “Show them a sweet, simpering omega without an alpha –”
This would make him a very calm prisoner, but a piss poor wizard. And– it breaks Draco’s heart to know that this is what he immediately thinks– a horrible omega. It’s like taking his birthright and throwing it back in his face.
Draco lies back in the grass. Now, it feels gloriously like he remembers, if not better. Potter pulls his hand away, and Draco eyes snap back at him, certain that he’s done something wrong. The scene shifts, as if he's looking at a copy of the garden he remembers.
Potter stands up and walks over to the bed that Draco’s sitting on, and he knows he’s fucked up. He’d only been trying to make Harry Potter a little crazy, that’s not illegal, and he quickly tries to rein in the magic he’s been letting fill all over the room.
Sometimes Draco thinks about this as if it’s banal, just something for him to daydream about. Sometimes it’s so powerful it feels like he’ll die if it doesn’t happen. Sometimes he thinks it would change his life.
They both stare at each other for a long moment. Lucius grits his teeth. “You are an ungrateful child. Everything I did was to show you a higher order.”
Draco does know, unfortunately, but only because he reads the astrology section in The Prophet. “Yes, well,” he’s looking at the ground again, curse him. “Doesn’t every young wizard want to commune with Phul?”
Draco especially mourns the loss of the man he expected to become as a child. He misses the dream omega life he had imagined for himself when he presented.
The mere force of the water is not the genius of the flush. Draco’s own magic submerges him, holds him down, and waits for Draco’s body to panic. It’s the intensity that causes his magic to quickly fight for survival, a response to imminent death.
After that conversation, and several dressing downs from Barnaby and his mother, Draco feels like utter shit on the day of his trial. He makes Lucius, after five years of withdrawal in Azkaban, look like a top model.
The mad-dog lawyer slashes any sympathy Draco was shown but passing out the pictures of how Draco completely destroyed Dolohov’s face. He takes a great deal of time to go over how Draco not only shot and killed him but also tore into the gunshot wound with his hands. The doctor that Dolohov has called in goes through every bloody detail of every demented thing Draco did to the corpse.
Nobody says a word until Narcissa decides to stir the pot a little. “Lucius said he would speak to you about what you have an obligation to say.”
Lucius is getting angry, but Draco hates to be spoken to like he’s a child. “Tell Harry Potter – when he inevitably asks about the limits of your power – that you can go into the vellum that he so desperately wants to get into!”
Potter turns around and flops against his bed, banging the back of his head against the wall in a gesture of giving up completely. “It’s not domestic violence. Merlin.”
Granger herself is raising one eyebrow at him. “Mr. Malfoy is talking about a new program we are implementing in the new wing. Therapy. For omegas.”
Barnaby paints the same sad, pathetic picture of an omega wallowing away in his prime, feeling threatened by the three other omegas whom he shared a cell with. He outdoes himself with a thrilling narrative of Draco’s trauma from witnessing a murder – one that Draco himself committed – and being forced into cohabitation so quickly. It’s a stunning argument that makes so little sense the silence rings for a moment after Barnaby finishes his closing argument.
“Yes.” Draco doesn’t know at all. “I’ve spoken to him.” Harry did not mention why he was there at all.
Draco jumps down from the top bunk into the water with a loud splash, grabbing Blaise’s collar, holding him down as the water rises. “Is the bite worth it now?” He asks quickly. Even to his own ears, he sounds absolutely batshit.  “It’s only going to protect you from alphas.”
“No,” Draco says, noting that Potter instantly believes him. “No. I don’t make a practice of going out to Wiltshire ever and especially not to give myself a heart attack.”
Draco did not go to Wiltshire with Harry; he would have remembered that. Is that the point of this exercise? Is he supposed to go to Wiltshire with Harry to summon a child’s fairytale with old magick?
“No.” Older Draco is beside him again, while current Draco still plays this role. “You really don’t remember?”
“Dueling space,” Harry Potter answers from behind him, walking into a door that Draco hadn’t seen before. “You don’t recognize it becau—”
Barnaby – of course – looks furious. An upstanding citizen like himself would never sell drugs or confund muggle security aurors. “Thanks for not leaving out any information, Draco!”
“C’mere, Draco, let’s crack on.” Barnaby holds up the magically binding handcuffs as if they are merely an annoying fashion accessory for
Draco rolls his eyes. Apparently, standard procedure for welcoming inmates to Azkaban involves a trip to the principal’s office. “I can’t set anything on fire by myself.”
“Harry?” he asks a completely empty room with very little furniture. It’s a risk, for certain. This looks sort of like a vacant area of The Manor. Classroom? Unused bedroom?
“Oh, yes, I forgot you were friends still,” Blaise finally says but he’s too self-absorbed to see Draco’s own body betraying him. “I feel so guilty I can’t be with her; she’ll need my magic for the baby.”
It’s amazing that even when selling filthy muggle drugs, Dolohov still didn’t expect a hand gun after disarming Draco of his wand.
After several minutes in the boat without Granger saying a single word, Draco starts picking at the magic handcuffs until he shocks himself.
“It’s easy.” Draco says, which it is. “I take the drugs from London in a suitcase. I confund the muggle plane security officer. I arrive in Moscow and give the suitcase to...” it’s a dark moment.
The lawyer looks extremely annoyed, even more so than Barnaby, still steaming about Draco’s not-so-secret job. “Mr. Malfoy you are on trial for knowingly killing Antonin Dolohov, a wizard, with a muggle firearm in muggle London.”
Within a few seconds, Draco is looking at Pansy as his younger self. He is living the All Hallow’s Eve ball as if it were the present.
But he’s not sitting on the bed. He’s... sitting on the floor? Potter squats and grabs the back of Draco’s hair and pulls his face up, so that they are staring in each other's eyes. “How did you know that story?”
Barnaby is sulking because he was supposed to go with Granger. Narcissa was a last minute and frankly unsettling arrival. The setting of the wild ocean, whipping ocean spray, and Draco shivering in a threadbare Azkaban robe also seem to add to a formidable ambiance.
Draco vaguely remembers this night. It was an “honor” to be invited (per Lucius) and a “shame” it was because of his “silly hobby” (per Narcissa). In reality, Draco had been invited to drop a suitcase of coke in the ministry bathroom for a high-ranking transportation official. He can’t remember which one.
To Draco’s utter embarrassment, he feels the stupid tears threaten for what feels like the hundredth time recently. When he drops his eyes, he feels the first few start to fall, and he tries start talking, to make excuses for this, but his breath hitches. “Baby,” Harry says bringing his hands up to brush his tears away, the same classic alpha/omega transfer Draco was just lusting after. But Harry takes it once step further- he leans in and breathes in the scent just behind Draco’s ear, at his pulse, and kisses him a few times there, before whispering in his ear. “My baby-- don’t cry. Shhhhh. Don’t cry.”
The High Inquisitor holds out her hand to stop Dolohov’s mad-dog lawyer. Draco feels attacked from all sides. “Mr. Malfoy, how did you get into this line of work?”
Barnaby, by some miracle, has left him with some magic. He can still light sparks in his cell and play tic-tac-toe using his hand to draw the etches in the walls. Sometimes, the flint doesn’t seem to be required anymore and then it comes back all at once, as if he’s been recharged.
“No.” Barnaby holds his gut while he stands up. “You were fighting the whole time, before. I knew those damn Azkaban healers were trying to just kill you. They don’t have the money for whatever Granger is cooking up, I promise you that!”
Draco pulls his legs onto the bed and sits “crisscross applesauce.” Pansy taught him that term from watching muggle TV. He puts his elbows on his knees and leans over to stare at Potter, who won’t meet his eyes.
He throws Draco’s wrist back against his chest and grabs the back of his hair, throwing his face towards the ceiling. He waves his wand again, a complicated motion that Draco recognizes from caring for Celeste. Draco spares a moment to be surprised that Barnaby is capable of the flush.
“You don’t remember this?” Older Draco asks. Current Draco shakes his head. It feels like a movie he’s watched, not something he’s lived.
“Come here, baby,” Harry says and holds his arms open. When Draco scurries over to him and buries his hand into Dream Harry’s neck it feels real.
After that, the boat ride is so charged with hatred between the three of them that it would be difficult to navigate the sea with calm waters.
Phantom Draco scoffs. He waves his hand until the cells is replaced with a meadow. Somehow, it’s the same meadow Draco saw in prison, but noticeably upgraded. It smells like real honeydew now, no faint trace of paint like it was designed for a theatre production. “Sorry-- Azkaban was depressing me.”
“Draco,” Barnaby, the Malfoy’s long-suffering lawyer, says to get his attention. Draco is staring at his hands and refuses to meet Barnaby’s eyes. “
To add to that feeling, Hermione Granger has arranged (as a kindness) a meeting with Lucius before Draco’s court date.
The door opens and the water floods outside, leaving Draco wet from his waist down. Blaise, having been held under the current, is sputtering.
Draco has had a repeated dream about Harry Potter for a long time. Before he saw him in the holding cell. Before he started hallucinating him. Draco has imagined him.
Somehow, without realizing it, Draco is pulled from thinking about this into the memory itself. Draco Two (older, wiser, bonded) is standing next to him.
Narcissa flips her stare back to him, just for a second. “I don’t pretend to know what you can and cannot do, darling.” It’s enough – barely – for Draco to deduce what he needs to do.
Draco pushes a little, watches the rain expand to fill the entire room. He watches it soak Barnaby and laughs at his face of utter betrayal. His magic, at this level, is playful. Barnaby may not agree, but a little bit of madness is wholesome.
Granger makes a face. “We would like to start you in the new wing. It would be a trial basis and we can send you to your father’s side of the prison at any time. That is where violent offenders go.”
It’s happening again. Draco doesn’t know what he’s said or what he knows. Potter can rejoice – Draco is stunned into submission, just like Potter wants.
Barnaby grimaces. “You are a danger to the statute of security here.” This is true. “The prosecutor has said that you are...” Barnaby looks as if he is slowly being stabbed.
“What a load of shite!” Astrid is saying somewhere in the background and Draco tries to let her screechy voice carry him away. “Who told you that? Mama? I’ve always said she went completely detruit in the end!”
Azkaban arraignments do not live up to the hype. Each of the “council” is sat on a wooden church pew that looks as if it was swept in by the ocean. To Draco’s left, his own stunning team of legal professionals: Barnaby, his mother who will not speak, and himself.
“Fine,” Potter says, letting go of Draco’s hair. Draco can feel it sticking up in the back from where it was clutched in Potter’s fist.
Instead of the easy fight Draco is expecting, Potter’ face breaks into a wide smile and he laughs. “Of course.” He shakes his head. “I forgot that you remember everything.”
Draco shrugs and for the first time in quite a while, feels like an utter fool. “I’m not enjoying the trade off.”
“No.” Lucius snaps. “No. They said this was a place. A physical place somewhere between the fabric of the present and the future. Somewhere else entirely.”
Draco cocks his head to the side, looks at his father. He tries to understand if he seems desperate or not.
She is looking at him like he’s stupid for not realizing it. Rationally, Draco knows this is true. Without magic they wouldn’t have to cook up an insane punishment for him. Now, Barnaby can go to appeals and argue that Draco is no longer a threat to the prison population. He’s not even a threat to himself.
Draco was not expecting that she paid any attention to his heat schedule, so this comment throws him a little. “What if I’d never fuck you in a million years with or without heat?”
Draco knows how rare withdrawal is, as alphas usually cannot resist omegas. He knows that omegas are built to give children, to provide for their communities. He knows that his bitter anxiety and creeping madness is rooted in needing another person. He needs somebody who claims him, at the very least.
The only people in the Manor, ever, are Narcissa and Barnaby who mostly talk in hushed voices over the fireplace. Draco is allowed to go wherever he pleases, legally, as long as he doesn’t leave the country. He steps outside of the wards and apparates to Pansy’s apartment in London.
“Are you okay?” That’s Blaise. He’s been day-dreaming about Pansy through the whole Celeste conversation.
“Oh my God.” Older Draco is still shocked. He rubs his hand over his face. “You’ve never seen me before!”
Draco has literally summoned demons to boost dark magic, just to get himself out of his own cellar when he has locked himself in. He isn’t afraid of the spirit of the moon, who is most often explored by children.
Harry keeps shushing him, but every time Draco starts to settle he remembers that this is a horrible trick his mind decided to play in his insanity and it becomes impossible to listen to the praise that Dream Harry keeps whispering, to the point where it feels like he’s having a panic attack. It feels like he’s back in the white room, watching from the outside as his magic suffocates him.
Bonding bites can only be given during an omega’s heat. They are a permanent mark of ownership. In Draco’s research, it would bind his magic to Pansy’s so that she could tap into it at any time. For Draco, the bite would serve as a reminder that he belongs to somebody. It would be visible, so he wouldn’t be threatened in prison. It would be a tacit reminder, so hopefully Draco could power through withdrawal. This is, in Draco’s inexpert opinion, the reason his father has not become detruit.
Draco feels the hot burn of annoyance sting down his back. “Oh, really dim of me to realize in three seconds flat instead of inherently knowing about this stupid idea before even walking in.”
Potter laughs, deep and low. It sounds so good in his voice. It reminds Draco of singing. “I still don’t want to tell you, but you already know.”
“She sucks up his magic!” Astrid says scratching her grossly overlong fingernails across the paint to make the necessary symbols. “He’s completely useless after she comes! How are we supposed to break out if one of us has no extra magic!”
Sometimes when the magic threatens to overwhelm him, Draco is floating instead of sinking. It’s like listening to a language that you can barely speak – so easy to tune out and not understand it. He listens to his magic running beneath his skin like a dam broken and tries to see if he can differentiate it, as he can words.
“You know that one?” Potter asks, rolling his head over to the side while leaning against the concrete blocks behind him. It’s a poor attempt for a diversion, but it does throw Draco a little bit. Before he launches further into his interrogation, he realizes that he’s enjoying himself.
. Draco isn’t hurt at all, the only wound he has is the old cut down his face from muggle prison, but he's been watched closely since.
“How did you not realize it was him?” The lawyer is getting angry. The lawyer is an alpha. “How did you not recognize the man who hired you?”
It’s Barnaby. Draco doesn’t bother to look up or say anything. He falls to the floor and lies supine across the concrete.
“She doesn’t visit you?” Draco asks, suddenly feeling heartsore for poor Blaise even though he’s still entertaining the stupid runes circle idea.
Draco had always assumed her husband’s affair had finally sent her into madness. Now Draco thinks she ended it because she had managed to give birth to pretentious and annoying children.
“What did you do?” Harry Potter is in the same cell as Draco, which means he did something. He did something bad enough to be in a ministry holding cell.
Harry looks at Draco with wide-eyed wonderment, like he’s just discovered something and is thrilled by it. “You aren’t afraid?”
“Well golly gee, Mr. Potter, you better get downtown immediately.” Draco rolls his eyes. He tries to pitch his voice higher, so that Harry can hear that he’s mocking him. “You might not have time to banish the pentagram, but you can still invite God into the circle.”
