Nothing happened. He frowned, enunciated more clearly.
"No harm done," he said casually, stepping out of the shower and purposefully waiting until Potter, obviously flustered, backed out of the room, muttering something about things to do.
"You try," he said quietly, holding it out to Harry. "We'll know then, won't we? Whether it's the wand or me."
The pain came then; it seemed to be everywhere, compromising his ability to breathe properly, to move, to think. He made it up onto his hands and knees, then to his feet by sheer force of will. Dizzy, sick, confused by the tangle of jeans around his knees. He pulled them up, thinking one of his fingers seemed to be broken, not choosing to think about anything else, because if he did he would tip over into the bottomless pit of fear and horror that lay before him.
It was stifling in the small space behind the end bookshelf and Draco shifted by a minuscule amount, longing for a drink of water. The temptation to creep out of his hiding place was growing stronger by the minute and he was flexing his thigh muscles, preparatory to moving, when he heard a scuffling sound in the corridor outside Malfoy Manor library. He froze immediately, heart beginning to race as fear tightened its grip around his chest.
"I want to make you come."
Potter folded his glasses carefully and put them on the wooden bench. As soon as he straightened up, Draco hit him in the mouth.
Harry stared at her in bewilderment. Of course Malfoy needed treatment, if it wasn't already too late.
Harry's smile faded, every part of his body suddenly completely aware of the man in front of him. Malfoy stared back, the pupils in his eyes flaring, his lips parting as Harry leaned in and kissed him without even realising he intended to...lips cool and pliant beneath his own, then warm tongue and mint as Malfoy opened up to him.
" and turned eagerly to Malfoy.
Harry just held him, horribly conscious of the injured ribs and oddly aware of the firm, lithe body flush against his own.
"I think I might practice by myself for a while. It seems I need to work on my self control."
"Yes, quite."
Cont...
Cont...
"Seriously? They actually have lessons for that stuff?"
They left Harry to his toast, heads together and brows drawn as they picked away at the problem. Stomach full and head fuzzy with exhaustion, Harry left them to it and nodded off in his chair.
When he woke the next morning, that warm ache had been replaced by an uncomfortable knot of fear in his gut and the weight of Malfoy's arm slung casually across his chest. Harry turned carefully onto his side, splayed a gentle hand over the lean waist beside him and just concentrated on breathing steadily, trying to control the feeling spiralling inside him.
"Did I tell you?" Ron interjected. "Briggs found out all three of the ex-Slytherins are trading illegally under the name Snakeskin Potions?"
"I'll do what I can, Harry, but I can't promise anything. Feelings are still high about Death Eaters and the Ministry is obviously no exception."
"The landlord, he's got another five warehouses. So, maybe more than one is being used by Romani? Oh, and Hermione is joining us to serve the warrants."
"Yes. So as you can imagine I'd rather not stand here chatting."
Harry swallowed convulsively, heat scorching his own spine as he felt Malfoy's testicles draw up; he gave a final series of spasmodic thrusts and came in back-arching streams into Harry's throat, blond head thrown back and moaning helplessly. Still swallowing, Harry orgasmed violently, completely untouched.
The body beneath him shifted slightly, as though Potter had caught a deep breath, making Draco suddenly aware of ribs and hipbones beneath his own torso. A hand came up and a finger ghosted over his swollen eye.
Really hoping to get over that 300 kudo mark this time - looks appealing in a puppy-like way!
Just Malfoy, thought Harry wryly; he'd never been just Malfoy.
"D'you want me to...?"
"Now?" he asked in a dull tone.
"It's complicated; it's Malfoy," said Harry with a shrug, wishing it had been something as simple as a fight.
"Go home, Draco." His mother's voice again. "Don't worry about anything now. Just go home."
Draco waved a hand in a dismissive fashion, privately reminding himself that antagonising Potter wasn't the best idea, especially as the man was so disgusted by him.
Malfoy was worried, that much was obvious. He was covering it up well, but Harry had been watching him for too many years not to recognise the way his mouth went all pinched on one side. He took the velvet bag from Harry with trembling fingers and slowly tipped the wand out into his hand.
"You could have been killed!"
Draco agreed, thinking privately that there was only so much exposure he could stand to tangled black hair and the tingle of magic every time their fingers came into accidental contact. It was no good dwelling on things like that, not when an unplanned snog had caused Potter such distress.
"That's ridiculous!"
"Dressed?" Draco ventured.
"Mattock!" Fury reddened Harry's cheeks as he recognised the werewolf. He turned to Robards. "What are you playing at?"
He was still flushed and off-balance. Draco smirked weakly at him, enjoying the spectacle; in fact it was probably the high point of his day, although he wasn't quite sure why.
It reminded him that it was odd there'd been no mention of his comments the previous evening; Harry had been expecting at the very least a sharp jibe or two. All his own attempts to bring up the subject had been swiftly diverted, but perhaps it was just another indication that Malfoy was no longer the school boy he remembered.
Draco followed them out, rolling his eyes at Weasley's baffled expression when he handed the coffee and sandwich over to the shop doorway resident.
Day One of his new and hopefully brief attachment to the Aurors did not start well for Draco. They arrived at the Ministry by floo at exactly five minutes to nine and by two minutes to nine the entire workforce, their relatives and their friends knew Draco Malfoy had been escorted into the Ministry by Harry Potter.
Harry trailed after the other man as he made his way slowly up the stairs, wishing he could just use a levitation charm when he saw how much Malfoy's legs were shaking. The magic of Grimmauld Place murmured around them, strong suggestions of sympathy and frustration in its tone.
Fearing on some subliminal level that Potter was the sort who would like to talk about things, Draco was tempted to close his eyes and pretend to be asleep. After all, Potter probably hadn't had much choice when it came to caring and sharing, being friends with Granger and the gregarious Weasleys. Draco however, was a Malfoy and did not wish to care and share in any manner.
"Thank you. I don't know why I didn't think to ask before..."
Some time later, he became aware that Potter was slouched beside him and had hold of his hand. The grip was warm and calloused and thrumming with power. It dulled the pain radiating throughout Draco's body even as it brought back shards of nightmares, all terrifying and all at some point featuring Potter, who had seemed determined to save Draco from whatever terror had hold of him. Time and again Potter's face had appeared in his delirium, always anxious and concerned as his hand reached out to Draco, as though it was the fiendfyre all over again.
"When you explained, in there, faced him down when he wanted to...that was so..."
"Do you really think I can't protect myself against a Malfoy?" "...we need him, and he needed the deal..." "We'll get this case sorted, Malfoy will go back to doing whatever it is that he does and we can all get back to normal."
Snape's eyes glittered like black diamonds.
"Let it go, Ron," said Harry, his voice mild although his expression was tight as he stood up. "C'mon, we'd better get back to it."
(See the end of the chapter for
Then Potter's mouth was on his neck, tongue and teeth licking and nipping as he pushed Draco against the wall. Draco arched against him, breathless with wanting, hard already against the zip of his trousers and the muscle of Potter's thigh.
"Yes mum." Harry put out a hand and tucked a curl behind her ear. "I'll do my Gryffindor best, okay?"
"Sir!"
A mate, thought Harry, bemused and not at all sure his ex-nemesis would be overly pleased at that thought.
"I don't know. I hope not," he said honestly.
"You don't have enough Slytherins in the Auror department; are there any Slytherins at all on the investigation?"
"There's really no point, Potter. They don't treat my sort at St Mungo's."
"Yeah." Harry took hold of his arm, intending to help him back to bed and was shocked at the heat pouring off the man.
"I...thank you. I wasn't expecting..."
Please do take the time to leave a comment or a kudo - they mean so much and inspire those updates!
Neither the heightened colour nor the fact were lost on the other man, who smirked at him again. Oddly, Harry didn't find the expression as annoying as it used to be at Hogwarts, it being preferable to lines of pain on Malfoy's face.
That was true enough and the conversation turned to safer subjects such as the re-decoration of some of the rooms in Grimmauld Place, which Malfoy seemed to find surprisingly pleasant, the bare bones of the potions case and general chat about the wizarding world to bring Malfoy up to date. By the time they'd gone through all that, the casserole was ready and Harry quickly levitated bowls and cutlery to the table.
With a mutter of disgust about the injustices of the world, Harry pulled out his mobile.
"Staring at people. You know, in polite society it's considered rude to stare."
He wasn't sure what happened next, but suddenly he was on the opposite side of the room and Hermione was in the kitchen, her hair escaping from a tidy bun and her hands reaching up to an angry-looking Weasley's shoulders as she spoke rapidly and earnestly.
Draco found he wasn't surprised. The only surprising thing in the last 12 hours was his stupidity in exposing his own vulnerability, and oddly enough that didn't bother him half as much as he thought it should.
It was almost affectionate, the way Potter was stroking him with his work-roughened fingertips, the way he kissed Draco softly on the corner of his mouth and mouthed the side of his neck. Draco steeled himself mentally from the hurt that would result if he let himself believe such things; Potter was a hugger, that's all. It didn't mean anything other than he was basically a nice person and wanted to make sure Draco was alright and got off too.
"Oh, who knows? Maybe I didn't want you to get hurt?"
"If he has, he's going to see me fuck you, Malfoy."
"That curse...I never asked...are you alright? Do you even know what it was?"
"You didn't take any painkillers?"
It's Weasley, thought Draco desperately. Just Weasley, who wanted to kill him, but that was better than... The room tilted, Potter's face blurring as it creased in consternation, his mouth moving but the words lost in the roaring in Draco's ears and the rising tide of pain from his ribs.
"She seemed to think Malfoy stepped in front of a curse for you. Doesn't sound like the Malfoy we knew though. I told her she must be seeing things. I mean, as if, mate!"
"River Water."Malfoy dropped his gaze, his blond hair falling forwards." It helps you to forget, Potter."
"Don't blame Ron." Hermione looked on the verge of tears. "There was a huge explosion and all the alarms went off. Then we found the hole in the wards. When they discovered the epicentre was the gym someone remembered you two going in there, but no one could get in because there was a powerful privacy spell on the door. Eventually the Aurors blew a hole through the wall, but you were gone and there was blood on the floor. What were we supposed to think!?"
Draco followed him, taking his time on the stairs and wishing rather pointlessly that he and Potter had been friends, or at least not enemies, so that Potter might actually want him to stay for longer rather than it being a case of a brief, charitable hand-out for a screwed up, stray Death Eater that no one wanted around.
Harry looked over his shoulder.
"You're right though. I hate seeing these people like this; it would be so easy..."
"It's not like that...oh stuff you Malfoy."
"Right," said Harry. "I'll be along in a couple of minutes."
Harry winced, feeling his cheekbones go red. It was so easy to react in the way he always had where Malfoy was concerned but the simple truth was they hadn't seen each other for years. He'd changed since the war, so perhaps the other man had too.
"Can't sleep?"
"Fuck," he moaned breathlessly. "I want you to...oh...please Harry!"
"Not your thoughts," Harry qualified quickly. "Just emotions."
"You look like shit," said Harry bluntly.
He swirled his tongue, one way, then the other, running it up and down the underside before he swallowed deep, one hand kneading Malfoy's ass and the thumb of the other stroking his inner thigh, working under his balls to press against the perineum. Malfoy rocked into his mouth, a stream of muttered curses in what sounded like French falling from his mouth as the pace increased.
"So long as Weasley keeps his hands off me," responded Malfoy with some bitterness. "And you, don't assume everything I do is with a nefarious intention."
Harry then went by floo from the Ministry of Magic directly to Hermione's office. He stepped out of the fireplace into morning sunlight heavy with the smell of herbal tea. It was no surprise to find her at work early, half-hidden behind a massive stack of parchment. She listened to him patiently and then pulled out several law books, flipping rapidly through the pages while Harry helped himself to home-made biscuits and admired the mysteries section of the impressive and well-organised bookcases.
"I know," said Harry in a soothing tone. "You need to lie down and I'll get a blanket."
Harry jumped at the amused drawl, realising belatedly that Malfoy was awake and staring at him with his not at all fascinating eyes. He felt his face heat up.
Oh, I don't know." Harry snapped, irritated despite his intentions. "Perhaps it's because that's what people do, help each other."
He gave her an impulsive hug, thinking again she was the bravest woman he knew. She hugged him back fiercely, then pulled away, her next question in such a casual tone that Harry instinctively knew the answer was of the utmost importance.
"Why not? They're dishes and it's not like you haven't got enough expensive junk in the Manor."
"Okay?" He offered.
"Run! Get out of my way, you fucking half-wit!"
"Forget Azkaban?"
The sharp tingle of a scourgify brought Draco back to the present with a rush. Potter was already on his feet, straightening his clothing and patting at his hair in a vain attempt to calm its waywardness. Embarrassed by his momentary lapse in concentration, Draco rose to his feet quickly and tucked himself away. It wasn't a moment too soon; there was a perfunctory knock and Potter quickly grabbed a file as the door opened.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stretched and sighed. "We'd better make a move."
"Severus."
"I'm going to come in you," Harry agreed. "I'm going to fill you up and you're going to come so hard and I'm never letting anyone else touch you again."
The vase didn't move but Malfoy hissed, sticking the wand under one arm and rubbing his hand down his leg and then examining his fingers.
"Have the restrictions been lifted then? I'm allowed to use magic again?"
Harry nodded, torn between relief and guilt at giving Hermione a thankless task. She seemed to read his mind and laid a hand in his arm, gave it a little shake.
"Please don't. They'd find a way to blame me, filthy Death Eater and all that." Malfoy shifted uneasily, his breath catching and his teeth sinking into his lip for a moment. "Why is it you're still here anyway?"
Woefully deciding that a feeble pretense at sleep would be ill-mannered, bearing in mind Potter's efforts over the previous few days, Draco sighed.
"No. It's medicinal. But I wasn't meant to have it, so..." He shrugged. "They'll believe the worst, I'm sure."
"Over here," Harry called quietly, rewarded by the quick turn of Malfoy's head.
Potter caught at him, steadying him automatically with a hand splayed around his waist that caused the direction of Draco's stumble to reverse. He fell briefly into Potter's embrace, thigh colliding with warm thigh. His heart stuttered, answered by the darkening of Potter's cheeks. They froze. A jolt of magic passed between them, undiluted emotions too jumbled to interpret.
Harry studied him, reading real fear beneath his haughty facade. It was that fear that made him speak the truth.
Malfoy's face held a hint of approval, though it was probably more at the snarkiness in Harry's tone than his Gryffindor boldness and sense of fair play.
He flicked his wand and a map appeared briefly before them.
Eventually, needing to breathe, Harry pulled off, the noise wet and obscene as Malfoy shuddered and groaned his protest, blond hair falling loose around his face and lips parted as his long eyelashes fluttered. Harry stared at him, stricken, something unexpected churning in his stomach.
The scene replayed itself in Harry's mind. Again he saw the glare of a curse shattering over a shield, Malfoy with his hand raised, the twisting arc of blue light...and a dark figure behind him.
He swung around to face Draco.
There was also the fact that although all of the warehouses were wizard-owned, three of them were in muggle London and a Wizarding Warrant alone was not sufficient. Hermione had contacts in the muggle courts and police force and was particularly friendly with the squib Detective Sergeant who would be accompanying them.
"I believe Potter, in his rather primitive way, noticed my wardrobe is coordinated," said Draco in a cool tone, although he'd only become aware of the fact during the course of the conversation. Of course, his clothing would usually be chosen deliberately, unlike Potter's random mish mash of colours and textures or Weasley's predilection for hand-knitted jumpers. This morning it had been pure chance.
"If I dared to take this glamour off now..."
"I can't be sure of course, not yet, but there are two on the list. Both are purebloods whose families were known supporters of the Dark Lord. And let's face it, Potter, legal employment hasn't exactly been an easy prospect for the likes of us, has it?"
Draco shuddered, allowing the dominance of Potter leaning over him, partly because it was Harry Potter and he trusted him, partly because his backside and thighs were already slick with Potter's semen, mainly because Draco's last experience of being penetrated was now a pleasurable, consensual thing rather than a scene from nightmare.
"The suspects won't be leaving here, or communicating with anyone, until your investigation is completed."  Robards gave Malfoy a hard look. "I hope you're keeping a close eye on Mr Malfoy, Harry."
It was as well he did, for the Auror detail chose that moment to arrive and Potter was close on their heels and his face was white and angry. Granger pulled him aside, speaking urgently, but Draco didn't wait around.
"I'm glad to see you're at liberty to visit me."
"It's very good of you to help us out, Headmistress."
Harry turned around then, a crazy smile pulling at his mouth, to find himself chest to chest with a dishevelled Malfoy. Whatever he'd been planning to say abandoned him, the words lost in the warm touch of Malfoy's breath, the unguarded look in his eyes.
"If you won't see a doctor, at least let me take you home. Where do you live now?"
A wall of light temporarily blocked Potter from view as Granger shrieked out "Protego" and the ice blue curse shattered against the shield she hastily threw at Potter.
"No. You deflected most of it, I think."
It was time to move, Draco thought; his body was beginning to respond to the other man flush against him and he knew it was only a matter of seconds before Potter felt an erection pressed against his groin. Draco put his hands flat on the floor, one on either side of Potter's shoulders, ready to push himself to his feet, but made the mistake of looking at the other man's face.
Potter pulled out one of the chairs with a grating noise. "Food is great," he promised them, tugging the laminated plastic menu out of its holder.
"Not bad. Quite promising actually."
"Right then, the parlour is pretty empty and there's not much you can break in there."
"I've been thinking," he said eventually. "The list of names we drew up today...O'Keefe, Yoki and Romani all went to Durmstrang, all apprenticed under Swinnerly and all specialised in plant extracts."
He tried to analyse it, realising quickly that it was only natural to have some reservations about what would happen when his friends and colleagues found out he was more than just a custodian for a Malfoy. The public wouldn't like it either, but frankly they could go and curse themselves.
Love to hear from you. Make me happy and send me some kudos! Thanks for reading :)
Harry nodded and just like that, they were gone, draped neatly over a chair even as his skin shuddered with the shock of the cool air. Then Malfoy was naked too, his body lean and sculpted and warm against him and Harry was instantly hard, wanting the other man with every fibre of his being.
Suddenly the armchair faltered. In the momentary lull the sound of Malfoy's breath sounded sharp and stressed. He seemed to sway, turning in Harry's direction with a face that was drawn, exhausted. Behind him the chair flickered and became a dark cloud shot through with lightning; it began to turn in on itself, twisting and spinning until a mini-tornado tore across the room.
In the meantime, Harry put a cooling charm on some ale, unearthed a decent bottle of suitably aged wine from the cellar and warmed up some leftover bolognaise, thinking they'd probably both benefit from a relaxed meal. He left the food under a stasis charm and apparated upstairs, only to find a bathroom dripping with condensation and Malfoy sprawled on his bed, a hint of colour in his cheeks and sound asleep. It was a stark reminder that the other man had been desperately ill only a few days before and despite magical intervention should still be taking it easy. Madam Pomfrey would most likely be having a few sharp words with them both at some point in the future.
Thanks for the kudos and comments :)
Again though, the rancour was missing and when the taxi turned up, Malfoy simply slipped into the backseat without protest.
Malfoy bent over and picked up his wand, balanced it across the palm of his hand and rubbed it absently with his thumb.
"Just hang on a bit longer, okay? They'll give you something to make you feel better, then if you want to go, we'll go."
Harry was waved to silence.
Potter was as skittish as a nervous thestral, his emotions clearly strung tight now the heat of his so very Gryffindor declaration of the previous evening had cooled.
Malfoy gestured at it frantically, but each motion seemed to increase the speed further. The funnel howled, sucking greedily at furniture and snatching up smaller items as it advanced towards them.
She sighed and patted his arm in a bracing manner.
"It's from Briggs," Harry announced. "One of the suspects talked. It looks like we have enough to convict Romani and O'Keefe. No-one is saying anything about Snakeskin Potions though; we still haven't got any leads on them."
"The terms of your probation...that should never have been allowed."
"Merlin! You're burning up!"
Draco shivered involuntarily and shrugged. "Potter thought I was cursing him," he noted bleakly.
"You're meant to stay in bed." Harry noted. "Don't let Madam Pomfrey catch you out of it."
"Sorry." Draco muttered. "You...I'm sorry; I know you don't want...this, with someone like me, with me."
"We're grateful for your help," said Potter carefully.
Draco smirked at him.
"I don't know what it was," Harry admitted. "I didn't get chance to ask. He looked okay though."
"Well, I'm asking now. Is that you in the ledger."
Harry pushed him slowly against the desk, watching all the time for signs of discomfort, then popped open the jeans' button, slid down the zipper and wriggled his fingers inside the tight space.
"I know. Let me sort something out first and then I'll tell him, okay?"
Harry nodded and hurried to comply, returning to the room in record time to find Malfoy lying in a pristine bed, tucked around with pillows and blankets and with a pale pink flush on his cheekbones.
"Interesting." Madam Pomfrey smiled. "As it happens, a colleague of mine is a specialist in the field of magical cores. She suggests that the situation may have been caused by the build up of energy in Mr Malfoy's core, as he was unable to use his magic for some time."
There was a whoop of excitement in the street and the sound of running feet that had no further cause to be stealthy.
"Knut for them, Potter."
"Why did you jump in front of it?"
"Would you mind, Potter?"
"I want to believe it," said Harry plaintively.
Fearful of what he would find, he opened his eyes warily to find Nagini towering over them. The shock made him flinch and Potter grasped his wrists reflexively, wincing and gasping as their skin came into contact. For a moment their eyes met and Malfoy registered that Potter seemed to be as terrified as himself. Then the other man's grip tightened, his expression morphing into a very Gryffindor mask of determination. Potter would face it, no matter what.
"No. Yeah...well maybe."
The ex-Death Eater did not look well, his elegant features now marred by scrapes and bruises and his lips split and swollen. The auror in Harry automatically noted the stiffness of the man's stance and the shadow of fear in his eyes.
Some awareness between them had started to change long before sectumsempra and fiendfyre, but it had faded into the background compared to the ever darkening maelstrom created by Voldemort, had become buried in the intervening years until the day Potter had more or less abducted him from Regent's Park.
More on that unknown curse next time. Love to hear from you 🍁
Privately thinking that Ron must like living dangerously if he'd told Hermione she was seeing things, Harry fumbled for an answer.
"Are you in trouble? I can help if you are."
A dull thudding accompanied Al's words as he set to with feet and fists.
It was when he was brushing his teeth that he caught sight of himself in the mirror, and was suddenly reminded of another mirror in a Hogwarts bathroom and a sectumsempra spell. He wiped his mouth with the towel, feeling nauseated. He'd been so scared of everything back then, but not half as scared as he should have been.
The case gave a minute twitch.
Malfoy broke away then, shock plain on his face.
"Arrangement?"
She stepped back then, a little frown pinching the skin of her forehead.
"Our snitches," snorted Weasley, smirking.
"It's evidence, mate."
They landed smack in the middle of a furious fight. In front of them Weasley was trading livid-coloured curses with a white haired wizard while Potter held off a younger wizard and a tall witch with a casual grace that made it look easy, although Draco could feel the surges of power from where he stood. The bulldog patronus circled them, still trying desperately to deliver its message.
No need for Malfoy to ask what he meant. Things had been a mess for him too and it looked like they still were.
"C'mon," Harry said quietly. "I've got a room ready. There's a bathroom on the same floor so it'll be easier for you."
"Yes, Potter."
"Yes, that'll do."
"Harry couldn't see properly," she said quietly.
"What? No."
"Is this okay, do you...?"
Once inside the taxi he pushed himself into the corner, leaning tight against the door, making sure to keep his hands in his pockets so Potter couldn't see how much they were shaking.
"Diagon Alley then?"
"Don't mind him," Potter explained. "Arthur found out that's what muggles call informants."
"And after that?"
"It's okay." Draco pressed a kiss to his forehead, just below his scar. "Really, it's alright. I'm alright."
Without waiting for a verbal response, he apparated them both to his bedroom and toppled Malfoy onto the bed.
"But it isn't mine now, is it? So it won't work."
In turn this reminded him that adult Malfoy was almost unbearably attractive and what with one thing and another Harry found his stomach clenched tighter than even the motion of the lift dictated. By the time they alighted, he was wound tighter than a spring and there was an uncomfortable pressure in his trousers.
Potter turned around in the doorway.
" How is he?"
The little vase rose gently into the air and hovered there until Harry released it and allowed it to sink back to the table.
"You, er, are wearing muggle clothes."
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter's hands moved lower, cupped Draco's arse cheeks and pulled him in so his cock ground against the hot swelling in Potter's joggers. There was a moment of pure, unadulterated fear and then the familiar scent of Potter's skin filled his nostrils and Draco writhed instinctively, moaning at the delicious friction in his groin as the other man's mouth moved harder against his own. He reached up and slid his fingers into soft black hair, tugging gently as his tongue delved deeper inside a throat that opened for him.
MysticKitten42 - you're the best 💐 This one is for you.
"What did you buy?"
"Very well." Snape stood and nodded at Draco. "I am always here, should you require anything."
"No," said Harry, a bit breathless from wanting to kiss the corner of that perfect mouth. "No, you're not. Not any more. What you're doing, it could really make a difference."
"Well, I just did," pointed out Harry calmly.
"Thank you," whispered Draco, allowing Potter to draw him to his feet and steer him out of the room.
"I never wanted that," said Harry firmly. "I don't want that. I just did what I had to do."
Harry frowned, studying his subject with an objective eye. Malfoy was...softer than he'd thought, with his tousled silver-gold hair and long eyelashes; more athletic than he remembered, with lean muscle on his long frame; far more damaged than he'd shown; as intriguing but less annoying than the schoolboy he'd been.
"I'm so sorry, Harry."
"Thank you so much for that vote of confidence."
"Er, yeah," he said awkwardly. "He did..er, step in front of it."
Harry gave a sharp laugh. "Just nothing good!"
"Yeah, I know. He's just so... He really needs help, Hermione."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I didn't know that was going to happen."
Concerned, Harry reached up, rubbing soothing patterns with his thumbs along the bunched muscles of Malfoy's thighs, up over his hips. Keeping eye contact, he slowly sucked the fingers of one hand into his mouth, wrapped them slick around Malfoy's cock and pulled gently, setting up a rhythm that milked a slow ooze of fluid that glistened as he used it to lubricate his strokes. Malfoy's breath quickened, his mouth opening a little more as he began to rock, slowly at first, the momentum building as he raised himself, sliding back down with a slight twist that sent a red flush into his cheeks. Harry pushed upwards, meeting each descent with increasing force, his hands moving involuntarily to grasp jutting hip-bones as Malfoy's head went back, throat and chest flushed, his breath audible as he slammed himself down to meet Harry's thrusts. Just looking at him was enough to send Harry over the edge.
"I used to love coming here," he added suddenly. "If I did well, Father would take me to Fortescue's or Quality Quidditch Supplies. Everyone who was anyone would come up and want to speak to him. I thought the sun shone out of his arse, Potter. I thought he loved me and I wanted to be just like him."
"Are you okay to...?"
Potter's fists uncurled, his strong, square fingertips pressing against the woodgrain.
Malfoy jerked his wrist away and rubbed at it absently, the set of his mouth bitter.
"And did Mr Malfoy feel the same thing?"
She turned a wary eye on Malfoy.
He was still gasping for breath when he felt Malfoy lifting away, his cock jutting in front of him and flushed pink.
Draco dried himself slowly, every swipe of the towel a symbolic polish to his fragile veneer of being "absolutely fine, thank you".
"Is there something more I need to know, dear? You seem completely exhausted."
Draco wanted to shrivel up and die. How fucking humiliating. If only, just once, he'd been able to exercise sound judgement and not make his life even more unbearable.
They burst out of the Floo into the calm ambience of the main parlour in Grimmauld Place, the leather settees and warm lamplight a welcome relief after the stark lights of the detention block. Harsh, white lighting had been a modernisation approved by Robards himself, on the grounds the old-style candlelit lamps were reassuring to the average wizarding criminal, who most likely had that sort of lighting at home.
He clenched his fists then, waiting for the sneer, for it all to fall apart around him. He'd known it wouldn't last. He wasn't allowed the things other people were allowed, like parents, like someone who was there just for him; Sirius, Ginny...he'd lost them all.
"How many of the Hogwarts team are mixed-up in this?"
Weasley snorted, muttering something through his food about "posh" and "ferret".
It wasn't until he'd levitated a freshly-made chicken salad sandwich and glass of iced water onto the path next to Malfoy and covered them with stasis charms that he realised Hermione was watching him with a curious expression on her face.
Draco jumped, shocked back into the present, and made some sort of garbled comment that Potter obviously translated as 'no', because a split second later the bathroom door flew open and the saviour of the wizarding world rushed in. He came to an abrupt halt as his glasses steamed up in the moist air and muttered a quick spell to clear them.
Any possible discussion about the Boy Who Lived being wary of a school healer was avoided when the Madam in question appeared in the floo. She dusted off her robes and fixed Malfoy with a stern glance.
Something of Harry's shock must have shown upon his face, for the nurse's frown eased, replaced by sympathy.
"Really, Potter, full sentences would help enormously."
Thanks for the comments and kudos - thanks so much for reading :)
When Potter shut the front door on the world, the cool silence of 12 Grimmauld Place settled around them. The innate magic of the house reached out with silken fingers to caress Draco's skin, transmitting a distinct feeling of pleasure at his presence. Draco flinched, half expecting aurors to appear to whisk him away to Azkaban.
"That might not be possible, Potter."
"Draco," he whispered, "Draco," and Draco came again, moaning as the room went white and silent as he arched into Potter's embrace.
Hermione looked at him with a mixture of disbelief and relief.
"You really did remarkably well, you know. Another hour or so and he would have died."
The words tumbled out before Harry could stop them. He regretted their unprofessionalism immediately.
Thank you so much for reading xx

"We'll deal with that if it happens. The Minister is prepared to take the risk and we've gambled on worse odds, Harry."
"RON! STOP! Harry clearly isn't being held against his will, so let's just ask him what happened!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is it illegal, this water?"
The owner of the voice dragged him upright, fingers digging into his biceps. Draco froze, breath stuttering in his throat, the room suddenly too warm yet the air icy cold on his skin. The owner of the hand gave him a little shake, then pushed him forwards until he collided with the edge of the table.
"Look, I don't know what your injuries are, and erm, you don't have to tell me. It's just, if you did, I'd know what to do to make you more comfortable. While you're here."
Malfoy didn't reply but an expression flitted across his face that was pure grief before he replaced it with his usual impassive mask. Harry suspected it would not have slipped at all if he wasn't so injured.
He looked a bit flustered himself but thrust his chin forwards a little and met Draco's gaze.
"Thank you," he said. "For seeing me."
"Fuck," whispered Harry, their breath mingling and something unfurling inside him that caused him to stroke back Malfoy's damp hair in a tender gesture.
With a look of boredom, often present on Ministry couriers, the owl helped itself to a treat from the dish on the window ledge while Harry scribbled a quick response. Minutes later, message attached, it slipped out through the open window and soared out of sight.

“Do you? Get it,” Draco asked, “Because I could

"Maybe," Harry muttered, wondering if that was Malfoy's motivation.
Left eye swelling, Draco staggered away from a kick that landed perilously close to his groin and hooked his foot around Potter's knee. Potter, nose bleeding, promptly bit him on the calf as he fell and dragged him down by gripping onto his t-shirt.
"Madam Pomfrey will be here any minute," he noted, in a rather winded tone, almost suffocated by an unexpected wave of remorse.
"Actually, I hate it, but no, I use it all the time."
Malfoy was on his feet, looking uncharacteristically awkward.
"You mean after you took my wand? Yes, of course; I used mother's wand."
"I know, but it's not like that."
"I need information," said Draco tiredly.
"You feel worse."
"It's the right thing to do and the Minister saw the sense in it. Of course, it's a sound move politically if the potion supply is stopped, despite the involvement of a Death Eater. I'm sure he'll get it signed off by tomorrow."
"But..." Harry swallowed, the awfulness of the situation making him feel sick. "Immobolus," he whispered. "I cast immobolus at him, Hermione!"
He startled when Malfoy's thumb brushed his cheek; he blinked furiously, but only succeeding in releasing more tears.
"Grow out of what?" he enquired weakly.
"It seems I'm not in a very good position," noted Draco. "The Ministry wants to withdraw their deal. I need to come up with something concrete."
Eventually Potter pulled off his glasses and scrubbed at his eyes with the heels of his hands.
"Hey mate, I think he's had enough there."
Harry turned, on his lips were anxious questions he had no idea how to present, but they were never uttered, forestalled by the broken air of the man before him.
"Er, right?"
Robards managed to sound apologetic, a somewhat difficult feat given the amount of satisfaction on his features.
She shook her head and with a sound of frustration, Harry disapparated.
Finally a warm mouth encircled him, pulled him in, slowly, tasting, caressing, sucking. It was familiar, yet completely different than Ginny's enthusiastic efforts, than the surprise of that first gents' room blow-job just before Harry's relationship fell apart and he'd realised that he wasn't as straight as he'd thought.
"Um, right," said Harry.
Draco leaned into his warmth, wound his fingers into Potter's auror robes.
"Let's go home," he said quietly, wondering vaguely why Grimmauld Place seemed more like a home if Malfoy was going with him, even if it was on a strictly temporary basis.
"Can you come through. I have a few questions for you and Mr Malfoy."
Get the coffee and plan what to say, what to do to alleviate the ridiculous situation and actually get Malfoy some aid.
"I know." Harry took a pinch of floo powder. "And, erm, thanks."
She stood up and rounded the desk to give him a quick hug.
Harry caught his breath, surprise clenching in his chest. The gaunt teenager who had been the bane of his student life at Hogwarts was no more. Bony shoulders that had held promise now showed the strength and breadth of a man, and legs that were long and skinny now revealed a play of lean muscle beneath denim. The haggard, exhausted face of war had filled out and smoothed, jawbone stronger, with the symmetrical facial curves of the young boy on the steps of Hogwarts still visible but now honed into the elegance of adulthood. It was unmistakably Draco Malfoy.
"It doesn't appear I'm the only one."
His first instinct was to just leave: leave Potter; leave Grimmauld Place; leave England. But there would be no point. He'd had his part of the bargain and the Ministry would expect payment in full, or quite possibly quote breach of contract and throw him back into Azkaban. He was trapped, just as caged by situation as he'd been under Voldemort's deranged rule.
For a moment Harry was frozen, with the shock of the unexpected encounter stealing strength from his limbs. Then his thoughts were tumbling; how, why was the boy...man... here? Was it a coincidence? Was Malfoy involved with the potion smugglers? It seemed unlikely he would need to stoop to such activities, but who knew what an ex-Death Eater did for a living.
It wasn't immediately clear to Harry why this was the case. He'd known Malfoy since they were eleven and Merlin knows he'd spent enough years keeping track of him. He'd never come across as particularly interesting before; spiteful, spoilt, irritating and scheming perhaps, but not interesting.
"What? Er, no rush. None. Got some things to see to...yeah things, you know."
Potter was cooking bacon, his hair in even more disarray than normal and a sheepish expression on his face as he turned. Draco took his time hanging his jacket on the back of a chair and then raised his head to find a look of shock on Potter's face, grease dripping slowly from the spatula hanging loose in his hand.
Harry padded swiftly to the door and into the hallway. He paused for a moment by Malfoy's door, not wishing to intrude, but driven on by almost palpable waves of anguish. The door opened silently, the light from the hallway illuminating the rumpled and empty bed.
"Probably," admitted Harry, without caring one way or the other how Malfoy felt about that.
Malfoy rolled onto his back, pulling Harry on top of him and rolling his hips up. Harry gasped, a surge of lust rushing through him at the contrast of the vulnerability of Malfoy's body beneath his own, yet the strength of the man's grip on Harry's biceps.
"Ten minutes," said Harry encouragingly. "It says ten minutes to the nurse, then we might be able to find a seat."
"No."
"It's been a while," said Harry. "I s'pose you'll just have to give it a go."
He waited patiently, his stance open and welcoming as Malfoy leaned in and pressed a ghost of a kiss against Harry's lips, its tentative nature making it clear it was a request for permission. Even that soft touch of cool lips was enough to send Harry's blood rushing south and he was more than ready when Malfoy closed the remaining gap between them, fastened his hands on Harry's hips and kissed him again.
"Is pasty. Be getting more sun," the gnome noted.
"Whatever the reason, I think you probably know more about each other than you think you do."
"Clothes," muttered Potter, obviously discomfited. "You're all..."
"You were...what? You were taking Malfoy a cold drink? Malfoy of the endless mudblood comments?"
"Thank you," he said quietly. At this rate he would never be able to repay his debts to her.
They'd found something, he thought bitterly. Something that wasn't in his favour. What were the odds of that when this business had nothing to do with him? It was just his luck really.
"Yeah, of course."
"It feels like it's getting stuck," he muttered.
They lay there a while, Potter's hand stroking his hair and Draco's fingers twisted into Potter's t-shirt as something inside him gradually unclenched. He found there were tears in his eyes and closed his eyelids, hoping Potter wouldn't notice, but the treacherous drops slipped down the sides of his face and ran cold into his ears and hair.
"You're serious? Typical. I thought I'd got rid of the worst of the dark magic in this place, but even the plates are poisonous. Depulso!"
"Eh?" said Harry, belatedly translating wizarding to muggle. "Oh, penny! Er, nothing...just thinking, you know."
"I know."
He twitched the curtain into place and moved on to the next cubicle.
"Oh," said Harry.
Enough was enough. Hoping he didn't splinch himself, he disapparated with a flourish.
The vase shot into the air and exploded as it hit the ceiling, glass shards tinkling down onto the table top in a translucent shower.
Draco froze, his dick swelling immediately and pressing against the warm body beneath him. Potter gasped, a puff of breath warm against Draco's face as his hips responded with a slow, upwards grind.
"Malfoy didn't do anything," repeated Harry in a cold voice. "Do you really think I can't protect myself against a Malfoy?"
Potter slammed and locked the door before gathering Draco into his arms. Draco stood there, tense and bewildered and chilled to the bone.
He cast a cautious healing charm over the bruises on his face and neck, grateful that a largely sleepless night had given him ample time to practise wandless charms, then went down to the kitchen, his jacket slung over one shoulder and sleeves pushed up far enough that the Dark Mark on his arm was clearly visible. He was not going to pretend to be something he wasn't.
Potter's hands curled into fists, a scowl twisting his dark eyebrows.
"It was Malfoy," he repeated, doubt creeping into his tone.
"Umm?" Potter looked briefly bemused, but then added, "How do you do that?"
"I'm going to make you come," Harry repeated firmly, his own balls clenching at the way Malfoy gasped and ran a tongue over his lips. His cock lay heavy in Harry's hand, twitching, leaking as Harry dragged his thumb over the head.
Harry jumped, torn out of his thoughts.
Harry straightened his shoulders, suddenly conscious that the other man was a few inches taller.
Malfoy reached out and brushed some hair out of Harry's eyes with his elegant fingers.
"I can't..." Malfoy yelled over the shriek of the wind, his hair blowing around his white face as he stumbled backwards into the wall.
He poked his victim none too gently with the toe of his shoe and added in a venemous tone, "And now you pay!"
Harry gestured at the wand and only then did Malfoy seem to realise it was smoking. He let it fall with a curse.
On the far side of the room, Hermione mixed and measured potions at Madam Pomfrey's request. Harry recognised those for shock, blood loss, bone repair and infection but there were numerous others.
"Make yourself at home."
The words did not have the customary Malfoy sting. In fact, the pull at the corner of his mouth and the angle of his shoulders were sure indications that he was both in pain and finding it difficult to hold himself together. It occurred to Harry that he should be surprised he could tell so much just by looking at Malfoy, but then he remembered the years of close observation of possibly nefarious activities and put the uncomfortable thought away.
Harry stared at her, remembering a haggard Malfoy sitting on the edge of the chair at his hearing, jaw clenched and hands clasped tight in a vain attempt to stop them trembling. At the time he'd thought it was nerves, but maybe it had been more than that? Or maybe he was just trying to find excuses for Malfoy.
Once dressed, Draco cleaned his teeth with a charm, dragged his fingers through his hair, snagged a pale brown jacket from a hanger and left without even glancing in the rather shocked mirror.
Now, Draco moved cautiously along the street, not sure if he'd shaken off his pursuers. It was becoming more frequent, this deadly dance of pursuit and threat. Day by day it wore him down, stress chipping away at his fragile defences and combining with the exhaustion of nightmare-ridden nights to drag him ever deeper into despair. He had no real means to protect himself, not with his wand seized and a ministerial ban against his use of magic. So Draco slipped through the night, avoiding the circles of light beneath the street lamps, feeling alone and vulnerable, no longer sure why he was bothering to run from a fate that seemed inevitable.
The words, spoken aloud without intention, seemed to open the floodgates and a surge of panic and fear flowed over him from...the house? No, not the house, he realised; the feelings were being transmitted by Grimmauld Place but had originated with Malfoy.
Harry answered with a swift wandless spell that both locked the door and set privacy wards. Seconds later they were prostrate on a transfigured white rug, kissing with a slow desperation as Harry undid Malfoy's jeans and pushed up his soft jumper until he could kiss and nip at his cool, smooth skin.
"I've never seen that curse before. It hasn't even marked your jacket. Are you sure you feel alright?"
He paused, looking a bit surprised at his own statement and then nodded.
The face before him went very still as Malfoy processed that statement, then to Harry's surprise he gave Harry a light punch in the chest.
"Maybe you're trying too hard? Something must be happening."
"It could've happened with anyone then?"
"Not really, well yes, I suppose. We've known each other since we were eleven. We went to school together."
Cont...
"I do want you to see Pomfrey though before we go."
His fingers picked idly at tiny, loose threads on the the duvet.
"Umm yes," Potter agreed, his gaze travelling up and down Draco's form in a startled way, without appearing to pause on the Dark Mark at all. He suddenly seemed to realise what he was doing and turned back to the sizzling pan as a red flush spread over his face.
"After you'd seen how I reacted when you dumped me in the middle of a warehouse?" said Malfoy shrewdly. "How very Slytherin of you."
"And what happens if we don't catch them? I can't see that doing the Minister's popularity much good. And the public will probably blame Malfoy."
In mute answer, Draco straightened and proffered his forearm, his heart giving an unwelcome twinge when Potter's warm fingers brushed briefly against his own as he took hold of it.
"Did I hurt you?"
The other man's thoughts on the matter remained unknown, as the Floo roared into life and spat out Ron and Hermione, wands drawn.
"Malfoy?"
"Look," he snapped defensively. "Things got all turned around in sixth year and I know you didn't hand me over to Voldemort when you could've done, but it's hard to just dismiss all the things you did before that!"
"I think that would be a good idea." Then she added carefully, "You two seemed to be getting on better?"
He studied Harry's expression for a moment, then added, "I read the labels. I'm familiar with the pharmaceutical ingredients; I've had to do a fair bit of research over the last few years."
Funnily enough, even the embarrassment was worth the way Malfoy's lips curled up. Harry resolved right there and then to make him smile more often. Bad choices in his past or not, spending a night in the man's nightmares had made him reconsider some of his own assumptions.
Cont...
In the meantime the man appeared to be asleep, the golden curve of his lashes resting on unnaturally flushed cheekbones. Harry laid a tentative hand on his forehead, finding it hot and dry, his immediate concern mingling with surprise at the tingle of magic that prickled under the pads of his fingers. It reminded him of Hogwarts and the unexpectedly sharp sting of Malfoy's hexes. He pulled his hand away quickly and rubbed it down the side of his trousers with a frown. Nothing had ever been simple as far as Malfoy was concerned.
Draco lifted his chin against the whispered tide of resentment and made sure his best sneer was firmly in place as he followed Potter's confident stride between the desks of the scroll-keepers. Despite the icy exterior he presented, the palpable waves of hatred made him feel nauseated and his heart pounded painfully as he stalked disdainfully along. It was a good thing they'd taken advantage of an early start and apparated to his flat to transport his clothes and personal possessions to Grimmauld Place. At least his expensively tailored suit and highly polished shoes were an armour of professionalism and good breeding, which was more than could be said for Potter's outfit of tatty converse and auror's robe, thrown untidily over jeans and hoodie. Not that the other man needed armour, being the beloved hero of the wizarding world. Besides, thought Draco wryly, Potter's scruffy appearance was undeniably appealing and did nothing to detract from the aura of sheer power that surrounded the man.
Potter's arm was around him and he was leading him away and then the door closed behind them and the hallway was dim and empty.
Being in close quarters brings all sorts of angst in the next chapter.
Those sharp black eyes were as keen as ever, even if now they were just paint on oilskin. Draco felt a flush rise over his cheekbones. He sat rather abruptly in the chair.
"Fuck! Merlin..."
"Course. I'll see you in the morning. Oh, and Ron, thank Hermione for me, will you?"
Whatever it was, Potter clearly wasn't going to repeat it, although the firm pressure of his knee remained. After a moment, Draco excused himself and fled to the safety of the basic toilet until the warm heat in his cheeks subsided.
They shuffled forward another few paces, Malfoy's weight increasing incrementally at each step. There was only one person left in front of them in the queue and that was a good thing, thought Harry, not sure how much longer he'd be able to keep Malfoy upright as casting a spell was out of the question.
The shorter man took a few hesitant steps away, noting "They're all locked up in Azkaban."
"I'm sorry about this."
No, of course Draco didn't mind, even if the thought of a flushed and gently perspiring Potter did funny things to his gut. He strode behind him to the auror gym, glad to see that the majority of workers had left the building for the day. Even so, the occasional venemous look or comment meant he was wound as tight as a spring by the time they arrived. Potter glanced at him out of the corner of his eye and seemed to read his mood.
Draco wanted to stand up and storm out with a cutting reply, but he really had no choice but to stay. He bit the inside of his cheek bloody and kept his gaze fixed on Weasley until he flushed and turned away. It was a small victory of sorts, but on top of everything else it left him feeling drained and depressed. Not for the first time he wondered if the deal had been worth it. If he'd declined, by now he'd be dead and all the shit would be over.
"Malfoy?"
"Are you involved in something? Is that why you're here?"
"Tomorrow?" Harry repeated, for the third time. "He's not up to it."
The muscle along Malfoy's jaw clenched and for a moment Harry thought he would refuse, then he held out his hand and let Harry drop the wand across it.
Draco's breath hitched and he bit down hard on the inside of his cheek, trying to get back some semblance of control. Potter didn't move, giving him time, not saying anything, just standing there, solid and safe.
Harry followed him, sending a quick patronus to Ron to let him know that they were alright and that he'd meet him later to explain.
It was as though someone had poured cold water down his spine. He felt his face go white.
Harry waited, slouching casually against a damp wall and wishing he'd brought some extendible ears along. George would be ashamed of him.
"Ugh."
"Move Potter," he said. "Fuck me, please."
Malfoy moaned then, arching his back, eyes rolling up as he cried out, spurts of come coating their bellies and chests. His arse muscles spasmed violently and with a hoarse cry Harry jerked and shuddered his release into him in orgasm, the waves of intensity nearly making him pass out.
Draco pressed his forearm against his mouth, stifling the cry he needed to make. He shifted his stance, open, wanting, needing.
He turned on his heel and strode out of the room.
Harry glanced through the door, surprised to see Malfoy sitting on the path with his face turned up to the sun. His eyes were closed, there was an unexpected splodge of mud on his chest and his feet were bare, something about the long, shapely bones strangely erotic. Harry turned away quickly, attraction battling with shame. He vowed never to let his guard down around Malfoy again.
"They saw through the glamour?"
Harry's gaze lingered on the other man's face, taking in the stronger bones and light stubble of the adult Malfoy. It was, he supposed, an attractive face, something he'd failed to notice at Hogwarts, although a fair proportion of other students had carried a flame for the young pureblood. Perhaps it was the Slytherin's eyes that had made him so fascinating, the way they seemed to change colour with his mood and the light.
"My training?" A bitter laugh burst from Draco's lips. "My training put me in Azkaban!"
Malfoy seemed to deflate, exuding a weariness that Harry could feel without any physical connection at all. Without thinking he stepped over and held out his hand.
"It means something to me," he admitted quietly, squaring his shoulders and stepping forwards slowly until he was close enough that Harry could feel the unique thrum of his magic.
Now why had he admitted that, to Malfoy of all people? To his surprise there was a response.
"There were a large number of insulting remarks made yesterday. It was a long day. I didn't feel like listening to any more. I didn't fight a war to put up with that sort of behaviour."
"Well, that's alright then. Good for Malfoy."
"I'd like that." Draco tried out a shaky smile and saw Snape's forehead furrow in a frown.
Draco snorted. "You want to punch me? Wasn't Hogwarts enough for you?"
"It's a good start," said Harry. "We've seized enough illegal goods to lock up Romani and a few others, but we still need to prove they've been tampering with potions brewed by Crowfoot, Dangelos and Smithson."
More soon (with smoochy bits) I promise :)
"What?"
"No." Harry instinctively tightened his grip on the smooth flesh of the other man's waist.
Draco shut his eyes. "Do fuck off, will you?"
Draco swallowed, choked by the unexpected openness of Snape's concern. He nodded.
Harry shrugged. Everything had been a mess, was still a mess, would quite possibly always be a mess.
"Not just a hat rack then, Potter. Not that you'd get a hat to fit that bed hair."
"Clothes," murmured Malfoy, a question in the arch of his eyebrow.
"Sorry, I...sorry...I didn't mean..."
It was a gesture that had occurred over and over again as they'd fought their way through Malfoy's delirium, so familiar that Malfoy took his hand without hesitation and allowed Harry to pull him upright. As their skin connected for the first time since Hermione had asked Harry to let go of Malfoy's hand, there was a jolt of vivid sensation, coupled with a tremendous and audible crackle of energy. They both knew immediately that Malfoy was
Draco's balls clenched, his back arching as sensation built and built until it exploded and he came, shuddering and crying out with Potter following immediately, shooting hot and deep into him. Then Potter's hand was on his cock, the pad of his thumb sliding over the super-sensitised tip.
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, felt the scald of a tear spilling down his cheek, then another. He was so afraid. He had Ron and Hermione, Luna and Neville and other friends. The Weasley's had even remained his surrogate family despite his split with Ginny, but this thing with Malfoy was different, more intense, more personal, just him and Malfoy. To let it go further would mean admitting to himself that he had feelings for Malfoy. He would have to let the man in so close that any subsequent split or betrayal would be horribly painful, the sort of pain he wasn't sure he could go through again.
"We wouldn't have just had a breakthrough on the potions case." Harry informed him.
"Are you feeling okay," enquired Harry in disbelief. "You hate each other."
"Oh, yeah, right. Of course."
For some reason Harry found the thought of Malfoy dying inexplicably distressing and after a while he shuffled down the mattress a little way until he could take hold of the cold, elegant fingers. The flow of magical energy beneath his fingertips was fading rapidly as the other man slipped inexorably away. Harry gathered himself with an effort and concentrated on pushing a steady flow of his own magic through the strangely intimate joining of their hands.
It was over, he thought, a fitting finale to his worthless life. It had all been a fucking waste of time after all. He supposed that at the end at least he was with someone who knew his name and was trying to help him. He thought it was probably more than he deserved.
"Oh Harry," interjected Hermione. "No wonder you're so exhausted. Come on, sit down. Have your tea and toast and then you can get some sleep."
Potter flushed and dragged his fingers through his wayward hair.
"I got your patronus about the same time a message came through about a blast at The Hag's Skeleton."
He realised belatedly that he was still holding Malfoy's hand in his own and hurriedly untangled their fingers. He rolled off the mattress onto his knees.
Draco moaned, balls drawing up in anticipation. His magic surged in response and suddenly Potter was naked, his clothes in a heap on the floor and his eyes huge with surprise as a startled sound burst from his lips.
"Potter...I, don't..."
Draco trailed after them, stepping through a flutter of premature fallen leaves, the first he'd seen that season. Autumn was coming, the summer months lost in a blur of anxiety and fear and the winter now not far ahead. The year was spiralling down, he thought, rather like his life.
"You know," he said slowly, "you're the only person who doesn't treat me like I'm going to break or like I'm some big celebrity."
"I'll look into it immediately," promised Madam Pomfrey. "I believe you have a copy of some of the more obscure medical texts, Miss Granger?"
More a case of when, thought Harry wryly. It reminded him of another issue.
Ahead of him lay one of the civic buildings that were common in that area of the city. It was closed for the night and shrouded in darkness apart from the artfully angled pools of light that illuminated fancy curlicues of stone and pillars carved in the style of Ancient Greece. The shadows that lay between and behind the pillars were dense and it was to these that Draco headed. If he could reach the far side of the building, it would be possible to cut across the dark swathe of grass that lay at its rear, scale a low wall and lose his pursuers in the rabbit warren of streets beyond.
"Well, I hope it does," said Malfoy. "Because otherwise I'll be back in Azkaban."
Many hugs to you for reading and especially for the kudos and comments!
Harry waved his hand in a truncated spell-like motion.
Potter leaned down and kissed him, soft and gentle, summoned Draco's jumper to cover him and held him closer. Draco kissed him back with a sense of impending doom. The feelings he had for Potter were so far beyond friendship. He was so very fucked.
He burst into the office at some speed and came to an abrupt halt. Malfoy was seated behind Harry's desk with a disdainful expression on his face. He'd obviously taken the time to visit Grimmauld Place himself as he was now wearing a dark blue jumper under his leather jacket. It deepened the colour of his grey eyes so they looked stormy and troubled.
He waited, letting Malfoy make the play, contenting himself with the slide of his hands over the long planes of Malfoy's back, the bone-deep pleasure of his weight lying between Harry's thighs.
There was no answer but a small whisper of sound drew Harry's attention to the wall on the far side of the bed. He sent a wordless lumos at the lamp and saw that Malfoy was huddled at the foot of the wall, his knees drawn loosely up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them.
Harry was fuming at the easy dismissal of the situation, angry enough that a quill on Robards' desk began to tremble and quake behind his back. He wanted to shout and rant, but knew it would be counter-productive and would somehow make Malfoy's theory less acceptable. He fought instead for control, mildly shocked when Malfoy stepped forwards casually, his knuckles brushing against Harry's and transmitting a cool stream of reassurance. It allowed him to regain just enough balance to calm his roiling magic and Harry swallowed, taking a deep breath, the quill settling back against the desk.
"Doesn't this blow my cover?" Malfoy enquired in an icy tone.
"I don't," said Harry sharply. "You need help Draco. You're not going to be able to get there by yourself."
He looked with disinterest through his clothing, now tidily hanging in the dark interior of the heavy wooden wardrobe in his bedroom. He selected trousers and shoes with an uncharacteristic lack of interest and it was more luck than judgement that they were both in the brown spectrum. The thick cream sweater more a reaction to the shiver that ran down his backbone and the fine golden hairs standing upright on his forearms than any statement of style.
Without warning, his way was blocked by a flare of light he dimly recognised as that produced by a protego charm. He bounced off it and fell sideways into someone who let out a winded gasp.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Mr Malfoy is a free man," stated Potter, so loudly that Draco suspected a wandless sonorous charm. "I'm delighted he's agreed to contribute his expertise to assist the aurors."
Potter seemed to read the change, or perhaps some inkling of it was transmitted between their skin. Whatever the reason, his movements became more focussed, his hand closing around Draco as his teeth caught at his throat. Then a firm hand had turned him onto his side, fingers spreading across the flat muscles of Draco's stomach and pulling him back against Potter's body. Potter was erect again, hard flesh sliding in the slick of Draco's crack and Draco pushed his hips back, raising one thigh, feeling the blunt end of Potter's cock rubbing tantalisingly over his entrance before pushing back inside.
Cont...
"Let me make myself clear; I don't like your sort and I don't trust you; I'd just as soon throw you back into Azkaban..."
"Well, perhaps it's time you had a chat? Surely he'll see sense, if it means the terms of his probation are improved?"
"Well if you change your mind..."
She offered a brief smile to Harry and was gone.
She raised her head, a frown pulling at her forehead.
"I said bed rest, Mr Malfoy."
"Malfoy?"
"You did the right thing."
Beside him the faces of Weasley and Potter showed nostalgia, sorrow and pride, but Draco knew his own showed only guilt. He stared at Potter with a feeling of helpless anguish; there was nothing Draco could do to put right what he'd done in the past, but he had to help Potter finish this case and justify Potter's trust in him. He couldn't believe he'd entertained the idea that there might be a future of some sort for the two of them. Potter was worth a hundred of him and the man would soon realise his error.
It all made perfect sense, but why had a team of experienced Aurors missed it. Harry said as much.
Nothing but the hum of traffic and the cool night air chill upon his skin. He raised himself enough to look around but there was no-one there, just the dark shadows behind the stone pillars where he lay. He remembered trying to reach them, then...nothing.
Thanks for reading! Really appreciate the kudos and comments x
"You're talking to someone who had Bellatrix as an aunt. And then of course there's my father...but the less said about him the better."
"Yeah," he said, knowing his voice slurred with exhaustion and not caring. All he wanted to do was lie down in a dark room and sleep forever. All things considered, he wasn't too bothered if he woke up or not.
"You're letting them win," snapped Harry.
"Let him go, Ron. He's helping in an investigation."
They sipped in silence and by the time the mugs of tea and half the packet of biscuits had gone it was apparent that Malfoy was struggling to stay awake.
"In that case I have prepared the information you require."
"Are you OK, mate?"
"Hey, it's only me. Sorry." Potter looked startled, drawing back. "We're here."
"Now," she continued. "I was wondering if the same was true in reverse?"
"He saw what he expected to," replied Draco, somehow managing to keep his tone and face devoid of expression.
Draco nodded and her hand took his elbow. The strength of her magic surprised him, although he didn't know why. Much to his aggravation she'd regularly exceeded his marks at school and she was a member of the Golden Trio after all. He supposed he'd thought her main strengths were academic rather than physical, notwithstanding her right hook. He hoped his sense of genuine surprise wasn't a left-over from his upbringing and the repetitive message that muggle-borns were magically inferior.
The longer he looked at the man the more he could tell that the injuries were not superficial. The light breeze stirring Malfoy's blond hair revealed that there were clumps that appeared to be matted together with blood and his stance was all wrong, devoid of its normal grace and confidence, seeming instead taut and unsteady.
The sweat and mess might be gone, but his hair and clothes were
