Teddy nodded and quickly put the yo-yo aside. He wouldn't risk losing his new toy the first day.
“You’re done?” Harry asked.
A little bored Teddy asked, “Can we go to Hermione now? I want cake.”
Teddy’s eyes and nose were red from sobbing. Draco handed him a tissue and they apparated to Hermione.
Hermione agreed, adding, “Careful with her head.”
“That’s not answering my question,” Draco sighed.
Harry nodded and quickly checked his looks in the mirror one last time. The white suit fitted him perfectly, being, like Draco’s, tailed onto him. The golden bow-tie was thanks to the blond also done and his hair was no mess. He quickly fixed the red and white Amaryllis in his chest pocket, then grabbed Draco’s hand and they left the room.
Teddy nodded excited and quickly packed all his stuff in his bag. Meanwhile the young woman stood up and walked towards the parent.
“Yeah, it’s awesome,” said Teddy joyful. “I’m gonna take my book to Granny Dromeda and show her all my drawings. And my workbook from school. She’ll be amazed by my writing skills.”
He gazed very confused at her and she explained, that the Jarvey had jumped onto his lap and he usually would never did that. That was a little comforting for Draco but it probably also meant that the thing would come at him more often in the next days.
Draco had no interest in fighting about something so irrelevant and therefore said, “Well, books are always nice.”
“Don’t you dare jumping onto the table,” he said warningly to Kelly.
Draco blushed, “How do you…?” He glanced to Harry, “Harry!?”
Smiling Harry put his hand on Draco’s and kissed the inside of his wrist, “Yes, I understand. I’m very proud of you. My beautiful, brave Angel.”
“Apparently,” she had replied. “The saddest thing about today though is, that I was asked like ten times, what my ‘
“I know,” the boy muttered. “But the lights confused me. I wanted to see what was going on and so did Kelly.”
“Now you’re putting me in jeopardy,” he muttered.
“Why do you want to talk about my private life?” he asked slightly aggressive.
“Yes, we are,” answered Hermione’s mother. “I’m Jean, that’s Richard. But… Draco Malfoy… Honey, doesn’t this name sound familiar?”
“So… what’s up next for you?” Ms Grindal asked while adding small black spots to the tiger lily.
When Josephine had entered her department the following day, Draco had already been there, waiting for her and seeing the reaction of all of her colleagues had been worth it all.
“Mainly about you,” Draco answered. “You were her longest relationship. Ever since than nothing held more than two to six months.”
“Of course,” Harry said. “We all have something small for you.”
Mallard smirked, “So you wanna take
About twenty minutes later Harry called for dinner. While eating, Draco asked something he had been thinking about for the last hour or so.
“You’re right. It’s not Pansy,” the blond agreed. “How did you know? Are you dating her?”
The blond walked down the halls to the lift and drove down to level 4 on which the owlery was. After giving away the letter he returned to his office, picked up all his stuff and left the ministry. He apparated to the school. He was a bit early and as he didn’t find the mother’s of Teddy’s friends Mora and Tylor, he walked to Teddys classroom. Maybe he could talk to his teacher again. With the ringing of the bell all the children ran out the classroom, except for Teddy. His friends were the last to leave and greeted Draco as they passed him. Mrs Andrews stepped out the classroom after them and twitched surprised as she saw the young man.
“Family reasons,” he just answered.
“Thank you,” muttered Draco and kept reading.
“So how is parenthood?” asked Harry, being the only one to have never really handled a baby.
They stayed for a cup of tea before Draco and Hermione had to leave to pick Teddy up from school.
“Yes, contrary to Harry and Ron I actually listen when you tell us about your science experiments. Thank you very much for your help, Hermione,” he said, about to hang up.
“Andromeda, nice to see you,” he greeted her.
“I don’t know,” admitted the Blond. “We have the dinner, the house to ourselves… What else do you wanna do?”
~~~oOo~~~
Draco confused looked over to the young woman. She was a tad smaller than him, her short hair tied back to a ponytail similar to the way he had it. Her ripped jeans, the expensive white sneakers and the washed out tank top she wore under her bomber-jacket made her perfectly blend in with the young muggles on the streets of New York, but she didn’t really look like an authority figure.
To Harry’s surprise, Kingsley wasn’t saying anything new about the Zabini-Jorgenson case. Ron and a few other Aurors would be giving testimony at the Wizengamot within the hour. Harry knew every detail, and hearing it again made him stifle a yawn. As far as he was concerned it was a nailed-shut case. His mind began to drift to the previous hour's activity. He came back to attention when Kingsley mentioned Draco’s name. Draco, Barrister Malfoy, Harry’s spouse, was representing Blaise Zabini. Sometimes, when a day was slow, Harry would slip down to the basement floors and watch Draco perform his job. He would tingle with both pride and anticipation of what the night would bring if Draco won. Draco usually won. But not today.
"You could have just told me in the first place."
"Uh oh, I guess this is it," Draco said and reached for the bottle of wine.  The two young boys on the lakes shore reclined on the blanket after eating copious amounts of sandwiches and fruits and glasses of bubbleberry cold tea.  Their pinkie fingers met and intertwined.  Neither acknowledged it with words, they continued to talk about Quidditch teams, and future careers.  Harry admitted that his goal was to be an Auror.  Draco said he just wanted to be rich and travel.  The young Harry laughed as did the older one.  While Draco was rich in both, this world he worked at the Ministry as a tax accountant.
Harry laughed. "That could be happening too."
"Harry, everything okay?" Teddy asked.
"Normally I would agree, Harry, but remember what you saw."
To his amazement the floor of the birdcage began to swirl.  He hoped it was like a Pensieve but it wasn't.  He viewed a scene from above as if he was a bird.  Below was one scene and unfortunately it was too hazy to see exactly what was going on, but he could make out that it was of him and Draco and they were very young.  It was at Hogwarts and they were running down to the dungeons laughing, holding hands.  They reached the Slytherin Common Room door and then Harry disappeared, a cat was in his place.  Draco picked up the cat and nuzzled into its fur. The scene got even fuzzier and then turned black, but Draco's voice rang out.  "Love you, Harry."
He came out of his thoughts when Draco reached over, grabbed his hand and squeezed it.
Draco thinned his lips and appeared to be thinking hard. Harry wondered about what. He certainly didn’t expect Draco Malfoy to say it back. "Don’t say it again, Potter. I might start believing it."
"Come on, Potter, it’s been eight hours and you know you want to fuck me. You need to fuck me. Isn’t that what you were thinking about forty-five minutes ago?"
"Or maybe it isn’t, and Harry moved out and forgot to set his alarm," Ron said, a little too hopefully. Harry noted that Ron winced when his blue eyes scanned Harry’s appearance. Harry didn’t respond but instead took his seat at the head of his conference table opposite the Minister. He waited for what Kingsley had to say. Kingsley rarely addressed Harry’s team.
"Fine, but at least come sit with me and indulge in one quick drink."
"No, Malfoy, it won’t all be fine. The community will want my hide, as well as they should. I let this happen because I was too busy fucking you!"
"How can I help?" he asked.
"Harry," Dumbledore said softly as Harry approached him and looked up with a sad smile.  "Harry, my boy, if she lived, so many more would have died by not only Gellert's hand but my own."
"Love you," Harry mouthed as their lips met.
"Can I see?" Teddy asked, standing on his tip-toes trying to see the written words.
In a secret room, Kendra Dumbledore magically painted the owl with her hopes and dreams.  Each layer of colour aged the bird; the burden of the Dark magic was heavy.  She was so absorbed in her work she didn't see that her daughter, Ariana, had found her and tried the same spell on her.  Ariana only wanted to see her mother in those beautiful colours.  Kendra left the world and would never return in either timeline.
Draco raised his hand; his pointing finger touched Harry on the forehead poking him.  "You're lying.  I know it's your father, your Mudblood mother and the blood traitor Sirius Black.  Oh, and another," he said and began to sniff the stale air.  He began to laugh.  "Oh, Harry, going to be saved by a werewolf are you? Remus Lupin is a puppy compared to the werewolves I've known.  It doesn't matter though; they will never see another day."  Then Draco hissed out words and sounds that were incomprehensible to Harry.  Something was happening.
Harry winced as he saw Remus' body covering Sirius and his father holding his mother.  Harry curled up between them and sobbed.  He barely noticed when Fawkes returned and carried him through tunnels and away from the school and over land.  It was only when they reached his doorstep in Godric's Hollow that Fawkes released his hold.  The bird gave a trill and disappeared in a puff of smoke.  The front door opened.
Dumbledore's eyes narrowed as he examined the bird from side to side.  Gently, he nudged it to rise up.  A quick smile crossed his face and with his wand he removed a piece of paper beneath the bird.  He unfolded it and a green owl feather floated away from it.  Dumbledore reached out and caught it.
Dumbledore raised his hand, silencing Harry in midstream of his verbal tirade.
Harry agreed, knowing in the back of his mind that sitting next to Draco and having alcohol could very well lead to at least an hour of sex. He walked back over to Draco and sat down on the sofa. Draco smiled and handed a glass of scotch to Harry. "Drink first. You’re going to need it."
Magical rope emerged from Draco's wand and bound Harry to the statue of Salazar Slytherin.  Harry tried to move but it was futile.  If prophecies were to be believed then he knew at this point that it was likely he would be the one to die. "Harry, I am not stupid and neither is your Draco.  You don't want to help me, but, you will.  You will with your blood.  Harry didn't anticipate what happened next; Draco's wand-tip touched Harry on his forehead and made a mark.  Harry felt his skin slice open and release blood so quickly his vision was blurred.
"Oh shit," Harry said.  "I only guessed that Teddy really might have done this before."
Harry shook his head. "Excuse me, but did I miss something? What new situation?"
Draco rolled his eyes.  "Really, Potter, we're seventh years.  I think it's time we move on.  Grow up."
"Just barely," Harry responded.  His mother entered the room shutting the door behind her but not before a very large grey tabby cat snuck in.  It promptly raced across the room and jumped up on Harry's bed and began purring as it stepped up on his chest looking for morning pets.  Harry obliged.
Harry
The wind blew open the balcony's French doors and whipped through the room; the violet curtains billowed. Lightning lit up the sky outside and in, and then thunder shook the window panes. Only magic kept them from shattering. The chandelier flames held still. Harry saw it all out of his periphery. His main focus was on Draco straddling him, riding his cock, his face contorted with bliss. Harry was drained - he wouldn’t be coming again tonight - but still he remained hard. Draco wanted him, needed him, and Harry's body responded. He reached up with his right hand and grasped Draco around the back of the neck, then pulled him down. He wanted a kiss.
Harry thinned his lips and shook his head, knowing that Teddy had broken the terms of his profession, but, also, that it wouldn't go anywhere beyond this room.  He would never turn his godson in.  Harry wanted to discuss it more as he'd found over the years that so many mysterious items or occurrences were caused by old magic spells, many Dark, which had long been forgotten.  They weren't taught anymore.  Instead of pursuing the conversation further, though, he turned his attention back to the scroll.  He lifted a letter opener from his desk and sliced open the deep red-waxed seal.  He unrolled the parchment and immediately furrowed his brow as a small blue feather floated out.  Harry caught it without looking.  His attention was focused on the letter.
"Who's that?" Draco asked as they watched a young curly-blond haired man inspect a room Harry recognised as belonging in the Department of Mysteries.  They could hear the cacophony of the ticking clocks which covered most every open space of the room but the case holding Time-Turners.  Harry looked to the far end of the room to see if the bell jar with the hummingbird was there, he was surprised to see something else there sitting next to the jar on the desk.  It was a golden cage with a large nest made of twigs.  There was an owl in it.  It looked ancient and mottled in colours as if a toddler had painted it.
"If you have a question, just ask and it may be revealed.  But you must be prepared for the worst."
Dumbledore shook his head.  "An even longer story.  But as you know from your parents and Prudence that Voldemort's real name is Tom Riddle and he's a direct descendent of Salazar Slytherin.  The locket belonged to his mother.  There was also a ring, which was the second Horcrux and it belonged to his grandfather.  Both of these family members Tom didn't know as he was raised in an orphanage as his mother died soon after giving birth.  Tom later met up with his grandfather and murdered him."
"Well there is something good about them not being part of our world," Sirius said.  "I remember my parents sending me a disguised dungbomb for Christmas the year I ran away."
A small azure-blue owl swooped into the courtroom and over the Minister's head.  It landed on Harry Potter's shoulder.
Harry's mother crossed her arms and continued with her stare but obviously had acquiesced to Dumbledore's statement.
Draco snickered. "Um, Potter, you know the Wizengamot is sealed while in session. And immediately afterwards, Ron was foaming at the mouth to tell you, but I had asked Kingsley before the trial to let me be the one to tell you."
"Is that what I think it is, Albus?" McGonagall whispered to him.
****************
"Sugar quills and fudge coming your way mate," Ron said as he flipped one of the Galleons Harry had given him and then left the room.  They both knew Harry had overpaid Ron, but as long as it wasn't seen as charity, neither said a word.  Ron would spend the extra at the Three Broomsticks buying a round of Butterbeers for all.
"Then Sirius would be dead," Lily said factually.  "And probably Bill Weasley, too."
"Do you think there's a fifth Horcrux?" Harry asked as he continued to softly pet the cat and play with its ears.
"Harry, the note you received from your
"Harry, wake up, breakfast and presents are waiting."
Dumbledore rose from his chair.  "We can discuss it later.  I must go.  You must find Sirius and Remus and tell them about Peter.  But please don't tell them where the information came from."
"Yes, of course.  No need to strain that relationship more than it has been recently.  Now go, Albus."
Ron didn't press the issue, which Harry was grateful for.  Everyone in the class knew Harry was struggling since he and Draco were no longer partners anymore and that Harry needed to do well to get into the Auror program.  Mad-Eye Moody was a frequent visitor to the Potter home and Harry a frequent visitor to the Ministry.  Gossip abounded as it wasn't often that a member of a well to do family would join such a plebeian group for that type of career.  Harry just ignored them.  He remembered that Draco thought it was a bit macho and seemed to like the idea.  He shook his head at the memory.
"She can't tell you, Harry, but I can."
Harry's eyes widened. "Seven?  I think I prefer this timeline."
"What brings you here on Christmas Eve, Potty—Potter?" Pansy Finnigan asked as she whisked past him with silver trays floating above her head filled with spirits and delectable starters.
Harry and Draco watched as Grindelwald opened the door of the cage and tried to reach in and take the owl.  It backed away and fluttered its wings, filling the cage.  Its talons came forward and tried to grab the wizard's arm but he wore a gauntlet.  With his other hand, Gellert reached in and petted the owl while it pecked at him.
Harry shook his head.  He knew from when he'd seen at the cage earlier that it probably meant his parents were alive but not until this moment did it truly hit him what his life would have been like.  As if it were a movie, his life played before him. He had a grandmother.  She'd been travelling afar looking for specialised ingredients for her business of selling potions and elixers.  She was also a gardener.
"Since we returned from our honeymoon in Paris. I noticed that I could sleep through the night until six. If you remember, we weren’t doing that early on."
~~o~~
"To ask me?" Pansy said, startling Harry as she appeared right next to him without her trays.  "I'm not sure besides ordering a drink or meal that you've ever said anything more than 'Congratulations Parkinson' on my wedding day and that was ten years ago."
~~o~~
"Yes, but I don't have a clue what it would be contained in," Lily said sounding apologetic.
"Who sent it, Albus?"
"No, not now.  Just want to enjoy what is left of my birthday.  Is that okay?"
"Merlin, Potter, I wasn't going to leave, I was just going to suggest that we go somewhere else to do this."
Harry nodded.  "It's your writing isn't it?  I drew the cage and Ds."
Draco sat on the foot stool, where Harry rested his feet. "No what, Potter?"
Harry snorted. "You know we don’t talk shop. It’s one of our rules."
Draco laughed. "It would be a challenge. And speaking of challenges…"
"No, sir, I'm taking it tomorrow," Harry replied.
"How long have you suspected?" Harry asked. He forced his voice to remain steady, not to disclose his feelings of hurt.
"Yes, that's the one.  Apparently, the Elder Wand wasn't the first thing he stole."
"Can I ask more than one question?" Harry asked.  While he wanted to know about him and Draco, he was apprehensive of asking that question right now, thinking that Dumbledore would expect something more serious.
Before either of them had a second thought, Lily added her wand tip to Dumbledore's and touched the hair.  She whispered a charm.  Names in golden script slowly appeared one letter at a time.  A rare gasp escaped from Dumbledore and a tear dropped from Lily's eyes.  Harry couldn't resist the temptation to look.  One named appeared at the top and two below, he knew immediately those below were the parents of this wizard named Teddy who claimed to be his godson.  He couldn't imagine how those two got together.  Bill Weasley and Tonks seemed like the perfect couple and nothing would break up Moony and Padfoot.
The owl flew out of her dungeon and into the town of Godric's Hollow.  She was spotted by another witch, an old witch who recognised what the colours on the owl meant. Bathilda bribed the owl with plump mice and captured her in a golden cage.  She was then brought to the Ministry where she lived in a room where Time had many dimensions.
Harry shook his head and laughed.  "No, Malfoy, I didn't consider going to your place.  We had to get out and I assume you have protection spells up."
Wide brown eyes stared at him in disbelief. "You’ve given up? But, Harry, you can fight off the Imperius. Just keep trying. I promise I’ll dedicate more time to researching the bond. The answer has to be at Hogwarts, given that's where it happened. And also, think of Cho and Andrew. From the start this has been all wrong, Harry. Love can’t be forced or manufactured."
They all turned to the voice of Nanna, not having heard her come into the kitchen.  With a gnarled finger she lifted an edge of the birdcage cover.  "And I see that this isn't the bird's first visit and that it's going to give Harry one chance to go to the timeline it came from."
"Did Draco say anything about it?"
The scene became blurry and then there were Grindelwald and a young Dumbledore in a room arguing and wands were drawn.  Harry saw Ariana come in and his hand reached out for Draco, knowing what was coming next; she was going to die and Harry would now know what Dumbledore never had, which one of them had killed her.  But, then something else happened —Grindelwald dropped his wand.  Apologies were made.
"Did you pass your Apparation test today?"  Dumbledore asked, changing the subject abruptly.
In the evening, Draco sat on the sofa and leaned onto Harry, looking through a cookbook by famous witch Endora Williams.
“This is mean,” Hermione retorted. “Maybe true, but still mean.”
on the chest.
“Totally,” she said with a wide grin.
birthday but also finally making their engagement official. Not that it was news to anyone at this point any more.
“And now excuse me,” she finished. “I’ll be back in three, maybe four days.”
In the end he cracked into a cheeky smile and Teddy realised that his uncle had made fun of him.
“Er… thank you…” Draco muttered.
Then the doors opened, Hermione walked outside, followed by Teddy and as soon as the music started, the grooms stepped out into the sunshine and towards the pavilion.
“Guys, can we eat?” asked Teddy a little inpatient.
“If it wasn’t for Teddy, I would have kicked Harry out the moment he had set foot in the manor,” he explained and lowered his gaze to the ring. He breathed out loud and stepped to the door, opening it, “I hope you can move on now.”
Draco kneeled in front of his rose bush in the garden. Disapprovingly, he eyed at the tall tiger lily that had planted itself last year. These lilies were late bloomers, usually blooming mid to late summer but this flower just seemed not to care about what other lilies did and the first of the big orange and black blossoms were already contending with Draco’s white roses for his attention.
~~~oOo~~~
As Teddy saw the house he had grown up in and had so many memories of, he laughed out loud and ran up the driveway. He
“By the way,” muttered Harry and shuffled around in his pocket, “Draco and I got something, we wanna show you.”
~~~oOo~~~
“Gotcha,” Harry agreed and changed the subject. “Is Ron gonna ask for a promotion now? He sure won’t go on Auror-missions any more, now that you’re pregnant.”
Kelly meowed again and sat down right in front of Draco, waiting patiently. After he had taken off the shoes he walked to the kitchen, Kelly with her tail upraised by his side.
“Oh just some germicide,” she explained. “The tattooing may have not hurt, but the colour is under your skin non the less and it is something like an open wound right now. The magic finishing will close up the wound a little but I give you a lotion to put on the tattoo for a week. After a week the tattoo is fully healed.”
“The frame I did on last Grandma-Day,” Teddy continued. “Granny and I visited Hogsmeade, because she needed something and we strolled around afterwards, had a look at Hogwarts and we collected all those pretty stones and made the frame. But Harry gave me the photograph.”
~~~oOo~~~
“Well, that’s my job, sir,” the blond man answered.
“Upon other reasons.”
“You’re upset,” Harry pointed out the obvious.
The blond had to hold back a chuckle, “Well, I do not fill the leader position myself. I work as the personal assistant of Gawain Robards.”
Harry came home a little late today. When he entered, a delicious smell filled his nose. Kelly came running to the door and greeted him with loud meows.
Shacklebolt. But I will be there and remind you of it if necessary.”
It took Draco a moment to realise what the other man had said, then muttered, “Right… Really? Is it already the fifth?”
Draco didn’t give it immediately. He didn’t know what to say.
Harry stepped closer to Draco and offered to hug him. Draco didn’t hesitate long and looped his one free arm – with which he wasn’t holding up Kelly – around the black haired man.
Ron just rolled his eyes and muttered to Hermione, “See, totally overshadowing our books.”
After changing in very casual cloths he returned in to garden. Harry and their guests had taken their seat around the table and waited for the person of honour.
“Nine days America,” he hissed. “This is like nine days more than I ever wanted to spend in this shithole that praises itself with being the greatest country in the world.”
Draco clawed in his left arm on which the dark mark was. The colour was faded. The mark was just a tattoo now.
He shook his head, pointing out, that he hadn’t met Harry yet.
“Yes! He’s a Metamorphmagus and he changes hair-colour all the time,” Mrs Andrews said. “But Draco Malfoy is his guardian. When Mr Malfoy finds out I lost his son… I mean nephew in the ministry, my reputation is gone!”
Having really nothing better to do with his time, Draco spend most of his evenings with Josephine, who showed him the city, the best restaurants – magic and no-maj – and even took him to a night club twice. Even though Draco usually never went to such mundane places like night clubs, he enjoyed it. The club was purely for wizards and witches and it was refreshing to
Robards and Draco thanked him and were left alone with Josephine.
After Teddy said good night, Harry carried him back to his own room and tugged him in again.
Teddy giggled, “Oh, that’s cool. Visiting Hermione and Ron! That’ll be fun.”
“Didn’t know the young Malfoy had a son,” Peasegood muttered.
Draco blushed a little and looked away but Harry just chuckled and replied, “We’re not married yet. Only engaged. The wedding will be… probably around autumn, or what do you say, Draco?”
“Recently I’m thinking about talking everything out with my father,” Draco muttered. “It drives me mad. I’m afraid of facing him and every time you leave for a mission, I’m afraid, that something like Peru happens again and you’re gone for weeks on end. I would ask you to quit, but I just know you would never, because you love you’re job and everything and… and…”
Curiously she had gazed at him. The cluelessness she had shown him had spawned a luxurious shopping trip the next day.
“When their parents are fine with it,” Draco simply said.
“He is,” Draco replied. “At least that’s what he tells me. I mean… we’re getting married soon.”
But a detective? Did he really look like one of those wannabe Sherlock Holmes cops from Scotland Yard? It seemed that way, though he wasn’t even wearing a trench coat.
Running towards Robards Draco got a good look at the Hungarian Horntail. It’s scales were black and bronze horns and spikes covered its body.
of February 2005. Only four days left to Valentine’s Day. Draco was nervous. Harry was not. It would be the third Valentine’s Day they spend together. Draco wanted to do something special this year. Two years ago, Harry had to go on a Mission and last year the 14
“Yeah…” she muttered. “We’ve dated for almost four years and he never asked me to marry him.”
“You’re welcome,” she said. “And you should really get yourself a cellphone, so we can text sometimes.”
“Do you have something special planned for tonight?” asked Andromeda and took a bite of the quiche.
“This is all from me,” Teddy said and placed the box on the corner of the table.
’,” Hermione explained. “I’ve heard they’re brilliant.”
“Goyle?” he suggested.
She shrugged and muttered, “Maybe, but at least I finally have a person to give it to. Since Fleur put it on my table after my engagement, it’s just dusting in the shelf. I originally wanted to give it to Ginny, but she just broke up with her boyfriend…”
“Patrick Glithac,” she said and just as Draco had explained it, the moving picture of the young wizard appeared. “That’s him,” she hummed and repeated yelling of joy, “That’s him! Amazing! I have to get my team! Here!” she pulled out her valet and forced it into his hands before running back to the Auror-Department. “Go drink a coffee or tea or whatever! I’ll get to you later after this is done!”
Draco nodded in agreement and put the girl down. She was still crying and called for her mom.
~~~~oOo~~~
~~~oOo~~~
Harry sat down next to him and asked about any other plans for Valentine’s Day.
Harry smiled to himself as the door cracked open wider and a large black owl glided in and then circled the room before landing on his desk. She had a message tied to her leg. Shelly, Draco’s owl, stood proudly as Harry untied the silver ribbon.
Teddy smiled.  It was his mother's free and generous smile but his brown eyes were his father's.  "You know I can't tell you the details.  I probably shouldn't say anything at all, but, I feel you need to know that I believe it came from another timeline."
"You have me," Draco said back.  His hand grasped tighter and the motion increased as Harry's breath quickened.  "You have me," Draco said again.  "Oh God, you have me."
"Usually no," Nanna said, "but I'm guessing Albus here has seen this little fowl before, right, Albus?"
Harry furrowed his brow as he thought about what he would write.  Then he came to a decision and set the breakfast tray aside and threw back the covers.  "I'll be back in a few minutes," he said as he put on his dressing gown and tightened the sash.  He opened the drawer of his bedside table and withdrew a scroll with a silver ribbon, his seal, and a quill.  Before his grandmother could say
"Now?" Draco whined. "But there’s a storm."
Harry’s heart leapt. He heard a tone of hope in Draco’s voice. Could he feel the same?
"Maybe I will have some bread and jam," Draco said, looking like he knew he'd lost the battle with the old witch and that he'd better stay on her good side.
"Sir, you said there were five you knew of, what were they and were you able to destroy them?"
My arse is sore.
Harry looked back at the note.  "Teddy, for me to have this note means someone sent a message to this time period.  Maybe you did send an owl after all."
Draco glared at him.  Harry could tell he was trying to control his temper.  "I was not implying anything of the kind, you tosser.  I was going to suggest maybe your bedroom.  You know it's not like we're young kids in Hogwarts.  We're adults and I, for one, would like to be comfortable while we have Christmas Eve sex."
Nanna cackled as she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.  "You sweet boy.  You will still have our love.  You will always have our love.  Remember what you told me what Dumbledore said about core things remaining.  We'll my favourite grandson, our love is central.  But you can wait if you like, until you're absolutely sure it's the right thing to do."
"Nanna, do you think I can get a message to myself in the other life?"
~~o~~
"Just need something to calm the nerves," Draco said.  The corners of his mouth turned up.  Harry kissed one corner and then walked away to retrieve some strong alcohol.
~~o~~
"Can you deliver a few messages, girl?" Teddy asked when she finished.  She swooped her head down low and then back up.  Harry could see from his point of view that Teddy was shaking.  He must have known how monumental it was what he was attempting to do.  It made Harry's heart ache for him.  He had tried to make his life whole but the emptiness must have been too much.  Another part of Harry, though, was furious that Teddy hadn't thought it through.
Draco’s hand reached up and grabbed Harry’s before he could pull it away from his hair. "Come on, Potter, you don’t have to leave now," Draco said as he took Harry’s hand and then placed it on the blanket covering his erection. Harry smiled and bent over and kissed Draco dryly on the lips.
~~o~~
"Merlin, what could have happened?" Lily whispered.
Draco laughed and handed the bottle over.
"He's over there," she said pointing to the table farthest away from the Muggle entrance.  Harry went up on his toes and could see Draco Malfoy sipping a drink by the fireplace.  He was alone.
The logs in the fireplace were crackling and spitting out embers. Harry hung his cloak on the coat rack by the hearth. He loved Draco’s office. He wasn’t sure if had he ever told him so. Draco’s carved ebony desk was without a speck of dust, and all papers were neatly stacked. Harry grinned as he noticed his note had been set on top.
"But…but…what about my six-in-the-morning fuck?"
"That is why I'm here, remember?"
"If you must," Draco said, removing Harry’s hands and standing up. He reached into his left trouser pocket and pulled out a small tube of lube. Then, with a quick shimmy of his hips, the trousers fell to the floor.
Harry barely listened to the remaining breakfast chatter; his eyes were focused on the gifts.  Without warning, another one appeared.  It was large and wrapped in green.  He smiled as the crack in the air brought his boyfriend to his side.  Sirius moved his chair closer to Remus and conjured another for Draco to sit down.
"Want to talk?" Draco asked.
"No, no, no, no," Harry mumbled repeatedly.
Dumbledore smiled.  "I don't think so, yet, but, now that we know that you survived in this other time, and that Voldemort did not, then we might get evidence that this is not the real timeline."
A small Harry was in Hogwarts train car with Ron and Neville.  They were relieved to be there as the corridors were filled with older students pushing their way through.  Draco was accidently shoved into their car.  Harry introduced himself and they shook hands.  Draco seemed apprehensive about talking with them, but, then Harry told him to sit down and then other first years started coming in.  It became filled to the brim.  They all talked about getting their letters, what magic they knew, they guessed how they would be put into their houses, and told stories they had heard about the giant squid.  When the trolley came by selling sweets, both Harry and Draco put out a few Galleons and bought treats for everyone.  Even before reaching Hogsmeade and the lakes edge where boats would take them to the castle, they were bonded.  They would be united despite the houses they were separated into.
"Nanna," he whimpered.
Harry awoke; he had no idea how long he'd been unconscious.  He removed his glasses which were askew and broken.  Slowly he wiped the dried blood from his eyes so he could see.  Perched over him was the Headmaster's phoenix.  Harry struggled to get to his knees.  He couldn't see beyond the bird as the chamber was in complete darkness.  He felt around the dirt floor.
"Are you hungry?" Lily asked as she sat down on the bed next to Harry and his cat.
As soon as Harry had taken that last swallow Draco's hands reached for Harry and pulled him back up to the pillows.  "And I was the one who was supposed to be decent at that," Draco said and then kissed Harry fully on the mouth while his hands made their way down Harry's body.
Lily sighed with resignation.  The kitchen door burst open and large black dog entered followed by James, Remus and Draco.  James gave Lily a questioning look.  Her lips thinned and her eyes lowered.  She gave a nod to Dumbledore.
"Have there been any mistakes?" Harry asked, trying desperately to keep up with what Dumbledore was telling him.  How many owls were there?  If there was only this one then how could multiple messages be sent?  How could it be young and then old?  He felt a headache coming upon him.
Draco’s brow quirked. He raised his left hand, showing off a silver snake wrapped around his ring finger. It stuck its forked tongue out at Harry. "Oh, I think we still have a bond."
Instantly the room came to a standstill in sound and movement.  The Wizengamots' eyes all focused on the witness chair, where Harry Potter was bound in chains.  Harry glanced out to the audience until he found an old witch with long grey hair.  She gave him a warm smile and a short nod.   Harry then rubbed his cheek against the owl perched on his shoulder.
Draco snickered.  "You'll be fine, Potter, your family is known for playing nice with the Mudbloods."   Without thinking of the repercussions, Harry drew his wand and pointed it at Draco.  Draco laughed at him.  "What spell are you going to use?  Incarcerous? Maybe even an Unforgivable?"
"Okay, but I'm afraid I don't have much to follow the Bubbleberry wine."
Draco looked at him askew.  "What in Father Christmas' name would you want to talk to me about?"
"Harry, you don’t know what you’re saying. It was by accident that the spell worked the way it did. It forced an attraction and feelings."
," Harry said when he found his wand next to the crumbled stone feet of Salazar Slytherin.  He fell back to the ground and screamed as he saw Dumbledore's stiff body nearby.  He crawled over to his Headmaster, not believing that he was truly gone.  He was.  He was still holding his wand.  Harry then saw another body near the entrance wall of the chamber.  Harry caught a glimpse of white hair.  He forced himself up and stumbled down the chamber towards Draco.  Somehow he knew that he was still alive or maybe he was fooling himself thinking that he saw shallow breathing.  Harry landed next to the body and rolled him over.  Draco's eyes opened.  They were soft grey.
"What?  Look at me, Draco, I had a family.  I had friends as a kid. It was perfect."
Harry smiled.  "I know.  I told you I got it for my birthday.  It's taken me until now to show it to you, but I have to tell you, Draco, I went there.  I went to the cage."
"It's Christmas Eve, Draco, and it's not like either of us has someone to share it with."
Harry shook his head.  "No, no we don't, Draco.  I've seen what I wanted to see.  We were young, we were in love and we thought it would last.  Why would I want to see it end?"
"Possible?" Harry asked, pushing aside that Dumbledore just said he rediscovered the cage.
"Harry?"
"I know, but I can't help but worry that someone might open that chamber again."
"Yeah, not like you're going to get
"What?" Harry asked.  His thoughts were still on him and Draco having wives and children.  He shook his head trying to clear the fog of timeline thoughts.  "Why wouldn't you have known?"
Draco gasped and stood up. "What? Harry, no! I didn’t. I mean I wouldn’t."
The whole idea of him fighting off a monster of some sort with a historical sword made him almost giggle.  While he was innately talented in Defence against the Dark Arts, he wasn't brave, at least not like his parents or the other members of the Order of the Phoenix.  He'd heard stories about them and what they did during the war.  He and Neville often joked how lucky they were that they didn't have to prove themselves to be warriors like their parents.  However, this was all beside the point, what did Dumbledore's vision have to do with a Horcrux?
Draco put his hand on Harry's knee.  "Potter, you're a romantic.  Never would have guessed.  But I have to watch this.  I need to know."
Lily shook her head and put her hand on Harry's shoulder, giving it a quick squeeze.  "I can tell," she said.  "This has nothing to do with my work, though, I do admit trying to research it from there, but, had no success."
"The boy has to know, Lily."
Harry coughed.  "You're serious?"
"This is ace, Potter. I hadn't pegged you for keeping up with the newest fashions in furniture and design."
"What were the four?" Harry asked.
The Minister began asking Auror Sloper explicitly about his testimony. It was Jack who had received the memory in a bottle, belonging to Marc Jorgenson. Jorgenson was an Auror mole. And it was Jack and Ron who’d searched the Zabini house for the contraband. The questioning was now striking Harry as odd; it had been a few years since he'd seen Kingsley this engaged in an Auror case. He supposed it was because he was friends with Zabini's mother.
"The truth is that Draco Malfoy is alive!" Harry said with a generous smile while he continued rubbing the owl.  The members of the Wizengamot gasped, some fainted, and then, like the Cheshire cat, Harry disappeared with a knowing grin lingering for a moment.
"I think she would like a treat," Dumbledore said and he opened his hand where a few owl treats appeared.  Harry took a couple pieces and offered it to the bird.  She gladly took them and then rubbed his cheek only once with her downy one.
"Yes, Harry, you lived, and that is crucial."
Harry sipped his drink first, hoping to get some liquid courage from the Ogden's.  "I was wondering if you knew where Malfoy was tonight."  Harry asked trying to be nonchalant about the whole thing.
"Harry, Professor Sinastra is on board and would like to speak to us," she said nervously while twirling a curl of her hair.
"Now you stay with him," Teddy said to the owl as he stroked her back.  "He might need you.  I might have screwed things up."
"Here," Harry said and pushed the present towards Draco. "I'm giving you a gift."
Harry almost dropped the tube. Never had Draco even come close to mentioning love and now he was asking Harry to pretend. The atmosphere of the whole room changed suddenly. The fire crackled and lights dimmed before going dark. A large growl of thunder shook the windows.
"Sir, I'm of age now.  I think I can handle hearing what you have to tell me," Harry said and then winced at the sky.  It was darkening.
~~o~~
Teddy was in the cage and there was the Tell-Tale Owl sitting on her perch.  She turned her face 180 degrees and then back again.  "Your feathers look like my hair gone wrong, but you're a beauty," Teddy said with smile.  The owl's tri-colours of blue, green, and yellow feathers were striking.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a few owl treats.  The owl hooted and fluttered her wings and gladly took the offering.
"What I'm going to tell you Harry is something I should've told you before, but I couldn't.  You and your parents are so happy, the way it should be.  I didn't want to hurt you and your perfect family."
"Dumbledore," Harry said with a sigh.  Of course he would take me away from everyone and tell me about the Prophecy.  You know it's obvious now, seeing him in this timeline, that he just didn't know how to handle that piece of information."
Draco snorted.  "Yeah, and I probably shouldn't judge.  I could imagine me in my younger days doing something similar."
"See you at the feast," Harry said and left the car.
," Lily said flashing her green eyes at James.
Janet nodded and raised her cherry wood wand. A whoosh of teal sparkles emerged and attacked Harry’s hair, flattening it down. With another flick a large cup of coffee floated into his hands.
"May I see the bird?" Dumbledore said while leading Harry to inside of the house away from the crowd landing on the lawn.  Harry hadn't realised that he was shielding a small bird from everyone in his hands.  Once inside the kitchen, Harry lifted his top hand revealing a young baby owl deep blue in colour.  His instinct was to stroke the feathers, as the bird nested in his left palm.  Dumbledore reached out and grabbed his right hand.   "Don't, don't stroke it until you are sure.  The bird is a fledgling, which means you will have time to choose."
"Potter you're an arse, it's more than fine," Draco said and placed Harry's hand on his head.  He slid under the covers and took Harry's cock into his mouth.
"If you had a son what would you name him?"
Harry stopped by the violet-curtained bed. His breath caught. Seeing Draco’s face relaxed while asleep always made his knees a bit weak. Well, always during the previous four months. Draco stirred as the first of the six chimes struck. "Potter," Draco mumbled as his hand stretched out to Harry’s side of the bed. A hint of disappointment crossed his face when long fingers, one adorned with a silver ring, scratched a vacant sheet.
"Harry, I think she wants to meet sooner than that."
Harry hopped out of bed and headed towards the shower. It never hurt to get to work early, see what the night shift Aurors had been up to and to prepare for the day. He’d been doing it all week.
Harry frowned and he stopped petting the cat.  "It's been opened before?  Does anyone know where it is?"
"We agree," Harry said and then became silent as the scene switched to him Apparating back to his bedroom on his birthday.  "Holy crap, Malfoy, are you that good at blow jobs?"
Draco shook his head.  "You're only seeing the good things.  Didn't you see that funeral a moment ago?  That was Rosmerta.  And the papers.  Aren't you reading them?  People are dying, Harry.  People who are alive in this world; this world we live in now."
Draco turned over.  Even in the dark, Harry could see the understanding in Draco's eyes.
"Did you set the alarm?" Draco mumbled as he drifted towards sleep.
Harry wasn't sure that's what he did.  He could see that the young Harry in that world, despite having all of the privileges, wasn't ready to take on Voldemort, not that anyone was ever ready.  He also didn't have Hermione as one of his best friends to help him.  But the crux was what his grandmother had said: the false timeline tried to merge back to the real one.  And because he wouldn't have escaped Azkaban or the Dementor's kiss, the timeline had to be forced to an end.
Harry inspected the seal more closely.  It was like the one he discovered his family had used when going through the Auror archives but none of them had been completely intact.  Most of them had been from his grandmother, Prudence, who he'd never met.  From her notes she seemed a bit quirky yet forceful.  "You know when I was young I saved myself using a Time-Turner.  Is that what’s involved here?"  Harry asked as he guardedly pulled on one end of the silver ribbon.
Harry nodded.  For a moment he felt unsure of the situation, as if one wrong move or word and Draco would leave.  It felt so odd, feeling that way about Draco Malfoy; decades ago he liked antagonising him.  But now was different; now they shared a history even if it wasn't one they had personally experienced.  He watched Draco walk about his room, inspecting what knick-knacks Harry kept on his bedside table, what was in his closet and the loo.  It struck him that maybe Draco wasn't judging him, but was also nervous.
"Er, I'm alone and my kids are grown."
"Do you want to talk about last night?  I'm assuming Albus told you about what your father and I, along with Sirius and Remus, have been up to these past years."
Harry sighed and petted the cat too roughly.  Merlin raised its paw and batted Harry's hand while hissing.  Harry glared at Merlin until he stood up and hopped off the bed.  Harry reached for his mother's hand and held on to it tightly.  "Mum, please don't go alone."
Harry rushed through his morning routine and bound down the stairs with still-wet hair.  His mother shook her head when Harry flopped down at the kitchen table.  With a wave of her wand, his black hair was dry and stylishly in place.  A side wooden table was buried beneath a mound of presents.  He didn't care about the number but his eyes searched for the tell-tale package.
The floor between them began to swirl, Hedwig moved back next to Harry.  Harry and Draco scooted back further as a scene before them began to appear and it was crystal clear.
"Really?"  Harry asked.  "Is that how you knew to be at the house that night?"
"Well, if it's a ring, I'll hex his arse back to the Manor," James said in a tone that Harry noted held more than a hint of warning.  "You're too young to get that serious and there's no pressing situation for you to make that type of commitment."
"Hey mate, you coming with Neville and me to Hogsmeade?" Ron asked as he sat down across from Harry blocking his view of the Snake's table.  Within a moment, Ron had filled his plate with rashers of bacon and fried eggs.
"Draco!" Harry yelled and turned Draco's face towards him.  A lone red tear rolled down Draco's cheek.
"What?  You're giving me a gift.  Oh hell, am I that pitiful?"
changed nothing in this timeline except alerting you to the existence of another timeline and giving you the owl.  That was the present, Harry, the owl.  He sent the owl to me with another message, years before.  I didn't know he sent a second message until today.   By giving you the owl, he's giving you the option to fix any mistake his original machinations might have made.  The boy, my guess, is an Unspeakable and is very clever."
"Because if you live then Voldemort is truly truly dead.  What I'm about to tell you Harry not even your parents know."
Harry thought deeply, trying to connect the pieces of information.  What he knew in his world was that Dumbledore had come to his home on Halloween in 1981 and duelled with Voldemort, killing him.  Peter had betrayed his parents and somehow he was killed while in his Animagus form.  Harry had always suspected it was Padfoot, but then sometimes he caught a look in his mother's eyes if Peter's name was brought up.  The one thing he never doubted was the extent his mother would go to protect her family.  But he did know in this other world both his parents died, Sirius and Mooney and even Tonks died, yet he lived. Then he repeated the name of his child.  The child that looked so much like him.  "Albus Severus," Harry whispered.  "You died, too," Harry added not wanting to believe it was true.  He couldn't imagine his own life without his parents, but he truly couldn't imagine Hogwarts without Dumbledore.  He would spend time later contemplating how and why he would ever name is son after Professor Snape.
"Sorry," Draco mumbled as he tried to retrieve the feathers, which had scattered about.  Hedwig hopped off Harry's shoulder and nipped Draco's hand as he reached for them.  She hopped over and picked up the red one with her beak and brought it over to the centre of the floor and set it down.  Draco looked over to Harry.  Harry shook his head.
"Good," she said and leant down and kissed him on the forehead.   They both then glanced over the side of the bed as Merlin was playing with what sounded to be a piece of parchment.  Lily bent down and picked up a scroll tied with a silver ribbon.  "I assume your beau left this for you this morning," she said with a knowing smile.
"Just give me a day with that family and this nonsense would end," Nanna said and gave a cackle that sent shivers up Harry's spine.
"Gellert Grindelwald?"
"I suppose that makes sense. It's true that an Auror lying under oath would be dealt with harshly. Add to that his crimes, and there’s no way a solicitor, even one like you, could get him off, then."
"Yes," Dumbledore answered forthright.  "But there is more that you need to know.  But it's imperative that you be careful in who you share this information."
Dumbledore glanced at Harry directly and Harry could tell instantly that his father had analysed the situation correctly.  Draco's hand slid into his and gave it a squeeze.  "Tell us what happened?" Harry said.  "Who sent you the owl?"
"Okay, Nanna, I'll be down in ten."
Dumbledore laughed. "Yes, Harry, possible.  Only one timeline can truly exist.  What we just saw was what likely would have happened if I hadn't intervened.  Now sit back and let me tell you what I was privileged enough to see over the years.
Harry sat down and cup of spiced bubbleberry tea appeared next to him.  Harry watched Dumbledore walk around the room's library inspecting spines of books.   Finally, he pulled one out.  Even though it was thinner than most; it seemed to take great force to remove it from the shelf.  Dumbledore then sat down across from Harry and raised a fire in the fireplace.  Despite it being mid-summer, Harry welcomed the flames.
Hermione jumped at the directness of his reply. "What? Why?"
"I do hope he remembers to pick up the Jatmansi for me," Nanna said.  Lily covered her mouth, stifling a giggle.
"Ropes are next, Malfoy."
"So do we know who used it previously?" Remus asked as he stepped closer to Dumbledore and Lily to see what was in the Headmaster's hand, Dumbledore's hand clenched into a tight fist.
Draco snickered again. "That's what I wanted to do, but the Minister wanted to play it out. He wanted Auror Sloper to testify. I can't be sure why he didn't tell you, but my guess would be that he didn't want Sloper to have any advance warning. Not that you would tell anyone, but he was more worried for Jack's life." Harry grinned, knowing that last part was true. "The Minister wanted Auror Sloper to be dealt with within the system. I think he considered it a large affront to you and to his own Ministry," Draco added while gingerly placing his hand on Harry's knee.
"No, thank you.  Mother wouldn't let me out of the house until I had breakfast with her.  She's a bit lonely since Father is on Ministry business abroad."
"So you did ask him then?" Harry asked which got him an affectionate swat across the head.  "Hey, wait, you said open it.  Does that mean he knows where it is?"
"Let her in," Harry called. He continued to feel badly for his administrator. Before Draco had entered his life, she would barge into his room with any news. Unfortunately, she had entered one afternoon a few days after the bonding. He and Draco had come to fist-a-cuffs and then had ended up snogging on the floor. They hadn’t quite made it to the sofa before Janet walked in and caught them frotting on the carpet.
Draco laughed.  "Merlin, could it get any more Hufflepuff?"
"Harry!" Draco said. Shock and what might have been hurt showed on Draco's face. "Listen. Just listen for a moment."
"Harry, there is a prophecy, which I will share with you in its entirety, but for the moment you only need to know that only one of you can truly live at the same time.  In this other time he marked you as his equal, in this world he hasn't.  I stopped him that night, but that doesn't mean he won't go after you again if given the chance.  If a there is another Horcrux out there, which if he somehow activates and comes back, he'll be an even darker wizard than before."
"Oh God," Harry said and frantically undid his own zipper. He lifted his bum up and pulled his trousers down to his booted calves. "Come on, Draco, sit on me," Harry said as his hand ran up and down his own cock. It didn’t diminish as it had that morning.
Harry shook his head at his mother's curiosity.  She was definitely in the right profession but he feared one day she'd go too far while investigating some artefact or place.  "You're going to tell Dad aren't you?"
Harry tried to wrap his mind around what that would entail and couldn't do it on the spot.  However, what was of importance now was that his Godson was hurting and he wasn't sure what he was about to tell him would hurt or help.  "Teddy, I'm glad you didn't find this owl.  Some things are left best as legends.  If you had done what you wanted to then who knows what would have occurred.  It could have been Dark magic.   And plus, my dear Teddy, I do know that more than likely you wouldn't be here right now if you had and that is something I would never want to change."
The two men and Teddy walked up to the corner behind which Ms Grindal just stepped forward and led them to a small sitting area. Harry and Draco sat down on a couch and Teddy jumped up on Harry’s lap, Kelly seated herself between the men.
In the evening, during dinner Draco was able to hear everything about the afternoon Teddy and Hermione had spent together. She had invited Draco over to dinner so he wouldn’t have the trouble of dealing with cooking tonight.
“Engagement ring?” asked Teddy. “What does it do?”
As Draco walked back in, the front door only leaned on, he heard the couple fighting.
“Draco! Where have you been? You’re never late!” the boy asked.
“Again? It’s like this woman is incapable of having a long-time relationship,” Draco mumbled while casting a spell, that made the wedding stuff float onto a shelf.
” repeated the Jarvey on her shoulder with a giggle.
It was true. They used to exchange letters now and then but ever since Draco had started meeting Harry and became more occupied with his work basically every year, their contact had stopped.
While ruffling through Teddy’s blue hair, Draco asked again, “What is this?”
“Josephine, I am sorry for the delay,” he quickly apologised.
“Will it be registered to you?” Mallard asked.
Walking up to Robards, he greeted the other wizards and asked his boss, “So, what’s the status? We got him?”
again? At the Manor,” clarified Teddy and waited for an answer.
The boy giggled, jumped off the bed and handed Harry a tie in the same colour as Kelly’s, “Can you help me bind it? I can do bow-ties but ties confuse me.”
Getting closer to the teacher and her class, Draco heard what exactly Mrs Andrews was saying, “How many times do I have to tell you? Edward Lupin, called Teddy, about this tall, blue hair, probably,”
“I’m not going to kill you, before I took everything away from you,” Lucius said laughing.
Draco gave the kid a judgemental look, then nodded, “Of course. How could I have possibly forgotten this? With seven you’re almost in second grade. You’re really almost an adult. There are only eleven years left.”
“Josie, you cannot-”
’ The first thing he did was sorting job-application, Auror records and transfer applications. One of the transfer applications caught his special attention.
“Helpful,” he muttered, “well, I’ve got to go now. I’m meeting up with someone.”
“Honestly I couldn't care less about America and their overly complicated MACUSA system and their shitty muggle politics and-”
~~~oOo~~~
“I said Potter, didn’t I!?”
“And you’re not ready to do so yet, am I right?” she said and he nodded.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Quahog said. “I sadly have to leave you now. Commissioner Ackles will stay with you until Ms Lopez brings your luggage and the portkey. Have a nice trip home.”
“All alone today, Mr Malfoy?” she asked calmly while preparing her tools.
Draco panted heavily. He didn’t want to see it. He just wanted it all to end.
“Quite fine,” Harry answered and told about his day.
She nodded and handed it to him upon request. Quickly Draco tipped in a number and pressed the speaker button.
“Sorry,” Ackles chuckled and held her hand out towards the Jarvey, that climbed back up onto her shoulder. “I didn’t know where you were, so I asked Spike to find you. He’s like a blood hound.”
Teddy lowered his head and rung with his fingers.
birthday and he and his father had spent days organizing the perfect birthday picnic. ‘
He knew the mothers of these kids. When they met for play dates, Draco usually had a cup of tea with the mothers. Tyler’s mom Krista had been a little suspicious at first, but had quickly warmed up after realizing that both of them had been in Slytherin. With Mora’s mom Hope it had been a little different. Hope had been a Hufflepuff and when she had seen Draco for the first time, the only thing she had asked was ‘coffee or tea’ followed by the question about his favourite sort of cake. A little later, but only after being asked about it, she had stated that she didn’t care about the whole Deatheater thing. The way she had seen him act around the children had convinced her that he was a good man.
“Awesome, right?” Teddy asked. “I’ve been practising that for weeks now.”
“Yes,” she answered, “it is nice, isn’t it? I bought it at an adorable little shop in Diagon Alley just last week. The shop just opened. But the two of you, tell me about yourself. What happened lately?”
He started with the crème brûlée. He put cream, sugar, milk, yolk and vanilla in a bowl and stirred everything. After that he put it in small bowls and put it into the fridge. He started preparing the tomato soup by cutting onions and pepper balls. With a little garlic and oil he roasted it in a pot. He peeled the tomatoes and cut them into the pot to the other ingredients. Stirring everything, he added some water and broth and let it cook. He wanted to thicken it by boiling and looked after the crème brûlée. The crème nearly had the right stiffness.
Draco didn’t answer. Kelly put her paws on his lap and purred. He took another piece of cheese and gave it to her.
“You are Draco Malfoy!” Alexander gasped loudly and outraged.
“You know what I can do now?” Teddy asked enthusiastically and ran his hands though his hair.
“Who’s your wife?” she asked, totally ignoring his request. “Some famous pureblood too?”
Teddy sulked a little. He didn’t understand Ginny’s behaviour. ‘
The piano still stood in the living room. They had bought a new sofa at Draco’s new favourite furniture shop IKEA, and next to the door to the workroom stood a shelf with an ever growing collection of Disney videotapes and – the quite new – DVDs. Harry had even bought a DVD-Player.
“How do you know about this?” he muttered.
of June came faster than Draco had realised it. As he awoke on this Sunday morning he found his bed empty. Everything was flooded by light, the curtains and windows were open and warm summer air and the tweeting and singing of birds filled the room.
“I… don’t know,” Draco muttered and bit his thumbnail. “Something’s not right. The tie…”
Ron shrugged. His sister maybe was happy without Harry but she still hated Malfoy and missed her ex-boyfriend from time to time.
~~~oOo~~~
“Avada Kedavra,” Lucius said in cold blood.
The soup was still slightly bubbling on a low flame and boiled down. He put on another pot with water and waited for it to heat up. After he put the spaghetti into the water he tasted the soup and added a little salt and pepper.
He put the letter in an envelope, wrote the address down and handed it Draco.
For Draco it was a mystery why the Weasley girl was even here. She pretty much had a hate-boner for her ex and even though she was part of this family, Draco wouldn't have come, when he had been in her shoes.
“I’d say I’m the one that’s better dressed,” he said with a playful smirk.
“Tomorrow already?” she asked surprised. “Well, America is not that bad. They have so many great sights to see.”
Draco chuckled and looked over to Blaise. The young man was flabbergasted and just pointed around between the couple.
Ron let out a loud sigh and muttered, “I only wanna have a good night’s rest again.”
’! Just the person you had an unholy obsession with!”
Draco smiled and continued eating. At first, when they had started dating, he had hated it when Harry had called him angel, because he hadn’t seen himself as anything resembling an angel. But nowadays it was soothing him. He didn’t call him that everyday, only in certain moments. Moments that were usually filled with positivity and happiness. Sometimes he called him angel when he had done something stupid and wanted to apologise but he also called him that when he was worried about him. Very worried.
Harry put his fork down and looked over to his beloved, “You’re the famous Draco Malfoy. Thanks to people like Rita Skeeter, the world knows pretty much your whole life-story. Thus including that you never wanted to become a deatheater.”
A hand was placed on his shoulder. Looking around he saw Robards.
Very curious Ron and Hermione leaned forward, while Teddy just uninterested continued to eat his cake, dropping cream for Kelly now and then. With a proud smile Harry put a silver flip phone with a red and golden band and a small lion figure, on the table. Draco pulled out a phone of the same built and it too had a band but in the Slytherin colours and with a small silver snake.
“No. That’s why I only do it when he’s not around,” he answered and petted the small, round head, “I leave it up to him.”
“There is one question I have, Mr Malfoy,” the blond woman said, as the removal was almost done.
“America’s not that special,” Harry answered. “For example wizards and witches have only been allowed to marry muggles there for like the last 40 years.”
She chuckled, “Since you became,” she threw a quick glance at Robards, who talked with Peasegood, “his assistant, he’s much more organised and I get my documents back much faster. Don’t ever think you pencil-pushers are less worth than the ones doing the action. I gotta go. Robards!” she said louder and waved before walking away. “My assistant brings you the report from today tomorrow. I want it back the same day.”
Hermione put the champagne bottle on the table and placed a photograph next to it, the back upside down. Harry saw the date on the back. 4
For the first time in what felt forever Harry allowed Draco to dress him. For Draco it was of utmost concern to make Harry look suitable for his father. His mother may liked Harry the way he was, but his father was a totally different person and everything had to be perfect.
Draco nodded, “Yes. I meet Andromeda for brunch and we pick up Teddy together. Otherwise the school would haul me over the coals. They’re so suspicious.”
Draco almost broke his Quill as he saw the documents and records.
“Bye, Teddy,” she said with a charming smile. “Mr Malfoy.”
“Aren’t Jarveys illegal to own?” Draco asked while pouring a little milk in his tea.
A second later the door was slammed shut hard and Krista came marching towards the kitchen.
“No dog,” Draco said. “We have Teddy and Kelly and as long as Teddy still lets his toys lay around everywhere, we’re not getting a puppy.”
“You’re overdressed, but handsome,” Harry answered.
Draco thought about giving back a snarly, sarcastic answer but felt not like it, “Her name is Cassiopeia and she’ll be Harry’s birthday present. What do you think of her?”
“Wouldn’t you be?” Draco asked sarcastically and sucked in a heavy breath. “I-I mean… for the first time in ten or twelve years he tells me that he initially wanted to protect me from… everything. But in the end he… didn’t do anything. He let everything happen, drove me into Voldemort’s arms, forced me to smuggle Deatheaters into Hogwarts and even made me murder Dumbledore. He pushed me away after the war and… tried to kill Teddy and me as soon as he heard we were together.”
“I love you too,” Draco replied.
“Non of this is my fault, alright?” he interrupted her. “I’ve used a spell to see what he was dreaming about. Something you could have done too, by the way. When he took away my wand during the war, he felt guilty for that. And for some reason that haunted him.”
“Perfect,” she said, “put it in the small form and use a crystallising spell on it.”
Very confused the young parents looked at the blond, who they thought was the last likely person to ever get attached to muggle-technology.
“Oh, Krista’s husband is one of those people,” Draco answered and sat down next to Harry who immediately put an arm around his beloved’s shoulder.
The boy nodded and they apparated home.
“You are always dressed nicely,” Harry said with a small chuckle.
With this words he left.
Harry flinched and almost knocked over the vase with his wand as he turned to the door. Teddy jumped from Hermione’s lap and ran to his uncle to hug him.
’ name was. Why is no-one flirting with me?”
He was able to lift himself on his knees and looked for his wand.
“Why breakfast?” Draco asked at some point. “Or is it already considered brunch?”
He dropped his keys into the bowl on the small table and entered the living room. Draco leaned on the kitchen island, nibbling on an apple slice. Teddy sat on a stool at the island and read a book.
Hermione just giggled, “Yes, she’s very inpatient. We told her green. Now she’s just waiting for the initials to put on.”
“Hello, mother,” he greeted her. “I’m just fine. What about you? You look tired.”
“Hah,” Draco made uncomfortable, “I had to… make up… some mistakes. Teddy, you’re ready?”
“But I have school on Thursday,” Teddy moaned. “I wanna come too.”
As he stood up he heard Teddy saying, “Harry, what’s with Draco? Is he ill?”
The school bell ended all classes and Teddy left the school with his two friends Tylor and Mora.
“Are you nuts, Granger?” Draco hissed.
“I can and I will!” she interrupted her brother. “Do you really think I would listen to you two? I’m going! And I’m late already!”
wanted stilettos,
“Yes, Mr Malfoy. Have a nice weekend,” the woman said. “See you on Monday, Teddy.”
“You have a son?” she asked confused and noticed the ring on his hand, “And married. Alright. Wouldn't have thought so. But I guess that’s what’s expected from the heir of the pureblood family Malfoy.”
Draco’s eyes widened as he saw the beautiful, elegant silver ring with the small engravings.
“I did,” he growled. “Doesn’t change the aftermath.”
Josephine was close to murder them as she hissed, “Sam, Jared, get out of my way.”
A cheeky smile crossed his lips as he muttered, “Seems like snakes run in our family.”
“Stay there,” he repeated and, the half-kneazle still in his arms, walked back to her.
“About becoming an instructor,” Harry explained. “I wouldn’t have to go on missions any more. I could spent more time with you and Teddy and I would even earn a little more money.”
Draco smiled brightly and said, “Well, as for the unicorn… I practised the Patronus charm and it worked. And my Patronus… well, it’s a unicorn.”
“It’s the weather,” Draco explained. “This place’s aura depends heavily on the weather conditions.”
But then he remembered his childhood. When he had been Teddy’s age, back in the late 80s. For him, this time had never been very special but on TV people always remembered that time with so much fun. A certain memory entered his head. He had been eight years old and it had been a warm summer day. It had been his mothers 33
The guest room was no-more. It now was a boy’s room through and through. Toys laid around everywhere in the house and Draco had to tell Teddy twice a day to tidy up his stuff. Half the time it worked but after a day it was a mess again.
“Yes!” she said, her voice high pitched.
As usual Teddy stopped on the stairs for a moment to make out Draco’s position. But today his uncle was nowhere to be found. Instead another face, with kind green eyes, messy black hair and round glasses caught his attention.
“Wow, I didn’t know about these marks. That’s gruesome,” she muttered. “And the flowers? Do they mean something? Like protection in British or something?”
Draco muttered around why he couldn't stand America and the American magical government and how he despised his boss for just taking him along on this ‘mission’.
Tylor smiled and replied, “My dad wants to meet with you for tea when he drops me off. Is that okay?”
A weirdly honest smile appeared on Lucius face and he said, “I wanted Draco to go to Durmstrang at first. But Narcissa insisted on sending him to Hogwarts.”
“I do not have a wife and I am not married yet,” he said calmly and took another sip of tea.
He winked at the girl and with a small smile she waved him goodbye while he left. Out of reach from the muggle he sighed loud and loosened his tie a little. He should have known that the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes would be here too. The Aurors from his Department all knew the memory charm, but no-one did the obliviation better than the obliviatiors that were specially trained for these kind of happenings.
Draco forced a smile on his face again. Of course he had the luck to follow around Ms Dislikable and her bloody Jarvey. Why did it had to be a ferret? A ferret! It wasn’t even legal to own a Jarvey. While Robards and Quahog were still talking, Draco and Ms Ackles stared daggers into each other.
He led her to the dining table, put Kelly down and they sat down. Andromeda complimented the big variety on the table.
“Harry’s in Sweden on a mission,” he explained smiling. “And I just wanted to wait for the right moment.”
“Teddy, you have to understand that your uncle as well as I were very worried about you,” Mrs Andrews tried to explain to him in a friendly and caring tone. “We do not punish you because we like to do it. This is for your own good, so you learn from it. Okay?”
of July, Draco knocked on Robards’ office door and was invited in. His boss had called him because of some urging matter. Draco just hoped Robards wouldn't have some stupid mission for Harry that would boycott their plans for his birthday party. He was already planing who they would invite when they would celebrate and what they would have to eat. Also he was going to have his cover-up at this point and they could not only celebrate Harrys 25
“I-I thought this boy was Mr Potters son?” she asked. “Was he married to your cousin?”
It was Sunday, the 30
He sighed a little and asked her what was next before muttering, “I just miss them.”
The pain didn’t seize. It got worse with every second. Draco started to lose the feeling in his hands and feet. He hoped to finally pass out or to die, just to escape this torture. And suddenly it stopped. Draco opened his eyes to see the ceiling of the manor.
“Why that?”
“Exactly,” Draco said sharp. “And now imagine how your teacher, Mrs Andrews feels now.”
“What?” she asked. “Have you never thought about marrying Harry?”
They walked over to a black haired woman in a long red coat. An Auror had just finished her memory erasure. As she spotted Draco and her daughter she ran towards them and pressed the girl to her chest.
“I want to find a nice meal for next Monday,” Draco replied. “You remember, Valentine’s Day? I’ve already organized that Andromeda joins me while picking Teddy up from school and brings him to school again on Tuesday.”
of April 2005. Hesitating he grabbed the photo. Before he turned it around he took another look at Hermione and the bottle. On the label stood the name of the champagne as well as the word non-alcoholic. He turned the photograph and saw a black-white picture.
Crying tears of joy he asked, “You, the great Draco Malfoy, is working as an assistant?! I can’t believe it! How’d that happened? He gave you his daughter to work for him? No, wait, I forgot. You’re Draco ‘
Harry shook his head.  "No, sir, I don't believe that."
Ron's eyes widened.  "Sounds good to me, Potter.  It'll cost you."
Harry's eyes widened.  He knew the Headmaster favoured him in some ways, ways in which most students weren't aware of given how often Harry was in trouble and seen polishing awards won by his father, but, to play with timelines?  "Because of me?  But I looked fine—at least physically.  I mean Draco will kill me for marrying Ginny Weasley, but it looks like he married the younger Greengrass witch, which is just bizarre given that Draco has been out about his sexuality before most kids even know about sex. And…"
Draco took another sip of scotch. He dangled the tie in front of Harry’s face. Harry batted it away. The repercussion of one of his Aurors being involved in illegal trade was unthinkable. The community for the past few years had finally let their guard down. They all had healed as much as they could and now the trust that they had finally put back into the Ministry would be damaged. He needed to talk to Kingsley. God, how could this have happened under his watch? Was it because he’d been so distracted with Draco the past few months? Shit, would the bond allow this? Yes, this was work, but it felt like Draco had betrayed him.
for you?"  Harry kicked Draco's shin under the table.  Draco turned and snarled at Harry.
The first few times Harry had asked him for certain things, Draco had feigned non-interest. Not now. Instead, he leaned over Harry and straddled him with his white shirt tails covering his bum and cock. He handed Harry the lube. "Fuck me like you love me."
Harry smiled between sips of the bubbleberry tea.  He hoped in the other timeline he got to enjoy bubbleberry tea, too.
Draco didn’t turn towards him but shook his head. "No, I didn't know for sure, but I'd guessed it was fading."
A knock startled him from his deep thoughts.  A welcomed guest entered.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and led him up the winding stairs, to the third floor.  A floor he'd added for just him when he had first moved in.  Never had he had a visitor.  It wasn't safe in his position as Head Auror, so it was always a hotel room in Muggle London.  There was never a morning after.
"Well I can't solve his erectile dysfunction problem without it," Nanna said before sipping down the rest of her tea.  Harry saw the mischievous glint in her still bright brown eyes peeking over the teacup rim.  He gave her another wink.
"No," Harry said, motioning towards the sitting area. "Let’s just sit and talk this out."
Harry looked down at Draco's hand, which was still on his knee.  It felt nice, especially now when discussing the Prophecy.  He put his hand over Draco's, taking a chance.  "Yeah, I'll have to tell you the sordid details later, but it involves Snape, which by the way, I think I like it better when he treated you more poorly than me."
The early summer sunrise woke him up.  Pink clouds with tinges of purple filled the eastern sky.  Harry sighed, cursing himself for not closing the bed drapes before he went to sleep.  He reached for his wand on the bedside table and worked the magic, but it was too late.  He was awake and his mind was already filling with thoughts of Horcruxes and the Prophecy.  He reached for his glasses to unblur his world and noticed that Draco had left a letter near where his wand had been.  While Harry knew Draco probably hoped to sneak into the Manor before his parents detected that he was missing, Harry wished he had stayed.
"Good, I see we do agree on some things," she said.  "Now, what question can I answer for you?"
"Yes, I believe that is true.  But you need to know that is not why the owl was used so I could live.  The owl was sent to me because of you.  I never used it to change timelines, but to help this timeline.  I didn't want you to suffer like you did in the other."
The world calmed down again and everything seemed perfect again.  Harry was off to Hogwarts while his parents, Dumbledore, and Remus and Sirius were off Horcrux hunting.
Fear was replaced with disbelief.  Did Voldemort truly think Harry cared about ruling the world?  Did he really think such things drove Harry's dreams for the future?  Harry honestly could say that he never wanted to be all powerful.  Never.  But what he did know was that he was unlikely to get out of the Chamber alive if he said no, and also Draco stood no chance of returning to his former self.  If he tried to escape, whatever killed the others would get him, too.  The monster Dumbledore saw in the other world was here, too.
"Prudence!" Dumbledore snapped.
Harry could feel his cheeks redden and could see a blush cross Draco’s.
Harry sighed.  He didn't know if he was doing the right thing.  Draco Malfoy may have grown up and become a decent man and wizard, but they still had a past.  Harry shook his head as the image he saw in the birdcage of them running down to the dungeon together merged with memories of them in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom where Harry had almost killed Draco.   "Have you ever heard of a Tell-Tale Owl?"
Harry glared at her. It had been the Unity Spell, discovered in Sprout’s papers after her death that had the unintentional result of bonding Harry with Draco and Cho with Ernie. Draco later had told him that if it had to be a Gryffindor, at least it hadn’t been a Weasley.
Dumbledore coughed and then cleared his throat.  From his robe pocket he pulled out a lemon drop and put it in his mouth.  Harry had learned over the years that Dumbledore used hard candy much like his father used his pipe, to calm his nerves and give him a moment to think.
"Did you ever regret asking?"
"Draco?"
"You don't know who sent her.  It could be a trap."
"Go, Harry, hurry," Draco said and then hissed a few more words.  The wall opened.  Harry wanted to bring Draco with him but he couldn't even stand on his own.  He reached for him but then Draco's hand rose and grabbed Harry by the throat.  Grey eyes turned red.  Harry swatted the hand away and fled through the opened wall.  Fawkes flew overhead with Dumbledore's body.  The wall closed shut.
Harry stared between the golden bars.  The blue sky appeared infinite.  He didn't know how to respond to what Dumbledore had just revealed about bringing House unity.  It seemed an odd thing to say but then saying something odd was not unusual for the Headmaster.  Harry was thrilled that he was going to be Head Boy.  Draco would be jealous but would try and hide it.  Harry hoped that he would at least be a Prefect this year, but that was up to the Slytherin Head of House.  Snape, Harry was sure, would never forgive Draco for being with Harry. James said Snape was just jealous that Draco got his Gryffindor.  Lily always rolled her eyes at that comment.  Harry wondered what he and Draco would be like in that other world…if Voldemort had somehow won.
!" Fudge said in a magically-enhanced voice.
Teddy sobered quickly and Harry surmised that it had to do with the extinct species Teddy had been investigating.  Some type of bird given the feather and drawing of a cage.  "The three Ds I think you can figure out," Teddy said, "and as to the cage, well in for Knut might as well be a Galleon.  It's a place, Harry, and I'd hoped to find a way to change things.  But when I got there, it was empty with only this scroll lying on the bottom."
if there wasn't something.  "Draco, I received this note and I can vouch for its authenticity," Harry said and reached into the pockets of his coat searching for the scroll.  He pulled it out and handed it to Draco.  Butterflies filled his stomach.  He reached for his wine while he waited for Draco's reaction.
"Hey," Harry responded.
"She needs a name so she'll come to you in the future…that is if you choose to call her," Dumbledore said and offered another treat.  She bit his finger causing it to bleed.  "Ah, yes, she's truly yours now."
"Voldemort did this?" Harry asked, but, deep inside he knew the answer.
"I’m sorry, Harry," Hermione said and reached across the table, patting Harry’s hand. "You know I’m still researching the situation every spare moment I have and so is every other staff member."
Harry's eyes shot a glance to Dumbledore.  "Why must you tell me?  Have you told my parents? Sirius and Remus?"
Harry smiled.  "Thanks, I almost forgot.  I hope I'll see you later tonight at the Hog's Head for a shot or three to celebrate me leaving this place and that birthday thing.  The kids are all going to be there; James arrived home last night."
"Some warning would be nice!" Draco said as he stumbled out of Harry's grasp.  "I suppose this is your home; didn't you think maybe I would like to go to mine?"
Draco's grey eyes widened. "Will you show me?"
"Well obviously it's because we weren't friends in this one," Harry replied and then ducked as Draco tried to swat him.
"I'll pour, you get naked," Draco said.  Harry did as he was told and set the bottle and glasses down next to the candle and made quick haste in taking off his clothes.  He set them on a chair by the window.  He stepped back to the bed.  Draco had pulled back the sheets and cover for him.  The white sheets almost glowed in the low light.  They were the softest he'd ever had.  He considered it a major indulgent at the time, but Lily had told him he wouldn't regret it.  She, of course, was right.  Harry slipped in between the sheets and sat up next to Draco.  The headboard's black leather cushioning was enough of a comfortable support.  Draco handed him a shot of Firewhisky.  Harry initiated the toast and their glasses clinked.  The burn down his throat wasn't too strong but the immediate tingle it gave was enough to get things started.  Draco set down his glass and then took Harry's away too.  Harry's spectacles were the next to go.  Draco carefully folded them up and placed them safely behind the candle holder.
"Will you be joining us for breakfast, Draco?" Lily asked while directing a mug of steaming hot coffee to land before him.
Harry frowned at Draco.  "What my house isn't good enough for you?"
"But Voldemort is dead here.  You killed him."
"You can.  I need you to come somewhere with me.  Someplace that might change how you think about your life and how I think about mine."
Teddy loped in.  Even though he was now close to forty, Harry thought he still looked like a teenager in his dress and walk.
"No!" Harry said and unwrapped his end of the tie, letting it fall. "Tell me what happened or I’m going back to the office now."
"How many, Headmaster?" Harry asked while setting the book down on the chessboard.  He'd seen enough.  He brushed his fingers on his trousers before he picked up the bubbleberry tea and sipped it.  The flavour brought him comfort.  He guessed his grandmother had shared her precious harvest with the Headmaster.
"It's not perfect, Harry," Draco said.
Harry felt his stomach turn when he saw Tom Riddle's diary fall out Draco's book bag.  Within a few minutes he knew what was going to happen.  They would end up in the Chamber of Secrets.  It also struck him that it might not have been so coincidental that Draco mentioned it before.  Maybe Dumbledore was right, some things were core.
"Yes, but, someone could've…oh hell, Potter, this is just odd.  I mean you and me.  Come on."
"The fourth was a diadem belonging to Ravena Ravenclaw.  It was the easiest to find as it was at Hogwarts.  Sirius charmed Ravena's daughter, the Grey Ghost, into telling him where it was."
"Harry!" Hermione called, standing up and waving at him from across the Three Broomsticks. He stomped his feet on the entry mat. The rain had already started in Scotland, and mud was caked around his boots' edges. He guessed the storm would reach London earlier than he’d hoped. He waved back in acknowledgement to Hermione and then nodded to a few others. Even a dozen years after the victorious day, people still turned their heads when Harry entered an establishment. He smiled and greeted more of the patrons as he made his way over to Hermione, then gave a quick smile to Rosmerta.
Harry's heart froze.  Up until this moment, he realised, he hadn't comprehended the severity of the situation.  His parents gone…Remus and Sirius gone…who would want live a life without them?  "How can you tell?" Harry asked, despite his fear of the answer.
"And love?"
Harry knew Draco was right. And yet ... "Isn’t that true for everyone, Draco? That people meet by accident. I mean even if you grow up next door to someone, it’s by coincidence that they live there. So this happened by accident. Does that mean it's all fake? The bond didn’t make Cho leave her husband and sleep with Ernie."
"By the way, where’s Ron?" Hermione asked, as if reading Harry’s mind.
The sky was bluer than blue where the Tell-Tale Owl resided.  Harry sat at the bottom of the cage cross-legged.  He carefully removed the ribbon and uncurled the love letter Draco had written.  It said all there was to say, Harry thought, but that was because he knew Draco, really knew Draco.  It made him physically ill to think of what Draco was going though right now being possessed by Voldemort.  Harry was sure, as was his Nanna, that Voldemort would find a way to create his own body.  In the meantime, though, no one believed Harry that Voldemort was back or that some monster was responsible for all of the deaths.  Lucius Malfoy blamed Harry saying he had been practising Dark magic, the
"No, Severus doesn't know how to open it," Lily said, bringing Harry out of his wondering thoughts.
It was in that moment Harry realised that Draco was nervous and that their bond was lessening. Draco never asked if he was hungry, sleepy, etc… Draco just knew.
Harry rolled his eyes.  It was highly unlikely he would find a fifth Horcrux before his parents.  "No, mum, you don't."
Harry rolled his eyes, knowing he was doomed. Draco leant over him and placed his lips on Harry's. He tasted of scotch. Draco’s right hand worked its way up Harry’s thigh. Harry adored when Draco did this, took his time. Not to say he didn’t like to be stricken starkers with a spell, but this— this was nice. Draco’s lips made their way across his cheek.
Harry barked out a laugh.  Patrons at tables nearby glanced over at them.  Draco opened the bottle of wine and poured the glasses full.  Harry marvelled at the deep indigo colour.
"Why are you only telling me?  Why not them?"
"No! Dammit, Malfoy, I’m not going to listen to you try to seduce me out of this. I don’t know how you did it. How did you find the loophole in the bond?"
Harry took a long sip of tea, only partially bothered that the Headmaster knew exactly what he had been thinking. However, he was more anxious to discover what Dumbledore saw it and how it related to a fifth Horcrux.
"It's Grindelwald," Harry stated, "He's going to take the owl."
"We would kill each other," Harry replied and then took an overly large bite of the warm lamb, generously stuffed in a crusted roll. He actually wasn’t sure what they would do now, but in the first few months rules had definitely been needed.
Without questioning Draco’s motives, Harry did so. It was the part of the bond that had taken Harry the longest to get used to, but now was the part he loved the most. Yes, love, he thought to himself as he took a long sip of the amber spirit. Despite what Hermione said, there was love. He loved that the bond forced him and Draco to trust each other implicitly. Neither could hurt the other intentionally. So whatever Draco had done in that courtroom might hurt Harry professionally, but it was a matter of work. It wasn't personal.
"You what?" Harry asked as the image of his office faded from view.
"That night…Halloween…" James whispered.
Harry looked into the fire, remembering the images revealed once the train steam disappeared.  He was alive and he had a family.  "I lived," he whispered.
Harry laughed even though his heartbeat quickened as he untied the package Padfoot and Moony had sent him.
Harry snorted.  "Don't think we have a choice now," he said as Hedwig brought forth the green feather and dropped it into the centre like the others.
"So if Kingsley knew, why didn't he tell me?" This irritated Harry more than Draco not saying anything. After all, Jack was one of his Aurors. "And why did he have Jack testify? I mean why not just arrest him with the evidence?"
"No, Harry, I haven't.  I will leave that up to you, who else to share this with.  I just ask that you never let Lucius Malfoy know.  He and his wife's sister, Bellatrix, were very close to Voldemort.  Lucius might have a vested interest for attaining more power in the wizarding world, while Bella would do it for love.  Voldemort was her god."
The Leaky Cauldron was filled to the brim with magical folks from London and afar.  The scent of spiced wine mixed with cherry pipe smoke made Harry admit that it was a good idea to get out of his house tonight.  "Harry!" Seamus Finnigan yelled from behind the bar.  "Merry Christmas!" he added and a glass of warm eggnog was hovered over to him.  Specks of freshly grated nutmeg floated on top while a shot of Ogden's finest rested on the bottom.  It was Harry's favourite holiday drink.
"Well, there isn't' much to see there.  It looks abandoned, but I did find out that if you ask a question that it will show you something.  It showed me one scene of you and me.  We were young, Draco.  We were at Hogwarts and we were friends.  I was an Animagus, a black cat, and you brought me with you into Slytherin.  It was amazing to see."
Harry chuckled. "We’ll be there in thirty."
"Should have been awake forty-five minutes ago," Harry said. He stood up and tried to straighten his maroon cloak but Draco kept hold of Harry’s hand and pulled him back down. Harry tried to stand his ground, but Draco let go and he stumbled. Before he could reach the rug on the wood floor, he was naked, and Draco was smirking with wand in hand.
Harry stared out the window; rays of sunshine crossed into their bedroom. Apple tree leaves broke up the light streams as an early breeze gently shook the branches. It portended a storm for later in the day. He glanced at the clock on the bedside table; only five minutes had passed since he had awoken with a start. The alarm was set for six, but it wouldn’t be needed this morning. Nor had it been needed for the past week. Harry had been waking up early with his body humming in need for the past four months— since the House Unity Spell went awry. He was too agitated to lie in bed waiting for the clock to chime six.
"And so I’m sure you see the urgency in telling you now," McGonagall said. "I think you need time to adjust to this new situation and think about your marriage."
But not as sore as yours is going to be today.
"Something happen?" Harry asked as he hung his cloak over the back of the chair and sat down. A tray of beverages floated over to the table. While the beer looked tempting, he knew every eye would notice and every tongue would cluck to its nearest neighbour that Harry Potter was drinking on the job. There were moments being Head Auror was bothersome. He selected a Butterbeer.
Harry wasn't sure Dumbledore was right about Draco's father, but he could see that he might be right about Bellatrix Lestrange.  Harry detested her and Draco did his best to keep them apart when on rare occasions Harry visited the Manor.
"Yes, Harry, Voldemort did this, and, I
"So what are you going to do with note?"
Harry had so many questions he wanted to ask, but there was sadness to Teddy's tone.  He hadn't heard it since Andromeda had passed away two years prior.  "What did you want to change, Teddy?" Harry asked.
"It's a cage," Harry said.
Harry reluctantly held out his left hand.  The book was too light.  It felt like he was holding a handful of feathers.  On the cover was one word engraved in the leather, it was barely legible.
"Hedwig," Harry said and put his arm foreword for her to perch on.
There was a final vision to be played out.  As Harry and Draco sat stunned at all they had seen and experienced, Hedwig moved back to the centre.  The floor swirled around her.  Harry went to reach for her but she looked at him sternly.  He knew that look and let her do what she needed to do.  There were images of her in all of her colours; she had come into her magical existence as a young snowy owl.  A witch, one that looked somewhat familiar to Harry because of her piercing blue eyes, cast spells on the bird.  The magic was Dark, but she only wanted it for good.  The witch would just go back a few years, to the one where her daughter was beautiful and innocent, one where she was whole.  One where Percival would still be home.
"Ah, Potter," a higher pitched voice than Draco's said.  "I'm so pleased you came down here on your own.  I hear others in the tunnel, friends of yours?"
The little owl woke from the branch and hooted loudly.  To Harry's amazement the floor of the cage began to swirl.  It appeared to be like a Pensieve but he didn't feel the pull drawing him in, instead he watched from above.  A scene appeared.  One he knew well.  It was obviously September first.  The Hogwarts train was bellowing smoke as it waited for its passengers, students with their pets, to board.  Steam from the train filled Harry's view and made the scene hazy.  He squinted and tried looking for himself and for Draco.  Then as if someone had took a cloth and wiped a dirty window clean he saw someone; a tall boy with blue hair.  He was laughing with an older girl who looked to be still a student and then they disappeared around a corner.  Harry knew that must be Teddy; the one who sent him the Tell-Tale Owl.  He wondered what the scene had to do with Draco when he heard Ron's voice and then saw Hermione Granger and two kids in tow; obviously they were married and had two children.  He couldn't imagine it.  They'd fought since the first day of their first year.  And then he saw a something that he knew would haunt him forever.  His stomach dropped.  He was with Ginny Weasley.  They were married too, but, then he felt an overwhelming joy. "I have children.  I have children.  Albus Severus," Harry said somehow knowing the boy's name and his siblings: James Sirius and Lily Luna.  And then he caught something in his peripheral vision.  His focus switched to across the crowded platform.  He saw the familiar swath of blond hair.  Draco looked stunning, but then he saw a younger boy.  "Scorpius,"   Harry whispered.  The scene went blank.
Harry shook his head.  "Not yet," he said and turned on his side.  The cat made a few circles on the bedding and then curled up next to him.  "Good Merlin," Harry whispered.
Harry didn't want to see it but then he was forced to.  Dumbledore was at his Pensieve going over details. He was at a loss.  He knew something was wrong.  Then he pulled a memory out, it was of the owl.  He called for her by the name of Ariana and she appeared.  She held no answers.   He searched his desk for the note she once brought to him and found it.  There was a cage drawn on it.  Teddy had drawn it.  Dumbledore laughed in triumph and then disappeared from the scene.  He was in the cage.  He paced in circles before sitting down cross-legged for what seemed to be hours.  In frustration he yelled out, "What did I miss, what did I know in the other timeline?"
" Draco said and to Harry's surprise Hermione Granger stepped in wearing her Ravenclaw robes decorated with her Head Girl insignia.
The whole group startled when a crowd of unruly teenagers came in the door yelling for cake and more presents.
Harry smiled.  He let his hand slide down Teddy's shoulder before bringing it back to his desk, picking up a picture.  It was a picture of the original Order of the Phoenix; One where he usually stared at to see his parents and his godfather, Sirius.  It was over the years of looking at it that he noticed special looks between Sirius and Remus.  He was very sure they had been in love.  It didn't surprise him. "I'm not sure your father and mother would have got together, Teddy.  I think Sirius and Remus were a couple."
Harry laughed.  "No, that's not what I had in mind.  I was actually thinking that we might make some kind of peace."
Harry searched the shelves in the kitchen for something that Malfoy might like.  He settled on a bottle of Firewhisky Kingsley had given him at his retirement.  He assumed it would be good.  He grabbed two shot glasses and Apparated back to his room.  For an instant he thought maybe it was the wrong room until his eyes adjusted to the change in lighting.  A single candle burned from the bedside table on what was now Draco's side, as Draco was now in his bed, sitting up.  The curtains were drawn open and a view of Muggle London sparkled in the distance. Harry usually had the drapes closed, a habit from being Head Auror.  You never wanted anyone to see you through a window before you saw them, or before the Protection charms activated.  He decided right then that he would always keep them open.
"Hmmm?" Draco mumbled from a half conscious state.
Harry paused. He didn’t have a simple answer; it was more of a feeling. With the bond, he’d learned to pay attention to what his instincts told him. "Because, Hermione, we’re married now. It’s okay. Just leave it."
Teddy grabbed the picture from Harry's hand and stared at it intently.  "Ohhhhh, oh, I hadn't thought of that," he said and began to chuckle.  "Well, it's obvious from the note that your life would have been quite different too."
"Wow!" Draco said and joined Harry in laughter.
"And you, Potter?  When did you come out of the cupboard?"
Pansy frowned at him.  "Now what in the hell would you want to do that for?  I thought you came to some semblance of a truce by just not talking to each other."
Nanna cackled almost uncontrollably.  "At least —at least Walburga and Orion were inventive.  I mean a toothpick is just —just so mundane."
Hedwig pecked his hand, getting his attention.  She picked up the blue feather and hopped to the centre, letting it fall.
Harry glared Draco, not approving of his tone.
"In court. The Zabini-Jorgenson case is running long."
"You did it!" Draco said with exhilaration.  "You fucking did it!  You had the bollocks just to end it.  To make sure that Voldemort was truly was dead.
"Oh, speaking of the Dursleys," Harry's grandmother said as she shuffled over to the table with a plate covered in back bacon, "A tiny package arrived this morning from them.  I added it to the others."
"I want to stay married," Harry blurted out.
Draco turned his hand over and squeezed Harry's hand now in his.  "I've been told I'm pretty decent."
It was the 4
~~~oOo~~~
As they reached 2002, the first photographs with Harry came and the handwriting changed from Narcissa’s to Harry’s. In some of them Draco looked flustered and almost like back in school, young, snarly and energetic. But he smiled more and even laughed on those. In 2003 Andromeda, Hermione and Ron started to appear more often. A whole page was dedicated to Harry’s 23
“Just take a seat, I tell Hermione you’re here and she’ll be right with you,” Molly said and vanished in the group of Weasley family members.
~~~oOo~~~
“Perfectly behaved, I see,” he murmured and took a sip of his tea.
After dinner the mood became comfortable in the burrow. Charlie had a blast playing with Teddy and entertaining him.
~~~oOo~~~
“And… what are you doing?” he asked.
“Mr Malfoy?” Robards asked after finishing a monologue Draco hadn’t paid attention to, “You’re alright?”
“What were the houses at Hogwarts again?” she asked.
“Well, why don’t we sit down?” Narcissa asked, “I’ve prepared a delicious cake and we recently got a very good tea.”
Draco turned another page and they entered the year 2000 and pictures of Teddy sleeping on his chest came up or pictures dubbed ‘
“Oh, because you’ve named it first,” she explained.
“Not as quickly as you, I’d say,” he replied.
“Damn it,” moaned Draco when he put on his coat. “My back kills me.”
They entered the classroom and Mrs Andrews closed the door behind them. Draco sat down on a tiny chair next to Teddy. The boy was very quiet and his hair was almost white.
Harry hunkered down beside him. Draco had his sleeves up and Harry saw the mark.
“-now,” he finished his sentence and ran off.
“I guess so…” she muttered. “But if it makes you feel better, Spike seems to like you.”
“Have fun,” she said and quickly added before he left. “Have you registered her already?”
Draco signed, avoided the big, catty grin Mallard had, took Cassiopeia’s cage again and left the office as fast as possible. In the hallway he almost bumped into a tall man, who too carried a bird cage.
“Mr and Mrs Granger, nice to see you again after such a long time,” Harry greeted them and shook their hands.
“It’s only getting better when they are about two,” commented Draco. “But I guess, it’ll be only truly better, when… probably never. Parents always worry their children.”
Ron glanced very surprised at Draco and asked him, if he really meant that. The blond just smiled knowingly and nodded.
This time successful he jumped off his chair and stared at the young woman, “Bloody hell! What was that about?”
Teddy looked up and his eyes widened, “Wow, you look amazing!”
The Jarvey jumped onto the table and strong hands grabbed the back of Draco’s stumbling chair.
Draco smiled, said his goodbyes and hung up. He gave the phone back to Ackles and presented her the mirror-stone.
He walked quickly toward the department of Law Enforcement and knocked onto the office door of the deputy head. Luckily, Hermione was in and he could enter. The young woman sat at her desk, going through some forms. She was stunned to see her friend again, much earlier than she had expected and got up to greet him. When she was standing her belly was already good to see. When Draco remembered it correctly, the due date was at the end of October. So barely two months were left.
Harry laughed. "It's midnight, Draco. I'm not touching you until you've had your seven."
Harry removed the cloak, it wasn't necessary anymore.  "I don't know who it is," he said, hoping this thing who was possessing Draco's body would believe him.
"Teddy is the one who found the scroll I showed you.  He found it up here."
Dumbledore didn't smile at Harry's comment.  "No she won't.  She knows better but I'm more worried about you telling a friend."
The Christmas tree was the smallest one he'd had since he was in Auror training.  It sat on a table in the centre of the bay windows facing the street.  From the outside, it looked warm and charming, but inside it only reminded him how lonely he was.  The kids were at the Burrow with Ginny tonight.  He was invited, but it felt much too odd to be there on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  He would go for Christmas dinner, Mollie insisted, and to be honest, it didn't take much insistence.  Harry positioned the presents under the tree, there seemed to be too few.  He remembered fondly back to when the room was filled with presents and the kids and their cousins had gone wild with paper and ribbons.  Now, however, even the fairy lights seemed less twinkly.
Draco’s body was dragged backwards by seemingly invisible hands, and handily plopped back into the chair next to Harry.
"Probably another paper-clip," Harry mumbled as a teapot poured the steaming liquid into his cup.  Milk and sugar were added.  He looked around to see who had done it for him.  His grandmother gave him a wink as she glanced around to see what was left to bring over to the table.  The door of the cast-iron stove burst open and pans of white bread landed on the counter and soon thick slices slathered in butter joined the rest of the morning selections.  Harry loved his grandmother's breakfasts.  His parents cooked wonderful meals, but his Nanna Potter's foods were what he missed most when at Hogwarts.  From her mother she'd learned to cook the Muggle way, which she insisted on doing when baking.  She said this method added love.  Harry winked back at her.  As her only grandchild, she duly spoiled him and Harry adored every moment of it.  He noticed her back was getting more bent as the years progressed.  When not gardening in the yard, she could be found in her laboratory leaning over her cauldron brewing up potions and elixirs to be sold throughout the world.
It had been Draco’s first rule when they returned from their honeymoon; Harry wasn’t to touch him before six in the morning. Draco needed at least seven hours of sleep, and while Harry agreed that Draco was a terror without it, it annoyed the hell out of him that Draco had set up this restriction. It made him feel like he was a pervert. It wasn’t like Harry was the only one who was insatiable, after all. It was just that Draco could go a bit longer for some reason. And whatever that reason was, it pissed Harry off.
"I think we should go before we fall out of the sky," Draco said, bringing Harry out of his happy daze.  Harry looked around.  The flowered vines were withering and the cage bars were bending.  Harry put his other arm around Draco's shoulder and Apparated all of them out of there.
The sun began to set over the trees lining the west side of the lake.  The boys turned to each other and kissed.  It was soft and it was simple and that was it.  From then on the scenes were mainly of them.  They both laughed as Harry learned to become a cat and how Draco brought the cat with him into the Slytherin common room and dorm, which was strictly forbidden.  There were also many scenes of Harry doing detention for playing pranks on students from every house.  Sirius and he would write back and forth coming up with plans.
"Lily, the boy said his parents were both dead and that you and James were also."
"Good to see that the honeymoon isn’t over," she said as she shooed him towards his conference room door. "I was beginning to worry since you’ve been in early all week."
Draco smiled again.  "Very wise choice, Harry Potter, very wise.  Draco knows what to do.  He's been very faithful these past few months.
Draco,
"The third receptacle was a cup belonging to Helga Hufflepuff.  It was in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault."
"Whoa!" Harry said when they arrived.
Harry shed more tears over a grandmother he'd never met.  He wished he'd known her in this life.  Her wisdom and unconditional love for him was sorely missed. He wondered how she had died in this life; he knew from her gravesite that it was right before that Halloween.
"We believe that Tom Riddle opened the chamber when he was at school.  Remember I told you about Moaning Myrtle in the girl's bathroom?  Well she died during that time period. Hagrid was blamed for it, which we know he didn't do it, but he doesn't have any more information than we have.  It's not called the Chamber of Secrets for nothing," Lily added with a wry grin.
Dumbledore nodded.  Harry felt relief that this knowledge wasn't his alone.
"Auror Potter, I don’t allow my guests to be tied up," McGonagall said.
"You seem pretty sure about your conclusion, Potter.  Is it your Auror deduction?"
This wasn’t what Harry had expected Draco to say. "What happened? Nobody told me anything." he said as he pulled off his cloak, letting it fall to the sofa. He needed to know how bad it was. He shook his head; this was the first time his desire had been squashed by an incident.
Dumbledore smiled.  "How very like you, Harry, to worry about the Horcruxes instead of your own well being.  Very well, we shall discuss the Horcruxes first.  I said I believed there were five, but that is conjecture based upon a scene from the other timeline.  I do know of four.  Your parents and friends and I have retrieved them and disposed of them.  There are great and fabulous stories behind each of them, which I will leave that honour for your parents to tell" Dumbledore said with a grin.  Harry could imagine the Marauders and his mother having incredible adventures in taking care of such evil tokens.
"Yes, it is good.  I have a son.  I have family and some friends.  I feel very lucky.  Love and a companionship would be brilliant but I'm not going to whinge about it."
"We should go Harry.  To someplace comfortable as the story is long, but, first you must name your owl."
"Not sure that counts as a win, Weasley," James said with a big smile.
Harry took the scroll and looked around for something else he could offer as a bribe for Draco to even speak with him.  It astounded Harry that he was even contemplating doing this.  "Desperate fool," he said as he picked up a bottle of Bubbleberry wine.  He'd never tasted it, but liked the name.  A visiting ambassador from Austria had given it to him as a gift.  He quickly found a box and did a half-decent job of gift-wrapping it properly.  He checked the silvered mirror as he wrapped the black scarf around his neck and put on his dressiest overcoat, which wasn't saying much.  A sprig of holly was added to his lapel without his doing.  He looked over to the tree and gave a small salute to the fairy shining the brightest before he Disapparated.
"Scorpius."
"And Professor Snape doesn't know?" Harry asked teasingly.  He enjoyed bugging his mother over her friendship with her childhood friend.  Snape seemed to detest Harry and was extra harsh on him in class but not in his grades.  Harry always assumed the only reason he didn't have a Troll was because Snape was afraid of losing Lily as a friend.
Harry shivered.  He wanted to hear the whole prophecy.  He'd read about them in Divination the years he took the course but never really believed in them.  For the Headmaster to put credence in one then there must be something to them after all.  But, right now, what seemed more important than the prophecy was learning about the Horcruxes.
"Harry Potter, where is Draco Malfoy's body?" the Minister asked with a hint of triumph, knowing that he had Potter right where he wanted him.  Within a few hours, the criminal young wizard would be in Azkaban and receiving the Dementor's kiss.
Harry opened the map.  "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Harry said while pointing his wand at the parchment.  His eyes then focused on the Slytherin seventh-year dorm room, a place he knew very well.  He missed hiding behind the green curtains surrounding Draco’s bed.  However even if Snape came into the room all the Head of House would find would be Draco and his black cat.  Harry smiled thinking about how long they'd fooled the whole school into thinking that Draco owned a black cat.  His attention was drawn back to the map as he watched the castle clear of the older students.  Draco's name paced the dorm room and then the Slytherin common room.  Harry walked over to his trunk and lifted the lid.  He pulled out his father's Invisibility Cloak and wrapped it around himself.  He felt a tinge of guilt over spying on Draco, but when Draco's name made its way out of the snake's lair, adrenaline overruled and Harry ran out of his own dorm room.  He clambered down stairs as he watched Draco climb up stairs.  Harry tried to keep his steps somewhat quiet as he passed a group of second-years heading to the library on the fourth floor.  He stopped on the second floor landing.  Draco was around the corner.  Harry squinted at the map, not quite believing what he was seeing.  Draco was entering a girl's bathroom.  One Harry knew was marked "Out of Order" and had been since he entered the school.  It was the one where his mother had told him Moaning Myrtle haunted.  Harry quickly made his way there.  He held his breath as he opened the door a crack and peeked in.  Draco was too involved with reading a small book to notice when Harry snuck in.
Harry's chuckle turned into an outright laugh.  "Headmaster, given how many times I've been in your office how can you say that?"
His grandmother sat down next to him and reached up to move the fringe off of his forehead.  A hint of a scar remained from the incident three days prior.  "Of course you're ready.  This is what happens when people fiddle with timelines.  Strange and horrible situations occur trying to get one world closer to the other... to the way it should be."
"And if you didn’t follow the rules, what would happen?" Hermione asked, sounding concerned as she took their lunch plates off the floating serving platter.
"That's, that's not the way it happened," Harry said flabbergasted.
"Move on?" Harry asked.  His stomach dropped and he felt nauseous.  His world was turning upside down.  "What happened?  Three weeks ago you left me a love letter."
Harry and the others stood up as Kingsley rose and said his goodbyes to the team.
He and Draco were now together—back together again.
"Well then, I shall be brief in case she changes her mind.  The owl is a harbinger letting you know that this time, this life, can be altered."
"Can I just fuck you with it on?" Harry asked as his hands went for Draco’s trousers too.
"No," Harry said, while raising his wand and extinguishing the candelabra flames. "Weekend." The late summer night was now still. He left the balcony doors open.
Harry turned to Draco.  "Might need some more of that wine."
"Headmaster, did you see the Horcrux or what it was contained in? How does this scene relate to the Horcrux?"
As he drifted off to sleep with Draco's head resting on his shoulder, a question came to his mind.
, that he looked across the table and realised he wouldn't even be considering
"Want you, too," Harry whispered as his fingers began undoing the frogs of Draco’s formal court cloak. Then he reached the white crisp shirt buttons. "How many of these are there?" Harry asked as he fumbled for a minute with the first one.
"It's called a Tell-Tale Owl.  They are extremely rare and when one is made it is a patchwork of colours.  The first time it is used to alter a timeline it loses a colour; blue is the last.  Like sunlight reflecting in the deep ocean all colours drain away but blue.  If it is used again, the final bits of magic fade away and it will come back as white, but will not be able to alter time."
Draco frowned at Harry.  "I suppose you're right, but don't think I'm this easy of a date."
Harry feigned a frown and swiped it from her hand.  The ribbon smelled like fresh linen.  The house elves at the Manor laundered like no others.  Harry loved the scent.  It reminded him of the clean crisp sheets on Draco's bed.
Harry rolled it back up and tied the silver ribbon around it.  He put it into his crimson robe pocket.  A robe he'd be wearing for the last time.  "I don't know, Teddy.  I just don't know."
Harry took a long drink and then set the glass down before it was gone too fast.  "Merry Christmas to you too, Malfoy.  But you can give me a gift."
