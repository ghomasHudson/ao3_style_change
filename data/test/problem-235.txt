“A decent definition. If someone wants to get into your head and see what you’re thinking or feeling, or wants to influence you, you have to be able to defend yourself. A shield is one way of thinking about it. Potter, you know the spell to enter another’s mind?”
Once he'd cast spells over both of them to dry their clothes and warm them up, he took in the girl's appearance. "You look like you're dressed for a party. Do you have somewhere you're supposed to be?"
Draco looked up. It did. And now, peering through the windows, he could see the traps and poisons on the shelves. The disorientation he’d felt earlier flooded back, and he leaned heavily on the doorframe to keep his footing.  "Where’s Potter?"
She nodded. "Your OWLs results and what I've heard from professors indicate that you have a strong aptitude for Potions. As I've told Harry, it's been an ongoing struggle getting Slughorn to remain through the end of the year. I do hope you won't spend your entire career angling to become a Defense professor."
That was it. “You can’t fix everything, Granger. Sometimes you just have to keep your nose out of it.” He had expected his voice to come burning from his mouth, but even he had to acknowledge he just sounded sad.
Draco noted that this was one of the most miserably awkward moments he had ever participated in. If he apparated to the manor right now, he could certainly claim that he’d done the spell in self defence. Potter was trying to kill him. If he didn’t say something, the Weasleys would all suspect that there’d been something--that Potter had--
“You’d have to be. You were living with Voldemort. He would have seen your doubts. He wouldn’t have trusted you with--”
There was a moment of even more startled silence before Ron, and then Pansy, and then Hermione started laughing, too.
Someone at the 8th year table frowned. “I feel sorry for the kids. They shouldn’t be forced into that house. Especially if they’re muggle-raised.”
Also attached, because Malfoy's Eagle owl could handle the weight and because Harry hoped Draco would want to use it: The Marauder's map.
"I suppose you better run along and tell all your friends the news," Lockhart offered, still smiling so wide that his face looked ready to crack in half. "And wish them a Happy Christmas for me, won't you?"
“Come one, Lacey,” Sam said. Their hand was wrapped around Lacey’s on her wand. “Once more. Let’s see it!”
She’d done the opposite of Draco in preparing for their outing—rather than dressing up, she’d dressed down in an old robe and no makeup. Instead of casting a straightening charm on her hair, she’d left it bobbing around her ears freely. Not that either of them dared use spells on something as frivolous as their appearance anymore.
Ginny wouldn’t allow them to lose focus for long, though, and she had everyone dressed in Quidditch gear, armed with brooms, and standing on the little pitch before noon. She gathered the team--Charlie, herself, and Percy as chasers, George and Molly as beaters, Fleur as the keeper and Draco as the Seeker--into a huddle. “This is all I want for Christmas from any of you,” she said urgently. “I want to win this year.”
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco said through gritted teeth. A real Quidditch player should have been able to hold their position after a bump like that. Ginny was going to be so angry. Draco finally managed to sit fully up and stuck his legs out in front of them. His trousers were in a state. The knee had ripped out of one of them and--was he bleeding?
“For showing me how to notice my thoughts like that. I don’t think I can do any occlumency yet, but it’s helping me.”
They pelted into the corridor outside the Headmistress's office only to screech to a halt before running into McGonagall.
“Since when have you cared about that?” Draco raged. “If I beat you--when Ginny and I beat you on Christmas, you’d better be really playing.”
“What did Harry say?” Hermione asked. “I know that he’s been acting awfully obtuse, but surely this--”
Draco kept the shock from his face and his voice. “I suppose you have some rudimentary understanding, then. Does anyone know what Occlumency is?”
“What you told me,” Potter snapped, “Was that me thinking you could like me was a joke. That I’d been naive to listen to the first years and my friends, and that you wanted all of us to stay away from you.”
Now, as much of an irritation as the party planning was, he knew it was a sign the Fred and George trusted him to do it right. They would find out tomorrow if the trust was merited, but he didn’t have time to stop and worry about that. From the moment the shop opened, he had a thousand things to do. He straightened the garland and corralled the roving mistletoe into the corner. He fed the pygmy puffs and re-arranged the daydream collection, again. People never could seem to keep their hands to themselves when it came to those products.
her grandson. But he'd been the wrong Teddy, not the one that Draco read stories with at night. And Harry had been the wrong Harry, not the one who collapsed on the couch next to Draco when he’d finally gotten Maya back into bed. And the street had been the wrong street, not the one that Draco always trudged through in the cold.
It's Harry's B-day (in real life, not the fic). Happy birthday, Harry! Have a hangover and some therapy.
Back in fourth year he’d been so thrilled at the Potter Stinks badges he’d created, especially with the magic that made it so you couldn’t change the message. It was tricky spellwork, and by the time he’d finished the first batch his hair had been hanging limply out of its gelled location and his face had been flushed with effort.
“Perfect timing.” She graced them with a tight lipped smile. “I ordered your court records so we could see exactly what the language of your restriction was.”
Luckily, Potter did most of the work himself. Draco caught his eye the next morning, not meaning to make a big deal of it, just unable to keep from checking that Potter was--alright. But as soon as Potter saw Draco looking, his eyes widened and his head jerked to the left so quickly Draco thought his neck would snap. He could tell that Potter was blushing, though. He couldn’t stop the smirk. There was no way he could
People flooded into the room--schoolmates like Neville and the Greengrass sisters, shopkeepers from the menagerie and the bookstore, professors and ministry officials. And one by one, they each made their way to the piano, where Fred and George were beating out a rhythm on a laundry tub.
Then someone started applauding, and then it was like thunder. Ron hollered, and Seamus whistled. And before Draco was quite sure what was happening, the whole room was filled with people clapping and whooping.
“I don’t mean the message, Draco. I mean, doesn’t it seem like a bit much for you to go to all this work to make buttons about how much you “hate” Potter?”
Draco knew he was supposed to reply with a flippant, “You wish,” but he simply shrugged and walked stiffly to the seventh floor.
Harry grinned. There was something really excellent about the fact that Draco hadn't gotten distracted by getting a job or Harry's decision. He wanted to know that Lacey was safe. Harry had no idea what they were going to do with a twelve-year-old at Hogwarts all summer, but they could figure that out together.
Potter slammed the book shut in frustration. “You’re right. This is useless. I couldn’t learn it when it would have saved Sirius’s life, it’s not going to suddenly come to me in time to teach it to the Defense class.”
He noticed only a moment before Potter did--a Gryffindor girl in the third row with stringy blonde hair and a thin face--slam her head against her desk.
Right. A portion of the seventh floor that just-so-happened to accommodate eighth year sleeping space when it was needed. Malfoy didn’t ask for details. He knew. It kept him glued to his seat, hands balled into fists, even when Pansy spoke. “Draco. Come on. Let’s walk together.”
Draco slid to the floor next to Sam and Lacey. “You’re upset. It’s hard to do a Patronus when you’re hurt. Can anyone tell me what happened?”
Draco had to bite down some kind of fond smile. It was a sleepy, grey day outside, with fat snowflakes lazilly dusting the windowsills of the potions classroom, and Potter seemed to be dozing off.“You’re supposed to be stirring,” He forced himself to growl. “Not napping.”
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. "Look. I wish you and your sick friend good luck. But I have no desire to relive any of that, and I'm trying to enjoy Christmas Eve with my wife. It's time for you to leave."
Hopefully by the time he made it back to their rooms, everyone would be sleeping. He could get up early the next morning and set about the task of avoiding all of them for the rest of his life.
After the first rush of people died down and the kids had wound through the crowd with cookies, Ginny blew in through the door, freeing a jar of gold from her robes. “I heard we're taking up a collection. I've been saving this to get a divorce," she grinned. "If I ever decided to get married."
There were a few of the students staring at him, wide eyed and curious, others were passing notes or staring out the window. A student in the back row let out a soft snore.
"George lost out to Lockhart," Claire corrected gently. "But I think it was a relief to him. It was really hard for him to run the joke shop when Fred was gone."
His attention was jerked back to the great hall when he heard her announce: “Room 3, of boys dormitories, we’ll have Longbottom, Potter, Zabini, and Malfoy.”
Draco clenched his fists in his coat pockets. "I don't know," he muttered. "The kids have lost enough. Especially Teddy. I don't want that for any of them. It would be better--I just wish I'd never been born."
“Please, Professor!” Sam’s face was desperate. They’d seen Lacey troubled before and hadn’t reacted like this.
Draco pulled his coat around him as he walked back into the bitingly cold night. It was easy for the Weasleys to tell him not to worry. It was hard for him to listen. It might have been easier if he thought the goblins were the only ones who felt like getting rid of him would be taking out the trash.
He pulled back the blankets on the bed and tucked himself into it. Maybe he could close his eyes and be asleep before Potter and Weasley returned, probably talking about him.
Draco would rather drive his fork through his eyeball than listen to another song from the sorting hat, but it piped up in its cheery little voice all the same.
"Is that all?" George laughed, sliding from the table to stand next to Fred and sling an arm around him. "Thanks for paying us the visit, but no need to worry your handsome noggins about that one! We've been socking away our holiday money all month, and tomorrow when we're done with the Christmas Eve event, I promise you you'll have your payment."
Andromeda approached and brushed the snowflakes off Draco’s shoulders and head. "Let go of Teddy. You're squeezing him to death."
“It doesn’t matter, Granger,” he snapped. “Even if he did give the wand back, it would probably stay loyal to him anyway, since it seems they’ve become so attached to each other. And I’m not allowed to practice magic outside of the necessary anyway, so I wouldn’t want to waste a good wand on--”
Hermione frowned, “She must have--” and then broke off, as if she was trying to remember a counterexample. “Alright, but she wouldn’t like the Ministry telling her what to do. Besides, the court designated a period of four years. You leave Hogwarts after this year. There’s not going to be professors telling you what spells to cast then--how do they expect you to do magic?"
The cake was delicious, and in between bites, Harry managed to eat an apple. He noticed, distantly, that Draco and he seemed to have reversed roles. Draco took some bites of the cake and made a show of thanking everyone for it, but after that he just picked at everything, and finally Harry got impatient and stood. "See you later," Harry said to the other three, grabbing Draco's hand.
The little person waved back, then raced to the door to open it for Draco. "Welcome home! Gran was going to make me go to bed before you even got home and I said that's not fair because you promised me a story tonight."
He raised an eyebrow at her. Luna and the quidditch players surrounding Ginny looked thoroughly annoyed that he was taking her away. As soon as they'd gotten out of earshot of Ginny's friends, he muttered. "I'm sorry, it's just--Draco."
Draco hesitated. “At the latest.” He swallowed, fighting the strange weightlessness he felt at the moment, and turned to look back at Potter.
“I think you changed their mind. But while the first years were going on and on about their new hero, they started asking some--interesting questions about Patronuses.”
Draco stopped. He didn’t want to talk about it, he was still shaking, and now that the adrenaline was fading, he felt exhausted. He hadn’t slept the night before, and today had felt like at least four days. But it was Neville. Neville wasn’t doing this to make some kind of joke about how he was the least likely hero. He turned around, feeling super aware of every motion of his body.
Granger frowned. “As if the other professors don’t? Anyway, I think Harry tries to be very fair. Are you sure he was trying to rub it in? Maybe he actually wanted to help?
She lowered the book and tried to assess if anything felt different. The herbs on the floor were starting to char and burn themselves out, but other than that, everything was just the same. She got shakily to her feet and faced herself in the mirror. If the spell had worked, anything she willed would become true just virtue of her speaking it aloud.
“Lately,” Harry continued in a voice that was much more careful, “I’ve been thinking about becoming a Professor at Hogwarts. Maybe not right away. But--”
The bell over the door rang, and Draco glanced up to see several well-dressed goblins making their way inside.
Something wet and cold dripped on his nose, and Draco opened his eyes. A snowflake. The sky was full of snowflakes catching each other on their way from the sky, piling on top of each other.
Suddenly, Potter’s eyes narrowed, and he jumped from his seat, all energy.  “I’m pants at it! I would never be able to teach the first-years--but I bet someone who was really good at Occlumency could.”
Pansy used her elbow like a knife in his rib. “He means thank you, Professor Hagrid. He’s just nervous.”
“Exactly,” Hermione agreed, flipping a page. “I’m going to file an appeal at the end of next week, so I need to know the precedent. Did you get my note last night?”
Once they had settled in with a cozy stack of books and parchments in front of them, several of the Slytherins walked by flashing their “Potter Stinks” badges. Harry glared at Malfoy. “I do not appreciate that.”
Neville had been correct, however, at guessing the stage the party would be in. Seamus and Dean were making out in the corner, and some of the eighth years had snuck off to more secluded locations for similar activities. Most of the others were flopped on the couches or the floor, swigging what was left in their cups.
“Yes. Thoughts. Feelings. Memories. My head is full of them, of course. If you walked in here and found nothing, you would know I have something to hide. I’m not hiding my thoughts, I just don’t keep any of them as pets. They’re all filed away. Neatly.”
He couldn’t think too much about it. He’d hold back, he’d stop himself. He’d remember his promise to never cast the spell again. Draco flipped his wand into position, closed his eyes, and thought of Potter. And Hermione. And Ron. And Pansy. He thought of all the moments that had been unexpectedly full of laughter and warmth this year when he’d thought the rest of this life would be survival.
Harry realized that he'd been quietly panicking since the moment that he realized it was Draco's birthday, and finally he was starting to settle. Finally.
"Of course I am," Draco said, looking shocked. "I mean. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad you could see what a mutually beneficial arrangement..." He backtracked when he saw McGonagall's expression. "I'm grateful for the opportunity."
Draco looked into Sam’s eyes. “You found help for Lacey and you refused to leave her side. You must care about her a lot.”
That little outburst got Potter to look over his way, but only for a second, taking in him and the wand, and then turning back to Finnegan.
Of course, he'd never intended to show up at Potter's home. The stories of the kids were more than enough. But Potter was persistent, and Draco made the mistake of thinking if he went once, Potter would shut up about it. But somehow (Draco knew exactly how. It was because he'd read stories with the little whelps and done shadow puppets to get one of them to stop crying when it was time for bed.) one invite had turned into more, and now he was over there once or twice a week.
"Put them in the safe," George instructed Draco. "With some mood music. And a duplication charm, if you can swing it."
For a moment Draco wanted to explain. Or beg. Grovel. But the moment he opened his mouth, he started shaking from his toes to his teeth. Breath raced in and out of his mouth, and he felt his heart fluttering in his chest like a snitch in his fist.
“Mr. Malfoy is your teacher today Sam. If you have questions about what we’re learning, you can ask. Otherwise, wait until the end of class.”
Andromeda cut a thick slice of meat pie and poured a cup of tea for Draco. "You eat all of that," she said. "You've been working too hard."
He felt an odd rush of relief at the idea that the girls were playing some political game rather than becoming best friends, but it was halted when Pansy added, “It’s still so quiet in our room.” She was picking apart her roll more than eating it.
Draco-as-Harry was reading through scenarios where somebody could be using a dark disguise and leading the students through a discussion of how they'd figure out the disguise.
Well. There was only one term left. He could hide from Potter for the next five and a half months, and then they’d never have to see each other again. It was the only way forward.
That was sufficient to remind Draco of the panic, but he tried to stay grounded. “Yes. You said you’d figured something out
The sharp edge of the words caught Harry, and he was hit with a memory of Fred and George leaving in a blaze of glory. But he couldn't deny that the pen was more mischief than evil. He put it into a pile on the desk of things that were safe enough to keep.
Harry set down his fork, and Draco felt another punch to the gut as he took in the scene. Harry was sitting across the table from a very pregnant Ginny Weasley. They both looked charming and shocked in the candlelight.
He stepped back to look at all of them just as an obnoxious voice called out behind him, "Look at that little Weasley shack. Trying to get people to pity them by parading orphans around. Just the kind of thing they would try. It really is a shame. Those boys could have amounted to something if they didn’t insist on associating with garbage.”
“Teach it to the Defense class?” Draco echoed. He was losing his disaffected pose, since now he was openly staring. Potter was more cracked than he’d thought. Occlumency had never been taught at Hogwarts, as far as he knew, and certainly not by an overworked student-professor. “Potter, you don’t have to teach Occlumency,” he said slowly. He’d thought Potter wanted to master Occlumency to help with the nightmares. Not this.
Draco winced, then tried to cover it. First of all, who owned up to living in a Burrow? Second, he was learning to tolerate one ginger hanging around at all times, but hanging around eight? Nine? How many Weasleys were there, anyway? He’d snap.
"This is hardly dark, Potter. Honestly, I bet one of those Weasley boys left it here as a joke when they were still at school."
Of course it was, but it was also the edge they had on Lockhart's Laughs. Both stores were hosting a meet and greet with Santa on Christmas Eve, but Weasley's also had Harry Potter. "You asked what you could do to help the shop out," Draco said. "And this is definitely it."
He held his hands up, wandless. All other factors aside, it would be hard to explain using magic on first-years to the ministry. “I didn’t do anything to Lacey. Her own mind was hurting her.” He could recognize that well enough, and he had no doubt there were other kids in the class who at least recognized some part of it. “There are clearly some things in Lacey’s mind that are hard to face, and she might need help with that. But that’s where really defending yourself against the dark arts starts. Besides. I saw what the other first years can do yesterday. I’m not likely to take a whole class of you on, head-to-head.”
Before they could continue the conversation, Slughorn walked in, and Draco leaned back in defeat. He’d known that Slughorn was slated to return but had been hoping that someone else would appear in time. Draco hadn’t hated Slughorn as much as not-Mad-Eye Moody, but the humiliation of being caught at Slughorn’s dinner party had been horrifying. Slughorn thought nothing of him, and it made Draco feel like he was always straining. He’d been good at potions once, but now he wondered if that had been more about having Snape as his Professor than actually having an aptitude for the subject. Everything had fallen apart sixth year. And his potions performance had been the least of it.
Draco frowned at Harry. "If you're going to set it up like this is more exciting than Quidditch, why don't you tell them?"
“I know he’s thick,” Granger frowned. “But I’m sure he was trying to give it back to you.  What did he do?”
Potter went around the classroom, guiding their wandwork and encouraging them to focus on their memories, and Draco watched as student after student cast more realistic looking Patronuses. The best he’d gotten from his wand was a trickle of white smoke. Even Pansy had a wobbly-legged cat circling her wand.
"Which one of us has seen into their brains? Devon Hariot can't stand you, but to most of the kids in your classes, you're not just the wizard that saved the world from Voldemort, you're the one who teaches them how to protect themselves and take care of their friends."
He wasn't thinking of going anywhere in particular. Panicked thoughts kept crowding out any sense of plan or direction, but when he became aware of his surroundings, his feet had led the way into the middle of a bridge. Not one of the larger, fancier bridges of the city, which were undoubtedly crowded with tourists and couples proposing.
Harry felt like his feet were flying over the grounds toward the Quidditch stands, and Draco was laughing at his side, huffing as he tried to keep up. "Slow down, Potter."
Hermione tried to tune them out and complete her arithmancy, but it wasn’t just Harry and Malfoy she had to ignore. Half the castle seemed to be coming through to gawk at the Slytherin and Gryffindor holding hands under the table. At one point, a group of Durmstrang students bumbled into the room and made for the tables behind the new couple. But when they tried to pass Hermione, they stopped in the exact way that Professor Moody had during class, as though they’d run into an invisible wall.
The next day at breakfast, Hermione sat in her oft-occupied spot next to Pansy, fresh-faced and serious. She glanced at the crowded end of the table, where Ron and Harry were hovering, undecided.
When the first years streamed into the class, Draco-as-Harry bounced on the balls of his feet by the door, greeting them, and Harry-as-Draco stood at the front of the classroom, waiting for them all to take their seats.
Draco opened his mouth, but Hermione cut him off. “Harry, why were you happy when you came to talk to Draco?”
Ron looked significantly less enthusiastic than Potter, but he was the one who spoke. “I’ve just heard back from my mother,” he offered. “And she said it was alright with her. So. You’re officially invited to the Burrow for Christmas this year.”
Draco looked out the window to make sure that it was still snowing. To make sure that no higher power had heard his inner plea and decided to interfere with Harry.
Harry gave a short snort of a laugh. Maybe he wasn't good at hiding what a mess he was, but there were plenty of people who had overlooked it. He turned around, and he could see the fury building on Draco's face. Harry turned around properly to face him.
You said that it scares you, how much time is in front of us. It scares me too. Merlin, I thought I was done. I walked into the forest, and I thought, this is the measure of who I am: every decision I've made so far. Every action I've taken and everything I left undone, and then I died, and it was true. I was done. All the fight was over.
Draco had more questions, but Kingsley was practically forcing him in through the door at the moment.
They had their list of school supplies for their eighth year. They had a sufficient but not extravagant amount of money to cover all expenses. They had rehearsed which stores they were going to go into first, and second, and last, and the two had planned to go early on a Thursday morning to avoid as much of the crowd as possible.
George waved his words away before Draco had even finished. "You're not getting out of work that easily. Especially not this close to the holidays! Who would open the store in the morning?" He shuddered. "Besides. No one's going to care about that. We'll have Harry come down to the store a few times this week and remind everyone who he really supports. No one's going to pay attention to this."
“And that’s what you’re going to do for your own minds,” Draco explained, not looking at Potter. “We start by finding the thoughts give us the most trouble.”
Draco blinked, and the storm in his eyes was gone. "So you're not going to take it? I don't want to scare you away from the school. I don't actually want to fight you for the job. Not that I could win, if you wanted it"
"These are just going to attract wrackspurts," she said. "And these kids already have enough trouble with wrackspurts. Don't you have anything blue? We could balance it out with blue."
Draco responded like Draco. His chin lifted a fraction of an inch and his nostrils narrowed, but he gave no other sign that he'd even heard the headmistress. Harry opened his mouth to object. He'd been too quiet before, he hadn't explained to McGonagall just how much of the work Draco actually did with the class. he hadn't told her about how kids stopped Draco in the corridors to thank him, or--
How was she even speaking at this point? How long had she been fighting this transformation? “Merlin, yes, Lacey. You do yours too.”
"Merlin, Hermione," Harry snapped. "How do you not understand this? How do you not see this? It's not the teaching, it's the living."
“Professor,” piped up one of the Slytherins. “We found her in the hallway, and she was hitting her head again, talking to herself. We stopped and tried to tell her it was just a thought.”
"Potter," Draco said, "You can't complain about Luna. You wouldn't have survived this long without her help"
Hagrid looked from Ron to Hermione in a manner that made Hermione very sure they’d been discussing her. “I was looking for you,” she frowned.
While he was kneeling, the bell over the door rang, and multiple pairs of shoes entered the room. Draco didn’t look. He placed his clenched hand on the table and dropped the coins on the counter.
He leaned over and whispered in Draco's ears, and it might have come out as sort of a growl because he was feeling pretty highly stressed.
Potter's crew of children marched up to the joke shop only fifteen minutes after ten the next morning. Draco thought that was decent, all things considered, but Potter was looking ragged for it. Luna was with them, to keep the kids in line while Potter was available for photos. As great as Luna was with the kids, keeping them in line wasn't one of her strong suits.
Pansy sat up and sent Draco a very serious frown. “Draco, I would appreciate it if you could actually act like a Slytherin for about five minutes and take advantage of the fame.”
But something he’d said had lit a spark in Potter’s eyes. “That’s it!” he grinned. “You don’t have a happy enough memory. We’ll make a happy memory.”
The girl, who had somehow gotten ahead of him and was standing at the edge of the road, called down, "I don't always make the smartest choice in a pinch. But I do always take action."
She couldn't seem to figure out what to say, so Harry plowed on. "Do you know the story of the Deathly Hallows? You're not from a magical family, are you? It's one of the stories that some Wizarding kids grow up with, but it's not something they touch on at Hogwarts."
Draco thought of the way Fred watched him from the corner of his eyes, and his heart sank. He knew the Aurors would never believe him, but he couldn’t even expect the Weasleys to be on his side. He couldn't even remember what had happened, himself.
“Let’s go to the common room.” Potter’s voice piped up. “The girls wanted to plan some kind of event for later this week.”
When Potter interrupted Draco’s sleep for the third time, he was standing at Potter’s bedside before the boy woke up. Of course they’d said Neville was supposed to be the one to talk Potter down from these little episodes,  but Neville was snoring. Loudly.
He turned on his heal and sprinted out of the bank. Or he attempted a sprint and managed to wobble out, still dizzy and disoriented.
With every step he took, Draco felt panic pounding in his heart. The Aurors might already be on his tail.
Draco sat up suddenly, on his elbow. “Potter, what are you going to do once we’re done with school?”
“They’re so--Malfoy, I am sorry. I was sorry as soon as I saw what the spell did. I never meant to hurt you this badly."
“He’s trying to get some sleep,” Draco called from his bed. “And would like you to shut up, Potter.”
100,000 thanks to the readers, especially everyone who has left comments and kudos. Life is such an interesting mess right now.
Every eighth year in the school was perched on the couches and armchairs in the Common Room when Draco walked inside, and he could feel every pair of eyes on him. Hermione, Ron, and Pansy had already made it back to the room, and they were staring at him as silently as everyone else.  He glanced up, feeling flustered, and then turned away quickly and tried to make it to his bedroom before any of them said anything.
Draco almost never looked right at Harry when he first came into the joke shop. And when he came to visit the home, he was usually busy talking with the kids instead of looking at Harry's face. He didn't have much to compare this moment to. The warmth that flooded his face and the way his eyes came alight. "Draco."
Draco, apparently tired of babbling in half-sentences, closed his mouth, and Harry had to nudge him. "Draco, are you going to take the position?"
A muzzle materialized, and two flicking ears, a long, scrawny neck, reedy legs, and a tail. A horse. Lacey’s horse Patronus whinnied and trotted in a little circle. Looking for work. Looking for whatever she needed to defend Lacey from.
The Headmistress raised one eyebrow. "Professor Slughorn said all your recent work was up to scratch."
Draco wished they would feed the students while they waited for the sorting ceremony to end, but there was nothing to do to occupy his hands, which were damp and clammy, and his mouth, which was way too dry, except sip the pumpkin juice again.
Friday afternoon dawned on a Malfoy that had dark bags under his eyes and absolutely no sleep in his recent history. They didn’t have to leave too early for the hearing, since they’d been given permission to apparate to the Ministry. But Draco was still at the table the moment the first dishes materialized, staring that them through bloodshot eyes. Eating something seemed like a good idea, but actually eating anything seemed impossible in this moment.
As they crunched through the snow, Hermione was full of last minute advice, like “Draco, please don’t let them goad you into saying anything pretentious and terrible,” and “Pansy, you have to sit up and look at them. They’re the ones who are generally nincompoops about laws and ethics, and they’ve been doing it much longer than any of us.”
They were making Veritaserum, which the ministry had been deeply in need of ever since the end of the war. There’d been a lot of it used in the months that followed. Not that this looked Ministry grade. Slughorn swirled the vial suspiciously. “It looks a bit--gloopy. Are you sure you stirred the whole time?”
No one had said it right out. Obsession. Unhealthy interest. Did they think he had some sort of--schoolboy crush on Potter? The idea was… difficult to reject. Or rather, it was easy to reject, but the moment it had entered his mind, it had been difficult to erase entirely.
Oops. He hadn’t planned to have venom dripping from every word like that, but it was too late, and Pansy had certainly felt the sting.
It would also be nice if he had saved some of his floo powder for the coldest days of the year instead of squandering it in October when it had been raining but otherwise passable. Fred and George hollered at him every time he walked home, saying there was a tub of floo powder by the fireplace. But it was the businesses powder, and it was expensive. They lived farther and needed to use it more than he did. It felt like a small way to make up for all the money that he cost them.
How was it possible that Draco had been waiting hours for Harry to walk through the door, and now Harry had annoyed him in seconds? “You’re the only person who expects you to be everywhere anyone could be in danger. You’ve got to learn that you can’t save everyone.”
And Potter was right. Even if it was hard to take him seriously with ink on his face. If they really wanted to defend against the dark--arts or otherwise--the only place to start was in their own minds.
Outside the window, it rained steadily on the Quidditch players flying over the pitch. The trees in the forbidden forest were a kaleidoscope of jewel tones. In the eighth year common room, there was a fire burning in the hearth, and the warmth had lured Draco out of his room to study in a chair by the window.
The other team featured Ron as the Keeper and Harry as the Seeker, of course. Bill and one of his friends from work
She smiled. "I know the story. I happen to really like reading, especially stories that make me think about how people are. The Deathly Hallows is a good story for that. Is that related to what you said about feeling like a ghost?"
Blessedly, Dumbledore was walking through the corridor just outside his office when the four of them ran up to the door.
“Sorry,” Potter answered. It was a wonder in itself that Harry didn’t snap back some kind of smart response. Maybe it had to do with the way Draco spoke--could Harry hear concern in his voice? “I was…”
“They sent her home over the holidays. Lacey. She was at home with the family that tells her that she’s always causing a scene and she’s got to control herself and not act crazy. The family that tells her she’s got something evil inside of her, something that makes her bad.”
Draco returned to brushing his teeth and tried to sound casual. “The ministry wasn’t very specific about what was considered unnecessary magic. I’m allowed to use magic for class."
“I’m sure it’s not your fault, Potter. Your skill as a teacher will be legendary as soon as people figure out what you’ve done with the first years. Sometimes you just get a student who can’t learn.”
Draco allowed the smug look to overtake his face. There. Duty done, he’d told the other members of the Golden Trio, and they could handle it from here. He took a large spoonful of potatoes.
If Draco had felt unsteady at the beginning of the conversation, it was nothing compared to how he felt now. He tried to organize his own thoughts:
It was a bad night. There had been so many okay nights lately that the badness of it grabbed Harry and shook him hard. This time the nightmare was Colin Creevey, laying destroyed in the Great Hall. He'd been a good fighter. A good student. In the end, none of it had protected him.
He was saved by the flutter of owls in the Great Hall, and a great grey owl swept over their table, dropping a large parcel at Hermione’s hand.
Draco was still busy storing away that reaction of joy, so he hadn't braced himself at all for the moment that Harry threw his arms around Draco, smashing Draco’s cheek into his damp, scratchy scarf. "You're here."
It had made him an expert on quieting the thoughts before they grew into an issue too big to handle. It had made him impervious to his father’s cold stare and even Voldemort’s searching eyes when it came to those kinds of secrets. There was nothing to find because he’d quieted his mind before it even put the thought to words. There was no secret to keep. That was the whole key to Occlumency.
The person who was probably Teddy--today with short blond hair and a pointy chin, looking like a younger brother of Draco-- noticed Draco first. He came running across the room to launch himself at Draco’s legs.
Apparently it didn’t matter if she’d heard the instructions, because the moment Snape instructed them to get started, Ron began chopping and adding ingredients with a confidence Hermione had never seen.
mentioned how hot he found it when Malfoy cast spells like this. Naturally, smoothly. Like breathing. It was different from the focused way that Hermione did magic, or the hopeful way that Ron tossed out spells. Draco's magic was impatient and taken-for-granted and entirely Draco.
Potter frowned. “Everyone’s busy. Trying to fix things. McGonagall’s at the Ministry nearly every day working with them on revising some of the legal policies. There are a lot of posts that need covering. Defense isn’t the only class that--”
She seemed to know he was trying to help, because she didn't fight him off, and soon both of them broke the surface, where she gasped and spluttered. The river had carried them some distance from the bridge, and it was just going to go on carrying them through London unless they got out. Draco nodded toward the shore, the girl nodded grimly, and the two of them thrashed their way out of the current.
Hermione chimed in. “And they were all piling onto each other to tell him how they’d already tried things they learned from class. And in the end, they all cast their Patronuses, even the girl who was transforming."
"Just curious, hmm. I'll race you to the room. If I get there first, you have to share whatever sugary treats your mom sent you today."
“Excuse me.” It was Hermione’s voice. They’d followed Draco up the steps, and he felt a rush of relief. “You said you need the headmistress? We’ll send a Patronus."
“You have the other houses tomorrow, right? I’ll see you then.” It was a ridiculous exit line. They shared a bedroom. Draco kicked himself as he swept out of the room.
Draco was still on the floor, so he helped Lacey to her feet. She was still shivering and bleeding from her nose, but she was also solid and alert. As they made their way down the stairs, Lacey whispered, “Professor Malfoy, what did I do?”
Harry must have looked stricken. His face must have been doing a thing, because Draco stumbled over his words.
Neville squinted at his own writing, then struck a line. “Good. I’d be doing a piss-poor job of that.”
Potter made a strangled sound, and Draco eyed him sideways, but Potter’s jaw and eyes were clenched. Draco wondered if it brought back memories of Snape’s death, being here. Potter had seen the whole thing, and hadn’t been able to do anything to save him. For a hero that must be difficult.
"Many people find a lot of meaning and satisfaction in their jobs. Graduating from school and deciding on a career path is an exciting rite of passage. But you have choices, Harry. Don't make this decision because you feel like you owe something." She glanced at the clock and leaned forward in her chair. "Now, we changed your appointment to an earlier time today so you could attend the last Quidditch match. You better head back to the castle--I know how crowded the stands can get."
“Of course, sir,” Potter answered quickly. He’d apparently not learned the lesson etched into his arm about not telling lies.
He swallowed. Maybe this was some Christmas tradition he knew nothing about, or they'd decided to put the kids to bed early and have a very quiet, very dark celebration. He knocked sharply.
Potter ignored Weasley and walked over to the Slytherin table, where the first years were pouting and everyone else was starting to look nearly as upset. Potter squatted down beside the table and started speaking. Draco couldn’t even hear his tone from here—but after a few minutes, the littlest Slytherins started to perk up.
Hermione set down her muffin, feeling the bite she’d taken turn to stone in her stomach. This again. Why was it so hard for Ron to imagine that anyone could want to take Hermione to a dance?
On the afternoon of Christmas Eve, their last-minute strategy session was interrupted by just such a game. And when the snitch glinted in the dying afternoon light, Draco streaked toward it. Potter was closer, he’d easily bump Draco aside and claim the snitch. Still, Draco flattened himself to the borrowed broom, hoping that the head start could carry him.
Harry shot an un-sticking charm at the cupboard, and finally the door opened. The smell almost overpowered Harry. He wondered how much of being an Auror was sorting through dark lairs like this. He wondered how much of being a
"Why don't you just pay us everything you have now," one of the goblins suggested, "And then you won't be months behind."
Oh. Did that mean lessons were over now? Potter hadn’t said it exactly, but undoubtedly Draco’s involvement had something to do with her displeasure.
Draco poked at his eggs. He’d remembered very little of the wording, but he had remembered the threat of Azkaban, which weighed on the tip of his wand every time he held it.
"I suppose you'll want to run again," Draco huffed, but by the time he'd finished, Harry was already past him and halfway out the door. Draco might complain about running, but he was fast. Harry needed the head start.
“I’m still going to do it, though. She didn’t tell me not to. And she won’t tell me what they’re going to do for Lacey.”
“Harry, do you want to explain why you’re, one, avoiding us, and two, storming through the corridors threatening to “burn the entire castle, every tree in the forbidden forest, and especially the damn Whomping Willow to the ground” if the headmaster of the school doesn’t make time to see you?”
By the time Fred and George came in at half past eight, Potter was gesturing wildly with his teacup while he complained about how good Maya was at delaying bedtime, and Draco was marveling at the miracle that Potter wasn't even angry when Draco laughed. Instead, Potter had started laughing, too.
Guilt sparked in her eyes. “No. But Harry’s fine. He--.” She was silent for a moment, thinking. “You are right. He hasn’t been eating. He’s been stressed about the defense class, and--” she stopped short. “Other things. And we haven’t been paying attention.”
"I can't answer all your questions for you, Harry, but I think I can tell you this: You're alive, Harry. You're so alive, it rubs off on the people around you. All this mess you're feeling--the trouble sleeping and eating and all of the thinking about your past--it's a part of the mess of being alive."
The figure stepped closer, and Draco squinted against the light of his illuminated wand. "Yes. Unless you're polyjuiced to look like Draco Malfoy. You're coming with me."
At first, Draco held his posture perfectly. They chugged out of the station and into the grey countryside, and he kept as little physical contact between Potter and himself as possible. It didn’t seem like Potter was having any of the same hesitations. He shifted around, knocking their legs against each other.
It wasn’t, he mused as he shucked off his robes and slid into a comfortable pajama top, as though he’d never imagined Potter seeing the scars he’d caused with his impulsive curse. Before the war, he’d imagined it a hundred different ways. The boys changing for a Quidditch match and Potter’s eyes tracing his chest, his face changing from smug success to horror and shame. Potter apologizing. Draco rebuffing it at first, but eventually giving him a chance to make it up to him. Potter touching the scar. Tracing it with his finger tip.
Sam put up an enormous fight at being separated from Lacey’s side, but McGonagall’s word still held more power that Draco’s, and Sam was dragged off to the Gryffindor tower, protesting loudly. McGonagall’s eyes slid to Potter. “That one reminds me of someone.”
“The point is, you’re doing things no one’s ever heard of before. Nobody thinks you’re making a mess of it.”
And how was she going to enforce that? He frowned, already trying to think of how he’d convince her it was something else. Something innocuous. A peacock, maybe. Or a snake.
"No," Draco said, almost too quickly. "I don't want to interrogate you about it--it's just... I want you to know that it's okay for you to talk about it. I've been awful about your family in the past in a dozen different directions, and I get it if I'm the last person you'd want to....anyway." Draco turned away abruptly and picked up another shard of pottery.
Harry leaned close, but missed Draco's face, instead leaning over his ear. "Thank you, Draco. You make my life so much richer."
Harry looked at Draco and saw that Draco was looking back with a strained expression, uncertain how to proceed.
Damn it. He wanted to stand. Move. Get away from here. The silence felt like it was squeezing him to pieces.
It gave Draco a small measure of satisfaction that Harry’s voice sounded as uncomfortable as he looked. Maybe he felt guilty for mocking Draco now. “Really? Well if you won’t tell them what you said, Potter, I will. He waltzed right up to my table, interrupting my studying no less, and started telling how the whole first year class had a go at me about having the same Patronus as Potter and they’d all decided that I fancied him. And that he asked Weasley and  you, Granger, about it and you told him that he should come and mock my Patronus to my face instead of behind my back.” Steady, Draco. His voice was starting to dip. “So he had a good laugh at me, and I told him that you should all leave me alone.”
One sick twist of his stomach and reconfiguring of the world later, Draco found himself clutching Pansy’s hand directly in front of the Ministry. Hagrid stood at the gate with a very large hat in one hand and a very pink umbrella in his other. “There you lot are! Was beginning ta think you’d all skived off the hearing.
He choked out a strange sound in response to the first year and walked the rest of the way to the table where Pansy was sitting with Weasley and Granger.
"Do you want to ask me something about it?" Harry asked. He sounded so tired. He didn't mean to sound so exhausted before Draco even asked.
Draco blinked up at them. "I have the gold. Two big bags of it." That was right, wasn't it? He looked down at his arms, then all around his person, confused. Had he forgotten something? Yes, definitely that. He'd forgotten everything since they'd dropped the bags of gold on him. They'd been so heavy. Maybe he'd--"Maybe I dropped it?" he said. His voice sounded thin, even to his own ears.
Most of the goblins turned to shuffle back out the door, but the head goblin took a moment to look Draco over, his lip curling. "You'd already be able to pay the difference if you'd do the smart thing and take out the trash. You bring the galleons to the bank tomorrow when you close, or the shop will be ours before the new year. Lockhart's offering us the whole cost up front so he can open a bookstore." With that, the goblin lurched out.
Draco-as-Harry slid into a student desk and fidgeted and peeked through the whole exercise. Harry thought it was a bit much, but none of the students noticed any difference.
He took a hurried step back under the guise of catching a whizzing woofer that had escaped from the child testing it. "Potter," he greeted.
One or two evenings a week that, apparently, kept Potter sane. And drove Draco insane. Not because of the kids, although they were a handful. No. The insanity came from Potter. From the fact that front-page spreads of him pushing his toddler charges in a pram didn't make Draco feel sick anymore. Or not the same sort of sick. Instead, they caused a painful shot of longing through his chest. Potter had always seemed so perfect--twirling through life winning things and rescuing people. But now he was real. He sagged against the doors when they'd got the last kid into bed and cursed when he stepped in something wet and unidentified in the kitchen.
Draco nodded, scrawling another line in his notes about the uses of dragon blood. He was so immersed in his work that he didn’t notice them leave, and he didn’t notice at first when Potter approach the table.
A shadow passed over the girl's bright face. "My name is Claire Hanahan. A.S.2. And don't worry about my family. They're not looking for me."
Draco looked back at the kids. Some of the younger ones hadn't understood what Lockhart was saying, but Jamie looked ready to run after Lockhart and fight. Zoe was clenching the head of her bouquet in two fists.
With that, Neville pulled a stack of books out of his bag and settled onto his bed to get some work done. Draco watched with a sense of horror. He opened an inkwell there on his bedspread and settled in with his back against the headboard.
Potter winced. “I haven’t sworn them to secrecy. I suppose some of them have owled home ‘Learned the Patronus charm this week, Mum. Next week we’re going to learn something called Occlumency. Love!’”
Potter blinked. “Ron and Hermione? No. They always go snog in the first floor bathroom after dinner.”
When Healer Goodnight finally spoke, her voice was gentle and sure. "You don't owe death a single thing. And you don't owe the people that died anything that you haven't already given them. You're certainly not a ghost, Harry. The person I see come in here every week is full of life and all the mess that comes with it. You're full of care for your students, your friends, and your boyfriend. You're full of emotions and thoughts and hopes. Your history is something you think about a lot. That doesn't make you a ghost, that makes you a person who lived through exceptionally difficult times and kept doing what needed to be done. Your history does not own you."
Healer Goodnight nodded slowly. "You're not a ghost, Harry. As for the rest of it--I've never heard of magic that can bring someone back from the dead. Not outside of stories. I guess that makes your story even more unusual. It must be hard to find people to talk to about this."
Time to recover. "Right. I spent the past half an hour looking all over the castle for you. I've got a gift for you up in my trunk." This was not the best time to discuss Polyjuicing into each other for the next Defense lessons to see if the kids could pick up on anything different. Now that he thought about it, maybe the whole discussion of polyjuicing into each other was a conversation that he and Draco should have in private anyway, just in case Draco wanted to do anything other than teach a class while they were--
They were a tangle of words and laughter and exclamations and frivolous magic spells all the way back to the castle. Pansy spelled her hair to look the way she liked and then spelled Granger’s hair into four different styles and Ron’s hair into four different colors. Draco spelled a snowball to bop Pansy on the head and transfigured several stones into fireflies.
Red crept upwards from Harry’s collar. “No. I mean, no that’s not all I can say. I don’t think I ever said how sorry I was.” Harry was inching forward, and Draco felt his back pressing against the window frame.
Draco backed out of the door, heart pounding, but before Andromeda could slam it on him, he caught sight of a little boy standing behind her, and his stomach clenched. He'd never seen Teddy like this. Normally that wasn't a problem, because Teddy was never the same kid two days in a row, but this Teddy looked washed out. His hair wasn't brown or blonde, it was something halfway between. His skin looked too pale. No face sparkles.
Ron looked at Hermione with a little smile tucked in the corner of his mouth. “Of course she is. That’s what Hermione does best: get worked up about things and drag me into the middle of them."
The kid--Draco didn’t remember his name, but did remember him being an attentive student, balled up his fists and swallowed, looking like he was gathering courage to speak
He turned from the main street of Diagon Alley and into the more residential neighborhood behind it. It was mostly shopkeepers and their families living in this particular neighborhood, but when Andromeda had wanted to downsize from her country house, Draco had found this place, and the three of them--Andromeda, Teddy, and Draco, had been living there since.
that, he'd written it on the blackboard. And he'd known that Draco's birthday was coming up. He'd gotten Draco a gift. It's just that his brain had somehow failed to connect these two things as relevant facts.
He was pretty sure he hadn't managed to growl quietly enough for the rest of the table to miss, because after that, Pansy sliced the cake and put a serving on everybody's plate. "Eat up and get out of here."
He wandered around the grounds instead of going to his afternoon class, which probably could be reported to the ministry and violate his probation, but it was Defense, and there was no way he could be there. He wished he’d thought to bring a warmer coat or his mittens, but he made do by stuffing his hands into his robes. He also couldn’t actually stop walking as long as he was outside, since he’d freeze in about a minute. As the evening got colder, he slipped into the castle and found a back corner of the library to hide in until Madame Pince finally shooed him out so she could close up.
Harry opened his mouth and closed it again. There were things--there were so many things that Harry had thought were impossible, but he had just done them anyway. He couldn't tell Draco why this was different because he didn't know the answer himself.
Claire nodded solemnly. "Don't tell Harry you like him. I don't think he'd listen to me if I did. If he hasn't figured it out from how you behave, he's not going to listen to a child."
"No. Yes." Draco took a deep breath, unsteady with suppressed laughter or something else. "I didn't think--I didn't think you'd think of something like this."
Draco felt his shoulders rise, tightening around his ears. He didn’t want people talking about Snape. Sitting here in the potions classroom was steeped enough in memories of him without anyone actually saying his name.
Everybody knows better than to ask the "What are you doing after graduation?" question. Come on, Harry.
“You didn’t know? When we were in Malfoy Manor, Harry snatched some wands from Malfoy. And since Harry’d lost his wand, he ended up using Malfoy’s. It was the most loyal to him.”
He swallowed. He knew they were Gryffindors, but Granger was supposed to be intelligent. “If I thought he wanted to hear from me, I wouldn’t have bothered bringing it up to you.”
She said it as though she still wasn't sure that Harry was telling the truth, as if she thought that he had an invisibility cloak, but probably not really one that could let him hide from death.
Harry looked around at the room, which was far more of a mess than it had been when he started. The piles had spilled out into the Defense room itself, which meant that Harry would actually have to clean it up tonight. Nobody was going to be pleased with him if they had to teach around piles of dangerous junk in the morning.
"That's not what I mean. I mean, it is. It's part of it, because you help me be the person that I want to be in the world, even though sometimes I think I'm going to absolutely lose my mind. But also, I think--oh Merlin. This is the wrong time for this, but I'm going to do it anyway. I'm at least part way towards being in love with you, and I have been for a long time."
Draco looked sharply at George. Was that an innocent suggestion, or had George noticed something? "Isn't the bank closed?"
“I wish it was quiet in our room,” Draco growled. Mostly to change the subject, but honestly. The boys he’d shared a room with growing up had their rowdy moments, but it was nothing compared with having Gryffindors traipsing through. “I don’t think anyone ever taught Potter to talk in an inside voice.
He knocked on his head of house’s door later that week and explained, simply, that if he was going to be at Hogwarts now he was going to have to be better at guarding his thoughts, and Snape had begun Occlumency lessons with him.
Walking down to breakfast the next morning was an exercise in agony. He kept rehearsing what it would be like when he saw Granger and Weasley. Weasley would say something. Weasley was sure to say something.
"I got Dudley's leftovers on everything. Clothes. Food. A few toys he though were really dumb. And Petunia and Vernon--that's the aunt and uncle--what they cared about the most was being normal. You can imagine where that left me. I just tried--the only thing that mattered--the thing that I was always going for was to be invisible." Harry swallowed. There was probably something else to say. Some explanation of why that was making him so bad at everything. He needed to figure this out. Sort it. Explain himself.
Just as the water was starting to steam, Potter slipped back into the room. Draco looked up and instantly swallowed the quip he’d been about to fling. Potter’s face was flushed and his hands were clenched at his sides. It would be too easy to pick a fight with him right now.
Harry’s green-gold eyes were on him, waiting for Draco to say something in response, but this was more than Draco could take. Magic he might be able to learn, but some things were just out of his reach.
“I think I’ll pass,” Draco muttered. He swayed in place. It seemed wrong to be here, intruding on the tail end of their party, when they’d been enjoying themselves. That was the point of not going in the first place.
The shop was at full swing that day when the bell rang and Draco spied a head of black curls jammed under a red-and-gold stocking hat. He busied himself helping a little girl pick out just the right gift for her best friend. "I want something that will make her laugh every time she sees it," the girl said, and Draco showed her to the Chocolate Hogs, whose collectable cards were full of bizarre fabrications about famous witches and wizards throughout the ages.
The class gasped and several students turned around, only to witness her doing it again. Draco took several steps toward her, but Potter beat him to the girl, casting a cushioning charm effortlessly with one hand and then bracing her shoulders with the other.
Draco put a sticking charm on the portrait and hung in on the wall above his desk. Emotions were still flickering across his face too quickly for Harry to track all of them. A half smile, rapidly blinking eyes, a little huff of a sigh. But when Draco turned around, he nodded. "You did a good job."
There was an awkward silence as Draco watched Hermione exit and tried to wrestle his thoughts away from what would happen if Potter and he did get locked in a closet. Maybe he should pretend not to be talking to--
There was some of the waiting typical of any visit to the Ministry, but eventually the five of them were escorted to the benches outside one of the less austere courtrooms. Draco lowered himself to his seat. It seemed like he should sit. Even though his blood was racing and his fingers were twitching and he needed to
Oh. Potter was standing now, walking towards him. Draco barely had time to stand before Potter was right there, crowding the space between him and puffing hot breaths on Draco’s collar. “Can I touch you now?”
Toward Draco. So close that their hips were touching, and their knees. So close that Draco couldn’t pull entirely away. So close that there was plenty of room for Pansy at the other end of the seat. She gaped for a moment too long, and Draco panicked that she was going to say something.
Finally, the kids had been bundled home for a Christmas Eve of sipping cocoa and opening gifts donated by customers of the shop. Harry had waved his goodbyes as he was swept out the door in a crowd of admirers. The final customers had been satisfied, and Fred was counting down the seconds until nine, when they were officially closed for the night.
There were people in the classroom who would have been mocking Draco if they said that, but not Neville. He really wanted to see.
The fireplace lit up with green light, and a head popped up in the grate. "Hello! It's way too loud over there. Can anyone hear me?"
Hermione let out a long sigh, as if she was the one being patient with them and not the other way around. “Harry, can you tell us what you said to Malfoy in the library the other day?
"I've just got to get this girl to Harry Potter, and then I'll..." he trailed off. What would he do when he got Claire the help she needed. "I'll face the consequences of  my actions."
“Uh, Hermione. You’re the cleverest person I know, and you make things happen, and I--I really like being with you. And I think Harry’s going to be busy on the next Hogsmeade weekend. Do you think just the two of us should--”
So instead of thinking about the long years ahead that he was supposed to survive—better than the last years, maybe, but still so long—he took deep breaths just like Pansy said.
She gave him a withering glare. "First of all, this is not about me. It's about you. Remember, I came here to rescue you. Second of all, I'm not a witch, Draco. And I wasn't a witch when I was alive, either. I'm an angel."
Right. Because there was any other explanation for the fact that Draco was still sitting here after the kind of day he had.
He laughed. "What are you going to cast, Potter? Riddikulus, to get rid of the nightmare? Or Expelliarmus, so you can take back my wand? Or have you picked up some new hexes to try out on me?
Ron stood up quickly. “I’ll come with you, Hermione. I’m almost finished with Potions, and then we could collaborate on the defense work.”
Something about that made Harry's shoulders relax. When he talked to Hermione and Ron about the teaching job, it was about what he wanted, and what he'd be best at, and where he could make the most impact. Draco was the one who knew that all the big questions came down to names. Lacey. Sam. Devon. And all the names that weren't on his rosters yet. The real students that he'd love and fight with next year if he came back.
“But he’s married to Ginny,” Draco managed. He’d given up his hold on reality. If Claire was mad, he was too, and in this reality, Harry was married and a father. “She’s pregnant. They’re happy.”
“No!” the boy shouted. “I can’t!” Tears were already overflowing from his eyes, and he had his fingers hooked on the edge of the stool. “I don’t want to be in Slytherin, I want to be good.”
"You can't just leave something dark and dangerous in the top drawer for someone else to come along and find, Draco."
He still felt a sick gnawing in his gut, but at least she was saying that Potter was nearby. Whatever was going on, Potter would set it right.
But it didn't fix things. It didn't change the fact that it had been a year, and Harry still couldn't seem to get enough distance from the war to stop having these nightmares. It didn't change the fact that Colin was gone because he'd fought for Harry. It didn't change the fact that Harry was
“Before he taught me the spell, Lupin told me that it was one of the trickiest spells, and that many full grown wizards never learned it.”
“Don’t you worry about that ‘ermione,” Hagrid grinned, puffing his chest out. “Just want to be sure I’m doing my part to make things right after the war--” He glanced at Pansy and Draco from the corner of his eye. “--for all o’ my students.”
Jameson's eyes were trained on his boots. "Of course you can, Harry. I'll be good, I promise. It's just that I thought I saw wrackspurts hiding on the shelf, and I had to get a better look! There shouldn't be wrackspurts hiding in the joke shop."
Draco focused on the heading of his document, and before too long, he heard Potter’s footsteps retreating. He knew Potter had to pretend that he wanted Draco there. He wasn’t fooled.
"Not until I make sure you're somewhere safe," he muttered. "Although if we happen to encounter any fatal accidents on the way, I wouldn't complain."
Harry snatched his hand back as if he’d been stung. He tore his eyes away from Draco’s chest and looked into his eyes. “Uh, I--Sorry, I--I’m going for a walk.”
“I don’t even know if I’m allowed to use that wand,” Draco growled. “I’m registered with this one. They’re keeping track of every spell I do.” Explaining this to Potter rankled.
Draco's shoulders slumped. "I don't want to. But I don't want to go on feeling stupid. Everything else is such shit all the time. I don't have a clue how I’m going to make it through next year, and there are so many years in front of us, which should be a good thing but just feels terrifying. You are the thing I like best about my life, but I'm the only one who feels that way."
"And you'll be glad to know that the ministry has evaluated her sisters, both of whom showed some magical capabilities, and will be keeping a surveillance charm over the house. If they find evidence that the girls are unsafe, they will be removed. Meanwhile they're trying to convince the parents to participate in an educational program for non-magic parents of Wizarding children. The program's only in the developmental stages, but I believe Miss Granger thinks she can help them get that started next year along with all the other things she's getting up to."
Draco tore off his gloves and stuffed them into his pocket. “Potter can catch the snitch now since he could have caught it then and pulled up short.”
Draco sighed heavily. “He probably cycles through all the people he tried to save during the war, panicking about all of them. Stop trying to make something  out of this, Pansy.”
Draco had nightmares too. How could he not? How could anyone who lived through all of that not be hit by it from time to time?  Night or day. Conscious or unconscious. But Draco woke up from those dreams like a coiled spring with a vice grip on his blankets. Quiet and breathless until he could force the air back in and out of his lungs.
No, he thought, as he leaned over the rails of the bridge to stare into the water. This had to be one of the minor bridges of London. But if he jumped from here--if he jumped into water that cold, wearing his boots and peacoat--if he just let himself be carried away, there wouldn’t be any Death Eater connected to the joke shop. There’d be no Death Eater frequenting Harry’s home. There’d still be no gold, but he couldn’t fix that. This was all he could do.
Draco’s mind raced for some kind of out. He tried to make his mouth form a lie, like that it was a different Harry, or to make some kind of joke, or--anything.
Draco glowered at her. This was just the sort of situation where he needed his own wand so he could send a stinging hex or a lip-lock jinx at her. “The fact remains,” he drawled. “Potter just wanted to hold me back so he could flaunt that he’s still got my wand and that my magic is piss-poor because of it.”
And then Potter had blown into the joke shop at seven one morning, planted his hands on the front counter, and screamed, "I'm going to kill them all."
Johnson puffed his chest. “Professor Potter says we never know when there’s going to be a moment we have to defend against the dark, and that we’ll never really feel ready. But we have to try.”
“I told you it sends the wrong message to the younger students if we isolate the Slytherins at the Eighth year table. If we want true reconciliation, it has to start with us. And you said, ‘Yeah, but not while I’m trying to eat.’”
"She told me I was doing the best I possibly could, considering. She wasn't even trying to be mean about it. She just knows that you're never going to have the same feelings about me that I do about you."
"I don't like you asking questions about my grandson," Andromeda snarled. "Some death-eater wannabe trying to get information on anyone from the Order who survived? I'm calling the Aurors."
"Tidying up your office for next year?" Draco pressed, and Harry realized that he'd never answered Draco's question. He'd sent him all that long letter and been hoping that Draco would come find him, and now he didn't know what to say.
Draco spit into the sink and watched the water swirl. “About class today. Is the girl--have you spoken to her?”
There had been little hints, almost guilty mentions, that Draco had already liked Harry, and Harry wanted to know about it. But Draco already felt like he was the one who had fallen harder, and much as Harry wanted to know how long Draco had been waiting, he didn't want to do it while Draco still felt like they were in such different places.
Potter’s eyes caught Draco’s, and he hummed. “We’re trying to think of all the ways we’re going to fix the world as grown ups. You know, we’ve already offed Voldemort, so now we can take care of the little things.”
A look of resignation settled on Ron’s face, and he served himself a heap of eggs. “What case, Hermione?”
He looked up and found McGonagall's eyes, hard and steady, on him. "I forget, sometimes," she said. "I forget how young you were. How young you are."
Andromeda had started cold. At first she’d wanted to do everything for Teddy herself and keep Draco at arm’s length. But Draco didn’t have to wear her down--the two year old did that. Eventually she had to start letting Draco feed Teddy and convince Teddy to put on clothes. She still wasn't exactly a burbling font of affection. But she made sure that Draco had something to eat and that he got nearly enough sleep, and that wasn't nothing.
Harry's home for kids should be just down the block, and he'd certainly be able to fix this. "You'll like Harry," he said. "Everyone does."
actually thought of Draco's birthday ahead of time, and he'd worried about it. When you were, at heart, a kid that had grown up wearing your cousin's gross hand-me-downs, a kid for whom any gift had felt like a miracle, how did you figure out what to give someone like Draco, who'd been given the best of everything from the moment he was born?
Harry walked toward Draco. Well, he'd felt settled for about ten seconds. "Every now and then I manage," he grinned. This seemed like a time that he should reach out. In fact, it seemed like a time that his body should just know what to do. But his heart was pounding, anxious and quick.
Harry’s eyes widened, hands forming into fists. Malfoy took one of his hands, prying it out of the fist and holding onto it. “We’ll fix it, Potter. He’ll be alright. Let’s go chat with your beloved Headmaster, shall we?”
Potter’s eyes were hard and his chin tilted up, so the light from the window was filtering through his messy curls and making his skin look like gold. Draco knew this look, too, the look of the boy savior, the one people would follow to the end of the world. The one people had.
Potter shifted. Glanced at the crowd of Weasleys now listening to their argument. “I just thought you wanted--”
I'm sorry. I meant to apologize, and then I went on being terrible. I've been meaning to write you since the night that I got stuck in my thoughts and your owl reminded me that I had a better place to be: our bedroom, with a stack of sweets, and someone who likes me.
Of course now. Why had Harry hesitated so long, making Draco always be the one to reach? He leaned forward and pressed his lips against Draco's. He had been planning to say something clever in the moment after he initiated the kiss about "Well, if you'd rather not--" or something, but he got distracted. Draco was very good at that.
It was Potter’s voice this time, and as if he’d just uttered a spell--and maybe he had--Draco turned around, looked as high as Potter’s shoulders, and nodded once.
Potter couldn’t suppress his grin. “Do you know why everyone in the class was cheering when they cast the spell?”
Malfoy was last. He wiped his hand on his robes, chin tipped high and a look of revulsion on his face.
Draco bristled and stood. Of course. Harry was keeping an eye on him. Like the war was still on, at least for him. He let out a long breath. He needed it to be over.
Harry started by sitting in the empty defense classroom, hoping that Malfoy would read his letter and find him on the map and come to be with him in real life. But sitting still was hard. Sitting turned into pacing,and then he walked to the back of the room, through the door that was always ominously ajar, and into the Defense office.
Andromeda looked more sharply at Draco's face. "Lucius? You can't be--you're supposed to be in Azkaban."
While everyone else was bustling around, pulling stashes of alcohol out of hidden compartments, Draco set up his desk for an evening of hard work.
"Right." Harry straightened his shoulders. "We're starting a unit on all kinds of dark disguises today. We've already done some things on transformations, so you should realize that animal transformation is one way to disguise yourself. Of course, there are lots of ways to disguise yourself that have nothing to do with dark or light, but people can use them for all sorts of good or bad reasons and--
Draco wasn’t sure if it was the apparation, or the Pepper-up potion Hermione had forced on him, or something else entirely, but he felt exceptionally ill. He remembered every terrible thing he’d ever done to Hagrid. Actually, that was probably too many to think of at the moment. He thought of several terrible things he’d done to Hagrid, and spun around quickly.
“I’m just saying, it’s suspicious,” Ron repeated. “Krum trying to get so close to Hermione when we know his school’s the dark one. You agree with me, don’t you, mate?”
Draco could imagine it. Could imagine Potter explaining it to Draco’s parole officer, how he really had rehabilitated, how he was even teaching first-years how to defend against the dark arts.
Harry gave Draco a good head start before he found Ginny's dot on the map and tracked her down. She was sitting in the sun on the bank of the lake surrounded by friends. All of their faces were angled toward her, watching her gesture wildly as she finished her story. "Um, Gin?" he said. "Can I get a word?"
She turned her back and walked into the office. "I have not missed a Gryffindor match since I came to Hogwarts, Mister Potter, and I don't intend to start. Let's take care of this matter quickly.”
Hermione grinned. "We went and asked the House Elves if we could do something special, and they helped us make this."
Draco glanced at him. It was important not to smirk. That would be mean. But he could feel bubbles of relief in him, and they might just slip out in something that Potter would misread. “It’s not as if you’re the only one, Potter,”  he yawned. “All this drama over nightmares that we all have after the war.” He closed his trunk and sat on his bed.
The blinking eyes had caught him off guard, and for a second he wasn’t sure what he’d meant to say. “You. Being a disaster of a human being.”
Something about the way Neville said it made one side of Draco’s mouth twitch into a smile. It didn’t feel like guilt.
Draco found himself face-to-face with Ginny, who clapped him on the back, causing him to wince. “That was good flying. If somebody hadn’t smashed into you like a complete oaf, we really would have had it.”
It wouldn’t be weird now, to put a hand on Harry’s shoulder and say that everything would be okay. At least, it would be significantly less weird than twining the same hand through Harry’s hair and trying to console him that way.
His own hesitations aside, there was no way they actually wanted him around at their holidays. However many Weasleys there were, there was one less because of the war. He wasn’t the right person to fill that vacancy.
Potter was in the middle of pulling off his shirt, and Draco lay back again quickly to protect his thoughts. “Uh, I always thought I’d be an auror, so I could help put away dark wizards.”
His head jerked up, and he blinked around Teddy’s bedroom through swollen eyes. Andromeda was standing in the dim light of the hallway, frowning at him.
"What? Of course I do. I touch you all the time. And snog you, and--well, some other things as well, although not nearly as often as I'd like to."
"I died," he said. "Voldemort cast the killing curse on me. There was nothing to protect myself with. I was knocked out, and I went--somewhere else. I should have stayed dead, but I think that because I had all the Deathly Hallows, I didn't. I came back. I had a choice. I told myself I had to come back and make sure Voldemort was taken care of, so I came back."
"I don't want to miss a second of it," Harry grinned. Gryffindor versus Slytherin for the final time. "Merlin, I wish I were flying today. I wish we were both flying today."
The next morning felt surreal, especially sitting in the potion classroom. The spell damage that had happened in the room had been repaired, the informational posters that the Carrows hung removed. Draco traced his finger along the grainy surface of his desk. Pansy, to his left, readied her quills and book. She looked busier with the task than she actually was.
Draco's jaw twitched, and Harry could see that he was getting ready to argue, to explain how that wasn't what he meant, that was not what he meant at all, and this was probably truly the wrong moment, but Harry moved Draco's hand from between them and used his other hand to tug Draco's head down, and lean forward, inches from his face.
But Draco couldn't mistake the fondness in Harry's voice as he spoke. When Harry had opened a home for children three years ago, Draco had specifically heard him tell Fred and George, "I've faced down Voldemort. A few kids should be a breeze after that."
He could feel the difference. What moved through him and poured forth wasn’t feeble. It wasn’t weak. It was solid and tangible. It was something real.
“You’re the only one who seems to be bothered, so my apologies, but why don’t you put a spell on your bed at night and ignore it like everyone else.”
Claire took another bite of her cookie and chewed like she was stalling for time. "I don't know what to tell you. It wasn't easy for them. I can’t say they’re all okay."
"No," Draco whispered. His knees shook, then gave, and he dropped into the snow. "No. no. Fred's not dead. I just saw him at the shop."
“Yes?” Malfoy was feeling too unsteady to have a conversation with anyone right now. But stomping off now wouldn't earn him any points.
Harry narrowed his eyes. "You want to know if I actually remembered to get you anything ahead of time."
Harry let his feet carry him away from the celebrants. He'd catch up with Ginny later and tell her what a great game she'd played. He really would this time. But right now he didn't want his bad feelings passing to anybody else, and he found himself sitting back in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. Maybe he could finally mark the students' quizzes. It was actually easier to think about now. There was only a week left, and all of it would be taken up with examinations. And then he'd be done, truly done.
His pulse fluttered in panic. What did she know? Had she found out about--had Hermione said something about his situation regarding Potter? The Weasley girl wouldn’t confront him about that here, in the middle of this crowded train car, would she?
"I told McGonagall that there would be jobs for me when I wanted them, and that I wanted to take a year off to catch up on my sleep," Harry grinned.
She sobbed again. “I’m causing a sc-scene. I’m not supposed to--” her voice broke off as her back arched and Draco’s hand sank into her arm. He pulled back.
Their hands were linked between them, and Draco had been full of protestations at first that Harry didn’t know what kind of problems this was going to cause, but now he didn’t want to let go.
“Agreed,” Draco snapped, trying to ignore the sad twist inside him. He’d never once thought he could really have Potter in the way he wanted him, but it had seemed for a while like they might bump into each other if Pansy and Hermione both wanted to catch up over dinner, or-- “I see no reason for you to force the issue.”
The door opened a fraction, and a house-elf stood in the doorway. "Who is interrupting my Master's celebrations at this hour?"
He scowled at her. “I’m sorry, maybe I’m too thick to cast a Patronus and too foolish to know when Potter’s trying to help and when he’s having a laugh at me because he disarmed me and he’s still got my wand. Maybe I’ll ask the brightest witch of our age to clue me in.”
At the end of the week, the social engagement that the others had been planning occurred. Draco was relieved that he had a lot of homework.
But he wasn’t completely free from distractions. In the corner across the room, Potter was running one hand through his hair and absently dripping ink on his opposite sleeve. Probably marking the first year’s papers. Draco snorted and trained his eyes back on his own book. Not only had Saint Potter been awarded the job of preparing the eighth year students for their NEWTs, but he’d also been entrusted with the education of the first year students. Other staff members had picked up other classes. Slughorn was working with the second years, McGonagall with the third years, and so on.
Draco swallowed and forced his voice out as evenly as possible. "I understand if this changes things. If I need to lay low for a while, or if you need to make a show of sacking me."
Draco had been unable to open his eyes. All of the thoughts he’d been scrambling to hide were about Potter.
What could he say that wouldn’t scare her more than she had already been scared today? He knew somebody should tell her the truth. She deserved to know. She needed to know, if she was going to keep defending herself from the dark. He wished people had told him more of the truth when he was young enough that it would do him any good. “I don’t know everything about it,” Draco said, hesitantly. “But sometimes when wizards are having really dark thoughts, they turn on themselves and try to hurt themselves. It can happen if a wizard or witch doesn’t believe their magic is a good thing.”
And then Potter spoke, and Draco’s blood froze in his veins. “You must have known that the doe was Snape’s patronus. He used it to lead us to the Sword of Gryffindor. You must miss him a lot.”
Potter glanced at Draco, also from the corner of his eyes. “You’re right. He was a stubborn man. Who’s teaching potions this year, anyhow?”
Trembling, he tried to count out the Galleons and set them on the table, but all the money in his fist slipped onto the floor with a clatter.
“The economy is a little unsteady these days,” the clerk responded, matter of fact. “Surely you understand.”
Draco held his breath as Lacey and Sam moved the wand together and Lacey choked out, “Expecto Patronum.”
"Money?" Lockhart's eyebrows drew up in surprise. "No, I don't usually run into large amounts of money on the street. Why do you ask? Have you misplaced a few sickles?"
The anxiety, which had only abated in the slightest, rolled back over him like a wave, and Draco found himself clutching the counter.
"That's okay." Claire pressed her finger to one of the bricks at random. It wasn't even one of the bricks that was supposed to trigger the magic. "I can get us in."
Draco’s eyes moved slowly, drawn like magnets back to Potter’s face, and not for the first time he realized that he was probably staring at one of the most powerful wizards to ever live. Only this time, his power was--funneling through the students he taught? “Merlin’s--Merlin’s tits, Potter. Do other people know about this?”
Draco’s veins turned to ice. “Under absolutely no circumstances do I want you to talk to Potter about this or anything else to do with me,” he replied. He knew his voice was clipped and harsh, and he was glad.
She raised an eyebrow. "You tried to help yourself to one. You told me all the reasons why it would be foolish not to consider you. Why are you surprised now that you've got your offer?"
It wasn’t as terrifying, at the moment, to look at Harry’s face. Less frightening than looking at the door they were supposed to walk through. He was wearing an expression Draco had become familiar with over the years. Although what Potter expression hadn’t he memorized?
“The nightmares all the time, jumping at every sound. Staying up late and scribbling on your papers. Never being around the common room or spending time with Weasley and Granger.”
Draco gathered him up into his arms and lifted him close. "Teddy." All he could feel was the fierce press of his arms squeezing Teddy's currently stick-thin body and the burning in his lungs. "Teddy, you're so beautiful."
“Time is of the essence, Miss Granger,” Dumbledore said seriously. He quickly set pen to parchment and scrawled a note, passing it to Hermione as he stood. “This should allow you to access the restricted book and find the reversal spell. I’m going to speak to a few of the faculty and see about Professor Moody. I hope to see you all well and returned to yourselves tomorrow. And Mister Malfoy, Mister Potter?”
The response to the buttons had been brilliant, especially from Potter’s crowd. Granger had tried to scare him into recalling them, and it nearly worked. Being on the wrong side of her fist once was enough. But the buttons had taken on a life of their own, and Draco was merely the supplier.
Harry was doing his best to be on time to the Quidditch match. That was the whole point of meeting with Healer Goodnight so early this morning. But he couldn't find the Gryffindor flag that Hermione had given him for cheering, and Draco was leaning against the doorway in a more rigid, impatient, you're-going-to-make-us-late-Potter way than usual.
Potter cleared his throat and rubbed a spot on the back of his neck. “I have found that to be a useful technique, but it’s not all I’m teaching them. Johnson, Puri, care to show Mr. Malfoy what you can do?”
“She wants to mend divisions after the war. I want to be liked again. If it takes a bit of acting to make the rest of the school think we’ve put all our differences behind us, we’re both more than equal to the task.
"Do you have the money, or don't you?" the goblin snapped. "Because either the Weasley boys are lying to us, and we'll be selling that shop before the year's out, or you've just stolen nearly a thousand galleons from your employers, in which case, maybe I should call the Aurors on you."
Ron's head forced its way into the grate next to hers. "And a niffler gave him a quick sniff and found that he had two giant bags of gold on him. Investigations are ongoing, but we've got him in custody."
The game wrapped up, and after everybody had cheered and sang a last rousing chorus of "Weasley is our King," after Luna had left the announcing booth to run onto the field and ride a victory lap around the field with Ginny, after the Gryffindors had disappeared into the changing room and Harry's friends had joined the slow procession back up to the castle, Hermione turned to him.
Before he was out of earshot, he heard Potter tell McGonagall. “I’ll be waiting in your office. I need to know how we’re going to be sure that Lacey’s safe from now on.”
Draco steeled himself. It didn’t matter if Harry remembered him, even if Draco felt like he was bleeding from that wound. “Never mind. Forget that. You've been running the home for kids with Luna for years, and I thought that if anyone could help, you could."
Break sped by after Christmas, and every day twisted Draco’s internal organs into a tighter knot. Because every day he enjoyed the casual (now that the official match was over) Quidditch in the garden, and the stories from Charlie about dragons, and the laughter around the dinner table. He enjoyed the way Potter jostled him out of the way on the stairs and shot him a cheeky grin. He should not be feeling safe here. He should not be feeling like parts of him he hadn’t noticed had unraveled were knitting themselves back together. This was something that couldn’t last. Worse, he could calculate no way that would allow him to have this again in his future. They’d return to Hogwarts, and he’d take his exams and pray that he got enough NEWTs to make someone want to hire him someday. He’d run into Potter in Diagon Alley someday and maybe Potter would lift a hand in greeting instead of glaring at him, but that was the best he could hope for. This kind of warmth wasn’t something to get used to.
And he definitely didn't want them hearing about him getting arrested for stealing hundreds of galleons from the Weasleys.
Of course there was an unusually strong and specific version of the Trace on both of them, and strict rules about using “unnecessary magic.” The wand Draco’s mother lent him had lived idly on his desk most of the summer. It was lethargic, and it felt wrong to use it often. Besides, it was hard to know what “unnecessary magic” entailed.
” he mimicked instead. “Is that all you can think to say, Potter? Has my stunning physique robbed you of intelligent thought?"
Draco felt fear light up in him like a spark, but he kept his face still and didn’t look at the others. Ron was sputtering, but the headmaster wasn’t stopping to address his objections.
I've gotten used to trusting very few people. People have left me. Some people betrayed me. Merlin, some
he told himself. It was okay to think of his history and miss it. He was more than the imprint of the soul. He was standing here now, cheering for Ginny with his friends, and even with everything he missed, the feeling inside of him was more happy than not.
But Draco didn't stop. It was only a few more blocks to Potter's house, and if he could just see that the windows were flooded with light and the front room was crowded with the kids who needed Potter, that would be enough.
Lacey had been a little slower to reach them, but she was beaming just as bright. She lifted her wand. “Expecto Patronum.”
Harry’s eyes flicked to Draco’s, challenging and hard. “Yes, Malfoy. Back. I thought it was possible that you felt something for me, and I got excited. Don’t worry, I feel like a fool and I won’t do it again.”
It wasn't a total disaster of a class, Harry told himself, leaning heavily on the doorframe. Nothing caught fire, and nobody hexed anybody else. Still, as all the students burst out the door at the end of the class, Harry couldn't help but feel like a failure. Maybe one of his teachers had been a disguised Death Eater trying to kill him, but kids still hadn't been trying to skive off Barty Crouch Jr.'s class. Nobody fell asleep when Barty Crouch Jr. was teaching.
"Mister Potter," McGonagall continued before he could speak. "I have not asked your leave to perform a play in three acts, just to explain my position. I feel that assigning Malfoy the Defense Against the Dark Arts class would be contrary to his natural talents and inclinations."
“Ooh!” hooted Weasley as the small crowd of eighth years made their way into the passage, “Somebody’s in trouble.”
Despite himself, Draco could feel a smile forming on his face. This was serious. He had all but given up on keeping his thoughts from centering around Potter, but he couldn’t afford to start grinning like a Hufflepuff every time Potter walked into the room. “I’m studying, Potter. Not all of us have jobs promised to us after Hogwarts.”
The game was a dream. Luna's hilarious commentary had Ron in fits of laughter the whole time, and Ginny was playing chaser, scoring goal after goal on the Slytherin keeper. Draco taught their little cheering section the new song he'd made for Ginny and they listened as the song spread farther each time Ginny scored another goal.
Hermione looked at Ron. She thought she’d gotten over being stunned by the strangeness of this week, but once again, she was speechless.
"Exactly," Draco-as-Harry exclaimed, pointing at Sam in a dramatic gesture. "Five points to Gryffindor for Sam finding the simple solution. How do you find out if somebody's been changing their appearance with a potion?"
Draco was feeling distinctly like he should have left the moment the trio had been reunited, but now it would be weird to leave.
"Everyone's flying now," Luna announced. "I wish I could go for a fly. We all should. It's such a beautiful day for flying. Nearly nargle-free. Although it is kind of sad that this is the last Quidditch game of the year."
Moments later Draco was checking his cuffs for soot while Pansy eyed the patrons of The Leaky Cauldron. She’d always been the one to confront the stares head-on, while Draco tried to look past everyone in the establishment without lowering his gaze.
He saw the candles in the windows first, and then a face pressed against the window. It wasn't a face he recognized, exactly, but he waved anyway. The eyes were familiar, and it belonged to a kid about five years old, which meant that this person who seemed to have long brown hair in a braid over their shoulder, a tiny button nose, and more freckles that Draco had ever seen naturally occurring on a human being's face was probably Teddy.
Lockhart laughed his smarmy chuckle. "Well that's a bit convenient, isn't it? The store owners give the underpaid shopboy more than he'll see in a year of salaries, and suddenly it disappears. You really think anyone will buy that story?"
He stopped on the street abruptly and turned around. He must have been so lost in his thoughts that he walked right past the shop. There was Magical Me and Other Books, and Lockhart's Laughs, and Lockhart’s Ice Cream, which was mercifully not called Lockhart’s Licks.
“I have three guesses. If I’m wrong about all of them, you don’t have to tell me what your Patronus is, and I promise to defend your position of not doing the spell in front of the class. But you have to answer honestly. “
Potter reached out and hooked his left hand behind Draco’s knee. He flicked his wand wordlessly, and Draco felt the healing spell warm his skin and veins. He glanced up at Potter’s face, which was still pinched in worry. “Are you hurt anywhere else?”
"Can you just tell Potter that Draco Malfoy is here? I've got a kid in trouble, and I need to talk to him."
He explained the process for not-thinking and noticing their own thoughts, but couldn’t shake the look that Sam kept locked on him. When Potter suggested that the students split up and practice, Draco was relieved to slink off to the corner.
"Of course," Draco answered. "Wouldn't want to keep Saint Potter waiting." Just like he'd hoped, Potter smiled. At some point, Potter had decided to stop taking Draco's prickliness as a personal attack. It was a good thing, too, because Draco didn’t know how to stop being prickly.
Sam stood from their desk. “That’s why we can’t have you in here. You did something to Lacey’s mind.”
It was unnerving to watch Neville deftly flicking the package this and that way to make sure it was clear. The fact that it was nearly the winter holidays and Draco hadn’t managed to cast a patronus, which apparently all the first years could do, was always somewhere in the back of his well organized mind.
But Potter wasn’t really listening anymore. His face was alight. He’d figured out how to save the Draco-in-distress, and Draco couldn’t talk him out of it.
“And he’s got books here about all sorts of things and people. Look! This is a book on the Weasleys!” Potter picked up the book and found himself unceremoniously dumped out of Draco’s mind.
"An evening or two that keeps me sane," Harry said. "You're right that I wouldn't be able to do it without Luna, but don't sell yourself short."
But the shop needed the business, so Draco couldn't complain. Fred and George were geniuses at coming up with new gags and toys. But they were also Gryffindors, and while that shouldn't directly correlate with a complete lack of business acumen, it sometimes did.
But they should be confident about this, because they had been making good sales all month, and were keeping them in a well-jinxed safe, and tomorrow they would be able to make at least a really sizable payment, if not every penny they owed.
“Well, this is a pretty simple potion, isn’t it?” he asked, deftly stirring the bubotuber pus and lacewing flies in the bottom of the cauldron. “Dice that boomslang skin, would you?”
Harry opened his mouth and closed it. The whole point of having a counselor like her was to make sure that he could tell her the things, all the things. Still--this was a lot to tell anyone.
McGonagall opened her mouth, and there was a long pause before she said. "The things you've had to carry. I shouldn't have asked--I'm sorry."
Those smiles were usually for the other person's benefit. Or because someone else made it possible to smile. All on his own, Draco didn't smile much. But Christmas Eve, and the candles in the windows, the enormous flakes of snow drifting down, and two enormous bags of gold in his arms--Draco could smile for this.
Harry closed his eyes, he had the strangest feeling, as if someone had cast a spell over him that made him feel more solid.
Potter’s eyes blazed. “They keep her locked up at home. Lacey Ketteridge. They said her magic is unnatural, and when they got the letter from Hogwarts, they locked her up. And McGonagall was
He watched as Ron and Pansy’s Patronuses burst forth and stood guard between Lacey and their casters. And then Johnson’s owl was circling their heads, and a silver snake twisted in mid air.
There was a flicker of emotion across Draco's face. "Just curious," he said, keeping his voice light.
If Harry wasn’t good enough to go professional, Draco had never stood a chance. But that had been his dream. One of the little pet thoughts that was safe and innocuous enough to feed even when the Dark Lord was sifting through his thoughts.
There was a lot of shouting and back pounding and excitement, and then a whistle blew, and everyone turned to watch the teams kick off.
There was a shocked silence, and McGonagall leaned back in her seat, looking pleased. "If you'd like to respond now, gentlemen, feel free."
"I'm not the Master of Death anymore," he said. "I got rid of the wand and the stone. In case you were wondering. If I die now, it'll be permanent. I won't have a choice." At least, Harry thought so. He hoped so. There were only so many back doors on death. "Just like everyone else who died."
"It was a good letter," Draco said slowly, wandering past Harry and trying to open one of the drawers. "It helps to know what you're thinking. I'd say I can't read minds, but I sort of can. I just don't."
“What’s the gossip?” Draco asked. He should have known that he wouldn’t be the only one to find this interesting.
"Sometimes you just have to remind people to direct their attention to the important things," Lockhart said, tilting his head and shooting Draco a confidential smile. "I think I can help you there. As a citizen of this community, I think it's my job to point out the disgraceful way that Harry Potter is running his little children's shelter. The joke shop will put itself out of its misery before the first of the year. It's amazing how little work I had to do to put them out of business. You did that all by yourself. I just had to point it out. Harry's darling home will be right behind. You'd be more help just by staying out of it."
Ron put his hand on her arm, still trying to swallow his laughter. “Harry’s just Harry. He’d think something was caused by a blibbering humdinger before he’d think it was caused by somebody fancying him. Do you want us to talk to him?”
Harry's heart thundered as McGonagall turned on him. If she had offered Draco the job, his answer would have been easy.
Harry looked at the others. They were the ones who'd actually remembered Draco's birthday and made sure there was something special about it. Hermione had even managed to clue Harry in. They were better friends to Draco than Harry was, but right now Harry wanted nothing more than to get Draco away from them so he could try to make things right.
"Of course. You fought by their side that day after Harry rescued you from the Room of Hidden Things. They still won the battle without you," she offered. "We're not living in Voldemort's world. But Fred didn't make it."
Draco's arms were wrapped around himself now, less in defiance and more as a protective measure. "You don't touch me."
Draco made eye contact with Ron, who was standing behind Harry, eyes wide. In all the many ways he’d pictured this happening, Ronald Weasley had never been standing behind Harry, looking shocked.
“Then you understand why I’ve got to teach it. Or why it’s got to be taught, at least. It’s Defense Against the Dark Arts, Malfoy.”
And with a snap of the fingers, the holidays were over, and Draco was boarding the Hogwarts express with the Golden Trio and Ginny Weasley once again. He had somehow been shuffled to the front of their group. Good. He could sit down in a compartment and get out a book right away and pretend to not even notice if the rest of them joined him in the same compartment.  He couldn’t remember how they’d all gotten on the train at the start of the holidays and if Potter and crew had chosen to sit with him or been forced to. But at that point they’d probably felt like they had to sit with him, since they were pressuring him into going to the Weaselys. They weren’t pressuring him into Hogwarts. He was court ordered. So they could sit wherever they wanted. Nevermind that after all those pick up Quidditch games and chess in the evenings it would feel like a slap in the face if they sat somewhere else.
When it had first opened, the papers had been full of stories about Harry's Home for Children. About how good and noble he was, to care for the orphans of the war, or squibs or, as he put it "Anyone who needs a family that will love them for just who they are."
The eighth years filed into the Defense classroom same configuration of seats that they’d taken in Potions. Seats that grouped everyone together and left him and Pansy several seats off. He wondered how Potter and Granger knew anything about the defense teacher. Who was even left to teach defense?
As Pansy and he were standing in line and Flourish and Blotts, the bell above the entryway rang. A mother with a youngster stepped inside, only to take one look at the two of them and cluck in disapproval. She tugged her daughter right back out of the store, ignoring the protests of her offspring.
She started arranging her breakfast plate while Draco studied the little bottle. If this was all an elaborate plot to get Draco to take veritaserum and get him on the stand or drug him and smuggle him off to some undisclosed location, she had done a very thorough job of earning his trust. Draco downed the potion and waited to see if he could feel the effects. Well, it seemed like his heart was beating faster, so there was that.
It hit like a brick to the gut. Draco found Claire and himself shoved into the back alley, and all he could manage to say was, "His wife?"
On some level he’d known from the moment Pansy told him that all the eighth-years would be living together that he’d end up far too close to Potter. Why be reasonable when you can force the issue? When the four houses had cleared out, McGonagall addressed the eighth years. Draco tuned her out as she explained the new housing situation. He stared into his cup and his mind drifted to what the Slytherin first years were seeing for the first time. He hoped the dungeons didn’t scare them. He hoped the older kids were playing nice.
"The Muggles. Your relatives. Where are they now? You don't want me to kill them, fine. There are other ways to make life intolerable."
Ha. Who needed Potter’s friends? “No offense, but isn’t it a bit late to be cramming Occlumency? The Dark--Vol--You Know Who is dead, so what’s the hurry?”
After the singing, Draco snuck away upstairs. It was meant to be a family time. He didn’t feel unwelcome, exactly. Just unnecessary.
Draco snorted. "I didn't actually think that McGonagall would go for that. But it was worth giving it a go."
Draco wasn’t sure exactly where his frustration stemmed from. But it poked at the inside of his chest like a burning needle. “You told me I can’t learn to cast a patronus,” he snapped. “No matter how strong of a wizard I am, or how many times I practice the damn incantation, I can’t do it because I can’t manage my own happiness. How the hell does any of this matter if I can’t--if I’m not--” He shouldn’t have risked a glance at Potter then, but he did, and Potter’s eyes were pooled with pity.
He took a few steps toward the door. He felt sick, but he was actually going to make his escape. “Oh, and Potter, tell your--” he stumbled over the word, “your m--muggleborn friend and the Weasel to stay the hell away from me.”
Big <3 to people in tough, unsafe, or unsupportive coronavirus situations. And big <3 to the adults who want to protect kids, but don't always have that power.
But he was just staring back at Hermione and Ron and Pansy, while Seamus was still trying to figure out how two of his four test subjects preferred Viktor Krum over anyone else at the school. Draco was blushing. It was suspicious.
McGonagall, as usual, was all business. “Granger, Parkinson, take all of these children to their common rooms. Weasely, I’d like you to go to the staff room and notify the heads of house that these students have had a scare.”
“Bloody—what are you still doing here, Neville?” Draco asked, irritated that Neville had made him jump again.
“No one’s dragging you, Ron,” Hermione said, her attention half on her reading. “But listen to this: For the period that the court does designate, the defendant shall not use any extraneous magic. Magic shall be used only when required. Required magic includes spells assigned in classrooms at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Any magic judged to be in excess of that required will be grounds for the defendant to lose the privilege of owning a wand. Repeat infractions will lead to further legal consequences, which could include house arrest, expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or imprisonment in Azkaban.”
“You’re not even trying, Malfoy,” Potter responded in a growl. When you couldn’t do the Patronus, you gave up. You refuse to teach the eighth years occlumency, which you’d be good at, and now you won’t even try--”
Potter had landed and was now rubbing his hand through his windswept hair. “I just didn’t want to crash,” he muttered.
Draco followed her, and she turned sharply. “Oh,” he said, memory rising in him like a wave of nausea. “This used to be Nocturn Alley.”
Harry grinned. There were good players on the team this year, and without having to worry about the drama of whether or not Harry would be able to complete a match, they were a lot more consistent. "I think they're going to destroy Slytherin,"
Business had slowed by that evening at eight, and both of the Weasley's were perched on the front counter. Fred was tossing test candy at George's open mouth.
Draco fought not to think of Granger and Weasley as friends. It wouldn’t have been fair. But they spent many of the their free hours over the next week working together in the library or the common room, poring over their legal texts and marking up the paper. Sometimes Ron would bring his classwork to complete first, and Draco helped him with potions a few times. Ron seemed to be in charge of providing snacks, since all the house elves were obsessed with him. But Draco tried to keep everything straight in his head: Granger was pretending to be friends with Pansy to help the rest of the castle move on after the war, and Weasley just played along with whatever Hermione did all the time. Granger, not Hermione. He couldn’t even keep that straight, and it didn’t help that both of them had taken to calling him Draco whenever they felt like it. Didn’t they understand he needed the boundaries to be clear? Did they not see how easily Pansy and he could be taken in by their false friendship?
Draco found himself poking his head into the Professor’s office adjacent to the classroom. It looked like someone had cleaned out some of the Carrow’s things, but it didn’t seem to be in current use. Still--there was a teapot, and two cups, and tea leaves. The teapot itself was enchanted, fortunately, so Draco didn’t have to use any of his own magic.
Draco laughed bitterly. "That's just because you like beating me at things. We can do that any time."
Harry laughed. “Come on, aren’t you supposed to say, ‘I’d like to see you try,’ or something like that?
He certainly wouldn’t. “If you have a problem with the situation, you can take it up with the Ministry or Headmistress McGonagall,” he said. It sounded less bored than he’d meant and more panicky, but he would take what he could get. It was difficult enough to say that, and he know it would be the last thing he could manage for a while. His throat was growing tight, and his face was hot. He hoped they couldn’t tell from behind how upset he was.
“I think the Minister would be hard pressed to convince her to get rid of you or your little pet savior, but do you really think she’d miss us? I have transfiguration still, and she hasn’t said my name once this year. She looks right past me like I’m not in the room. She’d be glad of a reason to get rid of us.”
“We can trade rooms, Potter. People have legitimate concerns about your safety.” He might as well say it before anyone else made comments about him being a danger to Potter’s life.
Harry retched, only partially in play. "Thank Merlin you didn't bring that up. Disgusting." He picked up a saucer covered with pink rosettes from the place where it had landed, miraculously unbroken, on the ground. Did it have some kind of unbreakable spell? Could it be dangerous?
He skidded onto the block, glancing over his shoulder once to see the ministry official still shuffling behind him. Draco wasn't sure why the man hadn't drawn his wand and stunned Draco already, but he was grateful. Just another twenty feet--Draco grabbed the ledge of Potter's picture window, and his heart nearly burst.
It was that Harry that had started appearing on the packages of the Daydream Dummies and Five-minute Fancies whenever Draco stocked the shelves.
Draco twitched his wand and the fireflies that had been flitting around the quartet dropped to the floor as stones. “Where is she?”
Two Slytherin boys stood up and pulled their wands, then almost simultaneously cast ghostly patronus charms.
“Not something I carry around, Pansy. One of the benefits of not drinking myself silly in a room full of people who’d like to see me dead.”
"Well," George dusted himself off. "Draco, since you like walking in the snow so much, why don't you run this over to the bank and tell them it's from trash with love. Or something cleverer. I bet you can think of something cleverer on the way over there," he grinned. "And then you'll meet us at Harry’s place, won't you? The whole family's going to be there, and you can bring Teddy. You and Harry hardly said two words to each other today, I bet he'd love to have you there."
It was too dim to see much of Harry’s face, but Draco could see the way his hands were working in and out of fists.
It was harder than he anticipated, and not because of Potter. The next morning, Potter seemed just as eager as Draco not to talk. They moved around each other like the repellent ends of magnets. It was Granger and Weasley and--curse it all--Pansy that made it impossible.
Pansy’s mouth dropped open even wider, if that was possible. “And Potter liked Draco’s wand the best?”
He tried to get back to his feet, but he couldn’t step forward. It didn’t matter. He could run--he could search every street in London, and it didn’t mean he’d be able to find the kids who were missing from the home. Even if he did, it wouldn’t fix anything. He’d found Teddy, and it had still been all wrong.
He looked up. Someone was approaching him through the swirling snow, someone in Ministry robes. His heart lurched, and he reached for his wand, forgetting that it no longer existed. Only--there it was again, in the pocket of his coat.
He slammed the loaner wand on the the wand on the desk, furious. Potter was helping everyone but him. It wasn’t as if he thought Potter’s help would make a big difference, but why wasn’t he worth the attention?
The house elf stopped short of the dining room. "Stay here," he snapped. "Do not be invading Master Potter's space."
That night, after Potter’s screams ripped him from sleep. Draco sat upright in bed, not certain what he should do. Get up? Say something? Better to let Neville handle it.
Hermione opened her mouth, shocked, but Harry didn't want to stick around, not even to explain that he wasn't quitting the living thing, he just needed a break so he could make sure he was doing it right. This was the right thing to do, he knew this was right, but Hermione always thought she knew better.
The first trouble was at the Leaky Cauldron. Draco knew better than to expect a knowing nod from the bartender. The patrons of the Leaky tolerated Draco, but they didn't like him hanging around. He hadn't expected Tom the bartender to hold up a hand when he headed for the backdoor.
Draco left his wand on the desk and stormed out of the room, making sure that Potter had a dramatic exit to watch.
And he couldn't go home to Andromeda. Or Teddy. He didn't want the Aurors to come shouting in, waving their wands and shooting spells at him while Teddy cowered and cried. He would at least keep that unspoken promise to Andromeda. He wouldn't bring the trouble home, to Teddy.
In the Weasley house--he didn’t want to even think the word “Burrow” about a structure that he’d be sleeping in--getting into the bathroom was a minor miracle, and every minute spent therein was at a premium. He’d gone down to scope it out a minute ago, and Hermione, Ginny and Fleur had all be crowded inside, brushing their teeth.
“As much fun as it would be to drag this out over the rest of the year, I already decided I want to be able to focus on schoolwork for this small, promising window. So we’re going to put this to rest now.” Hermione said.
Ron sat next to Potter and grabbed Potter’s shoulder urgently. “Harry, I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have ever let them send you back.”
and then she’d trailed off with a devious look on her face, and Draco had refused to speak to her until she promised that she would stop saying things that made the whole situation worse.
“Don’t tell me,” Granger frowned. “He’s sneaking around, he’s not eating, he’s probably up to something.”
He wished more than ever that all the eighth years hadn’t been crowded into one room. He would give anything for a place to go where Potter and his impossible to shake friends wouldn’t pop up. Potter’s friends. He’d warned himself not to think of them as friends, and this was why. When it came to being honest with Potter or protecting Draco from humiliation, they chose Potter.
He sounded like such a mini-Potter. This was what happened when they let the hero teach the first years. First years who thought they could save everybody. Slytherin first years who thought they could save everybody.
“I sort of forgot about it. But I was also having a hard time giving it up. It--I’ve gotten attached to it. But I didn’t recognize that you hadn’t really gotten a wand that would work for you.”
This was. Not what Draco had been expecting at breakfast. Besides, if Granger was trying to discover the limits of their power, why was she doing it with their full knowledge?
Draco was ready to die from embarrassment. "No," he protested. "Nobody needs to--" But it was too late. Everyone was already dumping purses and pocketfuls of galleons into the pot.
The front steps were slippery, and he sat down abruptly in the snow. Cold shocked his hands and back, and it seemed to be exactly what he'd needed to snap back into full consciousness. The dizziness and confusion disappeared, and he was left with reality: He’d lost everything the Weasley's had worked for.
Of course, during their next Defense class, Potter thought he should facilitate Draco into greater misery by announcing the good news in front of all the other eighth years. “Draco’s got his Patronus!”
Draco wished he could fix it, but there was no way for him to make it better. If he walked over there and told them what an honor it was to be part of the great tradition of Slytherin, they would be sickened by him. He was the reason they were ashamed to be in the house. It would be a favor to everyone if he wasn’t here.
Sam spun around in their seat, glaring at Hariot. "That's kind of the point of this class, isn't it, Devon? So we learn how to do it before it actually happens to us, because by then it might be too late."
The school year is coming to a close, but there are so many good things ahead for our favorite magic kids.
“Yes. She’s fine, but class was a total waste. Of course everyone wanted to talk about what happened. You should have been there. Sam could not stop talking about how you jumped right into action and saved the day. They must have talked about you for fully half of the class.”
"Great," Draco surveyed the room. "Now it's who-knows-how-long after midnight, and I'm exhausted, and all of your pawing at me has made this room messier than when we started."
Draco followed, eyes trained straight ahead. The other beds were taken, so he quickly maneuvered his chest to the bed closest to the door and began arranging his school supplies and books where they belonged. It didn’t take long, even by his precise demands. By the time he was done, Weasley and the other eighth year boys had entered the room and were looking at him with various degrees of suspicion.
Pansy took the lead, and Draco followed behind, struggling to keep his head up when two patrons near the door sent heated scowls toward him. If there had been more of a crowd, maybe they could have melted away. Maybe it had been a mistake to come when there were so few people. He forced himself to keep moving. First stop, school books.
The first years’ sorting finished and food appeared before them, but there was still an uneasy quiet over the hall. Several of the first years were crying softly at their table, and even though the Slytherins there were trying to be welcoming, it felt hollow.
Hermione looked up over the cover of her book. “Pansy, it’s our last term at Hogwarts, and for once I don’t believe one of our professors is trying to kill us. You two both have use of your magic again, and Harry seems to be pulling out of his self-destructive nose dive. This is perhaps the only term at Hogwarts I have actually had uninterrupted time for my academics. I am going to study, thank you.”
Draco must have paused too long, trying to determine the right balance between a sharp retort and something that Potter would deem funny because Potter bristled, “You don’t have to say anything if it’s top secret.”
Draco nudged her against the muddy bank of the river and let himself collapse. Who knew what kind of filth he was marinating in, but standing up seemed a bit much to ask at the moment.
"Do whatever you like," Draco answered, hoping that whatever color the frocks ended up, they'd be on the kids in fifteen minutes.
Harry felt like Ginny had slapped him. She was so calm about this, almost business-like, but his heart was thudding. "So I'm the problem?"
“They repurposed it after the war,” she said.There had never been a cemetery anywhere near Diagon Alley. But they were walking between gravestones now, and Claire scuffed her dress shoes by a single stone in a double plot.
Draco hugged his peacoat tighter to protect himself from the stinging snow. The weather recommended something warmer, but there were two problems with that. One, his black peacoat looked excellent on him. Two, it was the only coat he currently owned.
The compartment door opened once again, and Pansy’s face appeared. “Thank Merlin I found you. Not everyone seems fond of having me poking my head into their spots. Also, none of you sent me nearly as much post as I requested.” She stowed her bag. “Potter, shove over."
Pansy counted out the money and dropped it, then spun on her heel and exited the store, leaving Draco alone.
Flurries of snow blew past the windows of the Defense classroom, obscuring any view of the grounds. Draco pouted in their direction. For the day before the Winter Holidays, Potter had placed a series of curses on packages and given them to the whole class to open. He’d done the same thing for the first years and Draco had been there to make sure kids got unjinxed whenever they missed a spell. But the 8th year Defense class had moved on to some pretty complicated curse and jinx breaking, but he couldn’t seem to do anything correctly. Draco had managed to get his nose jinxed green unwrapping the first package, and Ron had quipped that he looked very festive.
And then the sympathy gagging started. Harry rushed to clean up the mess and open the window, sending a breath of fresh air through the classroom. Still, by the time the two students were gone and everyone had stopped gagging and complaining about how gross the room smelled, Harry couldn't remember what he'd been saying. Something about transformations and disguises. He sighed.
“I can see what you’re scrambling to hide,” Snape said, sounding bored. “The more panicked you are about hiding your secrets, the easier they are to uncover. The more you think about the things you don’t want me to know, the more they become you.
He leaned back to give Draco a more appraising look down his nose. "Potter sent a panicked Patronus to the ministry. There weren't many of us left there by that point, but we've been scouring the streets looking for you."
Draco had had very few real interactions with Ginny Weasley in the past. Playing Quidditch against someone or targeting them as part of a large group didn’t allow much room for individual impressions. But he’d been so certain he disliked her because she was actually cloying and obnoxious. He might have to re-examine that.
He glowered. “For now. No long-term promises on that front. How come you’re using a muggle toothbrush?”
Ron’s words didn’t have the sting they would have once, but Draco was still pouting. Who knew what else the packages would do, and his looks were all he had left.
"I don't understand what I did wrong. I thought it was better to not bring it up after you stormed off on me."
Draco winced. “I’m right in here. Doing my homework, if they want to see me doing normal person stuff. You could bring through a tour group.”
Draco was right. His words lit up seven kinds of fears and defenses within Harry, but it was what Draco could offer. Had offered. Real. Draco was misty and smeared through Harry's vision, but there was no mistaking the rage.
*Sort of sorry that there's a lot more teaching than Draco in this chapter, but, uh... have some Lacey?
Draco had never talked with Potter at the same time as Ron and Hermione. When they cornered him in the Common Room, Potter with that same brain-fire light coming from his eyes, Draco looked for an escape. He even grabbed his wand. Not that they would hurt him, but his wand would be in hand. He might need to disappear.
Was this doing any good? Draco peered down at Lacey. Her edges looked more firm, and she had enough muscle control to grip her wand. “Expec-expecto--” she tried.
“I don’t know,” Ron said when they met in the entry hall before dinner. “They don’t look like they’ve been
True, there was a dull ache inside Harry when he looked up at the Gryffindor Seeker. There was a part of him that wanted to be up on the broom, a part of him that could remember all the Quidditch that Ginny and he had played together and how they'd come back to the common room laughing so hard that they couldn't breathe. He wasn't sure which he missed more--quidditch or Ginny.
“Tell her I’m sorry I can’t come. It’s the nicest--it’s beyond nice, though. You’ll enjoy your holiday much more if I’m not around.”
Draco considered, again, the usefulness of trying to explain to Teddy that most people couldn't change the way Teddy could.
Malfoy shook himself. Hermione was standing on the other end of the table with hands on hips. “Pardon?”
Pansy’s face didn’t hold a hint of amusement. In fact, she looked pained. “Maybe he wasn’t being clueless. Maybe he got it, but he didn’t want to get it.”
“She wanted to talk about your trial. She thinks she’s come up with something that they’ll have to listen to, but she wanted to talk to you about it all. Left a note on your bed.”
“You’re saying you’ve got no supervision and they don’t even know what you’ve been doing with the first years.”
They were all there. Not just the kids that he'd come to love and worry about so much, but Teddy and Andromeda were there too. Fred and George were pointing wands at the train set, making it fly around the room, shooting bubbles from the smokestack. Luna was there, too, fitting strange goggles onto one of the youngest kids.
Draco straightened his tie and eyed his reflection in the mirror. Nearly flawless. There was a scar, now, that cut through one of his eyebrows. It gave the boy--the man?--in the reflection an unsteady gaze. He held one hand across that side of his face. The stare looked more haughty, more sure. An illusion of traveling back in time.
After gifts there was the enormous breakfast. Draco opted for the proteins and light carbs that would fuel his Quidditch victory, but most of the Weasely family seemed happy to linger over the breakfast rolls that Mrs. Weasely had baked and double up on servings of hash.
Harry spun around, and he felt Draco put a hand on his elbow. "I can," he said fiercely. "I can just quit. I'm not locked in by some prophecy anymore. I'm not the chosen one, and it doesn't matter how bad Robards and McGonagall want me. I
Draco glanced at the list of tester questions and back to Potter. The questions were innocuous enough, as long as they stuck to them. As long as Potter didn’t try to get fancy.
He looked back to the twins. George snapped his mouth shut, and a candy bounced off his nose. Fred slid from the counter, adopting his easy smile. "What can I help you gentlepersons with? Looking for some stocking-stuffers for the little ones? Or have you got a security--"
So Draco couldn't complain when business picked up again around the holidays. In fact, as the knuts and sickles started to stack up, he’d been the one to suggest a Christmas Eve extravaganza. Music, pictures with Santa, homemade cookies and cocoa.
Draco stood up abruptly. “It’s just the price of surviving when no one wants us around.” And with that, he strode away from the table, trying to control his breathing, trying to starve the predatory thoughts.
Harry’s eyes closed, cutting off the sharpness, but also hiding whatever other expressions Draco could try to read. “I’m glad you’re back.”
He didn't bother to explain why they did keep Draco on. Maybe it was so that they'd have someone to open the shop and turn on the lights early in the morning while Fred and George snoozed until the last minute. Or maybe, more likely, it was pity. Either way, Draco was the one responsible for being there early, starting a fire to warm the shop and re-starting the spells that made the hat on top of the building rise and fall, covering the rabbit.
Harry laughed, relief coloring his voice. More feet settled around them, and Draco struggled to sit up.
Regardless, enjoy the sugar quills, share with your friends, and we look forward to hearing from you again soon
A strange feeling stirred in Draco at those words. He starved a thought, no thanks to Pansy staring at him, open-mouthed.
Draco tore his hand from Claire’s, and at first his feet moved woodenly. He picked up speed at the end of the block and turned onto Diagon Alley again. His legs were hurting, and he didn't think these boots were meant for that much running. And none of that would have mattered, but everything inside him was crumbling.
“I just think it’s a bit of a waste paying for a Defense book when you could've written the whole thing yourself.”
Draco was looking at Potter’s crooked smile and trying to remember how to sort his thoughts when the door opened and Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley stormed into the Defense classroom.
"I can't sit down and be still and try to think through this. It's too--" Harry waved his hands around in the air, still facing the cupboard. "It's too. And you wouldn't like my thoughts. I don't have things sorted out the way you do. You say one thing, and my mind goes off in seven different directions. I can't keep track of what I'm thinking or feeling, and it's a mess trying to share it with you."
“What did Harry want to talk to you about after class?” Granger asked, as if to get right to the spying.
“Malfoy!” the feet hurried toward him, and then Potter dropped to his knees. “Malfoy, are you okay?”
Draco huffed, but Harry could tell he was only half as annoyed as he was pretending to be. "They're going to let Lacey stay at Hogwarts with me over the summer."
"Dumbledore." The word was like tossing a penny into the fountain. The splashes, the ripples, the wish. "Dumbledore decided I should stay with my aunt and uncle. And my cousin. They hated me. And it's so hard--it's so hard when you're surrounded by people who hate you to find a way to get anyone to like you."
Potter held a hand out toward the door and it swung open before he could touch it. The two walked in and were greeted by a common room not unlike the Slytherin common room, except that the color scheme was all in shades of black and white.
“The what?” Draco frowned. Now that he was actually on the brink of doing this, all of it seemed like a very bad idea. “Are you sure it’s a good idea to take Hagrid? I don’t think the Ministry likes him much, and he certainly doesn’t like me.”
Draco spun around. Lockhart was standing there with snow collecting on his hat. "If it isn't the littlest Death Eater. You don't look like you're having a very good Christmas Eve, Mr. Malfoy. What seems to be the problem?"
Harry spun around in a panic to find one of his charges was, indeed, halfway up the shelves. Draco pressed a hand over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud as Harry made an athletic bound over some kids on the floor and swerved around a little family to peel the boy off the wall.
Luna was the best at remembering to think about the children's emotional health, even if it was usually couched in language about mythical fantastic beasts. The kids that came to stay with Harry all had slightly different stories. Some of them were orphans of the war--from either side--not lucky enough to have grans and cousins and godfathers to look after them. Some of their parents, like Jamie's and Holly's, were non-magical and disagreed with the fact that their kids were wizards. Some of them, like Zoe, had parents who were convinced they'd had a son and didn’t appreciate it when Zoe explained she was their daughter. And then there were kids like Thom, whose family didn't actually have anything to disagree with him about, since they seemed to function by pretending that he'd never existed. Potter had officially scheduled appointments for the kids with mind healers on a regular basis, but Luna was the best at reminding them to think about it in the in-between times.
"That's not--I mean that is important, of course it is. George and Fred are important to me. But I couldn't do this without you. I don't know if you understand that."
He entered the Great Hall and kept his chin up, gaze unfocused as he marched between the Slytherin and Ravenclaw tables. They were there, ahead, but he didn’t let himself register whether they were looking his way, or what kind of expression they had on their face, or any of it.
"If we were," Potter answered, "We wouldn't be doing it in your joke shop. Speaking of which, Malfoy. You really ought to come down and see all this for yourself some time."
Draco searched his memory for some kind of fantastic beast that controlled the weather and might think itself an angel. He was coming up empty. He was also running out of strategies for dealing with cracked teenage girls.  "Luna!" he exclaimed suddenly.
When Harry did get around to asking, Draco agreed to the Polyjuice trick, and Slughorn was happy to help Harry out by providing Polyjuice from his stores. Harry has thought switching bodies would be fun and definitely instructive right up until the moment that Draco and he were both standing in their room, wearing each other's clothes and holding their cups. Draco grinned and held his portion high. "To our health." Harry could tell from the  silly ceremony that Draco was putting into it that Draco was feeling nervous about the exchange, too. Maybe he wasn't entirely pants at figuring out how Draco was feeling.
Moving in with Andromeda had been as uncomfortable as anything else in the year right after the war. His mother had gone about the matchmaking, writing to Andromeda about how important it was for Draco to align himself with the right sort of witches and wizards at this crucial time. In other words, she and Lucius were on house arrest, but she didn't want Draco getting lumped into that. And, she reasoned, Andromeda would need help with little Teddy.
Was that supposed to make Draco feel better? “So these first years are just exceptionally powerful wizards and witches, then?” He could hear the heat and frustration dripping with his words. He shouldn’t let Potter think he cared about the spell. He shouldn’t let Potter think that Azkaban and its guards were always waiting for his watch to drop so they could invade his thoughts.
“I tried the ice trick,” a Ravenclaw submitted. That explained the pile of ice cubes sitting beside Lacey. Draco could hardly believe they’d remembered the ice trick. He’d told them if the things inside their head felt stronger than anything outside their head, they could use something to anchor them in the physical, like squeezing an ice cube. They’d tried. What could he try that they hadn’t?
Claire held his hand as he stood frozen in the street. "I know you think all the color in the house comes from Teddy, but without you, that's what the two of them have. You see, Draco Malfoy, you really have a wonderful life."
“They wanted to know why ours are matching. And I tried telling them about Snape’s Patronus, and how the two of you were really close, but they got it in your head that you--well, that it was more about me than Snape. So I was talking to Hermione and Ron about it, trying to see what they thought, and they said that you’d be the person to ask. So?”
“Stop looking at me like that, Malfoy,” she said, pouring herself a glass of water. “I know Pansy told you.”
Neville hurried over to Potter’s bed, but not before Draco heard Potter muttering the same questions as last night. He swung his legs out of bed and crossed the room. “As you can see, Potter, I’m alive and unhurt. Now whether this was your fear or sets your fears to rest, I don’t know, but that’s the status.”
The door opened, and Draco tried to pull the sweater back into place, but in his panic it had gotten hung up on his elbow, and he was trapped. The only way out of this was through. Draco pulled the jumper all the way off and held it clutched in one fist. Instead of snatching up his shirt and buttoning it into place, he stood facing Potter and Ron. Waiting.
Harry looked ready to shout, so Hermione interrupted. “No, we’d just noticed that he was acting strangely in class and told Dumbledore about it.”
He saw Potter wheel his broom, head swiveling to calculate the right angle and speed to interfere. Draco steeled himself for Potter’s weight to hit him from the right. They were only a few meters from it. If Draco could somehow keep his direction for just a bit longer. And then Potter startled him completely by pulling up and out of the way. Draco zoomed forward, and his hand closed around the snitch. He let Draco catch the snitch.
Potter sank into a chair. Since the common room was empty, he could have seated himself closer to the fire or at least sat across from Draco. Instead, he sat in the chair just next to him, so close that the arms of the chair were touching. So that if Harry put his arm down there, it would brush Draco’s.
Harry paused, but Draco didn’t know what response to give. He let out a breath slowly, that breath and the soft pop of the embers the last sounds in the room.
Draco's eyes narrowed as he flipped and turned the package, studying it from different angles and casting a quick jinx-detection charm on it.
There were, in fact, two Aurors standing in the corner, sipping from cups of cocoa. Draco took a steadying breath and stepped toward them. "I'm ready to go with you," he said. "I don't want to make a scene in front of the kids."
“Sit up, Pansy, so Malfoy has somewhere to sit,” Hermione chided, and Pansy pulled herself into a crunch position until Draco sat down on the couch. Then she let her head flop down on his lap and purred.
Granger and Weasley had been bickering about something, but they trailed off and turned toward Draco. He couldn’t read their expressions. Pansy though, looked shocked.
The game was a comedy. Hermione disliked flying in general, but Angelina and Arthur wanted to include her, so they kept sending the quaffle her way. Ginny didn’t have any of the same compunctions about sharing, but whenever the ball was sent Percy’s way, he covered his face and screamed. Ginny managed to score on Ron twice.
Draco shrugged. He wanted to talk this through with Pansy from every angle, but he knew better. Those were thoughts to starve, not feed. “What’s with the sudden interest?
“Harry, you’re doing all you can. You’ve taught them how to protect themselves, and better, how to protect each other. Lacey and the first years had everything they needed because you gave them that. They didn’t need you to be there.”
Harry stared at the picture, suddenly wishing that he'd asked Luna to paint something less honest. Less obvious. It was Harry and Ron and Hermione and Draco and Pansy. And Neville, because at the last minute Harry had said Luna better at Neville as well, because for reasons Harry didn't understand, Draco and Neville seemed to get on. They were linked together by the golden word, painted again and again in Luna's spidery magical handwriting. Friends, friends, friends, friends.
He wished Potter were here to do this. If Potter was the one making foolhardy choices, it wouldn’t turn out with an obscurial destroying the tower and killing half the Gryffindors. With Draco in charge, there was no way of knowing how terribly this could end.
"I do understand," Draco said. "I know I help you keep this place going. And it means the world to me."
Draco stuck out his chin. "You do, but only if I go after you first. I'm always the one who starts things. You give in or feel sorry for me and play along."
"I think I'm going to go to the sea," Harry said, talking more quickly now. "And I'll see a bunch of Harpies matches, although I don't suppose Ginny will play too much when she's just getting started, and I'm going to have dinners with Ron and hear about his cases. And I'm going to snog Draco as often as possible."
“I heard a couple of the seventh years on the platform talking about the housing situation. They said all the eighth years are going to be together in one dorm.”
