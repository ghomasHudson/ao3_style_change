The last couple of weeks of term passed slowly. Harry’s nightmares were particularly bad, and particularly disturbing. Every single one involved Malfoy, usually violently sexual. When Harry started waking up, covered on cold sweat and with sticky pyjama trousers, he decided to get a Sleeping potion from Madam Pomfrey, hoping it would curb the strange, sick wet dreams he was so ashamed of. The last few days before the Christmas holidays started were better, sleeping and eating were easier, until he finally saw Draco.
"What do you suggest?" He asked, wanting to pull his hand away. He could still feel the heavy warmth of Anthony's hand on his shoulder. He wanted a very hot bath and to scrub the feeling away. Blaise seemed to realise this and let go, looking down as he thought hard.
They looked disappointed, and then angry.
"Did they hurt you? Try to hurt you?" Harry asked, frowning in concern rather than impatience now. Draco cleared his throat, looked around the room and, instantly, a pitcher of water and two glasses appeared. He let out a soft 'ah' before carefully pouring them each a glass, sipping his own and avoiding Harry's eye. He took a breath before replying, holding the glass in both hands.
Blaise Zabini comforts Draco Malfoy after a run-in with Harry Potter, sitting fully clothed in the (frankly, very extra) shower at their new flat in London. Angst, crying, cuddling, all those good things.
The werewolf grinned his hideous teeth at him, one long thick clawed hand drawing his wand slowly from his belt, equally long, thick and clawed. Greyback wasn't a powerful wizard by any stretch of the imagination, he hardly used his gnarled wand at all, but he could cast his fair share of horrifyingly painful spells.
“Snape did something...took a white thing from my head.” Crabbe said slowly, turning away from Draco and Blaise. He looked at Pansy because she was in front of him, and she stared back fixedly.
Once this pitcher was empty, and the group of Slytherins were a little drunk, the Monster began to put its plan into action.
They stayed in the shower for a while, Blaise periodically turning the temperature up until it was at a good almost-hot and Draco was relaxed and calm again. They got out after a brief discussion and removed their soaked clothes, dropping them on the shower floor to be dealt with later. They dried themselves quickly, and Draco got dressed into the clothes Blaise had brought in while Blaise himself got something for himself from the crate. They reconvened in the living room and decided to watch a film, using the sofa bed since their mattress and bedframe had been packed already. It was still made up for sleep from their hasty exit that morning, needing to get to their last letting agent appointment.
They sat down and began eating, trying to relax amongst their respectfully pleasant friends even as the entire hall watched them and gossiped. Hermione chanced a look at the Slytherin table, finding Blaise just getting up to leave his friends and Pansy staring daggers directly back at her.
“So, we'll see you after New Year, ok, Harry?” Hermione asked, frowning slightly at him. He looked at her and smiled, nodding.
"Ron, his family were prisoners-"
"Good night, Blaise." He said, slightly muffled. Blaise huffed a laugh, hesitantly wrapping an arm around Draco. It was exquisitely warm beside his friend, sharing the green quilt and soft mattress. Running his other hand through Draco's slightly damp hair, his arm beneath his own head, Blaise kissed the soft mop of white blond and settled himself down. He dropped off within minutes, and neither of them dreamed a thing.
“Draco?” Harry's soft voice asked, and he returned to the world with a small jolt. He was sitting on the mattress, the fire crackling behind Potter and making his hair look even wilder.
This time, though, he looked around to see Hermione and Draco there as well, the three of them all standing in the same places they had been sitting, but Shell Cottage was gone.
“Well, Potter, wandering the corridors during dinner? Tired of all your adoring public?” he sneered, his prefect badge shining on his black robes
won't."
“Your eyes were red…” Draco said after a moment, not looking at Harry. Harry’s breathing caught.
“So, this is happening now, is it?” He asked with a chuckle. Blaise smirked and shrugged.
"It's alright." He said, though he'd gone pale and his hand was shaking as it gripped Blaise's sleeve. "It was good to see you, Potter." He said, valiantly trying to smile at him. Harry returned the gesture weakly, nodding as he stepped back once more.
"One more thing…" Hermione said, perching on the end of the other sofa nearest Draco. Who looked at her through the sides of his eyes, tensing again. "Harry noticed a… a scar on your neck, a bite mark from a werewolf," Draco flinched, hand shooting to the exact spot, between the juncture of his throat and shoulder, towards the back. The line was an elegant slope, his bones delicate. Painfully so. "Can you explain that, please? How is it you're not…-" she trailed off, and Draco swallowed.
“You did in second year…” Draco muttered, sounding resignedly impatient. Harry gaped at him.
"Yeah, you too. I, um…" what the hell was he suppose to say, "I hope you're happy, Draco. I really do." He said, feeling tears in his eyes. He took a deep breath and sniffed, smiling. "Congrats again on the new flat. See you around." He said, and Draco nodded stiffly. Blaise gave Harry a measured but approving look, watching him back away. Harry sighed, finally feeling like he was far enough away to turn, and went to join his girlfriend.
"All they want is information." Harry added quickly, realising how this might sound to someone who had been through what Draco had clearly been through. He hadn't shared it with the others yet, what the bruises he'd seen meant, thinking it wasn't his to share. But maybe he should, if only to get Ron to be a bit nicer to him.
Their faces were inches apart, their breaths and moans intermingling in the hot air between them. Harry stared down at Draco, his poor vision having made it hard to see his expression without being this close. Tears were rolling down Draco’s cheeks, his mouth was open and wet, his tongue undulating invitingly over and against his teeth, which occasionally brushed his bottom lip, which was plump and raw from kissing. It was much pinker than usual, as were his cheeks and around his eyes. His eyes were what struck Harry the most. His eyes looked like hot metal, shimmering and incandescent silver, alive with want and lust.
“We tried to wait out the snow in a shelter but-”
Then the Monster grabbed Draco’s shoulders and pushed them forward, gripping his cock hard so he bent at the waist over Crabbe with a gasp. Draco’s hands found his friend’s shoulders, which he gripped as he let out a sob, begging Harry not to do this. The Monster pulled Draco’s trousers down fully, exposing the arse it had enjoyed so much last time, and drew Harry’s wand to cast the Lubrico charm. Draco jumped as the cold liquid spurted inside him, his head dropping in front of Crabbe’s face. Crabbe’s eyes were clearly watching, clearly utterly horrified and confused, the Monster loved it. It pulled the cloak up to reveal Harry’s own hard cock, making sure Crabbe got a good look at it before shoving it all the way inside Draco.
It was dark by the time Draco realised how long he'd stayed in the Room with Potter, and how much he'd enjoyed the day. They'd laughed and talked and had so much fun that it didn't matter who they were or what they did the night before, they were simply friends there.
“We should head back, yeah?” he asked his friend, picking up the pretty little statue with a proud smile, shoving it in his pocket. He looked at Draco, frowning. “You alright?” he asked. Draco looked pretty awful, pale and shaky and clearly on the verge of tears. He nodded, clearing his throat and putting his Malfoy mask on.
Draco looked up at Harry, finally, and seemed to flounder when they made direct eye contact. Harry was blushing too and Pansy was grinning between them.
Draco's mouth moved minutely, open and shut, like he was tasting those words. Then he gulped, absorbing them. Blaise took this moment of clarity as some sort of reliquishment and took another step closer, glad when he didn't flinch too badly.
"Crunchy Nut Cornflakes." Hermione insisted.
“Oh my God, how awful… Poor Draco!” she said, looking upset. “So, you think You-Know-Who cursed him to need to do these… things?” Harry nodded. “But why? For revenge?”
He grabbed Malfoy, picking him up. He was lighter than he’d expected, but his constant, albeit weak, struggles against Harry made him difficult to manoeuvre. He half carried, half dragged Draco to the boys’ bathroom, which was, thankfully, empty. He closed the door, then took Draco into a cubicle and locked it, sitting down on the toilet seat with Draco practically on his lap, his hand over Draco’s mouth. He listened intently, worried whoever it was would come into the toilets. They stayed there, both panting, Harry waiting. After enough time had passed and he was sure they were gone, he stood up and shoved Draco into the wall again.
Bright light pierces Harry’s eyelids as he slowly comes to consciousness. He groans, a sharp pain shooting through his head as he rolls gingerly to the side, away from the migraine-inducing glare. His throat, dry and raw, aches as he opens his mouth slightly. He tries to call out to Malfoy, but all that he can produce is a pitiful moan.
Malfoy seems none the wiser as to what Harry had seen, and throws a curious glance at him when he’s still and silent on the bed. “Potter?”
if you have any thoughts, please feel free to leave them or a kudo!! <3 thank you so much for reading!!
“Maybe. What music do you like, Malfoy?”
“Goodnight, Harry.”
The warm water soothes his aching muscles, and the soft music that begins to play soothes his mind. Malfoy hums along to it quietly, and the situation feels… intimate. Maybe even uncomfortably so. But, Harry supposes, that’s how it goes when you have a mysterious magical ailment that you’re trying to solve with your childhood nemesis, who apparently became a good person and Healer-in-training in the year you were out of school.
Harry nods, even though Malfoy can't see it. "Yes," he says. "Okay."
Harry could feel the brokenness. They had to grieve, as a family. He wouldn’t worry them with his issues.
"Come on back, then." He gets up, walking into a small back area- surprisingly clean. "What would you like, exactly?"
He tossed the Floo powder in, and grabbed Harry’s hand to tug him forward into the flash of flames. “Malfoy Manor!” he calls, his voice slightly unstable.
Harry rolls his eyes, letting a small smile grace his face as he turns back to the large wardrobe. He glances over the clothes inside, grabbing a few sweaters, as well as simple shirts. He turns to the bed, dropping his selections on it. He glances up at Malfoy, doing a double take as he sees the absolutely affronted expression on his face as he stares at the pile of tops.
He’s exhausted by the time a small paper bird flits up to him. He lifts his hand, and it lands on his finger, chirping at him before it folds open.
Harry’s face explodes in heat as Malfoy grabs the pot of green Floo powder on the mantel.
Harry’s cheeks warm, and he glares at Malfoy. “Shut up, Malfoy. Come on, then.”
this chapter is very much filler, but i wanted to give harry and draco some time to get comfortable around each other as they work on this project of theirs. i hope you enjoy!!
Harry leans at the waist, his eyes dropping lower on Malfoy's torso to where his shirt tucks into his pants.
Harry turns, seeing Malfoy. He’s leaning against one of the balconies, his hair looking like spun silver against the light of the setting sun. He turns, facing the sky, and Harry walks up behind him. He regards Malfoy, how his eyes are blank as he stares at the sky, how he looks worn and tired. He leans on his folded arms against the balcony as he addresses Harry.
There was a pool of it surrounding Malfoy, and Harry could feel the dampness on his pants where he knelt in it. He ignored the lurch in his stomach, grabbing Malfoy’s forearm with both hands. “Malfoy!” he gritted out, staring down at the pallid face beneath him.
Malfoy lets out a hard laugh. “I’m your only hope then, Potter. The roles are reversed after all this time.” He rubs a hand across his bruised face, sighing. “We’ll go to the Manor.”
“Malfoy?” he whispered. His voice came out shaking and rough.
A cool hand cups his head, fingers gently sliding in between his messy curls. Harry melts into the touch, and the resulting relief. Malfoy crouches down next to him, his thumb rubbing small circles onto his forehead as he looks at him worriedly. “Harry?”
He flinched away from the hand. Clenching his teeth together, he shoved himself up to his knees, whipping around to face the other boy. "What did you say to me, Malfoy?" he growled. His palms were sweating, and he felt a little bit dizzy. "This better not be some sick fucking joke!"
Harry blinks. "What do you mean, no? What could be left?"
“Of course, of course! That’s exactly it, it makes so much sense.”
Harry turns, watching the fireplace intently. Is he going to try and attack me? He backs up slightly, his heel knocking against one of the pieces of covered furniture. He grunts, pulling out his wand and holding it loosely at his side as he shuffles around the furniture.
Malfoy laughs, a tired sound Harry had never heard before in his life. His green eyes flash to Malfoy's grey, and Malfoy looks away, pressing his lips together.
“Coriumtersus,” he said softly, and his skin became clean and dry before Harry’s eyes, including whatever was on his thighs. Draco glanced at Harry before lowering his voice even more to murmur “Internumtersus,” his breath catching and back shivering as he waved his wand. He sighed, placing a shaky hand on the bedpost, using it as a support as he slid himself off the bed. His feet barely touched the ground before his knees buckled and he almost fell, but Harry caught him.
Art by me for Chapter 10: Epilogue: Part 1
They went up to the seventh floor in a cloud of self-absorbed celebration, passing hundreds of sour-faced students, particularly Ravenclaws, as they went. There was alcohol, smuggled in from Hogsmead most likely, and music and so much noise. Harry drank a lot, more than he usually did, and ended up kissing Ginny. It was a mistake, stupid. They hadn't kissed in weeks, barely spoke, Harry had lived in fear of himself and the Monster inside him, guilt tearing him apart. Ginny had wanted to go upstairs, pulling at his sleeves and giving him her bright smile and wanting eyes. But he pulled away, feeling sick and hateful and
"Maybe, maybe not. They've been on their side for too long, they're bloody insidious." He said. "He's a snake, Harry, no matter how caged up and beaten he's been. A starved snake will go to whoever has the food, and still bite them to get it."
“Draco…I’m sorry..! I’m so, so sorry! It w-wasn’t me… S-something was in my head, made me do those things…” his voice shaking with grief. “Please…l-let me help you… I’ll take you to the Hospital W-”
A fist met Draco’s face, sending his head snapping back into the stone wall, his lip bleeding. The Monster gripped the front of Malfoy’s robes and pulled him away from the wall, forcing him over to Snape’s desk. It stripped Draco of his clothes in mere seconds, exposing his skinny body, even skinnier than before, to the cold room, grinning at the Dark Mark burned into his wrist, making sure to squeeze it until Draco screamed. Draco swung at him again, but he seemed dizzy and Harry’s hand caught his fist easily, the Monster forcing the arm behind his back and manoeuvring him to bend over the desk. Draco’s free hand scrabbled over the surface, desperately searching for anything to smash over Potter’s head or stab him with. But it was futile, the Monster’s cunning having seen to that.
“Dumbledore took him to Snape…? Why?” he asked. Blaise shrugged.
“I’ve got some Firewhiskey?” Goyle suggested, regarding his friend with concern. “If nothing else, it’ll help you fall asleep.” He spoke to Draco, whom he knew was having trouble sleeping. He frequently woke up to find the Malfoy boy reading or studying or just sitting in silence, staring into space, but the blond didn’t seem to be listening. Aside from shivering and struggling not to scream or throw up, he didn’t want to look at anyone.
“We don’t blame you, Potter…” McGonagall said quickly, finally meeting his eyes. “Just seeing what You-Know-Who did through you was so awful…forgive us.” He understood how they felt, he felt it himself, saw it every time he closed his eyes… He managed a half smile and a curt nod, and left the office.
Blaise hadn't really been involved in the War, he had no allegiances either way, but his life had been deeply affected just as everyone's had, even without his relationship with Draco. Harry understood the need for territory, something secure to claim in a world of so much loss that was still rebuilding.
“Fuck!” he growled, plunging his fingers into his hair and pulling until it hurt. “What is wrong with me…?”
“Potter hurt him, sir?” he asked. Snape sighed and nodded, Crabbe though his face went a bit soft.
“Oh, shit, I…I forgot to buy socks – I’ll meet you back in the Common Room.” Harry said hastily, unable to stop himself wanting to follow Draco. The others nodded vaguely, saying goodbye as they trudged through the slowly building snowfall. Harry headed back towards the shops, his eyes trained on the Malfoy boy’s retreating form. He went into the Three Broomsticks, and Harry ducked into an alleyway to put his invisibility cloak on. He walked close to the buildings so his footsteps weren’t visible in the settling snow, and waited outside the pub until the door opened, a few students coming out, to slip inside.
“Malfoy, I-”
“Open your mouth.” Harry’s voice said. He didn’t even recognise his own words anymore, they were the Monster’s now. Draco looked at him again, eyes wide and begging silently. Harry’s hand gave another tug on his hair, and Draco looked down again, biting his lip.
Harry settled himself between the blond’s legs, rubbing his own erection, trapped in his trousers, against Draco’s bare one. The roughness of the fabric against the extremely sensitive member made Draco scream and he came again over his own chest, but he remained hard and leaking.
He forced himself to look back at Draco, seeing him clearly now. He was motionless except his shuddering breaths, his eyes squeezed shut – like if he couldn’t see it, then it wasn’t real. Harry went quietly to the bathroom, cleaned himself up before finding a clean cloth, and filling a bowl with warm water. He returned to Draco, still on the desk, and placed the bowl of water down, soaking the cloth in it. And, gently, he began washing Draco’s body. He flinched when Harry first placed the cloth on his right wrist, but didn’t seem to have the energy to care if this was another attack. After a few more moments of Harry washing his skin, Draco spoke.
He placed it on Pansy's palm, then found his own 10p and squeezed it. She frowned at the vibrating coin in her hand, and Harry smiled. "If you feel that, come back here and get him. Hopefully you won't need to, but just in case. I'll try to have him back in bed before breakfast tomorrow." He said. Pansy nodded, pocketing the coin, then patted Blaise's shoulder to rouse him. He reluctantly pulled himself away from Draco, who was whimpering, kissing his forehead with care.
Snape and McGonagall were sitting either side of Dumbledore’s chair behind his desk, a chair set up facing them on the other side. Harry looked at McGonagall, trying to ascertain how she felt about him now, but she wore her usual stern expression. It was Snape who showed his true feelings, more so than usual. His lip curled in disgust as soon as he saw Harry, but seemed to check himself and looked at Dumbledore instead.
Shower scene from
They stood silently for a long time, the damp sea air making them all cold, each picturing the cycle over and over again. It was never ending.
This story is a work of fiction and should not be taken as instruction on how to cope with trauma or mental illness. If you have suffered something traumatic and/or are having thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, seek help. Talk to someone you trust, do not let it fester.
“What happened?” he asked Blaise quietly, glancing at him. He knew Goyle was fond of Draco, even if he’d never admit it, and Blaise decided he deserved to know.
Hermione found Harry sitting on a window sill down the corridor a ways. She cringed at the smell of whiskey and sick clinging to him, but sat beside him and put her arm around him as he sobbed.
“Go on then.” Harry’s voice said cruelly, gripping the white hair tightly, but Draco ignored him besides a small wince. “Don’t make me Imperious you.” Harry warned. “I’ll have you begging Snape to fuck you in the middle of Potions.” Draco looked up at him, steely eyes wide with rage and fear. He knew he’d do it, the Monster he saw as Harry had already used the Cruciatus curse on him. His eyes stared up at him angrily, then darted to his wand, and he took a deep breath.
The hands on his arms move slightly, cupping underneath them so as to support him. They were only needed for a moment, though, as Harry forced himself away from the other boy, staggering slightly to slump down on the bed again. A quiet moan makes its way out of his mouth, and a bout of nausea has him violently retching.
Harry's brows draw together and he points out two silver studs. "I'd like these for the jokers." He then picks two silver rings with emeralds on them. "And those for the snakebites." The man laughs.
There’s multiple guest bedrooms, what looks like an unused office, and what seems to be a small city library in the other doors he opens. As he snaps that particular door shut, he realizes the next door is the one directly opposite Malfoy’s room.
Harry begins to unbutton his shirt, almost shy. He clumsily pushes it off his shoulders when he's done. He lets Malfoy pluck it off the bed, folding it neatly before setting it aside.
Malfoy laughs openly as he follows Harry out of Sirius’ room and down to the living room. Harry is, once again, far too aware of Malfoy’s presence behind him, the heat of his body. Malfoy steps around him to get to the fireplace, his hip brushing against Harry’s.
Harry’s cheeks burn at Malfoy’s choice of words. “Pervert,” he mutters.
“Harry. Stop thinking so much. I can practically hear you trying so hard.”
Malfoy pries her small hands away, murmuring softly to her, words Harry can’t hear. There’s blood there, a dark stain on her crumpled white shirt. Harry’s eyes widen as he watches her tearfully sniffle and grasp desperately at Malfoy.
Malfoy and Harry may be connecting, but they have a long way to go.
I guess I’ll do it the hard way, he thought to himself. He gritted his teeth, reaching back over to hold Malfoy’s arm closed with both hands. He cast desperately around in his mind for any sort of healing spell he had seen used or had used. Something, anything, to stop the bleeding. “Episky!” he called out, his eyes squeezing shut as he felt magic coursing through his hands and into the wound.
“I want to get back, so no one asks questions…” he said, shifting towards the edge of the bed. Harry nodded his agreement, though he knew his own friends no longer questioned him when he was inexplicably absent. He watched Draco gingerly push himself off the bed and stand up, using the bed post for support. He seemed much stronger than he had the night before, the sleep erasing the potion’s effects and healing his body. “I…I don’t have any clothes…” he said, looking down at Harry’s robes and his own bare feet. They’d even destroyed his shoes, laughing about how his daddy would just buy him a nicer pair.
There will be more exploring the abuse Draco suffered soon 🙂 hope you enjoy!
“Malfoy, you're really thick sometimes. We can stay in here, no-one else is around. We can play games or talk or…”
“So does Ron.” He said with a chuckle, and looked up to see Draco looking at him, suspiciously. “What?” he asked.
"I love you, Draco." He whispered, holding him close and finally settling down to sleep.
"If they find out-"
“It’s open, go in.” he said, his approach audible only from the rustling of his robes. Draco turned to look at the Potions Master, who appeared a few seconds later. Harry pushed the office door open and went in, the other two following. “Give me your wands, both of you.” Snape said. They both looked at him, surprised. No wands? “You can have them back at the end of the detention.” He said impatiently, holding out his hand. Harry sighed and produced his wand, handing it over to Snape. Draco did the same, snapping away when his hand was too close to Harry’s.
“Malfoy? What was this argument about?” he asked. Draco looked at him, struggling to stay composed, and forced himself to straighten up, wearing the Malfoy mask as best he could.
“What was that about?” Hermione asked Harry when he sat back with them. He sighed, shrugging.
"Thank you..." He said softly. Blaise murmured a feeble ‘you're welcome’ and knelt down to gather Draco's clothes - pyjama trousers, a huge thick jumper and thermal socks. "I-I was so cold...I just wanted to feel warm... The water was so hot it hurt, but it felt so good..." Draco was mumbling softly, staring at the floor. Blaise frowned, holding the trousers open for him to step into, which he did, one hand on Blaise's shoulder for balance.
Malfoy lets out a long suffering sigh, and Harry sends one more smile in his direction as he picks up his bag.
“Harry, I called for Madame Pomfrey, she’s on her way. I didn’t know how severe the… the situation…”
“I’m sorry, Parvarti, what?”
Harry nods and flips over, and Malfoy traces his muscles with long fingers, eyes closed, checking Harry's magic. He stills as he gets to the center of Harry's chest, his brow furrowing- he presses down hard, sending a sharp wave of magic into Harry, who winces. Malfoy whispers a soft spell that Harry couldn't hear, and his fingers trace a shape over Harry's chest. He gently pokes and prods at the same spot, whispering quiet incantations, before stopping completely.
“If a Horcrux, a piece of a soul, attached itself to you, it could bond with your soul, especially over 17 years… And then when that Horcrux dies, is ripped away, what would happen to that piece of your soul?” Malfoy’s voice was near frenzied, one hand buried in his white hair, the other waving in the air. He resembled Hermione when she got passionate about something.
Harry steps out of the chaotic room, taking a deep breath. It felt claustrophobic in there. He begins to walk around the castle, checking under debris and rubble to see if there were any survivors or bodies. Over the next hours, he found a few young students who had hidden away in fear, and two cold corpses.
Barely a second had passed before there was a cool hand on Harry's jaw, turning his head. Harry opens his eyes, glancing up at Malfoy, who offers a quick smile as he stood in front of Harry.
Malfoy looks at him dubiously. “You just feel better?” he repeats, his voice mild. Harry can hear the undercurrent of stress there, though. He almost regrets waking his resident healer up.
"Oh!" Harry shakes his head, his cheeks darkening. "That's...fine." He looks away from Malfoy, not wanting to see his smirk. He'd gotten distracted.
A cool hand suddenly touches his face- it feels like water after a hot day in the sun, refreshing and cool and soothing. The thumb touches his lip, gently, almost fearfully. Another hand is at the small of his back, pressing softly and pulling him up into a lap, comforting.
“You ready, then, Malfoy?”
“I’ve picked. Go ahead and go in, get undressed and settled, and I’ll come in once that’s all done.”
He opens his eyes slowly, his vision blurry. His head lolls back against the solid surface below him: a shoulder. An uninvited tear trickles down his cheek and he can feel himself shaking again, cool hands soothing down his back, feeling around for something.
Harry laughs, a loud laugh that seems to surprise Malfoy, whose eyes snap up to Harry’s before a smile pulls at his lips as well.
Malfoy's eyes dart away and color rises in his pale cheeks. Harry shakes his head, taking a few seconds to compose himself. Was he really finding Draco Malfoy attractive? Sweet?? The two boys sit in awkward silence for a beat more until Malfoy returns to normal, making an attempt to be business-like.
Nothing much had changed. Pieces of furniture are covered in white sheets, casting a ghostly air in the room. Paintings hang along the walls, extravagant gold frames holding them. The house was once worthy of a wealthy socialite family, but it had become a shell of its former glory.
He broke eye contact with Potter, shaking his head slightly and glaring at the ground. He was so stupid. That whiskey may have been too strong. He stumbled slightly as he turned to walk away, and his eyes darted back up to Potter’s. He could feel his ears and cheeks warming as their gazes connected once again, and he tore himself away to weave through the crowd. The drink had hit him far faster than he anticipated. Finding Potter attractive? He was surely drunk. Would he still be able to go through with it?
Malfoy murmurs a few quiet words, his hand still buried in Harry’s hair, and Harry can feel his consciousness fading.
Finally, he relaxes. Harry didn't realize how tense the blond boy had been until his shoulders lower, his eyebrows relax, and his fingers stop pressing on Harry's side, though they remain there, cooling the heated skin. A strand of sweat-soaked golden hair falls into the boy's face, and Harry's eyes follow it.
Harry smiles to himself at the thought, but it fades quickly. Keeping his pulse because it could have faded away is not such a pretty thought.
“Do you need to do anything before we go to the manor? I’m not sure how long we’ll be there.”
He jogged through the halls, watching his own name approach the spot Malfoy had disappeared. He finally reached it- just an ordinary section of hallway. His eyebrows drew in, a frown pulling at his lips. He turned around a few times, scanning the walls. There was a tapestry of a horrific looking troll on one side of the wall, and a stretch of plain cobblestone wall opposite it.
Harry cursed quietly, hoisting Malfoy to a full sitting position. He glanced over his body, trying to gauge where the best place to pick him up would be, and determined that a bridal carry would be the least intrusive to his arm.
Harry resolved himself, looking up at Malfoy. He smiles tensely. “Alright, Malfoy.”
He got impassioned like Hermione did. His hands waved in the air, and his expression was both hyper focused and a hundred miles away. He talked quickly, too, expecting his listener to keep up. He was so involved in his topic, it was mesmerizing.
Harry, who had instinctively readied his wand and dropped into a dueling stance, let his hand fall limp to his side. He shifts out of his lowered position, his eyes locked on the shaken looking blond.
Harry’s nose scrunches at the nickname, and he reluctantly closes his book, gently setting it on the bedspread. Malfoy stands from his chair, reaching up and stretching deeply. His shirt lifts slightly, revealing a strip of pale skin and a dark pink marr on it. Harry blinks, his eyes flashing up to Malfoy’s. The boy cracks his neck and drops his arms, covering the scar Harry thinks he saw.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy's eyes open and his pupils dilate as he stares at Harry. "You need to relax, Potter," he bites out, voice tense. "I can't do this if you don't. Relax." He stares at Harry for a beat longer than necessary, eyes closing as he focuses back on his magic. His eyebrows pull together faintly as he starts muttering faster, the incantation seemingly getting much more complicated.
if you enjoyed this chapter, or have thoughts, suggestions, comments... please leave a comment or a kudo!! i would LOVE to know!!
Harry’s lips quirked up slightly at the thought, imaging how Malfoy would react if he said that out loud. The blond had stopped talking, but he was clearly still thinking. His eyebrows were still drawn together.
Malfoy chuckles. It was a real laugh- quiet and suppressed, but real. "Your legs, Harry."
Harry sighed harshly, glancing around the room. It was cold, still, and nearly empty. Can I move him? Or is that not allowed… Is that for head injuries? Harry grimaced, glancing down at the boy, arm strewn across his lap.
And they were taken by the fire.
He tore a sleeve off his robes, using it to bind the wound together, the tie still pressed against it. Gryffindor red and gold had become solely red. Once that was done, he pressed a hand to Malfoy’s cheek.
Malfoy opens his eyes, turning around, and grimaces at the sight of the pants. He picks them up, unfolding them and refolding them correctly. He sets them down, his hands hovering over the neatly creased fabric for a millisecond before he stands up, pushing his hair back and turning to Harry.
Harry’s odd attack seems to have passed, and all is well with him again. But he’s noticing something even more uncomfortable within him- not with his soul, but with his heart.
Of course he is, he’s back in his childhood bedroom. It had to have been tainted.
He pulls his pants back on, picking up his shirt and turning to face Malfoy, whose face was cold as he stared at Harry with those stupid impassive silver eyes, his stupid mouth pressed tight. He had stood up, his arms crossed protectively over himself.
"Harry."
His blood had been pounding in his ears so loudly he could hear nothing else, but Malfoy’s voice slowly became clear as Harry’s body calms. He can hear the same soft incanting that Malfoy had done for him on the battlefield, and the quiet, almost frenzied, muttering, fills his mind as he blacks out.
Harry stands up and takes a few steps away from Malfoy. "Close your eyes," he says, brusquely. Malfoy does, turning away from him, and Harry unbuttons his pants and slips them off. He leaves his briefs on and messily folds the pants, setting them with his shirt.
"So? Do you want me to heal the rest of you?"
“Do you have a preferred bath setting, Potter?”
Hermione’s eyes turned concerned, and she looked at Malfoy. “Don’t worry, Harry,” she offered. Her voice was soft, and she placed a hand on Harry’s arm, careful to not touch Malfoy. “Pomfrey should be here any second. It’ll be okay.”
“Malfoy.”
Harry blinked, tearing his eyes from Malfoy’s retreating form. He stared blankly at the girl next to him, her face screwed up in a scowl.
Harry took a breath, about to say something, though he didn’t know what, when Malfoy’s eyes flashed up to his, filled with revelation.
Malfoy turns back to Harry and blinks as his eyes connect with Harry's burning gaze. Harry blinks too, eyes widening as he realizes what he's doing. He glances away, pressing himself against the headboard and avoiding Malfoy's eyes.
He glances at Malfoy, whose face is at peace for the first time in the days they’ve been together, and resolves not to wake him. It can’t be all that difficult to find a shower in this house, can it?
He does a cursory glance around the room he woke up in- Malfoy’s bedroom, still. And Malfoy… is slumped in his desk chair, which is pulled up next to the bed. His head rests dangerously close to Harry’s thigh, one of his hands gently holding his wrist. Keeping Harry’s pulse through the night?
He pushes the door to his room open, the hinges creaking. He wrinkles his nose slightly at the musty smell- He waves his wand, murmuring a scent charm- "Olfactorium" -And coats the entire room with the smell he had always loved most, the smell revealed to him by the Amortenia they had brewed 6th year. The smell was a mixture of sharp, prickling mint, soap and cinnamon hairgel. He loved the smell.
Harry trails behind Malfoy as he strides confidently through the elaborate mansion. They leave the dining room behind, walking through twisting hallways lined with doors. All are closed, except one. It lies adjacent to the bottom of a staircase, with double doors cracked slightly open. Harry peers into the room as Malfoy begins to ascend the stairs.
He sighed, looking up from the long scroll of parchment half-unrolled in front of him. His quill stopped in the air, midword, and he rubbed his eyes hard with his fists. Looking up at the clock, he realised it was already past midnight- he gasped. He was seventeen! An adult! Which meant...He could do magic now!
"Good. The bruises will be easiest, so I'll start with those." Malfoy leans forward to inspect Harry's forehead, the scent of his sweat and soap enveloping Harry, who sits stock still, staring at the neck of Malfoy's shirt, which is cut low enough to reveal a pale chest, littered with scars. Malfoy's voice breaks the silence of the room. "Lean forward a bit, please," he instructs, his voice professional, but not cold.
He shifted gingerly under Malfoy’s arm, gently lifting it off of his thigh and onto his still chest. He slid a hand under Malfoy’s neck, cupping the base of his head in his careful hand. He cautiously began to lift the boy to a sitting position, but was interrupted by a pained groan.
Harry screwed his face up when Malfoy said it again, ripping his gaze from Malfoy’s and pushing himself off the bed, towards where Malfoy had folded his clothes. He could feel Malfoy's burning eyes on him as he took the short few steps to his clothes, each one feeling like a slog through concrete.
Malfoy clutched onto Harry’s shirt, his eyebrows drawing together slightly. He didn’t make any other moves, simply settled further into Harry’s arms.
Harry’s wand dropped to the floor, clattering on the stone as he rushed to Malfoy’s body. He fell to his knees, his eyes wide and breath coming in panicked bursts. He barely noticed the sharp pain in his knees from how hard he’d fallen- he was too focused on Malfoy. The boy’s body was barely illuminated by Harry’s wand, lying on the ground behind them, but Harry didn’t need much light to see the dark red blood oozing from the blond’s arm.
He glanced quickly up at the wall again, doing a double take. There was...a door there. A door that had definitely not been there before. What the bloody fuck.
The two boys have finally begun their research when an unexpected wrench is thrown into their plans.
Harry grimaces, looking away as he yanks his shirt down fully. “A piece of Voldemort’s soul attached itself to me when his killing curse rebounded. I had to die to kill it. I did.” He runs a hand through his tangled curls, turning slightly away from Malfoy. He could still feel his eyes. It was unnerving.
They had been for a while, though Malfoy hadn’t noticed.
“Oh.” Harry’s voice is unsure. “I’m sor-”
His head swings left and right, sizing up the two directions he can go. He decides to venture to the right, first. The hallway had 3 doors, besides Malfoy’s, and ended in a large picture window. He starts with the door immediately next to Malfoy’s room, but all that reveals is a linen closet. One touch of the fabrics shows their quality. Harry draws his hand back from the sheets, shutting the door quite quickly and moving on.
Harry squints at the blond, who stood before him as if that was a perfectly normal question.
It stepped lightly around Malfoy’s body, and he looked at it gratefully. “I need you to send a message to Hermione, please. Tell her someone is in grave danger and she needs to bring Madame Pomfrey here immediately. Hurry, please!” The stag reared its head, galloping through the wall of the room, presumably towards the hall where the ball was being held.
He reached the tray, which held amicably still as he plucked one of the delicate glasses from its surface. He nodded slightly at it before glancing down at the liquid he held. It was deep orange, and he could smell that it was pumpkin juice, and unspiked pumpkin juice, at that. Unfortunate. Alcohol was what he needed.
He opens it, planning to lean inside, glance around, and shut it again. He’s halfway through the process, barely taking anything in, when he realizes what he’s looking at. A huge tub sits in the center of the room, as deep as a shallow pool.
“I wish I were. Unfortunately, since your last attack came on so suddenly and with no prerequisite, I need to be able to watch you.”
Harry nods agreeably, standing up. He isn’t entirely sure what “checking him” will consist of, but watching Malfoy ready himself gives him a hint. The man pushes the chair back, standing up so he’s level with Harry. He summons his wand with a quiet word, possibly having dropped it in the night.
"Malfoy." There's no loathing in the rough voice. "What are you doing? Everything's okay now. The war's over."
Harry’s breath sticks in his throat as the fire engulfs him. Malfoy had dropped his hand. The familiar feeling of his stomach twisting as he went through the Floo is stronger than usual, and he instinctively reaches out, stiff fingers closing around Malfoy’s forearm. He doesn’t get a look at Malfoy’s expression before the two drop into the large, ornate fireplace of the hall of Malfoy Manor.
Malfoy tilts his head. "I didn't get a look at your back or anything below the belt. Those are...rather important."
The man raised one eyebrow (completely unvisable through the hoops peirced completely around it) and smiles darkly. "So prepared. I'm impressed, Chosen One." Harry shrugs. "I guess we'll get right on it, then." The man smirks, pulling out his wand. "Choose your liprings." He accios the rack of beginners earrings and shows Harry them
Harry blinks stupidly as Malfoy glances at him. “Er… What?”
Malfoy gently presses his finger against the bruise and Harry flinches. "Shh," he murmurs to the younger boy. "Hold on." He cups Harry's jaw as he presses against the bruise, lifting his chin and murmuring a few soft words. He waves his hand over the bruise before placing his fingers against it again, letting his magic flow into Harry and heal him. When he feels the skin fully mend, his eyes open and he gives that ghost smile to Harry again.
Harry glances around, and his breath catches yet again. This was where he had been. This is where they had been. When Malfoy…
Malfoy’s eyes darken slightly, and he tilts his head to the side. He presses his lips together in a way that makes it look like he’s stifling a smile, and his teasing tone confirms that. “Sure, Potter. But I need to be in there, too.”
"What's that?"
The room has cream colored walls, with a matching cream covered rug covering most of the floor. The furniture is all arranged around a large bed, which is covered in a plush looking navy comforter and giant pillows. Bookshelves are pushed against every wall, all full of any text you could imagine. There are posters on the wall, photos too. And right by the door is a large desk, nothing on its surface but a lone quill and dust.
“Potter.”
“Why are you smiling so much, Potter? Is the bath that good?”
Harry sits up straight, ready to start.
Harry had fallen asleep to the screechy rocking of the bus as it jolted back and forth, narrowly avoiding sidewalks, pedestrians, and other vehicles on the Muggle road. He had given 5 shiny galleons to the driver, who tried to give them back but he insisted. He was only going to the Leaky Cauldron (a fare of some 15 sickles) but he was tired and pumped up on adrenaline.
Malfoy places his hand on top of hers for a moment, and she stills. Her eyes are locked on him, wide and glassy. She sniffs once more, quietly, then squeezes her eyes shut, curling a hand into Malfoy’s shirt. He pulls out his wand, beginning his incantations. Harry shakes himself out of his reverie, turning around to walk out of the Great Hall. He spares a glance back at Malfoy and the little girl, a sense of pride gently warming him.
Harry blinks, his arms loosening from their tightly crossed position. He hadn’t realized he’d drawn in so much. He huffs out a small laugh. “Shut up. I didn’t want to disturb your things.”
Moderately graphic depictions of suicide attempt! No actual description of the attempt, but the method (slicing open arm) is described in order to show Harry helping. I don’t personally think it’s super gory, but it may be for you!! Please don’t continue if this will be triggering or harmful to your mental health. Enjoy the chapter!
Harry studies Malfoy as he looks to the side, rummaging through a bag. His skin is pallid, his lower lip bloody. He has a small cut under his eye, bruises on his high cheekbones, dark marks around his throat. He looks terrible. Harry tilts his head, regarding the bully he'd known most of his life. It felt like he didn't know him at all anymore. His gaze travels farther down Malfoy, examining his lithe frame. He'd gotten rather fit.
“Yes, you impatient bastard. Come with me.”
Harry's forehead presses against another's- it has the same tingling coolness as the hand.
He began making his way to the other side of the room, searching for a head of white-blonde hair, or a flash of rich looking, black robes. Bodies pressed in on him, chattering loudly and attempting to get his attention. He muttered acknowledgments, mostly ignoring them as he pushed past.
"You'll pull through, Chosen One," sighs the person. "Tergeo."
Harry pushes through it all, whispering apologies as he presses past all the people he knew. His beacon is the bright red hair he can see bowed over a body in the middle of the room.
“Oh, really?” Malfoy says, his voice still teasing.
He receives an amused smile from Malfoy. “Are we just going to stand here?”
Harry shook his head, glancing back over where Malfoy had been. Where had he gone in such a hurry?
Malfoy sets a few jars next to Harry's head, and opens one, spreading the gel from inside of it generously over Harry's back. It smells distinctly of mint and cools his skin so quickly it feels almost sharp.
“Okay, okay. Elevate it. Apply pressure,” Harry muttered to himself.
“Hungry, Potter?”
He opened his eyes, lifting his hands. They dripped with the fresh blood, and the wound still gaped wide, blood seeping from it. White fat was visible underneath the red liquid, and Harry felt bile rising in his throat as he looked at it. He grimaced, staring down at Malfoy’s chest instead- still rising and falling, though barely. If magic couldn’t help, he could at least use the first aid he’d learned.
Harry’s eyebrows drew together and he yanked his hand away from Malfoy’s face, forcing the thoughts from his mind. He glanced back down at the boy, at the sticky red handprint on his face, and blanched.
“Will your parents even let you back into the Manor?”
He gently sets the bag on the floor just inside the door, closing it again, and Harry lets out a breath. He shucks his pants off as quickly as possible, along with his underwear, and slides into the tub, which is almost filled. Magical speed, he thinks with a smile.
Malfoy's eyes open and he looks down at Harry, fingers hesitantly lifting from his chest.
The voice is just as smooth and cool as everything about the person holding him, words murmured softly, the voice sounding preoccupied. Their breath smells of mint and iron; blood and ice.
Harry glances around the room again, noting the lack of any doors other than the main one. No ensuite for the Slytherin prince? Seems unlikely… But still, he steps quietly past Malfoy, to the door to the hallway. He turns the knob gingerly, squeezing out of the room while making as little noise as possible.
Harry adjusts himself, pillowing his cheek on his folded arms, which rest on the lip of the tub. He watches Malfoy’s face, his expressions. The way he twirls his wand in his fingers mindlessly.
“We’ll have to do research.” Malfoy’s voice interrupts Harry’s reverie.
Harry took a breath. His wish had been granted, so he needed to take advantage of it. He took a few steps forward, just a breath away from whatever Malfoy was plotting this time around. He reached out, his hand shaking just slightly, but stopped before he touched the door. The Marauders Map, which had been clenched in his slightly sweaty hand, needed to go away. He tucked it back into his robe, pulling out his wand as a second thought.
A groan sounded from farther into the room, and he stepped towards it. His wand illuminated a body on the ground. Malfoy’s body.
His lips curl into an impish smirk before he speaks again.
Now that things were less desperate, he scrabbled on the floor, grasping for his wand. Barely there light was still coming from its tip, which he brightened with a murmured word as he grasped his wand. “Scourgify,” he said softly, pointing the glowing wand at Malfoy’s cheek. The blood was wiped off his face, leaving him clean, if still a bit sweaty.
Malfoy looks up, eyes flashing light grey. His eyebrows raise a fraction, lips parted. He seems...surprised Harry would allow him to help. A shadow of a smile passes over Malfoy's face, but it's gone before Harry can catch more than a glance.
“Please… please…!” Draco begged when Harry finally released him, tears rolling down his cheeks, his breathing sounded almost panicked. His weak hands found Harry’s shoulders, fingers winding into the fabric of the shirt and pulling as hard as he could, only serving to wrinkle it. Harry stared down at him, looking into his eyes that were full of lust and fear, begging him to help. He leaned down and kissed at the wet tracks on his pale cheeks, pushing his hands under Draco’s back to hold him closer.
“I…I’m sorry..! Oh my God- I never meant to…I didn’t mean to-” he stopped, hearing faint but approaching footsteps. He didn’t want anyone to know he’d hurt Malfoy this badly, it was practically unprovoked, and the punishment definitely didn’t fit the crime.
Blaise came up beside him, one hand on his back. Draco jumped away from him, whipping around and looking at him with wide eyes. He relaxed when he saw it was Blaise and immediately broke down, his crying voice echoing in the vast Entrance Hall. Blaise didn't go any closer to him, staying a good foot from him as Draco backed away,  that old look of lost terror on his face.
“And, um... can a curse last for a person’s whole life?” he asked. Her frown deepened as she put her quill down and marked her page carefully, closing the book before folding her hands on top of its leather cover.
“Draco does Occlumency…” Pansy corrected him, but Draco looked horror-struck.
Draco and his friends seemed to be having a nice time together, Blaise apparently telling a funny story that made the others laugh. Harry, and his Monster, watched Draco like a hawk, noticing every expression, every movement. He seemed to be acting quite as usual, laughing with the others and adding to the conversation. He was sitting between Pansy and Goyle, all of them drinking some kind of dark blue cocktail from the pitcher in the middle of the table. They were all dressed in their recreation clothes, like everyone else, Draco wearing a dark green jumper and black coat, trousers and shoes.
“Do what?” Blaise asked, taking a very slow step closer and hoping Draco was too self absorbed at this current moment to notice.
"Calidumus..." He said, the same spell he'd used then, now casting it on the towel Draco was wrapped in. Instantly, Draco let out a soft sigh, pulling the towel further around himself like a blanket.
“What’s going on? Why does he need his stuff?” Ron asked, looking between the three of them. Dumbledore gestured Harry up the stairs, and he obeyed, the Headmaster following him. Ron and Hermione both looked at McGonagall, their expressions incredulous. She looked tired, sighing.
“Draco…he hurt you today…? In your detention?” Blaise asked, and they both looked at him. He nodded, looking down, pushing up his right sleeve to show the newly forming bruises around his fragile-looking wrist. The black boy growled, his expression one of seething rage, and he stood up. “We’re taking you to Pomfrey, come on.” He said decisively. Draco looked up at him, eye wide with fear as he tried to shake his head.
“Professor McGonagall, I would like you to accompany Mr Zabini to the Hospital Wing. I will take Mr Potter to visit Professor Snape.” He said decisively. McGonagall nodded, and gestured Blaise out of the door before her, her hand resting gently on his shoulder. He obeyed, and they walked to the Hospital Wing in silence, Blaise barely able to keep up with the Scottish woman’s hasty strides, like she was forcing herself not to run.
“Well...There are worse lists to be on, I'm sure…” he said, strangely overwhelmed by this admission. Potter planned to fight for him, and planned to win. What would his life be like if the Dark Lord no longer existed? True, his father would be in Azkaban, their family name and fortune all but gone, the Manor sold or abandoned. He and his mother could survive though. She had her Black family money, what little remained, and he could get a job… Potions, that's what he wanted to do. Work for the Ministry, or even open his own shop - an Apothecary, of sorts.
Difficult conversations are had, thoughts are explained, a chilling discovery is made.
“That’s not good enough! You must still be ill if you have this little appetite, Draco, please.” She sounded passionate, begging her friend. Draco himself didn’t say a word, and finally Harry heard them saying goodbye and they’d see him later. A moment more passed and Draco Malfoy came round the corner, but stopped dead when he saw Harry waiting there. His eyes were wide and he looked like he was considering running off in the opposite direction, only to jump suddenly when Snape’s drawling voice echoed behind him.
There was an audible intake of breath around the library, followed very quickly by a buzz of whispers. Like a field of crickets, Draco thought with a roll of his eyes. Harry was still grinning up at him, eyes sparkling with pride and… something. Draco didn't know, so he nodded once and returned to his friends, cheeks on fire. Pansy gave him a tiny round of applause and Blaise nudged his foot under the table, both grinning. Draco ignored them staunchly, concentrating very hard on his Arithmancy exercise. He felt hot and somehow weightless for the rest of the day, just thinking about Harry's eyes and smile trained solely on him.
Blaise chased Draco out into the corridor and up the stairs to the Entrance Hall. It was almost 8pm so the place was deserted, the doors to the Great Hall and out into the grounds both sealed shut. Draco stopped, seeming to lose his direction with nowhere to go, and produced his wand.
Decisions made, people gather, panic attacks
"We were wondering, Potter… and you two, if you'd like to join us for a walk before dinner, if the weather stays nice. It will still be cold but..." Frankly, he would be glad for a chilly walk right about now, his cheeks feeling ridiculously hot and red. At least outside there would be a less embarrassing reason for pinkness than just Harry's smile.
times more bloody embarrassing." He muttered, sitting on the sofa. Harry couldn't help but grin at that, sitting beside him and patting his knee, rewarded with a pink flush over the sharp cheekbones and the knobly bridge of his nose. He was ever so slightly freckled from the recent sunny weather, Harry was pleased to notice.
"You better be good to him, Potter." Blaise warned, his jaw set. He looked like he wanted to say something else, probably something threatening, but Pansy said they needed to go. She gave Draco a gentle hug too, then led the other three out.
“Gryffindor tower, of course.” He said warmly. “Your friends are very worried, and I think sleeping in your own bed again would be good for you. Routine, Harry...” He said sagely, though Harry very much doubted ‘routine' would help at all.
“Pansy probably knows what to get your mother more than I do…” Draco was saying, clearly a bit put out at being forced back into the cold, pulling on his gloves.
“Snape just gave me and Malfoy detention.” He muttered, measuring spoonfuls of doxy eggs into the mortar and pestle.
They settled down in bed to watch a funny film about male models that Blaise loves, and Draco spent much of it watching his boyfriend rather than the movie. His nose wrinkled when he laughed, flashing his white teeth, dark eyes shining and full of mirth. Draco kissed his cheek and wrapped his arms around him, squeezing. Blaise's attention was immediately on him, running a warm hand over his forearm and elbow.
, he protected him, fighting through the visceral reaction in order to stop his true abuser from getting what he wanted. He knew, deep down, that Harry had never hurt him, not really. It was the man he was serving who had truly destroyed him, and had continued to do so in his own childhood home, this time using Death Eaters and Fenrir Greyback as his puppets of torture. The Dark Lord had never touched him directly, preferring to watch. Luckily, none of that was in the newspapers.
"Morning." Harry said, smiling. Draco nodded in greeting, allowing a small smile, and handed
Harry very gently moved them both to lie down against the pillows, not wishing to wake Draco up, and couldn’t compel himself to sit up again and leave. Instead, he kicked off his own shoes, placed his glasses on the bedside table, pulled the quilt over the both of them, and closed his eyes.
“H-Harry…please, let me go…” he begged softly, his voice shaking. He’d never heard Draco say his first name on its own before, only his full or last name in that sneering, mocking voice he was so fond of.
“That’s… Do you like it? Ever?” he asked. Draco looked at him, blushing again, and curled into a tighter ball, looking down again.
He didn’t see Draco Malfoy for two days after that, though this wasn’t unusual for the weekend. Then, when he finally reappeared at the breakfast table on Monday morning, he looked remarkably like a doll; soulless, his eyes completely void of emotion. He was speaking to his friends, his mouth smiling when theirs did, and nodding dutifully when Pansy or Blaise spoke to him, but he hardly seemed to be listening. Harry watched him through the small pace between Ron and Neville, unable to take his eyes from his pale, porcelain face and eyes made of glass. Draco never looked back at him, even if he did feel Harry’s gaze, he never acknowledged it.
“Congratulations.” Harry said, smiling and letting it be real. “I'm still at Grimmauld Place.” he said, because he wasn't sure what else to say. "So… I heard you were publishing something, um… Potions related?" He asked Draco, feeling awkward again. Draco brightened immediately and nodded, Blaise grinning proudly at the Malfoy.
Harry closed his eyes, turned his head away as Draco, he knew, was violated, feeling the agony in his own body. He wanted to reach out and hold Draco's hand, knowing this must be 100 times worse for him, but he didn't. Hermione made herself watch, sick to her stomach and hating herself for ever doubting Draco deserved more punishment. No-one deserved this, no matter what they'd done.
The next day, Blaise woke up the most comfortable he'd felt since he didn't even know when. He was warm and surrounded by softness. He stretched himself, his toes finding the cool parts of the sheet, then became aware of the person lying beside him. He cracked his eyes open blearily, finding the pale, delicate features of Draco before him. It took him a moment to recall the events of the previous night, looking over the peaceful expression on Draco's always so sombre face, then smiled. He'd stayed the whole rest of the night, presumably sleeping through. Carefully, so as not to wake his sleeping friend, Blaise reached for his watch, vaguely reminded of the previous night, and found the hour to be almost 8am. It was Sunday, so they could sleep in if they wanted to, and Blaise couldn't think of anything better than going back to sleep, pulling Draco's warm waist closer as he closed his eyes again.
“Calm down, Malfoy. Do you remember anything?” he asked steadily, rubbing his eyes of sleep. “You
"He's not exhibiting any symptoms of being turned, even a little bit. His appetite is still bad, no raw meat cravings, and he's not showing any aggression or other signs." Hermione said, shaking her head. She had checked several moon charts, oddly plentiful around the house, and they agreed the moon wouldn't be full for another week. "He could be like Bill, with even milder symptoms." Ron's expression shifted a little. "Or… the Bite hasn't affected him. I don't know how that's possible but maybe… maybe Wolfsbane, like Lupin? If so, he will need more." Ron sighed dramatically, pulling at his own damp hair.
"Draco, please, listen to me. If you do this, you won't just get rid of the bad memories; you'll lose all the good ones too!” He didn't know enough about Obliviate to know if this was true but he couldn't risk Draco casting such a severe spell on himself. They'd all heard about what happened to that Lockhart fellow in second year, he couldn't stand the thought of the proud, intelligent Draco reduced to a bedridden moron in St Mungo's...
“We have to do something.” he said earnestly, holding on tightly. Draco sighed, glancing around before speaking in hardly more than a whisper.
“When...?”
“Yep! Have fun skiing.” He said, knowing she wasn’t exactly looking forward to it. She rolled her eyes with a smile and hugged him.
“Draco-” he gasped, fighting the Monster back from his own mind. Draco’s head turned, trying to look at him, confused and frightened by Harry’s changing demeanour. “I’m sorry, Draco-” he cut himself off, his consciousness being pushed back into the shadows as the Monster grew angry with its host. The Monster pressed Harry’s hips into Draco’s arse, trapping him against the desk, to reassert its dominance over them both.
“He’s been raped.” Blaise said, having seen it too. Pomfrey’s eyes went big as saucers, utter horror on her face.
“We believe so.” Snape said stiffly. Harry looked at him, seeing no small measure of anger in his eyes. “If the Dark Lord is using you for this, the only thing we can do is prioritise your Occlumency training. Draco has become rather talented at it.” He said, but the gravity of his tone made Harry think that perhaps this was not always the case and it had caused no small amount of harm. Not to mention Draco’s already uncanny skill at repressing everything in his life until he resembles stone. Harry had noticed it when he wasn’t filled with his Monster – Voldemort, which felt even worse to admit –‘s insatiable need to terribly hurt the Malfoy. Draco’s unnatural cool after such an attack, his total lack of emotion even as soon as the next day, like he was nothing more than an empty doll.
"Muffled Muffin Bites." Ron shot back.
was a memory charm that implanted a fake memory into the victim's mind, but they'd found out that the real memory remained, suppressed but there. It was an extremely advanced spell, far beyond the capabilities of a sixth year; it was the kind of thing only Aurors and senior Ministry officials learn.
His friends knew what to do, Blaise pouring a glass of cold water and dunking a handkerchief in it, while Pansy made sure Draco's robes would cover up any obvious sign of his condition. They laughed it off, pretending the two were just in the throes of passion, Ron and Hermione confusedly playing along.
The phrase made Draco's whole body shudder, his hands tightening on the fabric already clenched in them.
"It's ok..." was all he could say, all that came to mind in the chaotic whirlpool in his head. Draco let out a soft breath, which could have been a sigh of irritation just as easily as a small release of his burden, of relief. Blaise grabbed Draco's hand with a smile, saying they needed to get back to bed, and they left the bathroom.
“Yeah, yeah, she can, you can trust her with anything.” he said, trying very hard not to make a ‘that's why her hair is so big, it's full of secrets’ joke, knowing full well Draco would have absolutely no idea what he was talking about. Draco nodded, and sighed.
Blaise had decided to eat with Draco in the Hospital Wing, unable to stomach the glances and mutterings and the chicken in white wine sauce the elves had served for the Sunday meal, despite it being pretty delicious. Madam Pomfrey had set them up with a little table over Draco’s bed to accommodate his guest, and they ate in relative comfort and silence.
"I saw them walking back from the Quidditch friendly together. They were
“Sleeping around?” Draco asked, impatient with Potter’s stuttering. The blond sighed, resting his head back against the headboard, looking up at the bed’s canopy. “Last year.”
"We live here." He said.
The Monster purred at the distress in Malfoy’s face. It made Harry rock his hips, hand gripping the soft blond hair tighter so he couldn’t escape as the cock slid, in and out, between his lips. It was a wonderful sight, but not enough for Harry, or his Monster. The heat and wetness around him had sparked a need he’d only ever sated himself. Now he needed much, much more, and he knew his Monster did as well.
“Very well. Go, now.” he muttered, not looking up as he sat down at his desk. Harry looked at Draco, who drew himself up to walk almost confidently towards the door. Harry glanced back at Snape, relieved to see he hadn’t noticed anything different about his desk, and followed Draco out of the office, though stayed a fair distance away from him. Draco turned the corner to head for the Slytherin Common Room and dormitories, his hand on the stone wall as he slowed down, dropping his fake strength. Harry knew Draco would hate it if he tried to help, but he would feel even worse if someone saw him while he looked this weak.
Stormcloud eyes stared at him, apparently disarmed by this question. “Us! Me...Pansy? Crabbe and Goyle? Aren't we your friends? Do you want to forget us?” he asked, challengingly. He hoped there was enough of the Malfoy arrogance left in Draco's stricken mind to relish the opportunity to argue with him. “We've been sleeping in the same bed for weeks and it's been helping, you said it helps...doesn't that mean something to you?”
“Coriumtersus.” the Monster said, moving Harry’s wand over Draco, his skin instantly becoming dry and clean, releasing the ropes around his thin wrists as well. “Internumtersus.” Draco’s breath hitched, his unfocussed eyes widening slightly, twitching and shivering at the feeling as his insides followed suit. The Monster then cast another spell, some kind of revitalising charm, and Draco seemed to regain his senses, and some of his strength. He pulled away from Harry and stood up slowly, leaning fully against the wall as he pulled up his trousers. He was looking at the floor where he’d been lying previously, where his incorporeal rapist still knelt.
"No talking, please."
Greyback said huskily, a hint of amusement in his voice, and Harry heard a sharp intake of breath beside him. Memory-Draco's head finally lifted towards him, apparently looking at him now, and he closed his book slowly.
“Well, I’m not leaving you alone like this.” Harry said decisively, no one deserved to be left alone like this, abused and discarded. He saw the darkest bruises were on his bony hips, and more were forming on his delicate wrists, the size of men’s hands.
He looked at Draco, who looked a little dazed, and pulled him by his robes away from the wall and marched him down the corridor. A moment later, regaining his senses, Draco struggled against his grip.
“Will you really go back to asking those 7th years? They treat you so badly...” he said softly. Draco glared at him then, looking very Malfoy for a moment.
“Shut up. I’m so fucking sick of you.” Harry growled. Still holding Draco against the wall, he looked around. The corridor was empty, everyone was at dinner in the Great Hall, but someone might be around. He thought for a moment, and remembered the boys’ bathroom around the corner. He didn’t know why but he wanted to be completely alone with Malfoy…
“I’ve got your clothes…” Harry said. There was a pause, followed by an audible sniffle, and the door opened. Draco’s pale, exhausted face appeared, and Harry handed him the bundle of garments before the Malfoy closed it again without another word. Harry closed his eyes, resting his forehead against the wood of the door, tears rolling down his own cheeks.
which gave Harry a lump in his throat he had to suppress by taking a sip of tea.
Greyback gave a growl at his insolence and Harry's chest tightened, his limbs twitching in a defensive instinct. He wondered how Greyback could possibly be unable to hear his pounding heart, he must have heard it down the corridor. Memory-Draco half flinched, but seemed to stop himself before he could fully cower.
The next morning, Harry woke up to soft, white light from the windows, through which he could see big fat snowflakes falling. Draco was fast asleep beside him, snuggled up close to him under the blankets. They were both still naked, Harry’s arms wrapped around the Malfoy’s narrow waist. He could feel the steady breaths on his chest as Draco slept, his fingers curled idly between them, and was content to doze for a bit longer.
Again, please be nice to each other in the comments, and thank you to everyone who's been so supportive, you've been brilliant and I appreciate you!

“You ok, Draco?” Blaise asked, interrupting Pansy’s verbal attack on them as soon as they appeared in the Common Room. The Malfoy was very pale and he was visibly shivering, wrapped up in Crabbe’s cloak as well as his own coat.
“Only for a moment, he’s asleep.” She said softly, holding the curtain open for them. They went through, and Pansy could barely contain a sob when she saw him. She went over to him, stroking his soft white gold hair off his forehead and holding his hand.
Malfoy’s face relaxes slightly, and Harry can see tension leaving him. A returning smile flashes across his face, quickly settling back into a neutral expression. But his eyes… they were soft. Grateful.
Malfoy’s face is focused in a way Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen before. His silver eyes are rapt, slightly narrowed at whatever he sees. His lips curve around the incantations in a way that’s almost beautiful, along with the way his long fingers grip his wand.
The silence stretches between them, and Harry drops his head back onto the floor of the bathroom, staring at the ceiling. There’s an intricate mural painted on it- or maybe it’s a spell. Either way, it’s beautiful. The depiction of soft clouds and sparkling stars in a dark night sky almost make him dizzy.
Harry blinks, looking blankly at Malfoy’s face. Shouldn’t they keep working? His thoughts are interrupted as his stomach lets out a low rumble, and he glances guiltily at it before looking back at Malfoy. The blonde smirks.
An almost mocking laugh spouts from the tall, lean boy as he approaches the bed. "Another war will happen. The wizarding world depends on their savior to get them through it. I'm the best Healer in training at Hogwarts. I've been helping everyone, and you need it more than most."
Harry's eyes flew open and he tensed, his gaze locked onto the floor of the room. Malfoy's words were echoing around in his head.
The tall blonde rolled his eyes. “Yes. You will be getting clothes more suited for the Manor when we get there.” His face spreads in a cheeky smirk. “You have to be on my level.”
Malfoy shakes his head slightly, closing his eyes. When he reopens them, the strange expression is gone, replaced with a determined look.
