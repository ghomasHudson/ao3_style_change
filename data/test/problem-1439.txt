Ron banged his cup down loudly on the bedside table, and the resulting noise caused him to wince.  "So were you planning on telling me you fancied Malfoy anytime soon?  Or were you all having too much fun keeping me in the dark?"
the brain to match."  She shut the catalogue firmly and then shuffled into a seating position with her legs crossed.  "It's our last year at school, Draco.  We should be making the most of it, having some fun, not swotting so hard that you'll end up with specs like Potter."
He yawned, stretched, and then winced at the throbbing this movement set off.  Then he laid still and silent, listening for any indication Malfoy's presence in the room.  Harry was half tempted to just pull back the bed curtains and check, but his head had other ideas, and there was always a chance one of Malfoy's roommates might be around, and Harry was
?" Ron's strident cry could doubtless be heard in all four corners of the Hall and had already garnered them a fair few curious looks.  Thankfully it was early in the morning and only a small number of fellow students were present, but Harry could tell from the excited gleams in a few pairs of eyes – most notably Seamus and Pansy Parkinson – that this particular juicy tit bit would not go unspread for long.
"Blaise was right," Draco continues.  "It would have been much more fun if I'd have taken you with me."
"He wasn't at first," Draco admitted with a shrug.  "But Father has become surprisingly pragmatic of late."
"We should probably discuss how this is going to work while you're still in a fit state to make decisions."
"Okay," Harry replied, setting his shopping bags down on the worktop.  "It might be a tight squeeze round the table, but the more the merrier, right?  There'll still be plenty of food to go round - I always cater for large numbers when Ron's invited."
"Nothing to tell?"  Hermione repeated incredulously.  "Harry, you've been pining over Draco for the last two years, and—"
Hannah Abbott was as round-faced and smiley as she’d ever been at Hogwarts, and Harry felt a momentary relief that not everyone had changed drastically over the last four years.  Although, he was looking at her over a bar now, rather than a classroom.
"It's like living with a man," Pansy groused, as if on cue.  "Not you, darling, of course," she added hurriedly upon spotting Draco's expression.  "A really uncouth, slovenly man."
Words that would have once produced a very different reaction now set Harry's stomach twisting in a not-unpleasant way.  "Draco."  Even after several years those syllables still feel strange on his tongue.  "I didn't realise you were due in today."
“Coward,” he accused.  He leant in and kissed her on the cheek.  “I don’t blame you really.  I’ll see you on Christmas Day.”
Harry was halfway through his eggs and bacon by the time Hermione left – hot-footing it out of the Great Hall on some urgent Head Girl errand or other.
, like him. Like you and Blaise, or Ron and Pansy. I know this didn't start out for the right reasons, but there's something there now and I want to see where it'll go."
"I'm best friends with Hermione, Malfoy."  Draco was sure that if Potter had been able to focus properly, he would have rolled his eyes here.  "She doesn't let us eat dinner unless we can prove we learnt three new words that day."
Draco chewed a mouthful of toast slowly, enjoying Pansy's obvious irritation at his continued silence.  He didn't need to look at the paper to know what it said – he'd already had several owls on the subject that morning.
“I heard that, Weasley.”  A blond head appeared around the side of a nearby dressing room curtain.  “I can still put you in lace, you know?”
Draco didn't dignify the comment with a response.  He strode to the door and shut it firmly behind him – the slam didn't quite mask Blaise's yelp as the Stinging Hex hit its mark.
Narcissa's face brightened instantly – almost a glint of triumph in her eyes.  Draco was moved to wonder if she actually thought him ignorant of her machinations.  If so, either advancing years were taking their toll on his mother's sharpness, or he was getting really good at masking his emotions.
Pansy now lay on her front, feet kicked up behind her, as she tracked Draco's progress around the room through narrowed eyes.  "What
Malfoy wasn’t wrong, but for some reason it bothered Harry. He didn’t want to admit Malfoy was right, because that might cause hell to freeze over, but he couldn’t very well deny it. So he stared at his pint as if in search of the answer.
that he likes you, only you're both to stupid or oblivious, or just too damn stubborn to do anything about it."  He pauses here and turns to smile at Hannah before continuing.  "And because I know what it's like to love someone and to be scared of rejection.  But I also know how wonderful it can be if you just take the risk."
Draco stilled suddenly and Harry couldn't help but wonder if this wasn't all some horrible joke. He pulled back and waited.  It seemed like it took forever, and Harry chewed nervously at his bottom lip as he waited.
A soft chuckle caught his ear.  Rolling over carefully, so as not to upset the throbbing in his skull, Harry cracked one eye open slightly.  Wincing against the light, he just made out the grinning form of Draco at his bedside.  "Bright," he muttered, pressing one hand over his eyes.
Harry felt his stomach lurch for a moment before he remembered reading about Daphne Greengrass's engagement in the
They reached the door to the Potions classroom and were just about to enter when Harry felt a hand on his arm.
"Merlin, Draco!  Give a bloke a heart attack, why don't you?"  Blaise raised his hand to his mouth and promptly lapped up his spillage; Harry tried his hardest not to look at or appreciate the action.
Harry resisted the urge to confess that Draco’s biting sarcasm was one of the things he loved most about him.  All he said was, “that’s nice,” as noncommittally as possible.
For this, Harry was content to blame Luna.  And Neville a little bit. But blaming Neville was rather like kicking a puppy, and Harry had the feeling that Luna was finding recent events entirely too amusing, so he was more than comfortable laying the entire blame at her feet.
Malfoy smirked just a little and Harry couldn’t stop the colour flooding his cheeks.  Ron, thankfully oblivious, saved him.
"Yes, well, that's as maybe," Draco replied evenly.  "But we have more important things to worry about right now.  Why don't you show Potter in and I'll see if I can't salvage something out of this day."
That was why he, instead of Ron, was now the regular visitor to Malfoy's office with requests for their department. And despite initial concerns from his colleagues, they had proved groundless. Harry remembered the look of surprise on Robards' face when he had returned with that last surveillance warrant authorised in record time with just a hint of smug satisfaction.
George crossed the room at gave Harry a pat on the shoulder.  "He's all settled in, so I'm going to head off now.  If I'm late for lunch, Mum'll..."
Draco carefully extricated his hand from her grasp.  “I appreciate the sentiment,” he said softly, then the shutters came down, and the closed expression that the outside world got to see was firmly in place.  “But we are not having this conversation,
The money's dropped into his outstretched hand with a beaming smile.   "Absolutely.  She's very disappointed to miss you.  But they're working her very hard at St Mungo's."  Mrs Morrison leans forward and continues in a confidential manner.  "Too hard, if you ask me.  She's only a trainee and they have her there all hours."  She pauses then and gives a small shake of her head.  "But what do I know about it?  I'm just a silly old woman."
Draco pulled back breathlessly, his eyes almost gleaming in the darkness of the hall.  "Bedroom," he gasped, and that was all he had time to say before Harry pulled him back in.
The flames burned a brighter shade of green, spitting sparks into the room – not for the first time, Harry made a mental note to get his Floo professionally cleaned.  Then Draco emerged, just as Harry had known he would, clutching several carrier bags.
Harry nodded and hoped his expression showed just how much he cared. He wanted nothing more than to take Draco in his arms and keep him there.
He stepped into the first available lift and headed up to the fourth floor.  When the doors opened and he strode out, Draco spotted a familiar figure dressed in lime green robes.  He'd always rather liked Padma Patil, apart from that one weak moment of Weasley-dating in fourth year.
There was another advantage to spending time with George, Harry found as time went by:  When they ate together, people were less inclined to approach him, to bother him for pictures and autographs or just to tell him about their single female relatives that he really ought to meet.  Over the last year George had earned a reputation for being somewhat volatile, and there was nothing like the ever-present aura of grief around him to keep people away.  There was the odd brave soul who tried, but they were unceremoniously turned away without Harry having to utter a syllable.
Draco's grip on Harry's shoulders tightened, one hand tugging slightly at the hairs on Harry's nape.  "I didn't think..."
They all looked a little too calm, too accepting, and in a fit of irrational pique, Harry found himself irritated by the
Draco gave a wry grin.  "Believe it or not, I have Weasley and Pansy to thank for that.  Although, I'm still not over wanting to Hex the pair of them stupid for the risk they took on my behalf."
"He died." Draco said the words softly, as quietly as he could.  He was conscious of Harry's presence in the next room, and though it was a subject they'd touched on a couple of times, Draco knew it was something that Harry would prefer to forget.
Pansy reappeared wearing her own clothes again.  She saw the look of surprise on Draco's face and explained, "I'm getting this one.  No point trying on the others; I'll just end up buying more than I need."  She picked all the other outfits up before turning back to him with a sympathetic expression on her face.  "Harry's not stupid, Draco.  He'll see through Blaise in a heartbeat."
Potter allowed a tiny smile to cross his face briefly, but then it faded into more hardened lines.  "You were just telling me how I didn't need to be angry with you anymore."  And Potter's tone left Draco in no doubt as to how he felt about
"I'm sick and tired of everyone telling me I should give you a chance, that the war's over and you've changed, making me out to be the bad one."
“You’re…Sweet Merlin!  I don’t believe it.”  Harry sank back on the sofa looking somewhat gob-smacked.
"I hope that's meant to be a joke, for your sake, Potter."  Draco folded his arms across his chest and mock-glared at Harry.
“You’re gay?”  Harry didn’t mean to blurt that out but he was surprised.  He’d always thought that Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were a thing.
"Honestly, Ron," Hermione said, the exasperation clear in her tone.  "Just because they're both gay doesn't mean they're automatically attracted to each other.  Besides," Hermione paused here as she glanced at the sky and slipped her Mac on, "according to Theo, Blaise always had a thing for Draco."
“It’s not that that’s bothering him,” Harry explained, raking one hand through his hair.  “He was okay when I told him we were together.  Shocked, understandably, given that until last week you had a long term girlfriend, but okay.”
Harry looked at her in confusion and was relieved to see Ron do the same. Pansy really wasn't making any sense. "Head start? How's that?"
Hedwig swooped in for another attack and Draco felt several strands of his hair pulled out from the root.  This proved to be the final straw.
"Father wasn't happy, obviously. But I pointed out that it was the most honest thing our name has been associated with in decades, so he can hardly complain. I think Mother just likes the regular makeovers." Malfoy gave himself a shake, an action that reminded Harry of the way he kept bad memories at bay.
"Really," Harry replied. "And if you hadn't burst in when you did, I'd be showing him just how much by now."
"You're a good looking bloke." Harry's expression said he hadn't meant to blurt that out, but Draco definitely appreciated the flush in his cheeks. "I mean, I'm not blind. And we do get on better now."
"A kitchen?"  Potter had clearly lost the thread of their conversation if the crease of his brow was anything to go by.
bed at the Manor wasn't quite what Harry had in mind.  So he held his tongue and followed Harry through the hospital's sanitised corridors.
"What?" Harry reaches out and grips her wrist for a moment, before both her expression and his common sense remind him to let go. He still wants to shake her though. "What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"
expression on her face, and hustled Ron towards the fireplace.  "We're off to Molly and Arthur's for lunch now.  But don't forget about Saturday."
It was Harry's turn to groan now, low and guttural.  Draco felt it vibrate through his mouth and couldn't help the moment of smug satisfaction he felt at being the one to wring such noises from him.
Draco nodded faintly and then turned his attention back to the painting, shifting uneasily.  "Well, you see...the thing is..."
Malfoy wrinkled his nose – a response, Harry knew, to his table manners.  "Sounds like fun," he said, in a voice that clearly said it did
So, dodging carefully around Dennis Creevey – who he still struggled to face after what had happened to Colin – Harry headed swiftly up the stairs to the boys' dormitory.  Once inside he was relieved to find himself alone – it was a rare luxury these days – so he headed over to his bed intent on already being asleep before his roommates, and Ron in particular, decided to join him.
"Never mind." Harry carefully avoided Pansy Parkinson's gaze. The last thing he wanted was this getting back to Malfoy – he was difficult enough to deal with as it was.
"Oh, I don't know," he says, trailing one finger down the stem of his wine glass.  "It's not like I have the most active of social lives either."
"Do you have to encourage him?" Harry asked plaintively.  "You know he'll make me go with him to all these places.  I've already been manipulated into going to some outdoor ice rink later - which I suppose I have
Potter looked disappointed, which more than pampered Draco's ego, but then he too seemed to realise the number of potential spectators and nodded his agreement.  He sank back in his seat with an air of resignation.
Draco shuddered – thinking of his mother, naked men, and sex, all as part of the same equation was not helping his food to go down.  A change of topic was called for, he decided.  "Speaking of Christmas," he said.  "Have you finished all your shopping?"  Anything to do with spending money was a sure fire way to distract his best friend.
"Any Howlers yet?"  Pansy's eyes flickered towards the window as if she expected to see a smoking, red envelope winging its way towards them at any moment.
Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd been so grateful for the existence of his Invisibility Cloak – and given the level of unwanted attention he'd received over the last six months, that was certainly saying something.
Harry crossed the room, nerves suddenly dissipated, and grasped his hand in a warm shake.  "Thank you for seeing me."
They slumped to the floor in a tangled mess of sweaty limbs and discarded clothing.  Draco found himself somewhat cradled in Harry's lap.  "Well," he said shakily, before the silence could become awkward, "that was new."
"Well done?  It's not like he's..." She trailed off, shaking her head.  "This is some kind of male virility crap, isn't it?"
“So I’m told.” Harry replied.  “It’s just, there’s Luna and Neville, Hermione, and even Ron says you’re okay now.”
Harry still hates Ministry galas. Possibly more now than ever. This one is turning out to be even more unpleasant than the last one he'd mistakenly agreed to attend. That had been years ago, just after the final battle, and no one, not Ginny or Draco had been able to coax him back until now. Pregnant women, it seemed, were his Kryptonite. Thank fuck he'd turned out to be gay.
The placing of Blaise's hand was fortunate indeed, because without it, Harry was pretty sure that his jaw would have hit the floor.
“But it’s Christmas,” Ron spluttered, clearly surprised he hadn’t found a sympathetic audience in Harry.  “What are we going to do Christmas day?”
“I know you’re not close.”  Andromeda’s wry smile indicated she knew just how much of an understatement this was.  “I just thought...with the wedding?  You’re both playing rather key roles.”
to find out about his budding friendship with Malfoy, it was just that he'd rather put it off for a while.  Like until after NEWTs or something – by which time Ron would be far more focussed on Harry's failure to join him in the Aurors to worry about something as trivial as Malfoy.
"Well, it's not like I can relax in front of the TV, is it?" Harry demanded – his tone a little harsher than intended. It shouldn't matter to him that Malfoy appeared to want rid of him, but it did, a little.
Instead, Hermione gave a sniff of irritation.  "It's all a bit rich coming from the man who hasn't had a relationship since we broke up over two years ago."
Harry nodded in the direction of the side table, where a bottle of wine and an empty glass stood waiting.
how long I’ve wanted to do this to you? How long I’ve wanted to see you, flushed and panting and completely destroyed, and to know that I was the one who brought you there?” Draco growled, low in Harry’s ear. “It’s been years, you absolute prat, and of course you’ve just become more buff and gorgeous and bloody
Harry was actually pleasantly surprised to discover Malfoy had purchased Twilfitt & Tattings after Mrs. Twilfitt’s retirement. It was just across the way from his store, Snitch & Stitch, and he had been worried that the next owner would worship him as others did. Malfoy would never do that (he’d prefer to quietly irritate his old rival), so Harry considered himself in the clear.
McGonagall’s mouth twitched, either trying to suppress a laugh or a glare. “I appreciate your concern, Mr. Thomas, but I see no harm in it. It’s not as though they could incapacitate each other with a waltz. Come forth please, gentlemen, and decide who is to lead.”
I had a great time this weekend. Couldn’t believe how fast the time went, though. Scorp is lovely, and the smile on your face when you talk to him breaks my heart with happiness.
Potter’s eyes stared deeply into Draco’s. He felt like a small animal caught in a trap, unable to escape that green glow. “I want a second chance. I want six months of your time for us to love each other again. If after that time, you don’t want to see me anymore, I’ll accept your choice.”
Harry fiddled with the frayed sleeve of his sweater, half-turning to face his boyfriend. "I mean, there’s always next year? I love Hogwarts over the holidays, and I don't want to leave Hermione alone."
Without another word, Draco hastily entered his home, shut the door behind him, and leaned back against it. His mate had desired a kiss. He hadn’t wanted to risk it, but the dragon within him had been delighted. Draco would never admit it to another soul, but he had almost said yes.
Apparently deciding Draco wouldn’t hex him into the ground if he picked the wrong song, Potter sighed, “Fine, hand me the bloody book then.” He frowned as he flicked through the choices, but his face brightened as he found the perfect song. He stepped on the small stage and cued up the machine before looking back at his friends with an unreadable face.
you look amazing,” Draco breathed. “I’m torching your old clothes when we return: all that ruddy flannel and old denim needs to go. I want you to dress like this always, but only for my view, or else the whole world will want to get their hands on you.”
Harry flopped down on his bed too. Seemed like a good way to avoid eye contact. “Oh. I mean, dating doesn’t always mean s-sex.”
Harry barely recognized his own voice when he spoke, strangled as it was. The blond man turned, and fierce grey eyes met Harry’s. Of course it was his long-lost dragon mate
“Hello, Mother,” Draco said, leaning down to brush a kiss across Narcissa’s knuckles. “You look lovely today: ‘beauty truly blent,’ indeed.”
The smile Harry received was totally without guile or pretense. It was not at all Malfoy, but something entirely Draco. Almost like the carefree man in Harry’s dream. Despite the reservations that still tugged at his mind, Harry's heart felt distinctly gooey.
Harry stalked to the edge of the lake again, cursing Malfoy and dragons and the whole damned world under his breath. Hesitant footsteps approached him. He tensed, expecting an unwelcome arm around his shoulder or a hand at the small of his back, but Malfoy just waited.
Malfoy’s voice behind him was clearly anguished, or at least as anguished as that stupid posh drawl could ever be. "No, I just know not what else to offer you! I possess wealth and good looks, but not much else. I just want
“I thank you, Draco. But that’s precisely how you praised me two weeks ago,” she replied, her eyes twinkling.
Harry shrugged and tugged his knit beanie down tighter on his unruly hair. “It’s fine, I’ll get something there. Lots of street food in London, it’ll be great.” Draco’s face was skepticism incarnate, but he offered Harry his arm regardless. Harry spun on his heel, and the two of them apparated to London. The square directly across from Grimmauld Place, specifically.
Unexpectedly, Draco was a bit of a lightweight. One pint in, his speech began to slur. A visible flush crept over his pale cheeks after the second. Three pints later, Draco’s hand was heavy and solid on Harry’s leg.
“You misunderstand me, Harry. I speak of nothing as tawdry as money,” Malfoy said in a low voice. “There are far more tantalizing things I could offer you. Myself, for example.”
. Draco feeds him pellucid grapes and tender fish from sun-warmed countries. He leaves Harry no need to fear. When Harry needs comforting, Draco gives it to him in abundance, without Harry ever having to ask. Draco takes him apart in bed, and puts him back together with great care. Draco’s bed holds him like a cloud, and Draco holds him like a man. He strokes his hair as Harry falls into sleep. It is a delicate, shivering flavor of joy, and Harry has never been happier.
“Yes, of course. This week, Alfie learned the hard way why we cover the case of moonstones before locking up each night...”
McGonagall, apple-cheeked and giggly, toasted them from where she was speaking with a surprisingly well-dressed Professor Vector. Judging by the twinkle in Vector’s eyes, they were discussing something decidedly more salacious than marking papers.
“Would you like that, Harry?” Draco asked, already starting to unbutton his waistcoat. Harry nodded, and Draco continued. Navy trousers and a lilac button-down followed the waistcoat, and Draco was nude too. He was toned and lean everywhere, except his perfectly plush arse. Harry’s mouth watered seeing his long, stiff cock. It was ruddy and full and looked good enough to eat.
“Call it research,” Harry said, rolling up his sleeves. “But I’m definitely intrigued. I think we should go see what it wants. I mean, a house that composes poetry? I’ve never heard of anything like that! Your house is bonkers, Malfoy.”
Worse, the more obsessed Harry became, the more present Malfoy seemed to be. Malfoy brought him coffee on a bleak, chilly Saturday. Malfoy dropped by Snitch & Stitch and invited him to lunch, looked oddly miffed when Harry begged off. He even brought his mother to buy a skein of lace-weight silk, smirking at Harry all the while.
Hermione scoffed and finally closed her book. “He couldn’t have learned Parseltongue, Harry. It’s innate, it’s not written down anywhere. Trust me, I’ve looked.”
fine. Edible, even. The carefully coiffed white-blond hair adorning the man’s head glimmered in a way that was oddly familiar...too familiar. An icy chill rippled down Harry’s spine.
Harry emerged and Draco’s deft fingers quickly adjusted the leather straps comfortably around Harry’s thigh. He bent a bit to test it, and it moved and flexed right along with him. The leather harness wrapped protectively around Harry’s thick thigh, almost like a second skin.
every time I’ve seen you. You have no idea how frustrated I’ve been. So I am going to take my time with you. Lay back and enjoy it.”
The owl took flight again, and Harry followed its path to see it land at the Slytherin table. Malfoy gave the owl a treat and waved cheekily at Harry. He scowled back and roughly yanked the attached note out of the bouquet.
Malfoy fell boneless onto one of the tall chairs at the kitchen island, one hand draped theatrically across his brow. “Oh no. We’re going to die here, Potter. Bury me amongst the china. If you dare chip a single piece of crockery, I'll haunt you for the rest of your days.”
Were you aware that Muggles have public libraries? Anyone can march in off the street and peruse the literature to their heart’s content. Obviously not everyone can possess a collection as impressive as the one at the Manor, but this may very well be the next best thing. My son Scorpius insists that the books in our library do not have enough pictures, so he has now thrice dragged me to the Muggle library near our home. After far too many hours of listening to a woman in a sparkly hat read agonizing fairy tales to squirming children (why are they agonizing, you ask? There’s no
Seamus grinned. “I thought I wasn’t half-bad. Didn’t ya like the high kicks? Pulled a muscle, I did, solely for your entertainment.”
“Deal,” Harry grinned and chucked a puff of bubbles into Draco’s face. He sputtered, scooped the bubbles off his own face, and tossed them back at Harry. Harry dodged and they hit the wall behind him with a wet slap.
“It just won’t go away! Vanishing spells, Owls, even the Muggle mail, nothing works!” Harry had complained to Hermione at their last pub night. She’d stopped picking at her chips, pushed her intricate braids away from her face, and fixed him with an exasperated look.
“Don’t be silly, Draco,” Harry scoffed, turning to press a chaste kiss to his cheek. “I’ll just see you before you leave tomorrow.”
Malfoy sprang up from his chair and whipped the door open. Harry followed, and Malfoy slammed the door shut just as the room they had occupied folded up into nothingness.

“Oh, I forgot you could see it. It’s mine, but really I just remember there being a brill food cart around here,” Harry explained, craning his neck around the square to see if the sausage man was there.
All of their school-day competitiveness rose to Harry’s mind, and he went after the Snitch with a vengeance. But this time there was a playful edge to it, a blunted edge to the knife-like thrill. They played two games of seeker’s Quidditch, each winning one and lording it over the other. After the second game, Malfoy spotted a door hidden in an odd little nook behind a hedge. They landed, left their brooms on the pitch, and cautiously passed through the door.
Potter narrowed his eyes, inspecting Draco closely. “You don’t like this conversation, though. Why?”
Do you like it? It’s not exactly the Slytherin common room, but I did borrow their view. Isn’t it entrancing?”
He used to bring me a platter of these as a child, as a special treat when I’d had a bad day.” He laughed softly. “I had considered naming the place Dobby’s, after him--but it doesn’t have quite the same ring as Spideys.”
Harry scowled and shook his head as if trying to shake out all his thoughts and leave his mind smooth and empty. Empty sounded nice. He knew he would just get tangled up in his own thoughts again if he stayed here on the ground. He needed his broom.
friend. Harry couldn’t recall Malfoy ever touching anyone else voluntarily, but he was always brushing against Harry’s side or tousling his hair and complaining about how it looked. He even tried to dress Harry sometimes, Malfoy stripping off his jumper for Harry if he felt cold, or wrapping a Slytherin scarf around his neck before they went out to fly. It was awfully strange, but it genuinely seemed to make Malfoy happy, so Harry figured it was fine.
. He quickly told his friends about Malfoy’s invitation to Hogsmeade, how Smith had interrupted, and then how Malfoy spat flickering fire at Smith and absconded with Harry.
fit, and the snogging is--anyway, then I get all cold and mad and Draco ends up with a black eye or bat bogeys or something.” He laughed shakily. “Kinda decided it’s just safer to not do much more than kiss.”
escaped his mouth, but Malfoy didn’t seem to hear him. Harry wasn’t sure if it had been a question or a protest, but after a moment, it didn’t seem to matter anymore. Because Harry
“Are your robes on fire, Weasley?” Malfoy drawled. “Or just your face? It’s traditionally considered polite to knock. However, since you’ve already barged in, the analysis is in my outbox there. You may have to brush by Pansy to get it, but I’m sure she won’t mind.”
“Quite,” Malfoy sniffed and perched on the sofa across from Harry’s. “We can discuss the manor now if you’d like. What questions did you have, Potter?”
Harry was quite ready to go to bed. His limbs drifted with fatigue, weighed down by his leaden feet, pinched in the awful dress shoes Draco had selected. Even as exhausted as Harry was, he rather thought he’d like a bit of a snog behind a tapestry before he bade Draco good night. His boyfriend should be rewarded in some way by wearing those striking robes, right?
.” Harry practically snarled, feeling the harsh burn of anger in his throat. He wheeled about and headed for the castle’s exit, barely caring at all if Malfoy followed. He was Harry Potter: he’d killed bloody Voldemort, and wasn’t about to be pushed around by some poncy eighth-year student, no matter how fit he was.
his mind screamed. Suddenly, without quite knowing how, Malfoy was now flat on his belly on the ground, with Harry’s knee in the small of his back and a wand at his throat.
Harry thought, his cheeks flushing as heated memories came to mind. It was a nice feeling; it had been years since he’d felt truly warm.
Harry huffed out a laugh and stuffed the robes back into the box, his heart still racing a bit from the scare. “Yeah, I guess. I’ll buy you some as long as we never talk about Draco’s pants again.”
He summoned it from the broom shed and kicked off hard from the ground. Nervous energy thrummed through him, so he rocketed around the Quidditch pitch to try to burn it off. Harry caught himself looking over his shoulder multiple times: not for danger, but for a companion. He swore at himself each time and pushed away the niggling thought that something was missing. After careening toward the ground countless times grew stale, he flew in long, leisurely loops over the Forbidden Forest, watching the thestrals and centaurs gallop below. The sun beat down warm on his back, but the icy cold twining about his heart greeted him like an old enemy.
A soft whimper escaped from down the hall. Could that be Malfoy? He must have been in trouble or being shagged; either way, Harry had to see. He snuck down the hall, readying his wand as he peeked inside the room. He did see Malfoy, but not at all in the way he’d expected.
“Good.” Draco felt rather than saw Potter smile, and they stayed staring up at the night sky together for a long time.
For the first time in months, Harry felt warm. It was delightful. Strong arms held him close, and he could smell something woodsy and fresh, cedar and lemon perhaps? More than feeling warm, he felt more whole than he had since before the war. In a word, Harry felt
Ron knelt down next to Harry, who was very embarrassed to discover himself splayed on the floor of the Great Hall and
The common room was deserted in the half-light of dusk, so Hermione must have still been in her room. Boldness struck Harry, along with a wonderful idea.
Malfoy counted down for them. Harry knew when it was time to move, but he stepped forward and their bodies collided awkwardly and Harry trod on one of Malfoy’s long feet.
"Of course, Potter. Quality attracts quality. I am the epitome of grace and luxury myself, why should I accept anything less? Come, I’ll show you to the back room."
The man peered through the window of the new fast food joint. The menu board was too far away to read through the glass, but the blurry pictures looked pretty good. The orange and white wallpaper was appealing. The restaurant appeared deserted, which was usually a bad sign, but he was in a hurry...
Malfoy’s face was still unusually solemn, but his mouth quirked in amusement. “I assure you that it’s not cursed or jinxed in any way. Please read it carefully. I would stay, but I ought to take my leave before I am chased off--that one looks rather hostile.”
“You remember our house-elf Dobby, don’t you?” Malfoy’s mouth made a slight moue of displeasure. “The one you
Malfoy held out one hand. “I do hope you’ll allow me to lead.” Harry’s stomach flipped as it registered the hope on Malfoy’s handsome face. Perhaps he’d planned all of this as some twisted way to woo or mock Harry?
“You’re still wearing your flower crown.” He’d closed his eyes, and opened them to see Malfoy staring inscrutably at him.
Potter paled. “I mean, I s’pose someone has to go. Alright then.” He spun the bottle on the table, watching as it slowed. The neck of the bottle pointed directly at the shocked face of Draco Malfoy.
“The prefect’s bathroom, of course. After traveling, I need to bathe.” Draco waved away imaginary fumes with one hand before fixing Harry with a sultry look. “Care to join me?”
. It’s good, I learn a lot and I can still help people. Saving the wizarding world in a whole different way, and it’s one that has regular hours,” Potter explained with a wink.
Harry was beginning to feel the strain of keeping his hands to himself. He was dying to drag his teeth across the vast expanse of creamy skin exposed before him, even to lick just one pink, pink nipple. His arms shook with effort and his heart beat so quickly it was verging on uncomfortable. Was it even possible for wizards to have heart attacks? Harry had no clue, but he knew something awful would happen if he didn’t get his hands on Draco
“Come on, I’ll tell you about it while we eat,” Ron said, half-shoving Harry into the kitchen. “You like shepherd’s pie, right? This recipe has paprika in it, I think it’ll be good.”
. He remembered there was something he had to talk to Draco about, but couldn’t remember….oh yes, that’s what it was.
Harry puts out the fire with his wand. He gathers the mugs, bag of tea leaves, and kettle, and heads down to the kitchen.
"Healer Stamford says there is a fifteen foot long parchment about the research, and he says—" Kreacher's eyes well up "—he says he put Kreacher's name at the top along with his own."
"Hey, don't worry about me. You have to sleep tonight. Didn't you say you liked that one ginger tea? I know we have plenty."
He gets dressed in his flying gear. He has planned to spend the morning playing quidditch with Teddy.
Kreacher nods his approval, and Harry closes the bag again while they wait for the kettle to whistle.
Lastly, he pours the now-cool excess water from the kettle into the herb garden Kreacher has growing in the garden window.
"Kreacher, it's late. You know we negotiated your hours. How about you stop for the night and I make you some tea?"
Harry watches Kreacher yawn and shoos him off to sleep with the promise that he will take everything back down to the kitchen.
Harry chuckles. He hangs the tea kettle on the hook and pushes the long metal arm into the fireplace. "Which tea would you like tonight?"
The art is part of the program, but Harry is often in awe holding it in his hands for the first time. He has a small collection of his favorites lining the ceiling in his home office.
Harry ties his last lace. He shouts a farewell to Kreacher as he goes down the stairs. He takes his broom out of the coat-and-broom closet in the entrance hallway. On the front porch, he twists away to Andromeda's house.
He checks the bottom of the page for the letter that indicates his apparition point. He has been to this house before and remembers well which letter refers to which point.
Harry sets the mask back on the tissue paper. He double-checks the Rules, Instructions, and Reminders parchment.
"Master Harry would have summoned the kettle from the kitchen, and Kreacher does not want metal banging around hall corners and ruining the decor."
Teddy is only two short years away from heading off to Hogwarts, and he is sure to be on a team with all the practice he's gotten with Harry during his lifetime so far.
Harry can't help mirroring Kreacher's emotions. "That's really amazing, Kreacher. I'm thrilled for you!"
"Healer Stamford appreciates Kreacher's unique contributions to the art of healing. He told Kreacher so. Kreacher suggested a common elf remedy for dragonpox during the seasonal peak, and Healer Stamford has been comparing its effects to wizarding remedies. Healer Stamford combined the remedies, and he says the result is more powerful and will help heal the very bad cases!"
There is an entire membership binder for this club. (Believe me when I say I went overboard on the details.) Harry keeps it in a locked drawer in his desk.
He removes his crumbs from the table. Harry insists that he be allowed to clean his own food crumbs and drips if Kreacher is occupied elsewhere. He thinks Kreacher cleans the table again after him, but he's never caught him at it.
Kreacher agrees. He caps the polish bottle, folds the rag, and snaps his fingers to send both items back to their place in the cleaning supplies storage cabinet behind a trick wall off the kitchen.
His quidditch morning with Teddy turned into an all-day affair when Uncle Draco showed up with a packed lunch and a thirst to turn their morning practice into an afternoon every-man-for-himself quidditch battle. They returned to Andromeda in the late afternoon mud-covered and scraped, at which point she insisted they stay for dinner. Harry and Draco both left the dozing nine-year-old and his glaring grandmother before bath time, but Harry thinks she was secretly pleased that she had extra time to herself all afternoon.
Malfoy chuckled a little and nudged Harry back. “Unexpectedly, I’m not quite sure. It is a true luxury to be able to plan ahead, to dream. It’s one I never thought I’d have again. If anyone had told me this time last year that I’d be sitting here with you, discussing our future, I’d have thought them absolutely barmy. But to answer your question: I enjoy Potions, and my family owns a variety of enterprises, but I’m waiting to hear about something else before I make any decisions. It’s very important, but I can’t make any other choices until I hear about it.”
He crossed the street after they’d left to get a better look, but only so he and Ron and Hermione could laugh about it later. Unfortunately, Malfoy stepped out his door at the same time.
Follow me, we’ll begin with tea.” Malfoy opened the door wider and gestured Harry inside. He stared at Harry for a beat, as though he didn’t know what to do with him, started, tripped a bit over his own feet, and finally led Harry to a drawing room down a long blue hallway.
But Harry was a bit more concerned by what was directly in front of them. Sacks of flour and sugar, a lump of creamy yellow butter, and a Muggle stand mixer sparkled on the kitchen’s center island.
hadn’t known why Potter had chosen another path, despite speculating on it for weeks. “Why, if I may ask?”
look and flopped down casually next to Malfoy. He busied himself unpacking the hamper and handed his friend a frosty butterbeer, uncapping his own.
Draco pouted rather becomingly as Harry told him about rescuing Ron and Gabrielle beneath the lake’s murky depths, and Harry could tell he was jealous. He dared to brush a kiss against Draco’s cheek, but quickly retreated behind a second sandwich to prevent anymore.
Harry scoffed. There was no way he could make it through a whole dinner with Malfoy, even under the pretense of completing his order. The next day, another note arrived. It was Harry’s favorite so far.
“Thank you for your glowing vote of confidence,” Pansy groused, rolling her eyes. Glamorously, of course, as she did everything.
“Of course not. You didn’t think I would let you slip away now, did you? No. Remember what I said,” Draco growled, twining his arms about Harry’s neck and nipping his ear affectionately. “I do not share. You’re mine, Harry. And I look after what’s mine.” He stared at Harry for a heated moment before stepping back, seemingly mollified by the surprise and acceptance he saw in his eyes. Draco nodded smugly and turned to walk down the hall, still fully nude.
It may have been just the power of suggestion, but even Pansy had to admit that Potter looked rather sexy as he sang. His blue shirt had been half-unbuttoned all night, and the tan chest beneath glistened with a light sheen of sweat. Rather than staring at the back wall, a silly smile was creeping across his face as he tapped one foot to the beat.
“Oh. Well, I did some poking around, and I found some places you might want to study here. If you’re interested,” Hermione said, peeking coyly at him beneath her lashes.
I didn't intend to catch you when you tripped. I didn't intend to grab you by the waist or feel your wrist under my fingers. Your skin is insanely cold, Malfoy, or I was the one burning up. And you have the deepest eyes when you stare at someone, it makes one drown and forget oneself. I certainly forgot who I was when I kissed you in that moment.
What the fuck are you doing here? Why the fuck must I deal with you again? How dare you, how fucking dare you talk to my friends? Get close to Luna? Invade my life like that?
Hermione’s only trying to make me pity you and take care of you. I need to take care of your feelings, she says, to make an effort, to come to you and… what? Become your friend?
You were supposed to go to France! Maybe pass by, spend a little time with us but… not invade my life, my friends, my house… As if I wanted to see you and be reminded of you when I am with my friends. I hate it, I hate you.
I still feel the heat of your mouth on mine, I remember vividly your shaking hands, your flustered eyes, the way they expanded with fear when we stopped doing it. You have the deepest eyes Malfoy, do you know that? And you look at me too much, with such intensity I feel myself shiver every time I notice it. It’s because of them, entirely because of them that I let that kiss happen. Believe me I didn’t intend to prior to tonight, I didn’t plan it or anticipate it. It simply happened. And those eyes, they were different after we stopped. They reminded me of that day, in the bathroom at Hogwarts, when I attacked you. You had seemed so scared, so fragile in that moment. As you did just after our kiss, when we looked at each other in silence, while I was still trying to understand what happened.
I won't ever be able to say it to you but here, in this alter-life where you can read this letter, know that I care about you. That if I could, I would keep you warm every night so you don't ever remember Azkaban. I would listen to you for hours talking about all those dead poets you love so much. I would follow you in France and wait for you naked on the hotel bed. I would make you forget about your worries and that thing that makes you run so fast. I would make you feel welcome and wanted, loved and cherished, you would stop chasing after a redemption you don't need because I would have gotten it for you.
I won’t cry, I won’t complain, I’ll stay with you, I’ll be your shadow, devoted to you and asking nothing in return. Hoping that, one day, you’ll get down to me and kiss me again like all those other times when you made me feel alive.
For once, I’ll forget my pride and stop trying to be so composed in front of you, who’s always so calm and strong, who’s got wisdom somewhere in the last years Merlin’s knows how. I beg you to take pity of me, of my misery and my loneliness. I need you and I never knew how much I did before I lost you.
You’re everything I hate, you drove me crazy for years, you were a Death Eater, a murderer, a traitor, so why can’t I let you die alone like the trash you are?
And since then, it has gone downhill. You won over Hermione, Ron resisted a little but he’s joined the Malfoy cause now. Soon I had no allies and only enemies when Luna asked if you could come at the pub with us. You and I, in a pub, together.
There, I wrote it, and God it feels good. Fuck you Malfoy. I hate you, I despise you,  you entitled little piece of shit. You deserve everything that’s happening to you. If anything good happened in your life I would wish for it to go away. Fuck. What you deserve is not happiness or forgiveness but to rot in hell and never come back. That way I won’t have to suffer the thought of your freaking existence. So I don’t have to deal with you.
If I can, I’ll choose pity, I’ll choose repentance, I’ll choose to give you another chance again and again. Even if you disappoint me every fucking time.
At the time I didn’t care but now, back in my room, alone with my thoughts and my quill, I can’t help but wonder. What were you so afraid of, Malfoy? Was it me? It seems absurd to be because you seem invincible ever since you got out of Azkaban. Scared of nothing. I had been expecting you to be weak and dirty, with an edge in your voice just like Sirius. But you were nothing like that. In fact you lost that edge you had for so long in Hogwarts, as if Azkaban had taken the fire in your veins and replaced it with liquid ice.
The ways your eyes grabbed mine and made my stomach turn on itself. It hurt so bad to realise the power you had on me.
In this other world I sent you all those letters, I'm not in love with Ginny, I can convince you to stop your journeys and your quest, you love me so much you want to live in the country too and your biggest dream is to get settled down and have a family with me. You like children, you like whatever job you could get, you help me get through this life I molded myself into. We spend our lives together and we grow old together. And you were never a second choice and I was never a cheater.
I have no solution for you, I have no magic trick that can solve this situation easily but I’ll try, I’ll do my best.
I guess you’ll get a few years? Three at the most, if you haven’t hidden something from me. Again. Any murder hidden under your bed, Malfoy? What did your father make you do? Your aunt, your mother? Luna told me you killed “almost” no one in the battle, and you could call legitimate defense. As if.
The point is, you’ll be out someday if all goes according to plan. You’ll be out and for Merlin’s sake I sincerely hope you’ll get on the first Portkey to France to live with some distant family and leave us in peace. No more Malfoy, no more Draco, no more of your stupid and pointed face popping in my mind when I want to relax.
It’ll soon be two years since you’ve been gone and I can’t find any reason why you would want news from me. If I ever send you a letter you’ll certainly rip it before opening it, dramatic as you are. There is no way you would answer my questions or explain to me how you’re coping with being imprisoned. So why do I want to know?
Even since you’ve left me, my life has been shit. I don’t sleep, my nightmares came back, my house is a prison, my wife can’t understand what’s happening, neither do my friend; I don’t know how to speak about all those things inside me and I can’t, I simply can’t live without you. I won’t. I refuse to let you go without a fight.
It’s hard not to think of you. Luna speaks about you nearly every week, like you’re her new project or something. You’re exchanging letters, apparently. I must be stupid because I didn't even know that you could send letters there, or that prisoners could write back.
They lay still, catching their breath, before Harry smiled lazily at Draco. “Who knew? I like the way we fit.”
“He doesn’t even like toast,” Harry murmured. At least he managed to take a bite of muffin this time.
“The courting ritual has ended, and Harry has to respond. He’s going to tentatively agree to date Malfoy.”
Hermione tutted, patting one springy lock of her hair back into place. With her upswept hair and wasp-waisted crimson dress, she looked a bit like a Muggle film star. “Yes, yes, get all of that out of the way now. At least Neville isn’t participating.”
"Yes, love. Although I suppose that would be true of whoever happened to waltz in, but I know what you meant." Draco closed the portrait hole and stepped closer, dropping his bag carelessly on the floor and tracing Harry’s face with his fingertips. Surely he’d become even more handsome since he’d left; he seemed to glow, even in the dim light of the common room. Harry nodded fervently and pulled him onto his lap, traveling cloak and all.
“Course,” Harry grinned back. “Cheers, Draco,” he said, turning to him and clinking their glasses together.
Draco smirked at him playfully over one shoulder, warm and brilliant. “Who said you weren’t allowed to touch?"
Malfoy Manor” to his wand. To his dismay, he had to walk all the way around the pond and down a lane on the other side. Apparently, his Apparition was much more approximate than he’d intended after all.
Harry grimaced and made some inane comment about the flower beds. Their conversation was stilted again at first, but by the time they’d worked their way through the biscuits, Harry had a stitch in his side from laughing at Malfoy’s stories about Bitsy and her vendetta with Pansy Parkinson’s elf. Malfoy had grown rather wan in the kitchen, and Harry was relieved to see a bit more color in his face (not that there ever really was much to begin with). Inevitably their laughter slowed, and the tea grew cold. Malfoy rose and peered at the conservatory walls, searching for some kind of hidden catch or lever, but nothing was found.
Harry bent down obediently and gentle hands placed the honeysuckle in his hair. Malfoy deftly arranged the blossoms around tufts of Harry’s unruly hair, winding the two together until he was satisfied.
“Oi Harry, over here!” Seamus called out as Harry entered the library. Madam Pince glowered imperiously in their direction, but Seamus tossed a flirtatious wink right back. Harry half-thought he saw her blush, but her face disappeared so quickly behind a teetering stack of books that he couldn’t be sure.
Draco smirked. “Speechless, the desired effect. Excellent.” He held out one arm for Harry to grasp. “Shall we? The evening awaits.”
“No, Mother understands the pull I feel toward my mate. And she’s headed to our French villa for the new year, so she had much to occupy her mind.”
“Mate, your mortal enemy just leaped over a fucking table to check you were alright. Something’s definitely off,” Ron said, shaking his head as he helped Harry up.
Ignoring the scowl on Ron’s face, Harry agreed and snuggled even deeper into his bed. “Yeah, whatever you like, ‘Mione.”
“Well, Luna’s calmed down a bit since Hogwarts, but she’s still held on to some of the more grounded conspiracy theories. She had me look into the Rotfang Conspiracy, which turned out to be false, but it turned out that the Ministry wasn’t providing dental care to anyone who’d been hired in the ‘90s because they contractually didn’t have to back then.”
“Right. Er, I dunno what your plans are, but I figured I should tell you I’m staying at Hogwarts over the break.”
Not wanting to draw any more attention to himself, Harry tried to get to his feet. But Hermione was faster than him and pinned his shoulders down. Merlin, she was much stronger than he’d expected. She ran a few diagnostic spells and seemed pleased with the results, finally letting him up. “Harry’s perfectly fine, he just needs to eat. The feast should be starting any minute, so he’ll be alright.”
Dream-Malfoy’s eyes sharpened, resembling his corporeal self much more. “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But even if this is not real...it has the potential to be.” The image before Harry’s eyes faded as he felt himself waking. Soon he was back in his red-curtained four-poster, Ron snoring behind him and more confused than ever.
. You’ve heard of that one, right? Unfortunately, most retellings leave out the bloodthirsty bits, which are always the best parts in fairy tales. I’d recommend reading the real version some time.
“Harry, I stopped by the Owlery and look at all the presents!” Hermione called out gleefully, levitating a stack of paper-wrapped parcels through the portrait hole and neatly stacking them beneath the enormous Christmas tree in the corner.
“You berk. After that ludicrous display, I fear I don’t have much choice.” Draco smirked. “Since you think I’m so heartbreakingly sexy, and most of my things are there anyway.” Pansy laughed. Ron gagged.
As the music died down, Potter stalked over to Draco and straddled his lap, capturing his lips in a kiss.
,” spilled out of Harry. In Parseltongue, thank Godric, or else he would definitely have detention. He shot up out of his seat and shook his fringe until the small flame went out, but it had singed his forehead a bit.
Harry scoffed and tried not to flinch. He pulled his hand from hers and placed it back on his pint. That was a safe place, where no one could feel his pulse jump at the very mention of Malfoy. “Course. What feelings? I don’t talk about him anymore at all, haven’t seen him in years.”
Yet to Harry’s dismay, observing Malfoy made him feel better than he had in months: less itchy, less agitated, less cold. More like himself. He told himself it was just the additional exercise and pushed any other explanations to the very back of his mind. Nothing
Hermione gasped. “Harry, that’s a courting gift! You can’t just pass them off to anyone who walks by!”
Unfortunately, Draco didn’t come down to breakfast the next day, either. Or the third day. He wasn’t in classes, or at any other meals either. Harry tried to ask Zabini about Draco’s whereabouts in Potions, but he gazed right through Harry as though he weren’t there at all. Greg was no better: he loudly announced he had to go to the toilet and lumbered out of the classroom as though being chased by an angry hippogriff.
The man stared open-mouthed at the menu options, his banal confusion melting into something far more alarming. “Hi, could I get the, uh...wait, what is this place again?”
“You could still always come to the Burrow,” Ron muttered, tossing a stack of unlaundered robes into the trunk.
him. And then it spontaneously manifested three cases of vintage merlot for everyone in the room. As an
Harry then stumbled down seemingly every staircase in the castle, trying his best to dawdle at interesting tapestries and breathe deeply. He tripped on countless little tufts of tangled grass on his way to the lake’s shore, and almost turned his ankle in a niffler’s hole. Somehow, Malfoy arrived only a few moments after he did.
Draco mouthed Harry’s cock through his pants, and the sensation of his warm mouth was almost too much to bear. He helped Harry shimmy off his pants and jeans, and Harry was fully naked.
“Yes, I had a particular request to make.” Harry’s heart stopped as Draco shuffled closer and knelt down on one knee, taking Harry’s cold, cold hand. “Would you do me the honor of attending the Yule Ball with me?”
Glancing up at Malfoy’s face, he looked positively feral with rage. Gone was the posh and pristine boy Harry thought he knew; before him stood a wild man, with the silver eyes that Harry thought he had hallucinated. He was almost completely unrecognizable. A furious beast seemed to struggle beneath his skin, clamoring to escape and capture its quarry. Strings of furious French poured from his mouth, but Harry didn’t catch any of it.
Thundering down the hallway at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement always made Ron Weasley feel particularly powerful. Thick dragonhide boots pounded against the floor, and scarlet Auror robes billowed in his wake. He usually just walked instead of thundering: being a war hero and finally filling out his six-foot frame had helped Ron feel much more comfortable in his own skin. But going to Malfoy’s office always required a bit of a confidence boost. He reached the door that read D. Malfoy, Ministry Potions Consultant in ridiculous ornate script and burst in without knocking.
at my mate, I’ll incinerate you where you stand.”  He smiled tightly, malice concealed behind his teeth. “Good night, then.”
When he had yelled himself hoarse and thrice broken a stupidly large vase, Draco cast a quick cooling charm and made himself decent again (including a glamour for those
He swam to the far side of the bath and sat beside Draco, pressing his trembling thigh to Draco’s muscled one. He reached out under the water to find Draco’s hand, but found something else entirely. Something much harder and warmer and more enticing. A sharp hiss issued from Draco’s lips, and Harry almost jerked away, but on his next breath Draco said, “You can touch me, if you want.”
Hermione stared thoughtfully across the Great Hall at Malfoy, who was now taking very prim sips of his tea (black with two sugars, as Harry had noted. One less than usual). “Definitely not a ferret, Ronald. Harry, you know, it’s probably nothing but your own paranoia. But I may as well go to the library and do some research.” With that, she tucked the enormous book into her bag and flounced off, bushy hair bouncing behind her. Ron only looked at Harry for a beat, shrugged, and took a second helping of streaky bacon. Harry went back to watching Malfoy, determined that he would eventually figure him out.
Malfoy finally looked at Harry then, those sharp gray eyes almost wistful for once. “Please, Harry. I swear I shan’t touch you. But there are several things I must explain.”
Their Christmas Eve was a very quiet one, spent together in front of the common room fire. Rather than sitting through a silent Christmas feast with the few others who had stayed over the holidays, they asked the house elves to bring up a selection of the foods they liked best: fluffy dinner rolls with plenty of jam; bacon-dressed sprouts (since Hermione had insisted on at least one veg); wedges of sweet golden oranges; thick ham sandwiches, slathered with spicy mustard; and, of course, a tray of mini treacle tarts.
Blaise smirked. “You know, Potter hasn’t sung yet.” Hermione whacked him on the knee, but said nothing to stop him.
“The manor did it,” Malfoy murmured, his cheeks aflame. It was unattractive, blotchy and red as it was against his white skin, but endearing all the same.
“They must not get many visitors,” Harry muttered as the gates snapped sharply shut behind him. Graceful trees bowed along a gravel path that crunched under Harry’s feet. He must have walked for at least twenty minutes before the house finally became visible through the trees.
Ron stared at Harry in exhausted disbelief. “Can I spit sparks, Harry? Please tell me you would’ve noticed that.”
Biting into the crust wasn’t so bad--it was evenly breaded, and the Cajun seasoning was pretty good--but, god, then he got to the actual
“Malfoy, wh--” A very confused Harry tried to interrupt, but Malfoy’s thumb stroked roughly across his lips. Practically a caress, if a very dominant one. Apparently no arguing back would be allowed.
The years had been gentle to Narcissa Malfoy. She glanced up at her son as he entered, and a smile ghosted across her features. (It would never dare stay longer, for fear of wrinkles tarnishing her magnificent face.) The celadon green robes she wore brought out the roses in her pale cheeks, and her eyes were as sharp and striking as ever. Draco was always excessively complimentary to his mother: how could he not be, when praise leaped so easily to his tongue? For her, at least. Today was no different.
had breathlessly gossiped about Harry for weeks, until Harry had threatened legal action. Most people had then lost interest. But while everyone knew he was gay, only a very discreet few knew that the Boy Who Lived was now the Man Who Likes to Get Fucked. Harry likes to be filled, to be dominated, rather than being the conquering hero in bed that all the
Harry chewed thoughtfully on his own cheese and tomato sandwich before he answered. “I think I’ll become an Auror. Everyone expects it, and it’d probably be a good fit. They would’ve taken me this year, but I didn’t want to get in just because I’m Harry Potter. I want to apply and go through the training, just like everyone else.”
Draco was irritated again. This time, it was because the next emotion to arise within him was boredom. A sludgy, inescapable swamp of tedium, one that mired any passers-by in rank mud and lured them to their death. He hadn’t felt anything for seven years, why would it only be the most banal emotions returning to him?!
“Come in, quickly now. Closer to the phonograph, there we go. I’d prefer not to shout,” McGonagall chided. “Thank you. As witches and wizards who will be mingling in society, it is imperative that you know how to conduct yourselves. It is normal for us to review these skills with graduating students, but due to the upcoming Yule Ball, it is particularly important that you know how to dance. Let us have two students exhibit a waltz for us.” She scanned the crowd of students before her for a moment. “Mr. Malfoy, and...Mr. Potter. Please come and demonstrate what you remember from our previous dance lesson.”
The dinosaurs were impressive, but after following Draco around museums all morning, Harry was almost relieved to return to Diagon Alley and enter Twilfitt and Tattings. Draco had been bemoaning Harry’s wardrobe for so long and with such gusto that he went through the door and rifled through the racks like a flash.
Harry was immediately distracted by Ron keeling over and babbling incomprehensibly, right on the floor of the Great Hall. Neville at least had the presence of mind to take Ron to the hospital wing, while Seamus and Dean only hugged each other to keep from falling over and laughed until they cried.
In the meantime, Harry had swiped a quill and ink from a table in the common room and run pell-mell up to the Owlery. He scrawled a quick note and attached it to the owl he could coax down the fastest.
The oak doors creaked open to reveal a wintry vision. Harry could hardly believe the Great Hall had been a battleground only months before. Magicked snowflakes fell from the ceiling above, catching and shining in dancers’ hair. Wreaths of waxy holly and ivy ringed the room, and brilliant fairy lights winked from every nook and cranny. Wooden trestle tables thrust against the walls groaned with bounty: towers of pastries, tureens of fragrant soup, and platters of roasted poultry and beef. Smaller tables dotted one side of the hall, intended for nibbles and resting one’s tired feet.
Draco sighed. Skilled fingers slid under Harry’s shirt, removing it quickly. One hand toyed with Harry’s nipple as Draco surveyed his prize with the hungry eyes of a predator. But Harry was already achingly hard, so he only let Draco admire him for a moment before grabbing his regrettably perfect arse and pulling him back in. Draco’s mouth was pleasure and pain, sin and forgiveness, all at once, and Harry knew he’d never forget his taste.
They both regretted it very much the next morning. A mind-bogglingly hungover Harry and Hermione stumbled down from their beds around noon and opened gifts in front of the little tree. Christmas was not quite as much fun when one had a pounding headache and no stomach for the treats overflowing from one’s stocking, but they went through the motions all the same. Each present was more delightful than the last, but they’d only unwrapped half the pile when Hermione had put a hand to her mouth and mused that she might go back to bed after all.
Draco regarded Potter coolly. Did he actually care about the answer? Draco was so bored that he chose to be honest with his response. “Potter, this is small talk. Idle conversation about acquaintances. Pleasantries are something in which I have been trained, but I do not enjoy them. Small talk feels to me like slowly dying, one word at a time.”
I was going to wait until Friday, but I had this chapter ready to go and couldn't wait any longer. Thank you for reading!
Harry wanted to shag his boyfriend into the carpet right there, but he shut his gaping mouth and tried to chuckle casually. “As much as I like the outfit, this is already unrealistic. I don’t think you’d wear this to karaoke.”
“So be it.” Draco reluctantly lifted his hand, and Potter grabbed it in his own. They shook and Draco felt the ancient magic swirl about their combined grasp. The boon had been granted.
Draco sniffed disdainfully and endeavored to stand up straight. He failed, of course, and slumped back against Harry’s side. “You can’t expect anything less. I am a Malfoy after all. Standards to uphold and all that.”
A very confused Harry wandered outside, to the edge of the lake. He took a seat under a gnarled old oak and began to read.
would also be appropriate, though I’m quite sure you wouldn’t know culture if it bit you in the arse.”
Malfoy’s face paled, but his words remained as posh and smooth as ever as he agreed, “I believe it is. Shall we adjourn to the library?” The room was now the size of a small automobile.
“Oh, and Teddy and Victoire are adorable together!” Potter continued. “They act like they’re not best friends, but the moment one of them is in trouble, the other would die for them. They’re going to cause so much trouble when they get to Hogwarts.” He guffawed before glancing at Draco quietly sipping his wine. He had ordered steak tartare, while Potter, the barbarian, had attempted to order fish and chips from the children’s menu. Luckily the mustachioed server had redirected him to the shepherd’s pie. “Are...are you not listening to me?”
Harry was breathless. The brutal competition and the outright glee on Malfoy’s face in the sunshine (was it real? Created by the room? Harry didn’t care) had stolen it away from him.
“A Malfoy always avenges wrongs. A Malfoy always defends his family. Above all, a Malfoy always protects his mate,” Malfoy finished. “That’s you, Harry. You’re my mate. I didn’t know until June, when everything changed. I knew my mate was out in the world somewhere, and that I’d meet them at Hogwarts. I had no idea it would be you. But I am glad it’s you. I think we’ve always been drawn to each other, for good or for bad.
Draco rolled his eyes, a motion that seemed as natural for him as breathing. "For the love of… please shut your stupid, lovely mouth and let me finish my question before our beards are as long and grey as Dumbledore's." Harry shrugged and waved one hand about as if to convey that if anyone would be interrupting, it wouldn't be him, no sirree.
Harry glanced at Hermione with questioning eyes, and she immediately understood. “Oh, it must have an undetectable extension charm on it. You’ll have to reach inside, Harry.”
It was all Potter’s fault. On the day of their second meeting, Potter had insisted they tour some Muggle art museum where none of the paintings made any sense, and all the sculptures were amorphous blobs. None of the portraits moved, of course, which was strange enough. Where were the paintings of aristocratic forebears, the statues of heroes slaying dragons? Draco wasn’t interested in artfully nude sculptures, but surely there ought to be some of them around as well. He had long ago given up the anti-Muggle prejudices he had been taught, but wizarding art was obviously superior.
Harry hummed noncommittally, trying not to think about how warm Malfoy’s hands felt. He failed when Malfoy’s hands settled on his hips, measuring them slowly and carefully. One thumb carefully brushed his hip bone under the guise of straightening the tape. Harry gulped as he felt himself growing hard.
Ron looked aghast. Apparently a relationship without sex was appalling, a fate worse than death. He gulped before continuing. “That’s rough. If you ever need help getting used to it, to, er, being touched or whatever, we can practice.”
“Bad? With the dragon inheritance thing, I don’t know what’ll happen to him if I reject him. I...I think it’s wrong to not even give him a chance, and what if he needs me?” Images of Malfoy wasting away swam behind Harry’s eyes and caused him a surprising amount of pain.
have asked the Ministry’s Department of Unusual Magic Phenomena to continue to fund your studies here in England, and they tripped all over themselves saying yes. They gave me the list of sentient homes and agreed to pay for whatever you need, as long as you publish the results of what you find.”
Draco thought, tapping his foot and staring at yet another portrait of assorted colorful blobs. But, observing how Potter was drinking in an oddly geometric painting with obvious adoration, Draco was wise enough to keep his thoughts to himself.
“I’m so glad it’s just you three,” Harry said, dropping his bulging bookbag on the floor and taking a seat. “You won’t have any questions about me and Malfoy, unlike literally everyone else in the whole school.”
“Not again,” Harry grumbled. He had thought the gifts were over. He had been courted successfully, that requirement or ego trip or whatever it was had been fulfilled, and everyone could move on with their lives. But shortly after he’d agreed to attend the Yule Ball with Draco, another large white gift box waited for him on his messy bed, a crisply folded note resting on top. It read:
The Monday after he and Malfoy had agreed on a tentative friendship, Harry, Ron, and Hermione stumbled sleepily down the stairs to the Great Hall to find Malfoy seated at the Gryffindor table, near their usual spot. Perfect posture, perfectly straight Slytherin tie, and a perfectly serious look on his perfectly handsome face. Seamus was glaring intensely in Malfoy’s direction and muttering under his breath to Dean beside him, while Neville only clutched his favorite potted plant (a sickly moly he’d named Edwin) close to his chest. The Great Hall was rather quieter than usual, as everyone’s eyes were trained on the wayward Slytherin. Ron puffed up his chest indignantly and made a beeline for Malfoy as Harry was still rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
“Not really.” The other students were beginning to stare, so Harry hastily whispered. “Come on, I’ll tell you back in our room.”
Macarons were different from any other biscuits he’d ever had, but they were fascinating in their strangeness. Harry was pleasantly surprised that a few of the macarons were treacle tart flavored. Perhaps Malfoy knew him better than he’d care to admit.
Potter seemed unfazed and only snuggled deeper into his thick jacket and woolly scarf. He followed as Draco began to stroll toward his flat. “I know. You don’t live at the manor anymore then?”
So Harry had taken to sitting with Seamus in most classes. His phoenix inheritance gave off too much warmth for other students to be comfortable, but Harry craved it. History of Magic was as boring as ever, but at least Harry could be warm for once. In one particularly boring class, Harry became so comfortable he didn’t even notice as his head nodded closer and closer to the fire wreathing Seamus’s wrists. Until his hair caught on fire.
The immense kitchen before them was larger than Harry had ever seen, even larger than the one the army of house elves inhabited at Hogwarts. Dark wooden cupboards lined two walls, and a large range and three ovens filled the rest. A fireplace large enough to roast an ox loomed at the end of the room.
Harry could hear the smug satisfaction in Malfoy’s voice, and he loathed it. He jerked away from Malfoy’s warm embrace, and turned to glare at him. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Shut up, Malfoy.”
Moving sounded like a bit too much work for Harry (even coming downstairs had made his head swim unpleasantly), so he stayed where he was in front of the common room fireplace. Sleep overtook him, until a rustle roused him a few hours later. The fire had burned low, and the dim light it threw off detailed a tall figure stepping through the portrait hole. Harry considered going back to sleep, figuring it was just another eighth year returning early, but then a shaft of firelight illuminated shining white-blond hair.
A pimply teenager in a neon orange shirt greeted him as he approached the counter. “Welcome to Spideys, how can I help you?”
Judging by past experience, Harry did know, but he still laughed as he walked away. His suspicion of Malfoy’s soft side was confirmed when the man returned with a literal flower crown. Deep green leaves surrounded lemony yellow blossoms, and it all smelled heady and sweet.
Harry had had quite enough and lobbed a flowery blue cotton apron in the blond’s general direction. “Shove it. Put on an apron, you can be my helper.”
Malfoy began unbuckling his trousers. The man seemed to enjoy the sound; he shivered in anticipation. Harry inched forward, needing to see, and the creak of a floorboard betrayed his position. Malfoy couldn’t see Harry from where he stood, but his head snapped toward the doorway. He stared at the door with dark and dangerous eyes, resembling an avenging angel.
They stood, paid the check (Draco wanted to split the bill, but Potter was too quick), and made their apologies to the server on their way out of the restaurant.
Much as he wanted to stay, Harry knew too well how creative Malfoy could be with hexes, even when he was otherwise occupied. Harry slipped out of Luxe, unable to fathom what he’d seen.
The enclosed bracelet resembled a slender silver dragon made to coil about one’s forearm. The Malfoy crest, etched into a faceted emerald, nestled gently in its tail. Harry rolled up his shirt sleeve and tried on the bracelet, which magically adjusted to fit him perfectly. He admired how the silver gleamed against his tanned skin. He wasn’t much for jewelry, but this he could get used to.
“Well? How’d it go, mate?” Ron asked, putting away his wizard’s chess set. He must have beaten Dean soundly again, judging by the state of the black pieces.
Ron was right behind her, wiping his hands on a tea towel. “Welcome back, mate!” He grinned and bundled Harry into a hug as soon as Hermione was done.
“Good luck, Harry. We’re happy for you.” Ron was still motionless, so she elbowed him hard in the side. "
Gazing at him was as ruinous as trying to stare at the sun. It burned Harry to look, but it would harm him even more to look away.
is not a house, Potter, and does not care to be referred to as such. To answer your question, I’m uncertain how long the manor has been sentient, but I first noticed its
“I know what I saw, Ron. Malfoy’s definitely the Beater, at least sometimes. The big bloke he was with was an absolute mess. But in the best way...” Harry trailed off as he recalled the animation in Malfoy’s face. He had been strong and punishing and relentlessly alive.
A frustrated Harry raked one hand through his unruly hair. Stupid Malfoy, ruining everything! The halls would be full of students rushing to lunch shortly. He knew he couldn’t avoid this conversation with his former friend forever. But if he was forced to have it, it certainly wouldn’t take place in front of the entire student body. “Fine. Outside, now.”
Harry groaned inwardly, staring at the towering pile of fabric. He begrudginly shucked off his many layers and got to it.
Harry was surprised when Draco didn’t come down for breakfast the next morning. Yes, they’d fought, but he still had to eat. And it was sausage day: Draco’s favorite. Maybe he’d just gone to the kitchens instead?
“Right, yeah. So, how long has the house been sentient?” A loud pop in the fireplace startled Harry, and the floorboards creaked ominously.
Harry’s blood ran cold. His trust in Draco was still new and fragile, and he prayed the other boy wouldn’t do anything to destroy it again. “Really.”
“Hold off, mate,” Ron whispered to Harry after he’d raised his hand for the fifth time. “He’s starting to twitch. ‘S not a good sign.”
“Now, where were we? C’mere, Malfoy,” Harry teased, plopping down on the couch and pulling Draco’s lean body down on top of him.
To be fair, it’s not even Malfoy himself that vexes Harry; Malfoy had been a git in school, but he’d seemed alright in the years since. It’s just the way he lives, seemingly bragging about himself and his boy toys and his irritatingly flawless face with everything he does. It’s been happening for years now, but the trouble really started when Malfoy opened a boutique in Diagon Alley.
Once Draco had been dragged to the dance floor, he didn’t seem to want to leave. Harry felt confident enough when a waltz started up, but as the music morphed, Draco led him through a dizzying array of different dances. Firm hands and strong arms corrected his every misstep. Harry even started enjoying himself a few songs in, buoyed by the happiness sharpening Draco’s every move. He laughed out loud once, his face blithe and carefree. Harry adored him.
It was a sight that should have had Harry in stitches, but he was far too busy brooding. The last few weeks of stalking observing Malfoy had been absolutely fruitless. It seemed that over the summer, Draco Malfoy had abandoned his wicked ways and become a normal Hogwarts student. He wasn’t skulking about the corridors or slipping off to the Room of Requirement to do anything nefarious. His group of friends no longer bullied the younger children or hexed the Gryffindors in the corridors. Malfoy was excelling in each of his classes, and had won an inordinate amount of house points in Charms class last week, despite Flitwick being no fan of his. Harry had even seen Malfoy help up a crying first year who had tripped and give her his handkerchief. When she had stopped crying, he had taken her book bag and escorted her to class, smiling all the way. Suffice it to say, Harry was stumped.
I know your hair is consistently ridiculous, but how does it always manage to look like you’ve just been thoroughly shagged? Also, what is a thirst trap?
"Not spin the bottle again, Pans,” Blaise interjected. “Surely we did enough of that in eighth year. We’re not at Hogwarts anymore.”
again. Irritation washed through him and rankled under his skin, like an itch he couldn’t scratch. Not that Malfoys ever scratched, of course; it was unbecoming. Draco crumpled the letter and threw it aside.
He was mostly right. Harry squeaked by with passable NEWTS scores and packed his trunk right away. After Hogwarts, he explored abandoned wizarding castles in Ireland, debated the possibilities of sentient houseboats in Norway, and almost died investigating a ferocious villa in Spain. (The problem turned out to be a bloodthirsty ghost, rather than the house having gained consciousness. Harry was very glad to leave that case in someone else’s more capable hands.)
Ron guffawed, his pint glass clinking back onto the table as he was surprised into good humor. “No, but we still talk about this bracelet every bloody week. Think about when ‘Mione and I broke up eighth year: it was awful for a few weeks, but then we talked about it and felt a lot better. Closure and all. Maybe it would actually stay away if you returned it to the ferret in person?”
Yes, very funny. Taking advantage of what my five-year-old said to get one over on me? I hate when people say things they don’t mean. Fuck you.
Obviously the song hadn’t been written by a wizard, and Potter tripped a bit over the changed lyrics. Hermione clapped encouragingly, elbowing Blaise into helping.
Malfoy grasped his bouquet tightly, and they stepped through the door into an empty room. Honey-colored wood floors glowed, and the crystal chandelier above threw handfuls of rainbows through the room. Oddly enough, the sunbaked view visible through the room’s many windows was definitely nowhere near Wiltshire. Gnarled olive trees guarded stands of lavender, and a craggy cliff fell to a blue, blue sea.
“My French is really only conversational,” Hermione rolled her eyes, obviously irked by this fact, “so I wrote to Fleur and asked her for words that sounded like
One corner of Draco’s long robe slid from his shoulder as he padded to the center of the room and turned his back to his audience. Harry could already feel himself getting hard. Draco knew exactly what those stockings would do to him. Tease. Harry settled back in his chair, determined to enjoy it.
Draco took a deep breath before he replied. “I suppose you finally learned to do some research without Granger’s help. Very well. What boon would you ask of me?”
“Finally,” Draco hummed, already half-asleep as Harry pulled the four-poster’s curtains shut. His hair glowed silver pure white in a lone shaft of moonlight. Harry smiled at the sight.
“Uh, bye,” Harry tossed over his shoulder as he practically ran back to the other Gryffindors. He personally never wanted to speak of this moment ever again. Neither did Ron, judging by the oddly green cast of his skin, but Hermione had other ideas.
Malfoy looked unusually shaken and responded with less than his usual venom. “Stuff it, Weasley. The wizarding world’s bloody Saviour just collapsed in the middle of the Great Hall, anyone would be concerned.” He dropped his arms and stood, but remained on the wrong side of the hall.
Harry shrugged. “I’d probably fuck up any fancy pastries, but Molly Weasley’s a dab hand at biscuits and some of it rubbed off. So biscuits it is. Pass me the butter, yeah?”
Emerging from his reverie, Harry noticed a dusty old ruby brooch next to the pocket watch in his top drawer. Ornate golden filigree surrounded a ruby the size of a hen’s egg. Some kind of crest was carved into the large gem, but it was too worn away for Harry to recognize. Had the brooch always been there? Harry couldn’t recall, but figured it was probably some Black family heirloom that Kreacher was trying to hide in plain sight. He sighed and tucked it into the pocket of his jacket. Perhaps he could deposit it at Gringotts or unload it on some jeweler.
Luminous grey eyes studied Harry, making him feel rather like a mouse about to be consumed whole by a snake. It was not a feeling that he entirely disliked.
“Must you? Well, if the Golden Boy calls.” Pansy groaned theatrically, but followed Harry outside the Great Hall all the same.
The taste itself wasn’t so bad, just a bit earthy, but trying to chew with the fuzz tickling his tongue was positively repulsive. Bile rose in Harry’s throat as he debated trying to swallow or spitting out the disgusting, hairy goop infesting his mouth.
Unfortunately, Malfoy had followed after all. He stood uncomfortably close, and tension prickled along Harry’s bones. He had promised not to touch Harry, but he knew now he couldn’t trust Malfoy as far as he could throw him. Harry took a deep breath and turned around to face Malfoy, still glaring for all he was worth.
The Malfoy conservatory was Narcissa Malfoy’s territory, a kingdom over which she alone held utter sway. Even her lord and husband had only ever been a guest within its walls and under its boughs. Narcissa had taken possession of it upon her marriage into the family and made it a dangerous paradise. She had spent so many hours in the conservatory that its walls were imbued with her presence. Each plant, from the greenest blossom to the thickest vine, whispered of her magic.
is it now?"  Blaise's smile now put Draco in mind of a predatory shark.  "Should I start writing my Best Man's speech?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes.  "Don't beg.  It's not becoming."  Then he held out his hand in which was a slim blue volume.  "Here."
"Would you listen to yourself?"Pansy demanded.  "You sound like you're planning to buy a horse, not marry the love of your life."
“No,” Hermione answered, and Anthony quickly closed his mouth.  “We can’t stay for long; we’re off for lunch with my parents.”
Harry gave a sheepish grin.  "Probably not," he admitted, and then promptly began steering Draco to the edge of the dance floor.
Draco had never thought of himself as much of a cuddler – he far preferred the freedom and space of his own bed to the claustrophobic embrace of any of his previous partners.
Draco’s smile widened a little, but looked no more genuine.  “Your dance card certainly seems to be full.”
"And now?" Harry knows the answer, can barely force the words past the lump in his throat, but he needs to hear this.
"Thank you for that." He rubbed his face wearily with one hand.  "She'll be hell to work with for days now.  And if she tells my mother, then —"
The mattress shifted and suddenly Harry felt Ginny's arm around him and her head on his shoulder.  "You can't keep using that as an excuse for everything," she said, her voice gentle but firm.  She reached out with her free hand and took hold of Harry's right one.  "Look, Harry, I don't care if you're gay, bi, or even if you've got a touch of the Aberforths—"
"Nice try, Potter."  Snape crossed his arms and smirked.  "I'm quite happy down here where I can keep an eye on your comings and goings."
"It's fine," he says, more from a need to hear the words out loud, than out of any hope he'll convince her.
"You follow them, then?" Harry made a note to tell Ron that he and Draco rooted for the same team. That would be fun.
Harry follows for a moment before his pride catches up and reminds him he should at least offer a token protest.  "Where are we going?" he demands, even as he continues to follow.
Instead, he shifted the box securely into both hands and negotiated the snowy path around the side of the house.
Apparently satisfied that both his point was made and his coffee appreciated, Malfoy turned his attention back to his designs. Hermione was a suitably impressed audience and made noises of approval in all the right places. Harry smiled to himself at the thought of what Ron would say if he could see them now. Of course, Ron was probably enjoying the peace and quiet of his nice, Malfoy-free flat. Harry leant back in his chair and stretched his legs out comfortably under the tale. "So, what
Draco's eyes widen as they look from the key to Harry's face. He steps close again and suddenly his lips are against Harry's – warm and dry and over all too quickly, but it sets Harry's heart pounding just like their first kiss had. "I love you, too" Draco murmurs, and his lips brush Harry's cheek.
one hell of a risk to take." Potter was wide-eyed and alert now.  "So what did your mum have to say about it?  Was she mad?"
Granted, Hermione's roast might not quite reach the height's of Molly's culinary feats – not that he'd ever voice this out loud – but Harry relished the opportunity to catch up with both her and Ron, who he saw far too little of now that the careers and children took priority.  Not that Harry resented Rose and Hugo – he adored both his godchildren more than he'd ever thought possible, and spoilt them rotten, much to their mother's chagrin.
Neville reaches out and takes hold of his wife's hand, his eyes only for her in that moment.  The look that passes between them is another of the type that makes Harry's chest hurt in ways both good and bad.
"The only person who thought Astoria was Draco's girlfriend was Astoria herself.  Oh, and apparently you."  Blaise shook his head slowly.  "How could you not know Draco was bent?  You must have the world's worst gaydar."
"Fine."  Blaise drained the last of his wine.  "I know when I'm not wanted."  He turned and started to walk over to the fireplace, but paused halfway.  "Talk to him, Draco.  For all our sakes."
"Boyfriend," Draco repeated with a smile, and reached out for Potter's hand again.  "If you still want to?"
"All right, we can do that."  Draco snagged a napkin off the table and, producing a pen from his pocket with a flourish, proceeded to make notes.
Draco’s smile was the tiniest bit genuine this time.  “Harry then.”   His gaze drifted to Harry’s outstretched hand.  “What are you—”
Ron continued to stare at Harry for what felt like the longest time – there was neither anger nor shock on his face; his expression was surprisingly blank.
"It's about trust," their instructor says as he assigns them into pairs.  "About building relationships with your teammates."
Draco's hands were on his waist in an instant, the grip tight as though he feared Harry might change his mind.  "I thought for a minute that you..."  He tailed off into a shaky laugh.
Harry smiled wryly – it didn't exactly take psychic abilities to locate him at one of these functions. "Hello yourself," he said, before taking another sip of his drink. "Having fun?"
"Unlikely," Harry agrees.  Neville had balked at the barest suggestion, and Harry's been in too good of a mood latelty to allow the shade of an unhappy man spoil things.  "I had to put up a Silencing Charm after the first few days.  He was starting to scare the customers."   The
“Hi Draco.” Thankfully Hannah filled the silence that Harry’s awkwardness left.  “What can I get you?”
But there was something about the combination of setting, time of year, music, and the look of sheer joy on Draco’s face that had Harry revising his previously held prejudices.
The mention of Potter's name no longer provoked the same reaction from Draco.  It hadn't for some months, not since the four-eyed git had saved his life.  Try as he might, and being Draco he certainly had, he just couldn't think of Potter with the same amount of disdain after that point.  "Don't you think we've got too much ground to make up to be worrying about having fun?" Draco shouldered his bag and looked intently at his friend.
It was fast and amazing and everything Draco had ever dared to hope it would be.  Harry was so responsive, so amazing, so
By the time Draco made it to his room, it was already lit with the soft glow from numerous candles, and Potter stood in the middle of the room, looking a little uncertain.
Harry nods.  "Thought you might be ready for a cuppa," he says cheerfully, taking all of Neville's credit.
"But you do now?" This is news to Harry. He's always thought his friends tolerated his relationship with Draco at best.
Harry snorted.  "It's going to take more than shiny, silver sprinkles to convince me," he grumbled, his arm tiring rapidly.
Underwear swiftly followed trousers, and it was all Draco could do not to come right then as his hands roamed over the curves of Harry's arse.  "Fuck," he groaned, and struggled to rein in his self-control.
Harry can.  He vividly remembers the awkward visit.  Unlike her grandmother, Martha had been painfully aware of where Harry's preferences lay, but much as they had both tried to ignore it, Mrs Morrison's matchmaking had reached outrageous proportions.
to look because he knew exactly who it was, but there’d always been a bit of a moth and flame situation between him and Malfoy.
"Because of the engagement, I think," Pansy replied, slipping into a cubicle and drawing the curtain behind her.  "Theo invited him."
"Well, now that's all sorted," Draco snapped, feeling his arousal flag dismally.  "If you don't mind?"
"I didn't mean it like that."  Malfoy raked another hand through his hair and tugged slightly.  "This is all coming out wrong.
Ron's gaze flickered towards Harry's wand, and then looked back up in time just to see Draco slide into Hermione's recently vacated seat.   "I've created a monster," he grumbled.
"Anyway, it turned out I was rather good at it, and it was fun." Malfoy's look then dared Harry to mock or to disagree. When neither was forthcoming, he gave a slight nod before carrying on. "Father always expected that I would go into the Ministry, but obviously that was no longer an option." He gave a rueful smile. "Besides, apparently I'm too 'emotional' for the political arena."
“Draaaco.”  Teddy was practically bouncing at their feet, his boredom with their conversation writ large on his face.  “You said you’d play with me.”
Ron frowned for a moment while he worked that out, and then he flushed.  "Merlin, Harry, that's disgusting.  And not because of the gay thing," he added hurriedly.  "But you're my best friend – it'd be like thinking that about one of my brothers."
“Shut the fuck up,” Draco snarled, in a low voice that never failed to remind Pansy why she once dreamt of becoming Mrs Malfoy.
There had been a couple of moments like this, where Harry was sweet and considerate and talked about them as if they were actually a couple, that Draco questioned the wisdom of their decision to live together.  He knew he needed to make a decision very soon – either tell Harry, make a move, or resign himself to being
Ron eyed the sudden silence at their table with suspicion. "You've gone very quiet," he said, settling into a vacant seat. "What were you talking about?"
“I think you’re right,” Draco said finally.  He reached for the label.  “Lemon and elderflower,” he read aloud.  “Unusual, but kind of fitting considering our bride.”
"Positive."  Harry's defensive body language was back, and it was clear from the expression on his face he wasn't happy with the conversation.
"We're off next Saturday," Ron piped up, clearly having overheard their conversation. "And the Canons are playing. We could go then. What d'you think, Pans?"
"Kreacher wouldn't let you," Harry replied, with more confidence than the expression on his elf's face told him he had a right to feel.
Blaise didn't respond to the jibe though.  He was too busy staring out of the large window onto the terrace beyond.  "Is that a table?  You're eating outside?"
"Do I look like a receptionist to you?"  She indicated her robes with a flourish of her right hand, but Draco looked pointedly at the desk she stood behind, marked
Harry shrugged. "If Ron's happy, so am I. What about you? I'd have thought you'd be the one to object if anyone."
Snape scowled.  "Tell me to mind my own business if you wish, but do not insult my intelligence with lies.  A blind man could see how things are between you and Potter."
“You should talk to him.” Harry’s expression clearly spoke volumes about this suggestion, because Hermione carried on quickly.  “I’m serious.  I think you’d actually get on if you gave him a chance.  Are you really going to let some imaginary feud ruin Luna and Neville’s wedding?”
Harry laughed breathlessly and raised one hand to push the damp strands of hair back from Draco's face.    But before he could reply, there was a soft rustling noise followed by a pointed cough.
Pansy's expression changed into one of sadness and she shook her head again.  "Draco, don't take this the wrong way, but you really need to get laid.  It's been how long? The summer after fifth year, wasn't it?  That cute French boy?"
"Well, I do."  Hermione gave Ron a rather sharp dig of her elbow.  "Draco's changed, Ron.  I've told you that." She paused then and turned to Harry, a speculative expression on her face.  "I must admit I was surprised at first, but it is a very
Thank you,  for a prompt that was such fun to work with (and that lured me in despite my protestations of
Harry felt a flare of something – irritation most likely, or possibly indigestion. He'd only been joking about Malfoy's crush, but maybe…
From the mixture of feigned outrage and amusement on Malfoy's face, Harry knew they were both thinking of last Thursday when Malfoy had come home with orange skin – the result of trusting anything George Weasley gave him to eat.
As he ushered a protesting child out of the kitchen, Harry stopped in the door way and turned round.  Draco was watching him.  "I'll be as quick as I can.  Wait for me?"
"I'm sure."  Harry stepped closer and placed one hand on Draco's upper arm.  "I told you, all I wanted was somewhere to put a nice comfy bed – and I have that now.  Plus, I got you as a bonus as well, so what's not to like?"
"You're living here?" he asked after a moment.  Though it was really more of a statement than a question, because Malfoy had just emerged from the door to upstairs.
"Honestly, you two are just as ridiculous as you were in school.  There is nothing strange going on, Draco.  Mr Potter and I have simply reached an understating.  That is all."
Today had been the best day he'd spent in a long time.  Malfoy was definitely gay, he'd obviously been thinking about Harry outside of their usual library interactions, and, arranged marriage notwithstanding, Harry felt a flicker of hope that there might one day be something more.
Harry sank down into the worn old sofa. "I hope he hasn't sent you to change my mind. It'll be a waste of your time."
The usual arrogance that Draco associated with his erstwhile rival seemed to have vanished, and in its place a surprising note of uncertainty.
Somewhere in the midst of a conversation about Harry's work and Malfoy's new business, Blaise cleared his throat loudly – as if to remind them of his presence.
Hermione reached out and placed her hand on top of his.  "Promise me you'll be civil.  I don't want him to feel uncomfortable."
Draco looked from the tickets in his hand to the slightly smug smile on his mother's face, and found himself wondering just how ill Teddy Lupin really was.
"My apologies, Mother."  Draco stepped forward and leant in to kiss her cheek.  "I was unavoidably detained on a matter of urgent business."  He'd actually met Greg in the Leaky for a swift drink after work which had promptly turned into several – but business
Malfoy stepped out of his aunt’s embrace. There was definite surprise on his face when he spotted Harry, but it vanished just as quickly as it appeared.  “Potter.”  He inclined his head in return.
chose, because sex notwithstanding, there was no one he would rather spend the rest of his life with.
“He didn’t.” Harry shook his head.  “Not really.  It’s not like he doesn’t have reason to be upset.”
Draco sat back in his chair and stared at him wordlessly for a moment.  "So what are you going to do with yourself now?"
Malfoy let out an audible sigh, and then sank into the chair opposite Harry. "Look, Potter, I realise that this is a difficult time for you. And I sympathise, really."
"Nonsense," Malfoy said briskly. "Look, I was going to leave this until last, but now that you've brought it up, it seems the right time to do it."
Malfoy sighed and drank again.  "It's not like I'm blameless though," he admitted with an honesty that Harry would have found admirable if he wasn't so outraged on his behalf.
It's a lie, of course.  Neville had mentioned it the day before.  Mentioned it with a gleam in his eyes similar to the one he'd had this morning at the sight of Harry's new jumper and smart trousers.  Subtlety has never been Harry's strong point – although, he rather suspects that the drunken confession back in their eighth year makes all his attempts at subtlety more than a little redundant.
Whatever response Harry had expected, the laugh that followed was something of a surprise.  Not least because of the bitter edge to it.  "Definitely
Malfoy owls had always been viewed more as servants, and Draco had certainly never considered his eagle owl to be a pet.  So it was with some trepidation that he reached out, intent on stroking the snowy owl's head.
The pain intensified for a moment as she leant forward, and then only an ache remained as she stepped back.
"You could always try getting one of those yourself. I thought the idea was to change career, not to give up altogether."
"Charming," Draco muttered, buttering himself another slice of toast.  "I was going to say you were welcome to join us Christmas Day, but I think I'll take it back now."
Malfoy seemed unfazed, which only annoyed Harry further. "I was just talking Hermione through my design plans.
Potter didn't reply instantly – too busy crunching dried bread.  "Maybe a third bedroom would be good though," he said after a moment.  "I could use it as a study or something?"
“Hi Hannah.” He placed his wallet on the bar and smiled in return.  “Can I get a pint of bitter, please?”  There was no way he’d make it through lunch without some liquid courage.
"Just swallow your pride and go and see Draco."  Blaise dug in his pocket and produced a small shiny square of cardboard, which he pressed into Harry's reluctant hand.  "He'll sort you out."
"You're late this morning," Malfoy commented, tearing himself away from celebrity gossip – a pleasure of his that Harry found singularly amusing and very possibly endearing at the same time, not that he would admit it out loud.
Hermione’s face reddened further.  “Then why the bloody hell didn’t he —" She cut herself off and Harry could see the level of effort it took.  Finally, she gave a small shake and let out a deep breath.  “Never mind,” she said, sounding rather more calm than Harry suspected she felt.  “I will not let his behaviour spoil my mood today.”
He was gone from the room before Harry had chance to protest that this wasn't quite the help he had in mind.
"Well, forgive me," Draco snapped, Pansy having finally raised his ire.  "But I've been a bit busy since then."
. I really don't think I'm the person for this job. Besides," she added, "I'm hardly in a position to warn him off relationships with ex-Slytherins."
"What about you?"  he asked, taking a gulp of coffee that he hoped would ease his headache.  "George got you playing guinea pig again today?"
That sounded serious and set Harry's insides squirming with the possible implications. "Okay. About what?"
"That explains you," Harry replied as he busily whisked a batch of royal icing.  "But how come I got dragged into it?  I don't even have any kids."
"Hey!" Ron protested. His pout made Harry want to laugh, but apparently Pansy found it rather endearing – if the way she leaned in closer was any indication.
Draco unclasped his cloak, slipped it off his shoulders, and then offered his mother his free arm.  "Don't worry.  I sent her home in plenty of time to prepare for this evening's festivities."
Malfoy looks pointedly at the stain on Harry's shirt, caused by a spillage of pint number three.  "Of course you can."  There's a faint smile around the edges of his lips, and Harry can't help but wonder if he really does sound fond or if it's just the beer at work again.
"I've been thinking, Potter."  Draco could hear the embarrassment in Snape's voice.  "Maybe a quiet spot in your library would be amenable after all."
"But I thought that was the general idea?  Get yourself a proper, pureblood wife, have a couple of proper, pureblood heirs, and then live...well, ever after."
"A girl can change her mind," she said, and sipped delicately at her drink.  "It was worth it for a look at Potter in those jeans if nothing else."
, it had done nothing more than reaffirm his knowledge that Draco was the only one for him - barbed remarks and all.
Ron shrugged.  “We’re both adults.  I don’t see what it’s got to do with Malfoy.”  He climbed up on a nearby stool, picked up a knife, and began to help with the sprouts.  “What’s she doing here anyway?  I thought she was off to some island somewhere with that Greek bloke of hers.”
Malfoy's gaze immediately went to the wall, covered in a myriad of brightly coloured paint patches, haphazardly dashed on the wall by Hermione in a vain attempt to kick-start Harry's interest. He turned from the rainbow wall, expression pained, and an obvious question on his lips.
"What do you think?"  Draco presses the length of his body up close against Harry's, making his point perfectly clear.
Harry laughed outright this time.  "Should I be concerned about your level of interest in my sex life?"
"Seriously, I can't eat this.  Mopsy, our old house-elf, makes the best stuffing ever.  It's bad enough I can't spend the day with my parents, but it just won't feel like Christmas if we have this."  He wound up with a slight pout which had a disturbing effect on Harry's peace of mind.
A warm smile spread across Pansy's face, and for the first time Harry understood just what Ron saw in her. "Well, that's a different matter altogether," she replied, easing up off the desk. "Draco and I would be happy to join you. I'll just owl him about the change of plans."
Draco swallowed a little too quickly, such was his surprise, and choked rather forcefully.  After a slap on the back from Harry, Draco turned to him with a faint smile. "I might just take you up on that offer this weekend," he said. "They're always worse then.  It's like someone slipped them a Love Potion."
"Well, the time for thinking is over. Now it's time for you to leave." Malfoy gestured at the fireplace with a flourish.
"For one, it's a Monday night.  I have work tomorrow, and I remember all too well what your idea of a
"Hey!"  Ron looked like he couldn't decide if he should be offended or not, but he wasn't Molly Weasley's son for nothing. "Stop dicking about and get the table laid, Malfoy, or Harry gets your portion."
"Not sure about friends, exactly," Neville replied. "But he puts a fair bit of work my way, and we get on all right."
Harry slumped, defeated, into an available chair. "How the hell am I meant to live in this building site?"
His feet felt like lead as he walked up the steps. Harry faced the front door and took deep breaths to settle himself. Before he could reach for the handle, the door swung open and Malfoy was on the other side – clearly waiting for him.
For once the lure of photography had failed him today. The hours until the specified time he was allowed to return home had dragged unbearably. But they were over now, and with his nerves very much on edge, Harry made his way home.
“Where were you?”  Teddy’s arms rose up and Harry complied instantly.  He settled the small boy on one hip.
But on closer inspection, she appeared to be flicking through the pages without any real attention to the words marked upon them.  Harry couldn't help but smile – it wasn't often Hermione was that rattled; even the Horcrux hunt didn't distract her from her beloved books for long.
Harry choked on his lager and forced himself to bite back several rather revealing remarks on the subject of people playing hard to get.
“You heard correct.” Malfoy began rolling up his sleeves before helping Teddy unload the wooden track from the chest. “I think I’d like the red engine today.” He reached into the chest and pulled out a bright red engine that reminded Harry, with a pang, of the Hogwarts’ Express.
"But I could. I want to." And Harry realised as he said it just how true that was. "If you'll let me."
"Taking a well-earned break," Blaise replied.  "Pansy's gone to powder her nose, so I thought I'd drop by and say hello."  He patted his hand on Harry's shoulder again – a bit more gently this time.  "Had a feeling I'd find you here."
Harry had barely filled his mug from the waiting pot before the door opened and Malfoy appeared.  Any awkwardness Harry had been expecting was stalled in its tracks by the sight of a livid bruise on the pale skin of Malfoy's jaw.  Without thinking, Harry reached out to touch it gently.
Abandoning the towel amongst the other clutter on his bedroom floor, Harry snatched up a t-shirt off the bed. "No, it's fine. I'll go down and see them."
for me," he said promptly, as Pansy stepped up to his side.  "These are for Mother, and this is for Aunt Andromeda."
Malfoy sounded sincere so Harry decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. "Okay," he said, and dropped his arms from their defensive position. "You might want to work on those helping skills, though. They're not what you'd call your strong point."
Harry turned round to see Draco, one arm struggling to keep Pansy upright, while the other fumbled to open the door.  He looked back at his friends.  “I’d better go,” he said ruefully.  “I’ll see you two on Wednesday.”
"And what?"  Harry stirred sugar into his tea, more from a desire for something to do than a need for sweetness.
Hannah raised her hands in a placating gesture.  “Sorry, it’s just... I remember you two at school, and you’re not exactly mates now, are you?”
could appreciate the picture it made, brightly lit against the dark city sky, the lights of the surrounding Christmas trees twinkling merrily.
"Ah, but would Malfoy, that's the question," Ginny asked, with scant regard for her brother's question.  "Because we already know
"Why would they?"  Draco's heart sank as he recognised the cold voice.  "Not everyone is ashamed of who they are, Malfoy."
"She said no?" There was just a hint of surprise in her tone that caught Harry's attention. Ron, however, was too wrapped up in his misery to notice.
Ginny looks beautiful. She always has, to Harry. The end of their relationship hasn't altered that. And if there's sometimes a bittersweet feeling in his chest as he watches her in Neville's arms, when he faces the future that could have been his, if only he'd allowed it to be enough, there's no bitterness or jealousy there. Ginny's found the hero she deserves, the man Harry could never be for her, and he's content with that. He could never have relinquished her to a lesser man.
Harry smiled to himself – Ron certainly had his hands full with that one.  He turned then to leave the Great Hall.  There was no sign of either his appetite or Malfoy, so there was really no point remaining.
The Slytherin didn’t react at all, but kept running through halls and up moving staircases until they reached an abandoned classroom. One flick of his wand locked the door, and another silenced the room to anyone who might dare to listen. He finally let Harry down from his shoulder, only to force him back against the wall. Intricate silver markings flared around Malfoy’s eyes as he crowded into Harry’s space. Shaking hands gripped Harry’s wrists, holding him firmly in place against the rough stone at his back.
style?" she asked skeptically, squinting up at the menu board behind the counter and tapping her chin with her wand.
Honestly, Harry didn’t mind at all. Out of all the houses he’d ever studied, none of them were quite as active or playful as this one. It seemed to be telling the story of itself with Malfoy, with the lights growing brighter at the bits it liked, and the whole room shaking when he told the story of the bloke being pitched out the window.
Please don’t worry about Scorp’s behavior. You must’ve read by now that I like both blokes and birds myself; the
Harry shook his head, starting down Diagon Alley again with renewed pep in his step. “Merlin, I must be mad," he muttered. "A date it is, then. But I’m definitely not trying one of those fried spideys
“Do you have your gloves? A hat?” Draco inquired as he tied Harry’s scarf for him. Draco had insisted he was perfectly fine in just his wool overcoat, but he’d bundled Harry in so many layers that he felt like a marshmallow man.
Before he could decide if Malfoy was taking the piss or not, a mountain of a man emerged from the door behind Malfoy. Harry really tried not to gawk, but this man looked like he could snap someone in half like a bowtruckle without a second thought.
Even just stepping inside the Three Broomsticks that evening helped Harry breathe more easily. He’d always associate the pub with warm memories of Hogwarts, and the additional freedom he experienced as an adult made it one of his favorite places. It was bustling tonight, redolent of sweet butterbeer and British pub standards. Steak and kidney pie, fish and chips, Welsh rarebit...Harry’s stomach rumbled and he suddenly felt far more motivated to search for his friends and order.
"Because you're you, of course. And we had discussed the possibility of a picnic. The weather's perfect for one, isn't it?"
Harry shook his head and stared at the hanks of yarn before him. Burnt umber, peacock blue, ash grey, pewter grey, fog grey… Grey, grey, grey. Just like Malfoy’s eyes. Not even pacing was enough to settle Harry’s mind anymore. Harry raked a hand through his hair and decided to go apologize to Malfoy. They did work across from each other now, and they weren’t school rivals anymore; they should keep a good working relationship.
could’ve told him that. Know anything about the meaning? Maybe the meaning is it’s all a joke,” Harry grumbled.
“Oi, keep that to yourself, eh? We’re in public, Draco,” Harry whispered softly into Draco’s ear before batting his hand away. His head was down on the table,
Luna was just flipping through the song book, wondering aloud which folk songs nifflers would like best, when Pansy snapped. She had had enough.
“An order of chips and a couple of pints, please,” Harry called out to Madam Rosmerta behind the bar. She nodded and bustled back to the kitchen, honey-colored curls bobbing along. Mere moments later, two sweating glass mugs and a plate of chips with the perfect amount of vinegar clattered onto the worn wooden table.
His mouth pulled and tugged at Harry’s own, biting his lower lip so harshly that it made him gasp. A foreign tongue took advantage of that and thrust inside Harry’s mouth, hot and demanding. He tasted iron and blood and lemon. His head spun with befuddlement, but it still felt far better than any other kiss he’d ever had.
“No. I adore Mother, but we each prefer having our own space. And living in London is much more convenient for working at the shop.”
At least Hermione was cheerful. She had already knitted her fourth hat in as many days, and was very excited about some new exercise trend called zumba (zumbo? For the life of him, Harry couldn’t remember. It certainly wasn’t anything Aunt Petunia had practiced).
Seamus waggled his eyebrows suggestively and Dean elbowed him in the side. “Shut it, Seamus. Anyway, Harry, when two men love each other very much…”
“Students, this painting is the entrance to your common room. Her name is Eirene. The password for this year will be ‘lotus blossom.’ Can anyone tell me the significance of this choice?” Professor Vector asked. She spoke slowly and clearly, each consonant clicking gently as it slid against another.
Harry allowed himself to wallow for a few moments, then gave himself a mental shake - nothing could be worse than those lonely Christmases he had spent at the Dursleys'.
Harry rolled his eyes – she really couldn't help herself.  "Goodbye, Hermione," he said, before tossing a handful of powder into the flames.  As the crackled green, he took a deep breath, stepped into them and spoke "Malfoy Manor" with a calmness he definitely didn't feel.
“Of course it has.” Hermione patted his tummy before turning her amused gaze on Harry.  “Ron’s right, though, Harry.  You’ve barely stopped talking about Malfoy since we sat down.”
His bedroom is blessedly tidy.  Kreacher has even changed the sheets, almost as if he knew.  Malfoy looks around and Harry waits for the inevitable comments, but none come.  They undress in silence, both leaving on their underwear by unspoken agreement, and after an awkward bathroom visit that Harry will never talk about again, he finds himself in bed with Draco Malfoy.
"Hermione!"  It took a few seconds for her words to register in Harry's brain, but when they did, he found them even more disturbing from her than Ginny.
"Blaise," Draco began through clenched teeth.  "We're Slytherins.  We don't blurt out our feelings like some first year Hufflepuff.  We plan and scheme to get what we want."
"Auror." Harry replied, like this explained everything. Truthfully he'd wheedled it out of Ron the day before, planning to casually drop round at some point over the next weekend. But now didn't seem like the right time to mention that.
sort of a shrug. "Your friends – his, yours, both of yours – we didn't. You made each other happy. What sort of shits would we be if we objected to that?"
Harry, for his part, had no idea.  All he knew was that everyone was telling him his current flat was far too small, so he said, "Bigger, I guess."  But he didn't exactly sound convinced.
"Exactly."  Blaise looked between Draco and Harry, a toothy grin on his face.  "So, to what do we owe the honour of you slumming it in our canteen?"
Harry placed a wriggling Teddy on the floor, where he swiftly made his way to his toy chest – clearly wedding talk was not for him.  Harry could sympathise.
Malfoy opened his mouth, protests clear on his face. But they never came. Apparently a sick Malfoy was a lot more pliable than a healthy one.
"They're free elves, Harry. It's fine, really. I don't understand why it's a problem for you – you have Kreacher."
"Besides," Harry continued, "People who want favours from their friends – huge favours, mind – need to start being nicer to them."
“Until now,” Draco grumbled, getting up out of his seat.  “Excuse me, I’ll just get us some more wine.”
you're doing it.  Because, and forgive me for pointing it out, but you've never exactly been known for your study habits – unless we're counting a lack thereof."
He could hear the sounds of Ron banging around in the kitchen as soon as he entered the hallway. Harry spent the short walk there willing his erection to subside – this would be an awkward enough conversation as it was, without that making an appearance.
Draco shifted uneasily, as he always did at any mention of his former friend.  They had barely spoken since the end of the war - it was as if Vince’s death had destroyed their one common bond.
Not for the first time, Harry saw exactly why the Hat had put Anthony Goldstein into Ravenclaw.  Hermione’s cooking could be described as inedible at best, but a few soothing words and gentle encouragement from her husband had her beaming like she’d just received her first Michelin star.
"Not my girlfriend." Ron's words were again muffled by food, but both Harry and Hermione had long become attuned to such impediments.
Blaise shrugged with affected nonchalance.  "You know me, any excuse to get dressed up.  Besides, the brownie points this will earn me with Pansy later are more than worth the effort."  Blaise finished up with a distinct leer which left Harry in no doubt as to his meaning.
Harry settled himself in the offered chair and gave a wry smile.  "I might have had a bit of help changing my mind."
“He always had excellent taste.”  Pansy flipped her hair back and fixed Harry with a baleful stare.  “I’m not so certain recently.”
"Feels like bloody forever, all the nattering she does about flower arrangements and wedding favours."
Ron stifled a sigh.  Despite his original smugness at having been the first (and so far only) person to discover Harry’s secret, at times like these he wished desperately that Hermione would figure it out - if only so he could shove the responsibility for Harry’s emotional turmoil onto her.  After all, he reasoned, girls were genetically better equipped to deal with this sort of thing.
"That much is obvious," Ron said, cutting Harry off again.  "And you're as bad in return.  It's obvious to everyone, apart from you two, that this thing with the portrait is more about Malfoy than it is Snape."
before.  He hoped Potter would stay, wanted it even, but Draco wasn't quite sure if he would be able to ask for it.  Fortunately, Potter had courage for both of them.
Hermione shook her head and settled her cup back in its saucer. "It was just something Blaise mentioned in passing."
"That they do," Draco agreed.  "But not that much," he added, slapping her hand.  "Put that one back."
Try as he might, Harry could not coax forth the barest hint of a memory.  He remembered leaving the pub with Ron and - Harry stilled momentarily - Felix!  He peered warily back into his bedroom but nothing in there gave any sign that he had done anything more than sleep.
Hermione snorted softly.  "They'll have an even bigger one on their hands if they let a hung-over Malfoy near the press.  God only knows what awful things he'll come out with this time."
"That's the first I heard of it," Blaise responded gruffly.  "Shortly followed by a very brief owl from my mother.  She thinks I'd be tracked by the Aurors, hence the rescinding of my Christmas invite."
If possible, Harry's cheeks burned brighter.  Which was ridiculous, really.  All of his friends knew how he lived and yet, despite their numerous comments on it, he'd never felt embarrassed before, so why it should suddenly bother him now was a mystery.  Maybe it was because of what Malfoy did for a living, or because Astoria was watching him, distaste clear on her pretty face, or maybe it was something else altogether... he just didn't know.
"She's here," Pansy replied. "She's just popped into the Wizengamot office – probably warning Draco to keep his hands off you as we speak."
"It's been almost three months since she was here last."  Mrs Morrison digs deep in a jewelled bag before extracting her purse.  "Can you believe it?"
Ron, Neville, and Dean all nodded along in agreement, and everyone’s expression said they had a better idea of what this was about than Harry did.
“I’m not so sure that’s a good idea,” Harry replied slowly.  “I know it’s the season of goodwill and all that, but I think it’d have to be a cold day in hell before your father sits down to dinner with Harry Potter and a Weasley.”
So he held on tighter with one hand and speeded up their strokes with the other, and tried to pour every ounce of emotion he felt into their needy kisses.
"Oh."  Draco had lost himself for a moment admiring the figure that a dishevelled Harry Potter cut in scrubs, even if they were lime green.  "I thought we could talk houses over lunch, if you've got time."
Although he had scoffed at it, classical music was not really something with which Harry was familiar.  The Dursleys weren’t exactly cultured, for all his Aunt Petunia’s pretensions to the contrary, and it wasn’t like music figured on the curriculum at Hogwarts.
"Merlin, that smells good." Blaise leant forward, inhaling deeply.  "Don't suppose you have room for one more?"
Draco rolled his eyes, but nonetheless settled between Harry's thighs, and leant back against his chest with a contented sigh.  "Merlin, I need this after the day I've had."
As Harry feels the world start to go fuzzy around him, he realises there are worse people he could have been saddled with.
"Obviously you need to keep better tabs on your partner, Malfoy."  Harry didn't mean it to sound quite so snide, but he just couldn't help himself.
been the reaction he'd expected.  But after a few moments, he gave himself a quick shake and turned his attention back to Hermione.
"Pansy, please.  This is neither the time nor the place."  Draco cast a quick, hunted look around the room.
"Do you?"  Hermione reached out and took hold of one of his hands, effectively stilling it.  "Because you don't sound so sure."
Hermione and Malfoy had barely said their goodbyes before Ron was marching her off the platform, demands for explanations hot on his lips.
Without waiting for much in the way of response, or offering a goodbye, she turned then and began to lead Malfoy across the room.
"For normal people? Absolutely." Hermione reaches up and brushes a rogue lock of hair back off his forehead. "With you two? Merlin knows."
Harry wondered if it was possible for Hannah’s eyebrows to go any higher, and tried to ignore the stab of irritation at yet another person using his first name.  “I’m not likely to be looking for Lucius, am I?”
"It would seem that way, Potter," Pansy said casually.  "Look at it as an added incentive.  The quicker you get him hanging in his rightful place, the sooner he'll be out of your hair."  She gazed at him critically for a moment.  "Which given its current state, would not be a bad thing."
Harry glanced in the direction of the shop's window and watched the dizzying white flakes swirl wildly past.  "It's chucking it down with snow out there."
“She certainly seems to have got over her break-up rather quickly,” Harry commented, as Pansy’s throaty laugh sounded through the flat.
"Never mind her, Potter."  Draco crossed the room and took Harry's coat from his hands, hanging it on the nearby hooks. It was an entirely innocent action but one that made Harry's breath catch nonetheless. "Come rescue me."
“What the hell was that?” Draco whispered, his words almost drowned out as the banging started again.
"Harry!"  Draco pulled back from his partner, a look of visible apprehension on his face.  "Are you okay?"
Harry didn’t need to be told twice, and he let out a groan of pleasure as the rich chocolate flavour burst across his tongue.
"Okay, what did you have in mind?"  Draco produced two bottles of water from the bag and handed one over.
Narcissa looked around them in silence for a moment. "It is," she agreed. "But it's only bricks and mortar." She reached out and laid one hand lightly on Harry's arm. "A person needs so much more than that to be happy, don't you think?"
"Then deal with it," Hermione replied succinctly.  "Be a man and ask him again.  It's not like you're asking him to shack up with you.  Are you?"
When Potter finally swallowed, Draco was so distracted by the bob of his Adam's apple that he nearly missed the answer.
"I'm not deaf.  Although I might be if you keep yelling in this manner."  She paused then for a moment and shifted her attention back to Harry.  "Go on," she prodded.
Harry grinned. New though he was to Indian cuisine, Draco had still insisted on matching Harry's meal for strength. Harry'd tried suggesting something milder to begin with, but it seemed the old competition between them lived on.
Hermione lets out a peal of laughter, curls dancing with the movement of her head. "You really didn't think that through, did you?"
It wasn't exactly what Harry would have called advertising, but he decided against pushing further – the least he could do was return the favour that George extended to him.  "You got time for another drink?"
around the bottle as he raised it to his lips and then found his mind conjured a number of images at the action.
"I got the password off Pansy," Malfoy admitted softly, his face peering between the red curtains on Harry's bed.
"No, no, not her."  Pansy gave a dismissive wave of her hand.  I meant Potter.  I had a most interesting conversation with the female Weasley earlier."
Ron looked like he very much disagreed, but any comment he was likely to have made was washed away by Neville's stunned declaration of
The exclamation of disgust was followed by the slamming of the door behind Astoria as she left the office.  Pansy laughed some more, clearly satisfied with her afternoon's work.  Draco was not similarly impressed.
Draco laughs.  "I imagine he's been somewhat irascible these last few weeks with no one to rant at.  I can't think that you or Neville have been paying social calls."
Hermione brandished a bottle of wine in reply. "It's too early for coffee. Besides, you always talk more with a little of this inside you."
Throughout their final years at school, Harry had always assumed that he and Ron would end up sharing a place.  But things with Ron and Hermione had escalated quicker than anyone imagined, and pretty soon the two of them were out looking for flats together, while Harry rattled around Grimmauld Place on his own.
Draco sips his tea again before humming in acknowledgment. "It looks that way.  Mother doesn't really need me now – her treatment is all but finished."
Theo began laughing merrily at this, causing Draco to look more than a little put out.  However, before Harry could enquire as to the source of this amusement, the explanation became self-evident.  The flames sparked into life once more and emitted numerous house-elves -- Malfoy ones, judging from the crest on their tea towels -- each of them carrying boxes seemingly far too large for their small stature.
“Well, if that’s that all sorted, I’ll be on my way.”  Pansy picked up her handbag from the counter.  “Oh, and Weasley, if you could manage to stop staring at my tits by the time I come back, that would be great.
Draco, who had been leaning on the worktop, shamelessly ear-wigging their conversation, let out a snort.
"There's no hurry, is there," Hermione said, much to Harry's relief. "You should take your time and make the right decision." The
Neither Harry nor Draco was able to suppress the soft snorts that escaped them in response to this comment.  However, at Hermione’s expression, Harry quickly schooled his into one of neutrality, leaving only Draco still merrily chuckling to himself.
Seizing his chance, because a Ron losing at chess was a Ron with eyes for little else, Harry muttered his excuses and headed for the door.
options, however tempted he was, Harry surfed through the channels for something suitably mind numbing.  He was spoilt for choice.
But today he had matters of business to attend to, so personal issues had to be put to one side.  Besides, work was beginning to become intolerable given Astoria's current behaviour, and if he came across one more wedding magazine
Draco took a sip of his coffee and smacked his lips contentedly.  Then he smiled at his assistant over the rim of the cup.  "No, dark, handsome heroes of the wizarding world aren't really your type, are they?"   And considering the object of Astoria's current affections was a blond ex-Death Eater, Draco thought that was rather the understatement of the year.
"Me too."  Hermione leant forward, a gleam of interest in her eyes.  "I always did wonder about you two in school."
Harry dropped his head into his hands and rubbed tiredly at his face. "I don't know what else to do. Maybe I should just—"
Ron was still there, lounging against the pillows on his bed, and groaning like a dying man about the size of his hangover – which really did nothing to soothe Harry's headache.  So he muttered a brief greeting and then headed to the bathroom.
