Water is hot down our shoulders, everything's hot. We are naked before each other for the first time.
With the back of my legs, I push the chair away and rummage over the desk for my satchel. Finding it, I turn to leave, taking a few careful steps forward. Deep down, I expect him to stop me, or at least ask where I'm going, so that I'd refuse to tell him out of spite. He doesn't. Reaching out with my hand, I find the bookshelves to my right and move along, until they end and I step out of the alcove and into the aisle. After a brief hesitation, I take the right turn and head to the exit.
"Finally, Son." He patted your shoulders lightly.
"May I touch your face?"
"What?"
I almost laughed out loud. Because, indeed, I was checking on the box during class, hiding behind a huge cauldron on the table in front of me.
"Fuck you!" I grab the folder from the desk and leave.
I never did
“Yeah, I don’t need it anyway.” I wave a hand in her direction.
"Goodbye," I wave at the unimpressed witch.
"I did not!" Romilda is playful, defiant. "But maybe Harry did?"
he writes back.
"No, you didn’t. You saved me. Again," I say, and I mean it. If not for her, I wouldn't be alive then, or free now.
"No." I will firm my grip around you. "But… we can try and find a new way to…"
"Sit... would be fine," Draco said, already heading to the sofa.
, I think,
it is.
Putting my weight on my arms, I slide carefully off the windowsill.
"Kreacher is been sorry, that Master Draco is unhappy."
He leans for a kiss and lingers… and withdraws. "I am next to you. Get up."
The kitchen door stands open. The room is lit with a soft yellow light from a lamp. There's a big chunk of cheese still wrapped in paper and a bottle of wine. The same thought strikes us both: we step into the kitchen, I grab the bottle and Potter the cheese; with his other hand, he grabs my wrist and Apparates us away.
moods. The ones I hate and try to avoid.
“Yes, I’m fine.” I reach under the desk for my satchel.
He clears his throat. "Truth."
I don't want to leave this place, but I have to. I have no business imposing on Potter's hospitality any longer.
"Do it and be done with him," someone grumbles, "or I'll do it."
Done with the spells, I dash to him and wrench at his sleeve, tugging it up to the elbow. There, on the inside of his wrist, two identical marks burn angry red against the tender skin.
'Squeak-squeak-squeak...'
I feel sick. I can't imagine all
She doesn't listen. "We are trying, Harry, all the time… You want us to behave like everything's the same! And when we do - you immediately remind us that it's not!"
I come.
"Father."
I wanted
I carry the box with me everywhere, shrunk in my pocket. Checking when no one's watching every now and then. It is so much easier without owls, it is so much more discreet. I can't imagine how one is able to create such a brilliant thing. He must be very smart, another
damned if I know how these things are properly written
Seeing him for the first time since the trials where I spoke for him and his mother, sparing them from Azkaban, I thought that he'd changed a lot. He arrived at Hogwarts with the rest of the Eighth Year. Keeping his head down, he mostly kept to himself and to Parkinson's company, who was notoriously famous as well.
One day, when I heard the door opening, I completely lost my shit. The sound was in the Entrance Hall, and for a second my heart leapt, expecting Potter... but then Dumbledore's damned

My worst enemy has become my...
"Prophet is been arrive, as always. Kreacher is must taking it away. Kreacher is been sorry Master Draco read it."
“Thanks.” A whiff of cologne, a shoulder brushing mine, a scrape of the chair as he gets himself seated.
______________________________________________________________________
"Thank you, Father," you said, and when she stared at you, you briefly shook your head. You absolutely couldn't let her say what she'd been going to.
"No, leave it," Potter says, when the damned thing is already stuck over my face, "no problem."
"No, it's fine—" I pull away. "I need a drink."
"Yeah. I thought I did, too." Weasley gave out a bitter laugh.
- the way he put it - like she never kissed him before. This whole thing about Potter kissing embarrasses me. Not kissing, but
I am about to shout out, to call for him, but his name dies on my lips, because someone appears from the right, from the passage that opens there.
, he doesn't even give me a chance to spit my reply back; he turns his broom around with a flourish and soars high and away from me. Fucker.
“I don’t know,” Hermione replies, “it’s hardly forbidden to attend the party, and most likely Daphne invited her sister.”
And I do, rocking above and inside him. His hand is moving over his cock between us.
"No?" I shrug, biting into my toast.
I hope off the broom a bit to the side of the others, already feeling people's eyes on me. I grip the handle for support, remaining on the spot among the receding crowd. Everyone knows why I am here, and what I am waiting for. No one calls me or says anything. Even Ron. Throwing me a worried glance, he follows the others to the edge of the field. People gather in circle around the pitch. I see Hermione next to Ron; I see Seamus and Dean and Neville, pressing his fist to his mouth. Ginny shakes her head, taking Ron by the arm at his other side.
Now, Malfoy is the one talking some sense, which is crazy.
“Stand up.”
"He knocked you out and made it appear as though you were dead," Potter continues.
I stop dead.
"And do remember, Draco, no matter what, no matter what your Father has done... You will always remain a Black.
"Angry... bewildered. Searching everywhere. You know your Father..."
"Yes, you are right. It's better if she thinks I'm dead." He wipes his eyes with his palm.
My heart leaps, even before I understand his words.
"Because that's what you do. You’ve never tolerated injustice." Parkinson raised her chin.
Only a half an hour ago, I had a
He most certainly hadn’t meant any of that, but I feel sick all the same and can't shake it off. I don't think I'll ever be able to let another man touch me. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to not recoil. This is why everything's wrong about being gay for me. That's what he doesn't understand.
Severus, however, knows better than to step into my arms. He stops a few paces away and bows low. "My Lord."
"Sort of," I shrug.
he says,
Why the fuck is he always
He falls on the body, clinging, clutching at the man, stroking his hair.
"Jaime." One of them offered his hand. I didn't take it. It hovered in the air and finally dropped.
It should be awkward, but it's not. Not at all, I've long since ceased caring. After everything that has happened, I couldn't care less.
"I refused," Malfoy says to the ceiling.
"Where's-" I manage, and Dreamless Sleep grips me.
"Potter, this is Jaime, Natasha." You pointed at the woman with a pettiness in your tone that made me want to strangle you. "Alex, Tom, Johnathan - my coworkers. And this is Caleb." You finally nodded at the tall man.
"I'm not talking about today, Ron... though that, too. He healed me after Nagini bit me in Bathilda Bagshot's house."
I nod and let him.
"Get off me!" I bat his hand away. "What the actual fuck? Why am I here?"
again and again, filling me to the brim. His face contorts as he looks down at me. It's not him... Well, it is, but it's not. He is not himself. I am suddenly scared.
"Are you
Draco," he says as we approach. "
My heart is hammering. Why is he here? I want to hit him and kiss him and demand an explanation. But first, to hit him.
"Wow!" I don't know who's speaking, but it's not Astoria. "Now, tell us, who is it?"
"They've told me about Fred," I whisper. "Gin..."
Because finally, when he's here, I almost cringe in pain at how I missed him. I don't know what I'm going to do when he leaves.
Someone is weeping, their sobs loud in the silent Great Hall. My vision blurs, and I realise that someone is me.
welcome home."
"No," I stop his hand. "I'm good."
Potter stands up and walks to the water.
The one that makes me sick
I flop on my bed and close my eyes. Why is it always my wretched luck? Once I walked in on Blaise sucking off Theo Nott. Last Christmas when I stayed at Hogwarts. They were experimenting, Blaise told me later.
She rises on her feet. "Severus Snape secretly made an Unbreakable Vow. He promised help and protection to Draco, lest he failed in the task you gave him, My Lord."
the Horcrux-Harry hisses.
I'm fed up. Fed up with him being so reasonable, so understanding, so kind, patient,
"Are you a wizard or not?"
My gaze stops at the photographs on the mantel. I prop myself on my elbow. These are unmoving pictures from your Muggle camera. A glimpse of a movement makes me flinch.
You turn and see Henry's mousy, livid face.
There's
In the middle of August, the Ministry officer arrived to offer me a choice of probation terms. Either way, it had to be a public work for free in my spare time after classes. Between cleaning streets, a nurse position in St. Mungo's or brewing simple potions for them - what do you think I chose?"
"You could've told me, yeah?" I make a face at him, beginning to stir the spoon anti-clockwise. "How long?"
I stare.
"It's your friends. Your
"Run!" Weasley shouts and the three of them break into a run.
— It's good we cannot change the past.
"That's not--" It sounded weak. I knew I couldn't deny the truth in your words, and you knew that I knew.
I approach and put the paper bag I've brought on the bedside table. He doesn't pay any attention.
"You need to let Death Eaters inside Hogwarts, as is required of you, and leave the rest to me," he said.
He's right.
You must admit, you're having a good time. You always liked dancing, always were good at it, and you do have all the classic ballroom techniques up your sleeve. So when you swirl Ivy effortlessly, she laughs - she's enjoying it, too - and it makes you feel good for the first time in ages.
I am scared, but not afraid. It's not that. With him, I'm not afraid. It's just... I'm scared. I've never done this before. That's all.
"I'd figured when you told us about the boxes."
"Where's the lie, Snape?" Bellatrix pokes him in the chest. "You can't break an Unbreakable Vow."
______________________________________________________________________
"Yes. Dobby is happy to help his friend Harry Potter!"
“Don’t you?” I whisper back.
Noir-Malfoy is grinding on me, sitting astride, and any moment I'm about to...
He sits down next to me and peers at my drawing. And I swallow as his shoulder brushes mine. My pulse is hammering in my temples. I need to breathe.
"Good," he whispers. "Mother and I. No one else."
giddy with the smell that’s his perfume and also
The retreat of his angry footsteps echo off the walls until the door further down the corridor is wrenched open and slammed shut.
Quickly!"
"Nothing. I'm sick of it, you have no idea…" I lean forward on my hands on the desk. "I don't need help or pity, least of all yours. Everyone has been feeding me that bullshit, and now
His hands try to reach my throat, I bat them away. He grips my wrist and reaches under the collar of my T-shirt, tugging,
I take a step forward to take a closer look.
"Invisibility Cloak," Potter says, and steps closer.
Dancing is strongly encouraged here for your 'healing process.’ Waltz and Foxtrot. Nothing indecent. No Tango,
"You know what--... Fuck you!"
Where is?...
"May I?" He's still careful, he's still asking.
Sometimes I see Weasley's sister and can't help but stare. Can't help studying her features, her manners, every expression on her face; the way she talks, the way she tosses her hair, her laugh, her frown, and her disdain when she catches me watching. All this - the whole
Potter grabs the bottle and a glass, pouring generously and handing it to Granger. She gives him a grim look.
"Here." I give it to Potter. I don't know... Okay... If he laughs, then he laughs.
I imagine Malfoy soaping himself up with the tiny soap bar from the crate in the Quidditch locker room showers. Sudsy rivulets slide over his nipples, making a path in the middle of his chest, down his stomach, over his tiny navel, to finally gather in the coarse hair at the base of his cock. He is hard, he smears the lather along his length. And repeats. I think he's washing himself, but no… his palm is sliding back and forth in a different rhythm. Bracing his other hand against the wall, he thrusts into his fist, making the swollen head meet the resistance of his curled thumb, breaching it each time and withdrawing, to repeat the torture over and over again. I stare. I want to take the tip into my mouth. To let him thrust between my lips, to make a firm 'O' of my mouth into a perfect path for his pleasure. Under the steady strokes of his hand, water is washing the soap off. I want to press my tongue to the pulse point on his rigid neck. I want to slide my arm around his waist, nestling my erection between his buttocks, and take him in my own hand. To touch him and
Without a word, he approaches my sleeping bag and slips inside, pressing himself whole against me.
, caressing, opening up under someone's kiss, kissing back, back, back, letting tongues slide together
Making sure that Ron wasn’t looking, I lifted the lid of the box to see a note.
"Dumbledore..." His voice is barely a whisper, and he must be grateful that Bellatrix doesn't see his face.
He looks ridiculous.
“What are they doing here?” I bristle. “They’re not in our year. They’re not supposed to be here.” I take a sip from my glass.
"What do I...?" I choked on my anger. "None of my
Nothing.
"How it feels to whom?" I would raise my eyebrows.
I realise all this time I've been waiting for his return. And now I'm alive again.
"Harry-" Weasley began.
I closed my eyes, remembering our first time so vividly in that very room: I apparated us from the middle of the dance floor, right onto my bed. You called me a show-off, already ripping my shirt away. I didn't argue. I wrenched at your belt, making you topple over, vanishing our clothes.
"I think we should go back. The sun is too hot."
"Theo, come
“My eye--”
He writhed beneath me and wrapped his legs around my back. "Just..." He gripped my hand. "Go on."
"Oh…" I shrugged, fiddling with my quill. "They say she fancies you." I couldn't resist adding.
So this is what it was. He didn't merely
"You alright? You'd better sit down." Gin says.
But what's the difference in the end? Either way, he is dead and nothing will bring him back.
"Oh, shut up." You turned your back to me, hogging the blanket. "Let me sleep."
"But you
Desperate, I reach for the coin in my pocket, but it's cold and useless and slips through my fingers onto the stone floor. Fear grips me.
Until I’m spent. And numb.
"You don't need to—" she faltered and shook her head. “I just wanted to know who—whom he was seeing, I—” She winced but held your haze. “I needed to find out and… I did.”
With the immense effort of my will, I turn around. I know. I
," he utters, and in the moonlight I see that he winces.
"Really?" He smiles. "Great. Tonight, eight o'clock. Okay?"
She doesn't change in the face, only barely raises her eyebrows and nods. "All right."
At some point I'd felt relief - no longer having to wait. No more anxiety and failed expectations if I don't expect anything in the first place.
"Yes, ma'am." I head in the direction of the Common Room, feeling her gaze on my back until the corridor takes a turn.
"Yes, I need it. And a parchment, please. Now."
a better person
"Who is this, Draco?" Mother turns to me, and now I have no choice but to finally look at Harry.
Granger knows shit. She does.
painted with a shimmering silvery stuff. It’s glittering, reflecting lights every time he moves his head. It forms a stars pattern across his forehead, around his right eye, snaking down along the neck and chest to disappear beneath the shirt. I don't know how the Draco Constellation looks, but this must be it.
she begins,
"What are you doing?!" I shout down at them. "You'll topple it, get down!"
"What happened... before the Great Hall?” I ask. I must know. “Before Hagrid brought him in? I mean... the Dar-... the Dark Lord thought Harry was dead."
I am wildly anxious to put it like this, but we've reached the point where nothing but honesty can work.
“Do you always wash with your pants on?” He asks.
Mr. Vice nods in encouragement. "We love you, Henry!" He waves at the group.
There's understanding and a bit of pity. Everyone knows about Noir. Everyone read his name splattered across the Prophet.
"They told me..." She sobs, digging her fingers into my back. "They said..."
"The what?"
“Kreacher!” I call, storming out of the loo. “Bring me clothes and take these ones away.” I gesture vaguely around the room as the elf pops by my side.
Peering into my face in the dark, he doesn't reply.
“But not with your eyes closed.”
Slowly, I turn my head to peer over my shoulder. The figure in the bathrobe is looming mere feet away.
The second one
Still in his shirt, he is fiddling with the cuff of his sleeve. There's tension to his quiet posture and all the uncertainty in the world.
She probably should be. She shouldn't be so careless. She never thinks he is able to harm her. And that's where she's mistaken. She cares for her family. But Father cares for
"Hi."
My heart sinks.
— I'd need to change
"I should have, I'm sorry," I replied, watching the Hufflepuff team practice; it was easier not to meet her eyes.
"You'll tell Dumbledore, and...
He waves at the Death Eaters behind him and the mob cheers. His face stony, my Father claps his hands several times. My Mother beside him doesn't pay any attention, her eyes never ceasing to roam over our side... until she spots me and flinches, grabs my Father's arm and leans in to whisper into his ear.
Newly.
"But... I don't know... maybe you're right," Potter says, "but would it help her if Lucius just shut you up again where she wouldn't be able to find you? I think that's what he will do this time, as soon as you set your foot outside. Without magic you can do nothing against him. You may end up in some mental facility abroad."
" He throws his hands in the air. "It's a problem only for prejudiced bigots like your father."
"You may speak, Bella." I gesture to her to come forward.
"You're not Zabini, and I shouldn't have said that."
I catch him by the arm at the entrance, right in the open double doorway.
My heart skips. "What?"
never still. I kiss his shoulder and rest my forehead on his nape, moving,
"Thank you." Your voice is quiet, heavy with something I wish I dared hope for.
Fuck. Why can't I keep my mouth shut?
Malfoy's words hit too close to home. I couldn't go on like that, and I couldn't go on without it. I sagged down against the wall and heard Hermione's steps retreating.
"What?"
she says, "the rules are simple because there's only one: whoever spins the bottle... makes out with the person the bottle points at! You begin, darling!" She taps Malfoy’s shoulder.
“I wasn't born blind, you see.” I reach for a jumper folded on the bed. “I walked them before.”
His jumper.
"Go on, tell me. I'd like to know." I reached the bed and lowered myself down on the floor against it.
“Well, it’s complicated, but - simply put - the essence of a Patronus can be turned liquid with a spell and collected, and then added into the potion at the final stage.” The clinking of glass ceases.
For the first time, we didn't fight when our bodies collided - and yet, we very much did.
The sound of the door handle turning startles you. It's almost midnight, and you haven't turned the lights on.
"For the first time?" I mumble.
You squint, not able to make out the features of the person behind it. Their hand hovers above the bedside table, reaching for the lamp. And finally, when the light switches on, you stare dumbly in the mousy face of Henry fucking Ponder. You understand nothing anymore.
... The melody is swimming in the twilight air, and the city below lights up the fading sky...
It is Friday night, and you are having a party. Nothing wild. Formal dancing and no alcohol.
I sit up.
I write, stuffing the note inside.
We are good with Gin. Fine. Mostly. Though after the war it hasn't been the same. Well, not
Appease the greedy creature in my chest
There's no reply... and I'm sure there won't be. Until in the morning before the Yule Ball, the note appears.
"Sorry." I turn to him. "I didn't... what I mean, is that
“It's a perfectly fine broom." I turn to leave, putting the broom over my shoulder. "Stop whining and come on." I nod at the pitch.
We are standing on the landing with Ron, deciding whether or not to go down and play chess on the sofa, when the door opens with a
So this is how it had begun. Self-writing quill and the spell he taught me. I listen to lectures to the steady scrape of the quill on my desk taking notes after the teachers. Later, when I want to read them, I cast the spell on the parchment and only have to slide my fingers over the lines.
Sliding off my lap, he looms over me, bending down to kiss my chest, to trace his tongue down my stomach, to press his nose into my belly and groan.
Weasley utters a horrible shriek and falls silent.
"Shut up, Potter. I don't want to know, I
Everything is red and dark.
It's been so long since I've seen his face this close.
"May I kiss you?"
You're asking from the photograph, punishing me with your smile.
The sun is bright. I lean back against the bench and close my eyes, letting the breeze caress my face and hair. It's a nice day, and I feel good. Calm, content. Nothing else is needed.
Until it's roasting over the fire, and the smell makes my mouth water and stomach ache. Turns out, Weasley can cook and knows how to pluck a bird and clean it.
Ron was right. And a liar!"
I'm so fed up with everyone dancing on eggshells around me, and with my friends most of all. It's as though they’re not them anymore. As though I’m not
"Is it a compliment?" My laugh faltered. You were so impossibly tight, I didn't know how I would last.
I stare at him. "
"I feel like shit," I say.
is there, but no. It is absolutely
"What are you going to do with him?" Granger voices my thoughts.
Later we lay, tucked into each other on the narrow sofa, our feet sticking out over its side. The buzz of voices and a stray laughter scattered around the room. No one was paying us any attention, and it felt great.
"Yeah."
Everywhere. Everyone is staring at me. My head is pounding, I feel I'm about to faint.
I kiss his neck and that vulnerable spot under his jaw, barely grazing it with my teeth. He smells of...
They left this morning. I saw them through the window, Disapparating from the front porch.
kissing me back, back,
"He's gone," Hermione says.
"Okay," I stand up, and Potter follows. Together we exit the dining room.
"Okay."
me where Harry is. "Surely he hasn't gone to give himself up... It would be madness!" I explain to her, it's essential that she understands. I must convince her that it's utter madness, and wouldn't happen, and Harry would never...
The noise around us suddenly died down.
Tonight after dinner, there was a loud burst in the alcove where I was sitting. I knew immediately what it was, I used it myself more than once. Though the knowledge didn't help me against
"In families like mine."
"He would have killed me," Dumbledore shifts against the railings.
Potter and Granger share their night vigils in turns. Weasley is ill, often running a fever, his left hand still bandaged. They don't trust
I am clean and warm and cosy in my pyjamas. I have taken a bath and washed my hair several times. Hot dinner awaits me at the table by the French window, and my bedroom is as splendid as ever.
Hermione!" He reached over the table to squeeze her hand. "Truly!"
"It was a good decision on your part to persuade Draco to come to me with his worries," he begins as soon as I am seated. "It shows that you are wise and have your heart in the right place, I never doubted that."
"What?" I stuff the pillow under my back against the headboard.
But no. Potter doesn't let me. He always makes sure I won't.
I won't.
"Dumbledore." Potter studies his hands. "Before... Snape came in and killed him. He made me promise that I would protect you after... after his death. Bring you to safety, and..." He exhales shakily.
In shock, I stare around, my breath coming out harsh.
I hit the bed with my foot and grunt at the pain that shoots through my toes. Kneeling on the floor, I press my face into the duvet and cry.
I'm so glad he came, so relieved. I've been sitting here in the back, stubbornly hoping he will approach. I refused to sit with Ron and Hermione.
She is shutting me out! I realise with a jolt. She is shutting me out of the protective sphere! A bit more and I won't be able to find them.
I think. I want to break down in front of him and beg
"What time is it?"
"Let's get you to the hospital."
I don't want to do this. I don't. I am failing, I already have. Snape offered help; maybe it's not too late to take it? He'd made an Unbreakable Vow, he said. He's bound to help anyway. Whether I refuse or accept, it makes no difference.
, Potter." He touches my arm. "I can't believe it worked. It's working. We'll keep trying until we succeed, until you can see the way you did before."
Malfoy winces but says nothing.
" He spat the word in disdain. "Where have you even acquired this
I run my palm over my face.
His mouth is so hot, moving up and down, and when he sucks... I cannot help crying out. This is too much.
"No."
I lie back down on the sofa and close my eyes, beginning to drift, when the door bangs. Mrs. Black's portrait shrieks and I hear the
"Go on," he said.
Never in my life have I been so glad to see him.
The tension is broken. I'm in a Muggle white button-down and black trousers. Potter's in a T-shirt and jeans. Which is good.
"Do you plan to open the door any time soon?"
Ron carefully stepped behind the lush rose tree in the middle of the room, peering at the assistant and the customer examining the item. A dainty gold thing, a weightless web of strings holding diamond water drops that shimmered in the light from the chandelier.
"And?"
I cannot fathom
"Come on,
They’ve been trying to destroy the wretched thing the whole morning to no avail. It seems the locket is heavily cursed and protected.
"Got it!" Malfoy says.
He approaches to sit beside me.
It's cold, and I shift on the windowsill and wince, disturbing my bandages. My wounds have gotten better, but any wrong movement still hurts. I should probably fetch the quilt. I can't summon it from here, Pomfrey took my wand away.
"Potter!"
"Come on. Let your anger out, channel it at your father! Tell him you hate him!"
"Yes, I... yes." He tugs at my hand, pulling me closer, and hugs me.
"What?" There's a tightness in my chest.
on him and responds with a buck of his hips.
"Wrap it for me, please."
"And please, Dobby,
Between us. Like
His voice very close to my ear startles me.
You brought the scarf to your nose and inhaled. Sweetness, softness, manners. Flowers. A dainty angle of a head, a diamond drop of the earring, a lock of hair at the temple. It was his mother's scarf, you thought.
"Hmmm…"
"Yes." I feel feverish.
"Potter!" I shout up the staircase.
finally turned, I flinched.
Will I regret anything?
She nods and bites her lip, and says no more.
"We've already succeeded, haven't you noticed?" Getting out of bed, he heads to the armchair.
I kiss, and kiss, and kiss him.
"Yes," I reply.
s though from a distance, I watch as someone else's life unfolds on the pages and in the Prophet headlines. It's just that someone else is
"Come in!" I shout and sway my legs off the bed.
"What are you doing here?"
"Is Master Black want more soup?"

turn to spin."
I don't mention Astoria, he doesn't talk about her either. I have no idea what's there between them, is there anything at all? He spends most of his time in my company, and that should be enough for me, I decide.
"Yes..." Henry says, but his voice wavers, telling you that he is not at all sure. Not at all...
You exhaled.
"Thank you, sir."
I mirror your posture on my side of the pool and dip my hand up to the wrist into the water.
He looms, his face in the shadows, but I know it's Potter.
"That was different!" I lace my boots and stand up. "I didn't choose whom to kiss!"
Wait...
"What do you say?" Ron whispered. "Would she like—"
"I know. I saw it before."
He gasps, trying to pull away, trying to wrench free... but my arms around his back hold tight. He is tense as a string, ready to snap any second.
"Letting the Devil tempt their souls last night, Paul and Christopher committed a sin, indulging in physical intimacy with each other. Had they not been stopped by the staff members, the consequences would have been even more menacing. They deserve a punishment and should atone. Do their parents agree?"
I fall.
Determined to find him first, I dash to the right aisle between the piles of cauldrons and the old broom shed. That's the way to the Vanishing Cabinet, and I can take it with my eyes closed. But no, I don't need to go there just yet. I stop and clutch the coin in my hand, thinking of Harry, and concentrate. It is suddenly obvious that I have to run ahead, and take two turns to the right, past the Vanishing Cabinet, and then duck abruptly to the left, and to the left again, between two piles of old broken chairs that reach almost to the ceiling. Who the hell put them like that and why? I run and run, I have no idea where I am by now, and to find the Vanishing Cabinet again, I will have to return to the door and start from there. My foot catches at something and I trip, landing on my outstretched palms. The coin flies out of my hand and rolls under the battered armchair.

“And does this person like you back?”
"Good bye," he'd said to me just a few minutes ago, fiddling with his glasses.
Studying your hands, you said nothing. What could you possibly have said? Let alone admit that you’d never
His name tastes alien in my mouth, but sacred, too. A secret.
"Don't be ridiculous," you rolled your eyes when I asked you, could it be possible that the house liked you?
You put it back where you found it and closed the wardrobe. There was nothing more to it, really.
you. It's how you smell. To me." He peers at me from under the fair strands across his eyes. "That's how Amortentia smells. To me."
"The necklace… the one that guy was buying." You tugged at your collar, your face hot. "It's beautiful. I'm sure they've got a double in the shop."
As though in slow motion, I stare as Aunt Bella dives aside with a shriek.
A year ago, I would.
I look.
"What thing?"
he snorts. "Another attempt requires a freshly brewed potion."
"Come on, boys. Like you
There's no difference. Not for me.
"Ron."
Dread coils in my stomach. "No...
"I'd never stolen anything in my whole life," I reply, reaching for cheese, "until I went camping with the
I settle to wait, checking the box every now and then. Nothing. Here I am again: hanging on the thin thread of hope, ending up right where I'd begun. Ready to sit and wait as long as it takes, and exchange everything for a word from someone who isn't entirely real. And I thought I'd got over it. I promise myself that this time, if he doesn't write back, I'll get rid of the box and set myself free.
"Fucking stay still, will you?" You dug your fingers into my shoulders, adjusting yourself on my cock.
“Yes... we’ll go,” Astoria replies. “See you, Draco. Harry.”
“No, I mean, what are you doing right now?”
"You said I should go to him for help. What did he say? He sent you, surely he told you of his plans?"
Rubbing my face against his nape like a cat, I wind my arms around him and squeeze, feeling his strong shoulders and hard chest.
The sound of my name startles us both. I turn. Potter and I gape at each other. By the look on his face, he is even more shocked than I am with him using my given name.
The lamplight would illuminate your hair golden.
"Maybe he can?" Weasel suggests, glaring at me. "Leave him here to rot. It's not the worst way to rot anyway..." He plucks a grape from the fruit bowl on the windowsill and stuffs it into his mouth.
"Can you sit?"
More than once I covere McGonagall's back, help Flitwick and deflect curses flying at Ginny Weasley. At first, it wasn't that hard, because those Death Eaters who knew me thought I was on their side. Now, it's getting tough. I barely stand on my feet, my whole body aches, and I'm not that much of a fighter. Everyone is exhausted, we've lost people, and
I take it all.
There’s a sound of him licking his fingers. He says nothing.
“Looks damn well like you are!” He steps back. “Not that I care, but you behave like a ninny. Whatever, Potter, but I didn’t expect it from you.”
"I’d been a dick... but Draco is my friend, and I want to
All this made me so aroused, I'm afraid someone might notice the erection pressing against the front of my jeans.
Manfred.
"I've given Draco an important task to fulfil; a crucial task which everything depends on. Harry, I want you to-" He looks up.
Tonight we feast, and I think it's the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. Everyone is in a good mood.
I notice the three of them wear the locket in turns on the chain around their necks. It feels as though it affects their mood. Whoever wears it becomes irritable and snaps at the others, getting angry for no reason. Or maybe it's just me, seeing things. Nevertheless, there's something malicious about that locket. Vile.
"This morning," he says, glaring at me, "the case was filed. The case ended up on Ron's desk, that’s how I know. Theodore Nott's case. Does that ring a bell,
“Your Patronus. A dragon.”
"Trousers are not allowed for women. Skirts or dresses should be worn at all times; the hem of a skirt or a dress should cover the knee."
I feel like shit. "Get on with it."
"A trial?" I ask faintly.
He asks, defiant, and I wrench my gaze off his erection.
Jade.
The thing is, Granger explained to me, that I’d used the Unforgivable on him repeatedly. Even though I'd obviously done it in self-defence, the Unforgivable is still Unforgivable. That's where Theo's barrister stands; that's the claim he is trying to push, demanding Azkaban for me for the use of the Cruciatus.
In the late afternoon, I finally reach the living room downstairs. It's dark and gloomy, though at least it's not as neglected as the majority of the house. There's a fire in the grate, a mug on the coffee table, and... there’s Potter's grey sweater, thrown over the back of the sofa. I left it on the chair in the kitchen last night. Something stirs in me, as I brush the soft fabric with my fingers, heading to the window.
"Malfoy, I've been unfair."
For me it was like a red cloth for a bull. I firmed my grip, making you wince. I hated you. I hated you at that moment. I wanted to harm you, to cause you pain, to make you scream - for all the things you were doing to me with your escapade. For all your indifference, your fucking independence be damned. For all the things you were withholding. For everything you didn't want from me.
She knows.
I miss him.
Harry steps closer.
"I can't do magic, but at least I can do
"That was..." he says, when I finish, turning to look at him.
“Alright, Harry?” Ron repeats.
he said and kissed me,
"You may," he says, taking his glasses off, "if you want."
I see the Unbreakable Vow, him hand-bound to Narcissa with the red string, Bella performing the ritual.
"I'm not pitying myself!"
side, I promised Harry, and I kept my promise until the very end. But Harry's dead, and I am dead, too. I don't have a side. I never had one.
"Put the Dreamless Sleep on my bedside table, I'm going to take it once I lie down," I tell Kreacher.
"Luckily, she can't." He pecked you on the lips. "Are you sure you don't want to come? Her invitation always stands—"
"What exactly?" His voice is odd. He removes his hands and places them back again.
"Very well, gentlemen. Do proceed."
"Are you fucking kidding me?!" You hissed to my face as soon as we left the Weasleys.
"We don't have Muggle money anyway," Weasley said, "don't tell me you want to transfigure galleons."
"I swear, we found it in a pond! In the forest!"
I send them back at you, and in the middle sunbeams collide.
I turn to Severus. "True. How is that?"
Potter waves his hand at me, and my clothes and skin instantly go dry.
"Merlin, that's great!" Used only to blackness before my eyes, I was shaken, thrilled, exhilarated to be able to finally
"Draco!"
of Dumbledore's shadow and...
I have a task to complete, besides.
“Hi, Harry,” one of them says.
snogging her? I mean, Ron and Hermione refused to play, right? If I weren't so pissed, I would've refused, too.
We talked and walked, holding hands in the woods, and said
He doesn't let go.
"Exactly where is it I'll be leading them to, Madam?"
"Where are we going, Potter?"
I feel lightheaded. The wildest thing had happened, and I don't know how to deal with it. Lying in his arms, exhausted from crying, I realised that it was the only place I'd ever felt safe for a long time. It cannot be undone. I don't know how he feels about it. But I know now, I would follow him anywhere. If he asked me to.
Potter glanced at me and grimaced.
"No problem." I feel strangely hollow. "We'll try again. There's plenty of time before June. Don't worry, surely we'll figure something out, you'll pass your NEWTs."
When there's a usual knock on my door in the morning, I don't say
"What about Father?"
It was yesterday, I think, or a week ago, or perhaps it never happened and I dreamt it all.
"Yeah." I exhale and bring the glass to my mouth. "Need it."
He punches me in the face, and I taste blood. I didn't see it coming. The second blow crushes my throbbing lip again. I cry out in pain and cover my mouth. It gives him the advantage he needs. He launches forward and drags me down. We end up in a heap on the ground, both wands forgotten in the mud.
"In a dream. I dreamt about you." I reach for his hand.
There's a shuffle of feet and murmurs. I stride out of the Great Hall and along the corridor. I don't know where I'm going. Away. Away from him. There's a noise of voices, people flooding out of the Great Hall. I speed up, taking a turn to the right. I don't want them to follow me.
"So is yours," I whisper between our kisses, "I like it."
But I've never
Something you're ashamed of
I try to stretch my legs. He stirs. Carefully, I slide my arm from beneath his head - I must do it before it dies completely - he turns anyway.
"Into the circle, come on!"
in your sleep.
"She will, after she sees your memories."
"It depends…" Would be his distracted reply.
She whirls around, fiery hair flying in her wake, and exits the room.
Berries crunch under the pestle, their sound turning thick, gooey, creamy as he works.
He does. Merciless, slow, he's sheathing all the way in until my lip is blood. His breath hot in my ear, he leans in for a kiss. I turn my head and bite.
He grinds against my erection, and I'm about to come. I moan, jerking awake.
"I am gay," I say, and Father winces, "and I am your son. And neither of those things is going to change."¹
"No." He grabs my wrist. "I'm dragging you inside." He pulls me along and slams the door shut.
"You damn well did," he throws, moving away from me.
I'm fully hard. I've never kissed a man before.
The lantern will light up on the wall, and the door will creak on its hinges, its sound making me finally turn my head…
For two days I check the box every half an hour, going mad.
"Ron! Stab it!" Harry steps forward.
"Yeah." He moves closer, letting me slip my hand into the crook of his elbow.
I wondered,
If that won’t help, then I don’t know what might. Entering the Great Hall this morning, I overheard a Gryffindor girl whispering to another: “Today’s password is Fawkes.” That could mean anything, really.
For one brief moment, there was a glimpse of hope, lurking behind Potter's words. But it’s been snuffed out in an instant. Potter didn't know what he was doing.
I'm in a panic all the same. I almost want to snatch the letter out of his hand and change
Malfoy laughs, shaking his head. "We are not in our right mind, Potter."
"What?"
"All right," Weasley hissed, "I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful just because now there's another damn thing we've gotta find."
“Yes, Master. New clothes is on your bed, Master.” With a
"Yeah?" I look at him, trying not to sound unnatural.
"Then who is
"I did," Severus says.
When she had left the room, your face crumpled, and the pillow under your cheek became damp.
I've never kissed anyone, I mean... Pansy in our fifth year doesn't count. She just insisted that she needed practice, and I, as a good friend, absolutely must help her out. So it wasn't real kissing.
His eyes are silver, shocked and beautiful. I kiss them. "Yes."
Unless you dared, I don't think I ever would.
“I think…” He takes me by the arm. “Maybe you should try and start using your magic? Wandlessly? Simple spells?” We head up the hill, back to the castle. “Maybe it all comes to that?”
"Do you?" He steps closer.
what it feels like to be exposed like that, and for me it's still not over."
The next day, none of us speaks to each other. The awkward silence hangs in the air, our embarrassment palpable.
"I'm gay. Does my life and... stuff..." He waves his hand. "Seem normal enough to you?"
"Why wouldn't you?… Fuck, sorry."
"I will, Gin." I squeezed her hand. "Thank you for..." I didn't finish.
I’m not really sure… but last night, after our fight with Ron, after I abandoned him and Hermione, I badly needed someone to hold onto, to feel that I wasn't alone, to close my eyes and cling to him and feel safer, even if only a little bit. Malfoy gave me all that, and more. He
?! For being gay?"
“Yeah?”
I'm drunk and asleep and not certain how I feel. My head is swimming, I'm thirsty as fuck, and there's that foul taste in my mouth.
Potter's mind is still around me. My hands begin to tremble.
The storm broke loose in an hour, leaving us no chance of keeping a fire.
"What a
"Are you going with me, or… waiting for your friends?"
"I love you, too." I squeeze her shoulders, I feel like crying. I breathe. "May I ask you to... tell Ron?" I say into her hair. "It's just..."
I exhale.
Oddly enough, I'm used to it by now - to him touching my hand. I don't really mind. It's been almost a month. We are paired up for Potions, but in most of the other classes he sits with me in the back anyway. At first, it felt weird; now, it's a routine; and even Ron and Hermione ceased fretting, ceased asking if I'm alright.
"Why?"

Perfect. I survey him for a moment. Now, isn't it a perfect servant that never gets on my nerves?
And you won't give

He doesn't stop, his smile vicious, he thrusts harder, sending a sharp pain through my very core.
"What does it mean?" Henry asks.
"What for? And how would I do that anyway? I can't even read, I don't know if you
Slytherin - Gryffindor. Malfoy doesn’t play.
I cease breathing.
"What was it?"
His lips touch my ear, and then his tongue.
You will not indulge me
So when he invited you to his house, saying that his parents were away for the night, it filled you with fear and anticipation. But whatever you may have expected from him, it wasn't what had actually happened.
Granger nods, and the two of them head to the side, making their way through the crowd of the reporters, leaving Potter and me in the middle. Mother's going to talk cost with Granger for her services.
"I don't know, just… I'd have liked to know that." I shrug.
It’s not a wand... I don’t have a wand... My hand is gripping the bedside lamp.
Finally
“Alright, Harry?” Ron touches my shoulder.
"Fuck
His face is resigned and frowning, but he nods and says: "Alright" in the end. And I feel better.
You call me by my name
"No, it's not. But your sort doesn't see the difference."
"Do you know Astoria Greengrass?" I asked Malfoy the next day at Potions.
He throws me a note—
I put my hand into the crook of Hermione's elbow, Ron links his arm through mine, and we head out. We are going to the Weasleys' for Christmas.
I mean.
With a sigh, I gingerly take a few steps forward, until my fingers finally brush the doorframe. Sliding my fingertips down, I find and press the door handle, entering the bathroom. My hand automatically reaches for the switch on the wall before I drop it.
that catches my eye in his letters. That fancy
“Yes. What is this all about, Potter?”
"No, I mean... kissing... I wouldn't be able to give that impression. That she's your girlfriend, I mean."
Past the greenhouses, past the back porch opening on the path to the Quidditch pitch.
Sun is in my eyes. You are in my eyes. Right now I can't really tell the one from the other or see the difference.
I'm nodding into the cushion. I want his touch. I hate it.
"I don't hate your guts," I reply.
"Right."
When Malfoy leaves and I am alone, undressing before bed, my fingers brush over something soft on the duvet. I pick it up.
Then I don't understand
A loud crash from the landing beneath.
He tightens around me and cries out, as though in pain, over and over, and grips at my thigh, his other hand flying frantic, spilling hot between us, and it seems like he'll never stop.
"What happened to Weasley?" I ask Potter, watching him over the flames.
. You don’t know about a woman… but you certainly would
We head up the steps to the front door.
you destroyed the diary with-" She continued, and Potter put his mug down.
With a flick of her wrist, Aunt Bella sends him flying into the corner. Greyback hits the wall and falls still. She turns to us, sword in hand and her eyes wild.
Someone without mercy.
I don't want him to leave, I'm afraid to be alone. But I don't want him to come close either.
." Weasel rolls his eyes. "Listen,
I say, touching my finger to the star on his chest.
My hands curl into fists. I tuck them under my armpits and cross my arms on my chest.
"Malfoy," he says warily, looking me up and down, and I want to squirm in my pyjamas.
"Crucio!"
"All this stuff is absolutely crazy, just... be careful, Harry." Gin hugged me this morning on her way out. She is joining the training for the Holyhead Harpies after New Year, so I have no idea how soon we may meet again.
caught up in the moment.
I thought, and was about to call Kreacher - to get me the fuck out of here and back to Grimmauld, when the bell announced the end of the class and there was a noise of chairs, shuffling of feet, people flooding the corridor.
"Why?"
His mind welcomes me, embraces me and rocks like the deepest waters of the dark ocean. He is well-trained and knows better than to resist. He lays everything bare, ripe for the taking.
Is it some cruel joke?
I see understanding in Hermione's eyes, it seems she isn't surprised at all. Ron clears his throat.

from the dance.
"Take Granger and Weasley with you, but
I don't know about amends, but he's set on passing his NEWTs. I don't tell her. I like to think that she's not wrong, too.
"Rise and speak," I say.
"Since the... Snape died, and he took the memories..."
A hand appears out of thin air in front of me. Potter's hand. My heart jumps, and I grab it, letting myself be pulled into the spelled area.
"Do you want me to leave?" He asks.
It’s Sunday afternoon. The Quidditch pitch is deserted. We are about to do the most stupid thing.
"I'm not your landlord, just...
The stupid question makes me smile. "No."
"I trust you to put effort into this, Son. Everything depends on you and your willingness to change," Father said before finally dismissing you.
He whispered in the heat of the night, his lips crushed into your shoulder.
"You are the one blackmailing me, you fucker, why so jumpy?" I shove him in the shoulder.
"No!" I shout in his face. "If I tell you,
all of them here, except for the
"Is your chest hair blond?" I mumble.
"All right?" I ask.

His hair is blond
I do, like an idiot. I do. I’d better shut the fuck up, but I can’t help myself, poking Malfoy about her at any opportunity. I don’t know, maybe it’s my way of self-preservation. So that when
I break the kiss. "Sorry... can I kiss you?"
“What?” I don’t turn in his direction.
I move. Gingerly, as carefully as I can to not disturb my wounds, I roll onto my back and shuffle to the left, leaving a space beside me. Harry lifts my blanket and slips beneath it, carefully arranging himself on his side next to me.
"Okay, then." I scramble to my feet.
"I love you, too." He holds me in a rib-crushing hug. "Just so you know… I'm here if you need me. Any time."
The moment is broken, this makes me laugh. "Trust you to apologise like that: I’m not sorry.”
"Going to my room." His voice is flat.
The best thing about Kreacher, is that he does exactly as he's told. Literally. And tells exactly what he's doing.
“About a month.”
"Come forward," he said.
His eyes still lowered, Lucius rises to his feet with a bow. He does know the art of kneeling and bowing before his Master well, I have to give him that.
Malfoy flinches.
"Look, mate--" Ron falters. Like he always does. Fucking
And now...
"What?"
– scene from the film ‘Boy Erased’.
Weasley this one might be, but the girl is Hermione Granger. And..." She trails off.
His footsteps retreat, they both move away from me, there's a swoosh of the Floo. They are gone.
“Yes,” he says. “I’m done for tonight.”
I am not one of those. It's always dark for me. Just dark, black. Blank. Has been for over two months.
Which one is
and summoned...
One couple breaks the kiss, coming up for air, and the crowd whines in disapproval. I see Neville's flushed face, his arm over Susan Bones' shoulder.
-clockwise," Malfoy hisses, putting his hand over mine.
"How so?" He raises his eyebrow. The skin of his forehead wrinkles where the eyebrow is supposed to be. He has no eyebrows.
"Come." I take his hand, pulling him through the door and back to the Entrance Hall.
her so much. She runs forward and grabs me, and squeezes me so that I can't breathe.
"Come on, Potter, you don't know me," he says in annoyance, standing up.
In fear or shame
is left. Not a single one. Good.
"I want you to touch me," I repeat.
"Okay." He doesn't argue.
People enter and spread in a dark semicircle along the walls, more and more of them, they flood inside like dark waters, and nothing can hold them back.
A sound is flowing from above, you look up. The piano. You smile.
I feel ill.
"Where did you get it? How did you get there?!"
"You feel lonely," I say, suddenly realising it's true.
He tugs at my hand, back and forth to the music.
He punches me a few more times, I manage to kick him in the gut and tear out a bit of his
Zabini.
"I don't know... you might be reminding me of someone." He puts the glasses back on Harry’s nose.
"I haven't." He tightens his arm around me. "I sleep naked."
"Draco, dear." Mother hugs me, and I squeeze her in return.
"He survived another Avada Kedavra, Draco.” Mother shifts in the armchair. “The Dark Lord killed him, but he didn't die - again - I don't know how could that have happened, but I witnessed it with my own eyes. Mr. Potter came to the Forbidden Forest after the Dark Lord summoned him. He didn't fight, he just stood there and let the Dark Lord kill him. Don't ask me, I don't know how, but the Dark Lord failed. When Mr. Potter fell, he ordered me to check whether he was truly dead."
," he says, "I mean... I'm not an expert, like...
I want to laugh; sometimes I forget how ignorant of Wizarding history he'd grown up. "It's common knowledge." I shrug.
There is, of course there is. Otherwise, why would he refuse to tell me?
"What do you want, Potter?"
"Hermione--" Ron begins.
We stepped inside.
Potter frowns and reaches into the pocket of his jeans, retrieving a coin. Doubt crosses his face.
Potter stares at me.
"Then why help me?" He asks quietly.
Your fingers brushed a delicate texture as you extricated the offensive piece of cloth from under the jacket—a scarf. It clashed with the green like a joke. No. He would never wear it like this.
"How do you know?"
“What?”
I shift in my chair at the back of the class, imagining that heads are turning, throwing curious glances at me. I don’t know if they are watching, I’m not sure everyone knows. Ron and Hermione wanted to sit with me, but I told them I’d be fine in the back. Alone.
Noir wrote, when I asked him why had he done it in the first place, why had he written that note.
We are in the Ministry Atrium. Mother is gripping my hand, and the flashes of the cameras, as though in a slow motion, are making everything look black and white and surreal.
You didn't ask me where we were heading.
When I slipped into the sleeping bag beside him, I sought his warmth, but not like
“What?” He gives a bewildered laugh. “What’s the matter with you?”
"Harry!"
He pulls my boxers down and stands up. I feel his erection against my belly. I want to touch it, but I'm still shy. He takes my hand, leading me to the bed.
"I want to." You peer at me from under your tangled fringe.
The elf appears. "Master."
"As you wish. Well-well…" Her voice is playful. "Since it's Valentine's Day, tell us the truth: are you in love?"
“What’s this?”
Then I remember that I'm dead - as far as they must be aware - and rise from the armchair to show that I am pretty much alive and stand tall and proud so that they won’t take me for some stupid ghost.
"Yes." I jerked away from her. "Seemed to be. Leave me alone, Hermione."
I think,
"Draco worked hard, there were high chances of him succeeding without my help. But should he have failed, the Vow would urge me to accomplish his task, hence your plan would prevail either way." Severus bows.
If he needs me to beg, I will beg.
“Stirring the contents of the cauldron anti-clockwise for thirty seconds.” His perfume moves closer. “Done.”
I go cold. "What?"
"I want to visit Godric's Hollow," Harry says one night out of the blue, waking me up.
"I don't need your help." He limps to the bed and grips the headboard, carefully angling his body to lower himself down.
- derives from the Latin words "harmonia" - "harmony", "nectere" - "to tie, bind," and "passus" - "step, pace.” The spell that Draco Malfoy used to mend the broken Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement and make it work again in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” by J.K. Rowling.
He tucks his hands under his cheek. "Good. I slept for ages. Now I'm good."
"Hi, Draco!"
I stop playing, looking around the living room. It is trying with all its might to appear cosy and warm, and even beautiful, in its own way. It has only taken two short weeks for me to love this place. I stare into the fire in the grate for a long time.
I need to put something on.
It's absolutely bewildering, but Malfoy and I begin to get along.
I still want to believe that he would.
He says nothing, and I assume he did turn away. Or he didn’t. I don’t know. Not that I care. I’m not sure why I asked him to turn away in the first place. I tug my boxers down and hastily meddle with the new ones. Done. Okay, my shirt. I put it on, buttoning it down. Trousers. On. Tucking the shirt in, I fumble with the belt buckle.
"He probably needs a Mind-Healer." I heard Granger told Potter a few days ago.
“Maybe?” He snorts behind me. “Most certainly, more like.” I feel his hands on my back, pulling the jumper down from where it got stuck under my armpits.
But then again, how would you know? You never saw the side it exposed when I was alone.
"Yes, with
"Potter!" I seek his eyes.
[5] – dialogue between Ron and Harry in the tent that results in the fight, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Part 1.
"I'm not going back."
The elf reappears.
I've taken up the habit of sitting on the back porch with Malfoy in the evenings. After the epic embarrassment with Ron and Hermione two weeks ago, things had gotten back to normal, but I avoid getting in their way, trying to give them the privacy they need.
Probably not.
"I'm hurting you." My pulse pounded in my ears.
"What?” He raises his eyebrows. “We did it, we won."
Hermione! In case you've forgotten--"
I want to hit him.
It's Sunday, thank Merlin. I sleep through half the day. Gin left me "to recuperate," she’d said, and Ron is nowhere to be seen.
I open my eyes with a groan. Everything hurts, bandages are too tight around my chest. The sight of the high white ceiling of the hospital wing makes my eyes water.
... but not
"What?"
"What are you doing?" Potter runs to kneel by Weasley's side and uncorks the vial. His hands are shaking.
In a flash, Malfoy dives towards the ground, and I'm chasing him before I even fully realise what I'm doing. He's seen the Snitch!
I had no idea about your childhood." I cannot imagine what he might have gone through before coming to Hogwarts. I suddenly remember how I used to mock his appearance, his broken glasses; how skinny he used to return every year after the summer break. I feel sick. “Fuck, they starved you, didn’t they? Fuck, Potter, I’m sorry… I used to joke about that, about your Muggle family, I had no idea…”
Handwriting is different, not utterly so but still. He wrote this one with his own hand.

Avada Kedavra?" Carefully, Bellatrix steps around Malfoy's body to take a closer look, all the time holding Dumbledore at wand point.
"Thank you, Harry." Her hand briefly squeezed the knuckles of yours fisted fingers that rested in the crook of your elbow, before she turned away and strode towards the front door.
I shouldn't be talking like this, I don't
He fell silent for a while.
between us, everything that makes us who we are; all our choices that cannot be fixed; everything that we've never talked about.
It feels like we're back at Hogwarts
He is, of course, he is. He refused to tell me what his Amortentia smells like.
It feels good, so good that just a little bit more, and I may come in no time. I close my eyes, concentrating on that feeling…
The double doors of the wardrobe squealed in protest of dislodged hinges as you threw them wide open with a wrench. The first thing that caught your eye was his coat. You ripped it off the hanger, hurling it on the floor where it sagged into a thick black puddle of wool. A sweep of your arm, and several hangers with his shirts were sent flying across the floor. Another jacket—out.
"Harry?"
The four of us stare at the chicken that walks around, picking at something on the ground. I look up at Potter. He just shakes his head.

"Which memory did you choose this time?" He asks as we head back to the castle.
“What?” I realise I miss the touch of his hand, even the gloved one.
It's thick and not at all soft, I realise. I imagine fair strands between my fingers, their odd shade of platinum blond.
"You're staring," you would mumble, feeling my eyes on you in the first light of dawn.

He sighs theatrically, spreading his hands.
"Oh, I mean..." You sit up, dipping both your feet into the pool.
"It arrived this morning." Potter drops an envelope on the table in front of me. "To my Ministry address. So... I opened it, since it said it was for me."
