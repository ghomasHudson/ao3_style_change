After the slightly chaotic events of last month, Ron and Hermione had decided to stay the night at Grimmauld Place. Nothing Harry said could persuade them otherwise.
Most of the questions Elio had asked Harry had no idea how to answer without giving himself away, except maybe the bit about being up at night. Nightmares were common enough among wizarding folk, especially the ones who’d lived through the war. The fact that these days Harry’s were about more recent events wasn’t necessary to mention.
The envelope was made of smooth parchment, and had a blue wax seal. He ripped it open to reveal neat cursive handwriting.
He touches a wisp of light and it feels soft. He snatches his hand away, surprised by the nearly physical sensation—that light could also be matter.
Harry’s gaze snapped up in delight. Ron and Hermione were looking at Rose with identical shocked expressions.
“Malfoy,” he says. Malfoy is wearing a light grey scarf. It looks so soft Harry is tempted to touch it. He turns around, surprise written all over his face.
With a sinking feeling, he realized that not only was she bringing him along as some sort of personal cockblocker, she hadn’t told Boot he was coming. Pansy really bloody owed him.
“Want to try it?” Draco whispers, from way too close. Harry’s already starting to get heart palpitations.
Night was falling again, and Harry didn’t want to think about it. Blood on the floor, a weak bite on his hand, screams and jets of light. A curse worming its way towards his heart.
“Robards seems to think the kidnappings have stopped, so that’s good,” Ron said. “But no one’s seen Greyback or Rowle since the raid, so we’re back to square one on that front.”
“Okay,” Harry said. “So the family thing—being my pack or whatever, you think that’s why I decided to show up here?”
Memories of his teaching threatened to envelop Harry, which had prompted him to search Grimmauld Place high and low for a record player, reminiscent of the one he’d known Remus to play in DADA. Harry had found one eventually, a nondescript black box covered in dust, shoved beneath Sirius’s old bed. He’d opened the lid, heart sinking once he noticed the state of the thing. Well beyond his reparative capabilities for such a finicky muggle object. Remus would have been able to fix it, he was sure.
Harry, now startled fully awake, futilely attempted to cover himself with the tiny wireless. He smiled sheepishly.
He sat and watched the rain through the gap between yellow flowery curtains. There was a fire crackling in the hearth. On the mantle sat a framed picture of Neville and Luna that Harry had taken one spring in the Sanctuary, along with several long speckled feathers in a vase.
Harry’s ears pricked. The voice sounded oddly familiar, and it brought him a strange comfort. He circled the wireless and lay curled around it, snout tucked into his side, the wireless snug next to his belly. As he listened to the voice rising and falling in a soothing rhythm, he found his breath evening out, gently fanning his fur. The itch to run wild seemed to quiet within him.
Seeing Potter again broke a dam in Draco’s mind, which pissed him off, as it had been very meticulously constructed. Over the last six years, he’d subconsciously tucked all his thoughts on the man carefully away like old clothes gently folded, never to be worn again.
She leaned towards him, and said in her quiet voice, “Some things are less complicated than we imagine them to be. Often the simplest explanation is the right one.”
Once Harry had escaped that entirely useless conversation and extracted his head from the fire, he was struck with inspiration. Hurrying over to the study, he rummaged in an ancient writing desk for a spare parchment and a quill, accioed a vial of red ink, and began to scribble a note.
“Potter’s already here, darling.” Narcissa said, blinking. Potter smiled and gave a jaunty little wave.
“Save your breath,” she said, “and do something useful like get ready for tonight.” At Draco’s groan, she sent him a stern look, and made a shooing motion with her hand. “Now shoo, so I can get dressed.”
Jenkins turned, her eyes widening at the sight. “Fucking hell,” she whispered. The rows of children disappeared in the darkness—there were too many of them to count despite Harry’s rough estimate, and they were all about to transform by the looks of it.
They rest their head next to his and drape their arm over him, gently pinning him in place, a set of fingers twirling the small curls in his hair.
He’s taken to eyeing Malfoy in the classes they share, which happens to be nearly all of them, with the eighth year cohort so small. It’s not because of the gender thing, although Harry has noticed that too—the way Malfoy seems happier in herself, in her body. The way she quietly embraces her own expansiveness. The freedom suits her.
“Sorry?” is all he can think of to say. All he can notice is that her eyelashes seem longer than usual.
Harry is proven right when Malfoy says, “Yes, she’s along for the ride. Hold on.” Then he reaches a slender hand to the space above Harry’s head and his mind goes blank.
He couldn’t shake the feeling it wasn’t, though, and was gripped with something like terror when he so much as thought of writing back—until the owl returned.
“Potter,” Malfoy sighs, breath warm against Harry’s cheek as he kisses his jawbone, making Harry shudder. “Potter, fuck.”
Harry’s whole world grinds to a halt. He watches Draco come, watches him slump against the wall as he spurts out into the shower, and it’s incredible.
“He was bollocks at it at first,” Harry reveals, barely biting back a laugh as Malfoy kicks him under the table.
“Wait,” Malfoy says as Hughes begins to shuffle away. “Aren’t you supposed to give us some sort of project? Or a research direction?”
Harry pointedly ignores Esther’s giggling as they step out of the shop into the cool fall air. “Where are we going?” he asks.
“Oh,” Harry says, looking down at the desk. Then he looks at Malfoy again, at how his expression is so, so tired. “Come on,” he says, standing.
Draco laughs, the truth of it smacking him in the face as he says, “Looks like you have a type.” Then he stills—shit, he’s just implied that
One could easily become addicted to standing here, staring at the pearly sheen of the fountain, wondering at its depths. He forces himself to turn away. This room will be a comfort in the coming days, he thinks, because while he’s done being a Trainee, specialty rotations aren’t supposed to be easy either.
“Salazar, Harry Potter is apologizing to me,” Malfoy says, eyebrows raising. “Never thought I’d live to see the day—or, ha, well, I didn’t. I’m undead. Anyway, the point is that I am a vampire, only allowed to be out at night, and my life is ten times more fun and interesting than yours.”
Harry’s lips are still tingling from the kiss when he opens them and asks, “Why shouldn’t you want those things?”
Astoria is awake by the time Draco makes it to her hospital room, looking exhausted but alert nonetheless. It seems she’s already told the Healers about her outing, which honestly kind of infuriates him because she hadn’t seen fit to tell Draco earlier, but he goes to her bedside nonetheless.
Potter’s mouth opens and closes for a second. “Oh,” he breathes, looking relieved, but his expression goes somber again as Draco takes a shaky breath. “Then—then what’s wrong?”
Harry thinks of the painting of Walburga Black, stuck to the wall of Grimmauld Place, and nods. Still, he doesn’t see what it has to do with him.
Harry squinted at him for a moment. Then he remembered, gasping. “So that was you! Hermione wouldn’t let me go try and Hex you for it, even though I was
,” he gasps, staggering over at the splitting ache in his skull. He’s barely aware that, on the other side of the room, Potter is doing the same, but it’s difficult to focus on anything except the pain. “What did you
Harry stumbles over to one of the observation chairs, unable to keep his eyes off of Draco, of the flex of his forearms as he grasps at the other man, dragging him closer as they kiss.
Potter’s grin lights up the room, and Draco’s heart flutters madly as Potter reaches out to stroke a hand down his face. “I—I was worried you regretted it,” Potter tells him.
“I’m coming with you,” Harry says firmly. “I want to be with you until—until...” He’s shaking. “Until the e-end.”
Biting his lip, Harry nods. “I hope you’re okay,” he says. He kind of wants to scream, or cry, or something, but all he feels right now is numbness. “I think I’m going to go lie down.”
Draco jolts. “What? I’m fine,” he mutters, hooking a hand under one knee and hitching it upwards because fuck, Potter’s going to be
So they’re cuddling, relaxing, their outer robes shucked off as they sit together, and Harry—Harry is comfortable, like this, in his ex-enemy’s arms. He
“Save the excuses for someone who will believe them,” Adams says, and Draco resists the urge to shrink away from her tone. “It’s a wonder you two didn’t damage the fountain.”
“You'll pass,” he says, reaching over to pat Harry's arm. The touch burns, and for once Harry is glad for the charms that obscure his own face—because that means Four can't see the sudden warmth in his cheeks.
He can tell Potter hates him with every fibre of his being. It’s written across his face each and every day, and Draco can’t do a thing about it.
By the time they get out the door, Draco is certain that he’s going to explode if he has to put up with this for much longer. He has several fleeting fantasies about quitting his job and living on the streets, but then he remembers the searing headache that he gets if he so much as steps away from Potter for a moment, and suddenly the idea of running away seems much less appealing.
“Sorry I took so long,” Potter says, a little out of breath. “I didn’t have anything to wear—I had to Floo-call Hermione.” He’s flushing a little, which is unfairly attractive—Draco always looks like he’s about to explode when he goes all red.
He walked for a while, but stress still ebbed at his mood. He wished that the event was over already, so he could get back to his normal past-time of doing absolutely nothing.
“I can’t tell you why,” Malfoy says, and Harry believes him. “I can’t tell you... not—not all of it, at least. It’s personal.”
And Merlin, he shouldn’t be reacting like this, but that kiss left more of an impact on him than he ever wanted it to. He’d wanted so desperately to figure everything out, to kiss a boy and find himself and become an Auror and fall in love. Two of which he’d done, though they’d been short-lived.
Draco nods in response. He means to say something, but then he has a sudden and intrusive thought about what the bond might do if they were even closer—like if they had sex, for instance—and he’s so violently horrified at having thought that with Potter draped around him like this that he keeps his mouth shut.
He looks over, noticing then that she’s barely picked at her food. He frowns. “Stop worrying,” he says. “Are you feeling all right?”
And then Harry doesn’t have time to respond before Draco he adjusts himself and presses down onto his cock.
Draco’s lips press gently against his neck, openmouthed, and he sucks a hickey into Harry’s skin, making Harry shudder. “You sure?” he asks teasingly.
perfect. He and Draco bicker almost as much as they joke around, and sure, it’s not as nasty as it was in the days of their youth, but Draco still gets angry with him sometimes—except the last time he can actually remember being overly cross with Potter was years ago, wasn’t it?
Potter gives him a strange look. Then he sighs, pulling his hand away, and that loss hurts almost more than the fact that Potter will probably get up and leave now.
Potter pulls Draco in close and kisses him softly, leaving Draco’s lips tingling. “You’re right. I’m not in love with you,” Potter admits, slipping his hand into Draco’s hair, warm and reassuring. “But I want to be.”
His orgasm comes as a surprise, a gentle wave that rocks through him as he ruts against Draco, and he spills over Draco’s stomach, groaning, clutching at him.
And Harry’s surprised to realize that at some point he stopped feeling embarrassed sitting here. Somehow all his vulnerability has fallen away, replaced by a sense of wonder as Malfoy’s spells flash against the canvas.
But before it can, Malfoy opens his mouth. “Potter,” he says quietly. “Don’t think that I didn’t—enjoy it. For what it’s worth. I—Merlin.”
“What?” he snaps upon jerking the door open. Then he sees that Malfoy’s shivering and starts to feel bad—but just a little bit.
Harry mulls that over for a moment. “So the problem, then, is that we don’t really talk about any of it, isn’t it?”
“Nev and Blaise are in the next room over, so I’ve got company, at least,” Ginny says, patting Hermione on the shoulder. “It’s not so bad in here either. There are enough of us now that they’ve started doing little community events, and there’s a flying session on Friday that I’m excited for—for those of us that can still fly, that is.” She sits back on the hospital bed, dangles her legs over the edge, and pastes on a smile.
Malfoy looks exhausted. His skin is pale, he has rings under his eyes, and he hasn’t even healed his lip from when Harry punched him last night. Harry thinks he might even be wearing the same robes as the day before, which is something he’s never known Malfoy to do. Ever.
“So what, Potter?” Draco says, distinctly aware that they’re close enough that Potter’s knee is brushing his own. He wants to shift away, but he can’t figure out a way to do it so that it’s not obvious, so he has to suffer through the unbearable pleasure that is touching Potter.
Hermione beams. “It’s no problem,” she says. “I’ve got to get to work now, but I’ll see you for research later?”
The sound of it is loud in the small kitchen. Harry’s cheek is pink after, his eyes guilty as he reaches up to touch the mark. “I deserved that,” Harry says quietly.
to forget—because Draco was right, wasn’t he? They’re not so good for each other, especially not with the Amortentia in the mix. His attempt at fixing everything had only left him even more confused and miserable.
“Well. Did it.... go? Okay?” Hermione asks after another moment of silent, wide-eyed conferral with Ron.
Harry swallows away his despair at Draco’s condition and locks the door, then adds a couple of extra locking spells he’d learned during his brief time in the Aurors for good measure. “Okay,” he says, putting his wand down.
Damn Malfoy. Always mucking up Harry’s life. At least Harry won’t be running into him any time soon—there aren’t any Ministry events on his calendar for months, and at any rate, he doubts Malfoy will step foot into his store again.
Harry leans over, made slightly harder by the fact that Draco’s now on top of him, and grabs his wand. He casts protection charms, and then he’s just about to cast a lubrication spell on his fingers when Draco stops him.
That, and a small pang of loneliness—the tiniest, smallest wish that he could crawl back into Potter’s bed, even though Potter won’t want him there.
Of course, Malfoy could also suddenly decide to never speak to him again, which Harry thinks might hurt him just as badly.
“Don’t get too comfortable. I’m still half-dressed,” Harry points out, even though he’d really rather not get up right now either—Malfoy naked and warm on top of him is something he doesn’t want to stop. But he’d only ever gotten halfway out of his trousers, and now they’re hiked down on his thighs, fairly uncomfortable now that he’s not distracted by arousal.
“I miss it,” Malfoy says quietly. “Being young.” He looks down at the table. “Given, I was a right arsehole, so it’s probably better I’m not anymore, but.”
Nightmares again. It was inevitable, of course, considering he was here for the Ministry’s (stupid bloody) Commemorative Remembrance Affair for Potter. He had come up with the title himself. None except Hermione had scolded him for the inappropriate acronym.
It’s worth saying it to see Malfoy’s eye twitch. Harry laughs, and Malfoy lets out a long-winded sigh. “You’re the most bloody insufferable man I’ve ever met, do you know?” Malfoy mutters, scowling. “Fine.”
He looks away. But he does speak. “I could tell you to let me fuck your face, and I wouldn’t know when you needed to breathe. I could tell you to eat
“You could work here with her. With me. Both of us. She wanted me to teach DADA next year, except I didn’t want to. But the current DADA teacher is only temporary, and Slughorn is thinking about retiring again, too. We could do it, I just have to ask—“ He had gotten up and was already halfway to the door when Malfoy spoke.
“You know, I would say I’d hex him for you, but I think it’s probably against Healer code to hex any of the patients,” Hermione says.
“My mother was partial to leaving records on for me as a child,” Malfoy says, shrugging in way of answer. “Sometimes they would skip while my parents were away and couldn’t cast
“Well,” Potter says, recounting it aloud, “We were, er, grinding, just like you just saw, and you told me all the things that you wanted me to do to you—actually, I should keep that memory in the Pensieve just so I can refer back to it,” he says with a grin.
The tremble in Malfoy’s voice gives him pause. Harry looks at him, furrowing his brow, his shirt hanging from his fingertips. “Malfoy... are you all right?”
“Put your fucking tongue in my arse,” Draco says all in a rush, and Potter chuckles and leans back down.
Harry’s throat tightens, and all of a sudden, he feels frozen—with longing, with jealousy, with a whole mess of feelings that are constricting around him, holding him down so he can’t move.
“Can you try to think about it at least? For me? I’ve been trying, you know, to heal and to be different, to be a person you’d actually want in your life.” Harry could feel Draco shaking his head. “I know I'm whining like a fucking baby, but… If it’s not me that’s the problem, then try. Please?” Draco asked, voice muffled.
“Never said I wasn’t, did I? See you, Potter,” Malfoy says, waving a hand, the other hand in his pocket.
But thoughts of lying in bed with Draco fade from his mind as they head to the den. Even before Harry walks into the room, he can hear from Ron and Hermione’s voices that something is very wrong.
He’s not sure how long it goes on. He only knows that once it’s over, he still can’t move, even as Malfoy casts a spell to heal the bite marks, even as he hands the man a vial that at Harry’s best guess would be a blood-replenishing potion. Harry slumps against the wall, watching as the other man heads deeper into the alleyway and Disapparates.
“No, I…” Potter sighs. “I don’t hate you. I haven’t for a while. And anyway, even on the potion you were still
He would treat Potter well, really, he would. First off, he wouldn’t suck up to him like Robertson had. He knows by now that Potter hates that. And he knows that Potter’s a bit playful, knows he loves talking to people who make him laugh—he could borrow one of the Elves from the manor to help make Potter dinner, he thinks, because it’s not hard to remember the things Potter had regularly chosen from the table at Hogwarts, and then they could curl up on Draco’s sofa and drink wine and smile at each other over the rims of their glasses.
He lets out a loud whimper when he feels the plug finally settle into place, the base obvious where it digs into his arsecheeks, and Malfoy lets out a gleeful chuckle.
He feels like he’s walking on a cloud, all the way until he gets an Owl just as he’s sent Seb home for the evening.
He shudders a sigh. “I doubt that,” he says bitterly. “And anyway... I’ve hurt enough people, haven’t I?”
“I sort of think we’re all different now,” Hermione says, and it’s possibly the truest thing Harry’s heard in a long time. Then she sighs. “I
“Not yet,” Malfoy says, but thankfully he seems to take the hint anyway and slips his hand down to pull at the drawstring of Harry’s pajama bottoms. Harry’s heart races. “Could take these off?”
“Well, what else was I supposed to say?” Potter asks. “If I told them about the bond then they definitely would have thought you cursed me or something like that—and anyway, we share a bed. It’s not like it’s that much of a stretch.”
, Malfoy says, still pointedly looking away. “I’m fine, and—” His throat makes a small clicking noise. “...And I’m gay, Pottter.”
Harry yelps, a warm knot of lust and excitement and a tiny bit of fear forming in his stomach as he stands there, wearing only his pants and t-shirt and that too-tight tie. “What the fuck are you doing?” he shouts.
All at once, he understands the torture of not being able to move—it’s dirty and hot and he can’t pull away, even when it feels so good, nearly
“I’m not,” Harry insists. “I’m just… I dunno.” He shrugs, not sure how to explain it without letting on that already he feels much more attached to Malfoy than he should.
Hermione purses her lips. “Okay,” she says. “I just don’t want you to end up hurt, you know? Especially if he has a mate out there that he could fall in love with someday, theoretically.”
Malfoy turns and looks at him, and Harry’s eyes widen, because there’s something in Malfoy’s face that almost makes it look like he wants it as much as Harry does. “I never said that,” Malfoy says, just like before. Then he turns in a crack of Apparition and is gone.
“Moving on, I want you to try to teach me the Recupersanguis spell.” Langley sat down in one of the classroom desks, looking up at Harry primly, as a student might. Harry suppressed a snort, grabbing a textbook and rifling through to the relevant section on reversing blood-dispelling curses.
Harry and Hermione both laugh, and Draco snickers, sliding his arms around Harry’s waist. “Yes,” he says. “I happen to be part Veela, although I’ll hex you if my Father ever gets wind of that.”
So he’s left here, just sitting in the dark, musty Death department every day, staring down at books while quietly seething. To be honest, he doesn’t know how Potter stands it either.
“Blimey, that’s complicated,” Ron says, rubbing his forehead. “Sounds like you’ve got your work cut out for you, ‘Mione.”
But his yearning for Potter is unending, and so he pulls out the mirror every other night, breath singing in his lungs as Potter smiles back at him from the surface.
“Wanker,” he mutters again for posterity, but he can’t stop himself from reaching out and resting a hand on Potter’s waist.
Harry’s breath hitches. “Maybe... maybe I don’t,” he admits, sliding his hands up and down Draco’s back. “Maybe I think this is a brilliant idea.”
. “Fine,” he says, “I get it.” He supposes he’ll have to be happy enough with the fact that at least Malfoy’s not completely disgusted at the thought of sleeping with him.
Truth be told, Harry’s not sure he has one, besides the fact that he’s willing to maybe let Malfoy drink his blood—but there’s no way he’s going to say that aloud. “Don’t you think it might be fun?” he asks instead.
“If you insist,” Malfoy says drily, as if he’s trying to seem unaffected, but the full body flush that’s come over him says otherwise. He inhales deeply, exhaling through his nose as he pulls his finger out, then slides two in instead. “Oh,
Smirking softly, Draco nods with a look of appraisal in his eyes. “Well… Maybe I’ll say something like that next time.”
Harry is suddenly caught up in wondering exactly who Malfoy hangs out with these days, if he has friends he visits weekly or even someone to share a bed with. Maybe neither of those is true, if Malfoy’s expression is anything to go by.
Draco nodded along with Harry’s words. “And it’s not like I can talk about it, because I deserve everything I’ve gotten…”
Instead of answering, Draco leans sideways, all the way until his head is in Harry’s lap. It’s a comforting weight, and Harry instinctively puts his hand in Draco’s hair to stroke. It’s dry—Draco must’ve charmed it—and Draco shivers as he pulls his legs up onto the bed.
“Yes, that’s right,” Hermione says, but then her eyebrows crease. “Shouldn’t you have been debriefed?”
Harry is stunned. He hadn’t even thought it was a possibility. “Why?” he asks. “Why change your mind?”
Or rather, he hates coming off of it more than anything, hates the drawn out minutes of heartbreak, hates the confusion that comes after that when his feelings try to right themselves. He hates not feeling anything for Malfoy anymore, hates how worn and lonely it leaves him for hours afterwards. He’s so tired of hating Malfoy too, of pushing against him, but that’s all he has left when the potion leaves him empty inside.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, and his expression turns soft and apologetic. “Harry,” he says then, and Harry’s heart clenches. “It’s always been real.”
Draco sighs and turns his head, lying down fully on top of Harry, the weight of him comforting as he tucks his face into Harry’s shoulder. “It’s really not. You shouldn’t fuck your best friends. Why do you think Pansy and I stopped talking?”
“I do,” Harry says. He doesn’t even have to think about it—the yearning is throbbing in his chest stronger than ever.
Draco closes his eyes, letting out a long sigh. When he opens them, he’s looking at Harry with a gloomy expression. “I can’t stop wanting to kiss you,” he admits, voice rough. “I think about it all the time—isn’t that ridiculous? It’s my own fault I can’t, and yet… I want it, so badly.”
,” Potter says finally. “Don’t… don’t tempt me, please, Draco. I don’t want to do that to you again.”
Malfoy shifts beside him, turning a page in the book he’s holding, and his knee very lightly knocks against Harry’s. Then Malfoy looks up at him, his gaze catching on Harry’s, and time stops as they lock eyes.
It looks like he’s in a Muggle motel room. The sheets are rumpled, and the room is mostly bare, save for a blank piece of parchment lying on the table.
“If you don’t want it to be obvious then get off of me, you git,” Harry says, shoving at him, and Draco snorts and peels himself up, curling into the other side of the sofa.
he had seen Potter earlier at Bentley’s. But it had only been for a few seconds, so he can’t bring himself to actually believe it—what if it was simply a trick of his own mind, after all?
The office. Some sort of urgent memory pricks at the edges of his consciousness, something about one of the orders that came into their warehouse earlier that morning, but he’s too sleepy to remember it fully.
Draco nods, trying to calm himself down, and suddenly he thinks of watching Potter awkwardly fumble his way around with Patil during Yule Ball in fourth year. Merlin, he does hope that Potter’s gotten better at dancing since then, although there’s no guarantee he’ll even get to watch Potter do it so the point’s rather moot.
Draco jolts awake, panting, sitting up in his bed and cursing the intense wave of loneliness that immediately washes over him.
He doesn’t receive a response for several hours, and when he finally does receive an owl, the note from his mother is brief. She doesn’t seem cross with him at the very least. However, she does threaten him into sending her his new address, which he does with haste.
They’re lounging by the pool, laying side by side in lawn chairs, and the sun is turning the sky purple-pink as it sets.
,” Draco says, and the pain is so bad there are tears forming in his eyes. “Shit, just make it stop.”
As it turns out, they don’t even make it to the bed. Draco Apparates them straight to his room, and then Potter’s on him, biting at the skin of his neck again in a way that Draco’s sure will leave a mark. He doesn’t care. Potter’s
“No,” Malfoy snaps. Then he sighs, bringing his free hand up to rub at his temple. “Merlin. This is impossible.”
Harry looks down at the table, feeling miserable. “I don’t know. But—” He looks up at Draco. “But I do know that the next two months are going to be fucking awful if we can’t stop going off on each other.”
“Draco…” Potter says quietly, and Draco prepares himself for the inevitability of his words, for him to say,
He turns then and leans on Mother’s shoulder and cries and cries. It’s as if he is a child again, crouched in the entryway of the Manor, having fallen and skinned his knee.
, the weight of his own past crushing him because he could never be good enough to atone for it, never—
“You should leave now,” Draco says, because at any moment he might cry again and then this whole façade will be ruined.
“So, er,” Potter says, as the lift comes to a stop and they step out into the Atrium. “We’ll go home to change and meet up at the club?”
“I don’t,” Draco maintains, but his voice is shaky and his body is on fire and somehow Potter is leaning in and Draco feels like he’s going to explode.
But he’s leaning into Harry anyway when Harry pulls him closer, when they share a kiss that’s nearly gentle, when Harry finds his hand and squeezes it tight.
“Seems like he got dumped, at least to me,” Ron said on Saturday night, his voice floating in from the kitchen when they thought Harry was sleeping.
Astoria gives him a look that says she doesn’t fully believe him, but sighs, shrugging. “Well, even if you hate him… that’s better than nothing, isn’t it?”
“It’s fine,” Malfoy says, mouth twisting. “He doesn’t know. He went to Azkaban before I first started showing the signs, and we haven’t really spoken since.”
“Oh,” Harry breathes, a sudden flush of warmth blooming between his ribs despite the guilt that wants to devour him.
Strangely, the Hat pauses, seeming to eye McGonagall—now Headmistress—before opening its mouth again. McGonagall’s eyebrows are arched as high as Harry’s seen them, and a whisper of confusion drifts through Harry’s mind. “
Harry thinks of how it would feel if Ron or Hermione were to leave him and his stomach immediately turns. He understands. “I’m sorry,” he says again. “Really.”
The words beat like wings inside his chest. Draco couldn’t ignore them even if he wanted to; The Dark Lord’s wheezing voice is branded into his mind, repeating them over and over, growing louder and louder until every time is like the whack of a hammer into his skull:
“If this is your way of apologizing, I should let you be rude to me more often,” Harry says, feeling a little smug.
“It’s a shame about the mirror,” Harry says, and Draco’s glad Harry can’t see him when a flush immediately springs onto his face.
Draco’s fingers tightened on his arm. “When you got sick... she figured it out, that we were—that we were romantically involved. Or she guessed, at least. And she thought that bringing me back might fix you, so they pulled me out of Azkaban.” He scoffs. “Turns out that your well-being was worth enough to the Ministry to rethink the charges… That, and they found the real perpetrator of the bombing, so I suppose they didn't have a choice but to let me go.”
The man does leave then, without another look back, and then Draco is left staring at Potter through the glass.
“Yeah,” Harry says, mouth twisting. “I loved him. And he’s gone, and every day—every day I walk by the Veil, and sometimes it’s all I can think about.”
“I’m mainly trying to get the most accurate representation of Muggle genetics as possible,” Hermione explains. “I’ve read a lot of scientific papers, but I want to make sure I’m clear on the background before I begin designing spells, and even then I’m not sure it’s possible—I’d have no idea what to target.”
He raises his wand, nearly forgotten in his hand, and Summons the one dildo he owns, curved and just a bit thicker than his own cock. Then he takes a deep breath, casting lube and preparation spells—he really hates preparing himself this way because the stretching is very nearly too intense all at once—but he can’t be bothered to reach behind himself at this angle, and besides he thinks he might come if he tried. So he squeezes his eyes shut while the spell eases him open. It’s over in just a few seconds.
Sure, okay, maybe he left Potter’s name in the room permissions sort-of-a-little on purpose. But that didn’t mean he thought Potter would
The club’s not so bad, he reflects once his cup is empty and he’s half-buzzed, and he Vanishes the cup as he looks around the room for Malfoy. He can’t see him, which is a shame. He’s not sure he wants to dance by himself.
Ah, fuck. Maybe the batch of Amortentia has gone off from sitting in the vial for so long—Harry’s still fixating on the unhappy things from their past, and Draco feels a pang of sadness at that. He doesn’t
And Malfoy’s barely speaking to him as it is. Harry doesn’t need to upset the fragile balance of their almost-friendship any more than he already is, because more than anything he just wants to be near Malfoy.
Well, that was a relief, because Harry may or may not been thinking about kissing Malfoy again, and he didn’t know if he wanted Malfoy to know that. He bit his lip, trying to return his thoughts to the previous conversation. “You know… If we wanted to eat together… I s’pose it’d have to be later, after the CRAP stuff is over. There are too many people here.”
Down the table, Neville gasps, and Ginny lets out an ‘Oh, Merlin.’ Harry glances furtively around the table, noticing that everyone suddenly looks a little more somber. “Sorry—what does that mean, in practice?” Harry asks, feeling a little clueless.
Potter laughs, and Draco might be mad at him for that except for the fact that he’s so unfairly attractive when he does it, his head tipping back and his entire face lighting up with joy. “What? You haven’t told me what you wanted yet,” Potter says, and Draco feels his own face flare crimson.
“Ah—” Somehow, Harry is still caught off guard hearing those words from Draco’s mouth. Suddenly, he’s so, so warm, flushed with happiness in a way he’s never felt before. “I love you,” he repeats, grinning at Draco, even when Draco rolls his eyes.
“Well, I’m being honest with you now, okay?” Harry shoots back. “Look. I want you. I want you a lot. Okay? And maybe we can ignore it, and it’ll go away, and if that’s what you want then fine, I’ll deal with it. But if that’s not what you want...” He takes a deep breath, startled to realize that he’s nearly on the edge of tears. “But if there’s any chance you
Harry flushes but says what he’d meant to say anyway. “It was nice,” he finishes, and Draco’s posture doesn’t change, but he blinks in surprise or maybe pleasure.
“Yeah, I know,” Potter says, averting his eyes. “But it’s… I dunno.” He sighs. “It’s nice not to be alone.”
“Have you?” Harry asks, skating his gaze over Draco above him, his slitted eyes, his fangs, his pale skin and his scars.
Harry makes a face and bids him farewell as he disappears from the flames. Then he stares at the paper for another moment before shaking his head and heading to the living room.
It’s not something Harry’s ever considered. But he can admit that he needs it, because he’s not okay, not right now and maybe not for a long while. “...Okay,” Harry agrees, because he wants to be better too, he truly does.
Potter thinks on it, then nods slowly. “Thanks for—you know,” he says, looking down at where their bodies are touching, and thank fuck Draco had been too worried earlier for his cock to respond to Potter’s warmth.
without thinking about Potter now, it seems. He thought that getting fucked at Bentley’s would help him forget, but then there was that vision of Potter in the window, and now it’s even
“Okay,” Potter says, nodding slowly, and Draco wonders why he’d even asked. They’re still naked, he realizes, and it’s not until Potter gently squeezes his elbow that Draco looks up and realizes Potter’s smiling at him.
“Salazar, that’s odd to hear from you,” Draco says, making a face. “I’m not calling you Harry, by the way.”
And the rest of the world kept on going too after he died, after the war, after Voldemort. For the most part Harry’s fine—except for that one tiny part of him that has stopped. He has no idea how to start it again, so sometimes he gets lost in time, the frozen part of his soul getting caught on memories like clothes on branches in the Forbidden Forest. Sometimes he forgets where he is, his mind throwing him all the way back to the panic that was the end of the war, to the hardness of lying on the forest floor, to the sheer horror of the Battle at Hogwarts and the blankness of an empty King’s Cross.
“Just one,” Malfoy says then, voice haughty, tantalizing. Harry bites his lip, and then sure enough, he feels the touch of a lube-slicked finger teasing at his entrance. ‘
Hermione stepped gracefully through the Floo. Ron whooshed in behind her, stumbling slightly upon landing. “Hey Harry!” Ron gave him a bear hug, thumping him on the back, and he tried his best not to wheeze.
Potter is distant the next time they meet, and it puts Draco on edge. Draco can’t tell at all what’s running through his head, and he’s afraid to ask, so he doesn’t.
Hermione wrinkles her nose. “Technically it’s my day off. I went in anyway, but I told myself I could take an extra-long lunch break today. Speaking of which,” she says, sliding the fourth generation of her beaded purse off of her shoulder and pulling out a couple of sandwiches. “Here.”
God. “Okay,” Harry says, and then, fuck it—he shifts even closer on the bed so he can press their hips together.
Swallowing down the sudden, intense fear that’s lodged itself into his throat, Harry hurries to follow him.
,” Draco says, his brow furrowing. “I told you I didn’t want—” He cuts off and shakes his head. “Fuck. All right, I did want it, but...”
The kettle goes off behind Harry, so he has an excuse to turn around and hide his face. He wants to scream.
Most of the time, Draco was in the dungeons, presumably working on potions. One time, Harry spied him in the kitchens. He contemplated going down and joining him, but decided against it—if Draco wanted him there, he would have asked to hang out after dinner. He wasn’t going to intrude on a potentially private moment.
Draco takes longer in the shower than Harry would expect him to, and it makes Harry nervous, his stomach twisting into knots as he sits on his bed and waits.
“Fuck, sorry,” Draco says, flushing as he turns away. He’s wearing Harry’s t-shirt now, and seeing him in it strikes a tender note in Harry’s heart. “I got distracted.”
“I don’t think it can be fixed,” Granger—or Granger-Weasley now, which is really far too long, so Draco supposes he ought to just call her Hermione at this point—says, snapping shut the thick tome in front of her and worrying at her lip.
Malfoy looks—not good. He looks more like the Malfoy from sixth year than the one Harry’s used to seeing nowadays—the Malfoy who was gaunt and stressed and seemed as if someone could snap him in half if they tried. He’s not quite
Harry swallows. “Okay,” he says, clenching his fists into the covers as he readies himself for the blow. Malfoy’s attracted to him, wants to sleep with him, even. And even if that admission is all Harry’s going to get—at least he hasn’t been imagining it all.
“Do I look like I care?” Draco says, scowling. But he takes a seat across from Harry anyway, crossing his arms. “Whatever. Let’s just do these forms.”
brilliant, though,” he says, and Draco’s face softens, making him go all warm inside. “It’s a shame we’re not regularly partnered.”
,” Draco says, grabbing his arm. His voice is smaller then, when he says, “I don’t... I don’t want to go to Azkaban.”
Harry’s wondered what exactly his ex was thinking for the whole two years since, but he hasn’t had the courage to write and ask.
Draco’s lost track of how many times they’ve met. Every time he deludes himself into thinking that this will be the time he does it, that this will be the time he casts, and every time he looks at Potter’s face, soft in the dim motel light, and puts the killing off for another day.
“Fuck,” Potter sighs, and then he kisses him softly, just once, making Draco gasp. “You—you mean that?”
“I get it,” Harry said, soft. “Or  I don’t. I don’t get it, but I can imagine and I’m sorry, Malfoy. I’m sorry you don’t get to see your dad on his birthday.”
“Whatever, yeah,” Malfoy said, in that sloppy way that told Harry he was losing whatever control he had. He sounded almost desperate as he said, “Do whatever you want.”
Harry reached out and nudged Ron. “I don’t think Hermione’s going to want a tea towel, to be honest with you. She might be a bit put out by it.”
Harry wasn’t sure what they were doing until Ron said, loudly, “You see now how the strange creature, Harrifucus Potterus, cannot seem to hold a note but how that doesn’t bother him. It actually acts as a defence mechanism.”
“…loved that album since I first heard it. To me it’s perfect for a wintry night, or at least a rainy one. With only a few minutes left in the hour, I’d like to read a poem for you by Amiri Baraka. It’s called ‘As a possible lover’.
Draco apparated onto the road to the manor, January wind buffeting his face. Grey clouds moved quickly and low overhead. He looked into the distance—really, it was less of a road and more a path, since muggles rarely ventured here with their automobiles. Though it was midday, there was still a dusting of frost on the ground. It crunched beneath Draco’s shoes as he walked on the tufts of frozen grass, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the cold. He needed to buy warmer robes, but he knew he couldn’t afford them.
He laughed to himself as he bounded up, taking them two at a time, seeking the solitude of Regulus’s room to read it again. On the way up, he flipped the letter over.
Sighing in relief, Draco made to leave, eager to slip out the door before anyone could catch up to him.
Draco felt faint. So Potter was a werewolf, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything. The person writing him could be anyone, and there was no indication he might be right about the werewolf thing, except Potter’s—someone’s—implication that he was. More importantly, he thought as he glared across the table, Pansy had known, and she hadn’t told him.
Harry doesn’t go back to the garden for three nights, until Draco practically abducts him and drags him there.
“You’re very sure in your opinion,” Draco said, glancing at him shrewdly. He took a sip, deciding to attribute the warming in his face to the whisky and not the way Goldstein’s leg pressed briefly against his thigh.
“If I could make a suggestion?” Without pausing, he continued. “While I’m sure your show is riveting—”
Draco never asks why Harry keeps coming back to the garden, and though Harry feels oddly compelled to tell her, he never says. Perhaps because the real reason is too revealing, or because he doesn’t really know why himself.
Draco turns around, gently placing the flower inside Harry’s outstretched hand. “Look inside,” they say.
Cries rose through the room as more children were waking up, both at the noise and the pain. “Contain them!” Harry heard a cloaked figure yell, but several were already bounding wildly across the room, crashing into aurors and enemy alike.
Harry paused, waiting for Jenkins to reply. His ears strained for sounds of movement, anything other than the forest’s deadly calm. His head whipped around as a starling took flight overhead, setting his heart racing. The band heated.
, Jenkins said again. But Harry heard a faint whimper from below, and his heart leapt into his throat.
The Aurors had given up on shield charms and were attempting to stun them, Harry registered vaguely, a growl rising in his throat.
Right. So this was why Pansy had insisted on him coming. So much for her needing a buffer from the amorous attentions of one Terry Boot. He didn’t know whether he wanted to yell at her or prostrate himself at her feet.
It’s long and gleaming, falling like water down his back, except for the tendrils gently woven together at the top, making a tiny little cup. The bowtruckle is dipping the ends of it in the corner of Malfoy’s parted mouth, wetting the strands slightly before threading them together. Harry thinks Malfoy might have a conniption when he wakes.
“How can I help yo—oh,” he says, mouth suddenly twitching in amusement. It’s not quite a smile, but Harry will take what he can get.
The door opened before he even reached the top step. Luna beckoned him inside, her hair half up in a small bun, wisps floating around her face.
The wall behind her exploded, and the blue light of a shield charm rose in an instant. “Thanks Greengrass!” she called, eyes trained on Greyback, whose hood had slipped off, face transforming as he stared her down, baring pointy yellow teeth.
At Draco’s confusion, Goldstein leaned towards him, pointing at his menu. “I’m partial to a good firewhisky myself,” he said pleasantly, tapping it with his wand. A crystal glass tumbler with smoking amber liquid appeared on the table. “See what you think.”
Harry slipped back into consciousness at that same soft voice from the wireless, which said, “That last tune is ‘Blue in Green’, the third track on Miles Davis’s album
“It’s not like I was out of my mind, though.” Harry said. “It was my decision.” Harry thought back. “Well… sort of.” At their concerned looks, he clarified. “I kind of locked myself out. Then I came here.”
She clasped her fingers over her knee and looked at him pointedly. “So you’ve finally come to visit your dying mother. I thought you’d forgotten all about me.”
Pansy, who had been rummaging in a drawer, paused and pulled out a silky green slip dress. “How should I know?” she said, chucking it on the bed where it landed on Draco’s face. “Whoops, sorry.”
Harry huffed in contentment and settled in for a long night, watching the shadows move slowly across the walls.
Harry huffed a laugh and closed his eyes. He could make out muffled footsteps and the soft sound of voices from inside.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Better not.” He shuddered to imagine what Tipsy Harry would be like as a wolf, on top of his already unpredictable personality. Wolfsbane made him more docile; rather than displaying protectiveness to the point of violence, he merely felt a strong urge to be with his pack. Which right now, was Rose, Ron, and Hermione.
So grateful to fools_errand for the help and encouragement on this chapter. Aiming to update weekly.
“I second this,” Harry said from his seat at the kitchen table, crossing his legs and uncrossing them again once he realized how much of his leg was on display. They ached with the movement, though the feeling was rapidly fading.
at 5:58 a.m., and could have cried in relief when he saw the studio door opening to admit Lee, who would be in charge of the 6 a.m. national news segment. Draco watched as Lee slipped into Jasmine’s observation room, smiling fondly at the conjured orange sofa. He bent down and gently nudged her shoulder, murmuring something in her ear. When her eyes opened, she smiled up at him.
Harry gritted his teeth and tried to stand, but stumbled to the ground once again. The wolf in his arms yelped, and as Harry felt the tendrils of unconsciousness creep in, there was a weak bite on his hand, barely breaking the skin.
He’s walking the familiar path he’s traced with his eyes many times before, imagining the steps Malfoy might have taken minutes, maybe hours earlier. All the while he’s wondering alternately what they are doing in the forest, and what he’s doing following them in. It’s the place of his death, and yet something about them overcomes the dread and acute sorrow of the place.
“You know, Hermione said the same thing,” Goldstein said. “She took the class and found it riddled with inaccuracies. Their history is interesting, but it’s definitely not a practical guide for living among them.”
“Oh, that!” he said. “Well, you might be a smidge more tactful next time, but it’s nothing we weren’t all thinking,” he said warmly. “No, I need you for something else. Here, ” he said, passing Draco the parchment.
Jenkins nodded. “Okay. Unconscious ones first though.” She made her way towards the far end of the room, directing the other aurors to some of the youngest, their hair matted, limbs lying at awkward angles on the floor.
Ron grinned. “Now, now, ” he said lightly, setting the eggs cooking on a low flame. “But really, I actually like it a lot.”
Harry felt his eyes flutter shut, even as he was overcome with the desire for more than just the fractured voice in wireless. He wanted more than to stay wide awake in the night waiting for a brief brush with that feeling—the warm, soft one, that eased the wolf in him. The one that kept him coming back.
?” Boot said in a harsh whisper as she sat next to him. Draco took the empty side across from them, suddenly dreading the next hour and a half.
“Thanks,” Harry said. He was well used to Luna’s creative approach to potion-making, which was enough to make Hermione flatly refuse her concoctions. Harry, on the other hand, had enough experience with her hangover cures to give him full confidence in the safety of her brews. Wolfsbane was a temperamental potion at best, but Luna had an intuition that worked well on most occasions. Harry vividly remembered one bottle of shampoo that had dyed his hair pink for weeks. Though now that he thought about it, that might have actually been the intended effect.
He approaches it invisibly, whispering a silencing spell so as not to disturb what is taking place. He almost can’t believe his eyes.
Harry doesn’t believe that for a second. Draco never approaches him inside, except that once in the library. Harry’s always thought he was uncomfortable with that, so he doesn’t usually go up to him either, no matter how many lingering glances they share in class. “No, what is it?” he asks, now getting worried. Maybe Draco is tired of this, of him. Most people are, Harry especially.
Harry huffed in relief once the transformation was complete. The pain, though still dully present, gave way to an antsy feeling, his nose twitching, mind itching to explore. Instinctively, he knew he was a young wolf, and inexperienced. He needed space, but for reasons he could no longer completely grasp, he could not leave the room. He growled impatiently, pacing in circles, his wide paws thudding heavily on the floor, the only sounds in the room his breathing and the low crackle of the wireless.
On a cloudy day, muted light filtering into the DAHM classroom, Harry chances a glance at Malfoy again.
Harry grinned. When he’d told her how he’d almost been sorted there, she had laughed for about five minutes straight, only stopping to gasp, “Draco, he—” before dissolving into laughter again.
“So What” dissolved into “Freddie Freeloader”, a transition so subtle Draco almost missed it, lost in his thoughts as he was. He let it play, relishing in a little break from the talking. Something Draco loved about the night shift, much to his chagrin, was his complete control over the material. When the job was turned over to him, the night program frankly could not have been worse. He’d listened to about twenty minutes of the last employee’s pithy attempts at wit and a good music taste, until he literally couldn’t withstand any more of it.
“Would you like to go? With me, I mean.” Goldstein shifted his weight, the only indication he wasn’t completely at ease.
“Oh, Harry,” she said, sighing. “I know he’s not. But if he is, he’s really missing out, you know that?”
“I apologize for my behavior today,” Draco said stiffly. “I meant no disrespect to you… or Ernie…” he trailed off.
The garden looks different in the day—more normal, as if it’s waiting for night to come alive. Or maybe, as if it’s waiting for Draco.
“Haven’t you been listening to Olarinmoye? You’re controlling it through denial, and it’s never going to work.”
She pulled back and poked him as well, saying “You too. Yasmin, why haven’t you brought him here before?”
She chewed thoughtfully. “Not really. The way I see it, there are a couple options. Either your wolf somehow feels that you know him personally, perhaps from listening so frequently, or you do know Elio, you just don’t know that you know him.”
Boot turned to Pansy, finally seeming to acquiesce to her increasingly overt attempts to get him to shut the fuck up.
“Again,” she said, rolling her eyes. “How should I know? You were the one who was obsessed with him in school.”
Draco seems to sense his confusion, looking up at him. “In potions,” they continue, “we only use the seeds. If you eat them fresh and whole, you actually
Draco was quick to say his pleasantries and be off, his eyelids drooping as he walked numbly to the flat he shared with Pansy. He stumbled through the doorway and had barely taken his shoes off before he was in his bed, dead to the world.
“Also, I’ve been asked to announce that the dog-sitter position advertised last Friday has been filled. It seems the lovely couple will get to enjoy their moonlit adventures uninterrupted…”
No, Draco liked it nice and quiet. It was an advantage on the night shift, his inability to fall asleep. In fact, the job was almost perfect for him, which Draco intensely resented. Landing a job as a host on the WWN had been nothing short of a miracle, but what he really wanted was to entertain people on air during the day. During the morning bustle of daily activity, breakfast joy, the commute to work. During the evenings of relaxing on the sofa, cooking dinner, drinks after. During primetime.
In Professor Olarinmoye’s class, Harry learns he has an affinity for fire. It sparkles on the tips of his fingers, but when he gets it wrong, he only makes smoke. Of course, everyone can master each of the forms, but somehow this makes him feel destructive, dangerous. He hates it.
The letter slipped out of his grasp onto the quilt, now illuminated by a beam of white light in the darkness. He shuddered, shutting his eyes as his fingers once again morphed into claws, his frame expanding and contracting. In the hopes it would ease the unbearable ache, he tried to relax, shoving his nose into the pillow near where the letter lay and breathing in and out until he could feel his body settle into its shape.
Jasmine turned around, one arm still around the woman. “Draco, this is Senalat. When I first came to England I was so homesick I came here almost every day,” Jasmine said, looking down at her fondly.
“Is in more danger from other things than my association with you, as you well know. Besides,” he said. “I know nothing about galas. You’d be doing me a favor.” Few people were aware of this, but Narcissa was extremely generous once she deemed a person worthy of it. She also couldn’t resist a chance to be owed a favour.
Nothing but the buzzing of magic growing steadily stronger gave away the cellar when Harry found it. He cast a melting charm, which revealed a smooth wooden trapdoor. Someone had been here recently. He sent the coordinates on the band.
After a lengthy pause, Draco offered, “You also seem like not an absolute prick. Unlike your friend in there.” He nodded his head towards the restaurant.
Draco made a futile attempt to snatch it back, before she caught it in her other hand, holding it away from him.
,” Draco says, stepping back and turning to place the woven black nest on the table. “But I like it this way.” He makes a shooing motion with his hand. “Now piss off, will you?”
Draco’s glow is still vaguely purple, but not so much that when they turn their face towards him in apology, Harry can’t see the way they’re looking at him still. Silent and burning.
He smiled. “I won’t be able to, but I know how you might find someone,” he said. “Do you ever listen to the wireless?”
Narcissa rolled her eyes. “Boys,” she muttered. Still, she was smiling, still looking at the ornate wireless with a fond expression Harry didn’t quite think it deserved. The song faded into the quiet of the room.
She laughed. “In this case, yes. Come on,” she led him to a small restaurant with a faded sign that said
“Well what do you suggest?” Hermione sniffed. “I could use the distraction, and it’s not like we can watch him every full moon…” she trailed off, a funny sort of smile on her face.
” someone shouted, blasting a hole in the roof of the cellar. Bright moonlight shone inside, and the howls of the young wolves grew deafening.
Instead, he said, “Difficult, at first. There was a steep learning curve, especially because I knew next to nothing about muggles.”
Draco really ought to name it by now, seeing as they were becoming frenemies. Perhaps he’d call it Icarus, but maybe it was a bit too cruel to attribute such a terrible fate to the bumbling little bird. It was tapping at the window, wings erratically bumping into the glass, shaking raindrops from its head.
Harry’s shoulders slumped. They needed to be harvested by the light of the full moon. Luna knew he was a werewolf, but ever since her time in the manor, she would occasionally…forget. Usually it was something small; telling a story she’d already told him the previous week, coming by to visit when he’d told her he would be on a mission.
“How did you know I was here?” Harry rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. It’s aching now, after falling in a strange position against a tree.
The hand comes down again, and with it a small laughing bowtruckle, maybe a young one, though Harry can’t really tell. Malfoy tickles her with the first finger of his other hand. “There you are,” he whispers. Harry is struck with the realization that he can’t possibly be just
When he reaches the forest, he hesitates before going in. Peering in through the trees, it’s nearly pitch black.
Just as Harry puts the second berry on his tongue, the first one hits. Colours filter in from the corner of his vision until he’s squinting at the brightness. Draco seems to be undergoing the same predicament.
Draco didn’t understand why he needed to be here. Normally, the WWN were happy to let him skive off the meetings—he had no collaborations, and no one in the room save Jasmine and Lee were willing to come within six feet of him. He was tempted to announce very politely that the ex-Death Eater plague wasn’t catching, for Merlin’s sake. As it was, he was the recipient of several dark looks every time he so much as shifted in his chair. Over the years since the war, he’d come to learn that people didn’t tend to appreciate reminders of his existence.
Resignedly, he let the bird in, where it ruffled its feathers, spraying their sofa and nearby houseplants with a shower of rain water. Miraculously, the envelope was dry.
It’s not like he was still clinging onto memories from school for Merlin’s sake; if anything it was a feeling—wanting to be close to someone, to mean something to them in a way not entirely covered by friendship, to be constantly and inexplicably amazed by them. He’d tried, in the years since, to find it with someone else, but every dinner, every walk in the park left him missing something.
When Pansy said nothing, Boot shrugged, sipping his beer. “Anyhow, we’ve still got some of them under stasis, but it’s not looking good. The aurors are all imbeciles—I mean really, stunning five year olds? What were they thinking?”
Harry looks down. His body is still invisible—a small protection against the brilliance of that expression.
Abandoning attempts to sleep, he settled in an armchair next to the fireplace, mug of tea in hand. His mind was scattered, frayed. It had been ever since the raid. After the odd events of this afternoon, it was even more: Malfoy’s sudden reappearance in his life long after he’d given up on seeking him out. The secret he thought Narcissa would have told her son. But he didn’t want to think about that, either.
“Wait, there’s no—” Draco said, but Senalat was already disappearing into the kitchen, “—silverware,” he finished lamely.
Lee had just laughed, running long fingers through his thin locs. “I hope not,” he said. “Hardly anyone listens, so just come up with something.”
They knew he was good—that’s why they’d hired him. Draco had a way with speaking, something instilled in him since childhood, of making everything he said sound interesting and important, and letting people be at ease with it. It was a dangerous ability, as his father had handily demonstrated, but nowadays Draco only wanted to use it to connect to people without being spat at.
Harry moved towards an unconscious boy, whose hands were beginning to sprout tufts of light grey fur. Scooping him up, he turned to run up the stairs when the crack of apparition sounded through the room.
Draco guessed that was a compliment. “Have you always been such an astute judge of character,” he asked, “or do I bring it out in you?”
“I’ve been thinking,” Hermione said, sitting down on the sofa next to Ron. Harry situated himself in a cosy armchair he’d helped Hermione pick out from an estate sale. Helping, in this case, had involved Harry trying on about thirty ridiculous hats with various feather arrangements while Hermione occasionally asked him for his opinion on the furniture.
Either Pansy didn’t notice the ire in his voice, or simply didn’t care. “Be nice, Terry,” she said sweetly. “Where’s Goldstein, anyway?”
, and leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head. “So What” streamed into the room and vibrated outwards in waves, invisibly. Draco imagined them swimming to the homes and wireless devices of wixen all over London, awake in their beds, nursing a cup of tea, or on a nighttime wander through deadened streets.
After Draco had dodged several hexes in between trying to explain that no, he hadn’t technically eaten her leftovers, Pansy stretched out onto the sofa still in her green healer’s robes. She’d spelled them a paler shade than the usual lime green, which both flattered her and made her stick out like a sore thumb among the other St. Mungo’s staff. But Pansy was competent, and intimidating, and was never forced to change them back. At least that’s how she told it, anyway. You never knew with Pansy.
“I mean, you told us you would be fine on your own, that you’d stay in your room during the transformation—”
Harry shook his head. “I dunno about before, but it’s good now.” He glanced up at Hermione. “You guys might like it—there’s a bit on at 3 a.m. called witching hour?”
They smile enigmatically. “Many things. It’s one of the most powerful healing essences known to magic.”
) and muttering, “I think that’s my cue. See you, Narcissa.” Then he scurried out of the drawing room and out into the hall, the bang of the front door echoing behind him. His mother watched him go with a disturbingly fond expression on her face.
“Right here,” someone said from behind Draco, and he turned to see one of the most gorgeous humans he’d ever had the privilege to set eyes upon. Goldstein’s wavy blond hair was brushed back artfully from his face, and he wore a crisp burgundy shirt just slightly open at the collar, revealing a golden amulet in the hollow of his throat. Draco caught a whiff of cologne as Goldstein slipped into the booth next to him, and it washed over him in a haze. He looked over surreptitiously at Pansy, who was smirking in his direction.
He sees Draco lying on the ground and wonders when that happened. They are glowing a bright purple that’s nearly violet, a violet that’s nearly blue. It’s beautiful.
Now that Harry was safely ensconced within his best friends’ kitchen and wrapped in a frilly dressing gown of Hermione’s—the only thing Ron would let him wear—he was beginning to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
Draco felt his chest turn cold as he tucked his shaking hands under the table. Suddenly, he needed to leave. He nudged Goldstein, who was staring at Boot, a perturbed expression on his face.
Harry turned around in recognition, and found several pairs of eyes looking at him with sheer terror. He whimpered, the sudden surge of energy giving way to sharp pain in his leg, and collapsed into the snow. They were advancing on him, he realized, panicked. Gathering his last bit of energy, he stood and bounded into the forest.
“I worked in the muggle world for a while…” he said, looking down at his plate. It was too bad he was no longer hungry—the food really was delicious.
Harry does. Little multicoloured lights flicker in different shades from within the berries, lending an effect similar to Christmas fairy lights.
“Give it here,” Harry said, feeling a jolt of excitement. By now, he hadn’t really expected Elio to respond to his letters—there’d been three of them, including the ad he’d sent in for Luna the other day, or with no response.
“And he is being appropriately thankful for it, especially considering I only did it for you. At least he visits me.”
Harry kisses him. It’s familiar, but at the same time completely new. He’s not suffocating the fire.
They summon a vial from inside their robes, and siphon the essence of the spindly flower into it. The flame dances inside. Then they tuck the vial into their robes once more, setting the flower down carefully in the center of the garden.
He took a step towards the girl, but was repelled by the wall of magic. Lifting his wand, he began unraveling the threads of the barrier between them. By now, several others—the ones who were conscious, at least—were crying out, though he could see no signs of a transformation yet. If he worked quickly there would be enough time.
He glanced through the glass into the other room, and saw that Jasmine had conjured a plush orange velvet sofa, upon which she was softly snoring. Trust Miles Davis to lull her to sleep. Draco on the other hand couldn’t sleep to music—it was too interesting. It occupied his mind too much to permit the tendrils of sleep to slip in.
Draco nearly dropped the parchment. Really, he shouldn’t have been so surprised, but he was. Someone was listening. Actually listening. He bit back a squeal.
Harry was too busy laughing to respond. He’d finally sent in the ad he’d forgotten the other night and may or may not have hinted that Ron and Hermione were interested in spicing up their…relationship.
Harry whirled around, spotting the girl he’d seen curled on the floor earlier. Now she was howling in pain, her ears elongating and flattening against her head, eyes yellow and pleading. Without thinking, he ran towards her, and lifted her in his arms.
“—so top off your tea, say a wish and a spell and a ‘Dear merlin thank you for Miles Davis’ and we’ll pop right on with it, shall we? Alright. Onto side two.”
He begins to laugh, overcome with an overwhelming sense of joy as more sparks flow down his fingers into the growing bonfire. Finally, the tension is breaking in his body, giving way to unbelievable relief. The fire is reaching upwards now, nearly as tall as the trees themselves, swirling into the darkening sky. Through the flames, Draco is illuminated against the backdrop of the forest. The magical colors of the garden flash among it, reflecting in Draco’s hair, shining onto his face. The light is flickering in his eyes and Harry loves him.
She barely remembered anything from during the war, but in eighth year, she’d told him that when she was a prisoner in his cellar, Malfoy had smuggled her dittany and what he could take from the kitchen. It was one of the things that softened Harry to him, but it was not enough to mend her struggling mind. It had been at the mercy of Bellatrix for far too long.
Harry looks up at the moon. It’s almost full. It looks close enough to touch; he thinks he can see Draco’s face in it. He looks down. The magic of the invisibility cloak is itself invisible. His body, partially covered by the cloak, ripples in the darkness.
“Nothing!” Harry says. It’s not entirely true, but the only problems Harry has these days are with himself.
He gingerly ripped some of the injera from the edge and grabbed some lamb stew with it. Sauce dripped down his fingers. He put it in his mouth, and moaned.
The rest of the dinner went by in a blur. Draco barely registered the subject moving towards Goldstein’s job, which happened to be helping Granger—Granger-Weasley now, apparently—draft reconstruction legislation to ease the prejudices that contributed to the war. Though it was admirable work, Draco could barely bring himself to contribute anything insightful, so full his mind was of Potter nearly dying, Potter being a werewolf, Potter at the manor with his mother, Potter, Potter, Potter.
“Why would it be?” Boot said. “The only reason witches or wizards would need to live in their world is if they got themselves exiled from ours.”
“Would you like some tea?” she asked, stepping back out into the living room. Harry followed and watched as she moved a teetering pile of books off of one end of the couch and onto the rapidly dwindling floor space, gesturing for Harry to sit.
Everything is glowing—each species of plant in the garden has its own shade, or sometimes multiple. Even the trees around them are emitting a faint red glow. The spindly flower on the floating vine is so bright Harry sees spots for a while after looking at it. Flashes of color move between the trees in the distance, little dots of light scurry around the tree leaves above. Suddenly the world is moving around him and he gingerly lowers himself to the ground before he has the chance to fall over.
He paused, panting heavily, and sniffed the air. It smelled cool and lovely, and a bit like smog. But something seemed quiet. A little too quiet. The wireless! He must have dropped it in the street.
“More than usual, you mean,” Hermione teased. She had a point; Harry’s always been welcome here and had crashed on the sofa more times than he could count. In many ways it felt more like home than Grimmauld Place.
Harry sighed, shivering with the cold, the damp soaking his worn boots. Jenkins was taking her damned time.
“Yasmin, it’s been too long!” came a booming voice from inside the restaurant, before Jasmine was enveloped in a tight hug.
“Cooking, you daft dog!” Ron laughed. “The muggles say breakfast is the most important meal of the day,” he said sagely, pointing a spatula at him.
“Like phoenix tears,” Harry says quietly. He glances at his forearm, where there is no puncture scar.
It becomes a bit of a routine, the addition of this thing to the gardening. It’s harvest time, later than muggle crops since it’s mid November now, and they’ll pick the berries without eating them, curiosity having been satisfied. Draco shows him how to ask the plants for permission to take their leaves, their flowers, and their roots. She explains that they are rare ingredients for healing potions, although they do work wonders on her hair. But by beauty, she says, she means the way they exist and emit magic—the way they’re alive. Harry still thinks Draco is the source of all this beauty anyway.
“Any updates on the case?” Harry said. His mandatory leave had cut him off from being in the know and the Ministry was being tight-lipped as usual about it if the dull news in the Prophet was anything to go by, leaving him to scavenge for scraps of news that Ron offered him. It wasn’t much, since he had been on parental leave up until a few weeks ago.
Maybe it’s his shivering that rustles the leaves on the ground—Merlin knows he’s been too absentminded to purchase a winter cloak—or maybe it’s the slight chattering of his teeth, or maybe it’s simply the way Harry and Draco have always been attuned to each other’s presence, but one evening Draco says, “Ever heard of a warming charm?”
“Pretty sure it’s not just muggles, Ron.” Harry shook his head lightly. Ron sidled up to him, bumping their shoulders together.
“They’d be better off chucking their galleons in the Thames,” Draco muttered. Looking up at Lee, he said, “It’s
The plants almost seem to reach out to Malfoy as they pass by, and in turn they reach out to them, as if the plants themselves are God and Malfoy is Adam.
The one thing they knew very well was that there were upwards of twenty magical children hidden here, under the snow. For what purpose, Harry thought as his stomach twisted in disgust, they could only guess.
“Thanks,” he murmured, taking a sip. “How’s the Sanctuary?” Luna and Neville maintained hundreds of acres of wilderness, one of the last few ancient forests not deforested by muggles since it was hidden by Morgana in the twelfth century. Brocéliande was another, Luna had explained to him, and was located in France.
Draco felt dizzy with relief. He took the parchment, unrolling it. Near the top it said, “MOON-GAZING COUPLE IN SEARCH OF DOG-SITTER.” He looked up at Lee in confusion. “What is this?”
The only sound in the room is ink dripping onto the floor. There is an unreadable expression on her face.
Draco couldn’t bring himself to answer the letter, though it sat weighty in his pocket. He’d taken to fingering it absentmindedly. Which, even to Draco, seemed like an odd thing to do to a letter that could very well have been written by a perfect stranger.
“He was turned,” Goldstein said quietly. “But this is very confidential information—I only know because I work for Hermione, and I was there when she got the call.”
There was no way Goldstein looked like this in school, or Draco would have noticed, no matter how obsessed Pansy thought he’d been with Potter.
Draco smoothed his fingers over the letter. It was impossible. There was no way this was—no. It was just a fan with remarkably similar handwriting to—
“So,” Goldstein said, looking at Boot, who was scowling at the table. “How’s the situation at the hospital?”
Draco turned to him with a sardonic smile. “Who am I going to tell? No one would believe me anyway.”
Jasmine laughed. “What do you think this is? Now you have to come back—she won’t take no for an answer.”
as it swung from the strap between his teeth. Before long, he found himself aimlessly meandering through the streets of London, passing rats scurrying into the gutters, bits of trash blowing across the street, darkened windows, the eerie yellow light of streetlamps leaving reflections in day-old puddles. Eventually the houses began to look familiar again. Many had little potted plants on their porches, illuminated by the moon, which by now was barely visible over the roofs of the buildings.
“Accio,” Hermione said, flicking her wand, and the letter soared into her hand. “Moony?” she said, glancing at the envelope. “Isn’t that the name we—”
“I see no need for us to hear it more than once.” Shit. He hadn’t meant to be quite so harsh. Hoping for some semblance of damage control, he added. “I have no doubt it’ll be up to your usual standards.” He gave his most charming smile.
“Uh huh” Draco replies from where they lie sprawling on the ground, staring up at the sky, eyes wide.
He doesn’t. Instead, he smiles, a secret thing, and gently cuts the hair attached to the nest, slowly floating it to the table, the bowtruckle along for the ride. Tiny tufts of blond stick up in the middle of his head now, an odd kind of mullet.
He wondered what sort of regrets Elio was holding onto, what things he’d done that made him feel so undeserving of redemption. He wondered why, even though they were strangers, the words felt like he’d heard them a million times before. Unbidden, an image of Draco in the eighth year common room in the middle of the night, firelight flickering over his face, rose in his mind.
As the final cacophony of “Space Oddity” came to a close, Draco sat up in his seat, yawning as he gradually turned the volume on the record player to zero. Merlin, but he was tired.
He pitched his voice soft and low, a sound he’d crafted both for the sake of anonymity and for ease of listening, and continued, “But I hope at least some of you have taken some comfort and respite from the endless silence of being awake many-a-night…believe me, I know.” He laughed softly.  “And on that happy note, it’s 3 a.m., I'm Elio Durand, and you’re listening to Hey Moon, the Wizarding Wireless Network’s night show.” He pressed a button on the console, which played a few seconds of a little piano interlude Draco had chosen to replace the gaudy electronic one periodically showcased during the day.
Something tight and wiggly lodges itself in Harry’s chest, and he can’t help but carefully step between the plants on the tiny curved paths Malfoy has walked, is walking. He smells the spindly flower because Malfoy is somewhere else now, partially obscured by the immense leaves of a creeping vine, suspended in midair. It smells sweet, like just after a rain shower or how nectar might taste to a hummingbird.
“I can hear you, you know,” Harry sang, picking lightly at the lace trim on the dressing gown, begrudgingly enjoying the feel of the satin on his skin. He smiled as Hermione rolled her eyes, drawing her robe more tightly around her as she stalked out of the room.
She looked at the wireless. “Muggle music is exceedingly strange.” she said, but her finger was still tapping.
Harry does, if only because that might be the single most civil conversation they’ve ever had, and it was so ridiculous he finds himself smiling about it at random moments throughout the day.
But he simply laughs, and says, “You’re right. But I’ve known you were following me since that first night.”
But Harry trusts Draco, and all of a sudden he finds himself immensely curious. What would magic even look like? The essence of their world, distilled into a visible wavelength. How would it feel to see it?
Across the cellar floor, in utter squalor, lay what had to be more than fifty children, restricted by chains and what Harry recognized as magical barriers preventing them from moving around the room. They were in varying levels of consciousness, some passed out and bleeding, others watching him with deadened eyes.
Draco felt himself flush, unsure how to respond. He looked down at the parchment, skimming it. He blinked in confusion, then read it again more thoroughly. What the fuck?
“No, of course not,” Harry says, weak with relief, reaching out to lightly curl an arm around Draco’s waist.
On the first of December, Harry’s walking through the seventh floor corridor on the way to the DAHM classroom, when he’s pulled behind a tapestry. It takes a minute to catch his breath and ease himself of the tunnel vision.
It was getting chilly out in the wind, and Harry decided he couldn’t just stay here. He walked down the street, wireless still playing the last of
At Harry’s puzzled expression, she added, “It’s when you need a deep connection with someone in order to have romantic feelings for them.”
The plants are still so colourful they hurt his eyes. He squints at them, like looking at a red sun as it’s rising. “Why the…” he trails off, forgetting what he means to say.
“Elio—he’s the host of the nighttime programme—well, he airs ads sometimes. I can send one to him for you if you like.”
Elio’s voice gently lilted, rose and fell, the crackle of the wireless the only indication he wasn’t whispering into Harry’s ear. Something in Harry’s chest curled up contentedly at the sound. He let the voice lull him, finally, into dreamless sleep.
Then when they are done tending to the plants, under the soft blanket of a warming charm, they tend to each other in the dark. Harry’s holding back though, made-up visions of flames engulfing the little white flowers enough to make him wary of letting go of too much of himself. He’s been in his own mind—he knows he’s overwhelming.
There are slightly unripe fruits on the ends of delicate limbs, some thorny, others smooth. Harry pricks his finger and watches a drop of blood soak into the soil, diluted by the rain, which is forming puddles on the ground. He sucks on it to stem the bleeding.
“If you find me so fucking offensive, just ignore me. It’s really not that hard—everyone else seems to manage it,” Malfoy says bitterly, moving to leave.
“Er, I was wondering… ” Harry gestures towards the top of his head. He can feel a little tingling on his scalp, as if from the pressure of very tiny leaf-feet.
Harry’s first transformation was lonely. If it weren’t so excruciating, he’d even consider it to be strangely peaceful.
“I wasn’t expecting to meet you here,” a voice called after him. Despite his better judgement, he turned around. Goldstein was walking briskly towards him, cloak falling gracefully from his shoulders, curls fluttering in the breeze.
Because there in the drawing room of the manor, on a centuries-old chaise, sat Harry Potter, his elbows resting on his knees, head in his hands. Potter’s head jerked up at Draco’s entrance, eyes widening in surprise. Draco felt the breath get knocked out of him a little.
Flickering slowly within the nectar, it burns perpetually and not at all, suspended in space, carefully tucked away within this growing life form for all this time.
He’d changed since then, anyway. Draco had been young, and stupid, and uncharacteristically optimistic—he had not yet learned that good things wouldn’t just come to him anymore, he’d have to crawl towards them, scrabbling for purchase on ever-shifting ground. It was embarrassing enough that he’d once considered Potter one of those good things.
Senalat tsked. “That boy works too much. Every day, on the wireless. I think I hear him more than I see him these days!”
The last thing he saw before transforming was a jet of green light strike the small body against his chest.
Hermione lightly smacked his arm. “What we mean is, put yourself out there. Develop some close friendships and see where it goes. Malfoy can’t be the only one.”
“You’re welcome,” he murmured. They looked at each other, both seeming to agree to lay down their arms, at least for a little while.
So Draco was the only one in the dark. He scowled at Pansy, who was avoiding his eyes. She took a sip from her glass of wine, which definitely hadn’t been there two seconds ago.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Oh fuck, had he really forgotten? He felt his face heat in mortification but was soon distracted by a soft sound coming from his right.
He busied himself looking at the menu, which of course had no prices on it, and therefore was likely far too expensive for Draco to afford. He set about looking for something vaguely appetizing that wouldn’t cost him half his paycheck, when Goldstein laid a gentle hand on his forearm.
There are some nights when he’s so exhausted there’s nothing he can do but sleep, but when he wakes in the dark his only thought is whether Draco is sleeping too, or out there alone.
With the window of time before moonrise closing, Harry’d had no choice but to replace the broken record player beneath the bed, and drag himself into the spare bedroom. But the urge to listen to something hadn’t gone away, so he’d chosen the next closest thing—the old beaten wireless out of which Romulus’s voice had once emerged on Potterwatch.
“Pleasure to meet you,” Draco said, extending a hand. Senalat laughed, and moved to hug him too. After a moment of shock, he gingerly returned it. For such a small woman, she had a significant presence. Her hugs were fantastic.
Would you be interested in a Spotify playlist with all the songs in this fic? Let me know in the comments!
A delicate black slip hung from the end of the curtain rod; bits of green and burgundy silk were draped across the backs of chairs, from the window handles, spilling down small planter hooks dangling from the ceiling. He lifted a lacy thong from on top of the record player before setting it on the coffee table, smiling slightly and thanking the gods his mother hadn’t chosen today of all days—Pansy’s laundry day—to visit.
Harry gently pried her fingers away from his hair and cuddled Rose closer to his chest, which felt like it was going to burst.
“Oh.” Draco said. “Well, since we’re telling secrets and all… I host the nighttime programme on the WWN. You probably haven’t heard of it.”
“—and yes, I do take requests, but I’ll only play them if they’re good. ‘Killer Queen’, everybody.” There was a light click, then the sound of fingers snapping.
“Nothing?” Goldstein raised his perfect eyebrows. Fuck, Draco was making an absolute fool of himself.
There’s a ripple of something, and Harry knows it’s Malfoy. How he knows it’s them and not Luna slipping across the landscape, winding through the shadows and disappearing into the trees, Harry doesn’t know.
Draco fought down a stab of annoyance. “From what I heard, that would hardly have been useful. Muggle studies treats their way of life as a curiosity, not as something wizards assume they’ll have to assimilate to.”
Hermione shrugged. “I’m an expert in legislation, not magical creatures. Maybe you ought to talk to Luna about it. Ron, can you pass the pepper?”
“I may bring it to Madam Pomfrey, or give it to someone when the time is right. It’s not meant to be unused forever. Hoarding it out of greed renders it about as effective as sugar water.”
Despite himself, Draco felt a flutter of excitement. As a child he’d often imagined dressing in fancy robes as he’d watched his parents do, speaking with important people, spreading his influence around. He very much doubted he had much of that anymore.
For the second time in five minutes, Draco resisted the urge to scream in frustration. The last time his mother had visited the flat, she’d looked down her nose at everything in his life until, out of sheer irritation, he’d asked her to leave.
“Alright, lads, that’s enough.” Lee said, looking far too amused for Draco’s liking. “Unless anyone has anything else to add—no? Okay, meeting’s over, everybody.”
Luna smiled. “That would be lovely.” She sipped her tea and drew the shawl tighter around her shoulders. “And how are you, Harry? You seem quiet.”
This morning, though, he was cranky and irritable, and had only managed to snatch three hours of sleep before he was called in. While usually he would attempt to appear as invisible as possible, he made no such effort today.
That sets Harry off again. He rolls to lay on his stomach, a fluttery feeling flying through his chest at the sudden increase in proximity. “But why?” he touches Draco’s eyebrow, then threads a finger through a few strands of their blonde hair.
Luna twirled a strand of hair around a finger. “I believe Neville might. My thoughts keep me occupied, usually.”
Hermione gestured sharply towards Harry. Ron just laughed. “The other baby, love. I’ve got this one.”
As they work, they talk. Sometimes it’s about nothing significant, which means nothing because everything is significant. Sometimes they talk about significant things as if they mean nothing, but they both know they don’t. It’s a steady hum of nothings in between the silence and the dark, yet they somehow feel to Harry like everything.
But he can feel the calming trembling of their magic in the air, and the way they love Malfoy. As if this person is their god and they themselves are Adam.
The afternoon sun shone through sheer white curtains in the living room, and Draco found himself once again surrounded by women’s underwear.
A little while later, Rose was passed to Ron for a bit while Harry and Hermione saw to the dishes and brewed tea for each of them.
Agony ripped through Harry as he stumbled, a searing pain spreading from where the curse had hit his leg. Rowle laughed maniacally.
Draco felt his stomach drop. One of these days he was going to have words with his mother for not telling him things.
Tall trees grew on either side of the path, skeletons reaching out of the frozen soil towards the sky. Along the edge grew a muted green plant with long spindly leaves and stalks that nearly reached Harry’s shoulders. He was familiar with it by now—after all, he’d need to drink it every month for the rest of his life.
The white lace was splattered with sauce. Draco prepared himself for oblivion, and in a weak attempt to shift the blame, pointed towards the culprit.
“Urgh, my brain!” Harry cringed, uncomfortably reminded of the many times he’d accidentally flooed in on them and wanted to gouge his eyes out.
Because after eighth year, the man had disappeared into thin air. After a while, Harry had given up looking for him. He knew the signs of someone who didn’t want to be found.
“I have to say, between you and me, either the dog is a werewolf or the couple are, or there’s some sort of kinky moon sex situation going on, in which case, well. Best not to ask too many questions,” the voice laughed lightly. “On the plus side, your life is likely to get a lot more interesting.”
Heart thudding in his chest, he slipped into the emergency ward, his footsteps echoing back at him from clinical tiles, the almost overpowering scent of cleaning potions wafting from the floor. As he approached the room, he caught sight of Robards. He turned around abruptly, but not soon enough.
“Do you think Potter is a werewolf?” Draco said, staring up at the letter from his prone position on Pansy’s bed.
When he wakes it’s more tangled than usual, which he discovers as he tries to run his fingers through it and they are stuck near his scalp. He stands up and walks across the room.
“Is there anything I can do?” Harry asked. He was getting a bit stir-crazy being inside Grimmauld Place so much.
magic.” They pluck a berry from the vine, and pull Harry closer by the hand, holding it up to his mouth.
The dining room of the restaurant was opulent, small balls of light floating above round tables with deep red tablecloths, little candles and an assortment of flowers sitting in the center of each one. Draco followed Pansy to a booth with velvet upholstery, where a miffed-looking Terry Boot glared up at Draco.
Goldstein laughed, and it somehow made him look more attractive than he already was. “There’s a Ministry gala,” he said. “It’s dead boring, but lots of important people will be there.”
A doe scampered away from the path as Harry walked. The air warmed slightly as he neared the small stone cottage where Luna and Neville lived. Inside the wards, plants grew green and lush, a stark contrast with the sparse landscape outside. The aconite had full, deep purple blooms here. Harry looked around in wonder; Neville must have finally managed the climate charm.
“Then again, what’s a night without a little existential crisis?” Elio said. “Here’s another one, dedicated to all you married folks out there.” There was a muffled sound in the background. The sound crackled, and then—a funk rhythm bubbled out of the wireless. “‘Once in a Lifetime’ by Talking Heads.”
Rose, with impeccable timing, spit up all over the dressing gown. Hermione laughed at Harry’s indignant expression and took pity on him, vanishing the mess and turning to sit at the table.
Ron opened the fridge. “Okay, mate.” he said, pulling out a pack of sausages. “Here’s the deal. ‘Mione and I are running on about four hours of sleep between the two of us, so we’re gonna handle this like adults. You just tell us what happened, and we can figure out where to go from there, sound good?” With a jab of his wand, flames rose under the pan with the sausages, which shortly began to sizzle. He shot Harry a grin, grabbing several more eggs and cracking them into the bowl along with Hermione’s very whisked eggs. “But first, breakfast!” He summoned the whisk.
Narcissa stood and strode towards an old ornate wireless decorated with finely carved wood, the grain shining from beneath gleaming polish. “I’ll go with you,” she said, looking down at it, before turning to face him again, “Someone has to make sure you don’t make a fool of yourself. Do you mind?” She pointed her wand at the wireless. “There’s a programme I rather enjoy.”
“…Though I do feel for the poor animal, as their new minder seems quite scatterbrained. In fact they asked me to air an ad, but unfortunately neglected to send it to me. Anyone with a spare brain to donate is welcome to contact the station.”
He was definitely whining now, a continuous, gut-wrenching sound amplified by the new attunement of his ears, which were flattened against his head in agony. As the last of his anatomy snapped into place, haunches and ankles screaming, he let out a howl that reverberated in the otherwise empty room.
Treats? Harry was not that kind of dog. He wasn’t even a dog, he was a wolf for Merlin’s sake! He stood abruptly, grabbing a handful of floo powder from the mantle.
“It’s not that, exactly,” Harry said, fidgeting slightly. The truth was, he didn’t really want them to see him as a wolf. It was one thing for his friends to know he was one and another to see it firsthand.
Harry sat back against the settee, watching the last ray of sunlight disappear beneath the grand windowsill. Flames flickered, casting shadows around the darkening room. Soft orange light reflected onto Narcissa’s hair and illuminated her face. She really was a beautiful woman, Harry thought. That must have been where Malfoy got it from.
Hermione and Ron would tell him not to, but they are in Australia. So in the evening, Harry fishes his invisibility cloak out from the bottom of his trunk and drapes it over his shoulders. He creeps down the winding spiral steps of the eighth year tower, down seven floors of the grand staircase, careful to skip the missing steps. He quietly walks through the arched hallways of what he’ll always consider his first home, footsteps echoing off the ancient stones, until he reaches the main entranceway.
They work until dawn, when Harry’s hands are a little less clumsy and inexperienced, though significantly more cracked. Draco wordlessly hands him a small jar of hand cream.
“Up here!” Harry yelled, already closing the door to Regulus’s room, where he’d been doing some deep cleaning. He’d also purchased a couple large fuzzy dog beds as well as a rib and a chew toy, in the hopes that it would keep him distracted and prevent him from winding up naked in front of all his friends. Ron and Hermione were more than enough, thank you very much.
It rains in the afternoon, big fat drops falling on the stones just outside the castle steps, thunder rolling overhead. Harry walks through it, all but the ends of his hair kept dry with an impervius charm, to visit the garden, because this is when Draco is in Ancient Runes.
It’s only weeks later, once Malfoy’s grown out her hair again, and after Harry’s seen them heading to the forest nearly every single night, that Harry is overcome by his curiosity.
Just as Harry was dismantling the last of the threads, a clatter of footsteps sounded behind him and Jenkins came into view along with a few other aurors, a thunderous expression on her face.
As the song faded into nothing, Elio’s voice came through again. “Speaking of life choices, I’ve been asked to announce a job opportunity. A lovely couple who enjoy moon gazing, also apparently known as mooning, are in search of a dog-sitter.”
“I meant for tonight,” she said, and only then did Harry notice Rose sleeping in a little carrier Hermione had set on the sofa. He made a beeline towards her, but was careful not to wake her up as he peered down at her tiny face.
Point being, the WWN couldn’t turn him down, but no one wanted to work with him either. So he’d been shunted to the night shift by a somewhat apologetic Lee Jordan, who now ran the network. But Draco was grateful—he harbored no illusion that he would have ever gotten the job without the influence of Lee’s fair judgement.
“Potter,” Robards said, rubbing the space between his thick eyebrows with a weathered knuckle. “You are a safety risk.”
It’s a long time until they move from this embrace, long enough for the colours to fade completely, and for the sun to peek its yellow light through the trees instead.
Harry turned towards the window. The source of the tapping was a disgruntled-looking speckled owl that Harry had never seen before, large wings flapping as it hovered outside. He let it in and it swooped past him, landing on the back of the sofa, ruffling its feathers. It held a cream-coloured envelope in its beak.
“And...” she continued hesitantly, “I think maybe—oh, how do I say this? Maybe your wolf instincts are telling you that we’re part of your… pack?”
Harry looks up, and his heart stutters when he can’t see Malfoy—but there they are, bent over next to a fresh patch of earth. Their wand is pointed at the soil, moving in gentle swirling motions. Soon enough, three tiny green sprouts emerge. The smile on Malfoy’s face nearly makes Harry forget about the garden altogether.
They reach the edge of the forest just as the sun is dipping behind the castle. It casts a long shadow over them as they make their way to the garden. When they get there, it’s still achingly beautiful. The grass surrounding it is frozen and silvery, and some of the frost is resting on the flowers. Harry moves closer and realizes they’re nearly frozen, gradually shriveling up from the cold. Draco leads him to the center of the garden, to the spindly flower. They murmur something Harry can’t hear, then with a sharp movement of their wand, slice it clean off the vine.
“It’s the plants,” they say, taking hold of his hand again. The world is buzzing around them. “Come on.”
“I’m beginning to think he likes her more than us,” Ron said, pouring the two of them a glass of wine.
Oh, Pansy was going to murder him. He looked around anxiously at all the lingerie before hurriedly snatching the letter enclosed in its beak. The owl looked up at him imploringly.
They listened for a while. Narcissa was tapping her index finger on her knee, to Harry’s quiet amusement.
. It’s 10 p.m.” A few jazzy piano notes played through the speaker. “Ever spent a day questioning your life choices? Me too.”
a long time ago. There was no reason his fleeting teenage memories should be taking up this much space in his head.
Draco opened his mouth in indignation. “I am perfectly capable of paying for myself,” he whispered, feeling Pansy’s eyes on him from across the table.
The voice sounded different through human ears. It was the kind of voice that could have belonged to everyone and no one, Harry thought. It was a bit like listening to a close friend, one he’d never met.
“I thought so too,” Harry said, sitting down to eat. “It’s just—you know the wireless programme I listen to? I get… wolf feelings.”
It feels like an eternity that the two of them lie there, staring at each other. Time seems to be moving differently. Harry’s not sure if it’s the berries or just Draco. Maybe they are the same thing.
Harry turned around abruptly and saw it among the cobblestones. He leapt towards it and took it in his mouth once more, the vibrations tickling his mouth, giving him the odd urge to sneeze. Suddenly gripped with exhaustion, he padded up the steps of Grimmauld Place. He tried weakly to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Just fucking great.
Harry inhaled sharply. He realized his hands were trembling and gripped the arm of the sofa to steady them.
They are gracefully walking among the plants, trailing a hand lovingly across their leaves, bending to smell a large spindly flower, hair braided simply and falling down their back. A wisp of it falls in their face, which is illuminated by the tendrils of light emerging from the little swaying flowers.
Against the wishes of his screaming mind, he looks again. Malfoy is dutifully taking notes, green peacock feather dancing near his earlobe, through which there is a small golden hoop. It’s as if Harry isn’t sitting only two rows away.
Draco steps away, and says, “The thing about this plant is, it needs a particular nutrient to grow. Without it, it will never produce another flower.” They’re walking briskly to the other side of the garden. “Burn it, Harry,” they call.
He said as much to Narcissa, who regarded him thoughtfully. Today her hair was loose, falling in smooth waves around her frail shoulders, which were wrapped in a lovely green shawl. She fingered it absentmindedly.
The wireless. He paused, ears drooping in grief. The days leading up to his transformation had been full of memories of Remus. His thoughts had wandered more than usual to the year when they had first met—Harry only thirteen when Remus taught him to conjure the patronus that had once saved Sirius’s life.
Draco shrugs. “I don’t mind, to be honest. This is a sanctuary for all kinds of things. Weird stalker boys included.”
Jasmine glanced at Draco out of the corner of her eye. A red bus zoomed past behind her, ruffling her hair. “Is that really so hard to believe?” she said, her soft accent buffeted by the wind.
“It feels shaken,” Luna said, taking a seat in a patched armchair, a burgundy shawl wrapped around her shoulders.
Suddenly seized with worry, he said, “Please don’t tell anyone—I doubt they’d listen if they knew it was me.”
“How come?” Harry asked, troubled. Luna always described the forest as sentient, but she’d had no cause for concern since it first passed into her hands.
Ron shook his head. “Nah,” he said, flicking his wand to flip them over. “I’ve gotten great at this lately.” He lowered his voice. “Don’t tell ‘Mione I said this, but cooking is not one of her many talents.”
As it was, the moon shone in a bright beam through dusty windows, illuminating the worn and scratched wood floors of Regulus’s old room, faded green wallpaper dissolving into the darkness of the night.
Harry quickly understood why Hermione had handed Rose to him, as it soon became clear that it was quite difficult to eat breakfast while holding a newborn. He gingerly patted her back, then moved to rest her head in the crook of his elbow. His wrist curled around her body; her tiny hand squeezed his thumb.
. I’m sure my regulars have heard me say so far too many times, so if you have suggestions for how to change it up feel free to send them my way.
But after Robards left down the hall, Harry peeked through the window of Jenkins’s room. She was sitting up, staring out the window. Sunlight illuminated the scars on her face. He didn’t go in.
Jasmine laughed. She ripped a piece of the bread. “This is injera,” she said, using the piece to scoop up some of the lentils. “Do it like this.”
“So,” Lee said, pulling a roll of parchment out of his bag. Were those termination papers? Fuckity fuck.
. I’ve been letting them play for a while, which in my opinion is the best way to listen to this kind of music. But before we get back to that, I’ll just let you know that we are nearly halfway through this witching hour—”
They made their way to the back room where a small cauldron was hovering over a blue flame, steam rising above it in slow swirls.
When they’re both there, the fear of fire is never too far from Harry’s mind. In class Professor Olarinmoye has remarked on his control over fire, a notoriously free-spirited element. He’s learned it from the constant stream in his mind of
It was making Draco miserable, but he was well-acquainted with misery. Worse, it was making him distracted. He’d been in another hole-in-the-wall record shop in muggle London, perusing music to play on the show, when he’d found himself listening to nearly every Beatles record, trying to find the song Granger had played in the common room so long ago, that Potter seemed to love so much.
Still, with morbid fascination perhaps, or a healthy dose of masochism, he practices it too often—in transfiguration where it earns him a gentle “Potter?” from Professor McGonagall that jolts him out of his trance and into feeling like a disappointment, and in the Great Hall when he’d like his vegetables a little extra crispy, among other times.
The gates dissolved to admit him; the wind calmed once he was inside the wards. He fixed his hair, brushing a bit of it to the side with his fingers. With his other hand, he fingered the soft wool shrunk in his pocket. The ebony double doors towered over him, creaking as they slowly opened.
“Bloody nightmare,” Boot said sourly. “Most of the kids have been discharged by now, but nearly all of them were turned—”
“Feels so good.” Harry can still feel the tingling, can imagine the streaks of magic they’ve left there. The warmth of Draco is above him, and the cold frozen ground is pressing into his back except where Draco is cradling his head with one hand.
Hands trembling, Harry calls the sparks to his fingertips. They feel lively, itching to get out. He lets one fall to the edge of the plot, and watches as it thaws the frozen stem, slowly making its way upwards to set the small white flower alight. The flames leap from flower to flower, gradually setting the garden ablaze. The heat begins to warm Harry’s skin.
“Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,” Elio was reciting, “Enwrought with golden and silver light…”
He bounded back inside, grabbing more pups in his teeth, spells deflecting off his fur—not that he especially cared. He slashed at a cloaked figure on his way out, and dodged another stunner from a man in red robes.
Goldstein looked at him then with a fondness Draco didn’t understand. “Alright,” he said, sitting back against the booth.
“For all you insomniacs still awake at this hour,” he intoned, “my condolences.” In the other room, Jasmine rolled her eyes. She’d been assigned to keep an eye on him his first week on shift, but was more of a welcome distraction from the long night shift than an enforcement of the network’s standards. Perhaps this was because she was the only person Lee could think of at the WWN who didn’t seem to hate Draco’s guts.
His eyes seem to match the weather. Harry abruptly turns his head, oddly shaken. His fingers tremble as he picks up his quill—a small black feather. There’s no reason for it; sometimes it’s impossible to explain the ways people react to things. There have been days when Harry can’t bring himself to bat an eye at the human carnage of the war, but weeps at the feeling of a Weasley sweater on his bare skin.
He’d looked so striking that day, confidently sweeping into the room, robes floating around him, windswept hair falling into his eyes, which burned into Harry’s in the moments before he’d looked away. At the sight of him, a flicker of something Harry hadn’t felt for years passed through his chest, which was absurd.
It was not to be. “Draco, would you mind staying after for a couple minutes?” Lee called. Fuck. He was going to get fired after less than a week on the job because he couldn’t manage to keep his thoughts inside his head, where they belonged. He resisted the urge to smack the smug expression right off Ernie’s face.
Molly always lamented that since Ron learned, he hadn’t come to Sunday dinners at the Burrow as often as he used to. Harry pretty much went where Ron and Hermione went, so he hadn’t been in a while either. To be fair, the events of the last few months hadn’t really put him in a sociable mood.
“How fascinating,” Goldstein said. “What was it like?” Somehow Draco got the sense that he was looking for an honest answer, which surprised him. Then again, Goldstein did seem like the kind of person who was indiscriminately genuine to everyone, even ex-Death Eaters. Draco was oddly grateful, though he’d never say so.
“I haven’t.” Draco felt himself flush. He’d had his fair share of food adventures since moving into a muggle flat five years ago, including an ungodly amount of Thai thanks to Pansy, but this was new.
“But…” Goldstein shoved his hands in the pockets of his trousers as he came to a stop. “You seem different. Not like the absolute prick you used to be.”
“Not to worry, I will,” he says quietly. “Come here.” He points his wand at Harry’s head, and for a second he thinks he must be mad, giving him access to his eyes, his throat, his major arteries.
Smiling fondly down at Rose, she gently maneuvered the baby into Harry’s arms. “Careful, I just fed her, so…” she gestured towards his shoulder. “Watch out.”
Pansy climbed up onto the bed and snatched it from his hand. “Let me see that.” She glanced down at it, looking over at him with a perplexed expression.
, the debut album by Amy Winehouse. It came out a couple years ago now, but it’s one of those ones we’ll probably be listening to forever…”
It came back to him in a rush, leaving his head light and dizzy, like hurtling mid-fall from a great height.
“Yeah well, I’m gonna be selfish and from now on, you don’t need supervision. I think we’ve satisfied the higher-ups, don’t you?” He winked.
“Who like breakfast,” Ron said, sliding eggs and sausages onto three plates and sending them sailing through the air to land with a light bump on the table.
It overwhelms him so much he gazes straight into the blaze, right where the spindly flower used to grow. But Harry can’t keep his eyes away for long.
Draco’s fingers are like little squids in the air beside his head, miming puffs of hair growing sideways. “You look like a grandpa.”
“Wizarding Wireless Awards. They award programmes that are innovative, popular, or just have some sort of special niche.”
Draco elbowed Goldstein again, more firmly this time, trying to keep his breathing under control. “Sorry,” he said quietly, and slipped out of the booth, Draco right behind him.
His gaze was drawn back to the letter, if you could call it that. The handwriting was atrocious; there were dark red ink splotches everywhere that if Draco didn’t know better he’d assume was blood, and several words were scratched out. At the same time it seemed familiar, in the way you’d imagine a penguin if you’ve never seen a picture of one.
The feeling of passing though wards like water set Harry immediately on edge. At the very least he’d expected them to resist his presence, however feebly.
It’s the most peaceful place he’s ever been, he thinks. More than the white train station in the vision where he’d chosen to live, more than his parent’s graves in Godric Hollow, where he visited nearly every day in the summer until he got sick of wishing for things that would never happen. More than the feeling of submerging himself in the prefect’s bath, soap bubbles rising above him as he contemplates whether he’d like to come back up again. Out of the warm water and into the cold.
