Narcissa whispered, waved her wand, and pressed her lips. “You're lying. Draco you haven't eaten in two days! How are you supposed to survive that case without a proper meal?”
Hermione nodded, “Okay, just know we’re here for you. Oh hey! I know how to cheer you up! Let's play another game.”
The time on the train:
Draco heaved a sigh, his tears subsiding. He finally found the strength to say sarcastically: “Yes Potter, I’m crying my eyes out in front of you. Of course I'm fine.”
‘Ron was right. It was bigger than just me. But I still can’t help but feel like it was my fault.’ Harry thought. He was about to tell Luna this, but she had already moved on to a new topic of conversation.
“I’ve also offered to help with any, and all tasks he requires to be finished.”
Draco continued to stare at the Jumper in his hands. While the rest of the people in the room celebrated, he felt sick to his stomach.
That was probably the Weasel.
Harry sighed, why him? “Dare.”
Draco spluttered through the blush now spreading down his neck. “No! I’m just saying that if you don’t do something about that hair soon I'll probably pitch myself off of the topmost window of the Ministry!”
Boom.
“Daydreaming!”
Draco let out a frustrated sigh. “Try harder! It’s obviously affected, maybe the culprit was able to torture it into submission.”
Draco nodded, it was all coming together.
Half of the students took a shot. Including Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson. It was Neville’s turn next. He said, “Never have I ever purposely skipped class.” All of the students drank including Hermione. Who, again, surprised everyone.
What if he got rid of the Dark Mark? It was the only thing that still caused him so much pain. Even looking at it Draco felt the scars on his chest twitch.
“Speaking of patronus’... now that you're finally awake, I’m going to make *sure* you can conjure one.”
“Draco, think about how the Dark Lord will reward us if we are the ones to hand him in.”
Hey y'all! There is some homophobia and homophobic language in this chapter, as well as verbal abuse. So please stay safe! And enjoy!
“But you're a Death Eater!” I exclaim, “You took the mark!”
“The Healers were able to wake me up right before you walked in.”
Harry’s ears turned red, “He’s not-”
Harry’s eyes widened, ‘Hello. How are you?’
Draco didn’t know when Voldemort left, he didn’t care. He just lay there bleeding on to the stone floors of his own dungeon…
Harry’s eyes widened as shot-glasses appeared in front of everyone. He looked up at the bushy haired girl, astonished.
“Harry!” Came Ron's excited voice, “Harry, are you up!”
*Fuck you world!* was all Harry thought as he bent down to kiss the top of Draco's head. He felt strangely warm for someone in a coma. But that was the wizarding world for you.
“We?”
“Do you like it?” Harry asked, anxiously waiting for an answer. “I thought that you might get offended, but then I thought it might be-”
“Oh, Harry! Tell me you didn’t.”
He could feel the dried tears on his cheeks.
Draco took a deep breath and pushed open the door.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Let me just go tell Ginny.”
“Alright. Tell him I’ll be there as soon as I finnish with these.”
Once he closed the door, he saw Harry standing there in his dark green dress robes.
“The Manor? But-”
They appeared right outside of a bar called: The Angel’s Elm. Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, “Really? ‘The Angel’s Elm?’”
Harry brightened, “Okay, we’ll move forward again!” He beamed. The Slytherin offered a small smile in return.
“Ooh! What about Luna!”
Wait what?
“She wont do anything. And it’s not like I’m going to tell her, it would come off as weak.”
A single tear slid down Draco’s face and onto the bed. He buried his face further in Harry’s shoulder, and Harry ran a calloused hand through Draco’s platinum hair.
Harry knew that voice. Up ahead he saw Malfoy being cornered by two burly 7th years.
“Just shut up.”
“Wait what?” Ron asked, “Hermione who is it!”
“But how in the name of M- Oh!” Draco had suddenly realized that he was still holding Harry's hand. He lept back, but immediately felt the absence of Harry's warmth. It had felt so right. Draco shook his head, it was probably those damned wrackspurts that Luna was always going on about.
“She really wanted you to be part of the family though.”
“Hi mate!” Ron exclaimed seeing them first. “Hey Malfoy.”
Draco smirked, and Harry gave him a look, “Don’t you dare.”
Draco took a deep breath, “I’m getting married in two weeks.”
“What?” I ask, when I finally get my voice back.
Malfoy flashes his trademark smirk, “I don’t know. But I think I should point out that I just did.”
“You would have looked good in red.”
“But…” Harry hesitated, “Bellatrix said that I had to mean it. I don’t think I can.”
She got to her feet and grabbed the wand from Draco’s nightstand. (He had no recollection of ever putting it there.) Then she whisked out of the room, leaving Draco with his haunting thoughts.
“Anyway,” He said, “The case files.”
“You what?”
“Sectumsempra!”
“I saw what happened in there. Do you want to talk about it?”
Boyfriend.
Author’s note real quick:
They both turned, none other than Narcissa Malfoy was standing there.
Harry walked up behind a blonde Slytherin who was trying to turn a mouse invisible.
There’s silence, and then what Draco said finally registered in Harry’s brain. “Wait- what!?”
When they kissed it was gentle and loving. And Draco knew that he would spend the rest of his days with the man in front of him.
“What’d you do that for?” He fumed.
Malfoy was lying on his bed face up, staring at the ceiling. Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He had run after Malfoy in a hurry, now that he was here he had no idea what to do.
Harry’s eyebrows shot high, then he looked thoughtful. He chewed on the hem of his sleeve, and Draco had the urge to reach out and yank it away. That was no way to treat clothes. But then again Harry had never had any respect for fashion, for he was in old ratty muggle clothing.
Draco’s head hit the desk. How was he supposed to get any sleep? With all these reports coming in, he might as well stay here 24 hours a day!
*pause*
Harry looked up confused, “What do you mean?”
“Don’t.” He growled, “I don’t need your pity.”
Voldemort raised his wand. What felt like a thousand tiny shards of glass hit him like a bull. They kept cutting deeper and deeper.
Draco gaped for a second. How was Harry that stupid? Well he could use it to his advantage. “It doesn’t matter who it was.”
“Care to expl-”
The duel:
He had been saying those same four words for over a month now, and had yet to make a decision.
“Could you please just tell me what’s going on?” Draco asked a little impatiently.
Ron grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him out of the corridor and down the train corridor.
“They were always about *him*. The things he did. But I know I deserved them.”
Harry nodded, “I get it.” Then he grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him into Side-along. (Seriously he has to stop doing that!)
“The name’s, Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. You'll soon find Potter, that some wizarding families are better than others. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
Harry swerved around a Horned Serpent and dived for the tower where the Slytherin’s were hanging on. He saw Crabbe fall.
Harry took a deep breath bracing himself, “I’m over here.”
He looked down to see a third year looking at him with scared eyes.
“Shut up!”
Draco laughed and shook his head, “I guess.”
Draco let out a bark of laughter, “Pansy? No way! Did you never notice that she was and is a lesbian?”
‘Roommate: Draco Malfoy’
This got several laughs. Hermione pursed her lips and glared at Seamus.
TW: none!
Draco softened when he saw the look on Harry’s face. So he silently walked over and laid down on the bed. He stayed on the edge because he assumed that Harry needed space.
"Could you be any louder?
"You're just sour because your team always
"Oh, come off it! I only meant—"
When Draco alighted on the staircase two floors down, he heard it. Each step he took closer, measured and steady, was picked up by Harry's ears. It was an anticipation that made his blood rush, faster, faster, faster.
Harry stared at it. "What about the counting. You're still counting everything. Could you stop that?"
"Is this okay?" Harry directed the question up, softly, to the underside of Draco's chin. He got a little smile in response as Draco shifted, uncrossing his legs to flatten the surface of his lap for Harry to rest his tired head.
Somehow now, though, the words dried up in Harry's throat. He opened his mouth, but he couldn't force them out, no matter how many times he'd practiced in the mirror earlier.
"Love you too. I'll see you Friday."
“You can say you don’t need me anymore, but I don’t believe you.” Malfoy’s huff hit differently in the dark. His cheek dimpled, and the curl of his lips was finally familiar again. His callous smile, coldly delivered, signalled a return to normal.
"Show-off," Draco whispered, though he brushed Harry's hair back from his forehead, fingertips warm against his skin. Harry fought to keep from closing his eyes. He’d been at the worksite by seven each morning, and then all over London all week, bombarded with meetings. A quiet Friday night in was what he needed, but Ron had pushed his party back to include Seamus, and Harry couldn’t bail now.
Harry smiled and closed his eyes as Draco's fingers mapped out the grooves of his face.
"Yeah—I can see it now," Harry held his mug with his knees so he could gesture to an imagined marquee, "
"I feel like a frog," he continued, to Draco's answering chuckle. Checking for enough space for circulation, like they'd been taught in Auror training.
"Do you get off on it? Cooking like a Muggle? At least if it's a kink, I can accept it."
"Sure, I was there, in body, but we didn't
"Can it wait?"
"I can make you forget, for a while," Draco said quietly. Harry's breath hitched at his words, offered plainly. "You can use me to forget."
Harry wondered at what the clear liquid fading from between the cracks of ice cubes in Alex's cup could be. From the scent on the air, he was fairly sure it was straight strawberry vodka but was a little scared to find out if he was right.
"That should help with feeling so low, but only for a short while. You need to get up, out, and maybe see a Healer for something more long-lasting."
"Sorry, but it's her or me, and only one of us is necessary for legislation to pass, so she'll be working and I'll be hanging out with you. That's final." Ron's forehead wrinkled, "Could you
"How are you still so tight?" Draco said, frowning with his lip bit as he pushed in the first tentative digit. Harry quickly lost his grip on reality as that finger pressed inside of him, and it wasn't enough. Draco kept asking him what he wanted, and where—
Harry snapped out of his reverie, horrified that Blaise had said something, and everyone in the immediate vicinity was staring at him. Because Harry was staring, had practically been drooling all the while, staring, as usual, at Draco.
"Penny House," Draco said, and that was it. Harry couldn't believe how relieved Mr Sparks had been when he'd Firecalled to tell him that The Project finally had a registrable name.
"It's terrible in some ways, how we've left them to their own devices. Have you heard of braces? For teeth?" Malfoy asked conspiratorially. Harry took the chance to pinch himself a second time under the table, just in case. When that didn't work, he pulled the bottle of Ogden's close and filled half his mug.
Draco piled them on the table and touched a fingertip to an empty black leather finger.
Malfoy stopped. He held the door ajar but didn't step over the threshold, and Harry thought he must be hallucinating because Malfoy looked petrified right back at him.
He shifted his hips back, crying out when Draco's knuckles found his taint, aching for a little more as Draco's hard prick nudged at the inside of his thigh, precome smearing into the hair there. Draco didn't say anything, but Harry knew that did something for him. He owned Harry; he needed to be reminded, was all.
"Are you awake?"
"Who's we in all this, did you—"
“Next match s'in a week. You're going to look so good in Day-Glo," Harry snorted at the thought. "And you
"That's very...altruistic of you," Mrs Weasley spoke slowly from down the table, where Harry was surprised she was still listening in on their conversation. It was Draco's turn to blush the adorable high pink he sometimes went.
Draco growled and stood again. "I've never talked to a therapist, okay? Alright? I'm glad it worked for you, I'm sure it's great to go a dozen times and talk your fucking depression away, but some of us don't—can't—it's just—"
His right hand clutched Harry’s jaw, angling to better access his mouth. They kissed messily, as though starved for it. Harry’s lips were going to be raw tomorrow from rubbing against the sharp hairs of Draco’s five-o-clock shadow; Draco’s would probably feel the same. It was glorious. It was everything Harry had dreamed of, and more because it was real.
-co," Andromeda gently tried to correct his pronunciation, but Teddy wasn't paying her any mind any longer.
Harry pushed the voice out of the way, like batting a fly buzzing about your ears.
"Well hullo to you too," Draco started, and Harry stole his words through a kiss scented with bergamot and sweet with milk and sugar, and Harry wanted to dance with how happy he was to taste sugar in Draco's mouth and kissed him all the more, ignoring Draco's attempts to ask questions and following him by the mouth until he straddled him on the couch, until Draco pushed him away with a firm hand to the centre of his chest.
"About you, and Draco." Before Harry could ask why she shushed him. "He's conflicted. You're a big part of why he has what he has, but things aren't um,
But he didn't. He kept it inside, like a sane person, except for when it leaked out as he stared moonily through the window into the studio, and properly watched Draco dance for the first time.
Harry blinked. "I don't have any plans."
Harry made a sound of acceptance. Draco squeezed him and pulled away, his hands at each of Harry's shoulders. Harry held his gaze—something about this admission didn't sit right with him.
Harry woke with a gasp to rip sweat-soaked sheets from his legs. The thin cotton gown he wore was mint green around the hems but dark where it stuck wetly to his body.
"Your plants are dead, Draco," Harry said.
until Draco couldn't stay upright any longer and the backs of his thighs found his calves as Harry held him and steadily bounced him, their mouths crashing together in a mess of kiss and rushed breaths and finally, Harry held Draco still and close, his prick rubbing wetly against the sweat-soaked ridges of Harry's stomach and Harry came inside him, into that impossible warmth, toes curled, mouth open on a silent scream.
"I told you that I once set myself on fire, and they barely buzzed with surprise."
"—I know how
"No. I was, um. Not brought along, no."
His horror should have been growing, but a lifetime of choosing pragmatism served him well in moments like these.
Harry powered on, feeling like a naughty child forced to explain himself to an adult, like he was waiting for his punishment to be doled out, only he hadn't done anything wrong. It choked him up, how much it reminded him of begging his Aunt and Uncle not to be cross with him when he was a boy.
"I—that was good, Harry. Better than good, even, I mean, it was kind of incredible. You’re spectacular—"
“Potter! Watch it—”
"He'll tell you he's barely legal in all states and provinces, but he's actually almost thirty, and he has a thing for fellow gingers. You didn't hear it from me," Harry added, backing out of the room as soon as he noticed Alex turn to squint at them. His sixth sense of being able to tell when someone was paying attention to him had kicked in; Harry sent up a silent prayer for Charlie and stepped out into the front hallway.
"And sometimes, right when I first see you, your thoughts are so—jagged."
to call. It's you, hanging up on me, isn't it?" Draco nodded, the little muscles in his face struggling to keep it together. His bottom lip trembled, and Harry didn't care, wanted to see Draco hurt the way he'd hurt for so long.
Like a touch, Harry felt Draco's gaze at the back of his neck. He looked up the stairs and sure enough, there was Draco, halfway out the door to the lounge. His face was dewy and wisps of his hair had fallen loose around his face. Harry realized he hadn't seen him around for a good half-hour.
Fatima looked between the two of them. "I got her from Parson's. Top of her class; she's going to be taking on your custom pieces," she said, a smirk on her lips.
He dropped the smile immediately. Kingsley Shacklebolt was visible, a head taller than most people in the room, deep in conversation with a Bagman’s wife and son. The bagpipe player from the Weird Sisters—Harry never could quite remember his name—was telling some rip-roaring story to a group of about a half dozen witches, gesturing wildly next to a precarious ice sculpture of a dragon perched atop a mountain. Otherwise, a quick scan didn’t reveal any friendly faces. Before too many heads turned and noticed him, he beelined for the high doors on the far side of the room. They were swung open to the hazy evening air but provided only the illusion of respite, as not even the whisper of a breeze cut through the heat that pummelled down.
a relief."
it to him, nobody ever had to, he didn't
"Enlighten me to your usual," Harry said, opening the drawer closest to the sink. It was filled with regular ephemera, some Muggle, some magical—iridescent hair serums and elixirs with ingredients like the blood of bats or moth wings, tucked alongside colognes and spot treatments as-seen-on-TV. Everything in meticulous order to Draco's exacting standards. The next drawer held hand towels, and the cupboard under it more towels, of the full-bodied variety.
"You've been ignoring my owls," she said. Harry shrugged, opened his hands palm-up to her.
He pulls back from the kiss and squeezes his fingers tight. Malfoy chokes a gasp and widens his jaw.
"Boys!" Hermione warned, and they both raised their wand hands, pointing them at the ceiling, grips loosened. They knew better than to draw up her wrath by fooling around in the kitchen again.
Then he wiggles his bum and Draco mouths
Harry made a sound in his chest. Words couldn't come anymore because if they could, he would apologize a thousand times. But they couldn't, and it was as though Draco's murmuring and soothing touch were the beginning of a fantasy.
Having finally gotten a hold of himself, Harry turned to meet the body that matched the voice. The voice he'd been fantasizing about, the voice that used to grate his nerves and was now the one he desperately wanted to growl into his ear.
, and a little less I'm Going to Support You As a Best Friend Through Literally Anything. He was tiring of Draco's silence faster than Harry was, was likely to start setting Harry up on dates with the brothers of co-workers within the week, if Harry had to guess.
"In here," Draco's voice came from the lounge, so Harry walked that way. He wished that his traitor heart would stop beating so frantically as he entered, and Draco turned to him.
"Do it again."
brought flowers.
"He hasn't been sending back my letters," Harry said quietly. "I've written to him every day. Every day."
"There was a whole plan, and that's all been bunged up now I expect and people, they just—" Harry broke off, worrying the fabric of the coverlet between his fingers. It was soft too. It had been kind for Malfoy to have put him in such a comfortable bed. "They don't know yet. About me."
"Don’t be. You’re right." He took a deep breath, steeling himself. Harry realized that Draco had a lot more on his plate being there than Harry did. He didn’t have the cushioning of friends or even friendly colleagues to soften the awkwardness that the event would bring him. "I’m astonished that you’re not talking with more of your old Auror mates. One would almost get the impression that you’d rather hide in the corner with a known Death Eater than catch up with the keepers of the peace."
Fuck. Fuck it all. They knew he was here now, and like blood in the water, his presence would bring more.
"You've all gone mad." Ron shook his head, looking between Hermione and Harry both, clearly not finding what he needed. He was a high red, now, worked up worse than Harry may have ever seen him. It was the anger that took Harry the most by surprise.
He ignored it, and within a minute, the buzzing died down, acid-green flames fading back to a gentle orange.
Harry frowned at Ron, who wouldn't meet his eye. "What's that supposed to mean?"
"Yeah, before I forget. I'm putting in an order anyway. I'll come with you. Anyone want anything?"
"Yes. Only a few. They used all the death threats I've received as reason why printing Teddy's name or identifying features would be reckless endangerment of a child." Draco smiled down at the paper, but really, he was smiling at himself. "I thought of that one."
Draco shook his head, refusing to show any hurt in the face of the news. "It's fine. I'll have my own letter to read come morning, I suppose." He looked to Harry, a small smile held in place as he blinked rapidly. "It'll be in holding at Maude's, won't it?"
"You should do that to me, later.” That must be Tennis Shoes speaking, the whisper-voice of a man who knew his place was under the control of someone else. Harry was flying, outside of himself, tears in his lashes and breath in such short supply, lungs burning with how much he wanted this as Cissy tipped her head back slightly and pulsed her hips, Draco's usual grunts now Cissy’s punctuated gasps. She
"No shit," Harry said. He kicked at the pavement with the toe of his trainer, knocking pebbles into the street.
Harry had the urge to grumble about only being the way he was precisely because he wasn't like blokes his age, but he swallowed the words. Nobody enjoyed hearing him gripe about the maniac who hunted him throughout his adolescence, anyway.
that reeked of antiseptic. The lack of warning led Harry to hiss and slam a fist into his thigh at the unexpected sting.
So it had gone for days, and every time, Ron's look a little more
“Get that blood off your shoes the moment you step out of my operating theatre or I’ll send you back to first-year healing school,” was what he’d originally said after Harry’s first surgery. Not the most tactful, Hewitt, but it was the sentiment that mattered.
"Please," Harry begged, "
"What were you thinking, doing magic like that?" he asked.
"What's he in for?" Harry asked. Dean shrugged, scratching at his chin with a thumbnail. His beard was coming in, and his shirtsleeves were wrinkled at the wrists—he'd clearly been working all day, if not through the night before on the story. Harry's interest spiked, though the drink sloshing about in his brain slowed his capacity to put two-and-two together.
"I think I'd like it if you make me. I think I might need that," Harry said, and Draco's whole face lit up. He gestured with his chin for Harry to turn around again.
He quashed the thought, peeved with himself for thinking it.
“Middle-aged couple with a chihuahua,” he mused.
, incorrigible?
“Draco?”
"Called what?" Harry asked though he screwed his eyes shut as soon as he asked.
"That’s good," Draco said. "That’s good to know."
“What—” Draco went to speak, but his question was lost as Harry's eyes closed, and his lips landed first, stealing the words from his mouth. Eyelashes fluttered against his cheekbone, soft as a moth's wings as Draco seemed unsure as to whether he should close his eyes or not. He’d been caught by surprise and went stiff, the momentum Harry proceeded into the kiss with landing against an unmovable force.
pencilled in, but his answer when asked was simply that he'd stopped.
A huff. Almost a laugh. "How can you know that when even I don’t?"
at you, you're sublime, Harry, really, I love you so much it hurts to think about directly. I mean, you've broken me for other people, I, I—I feel badly about neglecting
"Something like that," the man said.
Draco’s mouth had made the shape of an
"Was it him?" Harry asked. Draco's face became impassive, an easy trick for him, and he lay on his back again, eyes trained on the ceiling. His hair was an absolute mess, and he looked high off their shag, glowing, beautiful, and all Harry could think about was whether Justin had gotten to see Draco like this too. This version of Draco that Harry felt was his and his alone.
"On slow days, they watch these points. That's how Savoire Fairy gets most of its shots of celebrities sniffing strawberries at the market; they trail anyone of even middling interest from Apparition points to the nearest posh grocer."
Draco didn't respond. He stared at the moving pictures across the room. Silence as coping mechanism. Harry could deal with that. Better than cool dismissal. Better than a breakdown, too.
“You know,” Harry gestured blithely, not sure how he could explain the crushing need he felt to appease the literal masses.
"I'm not an invalid," Malfoy's said with a small frown. He let go of the hand that a moment ago he'd all too easily taken, putting distance between himself and Harry with a soft push.
"Mmm," Draco made a considering noise. "I’ll allow it. You may feed me more often," he said. Harry burst out laughing.
," Harry said. Draco didn't say anything to that, staring into his lap. Harry sighed, rubbed at his eyes under his glasses, smudging them again. "Look—I'm not accusing anyone of anything. I don't want to talk about the past any more than you do."
They towelled off as the water swirled down the drain, Draco stood near the sink while Harry stayed in the bath, enjoying the warm water as it slipped away past his toes. Draco opened a drawer and pulled out a bottle Harry didn't recognize, pouring a capful and knocking it back. His towel was around his neck, his body exposed in a long, slim line that Harry hadn't been able to enjoy the sight of in so long, and he didn't realize he'd been gawking until Draco called him out on it.
"I'm sorry, but I just don't get it," Justin said. "Sure, I've gotten drunk with him before, when I was younger and considerably less savvy, but he's not
"One, Harry," Victoria loaded the word with meaning. "Pick someone, anyone, and give the public what they want. It can be a completely managed relationship."
of second-hand embarrassment. That was the most Hufflepuff answer I've ever heard—look, all this sincerity, I'm breaking out in
and that apparently, somehow, he was both alive and awake while it happened.
Harry wanted to fight it, but the pinched look on Draco's face spoke to the fact that he was barely holding it together and this wasn't the time to push. It was a look that was dangerous; he felt cornered, fearful, hostile, all of it. Harry shrugged on his coat and flipped up the hood, its sodden edges cold against his skin, and then toed into his trainers, and when he glanced up, he caught Draco looking at him in an unguarded way. He could see it there: longing. There was a desperation in the way he held his arms crossed tightly against his body, a body that looked as sharp and hard as it had felt against Harry's back. Desperation not to give in and let wandering fingers reach out. He was holding himself back just as much as Harry was laying himself bare.
"Well, not that wide more like... er, like a regular one, but if you'd pulled at it for a long time?"
"Fine. I needed to hear it from you before I stopped trying, is all. Due diligence," she said with a flick of her wrist.
Harry dragged his eyes over after Draco spoke the words into the still air. His lips were awry, twisted to the side, eyes bloodshot, and all his sniffling, the micro-sways one way or another stopped. He had more to say, and it was like something clicked into place, changing his demeanour. Subtle, a snake going from playing dead on its back and flipping over, preparing to strike as you walked away. There was something else. Something unsaid.
—aren't you?"
Draco finished with gentle licks, replacing Harry's softening cock on his belly. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
," and then she'd hugged him. It felt like affection. If it took thousands of pounds to win it—so be it.
"I'm so sorry, I—My mom's a huge fan of yours so this is, like, so weird."
"It was arranged. It…" He straightened in the seat, and Harry pulled his arm back, turning towards him. "This was right after the trials." He looked at his fingers, clearly craving a cigarette, though he was in a cutting back phase and hadn't brought any with him.
"They want you over for dinner. Family dinner, you're invited."
different than they are for everyone else, and I'm not so much angry about it as I am scared of what they're going to do to you. To us."
If someone had asked him earlier in the day if he expected a letter from Draco, he would have told the truth—he wasn't sure. And he'd done a valiant job in not fixating on whether or not he'd receive a response. But there was something of finality to this silence, on this, the day after he'd shown his hand. It was now Draco who held all the cards—he could go to the press with Harry's letters, his naughty, hand-written notes, asking,
Harry swallowed hard and counted down from three, taking a deep breath before he responded.
Harry’s head swivelled too fast at the sound.
"That bad, eh?"
Malfoy places one towel on the corner of the counter and uses the other to wipe each long finger clean. He holds on to it with an expectant raise of his brows like he’s got something else in mind to wipe clean next.
Draco padded over to the kitchen's far side, avoiding the broken pieces of Harry's mask strewn on the floor. The better version of Harry, the one that worried and was good, he thought that he ought to be ashamed of himself as he watched Draco's stockinged feet tip-toe around the shards. Draco made it past the garden of broken pieces unscathed and hopped up to sit on the countertop, lighting a cigarette hidden in his palm. One arm rested across his abdomen to prop up the other. Holding himself.
"How was it, exactly that you two, uh," Ron blew his breath out, looking lost. "Started?"
Harry whips around and the sound stops.
"Maybe it's Mal—" Neville started.
He picked at the cuticle of his thumbnail. "Four hundred, if you do it right."
“Cute. Though this look is,” Draco trailed off, dipping his head in a study of Harry’s attire.
," read an unsigned note that Harry recognized as Luna's writing as it tumbled to the floor from the magazine's folds.
Harry felt something in him snarl, but he nodded instead, said, "Sure," and gave Draco a thin smile to reassure him. "Fine, just—rattled, a bit. Are you? Okay?"
"We’re going to be careful, pet," he said, his breathing already irregular. Harry dipped his head and closed his eyes, preparing himself for what came next. He heard him swallow, then felt the tightening of the strap around his throat as Draco pulled it tight with his left hand and then wrapped his right over top, thumb under the joint of Harry's ear and jaw and his fingertips pressing in under the other. Even that pressure was enough to send a jolt down Harry's spine, directly to his cock. He felt so
Harry gestured inside, and Draco, for whatever earthly reason, followed him. Harry sought a tray, this time crouching down to nip a pair of cocktails off the top and leaving a Knut's tip in their place.
It was cool in his, and Draco was never colder than Harry. He was warm, so deliciously, wonderfully hot under the surface, that Harry's first reaction was to grip tighter. It must be a mistake—this wasn't Draco. Draco couldn't be cold.
"And Harry over there, Harry's a half-blood. He's a Potter-Evans, and he is the master of this house. Like it or not, the Muggle in him is just as important and valid as the pureblood." Kreacher started making a growling noise, and Harry was sure the whole conversation was about to end in a blowout, but Draco kept on talking over him, his elocution as posh and crisp as it had ever been.
Harry fumbled for a way to turn his jumbled thoughts into coherent words. "Sure, but I trust you. To an extent." Draco stared at the manuscript. Harry plowed on.
Draco Malfoy, am I actually watching you snog Harry Potter, or have I died and gone to pervy gossip heaven?"
“Speak or get out. I’m with a patient.”
"Yes, well. It's been no good seeing you, as usual. Let's endeavour never to repeat the situation."
"Not funny," Hermione grouched. They both relaxed, Hermione sidling in next to Ron to peer into the fridge while he went back to stirring, dumping the promised jar of sauce into the pan.
"Why's that?" Harry asked, but Malfoy only frowned.
He raises a hand and finds his pointer finger a swollen mess, crooked in the shape of the letter C. He holds it to his lips and shushes Harry with a mouth full of blood. He’s leaking into the crevices of the floor, has a front-row seat to watch it ladder its way over, building a bridge between them.
Harry shook his head. His heart sank, but not quite as quickly as his stomach did. It was like it fell through his body, and he felt faint.
followed for good measure, and Malfoy bit his bottom lip, but couldn’t contain his smile.
still be able to talk right now. You only ate a little, after all.” Harry held his finger and thumb close, right up to one of Malfoy’s shiny wet eyes so he could see it. “Just one peach in that whole batch of apple cobbler. Who would have thought?”
"I'm sure you'll know your way around the pantry better than I do. There's plenty of things in the icebox for sandwiches. I'll make the tea, wouldn't trust you to do it right to save your life," he said this last under his breath, as though Harry weren't directly following him. Harry pulled a face behind his dishevelled blond head.
"How long has it been
"When there's a trauma incurred to the body, which the brain is a part of," he gestured to the line he'd drawn through the slope, "there's a decline afterwards of use of that body part. What follows is time first, for healing," his wand tip followed the line down into the valley, "and once that's done, for rehabilitation." He traced up the incline of the next hill. There, not quite so high as the other horizontal line, he swiped another one.
“Yeah.”
A sound stopped him on the stairwell. Not one in particular, though. A rhythm, hidden within the sheet of noise that was the thousands of droplets of Draco's shower falling to the bottom of the bath. Harry approached the door—was something dripping?
you to fuck me in front of all of them—
"Hello, I'm Draco Malfoy," he said, holding his hand aloft. Susan's boyfriend—Mulligan? Mitchell?— looked at it as though it were covered in pus.
Harry knew he was smiling strangely. It felt funny on his face and he touched his own cheeks like he had to be sure the feeling was true.
It wasn't unpleasant, Harry thought, the scent lingering in the hallway, following him from room to room. Just oddly mundane considering the situation.
"Canada's, like, a whole country," Alex scoffed. "I'm from Toronto, thank you, and my mom's totally in love with you and your, like, charity stuff. I got her your book for Christmas. She's
"Here," he said, "legs up." Draco complied, tucking his feet into each other as he locked his thighs tightly around Harry's waist.
Draco deftly kissed his way down Harry's back, showing great care and admiration as his hands massaged the planes of muscle stretched between his shoulder blades, taking his time on his ribs, his palms impossibly hot, and then he moved lower, ghosting his breath at the dip of his lower back, and then at his tailbone.
"Guest bedroom. You have ten seconds before I come to get you myself."
"You trust me, yes?" he asked, his fingers loosening the first few buttons of his shirt to reveal the creamy skin of his collarbones. The dark smudge of a lovebite Harry had sucked into him the last time they'd seen each other stood out, blackberry purple on his chest, and his blood heated on sight.
"Punished me for finding a new way to act like a fucking girl." He sucked at the cigarette, burned down dangerously close to his fingers already. "It was—whatever. I was an insufferable suck for attention back then anyway, it's not like I didn't deserve it." Harry could only wonder what the word
Draco nodded. "Well, you will. It's different for you because you can pass."
"Kreacher, ood ew chuh yowl a nut?"
"Close your eyes, and think. In a year, what would you like to be doing?" Draco spoke softly, twining their fingers together.
"What we don't want is you dropping in, having a fucking breakdown and then not returning our calls or texts or owls, shutting off every available way to reach you for
. "I'm not afraid of a Weasley, especially not one using teenage tricks to bully me."
“I was careful, and I could
"This isn't about sides," Hermione said, levelly. She sucked her teeth, thinking. "Can't you see this is important to him? Even if it is—
"They'll get you if you try to go out through the Atrium," Harry said, quieter this time.
"I mean that the Minister never had to worry about you showing up to work in a dress," Draco answered, his eyes fluttering shut. He seemed exhausted. Harry looked around, scanning the street for an odd set of robes or familiar faces. None were about—they were alone for the moment. Harry turned back to Draco, saddened by the fact that it was he who exhausted him.
"Yes. Like a burn."
"Go, be gone with you, you're done for the day. Oh, but do find those glasses of yours, won't you?" She frowned at him—she and Reza had been on a dual campaign to rid him of his favoured round wire-frames for years, and they weren't taking the comeback well. "Reza made me promise to get you to wear them for the Hogwarts ball. He hates you in those old things."
Bill took a moment to think about it before slowly nodding. "Yeah. He really seems to be."
"Good different or bad different?" Harry asked. He had the distinct feeling that though all the blocks composing his being were solid, he was unravelling. It was as if the glue that held him together was not quite strong enough to keep bricks from slipping out of place. His thoughts had become overrun by Draco, his moods dictated by the duration of time that had elapsed since they'd seen one another. It was like he didn't know how to function properly outside their arrangement, doing all the other things as he'd always done them—on auto-pilot, only with slightly more gusto and on less sleep.
Harry pulled off, panting. "I want you to bruise my throat," the words dropped out—he said them just to see the devious look of want spread across Draco’s face. It made him feel wanted to be used. And he could be dirty, he could be depraved. He
"Could you please not, not with the flash?" Harry tried for an appealing smile, his cheeks already starting to blaze. People thought of him as ruddy, though it was just that he blushed, even after all these years, when first confronted with a camera.
. He had an almost fanatical concern about Kreacher's well-being, and the treatment of house-elves in general, nudging Harry to care too, as though his de-radicalization from the Death Eater's purity mania hadn't left him neutral but had instead planted him firmly in what was seen by pureblooded society as radical, left-wing thought. Harry bit his tongue from saying what he thought regarding this about-face—that this was partially a late-blooming bout of teenage defiance against his parents, and partly fuelled by guilt. Harry was smart enough to keep these thoughts to himself, and honestly, what did it matter, why Draco had come around to reason, to goodness, to the concept of equality?
"Tried it once," Malfoy said, regaining his composure. "I nearly died from holding back all the acerbic wit I was clearly born to share. Yes, it's like this with everyone lucky enough to enjoy my company. Bit of fun back and forth until one person dies."
"All of three days on my own? I’ll be fine." He must have caught on to the desperation in Harry’s thick fingers, clutching his own; seen the look of worry in his eyes from years of
"It is what it is. My contract with Jacqueline—she's the owner—it's always been a little iffy when it came to legality. Parents pay what they can when they're able. I've always thought of it as a little walking around money, you know?" He shrugged it off, though Harry and others at the table were clearly shocked at this newly unearthed tidbit.
He could be another person, almost. Milk-white skin bright and smooth and glistening with sweat. Fine hair glowing mandarin under the incandescent streetlights, swooping up and away from his angular face. His perfect, straight nose that had never been broken. Eyelashes delicate as spider webs, fanning out, the soft counterpoint to so many hard lines—or maybe it was the poison talking. Probably the poison.
"Who died?"
Draco eyed him a second longer and then tilted his head and pulled the curtain back along the rail, almost but not quite an acceptance of Harry into the space. Harry stepped inside and closed the door, his naked body glad to be ensconced in the warm, wet air.
Harry, nearly twenty-one, pushed, unaware and laughing, into the fitness equipment storage room after a game of shirts and skins. Expecting a stash of gillyweed and a quart of gin.
"Yes, really."
Bits of this came back to Harry. Mandarin-coloured hair. Some shouting; a fair amount of vomiting.
Draco nodded, his blank mask coming up, which Harry responded to with an even wider smile of his own.
He licked his lips and swallowed, momentarily forgetting what the question was.
"Me? I'm freelance." The lift stopped to let on newcomers, though the assembled group simply gawked at him and the photographer until the grille closed, not a person joining them. Harry closed his eyes as the lift started up again, cursing each and every stupid, staring face that hadn't saved him from the presently awkward situation he was in. Photos with fans would be better than this. Though he thought, gulping, maybe they weren't fans anymore.
"Never mind." He puffed out a great rush of air, but his exasperation remained fond.
gave too much away, would cause worry. "—concentrating this week. Mind went a bit funny."
Harry fetched him water and held the straw up for him to suck a sip. All the while, Draco staring at him. He pushed the cup away.
drugs." He sighed and dug a finger into the knot of his tie to loosen it. "Love, too; not loved. I would do anything for—" he cut himself off. "Anyway, in the end even that became mundane, and I was injecting into my feet—"
He stopped, completely still, and listened. The sounds of small animals emerging from their hiding places rustled the weeds, but for a long few seconds nothing intelligible, just low voices, too far away to make out words. Then, a series of sounds. The snapping of branches and the swishing of leaves, and last, a sickening thud.
Malfoy's hand found the crook of Harry's arm. He squeezed, his grip tight. Harry looked to him as he pursed his lips to try to breathe out in a steady stream. He sounded awful; Harry wished he'd had better training for what to do during scenarios like these during his time with the Aurors, something more substantial than the anecdotal, off-the-cuff solutions he'd figured out during the war, rubbing Hermione's shoulders as she shook with uncontrollable tears.
"Yes, we," Harry said, taking him by the hand and leading him out of the bathroom, "now come to bed."
Draco always managed to squeeze in a few words that stung when Harry got to feeling the warm and fuzzies. It was like he noticed and had the instinctive urge to quash the feelings before they took root. It had to be purposeful, the way Draco was so cold saying it.
"Malfoy, wait," Harry found himself standing before he knew what he was doing, "my, er, publicist is asking about those glasses. Any chance you have them on you?"
"It's only an earlobe, mum," Ginny chided.
—it turned a simple moment of jerking off into something that sent shivers to the base of his spine.
"Get in here," he said, and Draco threw one glancing look around the street before he clambered on top of Harry in an indecent straddle.
One of Draco's hands rested on the outline of Harry's prick, hard inside his pants, a wet spot growing—but Harry took the hand and pulled it away, held it in his.
"I mean, don't get me wrong—you're friends with him, right?" Harry swallowed, considering how much Noah knew about him; if it was as
"You as well, Aunt Andromeda," Draco answered her over Mrs Weasley's shoulder. "This hair suits you."
“Doesn’t make it acceptable,” Charlie added. Draco nodded at him.
Malfoy curled smaller, knees knocking up against Harry’s hip. The sheet puckered in the tightening grip of his fist.
"I'm not so close. I'm checking your pupils, you nitwit. They're blown, as I suspected. Have you any experience with drugs, wizard or Muggle?"
. Their photos were snapped by two photographers stationed by the entrance, the clicking sound barely registering as Harry raised his coffee cup to eye level, hiding his face the best he could behind paper and plastic.
"You do know that your mirepoix is more of a rough chop, don't you Potter?"
He turned at the end of the hall and took the stairs up to the second-floor landing, passing the heap of Malfoy's robes near the top. One door was open, revealing a bed, the sheet folded down over the coverlet the way Harry had been made to do growing up. Harry was drawn to the details, leaning into the doorway to see more. White lilies filled a glass jar on an armoire, their scent heavy in the stuffy air, ochre pollen like ashes and dropped, yellowed petals around its base. A framed print of a black and white erotic drawing hung over it—pencil, or charcoal, with two men embracing, one buff and busting out of his leather gear, the other lean and shirtless, his stiff cock a soft curve between the straight lines of their torsos. His eyes were drawn to a few silver jewelry pieces in a bowl—cuff links and pearl earrings, some chain necklaces, and a ring with a blue gem the size of a thumbnail set into it. Harry took a step into the doorway and stopped himself, the assault of a smell that was so specifically
In which Draco does a kindness and Harry and Ron learn some unexpected news from the past.
Harry skims his fingers over skin that is no longer scarred. Takes a forearm unbesmirched by ink and kisses it tenderly.
Harry turned back towards the wall, curling into the shape of a crumpled ball that he favoured in sleep. He didn't want to face Draco this morning. The possibility was strong that he'd never be able to talk to him again without bursting into flames with embarrassment.
He didn't have space to feel for George at the moment. When he focused on what was happening inside, he found his oesophagus cut off with a tight knot of worry. There wasn't room for anything to pass through; not for white-hot fury, not for pity, not anything.
"But Harry, you know what I know now?"
him, that in conjunction with his memoir hitting bookshelves in two days, he wouldn't have to give another interview as long as he lived, as far as he was concerned. It made his skin crawl, this attempt at vulnerability in such a public way, but now that it was over, he no longer found his stomach churning as he re-read the words he'd already done the hard work of saying allowed.
The woman's mouth opened, and then she closed it. It was small, painted purple. Her lips pursed—something about him didn’t sit right with her.
"Yes. Are you," he paused to suck in a ragged breath, "coming to get me? How come," again the ugly rattle, the exhale shaky, "they assigned the great Auror Potter to me?"
"I know better than to mess with Mysteries," Harry joked, and Mordred's smile didn't flicker but the tension in the air told Harry all he needed to know about how the Department of Mysteries felt about
"You can swallow alright? It doesn't hurt to talk?" Harry shook his head and Draco, apparently satisfied, crawled to sit next to him. He drew his wand from where it had been abandoned to the edge of the bed and cast
"I was just checking. Come on. How's that sound?"
With spring came a sense of ease, the pitter-patter of rain the soundtrack to days and nights alike. Harry's desire for home to be a shared space was realized in spurts; Teddy's first overnight was a success—they returned him the next day without any bumps or bruises.
, palm offering possessive pressure at the top of his head to keep his mouth on his softening cock, and then he comes, too.
"You haven't spotted him yet, have you?" Ron asked gently. Harry shook his head tightly. Ron pointed, a long, freckled finger extending to the far right side of Harry's vision. "Back corner, with the girls. In the white."
The groaning suddenly stopped.
"I never stopped, Harry." The words deflated Harry's talk like a pin in a balloon. They stopped him in his tracks. "I don't know how."
Harry’d have to sell the house. There was no other way, memories piled up like so much dust on every surface. It was suffocating to be there, to look around and have nothing to do but remember.
He tried to, at least. Drowning his chips in vinegar, he managed a few controlled bites but found them turning to sour paste in his mouth. He balked at the concept of eating a meal's worth.
Draco tried to pull his hands away, but Harry held fast. "How can you know that?" He breathed unevenly. "Have you been
So, you know. Two owls, one stone."
"For the Master," Kreacher said, pushing a plate in his direction as he took up the magazine, unfurling it from the bit of twine it came in.
"I'll add that I've worked with him to a certain degree, and he's made his amends," Hermione added. She was stronger than Harry, looked people in the eye as she spoke. The Weasley's other than Ginny and Ron appeared to be in a collective form of shock, mouths slightly ajar, eyes round and glassy, mostly unblinking or, in the case of Arthur, blinking in rapid bursts as though to clear them of the sight before him.
"What in the world am I doing?"
"About what?"
"If you read my intake forms, they'd tell you that at the tender age of nineteen I was alcohol dependent, surprising no one." He stopped to cough and clear his throat, to keep it from wobbling. "Gin, straight, was my preference, though ten beer would do just as well for tea. I was a constant and avid user of all manner of drugs, but the opiate dependence was something of a marvel—cocaine became freebasing, which was, oh god, how to describe it? Like warm orgasms? I fucking
"You should have talked about that," Harry tried, but Draco only shook his head to keep from hearing the words.
"Alright." A finger, the middle finger of Draco's free hand, pressed at Harry's lips. "Open up and suck."
, to Draco. He could hardly wait.
"You can," Draco said, "but that’s a story for another time." He paused for so long that Harry feared he’d broken the spell, but before he could figure out what to say, Draco spoke again.
Draco's voice rang clearly in Harry's mind, not the quiet remembrance he'd been living off of the past two days. It was wonderful to hear not the echo but the sound, even if it was—he wasn't sure what it was that they did with one another, exactly. Conversational Legilimency?
The thought was a passing one. "Lay face down," Draco spoke simply, but it was a command all the same. Harry did as he was told, hot cheek pressed against the cool sheet. It felt
"Can I help?" he asked. The look on Draco's face became open, revealing that other Draco he so desperately wanted—the soft, human one that took his breath away.
"Does it hurt?" he asked. Draco shook his head very slowly from side to side, and Harry accepted that as true.
"Yeah. Tea. Everyone has to eat sometime."
"In the last battle, I knew I had to die. I had to, properly. I called up ghosts to give me the strength to do it." He swallowed the lump in his throat. All the Victory Days he'd ever attended and he'd never talked about that moment. Speeches and talking and talking, and never saying anything about it. The thing that haunted him.
me than being taken
It was stunning. There wasn't another word for it.
"Double-cream brie," Draco said.
The man was resetting for a second shot, and Harry remembered himself this time, lowering his chin, facing the camera with his most practiced smile. This time the camera clicked and a thick cloud of smoke rolled out from its bottom, hiding the man entirely from sight. Harry continued his internal litany of curses, cursing the Ministry lifts, every single fucking one of them, for somehow rolling along at breakneck speeds and yet also, when it really counted, being so abysmally slow.
“Your brain might be saying no, but your body is saying absolutely, mate,” he said. “You can’t run on tea forever.”
Draco tasted a little bit salty, and Harry's cock throbbed at that tidbit of carnal knowledge. He was so hard he ached, pained for release. Harry removed his hand for a moment and licked a wet stripe from his wrist to the tip of his middle finger, watching as Draco's eyes followed his tongue all the while, and stepped closer, even the tiniest bit of friction between Draco's hip and his own erection enough to drive him to the edge. He wrapped his hand back around the base of Draco's cock and held on as his other tugged at his bollocks. Draco's sounds were small and hot as Harry's hand slid up and the long length back down, gaining speed.
The floor beneath them vibrated with Harry’s unbridled magic looking for release. It was getting worse, the outbursts. Draco was like a fever he'd caught, a constant, low burn simmering under his skin. Before Draco could taunt him for his loss of control, he said, "Fine, I pick this room," and Draco had simply smiled.
A shop worker with a thick black bob and an outrageous amount of show jewelry appeared from the door behind her, a small paper bag in hand. She was distracted by trying to stuff something more deeply into it, her arm disappearing into its depths as she approached them.
Because tonight Harry Potter turned twenty-three, and whether the wizarding world was ready or not, he was coming out of the closet.
It wasn’t really an accident, either. It couldn’t be, when his collection of transfigured pins was so vast.
"Has it always been like this?" Draco asked. "As hard as this?"
"And I do." Harry vanished the label-gunk pile and sat back, rarely so thankful for their server to arrive and deposit fresh drinks and bowls of Bombay mix on the table. The seconds were precious—more than enough for Harry to come up with a reasonable answer to Ron's question.
And Harry knew he should tell him that he wasn't trash, but instead he said. "But you had Noah." He latched onto that.
Malfoy didn't speak for a long time. "It was my home, Potter. It was supposed to be where I went to feel safe. And it became a place where I'd look at the hallway where I'd first ridden a broom, and only see the place where my aunt threatened my life or the corner where they piled up the bodies Greyback dragged in."
Harry did, flopping onto his back. His own cock remained dusky and so hard that it slapped flat against his belly.
"Are we not going to talk about it?" Harry directed the question at his knees.
Later, nursing apple cider, his toes curled against the heat of a roaring fire that Hermione had lit and Ron felt the need to adjust every few minutes, Harry sighed and said, "I saw Draco today. And, I—I think I have a chance." He hadn't had to look up to know the look his friends shared.
“Alright, Potter. Both hands. Now,” Newell instructed, and Harry gave a curt nod. “Watch the rib shards.”
"Uh, we'll see about that. If you're good, and we'll need to get you a broom first."
"What do you think—" he started.
He knew it was the truth, but that didn't mean that he believed it. He wanted very badly, just then, to be wrong.
"Because you haven't earned it," Draco barked. He realized he'd said too much, eyes widening before the mask came down. Something squirmed in Harry's stomach—saying that he hadn't earned it implied that he could. But how?
"You're beautiful," Harry said, and Draco shook his head as he pulled his trousers off, and Harry nearly swallowed his tongue. Under the billowing white fabric, he'd been wearing a jock, a white thong that barely contained his prick, the outline of it from root to crown clearly visible.
Draco gave a slow nod. His right hand pulled a packet of cigarettes from his jacket pocket, which he removed and threw on the table. He lit one with a little Muggle lighter and pulled a drag, tugging the ashtray closer with a finger. It was like he'd forgotten that magic was an option, and it irked Harry until he realized that perhaps his magic had abandoned him as it had once before.
. Never returns my calls. I think he blocked my number even." She sniffed, eyes burning holes in the wall separating her from her friend. "I don't want to talk to him, honestly."
"No, no, no. Nope. Not that bad, it hasn't gotten that bad. There's bad, and then there's—"
“I wanted a little bit of you in me all the time.” Draco’s answer had a weird echoey quality, projected back at Harry from within the sick bowl. “A keepsake.”
On his knees, head bobbing between Draco’s legs, there’s a moment when the bulbs in the track lighting of the kitchen flicker and pulse and he sucks off, head turning at the distraction.
… Draco’s P.O.V…
When the waiter came with their food, they also came with two more letters from Pansy.
“Sorry.” He mumbled and fell in step beside the Slytherin.
“Just stop okay?”
Harry rolled his eyes and waved the snitch in front of Draco’s face, “I still won though!”
“Harry m’boy!”
His heart hurt when he had to say that, but nothing should be allowed to stop him from keeping his Malfoy heritage. Even if he didn’t really care about it, the Wizarding World expected him to, as well as his mother, despite her earlier protests. So he had to keep it up.
Harry smirked, “Make me.”
He took it and unwrapped it. But when he saw what was in it he gasped and almost dropped it. Harry scooted over from his side of the couch and he too gasped in surprise.
“Me?” Harry asked though a mouthful of eggs.
“Will you call mummy?”
There’s a small corridor that leads from the entrance hall to the Great Hall, so when Filch is walking down there I run for it.
“Potter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked into his bright green eyes, and found mountains of pain and fear there. “Harry!” He shouted over the waves, “Snap out of it!”
“You’re awake!”
Harry was left with Neville, Luna, and Ginny. They made a stop at Honeydukes, then walked around a bit. What’s a Hogsmead visit without a trip to Honeydukes right?
“Fine! Just please… take this… blasted jinx… off of me!” He pleaded. Then he reached over, grabbed a pillow and tried to smack Draco with it. But the blonde ducked out of the way, laughing at Harry’s feeble attempts to hit him.
Draco started to make his way to the fireplace to Floo back to the Manor and face his mother. (His stomach was starting to feel queasy from all of the Apparating and Disapparating.) But as he was turning away he felt a hand grab his wrist. Harry had finally calmed down.
Hermione looks up from her toast, “Thank you Quinn! I was trying to explain to him why he’s pining, but alas.”
Then he noticed everyone in the room staring at him expectantly. So he gave Molly a stiff nod and said, “Thank you. And ummmm, I’m sorry for what happened to your son.”
“Let go then.” Ginny said, standing up.
“Maybe…” Harry mumbled, tearing open the envelope.
Harry nodded before getting a questioning look on his face. Draco knew what question was coming but he wasn’t prepared to answer. “Draco, what’s your patronus? I never asked.”
But his laugh was intoxicating nonetheless. And I could not stop staring at that damn rainbow hair!
The professor spun around and walked up to the chalkboard. “Not to worry Mr. Potter, I haven't introduced myself yet. Hello class. My name is Professor Lois Sadder. Although I have been called some not-so-nice names before, the worst of them being Book Germ and Nerdy Wolverine. So please, refrain from the nicknames.
“I thought you might come, so I put a little something together for Christmas.”
I glare at her defiantly, “I’m only watching him, because I *know* he’s up to something!”
The room went quiet.
“Ready to go?” He asked.
“Oh sorry, I didn’t mean to word it like that. It’s just, you seem to care about him a lot more than before.”
Then I notice his hair. It’s rainbow. Oh, shit. What the fuck. Is he- is he gay? I have a chance!
“Or what? You’ll run to daddy?” Harry had no idea what pushed him to do so, but he wanted to rile Malfoy up. Get him to react.
Draco noticed Harry nod and disappear back in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco pinched the bridge, “How exactly did you save the world? You act like a bloody child all the time!”
“It’s just… I’ve never been here with anyone else. Not even Ron and Hermione.”
I shake my head, “Sentimental sap.” I tease.
“Merlin Potter! You're so dense sometimes! I was awake that whole time!”
Harry suddenly felt a hot ball of anger at the pit of his stomach. Why was Malfoy prying in his personal business anyway?
Harry could feel his face start to heat up. “I don’t know, you’ll need help and I enjoy your company.”
Harry stumbled blindly into Grimmauld place. His head was spinning. After Draco had Apperated away he had just sat there on the tree with a stupid grin plastered to his face.
Harry picked up his goblet, “I hope she won't mind.”
Hermione leans across the table, “You mean Blaise Zambini the Slytherin?”
Everything stops. The world seems to be stuck in time.
He went to open the door, but Harry put a hand on his shoulder. “Uhh, thank you for helping me back there. I really appreciated it.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “That’s the whole reason I came isn’t it? We do this together.”
Harry gave a start, and turned to the man beside him. He took in the blonde’s figure carefully. The Slytherin stood on the very edge gazing down, posture relaxed. A look of longing in his eyes. Harry wondered whether or not he knew who he was with.
Harry’s eyebrows creased. “What?”
“And! I have not been stalking you.” He sighs, “Actually your friend Granger came to me today in the library. She told me about your less than adequate way of living in the summer. She said I ought to talk to you. She seemed to be under the impression that I could help. Because of the family issues that I have.”
“Harry!”
The game quickly wound down after that; everyone was a little on edge. Harry said goodnight to Ron and Hermione and climbed the stairs to the boy’s dorms. He walked all the way to the top room, on the door he saw a sign labeled: Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy.
Hermione waved him off, “Let us study in peace please!”
Harry was the first one to speak: “Hermione told me you were getting married soon.”
Hermione puts down her book. “With what?”
Harry was standing by a muggle machine. It was whirring and making weird noises. Draco rolled his eyes. He would never understand why muggles would make such things. Or why Harry would buy them.
Draco chuckled, “Not at all.”
Ivy popped in with an annoyed look on her face. “Yes Master Draco?”
I pull back from Draco and let my back slide down the wall. I place my head on my knees and wrap my arms around my body in an effort to hide from the world. Draco kneels down in front of me and tries to make eye contact, but I stubbornly refuse. I don’t want pity right now. I just want to wallow in sadness.
Harry glanced down at his letter, it had his name and Draco's address on it. He tore open the envelope, inside was a letter from Ron and Hermione.
He walked through the common room until he caught a glimpse of long red hair. He turned to see Ginny sitting by the fire with her legs crossed. She turned to look at him. Harry suddenly felt self conscious.
Ron did not, in fact, shut up. “You were always mocking him behind his back and making fun of him. But to his face you always looked like a cornered niffler!”
“But she wanted to hand me over.”
“I just assumed that you were part of the LGBTQ+ community by the way you defended that little girl. A lot of people would have turned a blind eye if they didn’t know her. But you didn’t, from what I hear you even used your ‘Savior’ card.”
“Please Potter,” Draco spat, venom in his voice, “Like I haven't survived it before. Do you think it was all cupcakes and peaches with Voldemort? No! He would torture all of us! Especially my mother.”
Narcissa stared at him, then walked over to sit on the edge of his bed. “What happened?” Her voice was so gentle, so Draco told her everything.
Draco kept going. Each time getting a little louder and a little louder. But never to the point of waking his mother. He was desperate to feel this pain and not the pain in his chest.
Draco gave a sharp nod. He didn't know why his whole demeanor changed so suddenly. But, sometimes he was like that. A balling baby one second and an emotionless statue the next.
Before Harry could say anything the house elf was grabbing his hand and Apperated them both up to what Harry assumed was a guest bedroom.
All of the Weasleys were looking at him. He managed to choke out a “Thank you” to Molly. She nodded, then went to pass out everyone else presents.
Hermione looked like she was trying to stifle a giggle. “Harry told you he was gay or bi right?”
“Yes, it’ll be every night soon.”
Draco face-palmed, “I know you’re oblivious, but do you look beyond the tip of your nose? Of course I like you! Why else would I invite you here? Or spend as much time with you as I do?”
On top of the Astronomy Tower:
Draco leaned forward, placing his forehead against Harry’s. He hoped that in singing this song he would reassure Harry that he wasn’t leaving any time soon. Even if times got tough.
“No, but seriously, can we be friends?” Potter said, wiping tears of laughter off of his face.
After confronting Hagrid, they had talked to Pan and Blaise about what they knew from their parents’ about the Chamber of Secrets, first edition, and Blaise had confirmed that it was known, in Pureblood circles, that Hagrid had been deemed responsible at the time, and it was also thought to be utterly ridiculous. Notwithstanding the fact that, albeit after spending some time in Azkaban, no proof had really been found against Hagrid, and Dumbledore giving him a job in a
“Does everyone know about me?” He asked very quietly, almost hoping Draco wouldn’t hear him, and offer no answer.
“You’re right.” Draco sighed. “He should know. Well, he should know that much. I don’t want to be kicking myself for not telling him if something happens to him again.”
Obviously, it was in that exact moment that Gilderoy Lockhart looked up, and his brilliant smile froze on his lips as his eyes fell upon Hal.
“What?” Draco croaked out, his breath catching in his throat.
“Not really.” Neville admitted. “Did they look confused?”
“Don’t move.” Rolf was telling him as Draco reached them. “What hurts?”
“Tell Hal he loves him?” Pan checked. “Yeah.” He answered when Anthony nodded.
“He’s an entitled little brat.” He assessed. “Just like his father was. They’re the kind who just take, and take, with no considerations for others.”
“Yeah, I know.” Hermione smiled back at him. “It was just a thought.”
“What is it?” He prompted.
“Magical signature?” Hal repeated, again looking for clarification.
“One day.” Hermione sighed. “You’ll be able to say that word without starting to say
“That’s right, ma’am.”
She felt a little pang, pre-emptively missing her son already, when the thought struck her that he was only there exceptionally for the weekend, that he would be back at school the next day and that she’d spent another two months, almost, of not seeing him. Again, Draco’s mood seemed to align to hers, his smile falling.
The Lowes eventually continued on what had been a family walk along the lake, turning about five times to wave back at Hal, until they were too far.
The rest of the boys snickered – Draco picked out two of the Quidditch players whose names he didn’t know nor cared about, and Jeremy Bullstrode, which was bad news. Due to the uncertainty of his family’s blood status, he had a reputation for wanting to prove himself to the likes of Flint.
He gave the gamekeeper a pointed look. He didn’t seem to care, or worry that the gigantic man could squash him like a bug. Or set a big dog on him. Or even a dragon, for that matter. Even if the students knew Hagrid was harmless – he was around the castle often enough, saying hello, telling people to stop calling him
“You’ve done this before, haven’t you?” He asked, though it wasn’t really a question.
“We’re coming.” Ron answered her.
He backed him up a bit, until Hal’s spine was pressing against the tree, and Nils was pressing against him. He was taller and wider than him, and Hal suddenly felt scared. Where exactly was this going? Kissing was exhilarating, it was a novel experience and it had been completely unexpected, but as incredible as it was that Nils – and Fran! – could be up for it, exploring this further right there and then seemed to be going a little to far.
Warning for uncomfortable memories of previous dub-con.
“Can you hear that?” Hal asked the rest of them.
“Leave this poor child alone! Corrupter! Murderer!” She made a beckoning gesture with both hands, looking frantic. “Come here, pet, let me help you.”
“I’m serious.” He insisted. “Mother, father.” He took another deep breath. “I- don’t feel right in this body. I’m a boy, inside, in my soul. I know it to be true.”
Draco could only hear white noise for the next minute, but he saw the blood drain from Lupin’s face as he looked away from Filch and back at Sirius in horrified understanding.
“I agree.” Hal said, earning himself a slightly surprised look from Ron. “Though I’m not sure what they’re going to be able to do.”
Hal, in fact, seemed to be channelling his inner Hermione as he planted his hands on his hips and looked up sternly.
” She waved her wand and the pitcher on his bedside table refilled with fresh water.
Hagrid gave him a look of absolute outrage.
. And whatever was happening in the school, being able to defend yourself could be no bad thing.
Pan’s moody air disappeared as quickly as smoke in a strong wind, and she stared at her Professor, mouth hanging open, like he’d just given her – him? Did Draco need to start thinking of her as him? – the best gift he could ever have given.
Draco did not think Harry Potter would be in his house – he didn’t see anything else but Slytherin for himself, and he knew most of the Potters had been Gryffindors. That might make being friends a little challenging, between those two houses especially, but Draco did not mind a challenge.
“Stop.” Hal begged. “Just, stop. I’m sorry that you went to prison.”
“Ley, honey, you’re at school all day, Hal is away, I’m at work… he’s too little.”
It slipped through his lips. He had not called her that in years, but then neither had she called him
Hal could feel himself blush, and Nils chuckled.
“Hi.” The specimen said. “Hey, I saw you on the news. You okay?”
Hermione had chosen various books for each of them, unsurprisingly, though maybe more so, they were all fiction. Muggle novels, more specifically, which delighted Pan and Draco, left Blaise affecting a sneer though his eyes were sparkling with interest, made Hal and Anthony laugh and Neville and Ron looking cautiously intrigued.
Everyone readily agreed.
But as they went through the rooms, she had become angered for a whole different reason. Although she doubted anyone else had understood the reference, she thought Hal hadn’t be far off when he’d mentioned Crackerjack. A big bad dog tricked with music, a – admittedly murderous – plant you learnt about in first year Herbology, ‘catch the key’ with a broomstick conveniently supplied, chess? It was like being in a game show for children. The only thing that was half a threat was the mountain troll, and even then, even if it had been awake, Hal, Anthony and Draco had already faced one before and had come out unscathed. Nothing about those “trials” would stop a grown wizard, let alone a dark one, if that was what Quirrell turned out to be.
“Oh, so you think it’s a mistake?”
“He saved my Draco’s life.”
“That wasn’t me!” Ron protested.
So, whatever the mirror was or did, it was changeable. Personal, maybe, showing people their parallel realities?
by Diggory as a proficient Captain and Quidditch player, as much as
Hal felt himself bristle. “I don’t think Draco needs me to be a good influence on him.” He snapped, his voice cracking and painful, but it needed to be said. “Or anyone else, for that matter.”
*             *
“This does not in any way give her the right to do that.” Draco replied vehemently.
“Come on then, quit trying.” Hal offered. “Let’s go play Exploding Snap with Seamus and Dean.”
Ron’s prediction about the summer final was that Bulgaria would absolutely be competing, because their Seeker would get them there (incidentally, the rest of the squad was pretty strong too) and that whoever they played, in fact even whoever won the actual game and Cup, Viktor Krum would catch the Snitch.
The Aurors ignored her, having already turned away to go over some details with Sirius and Dumbledore, but Lupin came closer and answered her in a slightly shaky voice, less visibly upset than the rest of them but clearly not unaffected by the events.
– it had been unexpected, he didn’t think anyone, anywhere, ever, had used that as a pet name, but he could imagine a younger Sirius joking about it and coining the term for him, what with Hal’s dad’s Animagus form. He liked it.
“What, your mom’s unhealthy obsession with me?” Hal joked.
kind of way.”
“Well no, haven’t you heard, it’s you this time.” Blaise joked.
Draco laughed too, albeit nervously. He hoped it wouldn’t be the latter.
“Fuck off already.” Pan pushed them towards the door.
“I believe it was wise of your grandfather to ask you to keep your distance.” Lupin smiled kindly. “They are very scary indeed – can anyone tell me why?”
An uncomfortable shiver rippled around the compartment.
“I don’t think you’re the Heir of Slytherin.” She suddenly told Hal.
“I’m fine.” Hal repeated, and it was a little bit truer this time around.
She raised a brow. “Hal? Bit pretentiously Shakespearean, but okay.”
poker face, thank you very much – he was able to relax and start having fun again, getting over the surprise that nothing had happened and all but forgetting about Flint in his corner. There was enough to concentrate with the countless little barbs from Pansy, the no-so-subtle way Vincent was always trying to see what everyone else was thinking before forming an opinion, and the casual questions from Blaise that somehow always managed to be about things that were wholly none of his business.
Hal turned to Ron, feeling his breath quicken.
Before any of them could say anything else, he directed the knight to take the opposite king. They all watched in horror as he was knocked off his horse, but as the defeated piece drop its sword, his voice rose out of the rubble.
It was very cool and convenient, but Hal thought, a little unfair to Muggleborn children, whose families didn’t have that recourse. But he figured, and from what little he’d gathered on the political climate from his friends, the Ministry of Magic had other priorities than to make things fair for Muggleborns.
There had been some occurrences, as children, before Hal knew what it was all about, where random people had started at him or congratulated him in the street, but they had always dismissed those, thinking they were either mental or were confusing him for someone else. Hal could tell Ley was remembering those instances now.
“Like I said, pretty much my entire life.” Pan said. “But it was something that was hard to understand for a long time, even for me, so I suppose I fully came to terms with it last summer. And I thought about it a lot during the year, and decided to go ahead with the physical transition.”
“Don’t insult me.” Pan snapped back, but there was humour in her voice.
They muttered some goodbyes, and Draco headed out. In doing so, he walked past where Flint and other older students were seated. The former looked up, and grinned at him again.
When Hal saw the clock go over midnight, and realised it was the first of September, he knew he wouldn’t be in King’s Cross by 11 o’clock. He’d miss the train. He had no idea how else he could get to Hogwarts – there was the Floo that Petunia had taken to visit him a few months back, but it had been disconnected since. He didn’t have a Portkey. He didn’t even have an owl to contact the school and ask what to do.
“Er, no, I can’t say I did.” Said Hal, who did not have the faintest what glowlice were, but they sounded disgusting.
“Harry, can we talk to you?” Fred called out as they approached him without prior greetings.
“A gift?” He said, looking a little confused.
Hal shrugged. “I suppose it wasn’t a coincidence that he was possessed by Voldemort, who already failed to kill me once. Not that this particular event has been clarified.”
He tipped the bag over, throwing its contents onto the floor, and kicking one of the books away for good measure.
“You should do the same, you know.”
The figures in the mirror weren’t static, and the fascination he felt looking at them didn’t fade. The cousins on his dad’s side seemed to be trying to push each other out of the way to get a better look at him. Every now and again, his mom would ruffle his hair, and his dad would nudge his shoulder. He almost thought he could feel it, but he knew it was wishful thinking. Ley and his little sister – he started thinking of her as Violet, because it would have made sense for her to get a flower’s name – were playing with the kitten around Hal, who’d eventually sat down.
“They just want to make sure I’m in no way connected to it. Guess they still see us as having been friends, and I do have a record in their eyes even if I’ve been cleared. I should be out soon enough, I just need to show willing.”
“I think you might be right.” Anthony acknowledged.
She went to then withdraw, but Narcissa put her other hand over hers.
Ron leaned in and asked in a whisper: “Is she always like this?”
visits to it over the years. Many would have welcomed him with open arms; even if he hadn’t been the Boy Who Lived, there were still families who had been close to the Potter line, in their loyalties if not by blood. The Malfoys themselves probably had been related at some point, before the Potter House ceased to be a Pureblood House. Best not look into bloodlines too closely, he’d learnt over the years.
Draco smiled tightly at that, storing the hurt with all the other ones he felt whenever Hal’s words were just what he wanted to hear, yet
“And ‘a swear, ‘a swear.” Hagrid shook his head. “Aragog never hurt a soul, he didn’t. He was just a lil’ one. Teaching him to speak, I was.”
“No, but you’re about to apologise for what happened last week.” Hal guessed. “So don’t. It wasn’t your fault.”
“Wait, and their best solution was to have you, even if you’re not meant to be even allowed to try out?” Ley looked impressed. “You’re that good?”
She brushed the hair off his forehead with a tender smile.
“Can we start talking about something less cringey?” Anthony pleaded.
Hal wasn’t sure if it really was an invitation or not – which Draco seemed to notice.
This was it. Time not to mess it up.
“See you tomorrow if I’m still alive, then.” Hal joked. “Cheers for your help down there, mate.”
He watched Harry make for the door with a little regret; he’d have liked to talk more. He may not be as famous as Harry Potter, but it was rare to meet someone who did not know the Malfoy name and hadn’t already made up his mind about him, his dead father, his aloof mother, and which branches of his extended family were the good or the bad ones.
*             *
He’d never particularly liked Christmas, he didn’t really see what the fuss was about at the best of times, but having been away at school, and realising he’d had more fun in these past few months than he’d had in years at home, he expected it to be an especially miserable one. He had never stopped to think about it, but with a new point of comparison, he was able to look back now and know he’d had a really dull life up to this point.
Hal sat up against the wall and picked it up gratefully. Unlike his sleep patterns, his appetite was as healthy as a thirteen year old boy’s should be.
“Like a… valet?” Hal said hesitantly.
“Like Nev said, as long as he’s got it under control.” Draco added.
“It’s cute.” Hermione deemed. “Suits him. He’s adorable.”
“Who?” He looked over his shoulder.
She knew this from one of Lily’s letters. An attempt at reconnecting with her sister, which Petunia had ignored. She had kept the letters, a part of her still then reluctant to throw them away, but had only read them years later.
2.	I picked Anthony Goldstein as another Ravenclaw to accompany Draco in this house, thinking he’d have more backstory than others, what with having ties to the Fantastic Beasts series and to Luna’s future husband, and he sort of took a life of his own. I was also inspired by the fandom wiki page about the "boy who kept a bezoar in his pocket", who sounds hilarious.
“You should go back to your Common Room.” He told them. “Then get food. It will help.”
Ley sagged in disappointment, but it didn’t last very long, as he snatched the letter from Harry’s hands to read it for himself. “This sounds ridiculous.” He commented. “I get why these people don’t want the rest of the world to know about them.”
They exchanged a look, and both cracked up laughing.
“I don’t think this is… me.” She said. “For a long time now, I’ve felt like… There’s been a mistake. I was given the wrong body. A girl body.” She added, almost in a whisper.
“Into who?” Blaise said disinterestedly.
“It wasn’t.” Hal interrupted. “It didn’t harm me. And I didn’t know it was from him before I opened it.” He added, surprising himself how genuinely defensive he felt and sounded, even as he made the whole thing up. “I would have been more careful otherwise, obviously. But I guess it was fine.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And?”
“How old were you?”
“Alright, Mister
Of course, this was when it backfired horribly.
“You’re right.” He admitted ruefully.
“We’ve come this far.” Ron interrupted Hal. “What would be the point in turning back now? You’re right, Hal. Whatever Quirrell is after, whatever he’s up to, it can’t be good if he’d go as far as trying to kill an eleven year-old boy.”
“We’ll find you some.” Draco inputted, and Hal appreciated the gesture.
At first I was going to include a way for Hal to encounter a Dementor and succeed in casting his stag Patronus, but I couldn’t think of a momentous enough way of doing it, then ran out of time because I’m giving birth tomorrow. Might be something I add if I come back to polish this fic later!
“New year.” Anthony smiled. “New pet.”
“Why me.” Hal complained one evening, exhausted by another day of fending off supporters and opponents in equal measures.
I do like the idea of Harry with darker skin, but I’m not sure that’s how I picture him here. I’ve not found my perfect cast!
“I’d love to meet that dog, if there’s an opportunity for it.” Rolf added, confirming he had not been fooled for a second.
“I don’t call her mom.” He carried on, feeling like he could tell Ron these things without being judged. “Because she’s not, I’m not going to rewrite that. But she raised me like she was. She raised us both as brothers. They’re my family, you know?”
That night after dinner, they met up in a corner of the Great Hall – where apparently, someone had started a Chess Club, and it delayed things somewhat as Ron wanted to join. They had to drag him off, though he did register and collect the information for the meets and tournaments throughout the year.
“Let’s go.” He told the girl, taking the lead again to ward off any dangers ahead, waving his wand so the stretcher carrying Potter would follow between them.
“I’ve got a bit of money saved up.” Pan said. “I was thinking of maybe getting a room at the Leaky Cauldron, or-”
They came to witness the tail end of an altercation that had Hal, hands balled up into fists, and Ley looking fierce beside him, standing between a girl on the verge of tears and an older, larger boy, with a little circle of other children around them.
“What the fuck.” Anthony blurted out. He sounded more shaken than Hal had ever heard him sound - that boy was
“You think the attacks could be from a snake?”
They were already at the top, waiting for the hatch to the classroom to open, when Hermione joined them, out of breath.
“Aw.” Hal looked down at himself. “I like this hoodie. It’s meant to match my eyes.”
“I always keep my students’ confidence unless they are a danger to themselves or others.” Severus pledged.
“They didn’t die in a car crash.” Hal retorted, his eyes flashing.
It still hurt. He hadn’t gotten a chance to see Hal in weeks, not since shopping in Diagon Alley, and he missed him. It seemed that since he’d admitted to himself that he missed Hal more strongly than anyone else, he only started to miss him even more cruelly.
Hal started training with Draco, and they were both pretty good at this. Snape made them perform
“I didn’t.” He replied with a wide grin. “I had faith.”
She nonetheless gave her a little vial of potion to carry with her at all times, should she come into contact the offending food again inadvertently.
“It’s not completely absurd.” Ron was the one to speak up and, more surprisingly, to point out the flaw in Hermione’s reasoning. “But if that was the case, then wouldn’t it have ‘refused’ to kill Hal’s dad too?”
“Oy.” Hal and Ron both said at the same time.
“I don’t want to be in the limelight.” Hal muttered.
“Oh, there you are. Speaking to your folks?”
Anthony stopped in his step, one foot in the air, then spun around to consider.
“Chaser.” Sirius confirmed. “I tried out for Keeper in fourth year, but I actually wasn't very good.” He added with a chuckle.
Hal paled. He didn’t have to ask what the man was referring to. “You were there?”
Sometimes Petunia wondered if things would have been different if she had picked up more on James’ genuine worry that something was
“It’s not…”
know what happened down there?”
Pan shrugged. “Could have been worse. They didn’t shout or cry or hit me or anything. Just pretty much told me to fuck off.”
“You were certainly the better looking of the lot.” Fran commented.
They waited for him to turn around the corner, before a laugh broke though Hal’s lips.
He really wanted to just go, now. This conversation hadn’t done much in way of making him feel better. But Dumbledore did not seem to be in a rush to let him out.
After a moment of not knowing what to say, Draco thought it was best not to make a big deal of the revelation by trying to comfort him. It would probably just make him feel worse. He couldn’t replace his cousin by suggesting to dress up with him, he couldn’t help him pretend Hogwarts was home, and he couldn’t make it any easier for him being days away from a date the wizarding world
Hal didn’t think there was a point in arguing, so he just looked down at the ground churlishly.
“Meanwhile.” Draco carried on. “There is a large three-headed dog in our school, so unless they take it out as entertainment for the Halloween feast, we have a mystery to solve, don’t we?
“I don’t care, I’m going in!” He pledged.
It took several more minutes and a lot of barking (both from Marge and her dog) to see them both out of the house, and by the time Petunia went upstairs, Ley was coming out of Hal’s room, looking worried and sad.
, which missed the man easily – Hal was clearly exhausted. When Lockhart retaliated, however, both Hal’s and Draco’s wands flew out of their hands.
“Mother, is it wrong to feel…” He started thoughtfully, then interrupted himself, but she encouraged him with a kind look. “It’s just…” He took a breath. “I did love father, and... I know you miss him.”
Hal couldn’t say anything, his throat tight, and Black took that as a need to carry on explaining himself.
“It doesn’t mean she doesn’t love me.” Draco said in a small voice.
“He was just making sure I was okay.” Hal justified like it was no big deal.
I be the Heir of Slytherin? I mean, I don’t know much about my family, but I thought they’d mostly gone to Gryffindor, and I’m in Gryffindor, and I know it doesn’t necessarily mean anything or I don’t know, but… I don’t know.” He repeated.
It wasn’t entirely true; he didn’t
“Climbed a tree.” He said. “Fell off the tree. A branch went right through my arm. It was ugly.”
“Either way.” She said. “This is a safe place.”
“Nothing, I told you.” Hal sighed. “Nothing helpful anyway. He told me I shouldn’t worry about Professor Quirrell, but I don’t know if he meant he didn’t think he’d done anything, or if he was keeping an eye on him.”
Three hours in – because they had decided either not to accept failure, or not to rest on their laurels, or both, and to have another crack at savoury – they had actually fallen into some kind of rhythm, perusing the recipes they had chosen and sharing out the tasks. At that point, it had become clear that Hal was a natural, and Ley was a disaster, so the division of labour was mostly Ley chopping and lining things up ready to be used, and Hal doing everything else.
She sighed, just as Ley, unhelpfully, whispered
“Says France is nice, too.” Pan added. “And that his cousin made him listen to some Muggle music, and I should check out something called
(See the end of the chapter for
“But you can’t catch it too soon.” Oliver carried on as if he hadn’t spoken – which was probably for the best. “We’re two hundred points down. If you end the game before we’ve closed the gap, we’ll lose.”
It was beautiful, as far as luggage can be, and looked insanely expensive. With that and the aristocratic way in which he spoke, Hal started to see what the boy meant about his “noble” family.
“Well, everyone at school was talking about it.” Ley said. “Some people I’m pretty sure I had never spoken to before have asked me if you’re alright and told me how hard it must be.”
, which was gross and in a lot of people’s opinions, highly inappropriate to unleash among minors – deliver valentines. Cards, notes, chocolates, flowers, bloody
Draco’s face fell.
“That’s a shame.” She said easily. “I bet they would have some interesting things to say.”
“My aunt is waiting for me.” He said, truthfully. “Thank you for your help.”
“You spoke Parseltongue.” Snape stated.
Lupin wasn’t forcing anyone to face the Boggart in front of the whole class, though those who chose not to would have to hand in an extra foot of parchment, to at least give the theory of what shape they thought the Boggart would have taken and what they would have done to counter it. The professor had promised these revelations would remain entirely confidential and that he was there to talk if anyone wanted to discuss something specific with him. Draco was still not about to tell the truth – he’d make up something about being terribly afraid of bees, or something as plausibly mortifying if it were to be revealed in front of classmates, yet not so damaging for his teacher to know.
“No. But you’re the one who’s been seen talking to snakes.”
“They don’t even think he’s actually coming this way.” Hal added – this to reassure Ron, who had gone a little grey since hearing the news.
Hal was quietly explaining to Ley how it worked and how weird it felt, when the fire roared green, indicating Andromeda had connected the line. Draco felt himself stand a little straighter, just as he noticed his mother doing the same.
“You- What?”
As it turned out, she hadn’t been that far off. Hal himself has suspected whatever he’d have to do would be Lockhart-centric, but he hadn’t imagined it’d go so far as helping him answer bloody fan mail. What was this man doing being a teacher? What had Dumbledore been on when he’d thought that was a good idea? Surely, with one magic school in the whole of Great Britain, there were other candidates for the post. Surely not
“Hal’s right, Hagrid.” Draco intervened. “There’s a reason why we have dragon sanctuaries.”
– which surprisingly, given how they both doubled over laughing, came from neither Fred nor George, but actually Percy.
“If that’s the rumour that he’s Bridget Kildare’s new boyfriend, she’s still dating Cassius Warrington.”
Of course, when by the end of the game Hal was lying in a pool of his own blood with his skull cracked half open, he was sure Oliver didn’t quite mean it like that.
“You could get seriously hurt.” Neville agreed.
“How do you come up with these things?” Ron managed to ask when he wasn’t doubled over in hilarity.
Thanks for reading, comments will definitely reach me even if I don’t answer or post for a while, so feel free to leave plenty! Love to all.
“Do you think he’ll take him to the sanctuary?” He asked.
A few hands were raised, and Lupin pointed to Lavender.
“Anyway.” He insisted. “You
“I’m afraid I don’t intend on making it easy for you.” Draco replied with a smile.
Amusement turned to thoughtfulness again. “Yeah.” Draco murmured. “It is.”
Even the Gryffindors, now, were eyeing him with suspicion, with the exception of Neville, Ron and Hermione of course, Dean and Seamus who claimed they would have noticed if Hal was sneaking out all the time to do nefarious deeds, and Fred and George (and probably Lee alongside them) who found the whole idea simply hilarious.
“Damn, listen to us. We’re eleven and we’re going on like sad old men.” He looked up, a twinkle back in his eyes. “Come on. Let’s get down before all the food is gone.”
“It’s easy to be close when you live together for years, but after school…”
“Just…” Hermione sighed, and squeezed his wrist. “We’ll be right back with teachers, okay? Stay hidden if you can, and if he attack you, you
Hal realised just how much he’d missed his aunt when he was wrapped into her arms, laughing and breathing in her familiar scent.
“Yes.” Hal confirmed flatly.
Draco remained silent for long enough – at least it seemed long to Hal’s fuzzy brain – that he had to open his eyes again to check his friend was still there. He was, frowning slightly.
is one of them.” He said with some humour.
. Lockhart, in a particularly bright moment, decided it would be lovely to have a troupe of dwarves – dressed as cupids, so with wings strapped to their backs and otherwise pretty much only wearing
“See, nobody who wanted to
. They had combed through his entire work and, using numerous other references, cross-checked (and crossed out) every detail to end up with accounts that had a lot less flourish, for sure, but were also infinitely more accurate, while being quite funny in the way they took him down. Hermione snorted at that, and rolled her eyes at the little dig to her previous and very much bygone admiration for Lockhart, but she was sure to admire the work that went into those.
“That memory could have killed Draco.” Hal pointed out, face still in his hands. “It doesn’t matter if he’s not strong enough on its own – he’s still strong enough to use other people or things for his purpose. Draco could have died. I could have died.
Her dog barked behind her, and Petunia now forced herself to smile.
They both looked about ready to combust. Under the pretence of walking over to wrap a towel around her son, Petunia came protectively closer to Hal, smiling politely at the two witches (they had to be). Although, the mother pulled a mobile phone out of her pocket, and turned around to have an excited conversation with whoever she called.
There was an insert from a bank, with information and exchange rates to change pounds for things called galleons and sickles (five pounds to a galleon, that sounded like a fairly strong currency).
“What are
“Aw.” She cooed. “You’re all in love.”
The trumpeting voice made him jump, and he couldn’t stop himself from wincing at the sight of his dear old Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.
The Tienmans and the rest of Hal and Ley’s friends are OCs, and they’re only there as background characters and for plot purposes.
“That’s cool.” Harry beamed.
Rolf was sat cross-legged, looking absolutely serene, still playing the flute to the ginormous – and thankfully asleep – Cerberus. He acknowledged them by widening his eyes, but he didn’t stop playing.
“For intelligence beyond her years, and for solving a riddle for which failure could have been death, fifty points to Hermione Granger.”
“Awesome.” Ley nodded with a wide grin.
“Then I will speak to you soon, Mister Parkinson.”
“Oh, because yours was so likely to happen?” Ron laughed.
She made shooing gestures with her hands, and the three of them skirted around the unconscious troll to get out of the way. As they passed the group of teachers, Hal paused.
“Morning.” Hal greeted her sleepily from where he stood at the sink, a glass of water in hand.
“Alright, ready to go!” The young woman pushed them both forward.
about it in the books.”
Ron was already at the other end, trying the key he’d grabbed off Hal. Hermione patted Draco’s arm in reassurance, and he was off.
“Yes, precious Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Famous Harry Potter, who thinks everything will be handed to him.”
She straightened back up and looked at Petunia and the other parents reassuringly. “I can take it from here.”
, so Pan couldn’t make good on his threat to go tell Hal himself. He was good for his word that way. Usually.
Ron grumbled something that sounded like
Draco refrained from rolling his eyes.
“If it helps.” Draco said hesitantly. “They were mostly just arguing if it was really you, and saying you’re cute.”
Draco understood why Hal had missed the train. He really did. He’d spoken to Hermione, and she had explained – his cousin was in hospital, it was only fair. Draco thought, if he’d had a brother or someone in his life this close to one, he’d have done the same.
“Only if he’s near.” Hal pointed out.
“My friend Emily from back home is studying the Greek mythology at school, and I was curious to see what the links were between the creatures in the myths and real fantastic beasts. I love your grandfather’s book, by the way. But anyway, she has to pick a creature and do a presentation on it, not only about Greek myths but also including any presence of that creature or a similar one in other lore, and I told her Em, you’ve got to pick Cerberus – because I remembered reading something about three-headed dogs in a book here and I thought, Oh that’s interesting! You know for example I did not find any evidence that hydras or gorgons are a thing, though maybe they were and they’re extinct, but Cerberus dogs are still around and I thought well
“Doesn’t mean they didn’t try. Whatever they were looking for had already been removed. What if…”
“Yeah.” Anthony grinned widely, as Rolf regarded all of them, obviously much too interested by the answer, with a curious look. “Hypothetically.”
“I’ll give you some money, alright?” Draco spat out. “Can I go to class now?”
“Yeah?” He encouraged with a smile.
When they got to the Head of House’s office, and found Draco and Neville sitting there – Draco looking paler than a ghost, and Neville quietly crying – they all reached the same conclusion.
“Mother, you didn’t have to.” He said quietly.
Ron rolled his eyes, but he dropped it. Instead, he turned to Draco.
“Stop saying first year exams.” Anthony winced.
“Go.” Neville gave a small jerk of his head towards the door. “I’ll hold it off.”
She waved her wand all over him, no doubt casting diagnosis spells, and seemed more or less satisfied with the readings.
“Over being queer and unacceptable, therefore rejected and disowned by your family, yes.”
Ron let out a little whine. “I hate it when you’re right.”
Okay, that part maybe wasn’t so good, Hal thought. He took a small step back, waiting to see someone appear from somewhere or other. He was tempted to draw out his wand, but what good would it do him? He didn’t know any duelling spells, not even protection spells. He hoped, if push came to shove, he’d be able to instinctively react, the same way he had shielded himself and Draco against the troll, the same way he’d cushioned his fall down the starts.
“Of course.” Hal nodded energetically.
“I hope I’m in Gryffindor like you!” Thomas said enthusiastically.
“Decent flying out there, little bird.”
“Small budget.” He’d instructed. “Those of you with big fortunes, don’t be dickheads about it, because the rest of us won’t be gifting above our means.”
“I want to be a man.” She said quickly. “For real. Permanently. When I grow up, I mean. I think I want… You know how there’s spells and potions to…” She stopped, a blush creeping up her cheeks. “It’s stupid.” She muttered.
“It’s bloody freezing.” He commented. “But I’ve just learnt a warming spell. Want to walk for a bit longer?”
Sirius shrugged. “Not really. What mattered to me was for my name to be cleared, and that’s done. If Peter can be convicted, that’d be nice too, otherwise I might go and commit actual murder.”
“Thank you, Hermione.” Draco nodded his head to her, trying very hard not to laugh in Ron’s outraged face. “Besides.” He added with a sigh. “Gits or not, I’ll probably end up marrying one of them, so.”
“I see.”
It defused the tension immediately – he was good at that, Draco had to hand it to him.
“I am afraid so, as Mister Potter has guessed.” McGonagall continued sombrely. “Miss Granger was found petrified a short while ago, as well as Miss Clearwater from Ravenclaw.”
Hal opened and closed his mouth, not sure what to make of that advice. He did know, of course, that some people dated boys, then girls, or vice versa. But he’d always heard of that as ‘phases’. He didn’t want to go through phases. He just wanted to figure out what would make him happy.
“I’ll miss you.” He told them when he stepped back, making a point of looking at Ley too.
Draco did not fully believe Hagrid had
“But-”
“Or that my scar is acting like a sensor for people who don’t like me.” Hal added humourlessly. “Also a bit of a stretch.”
Hal hummed thoughtfully, looking at the corridor they started walking through – since the stairs had fucked off again, leaving them with no way down in the direction they’d just come from.
Taking advantage of Seamus and Dean suddenly, and with excellent timing, starting an impromptu game of football – Dean had been very intense in trying to make the Muggle sport popular among his classmates – and the others’ attention being diverted for a moment, Draco turned to Pan to hiss between his teeth.
“I said he could be prickly.” Draco argued. “It’s hardly the same as-”
Hal wasn’t sure he agreed with that, but he only answered with another groan, and inwardly resolved to never, ever, under any circumstances, give Lockhart any indication that he was quite good at drawing, in case he actually got the same idea as Hermione.
“For being ready to face a troll, and for getting a wounded friend out of the line of fire, twenty points to Anthony Goldstein.”
“Did she send you to speak to me?” Petunia had asked scornfully.
“Oh, see, that’s what I was talking about.” Hermione said behind him. “Myrtle’s flooded the corridor again. She does that when she gets-”
Hal grinned. “I met Charlie Weasley.” He said.
Then, then Hal actually felt the true meaning of
He followed the same gestures Lockhart had done, but he didn’t expect the puff of powdery smoke that rose up when he stepped in, and made him cough and splutter something like “Hogwa-hrt-tch-Derhk-fish!”
She finally stopped for breath, while they all looked at her in slight disbelief.
He returned looking conspiratorial as he pulled another wand out of its box and handed it to Hal reverently.
a good flyer. Doesn't take an exciting game to see that. James would have loved it.” He swallowed, his throat clearly tight and a sheen over his eyes. “He'd have loved teaching you. And flying with you. Merlin, you two would probably have been out every weekend. Lily would have gone mental.”
“Well, not in any harmful way of course. But knowing a few defensive spells, and if you don’t mind me saying, a few offensive ones, can go a long way in protecting your life! Many a time, in my adventures…”
When Neville spoke next, it was in such a small voice Hal almost missed it. “Mine’s on the second.”
“He had a few choice words about my father.” Pan reported. “And he says to say thanks, you know, for not letting me be homeless.”
Hal had his phone in his bag and for a minute he thought of calling his aunt, but it was Tuesday morning, she would be in work. Besides, he didn’t really want her to hear him in this state – she would fret. She had always fretted whenever Ley or Hal had been sick in the past, worrying too much in their opinion, until they had understood that both their grandparents had died of flu, and it was harmless to let her fret if it made her feel better.
Suddenly a glob of cake hit the side of his head. He turned, and to his surprise, Hermione was looking at him smugly. “That’s what you get.” She said and stuck her tongue out.
If this had been anybody else Draco would have said that they looked adorable. But this was Harry Potter, the Boy who Won’t Fucking Die Already. There is no way that Draco thought he was cute.
Hermione rolls her eyes grudgingly, but agrees.
Ron shrugged “Why not?”
I hear footsteps behind me as I turn down the next corridor.
I can't wait for my Weasley jumper.
Draco ignored his jab and started to sing.
I plop down at the Gryffindor table, still lost in my thoughts.
When Harry arrived in Transfiguration he was disheveled. He had rips in his robe where the owls had pecked him to death. The new Transfiguration teacher looked at him with pity. Just as everyone else had.
“Stop pouting Potter. You’re acting like a child.”
Sceptical glances were sent her way.
“You seem happy today.” Draco said mildly, sipping from his mug.
Malfoy reached out a hand, Harry reached out his. But he missed. Swiveling back around he saw a fiery tiger lunge for the tower. Then he saw Ron and Hermione swooping out with an unconscious Goyle on their broom. But Malfoy was still in there!
Harry laughed breathlessly, “Yes!”
“What! You have to admit, it would be weird if your sister started dating your best friend!”
Doing that reminded Harry of how grey Draco’s eyes were. “You have the most beautiful eyes.” He whispered, “They’re a soft grey, and they sparkle whenever you talk about something you love.”
Then Harry burst out laughing.
When he slaughters back he says, “Spit, spot Potter! You're wasting time.”
Draco shrugged, “Maybe she’s hiding something from me.”
Harry gave the redhead a look.
Harry gave him a glare, but didn't say anything.
Ginny ignored him, “I bet it’s Malfoy. You two are always dancing around each other.”
“Well then respond now.”
Behind them there was a crash and a thump. Both whipped around to find an old owl struggling on the floor.
Harry's eyes widened, and then he was collapsing on the mattress, giggling and gasping for breath as the Tickling Charm took effect.
Narcissa pushed him away, “Yes! Just go with your boyfriend! It’s about time you two got together!”
“Regardless, I always went out of my way to make his life miserable.”
Harry walked down several flights of stairs, and stopped when he reached an alcove. The same alcove that he and Ginny would spend hours in. Just talking. He smiled at the memory and continued throughout the castle.
Then Draco heard the trap door bang open. Lucius spun around to face the invader. It was Harry.
Harry lay on his back in bed two hours later, having skipped dinner. His eyes were wet.
Luckily Harry came back levitating four bottles of Butterbeer. It was quite an enjoyable night, although Draco couldn’t look Hermione in the eye.
“I’m sorry I didn’t get you a present. When I was discharged they told me to stay at home, and that I couldn't go out. I didn’t want to go back to the Manor after everything, so I ended up staying at the Hospital, but they wouldn’t let me go out to get you anything-”
Draco looked at him and tried to keep his breathing steady, “How is what possible?”
He walked over to stand by Harry’s side.
She rolled her eyes, “Oh please. We both know that’s a lie! Where were you?”
“More like Malfoysexual.”
“Why not just ask Granger?”
Harry was eating a chocolate frog when Ginny got an idea. “I think I’m going to get my hair cut.”
Harry didn’t answer, he just grabbed Draco’s wrist and pulled him into side-along.
Harry hesitated, but eventually brushed the back of his hand to Malfoy's. The blonde flinched away, but physical touch seemed to bring him back to the present.
“Well you see, I may or may not have a crush on your ex-girlfriend. And since you and I are friends I just thought I should ask if-”
For the first time in history a Weasley was holding out a hand to a Malfoy. It was a revolutionary experience. Worthy of its own book. So Draco took the hand and shook it firmly. Weasley gave a nod and swept from the room.
The desperation must have shown in his eyes, because the blonde sighed and sat back down.
“You’re nice to them.” Harry commented mildly.
“Any time.”
“Is there anyone else you could ask?” Ron chided, “You know I’m shit at potions.”
Fuck.
I look up, Hermione is looking at me expectantly.
Malfoy put his hand on the door knob, about to open it to the swarm of owls.
Crash.
Draco muttered something about the loo and left the others. He crossed the pub and stepped outside. He slid down the wall to the ground putting his face in his hands.
Draco tensed, “Did she?” He spat, scooting back out of Harry’s grasp.
Harry stared down at his feet and shook his head, feeling like a scolded child.
“Merlin Potter! Must you be so…”
He shrugged, “Fourth year I think.”
“I will fight,
“Okay.” Harry turned back to his essay.
Draco smirked a little, “Is the Savior of the Wizarding World being horny? Who knew I'd be the one to witness it.”
Sadder smiled, “I’m glad you feel that way.”
He jumped and tackled Draco to the ground, hugging him tightly. Draco laughed and hugged him back. His heart was filled with happiness as they stood up and he put the ring on Harry’s finger.
“And I will stay,
“I went back to the Manor with my mother. I was glad to be given time to recover, but it wasn’t enough. And the Manor,” Draco shivered, “There’s so many bad memories, and it’s so dreary all the time. My mother would never leave her room, I doubt she would even leave her bed. It was a sad, dark time.
"What, because you were too drunk to notice it was me?" He bit his lip, wishing he could draw up some anger instead of the rising tide of panic constricting his chest. "Can you not make fun right now, Malfoy? I'm at the end of my rope."
"Don't you need a copy?"
Draco's lips quirked. "Yes, an excellent thing. I have, however," he said, "learned to be discrete. Do we have a problem?"
"Don't you
Draco dragged a hand through his hair, practically snarling, and Harry knew he would be hurt by the words he lashed out with.
fucking hurt. Bruised ribs were no joke.
Harry waited to be flooded with thousands of harried thoughts that buzzed like bees, but instead, his mind was blank. It felt like that moment following an explosion when the high-pitched whine was everything, the screen behind your eyelids white or black, or worse, red if there was fire beyond them. There was nothing to do but wait until the sound and sensation all crashed back in. He always did go numb when someone died. It was easiest that way, but now he didn’t know how to stop it from happening. He wanted to be in the room. He wanted to
"Always," she'd said meaningfully over the phone, and Harry couldn't fault her for that. At that point, she hadn't slept in almost two days, stick-handling requests from the press about the Harry-Justin fiasco, and calls from other clients who had heard rumours of her being pulled into Auror headquarters for questioning, and Harry's icy silence. And through that, she'd done right by him. Threatened the pants off most of the junior and some of the senior staff at the Prophet about daring to print with anything featuring even a whiff of who "the other man" could be that drove "the two love-birds apart" and assuaged the many wealthy and well-connected people that Harry had driven to madness by his sudden and last-minute cancellations of
"How so?"
"That's big of you," Harry said. He clenched his fists, the
"Then I had to portkey to Wales first thing, and half the press corps was there to greet me, and these new eyeglass frames are too tight, so I’ve had the same fucking headache since Thursday. Not to mention that half of the Weasleys seem—is there a word for it? Let down by my being gay?"
"That's not fair," Harry said. He surprised himself in saying it.
"Of course." He smiled demurely. "Everything's perfectly alright with me."
"Am not. Keep squinting like that, and you'll give yourself wrinkles," Harry said, looking up, locking eyes with him. A stare with Malfoy always felt like a challenge.
"Just do what I do—write your Gringotts vault number and your donation amount on some parchment and palm it into the host's hand as you shake it goodbye.”
"I'm sorry," Harry said with a sigh, "I didn't mean to do that. Specifically."
"Cotton?" Hiccups interrupted the syllables. "You make silk, normally."
Harry snorted. "You apparently." Draco dropped back to lie down, as petulant as Harry imagined a very young Draco would have been. It was so easy to imagine, vivid in his mind's eye that Harry considered that this wasn't such a new occurrence, after all. "I would have done too when I was younger if I'd let myself. The amount of social anxiety I used to have about these things is astonishing—have I ever told you about the lead up to my first Winter Ball?"
Draco enjoyed needling him, even if it wasn't necessary. Especially if it wasn't, which was something he'd always done.
"He has no
“I think,” he hiccoughed ominously. “I think I’m gonna be seasick.”
"I didn't mean to." Harry tried for a smile that would grant him leniency. "I had a long day, was all."
"Tell me, though. Is it good?"
"Yeah," Harry sighed, "it is."
“There’s you, needing this thing only I can give you. It’s only me, and you know it! For a Gryffindor—”
His thumb was full in his mouth before the taste hit, and Harry had to hold back the urge vomit. He removed the digit gingerly, grimacing his way through one last smile and hand-wave to the witch departing the restaurant. As soon as her bodyguard opened the door and she turned away, Harry dropped into his chair and gulped at the glass of water before him as though nothing would ever slake his thirst. Finishing it only to find that the explosion of a foul taste in his mouth had not been washed away, he stuffed a leftover roll into his mouth, and then, desperate, another.
"You're joking," he breathed.
"Aren’t you?" Harry asked. Draco finally looked him in the face, a perfect poker face, his eyes bright and clear. He didn’t enter Harry’s mind but sent instead wisp of something gentle that muffled his increasingly hysterical thoughts. It was like sitting in a dark, stuffy room during a stressful examination and turning to discover a window open to a pastoral scene, all green rolling hills and fluffy clouds floating past. He was still in a stressful place, but he didn’t care so much. Harry could practically smell sweet spring air, could feel it fill his lungs, worry expunged just as soon as it had entered.
Harry looked in and found a small plastic bin for rubbish, more towels, a scale, and a basket full of hair ribbons and ties and bobby pins of every make and colour. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing at all that could account for Draco's eyes following him as he stood and closed the cupboard door, a misshapen black hair tie in hand.
, he consoled himself,
Harry was after was, and now this, his friends taking notice and poking fun where fun oughtn't to be had.
"We," Draco said. He raised a brow and made a humming sound, and Harry's heart was ready to beat right up his throat and out of his mouth.
He nodded, wondering where this was going.
Harry cocked a brow. "I thought I was a show-off."
Harry swallowed thickly. "Be serious."
Above his head, Draco's hands were busy unbuttoning his shirt. Harry had never navigated undoing a belt with his teeth before but found it a welcome challenge. He managed to pull most of the leather strap free from the loop, but it wasn’t his most coordinated effort, even he could admit that.
"What for?" Harry asked dazedly. He waved his hand to clean them both up and then collapsed deeper into the mattress, wishing for sleep. His arse throbbed a little, and he felt the strange urge for Draco to stay for as long as Harry could still feel the aftereffects of their sex—to stay until Harry couldn't feel him anymore. To part now would leave him bereft. He didn't want to be without the one thing—one person—he wanted more than anything at that moment.
"I've been staying busy, to keep from—" he wanted to say
and not have people bat an eye anymore? How would he make small talk with members of a pureblood family his own had openly mocked as blood-traitors?
"At the time, I told myself that she was warning me to be careful about whether I took the Mark because it would limit the pool of women I could marry. But since she's left I keep thinking about it, and how I think she knew, then, about me. That I was gay, I mean. Mother's know, don't they?"
She returned to rattle a few teal-coloured tablets from a bottle into Harry's palm. When he raised an eyebrow at her, she shook the bottle in his face.
"Inside of me," Draco whispered as Harry trembled with the force of his orgasm, moments of tension followed by groaning, wet release into Draco. He marvelled at how his own come added wetness to his final thrusts that he could feel and only made him want to be able to fuck into Draco forever, just a little more, never wanting to stop.
there I'm joining for a sex ritual at the vernal equinox."
“She misses you, you know.” Luna informed him softly, studying his face. “I hear about it a lot.”
He turned to Harry, for his hand had just clenched painfully around Draco’s. But the raven haired boy was standing stock still, his face stony.
Draco stared at him in disbelief, “You mean to tell me that the The Boy who Lived Twice has never shagged anyone in his life!”
He stumbled out of his bed and into the bathroom. He fumbled around the drawers until he found a toothbrush.
*unpause*
Harry smirked, thinking quickly, “Oh please, I have connections everywhere. And you said it yourself, I’m the 'Savior.’ If I wanted to get someone expelled I definitely could. Or I could make a law that says that you three could never get jobs. That’s how.”
“What colors?” Draco asked.
“You know what, fine! If you don’t want help then you're not getting any from me!”
He’s a mean, racist, bigoted jerk.
Draco nodded, looking a little more comfortable. “Alright, let’s go.”
Draco shrugged, studying Harry closely, “Okay, but I’m always here.”
With that Narcissa left. Sighing heavily, Draco sat down and began to eat. Narcissa could be a fluffy kitten, and sometimes she could be a hornet. That stings you multiple times.
“Hey.” He said.
“Harry, please. Back up. He needs some space.”
“No I wasn't!”
Draco heard the thump of Harry sitting down next to him. But the blonde kept his head firmly in his arms. He didn’t feel like talking. Harry seemed to understand that because he just sat there.
I’m sorry. I’m really, really sorry. I know I  should have never said that. I regret it. I’m really sorry if this is a little sloppy. I’m not really good at this ‘apologizing’ thing. You suggested a letter to me at one point, so I thought I’d try it out.
He could see the pool of red liquid around him. But he didn't care.
Why were the Weasleys so nice?
“Potter, I’m trying to dust something here.”
“Ginny! That's great!” I exclaim. “You’ve been pining after her for how long? Two years?”
I shoot them a glare. They just smile wider and return to their shepherds pie.
He leaned down to whisper, “Potter, for the last time! I’m not cute.”
“That’s your patronus isn’t it?”
Harry shrugged, “I don’t know… Fuck. You guys are right. No wonder his arse looks so good in his Unspeakable robes.”
“You certainly have.”
Soon all of them were welcoming him back. Draco felt a little overwhelmed from all of the hands clapping his shoulders, but he would be lying if he said he didn’t have a warm fuzzy feeling in his stomach.
Harry’s shoulders were shaking and his face was in his hands. He looked so vulnerable that Draco thought he might make something explode from pity. Instead he did something that his younger self would have cursed him for: He wrapped his shaking arms around Harry Potter and pulled him closer.
“She’s… improving.” Draco said, avoiding the Gryffindor’s gaze.
‘All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault.’
“I just kissed you! What more do I have to do to proclaim my love for the Boy who Lived Twice?”
So don't give up on me.”
He pulls me up and intertwines our fingers. I look into those damn silver eyes. It’ll be the last time I see them. I notice for the first time how many colors there actually are. They're all there swirling amongst the grey.
Then he was gone.
Draco himself was brimming with happiness as he sang.
I examine the cluster of stars before saying, “The right side kinda looks like a dick.”
Draco jumped. He had forgotten Harry was standing beside him. He turned his head.
Draco felt a searing pain in his stomach, but nothing more. The Time-Turner gave a feeble twitch, but it was obviously affected.
His own wand was still in the room with Harry. But how did Lucius get in here anyway?
“You can feel my magical signature because of what happened in the bathroom in 6th year.” Harry said, “And you said that it felt like it had changed. You also said that you could feel Voldemort's signature. I think what you were feeling was part of Voldemort’s soul.”
“Malfoy!” Ron said scrambling off of him (since when was he Ron?). “What are you doing here?”
“Of course!”
Draco didn’t even try to argue; when Harry had his mind set on something there was little anyone could do to stop him.
“You. You foul loathsome evil little cockroach!”
Colherback nodded and left his office.
Harry cleared his throat, “Well, anyway. I best be off.”
“Oh wow- Harry, that’s great!” He could tell that Neville was trying to hide his surprise.
Almost on cue Healer Martian opened the door. “Mr. Potter!” He said in surprise when he spotted Harry. “Are you here to see Mr. Malfoy?”
‘Hellooo friend.’ It hissed.
“Now who’s being the sentimental sap?” Draco picks me up, spins me around and slams our lips together. I laugh. This is the most light hearted I’ve felt since the Department of Mysteries.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Harry and Draco appeared right in front of the Burrow on Christmas morning. As Harry started forward, the blonde held back.
Harry looked back at Malfoy.
The first one turned around, then realizing that he was alone, basically bolted.
He said the spell again, this time a little louder. A second gash popped up, right next to the first. He still didn't care.
Oddly enough Draco wasn’t revolted. He relaxed and wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him in close. A rather Gryffindor move in his opinion.
“I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her didn’t you?”
“Maybe the fact that he dresses super proper even if it’s just a night at the bar. Or that he is the biggest drama queen. Or maybe it’s because he spends hours on his hair and gets annoyed if one strand is out of place! Or those fucking boots? His while being just screams: ‘I'm gay!’”
“Hey Draco. What are you doing for the holidays?”
I turn and expect a bushy haired girl, but instead I see a person with short, bright red hair.
Draco stands up and rushes over. I bury my face in his shoulder, and he wraps his strong arms around me.
Harry glared at her, although the effect was ruined by the wide grin on his face.
“You mean Death Eaters?”
Draco started to hyperventilate. He tended to overthink and get worked up over the smallest things.
I hear Malloy say, “Merlin Potter! Your attempts to ignore me are futile, I can tell.” But I couldn’t care less.
After several painstaking minutes Harry had stopped crying, and was looking at Draco. “You might not like me asking, but why is your boggart your dad?”
He flicked his wand and a giant ball of light floated to the center of the room. He walked around examining everything closely and looking for what might have caused a banging noise.
Draco groaned. Why him? ‘Just get this case over with and be done.’ He thought, ‘Then you can go back to hating him.’
Dudley cornering me in tight spaces and watching as I freak out.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Harry cut over him. “He hasn’t eaten at all today.”
“I’m so sorry.” Harry mumbled into the cotton of Draco’s nightshirt. He didn’t respond. When Harry looked back up he found tears streaming down the Slytherin’s face. He reached up to wipe them off, then stiffened when he realized their faces were inches apart.
Harry’s eyes widened, “No way! Me too!”
Draco rolled his eyes; the stupid Gryffindor stubbornness was giving him a headache. He turned around and ran his wand over the hole one last time. There was something there, but it was hard to detect. It was sort of like a magical signature, but it felt too familiar…
Harry had to think about it for a bit. “Draco…”
Malfoy’s voice softened, “Why do you cut? Why do you feel as if you need to self harm?”
“Yeah.” Hal sighed. “But it’s going well, he’s getting there. Actually…” He hesitated.
The name Remus rang a vague bell somewhere in the back of Hal’s head, but he got distracted from pursuing the thought as they all introduced themselves in turn. He could see in Lupin’s face that he indeed recognised the name Weasley, and Longbottom – and obviously Potter. There was something almost wistful in the way he looked at him, Neville and Ron.
“It wasn’t us.” Ley blurted out, and Hal kicked him under the table.
“Another witness for your case is already here.” She told them after she’d gone through most of the details. She saw Hal frown, and perhaps misinterpreted it. “But we can keep you separated if you do not wish to see him.” She added. “Severus Snape?”
“Oh piss off, Flint.”
“Of course he cares.” Draco said.
?” With the emphasis on the last word, he gave him another shove. “Are you going to go crying to your godfather like the cry-baby you are?”
This wasn’t news to the students, although historically, either blind eyes had been turned or nothing anyone had ever done after the last classes of the year had ever made a difference, and the cup was always awarded at the feast.
“I’m afraid so.” She confirmed. “This is all the way up in Scotland, we wouldn’t be able to commute there. But from what I understand, all students are staying there, the study of magic is quite… immersive. And the school is protected, so you are not meant to leave the grounds during term time.”
He shoved him again, and he and his mates left, trampling all over Draco’s stuff along the way. Draco closed his eyes for a few seconds, sighed, and went to pick it all up.
“My dad was spoilt?” Hal picked up, as usually latching on every nugget of knowledge about his parents.
It could have been his imagination, but he thought Snape’s lips almost twitched into a smile. Almost.
They didn’t know if there were sharp stones under the surface, that could have been dangerous, besides the coldness of the water – and Ley was coming out shivering and already slightly blue.
Petunia gave him an unamused look, but faced with their united front, she could only sigh again.
Hal spotted it first, near the Ravenclaw hoops, but Draco was closer. Hal was faster, just about – Draco’s broom was a more recent model, making up for Hal’s reckless skill when it came to reaching breakneck speeds – especially as they were headed for a rather busy zone of the pitch, just where the Quaffle was in play. They narrowed in on the little ball shoulder to shoulder, extended their arms at the same time, fingers just a few inches away…
The strictly timed plan Draco had devised and shared with all their friends was the only thing stopping Hal from falling into a panic spiral. He had had nightmares again that night, had woken up drenched in sweat, clawing at ropes around his neck that weren’t there. It helped, being able to look at the sheet of parchment, and to go through everything that would happen today in his head. 8 am, meet up in Diagon Alley, get waffles. That was a very good start, and he could focus on that for a bit, instead of “10 am, present to the Ministry”.
“Except you found that diary in a room full of dark texts and you have
“No, nothing, we win.” Ron said. “But I have to lose the knight.”
“Well, it did almost get stolen from Gringotts.” Hal pointed out. “And as far as we know, nobody got past that dog, have they?”
“Was she always like this?” He asked, because he couldn’t imagine Narcissa giving Draco hugs and kissing him good night, but he also couldn’t imagine growing up without all that.
Severus wanted to hit him, sometimes. Often. Maybe all the time.
, but Hal could tell the thrill of the adventure was starting to gain on all of them, as the rest of his friends – even Hermione – headed towards the door in the path Neville’s and Hal’s lights were clearing for them. Not that there was any other way than onwards.
“He’s a phoenix.” He said. “Look.”
“I will.” Hal lied.
He’d also felt stressed about trying out for the Quidditch team, which, combined with everything else, could have explained why he far from played his best. He still made the team, just avout, but a fifth year was given the main Seeker position, and Draco was appointed as reserve. He wasn’t happy about it, but he had to admit it was fair. He had to pull himself together.
He pulled the bookcase fully open, and cast a
“Yeah.” Ron answered first. “We’ll drop Hermione off, then it’s full house at the Weasleys. Well, minus Bill. But Charlie should be home from Romania.”
“Quite.” Nick smiled somewhat smugly. “Would you like to come to my party? I must say, a lot of us ghosts are rather intrigued by you, Harry Potter. I have some friends, in particular, who have succumbed to the Killing Curse, and would very much like to meet you. The esteemed members of the Headless Hunt are bound to be most impressed.”
When they went back to the pitch, the difference was so palpable Hal could feel it in the air. Maybe the Ravenclaw were feeling a bit too confidence with their advance, and their game got sloppier. Maybe the Gryffindor players figured Oliver might
“I could be sitting with the others at the library.” Anthony pretended to consider it. “But all Draco and Hermione can talk about is exams three months from now, all Ron and Hal can talk about is the Quidditch World Cup five months from now, and my amusement at watching Neville get stressed out equally by both events only goes so far.”
“She’s mine?” Draco breathed out, almost not daring to approach.
Somehow, Hermione glared at Hal like it was his fault.
“So I looked at the teachers’ stand, and several of them were talking so it was hard to tell if it was just conversation or cursing, but I am pretty sure I saw Professor Quirrell and Professor Snape looking straight at you.”
“I was going to.” Pan replied with an amused smile. “You’re the one who jumped right in.”
“Sly bastard.” He said of Nils. “If I see that guy…”
“Good night, Hal.”
Then everything went blurry, and they emerged onto the hidden platform for the Hogwarts Express – Hal realised they’d gone right through the barrier as they’d kept walking. He took a moment to gape at the gleaming red steam train.
“Pan!” Hal exclaimed as they jogged up to the pair. “You cut your hair!”
“Have to what? Go to the ball?” He frowned as Hal nodded. “Yes, I have to. I’m not a child anymore.”
“It could still be a prank.”
“Your parents really would have been proud of you, Harry.”
“Good.” Snape assessed. “And your housemates? Other than Mister Zabini.”
If you like to comment, I'd love to hear what you've thought of each chapter - suggestions welcome :)
“Err.” Hal said, unable to think of anything else to say.
The boy stilled, and he looked like he’d just been slapped.
“Probably waiting for this extremely awkward conversation to be over.” He said. “Dobby, you can come in.”
“Me too, fawn.” Sirius’ smile turned pained and sad, though only for a second. “They would have absolutely adored you, you’d have been spoilt rotten, probably even worst than James was.”
“It’s virtually impossible, yes.”
Hal looked down, sheepish. “It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.” He mumbled.
“I see you’re in good hands.” His aunt had a small chuckle.
“Mommy.”
“Mister Parkinson.”
“Yeah, I can read.” Ley raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “And?”
Hal hadn’t planned to tell his aunt about the potential curse, but his talk with Dumbledore had left him feeling confused and insecure – the man was just plain weird and cryptic, if you asked him – and in the end everything spilled out of him when he was on the phone to her.
(Yes you’ve noticed? Most of my titles are from song lyrics. This one is “Trustful Hands” by The Dø.)
“We’ll let you know.” One of them assured, before they started chanting the incantation.
Either way, he was glad the spell existed at all, because the game was epic. At one point however, almost unable to breathe from laughing, Hal had to leave his post for the loo. It had roughly been part of the tour – mentioned in passing, really – and he only got two doors wrong before he found it. He lingered on the way back, looking at the moving family photos on the wall, and he heard Ron shout from the bottom of the stairs.
Draco immediately wrote.
They’d had that conversation already. He was baffled that Hal’s people – as he’d taken to calling wizards – had
“It wasn’t a choice.” Draco muttered, annoyed at the reminder that yeah, kind of, he’d started out seeking Hal’s company as a strategic move. But that had very quickly changed!
He went to back bed more confused than ever, and did not get much more sleep.
“I- uh.” The first year didn’t seem to expect Hal would talk to him. “Harry Potter.”
Hal almost asked Ron to come with him to McGonagall, but he did not want to raise any suspicion in the rat – or man posing as rat, God, if that was true, it was just too weird to think about, especially looking at the creature curled up next to Ron’s read on his pillow – and dragging Ron out of bed before 8 am on a Sunday morning would definitely be a suspicious thing to do.
“Mate, no, it’s
“I can have a word, if-”
. He added.
“Library.” They said together.
Last one for the road.
Looking at the drawing, Ley saw a large group of people. He recognised himself, and Hal, and his mom, and his aunt Lily and a man who looked a lot like Hal whom he supposed was his dad.
around the room to keep the Devil’s Snare away, and he didn’t hide his relief when he spotted Draco with his own ray of light.
Dumbledore looked a little started, only for a split second, as if he hadn’t been expecting Hal to question him on that straight off the bat.
They were allowed to see him for a few minutes, though he was out of it, before they were kindly, but firmly told to go home, sleep, and come back in the morning. Hal tried to argue it was already morning, because it was getting on 1am by the time they were pushed out of the hospital, but that didn’t really work.
intelligent objects were usually to be approached with caution, and Draco did almost put down the quill, but… he had nobody to talk to about this. His mother wouldn’t understand.
“I thought you had a
“Does that mean we have to bring you guys stuff?” Neville asked suspiciously.
anything to defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But he had survived a curse that nobody else had ever survived. She couldn’t be the only one wondering if he had special powers, if his magic was somehow stronger, or different, to that of any other known wizard since maybe Merlin himself, who had been reputed to be immortal. Some rumours said he was still around. Some rumours said he was reincarnated in a certain Boy Who Lived.
“Oh, dear, I’m not sure that-”
, taking care of him, while Ley had been left with the neighbours, so if that was still the case of his birthdays on all days...
. His sense of danger, from a dull rumbling he’d always felt when Flint and his cronies approached him, was now screaming at him to never, ever find himself alone with him again.
“So how’s Potter going to travel?” She asked at one point.
“He grew up, I suppose. And his parents died when we were in our last year, that really changed him too. Not, like, he was a completely new person, but he did… mature. Understandably.”
“Sod off.” Hal laughed, shoving his cousin.
“Keep it safe, though.” George added. He mirrored his earlier movement of tapping the map with with wand, this time claiming proudly: “Mischief managed.”
*             *
“You don’t have to let it.” Draco said, though he immediately felt like the biggest hypocrite to ever have walked the earth. He’d let it happen to
“We aren't our parents, Draco.” He whispered, “I hold no grudge on you. You had no choice. Your father on the other hand…”
Draco just shrugged and propped himself up. The pain was subsiding now and his voice was getting stronger. “I’ve been through worse. All I ask is that you don’t get cocky over your ability to perform the Unforgivables well.”
“The stone wall. You.”
That’s when Harry noticed that Malfoy was there. He was also scowling at Blaise, who gave him a knowing look.
“I wanted to ask you something.”
Harry seemed to notice Draco walk in.
“Sir, I-”
“You lie! And lies deserve punishment. Since you think so highly of the boy, you’ll have no problem reliving your times with him.”
“Good.” Malfoy says and unwraps his arms from my waist. “That was to remind you that you're here. Not at your aunt and uncle's house. Not stuck in a cupboard. And not trapped in a corner by your cousin. But here. In a broom closet, hiding from Filch. With me.”
Narcissa opened her mouth, but Draco beat her to it, “She didn’t visit you in Azkaban because you were a horrible husband and father. And her name is Narcissa Black.”
But, Harry wasn’t going to let that get him down. He sat up groggily and reached for his glasses. When he put them on he saw a pile of presents at the foot of his bed. Ron was already ripping through his on the other side of the room.
But Harry, who never had anyone to really comfort him before, wanted someone to hold him. So he scooted closer to Draco, and leaned into him. Draco stiffened; Harry fucking Potter, The Git Who Lived Twice, was lying there with his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Whatever. My point is, you can hole yourself up forever.”
She nodded, “Yep.”
Shit.
The blonde glared at him, “Shut up.” He took out his wand and tapped the guitar. It grew to normal size, so he started strumming.
Harry looked uneasy at that thought, “Is there anyway to be certain without testing it?”
Draco’s face lit up, “Of course!” He said excitedly, “Father would always tell me to never open this box in the root cellar! It seemed about the size of a book!”
“I don’t know…” Even to himself Draco sounded defeated. “I know that Ginerva er… Ginny is probably right. I might like Potter more than a little bit more than I originally intended to. I have no idea why I’m telling you all of this. I mean, I’ve known for a while that I’m probably gay. Due to my lack of attraction to girls and attraction to every guy's backside. I’m sorry you probably don’t want to listen to my rambling.”
Percy raised his glass, “A toast, to Winter!”
I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks.”
“I’m going to tell you all I know about where we were, but first we need food. Did you eat at all yesterday?”
“Hermione no! He’s not worth it!”
“Well, I like to come here a lot. Especially to think. This tree, it was grown for Cedric.” Harry hesitated, “Even after all of the death in the battle, Cedric’s is still the one I feel most guilty about.”
“Just try.”
I’m so caught up in my thoughts I don’t notice a familiar blonde haired boy sitting by the edge of the Forbidden Forest. I step on a twig and his head snaps up. After looking around he says softly, “I know that’s you Potter. Show yourself.”
Malfoy looked surprised, “Oh. Sorry.”
Of course. He only cares about himself. Figures.
My heartbeat quickens. And my inhales become ragged. Sweat beads my brow.
Harry smiled, “It’s alright, we’ll survive. ‘Cause parents aren't always right.”
As if on cue, I step into the room.
They sat in silence for quite a while. Until Draco broke it, “Thank you, Potter.”
“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY! WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING! YOU COULD HAVE DIED! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO YOURSELF! ARE YOU EVEN CAPABLE OF THINKING! YOU COULD HAVE KILLED YOURSELF, IF THAT WASN’T YOUR AIM ALREADY! YOU BEST HOPE I DON’T KILL YOU MYSELF THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU! I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HARRY WAN’T THERE! IF YOU HADN’T FORGOT YOUR FILES AT WORK YOU WOULD BE DEAD! Oh and thank you Harry dear. I will be forever grateful. You’re welcome to come and visit any time as well as young Miss. Granger. DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY WATCH YOUR BACK!”
“And then, three weeks before Hogwarts was about to start, they held our trials. Which you came to. You made a change you know, they let me go, but on the condition that I returned to Hogwarts. They put my mother on house arrest… but my father. Well you were there, so I’m sure you know what happened.
Malfoy put his lips to Harry’s ear and growled, “Don’t ever, /ever/ talk about my parents like that!”
Draco smirked, “What? Never seen a Weasley apologize before?”
“Okay.”
“Harry, I know it hurts, I know there’s nothing I can do to take away the pain, and I know that you don’t want any pity. Harry please look at me.”
“My daddy put a gun to my head, he said ‘if you kiss a boy I'm gonna shoot you dead.’”
Draco inwardly groaned, he was hoping to do this assignment alone. He had tried to avoid talking to anyone at all since the war.
“Cat got your tongue?” Lucius asked in mock concern. Blood was rushing to Draco’s head and he was remembering all sorts of terrible things he had barred from his brain for so long.
“Before you ask, yes, I am bisexual.”
“Oh sod off!”
“So, you and Harry aye?”
The sixth years turned back to him, when they saw who he was they sneered.
“You know Draco,” she said smiling, “It was an arranged marriage. By your father. But he’s in Azkaban now right? So I would be okay if you decided not to get married.”
“Hey mate. What’s up?”
“Not so good.” Harry replied.
Harry hesitated, “I’m sure Mc-”
He went to bed that night happier than he had been in a while.
“How?”
Then a smirk slowly crossed his face as he said, “I think I can choose the wrong sort for myself thanks.”
Then he spotted blonde hair.
“I mean, we’re still friends. Right?”
Draco gave a dry laugh, “Mainly yes. But in some cases the people actually like each other.”
Ron smirked too, “All right. But you two better be together by the time we get back, cause I’m not doing this for nothing.”
Before Draco knew what was going on Harry had grabbed his arm and they were Apperating to Hogsmead.
I look at him guiltily, “Ummm. No. Sorry.” I climb back up and sit beside him.
“Bastard.” Harry mumbled into the cotton of Draco’s shirt. He breathed in his scent, it was comforting.
Draco smirked, “I would rather you had nothing on, but alas.”
Malfoy runs a hand through his rainbow hair and my eyes follow the movement. “Why would Hermione think that *you* could help *me*?”
Harry’s face fell, “You know what this means right? On the next full moon, your mum will be in danger. Even if we are right, the full moon is tomorrow night! How are we going to prepare? We don’t know how they're going to get in. Or if they have any secret entrance that we don’t know about.”
The Unspeakable named Rin Cloherback looked nervous talking to him, “Mr. Border wants to see you in his office.”
Draco dressed and hurried downstairs to where his mother was waiting.
“Alright, enough of this,” he said, “Did you grab the Time-Turner?”
Draco rolled his eyes, “At least we know where they're being used.”
I let out a sigh. Things were going to change, and not necessarily in a good way. I round the corner not going anywhere in particular, and bump into something, or someone.
Harry felt his fist tighten.
One morning Draco went to Potter’s office to examine the only unbroken Time-Turner still at the Ministry. When he got there Weasley was pacing around the room.
“Thanks.” He mumbled. Taking the towel from her, he walked over to the bathroom, “Tell him I’ll be there in a couple minutes.” He said over his shoulder. Coco gave a nod and left the room.
“Did you just call me Ronald? I thought I was Weasle.”
Voldemort pulled out of his memories.
‘I also thought that I might actually like you. More than a friend.’ he added to himself.
Draco worked as an Unspeakable for the Ministry of Magic. It had been hard to find a job. Even three years after the Second Wizarding War, being a former Death Eater was considered to be worthy of hate crimes. Draco had dealt with it by keeping himself up in his room, and cutting off contacts to the rest of the world. Not even talking to Pansy and Blaise. Or even Greg.
My heart stops beating. I open my mouth to ask what he ment. But oh! He’s kissing me.
Malfoy puts his hands up. “Hold on. I can explain.”
Slughorn waved his hand and Hermione dragged Harry out of the room.
It was a while before either of them spoke, but Harry broke the silence.
Harry was getting angry, “I don’t care! I don’t want to get in the way of a marriage!”
Draco finished his story, and Harry stared at him and said three words.
Harry watched the snake slither off of the bed and out the open window. Probably falling to its death.
And maybe it did.
Malfoy smirked, “Long enough to know that those sixth years are not coming back soon.”
Potter was still staring after him, a look of pure shock written all over his face.
As Harry was climbing the stairs, he thought about what Hermione had said. ‘“Is it Malfoy.” Of course it isn’t Malfoy!’
Ron groaned, “Please tell me it’s not that Michael Corner guy.”
“Mate.” He said, voice hoarse. “That’s Malfoy.”
“Wh-what?” Harry spluttered, turning red, “N-no, I was just wondering-”
Harry looked shocked. “Draco I-”
Suddenly the trap door slammed shut behind him. He whipped around.
“You seem to think that it was all your fault that all those people died. It is /not/. Remember people weren’t fighting just for you. They were also fighting for themselves and their family's and the whole of the wizarding world.”
“She would beg him not to join the Dark Lord. But he wouldn’t listen. Mother still has scars. Mental and physical. She did nothing to deserve it. But father was just out of control.”
“You-”
“And how did I never know this!?”
Harry spotted Zonko’s out of the corner of his eye and got an idea. “C’mon.” He said, grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging him across the street.
They took the tins from Draco and ran on ahead.
Harry knew he was talking about Malfoy, and he wondered how the young professor knew.
“What?”
When Draco reached Potter’s office he heard voices.
“So. Why *did* your patronus change?” Draco asked when they broke apart. He was straddling Harry so he moved to sit on the other side of the bed. Which wasn’t very far.
With that he turns around and steps out of the half-lit cupboard. Leaving me uncharacteristically breathless.
Draco brushed a hand through Harry’s raven locks. “They discharged me a few weeks ago, but I wanted it to be a surprise.”
Out of all of the good-byes to say, this one would be the hardest. “Are you alright?” Draco says tilting my head up. Green eyes meet gray ones. I don’t say anything. That’s all he needs. He steps back and shakes his head vigorously.
“I’m bisexual.”
“Hey Harry.”
“Oh fuck Harry,” he murmured pressing closer, “I really want this, I do. But I can’t. I’m getting married in two weeks. I’m so sorry.”
“Then there should be no need to apologize to him. Besides, I know I’m the one who’s all about house unity, but my opinions differ when it comes to Malfoy. He’s done some pretty despicable shit.”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, confused, but followed Neville out of the common room anyway. Neville led him down the corridor and into the library.
The blonde glared at Harry as the Dragon swooped from the room. Harry just grinned and said, “I’m sure he’ll get a kick out of that!”
Draco groaned. “Please save our sanity Potter, and don’t say it.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “But how do you know you don’t like girls as well?” He asked.
“Well it was when I was five. I heard my father talking about it at work. So I asked one of my father’s coworkers about it and he said that I had to get a part of the animal that I wanted to turn into. Of course at that point I didn’t know that each person had their own animagus form, so I ran around the Manor that night trying to catch a peacock. My father found me trapped in a hedge the next morning.”
‘Weird.’ He thought.
He was about to give up hope that he was going to survive. But he got news that all of the Death Eaters were being put on trial. Most of them were sent to Azkaban for life or received the Kiss. Lucius Malfoy was sentenced to a life in Azkaban. The only reason Draco didn’t receive the same fate was because of Harry bloody Potter.
“You’ve lost your touch Malfoy.” Harry taunted as Draco pulled up beside him.
There's also something I want to let you guys know: I will not be posting next week due to a camping trip with my family. It is close to my mother's birthday, so we decided to take a trip up north. I'm really sorry, but I will be back after that.
“Malfoy, I’m bisexual!”
Looking back on it all, Harry realized how broken he was as a child. And maybe some of that never went away. Maybe he was still a bit broken inside.
“Filch thing I killed his cat.” He said quietly, and he could hear how small his voice sounded.
“Stay here while I fetch Minerva.” Snape told them tiredly at the end of his lecture. “She will decide of the adequate punishment for you, Mister Potter. Draco.” He added more softly. “If you don’t mind staying behind, I’d like to talk to you.”
Ley wasn’t at all a wimp about pain. He picked himself up and barrelled on, and it took a lot for him to even admit he was in pain. He’d once walked miles on a broken ankle, when Hal and him had been exploring and he’d landed badly when climbing down (falling off) a tree. So when, hours after he’d first complained and a little while after claiming he felt better for a bit, he started crying in pain, Petunia knew it wasn’t just indigestion and she called an ambulance.
“Lucius Malfoy is dead.” Hal spat.
Hal was about to answer, but he noticed the look on Hermione’s face, like she was holding her tongue so hard it was causing her physical pain.
Draco could feel himself blush. Whatever power the notebook was imbued with, it had intelligence – enough to see right through him in only a few words. He suspected the previous owner was tied to it by an enchantment akin to the one used on paintings, retaining some of the memories and personality of the past life of whoever was portrayed.
Neville smiled at Hermione, who had an embarrassed little frown, but looked ready to argue.
A hiss answered him. “He’s lying.”
“I was just on my way up, Severus isn’t in his office, what is the…”
I heard it.”
“What?” Draco startled, turning back to him.
“See you in a bit.” Draco wiggled his fingers at him.
“Lost in thought? Did it go wrong with Professor Snape?”
“What?” Neville prompted, looking worried.
Hal opened his mouth, presumably to attempt an answer, but he was interrupted by a high-pitched scream of “MOMMY!” that had all of them turn around in alarm. Nobody seemed to be injured or drowning, but a little girl of about eight looked like she was going to faint, staring with wide eyes and an open mouth in their direction.
“Are you okay, Harry?” He then asked him.
“They think he might be after you.” Draco blurted out before Ley could stop him.
The buzz of excitement resumed as they docked and started making their way to the castle. It wasn’t a very long walk, and soon enough they were in front of the doors of the Great Hall being lectured by the Deputy Headmistress – she was explaining, really, but her resting face made everything she said sound like she was telling you off. Draco tuned out slightly, and as they were led into the Hall, he started people-watching.
“Wow!” The man caught his arm before he collapsed. “Easy there. Here, gently, sit down.”
“Parseltongue.” Draco realised as well.
“You’re really good.” He commented before he looked at the rest.
“Oh god.” Hal breathed. “Uh, I don’t know. I suppose some might be and some might not, I didn’t really have a long conversation with any of them.”
had not reported on that, surely due to Ministry pressures, but Draco knew very well that was the case – he’d overheard as much from several politicians at one of his mother’s “social” gatherings, earlier in the summer.
“Of course.” The man inclined his head, unbothered. “But you said you hit your head, didn’t you?”
“Good morning, Professor.” Hal greeted her. “I had something to tell you, if you’re not too busy? It’s quite serious.”
“Draco, what-”
A little alarm bell went in Draco’s mind, because he suddenly remembered Sirius Black didn’t just have ties to his family, he had them with Hal’s too, and not in a good way. But if he could steer the conversation away from that, he’d be fine, and they never had to mention him again.
Blaise: Muggle Studies (or as he calls it, Politics) + Ancient Runes
In a lull in the conversation, Anthony made a decision.
“Oh yeah, there’s that.” Hermione made a grimace of disgust.
He opened the box, and revealed a stack of photographs, most of them moving, showing various groupings of the same four teenagers. Sirius himself, Lupin, James and Lily. Sirius muttered something about removing the ones with Peter.
“Ron.” Hal snorted. “There’s nine of you. That’s a whole lot of birthdays.”
Hal crept as quietly as he could back up the stairs, then made sure to make as much noise as possible coming back down, like he’d not been hovering there eavesdropping for the past few minutes.
