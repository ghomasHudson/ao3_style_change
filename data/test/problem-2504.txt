“Yes, fine.” Draco smiled and grabbed his lover’s hand gently. “Are you?”
Anyway, Harry hadn’t returned to the tower before four o’clock. By then he wasn’t really that tired and it took forever to fall asleep.
Lighting up as a sun, the smaller boy kissed him back.
Snorting, Draco refused to show them how much this in fact, worried him.
Handing him the jar, Harry grabbed it with a scrunched up face.
“Seriously, sir.” Harry looked him straight in the eyes. “I have no idea.”
Walking into Hogsmeade, the gang sat out for the first shop in the main street but looking through the window they saw a huge amount of students almost climbing on the walls to search for the right dress.
“No, Albus, I don’t indulge in sweet things, besides the occasional rich dark chocolate from HoneyDukes.”
For a whole minute, Harry thought Jason was going to leave him right there, but thankfully his natural even temper stopped him and in the end, he gave in.
“Yes, or at least I imagine Jason have told him, since he does not seem surprised or disgusted by a close relation between a student and a professor.” Both men shuddered internally at the aspect of dating a student.
them. They seemed to move in sync. When one moved his hand away, the other moved closer.
The door opened and even before being invited, he hurried inside, happy to be out of the cold rain. He used his hands to dry away the lingering drops on his face and quickly cleaned his glasses. Behind him the door was getting closed and the heat from inside started warming him up. Once his eyes were free from raindrops, he noticed that Hagrid looked like his beard had caught fire. Once side was slightly shorter and the few parts left were somewhat dark even if Hagrid’s hair was already black.
friend, Mr. Weasley had taken the news of you and Mr. Malfoy rather at heart.”
“You still don’t have to call me sir, Dobby.” Harry tried getting up. “How are you?”
“Malfoy, are you still trying to win?”
“So,” Harry took a sip of his tea. “What should we do now?”
“Wha-ehm.” Harry shook his head trying to clear his mind. This was surrealistic. “My summer. Fine. Just fine, I guess.”
Harry found himself missing the dragon in an odd fashion. He imagined this was how dog-people felt when they had been on vacation without their pets. He just constantly wished to see Aodhan. Watch him fly, play and eat. He loved every small detail of his scaly face and eyes. The way he pushed against Harry’s hand to get petted or a treat. Harry had saved a few of Hedwig’s owl protein stones in his pocket. He would count that as a present since it would be impossible to buy anything dragon related in Hogsmeade without raising suspicion.
“Potter, if I may.” Professor McGonagall was standing behind him, looking almost sympathetic. Knowing what could be the only thing sending him any kind of sympathy from the strict professor, Harry simply asked; “Already?” The stiff nod was the confirmation he got.
Draco quickly pulled his wand out and pointed it at Harry opening. Slicking it with a spell made Harry hiss.
“Suck it.” Harry sneered and he hurried to leave while the gasps of the shocked girls followed him.
“So how was the date?”
Seeing as Draco still wasn’t done dancing, the shorter boy left to find his other friends. He had barely walked a few feet before a rather loud squeaky voice called him out.
“Hey, don’t worry, it does kind of look like…”
“Seamus, no, if we are doing this then you have to promise not to get competitive.” Dean did not seem very frilled with the idea of letting his boyfriend off with the Slytherins. He turned to talk to Harry.
“We have to go now, McGonagall told us to be there exactly at ten.” Hermione got up.
“Well you better get going.” One of the Slytherins replied coldly.
“Maybe I’m not the only one who should consider what they actually want.” Malfoy teased and smiled down at him.
Draco had no idea how long they stood like that. Simply embracing each other as if saying goodbye. Pansy’s tears had soaked through his shirt, and even though the feeling was quite unpleasant, he stayed still. Soon, the quiet sniffling stopped and the girl pulled away from him. Even though she was slightly red nosed, she composed herself quickly. Without another word spoken between them, she turned around and left.
God, what was he going to do? It was way too late to send a present to Potter by now. Even if he had anything to send, it would take an owl all day and Potter would KNOW he hadn’t remembered buying him something.
As Harry had slowly stopped crying, the Professor had patted him on the back, telling him to go outside and wait for the class to begin as he prepared for their arrival. Although before leaving, Snape had told him to come back every time his thoughts became unbearable. Harry had tried his best to keep the shock of his face. Simply the idea of Snape offering him a safe place, was almost laughable. Of course, he didn’t, but settled for a nod and quietly closed the door behind him.
“Alone.” The stretched tone actually made him wonder. Sighing in great exhaustion, he got up and followed the strutting woman outside. The January air was cold and exiting the entrance, Draco did his best not to show his discomfort. Casually, he folded his arms, staring at her in expectance.
No. Please don’t.
“Actually… I don’t think I have much to do before lunch…” Harry teasingly pulled at his tie, showing them towards the entrance and what Draco soon realized was the nearest broom closet.
“He could have hit you! What if the spell had burned you or you didn’t let go of the toy?”
So coming back to last night; Harry had gone to bed early, or that was at least what he had told the others. In reality, he had simply grabbed his invisibility cloak and the map he had inherited from his father and his friends. He snuck out of the Gryffindor tower, and went to the Room of Requirement where he was meeting Draco. He had arrived a little late, since he almost fell over Madam Norris whom had probably smelled him and practically chased him for two floors. The second he entered the magical room, he had ripped off his cloak and been thrown against the door. Draco’s lips had found his inhumanly fast, gathering him in his arms and pushed him upwards. He had tangled his finger in the blonde locks and panted as Draco had pushed their erection against the denim pants. When Harry felt like they were heading for point of no return, he stopped Draco. He could see the disappointment and frustration in the icy grey eyes, but it meant the world to him that Draco stopped when he asked him too. He wasn’t sure why he didn’t feel ready yet. He had imagined having sex with Draco, basically every night before sleep and sometimes in the shower before breakfast. But when they were making out and Draco started reaching under his shirt, it was as if a silent alarm set off and tore the pleasant moment apart.
Continuing down the hall, Harry could see the outline of the Fat Lady’s picture.
“Damn.” Harry cursed. He rarely did but this was surely a proper moment to do so. He couldn’t believe Snape was a father. Not truly. He was more of a sour uncle-type or maybe even a stepfather, but the idea of him having any sort of romantic relation gave Harry goosebumps and not in a good way.  He had been a great help most of his life, he knew that now, but the sarcastic and snarky smirks and mean comments hadn’t mellowed him out over time.
“No.” Snape affirmed. “-And I don’t believe he meant for you to find out before much later, after the war. You had enough on your own mind, without having to discuss your godfather’s sexlife.” It was almost comically how they both shuddered at the thought.
Back in his own quarters, Severus still felt miserable and tired. He had poured himself a double scotch into a crystal glass and was slowly sipping the horrible drink. Normally he loved a good scotch but since he had been on a teacher’s salary and Lucius and him were barely speaking anymore, he hadn’t really been drinking from the good life for long.
Ron had apparently had the same idea as he, and obviously hadn’t expected him to continue the conversation.
“Mr. Malfoy, I see you got Madam Pomphrey’s letter. Good, now before you-“
“Wow.” Harry couldn’t help but stare all around them. It seemed as though the great hall had become ten times bigger. The floor had taken a cold colored marble pattern in grey and white, while each and every wall was covered in mirrors. Making the already dancing couples appear thrice around. The windows had remained but Harry quickly looked up on the enchanted ceiling where there too, was a giant mirror. Harry could see him and Draco appear right on top in tiny dots of black and blond. Just as back in fourth year, a giant icecastle had been placed where the teachers table usually was, let out different kinds of drinks and in all variations and colors. Larger round tables were placed on the sides in the front and back, where up to twelve students could sit together. The tablecloth seemed as though it was made of pure snow, as the sides of it let tiny snowflakes fall to the floor as people touched them. In the middle of each table were an ice sculpture carved into a magical creature.
“Like it?” Draco chuckled as Harry blushed. “Hmm, guess we should explore
The boys decided to each find a few possible themes for their paper before actually discussion them.
As Snape gathered himself, he announced that he would be back later that evening.
“Yeah…I’m sure that is fine.” Melck said befuddled, clearly not used to – what some people assumed – was Pansy’s nicer side. His smile quickly returned though and he turned to lead the way. Draco persistently tried to stun the girl by staring at the back of her head but unfortunately, nothing stayed still except the strands of her ironed flat short hair.
Harry loved the fact about Neville that you didn’t always have to talk or explain everything. He simply accepted that Harry wanted a little quiet and he would just enjoy the silence as well.
Harry wasn’t sure who was most surprised by the outcome, him or the two Ravenclaws.
Severus gave the smallest sign of gratefulness for his friend, but Malfoy chose to ignore him. He was obviously still bothered that Severus the halfblood, had gotten a letter and he the pureblood, hadn’t. The black haired man hurried to hide the message inside his robe and didn’t bring it out before he was certain he was alone in their room. Opening the letter was easy, nor spell or curses had been placed but as he opened it, he was suddenly filled with an uneasy and dreadful emotion. It felt unnatural and Severus imagined it to a strong repellent charm with a touch of dark magic.
Collecting himself, Mr. Malfoy hurried; “Draco, tell me immediately what happened so we can get a prosecution started.”
Harry didn’t know where to start. He knew his parents were a sensitive topic to the professor, but he was the only person beside Remus who had known his parents well, or at least his mother.
“Jason-“
“You just seem a little too interested in Potter these days. Are you perhaps… falling for him?” Theodore teased him. Rather unusual for the quiet boy to make any form of mockery, but none the less, Draco certainly wouldn’t let him off the hook by the indication.
Swallowing hardly, Harry grabbed the offered sweater to distract himself.
“Oh come on! Draco,” Pansy snorted. “He is still the same-“
Laughing Harry nodded before finding his friends sitting near the middle of the great hall. Hermione who’s face was stuck in a book, looked up at the sound of his laughter. Looking to the side of his head, Harry was sure she had seen Jason walk away from them.
matter how they got together, right? Harry adored him.
This time he was the one to catch Lupin off guard. “Harry knows?”
With that, he left the table and refused to look back at the shocked faces. He could practically feel the heating glare from the stuck up girl.
“Oh!” Harry suddenly realized, gathering the strong scaly head in his hands. “You did it! You can breathe fire now!”
Expelled? God, no. Snape couldn’t actually be serious about expelling his own son, could he?
Remus moved forward to ask him another question;
As annoyed as he was, that Snape immediately thought he was the one to have stolen from him, Harry’s surprise at the information went beyond.
“Okay! I get it.” Harry blushed. Well, it was at least better than to stay up all night worrying about tomorrow. A nice warm shower and a bit of wanking my actually do him some good.
“I think I will, Harry.”
“Hello, I hope you’re still opened…”
The girl wouldn’t look at him as she wringed her hands.
“He kissed you!?” He coughed.
Coughing slightly Blaise tried again. “Erhm, I don’t know if you heard but Potter and Draco have been having a fight I guess-“
“Sure.” He reached out and Harry slowly handed him the package. The students around them had almost all boarded and whistle blew for the first time. Saying goodbye, the dark haired boy got on the train.
“It’s fine.” Draco snorted. “You’re here. Let’s go.”
Both walked in deep silence, each contemplated their conversation just now. As they arrived, the Fat lady was leaning on her hand snoring quietly into it.
“For leaving?”
“Harry!” a lunately hand waved above the heads of a few Ravenclaws. Walking around the group, Harry saw Colin Creevy stand amongst some of his friends. Thankfully, the young man hadn’t brought his camera with him. Waving back, Harry figured he’d better go and say hello.
“You know, it’s such a beautiful day, we should do something.”
“I’m sorry-“ He could barely breath out an apology.
Laughing, Harry quickly started kissing his lover again.
right now. Neither seemed to be relaxing being so close to each other. Harry certainly wasn’t. Angry Malfoy he could handle. Prissy Malfoy was the usual. Hell, even arrogantly happy Malfoy, he was used to, but this made him incredibly uneasy.
“Hagrid called your name, you have to step forward.” He whispered.
The trip to the front entrance was uneventful and he met Draco at the foot of the staircase.
“To a lovely evening.”
He rushed up the stairs two steps at a time. At one point, he had to stop to take a break. His heart was jamming against his chest as he tried to take deep breaths. Looking further ahead in the corridor he had stopped he saw three of his professors’ walking on the same way he was heading. Albus Dumbledore in front with his rather sprawled purple coloured robes, Professor Sprout and Snape right behind him. Forcing himself to continue running to catch up with them, Harry stopped a little behind them.
Harry straightened his tie and sat back. Something was still missing… oh right!
“No, it was definitely a big change.”
The End
“Right.”
“Why do you care?” Cetus smirked evilly. “Jealous Snivy got one and you didn’t?”
happy, for the first time. Can you please just try to be happy for me? Please?”
Even though he had known, hearing Malfoy actually say it out loud, hurt worse than Harry could have imagined.
But it was soon time to study for the newts and the OWLs, and the student body had enough on their plate. The whispers and the gossip were exchanged for studying and minor breakdowns, every other day. Harry could honestly not wait for the exams. He wished to gather whatever grades he could manage and hopefully get accepted into a healer internship at Skt. Mungos.
The shook his head so his big ears flapped against his forehead.
“Okay, we should let you get some sleep.” Hermione got up. Taking Ron by the hand, the two Gryffindors left the hospital wing. As Harry’s eyes followed their movement, he realized another person was lying in a bed further down the wing. He recognized the long brown hair and suddenly he remembered. The unicorn hadn’t only attacked him. She had actually been heading for Jason. Now seeing him again, Harry saw how badly she had injured him. Bandages were wrapped around his head multiple times and his left arm had scratches that were covered in a green paste. Beside him, very closely, Zabini was sitting silently. He was carefully stroking Jason’s other shoulder and arm. The olive-skinned boy looked rather tired and had a constant worrying look on his face.
Letting go, Malfoy took a backward step and whispered goodnight.
“I believe it went as ‘none of your business.’” Draco sneered. Again, the irritating boy just smirked.
“What?” usually, Severus wouldn’t dignify with such a foolish answer but he was most surprised by the chance of subject. Figuring the boy would be angry with him for snooping, he hadn’t expected such a dejected tone. Looking him straight in the eyes, blue and brown clashing black, Jason elaborated.
“Hey Ronda,” Ron yelled over the spectacle. “Have you seen my brothers?”
Draco couldn’t believe how well the plan had worked. Potter fell right into his trap and seemed ‘oh so grateful’ to him for saving the little trio. God, once again; how Gryffindors survived being so gullible, Draco had no clue.
“I bring Potter dinner, sir!” a bedtray was placed upon him.
Shocked, Harry felt his jaw actually dropping, slightly. Did Malfoy just ask him to do something together? Outside of school? This day could certainly not get any weirder. Harry had no idea how to respond. What reason could Malfoy possibly have to ask him?
The grey clouds on the ceiling left little to the imagination of the weather outside. Harry hated the fall. It only got colder from now on and it always rained. It left you with a longing for the winter snow, which would first come in months and a dreaded sense of saying goodbye to warm sunny days and late light evenings. As Harry continued to play with his porridge, he spectated over the last few days. Malfoy and he had spent last night outside, getting to know each other. It actually hadn’t been as awkward as he had imagined.
Fearing Draco was about to give him a hissyfit, Harry tried to come up with an explanation. Unfortunately, before he even had had the smallest of ideas as to why he was attacked, Draco had already figured it out.
“Oh.” His heart was starting to pond. Imagining Draco’s idea of them together. It would hardly be only for Draco’s enjoyment to feel him licking his body. All the way, up from his lips to all the way down…
“-We’ll figure it out when we come to that.” Jason got out of the bed and left for his own. “After we are bound I’m sure I’ll find out what I want to do with my life. Probably travel for a while. I always wanted to see North America.”
But each day – just by those ten minutes he spent in there – he learned so much about the chattering brunette. He was born here in Australia, his parents and him were very close, he loved baking, but hated cooking. Dog-person, loved some comedians Severus didn’t know and his favorite color was green.
“-Is not a present!” Snape interrupted angrily. Harry feared for a second that Jason had overstepped his boundaries. Remus and he remained silent as the two very different Snapes’ discussed. A staring content began as the two tried to stare each other down. To Harry’s great surprise, Professor Snape was the one to back down, as he swiftly rose and exited the room, muttering something alike;
Harry was shoveling food down as if he impersonated Ron. He had almost choked twice already. Eating his toast two bites at a time, he discreetly looked towards the head table, trying to see if Hagrid was still there. The robust hairy man had almost finished, and Harry wanted to make sure he ran into him on the way out. It had only been a few days, but Harry dearly missed Aodhan. He had never in his life felt like this before regarding an animal. Whilst his love for Hedwig was for a dear pet, his first and only, the bond with Aodhan was more. Almost for a family member, a… maternal instinct.
“Probably also thirteen if you want to exaggerate the meaning of inventing future charm spells.” Knott interfered.
“Excellent. Now Harry if you will step aside, please.” Harry still weary, looked at his elder friend and say no sign of malice or ill intention. Slowly he stepped to the left, leaving Aodhan exposed. The dragon tried to follow his co-caretaker but Dumbledore silently waved his wand and the dragon tipped over and fell into deep slumber. Placing a vanishing charm around the animal the white bearded man hid his wand back in the pocket.  Beside them, the giant tried his best to keep from crying at the sight of his fallen companion.
“No, Ron, please don’t!” Harry screamed in his own mind, as the red storm of Ron darted towards it.
As it was still early during the schoolyear, most of their dueling lessons had consisted of smaller hexes and counter curses. Today was no different.
“Oh!” Amber let out a dazzled gasp. Looking behind her, Harry noticed Hermione had come down. The girl blushingly, received the many compliments as the Gryffindors observed her. Her brown eyes seemed to sparkle as Harry stepped aside to let Ron see her.
“I really missed you.” Harry felt himself blush at the statement but it truly felt right to say aloud. The man simply hugged him tighter for another second before releasing him.
His father’s anger had settled, but he continued pacing back and forth, as the wheels in his head turned. His mother’s hand had never stopped stroking his, but he could feel the sudden tension in her as their discussion had included her. His father was at the point where he felt he had listened to more than enough reasons. Now, he was making a final decision. Even though his mother had seemed on his side, his father was the head of their house and would ultimately make the call. Stopping to stare out the window, his father finally spoke again.
“Fine. Mother brought her new husband with us this time. She seems different with this one. Almost giddy.” He scrunched up.
Severus had never been good with emotions. After he left Australia, he had also left his heart behind. A few months after, he had sealed his own fate as well as the rest of Britain when he delivered the prophesy to the dark lord and failed to protect his only friend and her son. As he had failed to take care of his own family. A very conflicted emotion settled over him at that second. The pain of losing an imaginative lifetime with his own family as well as the love of his life, crashed over him like a tidal wave. But one thing remained locked in his brain; He now had a new opportunity to have a son. His son.
Remus was probably already heading for the school gates and Harry quickly ran towards the entrance. His lungs burned from the frosty wind blowing through his body; heart beating and legs starting to hurt, he at last saw the small sight of a man heading west.
Getting up and getting dressed, Harry hurried after his friends who were already heading for breakfast. Running down the stairs, he had barely managed to tighten his tie before catching up. Running a hand through the raven colored nest on his head, he tried to untangle a few locks. Getting to the hall the group of Gryffindors was interrupted by a rather loud yell from behind.
“Hello, I don’t think we have been in company before.” Luna smiled at Jason.
Hermione loved her boyfriend, so much was obvious, but at breakfast, it seemed she was determined to stare at her own plate through most of it.
“Do not be absurd. I have no use for anything there; I am simple going alongside you until the tower as I am heading for the infirmary. Madam Pomfrey says a larger amount of snailburn healing potions are missing and when the spring comes, she will want to be fully stocked.”
“I guess, maybe… but what do
“-So I’m sure it’s no problem if I go with you guys.”
Draco took him by the hand and practically dragged him to a little corridor a few hallways from the great hall. As the loud voice of hundreds of student became a distant murmur, Harry wondered what Draco wanted. A tiny ray of hope wished that Draco was going to ask him to the dance. Harry was perfectly aware of how pathetic it was, having to wait for Draco to ask him instead of just asking himself, but he was terrified of Draco saying no. Finally, the blond teen stopped them and immediately dropped Harry’s hand. After standing in complete silence for a while, Harry asked what he wanted to talk about.
Thanking, Harry blew his stuffed nose with a
“Five more minutes.” Snape announced.
The teen in front of him froze before turning in his direction. As their eyes caught, the bronze boy smiled at him.  “Ready for lunch?” The tan boy smiled.
“Anytime.” Jason shrugged sadly. “In theory. In reality? It’s a lot to ask a person to become your soulbound. For most folks, a schoolcrush isn’t exactly a person nor the time to settle down and become married.”
“Do Dragonflies like to be indoors?” Having gotten to know the slightly delusional girl, Harry had understood; if you wanted to know something, you had to ask in a just-as-mysterious question.
Left behind stood his godfather, sighing at the troublesome man who with no doubt had left him to deal with an enraged Lucius. A warm hand gently touched his palm as if it was uncertain Severus would allow it to linger.
Jason didn’t really look surprised. “I see. Well that’s nice, he did seem rather fixated on you, so I suppose it makes sense.”
DM POV
The three boys known as Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan and Neville Longbottom all came through and launched themselves in the red seats.
“Well, most wolves usually bite their mate. It is a special bite, that usually occurs when they are in love or at least have found a respectable mate to carry their cubs. I never believed I would need to worry about such animalistic behavior when I was in Hogwarts. I was never around humans when I was a wolf and had no intentions of finding a ‘mate’ in any way.”
Oh right, the plan. Harry cleared his mind, trying to remember what he was supposed to say.
“Ah Harry, I see you brought young Mr. Malfoy along.” Dumbledore acknowledged their presence. “Come now,” he waved Harry closer to him and led him towards the dragon and Hagrid. Draco stayed behind and stood next to Professor Snape.
So what do you think? Jason finally had enough!
Kiss on the forehead.
“This!” He grabbed an old newspaper showing Draco the front page where he smiled along with his family and friends. “Bachelor Malfoy to be wed!” he threw the paper and hit Draco in the chest. “You had perfectly moved on while I was still in the darkness! Do you have any idea how I might have felt seeing your flashy perfect life in the paper?!” he sobbed angrily.
Potter whom had been standing behind him, seemed to silently agree and headed after the potion master in quick march.
Ups. Right. His friends where still right beside him.
“Oh. Well, that was probably just wishful thinking.” Harry tried to swallow the lump gathering in his throat. “Besides, they were kids, that can’t really be taken seriously, right?”
“Oh still too hot.” The man chuckled and put it down on the table. “While I do like the taste of these cookies, I-“
“Erm, yeah just the burrow as usual.” Ron shrugged. “But Charlie is coming home, so that’s something.”
Gently he kissed the shorter boy on the cheek.
HP POV
“Harry, pull the rest off.” Draco tried to sound demanding, but Harry couldn’t keep from smiling at the whiny tone. Seeing Draco lying like that, waiting for him, filled his confidence and he quickly pulled off the rest of his shoes, pants and socks. The only piece missing was the silken boxer covering the most interesting part of him. Harry lied back down and he felt shaken as he pulled off the clothing piece.
“I don’t know.” Jason mumbled, looking from side to side as if a great idea would pop up somewhere.
“Huh?” Was the intelligent answer Harry came up with.
Jason shook his head in denial, trying to force his thoughts away from that most unpleasant future. He would ignore the consequences as hard as he could and continue their relationship for as long as possible.
Malfoy seemed surprised and for a minute, Harry and he just stood eye to eye. After the moment, Malfoy just nodded thoughtfully and became quiet. The rest of the line was spent in awkward silence and Harry wondered if perhaps he had offended Malfoy by refusing. He just didn’t want Malfoy to think he needed his money and certainly not because he didn’t have enough on his own.  Malfoy paid for the gloves and they went outside into the cold air once more.
But today, he would have Blaise all to himself for the entire day. None of his own friends nor Blaise’s; it would just be the two of them together.
Although it worried him, Blaise was almost an adult in the eyes of the law and while Jason didn’t trust Malfoy further than he could hit his stupid face, Blaise cared for him. And although he hated to admit it to himself, he owed Malfoy for not getting him expelled. Or worst case, if anyone had investigated and found out what he was, getting him arrested.
“What is he going to do?”
Dumbledore lifted a hand, asking them to calm down before he turned to face his student.  “Harry, while I appreciate you wanting to support your friend, I must ask you to leave the teachers and I alone for this conversation.”  Harry started to protest but a big hand on his arm told him it was alright to leave. A smaller sterner hand grabbed him around the collar, dragged him outside, and pushed him back on a bench. Glancing up he saw the scolding face of his potion professor.
Harry couldn’t really decide if he liked the boy or not. While he seemed down to earth and gentleman-like, he also kind of upset Harry with all this idle gossip.
“Draco, now, please. I’m ready.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gasping together, they held on, riding out the pleasure. Draco’s arms finally gave out and he fell down beside the dark-haired boy. He wasn’t sure how long the laid there but when they finally caught their breath Potter picked up his wand, sending a cleaning spell over them. The sticky and wet combination in his boxers disappeared and Draco turned over lying on his side.
“I’m free after six.”
“Oh, Professor, Harry, I didn’t expect to see you here this evening.”
“Yes, I was thinking about last night. It was rather enjoyable. Sitting outside. Together.” He stretched it out.
Seamus smiled cockily. “Sometimes, but we are usually more careful to place charm-“ Slapping him on the chest, Dean interrupted him.
“Thank you,” She smiled into his shoulder. Her curly hair tickled his chin and ear as she silently cried into his shirt.
“Wait, Draco…”
The silence in the room became touchily uncomfortable. Severus had never intended to spend Christmas with Potter nor Lupin. It hadn’t been a complete waste of time, but it certainly never dawned on him to possibly be left alone with the wolf. Why his son insisted on them conversing, he had no idea. He would have understood the want for Potter to join, since the boys had become companions. Maybe Lupin had simply been the extension on that invite.
Accepting- and opening it, Draco was confused as to what he was looking at. It was just an address to somewhere in London. Did Severus have an apartment there? But as he completely unfolded the handwritten note, something heavy fell out and landed in his hand.
“You look beautiful.”
“That was awesome! What spell did you use? Wandless magic is really diffucult for most people.”
Harry smiled apologetic. “Sorry, you seemed completely zoned out. Is everything okay?”
“For the other times!” Harry hissed before taking a deep breath, trying to remain calm. Lately he had really been moody.
“You know, if you want something I can just-“
The blond poured a large amount on to his fingers and swirled it around. The dark pink fluid was thankfully, not so dark it reminded him of blood. As Harry laid back and enjoyed watching his boyfriend play with the lube, the scent suddenly hit him. It smelled like raspberry sorbet. Cold and fresh.
Jason smiled sadly but didn’t speak for a long time. Looking at his bed ceiling, he ignored Harry’s desperate glance.
“You think Malfoy’s parents are harsh on him?”
Leaning in, Severus quickly caught on. He removed the stray strands of hair from his date’s face as the wind played with them. When the lips were free from hair, he leaned forward and met him. He remembered them clear as day, the moment they connected. The soft slightly larger lips under his. His own thin ones were encircled by warmth. A hand moved from his neck and held on to the back of his head. As they moved against each other, a small moan escaped him and out of slight embarrassment, he bit Lauris hoping for a reaction. Thankfully, Lauris didn’t seem displeased by the rough kiss, instead he gasped and grabbed on to him even harder. He pulled on his hair, but not enough until it hurt.
“Oh no, I barely just arrived here in UK, but I have talked to him on multiple occasions. He is… helping me with a personal matter.” Jason explained. “I do not wish to speak of it, if that’s all right.” Giving a nonchalant smile.
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Then let them talk! I can’t believe this!” Having had enough he stormed up the stairs.
“No, sir.”
Unfolding it, Harry was suddenly glad he was right beside his couch. A pain he hadn’t felt in months roared its ugly head and erupted inside his chest. An irrational feeling of betrayal sank him down and he suddenly didn’t feel like going to work anymore.
Harry was about to answer but suddenly realized where they were going. They had left the bigger and more crowded part of Hogsmeade and Malfoy had dragged them towards the train station. It looked giant when the other students weren’t gathered to go home for Christmas. The onewayed track was lightly colored from the frost. Malfoy gently pulled him further until they reached the first of the smaller benches, before the actual stone walled train station began.
Blaise continued to caress his hand, waiting impatiently for him to wake. It must have been about ten painful minutes before tired eyes gently opened.
“I… Sir-“ Draco could feel tiny beads of sweat collecting in the back of his neck. “The truth is I’m in love with Harry Potter, sir.”
“Harry, could we talk for a second?”
“You have so many qualities I admired… moral, stubbornness, ethic… everything that made up for all the shit you pushed me through. But it isn’t enough anymore.”
“Harry!” Dean waved to them from the left side of the dancefloor. His friends had clearly found a liking to the table partly away from the dancing couples. Harry silently waved back.
Laughing, Draco played along. “Well Mr. Potter, Long time, no see.” He let go of the hand to reach into his pocket. Pulling it back out he reached out for Harry again, dropping the silver necklace into the outreached hand.
“Perhaps a silver tie to match?” the man must have noticed his fond for the cold shimmer.
As they slowly started grinding against each other, Harry suddenly gasped and pushed him up.
“What do you mean?”
Settling into the chair in front of Snape’s desk, he tried to keep his face as neutral as conceivable. Snape were a lot of things but stupid wasn’t one of them. His observation skills were the true reason for keeping him alive all these years and Draco knew for certain that he planned to use them for the rest of his life.
“Very funny.” The pale boy said sarcastically as he dusted off the invisible bacteria left behind from the plastic. Neither of them needed anything from the shop and as they left, Harry noticed Zabini and Jason walking past them across the road.
“NO, no Luna, please,” Harry frantically waved his hands, hoping to stop the witch before he got too familiar with one of his best friend’s sex life. “I really don’t need to hear that.”
After he had finished Snape finally let go of his chair and slowly went back to his own. Harry was almost afraid to breathe too loudly as Snape collected himself. It took a VERY long minute of silence before Snape spoke again.
Smiling, Harry turned to look at his companion.
“Blaise…” once again, strong hands wriggled out underneath his own and removed him.
Love and cookies from TMB
“He isn’t yours.” Harry mumbled as he crushed the paper between his hands. He had no reason to be jealous. He had told Malfoy to stay away from him and he had complied. Never once had he tried to find Harry at Hogwarts or afterwards. Not once….
“No, it was…” What had his dream actually been about? Right now, being awake, everything seemed so dazed and foggy. Harry hated how dreams had a tendency to do that. When you were asleep everything made perfect sense, no matter how crazy it was. Could you fly? Normal. People turning into others? Of course. But as soon as you woke up, ‘puff’, you could barely find head or tail on anything. Thinking hard for a second, things began to dawn on him. His parents had been there, so had Malfoy… they had been standing next to each other and his parents had seemed so angry. So disappointed…
The portrait which had stared at him suspiciously, suddenly swung open and Harry thanked his timeless luck.
Harry and Draco are together and in love, Harry’s friends have all decided to accept their relationship and there is only a few months until graduation.
“I think we both did.” Harry chuckled and patted her on the back.
“No, not yet.” Harry shrugged. “I not even sure if I can write anymore.”
“I know.” Jason gave a morbid smile.
“The giant?” Knott sniffed with disdain.
Once again; thank you for following this story and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this as much as I loved writing it.
Oh. Harry hadn’t even thought of that. He hadn’t been back since fourth year and he certainly couldn’t do it with weeping myrtle wandering about in the pipes. But it was truly a wonderful place to relax. He remembered all the different tapes of color and added scents. Maybe he should true it again…
Severus simply shook his head. “Never even knew he was part of our world. I don’t even know if he ever found out I was a wizard.”
With that in mind, he gently pushed against the wooden door, almost afraid of breaking it in half. A tiny bell rang above his head, indicating he had arrived. Walking inside he quickly noticed he was the only person in the quiet store. While the store looked almost abandoned from outside, the inside seemed clean and newly painted. Shelves wasn’t filled with different plastic stuff like in the muggleworld, instead large quantity of space was placed between the modest toys. Wooden boxes with bears and magic fireworks. Small black- and white painted music boxes was laid out, and the display showed old springs and metal gears screwed in.
“I never knew…” Harry whispered stunned.
Jason was obviously very surprised by the new topic but then he laughed.
At his sigh of condemn, Jason leaned in.
Harry couldn’t help but feel sorry for the egg as well as the mother. As he had learned over course of time, Dragon were very distrusting when it came to leaving their eggs behind. Just remembering how aggressive the Dragons back in fourth year had been, Harry imagined how harassed the mother must have felt.
“I don’t believe Professor Snape would appreciate us interfering his Christmas.”
. Thanking the professor for letting him stay, Harry tried to ignore the horrifying dread upsetting his stomach.
On the front of the daily profit, a huge magical photograph had taken front page and familiar faces smiled at him as they quietly moved their mouths in chatter. On the left he saw Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy standing straight beside each other as they looked towards the middle of the photo. And there, in the middle stood the reason for his pain; arms linked, Parkinson had a strong grip on the pale muscular arm clad in dress robes as Harry saw his ex, smirking at the camera and returning the look of horrible adoration of the woman. A woman, whom by what Harry had read about months ago, was now expected to be called his wife. A word that sparked jealousy and bitterness through him. He knew it was completely irrational but somehow it felt like betrayal all over again.
But before long, the bird had shed a quite amount and Jason’s face was dripping too with the unused tears. Finally the bird moved and flew back to his master and friend. Blaise was about to ask why he left before looking closer at Jason’s face.
Jason looked like a kicked puppy. His eyes rested on the lake where the giant squid was trying to break up flakes of ice. While his demeanor seemed strong, Harry could see how this experience had affected him and his vision of himself. Laying – of what was hopefully comforting- a hand on Jason shoulder, Harry gave him a short squeeze.
“THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION.” His father yelled at him in pure outrage. Shocked, Draco simply stared down at the floor, emotions flying through him. Anger at his father, fear for having to marry Pansy, and pure worry for having to hurt-
Walking into the town, Malfoy asked what he wanted to do. Looking around, Harry could see the line in Zonkos’ was short so he hurried to drag Malfoy with him.
Suddenly the common room got rather quiet.
The truth was in fact quite different. Harry and Draco hadn’t really been able to get much time alone since they started dating. Beside classes, homework and hanging out with their separate friend groups, the two boys had rarely had time to be alone. While talking and being out was great, sometimes they required meetings that were a bit more… discreet. They were after all two teen boys and Harry couldn’t help but think about sex every single time Draco smiled at him.
“Are you busy?”
As Zabini quickly went back to read for more information on the potion in their book, Jason took charge of the making.
Once again, Harry’s concentration was interrupted, this time by the sudden feeling of someone looking at him. Harry’s survival instinct had developed over the years and he had learned to listen to his gut. Carefully turning towards the back of the class so as not to further agitate his headache, he got full-on eye contact with Malfoy. The blond boy was staring straight at him. Not even trying to look away when Harry caught him staring just seemed intentionally provocative. Harry became even further irritated when suddenly Malfoy decided to smile at him. ‘Ron was right. He really is an asshole.’ Harry thought. ‘Being such an ass, he shouldn’t be allowed to look so good.’ Sensing the professor at the other end of class, Harry hurried and flipped Malfoy off before turning back again.
Behind him stood Severus Snape. His hollow cheeks and pale skin hadn’t gotten any better this summer, but Harry couldn’t imagine Snape being a sunbathing person anyway. The tall dark Professor didn’t seem to care for his response before turning on his black heels and strolling towards the door.
“Yes, but completely by accident.” Jason shook his head once again, as if he honestly didn’t even believe his own story. “One night as I was trying to sleep, I had a nightmare. Well, it wasn’t a nightmare, yet I remember the fear of loss. Which would have seemed normal, considering it had only been a few days since my father’s passing, but this was different. Where my father usually was in the dream, now stood a smaller figure in front of me. I couldn’t actually see him but just his contour.”
In the bed diagonally from his own, laid two boys twisted in the sheets. They were both topless and Harry could see the way they were glistening with sweat. Harry hadn’t even noticed that Dean and Seamus missed dinner, but they had surely skipped on purpose. Hiding slightly behind the door, Harry couldn’t help but stare at his two friends. Somewhere his consciousness was telling him how wrong it was to spy at his friends in their private moment. A voice, whom Harry had only heard few before, was drooling at the sight, telling him to get closer. Harry didn’t realize how long he continued to stare, but soon a loud moan snapped him out of it and he coughed.
“Yeah, I just- I haven’t been around animals a lot.”
another time.”
Draco smiled.
Jason? He was certainly the nicest boy from Slytherin. He was kind of cute. Not so much Harry’s type, but he could see the appeal. So someone as nice but not Jason in particular. Besides, he was obviously very much in love with Zabini. Zabini was very handsome, smart, certainly. A few more people had grown up a lot this summer.
are going to tell your parents you don’t want to get married?”
Trying to get his panting under control, Draco pushed a sweaty lock of hair out of his face. “Now, I think it’s my turn to have fun.” Grabbing the smaller man around his waist, he pulled Harry up and turned them over.
“About time,” Jason huffed. Harry didn’t say anything but it seemed quite obvious that the veela didn’t care for the blond, Jason’s boyfriend considered his best friend. Getting near the Gryffindor table, Jason turned towards his own house, yelling across his shoulder; “Save me a dance, wonder boy, okay?”
“Right, so based on your conclusion, we should just eliminate every new person moving to England and/or Scotland… just in case they supported the You-know-who?” Dean snorted.
He almost regretted asking such a personal and depressing question when he saw the way Jason’s jaw clenched. The hand on his chest clenched around a handful of his shirt.
“Granger, Potter and I are going on a date. Next Hogsmeade trip.” Malfoy explained in a tightlipped manner. The following silence seemed to last a lifetime. It couldn’t possibly be, but Harry imagined someone dropped a pin to the floor. Then hell broke loss.
Even though Draco hadn’t turned over, Blaise could hear the rather unmanly sniffling sounds and something wet hitting his pillow.
“Are you alright?”
“A few weeks later I was filled with anger at my own stupidity as I overheard a conversation I wasn’t supposed to. In that anger and dread I told the Dark Lord, begging him for understanding and considering sparring the only person I had left back here in England. Pathetic.”
They kept incredibly close as Lauris’s hands were on his lower back, while Severus’ own were entangled in his curly hair.
Christmas colors adored the great hall and enchanted snowflakes fell from the ceiling as the students enjoyed their breakfast. Most of them had already changed into their casual robes or in some cases muggle wear. Harry sat nervously and discreetly looked to the sky once in a while. The train would be stationed in a few hours and his present for Draco still hadn’t arrived. He and Draco hadn’t talked about their fight the other day and honestly, it was killing him. Both of them could be so stubborn and short tempered it was truly impressive it had lasted this long before either had lost their temper. The bigger problem was that since they had discussed their ‘relationship’, Harry wasn’t even certain if he should give Draco the present or not. If this was really how he felt about Harry then maybe a gift would only make him feel pushed.
“Yes and no. While it wasn’t intentional, werewolves don’t back out. So my feelings for Sirius had never changed from that of a brother and a friend, but the wolf inside me controlled a part. He wanted to be with Sirius no matter the consequences. As long as I was “with” Sirius, I could control the animalistic part of me. We would hold hands, kiss on the forehead, sleep in the same bed and be together in the forest. That was enough for me. We were never ‘together’. I was grateful that Sirius - who was a wellknown skirtchaser- was comfortable helping me. The days where we tried keeping apart I would break out in fever. So most nights we stayed together.”
Harry hadn’t thought of it like that.
“Hello, young Harry. Are you all done for today?”
They two boys jumped away from each other as the sound of stone hitting the floor and a loud clink from broken glass could be heard from outside the door. The horrible shrieking of Peeves laughter rendered and some of the younger students had obviously been caught in the middle of the chaos, as at least two different girls screamed. Peeves had probably thrown something through one of the higher windows as the sound of glass breaking continued.
“No.” Malfoy answered. “Blaise hasn’t left his side all night.”
After leaving another pair, Harry took two drinks for them of a floating tray.
“Wow, I feel like we are in Italy.”
“I meant what I said; I love him.” The natural pale face turned ash grey as he spoke. “He wasn’t the way I expected-“
Later that evening, after the boys fell asleep, Harry pulled on his cloak and went to visit the prefects’ bathroom. Inside the large marbled room, everything was quiet and slightly cold. The eggshell colored walls and floor echoed any sort of noise, such as Harry naked feet. The mosaic mermaid on the large window laid gently over her rock sleeping. Her tail was harmonically slowly waving back and fourth in the water. Harry turned on the pipes of the multicolored waters and soon a hot-bubbled bath of purple water and lily-scented, stood ready for him to dive in.
“Cute teddy by the way.” Neville teased him. Looking down he noticed the giraffe had fallen beside him and Harry’s heart began racing. He hadn’t found Draco yet and the train was almost here! He hurried to magically wrap the giraffe in green colors and a giant red ribbon before running out of the room. He felt sorry not to wait for Neville but he had to find Draco before he left. Getting to the entrance hall, he looked around the tons of students whom were already leaving. Seeing Dean, he breathlessly asked if he had seen the blond. Shaking his head, Dean told him the Slytherin usually left as the first ones, to get good seats.
“Hey!” Harry defended weakly. “He isn’t like that anymore.”
The professor sat down in his chair behind his desk and gestured for Harry to sit down as well. For some time Harry squirmed in his seat, as the black eyes stared him into the soul. Snape seemed… uncertain, for a change.
“Sure.” Blaise said. “We will see you tomorrow.” The boy turned and Jason gave a slight wave before they left.
“You are in love?... With Potter?”
“I wasn’t!” Harry pulled on the piece of clothing and backing a step away. “I was just waiting for… the sweater.”
“You seem… off.”
Oh god, Malfoy. Harry hadn’t even considered how he must be feeling. Crab. He sat on the wrong side of the table. He wouldn’t be able to look to the Slytherin table without being completely obvious.
, Draco… how could you possible understand how that feels?!”
“Shut it.” Draco sneered. The more he thought about having to listen to Pansy for the rest of his life, the less dreadful it sounded hooking up with Potter. God, what had his life become? Essentially, he knew this whole idea was way too much effort for such a small payout. But he wasn’t going to marry Pansy. Ever. So, what if Potter was going to get his heart broken? He had the next sixty years of his life to marry that ginger weaselette and have hundreds of annoying brats.
“So?” She placed her hands on her hip, trying to look intimidating.
Potter just used his arm to remove what was left of the note, onto the floor before turning back to his book.
“There!” Hermione clapped her hands in a finished manner. “Alright, I have to go get dressed. I’ll see you downstairs.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to have anything to say, which again was a huge surprise considering his favourite activity was to hear his own voice; Harry thought semi-amused.
“I believe this could be to our advantage.” His mother finally intervened.
“Yeah and the professors.”
About to retort, Draco got distracted by Potter’s head becoming visible again behind the annoying girl. The golden trio had all gotten up from their seats and was heading for class. Without answering her, Draco got up and nodded at his two companions for them to follow him. This had better be worth it.
“Do you want me to stay?” He knew Draco would say no, but it mattered that he offered.
Smiling their friends left them to the sweet moment and continued their search for clothes.
“I’m sorry, love.” He kissed him gently. “I just want it to be the right time and not in the middle of a freezing forest.” He looked around.
“Hmm, not very well.” Remus confessed.
“It doesn’t matter what he said or did. I lost control amongst my peers and I could truly have injured Malfoy or even another student. And while I wouldn’t trust him further than I could throw him, it is no excuse. I hurt Blaise by hurting his friend. It’s unforgiveable and if it happens again, I will leave Hogwarts permanently. My- Professor Snape has informed me of my punishment and Blaise is barely speaking to me right now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
With that he hurried to turn around and almost ran for the door. He heard Draco call him from behind somewhere, but he really didn’t want to talk about it right now. He hurried down to Hagrid’s hut as the rain quickly soaked him wet. He hadn’t imagined Draco could hurt him this hard by referring to them as ‘casual’. It wasn’t so much the words but mainly because Harry had believed them to be so much more. He almost slipped twice on the smooth rocks but thankfully caught his balance at the last second. As he arrived, he knocked quite loudly on the door, calling out to Hagrid.
“No matter, Mr. Potter, I will advise you not to accept any kind of consumption from others tonight.”
“Yeah, my father looks like he ate a lemon every time Professor Lupin is mentioned.”  Harry felt his eyes on him and he must have looked contemplating because Jason wondered why he asked.
“Well, it certainly isn’t fair to compare yourself to us, good sir.” The twins dusted off invisible smudge from their fancy multi-colored suits. Harry laughed and thanked the pair. He had almost turned to head and join the others, when Fred caught his shoulder.
“Guys… I-“ Okay, deep breath. Harry tried again. “Malfoy and I have been talking for a while now and we have decided to try and put the past behind us.” Yes, that didn’t sound half bad.
“Just answer me this, Potter.” Getting a nod, he continued. “Is Mr. Malfoy the reason why you were sitting in an abandoned classroom?”
“He doesn’t even know?” Harry exclaimed. Jason only shook his head.
Despite his body sweating already, Harry felt his body freeze as he looked at the fireplace. Or rather, what was in the fireplace. A scolding black cauldron was positioned on top of the roaring fire and in it was a rather familiar sound of something round gentle pressing up against it, rolling around.
Harry wondered what could possibly have gotten him in such a mood. Malfoy was a little prissy sometimes but he was usually better at keeping his emotions in check in public.
“Potter, could I speak to you for a second?”
He truly hadn’t heard from Malfoy in almost three weeks. It was strange and almost sadistic but Harry was glad to see he wasn’t the only one struggling to get by right now. Malfoy was back to being the intolerable git he had always been. But instead of sauntering around with his nose held high, he acted as a silent observer. His unreasonable angry manner had kept most of the school – even the Slytherins – from approaching him.
“Jason?” He tried to keep his obvious panic out of his question. “What… will happen if he doesn’t?”
Malfoy actually had the audacity to look ashamed. But he didn’t answer.
“-And that was indeed the last time someone would bring a real ice breathing dragon to another Hogwarts event. Well, everyone please take your seats as dinner will be served shortly.”
Harry left the tower, assured that Winy would deliver the presents to the werewolf’s private quarters. Remus’ Quarters were behind the door in the back of the Defense against Dark Arts’ classroom. Walking through the halls, he witnessed all the magical scenes on the walls where the paintings had gathered around each other’s frames, celebrating Christmas in their own manner. Many of whom wished Harry a Merry Christmas when they saw him stroll by.
“I’m sorry.” And Harry realized he truly was. Zabini must have felt stuck in a terrible position. His boyfriend had practically tried to beat the shit out of his best friend.
“Good, Ms. Grant, now hurry up. And you Mr. Poppy, why are you still standing there?”
Holding his friend’s gaze, Harry’s true intention seemed to dawn on him.
‘The nerve of the brat. Why did he have to be such a prudish golden boy? Was it simple impossible for him and his friends to unwind?’ Draco fumed. He tried to get the boiling heat in his chest under control as he watched Potter and the annoying mudblood, laughing. The poor excuse of a Slytherin should stay where he belonged, chasing after Blaise like a helpless puppy. Angrily, Draco tried to concentrate and write down a paragraph from the book, but the end of his quill broke under the pressure.
“Harry, what happened? Please talk to me.”
“Oh, I forgot.” He admitted. “I guess I won’t be able to fit into my old ones anymore.”
Harry could no longer sit still and jumped out of his seat.
“Argh! Oh…” Potter moaned, clearly surprised by his own voice. Draco wanted, no needed to hear him again. The idea of the golden boy, Dumbledore’s little prodigy, lying underneath the Slytherin god, begging Draco to fuck him, was the biggest turn on, Draco had ever fantasized. He continued to grind slowly as he felt Harry pull him down for another kiss.
Harry smiled. “Yes, very much,” blushing slightly, he looked into his cup. “In fact, I… I think I love him.”
“Did you meet Parkinson?”
Everyone, especially Ron seemed surprised by the notion.
Malfoy finally seemed to catch the meaning. “Ah, of course.” He coughed and Harry appreciated how well he hid his disagreement.
hear what it was about, but Parkinson seemed very interested in Malfoy’s ‘situation’ and I can only assume she meant you.”
“Buying your mother a card is NOT a gift.” Dean declared.
Continuing Harry looked him straight in the eyes. “I really didn’t think I could be so happy with anyone.” The silver eyes flicked quickly before the warmth returned. “Me neither.”
“Yeah, but I’m just wondering… if you could tell me how to…” Harry left off. At the blundering look on Dean’s face, it was obvious he had no idea what he was hinting at. “How to start it.” He sighed.
“Merlin, we have to tell our parents.” Dragging a hand through his hair, he prepared himself for a scolding of a lifetime.
“No Jason, it was ALL of them.”
Suddenly the finger was pulled out of his mouth and first then, did he realize he had closed his eyes. Opening the green emeralds at the sudden shock, Harry barely had the time to see, before Malfoy had pushed him against the shelves behind him. The jars around them rattled slightly, but the two of them were much too busy to wonder.
Harry tried, he truly did, but finally seeing the man he loved again even after everything, hearing him say the words he had longed for, for so many months were overwhelming. A great sob left him as he stared down into his lap, refusing to see the shock on Draco’s face.
As many students started leaving the hall, Harry turned to catch eye contact with his boyfriend from Slytherin. The blond looked up from his own plate and saw him. Smirking, Draco nodded towards the entrance. Feeling butterflies lift off in his stomach; Could it be Draco was going to ask him to the dance? Or should Harry ask first? Damn conventional manners… would Draco be angry if he asked? Would it make him feel less like a man? It wouldn’t bother Harry, but Harry had never had a boyfriend before… and maybe wizards had a different outlook on manners when it came to homosexuality?
Standing in front of him was the cashier with his bag, smiling so brightly you would have thought Christmas had come early.
Severus confused glance must somehow have been enough to decide. Suddenly Lauris reached around the bar and grabbed a bottle of wine.
Trying to keep from shaking, Harry started toying with the leather belt. It seemed strange but the smell of the leather was rather arousing, and he leaned it closer to smell it.
“Do you want to see something cool?”
Once again it will be a sad chapter. I wonder how?
The tense taller boy suddenly changed completely. Turning towards him, Jason sat up with a smile. Although the smile certainly wasn’t very convincing. He tousled Harry hair and asked him not to worry.
“How did you meet?” Harry wondered.
“Malfoy, get off me!”
“Actually. While Mr. Zabini is free to do as he please, wither he feels for my son or not, he will suffer no consequences if he should choose to leave. My son has no choice. Should I constantly prepare myself for losing everything I have left…”
“Mr. Potter sent for Winky.” She simply declared, awaiting her order.
Smirking, the blond kissed his hand and pulled him towards his circle of friends. Harry tried his best to keep his beating heart under control, but he clearly felt every eye in the hall on him and Draco. Their fellow students were whispering and staring as if waiting for him to make a mistake and trip or suddenly pull away from the Slytherin in pure revulsion. He strongly held on to the leading hand in his and simply gazed at his friends, whishing people would go back to their own business.
“No-ugh!” Dean had shoved Seamus with a well-placed elbow right in the side.
“Nah. It’s nothing. My… friends and I had just argued a bit, about you.”
“That’s great. Congratulations.” Harry chuckled and lifted the spoon off his tray. Pumpkin soup wasn’t a favorite but the warmth was needed.
“I guess I say goodnight now.”
“OOOH.” Pansy’s eyes practically feel out of her sockets in blinded glee. “Potter is there, you don’t say! May I join you?”
“Have you finished the charm essay?” groaning behind him Crabbe picked up another sour worm angrily eating it. Zabini smirked and looked at him.
Blaise almost followed as the hand fell from his cheek. Shaking his head like a petulant toddler, he kept trying to grab Jason’s hands again.
The atmosphere and the desperate way Lupin uttered his name, made him feel somehow anxious and right now, he longed for the peace and quiet Christmas’ he remembered.
The pair had been sitting for almost two hours and Jason had barely said a word to him. Beside ‘Hello’ and ‘This book should have the answers”.
Thank you to all of you who’ve continued to read it.
“Sure. There are only two third years from Slytherin staying, so the dorm room will be empty.”
“Why don’t they just go to a normal.. erhm.. Doctor?”
Well. Potter, I actually had a proposition for you.” A proposition? That was certainly a surprise. A dangerous one coming from the blond Slytherin. Malfoy didn’t exactly look at him but rather over his head, staring. He seemed sort of nervous, blinking a little more than what was necessary.
“It will be okay. Zabini won’t be able to stay mad for too long. He cares for you too much.”
“That isn’t the point, whether I liked her or not. She wasn’t a witch, Draco. Neither was his father. He has lived with his father until recently, and never spoken of his mother, so as far as I know, Jason is a mudblood. How could I possibly bring home a mudblood?” Blaise’s voice had raised to a certain level and the professor had heard them.
Madam Pomphrey was convinced Jason could sense that Blaise was beside and while it made absolutely no sense why he would do that, Blaise stayed beside him. Hoping it wasn’t too late.
“Because we have to sit with our partners. Professor Binns teamed us up for the project.”
“Really?” Harry doubted.
The professor had never looked away from Harry during his monolog of rambling and questions. After waiting for a few seconds to see if Harry had anymore to add, he looked speculating out the window. A deafening silence stretched out and Harry wasn’t sure were to look anymore. It seemed awkward to continue staring at Professor Snape as he was looking elsewhere. Looking at the tiny black heater in the middle of their room Harry stared at the tiny flame dancing.
“SHH!” Madam Pince hissed as she passed by with a cart.
“How are you?”
Pansy shrug casually.
Using whatever power he had left, Harry squeezed down on the hard flesh inside him. Feeling his face heat up even more than it already was, Harry leaned up and kissed Draco’s neck. Not just kissed, no, he started sucking and licking his entire collarbone. Harry felt rather self-conscious since he had no idea if he was actually giving Draco any additional pleasure. But Draco moaned and suddenly slipped a hand into his hair. Cradling his head, the Slytherin pushed Harry’s head against him. He ran his hands down Draco’s body and gently grabbed the strong globes that flexed every time Draco moved. Harry pushed Draco along as he went into him and then sat his nails in. While his nails weren’t long, the slightly added pain only spurred Draco on. His hard thrusts were becoming erratic and uneven.
As he sipped his tea, Remus chose to change the conversation to something a bit more cheerful.
Harry was no longer afraid of Lucius as he had been as a boy. He calmly gave Lucius and answer with the coldest voice he could muster.
“Yes?”
Sitting down, Harry leaned up against the hard surface of the tree. Malfoy sat down right beside him and Harry couldn’t help but notice how their thighs touched. He could feel the heat Malfoy’s body gave away, and again he got chills, although this time it sent a pleasant shiver through his entire body.
“Students! We will be walking to Hogsmeade together. When we arrive at the bridge to Hogsmeade, you may split up. We meet back by the bridge at EXACTLY three. Tardiness will be punished by point withdrawal.” Professor McGonagall declared. “And Mr. Filch had made me remind you that bringing back any items from Zonko’s or Wasleys’ WILL be confiscated! Am I understood?” A distant mutter around the student bodies arose.
“Because Blaise is my mate.” Jason finished.
Rambling slightly in the feared state, Severus almost forgot whom he was speaking to.
“Merlin it’s getting late. I should head back. I kind of have a long way down unlike you.” He grinned and said goodnight. Harry gave him a small wave as he disappeared down the stairs. He should probably go to bed as well. On the other hand, the view was truly magnificent right then and it would be a shame to miss it.
“Your breath stink of sweetened bloodpops.”
Hearing chatter, Harry realized he had already walked all the way to the classroom. He didn’t want to see Malfoy right now, but they had History together, so he decided to take a seat up front. Entering the mass of ranting students, he took a seat next to Jennifer Gordon. She didn’t speak much and right now, Harry could stand some silence. Gordon ignored him as he sat down.
“-Right, and that was very nice of you. Would you like to join us for some eggnog?”
“I always had it with me and then one night I had a nightmare so I sought out my parents. I knew they were somewhere in the manor but it is a pretty big mansion. I finally came across my father’s study and I heard him talk. Figuring it was okay, I entered.” He sighed.
Jason simply held up a hand, stopping him from finishing his sentence.
“Oh, ermh, I was looking for Draco.”
“Harry, I understand you have sent a letter to Mr. Lupin.”
“What?” Draco pondered as he handed him the sweater. Following Harry gaze, he smirked. Even though Draco had pulled down his arms, his shirt was slightly tucked out of his pants now.
“Hey.” Malfoy’s voice sounded coarse.
“Maybe.” Harry grimaced. “But with everything lately… and Ginny, it’s…”
“We will have to see over the next few days, but he seems strong, except for the foot.” Hagrid mumbled. Wondering what he meant, Harry gathered the small reptile and held him out from himself. Hagrid was right; the left back foot was incredibly smaller than the rest. It twitched slightly as if the nerves weren’t really working probably yet.
“Why didn’t you just tell him they provoked you?” Hermione interfered.
The sounds from downstairs became louder as though a small army was gathered to watch the blessed event.
“You better watch out from now on, Scarface.”
Neither boy could withhold the laughter and only settled down when Professor Flitwick lightly scolded them; “
“If I may ask. How did you know you loved Blaise?”
“Oh dear, we are one to many today.” The Professor stood thoughtfully. “Alright, Mr. Goyle, Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Zabini you will become a group of three and then Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Melck you will be teamed up as well. Alright students, remember the petals….” She started off as the students scrambled together around the pots. Looking to his left he saw Blaise pull Melck sleeve towards him and heard the whispered; “Be nice.” Before the olive-skinned boy left them alone. It was hard to say which of the two boys seemed most unsatisfied by the predicament. Even though Melck was rather good at hiding his dislike, Malfoy had grown up recognizing facial expressions. It was a rather important part of making deals and speaking at the Ministry. If you didn’t know where you had someone standing at, it could become an unfortunate situation of betrayal later on.
“What?” Draco looked him over once more and this time he noticed the three books Harry was carrying under his arm. “Oh no, Potter, you’re NOT ditching me again.”
“Oof.” Harry groaned as his back hit the cold wall. Draco refused to take a second glance around. No, it wasn’t exactly a romantic spot snogging beside a toilet, but he was at his wits end.
“He did. I told him everything one day, but he still refused to see me again and I couldn’t blame him. I had hurt him deeply.”
When he returned, Jason hadn’t moved an inch.
Harry was rather curios as to why Luna used his first name, but mentioned he seemed fine.
“Yeah I could use something warm.” Harry gave a small smile and both went in the direction of the Three Broomsticks. Opening the rotting tree door, the boys saw how packed the place was. Finding a smaller table at the center, they sat down. They didn’t say much to each other before one of the barmaids wanted their order.
“Ouch…” Harry muttered.
“Malfoy,” Harry asked when he was done laughing. “Why did you ask me out here?”
Harry was so focused on that slightly revealing piece of skin. His eyes felt glued to it and it was incredibly obvious what he was staring at.
Harry just threw the shirt at him while the two boys laughed. “You know I think this would be much easier if you guys weren’t here.”
Harry got a very nostalgic feeling as the Professor read from a long list of waiting students. As the first student was called, the line slowly began moving. As Harry got closer and closer, he felt his heart race. He clapped politely at his classmates, not that he remembered the names off all, but he was cheering loudly as his closest stepped up.
“Erhm… Harry?” Jason poked him in the side.
Most girls were dressed up in long formal dresses in a rainbow of colors clashing against each other as they mingled. A few wore shorter ones to right under their knees as it was still a formal party. Harry even saw one girl wearing a silver jumpsuit with a matching feather in her hair. Although he had absolute no sense of fashion and was sure he was gay, he actually found the suit rather appealing. Finally, they went down the stairs and could see the great hall doors. The doors were opened wide and classic music were blasting out.
Stepping closer, Harry watched him as Draco sat down in front of him, lying on his knees.
Still completely, lost Harry and Dean sent each other equally confused as to what the strange boy was talking about. As he realized his suggestion wouldn’t get the grateful reaction he was hoping for, Seamus gave an exasperated sigh before making a very crude hand gesture, earning him a blushing Harry and a very sore arm from where Dean had hit him in offense.
“Sorry, Luna?”
The wolf sighed as he explained. “Harry it was the middle of the seventies’. Adults and teens at that time feared the shame and the obvious hatred that came with being homosexual. Adults were assaulted on the open street for kissing a member of the same sex. Certainly, no student would ever admit to it at that time. It was simply… experimentation. A way to seal yourself away from a life as an outcast.”
“But, Harry think- ouch! Ron!” Hermione hissed as a vine grabbed her from behind.
Harry hurried to reassure the young man.
Shaking her pretty head, she took of her gloves. “I need to do this; alone.” Taking his hand once more, Pansy cried. “Thank you, for trying to be mine.”
Being completely caught unaware, he glanced at the Slytherin to see what he wanted. The snake looked rather amused and pointed a finger towards his hands.
“Hey-“ Harry eat another peppermint toffee. “Is he the reason why you can do all that veela-stuff now?”
“Hey!” He spluttered as Dean pulled the curtain aside to see him. He gave him a slightly drawn elevator look before exclaiming he looked nice.
“By the way, Harry, have you bought new robes yet?”
to catch a dance?” Harry asked in disbelief. Why was Draco acting so weird?
The students had as always assembled in front of the main gate, where Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra were waiting for them. Harry shot longing glances at the small snowcovered cabin, where smoke was raising from the chimney.
An awkward silence followed as Ron turned around to pace back and forth, fuming. Harry didn’t know what to say. He felt so caught in the middle of hellfire. But once again, he found himself surprised be Malfoy’s ability to adapt and act.
him, I always missed you.” Then the sound of a door closed.
“Snobbish?” Dean piled on.
“You almost…” Embarrassingly his voice cracked.
“Wait, Potter!” A scrubby strong hand grabbed his overarm and spun him around with all its power. Pansy held up her hands in front of her, hoping to stop him. “I knew you wouldn’t believe me without evidence…” Leaving off, she produced a tiny vial from her inner pocket. Showing him the object, he quickly identified the clear liquid inside the flask.
“You welcome.” Draco ignored the sarcasm. He suddenly seemed to realize what Harry had called him. “Easy Scarhead. I’ll have you know I’m from a perfect long line of aristocratic pureblood.”
“Aha! So it’s true!” George pointed an accusing finger at him. “Did you hear that Gred?”
“Oh, Severus! I was worried you had stood me up.” He smiled shyly.
Monday morning. What a joy.
Harry thought for what felt like hours in the small livingroom. He watched as Draco stood there, vulnerable, waiting for his answer. If all the pain had let to this one moment, he knew this was the time to take revenge. Here, right now, he could crush Draco’s entire will to live. He could tell him how much better he was doing without him. How happy he was with another man. A man who was smart and kind and nothing like him. Make Draco know how unwanted he was in comparison to Harry life outside of Hogwarts.
“Have you any idea how to even begin talking to him? You are not exactly on civil speaking terms.” Blaise stated as he kept eating his egg benedict.
The recognizable bell rang as he stepped inside the shop. An older couple sat in the back with each of their papers, completely ignoring his presence. There was no line at the register as Lauris came out from the back.
Back in the infirmary, Madam Pomphrey had concluded her lecture on healing Jason’s skin, by handing Blaise a salve to rub CAREFULLY on to his broken skin. The young men grimaced when she told them his skin would be pretty well after shedding the old. Silently Blaise started dapping the neck and chest with the ill-smelling potion. Nothing happened except turning his skin slightly green but that was to be expected.
Snape still couldn’t believe this. Looking into his eyes how hadn’t he seen it before? Watching him now, the ice blue color could only resemble to one man. He noticed all the similar details. The same hair, same chin, his own intelligence and height. He had a son.
“Thanks but I think I’m staying here.”
“Mr. Potter, Follow me.”
“Jason?” no response. “Jason?”
“Sounds fun.” Harry scratched the back of his head, continuing to fold his clothes. Somehow it seemed easier to talk if you didn’t actually had to look another man in the eyes. Especially when it considered ‘touchy’ subjects.
Neither boy said anything before Blaise was finished with the exposed chest and neck. Blaise was ready to begin on the cracked face, which still looked frightening. Unsure wither Jason would allow the contact, Blaise leaned the cloth forward towards him, waiting to see if Jason had any deviation. A slight nod was all he got. Truly studying the wounds now, Blaise could no longer keep quiet.
The entire pond was completely frozen over, not a single bead of water or thawing sides in sight. The sun shone lightly, reflecting the ice and snow as tiny diamonds. Few spectrums of color could be noticed as they moved around it.
“Thanks, you guys.” He said sarcastically. “I don’t know where I would be without you.”
The teachers prepared for them to leave and the students slowly started walking.
“Are you planning on telling him?”
HP POV
Shaking his head, Harry clarified; “I don’t care. I know we aren’t perfect but I… I really like him.” It felt incredibly awkward standing in the middle of his professor’s office and defending his flirt.
“What? Really?” Blaise searched the pale face, desperate to find any truth to the words.
“I just think it is weird, okay? A new guy very keen on befriending the boy who lived? What do you even know about him?”
Chapter 20 is here! it's a bit longer than usual but i think it would be good on such a monday.
“Not really.” Seamus said bored. Ron leaned in closer across the table as if he was about to solve a major mystery.
“We have to talk.”
Carting his fingers through his hair in nervous habit, Harry shrugged. “Well, I just don’t imagine it’s easy for them to come back this year. With most of them gone overseas and parents’ in jail, you know?”
“Ron? You told them?” Dean asked perplexed.
“So maybe we could find a day and do something. Again?” oh…
Normally on a beautiful day such as this, Harry would be outside with the rest of the students but for now, he was stuck inside the library. With the spelled warmth inside the giant room, a sweater was unnecessary, but Harry couldn’t help but feel the need for soft sweaters, hot chocolate by the fire and having another snowball fight. Wanting the homework to be over as quickly as possible, the two boys spent every free hour together at the library. It might seem like an easy task but the assignments demanded even more research than last time, and getting together when Slytherin and Gryffindor had a free period wasn’t more than once a week.
“Um, well I thought maybe you could…”
He should have learned to expect it. To except how little he would ever matter to others…
“I know.” Harry was still heaving for air, trying to ignore the hurt of Remus’ comment. “But I wanted to talk to you in private. Why do you have to leave so soon?”
“Pansy if you haven’t realized it, Draco isn’t interested. Perhaps you should try someone more… easy. Like you.”
“Harry, I know it is Christmas and perhaps not the time but I wish to apologies.”
“Dude, are you okay? You’ve gone all pale.”
He was crying.
As he had almost left the warm castle, Draco stood waiting by the great hall. Seeing Harry, he smiled and waved him over. He wasn’t really busy so he went to see what the Slytherin wanted. Gathering some courage, Harry leaned in to give him a quick peck ‘hello’.
“Come now, my boy,” Dumbledore grabbed the taller man by his elbow as he led the annoyed man with him. “It has been a very long time since we’ve had a drink together.”
She gently placed a hand upon his. “Don’t say it.”
“- so either the second battle of Morigan or the first goblin war between Fresdaa and the Bullei- clans…”
“Harry Potter.” McGonagall called his name and the hall exploded in cheers. Smiling bashfully, Harry went on stage towards Dumbledore. Getting close enough he accepted the scroll and smiled at his professor. Kind blue eyes seemed static and two strong hands embraced him.
Getting up he went to his trunk in which a single closed box lay. Spelling it opened, he looked inside. In it laid his family’s map, his father’s cloak and the photo album Hagrid had given him. And right on top of everything was Draco’s gift placed. The necklace was still one of his favorite things and the only present he had ever gotten from a boyfriend and Draco. Carefully, he placed the chain around his neck and locked it in the impossible small loop. Harry knew it was simply his mind playing tricks but he could swear the pendant felt warm against his skin.
“Everyone, please! Calm down now.”
“Well, I personally wouldn’t mind saying ‘hello’ again.” Dean assured him with a smirk, as he barely avoided a fist towards his shoulder from his rather annoyed boyfriend. Ron pretended not to hear them and answered Harry back.
Harry had been sitting for half an hour before the compartment door once again opened.
Hagrid looked troubled for a few seconds as his bushy eyebrows frowned. In the end he shrugged his big shoulders and shook his head.
Nothing happened.
Theodore could no longer hold it in and as the staircase moved, he almost didn’t make it, laughing so hard. The others, even though smirking, had better control over their amusement. Blaise on the other hand had his fist and most likely his jaw, clenched. As Theodore continued to laugh the gang headed up to the third floor.
“I’m sorry.” Malfoy whispered. As Harry looked at him, he realized Malfoy looked more... surprised than sorry. “I really am.” He whispered. Laying a gentle hand on his arm, he felt Malfoy give a tiny jump, almost as if he had forgotten he wasn’t alone. Malfoy shook his head, probably to clear it. Smiling, Harry leaned slightly against his shoulder. Malfoy continued to ask him questions about his childhood, or lack of. Some questions were easy; where he grew up, how his family looked – Malfoy laughed at his comparison of a pig to his cousin-, others were slightly harder. Questions whom not even his friends had ever asked him. Even though it didn’t change what had happened to him, Harry found it difficult anyway to answer how his birthdays’ were like, how he learned to read and write, the time he learned about his real family and how the Durleys’ had lied to him. Through the whole conversation, Malfoy listened carefully and never interrupted or pushed him. When he ran out of questions, they simple sat together. Harry felt somewhat exhausted from all the talking and closed his eyes for a second. Simply to rest them.
“Sometimes.” Malfoy looked so serious and crazy beautiful as the sun glowed directly at him.
“That is usually how people meet.” He tried not to snort.
“Hey Potter, need a little for the nerves?” Luke from sixth year pushed a flask under his nose. Luke’s date – Amber something- had her arms around him and shyly smiled encouragingly at him. Her purple dress was rather tasteful as she leaned against her date.
“Yeah, why?” Harry tried to keep his voice from reaching a higher pitch, worried Jason had seen something today.
“Yeah okay, but I was hoping I could wait for him here.”
jinx and disspell it by using the shield charm ‘
Draco possibly looked sick, but he managed to nod. “If… if it means we can still be friends then yes.”
“Maybe this?” Harry held up the white pocketed shirt for the second time.
Good. He should be.
Severus sighed harshly. “You know as well as I, veelas mortality is dependent on their mate. I fear what happens next as they meet struggles.”
Jason just smirked back at his friend whom was trying to withhold his laughter. They all waited in anticipation, although Remus’ was probably more akin to nervousness. Finally, they heard a door slam shot and the clicking of forceful footsteps approaching.
Keeping his wand ready but out of sight, Harry opened the door.
The horrible smell of pure alcohol reached his nostrils and he laughingly threw it back at the owner.
“Jason,” he could barely whisper the words as his throat felt painfully dry. “Can you hear me?”
“You’ve changed…” She took a steading breath. “Both you and Blaise. I used to respect you. Your ideas, ambitions. Why would you throw that away, just for…” she left off, shaking her head, denying the truth.
The door to the classroom had been opened and the students strolled inside whispering with chatter.
Jason just waved his hand at him in a careless manner.
He had barely left the two first areas where he could imagine Jason had sought liberty, before he overheard a group of Hufflepuffs mentioning his name.
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled before turning quiet. The boys agreed their break had lasted long enough and went back to work.
“Hey Fang.” Harry pushed the dog down and continued to rub his giant head. The scaredy-cat muscle dog barked a few more times before heading back for the hole he had furiously been digging.
“Severus, please, I have wished to speak to you for months.”
Soon everything was back to a boring normal day. While writing notes, Blaise couldn’t help but discreetly glance at Weasley. He couldn’t really see his face as the ginger was sitting up front, but it wasn’t hard to see how the book-nosed girl beside him, was trying to calm him down and continuing to furiously scribble notes on the side. While he couldn’t hear what they were whispering about, he certainly noticed that the golden boy was missing from their clutches. Perhaps he had snuck out and run after Draco. It was as good an explanation as any. Blaise also wasn’t the only one who noticed a small paperbird flying back and forth between the gryffindorks whenever Flitwick was scrawling on the headboard.
Looking further down the table sat his godson. It wasn’t unusual to see him sitting alone during this time of day. Even from a young age, the boy had been an early riser. That hadn’t changed during his teenage years and being an early riser usually meant he was easy to talk to at least with his companions. But something had obviously caught the boy’s eyes as he stared intently at something across. Following his line of sight, Severus got surprised laying his eyes on Potter. Draco was sitting behind him and Harry had apparently no idea he was being stared at. The boy was clearly too busy writing something on a piece of paper.
The shocked face of the brute girl was worth giving up information on his mission for. Even though the shocked face was quickly replaced by a barely contained grunt. Laughing, Pansy moved a few locks of loose hair back in place.
Hermione should have been used to Ron’s indifference towards school, but the witch still couldn’t help but roll her eyes and sent Harry a rather exhausted look.
Laughing, Jason lifted his finger and made an invisible cross across his shirt.
“Maybe. What about you?”
“Do you worry for the Slytherins?” Snape inclined.
“Maybe,” Hermione tried to console him. “You should try one of the Gryffindors.”
Again and again, he played the kiss scene in his head. Again and again.
Kiss,
“I can’t believe this!”
“Potter.”
“Yes, he was in fact the one who told me.” Severus whispered, holding on to his cup a little too tightly.
, it became Ron and Harry’s duty to keep the thorny vines away from her. It certainly wasn’t an easy job. Even though the plant had barely reached half its adult size, it was incredibly strong and more than once grabbed Hermione by the hair if the boys weren’t quick enough. Professor Sprout had definitely been right when she said the plants acted like teenagers. Whenever the students finally thought they had the upper hand, a vine would whip them across the ankle; making most of them fall over.
Looking out through the small hole between the stature’s arm and side, Harry watched as Snape marched past him and down the corridor. Harry was painfully aware of the fact that he had stopped breathing and he soundlessly gasped for air. Snape had really been helpful this year and saved his life on multiple occasions during the war, but he was still probably the scariest man, Harry had ever been alone with.
“Sorry, love.” Draco smirked at the pointing lip and apologetically sucked on it.
“Oh. That’s good.”
“We need to talk.”
One could only picture the suffering and investigation it would lead to. Hagrid had also been the teacher to introduce Buckbeak to Malfoy, if he was accused and declared the reason once again…
As the group secured the cage and went back to their brooms, Hagrid loudly sobbed;  “Remember to give him some Breglin Worms... It’s his favorite!”
Harry wasn’t sure how long he had been sitting in the same spot. His thought kept replayed the same thoughts over and over again. He hadn’t moved once, not even to stretch his legs. No, he kept them tightly wrapped in his arms, curling into himself, hoping the physical pain would somehow release him from the mental.  His legs and ass had fallen asleep at least twice and were now just numb. His throat felt scratchy, but it seemed like that he would be dehydrated, after crying snot and tears all over his uniform.
“I don’t believe for a second, you wouldn’t enjoy the chance to dance.” Harry smirked into his drink.
“Harry, good to see you man!” the ginger hugged the smaller boy close before Ron’s protest of acknowledgement came fourth.
“Where are you going?” Damn. The annoying creature had followed him.
“Maybe someone imperiused him.” Neville guessed, sounding almost a little too happy at the idea.
“How are things… with the Slytherin students?”
Chuckling, Harry opened the ribbon and took of the lid. Inside lay a tiny necklace in silver. The pendant showed him a simple Gryffindor crest-lion resting on a silver background plat. It was so tiny Harry almost hadnt been able to recognize the crest without the red background.
“So Harry, was there a reason for you to come down here in such a dreadful weather?” he wondered, pouring them both a cup of black tea.
“They talked about you I think, and it didn’t sound good.”
The old man smoothed down his long white beard, the deep wrinkles on his forehead furthering, as he was lost in thoughts.
*Bonk* *Bonk* *Bonk*
“Jason, do not speak of what you don’t know.” Professor Snape chastised his son.
Damn. Almost escaped. Taking a deep cleansing breath, he turned back with a smile that hopefully didn’t seem forced. Going back, he sat down on the red couch next to Ron. Harry was certainly not going with some sort of icebreaker. If they had something to say, they should just get it over with. Finally, after a rather long awkward silence Hermione cleared her throat.
“Excuse me?”
“Staying here.” Harry followed with shrugging. “Usually, I head home with the Weasleys but things are still… challenging.”
“Nothing, was just figuring out where we should go first.” He lied smoothly.
Snape’s voice was already sympathetic.
“They are gorgeous aren’t they?”
“Leave him alone, you slimy git!” The weasel just shouted as he stormed off with Potter in a tow and all their irritating friends. Left behind stood a shocked Slytherin and five laughing teens.
“Never imagined!”
“Oh, thanks?” Harry had never been able to figure out the beautiful blond girl but he had always been sure he could count on her support. “How are you and Neville doing?”
Draco had to bite his lip hard enough to draw blood, to prevent from coming right there. Seeing Potter like this; needy, panting; What a picture he would have made. But not a picture for anyone else to see. Only him. Only he, got to see Potter writhing underneath him and maybe at some point, over him.
A cough from behind almost frightened him to death. Turning around, his godfather stood in his formal robe – looking almost identical from every day.
“You’re not seriously suggesting I should be going into a classroom or broomcloset, right?”
Harry tried to move a little closer without seeming to obvious. The second their knees bumped, Malfoy moved in. Capturing his lips, Harry practically melted underneath him. Their lips molded against each other, not pushing or fighting simply pressing skin together. The kiss was different from the ones they had shared before. While they had been heated and crazy lustful as two teenagers usually were, this one was almost like talking without sound. He noticed the smaller things and focused on the way Malfoy moved. Tilting his head to the right, Harry let out a gentle moan as Malfoy’s tongue entered him. The warm muscle felt amazing against his own, as was the sweet taste of butterbeer.
In and out.
“Really?” Harry asked as they were handed two butterbeers.
“I must say I was pleasantly surprised young Mr. Malfoy was able to stand up to his father.”
“Hey, don’t you dare blame this on us.” Seamus held out the sugar quill pointing disapprovingly at him. “This place was a total mess before we got in on it.”
“Yeah, but I don’t think he should be alone down there. I tried to take him back myself but he sent me back to the tower.”
“No, we haven’t, okay?” Draco sneered. “Happy?”
“Look at the front.” He said slowly, discreetly pointing at the paper in his hand. The sinking feeling spread in his stomach like acid as he turned it over. And truly it was a sight to behold. Had anyone shown it to him a few months ago he would have burned it and claimed to be possessed.
“Can we speak for a moment?” a smaller hand grabbed his shoulder, sinking sharpened nails into his collarbone. Turning slightly, he wasn’t the least surprised to see Pansy standing behind him.
“No, sorry sir,” Harry distracted himself by getting more comfortable in his seat. “I was simply wondering how you’ve been. It’s been a while since we have spoken, beside in class, of course.”
“Almost time for the train to arrive. I’m the last one to gather my belongings.” Neville closed his trunk and shrunk it into his pocket. Harry felt slightly hurt none of his other friends had woken him up until the last minute.
“How about you Blaise?” Theodore turned.
Pansy led him astray into one of the smaller hallways. Checking around to see if anyone had noticed them, she opened the door to an abandoned classroom, where she quickly pushed him in. Gathering himself, Harry didn’t ask. If she wished to tell him something, she could simply say so. There was certainly no need for the secrecy.
“So Harry, are you going to try out for the Quidditch team again this year?” Hermione wondered.
“So what, Potter? Don’t you get it? He already won! I. LOST!”
HP POV
“Are you okay?” Jason asked with a mouthful of bloodpoppers. Nodding and smiling tightly, they both got ready for Christmas breakfast and lazily sauntered towards the great hall. As always, the great hall was beautifully decorated with tinsel, giant Christmas trees, candles and ribbons everywhere.
“Ah yes, did I get the right one for your birthday?”
Harry could only nod as his hand settled over the egg, secretly hoping for it to kick against him again. In the half hour, he spent at Hagrid’s he only felt the dragon kick that once, But Hagrid promised him he could come back soon, as the activity only would increase over time as the fetus developed.
His hands, clothes and hair were slowly seeping down his body and soiled his couch. The tiny drops prickled him uncomfortably and irritated he dragged a hand down his face and up through his hair. Thinking of the last time he and Draco had been stuck outside in the rain, brought painful memories forth. Draco had been so annoyed since it had ruined his hair, but Harry had said he looked cute. Draco – who denied this to ever have happened- seemed to brighten and tint a slightly pink blush. Harry having noticed this and pointed it out was quickly kissed to shut up. The passion of that kiss had seemed unreal at the time. To this day, Harry couldn’t believe you could fake that kind of feeling.
The next few weeks seemed like a fairytale. Once Severus would have choked on his own vomit at the ridiculous notion of him ever being happy, but this had truly been the greatest time of his life. He spent every day sneaking away from the rest of the group whenever he could without raising suspicion. He was able to most of the time since he hadn’t really been anything to look at or anyone special to talk to during the meetings.
“It’s okay.” Harry tried to smile but it felt rather forced. He knew Draco should spend time with his friends but he couldn’t help the disappointment from overshadowing the fact that he wouldn’t see Draco again before after Christmas.
“I think you should give him a chance. For all you know, he’s really trying. It’s seems easy for us to comprehend why we, as a community are equal, but for a Malfoy it’s a whole new beginning.”
“But this!” He mentioned at the door, obviously indicating that Harry was the reason for his demise.
Coughing uncomfortably Dean and Seamus started to clean up Harry’s tornado just to have something else to do. Harry wasn’t sure if he should say something or let it stay a simple nice encounter.
“No!” Draco moved towards him, but Harry moved out of his way. “I- I don’t expect you to do anything! But Merlin, Harry, I miss you! Okay, it’s not easy but even if you would never want me back… I just really want my friend back. I just miss being with you.”
“Guess so.” Draco confirmed. “What should we do?”
The man seemed very uncomfortable, hearing the need in Harry’s voice. “Actually, I’m only heading back to gather the rest of my stuff.”
SS POV
“I know. I’m sorry.” Harry whispered apologetic.
The blond had obviously been lost in thoughts and almost fell down from the grey stones.
“He’s doing better. He’s just still a bit down because of the whole mess with Draco.”
“Malfoy! Leave him alone!”
Harry waved his apology back at her as he hurried down the corridor. Completely forgetting about Transfiguration, he ran towards the Infirmary. He had a pretty good feeling that was where Malfoy was. Emotions of fear and speculation pumped through his heart. He feared that Malfoy had truly been hurt if he had hit his head on the stone floor in the greenhouse. He wondered why Jason had attacked him. He couldn’t imagine Jason attacking anybody, but unfortunately, based on the given knowledge he recently had inquired he worried it had something to do with Jason’s veela side. And no matter how much he wished it wasn’t true, he knew Malfoy well enough to know he most likely had provoked a reaction from the teen.
Trying to shrug it off, Draco left for his own first class of the day. Transfiguration wasn’t exactly going to be exciting. Entering the class as one of the last ones, he chose the first seat available between his housemates, next to Knott. The Hufflepuffs had brigaded the front of the class, probably fearing Professor McGonagall couldn’t rescue them if they were sitting in between the snakes.
“I lived with my father there. You couldn’t ask for a kinder or gentler soul.” Jason smiled sadly. “It had always just been the two of us together. My grandparents died before I was born, you see. And then this summer I- … I lost him.” He choked.
Over the last couple of days, he had cried who knew how many times, begged, yelled in anger that Json was a coward for giving up this easily. He would yell until either his throat dried out or Madam Pomphrey would stop him.
“I still don’t know. Maybe an Auror but Healer sounds pretty nice too.”
“Potter, do you honestly trust Draco? Really?”
“You mean since he told you, that you were his father too.” Remus smiled helpfully.
“Hi, Harry.”
He smiled and searched his pocket for a sickle to leave at their table. The two unfinished butterbeers was left behind, as the boys hurried out the front door. Hands still joined, Malfoy dragged him along.
Very short chapter, but so much happened! I know it was really sappy but this is two teens whom never really felt love before. I’m sure most of you can remember being a teen and in love. Your life really felt like it was ending when it was over! SO dramatic!
“Yeah. To be… more-“
The living room was thankfully warmer than outside and a roaring fire was kindling. It actually reminded Harry of a Christmas card setting, with the fireplace in the middle with two larger chairs placed around it. A small tree was standing in the background and was slightly decorated but didn’t overshine the actual tree parts. A few presents had been laid underneath and Harry expected that a few was from the other Professors and the headmaster.
DM POV
“Sure.”
“Yes, sir. I’m heading for the library now.” He nodded.
“Hey,” Harry had barely gotten to say hello before Aodhan hurried towards him, butting his head so hard against his stomach he almost fell back. Smiling he hugged the giant around his warm neck.  “Don’t you dare, he would never hurt Harry!”  Hearing Hagrid protesting voice booming, he turned his head to see four people holding their wands ready as they watched Aodhan lick his face and shoulders. Harry appreciated how many of his friends were ready to protect him, but he knew it was unnecessary. As Hagrid said, Aodhan would never hurt him and he was sure of it. Although Harry couldn’t help the warm feeling spreading inside his chest as he watched the alarmed yet determined face on his boyfriend, ready to defend him.
As the two boys stood line, Jason couldn’t help but reach out and touch him every now and then. Tucking away a stray hair, giving his hand a tighter squeeze or carefully kissing him on the top of his head. After what felt like an hour, they were finally able to get inside. Blaise wandered around scanning the aisles as Jason gathered sweets here and there. At the counter Blaise placed three blocks of premium dark chocolate and before he had paid, Jason threw two packs of sour worms and a bag of bloodpops in. Rolling his eyes, Blaise paid for everything and left Jason to take the brown bag from the older lady behind the counter.
“I can’t imagine your mother ‘giddy’.” Draco commented snorting.
“No, no ‘next time’.” Blaise sneered angrily. “We almost lost a hundred point in one afternoon!” he pulled away and took off.
The sounds of steps were all around him. Carefully looking above, he saw Dean and Ron getting hit from behind. The snowballs hit them both square in the back and chest, and they dropped their own snowballs. Sulking, they left the field. Running past, Jason was carrying multiple snowballs. It was quite obvious how athletic the boy was from the human part of his family. Considering Veela’s were strong but rather graceful, this had nothing to do with it.
“I see. It seems painful for you to discuss this matter, Severus. Can I assume you knew his deceased father well?”
“Wish me luck.” Jason tried to smile as he passed Hermione. The door closed and the group quickly tried to gather whatever information they could from Hermione.
Charms had thankfully not started yet even with their little upholding in the hallway. Pushing past the idiots of Gryffindor, the group settled in the back of the class. Getting out his wand as well as paper, ink and a peacock feather to write, Draco sat down beside Blaise, whom had obviously avoided sitting next to Theo.
“Harry, you remember everyone, right?”
Getting up on his feet, Harry tried to walk past them, but one of them stepped in front of him.
“What? That I’m a mudblood?” Harry sneered mockingly. “Like my mother was? And my best friend? Should I feel lucky to have a little magical blood so that you even bother me with your grace?”
Only when Harry had to take an immensely deep breath, did he realize his throat was closing up. Discreetly he tried to hide his own tears of sadness that wasn’t even his own. While Harry missed the thought of parents and the people he wished he had come to know, Jason had lost a parent whom had been beside him all his life, and somehow it seemed much worse.
“You should really stop meddling in my life, Albus.”
How many already knew?
“I… thank you Albus.” Severus hurried to swallow the heavy lump in his throat. “But as it turns out, he is already here.”
“I know, but I think-“
Laughed, Harry just shook his head, happy that his friends had taken the news so well. He didn’t even know if it would ever be relevant for them to know, but at least he didn’t feel so alone anymore. As they were the only ones left in the common room, and the fire died out, the boys decided to head for bed. As each of the boys quietly got ready for bed, Harry decided to have a quick shower first. Even though he was getting quite tired, he felt like his hair needed a good rubbing.
Continuing to eat in peace, Draco imagined what the best scenario for asking Potter out, would be. He didn’t actually know that much about the boy, except he was brash and had a tendency to get into trouble. Most importantly, Potter’s friends were a bunch of idiots. Beside the bushy haired mudblood. Draco hated himself for even thinking it but she and him had tied two years in a row for scoring most points in their finals. Of course, this only happened because the teachers favorited the mudblood to look more divers.
Slowly he approached the only occupied bed in the infirmary. Professor Snape was sitting beside his son, his stoic face keeping the usual calm exterior, but Harry couldn’t help but notice the two hands clutching a single pale one. Remembering the horrified look on Jason’s face Harry tried to stay positive.
Giving a small smirk, Malfoy continued;
“It’s fine, but shall we go inside? I put the kettle on.”
Couching slightly as to cover his intimidated cowering. “Yes, well, I guess you’ve won then.”
“I will see you after class, love!”
Harry didn’t feel like telling his friends, but to be honest, he hadn’t really thought of Quidditch since last year when he had been kicked off the team. Thanks to that bitch; whom still had way too much power sitting on her throne next to that loser, Fudge. Perhaps it would be good for him to try out for the team and get some exercise. Right now though, it didn’t really feel so important to him.
“I’ll give it to him.” Both Jason and Harry must have looked shocked because Blaise accusingly asked them what was wrong. Not wishing to piss his temperamental boyfriend off, the tall boy kissed his cheek, acknowledging what a good idea that was.
Gazing into the steal silver eyes looking into his, Harry knew the answer to his own question. This was why. Because it was Draco. A man seemingly perfect and always in control of every situation. It felt as if as giant bubble of nervous, yet erotic tension was stuck inside his stomach.
Looking rather tired, the professor massaged his forehead before rising from his chair.
“YOU! What are you doing here?”
After the third round of chess –Harry hadn’t won once- they were both pretty tired of playing games.
Harry couldn’t help but be annoyed as Ron stood beside him, reciting every way to difference a curse from a hex. Harry simply tried to relax. While his skills in the written exam had always lacked, the practical exam was his domain.
He laid back and rested against the side of the tub as his body got used to the heat. Once in a while, he splashed the bubbles around and let his fingers dangle at the surface. Feeling his muscles completely relax, he almost reached out and grabbed his cock. Then he remembered what Dean had suggested. Harry had never really had much time to discover his own body. Not anymore than simply getting an erection. There had always been other matters to attend and his human urges wasn’t really on top of the list when you tried to kill a mad murderer.
“-And you decided I was the best option to base their opinion?”
Ah yes, saving the best for last. The almost sickeningly sweet voice woke him up from his daydreaming. Almost sighing, Draco responded.
“I know you don’t believe me when I say this; thinking it’s as how a school-crush state their love, but I ‘literally’ can’t live without you.”
“I said; SHUT UP!”
So this chapter is one I have really looked forward too! I had to rewrite it a few times since I didn’t want to change the characters too much, but I still needed some sort of maturing tone.
Snape had found him.
“Can I kiss you?”
“Our potion professor.” He couldn’t believe it, it felt as if he had been sent to another universe. “Your father – in blood – is Severus Snape?”
“Shouldn’t you be having dinner with the rest of your companions?”
“Oh really? And whom are going with, if I may ask?”
Until he saw the one person whom he couldn’t face right now.
But when everything had seemed lost, Abramax Malfoy took him in. Lucius had been nice enough to put in a good word for him and his talent for Dark Arts. And now, he was here; walking down a street in muggle-clothing no less. He felt disgusted at the denim wrapped uncomfortably around his waist. At least he was able to find a brown turtleneck that wasn’t too much from what he usually wore.
Snape looked a little more relaxed now. Or at least as relaxed as he could.
He should just think about it as if it was his own. Slightly larger but still the same anatomy.
“It’s beautiful.”
“I realized it after watching him interact. He looks so much like you.”
SS POV
“Still seems like a lot.” Harry sighed.
Suddenly Harry realized Snape looked rather uncomfortable. His fist and jaw looked terrible clenched and he was looking out the window as if something outside was disturbing him. Harry wondered if it had really bothered him so much to talk about his parents. Perhaps he should leave it alone for now and someday discuss this new information with Remus.
“But he’s so cute…”
“So where is your brother now?” Harry continued the conversation as he collected the snowballs in smaller piles around him.
Last chapter, Draco accepts a bet from Pansy Parkinson and unfortunately, for him it turns out he has to sleep with Harry Potter AND make him fall in love with him in order to win! But Draco is certain he will win and isn’t scared to try out for the brave Gryffindor’s heart.
“Really?”
“They went to get dinner. I wasn’t feeling hungry.” He turned a page without looking up.
“Blas…” The scratchy voice seemed stuffed and Blaise quickly gathered some water from beside him; gently tipping the straw towards Jason. Coughing harshly on the small sip, Snape told him to take it easy.
The clear and honest answer seemed to piss off Lucius even more.
Harry was pretty certain, he had never known the feeling of love. Perhaps the closest thing he ever felt was affection for his pet snake, Nagini, but not even a snake could seal the hole in the human heart that was in need for hugs, laughter and kisses.
“’Mione?” his voice sounded rather rough and the second he spoke the pounding in his head became backbiting.
The teen, a year younger than Harry, was now taller than him and it annoyed him to no end as he was once more reminded of his low stature. But where the child used to resemble to a following puppy, now stood a quite handsome teen with a huge set of white teeth. Beside the turned-handsome teen stood another Hufflepuff, Harry couldn’t recognize.
“Well… yes…”
Harry could feel the warm blood rushing to his face, possibly giving him a nice blush.
Draco waited until Potter had turned around before dropping the smile. A strange feeling was lowering over him as he watched Potter walk away from him. It wasn’t an angry nor an annoyed feeling, but it was more like… he didn’t know. It simply didn’t feel good watching Potter leave after they had just kissed. A rather great kiss, at that. The golden boy was actually starting to pick up the skill.
“I. don’t.” He stretched. “I don’t like it when people act as though it’s any of their business. I hate it when they stare as if I’m a unicorn.”
“Not completely,” Jason tried to smile innocently. Although it reminded Harry, more like Snape when he caught student out after hour. “Professor you have one for Professor Lupin, right?”
“Dust?” Harry had never imagined such a death could occur, but Snape didn’t immerse.
Hermione looked tired and with a deep sigh told the boys, they had Potion in about an hour.
Distracting himself had worked enough the whole day and now Harry had fallen into the abyss where Draco -the posh twat- was king of making him depressed. His eyes stung and before he had gotten a hold of himself, the drops of rain had become warm tears. Sniffling he moved over and turned on the tv. Desperately he searched around until he found a comedy he had never heard of. Anything that could make him smile a little would be a godsent. It did work, slowly. This guy named Michael and most of his employees seemed rather consent in their little bubble of an office. It was a bit much with all the loud noises, but some guy named Jim and a rather peculiar fella named Drew was a rather funny pair. A few chuckles had managed to leave his lips when he felt his wards vibrate. He could feel the magic inside him curl and the recognition of other wizards or witches. Only his friends had access without setting them off.
Back at the Gryffindor tower, a young man was having the hardest time picking out his clothes. There wasn’t much to begin with, but shirts and pants had been scattered all over his bed as well as two of his friends who were rather amused by all the commotion.
“You? How come?” Harry wondered.
Severus wasn’t dumb enough to not understand the implication and he desperately wanted to move. But where his heart and young adult libido wished to forget everything but the gorgeous man on the bed, his head remained alert and suspicious of the scene.
“Yes.”
The Black haired boy was practically wrestling; trying to escape the encircled arms around him. The encircling tan arms were connected to a tall boy. A Slytherin; Draco could conclude on the green seamed robes. The unidentified boy held on to the struggling friend of his, so he must have been very strong. He barely looked like it affected him how Blaise pulled at his arms in vain. As Draco couldn’t place him, the tan boy was most likely a transfer student and probably in their year, since he seemed to have a rather close relationship to Blaise.
This had indeed been the first time the dragon had even come close to such a thing as smoke let alone real fire.
Now only two presents were left on his bed and one of them could only be a book. The book-shaped one was from Pansy. Unwrapping it he almost threw it across the room but then he actually started laughing. In giant golden block letters across an awful pink cover was written ‘The 101 wedding plans before the magical day’. Snorting he gentle threw it onto the pile of other presents before reaching for the last one. The lumpy package was wrapped rather shabbily. He turned it over a few times looking for a name or a greeting card but nothing showed any indication of the sender. Shrugging to himself, he opened the wrinkled paper.
Snorting the potion professor said; “You will undoubtedly even if I say no.”
“…After school and shortly after I… joined, I was still on the bottom of the line.” Severus refilled his mug. “I had no connection beside the ones from school, no money and certainly no ‘impressive’ background. I only had the skills for dueling and potions. Two items which almost anyone at that point could have given the Dark Lord. I had to fight my way through to gain some respect and I had by that time done… unspeakable things to people. Then the Dark Lord decided to let me prove my worth. A few of the higher ranks was to go on a mission in Australia….”
“The bet didn’t matter anymore, I swear! I had you. That was all I cared about!”
“Oh god…” Harry murmured in utter horror.
“Oh. Malfoy, you don’t have to-“
“Great. It was nice to see him again.”
A giant sigh left the boy the in front of him and Harry could feel the gentle puff of air against his lips.
“But now for both good and some sad news. From next semester we will unfortunately have to say goodbye to Professor Bjorkfire, whom we have had the pleasure of being taught for a few months but he has decided to retire early and that is something we all – especially the older ones like me –accept and support.”
Feeling another body land on top of him, knocked the air out of his lungs. The other person turned him over and Harry spat out the mouthful of snow he had gathered. Above him stood a very self-pleased Malfoy, pinning his arms down on each side of his face.
“Hmm?” Blaise wondered uncaringly.
“I shall leave you to your lesson Hagrid, but may I suggest someone else partner up with Mr. Potter. Such as Mr. Melck.”
“Harry, I’m really sorry about everything lately.” She pulled back to dry her cheeks. “I hate being caught of guard, but that is no excuse. I handled the situation horribly and shouldn’t have lashed out at you or Malfoy for that matter.”
“’even bigger’? Do you know what the old coat is talking about?” Draco whispered behind his glass. Almost invisibly, Harry shook his head.
“Ron don’t you dare go into the girls department!” Hermione left them as she went further into the shop. Ron distractively waved his hand, indicating he had heard her.
After what merely felt like seconds but left them both breathless, they broke apart.
“Look at you. So desperate to feel me.”
The tallest of the boy interrupted him from the side.
“I do believe,” the headmaster whispered. “That Hagrid could use a friend right now.” Padding him gently on the back, Dumbledore sent him along towards the pair. Hagrid was gently stroking the dragon’s head while dapping his eyes with his enormous handkerchief.  “Good boy…”
“…Cold.” She continued. “And it is for a good reason. Draco and I had a rather big argument which has evolved over the year.”
“Nothing, it just amazes me how much you’re eating this morning.” She snickered. “Perhaps also because you’re unusually….
“Shut it and take off your shirt.” Draco pouted.
“Looks good, Potter.” A Slytherin girl quietly spoke up. Looking at her, Harry smiled back.
“What do you mean?” Harry puzzled.
“It is truly a beautiful setting.” Luna was completely ignorant of the rude behavior. “And it is especially a good place for Fruitloompers.”
“We are good, me and my parents. We talked and they have promised not to meddle.”
“Of course, you could.” Malfoy shrugged casually. “And if it looked like you couldn’t reach it, then I’m certain you would have used your wand a second later.” ‘Smug bastard’, Harry thought, fairly certain he was blushing now. Sometimes it sucked to have grown up muggle-raised. Magic wasn’t the single first thought that came to mind whenever a simple problem arose. But it was true that an
“Good to see you, sir.” Seamus smiled.
Not giving them a second glance, Harry went inside. Looking at the walls and the portraits decorating them, nothing had changed from his second year. Back when Harry and Ron had infiltrated the Slytherin cave believing that Malfoy could have been the heir of Slytherin. Back then, it had seemed so likely. In a child’s mind, the idea of an annoying spoilt brat whom they hated appeared to be the perfect candidate for a murderer. Now, the idea of Malfoy killing anyone was absolutely ridiculous. He was a prat sometimes, he was definitely not a murderer. Walking past the portraits, he noticed their disdained looks as they watched him walk by. None of them spoke to him, but simply followed his every movement as he passed. Most of them looked to be from the turn of the century. Old clothes, clownish make-up and white wigs.
“So how have you been since everyone found out?” Malfoy asked.
“Right.” Draco barely acknowledged the fact. He won. He should feel as superior as he was during any win, but knowing that his housemates thought Harry was a trophy. It didn’t feel…. Right. But he would fix this dispute kind of guilt when he told Pansy the truth, everything would work out.
After the next two men in front of him had finally left, Severus was the only person left in the shop. The cashier was obviously a young man with brown curly hair and a very firm ass, but as he was about to turn around a small alarm sounded from the other room.
“As the headmaster of this school I will tell you, it never gets any easier to witness so many students graduating. As we, the faculty and I, are just as proud and excited as you are, we will also feel a loss.” – Harry could practically hear Snape snort.”- Seeing you enter the doors as timid children and watch you each grow with confidence and strength is a true joy I never tire of.”
The cold breeze had hit him the second he stepped outside. The snow covered ground crunched under his boots as he slowly walked through the yard. Other students had gathered around the benches and the one snow covered tree. Beside the tree stood a bunch of Slytherins and if Harry stretched a bit, he was able to see Jason standing there, chatting with his friends. Probably sensing being watched, Jason looked around and saw him. Smiling, he said something to his friends before strolling casually towards him.
“Right, sorry.” Harry tried to smile. “It is going well. We’re getting to know each other better and he has actually changed a lot. He isn’t so-“
Another pop and everything went quiet.
Laughing, Harry hit him on the shoulder. “No, you git. For tonight. It really meant a lot for me you came along. It was really sweet of you.”
Anger once again flared inside his chest.
“Explain? You had a year to explain!...” Taking a shaking breath, he lowered his voice. He forced himself to look into the eyes that for only a day ago, was the first person he had ever loved. A person whom he had actually been dumb enough to believe would never hurt him.
“Severus” Lupin leaned forward on the couch. “How have you been since last time we spoke?”
So there they were, standing outside the probably most glorious room in Hogwarts and Draco was confused as hell.
Even though there was still another month and a half until Christmas, Snape despised the month of November. The dungeons as well as his rooms had a constant cold demeanor and no matter how many heating spells one used, it could never replace the real heat from a roaring fire or the natural warmth from the sun.
The brown-haired teen was kissing Blaise rather intensively and Harry blushed as he felt like an intruder. He gently coughed and both of them pulled back.
“But he did.” He was interrupted. “Why didn’t he try to find another way to stay? Go into hiding or something…”
“I want to tell you something, but you have to promise not to flip out, okay?”
For a long time, Jason didn’t speak. He didn’t even look at him. Harry waited patiently, as he expected the explanation to be of rather significant size. Unicorns usually didn’t attack humans unless they see it as an only option. The beautiful creature was quiet and kept close to its herd mostly. A sigh sounding through the empty dark room almost startled him.
“NO, she is obviously going to tell Potter-“
“That’s wonderful!” Hermione bubbled. “Although I think Ron will miss you at the burrow.”
Now Harry feels slightly ready to be intimate with Draco. (Finally!)
try’.
Still in his pyjamas and with hair even more in disarray than usual, he rubbed his eyes.
“Indeed?” Snape sounded bored as he refilled his cup.
Blaise had a point. No matter the outcome of the bet, Draco could see how much trouble it would become. While still being quite popular, the Slytherin house had taken a fall. The dark lord had vanquished, and Draco was a known death eater even if he was cleared of all charges. God, he could practically feel the headache already. But there wasn’t anything to be done now, he had accepted the bet and he would win it, no matter the cost.
Pansy shrugged. “It’s not surprising you don’t believe me, but seriously, Draco is the one whom have been lying. He is a Slytherin.
As they said their ‘goodmorning’s and ‘Merry Christmas’s around, the two boys sat down in the middle of the single long table. As he poured up scrambled eggs on his plate he noticed how Jason could barely keep in his laughter. Giving him a rather curious look, Jason sent a quickened glance down the table. Turning around he observed the wondering amusement. And a sight it was.
Harry couldn’t help but envy the feeling of completement, Jason described. To feel like you belong with someone forever and looking like pieces of a two-pieced puzzle. It was one of the things, Harry secretly wished for. He had never experienced love in the form of another person like that. He once believed himself in love with Ginny, but he couldn’t force it to become anything more than a casual fling or perhaps even just brotherly. He certainly had had a big crush on Cho Chang, but it ended so quickly, he never got to feel like he missed her.
The entire hall erupted in cheers as the students hurried everywhere. Some immediately ran to their families, others hugged eachother and Harry had to deal with a lot of crying girls as they tearfully said goodbye.
Fearing to see the blond asshole again, Harry quickly nodded and went on his way. While he had no intention of going down to the dungeon, he did still feel guilty for not leading Snape down to his private quarters. After all, his son had just been on the edge of death and that would obviously take a toll on anyone. Professor Snape was without a doubt the greatest spy and therefor the greatest liar, Harry had ever known. ‘Perhaps he should send McGonagall down there?’ or better yet, Remus. Both men had lost plenty of friends and lovers along the way, and this would possibly be easier for Snape to confine in him instead of Harry. While the men still weren’t on the best terms, surely any company would benefit the professor.
The laughter behind him followed and the group continued their journey.
“I got it!” Seamus leaned into both of the very curios boys. “Give him something sensual.”
“Step away from the creature, Potter.” Professor Snape had already removed his wand and pointed it at the dragon. Unfortunately, Aodhan didn’t seem to like all the attention and gave a toothy snarl towards the Slytherin.
“You know… people just make a big deal out of going together…. All the couply-stuff and I thought we should, you know, try to catch a dance at some point.”
“Well, sit down then.” Zabini appointed him a chair beside him. Harry gently sat down, still whishing not make too much noise. Sitting in uncomfortable silence for a while, Harry finally asked where Jason was.
Another wave of shame and dread filled him. Merlin… how long would it be before the entire school knew of his demise? Draco would be bragging, there was no doubt; he wouldn’t keep this to himself.
Pulling his wand out from his sleeve pocket, he wordlessly sent ‘Bombarda Maxima’ , hitting the gathered walls and buildings. The snow blew up into fresh crisp snow and spread as if nothing had ever stood there and Severus couldn’t help but feel pleased as he watched something Lupin had created, blow up. He was perfectly aware of the fact that Lupin was still standing beside him and he continued to ignore the werewolf, hoping he would soon leave the premise.
Guilt was truly what Blaise felt right now. No, he wasn’t the one to trick potter but over the coarse of the year he had noticed how close his boyfriend and the golden boy had become. It had bothered him, but not ‘once’ had he imagined how it would affect anyone but himself. Having to go through all that trouble of playing nice with Potter… it had seemed like punishment enough. Never once had he imagined; realized it would bother Jason.
Graduation day.
Raising his head too quickly, Harry flinched as his neck clenched uncomfortably. Looking into the steal grey eyes, he blinked dimwittedly.
HP POV
Malfoy finally stopped and turned to watch him with a speculating look.
A hand on his wrist pulled him a little away from the middle and he realized Draco had been the one.
Blaise had no idea how many minutes – it felt like hours – but he almost frightfully jumped when Fawkes moved to sit even closer to Jason’s face. It made Blaise quite uneasy to watch that huge beak next to his face but refrained from moving. Even though Dumbledore was an old cook, Blaise could admit he was powerful. If he believed the bird could save Jason, he would just have to wait and see.
After the professor had finished retelling Harry’s story, he dared to take a glance at the Slytherin beside him. Jason didn’t seem to know what to believe. He thought for a long time before finally regarding Harry. Severus sat down in his chair and looked from the side-line.
Professor Dumbledore was sitting at the end of the table, wearing a rather big muggle festive hat. The red santa-hat was dangling of the back of his head although the small fuzzy white ball constantly fell into his food as he turned to speak with his colleagues. Harry had to remember to thank Dumbledore for the gift as well as professor McGonagall. Waving discreetly to Remus he had to remember the gifts in his room as they had decided to exchange gifts later back in Remus’ private quarters.
“I see.”
“The Quidditch pitch is closed off now, isn’t it?”
“He doesn’t need to know that! God sake, Seamus.” Dean cried out and dropped back on the bed. Laughing, Seamus only smiled sheepishly at Harry before getting up. Gathering a few items, he headed for the shower. Harry finally moved away from the door and went towards his bed. The silence in the room was rather uncomfortable and it simply wasn’t a feeling Harry was used to when it came to his friends. Fiddling with his own covers, Harry didn’t know what to say. What had been that weird feeling he felt before?
God! He started to sound like a bloody Hufflepuff! To think of sex as anything other than gratification….
Munching on a ham- and cheese sandwich, Harry focused his attention to the subject at hand. He had actually said yes to going out with Malfoy. THE Draco Malfoy had asked him out. Him. On a date. No one would ever believe him even if he drank an entire bottle of veritaserum first. They were going out on a date next time Hogwarts planned a trip to Hogsmeade. Well, maybe not a date, actually. Malfoy had only said he would like to spend some time together. But did he mean as a friend? He hadn’t really seemed like he only wanted to be friends but he hadn’t exactly mentioned the word ‘date’ either…
“What exactly… is happening between you and Professor Snape?” Seeing the shocked face on his favorite professor, Harry quickly apologized for his meddling.
Rotten luck.
The blond just shook his head and Zabini smirked before walking away with Jason, following him like a puppy.
“Do you promise not to tell Malfoy if we talk?” He hurried.
“Good.”
Trying to keep himself from being too hasty, he borrowed the big oven mite and reached into the cauldron. Turning it, he discovered it had gotten much heavier since last time. Carefully turning it, he felt the dragon turning with it, almost as if the dragon had developed more body mass. When he moved the mitten away, he could actually see a tiny crack along the top. Placing the mitten against it, he hoped to feel it move as it once did. It took almost a full three minutes but then he felt a kick against the shell. Smiling at Hagrid, he patted the egg before taking off the mitten.
As he finally through the entire conversation looked up from their hands, Harry burst into tears. Seeing how Remus’ own eyes were wet, Harry tried to breath calmly enough to answer.
Harry got the feeling Zabini wasn’t telling the truth but he couldn’t exactly demand to know was going on and he didn’t want to overstay his welcome before Malfoy even got back. So ignoring the uneasy knot in his stomach, he went back to reading, occasionally pausing to take notes. No one spoke again until Malfoy arrived.
DM POV
No matter, he would never be as uncomfortable outside as he was inside. For the last couple of months, it had felt as if he was deep underwater. For weeks after graduation, he was miserable. He missed Harry to a point where he lost interest in most anything he did. He had started working at the ministry, same floor as his father, just a different department. Work was fine. He got a fair pay for being a beginner, as it was a job he exalted. But the work held no actual meaning to him. It wasn’t groundbreaking or even remotely interesting, but it was a respectable position and as he had no other idea of what to do with his life otherwise, he might as well get paid.
*If you have seen How I Met Your Mother, then it is kind of like the diamond suit Barney buys at Christmas.
“When I lost my father, I suddenly had to make massive decisions which I wasn’t ready to take. The officiant aurors came to stay with me while I… packed everything. But as I cleaned out our finances one of the aurors whom had been staying with me, had collected my birth certificate and other valuables from another vault my father had. As it turned out I had another parent.”
“How about this one?” Dean questioned as he pulled out a dark brown smoking with gold cuffs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He is not an ogre! Beside the whole thing with Buckbeak was your fault…” Harry shook his head, trying to stay on topic. “Please, Draco, I really need you there.”
“Ah young Harry, I am taking a guess that you already heard the rumours going around? Stories certainly travels fast around a school, indeed.” Harry wasn’t sure he was talking to him anymore or himself.
“No problem, just having some fun with the boy who lived.” The Ravenclaw named Lesley shrugged.
“Oh.”
Smirking, the friends sat together, uncomfortable silence keeping it awkward.
And so, a battle began.
“Harry please, all we are saying is just be careful, okay? Even if Jason isn’t a follower, there are still people out to get you, so… just look out, please?” Hermione leaned over to grab his hand.
“One-minute left!” Jason’s voice boomed across the field.
FLASKBACK
“Oh great, the mail is coming! My grandmother promised to send me more parchment.”
After almost speaking for an hour without interfering, Harry proposed they started opening the presents.
The egg in the cauldron had still not moved much. Hagrid once again insured the fire was warm enough and turned the egg over. Hagrid was sweating horribly but he looked more refreshed than Harry felt. He imagined the giant-genes in him was able to withstand warmth better than the humans.
Harry huffed angrily. “Listen Zabini, I honestly don’t give a crap about you, but I care about Jason! He’s lying in the infirmary and he doesn’t have time to-“ Harry hadn’t even managed to finish is sentence before Zabini rushed past him and ran up the stairs.
“It wasn’t exactly my idea to tell everyone.” He couldn’t help but look to Ron, who still stood quietly behind the rest. Figuring whom he was looking at Seamus and Dean almost comically turned to him at the same time.
“It has been a few days since we last met alone.”
“Oh, Harry, Hermione,” She gazed longingly around the table before waving. “Hello everyone.”
“How are your classes going so far?”
“Let’s go back. It’s getting late.”
Right. All he needed was a new plan.
Anyway, if you somehow got a little emotional then I will consider it a success. (thumbs up)
“Oh great! The new candy cones from Honeydukes.” Jason smiled.
“Father, mother?” Malfoy seemed very surprised to see his parents.
“What happened?”
“’Our situation’ as you call it, is going just fine.”
“I don’t know….” Jason didn’t look as happy as Harry had imagined he would. “Things between us are pretty tense right now. We haven’t really talked since the day we got caught in the Quidditch pitch. And even then, we were just yelling.”
“It’s all about charm, my friend.” Seamus laughed cockily as they looked around the shop. Hermione looked suspiciously at new bottles of love potion, ‘New strength guarantied’.
“Pansy…” He took a step towards his childhood friend and enfolded the smaller girl in his arms. He suddenly felt the déjà vu of him comforting her the way she cried when they were kids. “We can’t stay that way forever. I know this isn’t easy for you, but I’m honestly happy.
“Damn it, what now?” Harry tried again, hoping Remus would take the hint.
“I guess.” Harry hesitated before inclining further. “But they are my friends and I would hate if we couldn’t work it out.”
“Ah yes. I remember you.” Luna turned to the oliveskinned boy. “You almost choked on a cookie last year.”
In a way it had worked. The moment Draco realized his father wouldn’t cuddle or spoil him when he was crying, he dried his cheeks and started arguing instead. His father believed it was better to have an argument to push people into doing what you demanded, rather than get it through empathy and pathos.
“Excuse me?” Had Melck just told him…?
“I’m so sorry.” Harry’s hand twitched to reach across their beds to him.
“No, I swear!” Jason reached for another cookie. “One of the first school rules we had was ‘No dragons allowed.’”
“Nothing.” Harry shook his head at ease.
The shop was filled with people as always. It looked slightly smaller but the interior was the same. The second they entered the shop it was as if the outside world stopped exiting. Items was floating in the air, sweeping across the room and gathered stuff from the shelf to hand to people. Silver snakes slithered across the floor, making a bunch of third-year girls squeal in surprise.
“It was only three days ago, sir…”
“The elves have delivered ALL the presents here. Two of them were for Professor Snape and Jason Melck. Do you know him?”
Nodding, Harry smiled. “Maybe we should continue it somewhere else.”
“Nothing.” Shaking his head dismissively. “Just sitting up there, you kind of look like an elf on the shelf.”
The olive-skinned man almost laughed himself to tears as Severus practically coked on the strong drink and announced it ‘too damn bubbly’. He asked for a water, while his date drank the rest of his. Severus completely forgot the time as they sat outside and watched people walk by. He felt such at ease around Lauris. The laughter and positivity wasn’t a mood he was used to around dinnertime. They had to pay inside and Lauris insisted on paying since he was the one whom asked him out. As they waited for the waiter to bring back their change, Lauris suddenly grabbed his hand and got a rather desirous look on his face.
Ron whom had finished his mouthful casually asked the table what time they would be going for the dance, ‘since they would all be going down there together.’ As the group began to discuss the options of time, Harry remained quiet. He felt incredibly stupid as he hadn’t even thought of the fact that he would either be going with his friends at Gryffindor or his boyfriend and the rest of the Slytherin gang. Trying not to sound desperate, he hopefully suggested they could all go together.
Blaise didn’t answer but only regarded him for a moment before turning back to his book. For some reason, Harry could see – not doubt, but a kind of unsettling expression in the hazel colored eyes. As he obviously wasn’t going to get a response, Harry returned to read the chapter he started.
“Just as I said, my love. If you, Draco Malfoy, get someone from… Gryffindor, to sleep with you AND get them to admit they love you, then I, Pansy Parkinson, will tell my parents the marriage is off. Just like that.” Pansy cajoled him and snapped her fingers.
The kiss they shared went slow at first but was soon getting overheated, making both men moan and pant for air. Step by step, their clothes disappeared, leaving their flesh plastered up against each other. Severus hadn’t been saying anything for the entire time but Lauris didn’t seem to mind. He did indeed speak enough for both of them, and for each time he begged for him to hurry, Severus felt himself getting closer. Finally, after an eternity he pushed into the tightened body underneath him. The sweaty and panting man pushed back against him, making them closer than ever. Severus felt so many emotions at this point and the pleasure rose for every second Lauris begged him to ‘take him harder’ and ‘faster’.
Chuckling, Harry pushed himself against him. Their chests moved synchronically as they breathed.
As the large group were contemplating ideas, a light chuckle was released from behind Harry. Seeing the faces on the other teens he turned in the same second, Dean exclaimed excitingly; “It’s Professor Lupin!”
Deciding to embarrass his boyfriend in front of his friends were one of many perks by being with him. Sneaking up behind him, Jason waited for the perfect moment were his love would start talking. He waited…
The students were even more a bunch of dunderheads than usual. They had clearly left whatever small part of their functioning brains outside the classroom, as most of their limited concentration seemed to be centered around Christmas vacation. This did not in any way affect Snape’s work moral, oh contraire. Instead, it made him work even harder to pound whatever small amount of information and learning he could into the youngsters.
Removing several old newspapers, he dug for the remaining book underneath. On top of his book lied the last letter from Jason. It had arrived a few days ago and Harry laid it out on top, reminding himself to reply tonight. Jason didn’t write often, but Harry had been rather pleased when the first one arrived. For long they simply wrote about their casual day to day but soon it became more thoughtful and the friends quickly picked up where they had left at Hogwarts. Harry did politely ask how Blaise was doing, although he feared his question would soon lead towards the blond man, he had neither talked to nor seen for almost a year. Jason was smart enough not to bring it up and usually stuck to summarize Blaise’s career in commercial design business. He still hadn’t had the time to read the newest letter and he was annoyed with himself for not making it more of a priority. He didn’t have that many people around him he could truly say was his friends and he should be better at reaching out.
Stretching his arms above his head, Harry yawned.
The last thing they heard was McGonagall being informed to contact him whenever the team of Dragonalogists would arrive.  As Harry went towards the classroom, he watched the back of Hagrid as he retired. The handkerchief was pulled up once more from the giant’s pocket and a loud blow was delivered. Making his way further into the hall, students started gathering around him. The sounds of idle chattering and annoyingly unimportant conversations only lead him to feel even more alone.
“I live right down there.” Lauris pointed at narrow building. The red brick walls were fading slightly while the cement in between was dusting. The building was only two storages and very narrow but it seemed to be two different apartments.

“Are yeh alone?” Hagrid asked slightly nervously.
“Weird how it never occurred to me to be ashamed of a father whom may have followed a lonely mad man into servantship. Not once.”
Harry knew he should be getting to class, but knowing everybody would be staring at him, he simply couldn’t take it. Turning away from the corridor to which the charms classroom was, he left for the dungeon. Should he go to the Slytherin common room? No. No one except Malfoy or Jason would probably let him in. Perhaps Professor Snape was available. Searching for the right passage for a second, he headed for the Potion master’s classroom.
Handing Severus, a cup of black tea, Albus took his time filling his own with sugar and what appeared to be half a carton of milk. Severus involuntarily suppressed a shudder at this creation, as if it had anything to do with real tea.
I am bored… It has been raining all day and while I love to write, I had really wanted to bike around town on my new bike! Yah.
“Erhm, yeah, sure.” Harry turned over and stood on all fours. He was actually a little relieved that he got to move over, first. He felt embarrassed enough just by lying in front of Draco completely naked. But if he had had to lift his legs and lie there on his back? He would have felt incredible vulnerable.
“I see.”
family he had left. Now he was once again alone. Harry hadn’t had much time to grief over the summer. Being send to the Durleys’ only few days later was the cherry on top. He didn’t have time to talk to his friends or Remus. Better yet, he hadn’t heard from Remus all summer. The man was now the only part of his parents he had left but he seemed to have vanished the scene unbelievably quickly, not informing anyone of his whereabouts.
“Yes indeed.” Fred wiggled his eyebrows at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I still have a few more things to buy.” Harry smiled.
This got the boy’ attention. “Um, sure, what’s up?”
“Mr. Malfoy?” The professor did her best to keep her face stone set, as she wondered his involvement. “I suppose, since Professor Snape will be joining us… but you go back to each of your common room, not a minute later than you have to.” At his immediate agreement, she simply nodded strictly and left him.  As Harry went to the great hall for lunch, he searched for Draco, making sure to tell him when to meet him outside tomorrow. He couldn’t see the blond anywhere but another person whom he hadn’t been speaking to for a while was only a few people in front of him. Trying to catch up he yelled out; “Jason!”
Harry tried to muster up a smile, but it mostly came across as twisted.
“It’s delicious.”
“No, you didn’t, really.” Harry didn’t know what to say. Should he ask? “I just- I have never seen you. Together. And- it was the first time I ever saw two boys- anyway-it… didn’t make me uncomfortable.” Harry finished in a small voice continuing to fiddle with the hem of his robes.
“Watch it!”
Outside his room, he carefully went passed the hall where everyone had gathered already. He would hopefully be able to sneak out the backdoor of the hotel, where the staff entered. Looking back one last time he saw both their parents, toasting to their future.
“Harry, come on.” A light slap on his shoulder did it and he opened his eyes.
“Don’t worry, I never listen to the gossip. Just heard you were here and in Gryffindor. Now that’s not too bad, is it?”
“Of course you do.” Ron grunted from behind the row.
Chuckling, Draco finally got up. “I’m sure you can.”
Harry could for some reason only think of the most Slytherin way to end the game. He finally wrestled his arm free and quickly pulled Draco down, kissing him soundly on the lips. Draco was so surprised he almost knocked their teeth together. Harry gently continued to kiss the boy above him, grabbing his hair. The second he felt Draco lean into him, releasing an almost silent moan, Harry went for it.
am the only one who is actually getting some. So if I were you, I would concentrate on losing my virginity, instead of spending your sad self, wondering about my sex life.”
“You look beautiful.” He said sincerely.
But he wouldn’t cry, not this time.
“I’m not even sure he was capable of such emotions, sir.”
“He took a rather brave chance. A stupid one too, since he had no idea if I was even gay.” Remus once again smiled sadly.
“Yeah?”
“I guess…” Harry thought for a while in silence. Draco had been acting very strange… and it only happened after he had given Harry his sweater. Perhaps some of his friends had said something? Normally his friends seemed… a little cold, but he had gotten the feeling they simply didn’t care whom Draco was dating.
Nodding in the slightest thanks, he left to search the castle. Blaise was most certainly aware that he should ignore the boy until he decided to arrive, but he simply couldn’t sit down and wait any longer, never mind the fact that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate in class.
Of the embarrassing few times Severus had actually had sex, this scenario was furthest away from any of them. They had been quick, rushed or needy. This? Seemed to be so much more.
“Huh?”
“That must have been hard. Having to hide whenever they came over.”
“We shall start by revising the subjects we approached last year. Take a piece of parchment and write down any subject and potion we have examined.”
“Are you still trying to win the bet?” Goyle tried again. His two minions seemed uncertain of his will.
“The Ringtailed Dragonfly.” She obviously didn’t think he needed more context than that, because she simply smiled at him with a dreamy glance and continued to walk beside him. “They are quite beautiful. They are some of the biggest flies that exist, which is why they are named after dragons. Another very big winged creature.”
Halfway through the lecture, the students were required to read two chapters and take notes. This was also in case they didn’t understand the subject and had questions for the teacher. As Harry wrote down his notes, Remus walked by and discreetly slipped a folded note onto his desk.
Draco didn’t just care about Potter.
Jason inclined his head at Blaise, whom looked calmly suspicious, but he could see the underlining tone of worry.
“No, it is alright you ask, Harry.” He sighed. “How did you know?”
“Jason and I are officially going together, so I suppose I will be ready.” Blaise continued to look straight ahead while answering. “Are you?” the tone of his voice turned mocking.
Getting in line to pay, the blond boy asked if he had found anything. Shaking his head, Harry continued to watch the line.
“Hey, it’s fine, really. It feels good.” Seeing the praise gave his boyfriend slightly more confidence he lied back down. “Just try to cover your teeth with your lips. Yeah, like that.” As Harry tried without the member in his mouth. This time minding the teeth, he pulled the member back in his mouth. He tried sucking on it as he went further and further down, the hand in his hair stroking him encouragingly along.
“Things just changed this summer, I guess. He said he was trying to get a second chance and I didn’t really believe it at first, but I think he is trying. Doesn’t everyone deserve to get one?”
“Zabini.” Theodore Knott was leaning against the wall while the Slytherins were scattered around the hallway. Zabini nodded at the others and didn’t really bother to listen in on the chatter. Suddenly the Gryffindors around them moved simultaneously towards the walls and a person stormed passed him. Turning around he realized it was Weasley and he was getting dangerously close to his favorite of the Slytherins.
“Blaise. Who was he?”
“It was.” Malfoy agreed. Harry felt as if something was happening between them. Perhaps an understanding? An agreement?
“Listen Parkinson, whatever you tell your father is your problem. I kept to my part and I didn’t plan on bringing my parents along but somehow it happened. Roll with it.”
“Careful, Parkinson. Don’t believe because you’re a woman that I won’t hex you to the ground.”
“Isn’t it impressive how they managed to get Weazters Burns to make all these ice sculptors?” Luna gently poked at the freezing centerpiece.
“Well how about a bet? You know, for fun. Since this year is going to be an utter drag anyway.”
The idea was so erotic and incredibly dirty, Harry had to force himself to stop from coming.
“So sorry…”
“Why don’t you just use your finger? It’s just chocolate.”
Great.
“We should get to class.” Hermione informed.
He wasn’t sure if Snape was at loss for what to say or if he simply-
“I don’t think an expulsion is necessary today, Mr. Melck.” He gently patted him. “But do remember, should another similar situation arise, I do not believe I will be able to give you the same slap on the wrist.”
“Thanks, Hagrid.” Harry gave him a blazing smile.
“Hey, where are you going?”
“Draco, wait,” Harry tried to pull away, even as Draco groaned in disagreement. “Draco. I’m sorry, I just… it’s too soon.”
“I see.” Snape dismissed him with a single hand gesture. “If you change your mind, come see me after class.”
friend, you don’t have to like him.”
“Fine, I will try. But if he says no…”
“Almost a perfect match.” He teased.
“Not next time like now, but you know, always. In addition, I could use your name too. Your first name.”
“Yes, father.”
“Be quiet! The next student to say the word ‘Dress’ will spend detention the night of the ball.” Snape called out in his devious voice. Instantly the students quieted down but more than a few students looked excited enough to jump up from their seats.
So to Draco, this kiss also felt different. He and Harry shared a kiss that gave comfort and love more than just heat. Maybe Malfoy is actually starting to fall for Potter as well? No, not possible!
Harry slid his hand across the unicorn and sent it flying off into the next frame. He smiled as it ran alongside off him, gracefully following downstairs. As the moving case finally came to a holt, Harry continued following it into the hall on the second floor, instead of taking the next pair of stairs. The unicorn apparently found it amusing and ran faster and faster until Harry had to run as well to keep up.
Trying to gather whatever evidence he had and turn it around, was past him. If Potter had told him everything, there was only an apology left to convince the only man he had ever cared for that it wasn’t as simple as that. While he hadn’t exactly stopped Draco, he certainly hadn’t encouraged it either.
“People already knew-“
“Oh please, Potter, I barely care enough in the first place.” Blaise smirked. Even though it clearly was an insult, Harry was only amused.
“No..” Blaise whimpered like a crying child. Afraid of how truly painful his sobbing would become, Jason held his cheek and smeared the tears across it.
“Unfortunately no, I haven’t sewn in years, my hands aren’t steady enough anymore. But if the gift is for your girlfriend why not try a teddy bear or a music box?” He suggested and picked out a pink box from the shelf behind him.
“Oh right, like perhaps a girl? Maybe Ginny?” Harry tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice but he certainly wasn’t successful.
Left stood the two teens, Draco still supporting him and held on tightly to his hand.  “We should go.” Draco affirmed. He pulled their joined hands towards the main entrance and together they went back up the small hill.  “Are you okay?”
“What?” he asked in a careful voice.
Severus was certain it was simply a way to trick fools – both men and women – to come back. A fool like himself.
